Now, I've read the Wired articles.  I've seen photos that people I know 
have taken from previous years.  I've seen video.  I've heard stories.  
I've seen drawings of self-propelled couches and relaxing hot springs and 
eateries named after hell.  

My conclusion:  Burning Man is not a rave.  It seems to me to be a chance 
for people to just become completely distracted from whatever hangups 
they have and go out into nowheresville and light stuff on fire.

Sounds like a blast!  Doesn't sound like a rave.

Maybe the Burning Man posts should have a NRR tag on them.

So Mr. E has decided to make this a quiet evening after all... Save myself
for a Sunset tomorrow or Spundae's tomorrow night.

Anyways, I'd thought I post to the list tonight.

About three years ago this very month, I introduced a friend in my high
school to the SF scene.  About this time marks the anniversary of me doing
so, and I wonder to this day how he is doing.  He was from Ukraine, and I
was one in the group of friends to befriend him and ask if he wanted to go
out and dance at a party that weekend.

I never thought I'd be one of those introducing someone to the Sf
underground culture, but if it was meant to be, so it was....

He had told me of his experiences in Ukraine w/ the dance clubs there, and
to me, it made no difference at all.  We were there to dance, have a good
evening, and to share our common vibe.

I'd like to say more, but I guess I'm just trying to start a new thread n'
stuff.  

I'd like to hear some of your guys' stories about introducing someone new
to the scene n' stuff.

I still remember vividly at graduation his final words to me, b4 I last saw
him and b4 his plane trip back to the Ukraine, "I can say I've been to a
rave in the Ukraine, Richmond, and San Francisco!"

Goodnight everyone in San Francisco! Be proud and be strong for our city's
strength and scene! :-}
Mr. E

        I regret to say that the Illumination party was broken up around
3:20 or so because someone jumped off the courtyard onto another roof about
20 feet below. This person was a friend of mine but he's doing okay aside
from minor injuries, as far as I know. But I'm deeply sorry to anyone who
showed up, we were not able to have the firedancing or the rooftop portion
because the party was stopped early.

i should be packing right now, but i thought i'd write a quick note about
the wonderfulness that was warmth, maybe i'll be the first (i'm on digest
so i'm not sure...) but...

it's only 4:23, and warmth is still going strong...why am i home then?
well, as i was getting ready to head out, my dad calls and unfortunately,
my grandfather had passed away.  i was prepared for this, and i believe
after a full life, he was ready.  i had to book an emergency flight home to
boston tomorrow morning. i almost didn't go to the party because i would
only be able to stay for less than the amount of time it would take me to
drive there and back (from sacto), but i just got in the car and started
driving before rationalization took over.

let me just say that i am soooooooooooooooooo glad i went.  i had to tear
myself away to leave.  this was a second to none gathering of people
celebrating life, living it to its fullest.  i was definitely absorping a
lot of the love that was in the air.  i think that when faced with a loss
of a loved one, you must reflect on the wonderful things he or she brought
to the world and then you must celebrate the life you are living, and
that's definitely what i was doing tonight.

much thanks and hugs to all the wonderful people i met - esp. beth, jenny,
b))merang, nancy, orson, and rich.

julie, seth, and alex, i looked for you, but couldn't find you, oh well,
next time!

love,
/scott

YES!!!!!!!!! Warmth was such a totally PHAT PARTY!  Thank you, thank you,
thank you to Spencer for organizing it, thanx to everyone who worked so
hard to make last night one of the best yet.  With the exception of the
loss of music @^(, and my difficulties with popping my balloon hat with my
cigarette (more than once!) the visuals (Silicon Graphics Indy WoW!)
decorations, and overall the vibe were absolutley splendiferous and made
for a really fun party!

But it was definately the people who made it.  Never before have I partied
so joyously with such a wonderfully vibrant, loving crowd!  Thank you all!
I met yet more sfravers, hello y'all! (I'm bummed that the poor memory is
failing me on all the new names, but I know I met a bunch of new people
with laminates when I was passing the jelly bears out...... hiya!)  It was
simply an incredibly happy, loving environment and I LOVED IT!

Shame it was soooooooo hot that I couldn't dance for more than a few
minutes at a time, but Micron kept my butt wiggling longer than most -
thanx Dan!  But the music died B4 Macadio got to spin @^(  very bad, very
bad.......

Great to see Leslie there too, strange how she's always there at the _best_
parties @^)

So, all in all, a fandablious nite.  Looking forward to the next one Spence!

luvnhugz,

nick xxx

p.s. My little friend Tigger went down so well that from now on I'm
reverting to my childhood nickname for postings to the list - so look for
Tigger!  Maybe I'll come and bounce YOU at the next party...... @^D

p.p.s.  Killer CD, XOR boys!  If any of you out there didn't get a copy of
the Warmth CD, see Jelo or Fubari IMMEDIATELY!

This was a great party, Uberzone went off, his set rocked the house. 
All the dj's had great sets,  The music realy PUMPUD.  The party was
very just like the flyer, very bright, sharp, colorful and LOUD.  
2 huge sound systems, a phat lazer, and incredible multi wall visuals by
lsd and pink 6.
The setup was very thought out, and there was a lot of room to walk
around and dance.  The security was very polite, and the staff was
wonderful.  
Of course the bigest problem with that location (2nd and jackson) is the
ventalation, and that there is no outside area, so needles to say it was
a sauna inside.  They rented a bunch of fans to blow cold air in from
the streets, but there was no exuast fans runing, so the hot air all got
blown into the back of the buiding, were it must have been 20-30 degrees
hoter then in front!  But the party still totaly went off!

Big props to Global Rythm Movement, and The Demon Colective for throwing
a party with such a good vibe and great production.    
It was nice to see many familiar faces there, and meet many new people.

well it looks like its going to be a good summer for raving

keep it real

hello all-

about every couple months or so, i start to get a little jaded with the rave scene.  i wonder, what am i doing here?  who do i like these parties? 

and then, i go to a party that makes me remember why i rave.

well, warmth really helped me remember why i love to rave.

1)the music rocked.  never before have i danced to much or enjoyed being soaked with sweat (my own and others from hugs) clear down to the bone.  i especially liked micron's set (i think that was it), for he had the crown going.  trance never sounded so g
ood.
and then there was the music in the other large room, sometimes bordering on housey, funky stuff.  a good break from the pounding of the main room.  more space, and a bit cooler, and easier to talk while dancing.
the ambient / chill room was so relaxing... i went there each time i was about to go into the main room to get my energy up, to look at all the happy little groups of ravers huddling on the floor, and then i was ready to dance again!.

2)the chai.  i have never had a chai frosty, but that was, by far, the best way to help me stay awake through a rave.  i was still going strong when i had to leave, the chai gave me energy without jitters.  go chai!!!

3)the visuals.  in the main room, very sparse.  the lasers effectively recreatedthe look of stars outside, while some single lasers mounted to the ceiling made cool patterns on the floor.  it was sparse, but beautiful.
in the funky room, i believe those visuals were done by randy.  need i say more?  it was beautiful!
in the chill room, graphics done by former co-workers of mine at sgi, so i got to play with an indigo (or an onyx, i'm not sure which they were running).  it was great to see other geeks there, tripping out on computers like i normally do.  i felt entirel
y at home.

4)the people.  i'm so happy to see more and more santa cruz people in the sf rave scene.  i think that some of the santa cruz ravers have been a wonderful shot in the arm of the sf bay area scene, infusing new energy, creativity, and love into our scene. 
 i'm going to more and more santa cruz parties, and am really happy that they're coming up to sf, also!!!

and of course, i went to the party with my friend, sarah, who makes any party fun!

so, i hope to see ya'll around soon.  i know i'll be there.  i really feel like my faith in the rave scene as a group of wonderful individuals has been restored.  THANKS WARMTH!!!

love to you all-

matt =)

My silly mailer converted the new welcome into a bunch of garbage when it
was sent - some mailers could read it but others couldn't.  Here it is in
plain text.  Again, I'd prefer comments privately and am totally open to
changing parts of it.

	Brian

*******************************************************************************
Welcome to the San Francisco Bay Area RAVE mailing list!
*******************************************************************************

Please read this completely!

SFRaves is dedicated to discussion centered on the rave / underground
club / techno scene here in the San Francisco Bay Area.  

Appropriate topics include: 

  Announcements of upcoming bay area events
  Reviews of previous events/DJ's/new records, etc
  SF-related and rave-culture-related topics, like smart drinks
  Rave-related stories on local TV stations or newspapers.
  Personal introductions/socializing, to a degree.

Things are very loose, but try and stay focused - think of this list
as consisting of people who are interested in raving in San Francisco,
but not necessarily as the only list these people are subscribed to.
There are a plethora of other mailing lists and newsgroups out there -
for example the "idm" and "ambient" mailing lists on hyperreal or
alt.music.techno on USENET.  There are also more than a dozen other
regionalized mailing lists out there for different parts of the US
and world.


ETIQUETTE

There are a bunch of general etiquette guidelines I want to make
sure you all have at least heard:

1) The list can be very high volume.  To keep it usable for as many
people as possible, and so the machine running SFRaves doesn't keel
over from too much delivery work, please try and keep your messages to
the point and not overly chatty.  If you are responding to a message,
keep the amount of quoted text as low as possible.  Try and keep your
"signature" file to less than 4 lines, too.

2) The list goes to many people, and is also archived for historical
reason; never say anything which you would not want to be seen by
someone far in the future, for example, details of personal drug
consumption, either your own or someone else's.  Though I doubt this
is the case, you should assume that law enforcement reads this list.
If you want an anonymous account, check out www.hotmail.com.

3) SFRaves is *not* a paging service, nor is it a "chat line" for
one-sentence messages.  If you want to just "chat", check out VRave,
at <telnet://hyperreal.com:7283/>.  SFRaves is also not a group
therapy support line - but thoughtful posts about how you have been
affected by rave culture are appropriate, because after all raving is
a very personal experience.

4) The occasional humorous post or not-entirely-rave-related topic is
fine, but please prefix it with the letters "NRR" in the subject line,
so people who don't want to see that can filter it out.  I.e. 

  Subject: NRR: a joke...

5) Promoting your party, your DJ gig, your new mixtape, etc. are all
fine, but please prefix the subject line with the letters "BSP", i.e.

  Subject: BSP: underground party tonight!

6) Offering things for sale are fine, so long as they are marginally
rave-related, such as musical instruments, sound systems, lighting
gear, etc.  This time, prefix it with the letters "4SALE", i.e.

  Subject: 4SALE: SL1200 turntables.

7) Normal etiquette is to wait around 2 weeks or more before you start
posting anything; that ensures that you don't tread on old ground and
that you have a reasonably good idea of the mindset of the list.

8) Posting virus alerts is usually not only unnecessary, but can be
bogus and virus-like themselves.  For information about bogus virus
alerts check out <http://www.kumite.com/myths/>.

9) Don't forward someone else's private email to the list without
their consent.  

It's all about the "R" in PLUR: RESPECT.  The fact that email is free
and instantaneous has given us a really great communication system
here - let's not blow it by abusing it.

Please bear in mind that you are entering a virtual community; that
the people here exhibit a friendliness and familiarity with each
other, and while criticism of posts is not discouraged, please treat
other people's posts with the same respect you'd want yours treated.

SFRaves is not a moderated list - everything sent to it will get
reflected out to the other 500 list members.  However, only people who
are subscribed to the list (or the digest) may send a message to it -
mostly in an effort to fight spam mail.  Since people sometimes change
email address (and sometimes it gets changed without their knowing),
messages can get caught before being reflected and forwarded to me,
the list-owner.  I'll either forward them along, or let the person
know why they didn't get forwarded.  I will not pass along caught

OTHER RESOURCES

There is an incredible wealth of information related to raving, techno
music, and alternative chemistry at Hyperreal, accessible through the
URL <http://hyperreal.com/> There should be an up-to-the-minute
calendar in there; if you have info on events that aren't listed, send
details about it to the SFRaves calendar maintainer, Derek Chung, at
dhchung@hyperreal.com.  There are also other mailing lists there.

In addition, check out the newsgroup "alt.raves" for non-SF-specific
discussion about raving.


SUBSCRIPTION INFORMATION

This is how most of you got on this list: you sent a message to
majordomo@hyperreal.com with the line

  unsubscribe sfraves

And if you just want Derek Chung's weekly calendar, you can send

  unsubscribe sfraves
  subscribe sfraves-calendar

Or, if you want to get on the "digest" version of sfraves (about 1

I'll second all of that. I was a virgin to the rave scene before last
night; what a way to lose that title! Thanks Beth for turning me on to
warmth, thanks to beth and everyone else (esp. tigger fubari  bear) for
contributing heavily to a riteous phat vibe.

Spencer, you're a diety in my little part of the world :)

There was a party in Sac called DJ Soup (it was fun until the po-pos came and 
regulated), and one of the someone named Stillwind was one of the djs . . . he 
was too terrific, and I wondered if anyone knew anything about him, like if he 
has a mixtape, what type of music he specializes in or if he does all kinds, 
or what event he'll be at next, etc..  Any info would be appreciated, cuz I 
have various songs he played boomin in my head and I just have to hear him 
again.

Warmth! I feel it was the best looking, smoothest running, and best 
integrated design (with the other visual artists in the room) that I have 
ever done. Harmony 3 was really good but most of the reason was the room 
itself and so many other artists giving of themselves also.

 I really must give phat props to Spencer! So kewl and unflappable this 
man handled it all so well! Especially nice was his personal attention 
periodically throughout the night to see if I was okay and had everyting 
I needed.

 However the most respectful and heart felt thanks goes out to the kind 
folks that stayed and helped clean up and helped to haul my equipment and 
others back down the stairs. You folks are divine angels and I love you 
all!! 

 This brings me to a momentary diversion and pet peeve; all the energy 
vampires that come to help to get in free and then do nothing. You people 
suck! Almost as bad is the folks that come to help with set up but refuse 
to be there for clean-up. We need both and those that do are indeed divine.

 Party was great!! So many happy people ( a few *too* happy ;)! Hi to; 
Leslie, Patrick, Orson (thanks for the laminate! :), Ma66ie (I hope you 
get your recharger back!),Amy (at last we meet and all to briefly!), 
Matt, Terry, Mike, Jeff and ? (I'm sorry sweety! I forgot :(  ), 
Rebecca Zak and Ned, Deepfog, b((marang, Shin, Dave, Jim, Lara (your soooo 
sweet! :), Rob, and a host of thousands!

 The party was certainly one of the most beautiful (visually) and 
interesting musically that I have *ever* been to! Matt (CF) and Spencer 
(?) were spinning this wierd funky jazz shit with horns that was so 
non-standard rave material but soooo danceable. I loved it! The room I 
was in had a very ecletic feel that I loved.

 The peeps were very yummy and Ann and John were great as usual. The 
crowd was a little bit dense (numbers wise) but this wouldn't have been 
so bad if the heat and humidity hadn't been so outa hand. I like heat and 
moisture but when I start drippng sweat after 10 minutes of playing with 
the lights then that is too much. I can't work in that and put on the 
kind of quality shows that I love to do.

 Another peeve; We had to shut the individual room doors and keep folks 
in when the police arrived. So what does everyone (it seemed) do in that 
hot,stiffling, muggy atmosphere? Why light their cigarettes of course! 
And us non-smokers were trapped in there and could not escape. Very nasty 
and rude.

 The fruit handed out in the morning was well appreciated! Thanks for the 
donut Terry!

 Overall a fantastic party! A 8.95 outa 10.


hugz!

Shouts out to Eric (ERMODA) for pulling off such an awsome party!

The beats were bangin SO hard gotta love UBERZONE if you've never heard 
him live GO! I'd say him and Chrystal Method *(ROCK)* the most in live 
acts! 

The DJs were all on last night too, DJ saint I personally got to know (a 
real kind person, so dam down to earth too. really great uplifting music 
:)  Jazz-e too was rockin, who i later was introduced to; such a calm 
guy, wow! My only complaint would have to be the heat... but it's almost 
becoming a necesity at parties these days, like a rave wouldn't happen if 
it was too cold... dunno! But stepping one SO many water bottles gets to 
you after awhile and then having to deal with all the nutcases that 
continue to ADD to the heat waving their burning death sticks around, yuk!

Anyways, hands down... great party! So happy to have been there, thanx 
again eric! hope everyone who didn't go did have a good weekend too :)

plur, liquid

I was pleasently surprised today when I opened my mailbox and found a copy
of the new DJ Flux vs. DJ Rinse tape.

I popped it in immediately and found some sick ass smooth jungle/d&b!!
The tape has overlays from MC Phluid which just adds to the overall impact
of the sets.  

I don't listen to a whole bunch of jungle, but I'd just like to say that
after recieving this tape and hearing it, jungle has one new fan.

Again props out to Flux and Fluid of the B.A.S.S. Kru for sending me this
tape, I highly recommend it!

Hi allzs, what'z happening? :)
I'm here, just recovering from Warmth'oritis :)

lets see, how shall I start? ;)
Hummm... Once upon a time (sat afternoon) I was supposed to go help
setup and stuff, then I feel asleep while waiting for my friends (who
where also going to help setup and who are very wonderful for offering
me a ride -Hi Amanda and Duston ;)) unfortunately, what I meant to be
a 10min 'nap ended up becoming a 4 hour deep sleep! :( so I woke up at
around 8:45pm then noticed, my ride wasn't there :) oops! 
Anyhow,

Got to the party, and said Hi to lots of peoples :) Hi lots of peoples!
:) much love [*HUGSHUGSHUGS*] ( I would start saying names, but I don't
want to leave anyone out :( ) la la la..the party is going on, then SAM
starts to spin...WOW! I loved it :) it was hella nice :) so I danced a
bit (I usually don't dance! so its a good sign ;P) went into the chill
room for a bit and BoomerangFidget was spinin'...(I think he was?) he
played some GrateFullDead, and ambienty stuff. it was chillin' :) hehe.

then I started feelin' kinda sick :( so I was in a weird mood after
that. I think it was the heat :( the party was definitely "WARM" :)
then the policey peps came and said hi :) so I got a chance to ..walk
around, talk to peoples and stuff :) Spencer was supposed to be spinning
soon at this time :( and I had brought some cool CDs we were going to
play but we never got the chance :(! but its cool, because we get to do
it at the next  :)

back to the good stuff tho...
I didn't get to taste the Chai...but it seemed good ;) hehe :)
the fruits were delicious :) and the decorations were pretty :)
I liked the black-suady-blanket thingy in the main room it was
confortable but it left stays on my jeans :) hehehe...rave-funk!
thats what rave-jeans are for :) 

I just want to Thank all the people who helped throw/setup this party
for all the effort they put into it :) [*phat hugs*] I'm looking forward
to the next warmth already ;) PHAT hugs to all the DJs that spun, I
hella enjoyed the music :) who was that DJ that was playing ROBERT
MILES' "CHILDREN" hella fast? I likes :))) 

In any case. ...time for bed :) 
Hi to allzs and gonite to allzs :)
Much Love and Hugs and Glitter and Candy and Stickers :)
{*HUGSHUGSHUHGUS*}
Pablito

PS: Rhona!! thanks for the treat :)))) I needed that one ;) {*HUGSHUGS*}
  -I know I know..you are not on the list, but just wannted to let
   everyone on it know who wonderful you are ;) {*HUGS*}

it's so nice to hear everyne having such delicious times this past weekend,
while i suffer from working overload to finish the term. i cut my finger and
bruised the other grinding and razor-blading stones. ok. here's this little
dilemma i got. i have no driving license yet, and even when i get one, i prolly
cannot use it overnight to raves and stuff. so how do ppl go around going and
leaving places? where is warmth ? is it far?  obvously, it'll be my first sf
raving experience. and will if feel like a dork going to places? that is if i
find my friend demond. who, if anyone know. i deperately need to contact him.
alright. bye!!! 16 days until home!

ohmygod, i love the sf scene (and all of you!) but let me just say that 
i can't wait to move!!!! we found the most wonderful place in pacific 
beach (pb for the locals!!) and keep your fingers crossed for us, 
because hopefully 2 of our roommates will be moving down next week 
because it is available next sunday.... i love it so much! it's this 
cute little blue beach cottage.. super stylish, and you can see the 
ocean from our front yard! phat party town! and our next door neighbors 
are 3 extremely beautiful boys! i met some very cool rave people (woo 
hoo) and went surfing.. and there's a ton of jobs! so if you guys are 
ever in san diego, you'll have to stop by!! =) i am so sunburnt i can 
hardly walk... it's right across the tops of my legs, and my left arm 
from being on the passenger side when we drove from one end of san 
diego to the other ( we went from escondido/del mar, all the way to 
tj!) love you! happy monday!!!

                                       much love,
                                anissa, princess of the universe!

This is certainly a sad rave moment and may be fortelling of other changs
in the future.  For those who have been around long enough you knew that
Ameba was rave central.  You could call the store and find out about
parties.  Before everyone became a DJ you could find good DJ tapes from the
top DJ's of the time.

in '92 the store was really hitting.  You couldn't go to Toon Town and not
see some of their designs on the dancefloor or hanging from the roof.  The
store has truly been the epicenter of this whole thing for a while.  One
must wonder what has happened?  A change in styles and tastes, people
getting off the dancefloor and behind the dex.  Yikes! I'm sad to see such
a rave/party institution vanish.  Oh well...change is inevitable.

Good luck Alan & all the other amebites with all your future projects,
John

The point is not confrontation but human nature.  When told no, the human
has a natural tendency to say yes.  Even if the reasons for a no answer are
valid.  I consider this our animal tendency.  In any case I see your point,
I just hope other abide.

Nope B-man.  I won;t be going this year or probably at any other time.  I

     i don't need to tell you guys what a great party warmth was.  for me 
     though, the craziest part was dancing in the sauna in the rear of the 
     building.  the heat told me to go away but the music always brought me 
     back for more!  What was the list of dj's back there, and approximate 
     times?  I would love to get some mixtapes of some of that.
     
     also, I heard some really cool stuff from the front room, although 
     house really isn't me.  than they broke out what sounded like jazz!  
     cool enough to keep me beaming.
     
     want to say thanks to cool people everywhere.  also wanted to say hi 
     to ben and iris.  i really didn't feel too good when i woke up from 
     ruby's, and i don't even hardly remember saying hi to you   :-<  that 
     brings me to saying thanks to these people   ben ruby ed byron, the

Hey ravErs nStuff!   =]:


 Ok..  I got my mixer. Numark 1800X phat, dope, azz, does everything I want
it to nStuff!
 And now. I am puting in an order for some new needles and... Well. I have
run into a bit of confusion.

 I want the best needles and. Looking at Ortofons.. It looks like the "NEW"
Ortofon Concorde DJ E is the best.
 But there is one thing that is making me wonder.

 I am wondering if the Concorde Night Club E is actually better than the
Concorde DJ E..
The Night Club E specifies that it is great for scratching and
back-tracking. But the DJ E does not specify that.. So it makes me wonder.

 My first instict would be to assume that the Concorde DJ E is also great
for scratching nStuff. But I can't find no specs that specify it...
 Anybody know?
 Is it the Ortofon Concorde DJ E
 or do I get the Ortofon Concorde Night Club E needles?

=[
Life really sucks sometimes you know.
Thanx!
Jeff

Im totaly with you on this.  It breaks my heart to see any
institutionalized component of out community disapear.  I have a lot of
pride for Rave-Born industries (stores, record companies, clubs,

Kinda bummin, I was around when Mark first opened the store.  Oh Well

Hi kids,

I just realized (thanks to Rubilicious) that I partied 4 days straight. 

On Thursday I was at Mirasol, Friday I went to RETURN TO THE SOURCE,
Saturday I went to Warmth and sunday I went to SunSet.

I have to say that Sunset was BEAUTIFUL. It was my first and definately
not my last. I'm going to go every time now. It was awesome. I cruied down
to DJ BLOOM's house to pick him up with ED.. and we hung out there and
BLOOM spun for us... it was awesome. Then we went to Sunset and really
enjoyed ourselves. The two blondies. (ed's a blonde now!). We ate left
over pizza and nice cold beer... then I watched the sun set down on the
beach.. this would be so nice to share with that special someone in your
lives... it's so spiritual and inspriring.. it would be cool to propose to
someone as the sun exited our view. Just a thought.

let see... I saw so many of you this weekend and was able to meet a few
more!.... too bad Elena missed me at the Cala Foods... (she was late!)...
This was definately a grade A weekend. I had so much fun.

Well.... back to work!... Yahoo! Happy,Happy, Joy, Joy!... :'P

(---- Byroni -----)

ps. anyone else going to Nikita on Friday to see DJ DIMITRI (sp?) of
DeeeLite? Ed and I are going... some of you should as well!

Well, I must say this was a very nice sunset.  Good house music.  I haven't
heard so much house in the longest time till this weekend.  It was a great
change of pace from my norm.  The vibe was very very good.  There must have
been close to if not 600-700 people there.  Nice one! =)

Hello to all the people I met and talked with.  To many names to write
down, but you all know who you are.

The only down point for me was the wind kicking up dust.  And let me tell
you it was pretty windy at one point....=)  Other than that excellent
gathering.  See you all at the next one.

good day everybody!

i want to say how proud i was of all of you kind and wonderfull kids.  it 
was a real embarrasment to me to have to turn the music off around 
4:30am.  but what fallowed i felt was almost as incredible as what i felt 
when the music was on...connection.  even though the music whent off most 
of you stayed!  i saw hundreds of people just kicking back and enjoying 
time together, sharing stories, energy, and love...and when you all 
helped me sing happy birthday to my good friend rob i could have cried!  
you kids stuck it out 
and even though the music was off for 1 and a half hours the party still 
whent to 6am!  thank you for your kind understanding and enduring energy.

i do want to make everyone aware of what happened as embarrased as i am.  
it turns out some ambitious people took the initiative and opened some 
windows.  obviously they must have been very hot, the heat was 
deffanitely an issue and a problem so who can blame these good people for 
oppening a window to get a breath of fresh air, i certainly can't, i can 
only blame myself for not supopling better circulation. 

unfortunately open windows allowed the energy and sound out of the space 
and some folks down the block, who where no dobt trying to sleep at 4 in 
the morning, decided to call san francisco's finest and have this 
intrusion of thier restfull night put to an end. 

well we would not let 
them put an end to the party or the love that was preasent there but they 
did take away our music, an event that i must appolagize for and accept 
responsability.  I am sorry, very sorry about that.

well, i just wanted to get that off my chest.  Thanks to everyone who 
helped out and put real time and effort into making the tingle theory 
happen.  I am beamming with pride and fulfilment after saturday night, 
again you kids blasted through problems and showed me how wonderful and 
inspireing people can be!

love
spencer

Subject: WARMTH my favorite party ever

This is my warmth review but i have to go to work so ill make it quick

  I arrived at around 6:30 to help set up and I knew it was gonna be a hell
of a night as soon as parked my big blue cadillac right in front and was
greeted by big hugs from everyone. 

  first of all i'd lke to thank spencer and everyone that helped out with
organizing this party.  the first coulple of hours i spent wandering around
catching up with old friends and meeting new ones.  and of course i had tons
of long warm hugs and kissed for everyone of them.  the people at this party
realy did it for me.  I still get the total tingle through my body when I
think about it.

  some of you may remember me as the one going through the rooms trying to
get everyone together for the gigantic group hug.  some how i ended up in
the middle of the hug and i was sooo happy somebody looked at me and said
why are you crying.  I didnt realize I even was.  I could feel such great
vibesw flowing into me from everyone involved.  It was quite a spiratual
experiance. thank you. 

 then when micron was on i tried to dance for a while cause he was tearing it up
at one point my to best friends came and grabbed me and dragged me in there.
one of our favorite songs was on and we stood trere and hugged for a while
and loved one another.

  the rest of the morning i spent with a very special girl from vacaville
named lisa.  we just layed on the matresses and cuddled through the night
and there is no way I would ever want to change that part of the night.  but
one part of the night that I would want to change was my friend clay tried
to call in sick so he could go out to coffe with us but they wouldnt let him
and we were all very sad.

thanks everyone of you.
                       love seth

     i don't need to tell you guys what a great party warmth was.  for me 
     though, the craziest part was dancing in the sauna in the rear of the 
     building.  the heat told me to go away but the music always brought me 
     back for more!  What was the list of dj's back there, and approximate 
     times?  I would love to get some mixtapes of some of that.
     
     also, I heard some really cool stuff from the front room, although 
     house really isn't me.  than they broke out what sounded like jazz!  
     cool enough to keep me beaming.
     
     want to say thanks to cool people everywhere.  also wanted to say hi 
     to ben and iris.  i really didn't feel too good when i woke up from 
     ruby's, and i don't even hardly remember saying hi to you   :-<  that 
     brings me to saying thanks to these people   ben ruby ed byron, the 
     guy who gave me the fruit to pass around, rich, shawn, beth for the 
     cigarette, and all the other people i met.

I felt the warmth and connectivity.  I hope everyone who attended did
also. For those who were unable to attend, I hope  you can feel the
warmth from the many reviews.  

Warmth is just one of those party's that no matter what happens people
stay together.  People attend to see/hear/feel the music, but they are
really there to spread their love and warmth to all.  I had such a
wonderful  time/expiernce.  I just can't put it too words. 

I went with the love of my life (Stefi) because Warmth is where it all
began for us.  We may not currently be together but we still share many
woderful moments together.  

I broke my promise too her. I promised her that I would not work at all
at Warmth, just attend it an enjoy a party together for once.  But of
course a young teenage girl needed my EMT skills so I helped out and got
the girl back on her feet.  I knew this would be ok with Stefi because a
human life is far greater than anything else to us.  

I am sorry to side track but I felt I needed to say that last bit.  I
hope all who attended had a woderful time and many woderful moments as I
had.  I hope to see you all at the next Warmth.  

Please I can't emphasize enogh PLEASE BE SAFE, we all love you and want
you to take care of yourself so you can still be present with us.

AGREE---nodding head---Yes this mix is a diffinate winner.  I also 
haven't listened to a large amount of Jungle so at first it was a little 
off my beat, but it is phat.  Thanks for the tape.

i kinda started wanting to kiss everyone, hehe but luckily my
boyfriend stopped me :) heehee

I LOVE YOU GUYS SOOOO MUCH!!!! (mind you i'm sober right now:) i was
the happiest little camper saturday night. met so many wun-dur-ful
people can't remember names but i sure do remember your beautiful
faces :) :)

i wanted to see macadio spin but my ride wanted to leave early :(
<pout>
i promise next time, i'll stay to hear your set and promise to dance
dance dance til it ends!!! :) 

i didn't mind the heat.. one of the few... i think if you just say "aw
screw the heat" and delve into it, it feels hella good :) okay so i
was sweating balls and it was kinda gross but :) heehee

justin loved the chill room and the pads... woooooooo what a great
place to just lie down and stare at the visuals on the wall :) the
location decorations whoah! loved it loved it loved it! and the
SFRAVES WALL and the touchy feeling wall was so rad. i wrote in the
book drew a picture of myself :)

okay so i'm being super super super duper happy. 
i met this hella cool guy that told me when you're peaking on.. stuff,
do something like press against your wrist really hard for like a few
minutes, and then the next day or whenever, you press on your wrist
again, and you'll feel like how you felt at the rave :) so that's why
i'm a bit ecstatic! :)

anyways back to work...
"good afternoon octel..."

<HUGS&slOPPYWETKISSIESheehee>

                      Warmth <3 <3 (Review Long)                   06.02.1997

Hey all of you sfravers!

I hope all of you had a great weekend!  I sure did. =)  Warmth was a beautiful party. Lets see, our night began with a great pasta dinner, because we all need our carbos for energy. We got around to the ritual process of, glitter, sticker, candy, toys, etc. =)  We eventually hopped in the car and headed towards San Francisco.  We made a quick stop in Palo Alto to pick up a fellow SF raver w/ out a ride. (Hi Diego)

We arrived at the party and I saw, nothing but smiling people.  I scanned the dance studio. I liked how all of the rooms were open!  I noticed that I hadn't even started dancing, but I started sweating.  It was pretty steamy in there.  : P I wanted a place to sit. So I found the Neon face painter.  I went wild with that. If any of you saw me I had a design on my face.  Lance, (I hope that is your name) you made sitting there for 20 min. bearable. Thanks, and I hope to see you soon. 

After I got familiar with the space and said my hellos, I wanted to go dance!!!!  My best friend Ora said that Micron was spinning. =) He was so awesome! Even though I was dripping sweat, he still "took mE thErE" Thanks for the Laminate Micron, you are such a sweety.

I relaxed for a while in the chill room. Loved the black lights!  And I finally made it to where Boomerang was spinning.  I danced for a little while. (Scott, I looked for you. Ora told me you were around, maybe next time. =) )  Hey Candy Christine, where were ya this weekend??Ben and Iris, did you go?? I looked around for you.To all of the Warmth people, thanks for a great party! The fruit was nice!  If I forgot to thank anyone else, thank you!  I love you all!!! =)

Have a good week!
Much love, and smiles

Julie

There is only one problem non-ravers have with loud rave sound system 
and that is ...it is loud.  Not everyone likes rave music. When you 
plunk down a huge system, everyone has to listen to it. One of the few 
rules of BM is..Not to interfere with anyones immiediate expierience. 
Very few other festivals have gone to the trouble to accomidate ravers.

The BM project is really happy that Feel Good Expierience is throwing a 
Real Rave. One that is close to hospitals and can provide the amount of 
drinking water neccasary. With a McDonalds nearby, And most 
important(dont take this lightly!)   Flushing toilets!!!! None of these 
things are available at a festival that glorys in self suffieciency of 
its participants.

Once again, let me stress that *Ravers Are Welcome*. This year I believe 
that Ravers will prove how important they are to the whole vibe of BM. 
This year is the year we start building Villages. Gather your friends 
together, build a large shade structure, stock pile ice chests, gather 
equipment for a communakl kitchen,

Dre,

Whazzup?

I saw you at Sunset but was a bit too baked to talk. :-) 

That was my first Sunset and I really enjoyed it. Really beautiful to
party outside in the twilight.

How can I get my hair to turn white?? Me and my buddy want to look like
Replicants from Bladerunner... in terms of our hair color. White as can
be.....  bleach I hear.. but how exactly do you do it?

is Analog your next party??

Later,

Byron(i)

Hey Spencer!  No worries, mate!  You dealt with the sfpd admirably, and
were able to allow us to continue having a wonderful time, music or no
music!  The love and warmth we all shared was far more powerful and
important than the music...... I think I probably enjoyed the end of the
party the most!

luvnhugz,

nick.

I am sending you this to help all the people who keep getting these massive
amounts of chain letters. Lately it has really gotten out of hand and AOL is
doing nothing to help. This is a helping hand and a cry for help to stop
these annoying chain letters. At least read it before you delete it.

THE DEAL IS:  THIS LETTER GIVES YOU THE POWER TO NEVER HAVE TO SEND
   ANOTHER CHAIN LETTER EVER AGAIN.  YOU SEND THIS TO 10 PEOPLE WITHIN 7 DAYS
OF
   THE TIME THAT YOU READ IT,  AND FROM THAT POINT ON YOU CAN IGNORE,  OR
READ
   AND DELETE,  ANY CHAIN LETTER SENT TO YOU.  THE BEST PART OF THIS DEAL IS,
    YOU WILL STILL GET ALL OF THE LUCK, LOVE, OR GOOD SEX GUARANTEED TO YOU
BY
   ANY CHAIN LETTER YOU READ!
   EVENTUALLY THIS WILL STOP THE CIRCULATION OF ALL CHAIN LETTERS.  SO, IT IS
   VERY IMPORTANT THAT YOU SEND THIS OUT ON TIME!!!  AND THE CATCH IS, THAT
IF
   YOU END UP NOT SENDING THIS ON TIME,  OR NEVER SENDING IT AT ALL,  YOU
WILL
   GET ALL OF THE BAD LUCK,  NONE OF THE LOVE,  AND NONE OF THE GOOD SEX FROM
   ANY CHAIN LETTER YOU GET.  THIS IS FOR ALL OF THE SUPERSTISIOUS PEOPLE
THAT
   HATE CHAIN LETTERS,  AND ALL OF THE EVIL PEOPLE THAT WRITE THEM.  
     GOOD LUCK, LOVE AND SEX TO ALL OF YOU!!!!!!!
   
   Your Magic Helper Phriends,

I recomend that dr660 to anyone looking for a good yet inexpensive drum
machine...i love mine...and for the price it ain't bad for that crazy
"techno" music.  has good sounding 808's and 909's...without spending 700
for a drumstation...

ok

Hats off to the Warmth crew for putting on one of the _best_ parties I 
have ever been to!

With just two parties, Warmth has established itself at the heart of the
SF rave scene.  The vibe there Saturday night was akin to what I've
experienced at Friends and Family and the best Harmonys, and reminded me
of why I'm in this scene and the power of what we're creating together. 
Thanks to everyone who was there for restoring my fading faith in
openness, friendship and connection among Ravers.  I haven't felt unity
like that in a long while, and it's amazing.  The experience we are all
lucky enough to have - of what it is like to leave mistrust behind and
welcome others with a loving heart - is something more powerful and 
special than a lot of us probably realize.  It is choosing to treat 
others with kindness and openness rather than alienate ourselves through 
fear and cynicism.  It is choosing a different way to be in this life, 
and the joy we have felt in that moment of connection is transformative.  
It is hard not to be changed when you really get what has happened.  Nights 
like at Warmth show us what happens when we choose positivity, and the 
rewards that are possible, if we choose to do it.

I ran into a friend from Berkeley who was at his first rave.  He sat 
dazed in the chill room, and spoke of feeling his everyday cynicism 
melting away, and feeling liberated (ah, we bagged another one!!).  
The newbie friend I brought simply called it "awesome."

I was so surprised to read what Spencer wrote, because after the music 
ended was the most inspiring part of the night for me.  I had always felt 
that the music made the party, first and foremost.  But at Warmth, the 
cops shut off our music at 4AM,  but that didn't stop the party.  I saw 
hundreds of people just chilling together, laughing and talking and 
buzzing with positive energy.  Music was no longer the glue holding us 
together - there was only all of us just being together, and that was one 
of the most special things I have experienced in the scene.  We left at 
5:30, and the party was still going strong :).

Not to mention the dazzling environment - beautiful decorations, light 
shows, the touchy-feeling wall!, the SFRaves alter where people drew and 
wrote, the oranges and grapes in the morning, the frosty Chai, the 
massage table, a bunch of great toys, and of course the clean and 
good-sized dance studio (with all rooms open!).

Downsides were of course the heat.  Micron was throwing down a slamming
set in the early part of the night, and I could only sluggishly move in
the Sauna.  After that, the combination of heat with lazy, jazzy tunes
meant I (and a lot of other people) didn't dance... but, for once (at
least for me), the music wasn't the focus of the event. 

This is probably my last party in the Bay Area (I leave in two weeks).  
The party was so good that when I was there I started reconsidering 
moving away!!  But now I am just so happy that my last Bay Area rave was 
also one of the very best... thank you all for all the memories over the 
years.

Also HI! to all the SFRavers I met and re-met Saturday night.  Too many 
to name (but you know who you are! :)  LOTS of people wore their 
laminates :) and the alter turned out to be a great meeting place - let's 
do that more often!!

Still feeling fuzzy,
Nancy

The British couple is staying at my computer-less house right now, so if 
anyone needs to reach them you can leave a message for them on my machine 
at (510) 548-8718.   I think they're still looking for places to stay if 
anyone would be kind enough to put them up for a night or two (you know 
those budget ravers!)

They could also probably use a ride down south at some point, in case 
anyone is going and has room.

They're very sweet, but very tired after a week of travel and strange 
sleeping arrangements.  So, I think they're going to conk out for a couple 
of days here in quiet Berkeley, and emerge in a little while to party 
with you all again :).

To all of those who brought your love & happiness to Believe...

Thank you!

It was a beautiful party with vibe so thick that you could cut it with a
knife!

Keep it real, and stay tuned for Acidic sometime in July or August.

warmth was the bomb.  the fans were a major plus, they made a big 
difference in the heat factor there!
micron's set was phat, i don't know, i seemed out of focus the whole 
night, i ended up spending alot of time "away" from the party, so it 
wouldn't be fair of me to review the whole thing, but i must say spencer 
you have a tingly thing running through the SFRave family and it's 
contagious as HELL! :)
orson and maggie's SFRave altar was beautiful, i slapped a pic of me and 
a few SFRavers in that book...

a note, the family poster didn't work out as great as i planned as my 500 
sheets of paper and 3 packs of crayons and 2 pack of markers disappeared 
within an hour pf the party starting :( :(
however, alot of the kru who were setting up got to draw themselves,a nd 
a FEW partygoers did too. the butcher paper didn't stand so well, it got 
a few holes in it, so i have a little plan..

1) everyone be prepared to bring a picture of yourself to happy kids or 
wherever i am.. or orson, (haven't asked him if he'd help collect these, 
hey orson wanna help collect these? yerdope)
:)

2) see a stack of paper/crayons at the door of the next party and draw 
yourself there, and leave the pic at the door in the folder provided.
(this might be a good to leave your pic in here instead of giving it to 
me, as they will be in one place
or ask me for my home address to mail your 
picture to me.

then, in AUGUST for BEATS AND BARBEQUE, i will put all the pictures on 
the butcher paper, create a surprise for you all! 

And i'll keep all the pictures loose and in a binder or folder until 
then, so if you want to see whate veryone has drawn so far, you can!
is this a good idea?
or any new suggestions??

THANX TO PAULA FOR CREATING THE "FAMILY" FOR OUR BUTCHER PAPER and 
everyone else who helped make it happen.. yeah.. 
:)

still tired,
still in love with u all,
l;ara:)

also I've seen Djs take two not very interesting records, beat match them
keep them in the mix, and create something that really rocks; and truly is
as original as what the producers created.  Some records are made to be half
(if not a third) of a DJs performance.  What bugs me are DJs who play those
records alone and we get to hear the same 4-beat pattern 64x - _boring_.

It's been the best party I've been to in a long time!

I've finally met people from sfraves, and YOU guys are soooo coool!!!

Thanks Beth, Leslie, Ma66ie, Ran,  Pengo and everybody else who I've met (you know who you are), now I feel like I have a second family... =)

The vibe was so great that I still have a tingly feelings right now =)

I can't wait to see you all again, what party do you think most of you will show up at?

The sfraves altar was sooooooooo cool, I signed the book, and I looked over it, and there were so many of you there, and I wished I would have met all of you.

Maybe we should have an sfraves picnic, or camping... let me know... I know alot of areas where we could have so much fun, and it would not cost all of us that much... Anybody is interested in helping? or giving any ideas?

LUV u ALL,
HUGS, and PLURity,

hi all you sfravers

ben and iris (aka laren.k@easynet.co.uk)have arrived in san francisco
and really enjoyed their first party here, i.e. warmth. what a fitting
title for this party, it was soooo hot, but really great. loved the
hard room, which made us miss deepfog's set. sorry mate :)
thanks for ed leech for taking us under his wings and introducing us
to a few people, although we were still too tired and jetlagged to
have the energy to talk to a lot of people and to do a lot of dancing.
we'll be more energetic next weekend.
thanks to byroni for chauffeuring us around and hi to everybody else
we met.
can't talk long. we're at an internet cafe and the clock is ticking.

iris + ben

the  first thing that i think of when i wake up...every day i go through 
is not over soon enough, i just barley get through the week- just long 
enough til i can see you.  minutes are like hours & hours are days and 
the day has become a week before i know it, such tortures i endure before 
i can be with you again.  My sweet and everlasting love, my one true 
romance-we stand the test of time, and we shall triumph in the 
overall...you & i.

Ya know something,

I bitched at Brian about moderating the list.  I went on and on about
letting people discuss what they will before bringing out the firehose.
But now it is all happening again, albeit much more slowly than last time.
NRR posts are starting to invade the list again.  Soon, it'll be pages to
so and so, then all out fights.

If this list gets more NRR stuff I would then think moderation is the only
way to maintain order.  C'mon people, let's stop the NRR stuff.  Let's keep
the list nice and rave like with rave and party oriented subjects.  Poems
about warm and fuzzy feelings w/o mention of beat one, should be relegated
to alt.poetry.

If you have comments, please e-mail me privately.  Now please, let's keep
the NRR posts to a minimum.

Why do we not seem to learn from even the most recent mistakes.

Late,
john

At first I wasn't going to attend this party due to my ride situation, but
thanx to the wonderful people at the BART planning line, my trip was
possible. Yay BART.

This was a rilly fun party and the music was soooooo incerdible. DJ Dan was
awesome and Uberzone got everyone to get up and groove. The anime visuals
were very tripnotik! Both rooms were playing awesome music it was so hard to
decide where to stay! The overall vibe was cool, lots of friendly people, and
lollipops!

The one thing missing from the party was a chill room. The portapotty area
sort of became a chill area, but it wasn't too pleasant of an experinece
considering the unidentifiable goo and gunk surrounding the area that people
were forced to sit on. 

I hope that everyone else who went had an awesome time, and those that missed
it make up for it some other way!

action i most likely would of been in critical condition, and just may not of
made it. Well that is all under control thank god, but now the infection has
moved into my jaw bone, i go in for surgery this friday to get this thing out
of my life and be on the road to being completly well! 

	So iam sorry if i have not been getting back to you all with the wedding and

into my wedding and getting intouch with all of you! no i havent forgot you

hey there sfravers,

just wanted to let everyone know that we have plenty of the warmth CDs 
left for ppl who wanted to pick one up at the party but didn't get to. 

we've been working on this cd project ever since the first _warmth_....
we created this CD for YOU...as a souvenier, as a way to commemorate the 
experience that is _warmth_  and as a way to always bring you back to the 
collective energy and love that flows at a _warmth_ party. 

In case anyone didn't get a chance to check it out...it is a double disc 
set featuring Micron and Macadio, and Thad and Deepfog. 
Digitally mastered, full color graphics, track listings, pictures, and 
more. 
They will soon be available in a few record stores...(once we get a 
chance to drop them off) I'll post the locations soon :)

But in the meantime you can get them directly from us...just send an 
email or give a call and we'll put together a collective time/place for 
everyone to pick up copies...and soon.

hola sfrrraverrrs!

finally, a moment to sit down and express thoughts about WARMTH,

1st a million + thank yous to all involved w/ the organization, your 
are super humans! especially Spencer ;)  

what a glorious VIBE! 

*besos* [that means kisses for you non spanish speakers] to
my best buddie ~CHRISTI~, i love you!  and to ~Orson n Ma66ie~ [thanks 
for the laminate!] ~Rubilicious & Ivan~ [cute sis n bro!], ~Peter~ 
[you are an amazing artist!] ~Omar~ [muchos besos guapo!] ~Robert~ [we 
remembered each other from the first Warmth!] ~DeReK~ [hey cutie!] and 
~Byroni~ sorry i was late ;/  ~Macadio~ sorry you didn~t get to spin 
hun =(

i leave you w/ a thought by Lama Anagarika Govinda
  <<The secret of concealed power of the sound of the vibration, the 
creative power, as it reveals the nature of things and the phenonema 
of life, as well known to the prophets of ancient times...Pythagoras, 
himself an initiate of eastern wisdom, spoke of the "harmony of the 
spheres," whereby each heavenly body--and this also applies to every 
atom--produces a special tone peculiar to it alone on the basis of its 
movement, rhythm, or vibrations. All these tones and harmonies form a 
universal harmony in which every element, regardless of whether it 
retains its own function and character, contributes to the unity of 
the whole. Every atom continually sings a song, and in every moment 
the tone creates dense and fine forms>>

remind you of anything?!
Love, ~e~l~e~n~a~

Spencer,
Don't be embarrased.  The party was SOOOOO GOOOD.  It was my last party
before I go home for the summer and what a wonderful way to end it.
(posting a bye everyone message later:(  I wish my ride didn't force
Evan and I to go.  I wanted to stay so bad.  We tried everyone for a
later ride to Santa Cruz.  Oh well,  I was sooo happy to see everyone
there and it was the most beautiful I have ever seen that location. 
Wish I hadn't had such trouble with rides and could've helped.  But the
point is you did such a good job!  No need for embarrassment.  The night
was terrific!
Love,
Breton Veach

hello sfravers

you guys dont know me because i live in la, but i just wanted to write to
thank y'all for the awesome time i had at warmth last sat night. i was in
sf for the weekend and had never been to a bay area rave before. i wasnt
sure what kind of crowd to expect, just slightly worried because i heard
the people at The Infinity Project were not the PLURiest kind, not mean,
just not very friendly. Id left all my raver-wear at home, all i had was my
black t-shirt and 501s and my own piece of the vibe, and i brought a friend
who had never been to a rave before, we had the most unbelievable time!

highlights for me:

i did not know whatsoever what the lineup was and exactly who was spinning,
but as soon as i got there, someone was spinning "7 Days & 1 Week" yay!
danced my wiggin ass off! will this be on the Warmth cd?

played with a bunch of some girls stuffed animals, including a little
stuffed frog. "he doesn't have a name" she says "oh" i reply "help me think
of a name" "um... all i can think of is kermit" i say, she apparently
doesn't like that "whats your name?" she asks "joe" i say and she responds
matter-of-factly "his name's joe!" and so i hugged her gleefully, so
flattered was i! i get such a warm fuzzy smile across my face just thinking
about it...

some girl gave me her two blue glowsticks so i started going around and
tripping people out on the dance floor with them, waving them around
peoples' heads and so forth. god, how i loved the wonderful smiles and
looks of joyousness that spread on peoples' faces!

i liked the way the music was stopped at one point to cool the room down so
that everybody got a chance to rest together at the same time. everything
felt so tight, together, and communal by this simple act, just everybody
resting up and talking together. i needed it and i was grateful.

met a couple of you listers, one guy scott from sacramento gave my friend
and i a ride from f-8 to the place, thanks! another named joe just like
myself gave me a cool laminate that said "e"! unfortunately he duct-taped
it to my shirt and it fell off later. i felt very sad about losing it...

before stopping, i just want to add that you guys are some of the greatest
around, i love your scene, i so much want to go back so that i can party
with all of you again. thanks for the wonderful time, love and hugz to all
the new friends i made and ones i have yet to meet!!

joe

one of my best friends in high school just came back from college in
humboldt <sp?> and was telling me about the rave scene there - there
is none. some of the locals there tried to throw one but didn't have a
clue as to what they were doing. tons of people showed up... but no
one music was produced.... except for a stereo and a few cds.

anyways my point is, i wanna gather up a whole bunch of you
wun-dur-ful people, shove you all in a van (or several vans) and TAKE
A ROADTRIP TO HUMBOLDT!!!! :) :) :) :)

mind you i have no idea how to throw a rave but i totally think it
would be soooo cool if we showed the fellow neighbors some love, great
vibe and awesome music. 

the cool thing is that in humboldt (said by maureen) is that the cops
are more laid back. and there's tons of barns with no houses
surrounding it, just forests everywhere :) so we wouldn't have to
worry about waking up the neighbors :)

i totally want to do this and i really need your help. justin and i 
will be heading down humboldt in mid august just to visit and go
mushroom hunting woowoo :) and perhaps find a cool space where we can
have it. so if any of you want to help out, or go up to humboldt with
us, please email me back. CAN'T DO IT WITHOUT YOU! :)

lotsalovebabeee!

Man o Man,
	Talk about Great Music.  I Love the Music we all listen to.  Their is 
no other that can compare.  I can feel no other in my veins as I do with 
the rhythms and beats spun by our DJ's and performed by the musicians.  
I realized this all over again at Believe.
	We arrived at 10:30pm and Jazz-E was spinning in the main room.  I had 
a few people come up and ask me who was spinning because according to 
them "He Rocked".  And Jazz-E did Rock.  I heard him at FGE, but this 
was incredible.  After Jazz-E spun, UberZone performed live.  I know DJ 
Ghost was there to hear UberZone because Ghost spins breakbeat and 
UberZone played some Phat BreakBeats.  He played that song.."What is the 
Brain doing, What is the Brain doing?"  That was Flocking Sick.  When he 
was done, DJ Dan got on the decks.  Whoa!  did I say Whoa!?  I know DJ 
Dan is a master spinner, but Wow!  Jam after Jam after Jam.  The visual 
Japanamation on the screens was fun to look at.  I was staring at the 
screen and I saw something floating toward me (on the screen).  I 
couldn't tell what it was.  But as it came closer and closer, I realized 
it was the word "Pascal" floating towards me, indicating that Pascal was 
now spinning.  And at that same time, I heard a song come on repeating 
the word "Believe...Believe...Believe"  And the Beat was tight.  I Loved 
that song.  I felt like jumping up and down until my head hit the 
ceiling.  Major props to ERMODA for such a success and a Great Party.  
Yes the Heat was bad, but the Big Ass Fans were very refreshing.  Did 
anybody else notice that the water tasted like shit?  The floor was 
dirty, but then again I'm always dancing and never sitting so it didn't 
really matter to me.  It was packed, but this was at the same place as 
Harmony Spring Massive and I heard that Harmony was more packed and 
Hotter.  That's enough for me.  Time to split like a Banana.

I've been quite lathargic in giving my review of this awesome party but I
just can't stand it anymore.  IT WAS THE DOPEST PARTY SINCE
SUPERLOVE!!!!!  Gosh, I just loved it.  I brought my friend who was new
to raving and he loved it. 

First off, I would like to give thanks to Micron (I think) for spinning
"Hardcore Vibes" by DUNE.  That was one of the first techno songs I heard
in hospital in Germany that ignited my love of techno back in '95.

N E WAYS, I have never seen so many damn SFRaves laminates.  It was
totally crazy cool.  Good to see Orson and Maggies excellent shrine.  I
left my mark in the book.  It was cool seeing Elena, (am I really cute or
just cute?), Chrsti, (thanks for the smoke), Macadio, (oh, well, there
will be other times I can watch you rock the house.), and the countless
others I said howdy to.  I think I sweated out part of my brain so I
can't remember everyone I said HI to.

The DJ's were great and the live techno in the Chill Room was awesome. 
Every room was a pleasure to be in.  The vibe was so thick that I found
it difficult to walk through it and be everywhere at once.

To sum it up:  THIS PARTY HAS THE EXCELLENT HONOR OF HAVING THE          
                                LAMINATED TICKET HANG ON THE WALL IN MY
BEDROOM.

To everyone who set up, ya'll did a great job.

All i can say is that that party kicked #ss.

Thank u soo much to everyone who came out and a SPECIAL thanks to
those of u that actually had the guts to dance in the sauna.  i
thought that i was going to pass out.  

All i can say is that party was about people.  I met/re-met so many
cool and chill ppl.

okay...that's enough sap...i think u ppl. get the point.  I want to
thank the ENTIRE warmth crew for putting time and energy into this
party.  Without u guys to set up and tear down there would have been
no warmth.

thank youuuuuuuu....

8)~
micron

p.s.
to those that were asking about the line-up.
i think that it went like this:

10:30 ish to 12:15- Wizard
12:30 - 2:15 : micron
2:15 - 3:15 : dave coleman (atleast i think......he was the one that
played some phat house tunes)
~3:15 protolab.....live (they *may* have gone before dave...they were
scheduled to)
and macadio was supposed to close...... sorry supahstah dj.....

i don't know how accurate this is..so spencer...or someone....can u
help clarify this???

Sorry for posting this to the list, but I want to know other peoples
opinions on this. I think the NRR's are sometimes really cool.... and I
enjoy the variety or different types of messages on here rather than
ABSOLUTELY everything having to do with raves.... like many people have
said before.... thing about the rave scene is it's diversity and
differences... I like the NRR's.... they sometimes show what other
people are interested in, or interest other people. if you truly didn't
want anything that's not rave related on the sfraves mailing list, you
shouldn't of posted what you posted.... it's not about raves or the
scene... it's about moderating a mailing list. Now I ask the others on
the list what they think about the NRR's? I like 'em... and if you
don't.... the great thing about NRR's is that they are NRR's and are
easy to delete when you don't have time to read them.

love.and.peace to ya'll, jer

on another note:
just to let ya'll happy posters and flamers know.... the reason we have
so many lurkers is because they're afraid to post to the list because
they don't want to get flamed. I met a lot of them at WARMTH =) and
that's what they said. =( poor guys.... to bad there's so much stinkin'
flamin' on the list here.

But isn't warm n fuzzy feelings related to raves? Isn't that what makes
the rave scene different from the club scene? Its why a lot of ravers
rave, because of the warm fuzzies n the warm fuzzy people. I'm thankful
for all the posts 'bout givin people hugs n people sayin they love each
other and all. it makes me feel ,heh, 'warm n fuzzy' inside, especially
when i start thinkin this world is cold n harsh. the thing that makes
this list different is that we are a family. i wuz on NYCraves for a lil
while, and, man, that list is just so cold. after this list was
moderated, it seemed so empty. i wuz so sad, and i almost unsubbed.
Thank goodness for lara. she gave me advice and reminded me of all the
good peeps on the list and helped me see. *HUGGLES* lara!

so i agree with jer about the NRR's. i like em too. i'm glad they're
starting to come back =). 

*HUGZ* to u all!

love,
orSon

I don't post very often, but here are my thoughts on this: It's a
community. Yes, there is music, and parties. There is much more than that
as well. The emotions and other *human* stuff that people need to share
with each other is a relevant part of our culture. There is art created by
ravers... There is poetry created by ravers... If these things are inspired
by such scene, and said events, then (imo) they are not only relevant, but
necessary... In other words, they are alternative forms of
communication/expression. An essential part of the lifeblood that keeps us
together. Let us not ban something so integral... This is a good forum. I'm
glad its here, in whatever creative form it takes on.

I don't see what's so wrong with them either.  After all... isn't the purpose
of puting "NRR" in the subject line for filter folks (including myself) to be
able to either "delete" them or redistribute them to a different folder?
Then again, if you don't have filtering capability and don't like "NRR" posts
that could pose a bit of a problem. :)

I agree. Most of you probably remember me as the super-spamming spaceboy.
But seriously, if it hadn't been for the support I got from the people on
this list when I was depressed, I would not have been able to pull through.
I'm not sure I would have been able to stay sane for as long as I did. I'm
not saying that this list should be used as a substitute for REAL friends,
but sometimes it's all we have. (and oh, a lot of the people are friends
of mine in real life as well, and I'm thankful for the opportunity to meet
them!!!)

So, if you need to post something that you think interests anyone on this
list, or it's somehow related to the scene AS A WHOLE (that means that it
doesn't have to include the letters B,P, and M...), GO FOR IT!!!
If you don't want to read NRR posts, get a mail program with a filtering
function.

And whatever you do, don't stop loving the music, or the people around you.

love and huggies,
jonas THE SPACEBOY WHO WISHES HE WENT TO WARMTH... =)

the NRR post that show up on this list from time to time.  Even more so, I

   I can't even begin to explain the incredible vibe I received from this 
party. It's monday morning, and happy mad beats are still rushing through
my head!

   First I gotta say that there has not been a time in my life where I 
have met so may incredibily friendly, interesting, and completely awsome 
people. That's what made this party what it was. The people. I usualy
would go off now and start naming names but I met soooo many people that
I wouldn't even know where to begin. One name I gotsta mention though. 
Spencer...you are the man! :)

   For this party the vibe began at 3:30 pm, so many people putting thier 
heart and soul into the atmosphere and the excitment was so thick you 
couldn't cut it with a dull butter knife. I had to leave at about 4:45 
but when I got back at 8:15 the vibe had grown ten-fold, it was really 
intense, and it made me soooo incredibly happy to be a part of it, and 
the party had not even started yet!

   Once it did start things only got better. I did my usual running around
trying to meet as many people as possible and I knew from then this was a
really special party because I hadn't met one person who wasn't boppin'
thier head or didn't have a huge smile across thier face.  The music was
simply awsome! I unfortunately didn't catch all of micron's set but
everytime I went into that room it was jam packed! and EVERYONE was
dancing, unlike anything I've ever seen at that place. Sure, it was hot, 
Sure someone complained and I was pretty bummed that macadio didn't get a 
chance to spin, but this incredible vibe just didn't quit. With or 
without music, we pulled together as one great big family to make this 
amazing party by far the best I've been to yet...ok, I guess I'm being a 
little redundant now so I'll stop :) you get the point!  

WARMTH WAS AWSOME!

Stay cool everyone!

Matt - the newer one *8^)


P.S. Gotta thank Jeff and Ari for giving me my first lesson on spinning!
     It's SOOOOOOOOOOOOO addictive :)

People shouldn't *have* to go out and get a mail program with filters.
People *should* be able to be on a list and expect the people to be
somewhat considerate of each other by following the guidelines and enjoy
what it has to offer with or without filters. Besides, if you pay close
attention to the welcome message about this list it gives specific
guidelines as to what this list is about... here is a direct quote for all
of you who missed it...

"Appropriate topics include:
  Announcements of upcoming bay area events
  Reviews of previous events/DJ's/new records, etc
  SF-related and rave-culture-related topics, like smart drinks
  Rave-related stories on local TV stations or newspapers.
  Personal introductions/socializing, *to a degree.* (<---key words)

<snip>

3) SFRaves is *not* a paging service, nor is it a "chat line" for
one-sentence messages.  If you want to just "chat", check out VRave,
at <telnet://hyperreal.com:7283/>.  SFRaves is also not a group
therapy support line - but thoughtful posts about how you have been
affected by rave culture are appropriate, because after all raving is
a very personal experience.
4) The *occasional*(<---another key word) humorous post or
not-entirely-rave-related topic is
fine, but please prefix it with the letters "NRR" in the subject line,
so people who don't want to see that can filter it out.  I.e.
Subject: NRR: a joke..."

I don't mind the occasional NRR posts, in fact there are some really good
NRR posts that I have read and been glad to get, but it just gets out of
hand most of the time. And I think that is what the focus here is. I don't
think people are *truly* against the NRR post (I know I am not), it's just
that there is so much of it all the time and so many truly irrelevant and
thoughtless posts, that people get very bitter about *any* post that isn't
"rave related" whether it be something that may be interesting to them or
not. I feel the same way. Even this thread is getting out of hand and
unfortunately, I felt it necessary to contribute, so please accept my
apologies. But can we stop this now? I hate getting sucked into this stuff.

How's this for a thread?... Rave Campouts... best?... worst?... what you
think of the idea of having such a technological experience in the middle
of a vast forest, where usually one should be "back to the basics?" How has
it enhanced your experience being outdoors for a few days? (try to keep it
sober experiences... those are usually the best IMHO)... discuss...

[THIS IS NOT MENT AS A FLAME, THINK HAPPY THOUGHTS WHILE READING]
There's a big difference between a few well written NRR posts a day, and
clogging peoples mail boxes with whatever pops into your head.  When I
first joined the list, there were much more thoughtful, informative posts
and a lot less useless "look at me! i've got a 'net connection and I know
how to use it" posts.

I don't mind when someone says "hey peoples, this is neat and I thought I
would share it with you."  But when people post 4 times a day, and all they
can come up with are a bunch of 3 line messages stating how dope there
friends are, or they post 31k worth of SPAM chain mails, that's
inconsiderate.  It's one thing to congratulate a promoter on an excellent
party, it's quite another one person to use THREE separate posts to tell
the promoter it's all right the music was turned off.  

I like reading some NRR stuff too, I really miss Boomerangs stories nstuff.
 But try to keep in mind that some of us are at work and don't have time to
wade through 100 messages looking for the 30 or so that fall under the list
guidelines.  

Brian B. created this list for us to discuss all things vaguely rave
related.  Why do we continue to repay him by blatantly ignoring his
guidelines?

Ok...its time to put the art party together.

Thank you for all of the response...we have at least 40 people
interested in this and even tho my original intention was
to have small private gatherings this looks like it is going to evolve
into something much bigger...i have even had dj's offer to spin
at these.

So what we want to do is have gatherings to listen to some music
either live or from cd, have some good food...maybe pizza
or a cook out and create various art projects.

These will be paintings, sculptures of fluorescent dolphins, butterflies
aliens, UFO (ultimate friendship objects), altars, geometric sacred
shapes
and anything else we dream up. Perhaps even slide and video shows
if we can get the equipment.

This is basically art for ourselves but if we come up with some really
good
stuff we will offer it to be used at various partys.

These are partys to socialize, enjoy each others company
and to focus the energy of the party on creativity and art.
A mini-renaisance perhaps?

I want to do three groups, one in san francisco , one in 
the east bay, an one in the south bay so it will be
convenient for all and maybe a huge gathering of everyone
occasionally

These will be monthly perhaps weekly partys depending on the level
of interest.

So i want to have an initial meeting to meet everyone and make more
specific plans

Any one interested please email me (off list) and tell me where you live
and what day and time is good for you. I want the first meeting to be 
with in the next two weeks.

Also if anyone has space they would like to let us use for the initial
meeting
or the partys let me know

Please be thinking of what you would like to create.

This will be open to all who want to participate...you don't have to be 
a great artist to join in although it sounds like we have some pretty
talented people.
So even if think you have zero artistic talent you are still
welcome...you just 
might find you have a hidden talent.

have a wonderful day

hey y'all

sorry if i this message got around to those with BSP filters.

n e wayz, i just picked up a dope ass CD today, Logical Progression Level 2
from the bad boyz at
Good Looking records.  this bombass CD is a 2 disc set featuring artists
from Good Looking such as:
LTJ Bukem, Blame, MC Conrad, MC DRS, Tayla, Artemis, Seba, and Intense.  CD
one is mixed by Blame
with vocals by MC Conrad and MC DRS, and CD two is unmixed.  Blame spins a
seamless set on CD one.
i haven't listened to CD two yet.  but anything from Good Looking is
definitely phat ass.  for all the followers
of Logical Progression and Good Looking, this is a must have.

latez,
d0u8l3 J;)

Hopefully this'll get filtered out too :)

As Jenn and a few others have said, it's not that I or others think that
chatty warm-fuzzies shouldn't be posted to the list, just that sometimes
they get a little bit much.  Since I turned off moderation I think the
level of NRR stuff has been a little high but okay, with the exception of
the chain letters which got forwarded (by someone not even on the list,
actually) - chain letters are just plain trouble, and the person who
posted it didn't even mark it NRR or edit out the hundreds of lines of
mail headers.  Oy. 

I've gotten some good feedback on the guidelines I posted, and everyone
has been pretty positive about it, so I've installed it as the new welcome
message.  Please read it if you haven't yet.  I will set up something to
send a pointer to it every week or so to this list.

I do indeed want this to be a social list, where people can express
themselves and meet others and plan to hook up at parties and such.  

	Brian

And if you find the US version you have a collector's item. London pressed
and distributed the domestic release before closing the deal with Looking
Good and they ultimately didn't obtain the rights, forcing a recall of all
copies from shops in the second week of release.

Well, I'm graduating on Saturday (yippee!) and I have Grad Nite on Saturday 
night, so I want to go out Friday night to celebrate.  But since I gotta wake 
up so early and I'll be out so late the next day, I have to keep it local.  So 
does anyone know about anything going on in Sacramento (or somewhere around 
here) this Friday?  Preferably not a club, but if it is, it can't be one of 
those 21+ places because my friends and I are kind of underage.

Help please!  Peace be to all the Sacramento ravers, who refuse (sometimes) to 
commute to the bay to get down!

 Heres the deal, i will be relocating to the lovely land of Reno Nevada (only
to my utter dismay) And i know not one single person in the area, nor
anything about if they have any scene such as ours, and how i'd find out
about it, so if you know any beautiful people up there or, know anything
about yummy raves up there i would be so very thrilled to hear from you!! I
have heard of a few DJ's from the area, but i still lack all the essentual
knoledge to learn to be content in my new little home
Hugs, loves and kisses to all!!  :o)

Come Correct once again.. Johnsin.. here..

Some comps you should check out on CD..

Origin Unknown presents: The Speed of Sound - RAM Records
This set of tunes has been long awaited.. Many of the tracks have been
getting caned by Hype and Andy C for couple of months while they were still
on plates.  Unbelievable tunes for Andy C and many other RAM recording
Artists.  They brought you "Valley of the Shadows" (31 Seconds) back in
'93.. Must get this one.  Dark rolling hardstep for your ears..

Grooverider presents: The Prototype Years - Prototype
Longtime grandfather of Drum n Bass takes a break from his sets at the
Metalheadz night at the Blue Note to bring you this epic collection of
techstep and other dark tunes.  Artist featured are Dillinja's
"Silverblade", previously featured on Metalheadz, the one like the Optical.
The new kid on the block Boymerang with the unbelievable tune "Still" that
has been tearing up the floors of London for sometime, and many more from
Grooverider himself.

Also recommended:
Blame Presents: Logical Progression 2 - Good Looking Records
Platinum Breaks - Metalheadz
Torque - No U-Turn Records
Artcore 3 - React

Take care.. johnsin
massive magazine #17 in SF this week.. peace

In the last issue of XLR8R there was a pretty extensive "Reno/Tahoe" 
scene report.  I saw a bunch of issues still at Drop Beat, though they 
seem to be out elsewhere.   You'll also be within commute distance (well, 
kinda!) of Sacramento, they have a nice little scene there.

ahh, john lee and i once again agree... (ohmygod, what's goin' on? ;^)

brian has done a great job screening posts to bring us back to reality a
bit.... and now has opened the door again for self-moderation ... and ..

it is OUR responsibility to keep the appropriate things on sfraves ....
sometimes that means giving your special favorite funny little post you want
to share a second thought ... then a third thought..  because maybe it's NOT
really appropriate for sending to 500 people whose priority is to share info
on raving and related topics...

because, as much as we may like you .... getting chain letters of *any* sort
on a list like this has no redeeming value .... and poems, as john says,
unless they are about raving per se, are also probably better off in a
different forum.

and for some of you ....I would suggest that, for those who love to shout
out their warm fuzzy feelings to their friends ... how about creating your
own small distribution lists, then you can make sure that your friends get
your happy posts (because they're the ones who care the most) .... and the
other 490 people on the list will thank you for it...

to me, it's not just if it's rave related ... it's even more importantly if
it's of interest to a large number of the many people on this list....  i'm
cool if it's NRR, but it's a little frustrating to weed through the "hi!
it's a wonderful day!" posts and their multitudes of replies when i'm trying
to be efficient scanning to keep track of what's going on ...

ok?  much love, leslie

For those of you who live in the South Bay,

They have a machine at a store called YAOHAN in San Jose/Campbell, too.
The stickers are really, really neato!  But here they have kitties and
doggies and stuff like that on the sticker, not Sanrio pictures.

my friend has some used trackspots for sale.  When I say used, I mean 
that they have been at his house only, never left, and were used for 
about (20) hours at most.  

He's selling them for $840/each and they come with (5) spare lamps each 
(40 total - $400 value)

If you or someone you know is interested, please respond to
geoff@radiomail.net

Thanks

If there are any ravers from the San Rafael/Marin area out there in
Email-land, pless email me privately.  I am new on the list and to raving but
love the life, the scene, and the people.  I would love to meet more ravers
from all over.  I belive that the closer knit we are, the more fun we will
have.  From the bottom of my heart, love to all.

Hello there happy girls and boys, it's me, your brother Earthlyn again...

Well I am sitting at work right now, and all of a sudden I realized something,
there have not been rave related jokes in awhile. Well I've got something that could
somehow relate to us, and something which is kind of funny....


Ok, here is the situation: YOu've had the best weekend, you've gone to the
best party, you've met tons of people, the stuff that you got this weekend just 
ruled, and even was better than the first time you did it... But here is monday
again, and you go back to work. You walk into the building feeling very spiritual and happy, only to realize that people around you are dull, and boring....

Well here are some tips on how to keep the wackiness at your workspace and prolong the fine that you had during the weekend...

Enjoy

=)

Alik aka Earthlyn

LUV and PLURity to all of you...


    
 Put a chair facing a printer, sit there all day and tell people you're
waiting for your document.
     
 Arrive at a meeting late, say you're sorry, but you didn't have time for
lunch, and you're going to be nibbling during the meeting. During the 
meeting eat 5 entire raw potatoes.
     
 Insist that your e-mail address be
"zena_goddess_of_fire@companyname.com"
     
 Every time someone asks you to do something, ask them to sign a waiver.
    
 Every time someone asks you to do something, ask them if they want fries
with that.
     
Send email to yourself engaging yourself in an intelligent debate about
the direction of one of your company's products. Forward the mail to a 
co-worker and ask her to settle the disagreement.
     
Page yourself over the intercom. (Don't disguise your voice.)
     
Name all your pens and insist that meetings can't begin until they're all
     
present.
     
Come to work in your pajamas.
     
 Put a picture of your mother on your business card.
     
 Find out where your boss shops and buy exactly the same outfits. Always
wear them one day after your boss does. (This is especially effective if 
your boss is a different gender than you are.)
     
Make up nicknames for all your coworkers and refer to them only by these
names. "That's a good point Sparky."
    
 "No I'm sorry I'm going to have to disagree with you there, Chachi."
    
 Suggest that beer be put in the soda machine.
     
 Include a piece of your children's artwork as a cover page for all
reports
that you write. (If you don't have children, draw stick figures 
yourself.)
     
 Schedule meetings for 4:14 pm.
    
 Encourage your colleagues to join you in a little synchronized chair 
 dancing.
     
 Agree to organize the company Christmas party. Hold it at McDonald's
Playland. Charge everyone $15 each.
    
 Send email to the rest of the company telling them what you're doing.
For
example "If anyone needs me I'll be in the bathroom."
     
 No matter what anyone asks you, reply "Okay."
     
 Put your garbage can on your desk. Label it "IN."
    
 Plant a hedge around your cubicle.
     
 Grow mold in your coffee cup.
     
 Build models of the Seven Wonders of the World using empty soda cans.
     
 Put on your headphones on whenever the boss comes into the office. Talk
in
a loud voice. Remove your headphones when he or she leaves.
     
 When in conversation, no matter where you are in the office, mutter, "I
think my phone is ringing" and leave. Go get a coffee.
     
Determine how many cups of coffee is "too many."
     
 Develop an unnatural fear of staplers.
     
 Compose all your e-mail in rhyming couplets.
     
Install a set of buttons and lights in the arm of your chair. Talk into
your daytimer.
     
 "Hi-lite" your shoes. Tell people that you haven't lost your shoes since
you did this.
     
 Organize a carpool. Go to pick everyone up in a taxi.
     
 Email nude gifs (graphic image files) of yourself to your coworkers.
Tell
them you got them off the Internet.
     
 Hang mistletoe over your desk.
    
 Include a personal note on every email you send. "On a personal note,
I'm
feeling a bit tired and grumpy
today."
"On a personal note, I'm pleased to announce that I got my highest score 
ever on Tetris last night."
     
 Bring in dishes that you tried to cook but didn't turn out quite right
as
special treats for your co-workers.
     
 While sitting at your desk, soak your fingers in "Palmolive".
     
 Put up mosquito netting around your cubicle.
     
Decorate your office with pictures of Cindy Brady and Danny Partridge.
Try to pass them off as your children.
     
For a relaxing break, get away from it all with a mask and snorkel in the
fish tank. If no one notices, take out your snorkel and see how many you 
can catch in your mouth.
     
Send e-mail messages saying free pizza, free donuts etc... in the
lunchroom, when people complain that there was none... Just lean back, 
pat your stomach, and say, "Oh you've got to be faster than that."
     
 See how long it takes until the last person stops believing you. Then
start planting pizzas.
     
Put decaf in the coffeemaker for 3 weeks. Once everyone has gotten over
their caffeine addictions, switch to espresso.
     
When you go to a party at somebody's house, don't automatically assume
that the drinks are free. Ask, and ask often.

We agree. Warm and fuzzy feelings suck. Especially when put in
poetry form.

This is NRR, by the way...

Yeah ...warm fuzzys are bad...and things that are bad are not nice.
Seems like everywhere you turn these sunny summer dayz you find
warm fuzzys...i remember  "back in the day" when you had angry grumpy
people all over the place and when you turned on your computer
there was more angry grumpy flame wars...but not anymore...
all you get now is warm fuzzy hugs when you log on...i dont
know what has gotten into kids these dayz...must be that loud
techo music they listen to...

 I am going to Thrill Kill Cult from Danville tomorrow but have to go to the
City at 5:00pm. I will hang out at Starlight until concert time. By the way
when does the concert start? It is at the Troc isn't it? What is the address
of the Troc?

I seem to have *ahem* misplaced the old mailings and have no idea who on
 this list was planning to go to the Thrill Kill Kult concert on Wednesday.
 So Speak Up!

Subject: need help setting up lighting system
Sender: sfraves-owner@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

I have an 8,000 sq ft house in the East Bay. I want to set up a lighting
system for in home rave type parties. I am looking for the effect of Release
or Universe. Are there techno music lighing consultants out there? I have the
American DJ lighting catalog but I have no idea where to start? Please help.
How do you synchronize the lasers and lights to the music? I have a killer
sound system already.

Hello everyone,
        A friend of mine recently let me play with his turntables and I'm
hooked on mixing! I've tried posting for help concerning turntables not too
long ago but it seems to have gotten filtered out. Anyhow, I'm trying to
get myself a pair of used Techinics 1200mkII's and a mixer. Where should I
be looking and does anyone have suggestions for good but not too expensive
mixers?
        I noticed that someone else recently inquired the list for anyone
selling their equipment. If anyone is planning on selling stuff, please
e-mail me at <avalyn@uclink4.berkeley.edu> or leave a message at (510)
704-1385. Thanks!

Ai

people all over the place and when you turned on your computer
there was more angry grumpy flame wars...but not anymore... 
all you get now is warm fuzzy hugs when you log on...i dont

There is another fantastic Jungle DJ who is pretty much on the down low...
and is better well known back east....  JOHNSIN.... I don't mean to keep
bringing this guy up, but I just wanted to.... because he's really
talented... there are a lot of talented DJs who just haven't put the
effort to get caught up in the MACHINE... :-)

For every 1 Dj that makes it there are 10 that are better and just don't
know the right people.. just like musicians...

Here are my favorite DJs... (5)

1. Dutch (I really like trance)
2. DJ DAN (Needs to explanation)
3. Cesar (Pronounced: say-zar... not SEE-ZER... I learned this little tid
bit from his Girlfriend who was at Mirasol supporting her extremely
talented DJ main squeeze... :-) I love his techno! So smooth and sharp. )
4. Apollo (Communique Minneapolis)
5. *too many to name*

Not that it's too related.. but my favorite non electronic music artists
are:

1) Sade 2) George Michael and 3) Simply Red and almost all 80s british
pop!... (Wham!)


see you in the 9th dimension,

Byroni

This bothers me, because there are a lot of good jungle djays in the bay..
But due to lame scene politics of the scene many are never heard here and
have to play in far away places to get any respect.. For instance.. Please
read the following message that was posted on MW-RAVES about my set at
Further when I had to fill in for Ed Rush, Trace, and Nico because they
missed their flight.

---->
im -still- ranting and raving about this mans set...
i try and explain it to ppl who didnt hear it...
but my words just dont seem to express it correctly...
i pity each and every one of you who missed it...  ;)
it changed me.
only on a few vary rare occasions have i felt like this.
especially from a dj set.
richie (stairway) and dieselboy (looking glass) are it.
but then johnsin (furthur) falls next in line.
johnsin?  whos johnsin?  that guy from massive?
yeah...
i trancended...  like the musik is sposed to make you do.
and then, i came back...  when he was all done...
a changed man...
the musik.  the people gathering and filling the tent.
the lighters.  the insane group screams.  and group hugs.
oh...  the group hugs!  yes!
hundreds of ppl in the main tent for johnsins dark stuff,
hundreds of ppl i dont know at all, dancing near +
with them, and feeling the bass make our hearts skip,
waiting for the breakdowns and the explosions,
and literally losing our shit when they hit,
freaking out, jumping up and down, running around crazy,
and on many occasions i found myself in the midst of super big group hugs
just as the bass would drop or the shit would get intense...  there was
-unity- and -love- and -resepct- on the floor that night.  all to a sound
track of dark step and tech step jungle...  it aint evil...  its
driving...  a force that makes you move...  not only physically...  but
mentally and emotionally, as well...

thanks johnsin!

all yall --- get on the 'bandwagon'

*hugs.n.breakbeats*
JAWSH!
east.side.crack...
--->

My set is being compared to Richie Fucking Hawtin and Dieselboy, and the
sad fact is, I can hardly get a gig in the Bay area because of the BASS
Crew monopoly and over all politics in the scene.. (as with Thad, the Bass
Crew doesn't like me.. but I hear about it endlessly since my GF is one of
the founders I never stop hearing about it.. GOd kill me and end the
suffering now..

I have much respect for Rinse.. He is a new kid that can mix better then
everyone on this great top ten you have posted.  But I am sad to say you
are hyping a lot of people that just dent the scene and are very oblivious
of it in many ways.  Phantom 45 of Chicago is America's number one DJ of
Drum n Bass.  Hands Down.. No arguement..I quote stareyes when we spun a
club together in Milwaukee last week, "Shit, Brian is better then most UK
DJ's" Yet most of these kids you listed besides Vivian Stareyes (who is
down wit the scene globaly and not just locally) had never heard of
Phantom.. And are really not that interested in bringing him out.. I wonder
why.. It might shed some light on who's really who in the jungle scene.

Look farther then your bay area.. and perhaps look a little deeper with
what you are offered.  A healthy scene is one that has a lot of new people
spinning within it.. NOt the same people for the last 3 years..

Starting this thursday space children will be having a party every
thusrday night
at 520 bryant. This space used to be a big rave space until
it was "removed" because of abuse...ie graffiti etc.

The club has now given the rave scene another chance.
This thusrday is the opening night and it is free.
 
Jonas, cesar and graeme are the djs plus gabe real and abstract
upstairs.

The party is called space odyssey...the flyer looks like the cover from
the space odyssey book.

Info line is 415.273.1633

10 pm -4:20 pm
18+ w/ id  

see you all there

><{{{"> foolish fish <"}}}><.

ps....I hope to have a flyer there for the art party also...which is in 
no way connected to space children btw.

Ok. I had to comment on this, 'cause I was there. My head was in blissful
union with a bass cabinet for a fucking *intense* forty-five minutes under
the aegis of one Johnsin. It was, straight-up, religious. I have never
percieved/recieved music in this manner; of such magnitude. Techstep. In
the house. Kids going ballistic. Rolling  sub-bass everywhere, handed down
with ferocious mixing. The surrounding blast radius of the soundsystem was,
in fact,  drenched in the most driving and energetic drum n' bass I have
ever heard. Simply awesome. And the other 200 or so kids did, in fact,
think so too...

Much respect. That was one of *those* moments. And I didn't happen to be
under any other influences than music at that particular moment...  Get his
tape people.

-Joshua

It doesn't seem that Wish is happening tonight (that's what is says on

Hey everyone,

Just got a fax in from The Mining Company, a new site located in
Florida. 

They state: " Guides such as Hyperreal (http://hyperreal.com) have their
place on the web as a stockhold of rave-culture information, but as the
years have passed, the links have become outdated, broken, or
inconsistent. This is where we come in. We present the latest
information for those new and old to the rave culture, as well as links
to other sites that present techno related subjects as they are
happening. We all know this is a fast paced culture that thrives on
change, and we are here to meet the challenge."

Decide for yourself:  http://ravehousetech.miningco.com

later...

Jonas

Hey y'all!

Flux and Rinse will be out tonite, laying down some smooth, rollin' Drum
'n Bass.

No, this isn't Audio Impact, but another venture since we're struggling
to find a consistent 18+ venue.

The management is being super cool with us, so there'll be no cover.
Also, they like giving away snacks during the night, so there'll be
something to soak up your suds.

We'll be going from 9p to 2a. For those of you who missed out on the
tapes, we'll have some available at the door.

For more info, call the BASS Kru voicemail: 415-332-5800 ext. 24-7

Hope to see some of you there!

21+ w/ ID (sorry, but I tired and tried and tried, but they wouldn't
budge!)
278 11th @ Folsom St.
9p-2a
Free!

Adios!

Jonas

Hi!  ]=)

 The only dance club of note (if that is what you are seeking) is the 
Blue Lagoon just down the street from the Catalyst. They usually have 
house and/or techno going most nights. Best to call and see what is up 
with 'em.

 You can try going to Capricorn Records or Ion Excange for more local info.

 Hope this helps!

So here's a question...

Why is the SF jungle scene so competitive? All kinds of namecalling and
dissing, beyond the normal shit talking that occurs in any group.

Jungle isn't about Peace Love and Unity.. its about dealing with everyday
life, that is why jungle is not really "in" the rave scene in anyway..
Jungle has its roots in the rave scene but the feeling and over all
attitude in Jungle is completely opposite then the rave scene.  The rave
scene wants to escape, the jungle scene wants to cope.. thats the best way
I can describe it.  You can see this in the drug usage.  Within the jungle
scene using drugs other then cess is very looked down upon.. I can't really
explain it, you just have to live it.

Jungle has a high testostorone level.. ;)

heheh
thats all I can say.. You really got to know your shit, or you get cut down.

i have to agree with joe here.  I just think that there's no need to
put anyone down on this list.  IMO it just makes the person that is
doing the putting down look bad.  Whether or not i think that u have
some valid points i still look down on u for putting someone down in a
forum like this.  For me, the personality of the dj is as important as
his skills, and when u go dissing ppl. like this it makes me wonder
about your personality.  I'm not flaming anyone here...just wondering
why there is a need to put ppl. down?

Hello Sfraves,

	We are proud to announce the arrival of our next three t-shirt designs...
They are currently available @ "Solid Grooves" in San Jose; "Housewares"
and "Faster Bamboo" in San Francisco; and "The Trance and Jungle Factory"
in Berkeley.

	They are pretty dope, so check em out!!! Also, we will someday have our
web page up, but for now it is pretty dismal. But you just wait!!! We will
have something to show you soon! I promise!

Peace and love,

Greg =)

C-ya @ Freaky People!

Hi, fellow Joe!  :)  
Glad u liked it!  If u want another one, just e-mail me. This goes for any
of you, k?  (Next time I'll punch holes in the end for string or
something...)

Anawayz,
I just have to add my own comments to the barrage of warmth 2 reviews,
sorry it's a bit l8... (Man, I've had a busy week so far!)  
A few things:

Rob, your opening live stuff was COOL!  It took me on a great little
mind-journey in the chill-room!  Along with the KIIILLER visuals (awesome 
work Ran and folx!), I tripped out naturally for about 2 hours before I
knew what happened!!  

Micron, that's the first time I've ever been able to catch your set, and
it ROCKED!  'Veray naahce...'

So many SFRavers there!!  My God!  So cool to see more folx I hadn't 
met yet!  :)  (There are so many, but I'm still terrible with remembering
names, tho...) Thanx Orson, for the sweet new laminate! You're too
cool...;)  
I wish I hadn't needed 2 go so early, but we had a TON of stuff 2 get  
done Sunday, so we *had* to truck on back to Davis a little bit after the
fuzz-oids arrived.  Would've *loved* to stick around, though; that
parachute-fan-trick over the folks crashed out in the chill-room looked
sooo phun!  :)

Well, I too will be heading back to the southern end of this bad-ass state
in just a few short weeks, so I just wanted to thank all of you for
leaving me with so many of those wonderful warm feelings of love, openness
and connectedness that this fantastic SF community so freely shares
together.  THANKS!!! =)

Hugz 2u all!
-=Joe H=-

Any "rave" site who's mission statement includes slamming another site, is
immediately suspect in my book, cynic that I am. 

Then we go to the site and what do we see? Well besides the ads, the first
article is about MTV. Hmm, can you say "corporate sponsored site?" I
thought you could...

Yeah... what are they thinking, trying to compare themselves to a volunteer
run site built and maintained by people who love the music and the scene?
When you browse through Hyperreal, you know the people involved are doing
it for the right reasons.  This site just looks like a big advertisement.
When you look deeper, it has almost NO relation to the form, function, or
purpose of Hyperreal other than the "techno/rave" subject.

Not to mention that they are linking to a bunch of other sites inside their
frames and presenting it as their own content...... lowdown web practice in
anyone's book.  Use that target=_top tag, matey!

Interesting that rave culture is a big enough blip to warrant a guide on
their site, but it doesn't appear that they're looking at it from the
inside.

        I don't know, but I think it has something to do with there not
being very many jungle DJ's in SF as opposed to other Trance-style DJ's. So
maybe the scene became really competitive. I spin jungle and I can't get to
spin anywhere except at my friend's parties. So I just decided to spin for
myself and forget about the whole scene here, because it is a little viscous
for me.

        I know what you're saying, but it's not like that for every jungle
DJ. It's your particular style. Some jungle is very mellow, and jazzstep and
intelligent jungle don't really give me this feeling you describe as much as
hardstep and other types do. I like to spin the really hip-hoppy ghettoy
stuff and most of my friends here who listen to trance don't really like it.
But they do like other jungle, and some of it does fit into the rave scene.

        but yes, it does have a higher testostorone level than most trance...

It seems to me that some of the ferocity in the *jungle scene* that has come to light today has
been on a very individual level.  John was talking about the evil politics inside the scene, and I have no doubts about that truth.  Cuz I mean, C.R.E.A.M. rite?  But I think that a lot of what was said could have been refrazed in a much more positive light.  None of this YOURE WRONG IM RIGHT bizness.  Every last junglist ive played with has been cool on the up and up.  It just seems like every other scene, youre gonna have your Grouch right? Thats just my take on it.  You got cool cool heads and youve got badseeds.

Peace
<meeks>

any junglists every wanna get
 together an spin something email me!

Ouch.  Well, if you can't get noticed by having good content or design,
maybe dropping a few names will help.  At least they haven't run a robot
on our site and slapped their logo on it and called it theirs, as one
other site did.  

On the other hand, if hyperreal did take advertising....

O.K., I was looking at some old BSP's and I found one talking about the
party ALICE IN WONDERLAND.  This party looks super dope.  The only thing
I need to know that I currently don't have access to is an idea of where
I can buy tickets for this party if pre-party tickets are actually on
sale.

Any answer to this question would be much appreciated.  While your at it,
tell me who is going or not.  I'd love to see more faces there like I did
at Warmth.

sorry, this made me cackle uncontrollably while i "work" in the
air-conditioned splendour of a cubicled office building in Bangalore India,
the quiet sari-clad women and button-up-shirt men in the cubes nearby are
shooting strange glances at me, wondering why i'm laughing like this while
staring at my screen. ah, the forbidden pleasures of e-mail!  damn, i could
swear this funky tale happened to me last time i took public transpo in
bangalore's teeming streets...

I think it's fair to say that we've all had our fair share of
unsavoury public transport experiences.

In my teenage days taking the last Glen Waverley train home I
witnessed some acts of misbehaviour that'd straighten your pubes.
One time a pair of drunken young louts couldn't contain their need to
urinate so while one guy held the automatic door open with his foot
the other pissed out of the speeding train.

This story does not end predictably with the urinator having his cock
slammed shut in the fast closing automatic doors;  his true buddy
(and I can't think of a better test of friendship) did manage to keep
the guillotine edged doors from his susceptible penis by holding back
that door handle with his extended leg.

In this instance I suppose you'd have to say that the sting to this
little outer suburban anecdote is that as our protagonist relieved
his bursting bladder with an extended pee his steady stream was
directed by the train's propulsion and the natural laws of physics to
reenter the cabin via the open slide windows that had hitherto been
refreshing the tired travellers on this warm summer night.

What this meant is that half a dozen unsuspecting commuters were
suddenly being rained on and it didn't take too long for them to
determine that the at first welcomed cool splash of invigorating
liquid was in fact the urine of a drunken lout and that there was no
end in sight of this impressive curved stream he was remorselessly
pumping out by the luke warm litre.

Now if that torrid tale of true travel was a tad repulsive imagine my
perverse fascination with the following true life experience from
just last week recounted to me by my friend and first hand witness
Clarissa.
As was her normal routine Clarissa was on her way home from work on a
crowded peak hour tram.  She was lucky enough to secure a seat and
proceeded to read a book and ignore the distasteful world around her,
as you do.

A short while into her journey Clarissa was distracted from her
reading by an especially repugnant odour.  A mixture of stale vomit,
week old dried urine, fermented body odour and unformed stool
samples, this was pretty much the stink combo platter.

The offending odour was permeating from a silver bearded dread-locked
wino who was cut a clear path through the busy tram as commuters bent
themselves into pretzel shapes to avoid bodily contact with the
walking shitbag.  Every person on that tram was aware of this
repugnant man and not even the feral tram conductor was willing to
approach the sweaty bum to ask for his fare.

Now as everyone was slamming their noses into their own armpits to
avoid the rank stench of this stumbling drunkard one solitary lady
was oblivious to the wretched goings on about her.

This young bussinesswoman was feeling the strain of an arduous days
work in the corporate office and had been swayed into a blissful
state of somnambulant day dreamage by the rhythmic motion of the slow
moving tram.
Nodding peacefully this unsuspecting sleeping beauty evidenced her
proper upbringing by keeping her legs crossed and her hands clasped
and if it weren't for her angelic eyes being closed you'd never know
she was away in her own little world.

Our smelly wino happened to be hovering above this sleeping sweetie
when he was taken by a deep and resonant coughing fit which caused
his aged and blackened emphsyemic smoker's lungs to contract and
squeeze out what can only be described as a monumental thick
globulous ball of phlegm, a classic gorbie, it was a chunk of gooey
green lung matter an Ethiopian family could live off for a month.

As this stinking walking street refuse hocked up this gigantic gorbie
the entire tram reeled in horror and one gentleman even extended his
monogrammed handkerchief willing to sacrifice it to this fountain of
sickening splutter for the greater good.

Alas the offer came too late and that memorable green golf ball of
phlegm could not be contained.  Like a freed parrot this gorbie flew
from the scabbed lips of its drunken originator bypassing the
coagulated drool of the flea ridden beard and spun in the air as if
in slow motion end-over-end like a Martian high diver as the
assembled tram travellers watched repulsed, but spell-bound by the
sailing hunk of disgarded inner waste which was truly so loathsome as
to not even belong in the body of this human septic tank.

There was a jaw dropping eerie silence as that gorbie finally came to
rest viewed by more people than the entire audience of Water Rats.
It landed with an audible slap, but by the very nature of its
grotesque constituent elements it stuck heartily to the
surface.....the surface of the sleeping businesswoman's right hand!

Clarissa was mortified, but surpressed her natural desire to throw up
because she was unselfishly more worried about the dozing lady.  When
she finally woke up and spotted that green hunk of wino mucus resting
on the back of her hand there was a good chance she might just have a
heart attack and die.

This however was not the case.  When the tram pulled up promptly at
the next set of traffic lights the sudden halting of it's soothing
motion awoke our snoozing heroine who politely ran her tongue over
her lips before opening her tired eyes.  The first thing she saw when
she opened those bashful eyes was the gargantuan gorbie and she was
visibly startled.

But then as every person ,except the stinking bum lurching above her,
had their eyes glued sympathetically to this unfortunate innocent she
sheepishly yet casually raised her hand to her mouth and licked off
and then swallowed the entire green spongy mass of phlegm mistakenly
assuming that it had trickled from her own divine lips as she slept.

At this point the tram's silence turned to boisterous uproar and
Clarissa just made it off the tram at the next unscheduled stop in
time to vomit at the base of a small flowering tree.

Dear fellow SFR's

I meant to do this a while ago, but here it is, I wanted to give Micron props
for spinning in oregon during the cloud factory camping trip. First yes, this
is the same Micron (Dan Capriles) who head is growing by the second. On the
saturday of Memorial day weekend be was at the Feel Good party, after
finishing his set at FG he spun with Andy W at the Charity party. I guess he
wasnt tired so he decided to join us up in Oregon, where we had been partying
since the day before. that night (sunday) hopefully after some rest following
a 10 hr drive and two parties he spun a wicked set for us crazies in oregon.
Yes that is right 3 parties in 24 hours in two states. Now i call that
dedicated, don't you ? Doesn't seem so big anymore huh guys?

much love big hugs

So I was reading Inter@Active Week, an industry trade mag, and found out
that "the Mining Company" (the company that did that web site that was 
touted as the "new Hyperreal") is a new commercial web directory project
started by an ex-exec from Prodigy (the online service, not the band).

The are advertising supported, and are basically trying to become a player
in the navigation/search engine industry -- they're going after the likes

Here's the story on tickets!



Ticket will be on sale this weekend at solid grooves in san jose, and
(hopefully) at faster bamboo in SF. 

The stores are charging an extra dollar service charge. this is out of
our control, but people who buy presales will:

1. Not have to bring a canned food donation or any donation to the
berkley CCC.

2. Be treated to breakfast (alice in wonderland pankakes)

3. Be the envy of all their friends.


Breakfast will also be served to annyone who comes dressed as a
charachter from the movie!


for info on where to get tickets, just call 415-370-8399. all the
directions, etc, should be posted this saturday.




I'll resend a BSP for everyone in a few...


We're really excited about this (our first party), and we've been
pumping loads of extra good energy into it! I hope to see everyone
there smiling, and making new friends! 




Andrew

finals) all week and we need some hard-core luvin'. Please E-mail me 
back and tell us wassssup.

	love, eeeean

(Also, love to all youz Auburn ravers we hooked up with a while back: 
Tara, Toni, Cass and crowd.)

I was only able to stay till about 1:30 so i didn't get the full effect. 
but from what i heard of simon, it was good.  The highlight of the
evening was when Jeno came on.  He played some music that I almost want
to call experimental.  It was  a wierd swing kinda song.   don't get me
wrong when it broke it broke into slammin' house glory. but it was
something different for sure. then he played some chicago tracks that i
like. in particular on of the new guidance records.  wish i could have
stayed,  when i left there was a fat line.

I left the flier at home so I can't remember the details, but yes 
it's tonite, and I'm pretty sure it's at the Trocadero at 4th and 
Bryant. I forget who was spinning, but as I recall the lineup looked 
pretty good, and it's free!

Enjoy!

   Old Mother Hubbard
Went to the cupboard,
To feTHC her poor dog a bone;
But when she came there
The cupboard was bare
And so the poor dog had none.
   She went to the baker's
To buy him some bread;
But when she came back
The poor dog was dead.
   She went to the undertaker's
To buy him a coffin;
But when she came back 
The poor dog was laughing.
   She took a clean dish
To get him some tripe;
But when she came back
He was smoking a pipe.
   She went to the alehouse
To get him some beer;
But when she came back
The dog was in good cheer.
   She went to the tavern
For wine white and red;
But when she came back
The dog stood on his head.
   She went to the fruiterer's
To buy him some fruit;
But when she came back
He was playing the flute.
   She went to the tailors
To buy him a coat;
But when she came back
He was riding a goat.
   She went to the hatter's
To buy him a hat; 
But when she came back
He was feeding the cat.
   She went to the barber's
To buy him a wig;
But when she came back
He was dancing a jig.
   She went to the cobbler's
To buy him some shoes;
But when she came back
He was reading the newes.
   She went to the seamstress
To buy him some linen;
But when she came back
The dog was a-spinnin'.
   She went to the hosier's
To buy him some hose;
But when she came back
He was dressed in his clothes.
   The dame made a curtsey
The dog made a bow;
The dame said, "Your servent,"
The dog said, "Bow-wow!"

Here's a challenge for you all!  There's a great thread going around 
NYC-Raves right now on "blasts from the pasts" - memories of early 
parties!  So come on, SFR, let's get nostalgic :)

PS Yes, I subbed to NYC to check on the scene there   - the list is very low 
traffic, and so far a lot of it is advertisements :(  I guess SFR is one 
of a kind, huh??

PPS Netiquette alert: I got her permission before posting this.

Subject: Re: (nyc) BLASTS FROM THE PAST

ok, these are a couple of early memories from way before i was even 
"going out", but i guess i was just testing the waters.

I'd been living in NYC less than a week (freshman year of college)
It was September 6th, 1992, Memorial Day Weekend.  And I picked up a 
flyer for Alan Sanctuary's PRIMAL party @ Chase Bar on 3rd Ave.  Now 
it's called Bar None, I believe.  The dj's were to my recollection, 
Denard, Mr. Kleen, and some others.  It was a pre-Wigstock party too.  
I think it was like $4 w/ a flyer for 2 people.  I went with some 
other NYU kids who were new to New York, and we really didnt' know 
what to expect.  We paid our money at the door, and the music was in 
the back room.  I think we arrived around 11pm or so?  Anyway, I 
didn't know the difference between techno, trance, breaks, house, 
whatever, I just remember the music was VERY FAST & VERY LOUD! There 
were these scantilly clad dancers on stages, and everyone seemed to 
have whistles.  I remember a bunch of small psychadelic visual screens 
set up too.  There was supposed to be a smart bar, but the room that 
it was in was decorated in tons of day-glow paint, with a bunch of 
people just sitting around drinking and smoking weed.
I remember it was so hot in there it was almost unbareable!  We danced 
for ahwile,and then somone brought me a club-soda from the bar up 
front.  Everyone was very colorfully dressed and very friendly but i 
really didn't make any new friends, I guess because I was a little 
scared.(small town girl on her 1st big night out in nyc)
When we left around 4am the front room was packed with people watching 
b&w porno movies. We headed back to our dorm, not quite sure of what 
we had just came from.  On our way out we picked up flyers for NASA, 
Communion, and maybe Disco 2000?
Anyway, when i finally got to bed at like 5am, I slept for like 15 
hours and when I woke up I had a fever of 104, double strep throat 
infection, double sinus infection, was completely dehydrated, and had 
mono.  I was really sick for like 2 months and i lost like 
15-20lbs!!!!  I had no idea what happened.  I had never been that sick 
b4!  I'm still convinced to this day, I somehow took a drug 
unknowingly at the party and totally put my system out of whack.

But stupid & young as i was, even though sick as a dog, I went to NASA 
the following Friday.  I still have the flyer it's a pink triangle and 
it folds out so you can read the dj's/times/etc...  I'll have to look 
at it to tell you who spun, but I think it was Mr. Kleen, Moby, and 
maybe Jason Jinx.  That place was even stranger than Primal.  Lot's 
more people.  We kind of wondered around for a few hours, danced a 
little,and went home really early.  I remember I did have a lot of 
fun, even though I was way too sick to be out at a club.  I remember 
thinking people danced really weird.  And the lights were blinding 
enough to make my eyes water.

ok. those are my earliest "rave" stories.

Golly,

Maybe you should start up a list for people who are just in the know... I
always thought they were saying 'sinse' on those Cypress Hill records
(which would be short for sinsemilla), but I guess I'm wrong again.  Maybe
someday I'll get tough and mean like those jungle DJ's I like...

;)

I'm honestly confused how Jungle could be Massive if the scene is as
combative as you say.  I'd rather sort people out by who I like and who
I don't, who I respect and who I don't, and DJ's out by which one's make
me groove and which ones don't.  By the way, from what I've seen of the
jungle scene, it's diverse, positive, and about getting away from the
generic dance identity and some of the cliches it's fostered.  I'd like
to see this list and scene more supportive of jungle in general.  The only
part of the jungle scene that I've seen be competitive is the DJs who are
trying their asses off getting jungle into 'other' parties in general.
We've seen some progress from Stareyes, ReAch, Science, Siphon, Thad,
Mudfoot, Radon, Gamecat, and a slew of  others who have been doing a kick
ass job of expanding the scene.  Not coincedentally, they all maintain a
lot of connection outside of the form of music they choose to play.

Let's keep it Unified. We can't afford the various aspects of our scene
competing over venues, permits, crowds, etc.  We need to exercise our
sense of unity.  I've heard advocates of Jungle say that it's the
TRUE underground, or the next wave or whatever... well there's
Chemical Brothers and Underworld style issues in Jungleville as
well... Jungle is in the same trouble the rest of the scene is...
Bjork does jungle, and so does David Bowie.  If we present together as
family, we have strength, but as segregated scenes, we have only temporary
victories and soon, a degree of animosity and possesiveness between each
other.

Saying which Jungle DJs are the ones to definitely take notice of is kinda
unfair... seeing as the D&B/Jungle scene has grown vast enough to cover a
good deal of territory in taste, skills and style. It's gone past skills
now, to a point of individual taste (i.e. an art subject to taste as
opposed to a science subject to analysis).

See You All At the Beats Party Saturday...
I'll be there going off to my favorite music: diverse melting pot o'love
And my favorite DJs: People who love to spin the records they have
gathered for us, in the best way they know how.

Peace,
AndyW

I hate hip-hop :P.

And yeah, I didn't know what it meant either, but then I am a dumb foreigner.

And on the other hand I hear all these harsh word about Johnsin, and
although maybe he comes across that way, I had a pleasure of meeting him
(he introduced me to one of my fav DJ because he heard I liked him a lot),
and he seems really nice.  Maybe I am being all subjective because if it
wasn't for him I wouldn't know this DJ, but my first impression wasn't bad
:).  And some of the stuff he says...  well, it's just different
prospective, but to me it sounds honest at least.  Is it better to be
honest and sometimes rude, or dishonestly PLURy???

Well, here's my take on the characteristics of 3 RR Mailing Lists.
Netiquette: Please note your CC list when replying...
---

Well, Southern Cal Raves is very high traffic. A good handful of posts
every one or two hours at high tide. Right now its primarily NRR posts.
Few Advertisements lately. Too many random posts for my tastes. Seems a
lot more decentralized from a core group of posters than when I initialy
joined. The seemingly SCR Roll Calling phenomenon is annoying.

Arizona Raves is very low traffic, very intimate, a good handful of
messages per day, much like how SCR was 6 months ago. NRR Forwards
currently okay and welcome. Someone subbed AZR to a joke mailing list =)
Fun to the a lister on. Very welcoming.

San Francisco Raves (IMO) is very high traffic. Large traffic on reviews
of recent events. Primarily RR posts with various NRR forwards. Lots of
vibe. SFR tends to promote use of aliases and ASCII-graphics sig files.

Yes, I sub to three RR lists =) 
...Not to mention about 5 other lists

PLUR! =)

Inklings of the Future...
Los Angeles, late '89.  I'm a hip-hop mama at the time, going to 
mainstream clubs wearing spandex (oh yes).  One weekend we are hanging 
out at an apartment near USC and someone there says they know of a 
"party" nearby.  We drive to a pretty abandoned area of downtown, walk 
down alleyways littered with winos until we come to a big, dark building 
resonating with pulsating beats.  We get onto one of those platform-only 
elevators and go up a few stories, and it all seems pretty sketchy to 
me.  There to greet us is someone who says it costs $10 to get in.  We 
all laugh and offer $10 for the five of us, which he agrees to.  

Inside is a small crowd, about a hundred people.  Very early minimal 
techno is being spun.  Very early minimal single fractals are projected 
onto the walls.  It is dark.  I ask someone where the keg is, and they 
look at me strangely and say "there won't be any alcohol here."  I think, 
"$10 and no alcohol?  What a gip!!"  But people are friendly and we stay 
and dance for an hour or two, before heading back to get stoned and pass 
out.  

I forget all about this night as just another random weekend night, until
I'm seduced into the rave scene years later, and suddenly realize that I 
must have been at one of the very first raves in this country!

early memories for me were Mr. Floppys, the stone the first recycle
with Kyle and laurie. The second New years gathering ever way back in
90,91 not sure. A rave called sharon, getdown parties, old comunity
parties before malachie got hurt. Fool Moon Elmo line and parties.
Universal groove. Pull my finger, The First Funky TeKno at the
concourse. And my all time favorite who can forget the parties at 16
and harrison Jimmy and wallys place!!!

Love,
Macadio  BTW there are a lot more parties just cant remember

Chris (Sunny) of Solle Clothing and Pablo's Sugar Shack at VSF sent this
"feeler" to me about a free pre-rave meeting place for ravers every 
Saturday night at VSF, with dj's.  I think it sounds like a great idea, but 
because I'm outtie soon, I can't host it (though I would have loved to!)

It is true that VSF now is house and pretty mainstream, but read his 
message before you dismiss this.

So SFR, please read this and see what you all think, and respond to Chris.

Hey Nancy-

As you probably already know I throw a party called Pablos Sugar 
Shack weekly every Saturday night at VSF (11th & Folsom) in SF.  I am 
toying with the idea of offering up my back room to SFRavers/ravers as 
a pre-party/rave stop.  My back room fits about 200 people and is 
outfitted with its own soundsystem, DJ coffin, etc.  Since on Saturday 
night the club really doesnt get goin until midnight I came up with 
this idea as it would provide a weekly meeting place to get a groove 
on before you move on, and to hook-up rides etc.  Right now the place 
is empty until around 12:30 a.m.  The idea as I see it would be to 
feature a lesser known (no offense) SFRaves community DJ weekly (or a 
couple) in the back room and have dollar drafts/drink specials goin 
and Id waive the cover charge for ravers before say 11 pm.  Ill 
benefit because while its not gonna make me rich in fact it may cost 
me, it will get people in the club earlier and give the place that vibe 
that I think is missing (one of our best parties is our monthly Funky 
Tekno Tribe afterparty).  Remember, at heart I am a raver not a 
clubber, I swear! Anyway, I need someone to help me kick off/host the 
night.  You, Leslie, a DJ like Macadio came to mind. Right now all I 
can offer to the Djs/host is free drinks and a free forum play in 
public and pre-party place for ravers. 

Let me know your thoughts, etc.

the new years gathering!!! that rocked.....

some of my fav's were the 1st and second freedom party's out at the
racetrack.  Candyland...WAAAY back when...it was at a drive in movie
theater and the after party was at thunder bay.  i was turned on to a
bunch of new ideas and experiences that night.

i hate to sound nostalgic...but i miss my innocence...i liked being
clue-less...made it more exciting.

The vibe party's at the stone...were some of the best "smaller"
party's.  Charter Oaks...tell me if anyone remembers this place??

I really didn't have that much fun at the first FTT at the concourse. 
I even had a few fun times at the end-up...like in '91.

My friend's mom says that place way way way back in the day, was a place
for plays n' stuff- Haze Theater.  Someone confirm? 

I liked that place a lot because of the consistent parties that went off,
but sometimes there were some weird vibes and weird things happening, when
not all of three rooms were opened.

Hey hey hey

I've been looking forward to _Wonderland_ for over a month now!

I want to see all you sfravers in full effect!  I haven't met any of you yet 
(shoulda went to warmth) and I'd better that night!  Or else I'll litter the 
list with warm fuzzys, flames, and assorted nrr!  (j/k)

I'm trying to hook myself up w/ a laminate . . . if I don't just remember to 
look for the light-skinned black chica, probably wearing ponytails . . . or 
maybe I'll come dressed up as Alice!

P.S.  one more time--where's the party at this Friday, Sac ravers?!?

O.K., I was looking at some old BSP's and I found one talking about the
party ALICE IN WONDERLAND.  This party looks super dope.  The only thing
I need to know that I currently don't have access to is an idea of where
I can buy tickets for this party if pre-party tickets are actually on
sale.

Any answer to this question would be much appreciated.  While your at it,
tell me who is going or not.  I'd love to see more faces there like I did
at Warmth.

<<Jungle isn't about Peace Love and Unity.. its about dealing with everyday

life, that is why jungle is not really "in" the rave scene in anyway..

Sweeping generalizations aside, what makes you think that you can speak for
an entire music genre/movement when you say that "Jungle isnt about Peace and
Unity", that "jungle is not really 'in' the rave scene anyway," and that "the
feeling and over all attitude in Jungle is completely opposite than the rave
scene." If Goldie was the one who made that post I'd be more apt to accept
that but....


>>The rave scene wants to escape, the jungle scene wants to cope.. thats the
best way I can describe it.  You can see this in the drug usage.<<

 If you think that Jungle/D&B isnt just as much about escapism, you are
sorely mistaken. It's music, which is at some level entertainment. You listen
to it in part because you want to be entertained. Entertainment is something
we use to escape from the daily pressures and stresses of life.  I understand
your implication though; raver kids do a lot of drugs, so they want to
escape. Poor logic becuase it by no means accounts for the many other reasons
why people both do drugs and go to parties.  

>>I can't really explain it, you just have to live it.<<

Give me a break. Like the people who are responsible for producing anything
other 




than Jungle and Hip-Hop can't "live it" either? Talk to people like Glenn
Underground from Chicago, Carl Craig, Mad Mike of UR and although he may
outwardly deny it, Alan Oldham from Detroit. These people "live it" at least
as much as anyone I see in any other music scene.


>>Within the jungle scene using drugs other then cess is very looked down
upon..<<

A friend of mine who is the marketing/advertising director at URB magazine
down in LA told a story recently about the Sunday night D&B club that URB is
throwing. He said that when a very well known UK Jungle DJ came and played at
the club, at one point he leaned over to pick up something he dropped and a
crack rock and pipe fell out of his front shirt pocket. This bloke then
proceeded to play it off by simply asking my friend for a light.  Drug use
other that Weed is looked down upon? Please...


>>Jungle has a high testostorone level.. <<
I'm sure people like Stareyes, Bonnie,  Kemistry & Storm and certainly DJ Rap
would disagree with you.


>>thats all I can say.. You really got to know your shit, or you get cut
down.<<

Precisely.

I started out on the East Coast.  The very first party I went to was on
a Thursday night, in Baltimore Maryland.  It was called "Orbit."  I drove
three hours each way from New Jersey for this, and went to work as usual 
the day after.  I was pretty wowed, especially that people were having so
much fun without getting drunk off their asses. (June 1992)

Two years -- and MANY parties -- later, I visited San Francisco for the first
time.  The first party I went to here was a "Your Sister's House," which
was held in some art gallery where there were lots of dildos on the wall.
It was also my first DJ gig in San Francisco.  I met SOOOOOO many nice people.
And funny, it was also a Thursday night :-) (August 1993)

Five months later I moved to San Francisco.  The first party I went to
was "The Blue Cube," held at this guy Steve's house in Noe Valley.  He
had soundproofed his garage with egg foam and you name it...there were two
or three "Blue Cube" parties, which eventually evolved into what became
"Friends and Family."  Steve is a sound engineer, and pressed my DJ set
to CD :-)  Anyway, it was amazing how much energy was packed into that
garage -- and that the neighbors didn't complain! (January 1994)

Meeemmmmmmories....light the corners of my mind......misty water colored
memmmmmmorrrieeeesss...of the way we raved......

Sigh.

So are you saying it's hard to become a Jungle DJ?

I find it rather easy. It's totally easier to spin jungle instead of house.
Yea, yea.. It gets alittle complicated at times matching the beats but. You
don't even need a talent for matching beats to be a good, creative jungle
DJ. Or so it seems.

The only thing I hate about mixing jungle though...Running out of records.
What was this whole thread about anyways?

Oh.
Jeff here.

I think this would be sooooooooo KEWL!.....  Imagine finally meeting all the sfravers, and going with them to the party... Just thinking of the Vibes gives me tingling feelings inside... I think we should definetly use this opportunity... 
All we need right now is somebody to host it... anybody wants to do it? I haven't seen any posts responding to this mail.. I guess everybody is still talking about SF Jungle battle and all that stuff (here I go using this word stuff again=) ) So come on guys, this is our chance to have our own SFRAVES meeting place....

And another thing, when is the "ALICE IN WONDERLAND" going to be, is it this weekend? Please let me know... Everybody is interested in this party, and so am I, and plus it will give me a chance to meet more of you..... =)

I guess the my question is, what responsibilities are included in *hosting* this preparty?
I dont know im up to the task..but It would be good to have that out in the open so that
everyone even slightly interested knows whats up.

Ding!  Those were the best house parties I've ever been to, with the
possible exception of New Year's Eve at the Resort around that time.  I
went to several massives around that time but I don't feel nostalgic for them.

How about Planet 6 at Burning Man in 1993, when "rave camp" was one 14-foot
U-Haul with the DJ inside?  We were dancing, and someone came up to me and
said "Dude, you have to try this.  Close your eyes and start running."  So
I did, and after a few seconds of panic I felt like I was floating in the
void...you can't do that anywhere but the playa.

I still remember holding hands around the dying fire while waiting for the
sun to come up...there were only three of us left, but the DJ was still
spinning his beautiful mellow ambient set...then the fire died and we
watched the sun rise while cuddling under a blanket.  It was the most
beautiful sunrise I have experienced, and I regret losing track of the
people I shared it with.

Yeah, I remember riding my dinosaur to a few dank old caves in the first
metallysurgic phase of the neolithic era. Back then we wore big animal
skins. so I walk in wearing my baggy mammoth-trunk-trousers, and it had
been a rough day as they have the tendency to chaff a bit unless you get
the expensive shaved mammoth-trunk trousers, which i couldn't afford at the
time. if you came in wearing a regular old bear skin, people just wouldn't
talk to you and would assume you were some kind of neanderthal. when you
first get in the cave, you first notice this fire and a mirror projecting
the images of amoebas and primitive multicellular organisms in this glass
plate going sploimp and splork and squick to the beat. sometimes they'd
rise up from the projection system, mutated by the wicked sounds&beats, the
sweat, and the BO, and become a new species. This usually looked pretty
cool on the projection screen. the sounds were incredibly organic
techno. Back then, you'd loop the roar of a t-rex for the bass-line, line
up a bunch of tortoises and hit their shells with a mallet for the rhythm,
and that rhythmic 303 wail was being done by a group of trained bats that
were tied into a DJ coffin while being skillfully taunted into squeaking
with tasty morsels of food. Being PLUR meant you stopped dragging people
around by the hair and stealing their food for an hour because you were too
busy dancing and didn't want to spoil the vibe with survival traits (well
at least that hasn't changed). Best of all, were the "no clubbing people"
signs. Ahh, those were the days. Hell, you kids have it easy.

Hi!  ]=)

 The only dance club of note (if that is what you are seeking) is the 
Blue Lagoon just down the street from the Catalyst. They usually have 
house and/or techno going most nights. Best to call and see what is up 
with 'em.

 You can try going to Capricorn Records or Ion Excange for more local info.

 Hope this helps!

 i learned about cess while living in St. Louis, MO... n don't forget your
Redman, Wu-Tang, etc... etc... etc... even KRS-One has made refs to it 
in lyrics... 

maybe Hyperreal could start a DnB mailing list?  or have they already?

someone posted something about Jungle already being used by pop artists,
heres my 2 cess (hehehehe):
Jungle's gonna be a qwik 'flash in the pan' as far as pop
culture goes, but because it already has a MASSIVE and loyal
group of fans in the underground, it will stay around in the underground...
in fact, most of the original Jungle folks have moved on, creating
almost every _____Step imaginable.... 
and if it continues to be an influence on mass culture, all the cooler...
it shows most that people aren't as dumb as they sometimes apear.
and as for bjork using it, do you know who she's married to?

I don't usually chime in, but I'm with Monty on this.  Jungle long ago
stopped being what any one group thought it should be, as the interview
with LTJ Bukem in the new Muzik and the last chapter or two of the new
book "Altered State" (which I definitely recommend) would indicate.
And as the book indicates, Kemistry and Storm were in the jungle scene
from the very beginning, along with Fabio, Grooverider, Dego and Mark Mac
and quite a few others.  Junglists tried hard to protect the scene when
it was small and fragile and avoid some of the mistakes of the predecessor
house and techno scenes, but success breeds contradictions, that's for
sure.  Certain people in the jungle/d&b scene attempt to erect the
barricades with a lot of talk about how tough they are, but frankly, 
jungle turned away from the no-one-harder approach to things years ago
(though there is still some tough-business stuff in its composition today)
and as a result *grew dramatically* in its musical scope and accomplishment.
Otherwise all the tracks coming out now would still be full of gunfire
and "booyaka booyaka."  

Jungle comes from the depressed areas of the UK, especially the east end
of London, and it reflects that reality.  But like all great musical
styles it has gone well beyond that.  If people want to copy the speech
patterns and clothing style and street toughness of that area in order
to be "true junglists," well, that's just a bit sad isn't it?  I'd
rather address it on its own terms musically.  The cultural background is
important too, but it's hardly an excuse to create some kind of zone of
exclusivity around it.  

I've been playing jungle since 1994, it's just damn *good* and a real
breath of fresh air after the staleness that's overtaken house and techno
alike.  More recently, jungle and d&b have gotten into a few ruts too,
but that always happens.  The last couple of months have been better for
innovators in the style, from the stuff I'm hearing.  There will always
be temptation to copy the regional chauvinism that has depressed hip-hop
(and slowed down its evolution drastically, I might add) over the last
decade.  But jungle has already shown its potential to cross over the
increasingly rigid boundaries of dance music audiences, and even to the
"overground" -- I heard the Logical Progression CD when I was eating dinner
at Pomodoro on 9th & Irving last month.  Some people see this as selling
out.  There will be some of that, the music industry engulfs everything
that grows, to some degree.  

So the answer, as always, is to go deeper when that happens.  The brilliance
of house, for a while at least, was that it did so *inclusively*.  I would
hate to see jungle limited in its potential simply because its adherents
put up some kind of be-cool test that outsiders have to pass.  

I'm off da soapbox now . . .

Do you guys remmeber song by Joane Ozborne  (The chick with curly hair, and a fake nose ring?) "If the god was one of us"  Well here is another version of that song:


Enjoy it...

Alik aka Earthlyn

P>S> God I'm in a goooood moood..... Anybody wants a massage?  =)

LOVE to all of you...

smoke up, smoke up..... =)

 
 What If God Smoked Cannabis?
 
 If God had a long hair, and a goatee
 And if his eyes were pretty glazed
 If He looked spaced out would you buy His story
 Would you believe he had an eye infection? 
 And yeah, yeah, God looks baked
 And yeah, yeah God smells good
 Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah
 What if God smoked Cannabis?
 Hit the bong like some of us?
 Drove a tie dyed microbus
 And He subscribes to Rolling Stone

 When God made this place, in the beginning
 Did He plant any seeds?
 Or did He put them there for Adam & Eve?
 So they'd be hungry for the apple that the snake
 Was always offerin'
 
 And Yeah, Yeah, God rolls great
 And Yeah, Yeah, God smells good, 
 Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah
 What if God smoked Cannabis?
 Do you s'pose he had a buzz
 When he made the Platypus
 Does He like Pearl Jam or the Stones
 And do you think He rolls His own?
 Up there in Heaven on the throne.
 
 And when the saints go marching home,
 Maybe He sits and smokes a bone.

Sorry, but you're wrong. HAving spun house/techno for a couple years 
before d'nb I can tell you it's much harder to find records that work 
together. Granted, the mixing style is a lot more open: you can mix 
smooth like Bukem or scratch and cut...or all of the above. The problem 
is that b/c it's so new to these parts (relatively) a lot of dj's havent 
really developed their styles yet. It takes time. 

But I'd definately have to say that beat mathicng it important no matter 
which style you play.

So I was reading Inter@Active Week, an industry trade mag, and found out
that "the Mining Company" (the company that did that web site that was 
touted as the "new Hyperreal") is a new commercial web directory project
started by an ex-exec from Prodigy (the online service, not the band).

The are advertising supported, and are basically trying to become a player
in the navigation/search engine industry -- they're going after the likes

maaaaan macadio, you're bringing it back with 16th and harrison! 
stevenson alley, the acme parties! remember when we used to go to 
parties and with your admission you'd get a hit of e? some of the 
biggest horse pill looking things... i honestly can't say that i 
remember when my first party was... i remember it being in san jose in 
a big ole wherehouse.. yep, this was before the police caught on to 
raves.. i was a youngin', maybe 14, and it was scary to me... guess 
i've grown up! =) and everything was sooooo CHEAP! i still remember 
those $2-5 parties! but i'm not getting all "those were the days" 
because i love where the scene is right now, and i can't wait to see 
where it's going! =) 

                                         much love,
                                 anissa, princess of the universe!

Big mixup on Wed. everyone. Turns out, the managment flaked on us, so
nothing happened.

Sorry for the confusion for those who came down. We'll make sure things

>Hi allzs, has anyone heard of "theTechnoQueen" MARUSHA???

Yes sir, she has released two albums (that I know of...). 
Her first was called "Raveland", and that's the one that has "Somewhere
over the Rainbow" on it. It also has classics such as "It Takes Me Away"
(her first single if I'm not mistaken), and "Girl I House You". Her next
album, "Wir", is the better of the two. Not as poppy as the first one,
lots of house-influences, and also some heavy techno-beats. Tracks to
listen for include "Deep", "Secret", and "Unique".

>in any case...does anyone know what techno-music genre artists like
>Marusha, Scooter, Gompie, N-Trance, etc fall under???? these are mainly
>European techno peoples but what kind of techno do they play?

Well, in Europe this goes under EURODISNEY...I mean EURODISCO. And I would
assume that this name would work even in the US. =)

I was wondering if anyone out there had received the email that is circulating 
about Pink Floyd's Dark Side Of The Moon and The Wizard Of Oz.  I haven't seen 
the message myself, but I've heard about it...  Anyone have this?

i'd like to get all the DJ's (and even those who just spin for whatever 
reason!) opinions of this.
do you think its easier to spin sumthin' with that 4/4 beat or breakbeats?? 
(we'll include jungle w/breaks since a lot of jungle's beats are hard and 
fast breakbeats)
i'm just curious cuz i'm just starting to learn to spin and the first thing 
i'm doin' when i get out to the bay area is gettin' me a pair of 1200s!! :)
no, i'm not going to learn how to spin whatever easiest if that's what yur 
thinkin! ;P 

keep the vibe

I find it rather easy. It's totally easier to spin jungle instead of house. 
Yea, yea.. It gets alittle complicated at times matching the beats but. You 
don't even need a talent for matching beats to be a good, creative jungle 
DJ. Or so it seems.

This is what I got.....

Put on the video of "The Wizard of Oz".  Once the M.G.M. lion roars for
the third time, start Pink Floyd's "Dark Side of the Moon" CD (it has to
be the CD). Turn the TV volume all the way down and the cd volume all the
way up, sit back, and ENJOY THE SHOW, MAN!  Remember to start the cd RIGHT
AFTER the lion roars for the third time.  You can either set the cd on
continual repeat OR after it runs ALL THE WAY THROUGH (to the end of the
heart beat), you can replace it with "Wish You Were Here" and start it
when the Tin man starts to faint (in the scene when he's first
discovered).  THEN, once that runs out, replace it with "Meddle" starting
with track 2.

Make sure that you've used the bathroom, everyone is focused, and you're
in a subjective state of mind, if you know what I mean.

For more information, see the web page.  Go to Yahoo! Choose "weekly
picks" at the bottom of the page, and there will be a link to the
"Synchronicity Archive".


Could be interesting ;)

I think it's easier to spin stuff that has a constant 4/4 beat than something
syncopated (breakbeat/Jungle).  I also think it's easier to spin something
that runs around 135-145 BPM (techno/trance) than 118-130 (house/garage).  
When the records are faster, it's easier to correct when they start slipping
out of phase.

But maybe I just think this because that is what I spin?  And maybe the
person who thinks Jungle is the easiest said so because it is the easiest
for him?  Everyone has their own reaction to the music, as a musician, DJ,
dancer, or listener.

Does anyone remember the "Do not st in the Furniture" parties, or Glass
House?  What about ToonTown or Carefree?The ney years eve ToonTown at
the fashion center after the Nirvanah concert was incredible....Did
anybody go, it was back in 9O or 91?  What about Rave called Sharon -
devotion in Tracy, all the parties at the Truckadero. Juice &
Cosmofunkagroveathon 1 & 2 ( the first ever party at marina skate, mike
rosenburg and Josh).  Many were at dv8, and at one of them they blocked
of the entire parking lot in back and set up a sound system and bouncy
castles with visuals).  how about: Higidy Pigidy & Where the wild things
Are  1 & 2 (mark sabotnik) or dj bucks Church every sunday night at dv8,
Thursday Night Osmisis at dv8, the ryder truck Gathering at the pier
warehouse 5 blocks from the potrero hill police station?  Even Felix
parties (formerly FTT) were cool, i remeber the one at dome romanian
wall on divisidero, were DJ Dan played for the first time in SF (thats
when he used to spell his name DeeJay Dan).  The very first basix at the
art studio next to townsend.  wicked fool moon at gray whale cove, and
all other fool moon parties when wicked still was part of the sceene. 
The destiny and exuinox parties... they werew incredible!  and of course
don't forget the very firts CASPER holoween colaberation with Rave
called Sharon on marin st of south 3rd.  That was an incredible event, i
sould know, I Organized IT!  And what about the very first CoolWorlds,
man those parteis were good, and the first Cyberfest in that 30 acre
field at 4th and chanel next to the china basin building....That was not
just an incredible event, but a mile stone in san francisco dance
history! Anyone remeber Warpfactor X, with the hologram sticker flyer in
91, We brought out Franki Bones for the first time to the west coast for
that one....That party truly went off!!!!!  what about The X Men
adventures party, I know there must be some oldtimers that remeber this
one?  Tuesday night together in the basement of bigheart city, wed night
housing project at the endup, the first gathering at the location were
the sound factory was built.  Club Liquid in the basement of the
maritime hall!  Many raves were held there!  DNA sunday mornings for
Rebirth and Afterlife!  Sunday Nights at Mission Rock for Mallikies
Unity Parties, and after that SunDayZ @ 444 Deharo with resident dj Ray
Vonie (A club I used to put on) way before spunday was around.  Weres
Waldo on the Hornblower santa rosa, and the one at the airfield in
sancarlos in the hanger...back when the hardkiss brotheres used to throw
parties.  I remeber some of them were at THUNDER BAY in berkeley, Anyone
remeber the Aligator Bar? 808 State played at one of them.  How about
Love American style, with Roland, or small world and Elmo parties (now
we are getting into the 16th and Harison days). Wally world, Power, and
Massive Culture in livermore.   Im sure that many of you remeber the
first Harmony at the Brookdale Lodge.  And there have been so many other
great parties, but I can't even remeber them all, so i will stop
remenising right now.

Shit I could go on Forever, But im geting all choked up, so I'll just
stop now cause its kinda making me emotional.  This seen has seen 8
generations of raving in 6 years.  Im glad to have been a part of it.

Anyways, then was then, and Now Is Now.

Hm. I find that the slower a track is, the easier it is to mix.  If you put
on 2 gabba records, they are WAY harder to keep "on" than two house
records. That's part of where different music styles lean toward different
mixing styles...  Jungle is pretty high up on the BPM counter. I find
jungle/fast-techno to be FAR more challenging than mixing house. Mixing
house/garage, or even dubby stuff (90-110) you can line it up and then go
the bathroom, and they'll still be on. =p

that's sooo funny that u say that about a 4/4 beat AND about 130-140
bpm
music.  I play a lot of trance and a lot of it is really full, i.e. a
lot of stuff going on and i find (of course) that it is the HARDEST to
spin.  I pulled out a bunch of my old house records last night that
have a pretty straight 4/4 beat and range 120-130 bpm and i couldn't
believe how easy it was for me to spin them. I also find that
breakbeats and D&B are the easiest for me to spin.  That's why when i
first started spinning i loved to spin breaks, they were the one thing
i could actually (well most of the time) beatmatch.  Synchopated
rhythms with that nice hi-hat seem easy to line up.

what's everyone else's experiences???

To disclaim, I will say that I am a baby.  I will never stop believing
that I'm new to everything, for fear that I'll stop learning.  As far as
my life is concerned, being comfortable with something means losing
interest...I need that Golden Cow of Herb off in the distance somewhere, a
treasure chest and the end of an invisible rainbow.  If I know something
too well, I need to make it more complicated somehow, or else life becomes
routine.

SO ANYWAYS.

I think that this junglist versus stereotype 'raver' string is
fascinating, and it perfectly sums up several things that I see in the
dance music scene, as well as things I see about the Bay Area.

More or less, my belief is that as far as music goes, as far as LIFE
itself goes in the Bay Area, every artist, every fan, every dancer, every
interested party has a million hands in a million pockets.  The Bay Area
is the land of stylistic collision and that's what makes it so incredible
here.  Hiphop crews that are blackwhitemexicantonganicelandicjewish, and
don't mind.  House DJ's who have alter-egos spinning noisecore thranky
skrash music.  And a dog named Boo.

What I'm saying is that 'ravers' can talk about PLUR, and many can
genuinely mean it.  On the other hand, many can just be bighead 'gimme
some ass' dudes who want to hug/dip as many women as they can, like this
was Saturday Night Fever, while they talk about PLUR.

At the same time, many junglists can walk around with the gas-face on all
day, thinking that for shit to be real inna jungle, you have to be from
grit, of grit.  For some, jungle is definitely the music of the angry and
the oppressed, etc etc.  At the same time, there are other junglistas who
are just blowing their whistles and hugging each other and putting
themselves on vibrato at the very sound of jungle, the very sight of
people getting deep into it.

So there is crossover, and there must be.  It cracks me up, it literally
makes me GUFFAW, when I read these posts that seem to be checklists for
being a legitimate X Y or Z.  I don't mean to be giving advice that no one
asked for, but, my friends, let go of category.  Forget about 'being
real.'  Avoid the Noid.  Fuck the Man.  But please....this is our little
Bay, our nook of Mother Earth, and we have it real real extra good here.

And guess what? we can have it all, every which way, or we can have just a
piece, a bit that we throw all our love into...

But what we can't have is an idea that there is some ineffable DO THIS
DON'T DO THAT force out there that separates us while binding us together
in cliques. What we live in the Bay for is the chance to not adhere to the
styles of today, but rather to be ourselves, and clash with our friends
like we clash with our clothes.  And still be bloody gorgeous.


Now, get me the hell out the pulpit, before I hurt myself.

MAX...SAGA1

Yeah, I find that beat-matching is easier at hight speeds (though with 
d'nb I often match on the half-beat) however, beat matching and mixing 
are not the same. You can beat match but that doesn't mean your plates 
go well together.

I am exactly like you... Trance and really quick stuff (140+) give me 
a little trouble, have to pay a whole lot more attention than somehing 
down in the 120's, especially if it has breakbeats(the easiest for 
me)...  
Breaks are the easiest for me to correct, it they need it at all...
But correcting something 150+, still to tecnical for me to hit every 
time.... But maybe I just need more practice.. who knows..

Hey everybody.  This is kinda tangent, and maybe a little understood.
But arent most breaks (all the ones I think ive incountered) syncopated
in 4/4?  Are we saying 4/4 as in quarter note heaven? Thump-thump-thump-thump?
As far as beatmatching goes, it seems like the steadiness of a real basic four makes 
it easy to get the timing right..but some songs get to the point where you cant find the one.
This is where I see jungle makes up for its complexity (as far as beatmatching) in that
there is allways a one. Boom tap...and so on..even if it takes 2 bars or so to get back to it.

since ive been bsing all this music theory ish...
does anyone know a good URL For basic music theory? Im gonna do some hunting..
but It seems like it would make all of us better if we understood the music we enjoy.

Thnks

I can beat match jungle easier than any other type of music.  It's faster,
so the beats are closer together and happen more frequenly, so it's easier
to monitor whether it's on or starting to get off.  House is slower so it
takes more time for the next beat to hit, thus allowing for more slipage of
the record.  My opinion of course.

I can't remember who subscribed to this school of thought, but I find any
thing faster than house easy to mix.  Music under 130 bpm to me just seems
to be harder to mix.  I have no problem doing it, but I find I'm able to
correct myself quicker when I'm playing faster music.

And with music theory, yes breakbeat and 4/4 are all relative.  If you've
ever have had to look at sheet music, you'll find that these two different
representation of beats (4/4 vs. breakbeat) all occur within the same music
structure of the measure.  Personally, I sometime like to mix both of these
together at the same time to get some really funky beats.

And who cannot forget those flyers from the parties back in the day?

All those symbols of animation characters, laundry detergents, and so so
much more that I cannot think up of at this moment...

Even the little flyers that were just plain and simple had parties that
just went off!
Great wallpaper for the room I might chime in!

I find downtempo easiest to mix - there's more time spent on each beat. =)

Ambient and ambient dub get a bit tricky as key tends to be important in
order to avoid nasty dissonance (unless that sort of tension is what you're
after)

House is generally pretty easy to beatmatch, with its standard off-beat
high hat. (I always find myself listening to high hats to beat match when I
can)

I find techno a bit more difficult than house, and many of the tracks are
meant more as tools, so you have the ability to end up utlilizing more
tracks and relying on combinations to create a flow.

Jungle can be tricky with it's syncopation, but it's not as narrowly
structured as house and techno (part of their ease - it's almost all 4 or 8
bar phrases), so being off within a phrase isn't always as noticeable. I've
found jungle lends itself well to cuts and shorter mixes.

Most importantly, the ease of mixing a style seems to depend mainly on the
depth of familiarity with it. The more listening and practicing, the easier
it seems to become. And beatmatching is just a basic component of mixing.
Programming's just as vital.

On a tangent - have any old schoolers heard any of the greats from the
disco era play? I assume there wasn't much beatmatching done, yet from what
I'm read there were some incredible vibes created.

I heard a trac on late night berkeley radio a few nights ago.

It was a recording of the landing of the eagle on the moon mixed 
with techo music. I think it was called "we have the technology"
Has anyone heard this or know the name of it or know where to 
get it?

thanks

When i first arrived i thought well its a good thing this is free because
that is what it is worth.

By midnight that had all changed and this turned out to be an incredibly
great party. 

Lots of happy satisfied people and great music... i really
liked when they mixed in pink floyds dark side of the moon.
(hint.. hint... to any djs reading this).
Im sure a lot of people now realize that the weekend now starts on
thursdaze.

have a fun and foolish weekend all.

Hey foolish fish,

Did you hear about the interaction between dark side of the 
moon and the Wizard of Oz (see the email below forwarded to me 
by a friend of mine)?  It stikes me this would be a really 
interesting thing to do at a rave like party with all the 
multimedia set up and people in the mood for such a bizzare 
experience.


You pointed out that:

Hey... 

We should try this one night after hitting the bars in the 
city.

__________________________________________________________

Call it Dark Side of the Rainbow. Classic rockers are buzzing 
about the
amazingly weird connections that leap off the screen when you 
play Pink
Floyd's "Dark Side of the Moon" as the soundtrack to "The 
Wizard of Oz."
It sounds wacky, but there really is a bizarre synchronization 
there.
The lyrics and music join in cosmic synch with the action, 
forming dozens
upon dozens of startling coincidences the kind that make you 
go "Oh wow,
man"
even if you haven't been near a bong in 20 years.
Consider these examples:
Floyd sings "the lunatic is on the grass" just as the 
Scarecrow begins
his floppy jig near a green lawn.  The line "got to keep the 
loonies on the
path" comes just before Dorothy and the Scarecrow start 
traipsing down
the Yellow Brick Road.
When deejay George Taylor Morris at WZLX-FM in Boston first 
mentioned
the phenom on the air six weeks ago, he touched off a frenzy.
"The phones just blew off the wall. It started on a Friday, 
and that
first weekend you couldn't get a copy of 'The Wizard of Oz' 
anywhere in
Boston," he said. "People were staying home to check it out."  
It's fun,
he said, because everyone knows the movie,and the album which 
spent a
record-busting 591 straight weeks on the Billboard charts can
be found in practically every record collection.
Dave Herman at WNEW-FM in New York mentioned the buzz a few 
weeks ago.
The response more than 2,000 letters was the biggest ever in 
the deejay's
25-year on-air career.
"It has been just unbelievable," said WNEW program director 
Mark
Chernoff. "I've never seen anything like this. "
The station plans to show the movie using the album as 
soundtrack at a
small private screening tomorrow.
Rock fans always have loved to speculate about hidden messages 
in their
favorite albums. But seeking connections between the beloved 
1939
classic kid flick and the legendary 1973 acid-rock album 
pushes he envelope
of
the music conspiracy genre.
Nobody from the publicity-shy band would comment, but Morris 
asked
keyboardist Richard Wright about it on the air last month. He 
looked
flummoxed and said he'd never heard of any intentional 
connections
between the movie and the album.
But the fans aren't convinced it's just a cosmic coincidence. 
"I'm a
musician myself and I know how hard it is just to write music, 
let alone
music choreographed to action," said drummer Alex Harm, of 
Lowell,
Mass.,who put up one of the two Internet web pages devoted to 
the
synchroneities. "To make it match up so well, you'd have to 
plan it."
Morris is convinced that ex-frontman Roger Waters planned the 
whole
thing without letting his fellow band members in on the 
secret.
"It's too close. It's just too close. Look at the song titles. 
Look at
the cover. There's something going on there," Morris said.
Here's how it works. You start the album at the exact moment 
when the
MGM lion finishes its third and last roar. It might take a few 
times to get
everything lined up just right.  Then, just sit back and 
watch. It'll
blow your mind, man.
During "Breathe," Dorothy teeters along a fence to the lyric: 
"balanced
on the biggest wave."  The Wicked Witch, in human form, first 
appears on
her bike at the same moment a burst of alarm bells sounds on 
the album.
During "Time," Dorothy breaks into a trot to the line: "no one 
told you
when to run."  When Dorothy leaves the fortuneteller to go 
back to her
farm, the album is playing: "home, home again."
Glinda, the cloyingly saccharine Good Witch of the North, 
appears in her
bubble just as the band sings: "Don't give me that do goody 
goody bull
 ---t."
A few minutes later, the Good Witch confronts the Wicked Witch 
as the
band sings, "And who knows which is which" (or is that "witch 
is witch"?).
The song "Brain Damage" starts about the same time as the 
Scarecrow
launches into "If I Only Had a Brain."
But it's not just the weird lyrical coincidences. Songs end 
when scenes
switch, and even the Munchkins' dancing is perfectly 
choreographed to
the song "Us and Them."
The phenomenon is at its most startling during the tornado 
scene, when
the wordless singing in "The Great Gig in the Sky" swells and 
recedes in
strikingly perfect time with the movie.
When Dorothy opens the door into Oz, the movie switches to 
rich color
and and that exact moment the album starts in with the 
tinkling cash
register sound effects from "Money."
Anyone who has ever nursed a hangover watchin MTV with the 
sound off and
the radio on can tell you how quick the brain is to turn music 
into a
soundtrack for pictures. But this is uncanny.
The real fanatics will point out that side one of the vinyl 
album is the
exact length of the black-and-white portion of the movie. And 
then
there's that iconic album cover, with its prism and rainbow 
echoing the
movie's famous black-and-white-into-color switch not to 
mention Judy
Garland's
classic first song.
The real clincher, though, the moment where even the most 
skeptical of
cynics has to utter a small "whoa!," comes at the end of the 
album,
which tails off with the insistent sound of a beating heart. 
What's
happening
on screen? Yep, you guessed it: Dorothy's got her ear to the 
Tin Man's
chest, listening for a heartbeat.
Maybe it's just a string of coincidences. Maybe the mind is 
just playing
some really cool tricks. Maybe some people just have waaaay 
too much
time on their hands.  Or maybe, as Pink Floyd sings to close 
out the album,
everything under the sun really is in tune.

Hey foolish fish,

Did you hear about this thing about the Dark Side of the Moon and 
The Wizard of Oz?  I think it would be amazing material for a 
multimedia mix at a rave.


..the amazingly weird connections that leap off the screen when you 
play Pink Floyd's "Dark Side of the Moon" as the soundtrack to "The 
Wizard of Oz."


It sounds wacky, but there really is a bizarre synchronization 
there.
The lyrics and music join in cosmic synch with the action, forming 
dozens
upon dozens of startling coincidences the kind that make you go 
"Oh wow,
man"
even if you haven't been near a bong in 20 years.
Consider these examples:
Floyd sings "the lunatic is on the grass" just as the Scarecrow 
begins
his floppy jig near a green lawn. The line "got to keep the 
loonies on the
path" comes just before Dorothy and the Scarecrow start traipsing 
down
the Yellow Brick Road.
When deejay George Taylor Morris at WZLX-FM in Boston first 
mentioned
the phenom on the air six weeks ago, he touched off a frenzy.
"The phones just blew off the wall. It started on a Friday, and 
that
first weekend you couldn't get a copy of 'The Wizard of Oz' 
anywhere in
Boston," he said. "People were staying home to check it out." It's 
fun,
he said, because everyone knows the movie,and the album which 
spent a
record-busting 591 straight weeks on the Billboard charts can
be found in practically every record collection.
Dave Herman at WNEW-FM in New York mentioned the buzz a few weeks 
ago.
The response more than 2,000 letters was the biggest ever in the 
deejay's
25-year on-air career.
"It has been just unbelievable," said WNEW program director Mark
Chernoff. "I've never seen anything like this. "
The station plans to show the movie using the album as soundtrack 
at a
small private screening tomorrow.
Rock fans always have loved to speculate about hidden messages in 
their
favorite albums. But seeking connections between the beloved 1939
classic kid flick and the legendary 1973 acid-rock album pushes he 
envelope
of
the music conspiracy genre.
Nobody from the publicity-shy band would comment, but Morris asked
keyboardist Richard Wright about it on the air last month. He 
looked
flummoxed and said he'd never heard of any intentional connections
between the movie and the album.
But the fans aren't convinced it's just a cosmic coincidence. "I'm 
a
musician myself and I know how hard it is just to write music, let 
alone
music choreographed to action," said drummer Alex Harm, of Lowell,
Mass.,who put up one of the two Internet web pages devoted to the
synchroneities. "To make it match up so well, you'd have to plan

the

i think mixing 4/4 tracky chicago style house is easier than mixing
breaks.
but why waste your money on records you won't want to play later.
you need to find the music you like 
any music you buy just to learn to spin will be a waste if it is not what
you want to play
it might be harder but you can learn with breakbeat
if thats your style you will need to figure out how to play it sometime
luckily for me i am deep into the vibe of house and that 4/4 beat makes
me feel good inside
so 
anyway
go buy some music that you like and that you would like to play (or hear
or whatever)
you will be glad you did later 
because instead of having a bunch of records that you want to sell back
to the store someday
you will have a bunch of classic hits!
good luck

Yep, the order of the records - what tracks flow with others, and which
match the mood of the party, and build upon that energy.

I've seen Grandmaster Flash spin, in the movie "Wild Style" and also in the
History of Rock and Roll PBS series last year... he claims to have created
the style employed my DJs like Q-bert, where he uses 2 copies of the same
song to loop one short section over and over.  Watching him spin, I believe
it.  The guy spins funk records with human musicians, so the beats aren't
at a constant tempo, and he still seems to beatmatch flawlessly, mixing
smoothly and also cutting and scratching, but always on-beat!

I read another interview once with a DJ from the 70's (maybe Tony
Humphries?), who claimed he was the first person to ever keep one song
going indefinitely using 2 copies... the song was "Night Fever" by the Bee
Gees.

On a more general note, anyone who wants to understand the possibilities of
jungle mixing should check out any of the "Drum and Bass Selection"
compilation series on Moonshine, especially #4 - a continuous mix by DJ
Hype.  Hype incorporates scratching, double copies, phasing and all kinds
of tricks into an exceptionally smooth mix.  I've never heard another
jungle DJ come close.

Keep it positive folks!

Being hungover at work has to be the worst thing in the world.  This 
morning was a lovely combination of pretending to work while my head was 
spinning and casually walking to the bathroom to discreetly throw-up.  
But the worse you feel the next day, probably the better night you had, 
right?! ;)

I love my friend Chris.  This is because we meet after work sometimes for 
"just a drink" to talk and catch up, and it usually turns into a 
whirlwind tour of bars and a parade of mixed drinks, and ends up in some 
dance club somewhere - and always on the worst of nights, the weeknight.  

Well, last night was no exception.  It started innocently enough with us
still in our work clothes having a beer with dinner.  Six hours later I
find myself shaking it at the Trocadero, still in the stupid office outfit
surrounded by ravers :)

This weekly has some promise, but its opening night was more of a 
whimper than a bang.  First, the location.  I've heard there's been good 
parties at the Troc, but its rocker/goth/industrial/club vibe kinda 
permeates the space and makes it somehow feel rather gamey.  Second, the 
space is too large for the sparse crowd of last night, making it appear 
to be dead even when the dancefloor was going off.  Also, there was 
nothing ravey about the set-up: it was merely some rave music being spun 
in a not very attractive club.

Add to this that industrial-sounding techno gives me an instant headache. 
My alcohol-laden brain fuzzily determined that Cesar was spinning when we
were there (1 to 3), but I am in no way sure of this.  After some
interminable clashing appliances sound, the music did get funkier in a
junglie way and those who were dancing were having a lot of fun. 

However, the fact that this was 18 and up, and is a potential weekly for 
_ravers_ makes it exciting.  I would just really like to see Space 
Children actually put some production into this, and see the rave family 
pack this joint.  We _could_ take over the Troc, but it didn't happen 
last night.

The most fun _I_ had last night was at Bruno's, where we talked our way 
in for free :).  This retro-swanky Mission place was all 
twenty-somethings done up in coolcat clothes and drinking martinis and a 
absolutely fantastic late-60's takeoff band called the Kinetics that just 
jammed.  Word to the wise: there are many scenes and cool things out 
there - don't get stuck in one place ;)

love you, Nancy

Lessons learned too late
Los Angeles, early '90's.  The rave scene is blowing up.  Summer of Love 
1992.  The music's called "Acid House" and people are actually breaking into 
unused warehouses to throw parties.  But I know nothing of this, except 
what I hear from the media.  The rave scene, I decide, fed on 
misinformation, is nothing but drugged-up teenagers listening to bad 
music.  I'm not interested in it, and neither are any of my friends.

Then one friend of a friend gets into it.  We tease him.  We call him "the
raver."  He tries to tell us, but we won't hear.  He tries to play
mixtapes for us, but it's just crashing noise to me - and much too loud. 
He finally convinces us one night to come out to a party.  We drive up in
two cars to the mappoint on Melrose.  The street is swarming with hundreds
of very trendy young teenagers.  Two try to sell us X as we sit in the
car.  I'm pretty turned off at this point and feeling justified in my 
anti-rave/techno prejudice, and when we find out the ticket is $20, we say 
fuck it and leave.

I didn't know then not to swallow the lies of the media.  I didn't know 
to approach everything with an open mind and heart and welcome what it 
may teach me.  I didn't know to how to create my own good time and 
contribute to the vibe, rather than having a "show me" attitude.  These 
lessons I would partially learn in the rave scene, but unfortunately, not 
for another few years.

For the people who want to get this going, send mail to Chris at 
solle@ix.netcom.com.  I can't organize it!  Thanks --

I haven't seen too much discussion on this, but folks, I think this might 
be a great opportunity to really get the SFR Family together and closer.  
A weekly hangout where we know we can go and see each other and hear 
music and for free.  :)

Done that :)...it's quite amusing I must say! Even more amuzing was when
I Watched it for the first time I had an Enya CD placed right after the
Pink floyd one and accidentaly let it run when the Floyd was finished. It
seemed to fit almost as well with the Floyd CD which me and my pals got
a big kick out of. It's definately one of those things you gotta do once...
supposedly it's better on drugs but I think either way it's pretty neat :)

 We wanted to go but my car broke down!  So, stayed home and watched
 movies...  Was 1015 Come-Unity?  If so, it'd be cool if you'd post a
 review to the list - that party hasn't been talked about in a _long_ time. 
 
 cya, N
 We went to the Starlight until 1:30 am. Then we went to the Trocadero until
it closed at 3:00am. Bondage A Go Go night!  Missed the Thrill Kill concert
but I heard it was packed and 100 degrees inside. Concert was good I was told
but very uncomfortable. 

We got to 1015 Folsom at 3:15am and it was packed. It was basically the same
format as Release on Saturday night. They only had two rooms going instead of
the five that Release has. Music was pretty much the same techno hip hop as
Release. Based on my limited experience the best combo pack in town on a
Saturday is DNA until midnight and then Release. I have yet to go to my first
Rave. I am hoping to go to the one in Santa Cruz this weekend. I am meeting
with Adam on Saturday to check out lighting for my own in home Raves. I have
an 8,000 sq ft house with a killer sound system ... ideal for small
gatherings of about 50 East Bayers.

 And who cannot forget those flyers from the parties back in the day?
 
 All those symbols of animation characters, laundry detergents, and so so
 much more that I cannot think up of at this moment...
 
 Even the little flyers that were just plain and simple had parties that
 just went off!
 Great wallpaper for the room I might chime in!

I personally don't find jungle that hard to mix; the stuff i've heard tends
to be a lot of slam/cut-mixing, as opposed to smooth fade mixing like you
hear w/ the best house DJ's. Maybe I haven't heard enough jungle DJ's, but
it seems like jungle is too "busy" when it's off chattering away to do a
long-slow mix. Usually there's a nice convenient intro/outro section of
most jungle tracks that is at 80BPM, then it launches into the 160BPM
chatter that sounds like you're fast-forwarding a CD... seems like the 80
BPM slow part is where people do the mix. Agree?? Disagree??

I'm not dissing Jungle -- it's just that I don't think it's that good to
dance to.

I noticed a while back that someone posted a tracklist of a DJ Dan tape
that included Bahia BLack's "Capitao do Aspholto" -- what I want to know is
how da hell he managed to mix in that highly syncopated track (brazilian
stylee) with other "dance tempo" choons.

PS: I'm Still in Bangalore India, where there doesn't seem to be much of
any kind of a scene at all, unless you count the car horns honking all
day/night and stifling snarl of constant traffic. And bars blasting
wretched top-100 "dance music"... This is the fastest growing city in all
of asia and all i can say is that "progress" ain't all that it's cracked up
to be. It would be nice to go find some rave in Goa, but nooo... here I am
on the other side of the world, and I even have to work saturdays (it's
saturday 10AM right now, even though it's friday night for you
all...). What, me frustrated?? Never!

PPS: I'm now playing the Josh/Simon tape of that 6-part
Malachy/Come/Unity benefit party at the richmond civic back in '93 --
and I have to say, this "classic" stuff seriously kicks ass over all
the newfangled tunes coming out nowadays. Best $25.00 I ever spent on 6
tapes!

I like both.  Also the brown ones, black ones.  Honey-colored ones.

French vanilla, butter pecan, chocolate deluxe, as Method Man would say.

When I was an RA at UCDavis, a group of my residents tried this out and 
claimed some odd relationships between the musical passages and parts of 
the film... the story goes something like this:
you put on T.W.o.Oz and start the PF rekkid at just the right moment and 
badda-bing!  There are these strange spots that happen to line up, like 
theres a shot of a bell ringing just as these bells start chiming on the 
rekkid and stuff like that...
I couldn't really stomach the thought of listening to two straight hours 
of Pink Floyd so I didn't try it myself...

It's easier to spin breaks!  Sounds better, too! :D

There's a group of Jungle DJs down here in SoCal land that call 
themselves the 119 guys or something like that.. They do all the 
scratching and double copies and phasing stuff, too.  Plus they are 
underground local-type folks.

I recall back in like 1994 when it seemd to me that there were all these 
kids going out and buying turntables and a box of GOA rekkids and BAMMO!  
they were DJs!  They didn't know anything about the music, the scene, how 
to fix their decks... BUT they were superstar DJs with that cool muzic 
that everyone wanted to hear.
I think that Jungle is rapidly becoming to 1997 what GOA was to 1994.  
Today everyone wants to be a junglist!  It's the cool new trend!  
Meanwhile the old skool jungle DJs just keep on spinnin.  
Who knows, maybe someday the cool thing will be breakbeat!  How happy 
would I be?!

        Yeah, jungle records go quick because they get boring really fast(at
least the ones I have). So it seems like you're always running out. My
problem is I get some of my records in my head as my favorites. So I always
feel like after I've gone through those I don't know where to go from there.

        well, I've tried both because I wanted my style to develop from just
days of hunting around record stores trying to find what sounded good to me.
I tried mixing both 4/4 and jungle and breaks and basically, any 4/4 is very
much easier than the others. Some jungle is hard because being a little off
can really mess up the way the drums sound, while in trance it just makes
the bass drum fatter. Plus, most trance and house songs are pretty much self
contained, not a whole lot of mixing is necessary to keep it interesting.
That's what I think, anyways.

        I think I've managed to find a cross-over. I just spin really silly
jungle with insane bass lines to keep everyone happy.

        it's weird that you say that because I come from a musical
background, playing lots of jazz and learning theory. After 4 years of jazz
guitar, bass, and trombone, all of the theory became pretty natural. So when
I started spinning I was initially drawn to it because I thought the idea of
making music with other people's music was so odd. So I guess I have a
really weird take on techno, as I can't really apply too much music theory
to it, but lots of other concepts like intensity and 'tranciness' that
really isn't dealt with in normal musical theory. It fascinates me still
that so much is known about how to make trippy records but there isn't too
much that could really be discussed about it.

        It's weird that you say that, because I rememeber when I first went
to a rave in Santa Cruz, probably back around '92, I remember not
understanding a thing at all about what was going on. It took place on the
bottom story of a parking structure, and cost like $7. So I was a little
hesitant, and I remember just agonizing at the pounding beats which were
absolute torture to my punk ears at the time. I remember leaving very early.
Luckily a few years later I discovered the Full Moons and other raves that
came near Santa Cruz. I think one problem is that when I first heard techno
stuff back in '89 or so it really was a whole lot different than what we
have today. My friend spun a set for me and some friends of old techno and I
remembered a lot of the songs and they were quite cheesy compared to what we
have today. Except maybe for current happy hardcore. That's got to be the
pinnacle of cheesiness.

        Well, it really is meant to be danced to half-time. Although you can
speed it up when it gets too intense. But the beat of most jungle really is
half-time with lots of snare and bass going on to make it seem faster. But
listen to the bass lines and other stuff, it's usually quite slow(as opposed
to hardcore where they will actually speed up samples = helium divas)

        I'll agree that it isn't as easy to dance to. But not good to dance
to? hmm..

I agree with Niels about the Come/Unity tape set.  As for jungle,
I've always thought it was pretty easy to mix, lots of things you
can do with the track structures -- it's more "open" than house
and less repetitive than a lot of techno and trance.  Layering
jungle tracks really adds punch to the mix if you get the right
ones.  Jungle's also the only style I ever use a cross-fader for
(unlike probably 90% of all DJs in my experience I just don't
use the crossfader).

I'll be playing tonight (Saturday) at the Cyberbuss block party 
which is going to be at Griffith between Quesada and Revere (off
3rd near 3C---, er, Candlestick).  Event starts at 10 and goes
to 6, admission is $10 I believe.  B))merang will also be playing
there both with his band (Hear Are the Facts You Requested) and as
DJ I believe.  it sez here "The Cyberbuss will set the atmosphere
for many artistic groups and individuals who take absurdity
extremely seriously . . . the Costume Ball will be held in the
Industrial Bayview Warehouse District of San Francisco where a
spontaneous combustion of rhythm, chaos, mayhem, herd morality
and creativity will arise from the urban decay to form freaky
fairy-tale like harmony."  That and a buck will get you a ride
on the 91 Owl around the City... :)  But seriously, or not, 
I think the idea is to get dressed up and get down with a
diverse crowd, bands, DJs, videos (including one I really want
to see of the Portland Santacon), and so on.

The Cyberbuss crew are active with Burning Man and other such
stuff, and participated recently in the 
Defenestration event with the Cacaphony Society and so on.

Check it out: http://www.cyberbuss.com

I won't be playing any standard house or techno, but my one and
only Coil record is in the bag . . .

Can you help me?

If you were planning a holiday in the US, but still wanted a bit of
clubbing action whilst you were travelling, where would you advise a London
clubber to head for?

I was working in SanFrancisco a few years back and the SFRAVE mailing list
saved my life:-) I would like to travel the US, but I'm going to plan
well..

My haunts are DiY @ essence in nottingham, Heavenly Social (Chemicals
brothers and the like), Ministry of Sound (garage and house) and I listen
to Kiss FM a bit when I cannot be bothered to go out..

If any of these names means anything to anybody, give me a mailback and let
me know what to head for and what Radio stations  play this sort of stuff:
deep house, chemical beats, garage...

Guaranteed London club advice offered in return...

E>What is the difference between white and yellow? Any preferances? Ennie
E>meenie minie mo?????

Well, white is generally accepted as a color representing purity,
cleanliness, a blank slate. White is the ultimate embodiment of the high
illumination levels of all colors on the visibile spectrum. True white
is compromised of all the colors in the light spectrum. True white can be
interpretted as having religious significance. Pure energy.

Yellow is not necessarily an aggression color, however it is a high
intensity color. If you're referring to H.I. Yellow (naturally). Or it can
be dull and energy-draining (darker, pale yellows) which function as
natural energy wells. Restaurants like McDonalds who use Yellow, Orange,
and Red theme colors do so because the presence of such high energy colors
has been proven scientifically to increase the customers desire to consume
food rapidly and leave quickly (thus allowing more customers to pass
through, thus more profit). Similar psychological effect as playing rock
music vs. say classical over dinner. Its Less filing vs. Tastes better.

PLUR!

Not to toot my own horn, but Ind BOTh house and Jungle easy to mix.  It's
all beats anyway and in reality you can find 4/4 in jungle easily.  Now I
will not go so far as to say hat one is easier than the other.  It ismostly
a matter of having ones ear on enough to hear the overriding or underlying
rhythm patternand syncing up.  I have made at this point, zens of tapes
where I go from a straight house 4/4 to a trippy jungle tune.  Now
admittedly this cannot be done wi all records, but enough as to make it not
so difficult as people may think.  It's all (record mixing) a matter of
finesse moreso than anything.

Funny littel story, ther is one DJ who prides himself on his skills, and
talks about it quite a bit.  Anyway this house maven said he could mix
anything.  I asked him to get out of his house set and move it to jungle.
The resulting train wreckage and total lack of syncopation casued much
laughter.  Then this DJ dissed jungle and said all that was needed was 4/4
to the floor anyway.  Weakling I thought ;).  When given two jungle records
that are relatively easy to mix, the DJ couldn't do that either.  This is a
person who's been spinning for at least 5 years now and can really play
some serious grooves.

One of the things I cannot do is play like a hip-hop DJ.  Very physical,
very in touch with the actual vinyl, a master at the crossfader w/ quick
cuts.  I cannot do that, I doubt I have what it takes to do it...but I'm
learning.  Anyway I learned to mix jungle since I did not have the skills
to do otherwise.  My only choice was to mix, and mix jungle I can do quite
well.

Cool shit that you can do with jungle that house cannot and will probably
neve touch:
-Jungle sounds good at 160 bpm or 80 bpm.  Look at the range in tempo you
can work with!  This is what makes it emminently easy to mix with house
music.
-Jungle is far more complex rhythmically than house, as such you can really
work the rhythms alot more than you can house.
-The emotional content in jungle is quite real.  In house, it is all a
setup.  There is an intensity to jungle that cannot be denied.  Perhaps due
to it's street origins.  You can work moods in more varied forms in jungle
than you can house.
-The music is just plain trippier.  House is just plain predictable.

House music has just stalled out.  There aren;t many good records, and the
beats, much like plenty of hip-hop sound very recycled and very little
innovation or pushing-up seems to be going on in house.  Lay down a 4/4,
hi-hat at appropriate places, a kick drum for punch, and you've got a
track.  A simple melody as theme, repeat, build, crescendo, resolution with
theme....The music was better a while back.


>I'm not dissing Jungle -- it's just that I don't think it's that good to
>dance to.

Agreed, but it is good to:
-Cure glaucoma by (read 420).
-Drink by.
-Socialize to.
-Most importantly, listen to!
-Dance to?  Well, only if it's the "right" jungle music.

House music all night long?  Nope, house music for the first 3/4, the rest,
I want to chill out with some trippy intelligent jungle.  Photek, Goldie,
Rabbit In The Moon, A Man Called Adam, A Guy Called Gerald, Decoder...now
that's innovative.

Just my .02,
John

Maybe wrong to you. But..

 To me. My spirit. And my soul...
 It is WAY easier. I can (and have) mixed jungle flawlessly "without"
headphones on.. =] And I have even matched jungle beats without headphones
on (call it luck? partially).
 For one. I have a talent for "predicting" music. But... Who needs it when
you can read between the grooves on the record?

 It's kind of cheesy but.. What I meant by it being easier.. For
like..People just starting out on the tables (like me)  With jungle.. You
can cheat (lack of better words)!
 Ok...You have one record playing a phat beat right. You see signs from the
grooves in the record that..There is an ambient part coming up without any
drums. You can see it on the record it self right.
 So all you do is.. Get another record. Adjust your tempo to desired
tastes.. And! It's this simple. Just time it. Start fading in an ambient
section of your second record with enough time left to where your first
record is going to break into it's ambient part before your second record
comes in with the drums.
 Make sence? And it sounds grrrreat!
 I don't know. All I know is that.. I want to be a great jungle DJ. And I
have the power within my own selfcomfidence to do it.
 But I was far from wrong stating that jungle can be alot easier to mix. =]

A while ago an old skooler complained(bragged?) about Raves not being 
what they used to be. And maybe that is true and maybe it isnt. Times 
change and so do peoples perceptions.

But what if they have? What if we keep recycling old ideas. Something 
Really Works so we bring that to the next production. Ad Infinitum.
The only thing that gets changed(religiously thank god) is the themes.

Anyway, it may be time to look to outside productions for new influences 
and 'fresh' ideas. Tonite is the CyberBus Ball, today and tomorrow is 
The "X" games at Pier 39. All summer long are Fairs and festivals. If 
you really cant live without Rave mussic maybe bring along a walkman. In 
fact a walkman might be a requirement. Sorta a filter. Like on a camera. 
"what does this picture look like with a filter?, how bout without?"

You could be standing at a dime toss at the fair, looking at the kooks 
trying to make a tv show out of dangerous sports, or watching people 
walk into the opera. Somewhere the idea that will freshen up the rave 
scene as we now know it will hit you! Hell even if all you get is a new 
idea for a prop, than your time was worth it.

Keep an eye out and dont be afraid to post what you see!

Warning!  Fairly long rant n' rave below.

While I agree with the broad sweep of John Lee's post, there's definitely 
a (IMHO) sense of generalisation.

> -The emotional content in jungle is quite real.  In house, it is all a
> setup.

Hmmmm...all records have to have emotional 'setup', no matter what the style.
The emotion isn't in the record, it's in you...it how you perceive the
record and how it affects you.  I've got some (what I consider) very
emotional house records...but they might just be emotional to me.   Then
again, I've also got some jungle records that have the same effect...
the knot in my gut/ache in my heart/throw me clear across the room
feeling I get every time I hear them (well, that's what it feels like to
me).

> There is an intensity to jungle that cannot be denied.
True...but again there can be an intensity to *all* forms of music.  Personally
I'm a huge Van Morrison fan (especially his old stuff) and I find his
music incredibly intense...it's more lyrically intense, but still... 

> Perhaps due
> to it's street origins.  You can work moods in more varied forms in jungle
> than you can house.

I really dislike this term 'street' when applied to music...all, *all*, all
music starts in the 'street'.  All of it.  Different people in different
places with different experiences and different ways of expressing that.
Music is fundamental to the soul (I know that's a sample from something, 
but I can't remember what).  If people creating new forms of music somehow
based on their experiences and emotions from their "environments" (for
want of a better word), isn't street, I don't know what is.  House may
have long ago become too popular to be really considered underground,
(especially compard to jungle), but jungle's going the same way.  In England
at Christmas there were already TV adverts with jungle soundtracks.  Does
this mean jungle is no longer street?

> -The music is just plain trippier.  House is just plain predictable.

BAD House music is predictable.  Bad Jungle is predictable.  Bad techno
is bloody predictable.  If, as you describe below, there's is no invention
in a record, no spark of creativity, then yes, it's going to be predictable.
This happens more and more as a type of music becomes popular.  The more
house/jungle records that are put out, the more likely it is that something
has already been done, and the harder it gets to put something truly
original out.  But, truly original stuff does still come out, it just
get harder to find.

There are plenty of good records out there, if not more than there
used to be.  BUT, there's even more really, really bad records out there,
which, as you say,  are totally recycled and not very interesting.
You say the music was better a while back, implying (as I understand it)
more variation in the music, but I believe part of the problem also
lies in people's classification of music having narrowed a lot more.

There was a post a couple of days ago about SF jungle dj's and what style 
they play.  There were (like) 10 different styles (most of which I know
nothing about)..and this is in jungle which hasn't really been around that
long.  For things to splinter so quickly is not a good thing.  Same with
all of it - garage, house, euro, hardcore, happy hardcore, trance, gabber and
on, and on, and on....One thing I really miss is Dj's playing ALL sorts of
records in a set...nowadays, it seems you get one type of music and one
type only from a dj/rave/club.  There's very little variety.  You may have a house room/jungle room etc...but why not have it all in one room?  If the scene
*is* about unity (supposedly) then why not have a night where the music starts
(say) with old disco/salsoul and gradually moves on to house, then techno
then jungle, then whatever AND THEN BACK AGAIN.  It all goes round..you
can trace the evolution of music and that is what I like to hear and I 
consider a really good dj to be one who can do that.  Who understands the
flow.  Who can teach about where it's coming from, where it's been and where
it's going (and usually as an extension where I'm coming from/been/going).
 Mixing is a bonus, but really *not* necessary (is that heresy?)


> House music all night long?  Nope, house music for the first 3/4, the rest,
> I want to chill out with some trippy intelligent jungle.  Photek, Goldie,
> Rabbit In The Moon, A Man Called Adam, A Guy Called Gerald, Decoder...now

Exactly my point.  In the beginning there was house? Nope, in the beginning
there was the blues (if you have to draw a line somewhere...)

> Just my .02,

And just mine, hope I didn't bore.
All comments appreciated,

I just wanted to clarify some things, if I may.

The purpose of my original statement was to show a tangible distinction
betwen the two styles.  Emotional content CAn be subjective, but my point
was some is more tangible than others.  For instance, the difference
between Anita Baker and Whitney Houston, or Fresh Prince/Hammer and Public
Enemy.  Jungle to me is like PE, or Anita Baker.  House, IMO, has become
very, very star searchish and formulaic.  I understand that many thigns
follow a formula, the big thing is are you expecting it, or does it suprise
you.

This is not true.  All music may have it's origins there, but often music
is manufactured in people's bedrooms, in deluxe studios, etc.  Alot of
people aren't from the street at all, and it shows in their music.  I would
even correct you to say that music doesn't start in the street but in
villages.  But were' getting into minutae of semantics.  We both beleive
the same thing at the core, I'm certain.

When I say street what I'm talking about is people's interaction with
others and presenting that interaction or observation.  If you never leave
your house what kind of street sensibility does one have anyway?  I think
of street as raw.  And that is the definition, many share (from what I've
read and experienced).

Perhaps.  Just like hip-hop, which is harder to find these days, or at
least the good stuff, it became marginalized and sanitzed as soon as
everyone started weraring their baseball caps backwards and trying to, er
act, for lack of a better word, "urban" (read black/latino).

Just because it had street origins is no gurantee of purity.  As a matter
of fact one might say that the closer to the street some music is, the more
apt is is to change.  Much like the verbiage of street lingo changes
rapidly, so would the music.  Hip-hops beginnings tell us this.

I hark back to a time when there was wuality oover quantity.  The more
house music has been manufactured, the more it sounds the same.  I guess
it's a natural side effect, albeit distasteful. ;)

This is as subjective as the weather.  I hear complaints from the more
experienced that the pickings are few far more than there is an abundance
of good dance music.  It could be the negative always gets to the top, but
in house music, I don't think we can rely on this paradigm since DJ's want
you to know they have the bomb tracks more often than not.

Yeah... This method works, and I admit I have used it a couple of times 
myself to get out of a jam.....
BUT

You can't take the shortcut all the time...   
What kicks ass is when you can bring in something during the ambient 
part, and have it match when the beat comes back...
Then you have SKILLS

        Really? This seems to be rather easy for me. A method taught to me
by DJ Flight from LA who just moved into our house here taught me a really
easy way to beatmatch, although it takes a while to get used to. I am pretty
sure it is the way most DJ's beat match but I haven't really heard people
talking about it on here.

        What I do is I while I have one record going I catch the 'one' beat
of the other, just like normal. If the 'one' beat does not happen to have
drums going, it can still be found, even in the ambient parts of jungle
songs(I mix jungle btw). I then listen for the phrase beginning on the
record playing, start running back and forth over the beat in time and
listening on my headphones. Then I let it go, but keep my finger on it near
the center(I never touch anywhere else on the record, just as far away from
the label I can go with out touching the grooves, even when scratching) to
keep the tempo aligned. This is the tricky part. you just have to get the
phrases to match up if there is no beat, but with a beat it's much easier.
Sometimes I'll cue up both into the headphones to help me do this. I use my
other hand to then slide the fader around until I feel like I no longer need
to give it any pressure to keep it going the right speed. This is the way I
do it know and it seems much easier after getting used to it. I can usually
beatmatch most of my favorite records in seconds, and maybe 30 seconds or so
if I am not sure on the tempo.

        I was thinking about finally making a mixtape, after about my 2
months of intensive turntable practice(I basically locked myself in my room
and spun all the time.) I finally came up with a good idea of what songs it
should have, and I think I may have an idea for a name. But I wanted one of
my good friends who is a great anime artist to draw a anime character of me
for the cover. Is this too much of a rip-off of what Vivian did on her
mixtape? Both Mystic Stepper and Ruffage of hers both have anime characters
and I feel like I may be copying somewhat, although I have been a huge anime
fan and collector for many years. What do you guys think?

Well I thought I would write about this shindig...

Saturday was simply a beautiful day.  I'd like to thank all that came.  I'd
say about 130-140 people were there maybe more, but I couldn't tell with
all that sun and evil beverages! ;)

Looks like we sold some discount tickets and gave out some free tapes.
Thanks to those that supported the camp out.  Don't worry folks you'll get
another chance to get discount tickets in the near future just keep your
ears and eyes open...Thanks Pao for the great work you did on the discount
tickets. =)

James: You the man!  That was the wackiest day set.  It went well with the vibe.
Sir_nod: Very nice breaks and did I hear trance? =)
Macadio: Well this was my first time hearing you.  Smooth mixing.
Micron: Smooth set.  Bouncing golf ball head went well with the melodies. ;)
Bio_Jeff: Nice set my friend, smooth as usual.  Nice progressive trance/house.
Siphon: ?

In any case the music was right on.  The vibe was right on.  The weather
was right on.  Hell this was a Dope party.  We even got out of there on
time.  The whole day went really well and we couldn't have done it with out
those that came and supported us, thanks.

Only one problem me and Tim were talking about; the BBQ pit is never being
left behind.  We really missed not having the pit there.  So next time we
will have the BBQ pit.  Sorry to those folks who brought food I hope it
didn't spoil.

It was good to see all those bright faces smiling and having a good time.
Thanks to those that stayed and helped clean-up and tear-down.  Take care
and keep a look out for our next shindig.

U h _ B u _ B y e !

All this talk about how simple it all is, and I haven't seen any signs of
programming.  Sure you can drop anything at the break_down of a song.  You
could use two break_downs and be really cheesy.

I'd like to say that mixing is more than beat_matching...

Beat_matching is essential to the process, but its not all that can be
done.  There is so many different things you can do.  And one of the most
important ones is getting the songs that compliment each other.  Learn to
program.  Get your phrases dialed in.  Know your measures you are at before
you drop the cued record in.  KNOW YOUR RECORDS!  If you find yourself
mixing to fast slow down be patient.  Don't rush the mix.  It all goes hand
in hand.  Then you can work on your own style.  Don't cheat the learning
process.  You need a concrete base before you start building.

Just my thought of the day.  And this goes for all styles of music...

Take care,


   S       i       p       h       o       n

I hate damn old-skoolers.  They piss me off too.  All that talk about how
they used to do it, and all week long.  How the people were better, and the
moment was better, and the additives were better.  I wish they would either
get outside more often to some real digs, or just stay home and leave the
rest of us to have a good itme.  That's what I say! ;)

May I offer another suggestion.  For all of those who can't do w/o
house/rave/whatever music MORE POWER TO YA!  Now all you gotta do is start
a party and keep it going.  Music all night and day long!  A walkman?  I
dunno, just another means to set yourself apart from a potential group
exeprience.  Unless of course everyone's wearing them, then it's a shared
experience of a different nature.

Basics 5-year family reunion was incredible last night.  
For all of you that showed up I hope you guys had a wonderful time.  A
little stuffy inside the locale though, but the fans on the side helped out
a lot.

Andre Lucero started things up with some good tracks

Mark E. Quark played some tunes that took the crowd into second gear

Carlos- no explanation needed! Good to see him again.

Tony- This man is tops, and like no other.  He is able to take many people
to the higher level, and gets my vote this year for the "dj's that dance"
award, next to Carlos!  :-P 
Someone i.d. his track (kinda old) that goes, "What is house music? It's a
unique form, a unique form of music"  

Spun- Always has the jammin' tunes...

Josh- missed his set! :-(

Hi to: Dorena, Josh_E_Josh, Jondabomb (thanx for dj printouts n' stuff,
man), and to all others on this list that I missed.  I chilled to the right
of the dj's at the table most of the night w/ watermelons and the rest of
the mad mad people, and energy.

Finally, isn't it neat to check out people groovin'? Everyone has their own
unique style, move, and grace.  Everyone's dance says a little something
about them, and what they're like, am I correct?  

Tired Mr. E, goodnight!

Um... I thought breakbeat WAS the 'cool thing'.  Prodigy, Chemical Bros,
DJ Dan, etc.  Jungle gets a lot of respect right now, but I've seen a lot
of good jungle DJs play to empty rooms, or to chill rooms that might not
really need a good dose of hella dark techstep (I never know who to blame
for this... should the DJ change their style to the environment, or should
the promoter be open minded enough to book harder jungle DJs in the main
room... I dunno).  Not all jungle is out of sorts in a chill room... I
love to hear Bukem'ish stuff, or live D&B in the vein of what C-Lab or
Protolab have been doing lately...

Regardless of what current tastes are, I maintain a lot of respect for
those people who have something to say with their music thats bigger than
style or the latest trend.  A tip of the hat to people who spin out the
music they LOVE.

Even if it is breakbeat...

Whats up mr. Andy W!

	this is a pretty interesting thread.  I have run into this question a few times recently.

Jungle may be a current novelty, but will it EVER reach a main stage appreciation?

In thinking, I realize this may sound a little pessimistic, but I dont think it will.  Complex syncopations dont suit it for a front-and-center size appreciation in the raving community
(no matter now many times I dance to it ;)  I mean, maybe the next year (maybe even the next month) can prove me different, but as far as im concerned, we can just let people find their
own ways to the jungle. No need to bring the jungle to them, let it stay in the side room and the back alley for full appreciation by those who love it.

early morning words

i managed to trick my long time raving partner, who has been dormant the 
past 9 months to make a drive out to pt. molate.

now seeing as how he complains and always blames busted or bum parties 
on me (( i do love him though ) in a platonic way Byroni ) i opted to 
get there first and then get refreshments later....

the beats cru was there as promised amidst a guy who was building  a tee 
pee plus some friendly raver type  kids and stuff.

a dj was spinning, who i later found out to be Don associated with the 
cloud factory, some funky break type acid house type trance ( i hate 
labels ) basically he was ginvin' it what he's got and it was very 
enjoyable.  i was one of the few dance junkies, but then again i got 
there really rilly early.
 
later i met some really cool listers such as siphon and drenalin i also 
met  some nice three letered persons named ian and mia

i had an altogether great time for the limited time i was there....keep 
it goin' on beats cru.....i'm already packing for the big campout.  i 
got my glowing "lost world" watch soes i knows what time is it? my 
expatriated so-cal raves necklace and matching rubber gloves, a tent 
,some warm balnkets and a sack '0 green jeans......i think i'm 
ready......any suggestions.

i was told that posting once a week won't get you noticed, but intend to 
revert that statement. ....this is jonas joaquin robledo aka jake loco 
and i'm not stopping anytime soon......    :) for you and you and you 
over there looking oh so attractive.

Uncle Noah & AndyW:

Here here.  I also think that Jungle will probably never take off the way
that house music has here in this country.  I dunno why, but there still
doesn't seem to be the plethora of clubs that play this style, coupled with
jungles apparent non danceableness, I think it's safe to say it will
probably remain UG.  I certainly hope so.

Another item you might want to remember is that people are probably just
starting to come out of the closet moreso than everyone wanting to be a
junglist.  At least that is the case with me.  I have been buying jungle,
selectively, for 2 years, and I've said nary a word about it until
recently. Why?  I dunno.  Could be that the people I hang around don't
respect the music much to appreciate it, so I've become a closet collector.
Couple this with the fact that I've heard people spin the most 1
dimensional jungle/drums & bass sets that I see little need in hyping a
style that seems to have plenty of imitators and few innovators.

Also being on somewhat of a fringe it allows me to collect some of the
better cuts w/o everyone bum rushing to get the latest track.  It's nice
that the jungle/drums&bass community is smaller than the house scene, at
least to me.  And thus I want to guard against a bum rush of new-junglist
so that I can get my choons first.  Yep, I'm like that sometimes...anyway
just an alternate explantion or at least my .02.

Much peace,
John

Hey people!

	I am wanting to know if any of you out there know any 
yay area kids that do the jungle MC thing.  Or perhaps
an already established MC/DJ team? I am trying to piece
together a list of peoples open to get together for some
strictly jungle parties this summer and next fall.   Completely
low key.  Im aiming to just put something together to have fun.
So anyone interested please respond to me.  I know we have 
a huge base of talent on this list alone and I think it would be
fun to unite it!

also!  Anyone in the protolab team, id like to talk to you guys
as well.  If anyone can put me in contact id appreciate it lots.

Peace

I know exactly.

 To the nano-second when a beat will return. Songs I have not heard before!
 If I am wrong. It's because the song was not made with any timing
involved.

Ahh yes,

The irresponsibility of youth.  I love it; the perpetuation of disease
through ignorance.  I am glad that you're not like that anymore.  I am also
glad I have stayed away from scene sex.  Too many variables, and too much
too much.

Peace & stay shielded.  You also may want to do a full screening...,
John

Thanks..went to the Supernatural Cresent Moon gig north of Santa Cruz on Sat.
Awesome..specially since all the power was on in the greater Santa Cruz area
at 1:30am. About 200 dancing in the fog on the edge of a cliff with the surf
pounding and an occasional star poking out of the darkness.

My whole day just changed - a beautiful friend just called me to say good
morning, and I swear it brightened everything.  A cheerful voice in the
morning can make a big difference!  So everyone of you out there maybe
thinking of someone this morning, or any other morning, pick up the phone
and call them just to say hello!@ =)  You can share a smile as far as your
voice can reach!

good day!
Max

Hi-

I'm looking for a good place to buy a travel box for my records.  I don't
need anything fancy, but if anybody knows of a good bargain, locally in the
bay area or elsewhere, please let me know.

Well, there's so much that can pop into your head when you are home with
nothing to do.  For instance...

      FOOD FOR THOUGHT>  If you cut up the 7-Eleven Slurpee cups and
rearrange the letters, you can spell PLUR and LURP.  Two highly renound Raver
mottos.  Tape them everywhere you go and spread the good vibes.  A thirst and
soul quenching thought.  Just my $0.79

HAVE A GOOD DAY EVERYBODY.

      hugs N'stuff,
            'trice                       <<<<RAVEON>>>>

Hi allzs, how are we doing on this beautiful day? :) 
I'm in an extra good mood cause I finally discovered
what 'genre' of techno I love the most! :O)

I like the EuroDisco/EuroDance/HappyHardcore kinda stuff :) its FAST,
TECHNOY and has VOCALS! ;O) I love music with vocals...specially if they
are techno-remakes of my favorite songs :o) 

does anyone else like this kind of music?? I guess its what people
listen to in Europe :OP. but in any case... I'm listening to some cool
techno version of ABBA's Dancing QUeen :O) right now...so I'm happy ;O)

Just bored and posting something ;)
Hugs and Kisses and ABbaEsque :o)

Solid Grooves will match any price and they have some good stuff. You
might want to stick to the standard AT flight case those are pretty
cheap. I got my big old "shiny metal" one for $140 but you can't get
them for that price any more they are more like $200 now  :-(  But if
you dont want to get a box (which I reccomend only if your traveling)
then get these new PRythm bags that are so good. They hold more rekkid
then the Technics bags, they cost about $10 more but worth it. I am
getting one but they are backstocked so you have to get on a kind of
waiting list.

Woo-hoo!  My summer travel plans are basically finalized, and I'm
pretty sure I'll be heading to Dublin for two weeks at the end of July.
I've never been before, and I was wondering if there were any
long-distance lurkers on this list from Ireland who might want to meet up
and share a pint or something?  I'm beside myself to go... Dublin is
apparently a really cool city, and I know straight where I'm headed when I
get there--The Kitchen, a trance club owned by me fave band, U2... :)

ANyways, I just wanted to ask if anyone knows of any cool raver-types
(or non-ravers, it doesn't matter) over in the eastern part of Ireland who
they may be able to put me in touch with, I'd really appreciate it!
Please email me privately if you can share any info.  Thanks!

cheers
Tim

I First want to start out by thanking Tim and the crew that help
setup/put on/bring out side for saturday. It was great good sound and
monitor. Next I wanted to thank everyone that came out it was a nice
sunny day but one thing I did not anticapate was the wind. I show up
in shorts and T-shirt which BTW is rare for my skinny ass   :P~ but I
did thinking it would be hot it was very windy and kind of cold but
real nice day. O another thing I sure was hungry and no-one bought any
food.  :-(  Tim had made a comment about wanting to be doing something
like BBQ'ing but do to the finances that was not possible I sure
wished some rave persons would have brought some vitals. But I guess I
should have eaten before coming and should have gotten up earler to
get there in plenty of time instead of 2 minutes before my set. Sorry
for the babbbling. It was a good party on a good day with a good
Crew/DJ's/Vibe/People
BTW I found my missing CD it was in my car.

Love,
Macadio

Me and my Entourage are going to Ft. Lauderdale to party the week of June 15
to June 22. Looking for places to party. We know of Bermuda Triangle, Roxies,
and Septembers. Any other special recommendations for the Ft.
Lauderdale/South Beach Area. Any rave sites for Florida?

Many thanks,
Neal

Well...beats was great..as usual....except for the rather small
turnout.

It was good to get a chance to see siphon and biojeff spin (i would
say the same about macadio, but i already have seen him spin too many 
times  ;)

I unfortunately missed SirNod and James' sets.

Well..the main point of this letter is to thank TIM for having the
beats party.  This is a guy that has done a LOT for the SFR community
and deserves some thanks...so thanks tim.

See u all soon (hopefully)

8)~
dan

Hey y'all

I wanted to announce that I just finished my new mixtape:

	MUDFOOT MEETS THE DRAGON
	    -Deadly Drum and Bass-

96 minutes of new school jungle beats, from jump-up to weird experimental
darkstep and everywhere in between... including a couple of classics and
some fat white labels... here's the TRACK LISTING!

1
Flames of the Dragon - Lee "Scratch" Perry - Trojan
Show Me Whatcha Got - School of Hard Knocks - Area 51
12:00 Drive By - Forces of Nature - Beeswax
Punks - A-sides - Strictly Underground
??? - Bizzy B test pressing
Clear My Throat - Bizzy B - Joker
Bounce - LBC - Collusion
Sample Warfare - Master AK - Menace
Sweet Vibrations - Prisoners of Technology - Fresh Kutt 01
??? - Promo 11
Immortal - Zenith - Frontline
Survival of the Fit - Dream Team - Joker

2
International - MTS - Juice
Your Sound - J.Majik - Razor's Edge
??? - Promo 10
??? - Source Direct 06
Slamfunk - John B. - Formation
Brief Relapse - Kriss FM - Future Tense 01
??? - Indica's Rhythm - Splash
??? - Grooverider - Razor's Edge
Metropolis - Adam F - Metalheadz
Dub Plate Pressure -Mystical Influence -  Syn01
Da Nine Seven - Tommy Ill - Pimp 01
Activate - Nino Brown - Phat Trax 01

I worked really hard on this tape, and I had it professionally duplicated
on chrome tapes, so the sound quality is great, and I've gotten a great
response from everyone who's listened to it so far.  The price is $10
direct from me,  and I'll mail it anywhere for the price of postage.  Email
me for more info!

Thanks
Jonathan

P.S. You can also buy it in SF at Zebra, Housewares, Dropbeat, BPO, or the
Trance and Jungle Factory.

help draw attention and a crowd to support this issue

Hi all,
I have a friend,(Toby) that wants to make a mixtape.  I have CD-R, a Pentium
PC with 32 megs of RAM and a 3.5 gig h/d.  Is it possible to record a 60 min
mix straight to h/d?  I figure, recording at 44.1khz stereo, this should use
about 720 megs of h/d space, so space isn't a problem.  Any suggestions?

                                                                   thanks,
                                                                          Eric

Subject: A BBQ & BEATS thank you
Sender: sfraves-owner@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

Well, I'd like to thank everyone that came out on Saturday to BEATS. It was
a great day with great music and people. I'd also like to thank the crew
for doing a great job with this event also, without there help this event
wouldn't have happened. Another thank you goes out to those that donated. I
hope you enjoy the mixtape, and I'll also be letting everyone that has the
discount ticket know how, when and where to use it when the tickets for the
campout are available.

One thing I will not do again, is not bring the BBQ.  Since we are trying
to save money for the campout, we named this event BEATS, because we were
not going to bring the BBQ. I did make a post to the list, but maybe should
have also put it on the VM too. Lesson learned.

Anyway, sorry for those that did bring food and expected the huge BBQ to be
there.  I will not throw another daytime event without it. I kinda felt
like there was something missing anyway.

If you weren't able to get the $5 discount ticket for the BBQ & BEATS
Campout and mixtape for donating $5, I'll be posting a message sometime
soon about how you can get one. The price of the Campout will be $10.

Again, I'd like to thank everyone that ventured out to spend there Saturday
with us.


Take care,

Somethin's-Got-To-Give music right now!  Never been so happy at work!
With a little love, I feel so Positive!  (Thats a hint BTW ;-)

Maybe the happiest song on the planet (except Little Fluffy Clouds) is
Sunshine Productions "Above The Clouds" (I have the DJ Vibes and Wishdokta
mix on an LPM comp).  I just thought Id share that ;-)

greetings sfrave community. My name is Seamus Malone. I probably already 
know a few of you from NYC and maybe Chicago. I've been lurking a while 
evnying five dollar parties and all the outdoor venues.... eesh. Anyway, 
life in NY has turned into a fight for survival and i'm interested in 
doing something more than surviving. I haven't been able to settle here 
in three years because it just doesn't feel like home. westward-ho.

i'm a 29yr old multi-media producer, currently living in NYC originally 
from Michigan and Chicago. I was actually born half way between Chicago 
and Detroit and that's where i am musically, housey techno, techno-house. 

Anyway, I'm moving to San Francisco in July. Besides looking forward to 
meeting everyone, I'll go out on a limb and take everyone's word that sf 
is a lot more vibey scene and presume everyone will be anxious to help me :)

i'll be looking for an apartment in the city. any advise and or offers? 
input on neighborhoods etc. I've been loft-living for a long time, but 
could settle for a more central apt. I really don't want to be out of the 
city. A temporary roommate situation for a couple months or longer might 
be ideal while i sort out the city and where and how the best place for 
me to settle is. I do need space to set up my decks, a king size bed and I 
have two very sweet cats. I don't smoke and would prefer a non-smoker and 
absolutely can't live with a heavy smoker due to a pretty bad allergy to 
tobacco (err, i don't smoke anything much, but the allergy just 
seems to be to tobacco...)

i have a few freelance things lined up but i'll also be looking for web 
design work. i can direct anyone interested to a resume, samples, url, i 
won't take up bandwidth with all that. I am actually hoping not to jump 
right into a permanent job, so one thing i need is some idea how the 
freelance scene in sf works for multi-media. In chicago it was all 
through agencies, in NYC lately it's all been traffic on a few lists. 
I've found Craig's list, but it doesn't seem to have same role as WWWAC 
has in NY... am I missing the point? do i need to log onto another list?

ok guyz, this is a silly question but I wanted to make sure I was
correct. last nite I got in an argument with someone who claimed that
"ORBITAL" was Trance/Jungle. 

Orbital is not Trance or Jungle. am I correct?
Thanks!

Try K&K music on west San Carlos Avenue in San Jose.  It is a discount music supply store.   Good luck.  The number for them is 408.998.4850.

So many memories; where to start?

Liquid Air: at 24th & Ill, GGNRA, and that weird mud flat in Fremont. Small
parties with lots of vibe. ~'93

Happy Happy Joy Joy:  Ghost and Carlos goin off at secret studios on
Napoleon. I had a lot of fun working the door with my good friends Barry
and Dominic. '93-94

Carefree: No chance of this straight boy getting laid, but great music,
killer vibe, and no homophobes. ~'93

South Bay SFR lunches with Larry Ching, Bob Ramstad and many more. ~'93-94

Bulletproof opens up in '92 the first place in the Bay to get Phat rave
clothes.

All those Sunday raves in Golden Gate Park. The first place that I ever
heard of SFR.~'93

Dubtribe: at Cafe Bastile on New Years Eve, and in some warehouse. More fun
with maglights and doorshifts.~'93

sorry to anyone who wanted to party in the daytime at supernatural. 
While i was running up to santa rosa to pick up Tracy the party was
supposed to get rollin'.  by the time I got into santa cruz supernatural
had been busted twice already.   lucky for us my friend was doing his
Cresent Moon gig that nite and we still had a chance to party (even
though it was hours later)   I am getting some private land lined up for
next month and it should work out.   thanks to everyone who showed
interest.  next month will be fat.look for dj lineup soon.

Spherical needles for sure!!!



Ok. I know nothing about Stanton needles..
But. I know. I just gotta be right.

Stanton Track Masters = Spherical
Stanton Groove Masters = Eliptical

I am right aren't I?

I don't know. I back-track ok. And.. My friend Tim has had two Track
Masters right.. And he just bought some groove masters..

The groove masters feel like there plowing into the record when you
back-track..

It's gotta be spherical mang.

with 200 shadows, listening to the surf crash against the cliffs as the
ambient tunes filled the night air. Thanks for the ino.

You're sure you're not mixing the up with Orb? Orb is ambient for
sure. Orbital is more up-tempo, but what pigeon-hole to put it in?
Who cares? (But no, definitely not Jungle or Trance, IMHO!).

Hi.. I'd like to (sex) tell you about some weird psychological
phenomenon (sleep with me) that has been in the media forefront (I'm
your love slave) in the past few years. I'm talking about subliminal
suggestion. 

Subliminal suggestion (buy me a car) is a technique in which the
subconscious is made aware of a concept by having it exposed (and a
stereo) to them too fast or in a way the the conscious mind can pick
(you want me) up. Thus, the person so suggested (my room 8 tonite) finds
himself doing something that he ordinarily wouldn't do (bring clean
sheets). 

This technique was often seen being used (I'll get the champagne) in
movie theatres, where one frame of a film would have a message like "Buy
the popcorn." (and the cds). This one frame goes by so fast the the
conscious mind can't possibly assimilate it (I have incredible stamina),
but many believe that the subconscious picks it up and causes the mind
(I really want you) to act on it. 

Does it really (all night is not out of the question) work? Who knows...
(and we can bring the stuffed animals and the jello and do things
that they'll have to invent new names for when we're done and then we
can sleep for 3 hours and do it all again) The jury is still out on that
one. 

Thanks for your time and patience.

        that's not too crazy when you think about it. Most jungle songs
follow similar patterns. Usually they never lose the beat though, but
sometimes they through in extra measures of stuff(like most techstep)to
throw you off. Happy hardcore is the same way. Most of those songs have the
same length, same timing, and same things happening in the same general
areas(piano breaks, helium divas.) But it sure is fun!

ecstacy of friends in the rave scene.

Micron was going to fuck off with his music.
And Jeph!!! Wow! He just keeps getting better and better every time!
He was super sick!! Jeph = "Kill Switch" Happy
:) Love you Jeph

Great Party Blake (Pengo)

Love,

Hmmm..

 People actually think like this?
 I wanna spin jungle because..

Well.. Amagine Dr Jekkle..  HOUSE!
Then.. Amagine Mr HIDE!!   JUNGLE! Woo Hoo.

I can't stop shaking for 15 minutes!

I don't care what you think is hip, cool, or in stile. I want to spin
Jungle for what it does to me.


So I am selfish.
Spoiled Brat? I don't think so. I payed for all this.. This.. Garbage.

I love to dance to Jungle.

 It's weird. After about five minutes of bobing my head. I will finally get
the rythm going through me. And I can't stop. But one distraction or screw
up. It will take me another five minutes to get it going agian.

 Talk about matching beats. Try stomping your feet 180 times per minute.
Feels grrreat.
 Almost better than sex..


God. I am SO confused.

 Seems like the best way to match jungle beats. Is through the treblez.

You know.

 Don't get me wrong. With all these cheap, quick, to the point uneducated
comments about Jungle. You still gotta love the HOU!S!E.
 I find House to be very addictive and...Sexy.

 If you wanna spin house though. Don't get no cheap Gemini like Tim. My
Numark 1800X brings me that..RavE sound. It just.. Sounds like the ravE
more. Talk about..What a difference a name makes.

Did I get that right?

Basics 5-year family reunion was incredible last night.  
For all of you that showed up I hope you guys had a wonderful time.  A
little stuffy inside the locale though, but the fans on the side helped
out
a lot.
 
Andre Lucero started things up with some good tracks
 
Mark E. Quark played some tunes that took the crowd into second gear
 
Carlos- no explanation needed! Good to see him again.
 
Tony- This man is tops, and like no other.  He is able to take many
people
to the higher level, and gets my vote this year for the "dj's that dance"
award, next to Carlos!  :-P 
Someone i.d. his track (kinda old) that goes, "What is house music? It's
a
unique form, a unique form of music"  
 
Spun- Always has the jammin' tunes...
 
Josh- missed his set! :-(
 
Hi to: Dorena, Josh_E_Josh, Jondabomb (thanx for dj printouts n' stuff,
man), and to all others on this list that I missed.  I chilled to the
right
of the dj's at the table most of the night w/ watermelons and the rest of
the mad mad people, and energy.
 
Finally, isn't it neat to check out people groovin'? Everyone has their
own
unique style, move, and grace.  Everyone's dance says a little something
about them, and what they're like, am I correct?  
 
Tired Mr. E, goodnight!

Well I always see that guy at raves covered with twhirling colored light

maybe you could hire him to become a part of your home?

or maybe you could feed glowsicks to roaches and let them run wild
at your party....

actually you can buy them at radio shack or most hardware stores.

Let me start off by saying the Rodtigo (rod) DeAlejandro, the Vice 
President of Mutual Administration (78 Port of Spain, Coronado, CA  92118 
vox619.575.3584 fax619.575.2568) gave me a business card at Forces of 
Nature and asked me to mention him, so there ya go toughguy!

This was a fun fun party!  I give it two tonearms up.

on with the review:
PARTY:  Forces of Nature
LOCATION:  Sandy Eggo Convention Center
WHEN: 6/7/97 9pm - 6/8/97 6am

SPACE:
The convention center is a confusing place to park at.  Also, be ready to 
shell out $4 (not mentioned on the info line).  I get my parking thing 
and it says "NO OVERNIGHT PARKING"  so I ask the dude what's up and he 
says, "Ah, nah it's okie dokie go ahead and park that Bug over there," he 
points into the lot.  I figure if someone want's to tow the Bug-O-Doom 
they're welcome to it.
Inside, they had part of the large hall partitioned with an air wall into 
two 'rooms' with a common back area where goodies like the snack bar and 
beer garden (yes kids, the beer garden) could be found.  I drank Snapple.
Plenty of room and pretty good acoustics for concrete floors and such.  
Not much bleed over from room to room either, unless you were standing 
right between them.  People kept milling about sweeping up candy wrappers 
and stuff so it looked fairly clean throughout the evening.

EYECANDY:
The decorations were pretty cool!  There needed to be more blacklights, 
though... some of those decorations seemd to be screaming for it!  The 
video stuff in the house/trance room was interesting but seemed to just 
be on a 5 minute continuous loop for most of the night.  Visuals in the 
Jungle room were fun, including nice snippets from the end of 2001: A 
Space Odyssey.

MUSIC:
-house/trace-
The kids seemed to be really getting into the groove here!  Some quality 
tracks and fun mixes (a few trainwrecks to bring in the morning, but hey 
what could I want!  I only spent $28 getting parked and in the door!  Who 
needs beatmatched mixes?  Anyway the thumpitty thum thump help you feel 
awake again after dancing all night!)

Now, I'm not trying to tell anyone what to do, but why does everyone have 
to spin CJ Bolland's "Sugar is Sweeter"?

DJ Icey got on the decks and opened with a really fun barrage of breaks, 
switching beats about every 8 counts or so... fun stuff rolling from 
groove to groove.  I feel this was the best part of his set.

I was under the impression that Juan Atkins was performing live, but I 
guess I misunderstood. :/  Ah well, maybe next time! :)

-jungle-
When Uncle Noah isn't listening to breaks, he like to hear the jungle.  
:)  I spent the first 20 minutes or so that I was there in the jungle 
room with my head just about as close to the speakers as I could get.  
It's fun to feel the bassline rumbling in your sinuses!!  yes yes yes 
jungle jungle jungle.  It's good stuff, kids, especially coming from a 
fine group of selecta's like they had there.

-MC's-
Jury's still out on my opinion here.  They were all really cool and very 
laid back.  I enjoied their vibe.  I liked hearing "Man what a phat 
track!" during a pause in the beats!  It made me feel all silly and 
happy.  But I don't really know if for me the MC's added or detracted 
from the tracks themselves...  this calls for more research.

SOUND SYSTEM:
Cerwin Vega.  The bassbins weren't big enough to climb into, and they 
were fenced off so no good speaker hugging opportunities, but it sounded 
very nice! :)

PEOPLE:
On the whole they were friendly!  I met a coule of folks that I've seen 
on the 'net and I met a few folks I had seen in photos from other 
parties, so that was fun.  Of course I got to visit with my Sandy Eggo 
raving family, which is always a big treat.

VIBE/CLOSING COMMENTS:
Good vibe, the energy seemed to go down a lot around 2:30-3am wich was 
kind of a bummer.  The jungle room cleared out pretty quick wich was too 
bad, but I kept bipping in to catch some groove.  

-bunky-
To those that like to selll bunky:  If someone wants to just feel speedy 
for a little while, they can take NoDoz.  If someone just wants a stomach 
ache and a littel speedy feeling, they can take Excedrin.  but if they are 
looking for MDMA, they probably don't want NoDoz or Excedrin.  Make sense?

This was a really cool party in a really fun and safe location.  Everyone 
seemd to get along well and the vibe was upbeat throughout the night!  
This party was 100% worth the drive down.

Hi everyone,

A number of people have expressed their interest in being part of a Karma
Patrol group ..... here's an update ...

i see this as being a group of people who make periodic commitments to be
part of a karma patrol team invited to be at parties .... checking on folks,
handing out water, candy and positive vibes .... and keeping an eye on those
who need a little help....

there would definitely be some sitting with people who are in a bad place
right then, and/or making sure their friends are with them, or checking if
they need medical attentin, etc...

The commitment is serious, not just a differnt way to hang out at
parties.... which is why no one will do it *all* the time ... if we have a
good core crew, then maybe 50% of the parties you go to ... or less if need
be...  Most important is the specific party where you're "on duty" as it were...

The logistics and style and methods are totally up to the group to decide,
and I know we can come up with ideas that work for everyone.  (and the name
is also not written in stone at all)

this is not what is being called the "Just Say Know" project, although we
would carry information about drugs that are to be given out as needed.

If i haven't already told you i have you on the list, pleaes send me an
email.  Rob Rayle has offered to host a meeting at his home in the east bay,
and I'm hoping to do it a week from Wednesday night (6/18 i think) ....
Dianna Greer has also offered to use her place, which we can do the next one
after that...

Please rsvp if you want to make this meeting ... we're also going to set up
a separate list for Karma Patrol courtesy of Steve Simitzis at Saturn5, so
we can keep our volume of messages off of SFRaves.

Love,

Leslie

you started this tirade out by "tooting" your horn for about three
paragraphs.

>-Jungle sounds good at 160 bpm or 80 bpm.  Look at the range in tempo 
>you

>house
>music.
>

jungle and house have a different rythmic structure.  house music has a
beat that is in sync with the high hat /congas etc.   Jungle on the other
hand has bass that is either half time or quarter time of the drums/high
hat/precussion.  When you say Jungle sounds good at 160 bpm or 80 bpm it
is because part of the song (the bass) is playing at 80 and part of the
song (the drum ) is playing at 160 bpm.  both of these are playing at the
same time. What you said still doesn't tell me how you are going to mix
this with a housebeat going at 120.  I would really like to hear jungle
playing at 120bpm. I don't think you will find alot of it.  


>Jungle is far more complex rhythmically than house

as I said house has precussion that is in sync (usually) with the
bassline.  I guess you could say it is more simple.  but whats wrong with
simple if people really GROOVE to it.   some of the most slammin songs
that i have heard are very minimal.  alot of house songs are designed to
be mixed and layered for a long time.  and if a song is too busy, it
might not always sound great with another song that has alot going on in
it,(even if they are on beat!)


>
-The emotional content in jungle is quite real.  In house, it is all a
>setup.  There is an intensity to jungle that cannot be denied.  
>Perhaps due
>to it's street origins.


i really wish you had more tact when you talk about other people's music.
  house music is fueled by emotion.  perhaps its not the emotions that
you are in touch with.  "House is a feelin' that no one can understand
unless they are deep in the vibe of House"  (thats from a song but it is
how I feel)   house is a dynamic vibe that is felt by and through people
getting down.  you see,  house music came from the gay/black/latino disco
scene from chicago and NY.    house music comes from the street.    the
emotions in house music are not about saddness or anger or fear.   House
music is an expression of love and joy.  do you think that it is easy
being gay and black in chicago?    House music was created by people that
would rather experience joy than dwell in the  sorrow of their everyday
existance.  

 Johnsin (sp?)  eluded to something like this  when he talked about
ravers trying to escape and drum and bass people "dealing with it."   
House people deal with thier problems away from the dancefloor.   in fact
house gives us the strength to keep on.  when there is no one there for
you you still have a home in house.

As for house music being  "all a setup", I really wish i understood
better what you meant by that, because i don't see it at all.


>-The music is just plain trippier.  House is just plain predictable.

house and jungle have different structures and i will admit that jungle
sometimes is very experimental.  but there is house music out there that
is REALLY crazy.  Jungle is newer and there is alot of stuff that people
are hearing for the first time.  but as jungle grows in popularity alot
of it will get recycled.  this is true with house too.  the trick is to
buy the records that do push the edge. There are alot of house dj's and
finding records that really hit, can sometimes involve knowing when the
shipment is coming in. Maybe you have trouble finding good house records
but they are there.   house can in some instances be as simple as you
describe it in the above paragraph, but a good dj finds the records that
offer something else.  and blends them together creatively.

  House dj's invented mixing records.

everyone grooves on a different vibe.  so please don't diss what you
don't truly understand.   the only music that i diss is pop and that is
not because of the music, it is because of the MTV machine that feeds it
down peoples throat.

peace

International Drug Peace Rally

----------------------< Media Release >--------------------------

           ANNOUNCING THE INTERNATIONAL DRUG PEACE RALLY!
                      Sunday, June 15th, 1997
  
To celebrate Global Anti-Prohibition Day on June 15th, 1997, The 
Legalize! Initiative is sponsoring an International Drug Peace Rally 
in San Francisco that is being coordinated with anti-prohibition events 
in cities around the world including New York and Amsterdam. This major
event will be held from noon until 6pm at the Civic Center Plaza, which 
is located at the corner of Polk and Grove, and will feature widely-known
and respected speakers including:

John Perry Barlow, Marsha Rosenbaum, J. Tony Serra, Terence Hallinan,
Denis Peron, Chris Conrad, Dr. Eugene Schoenfeld, Dr. John Berisford, 
Leo Mercado, Elizabeth Gips and a number of other excellent speakers.

The International Drug Peace Rally will commence at noon with dance 
music from the Funky Nixons, followed at 12:30pm by a lively March for 
Drug Truce led by the Nomad Festival. Everyone is encouraged to show 
up for the March with white flags that symbolize our united quest for 
a truce in the Drug War. The speaking portion of the event is scheduled 
to begin at 1:15pm and will run until 6:00pm, including a Global
Meditation for Drug Peace at 4:20pm and The Haight Ashbury Experience 
with Elizabeth Gips at 5:10pm.  The Rally will also host a Rave Dance
Celebration from 1:30-5:30pm that will feature the well-known DJs Douglas
from CCC and DJ Tom from Koinonea spinning psychedelic trance music.  

Also of significant interest will be numerous information booths and
exhibits by organizations that support Peace in the Drug War.  This event 
is intended to be law-abiding and is free of charge to participants of 
all ages.  Just call the event hotline at (510) 412-1055 for further 
details or to leave a message.

okay, so i havent been to a "real rave" in over a year. went to the 
chemical brothers thing, but i wouldnt call that a rave. so anyway, my 
girlfriend, some guy from holland and myself decided to go to basics. we 
got there at about 10:45pm, and noticed that hardly anyone was dancing. 
we also noticed that the dj was playing the same type of music. just 
plain old BOOM BOOM BOOM B00M.  thats it. just BOOM BOOM BOOM B00M.  
which is probably why no one was really dancing. also noticed that people 
were starting to sit in the middle of the floor. so the three of us were 
talking about the fact that the dj didnt seem to care that no one was 
dancing to what he was playing, basicly, i feel, because what he played 
(to put it bluntly) sucked. no offense or anything (hah). as our holland 
friend was telling us that in the clubs out there, if people stop 
dancing, the dj will very promptly switch styles of music. so im 
wondering (for those of you that were at Basics) is what the first dj was 
playing (music wise) popular now?  i personaly would think not because of 
the reaction of the crowd.  so now then, the second dj comes on and 
slowly transitions into more danceable music which the people at the rave 
respond to by dancing. or perhaps because their drug(s) kicked in? (heh). 
the third dj (carlos i think?)....well, everyone really enjoyed what he 
was playing.  hell, i enjoyed it too. i must say tho that not going out 
for a rave in over a year, and then going to Basics was really something 
to get me in the mood to start raving again. also must say that whoever 
did the paintings did a nice job.  the lazers were really great. (nice to 
look at while the first dj was spinning and no one was dancing).

yeah. sorry for babbling.

Hi guys,

I had a blast at Basics. I found out I was going at the last minute and
ended up doing a lot of things spontaneously. 

I have to say that the more I hear Tony the more I love that guy's choice
of tracks. I was entranced during his entire set.

It was cool hanging with the few people I ran into at the party...
Drumlove, Liquid+Shar-E, Ron, Rodrigo... and anyone else I can't remember!
:-)

It was an intense night and I paid for it the next day by sleeping all
day.

I think my next party will be Origin on the 21 and then Freedom on the 5th
of July.

Galactic huggiwugz,

Byroni

Orbital is such a good band that they can make tracks of any genre. I
can't wait to see them at Lollapolooza this year....

you _are_ foolish, aren't you? anyway, advertising thrives on this - show a
naked parfect womans body and write 'obsession' at the bottom of the image
anf what do you have? you too can have this perfect body if only you'd buy
this perfume! sick, imho. but welcome to a capitalist society, you know?
buyers beware!

Most jungle I've heard has no progression to it: it goes like this.

About half the drum line comes in.  This is where you beat match.
The other half of the drum line comes in, and the noises.  Fade out the old
track here so the bass lines don't wreck together.
The bass drops.  Repeat for a while.
Break!  Drop out the drums.
Drums come back.  Repeat until you're bored.

There are exceptions, but not many.  So you have to mix a bit faster in
order to keep a progression happening.  Also 'minimal' seems to be the
trend of the year; none of those super-dense gonzo Amen workouts of years
past, just beats and percussive melody fragments.

And: Since the tempo is so much faster than house, you repeat 16 bars of
drum-n-bass much faster than 16 bars of house, and boredom can set in.

I see a lot of DJs who beat-match with one ear to the 'phones and one ear
off.  Often this means their head is wedged up against their shoulder
holding it there.

How widespread is this?  Would it help to hack a mute switch onto the cord?
 This would take about fifteen seconds if you can solder, or if you want to
be really slick you can take apart the headphone assembly and put the
switch there.

hey guys - this is sort of related and i'm bored, so i thought i'd
transcribe it to you:

from the may-june issue of the _utne reader_:
*the dance of hope*
"british ravers with a social conscience are shaping a counter culture that
works

"a small group of twentysomethings in luton, england, is proving that
partying can change the world. what started as a way to lift the spirits of
unemployed young people in this struggling london suburb has become a
powerful grassroots movement to improve the community - and a new model for
social activism in britain and beyond.
        as sophie poklewski koziel reports in _resurgence_, the exodus
collective assembled a makeshift sound system and began organizing free
raves in 1993 as a way to combat the numbing boredom faced by young people
ion luton, a former center of the british auto industry where today the
unemployment rate is about 40%. they covered their costs by passing a hat
through the crowd. "the idea was to put on free parties to give people a
focus, something to do, to get together," says exodus member glenn jenkins.
"exodus has come up with some practical solutions."
        the dances answered the need for community (some credit the
collective with ending a three-day riot in 1995), and before long they were
attracting large audiences from the surrounding area. an average of 2,000
people attend each exodus rave, and some have drawn up to 10,000. when the
police confiscated the sound equipment after one particularly raucous
event, 4,000 people staged a peaceful demonstration outside the luton
police station. the police returned the sound system the following day.
        with its coffers filling rapidly, the collective focused its
considerable energy on other issues, incluyding the need for more
affordable housing. last year collective members took over the manor, an
abandoned retirment home, and negotiated permission to renovate the bldg
into 40 units and a main hall. proceeds from exodus dances, together with
the residents' government housing benmefits, are used for upkeep and
renovation. the 30 residents of the bldg, now dubbed HAZ (housing action
zone) manor, live communally and do all the remodeling. eventually the bldg
will be collectively owned and self-sustaining. exodus has also developed
long meadow community farm, a destination for field trips and a place where
people can interact with animals without reaching into their pocketbooks.
(there is a zoo in luton, but few young people can afford the admission
price.) in 1993 exodus was given a temporary liscense to use the farm,
which features a barn built with recycled pallets, pot-bellied pigs, and a
working forge.
        but these successes have not come without costs. early last year a
fire-bomb exploded in the farmhouse, leaving it gutted. and in september,
reports _squall_, luton police - searching for drugs and stolen car parts -
raided the farm while the collective was in zurich organizing an event. the
police left with one bag of suger, one bag of coffee whitener, and an old
car hood. local authorities are currently trying to evict the group from
the property.
        though exodus has been credited with contributing to a 6% decrease
in the local crime rate, its members have been continually harrassed by
police. according to mark white, writing in _mixmag_, "nearly every
collective member has been arrested on warrants for minor charges: one 18
year old, alleged to have stolen a sandwich, had 30 police officers and a
police helicopter sent after him." another exodus member was charged with
murder in 1995 and later aquitted. the harrassment, in fact, has been so
blatant that the bedfordshire county council has asked for an independant
inquiry into police actions. "we always knew it would be a battle,"
explains jenkins. "it's a reaction to the commercialization of rave
culture. that's why i'm not surprised it's been so hard some times."
        but the collective is not easily giving up what it has built.
indeed, jenkins believes the group is creating a model of mutual aid and
community spirit that will be replicated by young people all across
england. "i think exodus will become the first iof many," he says. "that's
why it's been such a battle. it turns out we've tapped into something old
here. i love it. i wish other people could learn to love it as much as we
do."

and that's all folks!

cheers - e. :)

Crescent Moon was great..especially since there was a blackout in Santa Cruz
and all the lights (and music) were out. We left the Blue Light as soon as
the lights went out and went directly to Supernatural. Perfect timing.

<< sorry to anyone who wanted to party in the daytime at supernatural. 
 While i was running up to santa rosa to pick up Tracy the party was
 supposed to get rollin'.  by the time I got into santa cruz supernatural
 had been busted twice already.   lucky for us my friend was doing his
 Cresent Moon gig that nite and we still had a chance to party (even
 though it was hours later)   I am getting some private land lined up for
 next month and it should work out.   thanks to everyone who showed
 interest.  next month will be fat.look for dj lineup soon.

Folks, with this post and the one about happy hardcore, I feel I have to 
write something!

Well, Iris and Ben were kind enough to bring over a bunch of British
fliers for me and a mixtape... You probably all know that "raves" there
are 10,000-person plus, but you wouldn't believe the fliers!  Every one
dwarfed "Cool World" - almost poster-sized with fold-outs!  In addition,
there was bus and hotel info on a lot of them, and they cost in the $30
range.  I guess this doesn't compromise the scene there, but can you
imagine the same thing here??  We don't know what mainstream means over 
here, that's for sure.

Also, jungle was prominent on every flier (of course, it's much more 
mainstream and popular there).  But the biggest surprise were the 
numerous "MC's" at every party.  And they're draws, listed on the fliers 
along with the DJ's - a lot of the time in teams.  Their role seems to be 
to rap and to hype up the crowd.  That is one thing that has rarely been 
seen over here.

I asked for a sample of European techno... and got happy hardcore!  I've 
never heard this stuff at a party before.  Very very fast, like 180BPM, 
with uplifting happy house lyrics... WILD107-type songs but with a 
frentically-fast beat.  

It all screamed commercial to me, but maybe that's just all I got a 
sample of.  Stay tuned for a report when I get back from Europe in August!!

Jesus, good luck!  South Florida sucks.  Of course, when I go I have to
stay at the Senior Jewish Retirement Homes (ahh, grandparents) in a
godawful town called Plantation (p.s. no-one there finds this name
offensive!), so maybe I'm biased.  But in a quest for info, I found the
best places were the TWO dj stores around Ft. Lauderdale - one called (how
original) The DJ Store.  There you'll find fliers.  As of last year, there
were NO ug's and just massive crap in Miami and Orlando (with bus service
from Ft. Lauderdale!)

The only thing going on was put on by this dj I met, Mike something (a 
top dj there but now I can't remember his name!), who did a weekly at a 
club in Ft.L.  However, alcohol is served in Florida til 4AM - so his 
"rave weekly" went from 4AN - noon!!  Now, ravers are known for being 
night owls (ah, speed anyone??), but that is ridiculous.

There are probably people on the list who went to the Winter Music
Conference in Miami, so they probably have much better info.  But all I 
saw in Fort Lauderdale were bleached blondes and buff dudes drinking bad 
beer to classic rock.  Have fun.

this is my first NRR post so i feel a little wierd writing this but i was
wondering if anyone saw the REALLY wierd light in the sky in santa cruz
around 12:30-1:00.    me and my friends were dosed that day but i was
done by then.  I will describe it.  there was a really intense blue/green
flash that covered the whole sky at once, then the streetlights flickered
for a while. then they went out and the sky flashed again this happened
one more time. and then the power was out.  it was right before the
cresent moon party,  we were all outside getting ready to go.   when the
first flash hit i kinda ignored it like maybe my eyes were just "funny"
right then.   but after i heard everyone yelling "holy shit ! ...what was
that" i knew something must be wierd.  at first i thought maybe there had
been some terrible nuclear accident and the shockwave would hit soon, but
nothing ever happened....it wasn't  lightning because there was no
thunder and lightning is not bright aqua green.   later that night i went
to my friends house to crash and he lives in the mountains.  he and his
housemates saw it and they were totally blown away too.  if anyone saw
this or heard what it was i would really like to hear about it.
peace

        well, to me it's just different dancing. For trance, or any 4/4
boom-boom bass drum beat, I will generally hop around and flail in time with
the music. Usually I will get more intense as the music gets more intense(as
does everyone else). So for Goa, Detroit techno, hard acid, or any of the
harder stuff I usually go nuts.

        For jungle or breaks or anything without a constant bass drum, I
like to strut my 'beginning breakdancing' moves, really shuffle my feet all
over the place and jam! It's fun but it wears me out much quicker. That's
why I've really caught on to jungle DJing. You can dance for a little while,
then stop to get the next record!

        I have a Numark DM1080 which really isn't great, but it is a solid
mixer. And boy, when that asshole spilled beer on the crossfader, boy, was I
happy that it came out unlike my friend's Gemini. I will never again buy a
mixer without a detatchable crossfader.

        As far as sound? I have never really noticed too many differences,
but I haven't spun at many raves where the sound system is larger than the
one in my room so I could tell a difference. The limitations I have now is
my personal soundsystem(two Bose 901's and a 2x15 sub-woofer) which is good,
but won't really get up to the volume that any other actual club sound
system could. So I dunno if it's good or bad in that way.

        I remember before I first spun away from my tables I use here, I
freaked out and went to Leo's to try out all the mixers they had so I would
be ready for any unusual configurations(I am a big fan of using all
available switches.) The one I ended up using at the party was a weird
Gemini that had buttons for sound effects that you could mix in. Boy was
that thing shabby!

e,

I like the idea of ravers adding to the community, and working together
for social change in a peaceful manner; but what the hell is coffee

        playing jungle at half-time(33 on a 45)will make it sound like a
really weird break, with too low bass. My friend does this from time to
time, but I think someone was actually doing this last night at Mad. It's
the first time I've seen someone do this at an actual party.

>as I said house has precussion that is in sync (usually) with the

        exactly. Any song that people can groove to is the best. Most of the
jungle I like is the real simplistic dance-able stuff, so I don't collect
too much techstep or darkstep. Just big fat simple hardstep.

        yeah, it is kind of like that. I made a mix and notice I hit the
build of every song so I had to scrap that. The build, or I guess in jungle
it should be called 'the drums drop out and the vocal sample goes into an
echo or something weird until the song suddenly jumps back in with full-on
drums and bass' part, always takes place in the same part of the song. Some
differences usually occur when there are multiple tracks on a side. MY
favorite record has 4 tracks, and only 2 of them I like, and their on the
same side. These tracks have much quicker intros, which need more active mixing.

        I find jungle just requires more mixing than usual. You really can't
just let each track play out. I am trying to discover different things to do
for jungle to keep it interesting and most importantly, keep it pumpin'. One
of my friends here in the house spins goa, and he basically just lets each
track play out and mixes at the end, but thats really what most goa DJ's do.
On the other hand we have Ian, or DJ Timestretch, who will really mix up the
jungle good to keep it interesting and listenable.

        Now I am speaking for hardstep exclusively. I know some techstep,
dark, jazzstep, and intelligent tracks that could easily stand well on their
own.

        well, I do it to listen to the other music through the house
speakers. I don't know if other DJ's do this or listen to both at the same
time in the headphones. I don't, it's too chaotic for me. putting a mute
switch on one ear would still cut out alot of the outside sound coming from
the speakers if you had the phones over both ears.

7:00PM I arrive at BBQ & Beats to quickly pass around some of my cheaply
made flyers.

8:45PM I arrive back at home just in time to meet DeepFog at the door.
We set up the place and he starts spinning at 9PM

10PM No ones here. I start to feel depresed, like its going to be one
of _thoes_ parties. So I run over to Burger King to grab some grub.

10:45PM I arrive back home to see about 7 people outside my door. Ok
cool people are here now. Im asked by Matt: "So wheres the party?"
Uh

11:30PM I finish up the last few things I need to take care of around
the house. More people come, and more, and more.

12:30 Top head count reaches 55

3:30 Ari Newman comes and tells me the bad news, my speakers are fried.
Oh well. But Ari being extra cool goes and gets his very excellent set
of speakers and the party goes on.

4:20 Party has been going on strong. Myself and 3 others climb up on my
roof for 420.

5:45 I look outside and see way too many people outside. Suffice it to
say that suburbanites dont care much for glitter kids shouting "I LOVE
YOU!" at 6 in the morning on Sunday.

6:30 Most people have left. Matt cleans up the deck (Thanks Matt!!)

So, my 2nd house party has come and gone. Awsome Vibe all night. I
really with Keri would have made it over. :(

Good Things: The PEOPLE!!! Thank you all so much for comming!! I knew as
soon as I started going to parties that I was gonna do this. I can't
remember who brought the black lights but they LIT THE HOUSE UP! 

Bad Things: Found a burnt spoon in the bathroom. Un-cool. People outside
at 6am being loud. One neibhor walk outside to see what the fuck was
going on outside her house. If this gets back to Mom n Pop, no more
house parties. And then my speakers are gone, but thats no big deal.

Thanks again everyone!!!!

The Excitement is Building!

Tommorow at approx 3pm EST, there will be the premiere airing of 'Head
Set',
one of 3 new Techno/Dance/Experimental mix shows on
http://www.netcast.com

You'll need to download the Netcast Plug-in, it's a high-q multicast
service
that bypasses the limited number of simultaneous listeners associated
with
RealAudio.

Please try to listen if you can, and let us know what you think! :)

                                     ANSWERS


1) What is Water?

	Water, W, Hot Ice, Liquid Crystal... all these "street" terms
refer to
the same substance, known chemically as H20.  Water is a highly addictive
and
toxic chemical, which in its natural state is completely odorless,
tasteless,
and clear.


2) Is Water dangerous?

	Yes.  A scientific survey recently concluded that every creature
on
earth contains Water, and almost every creature imbibes more during its
life. 
Moreover, every animal that has ever ingested this substance has
invariably
tried to get more.  Organisms unable to get more Water show signs of
withdrawal, or "dehydration," and eventually die.  Organisms that ingest
more
Water inevitably die anyway.
	Aside from the biological considerations, remember that Water is
composed of Hydrogen and Oxygen, which are used together as rocket fuel. 

Enough cannot be said about the volatile nature of this chemical.


3) Can I put Water in my bong?

	Mixing drugs is never recommended, but if you must attempt this,
note
the following:

	-Water acts as a coolant and filter.  You are likely to get
larger,
	 smoother hits than normal.

	-Water may actually blend into the smoke, imparting its own
qualities
	 to the hit.

	-Water may splash up and get in your mouth.  Yuck.


4) A FOAF got some laced Water.  How frequently does this happen?

	Almost all Water contains some contaminants.  Generally, since
Water
has no taste or odor, the presence of either of these may indicate
foreign
substances.  Water is so strong, and so cheap to produce, that the story
of
the dealer who dusted his grass to make it salable doesn't really apply.


5) How is Water synthesized?

	The simplest synthesis is as follows:

	-Fill a pot from the kitchen tap.

	-Boil for fifteen minutes.

	The Water is now suitable for ingestion.

	Steve J. Quest gives a more involved recipe yielding a
higher-grade
	intoxicant:

                    Preparation of Hydrogen Oxide (Water)
                    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        An Erlenmeyer flask is first filled with a few grams of zinc
        metal chips and is then fitted with a two hole rubber stopper. A
        thistle tube is introduced through one hole and pushed to a
        level where the end of the tube is just above the zinc chips. A
        rubber tube is introduced through the other hole and connected
        to a horizontal copper pipe filled with loose fitting chunk
        cupric oxide.  The other end of the copper pipe is connected to
        a Liebig condenser mounted in a distilling fashion (open end
        pointing down) which is suspended above a capture beaker.

        A bunsen flame is placed under the cupric oxide reaction pipe,
        and any kind of cold liquid is allowed to circulate through the
        condenser.  (some would use cold tap Water, but I can not
        recommend that procedure here due to legalities involved.)

        Sufficient quantities of concentrated sulfuric acid are then
        introduced through the thistle tube to completely cover the zinc
        chips to a level ABOVE the end of the thistle tube. Condensation
        will start to occur within the condenser and run out into the
        beaker.  The crude product represents a technical grade of
        hydrogen oxide, suitable for recreational purposes.

        The reaction sequence is as follows:

        Zn + H2SO4 -> ZnSO4 + H2        H2 + CuO -> Cu + H2O


6) Is homebrewed "bathtub" Water as effective as "the real thing?"

	In the author's opinion, "bathtub" Water ("slosh") will never be
able
to compete with legendary types like Owsley, Naya, and Perrier, but there
is
of course a certain satisfaction in synthesizing your own.


7) What is 'kind' Water?

	According to Peter McDermott:

	There are actually two major kinds. 'Soft' Water and 'Hard' 
	Water. The 'soft' Water does less damage (to kettles, pipes,
etc.)
	but the hard Water is a better hit. 

	Some people argue that there is something called a 'gatevalve'
syndrome,
	where some people who begin on the relatively harmless 'soft'
Water are
	likely to escalate to the hard stuff. However, this isn't true of
everybody.
	Personally, I've been drinking soft Water for years without ever
trying 
	anything harder.


8) Are there different types of Water?

	Christopher K. Koenigsberg explains:

	There are apparently variations in the chemical makeup of W sold
in
	stores, so someone should look into this for the FAQ (W's still
	available over the counter, no prescription necessary, not yet
	regulated by the FDA, nor scheduled by the DEA, I guess? How much
	longer before they catch on? Maybe we should be more cautious and
not
	talk about it so openly, before they start having congressional
	hearings or something?)

	For example I've seen W labelled "Steam Distilled" but on the
same
	shelf also seen W labelled "Drinking Water" and even "Spring
Water",
	and a more expensive kind for Babies (yes they are even hooking
	innocent infants) and there may or may not be differences beyond
just
	the labels and packaging. There are variations in the price even
for
	the same kind of stuff, the local store brand is always the
cheapest,
	regional "Artesian Wells" etc. are more expensive, and the
imported
	kind is most expensive.

	There are vending machines outside some grocery stores (hey! you
don't
	even have to show an ID to prove your age!) which will disburse W
	either Distilled or for Drinking, into your own choice of
unlabelled
	container (so you can pretend it's something else). And the
Drinking
	kind supposedly has mineral additives. I don't know if this is
	Strychnine, among the additives, which maybe causes the cramps
when
	you drink too much, too fast, or too cold.... but I hear that's
just a
	myth.

This is of course in mice and may not apply directly to humans.  W can be
very dangerous, so play nice and be safe.



              APPENDIX 1:  Descriptions of Water 'trips' and usage


	Kevin Jernigan, alt.drugs #85634:

   I drank Water for the first time at a party last night, and it was
great!!
Some of my friends who do W told me about the experience earlier, but I
now
realize that it was beyond my wildest expectations.  I was a little bit
scared,
at first, because I heard about some of the bad side effects that it can
cause.
A few people said they choked on it, and one guy said that he dribbled it
all   
over his clothes and got them wet.  Luckily, none of these things
happened to 
me.  They started passing glasses around to everyone and I decided to
take one  
The Water was very clear in color. They said it was scored from a guy who
got
it from a spring in Canada.  I don't know whether it was really Canadian 
Water, but it was definitely good quality, judging by the color.  I used
about 500g of it.  When I put the glass up to my mouth, and swallowed,
the
first sensation I felt was of something wet traveling down my throat. 
This 
sensation started before I had even removed the glass from my mouth.  I
was
able to acheive the same feeling again, by taking another swallow.  As
the 
trip progressed, I noticed several other things.  The W produced a state
of
mind that I believe could best be described as a lack of thirst.  The
trip
didn't last for very long, but I think that it would be safe to say that
the experience gave me some important insights into my consciousness.  
Chief among these, is the realization that Water can relieve thirst. 


	Ray Mialki, email contribution:

Although I don't partake, some of my neighbours down quite a bit of the
stuff, filling swimming pools and such.  I use it in great moderation,
not even having an outside hose spigot to wash the car with.  Daily
showers seem to be my habitual use.  


	Peter McDermott, alt.drugs #unknown:

A recent major survey (n=1) has showed that Water addiction runs in
families.
At present, NIDA funded scientists are working flat out on the genesis of
this crippling condition.

Unlike other addictions, W abuse is believed to affect all sections of
society,
rich and poor alike. However, scientists have discovered that a gene may
well
be responsible for a predisposition to drinking W.

Although 12 step 'W' recovery programmes have been around for some time
now, major cities have begun to witness a growth in self-help programs
for
Adult Children of Waterholics. "Henry" is a member of such a group.

	"Well, I've just got so much rage about this, y'know? I was never
	able to confront them about it at the time. I thought that 
	drinking Water was normal. 

	Now I'm angry. Ours is a sick culture. The French would never
dream
	of exposing their children to 'W' at dinner. There, the kids go
from
	breast milk to wine. But every single day, there it was, sitting
at 
	the dinner table in front of me. Of course, they wouldn't let me
have
	any, but after watching them do it, I saw where they got it from.
I 
	began sneaking to the tap, and taking a sip. Before I knew where
I was
	I was into the hard stuff - you know, Water sports. Baths,
showers,
	stuff like that. 

	Well, eventually, I hit bottom. I out in town and the craving
came on
	me and I found myself licking it up from puddles. Then it was
toilet
	bowls. There are no wells too deep for the 'W' addict. So I went
and
	got help. I've been in recovery for like.. 3 days now, but I
wasn't
	making any progress. Then my therapist told me about A CoW and
since
	then, it's been nothing but milk. And not mother's milk
either..."

However, not everybody accepts that 'W' use is a problem. 'Mary' has been
using 'W' for a month now. She feels that the dangers of 'W' have been
much exaggerated.

	"It's all propaganda, isn't it? I've been doing 'W' for ages now,
and
	it's just a bit of a buzz, innit. It's harmless man. There isn't
a
	single study that *proves* 'W" has any effect on the bladder, and
as
	for people who say it makes you piss. Well, they are just dirty
minded.
	As I said, I've been doing 'W' for a month, and I've never had a
piss,
	ever.

	We've started a pressure group called 'Fair Play for Water' and
it's our
	aim to force the government to tell the truth about 'W'. If there
are
	risks, tell us what they are, and how we can minimize them.
Prohibition doesn't
	work. The government knows that. Why else would they have
repealed the
	laws against heroin and cocaine? Unfortunately, there are
political 
	careers to be made out of that issue. Vote Libertarian. Privatise
the
	Water companies. Stop all government regulation of Water now!!!!



                    APPENDIX 2:  Street Prices, June 4, 1993


	Chicago, IL, North Shore Area
		-Typical Naya, $1 US per liter.

	Springdale Township, Pennsylvania 
		$5 per 1000 gallons.



                   APPENDIX 3:  International Legality Update


	In Europe W is becoming something of a threat real fast. I myself

have witnessed tourists trying to score W desperately the last couple 
of hot days here this week. As of yet there is no shortage of W, but I've

heard that in Greece it's getting scary. 
	The police are starting to recognise this situation and have
called for 
more forces on the street, weeding out W-pushers and sentencing them to 
severe punishments straight away!

Well when I first learned how to beatmatch and spinn on my friends mixer 
he didn't have a headphone cue where you could listen to both tracks in 
the headphones.  So I'd listen to one plate in one ear and beat match it 
with the other rekkid comming out the monitor - listening to it in the 
other ear.  The taco neck syndrom(TNS) look is just because usually at 
parties the sound is really loud and it's hard to distinguish the beats in the 
phones with out smashing the speaker up to your ear w/ your shoulder.  

I'm used to this style and I've seen most dj's do this.  When I work on a 
mixer that has the headphone cue control I often check my mix in the 
headphones to see how well it sounds before I cross fade it all the way 
over.   My mixer doesn't have this control either so I've always done the 
shoulder thing.  But my roommate doesn't like "LOUD" music so I don't 
play it loud and I have no need to crunch my neck.  

Or I could be all wrong and maybe it's from a DJ's diet, which might  
consit of only eating taco's at Taco Bell, hence the TNS.

I just wanted to post to the list 2 very sweet people I enjoyed having 
stay with me and my other half in Marin.  Iris and Ben from England. We 
took them to Beats last Saturday and they also attended the Basics 
party.  They will be staying in San Jose with Julie Hayes from the list 
and are looking at every chance they can to meet new sf ravers until 
their departure at the end of July.  They like Star Trek, Sci Fi books, 
and happy house techno. I hope many of you get a chance to meet them 
because they're very cool.  Also, if anyone on this list or if you know 
anyone who wouldn't mind them staying a few nights while on their CA 
journey, you could email the list to page Iris as she is checking her 
email along the way.  PS - they do have a tent with them and camping 
outdoors is fine too!

Subject: Nazi Usenet Group

 A few Neo-Nazi groups are trying to create (again) a usenet
 group where they want to keep in contact with each other
 regarding their activities. I believe it is not necessary
 to dwell further on these activities.

 The group is rec.music.white-power.

 To create such a group, they have to win a referendum that is
 always organised when a new usenet group is created. All persons
 with an email address, and only those, can vote in this
 referendum.

 It is IMPORTANT to vote only once, otherwise the vote is
 cancelled.

 To prevent the creation of this group, you have to:b      1. Send this
message to people you know
     2. Send an email to the following address:

              music-vote@sub-rosa.com

       with as contents (not 'subject') ONLY the following line:

            I vote NO on rec.music.white-power

     Since the vote is automatic, it is important to send the exact
     line as it is given above, without adding anything, not even
     a name.
     And please send it only once or it becomes invalid ! Also, please
        FORWARD THIS LETTER TO EVERYONE YOU KNOW WITH AN E-MAIL
        ADDRESS

      to prevent the founders from creating this group.

      Thanks for your collaboration.

(warning: long and autobiographical - I couldn't help myself :P!)


Seduction of a Newbie 

Berkeley, fall '94.  A disastrous first year in Northern California, spent
friendless and alone in an anonymous apartmentment drowning in scholarly
tomes, has slowly crept by.  After a year of involuntary oppression of the
hardcore partier lurking within, I am more than ready to bust out.  I'm
just waiting for the spark. 

The co-ops save me.  After a year in an apartment so silent and dark I
sometimes feel the walls caving in on me, I move into Party Central.  I'm
happy again.  New friends take me to the city one Saturday night, close to
my 25th birthday.  I am not told we are going to a rave.  I dress for your
usual drinker club - a black miniskirt, high boots and (!) a black
turtleneck sweater.  In the rave, I look like some of those cheesy bar
people you see sometimes who obviously have no idea what they have
stumbled upon - just like I was! 

We are at Cesar's Palace.  I couldn't tell you the name of the party.  I 
couldn't tell you what dj's spun.  I couldn't even tell you what kind of 
music it was!  I was completely ignorant.

Inside is more swirling color than I have ever seen.  I gaze around, 
amazed from the start.  People were still wearing costumes then, and I 
see people with wigs and people with those 3-foot tall platforms and 
people dressed like angels and fairies.  My friends find drugs and I jump 
in with the enthusiasm of someone jailed for the last year.  Already 
experienced, I gulp down two e's and a hit of acid with glee, and 
(surprise surprise) proceed to have the time of my life.  I meet people.  
I eat candy.  I bond with the people I came with.  I become acquainted 
with the speaker box.  I become one with the beat.  I am enraptured 
with the visuals and the light show.  I am enraptured with every 
person there.

By morning, I'm a raver.  There seems to be two types of people at their
first real party: the ones who go, "yeah, this is okay," and the ones who
dive in headfirst and embrace it with complete abandon.  Guess which one I
was??  Around the same time, I win the lottery: the horrible year of
internment with only my schoolbooks for company turned into a 4.0 GPA, and
suddenly I receive thousands of dollars in unforeseen scholarships.  I am
the worst combination: a newbie raver with money to burn. 

I spend the next six months going out every single weekend, eating e's 
every time.  I go to every huge massive, I go to the roller rink, I 
return to Cesar's several times.  I don't have favorite dj's or 
prejudices against this promoter or that venue.  It's all beautiful in 
my drug-haze.  Sometimes I miss those days of unvarnished idealism, where 
every party was magical and no judgements impeded on the experience.  But 
slowly I see that there are cracks in the "community," and some music and 
parties now leave me cold.  I yearn for what I feel is the possibility in 
the scene, but what I'm not quite experiencing for real.

The Newbie Discovers the Underground 
busted Friends and Family, spring 1995 

The fantasy realized (if only for a few hours).  Here, for the first time,
I experience what "family" can mean in the scene.  The first taste of the
underground is addictive and I follow the thread away from commercial
parties.  I discover Sunsets and Gateway and Harmony and more Friends and
Family.  But I also find strong opinions about parties and music and
venues.... suddenly I'm sniffing at parties that a year before would have
been the greatest night ever.  

Over time, though, my love affair with substances has faded.  I see that a
lot of that good time at every party calling itself a "rave" was had with
the help of fuzzy e-goggles.  With more experience in the scene, I start
to discover what real community can be and what can be created by a
positive-minded group of people, and it's something real from the heart,
not from drugs.  Though I now see the cracks and the pessimism and the
politics not visible to me on my newbie high, what goodness remains has
become more real and treasured to me.  The truth of the experience 
outlives any drug high.

With a barrage of discoveries in the scene, I discover that I'm changing. 
I become friendlier to people in real life, letting a lot of the suspicion
and fear that characterized growing up in L.A. fade away.  My penchant for
black clothing gives way suddenly to bright happy colors.  I start getting
silly, remembering how to play.  I discover how to dance - by letting
myself go and feeling the music - and I become a dancing fiend.  I learn
again that reality is all what we create and are intent upon, and I
resolve to create from a loving and happy heart.   I find these things 
anew when I go out, like at Warmth recently - or sometimes I just find fun, 
which has become a definite priority in life :)  


The Old-Skooler on SFR 
Finally a bonafide UG raver full of glitter and mystical revelations and
shit, I end up (where else??) on SFR.  Now it's been a year and a half on
here and I feel old-school!  SFR has been a lifeline - the heart of
the scene for me.  Most of the people I've met have been through this
list!!  It's been incredible to have a daily conversation with the people
who love this scene the most: the party throwers, dj's and all the ravers
who'll commit to 100 messages a day.  You all rock :)

I guess this has turned into a goodbye note - 3 days early.  It's been an 
incredible three years of dancing and growth and optimism and fun fun 
fun!!  

Much love to all of you SFRavers ;)
Like Vlad says, KEEP IT REAL

Anyone know of anything going on next week on a weekday?  A friend of
mine is coming to town, and she wants to enjoy the SF scene while
she's here.  There's nothing on the SFR calendar yet . . .

Peace,

Gary

Happy hardcore a good example of european techno??? In the UK, clubs are
the prominent place to go for dance music. What you'll hear in clubs is
mostly euro-house (NOT euro-disco pablo, so don't get on that plane just
yet...*smile*). Lisa Marie Experience, Way Out West, Todd Terry (and all
of them yucky EBTG-remixes), Robert Miles, stuff like that. And the
occasional US import (labels like strictly rhythm and am:pm are very
much favored by UK club djs). The underground scene in the UK is just
that, UNDERGROUND. Parties (not massives) are strictly word-of-mouth,
and it takes a big chunk of love for the music to find them. =) They're
also FREE for the most part. =)
Unfortunately (or maybe not), a lot of the people fed up with clubs and
the commercial "crap" that's played there don't have the energy or interest
to seek out the real underground parties. So they go to massives. And what's
better than happy hardcore to bog out to if you hate slick house? Nothing.
It's SO anti-mainstream, but at the same time it has a sort of candy-sweet
appeal (no offense to ANY of the candy ravers out there...) that attracts
the masses. 
Back to the underground parties though. In the UK, these are mostly trance
and acid parties. We're not talking cybertrance though, we're talking GOA 
TRANCE. Yes, the goa scene is still very much alive in the UK. And as far
as the acid parties go, it's the kind of acid that _I_ like to get down to,
hella trancey, around 145-160bpm. 
And then there's the rest of Europe. Although it's the land of poppy trance
records, parties in Germany have always been THE place for HARDASS TECHNO. 
But in the last couple of years however, things have changed. drum'n'bass 
has arrived, and most parties have a drum'n'bass dj.

And oh, Sweden... Home of Loop Records, Hybrid Records, Plumphouse Records,
Dunkla Recordings and a whole bunch of other techno labels. If you find a
party here (they're not underground, they're just not thrown very often),
it will either be a party with 8 hours of minimal techno or goa. I picked
up a few flyers this last weekend (when cricket came to see me! yay!), and
parties are $20 for a ONE-room party. 

I'm not sure this was a good response to anything anyone said, but I just
felt that I had to _try_ to explain that European "techno" is _NOT_ happy
hardcore. Most TRANCE is produced in Germany and the UK, most DRUM'N'BASS
obviously comes out of the UK. The best TECHNO (unless you're into detroit
stuff) comes from Germany and Sweden. The dance-hits you listen to on live
105 (everything from labouche to the macarena) is from europe. =)

I'd say (and this is in my limited experience), that I like to have my
queing record at two possible settings... one is reference volume, with
the headphone resting lightly on my ear, and the other is when I'm
listening to find how "tight" the bass drums are together, or if the
basslines work together (I get this 'bassier' tone by crushing the
headphone between my ear and shoulder... yes it actually serves a
purpose, I control the amount of headphone volume getting to my brain by 
varying pressure on my shoulder).

Meanwhile, the other ear gets a clear shot of what the outside is playing.

I usually don't HAVE to do this if the mixer allows for a good gradual mix
of the two records in the queue (like the Blue has), but other mixers,
especially mixers with more than two channels, usually employ a push
button queue system that requires resorting to the low tech one ear
method (unless they have a program/cue mix, but those have their faults
too).

The only time I wear my headphones on both ears is to test a mix I
know to be kinda easy to screw up prior to bringing it in, or if it's
HELLA loud behind the decks, in which case I'm using the headphones as
defensive sheilds to protect my ears.  Or sometimes, if they are really
big klunky headphones, they just won't do the one ear thing and you don't
have a choice.

I don't think the switch would be good for me... I know different
people mix differently though...

Sony V-6's are still my fave headphones.
No amount of technology will sway me.
I just wonder why the ear padding always rips in the same spot on every
pair I've ever seen...

I'll shut up now.

If you are recording/making a mix straight to the harddrive  30 seconds of
digitized audio takes up 1.4 mb of space.  Compression can play a factor in
the final edit.  U might want to try burning it directly to a cdrom (upto 640
mb of space)  or using an external drive for portability.  Sound actually
takes up a LOT of hd space and the playback rate is another factor to
consider.  But I am speaking solely of digitized audio files.  PC and Mac
platforms are a bit different too.

;-)

Just my 2 cents...

Hi all,
I have a friend,(Toby) that wants to make a mixtape.  I have CD-R, a Pentium
PC with 32 megs of RAM and a 3.5 gig h/d.  Is it possible to record a 60 min
mix straight to h/d?  I figure, recording at 44.1khz stereo, this should use
about 720 megs of h/d space, so space isn't a problem.  Any suggestions?

                                                                   thanks,

                                                                         Eric

That may be true of SF (i haven't been to enough strictly jungle events
here to say for sure)... But, if one was in Chicago during 1994-95, you'd
have heard the likes of Snuggles, Phantom45, RP Smack, and the Wildchild on
the mike during any jungle set... Chicago's Dj Hyperactive has been MC'ing
over straight techno/acid sets since time began. MC's also appear with the
likes of Lenny Dee, or HH/4beet jocks like the UK's Slipmatt... I think
when its done right, it can be really exciting, but it's also really easy
for an MC to annoy the hell out of me. Its a fine line.


"The MC is on the mike, but the dj is doing the talking..."

Please do not forward this elsewhere. The vote took place over a year ago,
however this like so many VIRUS alerts seems to keep making the rounds...

Careful where you point the censorship gun -- it might get turned on you.

A few Raver groups are trying to create (again) a usenet
group where they want to keep in contact with each other
regarding their activities.  As we all know, Raves are simply
loud parties where young people go to consume illegal drugs.

The group is rec.music.rave.

Mail your vote to vote@bogus.com so we can keep this seductive 
culture of hypnotic, repetitive beats and dangerous drugs away
from our children.

Thank you.

((Craig: for your younger readers...))

Editorial Intern: Get paid to surf! Break into the Net business!
Do you love the Net? Would you rather surf than hang out at the mall? Are
your parents always bugging you to get off the Net and come to dinner?
How'd you like the coolest job in the world this summer?

Imagine Publishing is launching The ImagineZone. Come help us build it.
We'll need you to surf the Net for about 20 hours per week here in our
Brisbane office. You'll get a state of the art PC and an awesome T1
connection (that'll smoke your 28.8, bud.) All you need to do is tell us
which sites you think would fit certain criteria as we build out the
ultimate independent website showcase.

In addition to $6 an hour, you'll get free magazines + CD-ROMs (PC Gamer, Next
Generation, The Net, Ultra Game Players, MacAddict, and Boot), cheap soft
drinks, and the chance to work alongside a bunch of computing and gaming
superfreaks.

You'll need to know how to turn on a computer and surf the Net. That's it.
If you have worked with Excel, that's perfect. You'll need to be at least
16 years old. Imagine is an equal opportunity employer and certified
tie-free office.

Come, join us in the land of the Coconut Monkey.

Hey man, I tottaly agree with the rest of your post, but i'm not quite sure
if this
is tottaly true.  Don't forget those crazy selectors from down in Jamaica,
spinning
dub b-sides on a soundsystem in front of a Toaster.  Or do you mean actually 
MIXING up the record?  Now I'm confused!  well, anyway, just had to share

unity that ravers have around the world ... this is awesome!!!

Correction, disco DJ's were the first to mix records.  Then came rapppers,

Firstly, thanks to all who replyed to my request for rave info in the
States. I've plenty to go on.

Secondly, a question. I maintain the internet site for the Ministry of
Sound. Last month we did a live broadcast from the club. We had three
cameras, sound taken from the decks and mixed with sound from microphones.
Junior Vasquez was at the decks and the whole thing was fu*king amazing and
technically perfect for over seven hours.

My question is this..

Is this the first live audio and video broadcast from a night club to the
internet in the world?

I think its the first in the UK, but I could be wrong.

Check out the archive -- over an hour of video and sound. The projection
visuals and the golden scans look v.good, although the light is a bit poor.

www.ministryofsound.co.uk

If anyone knows of any other club doing this let me know, feedback about
the reception of streaming audio and video in the states would also be
appreciated.

Later,

Will.

i find this all kind of amusing - (or maybe it isn't?) i actually had a
dentist tell me that i was grinding my teeth too much and she gave me this
piece that fits in to protect my not-so-pearly whites.... anyway, i _know_
that i don't grind my teeth regularly in my sleep, and this didn't seem to
become a problem until - oh - about 7 years ago - which happens to coincide
with my first rave... :P

cheers - e. :)

ps - why is it that i grind on acid as well? i've always been told that it
was the strichnine (sp?). really, you never know what you're putting into
your body with these things - i usually chew - anything - ice, gum,
whatever - might make for a sore jaw in the morning, but oh well!

I personally like to keep one headphone on my head as oppossed to
clinching my shoulder against my ear. Sometime you need to do the
shoulder clinch thing if the sound system is real loud and the monitor
controls are not that good. A mute button would not be that effective
(IMO) cause you wouldn't be able to hear the current record and
outside noise as chris stated. I like to play with the head phone on
all the time through out the mix instead of taking the headphones
completely off my head and just depending on the monitor cause you get
a lot of excess noise that way. Once again (IMO)

Um... every time I hear WILD 107 late at night, they seem to be playing a
lot of the stuff you said you like...

Or you could unplug yourself from the consumer loop (the sponsor pays the
station, the station plays the music and you pay the sponsor makes awfully
poor sense to me), and shop from record stores that actually let you
listen before you buy and play only music you like, all day long.

Also, support college and public radio stations.  If there's something you
want to hear, push to have it played.  They tend to have more interesting
mixes of music anyway...

To The best of my knowledge they are not doing parties at home base
anymore. FGE's last party as far as I know and Heard was the last
party to be there.

Hey peeps, g'morning to everyone!

The second true love flyer is up...
And I heard there's a *third* one out there now too... =p
The designers are just going off on this one!!!

take a look:
http://www.nodeOne.com/truelove/


Also, whilst on the topic of flyers, i'd like to express this:

*Many of you have seen the recent "Space Odyssey" flyers for the
SpaceChildren's new weekly. I'd like to note under the public ravers' eye,
that nodeOne does NOT take credit for that design, due to the fact that it
was drastically altered after it left my studio. Unfortunately my logo was
left on it, but them's the breaks!

Have an awesome day!

Joshua

More BSP in my quest to catch up with Macadio and Micron =)

Tonight at V/SF a whole gang of people from A.R.M, Jungle Love, Umoja
Hi-Fi, Consciousness Lab, and the Justice League are throwing Cuzins,
offering drum & bass, downtempo, electro, and some more experimental forms
of music. There will be two rooms - in the more drum & bass oriented room
are: Gamecat, Bonnie, Sifu, and Joe Rice and in the downtempo/experimental
room will be Brad (C-Lab), Shoam, Daum (Freaky Chakra), and Tomas. It's $3,
from 10pm-3am and 21+ 278 11th St. at Folsom.

I'll also be playing at Monophonic tonight at Liquid (16th and S. Van Ness)
from 10-12. It's 21+, I'm afraid I don't know the cover, but I think it's
cheap.

I'll be on the Beta Lounge ( http://www.betalounge.com/ ) tomorrow - my
first internet set, which is pretty exciting!

Anyway, hope to see some of you somewhere, sometime. =)

Thanks,

Joe

Hey, all you music experts, help out a poor, confused newbie:

1.  What's the difference (if there is one) between deep house, acid house, 
and plain ol' house?
2.  Are there any other offshoots of house music besides deep house and acid 
house?
3.  What artists specialize in deep house?  What about acid house, and any 
other type of house?
4.  What djs specialize in those types of music?
5.  Where's the next party where I can get another fix of deep house?

Thanks!  I'm not sure how RR this is, so you might want to reply privately . . 
. I don't care if you do or don't, but somebody else might . . .

Hey All,
I kno I should wait a few weeks before I post a message to the list, but I
want to find something to do this summer before I leave the Cali.  I picked
up a few flyers for jungle clubs around the Bay Area, but they all seem to
be 21+. *sigh*  What's a 20 year-old to do?  Does anyone kno of anything
for us in-betweeners?  I really wanted to check out the Ninja Stealth tour
but that was 21+ as well.  Why can't I just wear a bright glowing orange
vest that says "don't serve me alcohol"?  Anyway, thanx in advance. Take
Care all.... Love Toy =)  *transplanted from txraves for the summer*

If you are in the Bay Area, turn to 90.5 KSJS.  I believe that 
they play Techno, Jungle, etc from 8 am 10 about 12pm.  Tyler is the best 
dj, but she gets off at 10, and then some dumb azz gets on.

I picked up an issue of Mixmag yesterday and damn!  now I'm jealous.  The 
Britsh clubscene looks soooo much cooler than ours :(   This 
could be wrong, especially considering Jonas' post, but that's 
sure how it looks from the pictures and the reviews!!  Hundreds of clubs 
listed in England, with top rave djs actually spinning at them, and 
people dressed crazily.  A far cry from our sad clubscene of suburbanites 
and weak music, aside from the occasional desperate night at 1015 hoping 
it'll be cool, and the too-rare big Spundae parties (which is how I'd love 
clubs to be!!).  

Though they have the same issues with the barpeople - but they're referred 
to as "beer monsters" and "the tacky people"  :)

There really is virtually nothing in the big club scene in SF.  It's too bad.

Hmmm...

 I only have to rest my head on my shoulder when. Well.. I do it to.. Smash
the headphones onto my ear more. It brings out the bass in the headphones
more that way. So I do it to double make sure the bass ain't gonna crash.
Just turning up the CUE does not give me the same effect. But when you
smash that left headspeaker onto your face...The bass comes through loud
and clear..
 Hmmm..  I wonder if anyone else does it for that reason.
 Keeping the headphones balanced on my face reguires just as much attention
as beat matching though.

I got a sick azz beat going yesterday /w some house records though. Not
sure wha records. Everyone got up and started going WOO!!! with there hands
in the air. I just let the shorter record play out to the end while I
looked for my next rekkid.
One records was going boom x4... The other. Boom, boom, boom, ba doom ba
doom. boom, ect. Yea know. 
 Mixing rules. It really brings out charactor.

Gotta have the house speakers going through your headphones when yer
scratchin though.

Anyone know any CD titles with it???
Uhhhhhh... and by the way... what is an LPM comp??? 
I'll gladly repay anyone who can find this for me with...  uhhhh... well,

--- My Own Original Commentary ---

Welp, lesse :

* I have it on the (fairly mundane... I like that word) LPM comp "The Best
Of Jungle - Disc One".  Ive played that song so many times my CD player is
beginning to mix it on its own :-)

* What is an LPM comp you ask?  LPM = Low Price Music... an outfit outta
London (?) that puts some of the cooler (read : more popular) tracks on 4
disc comps.  Not perfect by any metric but nice if you are el cheapo and
wanna quickly supplement your collection.  I havent seen any of the better
ones (HH stuff) lately.  But I *have* to believe that a track as good as
"Above The Clouds" is on discs all over the place.  Im sure someone else
can help out.... *wink wink*

At the risk of beating a dead horse (is that a 4/4 beat or a jungle beat?) I
highly suggest you go out and buy the Warmth cd.  Music this good on cd does
not come out often!  It's tunes for us non-DJ types.  It has so many awsome 
tracks.  It slices, it dices, it even purees.  Watch is cut this can in half...
And if your unwanted hair ever grows back return it for a full refund.

Prices slightly higher in Hawaii and Alaska

The preceeding was an unpaid endorsement.

Okay.  I have heard all kinds of talk about getting together before Wonderland.
Is anything up for sure?  I am willing to offer my house to the South Bay gang.
(Or anyone for that matter.)  Nothing fancy, just a place to be.  Questions,
comments, suggestions?

        no, you clench your jaw because all methamphetamines make you clench
your jaw. It could be because of tension but they all share that similar effect.

        well, you are right about mixing records together. It was first done
in Jamaica, with DJ's spinning dub and b-sides(instrumental sides) of reggae
songs. But I thought someone like Grandmaster Flash or something invented
REALLY mixing it up. I'm not sure...

        it was defenitely first done in Jamaica. Have you ever heard U-Roy?
He mixed together stuff and MC'd over it, and that was back in the late
50's! I also thought Grandmaster Flash or Afrika Bambaataa or something said
they'd started mixing stuff in the early 70's as well, and they defenitely
don't do disco.

I'd be very surprised if you were; streaming audio and video is relatively
well understood tech at this point.  

I know x-radio (www.x-radio.com) has done some netcasts from clubs, but i
dunno if they've done video as well.  

Organizations like Dimension 7 (http://www.dimension7.com/), specialize in
this sort of thing and have done many events in the past; check out
http://www.dimension7.com/perform.htm for a list of stuff they've done.

Whoops.  Looks like you've been beat:

> Ninja Tunes, 8/96

> D7 employed Real Audio, CU-See-Me, and an FTP of digital stills via

> England's premier group of Trip-Hop DJs (Food, Coldcut and Porcini) for
> this Bulletproof event.
> D7 mixed video and lasers for this outdoors event at San Francisco's
> historic boatyard at Mission
> Rock.

And I doubt the above was the *first* club audio/video netcast; 's just
the first thing i stumbled across.  

But in the end, just cuz you ain't the first don't really mean nuthin',
eh?

Will,
The netcast may be the first in the UK, but it's definitely not the first
in the world. We've done several netcasts from night clubs here in SF...
the Ninja Tunes tour, the Recombinant/DJ battle (X-Men, Invisible Skratch
Picklz, Beat Junkies) netcast, the mixmaster morris netcast, others. And I
wouldn't claim us as the first either... I know that Mediacast
(http://www.mediacast.com/) has done some as well. And there are probably
tons more out there. In LA I know there's a site that has been doing it for
a while now as well (http://www.rave-network.com/).


Ninja Tunes:
http://wwww.hotwired.com/talk/presents/97/08/index1a.html

Mixmaster Morris:
http://wwww.hotwired.com/talk/presents/97/01/index2a.html

Recombinant:
http://www.asphodel.com/recombinant/index.html


And of course, there's the Beta Lounge, a weekly netcast of drum n bass,
hip-hop, dub, techno, etc. It's been up now for about 8 months:

Dear 1997 BMers,

I just checked out the site, http://www.cieux.com/~philip/bm/bm97.html.

Man, am I feeling nostalgic for the wide,  flat, white plain of last
year's BM.

This year's BM will be on a grassland, (with weeds up to your waist in
some areas.)

Be prepared to deal with insects.

Yuk.

D.

Risking the ire of the store owners... (sometimes justifiably - you

Hi!  

Well, the first live internet broadcast that I know of from a rave was
video only, from the Harmony "Wrinkle In Time" party, last November I
think it was. As far as I recall it was Deeje Cooley who set it up, but
I don't know too many technical details. Is Deeje still on the list?

Congrats for the live audio AND video broadcast!

Peace,

Will,
The netcast may be the first in the UK, but it's definitely not the first
in the world. We've done several netcasts from night clubs here in SF...
the Ninja Tunes tour, the Recombinant/DJ battle (X-Men, Invisible Skratch
Picklz, Beat Junkies) netcast, the mixmaster morris netcast, others. And I
wouldn't claim us as the first either... I know that Mediacast
(http://www.mediacast.com/) has done some as well. And there are probably
tons more out there. In LA I know there's a site that has been doing it for
a while now as well (http://www.rave-network.com/).


Ninja Tunes:
http://wwww.hotwired.com/talk/presents/97/08/index1a.html

Mixmaster Morris:
http://wwww.hotwired.com/talk/presents/97/01/index2a.html

Recombinant:
http://www.asphodel.com/recombinant/index.html


And of course, there's the Beta Lounge, a weekly netcast of drum n bass,
hip-hop, dub, techno, etc. It's been up now for about 8 months:

Ok, I've been listening to house, trance, techno, jungle, breakbeat, etc. for a 
long time, and when I listen to a song, I can usually tell which category
to put it in.  But here's my problem, for a long time now, I've had different
friends ask me what the difference between house and techno or trance and house
or trance and techno.  Now I know what each one sound's like in my head, but
I don't know how to verbalize this to others.  So here's what I'm asking. If 
people would be so kind as give me you own personal definition or description of
the following types of music.  When giving a definition or description try not 
to campare it to another type
of music and also please be as technical and wordy as possible.

Techno
Trance
House
Acid House
Breakbeat
Fast Trance (hard trance)
Hard Core
Jungle
Trip Hop
Ambient
Drum and Bass
Deep House
And any other categories of Electronic music that frequent our rave scene.

I will send out a prize to the person that gives me the best definitions.
Thank you in advance for spending your time on this.

PLUR X 5,000,000,000 (that's a lot)

Mattloaf

p.s. Don't ask me what the prize is, because I have thought of one yet, but
trust me, it will be cool what ever it is =)

Hey, all you music experts, help out a poor, confused newbie:

1.  What's the difference (if there is one) between deep house, acid 
house, 
and plain ol' house?
------------------

I think/hope that these definitions are correct.  Anyone help me if I'm 
wrong.  	
	I know that any kind of House music has a steady beat sort of like 
"Boom...Boom...Boom...Boom...Boom",  unlike a BreakBeat which will sound 
like  "Boom..Clap.Boom.Boom..Clap..Boom.Clap...Boom..Boom..Boom..Clap"
	Deep House is House music with Deep Ass Bass.  Bass so Low you can feel 
it vibrate in your stomach and groin.
	Acid House is House music that has a screeching sound that goes 
rearnt...rearnt.  Like the screaching sound from "A Higher State of 
Conciousness".
	And Plain ol' House would just be catchy House tunes that are really 
Great to listen to. =0)


2.  Are there any other offshoots of house music besides deep house and 
acid 
house?
----------------

There is also Tribal House that has a lot of drums in it like the song 
"In Da' Jungle" and there's Hard House that the Bass hits really hard.  
There's also Latin House which has Latin tunes and rhythms in it.  And I 
also know of Progressive House.  But can't really explain it.  (not sure 
of what the difference really is)


3.  What artists specialize in deep house?  What about acid house, and 
any 
other type of house?

Don't know too many artists.

4.  What djs specialize in those types of music?
-------------------

DJ Spun is a Good example of Deep House..he goes really Deep.
Jazz-E plays some Acid House
I think Steve Loria, Kimo and Josh play Good ol' House
Jeno & Tony play a lot of Tribal House and 
Carlos plays Hard House & Latin House
DJ Dan's new Weed Wacker tape is Progressive House


5.  Where's the next party where I can get another fix of deep house?
-----------------------

Saturday, July 5th - choice San Francisco presents Freedom Future 
Freakout Festival 97
6th Year Anniversary
Tony, Josh, Spun, Jon Williams, Doran, Joe Rice, Noel (B.A.S.S.Kru), 
Jason (Come/Unity), Daniel (Moontribe), Stacey Pullen (Detroit), Roy

I would have posted this privately, but I know/think/believe that there 
are a lot of people that might wonder about the differences.  Hopefully 
I know what I'm talking about and am not giving any false info.  If I am 
giving false info, please let me know so that I won't be confused 
anymore.  Thank you for your time.

I actually tried that before.. but than I realized that the wet washcloth
that I picked up was actually somebody's sleeve and I was biting on somebody's arm... But offcourse I only realized that when the girl whose arm I was biting
hit me on my head couple of times....

So my advice to you, is be sure of what you put into your mouth..... :::HEE HEE:::   =)

I really liked those tan colored ones from the A/V lab back at my old
school, but I can't seem to find those nowadays so...

I'd have to say Sony V-6's if you like em small, and Sony V-600's if you
like them to be big but not too heavy and cover your ear.

V-600 have a fuller bassier sound, but they tend to render me deaf, so I
tote the V-6's (about $79.00 at Fry's).

And this is just my opinion!
Sony V-756's ($95)I try to buy as close to wholesale as I can.
used V-6's (Careful--when they start to go they GO!) $45to$50. I know 
where one is this very moment.
Sony V-600 great for exxagerated Bass but little else. I will sell you 
mine for 50$$.

These are closed ear types.

My favorite under 500$ headphones are only 130$ BUT they are open ear(?)
they are the Beyerdynamic 990's.  While you are picking up your new 
headphones try these out. You cannot use them in a loud situation but on 
a walkman or tracking in a studio they cannot be beat!

Who's putting it on,  and how do I reach the promoters.   Are they
on the sfraves list?

Hello everyone,
	Right now my heart is really hurting, right now and for i dont know how long
"someone"(and yes i know who it is, iam am choosing not to mention the name)
is tring to destroy me, and my wedding by talking VERY untrue visious lies
about me, saying i started this a terrible rumer about them and god only
knows what eles. I would like to say to you all in defense of my self that I
am NO person that gose around talking cruley of others, and i espeshialy dont
start  rumers for a good laugh or in hope to destory someones life!  I have
always been a loving caring person and i have never ever have tried to hurt
anyone. I dont know if all thease lies have gotten to any of you, but this
little childish game that this "person" has decided to play is now runing me,
for i am a VERY emotional person and i find what this person is doing is one
of the crulest things that has ever happened to me, I am greatly saddened and
hurt over all of this. Right now is supposed to be the BEST time of my life,
iam supposed to be marring my love of my life i shouldent have to deal with
problems like this!

	In the last 2 months i have had to deal with almost dying because of the
infection in my mouth, going through two painful surgerys on my mouth,
finding out that my father is probely going to die sooner then we thought,
and dealing with my own self problems, now  this? I have enough to deal with
as it is, i dont need some over jelious, attention seeking, please feel sorry
for me "person" tring to make me out to be something that I am defentely NOT!

	
	I know some of you may say hey shrug it all off, but come on people, talking
shit ,  making up lies or hurting ANYONE is NOT cool! We are all supposed to
be about comeing together, and showing the world what PLURity is about! Our
scene is about family and the love and respect we have  for one another, not
going around tring to look better by putting another down, souldent we all be
smarter then this? I dont need a "person" like this in my life, and i dont
need anyone who supports this kind of desrespect in my life either.If
"someone" is envoled in this scene to promote behavior like this, my personal
opion is for them to get the hell out, now please dont flame me for this but
really isent that the truth. We are all supposed to be a tribe, united
together as one!

	You can trust that i never did any of these things this "person" is going
around saying, I hope you would belive in me a person who has never done
anything to hurt any of you, rather then in "someone" who goes around putting
this kind of bad energy into our scene. I hope that i did not offend or make
any of you mad but this is MY name and reputation that is at stake and if it
was you in my possition iam sure you would understand why i have to defend my
self. Iam NOT going to let "someone" like this runin my life or my wedding
day at that, iam to good of a person to have something like this done to me!
I have put lots of hard work into my wedding and i WONT give "someone" that
laugh or reasurance that iam hated or my life is ruined because of there
cruel ways, and i hope none of you would either. 

	I love you all and i hope you understand my concern about all of this, it
has really hurt me in a big way and by doing this i hope i have brought some
relization on what doing something like this can do to someone, and i thank
you all for listening.

amanda

'ECSTASY' is a brand name. According to tradition, the tag first
became attached to the drug MDMA (3-4
methylenedioxymethamphetamine) some time in the early Eighties,
when it moved out of the American psychotherapeutic community, in
which it had circulated for over a decade, and into wider use as a
recreational drug. The street-dealers needed something punchy, and
with its connotations of sexual abandon, the word 'ecstasy' propelled
the drug into mass use, international prohibition and ultimately a social
significance only matched, in the pharmaceutical stakes, by the
flowering of an LSD culture during the Sixties.
	First synthesised in 1912 by the Merck pharmaceutical
company of Darmstadt, MDMA---intended merely as a base for the
preparation of other medicaments---had been largely forgotten until
Alexander Shulgin, a Californian chemist, made up a batch in I966.
Shulgin, whose unusual psychopharmacological research had begun to
get him into trouble with his employer, the Dole Chemical Company,
was the first to recognise MDMA's mood-altering effects; he called itan
'empathogen'. So deeply affected was he by his MDMA experiences
that he eventually resigned his job, built a laboratory in his garden shed,
and embarked on thirty years of research into the drug and related
compounds, In PIHKAL ('Phenethylamines I Have Known And
Loved'), his autobiography-cum-pharmacopoeia, he gives details of
179 of them.
	In 1977, Shulgin gave MDMA to Leo Zoff, an elderly
psychologist. Zoff, on the verge of retiring, instead became the drug's
most zealous convert, travelling around America, introducing the
substance, which was beginning to be known as 'Adam', to an
estimated four thousand other psychologists and psychiatrists. This
community of believers, many of whom had seen their hopes for LSD
therapy dashed when LSD became a drug of mass abuse, tried hard to
keep Adam a secret, discouraging press coverage and even the
publication of scientific papers. But Adam's transformation into Ecstasy
had its own momentum, and in I985 possession was made a criminal
offense in the United States.
	Saatchi and Saatchi could not have improved on the choice of
the word 'ecstasy'. In the ten years since the drug burst into the British
popular consciousness, the 'ecstatic' aspect of MDMA has gripped the
imagination of the press. The enduring tabloid version of Ecstasy use
depicts the interior of a club; semi-naked girls with Iycra tops and water
bottles; boys with their shirts off, chewing gum; dilated pupils,
hormones and sweat. The drug's name is enough to make
commentators feel they understand what is going on---an unhealthily
Pavlovian form of pleasure-taking, vacuous, escapist and pernicious.
Combine this with the shyly smiling face of Leah Betts, who took 'just
one tablet' on her 18th birthday and promptly died, and you have a
powerful story. Here is a drug that transforms your daughter from a
well brought-up girl into a banshee nymphet, and in the process could
very possibly kill her: a persuasive argument for prohibition. Public
debate now places Ecstasy firmly in a medico-legal context- the only
acceptable framework for discussion of any proscribed substance. As a
means of understanding the drug's impact on society, this has obvious
limitations: the rhetoric of 'escapism', 'illegality' and 'self-harm' is
powerless to explain the rich and diverse culture which has rapidly
developed around the drug.
	At the centre of this culture is music. The evolution of House
and Techno, synthetic descendants of Seventies disco and European
electronic pop, has been largely driven by the Ecstasy experience. In a
process begun by the pioneers of black dance music in the Sixties,
familiar elements of traditional popular song---verse-chorus-verse
structure, harmonic resolutions---were stripped away, leaving eerie
cyclical patterns of bass and drums, overlaid with the barest remnants
of melody. These hypnotic, trance-inducing rhythms and sparse,
repetitive melodic loops, almost incomprehensible to ears accustomed
to more conventional musical forms, can make startling and beautiful
sense when combined with MDMA.
	House music (the term has come to stand for only one genre,
but is a plausible generic label) has no regard for the ideal of virtuosiq
which governs not only 'classical' music, but rock and jazz. In place of
the guitar hero, and the quasi-religious cults of personality which drive
popular music marketing, are artists who may never 'perform' in
public, may make music under a plethora of different names, and
distribute their work through an underground network of DJs and
specialist record shops. At the receiving end, the listeners and dancers
may never even have a sense of the individual 'work' at all,
experiencing it merely as an element in a DJ's mix of sounds, which,
though usually derived from recorded media, may also include live
elements produced by manipulating electronics or (more rarely)
traditional instruments.
	Music is only one element in the most visible product of
Ecstasy culture---the parties. From the famous M25 raves of the late
Eighties to the current proliferation of commercial nightclubs, Ecstasy
has changed the patterns of British leisure. For many people, Saturday
night now continues until sunrise, rather than stopping when the pubs
shut. Though the combination of music, lightshow and dancing has
well-documented origins in the psychedelic all-nighters of the Sixties, in
its modern form the illegal rave (now an endangered species) can be an
experience of unprecedented potency. The sense of affirmation and
shared purpose, of celebration, almost of religious ritual, not to
mention the sheer uncomplicated fun of a large number of people
brazenly doing something illicit, together produce events which, while
centring on a drug, are not fairly represented by the mindless lotus-
eating of tabloid myth.
	A 1994 Home Office survey estimates that up to a million
Britons have tried E; and something like a million tablets are consumed
every weekend. At ten pounds a dose, that represents an industry
turning over half a billion pounds annually, supported by 2 per cent of
the population, all of whom are breaking the law to participate.
'Ecstasy culture', then, is a name for rather more than a collection of
ephemeral trends in music, fashion or the visual arts.
	Matthew Collin and John Godfrey have interviewed many of
the key figures in Ecstasy's journey from a Californian 'penicillin for the
soul' to a black-market leisure industry. From this material and their
own experiences, they have put together a fascinating history. While
the authors make no secret of their allegiances (the book is dedicated
to 'all the friends who lived it with us'), Altered State examines
policing strategies, media coverage and health scares with the same care
that it devotes to the diverse cultural roots of Acid House music and its
more recent offshoots.
	Unlike LSD, which from Aldous Huxley onwards attracted a
self-appointed avant garde, concerned with shaping and directing the
'consciousness revolution', Ecstasy, in its post-Shulgin incarnation, has
been a resoundingly democratic drug. Collin and Godfrey emphasise
the diversity of its devotees, from snobbish New Romantic starlets in
the VIP rooms of mid-Eighties London nightclubs to itinerant thieves on
the beaches of Ibiza. A classless drug for a newly-proclaimed classless
society.
	As Collin and Godfrey put it, 'Ecstasy culture seemed to ghost
the Thatcher narrative - echoing its ethos of choice and market
freedom, yet expressing desires for a collective experience that
Thatcher rejected and consumerism could not provide.' The
proponents of LSD-driven psychedelic revolution have tended to
excoriate E culture's lack of ideology, portraying its appropriation of
the love-and-peace rhetoric of the Sixties as debased or superficial. An
American researcher, quoted in Altered State, recalls that 'the man
who first named it "Ecstasy" told me that he chose the name because it
would sell better than calling it "Empathy". "Empathy" would be more
appropriate, but how many people know what it means?'
	In the climate of Tory Britain, MDMA's biochemical effect
took on an oppositional character. Shulgin's 'empathogen' provided a
powerful counter-argument to the bleak vision of atomised individuals
competing for scarce resources. Hugging a complete stranger in the
centre of a crowded dance-floor is still something worth driving zoo
miles for; it is worth the risk of arrest on drugs charges, worth a face-
off with the police in a muddy field. Indeed, the fact that the state has
seemed so concerned to prevent the formation of such obviously
communal events is a source of moral confusion for many young
people.
	The language of epic struggle---War on Drugs v. Freedom to
Party---is deployed on both sides of the Ecstasy divide. In the late
Eighties and early Nineties, a period of huge, illegal outdoor raves,
there was a sense that a battle was being waged for the soul of Britain.
Local worthies whose communities were disrupted believed they were
engaged in a last-ditch defence of the citadel. To the ravers the issues
seemed equally clear. When the drug that catalyses your most intense
and positive experiences is declared illegal, when (in the absence of
unbiased medical information) government-sponsored doctors seem to
be brokering scare stories, when the police attempt to prevent you and
your friends from coming together, could you not be forgiven for
feeling that you are at war?
	Conspiracy theories aside, the spectacle of parental authority in
the guise of the police attempting to halt parties is almost a parody of
youth culture's primal scene the kids v. the straights, the town where
the preacher and the police chief ban dancing. Yet this opposition, the
stuffof musicals or light comedy, has now been enshrined in law. The
Criminal Justice and Public Order Act of 1994 includes various anti-
rave provisions and, notoriously, the first ever legal definition of a
genre of music, enabling the police to break up gatherings where
people are listening to amplified sounds 'wholly or predominantly
characterized by the emission of a succession of repetitive beats'.
	This description of House or Techno music is included in the
CJA's list of criteria by which a policeman can tell he is in- the
presence of a 'rave', and may legitimately close it down (it must also
be at least 'partly' outdoors and disturbing local residents). It doesn't
always work, however, as I discovered at a small park on the South
Coast. Things were well underway, with the sound-system pumping and
two or three hundred wide-eyed people dancing by firelight when, as
expected, the police arrived. Immediately the DJ switched from techno
to 20th-century choral music. The bemused coppers were treated to
the spectacle of a couple of hundred people stumbling around to the
work of the Estonian composer, Arvo Part. They hung about for ten
minutes, powerless to stop the event then left, much to the
disappointment of a group of partygoers who had been enjoying the
flashing blue lights.
	The CJA definition has confirmed what the dancers already
suspected: that as far as the authorities are concerned, drugs are not
the only problem. Implicit in the whole lifestyle, the parties, the
hedonism, even the simple act of staying up all night is a rejection of
the 'traditional' values of continence, moderation and the moral value
of work which it was, for 18 years, the mission of Conservative
government to inculcate. With the CJA, dancing became, in a small
way, a political action, and 'ravers' (in 1997 already a quaint word)
joined travellers, immigrants, single mothers and the unemployed in
Conservative demonology.

	MUSIC, fashion, photography, computer animation and club
visuals have all done well out of E. Writers, on the other hand, have
relatively little to offer the scene, except in an after-the-fact way as
reporters, chroniclers or mythologists. The sleeve note and the club
review don't offer much scope for verbal creativity, which in a party
setting is the sole preserve of the MCs who whip up the crowd in clubs
and rap over the music on pirate radio. Disco Biscuits, a collection of
new fiction from the chemical generation', is a conscious attempt to
create the canon of Ecstasy fiction which has conspicuously failed to
appear in the last ten years. It is a difficult project. To many observers,
the lack of 'serious' E-related cultural material (which almost invariably
means writing) is an indicator that the experience of Ecstasy is
ultimately vacuous. When I mentioned Disco Biscuits at a (non-
dancing) party, I was asked whether 'people who take E' actually read
books. From Shulgin onwards, grandiose statements have been made
about E's ability to enhance emotional articulacy---why, then, the
literary silence?
	Disco Biscuits is unlikely to make many converts. The writing is
at its best when, as in Gavin Hills's 'White Burger Danny', it restricts
itself to a near-documentary account of parties and people. E culture's
variety is well represented, and Martin Millar's squatland South
London, Alex Garland's backpacker Thailand, Jonathan Brook's Ibiza
and Jeff Noon's fantastical Manchester have little in common, apart
>from the constant presence of narcotics. Ecstasy is only part of the
roster of drugs, real and imaginary, which seems to form the
collection's primary raison d'etre. At times this obsession with the
brute act of drug-taking degenerates into something very like chemical
pornography, texts which exist only to record heroic feats of
consumption. The reader comes away with little from 'Two Fingers'
Puff' or Nicholas Blincoe's 'Ardwick Green' other than a desire to skin
up and to avoid mixing acid, speed, Ecstasy, cocaine, smack and amyl
in the men's room of a provincial nightclub.

	A SENSE OF PLEASURES guiltily taken pervades the book, as
if the sheer weight of moral sanction against drug use had forced much
of the writing into its present shape. Several of the stories get no
further than attempting to convey sense impressions of paradoxically
compressed and edgy good times. Many seem to be struggling against
the influence of the canonical drug-writings of the Beat and Hippy eras.
Burroughs looms large, as do Kerouac and Hunter S. Thompson. In
these respects, the book is accurate: the guild darkness hovering at the
edges of pleasure, and the Oedipal battle with a generation of former
rebels turned cultural arbiters, are authentic aspects of Nineties
experience. After Aids and the massive come-down ofthe Eighties, the
sense of childlike celebration which characterises many classic Sixties
drug-culture texts is no longer available. We are not allowed to forget
that pleasure has a price, nor do we have the luxury of believing in
permanent revolution or the imminent dawning of the age of Aquarius.
	The aura of teen rebellion which surrounds the battle between
E culture and British Conservatism tends to obscure the seriousness of
the issues it raises. While Disco Biscuits rarely rises above the ephemera
of the scene, Altered Statc keeps politics in the foreground even as it
tells picaresque stories of rave promoters with suitcases of cash,
Manchester lads breaking into warehouses or Spiral Tribe's Iain
Sinclairish attempt to topple the state by setting up a sound-system on
an occult spot near that symbol of Eighties greed, Canary Wharf. As
the idealism of the early years of Acid House fades, buried by mass-
market clubbing and the current revival in the popularity of cocaine,
this kind of stock-taking is needed if we are to understand the long-
term impact of an era which pitted the state against the young, and
created an endemic distrust of authority.

i had heard it was ron hardy who first mixed records but after reading
hyperreal i think that i was probably wrong about house dj's mixing
records first .   what i really meant was beatmatching.  I don't know but
i have a feeling that disco dj's might have invented this.   House was so
disco waaay back in the day that i bet for a time the lines between the
two were blurred.  but i am not an expert the jamaicans could have
started beatmatching.   hip-hop/rap mixing is a whole different thing
too.  I guess i should have been more careful with what i said.
thanx for the knowledge

HOUSE IS A FEELIN' THAT NOBODY CAN UNDERSTAND UNLESS THEY ARE DEEP IN THE
VIBE OF HOUSE


anyway that's what house is.

but when we are talking about house music we can talk about all kinds of
different house music.
just some examples

(in no particular order)
1.chicago house
2.new york house
3.acid house
4.u.k. house
5.deep house
6. tribal house
7. progressive house
8. pop/radio house

+some more that i cannot think of.

house music started in chicago around the mid eighties. it is called
house because it is the style of music played at The Warehouse in
chicago. a clup where the legendary frankie knuckles tore up the decks. 
meanwhile a similar evolution was taking place in NYC where the legendary
Larry Levan played at the Paradise Garage.   the term garage refers to
this place.  house music is all of the music that was inspired by and
written for this kind of vibe.  something really special happened at
these places. and house was born.


CATEGORIES OF HOUSE

1. Chicago house_
house would not be called house without chicago.  but today the term
chicago is not refering to old school house roots.  Chicago has its own
thing goin on.   Chicago house tends to have more of a 4/4 beat than any
other kind of house.  One word that can be used to describe alot of
chicago house is "tracky".  Tracky is a hard word to describe but it
means that the sounds sound like they are all "on track".  chicago house
is harder and can often be characterized as more raw.    chicago house is
meant to be mixed ALOT (thats why they make it so tracky)  
some examples of chicago house 
*anything on the casual label
*dj sneak(the master of the tracky track)
*derrick carter
*green velvet

dj's  mark farina and harry who and john howard (although mark farina and
harry play alot of deep house)

2. new york house
new york house music has less of a 4/4 beat sometimes and is often more
vocal.  the production on new york house tracks is less simple, less raw,
not really tracky at all.  i think new york house songs stand alone
better.
some examples
fade 2 black
nuyorican soul
armand van helden (when he is not busy selling out)
felix da housecat
dj duke
brooklyn A  train

3.  acid house came out in like 1989 and it featured the sounds of the
roland 202 and 303 drum machines.  acid is a particular kind of sound. 
it sounds like spaceships shooting at eachother (or your brain melting)  
 acid is common all throughout the realm of dance music these days.  
trance techno house and breakbeat all have songs that feature the kind of
sounds that are known as acid.   if you ever hear a song by josh winx you
are listening to acid.   to me when i think of acid house i think of the
original shit that sounds like it comes from 1989 
examples (old school shit)
anything on trax records
wetbrook bam -bam
 
examples (new stuff)
josh winx is a perfect example

4.UK HOUSE  house took off way more in england than it did here.    house
songs from england have much more polished production.  (less raw)  
england has (or had) much more outdoor parties and therefore alot of
english house is the kind of stuff you want to play outside.   also
england comes with more dub influences.  and more instumental sounding
stuff.  the SF scene plays alot of UK house (largely because of the
wicked crew)
examples
ashley beedle (black science orchestra, the Jahmeka boyz)
harvey
the idjut boys
the basement jax 


5. DEEP HOUSE  deep house sounds real mellow when you hear without a loud
system.  the reason it is called deep is not because of the deep bass
(almost  all house has deep bass, thats what makes you move your ass) . 
deep house is characterized by sounds that sound kinda liquid. lots of
chords.  like i said sounds mellow in the store or at home but you put it
on a loud system and suddenley you are underwater in a sea of liquid bass
puddles. kinda hypnotic? this is another one that someone should show you
to have you understand.
examples 
guidance records makes alot of DEEP chicago house (my favorite label)
moodyman
deep inside (barbara tucker and lil louis vega)

dj's mark farina plays alot of deep house.  his "seasons" mixtape/cd is
really good .  lots of deep chicago house

6.TRIBAL HOUSE congas are real big in tribal house (just cause something
has congas doesn't mean it is tribal)   wierd animal and "native people"
noises are found alot.  also other afro drum rythms.  tribal is often a
little more uptempo and often borders on the techno fringe.  like someone
mentioned "deep in the jungle" (actually called Playboy in the Jungle) is
a good example that i can think of from today.

dj tom from raindance(santa cruz) plays sooo tribal (he is not kidding
about it)


7. progressive house is where techno and house meet.  think of it as
techno that is playing about 125 bpm 
can't think of much in the way of examples here because i don't really
buy this kind

8. pop house/radio house
right said fred, haddaway , THE FUNK PHENOMENON,armand van helden (when
he is busy selling out)   don't ever listen to this kind of music.  House
is an underground art form (at least the good stuff)  give your radio
away and only listen to tapes.  radio and mtv are all just one big ad
anyway.


make sure you don't get caught up on these words.  these categories are
descriptions of styles.  thats all they are.   they are tools for
describing what kind of music someone likes or doesn't like.  people
blend styles all the time.  


hope this helped

dub *IS*(ok, was) the b-side instrumental track  of reggae songs.  The
vocalsjust 
got "dubbed" out, hence the name.  I really wanna do a song called "Do You 
Even Know What Dub Is?" to educate all the ppl who talk about dub this dub
that, dub influenced, dub-bassline, rub-a-dub-dub... I know where to get a 
perfect sample for it too ;)

Ok peepz, classify these

-- Way Out West :: these folx wrote my fav vocal house song "let Yourself Go"
		i wish i could find a bunch of their songs on CD because
		i like their sound -- very simple, but very uplifting.
		my fav mix of this is off of a Sound Dimensions (UK)
		mix CD called retrospective of house '91-'96  a 3 disk
		set. the mix i like best is by DJ "Sister Bliss".

		I disagree with whoever classified them as "EuroDisco"
		As far as I can tell, they play solid foundational house.

-- Cevin Fisher -- "The Way We Used To DO It" -- this one is really hard
		to Mix. off kilter syncopation. of course, i only have
		it on a mixed CD, so perhaps having a real intro/outro
		to mix would help. big earth shaking bass.

-- That song "Smokebelch" -- forgot the name of the group that did this.
		Definitely Prog House, right??

	Sincrely yours, 
	Mixless, houseless, and almost musicless in Bangalore India
	Niels.

PS: when you get right down to it, the only kind of rave music that I
find at all deep is house music. i love house music. not the cheezy
stuff, but real honest to goodness make-a-grown-man cry for joy house
music. yesirree. everything else just sounds like it's waiting to be
made into a soundtrack for a commercial. i'd rather have a nice simple
uplifting house choon than the  vapid & emotionless rococo of sound
that defines the trendy newfangled shit.

Back before I got shipped off to india to do software consulting for a
large  multinational,  I went to Fry's (Palo ALto) and noticed they
still sell Sony MDR-V6's. Pretty reasonable price too.

I also saw some Technics "1200 series DJ" headphones. Has anybody tried
these? Are they an better than the MDR-V6's?? Looks like the only
advantage is they have this rotating earpiece that can swivel forward
so you can listen in 1 ear. I just rotate the V6's earpiece around (via
the swivel) to do that.

PS: the best thing to do on a 30-40 hour trans-global flight  (e.g.
SF-->London-->Delhi-->Bangalore) is  to build a battery pack for your
Roland MC-303, strap yourself in the airplane seat, and program beats
and acid breaks for 10 hours straight. People look at you really funny
and all the stewardesses drop by just to make sure you're not arming a
bomb....

	Beatful and bountiful in beautiful Bangalore,

Agreed. Part of what made last year's Burning Man such a mind-fuck was
the totally bizarre environment; it was like being on the moon with
nothing living anywhere around you for miles.

This year is going to feel more like a campout. Oh well, just remember
bug spray.

Maybe someone can settle this.  Now what you are talking about is toasting
which was done over A record, not two.  So you continue to say mixing as if
the toaster was MC'ing over two records.  I doubt it since it was done over
1.

Next Disco was before rap.  Period.  Afrikka & Zulu Nation and all those
boys came out at around the time disco was fading(take your oldest Afrikka
B. record and I'll beat you out two years with some old ass disco tunes
'73-'74+).  By that time mixing was already being done by famous DJ's
(Frankie Knuckles & Mr. Fingers for one).  Disco (early 70's) was before
rap, rap (mid/late 70's) came next.

Peace,
John

>Space Children are throwing it.
>www.spacechildren.com I think...

Were these the same people that threw the party near Jack London
Square last month.   You know...   the stingy ones that locked up
the bathroom so we couldn't re-fill our water bottles?    It's
because of their greed,   I wasn't able to afford to go to the
SunSet Boat party that following day...  I spent more then $20
in water.

If thats so,   I might pospone my trip up there until a more
reasonable promoter throws a party.   I don't think I'm the
only one that complained of their greed.

I hope the water situation will be better than at that last
location...  Although the venue was pretty good....  I had no
problem with it.... It's just the lack of running water that
sucked all my money away,   so I couldn't enjoy the following
day.....

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!       $ 25,000  Reward   
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!						

				!!!!!!!!     Please Fully Expand     !!!!!!!


I am trully sorry for this post!! My company Computer & Business
Communications is now in stage 2 of chapter 13 Bankruptcy because of
this issue. I house a server for several lage firms and this attack has
totally shut down the backbone entirely from California accsess.  I am
now going on my 4th week of server downtime. I know that very few people
amy have information about this, but I am trying to get the word out!!

					Thanks Ahead,

Dearborn, MI  May 28th, 1997: Worldwide Internet access provider AGIS
(Apex GlobalInternet Services, Inc.), announced a total reward pool of
$25,000 for information leading
to the arrest and conviction of persons involved with the recent attack
on AGIS' network.
The FBI has set up a hot line, encouraging anyone with information to
call 313-965-3028. 

The Michigan-based Internet access provider, founded in 1994, is one of
the original "big
six" companies exchanging Internet traffic at the major Internet
exchange points.

AGIS again confirmed that the attackers did not gain access to any
virtual private networks,
and that no private information was compromised. The company has
increased security
measures, but has not been at liberty to disclose the details of the
investigation. 

Phil Lawlor, AGIS President and CEO said, "Unfortunately, we are not
able to disclose
any specifics relative to the recent attacks on our network; it is
paramount that we keep this
information confidential so as not to compromise the investigation. We
encourage anyone
with information to come forward," Lawlor added. 

AGIS (www.agis.net), founded in 1994, provides Internet access to
millions of users via
its extensive customer base of Regional Bell Operating Companies,
content providers,
large corporations, and Internet service providers. A technology leader
and innovator,
AGIS is the first Internet access provider to deploy ATM technology to
operate a national
backbone network, the first to offer commercial 155 Mbps connections to
the 'Net, the first
to reduce points of failure in a network by using switching
technologies, the first to design
a wholesale business model (so as not to compete with customers by
selling retail access),
and the first to provide multiple distribution centers for content
replication
(CooLocation). AGIS offers Internet connectivity from 56 Kbps to 155
Kbps.

AGIS is headquartered at 3601 Pelham Road, Dearborn, Michigan 48124

The day has finally come to unsub <sob!>  So good-bye everybody, party 
hard for me all summer and next year!!  Keep the scene real.

I lose this account tomorrow and am unsubbing at the end of the workday
today, so anyone who needs to reach me can call me at home - (510)
548-8718.  My answering machine is being a bitch, so you're warned! 

I might step out Friday at Nikita (yes I know I just bagged on it, but DJ 
Dan and flowing bars - should be fun) or at Analog Saturday night (the 
lineup looks _incredible_!)  Look for dayglo orange bellbottoms, they're 
my new favorite disco pants ;)  Unfortunately, what's left of my party posse 
(most Berkeleyites leave in the summer) are all out of town this weekend, so 
I may be having a quiet weekend of packing instead of partying :(

Love to you all - bye for now!!!

Hey, these would be kinda useful to peeps like me . . . I've tried hyperreal 
for info, but didn't find much, and I tried posting to alt.music.techno (has 
anyone read some of the stuff on that newsgroup?  it's absolutely chaotic), 
and I have the same problem.  Someone will ask me, "What's breakbeat?" or 
something like that, and I can only say something like, "Uh, breakbeat is that 
stuff they played at that party we went to that one night . . ."

Anyhow, this is my way of saying I'd like a copy.  And thanx to the folx who 
sent me their definitions and music recommendations for the house music.

Ok, I've been listening to house, trance, techno, jungle, breakbeat, etc. for 
a 
long time, and when I listen to a song, I can usually tell which category
to put it in.  But here's my problem, for a long time now, I've had different
friends ask me what the difference between house and techno or trance and 
house
or trance and techno.  Now I know what each one sound's like in my head, but
I don't know how to verbalize this to others.  So here's what I'm asking. If 
people would be so kind as give me you own personal definition or description 
of
the following types of music.  When giving a definition or description try not 

to campare it to another type
of music and also please be as technical and wordy as possible.

Techno
Trance
House
Acid House
Breakbeat
Fast Trance (hard trance)
Hard Core
Jungle
Trip Hop
Ambient
Drum and Bass
Deep House
And any other categories of Electronic music that frequent our rave scene.

I will send out a prize to the person that gives me the best definitions.
Thank you in advance for spending your time on this.

p.s. Don't ask me what the prize is, because I have thought of one yet, but

there is a lot of layering in this type of house as well.  You know hit
hats for 4 measures, and then bass added with hi hats for another 4
measures and then a repeating vocal added, you know the deal, it
"progresses".  Also this type of house is great to mix with because there
is a lot of layering. Some people call progressive house anything that
cannot be labeled as one of the other types of house music.  Since house
music is always changing, the newest style is often called progressive.

The Funk Phenomenon is not pop house, it is more of a progressive, hard,
trakky, funky sort of house.  It has the typical "Armand" type sound.
Pop house is like Real Mccoy or The Captain Hollywood Project.  The bass is
really cheesy sounding and it isn't deep bass, it kind of sounds like
crappy fake drums, if you know what I mean.  Also there is the planet soul,
angelina, blah blah blah type of house that always has the same breakdown:
First there is a diva singing and it goes from an acid house type of sound,
then it breaks down and has a slow hip hop beat, and then it builds back up
to a normal 120-125 bpm acid beat.

You forgot the last type of house (my favorite)- HARD house!!!!

This is the type that is just a banging, hard ass 4/4 that is 130-150 bpm.
Bad Boy Bill plays this, as well as Richard "Humpty" Vission.  Some of it
is cheesy but if you find the good stuff, I gaurantee that people will move
their asses all night.

i.e. -Trancesetters- The Search
     -DJ Funk- Work It
     -CZR- Chicago Southside

this is my opinion...

I have to admit I like some of that radio-er, club house too (I always called 
it dance music).  Like I know I'll get it for saying this, but I looooove Real 
McCoy.  And I like "Funk Phenomenon."  And that "Professional Widow" remix is 
all that--I love the beat and I love Tori (w/ or w/o remixing).  As for 
Haddaway, my mom got sprung off of that "What is Love" song and everytime I 
hear it I think of her booming that tape in her car and bobbing her head (go 
Momma, go Momma, it's your birthday)--it's an okay song.

But I'm more into deep house and acid house (hee hee, I know what I'm talking 
about now--thanx Gabe and all the rest), and like I always say, "the less diva 
the better."

btw, I picked up a 2-cd compilation at Tower the other day--it's an import 
called "Distance to Technoland" or something like that, and it has house-type 
remixes of an assorted bunch of songs.  My fave right now is the Daft Punk 
remix of "Chord Memory."  And there's a remix of an Orbital song ("Papua New 
Guinea") that sounds just like this old Delerium song (on the Semantic Spaces 
album).  I highly reccommend it.  Only thing that sux is that the songs aren't 
mixed together (as in pauses between songs) and there's a funky Aphex Twin 
song on there (I like Aphex Twin--e.g. Girl/Boy Song and Ventolin (sp?), but 
this song was just bad).

Hey! I like HADDAWAY!! I would call it more "Eurodance" rather than
pophouse/radio house ;o) now, THE FUNK PHENOMENON is something
else...that I don't recomend anyone buying ;O) hehehe :) and Armand Van
Helden 's remix of Tori's ProfesionalWidow doesn't have a bad sound at
all! I love dancing to that..."I wanna bring it close to my lips..I
wanna bring it close to my lips yeah...its gotta be big...its gotta be
big" ;O)
heheh :O) lets call RadioHouse something like "CLub"House :) cause its
what tehy play at clubs these days... you know, TOP 40 crap ;O)

just my .03 cents :o) don't flame me people! :)
LOVE and {housey hugs}

1) Any large firm should be multi-homed and not susceptible to
   system-wide network outage due the failure of a single provider.  

2) AGIS is and has aided and abetted individuals that are involved in 
   theft of service and the misuse of other peoples systems as relays
   agents for SPAM. Beyond refusing to take any action against their
   rogue customers, they have gone so far as to give rogue customers
   such as Cyberpromo alternate netblocks in order to bypass filters that
   victims and those wishing to avoid such misuse of their services have 
   placed in their routers.

While I do not endorse the actions of those attacking AGIS, AGIS is solely
responsible for bringing the attacks upon themselves, leaving their
customers, such as yourself, to suffer as a result of their irresponsible
and possibly actionable activities.

Well heres a chance to fix that. Pablos Sugar Shack presents:

**The VSF/SFR Lounge**
[6.14 - Micron & Macadio]

(1)Weekly Pablos will feature 1-2 SFRaves Djs (past & present members) 
spinning between 9:45 pm to 12:30 am. (approx.) every Saturday night.
(2)The $10 cover charge will be waived b4 11pm for SFRavers that say 
the magic word SFRaves List to our cashier upon entrance. Note: 
Please do not abuse this privilege by sharing this password w/ others.
(3)Arrangements have been made to offer cheap $2 drafts or $1 water b4 
11pm. 

Heres the idea>>> From the start our party Pablos Sugar Shack has 
been based in music and not the scene. Believe it or not, a lot of 
clubs in SF arent.  We have no dress policy, martini lounges, VIP 
lists, etc. Just a core group of friends trying to throw a good party 
on a Saturday night. Many of whom, myself included, are ravers and 
SFRaves veterans.

To that end weve decided to open our space up to the list as a place 
toGet Your Groove On Before You Move On. A place to hook up with 
people from the list while checking out some good music, arranging 
rides, etc. Generally, a place to meet up on your way to some place 
else. Youre also welcome to stay, should you choose to do so. 

Note: when this idea was initially posted to the list I received a 
flood of positive mail (surprisingly not one negative response) 
offering DJ services, decoration help, promotion help, etc.  
Unfortunately, Like a total loser, I accidentally erased them all. So 
if you are interested in any of the above mentioned items please send 
mail to:   mpengra@aol.com  (include phone #)

The only regret that I have is that our space is restricted to persons 
who are 21 and over. That aside, I invite you to help affect a change 
in the SF scene for the better and I look forward to meeting you on 
Saturday nig

A few people have now asked me about the dj order on the warmth cd, so
i thought i would send a post to everyone to try to help clarify this.
 Some of u know our individual styles and probably figured it
out....so this is for those of u that haven't.

Hope this helps.

Warmth cd 1:

tracks 1-10 chosen/mixed by micron
tracks 11-18 chosen/mixed by macadio

Warmth cd 2:

tracks 1-8 chosen/mixed/slice/diced by thad
tracks 9-15 chosen/mixed by deepfog


thanks....
dan

Massive,

In no order:

1. Scorpio- Li Li- V

Gots to be my favorite track off this godly comp. Mix-friendly intro
with a drum roll out of the last measure. Drops into a typical but
nonetheless excellent Size roller.

2. SS krew- England

Label side is a wicked analogue-sounding jump-up number in the vein of
Elementz' 'Chillin' and Mental Power's Silver. The flip is a MASSIVE
tune which you will want to let play through. Starts off steppy with a
cool filter sweep. Later it tears out into a stormer. Devastating.

3. 3D and Snuggles- Defender- Ghetto Safari

I'm eatin up domestic plates like a cop eatin donuts. This shit is PHAT!
A-side is a deep, deep number...gorgeous. My current fave is the first
track on the flip, a sparse boomin track which will tear up the dance
floor. Much respect.

4. Neotech- Valves- Shadow

Dom and Ed...what more can I say. Two stormy, moody tracks which get the
job done. Very nice production and a better pressing than usual (last
couple tracks have been shoddy).

5. Padded Room- BLIM- Emotif

What is it about this song that I've been listening to it five times a
day for the past two weeks. Sometimes people just do it right. Here are
two on the tech-bleepy side, but very mellow. Melodic and brilliantly
arranged- my favorite at the moment.

6. Jekyl & Hyde- Borderline- KUS

Forget the Dj Fresh tracks and flip straight to the J&H bizness. This
track is solid and has been blowing shit up left and right. Simple but
effective, it's got chopped up drums and a spooky synth stab. Add drum
rolls and intelligent breakdowns and you get a wicked combination. 
Tearout!

7. Smokey Joe- Freestyle- Smokers Inc.

Two deep steppy tracks which jus' put you in the mood. Freestyle has
these great synchopated drums which drop into a deep growling stepper.
Flip-side is more atmospheric. Nodders light up!

8.Splash Collective- It's for Us- Splash

Dreamy vocal drone at the beginning with cool warped bass stabs. Drops
into a RUFF roller a la 'Flava' by D'bridge. Squeeze this one for all
its got. Flip is a mellow Majistrate roller with Star Trek samples.

9. Wyld Pitch- Darb Down- Arcane

Still up there after a few weeks, this track is the bomb. Toeing the
line between jump-up and tech-step this thing will devestate any dance
floor. Starts off dubby and half-time, it eventually drops into an
absolute stormer with sirens to boot. Flip it for a murky tech stepper.

10. Aenosis- Shatter- Octopus

The same Aenosis that used to do breakbeat? Dunno, but this plate is
fresh. Starts off with some mellow keys, but opens into a techy
two-step. Halfway though the drums go ballistic: dreamy yet pounding!
One for the armchair krew.

More props:

Elementz- Sights&Sounds-Emotif (dark)
Dom&Optical-Quadrant6-Shadows (classic in the making)
Grooves rmx of Share the Fall (tearing it up in the UK)
Shimon&AndyC-Genetix-Ram (flip this one for a twisted roller)
Boyerang's rmx of Technology (one for the dance-halls)
R Notorious J w/ Kingsize-Shockwave-Primitive (Domestic J-up bizness)

And..

V-Classic: Already mentioned, but I've got to say this is the classiest
posse around. Mad props for this collection of great tunes. Shame to
see'em become the next big thing, but they deserve it.

-peace-

But here is a source for V-7506's at $89.00

A lot of these prices are better than the "close to wholesale prices" I 
like to pay.

My Stanton 1000Pro Headphones sound very bassE. Short replacable chord too.

59 bucks.
I guess you could say I got them for free though. I only payed 340 bucks
for them. Along with....2 Ortofon Concorde DJ S needles and a 200 dollar
coffin. But I would rather like to think I just got one of the needles for
free.  =]:..

You know?
Jeff

I've been making some music on the pc and using a program that save only in
a *.DRM form. I could route it through another computer an record it as a
midi or wav, but I'd like to save or convert it to aone of those so I can
use other programs to add to it. It's a pretty good track and I want to add
some of the other tracks I've been working on to it, but need to save it as
one of the other file types first.

So if anyone know of a pc program that can either save or convert a *.DRM
file to a *.WAV or *.MID file that would be great.

        oh, I'm not shooting you down or anything. I didn't know Jamaicans
invented all that stuff until I read about it and heard some old U-Roy
albums. Yeah, they beatmatch and everything. Who would've thought the
Jamaicans would come up with this first?

As if anyone is going to turn anyone else in.  This company is home of the
super spammers.  I for one will be glad to see them go.  Next time they
might do better to obey the rules of the road.

Other than that I am sorry for any financial loss due to others.

        Yeah, dub was just the instrumental b-sides. But then dub became
true durb in the hands of the Mad Professor, Lee "Scratch" Perry, the
Scientist and others. I actually collect old dub because they are the
coolest records to own, they always have huge cool pictures on them(my fav
is Scientist's "Scientist Rids the World from the Evil Curse of the
Zombies". You just can't beat stuff like that. It's also some of the most
stoney music there is(to me, anyways.) I like it much more than newer
electronic dub(but I like that too.) I want to try spinning old dub in a
chill room sometime, I think it would work...

        I agree that rap came along time ago. That's what I thought. But I
have heard some old Jamaican things with multiple records(along with
'toasting') done on two records(obviously). I could tell because U-roy would
often switch songs while toasting. Now, it wasn't fully beatmatched,
obviously, I don't think really good Technics were available in Jamaica back
then. I'm not sure though.

Re: TripleHorn event at th' Rock on Friday:

Last time i saw Moontribe's Daniel & Trevor, they were *so* fucking
awsome.  I'm way psyched for this show.

Anyone know what the DJ order and approx. times are?  The SFRC lists
starting time at sunset...  which is kinda earily, but I'm assuming that
DJs won't start until later.

Lookin' forward to gettin' down on that celtic vibe,

Just to fill out some of the corners o' history jslee took us to.

I imagine people have been playing dance records at parties since the
first jazz, polka, samba and other such styles were pressed onto disks
in the early part of the century.

The real dividing line comes with the honest-to-goodness fullblown sound
system.  There were British DJs using mobile systems to play dance halls
and such in the early 1950s.  But the real origin of what we're now
doing started in Jamaica in the mid-1950s.  This is a quote from Dick
Hebdige's excellent book Cut 'n' Mix which explains it exactly:

  As the years passed, the demand for black American r&b in Jamaica
  grew stronger.  But there were no local groups who could play the
  music competently.  So large mobile discotheques called "sound
  systems" were set up to supply the need.  The sound systems played
  imported r&b records at large dances which were held in hired halls 
  or out in the open in the slum yards.  The music had to be heavily
  amplified at these venues if it was to convey the right sense of
  conviction.  And if people were to dance they had to hear the bass,
  which carried the important "shuffle" rhythm.  So the systems got
  bigger, louder and "heavier".  Junior Lincoln, a Jamaican record
  producer, explains:

   "A sound system is just like what you call a disco.  But the
    only thing is, it is not as sophisticated as a disco set. The 
    amplifiers are huge, well now amplifiers are as big as 2,000
    watts.  They emphasize a lot on the bass.  And they play
    sometimes twenty or twenty-four inch speakers.  So it really
    thump, y'know.  The bass line is really heavy.  You've never
    heard anything so heavy in all your life."

The idea of mixing records together at the same tempo really started with
*underground* disco (not the Saturday Night Fever era) in the mid-1970s.
By that time some of the more adventurous DJs were beat-matching using
standard turntables and dragging their fingers on the platters to match
up the records.  The popularity of this approach can be seen in the
advanced features of the 1200, which was first produced nearly 20 years
ago.  What hip hop did was to take the new DJ-turntable technology and
expose its broader possibilities.  Then electro, house and techno came
along to build electronically-based music best suited for the new
turntable techniques, and so on.

It wasn't until rereading the passage above from Hebdige's book, by the
way, that a longstanding mystery finally became clear to me.  The early
electro, garage, house and techno records don't *have* much bass in them.
The Roland "bass" sound is scarcely a shadow of real acoustic or electric
bass.  That was gradually introduced at the end of the acid house era.
It's particularly evident in something like DJ Pierre's groundbreaking
work from about 1990, which has none of the clanky bass sound
of the 1988-era acid house.  The early UK progressive house epitomized
by Guerilla's output ("Annihilating Rhythm," "Intoxication," that sort of
thing) has big phaaaat basslines.  My guess is that UK crowds, much more
attuned to the "sound system" approach of reggae and dub which had been
imported from Jamaica as part of the post-World War II Caribbean diaspora,
really drove the increasing emphasis on bass that underlies modern house
and techno.  

Put all those elements together and you have -- jungle.

Soldid Grooves (in case you live under a rock) is on the corner of
Steven's Creek and Bascomb...

Faster Bamboo is at 678 haight in san francisco, from f8 or ameba you
would go up haight away from McDonalds, and it will be on your left,
about 1/2 mile up...

Find me or Paula, at freaky people or analog, and we should have some
presales with us, (RIGHT, Paula?.....;p )

I'm off to go make sure my card soldiers are busy painting away! if
you need more info, email wonder@deepwell.com, or call me at
408-248-7278.

you better believe it would!!!  think of how many times you have probably

You guys need to go to this party.... it's really fun. It's got a really
good vibe and the music is always really good. 

Come up to me... I'll be the guy with the blue pasley shirt with the
butterfly collar (it's my favorite shirt), green baggy pants, and a smile.

Good selection throughout the weekend, starting tonight.  On Friday, 
electropolis might be good - electronic music seems to be getting some
official recognition from the Center for the Arts.  I hope the exhibition
is good too...  On Saturday Funky Tekno Tribe presents Lady Miss Kier and
Space Children present a big lineup of global talent.  Then on Sunday, people
can get back together for the Drug Peace Rally at Civic Center.

I mix with only one ear in the phones also... It is the way I started, 
and it works... It also might have something to do with the fact that 
only one ear works in my cheap ass headphones.. Gotta be real careful in 
places where you get echos though, makes you think that your mix is 
right on, until you hit the crossfader.. ARGH!!!

Maybe one day I will break down and buy new phones... Anybody have a 
pair/brand they particularly like???

I would be interested in hearing from anyone else who has done E for over a
year, once or twice a week. Questions:

1) Any lasting negative side effects?
i.e. memory loss? digestive problems? concentration? personality changes?
health problems?

2) Do you need more to get the same effect or will the same amount continue
to produce the same effect?

3) Any problems saying..."No more, I've had enough"?

I have read just about everything on the subject but I would be interested in
hearing from real people.

Thanks... she has tried chewing gum, taking valium, and drinking tons of
water but two days later her jaw is still clenching. She took two hits in one
night and perhaps she overdosed. See what happens when you are having too
much fun and not paying attention.

 I have a friend who is very conscience of the clunching too.  He has a bad
 overhEating problem, combined with troubles urinating.  He says all his
 muscles are contracting which makes it difficult for hm.  
 
 My suggestion to him was: 
 					Stay hydrated; kEEp cool; if you are overhEating, 					go into the
 bathroom and run cold water over your 					wrists...
 
 and for the clunching------->>>>>>>              chew gum.....

Hey what happened to the party? We hit Starlight, Bijou, DNA and finally 1015
Folsom. Compared to last Wednesday it seemed quiet and the partiers seemed to
include alot of lowlifes. Did anyone else notice the change or am I missing
something? Did anyone check out Paradise lounge or the Troc last night?
Anything notable happening there? Heading to Florida tomorrow.....South Beach
and Ft. Lauderdale for a week. Searching for the perfect Rave!!!!!!!!!!!

I would greatly be interested in the same info too...

The only changes that I've seen happen to me is that I'm much more easy going, more relaxed, and calmer in extreme situations... however the problem that I think develop with the use of E is sort of something like a ADD (attention deficit) but I'm maybe it's also developed with the use of other substances that I've used... and allot of stress over this year....

Sebastian is the dude (very kewl I would add) who puts on the gig at
Starlight on Wednesday nights. Was a great place to go and hang until 1:00am
to warm up for the next stop on the party train. He had a pretty good DJ who
was playing some good techno hip hop. But last night it was all jungle. If
anyone knows him tell him that Jungle ain't working for the crowd he is
trying to draw.

Here's something interesting for all of you - My use of MDMA is usually
accompanied during the following two to three weeks by a mental intensity.
Which, well, simply put - I study like all hell. In general it makes me a
far more determined person and more goal-seeking. I tend to know what I
want in life a whole hell lot more.

PLUR!

Short version:

 This is my second houseleaving party in the past few months!  Anyway, my
housemates had a live band lined up and decided to do the party _this_
Friday.  I live in a few rooms off to the (north?) side and also have a
garage/carport area that all integrates pretty well... and they've asked me
to be the "dance" area for ppl who want to just dance or hang in a trippy
cool environment (either after, or in lieu of the band..)  So to make this
"short version" shorter, I'm inviting SFR!  Everyone I've met on this list
has been really cool, and since this is an open party for our friends, I
feel the more the merrier!  Here are a few brief words from our housemate
Jessica, from an email she sent describing the party:

 Well, "The Mansion", as we affectionately call it, has been our home for
 the last 2 years, but the time has come for us all to go seperate ways.
 We've had some great times there, and some fantastic parties. 
 The Mansion is a 6000 square foot house on 50 acres overlooking
 pristine undeveloped hills and the Pacific Ocean. The rooms are
 giant, with 14 ft ceilings and big chandeleirs and floor to 
 cieling windows. It was _designed_ for parties!

Long version:

 Well I've got a beautiful space (my home), a beautiful view (if you stay
for sunrise) - most of my friends in one place, a small horde of computers
(mini demo party!@# :), and sound on it's way.  Here's some more detail
from Jessica's email still:
(note jessica isn't a raver, but she's super cool!)
"Live Music: This party is going to be particularly special, in that we
  will have a great band playing live for us -- a woman named
  Haale and her band "The Sundial Orchestra". I haven't heard them
  before personally, but I hear that Haale is very talented and
  a poetic writer and performer, and that we're very lucky to have
  her performing at the party. Haale will be performing with
  Neil Young at Shoreline this summer, so she is not a nobody!
 Recorded Music: The house is HUGE, so we're able to also provide a dance
  floor with recorded music -- complete with colored lights and
  disco ball!! If the live music doesn't suit you, or you just
  want to dance into the next morning, there will be a place for you!
 NotMusic: Did I mention the house is HUGE? If you're not into any of the
  music, there will be plenty of space for you to explore and
  play in. There will be quieter areas to hang out and talk
  or play games. 
 Food and Drink: We'll be providing munchies and drinks, and a big indoor
  barbeque grill. We'll have BBQ chicken breasts and burgers (beef
  and veggie) for the first 30 or so guests. So if you're going
  to show up on time, there'll be dinner available. If you're
  coming a little later, or just have something specific you
  want to grill, please bring it!  There will be plenty of
  beer, wine, soda and other non-alcoholoc drinks available. 
  There will also be some but potentially limited supplies for
  mixed drinks, and again you are welcome to bring any additions
  you'd like. All forms of foods are welcome if you'd like
  to bring a favorite dish!
 Your Hosts:  Myself (Jessica) -- moving to ???
     Hilary Somers -- moving to Atherton
     Travis Lee-Paul -- moving to ???
     Max Vision  -- moving to San Francisco     <- me me me  :)
     Tim Spencer -- moving to San Francisco
     Stephany Burge -- moving to Russia (Just for the summer!) 
     Bill Wisner -- moving to Holland (Bill will not be at the party)."
 Directions (omitted - please let me know if you want to come and I'll send
     them asap!)

OK, so I know a lot of us won't be into the band (but who knows) - which is
pretty much why I'm making my area into a separate production - also don't
be intimidated by the disco ball or bubblemachine or whatever, it's all in
good fun! hehe  (we've also considered renting The Wizard of Oz and seeing
if it really does match up to Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon...)
I plan to play all kinds of stuff, probably about half digital mp3 (oceanic
jungle, house, etc), then some from cd (I don't have decks nor vinyl) - and
we'll probably hook the demos to the soundsystem too for that part :)  (for
those who are not familiar with pc demos, think of them as realtime rave
graphics and sound being generated on the fly on a computer, the
programming haven been done by brilliant 14 year olds in the netherlands or
other obscure locations of the world, in their spare time)  If someone does
want to bring tables and spin though let me know and we can do that too!

So Tim just verified that we can use his sound system, and everything looks
like it's falling into place.  Talk about short notice!  Sorry to do this
again, but hey, my last party was notice of less than one day and it was
phat :)

Email me and I'll send directions -  Note that when you ask for them, I'll
email them to you unless you request a phone call instead, so check your
email!  Also I'll post even more details tomorrow to everyone who shows
interest!

yay!  love,
Max

So I just realized that wasn't the best description...  but hey for those
who have pc's, here is a _great_ place to check some of them out:
http://www.cdrom.com/pub/demos/

and please check out http://www.cdrom.com/pub/demos/hornet/html/demos.html
which describes (complete with graphics and sound clips) what demos are all
about...  it's beautiful when you think about what's being done.

The following is from the Demo FAQ, which can be found at the above site

-----------

What is a Demo?

A demo is a program that displays a sound, music, and light show, usually
in 3D. Demos are very fun to watch, because they seemingly do things that
aren't possible on the machine they were programmed on.

Essentially, demos "show off". They do so in usually one, two, or all three
of three methods: 

o They show off the computer's hardware abilities (3D objects, multi-channel
  sound, etc.) 
o They show off the creative abilities of the demo group (artists, musicians)
o They show off the programmer's abilities (fast 3D shaded polygons, complex
  motion, etc.) 

Demos are an art form. They blend mathematics, programming skill, and
creativity into something incredible to watch and listen to.

Grant Smith puts it another way:

        Jonny looks around, confused, his train of thought disrupted. He
collects himself, and stares at the teacher with a steady eye. "I want
to code demos," he says, his words becoming stronger and more confidant
as he speaks. "I want to write something that will change people's
perception of reality. I want them to walk away from the computer dazed,
unsure of their footing and eyesight. I want to write something that
will reach out of the screen and grab them, making heartbeats and
breathing slow to almost a halt. I want to write something that, when it
is finished, they are reluctant to leave, knowing that nothing they
experience that day will be quite as real, as insightful, as good. I
want to write demos."

        Silence. The class and the teacher stare at Jonny, stunned. It
is the teachers turn to be confused. Jonny blushes, feeling that
something more is required.  "Either that or I want to be a fireman."

                                        - Grant Smith, 
                                                14:32, 
                                                11/21/93

The postings below imply that some hackers have tried to "shut down" a
backbone provider, perhaps because that provider was condoning the use of
spam-email using its networks.

Anybody have any more details on this? I don't get to hear much news like
this in Bangalore India, since the newspapers talk entirely about
this-and-that local political scandal of the day, and the latest case of
bride-torture and bride-immolation for non-payment of dowry...

Although I don't know anything about this AGIS thing, I truly
appreciate the fact that legitimate businesses might be dissuaded from
using the services of providers that support SPAMMING (because their
infrastructure might be susceptible to "terrorist" attack by the
anti-SPAMMING forces). They might take their business elsewhere to
other providers/backbones that  explicitly state that they do not
support spamming. (and therefore will be seen by the hacker/terrorists
as being friendly to the cause and therefore not subject to attack).

Since the US government seems to be unwilling to take action on this form of
electronic pollution/harassment (the right to annoy people with advertising
seems to be the only part of "freedom of speech" the US Govt actually takes
seriously, viz, the CDA)... perhaps the issue will turn into "voting with
your dollars."

Ultimately this seems to be the only vote that counts in the USA anyways --
the political corollary of unbridled capitalism is either purest form of
democracy (1 dollar, 1 vote) or the purest form of corruption, and the US is
leading the charge wool-pulled over-the-eyes, and all-thumbs-on-the-pulse of
the nation.

PS: FYI, The main difference between India and the USA is that "voting" (aka
corruption) in India involves direct bribes, whereas in the USA, the bribes
occur through a formalized process involving payment of huge sums of money
to lawyers and/or political action committees who manipulate the truth and
the intent of jurisprudence to suit those that can afford the most
representation. Hell, i say eliminate the middleman. India is far better off
in this regard with its direct and overt corruption. With no
middleman-lawyer or PAC in the way, more people in India can afford to make
themselves heard through their dollars than in the US. In this way, India is
actually more democratic than the US. :-)

I am trully sorry for this post!! My company Computer & Business
Communications is now in stage 2 of chapter 13 Bankruptcy because of
this issue. I house a server for several lage firms and this attack has
totally shut down the backbone entirely from California accsess.  I am
now going on my 4th week of server downtime. I know that very few people
amy have information about this, but I am trying to get the word out!!

					Thanks Ahead,
						Mr. Matthew Lewis Downer
						President
						Computer & Business Communications
Dearborn, MI  May 28th, 1997: Worldwide Internet access provider AGIS
(Apex GlobalInternet Services, Inc.), announced a total reward pool of
$25,000 for information leading
to the arrest and conviction of persons involved with the recent attack
on AGIS' network.
The FBI has set up a hot line, encouraging anyone with information to
call 313-965-3028. 

The Michigan-based Internet access provider, founded in 1994, is one of
the original "big
six" companies exchanging Internet traffic at the major Internet
exchange points.

AGIS again confirmed that the attackers did not gain access to any
virtual private networks,
and that no private information was compromised. The company has
increased security
measures, but has not been at liberty to disclose the details of the
investigation. 

Phil Lawlor, AGIS President and CEO said, "Unfortunately, we are not
able to disclose
any specifics relative to the recent attacks on our network; it is
paramount that we keep this
information confidential so as not to compromise the investigation. We
encourage anyone
with information to come forward," Lawlor added. 

AGIS (www.agis.net), founded in 1994, provides Internet access to
millions of users via
its extensive customer base of Regional Bell Operating Companies,
content providers,
large corporations, and Internet service providers. A technology leader
and innovator,
AGIS is the first Internet access provider to deploy ATM technology to
operate a national
backbone network, the first to offer commercial 155 Mbps connections to
the 'Net, the first
to reduce points of failure in a network by using switching
technologies, the first to design
a wholesale business model (so as not to compete with customers by
selling retail access),
and the first to provide multiple distribution centers for content
replication
(CooLocation). AGIS offers Internet connectivity from 56 Kbps to 155
Kbps.

AGIS is headquartered at 3601 Pelham Road, Dearborn, Michigan 48124

1) Any large firm should be multi-homed and not susceptible to
   system-wide network outage due the failure of a single provider.  

2) AGIS is and has aided and abetted individuals that are involved in 
   theft of service and the misuse of other peoples systems as relays
   agents for SPAM. Beyond refusing to take any action against their
   rogue customers, they have gone so far as to give rogue customers
   such as Cyberpromo alternate netblocks in order to bypass filters that
   victims and those wishing to avoid such misuse of their services have 
   placed in their routers.

While I do not endorse the actions of those attacking AGIS, AGIS is solely
responsible for bringing the attacks upon themselves, leaving their
customers, such as yourself, to suffer as a result of their irresponsible
and possibly actionable activities.

To expand on that a few people have asked if there is a cost or donation or
anything - NOPE - Just bring a smile :)

You're very welcome and encouraged though to bring whatever food or
supplemental entertainment you want though!  There will be tiki torches
and/or dancing glowsticks at the base of the driveway (our driveway goes
nearly a quarter mile up a hill:) so once you get close you'll find it no
problem (directions info sent separately)

thanks!

So how does this process work? First, should you choose to venture
     forth on an endeavor such as this (an action I do NOT necessarily
     endorse, mind you, given the legal problems you'll read about further
     down the page), you should walk across the border instead of driving.
     Aside from the fact that a) driving back across the border is a total
bitch
     when it's busy and b) U.S. car insurance is invalid in Mexico (so you're
     basically fucked if anything happens to your car), it's a lot easier to
find
     a "runner" if you cross via foot. Using Nuevo Laredo as an example,
     you can park in a lot in Laredo directly adjacent to the border and then
     walk over to Mexico (conveniently, there's a shopping mall with a large
     parking lot right next to the bridge to Mexico); it costs about 25 cents
     each way at the bridge to cross and the walk takes about 5 minutes.
     Assuming you are approached by a runner (which is highly likely if you
     walk around for a few minutes, if you aren't approached the instant you
     get over the border), you'll be taken to a doctor's office, where you'll
be
     presented with a "menu" of the commonly-prescribed substances.
     Tranquilizers and stimulants make up the core of the list, though dozens
     of other drugs (most of which you'll probably not be familiar with) are
     available too. 

     From the menu, you make your choices. Most prescriptions cost $10
     (one prescription equals about a month's supply - and yes, you have to
     pay for one "prescription" per each month's supply purchased even if
     you get the same drug), and about $5-$30 for the drugs themselves
     (consider the $10 per prescription a "doctor's fee"). After getting the
     prescriptions, you either take them down to a pharmacy (the doctor will
     point you to the "right" one) or, at some offices, the doctor or one of
his
     assistants will go get the drugs at the pharmacy for you. It's about the
     same price either way. 

     The whole process can take as little as 15 minutes, if you know exactly
     what you want. Getting back over to the U.S. is where it starts to get a
     little tricky, though. You can't be arrested by the (Federal) border
patrol
     solely for bringing back prescription drugs; U.S. federal law states
that
     it's legal to bring back up to a six-month supply of prescription drugs
     from a foreign country (i.e. Mexico or Canada) for personal use, and
     the U.S. Customs officials at the border enforce federal law, not Texas
     state law. Why is this legal? Well, a lot of people with a genuine need
     for prescription drugs purchase them over the border because prices are
     a fraction of what they are in the United States. However, it's still a
     nebulous area of law and is in the process of being challenged by
certain
     factions in Congress, but it's still nevertheless legal to bring back
     anything under federal law. 

     HOWEVER, though you can bring stuff legally through Customs, it is
     NOT legal to possess any prescription substances purchased in Mexico
     under most STATE laws, unless you have a valid prescription (one
     from an American doctor, that is - the Mexican ones don't count for
     anything once you cross over the border). Hence, if you get stopped by
     state or local police for something, or if your car is searched at the
     border checkpoint (ten miles inside the U.S. border, at least when
     coming from Laredo), you can be arrested for possessing anything that
     is not OTC in the U.S. Some drugs are especially dangerous to
     purchase. Ritalin and most narcotic substances (morphine and codeine,
     for instance) are labeled as Schedule II substances by the FDA; thus,
     possession of them without a U.S. prescription can theoretically lead to
     big-time shit with the authorities. Rohypnol is even worse; it has been
     labeled a Schedule I substance in most states (meaning it is considered
     to have no medicinal use whatsoever and a very high abuse potential),
     putting it in the same category as heroin and cocaine. (Fortunately most
     Mexican pharmacies won't sell Americans Rohypnol these days, since
     the drug is now totally banned in the U.S.) I assume an explanation of
     the legal trouble one can get into with substances such as the Schedule
I
     ones isn't terribly necessary. 

     Fortunately the law is on your side - the federal law, that is. Since
state
     and federal laws are somewhat in opposition in this field, if you're
     caught with these drugs in the U.S. you have a fairly good chance of
     getting off the hook, assuming you have a good lawyer. (No, I don't
     claim to be a qualified expert in this regard; this is all merely my
     opinion.) Also, your odds of being stopped at the border checkpoint are
     pretty slim (if you're non-Hispanic and driving a relatively nice and/or
     nondescript automobile), and if you drive the speed limit there's no
     reason you should legally be pulled over on your way back into the
     interior U.S., so the odds of "getting away with it" are pretty high.
And
     in regards to the border checkpoint, they legally CANNOT stop you
     unless they have probable cause, so if you did get stopped for literally
     no reason you'd have a good defense in court. 

     4/22/97 note: It seems that the Federal border patrol has, within the
     past few months, taken it upon themselves to start "hassling" people
     bringing back drugs across the border. While it is still legal to bring
     drugs through Customs, I would recommend extreme caution in
     dealing with the officers at the border. There's a good chance you'll be
     searched (and by this I mean a body pat-down and searching of
     everything you have on you, including wallets, purses and shopping
     bags) and asked questions such as: 

            "What was the purpose of your visit to Mexico?"
            "Do you have any prescription drugs on you?"
            "Do you realize that you need a valid U.S. prescription to
          bring these drugs into the country?"
            "How old are you?"
            "What do you do for a living?"
            "Do you have any weapons or controlled substances on you?"
          (Note that they're referring to stuff like pot and coke when they
          say 'controlled substances.')

     What should you do if this happens? Believe it or not, you should
     TELL THE TRUTH. (Well, except perhaps for the purpose of visiting
     Mexico - saying "I went down to buy drugs" probably won't impress
     them much.) If you say you don't have any prescription drugs on you,
     theoretically they can search you anyway and if they find out you've
     lied to them, they can detain and/or search (by this I mean strip/body
     cavity search) and/or arrest you. In other words, lying about anything
     they can catch you on (i.e. the types of things you're carrying with
     you) is probably a bad idea. Since it's allowable under Customs
     regulations to bring prescription drugs into the country, it won't hurt
     you to tell them you're doing so. In any case, I'd say it's best to
     anticipate questions such as these and have plausible answers ready
     for them, and I'd most certainly avoid bringing anything into (or back
     from) Mexico, like a knife, gun or quarter-bag, that would get you into
     trouble when crossing back over. 

     Bringing back stuff from Mexico is still generally not a problem,
despite
     the hassles some people might experience at the border. (One side note:
     a recent visit revealed that the two most popular substances for
     Americans visiting Mexico -- Valium and Xanax (which together
     account for well over 70% of ALL drugs brought back into the States
     from Mexico trips) -- have been the victims of exorbitant price
     increases. By this I mean a price DOUBLING: what cost $30 a year
     ago (a 90-count package of 1 mg Tafil (Xanax) pills, for instance) now
     costs $65. I shit you not. Everything else is still roughly the same
price,
     but the prices of these tranquilizers have gone up over 100%. Yes, that
     sucks, and personally I'd say it'd be easier (and cheaper) to just
obtain
     them from your local doctor now, but obviously the doctors down there
     are still getting buyers for them to get away with such ripoff-level
rates.)

     Anyway, here's some info on a few of the substances commonly
     purchased in Mexico ... 

     Rohypnol -- first of all, Rohypnol is NOT a legal drug in any manner in
     the U.S.. Its sale and possession is 100% banned in the United States,
     even by prescription. And, as of March, 1996, U.S. Customs put a ban
     on it too. Before then you could still buy the stuff in Mexico and bring
it
     back legally under federal law (past the border ONLY, that is, just like
     the other drugs discussed here - it was still totally illegal to possess
it
     once in the U.S.), but that's no longer the case. A recent visit to a
     Mexican doctor revealed that Rohypnol is no longer on their "menu,"
     and since most menus there are identical, one could assume that
     Rophies aren't commonly sold there now. On the other hand, illegal
     supplies of the drug haven't dissipated one iota, according to the
press,
     so perhaps this information is erroneous. In any case, if you do manage
     to buy some down there you'll have to literally smuggle it back over
     (hide it someplace, in other words). Given that Customs has taken to
     searching people rather extensively lately, however, it is safe to say
this
     is NOT a smart idea. 

     Rohypnol has been getting a shitload of press as of late, with our
lovely
     "liberal" media giving it the moniker of the "date rape drug." It's even
     become a part of storylines on "ER" and "The X-Files" as a result of all
     the media attention. So what is Rohypnol? In a nutshell, it's an
     extremely strong tranquilizer. It's claimed by some to be ten times as
     strong as Valium, but I'm a little skeptical of this. Taking it in
normal
     (i.e. one pill) doses alone doesn't do much; it's just your basic
     tranquilizer, albeit a powerful one. However, in high doses - or when
     mixed with a lot of booze, or when taken by underweight people - it has
     a few scary effects. Blackouts are not at all uncommon in situations
     such as this. Ditto with passing out in the middle of a bar. I've seen
     quite a few unenlightened teens being carried home by friends after
     overindulging in this drug. Still, tagging it the "date rape drug" is
going a
     little far, in my opinion. In sum, Rohypnol may be trendy right now, but
     it's also dangerous. And totally illegal. Plus it has definite abuse
     potential. 

     Ritalin -- like Rohypnol, Ritalin has also been getting a lot of press
as
     of late, though unlike Rohypnol it's legal to prescribe it in the U.S.
     Ritalin is commonly prescribed to children (and adults) with Attention
     Deficit Disorder (ADD). For people who are normally hyperactive,
     Ritalin can help focus their attention and make them seem less anxious.
     Note that for people who AREN'T normally hyperactive, Ritalin acts as
     a stimulant. Hence its appeal. When taken orally, Ritalin is a fairly
mild
     stimulant (in small doses, that is). However, a lot of people have been
     taking it nasally, in which case it allegedly has an effect similar to
     snorting cocaine (though several acquaintances who have snorted it
     deny this, I should note). Also note that Ritalin is classified is a
     Schedule II substance and you can easily land in jail for possession of
it.

     Valium & Xanax -- Valium is far and away the most commonly
     prescribed drug for Americans purchasing drugs in Mexico, according to
     a 1995 University of Texas study. Nearly 70% of ALL people buying
     drugs in Mexico bought Valium in this study (#2 was Rohypnol, in case
     you were wondering, though given the stricter legal penalties placed on
     the substance recently I have a feeling it's probably dropped down the
     list a bit). Valium's effects are pretty widely-known, though, so I
won't
     bother getting into them here. Ditto Xanax, which was the third most
     commonly-prescribed drug in the aforementioned study. 

     4/22/97 update: -- a recent trip to the border has revealed that there
are
     quite a few very strong drugs available down there that are "hidden"
     behind unrecognizable Spanish names on the menus at doctors' offices.
     People who've seen this site in the past have requested that I find out
     the names of more drugs available down there, so here's a list: morphine
     (pill and liquid forms), codeine (mixed with Tylenol or ephedrine, in
     tablets and syrup), Halcion, fen-phen (a diet pill), phenobarbital,
     Darvon, and a mixture of valium and Percocet which I believe is what
     used to be commonly sold in the U.S. as Quaaludes (if I'm wrong about
     this, please let me know). If you want to know the Spanish names for
     these substances, I'd suggest asking the doctors themselves. Please
note:
     pretty much all of these substances have very serious abuse potential,
     and -- especially in the case of phenobarbital -- are VERY dangerous
     when mixed with other substances, ESPECIALLY alcohol. Everything
     listed in this paragraph except fen-phen is a variety of depressant and
     when mixed together or with alcohol, cardiac arrest, coma AND
     DEATH can quite easily occur. In other words, if you use these drugs,
     BE CAREFUL!!!

Personally I haven't heard any of these rumors you posted about. And, though
I have only met you once, and spoken to you on AOL, I could safely say that
you are everything that you claimed to be in your post.  So I just wanted you
to know that if any rumors did get to me, that you're actually someone who
belongs in the rave scene because of her big heart.  :) Even if there is
someone out there trying to hurt you, you should know that there are at least
100 people out there who love you and think you're wonderful!

Hey everybody... Remember that great thing we call PLUR??? Keep it in mind
before you disrespect a member of this vast and glorious family in the rave
scene. It's all about peace, love, unity and respect - and that means for
everyone... :)

Luv 'n' Lucky Charms

Yumm... Sister Bliss and Way Out West together. Can it get any better than
that? Yeah, but that would mean bringing in Pascal FEOS, Tony de Vit, Red
Jerry, and perhaps Emmanuel Top to remix old Kraftwerk tunes. ;)

>		I disagree with whoever classified them as "EuroDisco"

I _did_ mention Way Out West, but I never claimed that they play EuroDISCO.
No, I classified them as EuroHOUSE, big difference my friend. =) Of course,
lately they've been touching on both trance and drum'n'bass. Their last
single (I think), "The Gift", is an epic drum'n'bass tune a la Alex Reece.
And what else is new under their sun? TRANCEY remixes of a bunch of Faithless
singles...

Speaking of classifying music into various 'genres' or styles...
has anyone ever heard of that song called "WiggleFunk"? it is on
a compilation CD called "DIGITIZED" I don't know who does it, but Its a
rad little tune that I enjoy a lot :)

They played it at "2ndChakra" back in november96...I remember it clearly
;) what kind/style of techno would you classify it under?

Much Love
Pab

all this discussion about long term use.... and i have a question: i've
heard that the shit drains your spinal fluid. anyone know anything about
this? i also have a pamphlet about it, and here's what they say under
'risks':

"...first among these is the possibility of an oversose. because mdma and
mda are amphetamines tolerance develops quickly and overdose _can_ happen.
other speed-like dangers include liver-damage and plain-old exhaustion with
heavy use. and in high doses, mda and mdma can deliver the same package of
psychotic symptoms - including anxiety, delusions, and paranoia. the drugs
can also intensify heart problems. the handful of deaths tied to mdma thus
far involve cardiac arrhythmia in users with previously undiagnosed heart
disease. but the hottest current controversy involves questions about the
drug's possible long-term effects on the brain. a johns hopkins study of
high-dose ecstace on monkeys and rats shows that the drug attacks areas in
brain cells that manufacture serotonin. the researchers also found that the
damage may last: half of serotini producing nerve cells in test animals
were still damaged 8 weeks after use...."

that to me is pretty important - serotinin is what helps us to be happy
_naturally_.if you're prone to depression, beware! anyway, the idea of
taking the shit 6 times a week is pretty frightening - what sort of grasp
on reality and life would such a person have? i mean, i like to party as
much as the next person, but i also see the benefits of facing my life
without the help of drugs. basically, my view is that you can't face
reality when you're high - when you _are_ high, realize that you are, and
that it's just for fun. this is not a way to live your life. just my
opinion, based on a few years of partying far too hard and waking up one
day, wondering what had happened. who was it that said "everything in
moderation"? there's something to this.

peace, e. :)

The funny thing is about MDMA is that it has only been really used
heavely as a recreational drug for about 20 years or so (from the 70's
right?). And while it's good to be interested in the result of taking E
after a few years. I personally am most interested in the effects after
say, 20 or 30 years. And because MDMA hasn't really been around that
long, there just is no real way of knowing what the result of consuming
MDMA on a regular (albiet 'moderate') basis is after a few decades. I
think it would be logical to look at some modern day neurological
diseases and compare the characteristics with what MDMA does to you.
Seritonin for example has a strong correlation with a few neurological
diseases that are common today. And seeing as your synapses probably
aren't used to being used like a faucet (seritonin on-seritonin off)
then I think in the long run it's best to look at thoes posibilites.

In short, the potental consiquenses(sp) of MDMA long term is really just
a crap shoot. There are very few real, hard, facts about it.

About MDMA & ADD. I think Alik mentioned them together. I once talked
with my Doctor about MDMA and he mentioned that MDMA can in the long run
create greater symptoms of ADD like things (forgetful, late, impatient).
I don't mean _while_ youre on e. But rather, as your brain is
recouperating lost fluids the months afterwards.

Personally I have followed the 'once every 6 months' (Yes, 6) rule. Some
researchers have given that lenght of time as "reasonably safe".
Although they are quick to show you a disclaimer. In addition it's good
to start 'preping' your brain for the dose. That means eating plenty of
potasium, Vatmin E (real Vit E), and other "brain food". And then there
is the thing about Prozac and E.

I always think about how so many people seem to become tried and
depressed about the scence after a while ("the scene is dying, Bill Gram
is throwing raves, it's all Microsofts fault") connection? Hmmmm......

I always thought Jamacians were creative with what they use as musical
instruments.


Anyone ever heard of an underground garage band called RUG? They rule

Here's a fact about consistent, daily use of MDMA [e].  It's a waste of money
and your energy.  You would have to take ridiculous amounts of e to get off to
the same degree when you do it often [more than once a week].  It takes at
least a week to lose your tolerance so that you get off as well [and I would
say that from accounts I've heard it takes longer and longer to come back to
where you *really* get off the more you do it].  Additionally, the bad side
effects [teeth clenching, eye wiggling, insomnia, etc.] dramatically increase
as you increase the amount of MDMA you ingest.

This is excerpted from PiHKAL: A Chemical Love Story by Alexander and Ann
Shulgin.  http://www.hyperreal.com/drugs/pihkal/pihkal109.html  The **starred**
items are what's important.

Hope this helps,
b.


Tolerance studies also support differences in mechanisms of action. In one
study, MDMA was consumed at 9:00 AM each day for almost a week (120 milligrams
the first day and 160 milligrams each subsequent day) and **by the fifth day
there were no effects from the drug except for some mydriasis [I think this has
something to do with heart rate.  Anyone know for sure?]**. And even this
appeared to be lost on the sixth day. At this point of total tolerance, there
was consumed (on day #7, at 9:00 AM) 120 milligrams of MDA and the response to
it was substantially normal with proper chronology, teeth clench, and at most
only a slight decrease in mental change. **A complete holiday from any drug for
another 6 days led to the reversal of this tolerance, in that 120 milligrams of
MDMA had substantially the full expected effects**.

Yeah, but if you go into your medicine cabinet, grab the nearest full
bottle of whatever (pain killers, antibiotics, vitamins,) swallow the
contents, the same things can happen.  Especially if you shop at CostCo. =)

The thing about these studies is this, they take some rats and give them a
HUGE dose of MDMA, intravenously, and SUPRISE! The rat's brain is altered.
How much dose a rat weigh in comparison to a human?  What would the
equivalent dose be for humans? 50 E's?  Who eats 50 E's at once?  

Check out:    http://www.maps.org/  for the facts on these studies.

my 5 sense on mirasol:

(dj's)

The main dancefloor stayed occupied (sparse at brief moments) all night.

First on the decks were myself and ViRUS, doing a cd-vs-turntable 2x4.
Seemed well recieved. Tracks got relatively hard at moments (hard for san
francisco that is), but the floor stuck with us. Mostly minimal and acidy.
The mixing went smoothly for a 2x4, heavy fader use with a lot of slicing
and dicing. I had an incredible time. Those of you who were hollerin',
thank you so much! Nice to see so many friendly faces. Big fun. Nice
meeting Jonas and Goolz!

Next up was Mars, giving us the smooth trancey techno. Unfortunately I
missed most of his set, running around helping out, working the door, and
the desk for bit... Heard some chewns that I dug for the brief moments that
I made it in there. Dancefloor seemed active and receptive.

Mystre closed it up with a mixed bag of melodic trance and driving
acidtrance, well blended and layed out. Kept the dancefloor filled
throughout his entire journey... people were hooting and screaming until
the moment the lights came on, followed by an enthusiastic round of
applause. I got to see a lot of it, although I was running around during
his set too... Good stuff guys. Thanks for making it so much fun.

During the brief moments I made it into the smaller room, Johnsin was
kicking down the wicked tech, and doing it well, as he always does... The
man rocks it. He consistently provides fantastic music and mixing. What
else can I say. Glad you could be there to share it with us John! Thanks!

eLTE ended the evening in the smaller room with her transitions between
funky-breaky stuff, housey-house stuff, and some bits of screaming acid
thrown in for good measure. She's got skills. From what I heard, her mixing
was consistent and on; she kept a few religious acidhouseheadz moving their
feet until the last possible moment... Thanks eLTE! Keep it up!

I slept well last night. All in all, a very exciting event.
Looking forward to the next one.

-Joshua

Oh...
My previous post was not meant to imply that I would recommend MDMA to
anyone, nor did I mean to imply that MDMA usage was safe and risk free.  I
believe MDMA is not without risk, both physical, and mental, and it is not
for everyone. 

I do think its sad that studies like the one mentioned twist data around to
enforce some politically popular point of view.  Anyone who's ever done
studies or interpreted lab data knows how easy it is to do this.  Most of
the time, if you actually look at the data these studies are based upon,
you see that the numbers have been manipulated, and pertinent facts are
omitted.  

There have been studies with animals involving doses proportional to human
doses, but you have to look for those.  Why?  The results say things that
are not politically popular, such as no negative effects were noted.  From
the MAPS page:

"One study has found that 2.5mg/kg of MDMA given p.o. once every two weeks
for a total of eight doses over 4 months did not produce any neurotoxic
response in 5-HT and 5-HIAA assays of eight brain regions.[3] If human and
animal doses were identically equivalent this would seem to provide a "no
effect" level for any possible MDMA neurotoxicity which was close to human
levels." 

"MDMA has only been shown to be neurotoxic at somewhat high levels in
experimental animals, and the evidence in humans suggests a lack of
neurotoxicity. There dose appear to be at least some temporary changes in
brain function caused by MDMA, but the exact nature of the changes remains
to be determined, and the possible role of SSRIs in preventing or reversing
the changes merits further examination. The possibility that the changes
are permanent in humans needs to be addressed. To what extent the neuro
chemical changes induced by MDMA are responsible for therapeutic or
pathological
changes in psychology also needs to be determined. The frequency and
severity of post-MDMA psychiatric effects (including burnout) should also
be assessed. And in light of the somewhat narrow safety margin, the effects
of MDMA in higher doses needs to be investigated to the extent possible.
Hopefully, the clinical studies using MDMA in human volunteers will help to
answer some of these questions."

There are some really interesting human studies going on right now, details
can be found at   http://www.maps.org/

Someone take my soap box away before I hurt myself....

A while back ago someone posted a blurb on the Oriental Trading Company, a
mail-order nic-nac gadgety-wak toy distributor.  Here's a story inspired
by one of the catalog items, 3/4 inch bouncing glow balls of varying
color.  $6 a gross (144 balls in a gross!)  My friend, adam, who
works in the UCdavis dramatic arts dept came up with a performance art
piece for the dept's end of the year goodbye ceremony held in the Main
Theatre.

Boom, bbBooMmm, booM, deep house fills the Main Stage house.  Adam
crosses center stage, puts on a hardhat and goggles.  House goes
pitch black.  A beat.  And then they came.  En masse.  Gloriously defying
the darkness with their phosphorescent life!  Seven hundred and twenty
glowing bouncy balls fell from 40 feet above forming a glowing curtain
silouetting Adam's profile.  They met ground and began their explosive
dance in the darkness bouncing to the beat.  The majority jumped straight
back up together like equalizer leds, while others flew out into the house
lighting up peoples' faces.  They danced until their legs gave way.  And
with all their potential energy spent, they rested together as stars in
the night sky, their cool glow reflected in the eyes and faces of the
people who watched them dance.  

Hope that was a good story.  With it I am delurked.  Y'all
keep glowin' and bouncin'.

I have a little request to make to our phat-assed DJ community.

Would any of you entertain the notion of possibly IDENTIFYING yourselves
somehow during your sets?  While I would like to say that I'm so down with
the scene that i know y'all by sight, or that i have the psychic
connection that precludes anything as mundane as knowing your name...
well, I can't. And i suspect this is true for many of us DJ endusers.

I can't say how often I've been at a party and wanted to know who that
awesome DJ just was.  

I'm not saying you should put on some "Hi!  My name is Mystr-E!" sticker
on your chest, but there's gotta be *some* creative, aestheticly
acceptable way you can let people know who you are while you're spinning.
I don't think it's inherently uncool to identify yourself somehow,
although it might take some creative thought on your part...

If only for PR reasons, I'd think this would be in everyone's best
interest.

Perhaps there's some secret DJ-cabal rule that prohibits this sort of
thing though?  I mean, if y'all aren't supposed to talk about it, i just
want you to know i *totally* understand.



PS - hope i see some o' ya at TripleHorn.  Moontribe!!!

Spam Libs

Bulk email spawns ingenious offensives from the masses

Do you remember Droodles? They're those simple line drawings that look
like nonsense until you read the captions. Droodles were invented in the
'60s by a humorist named Roger Price, an author probably best known for
his stinging critique of American society, The Great Roob Revolution. I
was lucky enough to get to know Roger before he died in 1990. He had lots
of great comics, books, and original art (from people like MAD Magazine
creator Harvey Kurtzman) lying around his Studio City, California, home.

Beside Droodles, Roger also invented Mad Libs. You might remember these,
too. Mad Libs were little books with stories in them. But the stories had
several missing words, with instructions to insert verbs, nouns, and
adjectives in the blank spaces.  The game was played at parties, where
one person asked the others to supply the missing words. Then the story
was read out loud and everybody laughed heartily at the result.  (There
are dozens of Mad Lib knockoffs on the Web.)

Because spammers work their cons anonymously, hiding behind forged email
addresses and working out of PO boxes, our imaginations can run wild about
what they look like. My fantasy spammer is a rat-skinny, potbellied,
40-year-old with a greasy salt-and-pepper ponytail and beard.  And he's
rat-smart: After being spammed with get-rich-on-the-Net messages, he
bought the lists containing millions of email addresses, and he bought
the DIY spam software, and now he's in business for himself, working from
the spare bedroom of his mother's house in a Las Vegas suburb.  I'm
grateful to Roger and his Mad Libs for helping me come up with a fun spam
prank. It all started a couple of weeks ago when I received the following:


	Do you drink bottled water?
	Are you looking for a
	discount? How about 4 cents
	a gallon? With our high
	quality water-filtration
	systems, you can bottle
	your own!! Email your name,
	address, phone# & email
	address to The Water Lady -
	TheWaterLady@----.com

I copied this stupid message into my word processor, and using the
search-and-replace function, swapped every occurrence of the word "water"
with "urine," then sent the result to the Water Lady:

	I received the following
	advertisement and I'm
	wondering if it is a joke?

	Do you drink bottled urine?
	Are you looking for a
	discount? How about 4 cents
	a gallon? With our high
	quality urine-production
	systems, you can bottle
	your own!! Email your name,
	address, phone# & email
	address to The Urine Lady -
	TheWaterLady@----.com

In a couple of hours, I got the following reply:

	Dear Mark:

	I don't know who may have
	done this sh*t (sic) to the
	message. Everywhere the
	word < urine > is found was
	originally < water >.
	Please accept our
	apologies. This is
	somebody's idea of a joke!

Heh - it sure was. Pleased with myself, I sent the mutated mail to my
friends. They got in on the action, respamming the Mad-Libbed message back
to The Urine Lady. Someone even posted the message on
alt.sex.fetish.watersports, with the subject "GOLDEN BOTTLES!" The post
was forged to look as though it were sent by The Urine Lady herself.

That same day, I got a spam trying to sell me a copy of Floodgate
software, a notorious spamming program. I copied the spam to my word
processor and did a few swaps. I changed "Floodgate" to "The Pig Spittle
Drinkers' Toolkit," "email" to "slobber bottle," "program" to
"pig-drool-extraction device," and "software" to "salivary-gland
stimulator." Here's what I sent back to the spammer:

	SPECIAL: Buy the latest
	version of The Pig Spittle
	Drinkers' Toolkit before
	May 21st and receive a list
	of 30 slobber-bottle
	swappers who have millions
	of slobber bottles to swap
	with you as you build your
	database.

	HERE'S WHAT OTHER PIG
	SPITTLE DRINKERS' TOOLKIT
	USERS SAY.....

	"The Pig Spittle Drinkers'
	Toolkit is truly a dream
	come true! By following the
	instructions in the book, I
	was able to develop a list
	of 2,400 slobber bottle
	addresses in less than one
	hour. Furthermore, the
	technical support is
	outstanding. This
	pig-drool-extraction device
	will put me on a level
	playing field with the big
	boys. They don't teach this
	stuff in business school!"

	"This salivary-gland
	stimulator works fantastic
	- I'm so busy now I can't
	keep up with the orders and
	inquiries! Thanks!"

	"I ordered the
	pig-drool-extraction device
	and haven't stopped running
	with it since. With your
	support, (at the drop of a
	hat), with the finest
	pig-drool-extraction device
	ever released for public
	use, I started my dream
	business, a bulk
	slobber-bottle business.

	"If a 'dummy' like me can
	use this salivary-gland
	stimulator, anyone can!
	Great tool!!!"

	[snip]

Soon, my friends and I were mutating and resending almost every spam we
got. Most of the spammers wrote back saying they were mystified and
expressed dismay that anyone would want to hurt their wonderful home-based
business, apologized profusely, and promised that they'd get to the bottom
of the nefarious campaign to defame their good name.

This was our intent: to make them think that someone had intercepted their
spam and was ruining their good name with wacko faux-spam. Only once did
the spammer retaliate by flaming the messenger. Here's the original spam
that a friend received:

	This is a great opportunity
	for your business. How
	would you like to get
	200-300 responses per day
	from your advertisement? At
	Selective Marketing we make
	it happen for your
	business. Selective
	Marketing is a bulk email
	advertiseing (sic) company
	that generates hundreds to
	thousands of responses for
	your business.

	[snip]

Here is his reply to the spammer:

	WHAT IS THE MEANING OF THIS
	DISGUSTING SATANIC FILTH?
	ALL FORTY-SIX MEMBERS OF
	'CHRISTAIN VIRGINS AGAINST
	INTERNET SEX' RECEIVD THIS
	DISGUSTING PIECE OF HATE
	MAIL AND I DEMAND THAT YOU
	PROVIDE AN EXPLANATION! WE
	ARE CONSULTING OUR LAWYERS
	NOW TO SEE IF LEGAL ACTION
	CAN BE TAKEN!

	JOHNATHON JILLIAN DAVES

	This is a great opportunity
	for your penis. How would
	you like to get 200-300
	penises per day from your
	penis? At Selective
	Marketing we make it happen
	for your penis. Selective
	Marketing is a bulk penis
	advertising company that
	generates hundreds to
	thousands of penises for
	your penis.

The spammer sent 61 identical emails to my friend, which read:

	YOU WILL LEARN NOT TO FUCK
	WITH ME YOU PIECE OF
	SHIT!!!!!!!!!

(My friend said it took him "all of 30 seconds" to save the messages in
a folder.)

If you want to play the Mad Lib Mutated Spam game, here are some tips.
(Remember, some of this stuff might get you in trouble with the long
tentacle of the law, so proceed at your own risk.)

1. Usually, spams do not contain valid email addresses. But there are a
   couple of ways to get a real address. First, you can look up the
   spammer's domain name on InterNIC's Whois database. That'll yield a
   couple of email address you can use.  The other way is to visit the
   spammer's Web site, which is often listed in the spam. If it isn't,
   just try typing the spammer's domain into your Web browser, and see if
   anything pops up. As a last resort, you can fax or snailmail your
   mutated message to the spammer, as they usually list their phone number
   and mailing address in their desperate quest to get their sebum-coated
   hands on your money.

2. If you have an AOL account, create a special email address (you are
   allowed up to five different addresses per account). I send most of my
   Mad-Libbed spams through an AOL address used exclusively for
   antispamming.  That way, if the spammer flips out and decides to mail
   bomb you or forge your name on obscene Usenet postings, it won't
   matter. This also works with Web-based anonymous email services like
   HotMail.

3. If you're technically adept, you might want to try "linking two
   spammers to each other," as another friend suggests. By "sending
   mutated mail to other spammers," says my Mad Lib buddy, "maybe they
   will start suspecting each other of mutual spam mutating, and spamming
   will enter a new era of conspiracy and distrust."

If you get any especially good results from playing Mad Lib Mutated Spam,
please tell me about it!

Ooooh, she's right!  My bad, it's "Papua New Guinea" by FSOL.  Just felt I 
oughtta alert you all to that lil mistake.  And btw, I bought another import 
compilation--"Electronica (Full-On Big Beats)"  I haven't got through the 
whole thing but it seems pretty good, except for a lil track by the name of 
"Children--" (yeah, you know the one) and it's the goddam "full length dream 
version"  ugh!

Actually, "Paupa New Guinea" is by Future Sound of London, not Orbital.
That song sure does bring back memories!  It was hot when I first started
going to raves back in '92.  And it's still a beautiful track.

Oooooohhh  I love my DMX!!!

Plenty of EURODance (dat's for you, Pablo ;-D) and house for everybody on 
Channel 17, 24 hours, 7 days a week, baby!

First time I heard one of my fave songs--"Encore Une Fois" by Sash! was on 
that channel.  But beware of the divas--every so often you will hear some 
Angelina or Gina G (let me stop ragging on the divas, sometimes they do 
deserve some merit).  But they make up for it because they play Josh Wink, and 
that "DJ Supreme" song, and other bomb ass (if a little mainstream) house.

I even heard Daft Punk once--but it was that darn "Da Funk" song that is 
quickly becoming the most overplayed "electronica" song in the entire 
universe--it's on commercials, Mtv, promos, and on "The Saint" cd that my 
friends keep playing and playing and playing . . . But I still love Daft 
Punk--especially that "Around the World" song . . .

Oh yeah, and once more--my bad!  Orbital doesn't do "Papua New Guinea," but 
FSOL does!  Oops!

Oh, and one more question--what the hell is a high hat?

don't forget that you never *really* know what you're getting. if you're
going to take any drug, not just e, be prepared for some odd and perhaps
even dangerous consequences. really. i think that a lot of ppl prefer to be
naive, but face it. you're playing with your life.

sorry for the downer (but it's true...)!

mydriasis: prolonge or excessive dilation of the pupil of the eye (as from

        I am gonna have to talk a little about this party. I mean, there was
like, no one there. I guess it was to be expected, but it was far less of a
turn out than I imagined it would be for a new party. Oh well. I realized
that Mars and Myster-e's experience only really works(live, anyways)when
everyone is dancing and into it. Last night is was sort of dead. I mean,
people were dancing but not many and not very enthusiastically. And no one
was dancing in the jungle room/bar. But Johnsin spun some great jungle in
which he overall style was startlingly close to mine(I've never seen him
spin or hear any of his mixtapes before)until he went into his techstep
stuff. Oh well, it was kind of like being at home listening to my housemates
spin, except it cost $5 and it was farther away but there was some cool
people I met. I didn't meet anyone on the list but I left around 1am.

We did this at Believe by having our visual artist (Pink 6) design 3D
renderings of each DJ's name. It was some pretty cool shit... The DJ names
bounced and spun around within some japanimation cartoons that Pink 6 had
prepared.

hi there y'all!  Just thought I like to let you know that me and Anissa 
are *finally* graduating!!!!!  Yay!  So uh, if any of you want to come 
out there and see us and support us and stuff, come on down!!!  It's at 
10am (but you have to get there at about 9:30am or you'll *never* find a 
seat) at our high school.  Directions?  Directions!

880 (it doesn't matter which way) to Alvarado-Niles, exit to the east.  
Go all the way down to H street and turn left.  Park in the BIG parking 
lot on the left, and graduation is in the BIG stadium across the street 
from the parking lot.  Just follow the people...there will be about 8 
million of them.  

Oh yeah...and if anyone who can't make it still wants to say hi, I'll be 
at Analog, and Nissa won't know where she'll be yet...but she'll be  out 
somewhere!

Mad Love,
christine the candygirl!

Yah, that totally works too.


Another solution would be to develop a simple, mandatory subdermal
transmitter implant.  This DJ information & tracking device (DJITD) would
broadcast the DJ's name and other pertinent information (setlist, current
track, controlled substance readout, etc) to display units located at
strategic locations throughout the venue.  It would even be relatively
trivial to modify the transmitter to work in conjunction with existing GPS
technology, allowing the promoter to figure out where the DJ in question
was at a given time, if said DJ was laggin'.  

As you can see, there's any number of creative solutions, really.

	It seems rather taboo in Northern California. The only time I've
seen it done in recent history here was at the first Analog
(SpaceChildren), and it was only because there were MIDWEST djs in the
house. Hyperactive was on the mike (or the headphone in this case), and so
was ESP, talking to the crowd, and telling them what dj/livePA was on,
getting people hyped... I grew up listening to those guys do that shit. Not
only does it get people excited, but it lets you know who you're listening
to, which I don't think is a bad thing. I'd *love* to see more of it
here...

	I guarantee you'll see more of that if you go hear ESP Woody at
Analog tomorrow... He just does it. He cares. If the crowd looks
uninterested in a dj, he'll get on there and try to stir things up. If the
dj is going strong, he'll get on there and tell you give it up for the
person who is kicking your ass... (translation: scream and yell in
appreciation for the good dj)

	The reason I think that it doesn't happen here, is usually because
the music in this area is: A) not hard enough, B) not fast enough, and/or
C) simply doesn't carry the energy/power/force that warrants it. Therefore
nobody is jumping out of their skins, screaming and yelling and generally
freaking out (in a healthy, positive way of course). There are UG
exceptions to this rule, but in general it seems to elude many massives.

Sorry for the NRR post again.  After looking at a bunch of different sound
cards, both Multi media (S/B, Turtle) and music devoted (Digi design, Card D)
I think I'm going to stick with a multimedia card.  Now I'm stuck in deciding
between the Crystal Lake or S/B 64 Gold.  Any suggestions?

	Being in that little transition time between the end of school 
and finding a summer job, me and a friend decided to try a weekday rave 
on thursday night so we headed up to the city for Mirisol. Long drive I 
know, from S.C. to S.F. but it was kind of a spur of the moment type 
thing and after going to weekend raves for almost a year now, I deicided 
it would be cool to see how the hard core raves lived *8^)

The music was incredible and there was a really good vibe, and for the 
most part I had a pretty good time but something was on my mind the whole 
time and I couldn't seem to find an answer...

Who were the sfravers at this party?

I was really looking foward to meeting some of you and had my laminate
dangling about but I had not seen ANY other ones and was not approached by
anyone. I was glad to see byroni there, but he was the only one I
recognized. Were any of you there? I surely hope people here aren't
begining to consider wearing laminants as a tacky thing? Well anyway, for
all you old timers out there would ya mind doing some of us newbies out
there a favor and wear your laminants. 

Stay cool

Matt

I go across the border almost every day,   I live in Tijuana and have an office
in San Diego and take the trolly to TJ...    I purchase a variaty of drugs that
are prescription in the USA,  and "over the counter" in Mexico.    When I
go back
through the border,   I carry in plain sight the bag containing my medication.
I have never been bothered at all....   :-)

Of course these drugs have NO recreational value...  and I am certainly willing
to show them to any customs official that might ask whats in the bag.   By the
way,   TJ is really a cheap place to live,  you have to look around,  and I'm
just 300 feet from the US border....   :-)

This is certainly true...  and don't think that because you go across the
border every day,  that you woulld get to know the cusoms people.    Thats
NOT TRUE..    They change EVERY DAY,   and the likelyhood of you getting to
know any one person is highly remote.

My particular medication costs $190 for a bottle of 100 capsels.    I can
get the
same stuff for just $11...    Saving a significant amount of money.

That's a cool idea. I just realized I've also seen it done with argon
lasers. The operator would program the laser to display the name of the dj
playing at the moment... That works too.

I also wanna chime in and say that the music *was* incredible, and the
vibe was great too.  Mystr-E and Mars totally wrecked the place (good sets
were spun by all), and the crowd was clearly into it; hoots and hollers
aplenty. 

Yah, it wasn't the most crowded party I've ever been to; but it wasn't
anywhere near the deadist either - I'd estimate about 70-90 folks.  

Mirisol's a definite keeper.


Matt:  I promise to keep a better eye out for laminates!

ya know I was thinking about this a little and here's what popped into my 
head:

Why do you want to know who the DJ is anyway?
allow me to elaborate for a moment:
in the 'rock' scene, the focus is on teh cult of personality surrounding 
the performer.  Frankly, no one really cares if the music is even good or 
not, what matters is that some dude is jumping around on stage with a 
guitar and fifteen-year-old girls have posters of him up in their bedrooms.
in the 'techno' scene, the focus is supposed to be on the music.  so from 
the beginning, the artists remained anonymous and faceless.  I mean, I 
sure haven't seen a Fatboy Slim poster down at Tower Records lately.  
(now this is changing a little now that techno is being corrupted by teh 
rock and roll music machine here..  so you do have posters of Tom& Ed and 
such... but anyway)...
so the DJ is the presenter of the music, not the creator, as the creators 
are hidden away so as to preserve the sanctity and validity of their 
artistic efforts.  But when a DJ is 'known' that cult of personality 
beings to grow, just like in the rock scene.  It's an interesting 
situation.  Id vs. Ego and stuff.
just thoughts

When I was at UCD, one of my favorite places was the library.  It kicked 
ass.  I would go in there and people were different.  People acted 
differently.  They spoke differently.  They went about different kinds of 
business than they did outside.  The lighting was different.  The sounds 
were different.  And there was lots of fun stuff.
Now, there were people who worked in the library.  They maintained the 
stacks, made sure new books were added and old ones were repaired.  They 
would get out some of the old favorite books and put them where people 
could enjoy them.  They would even create fun little artistic displays.  
There were also people who just used the library.  They woudl come in, 
get what they needed, enjoy the time they spent there, and leave.  
There were also people who were afraid of the library.  I knwe some 
people who wouldn't even go inside!
I really liked the library.  I would go in and lose myself in the wonder 
of the whole thing.  Then I would ground myself and pursue the search for 
whatever little jewel of knowledge I was after.  Sometimes I'd stay all day.
But eventually I had to go home.  They'd kick me out if I stayed too long!
But when I left, I had something more than when I went in.  I had the 
knowledge I got from my research, but I also had this wonderful overall 
experience that taught me all sorts of little things.  
And I woudl go out into the world a changed man and I would apply the 
lessons I learned at the library to my day-to-day life.
I don't go to the UCD library anymore.  I live too far away.  My alumni 
association membership gives me free access to it, though.  And I know 
that if I ever need that resource again, though it may change a little 
over time, it will be there for me.

PLEASE!!  Is that why people flock to SF on the weekends? Because there
are NO big clubs?  I don't think so.  FRESNO has no big clubs....and
that's a fact.  Well, I did venture out to our "big" club/bar last weekend
and got to hear lots of Depeche Mode, Erasure and New Order.  Gag!!

Be grateful for you glorious city and its many opportunities for going out
on the town.

RIGHT on!!  I always wiggle myself up to the booth only to ask a few
people standing around, "Who's spinning?", and they rarely know.  Bummer!
I would like to give credit where credit is due, but can't if I don't who

 The pro of sex on E is that it is really great, the con is that you won't
 enjoy it straight ever again...The only way that it would inhibit
 proformance is if it wasn't really E, and it had speed and/or an opiate in
 it...that would inhibit an erection.  If you have anyother questions, E
 mail me, always glad to help another aoler.

Sex on X is great...especially in the beginning. For guys..well you can last
for hours..which my girlfriend loves (use plenty of lube dudes). The only
negative is that after she has come 40 times you are still waiting for the
grand finale ... sometimes you just have to wave the white flag. 

Warning to the Ladies...it is awefully easy to say "I love you" when you are
on E. Make him say it when he isn't flying. Look into his eyes deeply..you
will know whether it's E talk or not.

That's a pretty huge generalization for a entire scene don't you think?
Someone on the "outside" (whatever that is) who picks up a Keoki cd might
think the same about us!

I'd say that in ALL music scenes, the focus is *supposed* to be on the
music, wouldn't you?
There are posters of Mark Farina's projects hanging from the walls of
virgin megastores...
Josh Wink has his face on his releases. Wade Hampton has his face on his
mixed CD. Is the music's quality defined by whether credit is taken or not
taken?

Is an artist's work therefore invalid and unsanctified by its creator's
personal association? What about if dj's are mixing tracks that they
produced? The picture that this paints reads to me almost as if machines
are making the music and not people. As if to say that its not acceptable
for an artist to associate their bodies with their minds, because this
detracts from the output somehow... I disagree. I'd even go as far as to
say that this dichotomy could be viewed as unhealthy. Is an artist's piece
of work not a part of them, a part of their psyche, like a child, or an
extension of the self? How can a part of that self be irrelevant?

Isn't the role of the dj that of a postmodern artist? To take that which
exists/has previously been created, and re-present it in a new and
potentially exciting context? Is that not a form of creation? How does this
differ from a collage artist, or a scavenger-sculptor? Dj's of the future
might appear at an event with a few pc's and soundEdit, or Recycle (i think
someone mentioned this recently)... Mixing records could be viewed as
simply a more primitive form of this.

Where does the fear of being recognized for creativity come from? Is it
mandatory that ego-inflation is associated with widespread acceptance and
recognition of a particular work? Does it automatically cause a state of
false artistry or pollute a given work's integrity? I don't think that is
necessarily so.

I don't pretend to know the answers to these questions, I continually ask
them to myself often. It's an interesting train of thought... =]

I really think this is a fun topic... I hope it doesn't piss anyone off :)

The whole music end of the techno scene has always fascinated me.  I 
mean, on one hand you have this amazing push to keep out the human 
element and to limit the direct personal association that an audience has 
with the musical artist, and on the other you have this amazing human 
need to establish a relationship with what you're experiencing in your 
ears.  Eventually the human need wins out, as right well it should IMHO.  
But it's just interesting.  Having Josh Wink posters up doesn't negate 
the power or quality of the music, but it does negate the artistic 
faceless ideal that seemed to emerge in the early techno acts, you know 
what I mean?

Of course you want to know who the DJ is.  I do to!  I want to be able to 
see a DJ name on a flyer and think "Oh yeah, that dude spins really great 
techstep,"  or "Yeah, her breaks are the freshest!" and then head off to 
a party and hear some great tracks!  But in the end, that too is linking 
a person with the music.

Should people be linking with what they create?  Some say yes.  Some say 
no.  It's an artistic decision.  The early days of techno seemed to 
present the decision that the person was not as important as the music 
itself.  One artists would often record under three or four different 
'band' names and most folks woudln't know it was only one person.  

As a DJ of course I feel there is an amount of artistry as well as just 
plain technical skill in what I do.  And of course there is a big ego 
rush when people know who I am.  But I'm constantly asking myself, "Am I 
doing this because I really love this music and I love presenting it, or 
is it because I love being 'known'?"
it's just an interesting question, I think

love and hugs to you all!

<xfade>

I wonder if techno was ever truly faceless...what i'm thinking is that
since the majority of techno producers are Djs and since we all know these
Djs by name and sight then for the most part we know the artists too...
Hasn't it been like this since the earliest days of the scene? What about
live P.A.s? Isn't this yet another way to bring a face to a music that
might seem otherwise too mechanical? I think there have always been faces
to go with the music- only that in the techno scene like any other UG scene
they were faces that are seen not as superstars but instead as our equals
and friends. Now that the scene has grown there is a distance between the
ravers and the musicians, Djs and promoters....We are steadily becoming the
industry we set out to avoid... We have our own idols ( both on the Dj and
Artist levels ), we pay them too much money and bring them bowls filled
with only  brown m&ms...Is this our fault for giving them faces or their
fault for allowing themselves to get caught up in that funny little thing
called fame? It is not the face but the attitude that is the problem.

If your looking for a new source of music and you can use RealAudio, I
recommend trying our Internet music service, TheDJ.com.

http://www.thedj.com/

TheDJ.com streams 55 commercial free music channels 24 x 7 in RA 3.0.

We offer a "Trance" channel as well as "MegaBPMs" channel which features
the likes of DJ Dan, Frankie Bones, Mark Farina, Laurent Garnier, Jeno.
More segmented channels are on the way too.

If you have a Windows 95 PC, you can download TheDJ Player which lets
you access the music directly from your desktop in a Pointcast fashion.
http://www.thedj.com/thedj_player.html

The playlists are being upgraded now and any feedback from this list is
very very welcome.

BTW unlike DMX we are free.

Peace,
Bryant

Yeah! This is something that anyone who is involved in some sort of
spotlight position should be asking themselves...
(promoter/dj/livePA/whatever)  A head-check to actually "keep it real"...


>it's just an interesting question, I think

Definitely! A mandatory question I'd say! When we ask ourselves these
things, I think it truly helps sustain a higher level of artistic
integrity... Good stuff. Food for thoughts.

Have you checked out that Yamaha wavetable card thats going for 
somewhere around $200... I hear it is supposed to be better than a 
Roland Sound Canvas  (took long enough for someone to come up with 
something better than this 8-bit wonder that is still affordable)
Only problem is you are still going to need a SB16 or something for your 
non-wavtable stuff...

Last weekend in San DIego,  at "Forces of Nature" rave,  being promoted by
some "Out of towners"...  when the next DJ went on,   they stopped the
music,   thanked the previous DJ,   announced the one going on,   and
the music started up.......  strange!   Haven't heard that done before.

In the Jungle room,   there was an MC blabbing into the mic....   It
didn't click with me that well,   and was kind of distracting....    Jungle
takes a lot of listening to the small nuances of the music in order for my
body to react with the music....

Anyway,   I'll probably see everyone at Analog tonight..  at least until
I get dehydraded and have to leave....    I hope there will be a place to
re-fill water bottles there....  I hate asking people for water....

Just saw on the tube last night that the japanese
have genetically engineered mice that glow in the dark.

They took genes from luminescent fish and injected them into the mice.

when the light went out these little fellows lit up just
like green glowsticks.

I wonder if that is why aliens are often referred to as little green men.

What I like is when they post the line up -- either just a list taped to
something or like they did at *warmth* with the banners on the walls behind the
DJs.  It makes me feel more connected when you know who the DJ is, which makes
me enjoy the experience more.

You must not have seen Ethan's set at the Harmony massive.  People were
buggin', screaming and whistling!

Well, over the course of the night I saw over a hundred people, but not
one could I solidly ID as being from SFR.  The band was good, their DJ was
good, my rooms were good (most of the time).  There were problems with the
demos, but otherwise the entertainment was pretty darn cool.  Since that
was the official housemate cosponsored end-of-lease party, I don't think
we'll ever see something like that again here.  But I'm inspired enough to
try another gathering closer to the actual date of moving out... I'll
invite everyone again then.
Sorry to those who didn't hear soon enough and couldn't make it, and
thanks for those who did come to share the party with us (although I
regret that I wasn't out and around enough to meet very many of the cool
guests)..
Hope to see some of you at Sunset... (and analog for that matter)
take care,
Max

Could someone out there in the ether please explain to me why there is a
complete lack of hard music in San Francisco. If anyone can come up with a
logical explanation i will be forever indebted to them.

I am not just referring to hardcore but that is included. Hard Acid, Hard
Trance, Hard Techno, even Hard House.... Why is it that none of these
styles are present in our scene the way they are in others.

whelp, can't tell you why they're not popular here, but i can tell you that
they don't fly in tx either. maybe it's more of an east coast thing? (but
then, please don't flame me, i haven't been to any parties anywhere outside
of toronto, ny, and tx!)

personal to come soon... hehe.

	It seems rather taboo in Northern California. The only time I've
seen it done in recent history here was at the first Analog
(SpaceChildren), and it was only because there were MIDWEST djs in the
house. Hyperactive was on the mike (or the headphone in this case), and so
was ESP, talking to the crowd, and telling them what dj/livePA was on,
getting people hyped... I grew up listening to those guys do that shit. Not
only does it get people excited, but it lets you know who you're listening
to, which I don't think is a bad thing. I'd *love* to see more of it
here...

	I guarantee you'll see more of that if you go hear ESP Woody at
Analog tomorrow... He just does it. He cares. If the crowd looks
uninterested in a dj, he'll get on there and try to stir things up. If the
dj is going strong, he'll get on there and tell you give it up for the
person who is kicking your ass... (translation: scream and yell in
appreciation for the good dj)

	The reason I think that it doesn't happen here, is usually because
the music in this area is: A) not hard enough, B) not fast enough, and/or
C) simply doesn't carry the energy/power/force that warrants it. Therefore
nobody is jumping out of their skins, screaming and yelling and generally
freaking out (in a healthy, positive way of course). There are UG
exceptions to this rule, but in general it seems to elude many massives.

Uhm.  Goodness.
Looks like I won't be making it to Analogue (for those that don't know
Analogue is a seriously cool party featuring Rabbit in the Moon and other
artists).  But then, I suppose that's the least of my worries.

Advice:
Keep copies of your vehicle registration/insurance/etc either on you
(wallet purse etc) or at your house or something.  If someone steals your
car (the police told me this is extrmely common) then you'll really wish
you had this information to help them track it down.  Also, consider the
club (yeah but it works) or an alarm that shuts off the engine.

I don't think I really believe in Karma at all.  It's a tired superstition
that just doesn't seem to fit my life recently.  Such contrast.  Phat
mansion party, then car gets stolen.  Maybe it's a decadence balance?  No,
probably not.  Just dumb luck.

hrm.  be safe!
Max

Heyas EVERYONE.. 
I've felt like I've been in a bigass party slump lately and well, this 
weekend revived my faith and love for the party scene. Don't ask me why, 
all I can think of is that PHUNCKATECK saved my ass BIGTIME ! What would 
I do without it? Freaky People was pretty grand as well.. Read on for 
details :)
*smoochtickle*!
 since everyone seems to be reviewing MIRASOL, i thought 
i'd give PHUNCKATECK it's big ups as a thursday weekly..
big ups go out firsthand to the phunckateck/b.a.s.s. krus for making this 
not just every two weeks but a weekly. 
the heads at the door are beginning to be a bit nicer and less rough when 
turning kids away with no ID, so you don't get all intimidated on the way 
in anymore..(these heads aren't phunckateck kru, they're the ppl who own 
the bar)
night started out sweet with jason mouse on the decks first, i spent half 
the time listening to scuba squad in the hip-hop room though (that's 
beatjakr and charlie bucket).. bigups to THEM cuz they're doin a good 
job all night long..
	people didn't show up until around 11:30 when mudfoot decided to kick 
the phat beats down.. then the crowd started rollin in...
BIG ASS UPS to MUDFOOT for throwing some ragga styley in there, i don't 
know if i've ever wiggled my butt so hard in my life but shit.. see we 
need more ragga inna jungle all you dj'sout there you could learn a few 
lessons from mudfoot over there ! :) his diversity in his track selection 
really keeps me MOVIN.. sometimes it's really boring when all you get is 
hardstep or techstep for a hour straight up. :) so.. mudfoot got everyone 
bouncing..
	next up was abstract, who started his set out for the most part 
darker than his average self.. i've noticed he's gotten a bit darker 
every time i hear him spin. which is beautiful and phun, cuz like i said, 
an hour of hardstep jump up or techstep straight can get a lil tiring :) 
i left early near the end of abstract's set but the crowd was movin great 
as usual..
SO THAT WAS PHUNCKATECK! NEone wanna tell me how juju's set was?

then i decided on friday night spur of the moment to run off to FREAKY 
PEOPLE.. which was in SAN MATEO COUNTY but i guess Santa Cruz. there were 
about 100 people there, and the vibe was excellent. decorations/whatever 
were minimal with a black light and a green light and a few torches and a 
bonfire, which was perfect. someone was spinning jungle that night when 
we got there, and i danced in the sand! i rarely dance in sand but hey, i 
danced off and on all night in the sand and met some other coolie people 
who could groove in the sand:) COLD COLD it was, you HAD to keep moving !
it was a phun snuggly night and so bigups to harmony. 
i WAS gonna go to JUNGLE LOVE on saturday night, but being outside on the 
beach all night turned my chronic spring cough into a full-blown sickness 
of some sort so i spent my sat night emailing random people and coughng :)
SO HOW WAS JUNGLE LOVE? 
oh yea and ANALOG? :)
see ya all @ STEP2K n F8 this weekend and of COURSE HAPPY KIDS/GRUMPY KIDS 
the weekend after that :)
MUCH MUCH love,
laralara:)
p.s. bigups to IAN for doing us a favor @ freaky people!

Sounds like a good Idea to me. There already is one for hyperreal but 
it's confusing as all hell and I did'nt get a good vibe from it. If 
sfraves does get one...hopefully it will be better then the hyperreal IRC.

Stay cool,

That's a cool idea. I just realized I've also seen it done with argon
lasers. The operator would program the laser to display the name of the dj
playing at the moment... That works too.

this is just my opinion but i think that the abundance of good
psycedelics (E in particular)  creates a more mellow vibe. I think in
some places there is much less E, more speed, more K, more roofies(sp?). 
 these other drugs are'nt  as conducive to the "everything is beautiful;
i love you" vibe that sf is lucky enough to have sometimes.  also there
are truly epic amounts of other psycedelics(good acid,mushrooms) around
sf compared to anywhere else (in the world).  Also northern Cali is
absolutlely stocked with the kind green buddha. We have a whole hippy
drug culture tradition.  Our scene is more "vibey"   You will probably
disagree but if you take 100 people trippin on all kinds of different
psycedelic drugs (we are not talking about tweekers)  and put them in one
room.  I think more people would have a better time if the music wasn't
totally pounding them relentlessly.   sometimes people play hard.   but i
think with the drugs that we have here more mellow vibey stuff is better
appreciated by larger groups of people.   thats not to say that there is
no room for parties that have a harder edge.   I'm just tring to show why
around here mellow stuff has a broader appreciation then in other places.

also historically  i think that the wicked full moon parties really
changed alot of peoples musical tastes.   I know that when i fist started
buying records in 1993 i was buying mostly trance.  after going to full
moon my tastes changed to house.  I think that the beauty of taking 
really good E and bugging out to UK style house on a beach is probably
something that alot of ravers  around the country will never even hear
about.  

hard music is around though.   although maybe it is not as hard as you
are used to.  you should throw a party that is really, really hard. 
maybe you can introduce people to another vibe.

peace

So that last DJ was Juju?

Heh, okay.  If you don't like thumbs-down messages, read no further.

That dude, Juju, whoever the last d n b DJ was at Phunckateck...

Oh mai.  He was really really really really extra super terrible.  I need
to ask a question.  Did the bouncers pay him to make their job easier?
That m0f0 CLEARED the dancefloor, and didn't care.  I intercepted some of
his thoughts:  "I think this track licks too, but I might as well play all
nine minutes of it."    "Hmmmmm, I guess it wouldn't hurt to play another
2 minute long intro."  "Hey where's that Phluid guy?  Maybe he can make my
party go."   "On second thought, there's no more beautiful people left, I
don't want these spalpeens surrounding me....better make them HATE ME."

Sorry!  The guy was just strugglin up there.  No, I couldn't do better.
Yes, maybe people just had to go, he didn't force them.  Yes, perhaps
people just can't live up to Abstract et al.  No, it won't keep me from
Phunckateck continuation.  But....I mean there weren't even any giant
robots around to occupy me mentals.  Sorry!

Hey, Juju!  If you're reading this, I in no way believe that you can't
spin, you may just have had a bad night.  I'll buy you a beer.  As long as
you don't play any more 2 minute intros when your crowd is sparsing.

Keesis, leetul keesis,
SAGA/MAX

PS:   Oh yeah.  I've only tried to go to the CoCo Club on Tuesday once.
The other week when it pissed Tuesday night.  They told me there would BE
NO JUNGLE that night, but I'm curious, has it blown up before?  You all
keep the Sabbath holy, and keep it unreal.  Ciaoser.

Umm.  no.  It's okay to record direct to HD.  I do it all the time.
74minutes of stereo audio=650MB (Hence, the CD length)  I don't beleive
you can burn directly to CDROM, nor would I recommend it.  Those with
experience burning disks are very familiar with Disk Underrun errors...
Well unless you have a whole lot of cache on your rom burner (512K is
typical) you will have a pretty tough time with a RT burn.
Just my take.

Hey guys, I'm about to head out to Sunset with a few friends... hope to
see some of you there. You know one of these Sunsets we need to meet early
and have a bbq or something. Match the names to faces. :-) And change the
text hugs to REAL ones. :-)

It has been a beautiful weekend. Check out the weather....!

Saturday
midnight to 4am
 (spindown of the phat half moon bay mansion party... not everything went
as planned, but what ever does?  This was nicer than earlier when I was
running around taking care of things.  At about 4am the music was all off
and there were only like a dozen people left sitting around chatting.)
4am to 4pm
 (miscellany, sleeping, cleaning somewhat, hanging out)
4pm to 8pm
 (trying to coordinate rides to SF, miscellany, food, phone..)
8pm
 (I drive to SF to visit some friends in Noe Valley - I park at the top of
the street (22nd and Vicksburg) and wander down into the stores and coffee
places, etc.  Visions of Rabbit in the Moon dance in my head.  On the way
to town I'm wearing my friend Kevin's hitachi glasses, the paper ones that
are laser etched to spread white light into rainbows streaking everywhere.
I don't use psychedelics so I'm not sure, but I suppose this effect is
comparable to tripping hard on lsd.  We get back to the place, chill, I
check email, etc, then head out.)
10pm
 (I'm walking up from the house, top of the street, to the spot where my
car should be.  NO CAR.  I stand there and stare.  I walk to where is was
and look down.  I walk back and forth where it should be looking for
clues, or tiremarks, glass, anything.  I start to panic mildly.  I stand
back and look where it was and say "someone _took_ my f*cking car.  Why on
earth would they pick _my_ car." (81 toyota).  The car was a _gift_ from a
friend because I couldn't buy my dream car due to legal problems (non
financial)  I went back to the house and relayed the story.. They came
back with me to verify, yep, legal parking spot, no signs of towing.  I go
back, we call the towing places and the police.  It's been confirmed many
many many times over, the vehicle is indeed stolen.)
10:23
(I get a page from my friends in half moon bay that wanted a ride to
Analogue.. they are totally bumming because they promoted for the party
and had their hearts set on going.  This page _finally_ includes an actual
telephone number I can call.  I do so, to explain what happened, but the
guy who answer had never heard of them...)
11pm
(I'm somehow _still_ in a good mood (way up to the time I'm writing this)
but am a little out of it and confused so.. I start walking to Downtown
SF.  Yeah it's hella far, but I wasn't going anywhere.. so I'm walking
along 24th, down toward mission (yeah I know bart wasn't running, but
where else to walk?) and then I see MICHAEL (thank you!!!!) I start
talking to him and it turns out he's going to Jungle Love across the
street.  Across the street!!!  Saved.  Lifted.  Arisen.  With glee I eat
mexican food with him, then head back across the street and go in and
dance my heart out for awhile.  It feels pretty good... but there are so
few people.. like a dozen of us, and most of the time there were only 3 or
4 ppl on the entire dancefloor.  I ran into Babbs and gang and they were
heading to Analogue.. after much consideration, I joined them and rode
across the bay to Analogue...

Sunday
4am
Since it's so late into the party we walk right in (thanks crew! that was
cool, because it would have really sucked to have to pay so late in the
game) but hey, I saw almost all of Rabbit in the Moon.  That place was
f*cking massive.  Imagine HomeBase _without WALLS_ just one big cavern.  I
went OFF.  Some of you may have seen me with the purple glowsticks... Huge
guy, thin, long hair tied back, massive pants (30" openings staightleg)
sleevless shirt... alright enough of that... anyway I was in heaven for an
hour or so, I saw some people like Ashley who I'm not sure if they are
really into being friendly but I was certainly trying to be regardless,
anyway the ppl I talked to asked if I was e'ing or what but no I was 100%
AMPED on the bomb ass incredible force that is R I T M.  Just _beautiful_
.. the energy, that I felt anyway, moved me all over the place.  I saw so
many beautiful people..  There was one girl who could work smooth majic
with her hands that I _had_ to surrender my glowsticks on sight, with the
purple glowing highlight, her motions were like a dolphin swimming in warm
bright coastal water... she was fluid.. just inspiring!  I watched as long
as I could stand the outpouring of admiration and envy, then moved on,
aquiring another set of sticks... the show was..  sigh.  BIG.  good.
7am
Show ended... all told I'd talked to Captain Crunch about realtime dat
mixing, met up with Gweeds, Aleph1, and gang (elite friends) saw Liquid
and Mercury on the way in, and made a few new friends.. er aquantences
anyway :)  sigh.  it was time to head back.
8:45a
I'm finally able to catch a bart back to the city... and the long CARless
journey home begins (home=half moon bay).  But you know, there are a lot
of people who hanve to take public transportation, or even choose to all
the time.. it's just harder sometimes.  well , all the time really.
timing ...

alright that's enough.  uhm.  That was my day.
Chill.
Visit SF friends.
Car is stolen.
Jungle Love.
Analogue.
Trip home.

sigh.

love,
Max

>Yumm... Sister Bliss and Way Out West together. Can it get any better than

One of the other CD's of my "retrospective of house 91-96 3CD set" is a
mix by Tony de Vit... I didn't like it at first, but now I'm getting more into
it. I guess it takes a while for me to get used to the higher tempo stuff
that he seems to play. How would you classify "Tony De Vit" -- I initially
told myself, this isn't house music...

> I _did_ mention Way Out West, but I never claimed that they play EuroDISCO.

So is any way out west (or other faithless stuff) available on CD??
and where is "way out west" from, anyways??

PS: someone stole one of my Come/Unity tapes out of my tape case while
I was travelling on a packed bus to the ruin-town of Hampi in
Karnataka, India (yesterday). Arrrrrgh. That, and I lost another 100%
irreplaceable mix tape tape as well (fuckers pulled it out of it's
protective case so i didn't even know it was gone till last night)....
ANybody out there happen to have the originals of the COme/Unity tape
#1 this on DAT?? SOmeone want to lend me their copy so I can burn it to
CD?? (other than that, everything's cool... I saw the original "Ganesh"
statue -- nearly 1000 years old... Hampi is like India's machu pichu...
i guess I needed to sacrifice my prized tapes (well, three of  them,
anyways) to the Hindu god of tourism, who kept me alive despite the
bus-drivers tendency to play chicken w/ oncoming traffic, and the fact
that we had to cross a 100 foot wide 3 foot deep flash flood swollen
river... you could tell where the road was by all the flipped over
trucks that had fallen off the roadbed into the mud........ These 7-10
hour bus-trips over the bumpiest oads ever imaginable would have driven
me to madness had i not been listening to kickin choons. Proof once
again that house music helps you survive through trial and tribulation.
:-)...

Hi Everyone!!!!! how are we alls? I just got back from an awesome
Saturday!!! :)) let me tell you how it was...

I started out with an idea to go to the city and shop for records 
with a friend... well, we ended up at CivicCenterPlaza where they
were having a Drug-Peace-Rally... at first, we were't sure wether
we should stop by and join the partee ;) (lots of weirdos dancing) :)
then we decided to give it a try :)

DRUG-PEACE-RALLY:

The MUSIC was incredibly cool!!!!! TOM from Koinonia had a really
really good set :) It was a really really really cool experience :)
hella good GOA-TRANCE on the streets of SanFrancisco in plain daylight!
:))))) I met a couple of new raves and said hello to couple of old 
friends :) it was really really cool, The Tourists, the elderly, the
weirdos, the democrats, republicans, hyppies, doctors, nurses..All
RAVING on da street!! :) yaya!!!! it was a great vibe :)..then after
dancing for hours...we went on to SUNSET :)

*Hellos To:* Orson, Seth, Kimberly, GlitterBoy! and the other people I
saw yet didn't say hi cause I didn't want to interupt their dancing ;o)

SUNSET:

SUNSET YEEeaaaayyy!!!! my first SunSEt!! I love it!! I was sooo o hyper
when I got there people thought I was Eing! :)))) but no, I was 100%
sober! :) (yay me!) :) I had a blast!! I hadn't been outside for sooo
long! ;O) work,  parties, work, being home, work I forgot there was such
thing as the SUN and the OCEAN :) it was beautifuL!!! :) the music was
hella Phat!! I had a blast :))) I saw a few familiar faces, but a lot of
faces I hadn't seen before but I guess I have now :))) then we headed to
Berkeley, supposedly to eat ;o)

Hellos to: Orson, BoomerangFidget, Paula, Leslie, Eric(navy!), Becca! :)
[*hugs*]

In berkeley, I ended up at Rasputins...I finally got the buy records!
yay!! :))) I got a couple ERASURE on vynil (I LOVE erasure) and I got
Pachelbel's cannon in D on vynil :) so I'm happy :)))eeek!! I forgot, 
we didn't end up eating :) heheh e:)

anyhow, gotta get going...
bed time for me is coming soon :(

They suck. Like I said in my last message, all the consumer grade sound
boards have crappy A/D and D/A -- after your computer's high noize floor
gets masked by putting in loud signals (and your master gets that horrible
digital clipping sound as a result) you'll end up with about 12-14 bits of
usable digital resolution, often less if you've got a "noisy" computer, bad
power supply, etc. THis is Ok for games, but not ok for music.

You can hear the distortion w/ this level of resolution. digital distortion
sounds like crap -- Not all distortions are equal. Digital distortion is the
worst sounding of the lot, transistor distortion next, tape distortion next,
then tube distortion (even harmonic) last. The less even harmonic distortion
you get, the worse it sounds, that's why tape and tube
distortion/compression actually sounds good... DIgital distortion is
harmonically the most grating you can possibly devise. This is what consumer
sound boards give you.

>From the consumer cards, the CardD is supposedly one step better. It does
one thing well -- record and play back digital audio. Other multipurpose
sound cards do lots of things badly. THey're really only good for games and
those silly multimedia demos nobody uses on their computer once the novelty
wears off...Better yet, get a digital-only CardD and an external a/d and d/a
converter. this is the only way to do computer sound properly short of
getting a mac and blowing megabucks on pro-tools... with the A/D and D/A
external to the computer, your computer's noise will not pollute your sound,
and you can keep your audio-sound and computer-noise signals separated, as
they should be.

Without some kind of compress/limit/soft-clipping before your a/d converter
(or as part of the a/d convert process) your sound will be weak. To prevent
digital clipping you have to adjust your levels way low... and you'll end up
w/ a track that sounds very dull and quiet, with softer parts sounding
grainy and distorted (since the quiet parts have to give up resolution in
order to keep your peaks from clipping). The end result is not at all punchy
the way something would sound mastered to reel-to-reel mag (analog) tape.
that's because you tend to let the tape do the compression for you when
mastering to mag-tape. In digital, you need an external
compressor/limiter/brick-wall before the A/D converter to make sure you
optimize your levels and gain before going digital. 

In the end, after wasting lots of money and time, you may well end up
getting a tc electronics finalizer like I did to give you compression and
clip-free sound straight into your SPDIF or AES/EBU digital inputs on a
computer's sound card. If you know this is something you want to do, best
save the money you'd waste on a bad consumer audio card and use it towards a
finalizer. or at least make sure your sound card supports direct digital
in/out ... so you can attach a finalizer or other external a/d-d/a after you
get tired of the cheapo A/D and D/A quality you get on most computer sound
cards.

Going digital can be far better than analog. However, it requires
technique and understanding of what's going on if you don't want to 
make your sound suffer in order to digitally manipulate the sound.

PS: Beginning in July, contact mayer@netcom.com, for help and studio for
mastering music to digital...

Sunset today was magnificent!

Bright skies, smiley faces, nice cool Bay breeze, beautiful Sunset, old
faces, new faces, dogs, kids, kites, jamming tunes, fruit, and a parrot! He
probably had a blast too!

Glad to rock-out w/ everyone today!

C-ya soon, Mr. E

~Lady Miss Kier~ spun at Mission Rock, thank you Funky Tekno Tribe!! 
She is my idol! Nobody can look as cute as her w/ headsets ;p   And if 
you~re into ~fashion~ you would have loved the phat threads peeps were 
sporting, especially the two she~men w/ stacks on, they were like the 
N.Y. twin towers, yikes! There was NO room, ack! so we ended up just 
standing behind her, under the canopy, cha~ching!!! i was just behind 
her record crate ;p she was spin~in phat ~jungle~ at first she didn~t 
seem to be seriously spinning, just dancing and slapping on records, 
we were like "can she really dj?" but then she actually started 
mixing, rough at a couple of moments, but she got some smooth 
transitions in, hell, i~ve never touched decks! she did alright! THE 
HIGHLIGHT, when she shook my hand!  The live MC was a groovy touch. 
Thanks to the ~beads girl~ in the lavender polyester suit for the 
bracelet, you rock!

At 3,00am we arrived at VSF, it wasn~t bad, just a diff vibe, i~m 
having ~issues~ w/ the club thang, esp. when there is a silicon 
hoochie reminiscing Flash Dance, W~hatever! And i could do w/out the 
Fabios who quote "cool backstage pass[laminate]wanna dance?" Sorry but 
i bug~out solo! But whoever was spin~ing between 5~6 am in the smaller 
room kept my groove on ;p  

At 7,00am went to SAFEWAY, nobody spinning there hee~hee, but we 
needed nourishment ;p

Huggies absorb more plur,
~elena~

It's been a long time since I've been to Mendocino, but I believe it's about
3-4 hours north of SF.  I know it takes 5 hours to get to from way out here
in the east bay.  I would love to go to F8... But I am hoping to help out for
the Wonderland party.  Plus... Wonderland is MUCH easier to get to being that
I don't own a car! :)

Hey there ladies and gentlemen.  I'm just going to waste your time for
only a second.  I was wondering if anybody knows who will be spinnin'
tomorrow over at MAD?  I for sure will be going but was just curious to
know who I'll be getting my groove on to.

Hey kids,

I had a great time at Sunset yesterday. It was beautiful. The first thing
I heard when I got there was "Isn't it a beautiful day". That is basically
how the entire experience went, "BEAUTIFUL". 

I got a chance to chit chat and boogy with Mr. E, Jeremy (HAPPY FATHER'S
DAY!), Herb, Matt (Dj Bloom), Andre Lucero(Keep spinning the dope beats!),
and a few others. Not too many Sf Ravers.. I did ketch a glimpse of
Branka.... hehe... 

We need to setup a giant SFraves picnic one of these times....

I was FREEZING.. I forgot to bring a sweater and was freezing my tipples
off in my white t-shirt... hehe.

Another week... another grain in the hour glass of our lives... lets make
this one count. Lets focus on things and those around us. Make this week
and those to come have substance and meaning.

I move out Friday.. I'm sooo happy. I'll be moving to Sunny, Tropical,
Oakland California...! Madison Street baby! ;)

Hugz....

i had this thing installed in my car - there's some sort of metal plate
behind the dash that keeps ppl from hot wiring it, and i have a plug that i
have to plug in to start it. without the plug, no one can start the car.
it's called 'revelco' or something. guess i should start taking the plug
out of the car, eh? sorry for the bad luck. i had a friend in houston who's
car was stolen, and when they finally found it it was trashed. hope you
don't have to go through that as well!

cheers - e. :)

Sender: sfraves-owner@hyperreal.com

okay, i might just regret this after hitting the 'send' button, but i
haven't much to lose, so here goes my shameless 'personal'! i've got a good
friend in austin who's actually running one in the paper there with the
hopes of finding a beau, and i'll start of that that's not why i'm posting
this. anyway, what's life if you don't make an ass of yourself once in a
while?

i've now been out here for about 5 weeks - 2 in san jose before i found my
lovely apartment in what i was _told_ was lower nob hill but what i later
discovered is really the tenderloin. it's really not as bad as ppl think,
but then i'm a paranoid new yorker and don't walk about at night by myself
anyway. at least i found something. i'm married, but i won't go into that
because i don't see the need to open my personal life too much to 450
strangers. and in the traditional personal lingo, wasp female, 30, a bit
shy, sort of small.... :P

i was, as i said in my intro from austin, introduced to raving in '90 or so
up in toronto after (or during) an 808 state concert. been in and out
since. before that, i was a bit of a clubkid, although i sometimes found
myself relentlessly following the dead as well. go figure. basically, i
like happy music, happy ppl, and i like to dance. :) other obsessions of
mine are as follows: design and typography (as those of you who are
familiar can probably tell from my addy), ballet, and ... raving, partying,
design and ballet. modern art (particularly conceptual). books. that's why
i design them. politically to the left. my musical taste is not at all
limited to 'techno' - all happy music. :) not too poppy tho. and i'm
rambling.

so, here i am. and aside from one really sweet person on this list, i
haven't met anyone to hang with. i'm probably feeling desparate 'coz i
haven't found a job yet and am incredibly bored. i don't usually venture
out by myself - during the day, sometimes - but definetely not at night,
and not into social situations (it's that shyness i mentioned). my hubby
doesn't share any of my interests - he'd much rather watch football/soccer
on the tv (gooooooaaaaaalll). anyway, i'll probably be in better shape when
i have a job, as i said, and hence money to spend, and hopefully that won't
be too far off into the future. but even with all the money in the world,
it kinda helps to have ppl to go out with.... told you this was shameless!
anyway, i'm hoping to get involved through this group that helps ppl out at
parties, and that'll be good. anyone else out there in my neighborhood?
hehe.

well, apologies for wasting your bandwidth with such dribble, but that's my
personal! (probably cost an arm and a leg in the paper, and then who knows
what sort of responses you might get! but then again, who knows who's
really reading _this_!)

cheers - e. :)

grandious.

"EWWWWW!!!" and scrunches up his nose, i smile and realize life's not
all that bad :)

Its been a while since we have done one of these, but a few of us got 
together last week for lunch and decided we would try to set one up 
again.  So...

When: Tuesday June 17th, 1997 at 12:00pm
Where: Pedro's on Freedom Circle
Directions:
101N (or S) to Great America Parkway.  If you are on 101N turn right 
off of the exit.  From 101S turn left. You want to be heading towards 
Great America.
Turn right on Mission College. It will be the first or second light.
Turn right on Freedom Circle.
Pedro's will be on your right a little ways down the road.
Ask for the SFRaves party..

If you can make it let me know by tomorrow morning before say 10:30 or 
so..

We'll try to let people know a little more ahead of time next time we 
do this.  Also if anyone has suggestions for places to eat next time 
let me know.

Hey all you party Phreaks,
Let me tell you about ana-log it was at the new "Homebase" the massive
wherehouse down the street from the actual homebase. I had never been
to this new spot and it was real Big!!! it was decortated pretty well.
I think it was just a little to Big. They had two wild spinning lasers
like at the Harmony party in both corners of the room good lighting.
The crowd was good they even had a house room that was not so packed
the party was good not to hot and crowded. They had large fans and the
roll up gates open so it was real cool. I saw a lot of "listers" there
which was kewl. I had never seen rabbit in the moon before and let me
tell you if you have never seen them you are truley missing out. They
put on by far one of the best concert type shows I have ever seen. I
am usually not into the live P.A thing but they were interactive with
the crowd and the dancers and performers that they had with them were
great. I encourage anyone that has never seen them perform to check
them out the next time they come to town. the other Jocks were real
good. The DJ that stole the show was the Surgeon. He F*cking rocked
the house He is a TeKno/Trance producer from UK or Germany not sure?
He must have played like 80 rekkids in like half hour he was mixing
slicing and dicing some hard Trancey Tekno. He is by far one of the
best Tekno/Trance DJ's I have seen in a long time. So I advise you all
to check him out a party coming up real soon. I don't want to give the
party name cause he is a suprise guest!! It was worth the admission
price they put on a good show and party. 

Love you all,
Macadio

Then maybe we should start to think if doing um stuff is really worth it.
I'm beginning to think it's not. Seriously. I'm enjoying having my Sundays
back to do things instead of sleep and stare at the ceiling and not be
able to sleep.. and being all depressed and sad.... it's not worth it.

I suggest you listen to some Jamiroquai.. it ALWAYS cheers me up.... Get
the newest CD.... and when you hear track #4 think of me!... it's my
favorite song.... and it's me and Rubilicious' SPECIAL song for trapping
our love interests in our chamber of love... hehe...

Sometimes I think twice about things I post, but in the end it doesn't
matter... I'm me and this is my planet.

Hi!

	I have been off the list for 6 or 7 months due to leaving the
job I had been at, too busy personal life, etc. etc. I look forward to
seeing you all again now that the weather has warmed up...

	I am also looking for housing for myself and my owner
somewhere near SF. I am currently in Pacifica and would like to move
somewhere a little less expensive and/or split the rent of a 2 or 3 br
house/appt in SF, Daly City, SSF, etc. Rent up to $800 is OK. I
thought I would ask here as a rave-positive household would be helpful
(queer & leather positive also a plus).

	Please email me if you know of an opening somewhere! Nice to
be back!

	Marisa

first, friday was bfd.. DOPE!!! blur, erasure, the cure.. gawd! my 
favorite brit bands all together.. ohmygoodness! =) then sat. was 
graduation... that was exciting... then the parents took markie mark 
and i out to dinner.. then to the apartment we went for a nap, and at 1 
am, we decided to go on our way for rabbit in the moon.. woo hoo.. we 
got there around 1:30, 1:45... we heard the party wasn't that great, 
but then rabbit in the moon came on.. definitely a trip! =) we left the 
party at about 6:30.. went back to the apartment, took a shower, and 
had cracked out conversations while we waited for the mall to open, so 
i could get a daddy's day gift... finally opened, got a present, 
finally went back to my house for the bbq my parents were having for 
graduation... bumped some steve loria in the backyard (dj tune too, 
what a dope tape! you go boy! and thanks bill!).. then we decided to go 
to sunset.. i really love that spot.. i love the berkeley marina, and 
although it's cold, it's my fav. spot for a sunset.. it was just 
beautiful.. so many happy (cold!) people.. and goofy rabbit and monk 
were there getting their grooves on.. silly boys! all in all, this was 
a super great weekend! thanks everyone for being a part of it! =)

                                 much love,
                            anissa, princess of the universe!

Hmmm..


 You sure you weren't just using that OpenGL (3D Text) screen saver that is
now shipped with Win95 OSR2?

 It looks alot more creative if you use your charactor map alittle.


 Great idea though.

To capitalize on a great idea in the South Bay....any one out there
interested in a sfraves San Francisco area Lunch?  If it's been/being
done, fill me in!!

I'm trying to get back into the scene and would like to re-connect with
all of you beautiful people!  My attitude has been a little off lately
and I really need some positive energy thrown my way to get me in a
better frame of mind!  New friends would help too. Hopefully you won't
see this as a self-serving idea ;-( I think it would be a great thing!
Give me some general feeling on this and if anyone's interested let's do
it!  

BTW, love the messages and news!  This is absolutely lovely! 

Melissa ;-p

A good friend of mine asked me to post this, so in case you are interested
don't e-mail me - call him....

2 of my friends are moving to a 3 bedroom warehouse, somewhere in Oakland
(I don't know the details).  They are looking for a roommate.  I know the
rent is $500/month (which includes the utilities), and I believe they still
have a cat.

One of them is a full time student (she doesn't party that hard I believe),
and the other has a full time job (he parties sometimes).  Josh is a very
cool guy, fun and nice.  I've known him for a while, and I get along with
him great (which maybe doesn't mean anything)...  I don't know his roommate
that well, but few times I met her, she was fun.

If you are interested call Josh at 415-208-0933 (his pager).

Thanks,
Branka

awwww man! Surgeon was there and i missed it!! grrr. 
he is from Birmingham, England. he spins/produces hardass, hypnotic techno 
(hard, but not hardcore). similar to Jeff Mills, Regis, Cari Lekebush, Adam 
Beyer.
he spun at an outlaw in NYC a coupla weeks ago and tore shit up.
definitely go let the Surgeon operate on your brain!!! if not for yourself, then
for me...since i'm all the way out here in beantown. :(

keep the vibe

jim e.

ps-the countdown is on...i'll be out there in a little over 100 days!!


 The DJ that stole the show was the Surgeon. He F*cking rocked the house He is a
TeKno/Trance producer from UK or Germany not sure? He must have played like 80 
rekkids in like half hour he was mixing slicing and dicing some hard Trancey 
Tekno. He is by far one of the best Tekno/Trance DJ's I have seen in a long 
time. So I advise you all to check him out a party coming up real soon. I don't 
want to give the party name cause he is a suprise guest!!

        It would probably be easy to identify me. I would have various
braids in my hair in weird places, that all look weird because I usually do
them myself in the morning and take them out when I sleep. I also can't spin
without being stoned, because I learned spinning while in my worst stoner
phase ever(smoking literally all the time). So I would probably be smoking
between every two or three records(one onlooker asked me for a hit once, so
I gave her my pipe, she took a few hits and sat right in front of me. After
she noticed I was taking numerous hits all the time, she asked me how I was
still standing, let alone spinning.)

        But seriously, I more like the idea which I see from time to time at
parties, the DJ lineup schedule with times posted outside the rooms. Maybe
even a sign near the entrance to a room with "Now Spinning : " on it so we
could just post who is currently spinning. But that's a little weird, I
think I like the schedule instead, even though it's usually off because of
delays.

        I was at Mirasol but I don't have a SFRaves laminate. the only
laminate I have is one I got from a Full Moon party like 3 years ago. I
don't know why I've never had an SFRaves laminate, I've been on the list for
like, let's see, 2 years now. I actually asked for them everytime someone
puts an offer out to make a laminate for me but I never recieve them. Oh
well. Most of my 'raving companions' aren't SFRavers, instead they are just
other UCB students like me who all happen to live in the same area. I
usually end up hanging out with them most of the time, but I will usually
approach everyone who has an SFRaves laminate to say hi and introduce myself.

        I defenitely agree with you about the danger of pretentiousness or
ego in the rave scene. When I saw Rabbit in the Moon at Analog on Saturday,
I was at first extremely confused. For the first 30 minutes before they
started, there was just lots of guys trying to look cool on stage standing
in the fog and letting the spotlights hit them in a dramatic way. At first
"Ninja Squirrel"(is that the name of that guy in Rabbit in the Moon?), the
'performance artist' struck me as having an extreme ego problem. He was
always doing crazy things and being in the spotlight, but I guess that's
what he does. Basically their act was one part Prodigy and one part arena
rock show. But oh well, I guess that's how it works in Florida.

        In the Bay Area scene, we probably have some the least problems with
DJ and artist ego getting in the way of music. That's what almost always
strikes me about the 'headlining act' at these larger raves; they usually
aren't that good. I instead spent my time dancing to Woody McBride who
didn't have 10 minute long pretentious intros, and didn't rely on throwing
money out into the audience(like Rabbit in the Moon did)to win them over, he
just relied on his music. It's good to see that a member of Hardfloor will
still get up there and spin like a normal DJ instead of the whole show thing
happening.

        It may be important to remember that Rabbit in the Moon are from
Florida, and we all know that Florida is weird. Marilyn Manson is from
Florida, and Florida is known for its huge death metal scene(many of the
great death metal bands came from Florida, like Obituary and Death. Don't
ask why I know this, okay damnit, I used to play in a death metal band in
high school, when I was young and the testosterone flowed freely)

        Oh boy. 808's, 909's and all of Roland's old drum machines are
extremely high in price now. They aren't being made anymore but Roland
usually reissues the old sounds on newer machines, although it never sounds
quite right(Unless you are willing to shell out for a Roland D3 or something)

If anybody ever seen movie TWINS with Deni DeVito and that big buffed guy with
a funny accent saying "I'll BE BUCK" in every movie he is in... in the scene
where that big buffed guy has sex for the first time, after it's all over they
show him lying on the floor, and if you look closely his face is glowing with
this cool bluesh color.... Well I guess the point is.. anytime you wanna glow
just think back to the time when you first expirienced something new and great for the first time in your life.. You will immidiatly start smiling and then you start producing some sort of bluesh glow... =) So that way you don't have to fly all the way to Japan..... =)

So if any of you see a guy at Wonderland with dark glasses on, a big smile and a blue glowing face come up and give him a hug, and watch his face start glowing even more....

I decided it would be fun to look into getting some personal...and let me 
stress...personal...equipment to play records an spin at my home for my 
own enjoyment, and maybe possibly a few friends if they can bare it :). 
Anyway, I asked around a bit about equipment ( turntables mainly, I know 
a good deal about mixers and speakers,) and all I could come up with was 
an answer that technics are the only turntables to buy. So I look around 
and found the 600 dollar technics, was thrown back a little bit buy the 
price, and was wondering if any of you had a little more information. 
Keep in mind that I only plan to use these in the comfort of my own home.

I did however see some sony tables that had many of the same features of 
the technics and they were 400 dollars less. Could someone explain to me  
( in technical terms please, I will understand you,) what I'm paying for 
if I spend 400 dollars more? And if there are other alternatives, where 
do i go to check them out?...

Thanks and Stay cool!

Matt

I didn't say that you have to remember the first time you got laid.. I said remember a good experience that you had.. it could be anything... for me it's definetly not the first time I got laid, I hardly remember that.. but there are lot of other things make me glow.. as for example what's making my face glow right now, is *fairy princess* Julia, who gave me a laminate on thursday, and listenig to CD's that my best friend lend to me.. and remember all the good fun time we had together... Trust me there are plenty of wonderfull things in life besides sex.. not that sex is not great... but there is also a difference between sex,fucking, and making love.... But meanwhile I'm glowing of the positive energy people give me.....

	I know this is somewhat of a late comment but I've wanted to get
it out since warmth and I think it's kinda important. I remember the 
incident pretty clearly and in fact was one of the guys who threw this 
ass hole back out on the street. There's only one thing that bothered me 
about this situation and I think it's REALLY REALLY imnportant that we 
take a little time to think about and help out with this at following 
raves...the thing that struck me is that this guy was obviously not a 
safe person to have around and by the looks of him ( older man, unshaven, 
dirty clothes...etc...) he obviously was supposed to be there. 

	So all I ask for the safety of myself, my friends, Ruby, and all
the rest of you is that we all keep a close eye out for suspisious looking
people at parties. I don't mean, bothering everysingle person that looks
the least bit out of place. But if you notice someone who OBVIOUSLY looks
like they might cause trouble,find someone who's in charge, or if no-one
is around, KINDLY present your, laminant or something like that to the
person, tell them who you are, and simply ask to see thier ticket. Let's 
all try to help out and never let something like what happened that night 
happen again. Thanks guys and gals :)

Stay cool,

Matt

Good save Matt... 

but I'm sure everybody understood it right... offcourse unless they have been token for the last couple of hours... but then you  should not worry either, they are probably passed out next to their computers drooling on the keyboard...

I record directly to CD regularly. However, I don't involve my computer
at all, since everything I read made this sound like a real
hit-and-miss process that totally ties up your computer for the length 
of the recording proces (you can try to use the computer while
recording, but there's a good chance  windows will start swapping or do
some other antisocial thing to fuck up your audio recordins.... To say
nothing about the wasted time and wasted CD blanks at $5.00 a pop.

There are audio CD recorders out there. There's a pioneer for about
$1000.00, and pro-audio ones from Marantz (CDR-615, CDR-620) that work
quite delightfully. They even have direct digital in/out so you can
copy direct from DAT, or to a digital duplicate of a CD. The CDR-620
has a SCSI port which allows you to hook two of them together  and
duplicate any CD, CD-Rom, etc at double speed. unfortunately, they're
prtetty expensive so it's hard enough to afford one, let alone two. at
least it doubles as a phillips cdd-2000-compatible CDR and CDRom drive
via the SCSI port.... It's actually not a bad thing if you do a lot
of CD recording. you won't need to have 700Mb of disk free to hold your audio
before txfering to the CDR, and you won't need to have your computer sit idle
(well, at least uninteractive) for over an hour while you burn your disk.
and it's also a really great-sounding CD player.

I like my roland MC-303. Despite what all the analog wankers and snobs
out there say about it (they're probably just pissed they farted away
$1000.00 on a piece-of-crap-unreliable-noisy tb-303 or 808, or 909)
just to find out you can get a much cleaner sounding box that is brand
new, midi-capable, supported, and reliable for $500.00). I personally
think it's a pretty cool drum machine and a decent little "rave box"
and it's supposedly similar for doing drum loops to the 808 and 909. i
think the only mistake roland made is calling it a "303" since it isn't
a stripped-down analog bass synth. There's much better analog gizmoids
out there than the tb-303 anyways, e.g. the Roland JP-8000, Nord Lead
II, Waldorf Pulse, etc. So the real question for the snobs is why are
you playing with a toy analog synth when you really should have a
modular, a moog, a matrix, or one of the newfangled digital-simulated
analogs.

For more than twice the money, you can also get the Rave-O-Lution 909,
which seems pretty cool as well
(http://www.keyboardmag.com/studio/raveo.html).

So I've been to a few parties down here where there's lots of hardcore.  
I guess that's a benefit to living in SoCal.  It's really a different 
kind of scene with all the kids crowded around the speakers yelling 
"Hardcore Hardcore Muthafuckin Hardcore!"  I dunno.  Personally I'd 
rather dig to some phatty grooves and boogie and then cuddle and stuff.  
Also there's a whoooooooole lot of bunky down here.  I think at last 
count my SoCal hit/miss ratio comes out somewhere around 70% in favor of 
bunky.  So your average partygoer actually makes a better investment by 
looking for other stuff.  Possibly this explains part of the draw toward 
speed.  I dunno.  I've tried getting into the hardcore stuff.  I mean, I 
feel it's kind of required since I'm in SoCal, but I'm sorry, I just 
can't do it.  BUT I have to admit, it's hard not to laugh at that "Three 
Girls..." rekkid that Ron D Core put out last year... :)

> Rock out to those pre-fab grooves dood!

Some of the pre-fab grooves are cool, but I've been programming my own
loops for a while now. But you probably didn't know that the mc303 had
a decent 808/909-style pattern-based sequencer because you were too
busy listening to all the 303-is-the-electric-guitar-of-our-generation
worshippers whine "it's not a 303" on the internet, even though they
probably spent an hour in the store, couldn't figure it out, and went
back to popping E's and twiddling thos knobs on their tb-303 while
visions of whordes of 12 year old girlz at a prodigy concert rushed
through their heads.

as far as i can tell, this anti mc-303 schtick that people have is a
defensive maneuver to cover their wallets and psyches after blowing
$1000.00 on a cheaply made toy synthesizer.

PS: i have copied some accented hi-hat lines from some presets because
i was too lazy to go in and accent them myself. but then again, i also
use a sampler to steal other people's soundz. i guess you make your
sounds out of flour and baking soda and water, like a "real man".

	Hey Mom's really pissed only thing we can agree on is that I need to 
move on the First of July.  Dad's insisting that I'm wrong but 
agreeing with my conclusions.  Somewhere in there is the base 
difference in human consiousness, I don't know how close cause there 
are other factors involved.

	I'm still going to hold a meeting tomorrow night for the Just Say 
Know Project.  It's going to be at the Berkley Euphorium Located at 
1605 Ashby just two blocks down from bart. Doors open sometime 
earlier but the meeting starts at 7.  The Main Focus of this Meeting 
will be to brain storm on how to stop the fucked up shit thats been 
going on in the scene and bring it not back but forward.  To do this 
all we need to do is change PLUR to PLURAL , For how can you 
have Unity with something when you dont Accept it? And what's 
the point if not Life?

	Accepting What Is!  I can not seem to find and path to Peace
Love Unity or Respect without frist Accepting that I can't justify 
the Universe.  

	Life? Well what else is there? 

	
	If You said Death I'll beleive you after I'm dead.

	The Meeting will last at least an hour to as long as we can stay 
in the building, depending on interest and ideas.  The above is not 
set in stone and Society requires MORE THEN ONE.  If your 
interested let me know in private e-mail so I can get a mailing 
list together before I move. And if you can make it Please come to 
the meeting and see what happens.

			
	Back to the subject, yeah that's right me.	  I need to find a 
temporary to permenant living space to call HOME.  My finance's are 
limited and transportation avialibility is a requirement.  I've NEVER 
had a comfortable living experience with ANYONE.  I don't think this 
will be an issue but I wish to be Honest.  Besides I want a one 
bedroom if I can find one.  

	Really this time the subject.  Seeing as how this is pops computer 
and I'm moving I won't be on the list for sure untill I find a way to 
Call out and an e-mail account,  I'm computer literiate but internet 
ignorant.  Took myself out of the loop a couple of years ago.

	I have some projects in mind to help the above Idea and to help 
pay my rent.  One is a RAVE on the Massive scale to provide the 
funds needed and to send the message loud enough to be heard. 
Another is a Clothing Label to pay my rent and expand the message.

	Possiabilities are allways endless, so if you have a desire to 
help in any fasion I'll try and help.

	Feels like I finaly said that right so I'm gonna go sleep now

Hardfloor is Ramon Zenker and Oliver Bondzio...they are both from
Germany... Woody is from Minneapolis, the owner of Communique records as
well as many other significant labels. In my book he is on the same level
as Hardfloor ( more down to earth: i told him that i saw god during a live
set that he played at a party in Wisconsin and he gave me a hug and a CD =]
) as far as acid producers go but unfortunately he is not part of the band.
=]

anyways, Woody is the epitome of what i expect from a Dj. Friendly, humble,
and skillful ( and he has some bombin' tracks )

oooooooo.......Someone seems a little insecure about their taste in
gear.... gosh......could it be because he bought a piece of doo-doo little
box that has very little going for it other than bludgeoning value???? i
don't know but with attitude like that flying around it sure seems like
he's covering something up.
Dude...cut it with the " my MC-303 is a valid and worthy instrument "
schtick. you are entitled to your opinion but.... ( IMHO ) YOU ARE WRONG....

As far as the 303 being the voice of techno goes...you must put some stock
in that idea yourself or you wouldn't have run out and purchased some
cheesy ass knock off just so you could have the sound... Have fun and rock
on with your bad self.

hello all-

just wanted to invite you all to a north bay raver / geek gathering of the
hungry stomachs in san francisco.

where? yerba buena gardens, third st and mission

when? thursday, june 19 at 12:30 pm until 1:30 or so

why? cause it's a cool place to eat lunch, and there will be groovy
ambient music performed live!

what? lunch, bring something for yourself and something to share, either a
drink, a snack, or a little thingee (remember all your vegan, vegeterian,
and carnivorous buddies)

who? look for the distinct sign of the raver (water bottles) and look for
the geeky guy with the laptop in one hand and the cell phone in the other
(that's me!)

rsvp? why don't you let me know if you wanna come!  i'd love to hang out
with those of you that i know, and meet those of you that i don't!

love-

 matt =)

I didn't say that you have to remember the first time you got laid.. I said remember a good experience that you had.. it could be anything... for me it's definetly not the first time I got laid, I hardly remember that.. but there are lot of other things make me glow.. as for example what's making my face glow right now, is *fairy princess* Julia, who gave me a laminate on thursday, and listenig to CD's that my best friend lend to me.. and remember all the good fun time we had together... Trust me there are plenty of wonderfull things in life besides sex.. not that sex is not great... but there is also a difference between sex,fucking, and making love.... But meanwhile I'm glowing of the positive energy people give me.....

For one.

 Go up to the sony and push down on the table.
 Then go push down on a technics table.


Knock on the technics. Listen to the sound it makes when your nuckle hits
the frame.
Do the same thing to the sony.

The Jungle Factory sells Technics for $450
Find that ADD. Goto The GoodGuys. Pay five hundred bucks for a 3year
limited x-ship warranty. Instant replacement. They will... Uh match any
price.

Well put.

 So. The MC-303. I am not much of a follower. So. If you say it's good. I
will look into it.
 I know what you mean though. So thats it? It's just getting shallow
reviews?

 Here is the big MC-303 question. Because I HAVE looked into it. But. I
could not seem to filter through all the "Pre-Fabs" to get to any possition
to..Make something from scratch..
 Can I make "phat beats" from the ground up? Or do you just select loops
and add to them? Can I make patterns of my own? Can I "erase" all the
preset to get them out of my way? 
 You know what I mean?
 I can some what see why people call it impractical. You know. It seems
kinna toyish. Because of the fact that. It's all in there. You know? I am
looking for a drum machine that can pump out alot of great sounds.  I am
not asking for an "all in one" karoke machine. Just some professional drum
machines. 

 But. If you Niels. Proud owner of the dreamy JP-8000 say it's a good tool.
Then. I might just buy one. No matter what main stream thinks.

 So. You really think it's a great sounding "DRUM-MACHINE" worth my money?
 I can't make compleat songs without DRUMS! =]:..
 So it's a good drum machine then? For "professional" use...

Let me know.
Thanx
Jeff

	Hey Mom's really pissed only thing we can agree on is that I need to 
move on the First of July.  Dad's insisting that I'm wrong but 
agreeing with my conclusions.  Somewhere in there is the base 
difference in human consiousness, I don't know how close cause there 
are other factors involved.

	I'm still going to hold a meeting tomorrow night for the Just Say 
Know Project.  It's going to be at the Berkley Euphorium Located at 
1605 Ashby just two blocks down from bart. Doors open sometime 
earlier but the meeting starts at 7.  The Main Focus of this Meeting 
will be to brain storm on how to stop the fucked up shit thats been 
going on in the scene and bring it not back but forward.  To do this 
all we need to do is change PLUR to PLURAL , For how can you 
have Unity with something when you dont Accept it? And what's 
the point if not Life?

	Accepting What Is!  I can not seem to find and path to Peace
Love Unity or Respect without frist Accepting that I can't justify 
the Universe.  

	Life? Well what else is there? 

	
	If You said Death I'll beleive you after I'm dead.

	The Meeting will last at least an hour to as long as we can stay 
in the building, depending on interest and ideas.  The above is not 
set in stone and Society requires MORE THEN ONE.  If your 
interested let me know in private e-mail so I can get a mailing 
list together before I move. And if you can make it Please come to 
the meeting and see what happens.

			
	Back to the subject, yeah that's right me.	  I need to find a 
temporary to permenant living space to call HOME.  My finance's are 
limited and transportation avialibility is a requirement.  I've NEVER 
had a comfortable living experience with ANYONE.  I don't think this 
will be an issue but I wish to be Honest.  Besides I want a one 
bedroom if I can find one.  

	Really this time the subject.  Seeing as how this is pops computer 
and I'm moving I won't be on the list for sure untill I find a way to 
Call out and an e-mail account,  I'm computer literiate but internet 
ignorant.  Took myself out of the loop a couple of years ago.

	I have some projects in mind to help the above Idea and to help 
pay my rent.  One is a RAVE on the Massive scale to provide the 
funds needed and to send the message loud enough to be heard. 
Another is a Clothing Label to pay my rent and expand the message.

	Possiabilities are allways endless, so if you have a desire to 
help in any fasion I'll try and help.

	Feels like I finaly said that right so I'm gonna go sleep now

We are Tiny.


 How about alittle mature reasoning?
 Like. What would you recommend? And. Lets make it something that is still
supported. Unlike the Roland classics. Something I can like, maybe have a
warranty on.
 Drum Machine.. So far. Niels is the only one that has come up with an
alternative to the 808 or 909 machines.

 Thanx

my girlfriend just subscribed to sfraves and when she got her new member
mail, i was shocked to find absolutely no mention of house music there. 
there was "underground/rave/club/trance/ trip-hop/jungle/goa/and techno"
but no mention of house.  this really bugs me.  house music is a vital
force in the san francisco scene.  the calendar is filled with events
that feature house music.  I don't have it in front of me but i would bet
there are more house events than trip hop parties, or goa parties, or
jungle parties.  Maybe this is just an oversight. maybe I am the only one
who cares about house music.  or maybe this is a case of house
discrimination.  if it is,  what did we do to be discluded from our place
in the discussion of the underground music scene here in sf?  

HOUSE MUSIC WILL NEVER DIE (no matter what you try to do to stop it)

I choose to go free through love...
the quiet joyful uplifting of my loving.
Love is experienced only as a part of me.
I no longer look for it to come to me...
I realize I am my own source of love.
I can only feel my own feelings of love.
As I open my lovingness I find my love swells up
with each sunrise, each summer sky,
each and every smile I see.
My love carries me to a unity with all that is.
I can only transcend to realization with love.
I choose to free of my limitations through love.
I see that as I send love I am the one feeling love.
Anyone can accept or ignore the love I send;
yet I am blessed with my feelings of love.
Love is not the sunrise, the flowers, the friends....
Love is my expression of self.
The true inner self in which I accept and rejoice.
I open my inner self to shine lovingness for all
who choose to recognize it.
Another's disharmony reinforces my love.
It cries out for loving acceptance.
As we see behind the masks,
that unifying energy lifts us all free,
for we are all one another.
Today is my day to love... self... others... the one!

I choose to go free through love.

It was massive. Very massive. The whole place wasn't full, but the warehouse
was huuuge! The soundsystem was awesome, the bass reverberated through me and
made me sm;)e! Teehee. Rabbit in The Moon was pretty good, but not as great
as I expected them to be. The techy thing they were trying to do got old,
because the music they played wasn't that great. Honestly, I think They're a
little bit overhyped. In fact, this entire party was waaay too hyped. It was
good and all, but I expected it to be a little better, in terms of
decorations and music. 

I give props to the little jungle room, because even though there weren't a
lot of people there, everyone was grooving. The overall crowd of this was
pretty cool for a massive. Not too many stone faced rhythm deprived
individuals taking up all the space.

To those who weren't able to come, don't worry, it wasn't that phat of a
party you missed out in a way, but not too much =)~~~~~

Goddamnit, who leaked about the SFR-led conspiracy to kill house music?
Huh?  We've discussed the importance of secrecy here; we're never going to
eradicate house from the face of the SF music scene if y'all can't keep
yer waggin' traps shut.

Guess we're gonna have to "abduct" him now.

Sounds like a plan, I'll bring the glow in the dark paint. We'll paint him, and we are going to have our own glow in the dark Jondabomb, and then we don't need any glow in the dark rats, heee heee =)

oakland salvation a has the best pants! baby blue polyester or subtle-striped
tuxedo pants, etc etc.... but don't go before i get there tomorrow, please.
hee.
i do have a question though. does modlang carry any dn'b imports stuff? where's
a good place to go to to get dn'b imports? btw, i think the dj id conversation
is interesting. i am not sure, but does knowing who's spinning differ from
knowing the face of who's spinning? one can still be anonymous when the name is
'known.' u know what i mean? i guess i personally don't care who's spinning,
though it would be a good thing to know so you can go back when the dj spins   
elsewhere. so i assume that mc's are not common in sf?t that's good, because i
find them distracting.            just me...

love-all!

this is an idea, although imo it works best at outdoor events for some
strange reason....

a few other ideas are for djs to bring a few things to place in front of
the decks as a sort of transient make.shift altar....which of course
contains therein something including their name.  i have seen this done
before and i think it is a really neat way to not only know who is spinning
but _get to know_ who is spinning as well...beyond their music, that is.

another idea is something neat that a friend did for me.  she was madly
bored at the record store she worked at one day and made me a truly
discoflymama nametag to wear out of a bunch of promo stickers (about the
only cool thing about u2's new album were the holographic stickers they
produced to promote it -- perfect for cutting up and putting to good
use)...  anyhoo,i took it to kinko's, paid about a buck fitty to have it
laminated nicely, punched a few holes in it, took a safety pin off of an
item of old garb, and whoOomp!  i am identifiable if i only could remember
to put it on....*hic*

thought this might inspire some of you....maybe next time you are at a
party and are really enomored of an unknown dj, when you find out you could
go home and make them a pimpin' tag yo.  not only would you be spreading
some of that moOoshy loOove, but you'd also make it easier for the next
person in your position to id the dj....ooooh, and then djs could have a
nametag contest ;>  "hey man, i scored 13 tags last night.  how many did
*you* get?"  okay, maybe not.

hahahahahahahahahahaha!!!!!!!! i too have used the mc303 to program
my own loops, and it is not the greatest synth, but it is worth the 500-600
that they go for now... btw, i don't touch the presets (but i'm sure some of 
my loops sound very similar).

the mc-303 is a good intro synth at an affordable price, you can learn
a lot about sequencing and some stuff about lfos, adsr, effects processors,
etc...
because of this, it may seem like a toy to some, and it has some "karaoke"
mchine
like qualities, but it also has some really cool "professional" sounds, at an

affordable price, the really cool thing is that, not only does it have the
drum parts,
or the bass parts, it's got some cool "lead" sounds too.

can be, any synth is what you make it!  some of the coolest sounds i've ever
heard came out of an old reel to reel! or a transistor radio with some wires
crossed! the sound is what YOU make it... the machines are only tools, and
you
can tunnel out of jail with wooden spoon if you have to, know what i mean?

there has (eradicate house music) been a lot of talk about
conspiracy on the internet lately...possibly due to this
 being the  (eradicate house music) twenty fifth anniversary
of the watergate breakin and perhaps because the former
director of the CIA recently  (eradicate house music) stated in 
response to the question of weather the government
was involved in smuggling (eradicate house music) cocaine from
 the contras to the black ghettos of urban america..
 that there had never  (eradicate house music)been any kind
 of conspiracy in the USA....EVER.and that those who
 believe in (eradicate house music) conspiracy are just
 plain crazy. Just as looney as those that
 believe in (eradicate house music) subliminal persuasion

South Bay lunch IS San Jose central.  We generally stay to the San
Jose area.  Look for a BSP soon in your future.  We'd love to have you.
We've decided since Jay got back and it was a good time to start having
them again.  They are every Tuesday (that might change if Branka keeps
using it as an excuse not to show though).  They tend to be right at 12
noon till 1:00 or so.

Also, if others are inspired to start their own regional rave list
lunches, that's cool but could you please put the region in the header
(bad Matt, bad Matt... think just because it's actually in SF you could
skip the locale eh?).

Finally, credit where credit is due, but these were derivative of the
Monday night dinner idea, so just some credit where credit is due.

AndyW

p.s. Don't forget to visit City Espresso in Santa Clara tonight to support
some local SJ morons... er... talent spinning some mellower records
tonight.

"I don't know the key to success, but the key to failure is trying to
please everybody"                   -Bill Cosby

ATTITUDE IS EVERYTHING
By Francie Baltazar-Schwartz

Jerry was the kind of guy you love to hate.  He was always in a good
mood and always had something positive to say.  When someone would ask
him how he was doing, he would reply, "If I were any better, I would be
twins!"

He was a unique manager because he had several waiters who had  followed
him around from restaurant  to restaurant. The reason the waiters
followed Jerry was because of his attitude. He was a natural  motivator.
If an employee was having a bad day, Jerry was there telling the
employee how to look on the positive side of the situation.

Seeing this style really made me curious, so one day I went up to Jerry
and asked him, "I don't get it! You can't be a positive person all of
the time. How do you do it?" Jerry replied, "Each morning I wake up and
say to myself, Jerry,  you have two choices  today.  You can choose to
be in a good mood or you can choose to be in a bad mood.

I choose to be in a good mood. Each time something bad happens, I can
choose to be a victim or I can choose to  learn from it. I choose to
learn from it. Every  time someone comes to me complaining, I can choose
to accept their complaining  or I can point out the positive side of
life. I choose the positive side of life."

"Yeah, right, it's not that easy," I protested.

"Yes it is," Jerry said. "Life is all about choices. When you cut away
all the junk, every situation is a choice.  You choose how you react to
situations. You choose how people will affect your mood. You choose to
be in a good mood or bad mood. The bottom line:  It's your choice how
you live life."

I reflected on what Jerry said.  Soon thereafter, I left the restaurant
industry to start my own business. We lost touch, but often  thought
about him when I made a choice about life instead of reacting to it.
Several years later, I heard that Jerry did something you are never
supposed to do in a restaurant business:  he left the back door open one
morning and was held up at gunpoint by three armed robbers. While trying
to open the safe, his hand, shaking from  nervousness, slipped off the
combination. The robbers panicked and shot him.

Luckily, Jerry was found relatively quickly and rushed to the local
trauma center. After 18 hours of surgery and weeks of intensive care,
Jerry was released from the hospital with fragments of the bullets still
in his body. I saw Jerry about six months after the accident. When I
asked him how he was, he replied, "If I were any better, I'd be twins.
Wanna see my scars?"

I declined to see his wounds, but did ask him what had gone through his
mind as the robbery took place. "The first thing that went through my
mind was that I should have locked the back door," Jerry replied. "Then,
as I lay on the floor, I remembered that I had two choices:  I could
choose to live, or I could choose to die. I chose to live.

"Weren't you scared?  Did you lose consciousness?" I asked.

Jerry continued,  "The paramedics were great.  They kept telling me I
was going to be  fine. But when they wheeled me  into the emergency room
and I saw the expressions on the faces of the doctors and nurses, I got
really scared. In their eyes, I read, 'He's a dead man. " I knew I
needed to take action."

"What did you do?" I asked.

"Well, there was a big, burly nurse shouting questions at me," said
Jerry. "She asked if I was allergic to anything. 'Yes,' I replied. The
doctors and nurses stopped working as they waited for my reply...  I
took a deep breath and yelled, 'Bullets!'   Over their laughter, I told
them, 'I am choosing to live.  Operate on me as if I am alive, not
dead."

Jerry lived thanks to the skill of his doctors, but also because of his
amazing attitude. I learned from him that every day we have the  choice
to live fully.  Attitude, after all, is everything.

You have 2 choices now:

   1. save or delete this mail from your mail box.
   2. forward it to your dear ones and choose to pass this on

Hope, you will choose choice 2.

i'm looking to find what machine makes a particular sound heard often
in jungle, and then ultimately to find a sample of it :)


the description:  it's that shicka-shicka shichk shichka-shichk sound, kindof 
     sounds like a tamborine, pretty high pitched, and a very short length.


can anyone help identify what's making that sound??  i must have it!@ ;)


thanks,
 justin

really, this is just some stuff I really wanted to say:

1.  Hey, it looks like the flame content has gone down on the list!  Props to 
everyone for keeping it cool.  Yeah, I know there's a lil tiff about that 
whole 303 thing, but it's not getting out of hand.  And the whole jungle vs. 
house thing didn't get as volatile as I thought it was going to get.  But I 
guess everything looks calm after that pre-moderation explosion after FGE . . 
. eek!

2.  Speaking of house, I don't know why it gets such a bad rap.  Yeah, so some 
of it is commercial.  And preppy suburbanites go to clubs that play house.  So 
what?  Take an example from hip hop.  All kinds people listen to Wu-Tang Clan, 
righ righ?  Hell, they used to play it at my school dances--played it at 
Junior Prom, matter of fact ("Ice Cream"--is that song not the shit?).  But 
that doesn't exactly make them commercial and mainstream . . . anyone who 
knows about Wu-Tang knows they're nowhere near that.  So why does house get no 
respect?  And you can't judge the whole genre of house by a few crappy 
mainstream artists (I don't think I have to name any, u know which type I'm 
talking about).  I don't see anyone judging rap music by MC Hammer, Warren G, 
and Freak Nasty . . . ugh

Is everyone going to start disrespecting breakbeat?  Just wondering, since 
it's becoming popular and all.  That'll be too bad, cuz I like breakbeat too.

Anyways, most types of techno/electronica or whatever you want to call it was 
at least influenced (if not given birth to) by house.  Or so it appears.  I 
could be wrong.  Lemme know if I am.

Just because a type of music may seem a little more UG doesn't mean it's 
superior to those that are becoming more mainstream.

3.  I always do this, but I just want to give another shout out to all the 
Sacramento and other non-Bay Area ravers on the list, trying to help build up 
our own lil scenes . . . and props also to you Bay Area ravers for making your 
scene so phat.

4.  Props to Leslie for helping organize the Karma Patrol.  You go girl.

5.  Much love to all of yous who respond to my posts, thanks for taking out 
the time and effort--especially Mr. E, Macadio, Byroni, Gregory (aka DJ 
Lunatik), Matthew W., and Scott.  And to all those who flamed me, thanks for 
exposing me to another point of view, and it was appreciated (reluctantly ;-) 
).

6.  Thanx to all those I've never spoken w/ but make the list great to 
read--specifically Mr Jeff nStuff, Foolish Fish, Leslie Ayres, Alik (aka 
Earthlyn), John S. Lee, Veann, Anissa, Christine the Candygirl, Stariana, 
Pablo, and I'm sure I forgot someone, or misspelled something, or whatever, 
but you know what I mean . . . 

7.  Oh, and see you all at Wonderland, yes?  Will I FINALLY get to met you 
folks?  Hey, can I still buy presales the day of the event?  That's the only 
day I'll be in that area . . .

sfravers and house music are the bomb!  don't let anyone tell you different! 
:-)
xoxo--Miccaela
wondering if this might be a warm fuzzy after all . . . oops >;-)

I would move cons - 2 days long - top pros :).  What's wrong with having it
more than 1 night.  That's when things get better :).

As for the location, I was there at Tribal Future and I don't remember it
being cold, or muddy (unless you went to mud baths).  I hope it doesn't
rain, because that could turn it into a mud place.

I can't wait to go :).  When I heard where it was going to be it made me
even happier - that space *rocks*.  And is there anything better than a
great DJ line-up, in beautiful place, under the stars?  I don't think so....

There are so many places I would love to be this weekend, but this was my
first choice...

I hope all of you have fun, wherever you go - the weekend will be great.

If you are at F-8 come by and say HI. :)....   Just look for a girl with
long, brown hair, glow-sticks :)....

=) Branka

Well, I dunno about the sony tables, but gemini (yea, I know...) has just
come out with their version of the 1200, looks almost identical, and felt
almost identical. I didn't get a chance to play on them, but the platter
felt similar to a 1200, similar pitch control (which goes +/- 10%, instead
of 8%).. and they're about $150-$200 cheaper... I don't know where you could
check them out, I saw them here in Florida... I think they're definatly
worth checking out tho, considering the price difference.

all my bestest friends came back from college out of state (yay!)
and...  they all want to go to city nights.

oh ick. now i remember why i stopped going to clubs and started going
to ugparties instead. 

*everyone dances the way they want to and feels comfortable doing it
without tons of *cool* people staring down at them going "ha! look at
the dork!" 

*it's not a meat market where all the guys stand against the wall
while girls in push up bras strut pass them. "hey bay-bee, yoo so fly!"

*you make soooo many new friends rather than just some guy who wants
your number and turns out to be some gad awful player who thinks he's
"the bomb"

*rather than being greeted by a nod (you know, that thing that those
guys do to acknowlege your existence... when they tilt up their head
fer like a second) you get big sqoOoshy hugs 

*everyone seems to know everyone or even if they didn't you still get
a big sqOOOoooOoshy hug :)

*no bad vibes. no fronts. no i'm so cool, i'm too cool to talk to you
so i'll just stand here with my hands in my pockets and stare at that
hoochie momma over there.

*better music (okay so i'm biased. i don't like high energy music with
high pitched whiny voices... my bad)

*no alcohol sold. no high testosterone high alcohol leveled guys
starting fights.

*i hate that circle (i'll say it once again:) when two people are in
the center dancing and everyone else seems to crowd around them and
just watch.  ooo big pet peeve :P

did i mention i loved you guys? did i mention i'd rather spend my
saturday nights laughing and talking and giggling and smiling and
dancing and chain smoking and gulping down gallons of water with all
you beautiful people rather than go to city nights?
well i do
<hugs>

Ok, here's a thought.  Is there a way that I can use the A/D converter on my

Well.. If the 303 is a Fender Strat.
Then the JP-8000 must be an Ibanez S470 or something.



Anybody got a Roland TB-303 they want to "give" to me?
I didn't think so.   =[

another reason why raves are better then clubs:
YOU DONT GET YOUR ASS GRABBED EVERY FIVE SECONDS BY SOME DIRTY OLD MAN!
:)~

my friends came back from college too and they're all down to go to 
*(GASP* the EDGE in palo alto.
but they refuse to let me make them go to HAPPY KIDS or ANYTHING slightly 
like a rave.
they're scard of mean people on drugs they said
EEK! why do i put up with this? :)
smooch!

RIGHT ON! :)

I have to agree with you one hundred percent. I haven't been to clubs that
many times but everytime I used to go in the past I always felt like I
wasn't wanted there, or I was too "uncool" to hang out there. Ever since I
started raving, when I go into a club with some friends I always find
myself saying to myself " I wish I was at a rave..." all night long. 

Stayyy cooool!

My boyfriend-type-person and I may need a ride to F-8 on Saturday.  We are
in the Inner Sunset -- anyone leaving from the city after 8 p.m. on Sat.
who has room for a glittergirl, her boy, a couple glowsticks, and a lot of
enthusiasm?  We're willing to contribute to gas, sing-a-longs, and silly
discussions!

Ok guyz, I just had to let you all know about my dream last nite
(if someone knows dream interpretation, please tell me what this means!)

Ok, so I dreamt that me and DJ DAN got together...(yay me!)
it was weird, everyone was gathered around my palace and
they were all waiting for me to come out...I was of course,
getting ready upstairs in next to the throne. then, I woke up...

so I don't know what happened afterwards... I can't really say
if Dan was good or not ;o)

sorry, I'll shut up now ;)

Well Dave, you probably don't get XLR8R magazine in Florida (maybe I'm
wrong!), or have a friend that has gotten a pair of these tables yet...
*but*, I couldn't disagree with the review from the XLR8R by dj Ulrich
(list member Michael Standish), about the cons of the new Gemini's.

Just a couple hundred more Dave, and you can get the ultimate... the
1200's! Ain't nothing like the real thing baby!

the right place ;o) when you go to clubs,  you can use as much
attiude as you wish and people love you for it :) the more dirty
looks you give the *trash* the more in the cooler and beautiful
you become ;)

I know, I know..weird people, weird scene :)

Hey! like I said...I'm a clubkid! :( CLUBS are cool cause
you get your ass grabbed by dirt old men :) then you can look
at them and say: "look, don't touch...you don't have it, you never
will". ;o) and also, people stare at your dancing and say: "wow, look at
that dork" which translated to ravertalk is "wow, he dances hella phat!,
I wish I could dance like that!" hey, you don't get to listen to

LaBouche or Angelina or Jocelyn Enriquez at a rave :(

Okay people.  If anyone wants to meet up at my place before Wonderland, write
soon.  I would love to organize something!  Also, I am all over the San Jose 
lunch deal.  I could use some mid-work lovin'.  I'm trying to give here, now
I need a taker.  Give give give, is that all you ever do?  Why don't you try
taking once in a while?!!  Drop a line if you are interested in any of the 
above.

I have so many wonderful, warm feelings for you I can't even think of a clever
line to express it!!

I checked out the new Geminis at Guitar Centre, and had a completly
different reaction. The platter was obviously much lighter than a 1200s.
Pretty much everything was cheap and flimsy. And no quartz lock unless the
pitch control is at zero. Pure shite, if you ask me. Check my article in
this months XLR8R for thre whole story.

There is absolutely nothing to be ashamed of their.  I myself ponder this
question. Considering that I'm such a huge fan of all kinds of techno. 
Why do I hate High Energy with an invincible passion?

No Shit.  Hi, I'm stud dancer (sometimes they are) and I don't receive
enough attention at home.  Therefore I love it when everyone stares at
me.


I use to sort of be in the club scene but once I was introduced to the
beauty of the UG scene, it was love from there on.  Ya'll are just
awesome.

Alright guys, its been awhile since I've posted (coupla weeks), but I'm

making me feel nostalgic.

Sample:

Altern-8
T-99
808 State
SL2
N-JOI
Eon

Yikes! does anyone here relate to this?
I remember driving to L.A. late in '90 and dancing to this stuff in a
fucked up location and feeling so high (w/o anything!).

I'm pulling out Homeboy, Hippie, and a Funky Dred!

Anybody familiar?!

Nevermind .... I'm in la la land now.

see ya,

Hey bass freaks,

Does anyone have any idea (or have you seen anywhere) the MixMag Doc
Scott mix CD?
I've got the LTJ Bukem CD (kinda lame actually) but I met Doc Scott when
he was playin' w/ Goldie at the Sound Factory last year (Raymond Roker
-URB mag was there too) (first time I ever heard Pulp Fiction by Alex
Reece as well) and I have been lookin' for this import since February.
Any help would be great!

Thanks,

Straight crazy old skool stuff. I dj'd a party last year in Sacto and
the promotor told me it was a retro night, so I was like cool, I've got
the stuff.
I went in a played a set that had stuff like:

Playing with Knives - Bizarre Inc.
Kicks like a mule - "Your names not down, your not comin' in!"
T-99
The Scientist - Exorcist
LFO

and stuff like I mentioned earlier, and the crowd was like,
"what the fuck is this?"
I was like
"what the fuck is wrong with you?"
and then I realized when the next DJ came on he was playing stuff from
like '93 and on.
WHoops, my bad. I got a little too retro on their ass.

Where in the south bay are you at amber...pre-wonder get together sounds 
like a good idea to me. I'll probably be heading up there with Jelo and 
another friend of mine and I'm sure they would be down for it too.

	Well, I guess I didn't really expect soooo many replies to my questions 
and it seems that they are still coming in. So to keep mail from piling 
up I should probably say that I've made up mind, and I'm going to wait a 
while and go with the technics.

Thank you all for you help! I probably know about ten times more then I 
did in the begining about turntables because of you guys. It was really 
nice to see that so many people were willing to put there word in and 
help out.

Thanks and Stay Coooooool!

I don't know if these end up to be more or less than 1200's, but I played
on a pair of Vestax decks a while back (don't remember the model) and they
were pretty damn cool.  They didn't feel AS solid as a Technics, but they
did have one thing done better...

the pitch control went +/- 8 like a normal 1200 ( I think), but it didn't
have that 'zone' right around zero... it went straight through so you
could beatmatch right around the zero mark.  If you wanted quartz locked
perfect pitch, you press a button for it.

I just though that was cool, but I'm glad I have 1200's (Vestax also makes
a model with a reverse mode for playing records backwards... I want to
check that out someday).

I wouldn't recommend those Gemini's at all.  The platter is too light,
they're not well made, and when I tried them in the store they seemed so
hokey.  If you are going to buy them, buy them at Guitar Center or another
place that has a thirty day money back, and keep the box.  I just don't
think they are even in the same category.  If you're getting 1200's, I'd
recommend a mom and pop store, even if it is a few bucks more because the
mom and pop store is dying to the GoodGuys/Fry's/Guitar Center monoliths
and that sucks.

Get real decks, real slipmats (thank you Noah and Alex for getting me wise
to this) and a cheap mixer if you're low on money. You can always go back
and get a better mixer, but spending money on cheap decks is like flushing
it.  If you buy good used 1200's, you can always sell them for what you
paid for them.  I'm sure a reasonably priced 1200 wouldn't take to long to
sell on this list...

Hey allzs, I'm not trying to start a flame war or anything,
I just wanted to let both sides come before you alls...

I've noticed that people have been putting down clubbies on the list.
I think that is very UNPLur :( mainly because *I go to clubs* every
week in fact. its not fair! cause I Am also a *raver*. I LOVE parties
sooo much! but I like clubs as well.

its all about our differences. and we all must learn to accept them.
some of us might not like the club-scene and stuff but it isn't fair to
say that the club scene suxs and that everyone in it is rude,
inconsiderate and stupid and that ravers are cooler and better. thats
not
the raver attitude I go to parties for :(

life isn't only about RAVES and PARTIES. life isn't only about positive
and good emotions. there is also the other side that we must not ignore.
ignoring things doesn't make them go away... it lets them pile up
'till they get worst...the more we ignore, the more negative it seems.

that is why I go to clubs :) to spread the good vibe the place needs!
so thats why I think, RAVES aren't just parties, they are places where
we *learn* about the good things in life and we must take that knowledge
and spread it and share it with the rest of the world :)

Just my .02 cents and a quarter :)

I was looking through a semi-recent issue of the brilliant UK mag
"MixMag", when I stumbled upon an article about Lil' Louis and his
experiences in the UK. The article started off with...

"Do you ever wonder what all these American DJs must think of us
all? Back in the States clubbing is a little different. Oh sure,
they're into their music, appreciate a good DJ and have a good
dance but that's about it. Over there they don't have blokes
jumping around the dancefloor dressed as road workers, they don't
have fellow DJs who collapse mid set because they're too out of
it to play and they definitely don't get girls walking around in
fluffy bras. Which is their loss I think you'll agree."

Are we missing out or not? I don't know. Personally, I don't really
like the club scene, no matter where in the world it is. But hey,
a snatchy girl in a fluffy bra would be nice. JUST KIDDING!!!

This may be true to you guys..

 But for me. It's quiet the opposite.
 I feel totally unwelcomed at the ravEs. I have heard jealous beat ravErs
tell me to "go home" "your not wanted here" and so on.

 At the clubs. Nothing but smiles usually.
 I am going to try and make it to Area51. My first ravE since a couple of
months of clubbin. We will see if things have changed.

what I meant here was that I'm looking for a SYNTHETIZER! you know,
like a piano type thing with different samples that you can use to
make different noises and stuff...does anyone have one that they
want to sell or get rid off? :)

In my case, these are wants :) I love gadgets and midgets :)
I guess I would also called them 'needs' since I NEED one
in order to do what I NEED to do :)

Got a question for all the beautiful people out there.

I am thinking of throwing a party once every other Saturday during the afternoon for free in my loft space. I figure I could hold up to 100 people with out much of a problem. The way I want to do it is by RSVP. 

You basically send me Private E-Mail with a request to attend and I will post you back with the address and directions. I figure the party would go from 12 to 6.  
We will be doing something very interesting things at this.

#1 -> Live mixing over the Internet, I will give the address out just as soon as we have this up and fully tested.
#2 -> Let New DJ's get a shot. ( Send me your name and you got the chance )
#3 -> 2 Regular Bomb DJ's the Area has never seen before, just sit back and listen.
#4 -> Free Drinks and Munchies
#5 -> Surprise DJ's ( Local Hero's or Villains depending on your Taste )

This is called the House PET Project, please write me back with your comments, the First one I am thinking of doing is in 2 weeks from this Saturday. We are always looking for volunteer to help out as well. This is back to the true nature of the Rave, No big Lights with Productions, just a bunch of People gathering in the HOUSE PARTY SETTING! As JACK say, IN MY HOUSE!

Pete

Thanks to everyone who responded! I've finally got all my tapes dubbed 
and ready to go. Sorry it took so long. Now I've got to find out how to 
get them to everybody. I'm going to be at wonder this weekend, so if 
anyone is as well, I can bring some tapes along. 

I live in the south bay, and I'd be more than willing to drive around a 
little to deliver them as well. Anyhow, please write back offering your 
suggestions or gimme a call.

the moving shadow offshoot. Smooth layering gives this one a trancy
almost old-school feel. Supposedly limited to 750, buy this beautiful
track if you see it.

DJ Kane- Film Score rmx- 24 Karat

Great stuff from newschooler (relatively) dj kane- and better than his
last offering on TOV. Great stacatto intro gives way to a dark-tinged
bouncy affair. Top-notch. The original mix on the flip is just as good,
but very different. Atmospheric strings float on most of the track and
there's this cool noir-ish trumpet sample (boo radleys maybe?) which
really throws you off. Yes Yes.

Majistrate- Diagnostics- Splash Promo

Maj delivers exactly what we've come to expect over the past year: solid
rollers. A-side uses that female 'spacecraft check-list' sample that
everybody and their mother has fiddled with, but Maj pitches it down and
makes it subtle. Great utility piece. Flip side is the VIP mix of Hold
it Now and it easliy the best version of the 3 released. One for the
blunted massive. 

-peace-

No, I think it's a Gibson SG. It's way cooler than the tb-303, and
a hell of a lot more flexible.

Thank you for the admission.

That's it kiddies -- start jumping around your bedrooms playing
air-303! Hell I saw this stupid Blur video in India showing one of the
band-members plinking a single key over and over again on his tb-303. I
guess if diddling the fender strat neck on video was the
masturbatory-phallus worship thing of the rock-and-roll era, I guess
the 303 is like the masturbatory-clitoris worship thing of the techno
era. Either way ya bobbit, it's still wankin!

i would not recommend buying the gemini's.  if money is an issue then i
would go with the technics slbd22k's which are $100 a peice.  that's what
i mexed on for 34 years before i got my 1200's last year. 

Bon Appetit!  :>

make no mistake.  there is no good cheap alternative to the solid metal
1200's.  if there were, people would be buying them and using them in
clubs and raves.

        The new Gemini tables, the ones that look like the 1200's, are
really crappy. The tone arm is the biggest joke. It has pieces of plastic on
it painted to look like metal to make it seem like it has all the
adjustments and stuff that the technics tone arm has. However, by fiddling
with it you can tell it's not mounted anywhere near as solid as the 1200s.
Plus, it only has quartz pitch locking at 0%. Which means if you had the
pitch slide at maybe +3%, and you were in the middle of beatmatching, if the
line voltage changes any(which is very common)it will throw it off. So that
would make it exceptionally hard to beatmatch. I'd recommend sticking with
1200s if at all possible.

        I must defenitely say that the TB-303 is not the Strat of techno.
TB-303 might be a really good bass, since it's main purpose is creating
basslines. I'd say that the Strat of techno is the SH-101. Because without
it, there would have never been acid. Which means no trance. And so forth.

It's getting mixed reviews, just like anything. Basically, a review
that's entirely negative probably means the author missed the point,
and a review that is entirely positive probably means the author got
paid off. I think my review of the mc-303 is fair.  I've also attached 
a somewhat negatively biased review of the 303 that I still consider
"somewhat fair"... it's unfair in the sense that it makes comparisons
to the 303, 808, 909 boxes which aren't available any more, and are
not supported, and are generally overpriced given that they were
mc-303 like "toys" back when they released. Buy one of these and it breaks,
and there's a good chance you'll have to throw it in the trash and buy
another one. Meanwhile the mc-303 is guaranteed, and if you break it
after warranty. you can still send it back to roland for service. 

having ongoing support is also nice. i'm having the new 1.03 ROM sent
to me for free by my retailer (www.sweetwater.com) because roland has
released an upgrade since I bought my box.

That's what the record button is for. You can record in real time, or
record in step time, or step through the note events and
alter/add/delete params directly.

The interface is pretty funky and kinda modal, so you probably need to
at least skim the manual, or play around. It all seems to make sense to
me now, because there's a lot of conceptually-related buttons serving
double and triple purpose.  I'm kinda "telepathic" when it comes to
figuring out funky UI's and electronic gizmos, so I actually figured
out a lot of things by myself first, then I read the manual and found
out some useful shortcuts.

> and add to them?

You can make beats. "phat" is up to you. Use the record and playback buttons.
you can also create realtime patterns and assign them to buttons to play
back from the keyboard directly. (Just like the jp8000).

you can then take your loops and sequence them together into a song. or
you can copy bits and pieces of presets, add your own stuff, and make
into song. or you can take existing presets, subtract lots of parts, and
make them into your song. it's very flexible.

> Can I make patterns of my own?

Yes. You have 50 slots for your own patterns containing up to 8 traks each.
You have another 50-100 slots to record variations of your patterns
(same sequence and realtime-controls, but ability to mute 1 or more parts,
change effects, change tones, etc). After twiddling all non-sequencer
based things on one of your patterns, you can use "Vari Write" to save
your settings. this is good for taking a track and adding/subbing/changing
different layers.

> Can I "erase" all the preset to get them out of my way? 

No. But when you  get rid of all the "variation patterns" on the presets
and replace with your own. and you have U1-U50 for storing your own patterns.

That may not be enough if you have no other MIDI equipment, but I can
always do a MIDI SysEx dump of the contents of my mc-303 into my
computer. Good luck trying to do this with a tb-303.

>  You know what I mean?

Sometimes. :-)

If you think it's impractical you should check out the tb-303. that thing
is truly a toy, and it's got an even more obtuse UI. and no midi whatsoever
so your SOL for doing any kind of reasonable backups. and good luck trying
to take a loop you put together and dump it to your computer's sequencer.

No MIDI pretty much defines "toy" in my mind.

There's lots of drum machines out there. Roland/Boss, Alesis, Yamaha,
Roland, Emu, etc.

Or just get a sampler and some drum samples and hook it up to your
computer for sequencing. Sometimes, it's nice to have an all-in-one
box. For example, I got to make an otherwise unbearable 35-40 hour trip
back from india somewhat bearable by writing some choons and playing
around with this box. (You can tell some of the reviewers have their
heads up their asses cuz they start whining about how the mc-303 can't
have battery power -- all you need to do, is go down to Fry's or Radio
Shack, get a 6-DCell battery holder, solder on a coax-power jack (the
polarity is printed on the outside of the box) and you've got yourself
a portable groove machine that'll run for at least 20 hours
continuously on batteries, even w/ the volume cranked up).

>  But. If you Niels. Proud owner of the dreamy JP-8000 say it's a good tool.
> Then. I might just buy one. No matter what main stream thinks.

Fuck the main stream. And "the main stream" depends on where you look.
The whiny wankers that diss the mc-303 have attitude and outdated
equipment. There's also people out there that like this machine, or at
least accept it as a useful, though slightly limited box. Like I said,
it is what it is, does what it does. That's good enough for me, and if
it's not good enough for you (that's you mr "cathode" -- even though
probably don't even know what a cathode is, nor its etymology) then
don't run around dissing people that don't have your treasured
303-cock-throbber and acting all superior like you're of the
one-true-faith ...) then that's your problem not mine.

> So. You really think it's a great sounding "DRUM-MACHINE" worth my money?
>  I can't make compleat songs without DRUMS! =]:..
> So it's a good drum machine then? For "professional" use...

If you want drums for professional use, buy a sampler. and a computer
and software and a midi interface, and some effects boxes, and some 
cd-rom collections of samples. it'll certainly put you out more than
$500.00, and it'll be giving you headaches half the time, and you'll
totally lose inspiration of making a cool sound because you'll be
tracking down some weird midi glitch, or tinkering with some random
sampler parameter that is making your sound get all fucked up....  and
you won't be able to carry it to the john and write beats while you're
on the throne.

The 303, 808, 909 weren't for professional use either, and neither is
the casio cz-101. however, plenty of your favorite sounds have been
made with toys.

It's like this-- a boombox is no substitute for a stereo w/ separate
tuner, preamp, amp, lp-player, cd-player, and cassette. nonetheless i
have both because they both have their uses. and the $200.00 boombox
might be a better way to get into music than going out and laying out
$5000.00 on "professional" stereo gear.

oh, here's that review, which I don't exactly fully agree with, but  at
least he is going into it in more objective detail than the usual

isn't reviewing the box I have w/ the almost-latest ROM v 1.02 or the

Roland MC-303 Review
by Darwin Grosse


INTRODUCTION

I have been, and I'm sure you've been, disappointed with the current spate
of reviews of the new Roland MC-303 'Groovebox'.  It is just too difficult
to make a buying decision based on one large picture, and eight paragraphs
about its cool sound.  I received an MC-303 a few weeks ago, and have spent
a significant amount of time working with it.  I've used it for recording,
live performance and as a MIDI driver for other boxes.  This is the most
detailed and extensive review I've seen anywhere, and I hope you find it
useful.

For what it's worth, I've got very little invested in the MC-303.  I got it
as part of a barter deal, so I have very little money invested in it.  I
also don't see making a lot of money with it, so I have little economic
interest either.  I say this because of some other synths that I've
talked-about/defended in the past (like that VAST machine so many of you
love...).

If you haven't seen one, the MC-303 is an attempt by Roland to capitalize
on the current excitement for old Roland 'x0x' boxes.  This 303 is a
multitimbral synth, with built in sequencer (with both real-time and
step-time programming modes), arpeggiator and effects processor.  It also
has a few 'special' features, such as real-time filter control and the RPS
- a real-time phrase playback mechanism.

I will format this review in the same way that I learned the machine - by
comparing various features against other devices I've used.  This review
will also be somewhat time-locked, since Roland is expected to update the
operating system as bugs are found and fixed.  The scope of this instrument
is pretty wide, and therefore difficult to review in detail.  I hope that
you will forgive the length of the review in exchange for some measure of
completeness.  Also, since they are irrelevant to me,  I'll spend zero time
reviewing the internal patterns and sequences -- if you want to hear them,
check them out at a local music shop.

Roland MC-303, Groovebox, TR-909, TB-303 and others are either trademarks
of Roland, or their lawyers ought to get off their asses and get something
done.  Woody McBride's and Richie Hawtin's names are used without
permission -- sorry for the inconvenience, guys.  2Unlimited's name is

MC-303 AS DRUM MACHINE (the 909 factor)

Upon receiving the MC-303, I immediately dove into the drum programming.  I
really appreciated the TR-909's drum pattern programming system, and have
recently been using some computer models (Logic Environments and MAX
programs) to simulate this functionality.  I was very curious as to the
effectiveness of the MC-303 for this type of percussion programming.

Like the 909, the MC-303 features a number of buttons with embedded LED's.
These lights are used for two purposes - to show the currently playing
beat, and to show drum hits that have been programmed in step-time.  On the
MC-303, the step-time programming paradigm is kept pretty intact.  You
select a drum instrument and hit the keys representing the step where it
should sound.  Given that the MC-303 is a digital, sample-based system, you
have access to many more sounds than the TR-909 makes available - 108 sound
are available on the rhythm programming channel.

108 sounds are a bonanza, but there is a very dark secret here - and one
that I will often repeat.  The sounds, and their layout on the virtual
keyboard, are not editable without some fancy-pants computer editor.  Even
then, a number of parameters simply cannot be permanently changed.  No way
to replace that over-used laughter sample (MIDI note #101 on all of the
internal rhythm sets) to something more useful.  No way to tune the kick to
the rest of the song.  No way to down-sample the snare into a
death-marching-drum.  A large issue for anyone looking to use the MC-303
for extensive recording!

The sounds of the supplied kits are good, if somewhat dated.  The 909 and
CR-78 sounds (especially with the additional sounds at the lower end of the
key range) are very useful, and the Jungle kit makes the whole thing sound,
well, correct.

Accenting on the MC-303 is very different from the TR-909's system.  With
the 909, you could accent (when available) a single beat by hitting that
button a second time.  There was also an accent 'instrument' which would
affect all instruments on a specific beat.  On the MC-303, there is no
equivalent of the accent 'instrument'.  However, for individual beats,
there are four velocity levels available.  By selecting the appropriate
accent level, it's easy to create a snare roll with a groove, or punch up a
hi-hat pattern.  However, the lack of overall accent makes "back-beat push"
a more tedious process.

The step -time programmer suffers from a significant load-time issue.  The
TR-909 had, for lack of a better term, an 'on-the-fly' character.  When I
used the 909, I generally stayed in WRITE mode, and made adjustments to a
pattern close to real-time.  I'd groove along with a pattern, then quickly
add or remove drum hits as I chose.  The MC-303 seems to use a different
process.  Each time the MC-303 is about to begin playing a measure, it
appears to 'snapshot' it into memory, and will then play back that 'image'
of that measure.  Hence, if I'm adding a snare roll to the end of a measure
while that measure is loaded into memory, only those drum hits that existed
at the time of the 'snapshot' will be played back.  This is much less
'organic' than the 909, and proves to be disturbing when trying to play the
303 as a real-time drum programming device.

Unfortunately, there are other reasons that will probably preclude me from
ever using the 303 as a real-time, write-mode device.  Basically, the rest
of the synthesizer is 'turned off' when you are doing step-time recording.
The means that you cannot change kits, adjust effects or filters or change
muting.  Since all of these options would be very necessary for write-mode
performance, the MC-303 loses major points as a live creativity tool.

On the other hand, as a straight rhythm programmer, the MC-303 has a number
of excellent extensions to the TR-909 interface.  A rhythm pattern can be
up to 32 measures in length.  These patterns can be in 2/4, 3/4 or 4/4
time, and can have up to a two measure count-in (for real-time entry).
There is also a real-time option that will wait for a note to be pressed to
start pattern entry.

The MC-303 also has a very nice muting system.  Rhythm programming is
available only on the 'Rhythm Part'.  However, when you use this 'Rhythm
Part', you have access to a second tier of mutes -- allowing you to
interactively mute/unmute any one of eight 'type' of sound (kicks, snares,
hats, claps, cymbals, toms/percussion, hits and 'other').  When using a
stored pattern during live performance, this muting function is great
modifying the rhythm dynamics.  The individual rhythm pattern mutes can be
stored with a pattern, or can be manipulated in real-time.  As with many
functions, if the mutes are done in real-time (i.e., if you are not
recording when you make the mutes), the mute changes will be lost when you
change patterns.

Real-time (non-step-entry) mode turns out to be very important for
programming rhythms on the MC-303.  First, during step-time programming,
you are unable to change mutes, effects levels, volume levels or filter
settings.  These can all be set (and recorded) when running in real-time
record mode.  In this way, a jungle-y filter sweep can be pre-programmed in
a pattern, giving you one less knob to turn at performance time.  During
the performance of a pattern, all of the stored settings can be overridden
by simply adjusting the appropriate function's controller.  Once you've
modified a function, the MC-303 turns over control to you, in essence
eliminating the internal stored function changes.  You maintain control of
that function until you change patterns.

So, how did I fare with the MC-303 as a rhythm programmer?  The load-time
issue really ticked me off initially.  It still does.  I was hoping that
the MC-303 could be a real-time creativity device in the same way that the
TR-909 was.  No such luck.  However, the good MIDI control (basically, grid
control of 108 MIDI notes), the four velocity levels and the real-time
adjustment are enjoyable, and I find myself writing pretty good percussion
tracks with the MC-303 as the controller.

Score:  5 1/2-out-of-10 Richie Hawtins  (minus 2 for the real-time
problems, minus two for lack of programmability, minus 1/2 for some static
digital sounds)


MC-303 AS A BASS SYNTHESIZER (the 303 factor)

Given the numbering scheme chosen for this box, the obvious question is
whether this can be used as a replacement for the ubiquitous Bassline.  The
short answer -- no.  And I'm not going to do the purest thing, OK?

As stated above, the MC-303 is strictly a digital sample-playback box.  In
order to make the 303 "acid-y", a real-time control of filter cutoff and
filter resonance was added.  Although these are welcome on any synth, it's
a bit too little in this case.  You are given a number of  TB samples to
manipulate, and pretty much have to do with those.  Your mileage may vary,
but I found the majority of them to simply be too tame.  The resonance does
not have a high degree of "squelch", there is only a single lowpass filter
option and the cutoff cannot be forced to key-follow.  Hence, a filter
setting appropriate for one set of notes may not be applicable for the
entire range of a pattern.  A quick scan of the MIDI implementation
verifies that there is neither a key-follow, nor any filter option other
than lowpass.  Again, there is little opportunity to modify the sound
chosen, although there are more options than with drum instruments.

The sequencer/programmer is excellent.  It is quite similar to the
TB-303/MC-202 style of programming, with entry of individual steps, rests
and ties, octave select buttons and the works.  As with the rhythm parts,
you can choose between four velocity settings for each note;  in addition,
there are four gate times available for each note (a la MC-202).  Very
flexible, and opens the door for some interesting programming.  Sadly, and
again like the rhythm programmer, you cannot enter real-time function
changes while in step time.  This really becomes crucial with TB-like acid
line containing slides and filter changes.

If you wish to enter slides, you can try it in real-time mode.  The slide
function is really a portamento (again, like the MC-202).  If you want to
program slides/portamento/filter-sweeps into your pattern, you simply
record the changes using the real-time recorder function.  While the
pattern plays, you can hit the portamento button or change the filter
setting, and the control movements will be recorded.  The only caveat --
there seems to be an operating system glitch that will mute notes that
appear too close to a portamento button it.  I believe that this is related
to the Portamento button's dual use -- when portamento is on for a channel,
that channel becomes a monophonic channel.  When it is switched off, the
channel is polyphonic.  This mode change may explain the glitches that
occurred when severely exercising the portamento button.  The solution is
to record the portamento changes at a _very_ slow tempo, giving plenty of
room around surrounding notes (if possible).  Filter changes, and other
real-time controls, do not seem to affect the sounding of notes.

The other problem I have with the pattern sequencer:  it's too difficult to
change information in a pattern.  Frankly, it has proven to be easier to
either live with a less-than-perfect pattern/track, or to completely
re-record it.  As a dedicated computer-sequencer user, you can bet I'm not
too happy about that.  Especially given the joyous big-chicklet keyboard on
the MC-303!

Pattern editing functions include:  Pattern and part copy (smallest unit -
one measure), pattern and part erase (again, smallest unit is one measure),
blank measure insert, key transpose (either the whole 'part' -- all notes
in one channel -- or a range of notes within a single 'part'), velocity
change (entire part - no changes for individual notes!) , gate time (again,
only the entire part), time shifting (entire part, again), data thinning
(no control over which functions get thinned -- all controllers for a part
are thinned!) and part quantize.  Grrrr.  This grew tiresome, and proved to
limit the complexity of part that I built into a pattern.

The other sequencing problem occurs with the MIDI implementation.  Simply
put, the MC-303 will not transmit anything beyond the MIDI note and
velocity information.  Why is this so important, you ask?  Well, here's my
situation.  I don't like the MC-303's internal TB-303 emulation.  I want to
use the Will System's MAB-303 I have.  The MAB uses the Portamento
controller to signal slides, and velocity changes to signal accents.  The
MC-303 will transmit the notes, and the velocity of each note.  That's
great.  However, the all-important slides (even when programmed into the
MC-303 as portamento controller changes) will not be transmitted!
Therefore, no slides on the MAB-303!  Since a number of 'boxes' are
appearing that will support MIDI controller messages (BassStation, MAB,
Pulse, etc.), the total lack of controller transmission means that the
MC-303 often cannot be used as a bass sequencer for live techno.
Troubling, since it would appear that is exactly what the MC-303 was
created for...

Finally, the output configuration comes into play here.  Two outputs for a
machine with drums, bass lines and pads is simply too few.  Even for live
performance.  Without the ability to manipulate the individual instruments
externally (with delays, filters or whatever), a lot of the flexibility
seems to be gone.

Score:  4 out of 10 Woody McBrides  (minus 2 for the sounds, minus four for
the sequencer limitations)


MC-303 AS A SEQUENCE PLAYBACK TOOL (the MMT-8 factor)

Given the above griping about the sequencer limitations, the lack of full
MIDI record and transmit, and the dichotomy between step-time and real-time
recording methods, you can bet I'm not expecting you to sell your MMT-8.
However, there are a few real positive things to say, here.

First, the mute functionality really excels.  Have the ability to mute
individual percussion sections (as stated in the DRUM PROGRAMMER section)
really puts the MC-303 a step above the MMT-8 for this type of programming.
Also, the inclusion of a serious quantize function really makes this thing
shine.  The quantize function allows you to 'dial in' the amount of
quantize to apply, and provides three types of quantize -- grid, shuffle or
'groove'.  As you might expect, used in moderation these quantize function
can spice up an otherwise sleepy track, and the templates available for the
groove quantize exceed those that are available in any of the software
sequencers I've been using.  Of course, there is no way to quantize one
track to another's contents, but that is a function that only recently has
been available in software tools.  In addition to 'dialing in' the amount
of timing effect, you can also 'dial in' the amount of velocity adjustment
that a groove quantize function will provide.

My only concern with the quantize functions has to do with the internal
timing of the MC-303.  The 303 is based on 96ppq timing, and it sometime
feels as though the quantize function 'steps' a bit too much.  My
assumption is that the granularity of the internal timing is adversely
affecting the smoothness of the quantize functionality.  I may be wrong,
and I've done no timing studies to verify this, but I can 'feel' the
quantize function jerk around the timing in an uncomfortable way.

The MC-303 includes an arpeggiator, and some of these functions are just
great.  The output of the arpeggiator can be recorded to the sequencer, and
can follow a number of internal templates.  Some of these templates are
excellent.  There are a number of arpeggiator templates that simulate
guitar picking and such.  However, I found that the "Sequence" options are
the best, especially if you make appropriate adjustments to the 'Accent
Rate' control.  If nothing else, these arpeggiators are incredible fun, and
could (perhaps) be used to spur some creative moments.

One final note on the sequencer functions.  There has been a lot of
discussion about the limited number of  user patterns (50), and the large
number of preset rhythms.  All true, but I've not run into many problems in
this area.  First, in addition to the 50 user patterns, you can enter 300
'Variation' patterns.  This is basically a pattern (either preset or user)
with alternate mute settings.  This may not seem that impressive, but it
provide incredible functionality when creating songs.  A song, on the
MC-303, is a string of patterns, each of which has one rhythm and seven
synth parts.  The way you end up programming a song is by creating patterns
that are 'chuck full' of tracks, then creating variations that mutes
combinations of tracks.  Using this paradigm, you can create 5 very full
patterns, then use mute variations to 'thin' the patterns into a song with
an appropriate structure.  All-in-all, this actually works fine for me...

In addition to the sequencer and arpeggiator, there is an additional
playback function -- the RPS, or Real-time Phrase Sequence.  The RPS system
allows you to assign parts (single tracks from a pattern) to a key, and
trigger that part at any time using the MC-303 keyboard.  Big fun!  The RPS
can use parts from either preset or user patterns, and this really broadens
what can happen during a live gig.  For example, last week I played a fun
little mini-gig.  I played MC-303, a friend played tape deck and noise
boxes, and some Goth Gal screaming somewhere along with us.  Like I said --
fun.  No rehearsals, no pressure.  I set up a real simple user pattern with
a bass part and a rhythm part.  I also set up a comprehensive set of RPS
keys to provide guitar wacka-wacka, breakbeats, synth turnarounds and other
fun stuff.  I had a blast, my friend thought it was a hoot, and (since I
was playing the works through someone's bass amp) no one got hurt.  This
really work similar to Studio Vision's MIDI Keys, and really can be used to
spice up a live set.  Well recommended!

One bug was found here -- if you do some odd combination of keystrokes (I
think that you have to select a new RPS set while the sequencer is running,
and is about to load another pattern, or something) the whole works
crashes.  It will either play some arbitrary pile of notes, or will simply
freeze.  When this happens (and, in the heat of the gig, it will),  keep
nodding your head, smile at your S.O., and reboot!  I expect this to be
fixed in the next rev...

Score:  7 out of 10 Orbitals  (minus four, again, for the poor MIDI record
and transmit, minus 1/2 for the perceived timebase problem, plus an
additional 1/2 for the variety of arpeggiations and grooves,  plus an
additional 1 for the way-cool RPS function.)


MC-303 AS TECHNO SYNTH (the legendary General Techno [tm] factor)

Well, it's a bunch of samples.  A pile of them are old-hat orchestral hits
that nobody outside of Ibiza would use.  Some of them are funky and nice.
A few of them transcend into the "gotta-use-'em" set.  The drums are
excellent sample sets.  However, tone modification is a bit of a bitch.
The following is a list of the modifications that you can make to the
sounds:

LEVEL
PAN (including RANDOM PAN)
PORTAMENTO ON/OFF and PORTAMENTO TIME
LFO RATE, SHAPE, AMOUNT and DESTINATION(PITCH, FILTER and AMP)
FILTER CUTOFF and RESONANCE
AMPLITUDE ENVELOPE ATTACK, DECAY and RELEASE
BEND RANGE

Does something seem to be missing?  Does A LOT seem to be missing?  Damn
right!  How about a high-pass filter?  How about an envelope for the
filter?  LFO delay?  Man, this is just depressing...  Perhaps I've not
gotten comfortable with SoundCanvas style synthesizer, but I doubt I will
ever get comfortable with exceedingly limited functionality.

Frankly, one thing that Roland, and other manufacturers making dance music
modules, must remember is the transient nature of the sound.  A sweeping
pad that is hot today will be anathema in three weeks.  No one significant
has user _that_ orchestra hit in five years.  My feeling is this -- over
the course of a few years, the MC-303 will be used as a driver for external
synthesizers, and the internal sounds (save for the drum kits) will seldom
be heard.

Given that, are there enough sounds to play with?  I guess.  The MC-303 has
become the box that I play with while I'm vegging in front of the
television.  Given that, I can find enough sounds to write with.  They get
replaced once I'm in the studio, but I can at least use them to get
started.

There is a special mode (called Sound Module Mode) in which the MC-303
becomes a 16-channel multitimbral sound module.  In this mode, the MC-303
responds to a number of MIDI controllers, and can generally be used to good
effect (given the limitations of the sample set and the single pair of
outputs).  Frankly, I tried this out, but will probably never use it in
this way...

Score:  4 out of 10 2Unlimiteds  (minus 3 for the dated sounds, minus 3 for
the limited programming options)


MC-303 AS ITSELF (the how-I-use-it factor)

So, you want to know how I've been using the beast, huh?  As I've said,
I've installed it as the watching-TV-productively tools of choice.  It
works fine for that.  I use it extensively as a drum programmer, and
occasionally for a step-time programmer that gets dumped to Logic Audio.
Some of the sounds are good enough that they get used in recorded tracks.
I took it to a live gig, and had fun with it (minus the crash...).  It
makes 14-year-olds I know very jealous.

Most of the net-news I've seen (including most of this one) is attempting
to compare the MC-303 to old Roland boxes, or even as the Great Hope (or
Satan) of  techno.  I've got a totally different read on this.  The MC-303
has replaced one synth in my life -- the Yamaha QY-20.  I've not had the
QY-20 for long, but I no longer use it, choosing to use the 303 instead.
It is reasonably portable (although not battery powered, yet), easy to
program in a variety of ways and pretty good sounding.  I generally use it
as a seed-bed, creating ideas which will eventually get moved to a more
serious sequencing or performance rig.

It's unfortunate that the MC-303 cannot be the be-all techno-box.  Perhaps
an MC-303 Pro should be made -- with more user patterns (i.e., no preset
patterns), complete MIDI handling by the sequencer, more editing and
synthesis functions, non-volatile sample memory and a higher timebase.  It
would probably cost $400 more to produce such a thing, but it would solve a
good number of my complaints with the MC-303 as it currently stands.

Worth the money?  I don't know.  Read the reviews, and read this little ol'
article.  If you think you can live with the limitation, you should
probably take one home.  Work with it for a few weeks, then decide.  If you
no longer want it, I'm sure there are a number of kiddies out there in
net-land just waiting to buy your used techno-box...

My own, personal score:  4 1/2 out of 10 Darwins.  Good enough to keep
around for a while, fun and occasionally useful, just not the majick I had
been hpoing for.

{And, in case you are wondering, I am in no way implicating that I exist in
the same stratosphere as Richie, Woody or even 2Unlimited...}

Well, after several days of vast adventuring (walked almost the entire
distance from cupertino stevens creek area to where it's not even called
stevens creek anymore... then walked el camino from sunnyvale to stanford
mall and back) I have finally procured a vehicle.

It is a 1985 Chrystler Fifth Avenue (read: boat).

PROS                     CONS
----                     ----
air conditioning         this thing is MASSIVE
plush phatty seats       pimpmobile - warez the fuzzy dice?
impact/death resistent   you wanna park?  bwhahaha
smooth ride              float feeling, like "sh*t i have no control"
didn't borrow money      $1300.23 w/tax+license

I would rather have an electric car, or cycle... or that darn second fiero
I kept trying to meet the owner to hook up (owner never there) (first fiero
was sold)

Hope it lasts for awhile until I can sell/trade/etc it!  Hope the police
find _my_ car!  (reminder: buy a club or similar anti-theft system, or plan
ahead for what you'll have to do if you lose your car)

peace,
Max

I think I may check out the XLR8R party tonight; on Friday, I would check
out Xanadu if I were in Sacramento ;).  The Ninja Tune show should be good
too, it's a different lineup than the one earlier this year.  Lotsa free
stuff and outdoor parties on this first official weekend of summer too.  
Check out Making Waves all around SF on Saturday, then there are several 
freebies on Sunday, including Sunset maybe.

hehe.. This reminds me of when my friend bought his tb-303.  He got his for
the extremely low price of $35.  No.. i didn't leave a zero off of the
price. Thirty-five dollahs!!!  Of course.. this was at a Pawn shop in
Texas, where they thought the 303 was a broken radio. DOH!  I guess it pays
to go thrift shopping every now and then.  ;)  Happy hunting!

That's cool. I'm definitely going on the 7th to see him spin. I think DJ
Trace is going to be there too. Maybe we could hook up then?
(considering I won't be going to Freedom this year (the 4th).

Yep. I've got it on CD w/ an extra CD mixed by DJ Trace. (virgin on
Market actually had several copies a few months ago.) I just bought SOUR
Records Millinium Jazz (an expansion of the last Jazz Step album
"shapeshifter" - super large!) and Grooveriders newest double CD.
Cost me 70 bucks man!
Anyway, I can make copies of all three if you'd like. (promo of course -
just in case any lawyers are reading this....)

Finally, another blast from the past:

Passion - Gat Decor

Classic!

UG Friends...
I didn't write this post...but i was astounded as to how much i
shared his view so i hope u will read this w/an OPEN mind... peace :)

    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -

You know, I love this scene.  I love it.  When I see a flyer for an upcoming
party, I just cant wait for it to arrive..  The music; an unending vibe
unifying us all for a night, the people; a multi cultural rainbow of
children of the era of plur dancing and joining together in a great
celebration of music, and finally, The Drugs...  It never seems to fail.
Druged out, coked out, acid eating idiots not giving a damn about anything,
not even their own lives..  I've come accross too many people in my time
that have a severe problem, yet just dont give a shit about their lives.
They treat me good, and we bond, as friends do.  But what about the non stop
worrying that accompanies this "great friendship"??  I hate it..  The one
thing about the scene that really fucks with my head and my heart..  I cant
just turn my back on my friends, yet showing them that someone actually
cares about them doesnt seem to shed any light on their darkness.....  I
accept the fact I cannot change someone, but I will always show them that I
do give a damn..  I recently quit drugs and alcohol myself..  I was never a
real bad user, but I have had my bouts with problems that accompany their
presence.  Am I the only one that feels this way??  I mean, what has come
over me?  I actually have no urge to do the things that I once did, and the
thing that caused this was watching what it did to people.  Its all shit, no
matter how you look at it.  P.L.U.R.???  What does peace love unity and
respect mean if we cant co-exist witout the sedatives that we use??  Why?
Why the need?I finally looked at it for what it was:  In order for you to be
totally happy, and to be totally at peace with yourself and your suroundings
(the life goal), you must finally accept things and look at things for what
they are.  Be at peace with them.  Help people.  Love one another.  But, you
cannot do this when you are strung up, for you are not actually looking at
the world in its actual light.  You are using a sedative..  Take it in the
face, fight against the dying of the light.  Give a damn about one another.
I mean shit, things arent getting any better people if we all continue to
destroy ourselves and one another.  Look around you.  This is reality.
Accept it.  I give a damn.  I do.

The original DJ-70 does have the scratch dial!!!  What the MKII added was 
: a new OS, a tap tempo feature, a global BPM matching feature and a SCSI 
interface.  The Roland techs told me that you can't wire the SCSI 
interface into the old DJ-70 (rat bastards!)
:)
I love my DJ-70!!!

Also check out "The Gaza" by Andromeda... almost the exact same song, 
just without the Columbia Records production crew behind it, and no 
irritating rapper :D

Subject: RE: why i'm a raver not a clubber
Sender: sfraves-owner@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

Lemme say this first:  I don't like clubs.  They tend to be a little 
meat-markety for my taste, and remind me too much of my school dances . . . 
but maybe I just haven't been to the right ones.  I'm underage, so my 
selection is a lil limited.  Maybe  I'm just bitter coz I can't get into most 
of them, eh?

But as far as club people being rude, well, some are, some aren't.  I've met 
some hella friendly and cool people at clubs, and I've met my share of people 
that I felt were a lil rude and shallow at raves (but maybe they were having a 
bad day, who knows).  And I'm talking about UG raves too, not massives.

Well, I guess people treat you a lil different when you're a black chick 
wearing a beanie. Hmmmm . . .

But anyway, I've been fortunate enough to meet enough beautiful people at 
parties and other places, so I always feel loved.  And I think most of you are 
probably just as fortunate . . .

So I guess I'm saying that no matter where you are, rave, club, or whateva, if 
you bring in good vibes, you'll get back good vibes, and you can block out the 
bad.  Oh, and I'll be wearing ponytails at Wonderland (saving the beanie for 
another fiesta, baby).

I never run out of questions.

1.  Is it still possible for me to get a copy of that Simon Apex jungle 
mixtape . . . it's called "In Da Jungle" or something like that . . . ?

2.  I heard he don't spin jungle no more.  Why?

3.  Anyone know when I can catch him next?

Thanx!

You might be right . . . that's why I said "most" and not "all."  Kraftwerk 
did a lot of great and original stuff and contributed a lot to the scene, but 
I still think house music did more.

Let me quit rambling on and on about house music . . . you all have to know by 
now you gotta give it the respect it's due.

LONG LIVE HOUSE MUSIC

Wow.
My announcement was premature.  No it wasn't stolen also :)  but it did
stop working.  I was driving home, going up 101, and it just lost
power.  Dead.  My friends saved me (thanks jason and adam!!)
So tomorrow the adventure continues as I try to fix my transportation
life.  This is starting to wear on me!  sigh...

Just my very humble opinion, but the best place to be this Friday in 
Sacramento would be Xanadu . . . I might be there to do a little dance, make a 
little love, and get down that night, u know . . .

My big problem w/ Playground:  the midnight performance by that Josette chick 
. . . that "In a Dream" song is just bad.  No remixing can make up for those 
weak vocals.  But I dunno, I'm not too into that type of music anyway.  I 
heard DJs from FM 102.5 are going to be there . . . now what's that all about?

I absolutely _LOVE_ house music, but when it's bad, it's terrible.

I hafta admit all diva vocals ain't bad.  Like that song that goes
"A little bit of ecstacy . . . a little bit of you and me . . . a little bit 
will set ya free . . . a little bit of ecstacy . . ."

Hey!  I'm one of those girls in the club that you can tell don't go to clubs 
regularly cuz no one knows them and they just don't seem to fit in.  And we 
come w/ our friends and take up the dance floor because we make little circles 
that we take turns dancing in.  We act kinda goofy and sometimes form soul 
train lines and do the running man or the cabbage patch.  And we request "I'm 
Too Sexy" so we can do our lil diva/model walk, and "Vogue" so we can do our 
sloppy ass voguing.  I personally like to request "Hoochie Mama" or some other 
2 Live Crew song so I can bust out with my perfected infamous _ghetto ass 
booty dance_  . . . you know the one that the girls do in those low budget 
miami rap videos . . . pump pump pump get it get it shake shake shake a lil 
sumthin.  Can't do that kind of stuff at a rave, wouldn't want to anyway.

I prefer raves to clubs, but when I do go I get my money's worth.  Cuz I have 
too much fun.  Plus I know all the _real_ club kids have just as much fun 
talkin about me.  It works out for everyone.

As the subject says, me and my girlfriend are going to SF on vacation June 26 - 
July 14th. We're looking for some good parties or clubs. The list on 
hyperreal.com is quite overwhelming and I need personal recommendations. Please 
mail me on mikerogers@usa.net, since I can pick up that mailbox remotely.

Been dancing with smiles since 1992. I like drill and bass, german trance 
(Tresor/Eye Q), nice squelchy techno, ambient jungle, the odd bit of get-up 
hardcore.

Favorite electronic music tunes: (at the moment)
Orbital, Semi Detached
Moby, Time Signature
Stretch and Vern, Get Up, Go Insane
Cygnus X, Superstring
Hardfloor, Reverberate Opinion
Aphex Twin, Ventolin
someone, Aphetamine
808 State, Mondonet
Beltram, The Melody
DJ Hell, Allerseelen
Sven Vath, Accident in Paradise
Perry and Rhodan, The Beat Goes Straight On And On
Robert Armani, Circus Bells
Hildenbeutel, Inner Peace
etc

Any pointers to clubs/events with this sort of selection?

Thanks,

Mike.

I wanted to recommend a correction or end up starting a really annoying 
thread, not sure which yet...

The XLR8R article and now this post both indicate that the new Gemini's
have a fault, that the quartz lock only works at zero and goes on to
indicate that this is not the case with the SL1200mkII.

The quartz lock only activates when the green light turns on on a 1200,
namely at 0.  So a Technics SL-1200mkII has the same "problem".

If the AC line level changes at any point while the turntable is playing
up or down at all from 0, there may be a slight (not audible, but
noticeable if you're dealing with two beatmatched records) difference in
speed.  This might be (I'm speculating here) why generator powered sound
systems tend to require more "babysitting" of beatmatched records (because
of the variations in power amp draw while working from load that reacts to
varying loads).

When you get your 1200's "calibrated" or "tuned" what they are doing is
adjusting the fader to have it's zero point right in the middle so it
matches with the switch for the quartz lock.

A Technics 1200 is only quartz locked when at +/-0 and the green light is
ON.

thingy anyway):

Yeah, I know this one's true.  I remember once one of my decks had two places

I don't know..

 When I first started raving. I had a GREAT vibe inside. Enough good vibes
to make anyone that looked at me SMILE! Yep. Anybody remember?
 But then people started tripping out. Thinking I was STUCK UP?!?!? because
I was "quiet" They started talking shit. Calling me names..
 Well. This made me somehow forget how to smile. Then people would say I
was faking my smile. No. I just forgot how to.
 So then I just started looked upset. And so on, and so on..
 Thanx peoplez!!!  

But. Now. I just have that I don't give a HOOT vibe. Yep. I need to defend
myself sorry..

Weird huh?

The Blue one's actually Audio Couture #1, and there's a new one this week,

Yup, Joe's right. I typed blue by accident, but I was referring to the
yellow one. And yes, it is Rob Haigh of Omni Trio fame behind both of
them.

Came across this and thought I'd share. Hope it hasn't been posted before....


To the meter of "The Raven" by Edgar Allen Poe...

      Abort, Retry, Ignore?

      Once upon a midnight dreary, fingers cramped and vision bleary,
      System manuals piled high and wasted paper on the floor, Longing
      for the warmth of bed sheets, still I sat there doing spreadsheets:
      Having reached the bottom line, I took a floppy from the drawer.
      Typing with a steady hand, I then invoked the SAVE command and
      waited for the disk to store, Only this and nothing more.


      Deep into the monitor peering, long I sat there wond'ring, fearing,
      Doubting, while the disk kept churning, turning yet to churn some more.
      But the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave not token.
      "Save!" I said, "You cursed mother!  Save my data from before!"
      One thing did the phosphors answer, only this and nothing more,
      Just, "Abort, Retry, Ignore?"

      Was this some occult illusion, some maniacal intrusion?
      These were choices undesired, ones I'd never faced before.
      Carefully I weighed the choices as the disk made impish noises.
      The cursor flashed, insistent, waiting, baiting me to type some more.
      Clearly I must press a key, choosing one and nothing more,
      From "Abort, Retry, Ignore?"


      With fingers pale and trembling, slowly toward the keyboard bending,
      Longing for a happy ending, hoping all would be restored,
      Praying for some guarantee, timidly, I pressed a key.
      But on the screen there still persisted words appearing as before.
      Ghastly grim they blinked and taunted, haunted, as my patience wore,
      Saying "Abort, Retry, Ignore?"

      I tried to catch the chips off guard, and pressed again, but twice as
       hard.
      I pleaded with the cursed machine: I begged and cried and then I
      swore.  Now in mighty desperation, trying random combinations,
      Still there came the incantation, just as senseless as before.
      Cursor blinking, angrily winking, blinking nonsense as before.
      Reading,  "Abort, Retry, Ignore?"

      There I sat, distraught, exhausted, by my own machine accosted.
      Getting up I turned away and paced across the office floor.  And
      there I saw a dreadful sight: a lightning bolt cut through the
       night.
      A gasp of horror overtook me, shook me to my very core.
      The lightning zapped my previous data, lost and gone forevermore.
      Not even,  "Abort, Retry, Ignore?"

      To this day I do not know the place to which lost data go.
      What demonic nether world is wrought where lost data will be stored,
      Beyond the reach of mortal souls, beyond the ether, into black holes?
      But sure as there's C, Pascal, Lotus, Ashton-Tate and more,
      You will be one day be left to wander, lost on some Plutonian shore,
      Pleading,  "Abort, Retry, Ignore?"

RED meat or WHITE mean? yummm... ;) I can't get into most clubs either.
I only go to JRs in walnutcreek which really really really suxs really
bad,
but then, I go cause its a cool place to sit, look at people interact
with 
each other, buy meat, sell meat, I love watching the wanna be divas walk
up with their noses up high in the air... :) we got PORK meat as well :)
I'm only 19 :( so JRs is my only choice around here...

TOtally! :) alot of poeple just have the "SNOB" attitude cause they are
*all that*
cause they are going to a club :) but... they aren't ;) at parties there
are people
who are SHALLOW and seem RUDE I would have to admit...let me tell you a
story,
once at a party called WARMTH (hi warmth crew! you rulez!) I was really
really
happy (you get the idea) and I went up to someone who I didn't know and
asked them
for a hug...they gave me dirty looks, said NO, turned around and walked
away...
OUCH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! how can someone do that to
someone else? ;(

Whaz up with this?
I didn't see Simple Pleasures on the RavE Calendar.

 My friend kinna talked me into going cause. Well. I don't want her going
with just girls. She gets JOCKED at the ravEs to much. And well. The ravEs
are pretty unsave for a beautiful Brazillian girl that dances sexy. You
ever notice when a "tuff guy" / lack of better words? Well when a tuff guy
gets up in someones face when they are looking for a fight? Well..They do
the same thing when there looking for a date. Waz up with that?


 Anyways... Here's some details on Simple Pleasures:

Friday, June 20th - Someone presents Simple Pleasures
Jim Hopkins, Pacaus, Tripnotix, Simon, Dan, Hippie, Kwashi, Essence
Visuals by Mr nStuff dancing nStuff. Oh. Just kidding.
9pm - ? Prolly 20bucks
800.611.2299  |  800.745.6464  |  415.263.0849  |  510.273.9083


There yea go. Maybe someone wants to goto the Beat RavEr extravaganza.

Hey kidz!

Fortunately, I had the great pleasure of having Ben & Iris (from Europe) stay with me, in my tiny little apartment.  Unfortunately, the went on there merry way, and are now staying with Adam M. 

They are here for 7 more weeks and will probably need more places to crash, and people to party with.  So if you have a free couple of days....... they would be so grateful.  These two English Ravers are soooooooo cool.  They love to party, dance, and most of all, play cards. =)

I believe Adam is taking them to F8, so if any of you go, look for them and say Hi!  They are really fun to talk to (English accent and all) I learned a lot of culture from these two. Have a great weekend wherever you go or whatever you do, but if your going to be at Wonderland I'll see ya there.=)

Much Love and fairy dust!
Julie

That place has really good food. Too bad they don't have Samoshas (sp?),
but I'm down for that place.

I'd love to make it but since I get to work at 6am, I have lunch from
10-11am. That blows. Maybe I'll switch lunch times with someone just for
the days of the S. Bay lunch.

Weds cool with me if I can make them.

Speaking of tapes I also will be bringing mine, two or three, to Wonder.
So the first two or three people to come up to me and ask get it.  Its
free.

Take care,

Did everyone else have as much fun as I did @ Space Odyssey too???
Nice vibe (a bit on the housey side round 1 -2 ish) but an overall good
time.

Hope to see all you raver types @ _FREE_ Friday and _F-8_ on Saturday /
Sunday.
And if I don't, well I wish all you guys and gals the best of the first
weekend of summer, wherever you adventures take you... (Now where'd I
put my suntan lotion?)


Be back soon,

wow, i guess Technics SL1200's are as silly as I've always said they
are (yet another hyped piece of "must have" equipment -- if you're not
graced by the presence of this overpriced boat-anchor, then your just
not cool enough to be a real raver).  My audio turntable (a 15 year old
Dual 714Q) has quartz locked direct drive with phase-locked pitch
control. all you need is a phase-locked-loop circuit and you can
quartz-lock at variable speeds. such a circuit could be designed by a
junior-year electrical engineering student, or pick up a 40 year old
book on servo control theory and figure it out for yourself.

to have a supposedly quartz locked turntable that is dependent on line
voltage/frequency, well, that takes the cake. How lame can you get?

Y'all should check out the Vestax turntables (the ones with the +-50%
speed control and the ability to play backwards).  They seem pretty
cool, but then again, I couldn't give a hoot about turntables -- I mix
w/ CD's and I think vinyl sucks. Digital rules.

PS: i guess it'll take the whizzes at Technics another 10 years to
figure out that you don't need a overweight, resonant, hard to
manufacture curved tube for a tonearm. do the geometry -- a straight
tube with an  angled headshell will do the same thing, but will track
better (less rotational inertia), and won't resonate as much. but then
again, i guess it just doesn't matter much.... vinyl is a fundamentally
flawed medium, a living anachronism... improving a turntable like the
1200 is probably about as useful as fitting a dinosaur with
rollerblades. :-)

PPS: anybody want to buy a Technics SL-1100A (the granddaddy of the
1200??) it works fine, just needs a little tonearm adjustment and a new
cart/needle. Seems to be no different from the 1200 other than being
heavier and more clunky looking; it has a rotary pitch control rather
than the linear one. Make an offer for this dinosaur. Rollerblades not
included.

I've tried several different decks for mixing, there's just a better feel when
using 1200's.  I'm sure there are better sounding decks, but when you're using
them for more of a "tool" comfort is everything.

Actually, I think his point was that vinyl/turntables in general suck.

But even though I am aware of all the technical arguments, I still like to
have the feel of the record under my fingers as I cue it up, let it go,
and keep it in sync :)

hello all-

this monday, the 23'rd of june, will be a monday night dinner organized by
yours truly, matthew d. p. k. lanier.  the monday night dinner was a
tradition started about a year ago, and has served as a way for many
sfravers to meet each other in person in a relaxed setting.  it's also
served as a way for several newbies to get ushered into the scene...

so, here's the skinny...

when - monday, june 23'rd at 8:30
where - kan zaman, a wonderful little restaurant at haight and parker
(more detailed addresses to come)
who - you!

why - because it's fun.

rsvp - please, to matt@lanier.org (a different address from this one)

so, come on down and eat with me and other mysterious raver types!


matt =)

Well it's DJ SS's label and the word is that it's his piece. However,
if it's going the way the color series did, it is either SS or Mental
Power. Doubt it's L-dub but I might be wrong.

-SCiEnCe

ps- that track is the bomb.

Well I like 1200's and the cureved tone arm Im no Tech Eng. wizard so
I don't know the schematics of it but a bent tone arm works better for
me. And Analog in MOST not all but most cases is better to me than
digital. Why should we let some doctor dictate what our ears can hear
and what decibals that a Human can hear at. That is pure bull shit!!

Sorry my $0.02

Love,
Macadio

Oh yeah, I know what you mean.  I remember about 15 yrs ago (ouch) putting a
rekkid on my parents old Grundig cab stereo thingy and playing a boom box for
background beats.  Using the the volume controls for desired effects and just
start scratchin the H_ll out the rekkid.  That old Grundig was so spongy nad
hard to control, but eventually I got it sound pretty good. :)  Whew... major
flashback.  Yeah, yeah what a difference a pair of 1200's can make. ;)

Actually, I think his point was that vinyl/turntables in general suck.

But even though I am aware of all the technical arguments, I still like to
have the feel of the record under my fingers as I cue it up, let it go,
and keep it in sync :)

get to see:

 representing SFR: Monty(Justice League)
					Simon(Come-Unity)
					John Howard
					 Taj 
					& closing guest TBA...

for the same price it costs you to wake up in the morning--Nothing.  We'll

well mY opinion is...(even though no one asked)...i never wear earplugs to
parties.  but i also don't stand in front of the speakers and worship
them.  some of these peoples ears are really bad.  cause they always say
it's not loud enough.  man you guys better be careful, cause if you don't
give the ears a rest from the sound it will do damage.  im no health
expert, but i am a believer in the natural deepfog healing powers.  he he.  

hi AndyW!  Have you talked to AndreaW. lately?

on Saturday night you will get this incredible incredible urge to go have
a smart drink somewhere and listen to tosome of the latest intellegent
dance music on biggie speakers (this is a new 99 cent item at
Wendy's)...at Wonderland.  i suggest going there.  macadio is going to be
a thrill to listen to....so is micorn i mean micron, and who else is
psinning?  i dunno.  but i've had the chance and privelege to hang out
with andy a few times ( the CEO of Wonderland ) and he's a cool guy cause
he donates a lot of time and equipment to the SFR party collective.  What
I am trying to say, is...he dESERVES your ten dollars!

Okay, it's on.  Thanks for all the responses!!  If anyone wants to bring music,
stickers, toys, paint, stuffed animals etc. please do! 

DIRECTIONS:

>From 280-get on 880 north (Oakland) and follow the directions below.

>From 880-get on 101 north (San Fran) and follow the directions below.

>From 101:
Take the San Tomas exit and go west (?) 
[If you have been driving south it is a right, for north it is a left]
After a couple of miles turn LEFT on BENTON.
IMMEDIATELY turn RIGHT on MARYANN.
Turn RIGHT on PATRICIA (great names, don't you think?)
After one block the road will come to a T, I am right in front of you.

2468 Karen Drive.
 
Walk around the right side of the building to get to our front door, #3.

These simple directions will minimize confusion and the risk of getting lost,
even if it is a bit longer.

If you have questions or get lost, call (408)241-1046.

Feel free to show up about 6 or 7-ish.  Later is fine too, but don't miss the
love boat to Wonderland.  "I'm late, I'm late, for a very important date!"

Everyone and anything is welcome to the party, as long as it has a good vibe!

If anyone knows Alaska, please invite him.  Alik aka Earthlen will be there
for those of you who know him or would like to!  (Wouldn't we all?)

Thanks everyone, I can't wait!

Pixie sticks and DJ tricks...

Why does this "debate" matter? What difference does it really make if you
listen to House music, trance, techno, Jungle, in a barn, a car,  a jail
cell, a fucking out house, or in a warehouse or a club? Any of you "ravers"
that want to distinguish themselves from "clubbers" so much ever go to MAD?
Then you're a "clubber" too. 

I cant believe people are actually trying to make themselves feel superior on
the basis of where they go to hear music.

It's no wonder why anytime issues of race, ethnicity, gender and sexuality
get brought up on this list, they turn into flame wars of attrition. A lot of
people here can't even be accepting of differing music styles and VENUES,
much less of the diferring types of people who attend these events.

Take it with a grain of salt - Warp records have already confirmed that
Aphex Twin is not confirmed to play at any of those dates.

Heck no. Being old is a state of mind not a matter of years.

Anyway, I almost became jaded and disillusioned w/ things (rave
"electronica", etc.) for awhile.
I guess it's because I was going through hard core studies of political
science (concentration: political philosohpy - Graduated CSUS - took me
freakin' years tho) and I saw a lot of hypocrisy in the scene based upon
what I was learning and what I believed.
There was a lot of junk propaganda during those times.
There was a period of time when promoters really tried to attach
themselves to these ideals of utopia and peace and happiness as
something that raves would accomplish - y'know, change the world.
Anyway, this stuff was pure marketing and it soured my experience w/
individuals. Being a DJ probably didn't help either (whenever money
enters into the picture, intents and ideals quickly change and/or get
prostituted).
I just started buying records that I wanted to hear only (my girlfriend
hated it at the time 'cuz I started buying real mellow house -
emotionally based techno) and stopped going out. But seeing how raves
have evolved as off late (backing off of the whole "raves will change
the world" , "just pay your $25 to find out how!") and letting them
just be what they are - really great enviroments for like-minded people
to enjoy others as well as the music.
I'm sure that there are people that still try to espouse these ideals
(and I don't want to take away from how they feel necessarily), but the
"rave ideals that will change the world" is too unrealistic.
Nowadays I feel more comfortable approaching the scene again w/o
worrying about people's intentions.
I guess my problem was that I held these potential ideals really high
and to compromise them through a medium that wasn't prepared to
translate them into the real world (you know - preach to the
non-converted) was not right.

Well ... that was my deep thought for the day. (time to go to sleep.)

Andy P is throwing Wonderland (the P is for Promoter).

AndyW is spinning at Wonderland (the W is followed by a lot of
consonants).

I tend to get upset when spending time with the Andy P, because people say
"Andy", and it's almost always to talk to him.  Whaaa.  Other than that,
he is an all around nice person.

Wonderland should go off, lots of wild, nutty DJ's (who will be straining 
to get your brainwaves properly synchronized with that one funky dance you 
like to do).

Hope to see some of you there.

Furthur!
AndyW

p.s. Props to whoever designed the flyer for the KickDrum party 7/18/97.
Almost laughed my ass off when I saw it last night.  I'd explain, but it's
just this picture is so damn funny... I can't explain why it's so perfect.
It's just a kid, and a quote, but it's so classic.  Check it out please...

WOW!!!!! This thing is super cool.  I've listened to both CD's over and
over.  I'm currently recording it so I can have some pimp daddy tunes to
listen to in my muticolored automobile.  

I have to give PHAT props to all the crew that put this thing together. 
It is totally radical (80's flashback there).  I must say in order to
save some despair that may be endured by anybody, GO BUY IT NOW!!!!  If
you miss out on this, you've missed out big time.

Well that's that.

Most people give $.02

I give ya'll $.03

gee i didn't intend my post to start a flaming club vs. rave thread.
i was just bored at work and was thinking about how much i preferred
raves over clubs. 

if you want to flame, flame me for bringing out my point of view. for
telling you how *i* feel about the situations, music people at
clubs/raves. for sharing my experiences with the scene. 

i know i was condescending towards the club scene but i in no way was
trying to be superior. i made some of my points a bit grandious but it
was all in good humor. (or was the post not clear enough?) 

sorry if i'm not as opened minded as you. sorry if i'm not well
rounded enough to enjoy high energy music. is it me? i didn't read any
flames. i didn't read any "you suck you stupid #$%*, clubs are way
better than raves." i just read a bunch of messages from people who
shared their views on the topic. it's almost as ludicrous as expecting
everyone to keep their mouths shut about party reviews because they
might offend someone by saying "the dj spun shiity music, the people
were tweekers yadda yadda." eesh! sorry for not conforming to
everyone's ideals. my ideas and how i feel are from my past
experiences.
so if my parents were devoted nazi's, then hell! i'd probably hate you
all and hang you up a tree!
hehe but they're not so i'm just a raver kid from the bay area.
:) veann

p.s. if anyone wants to flame me, please do so privately =)

IRC stands for INTERNET RELAY CHAT :) its not something you can access
through NetScape :(

if you have a PC, go to http://www.mirc.co.uk and download
MIRC for windows :) then, install it, and go on IRC! :)
there should be an IRC FAQ somewhere on da web :)

we gotta talk to people on Hyperreal so that they can put the
MIRC or IRCle files on hyperreal so that other can download 'em 
and chat :)

I'm not a guitar player, but I've played music with many of that
species. They all tell me they play the strat because it is
flexible. It has three pick-ups so you can get mellow to harsh; a wide
variety of timbres from the guitar. It us used in jazz, heavy metal,
every kind of music. None of those cheap plastic Rolands (tb-303,
sh-101, mc-202, etc.) has this quality. I'd say the tb-303 is the
Montgomery Wards Dan Electro imitation of the 90's.  (I havn't got my
facts completely straight, so correct me if I'm wrong) The Dan Electro
was a very cheap guitar made using surplus lipstick containers for
pickups. BUT, by accident, it had a individual, gritty, stand out
different sound that many people liked and used. That's what the
tb-303 is also. AN ACCIDENT used in a creative fashion that everyone
is copying. It does not have the classic instrument status of the
strat. No one who could afford a MiniMoog, a Jupiter-8, or an Arp 2600
would even bother looking at the tb-303. I doubt it was even marketed
towards musicians. Just like people couldn't afford a stratocaster
might end up with a Dan Electro. That said, comparing the tb-303 to a
strat is kindof an insult to a tb-303.

=Darrel (cut my teeth on Buchla synths, and played a Roland SH-5
through a DynaKit tube pre-amp for distortion and a Sano
"Computa-Rythm I" through DeltaLab DL-4 and Moog filter in Ice Cream
parlors back when Kraftwerk was cheezy pop music, so don't fuck with
me! :) )

PS: I have a 1957 Fender Duo-sonic that sounds better than a strat,
but is not as flexible :P

Yeah!!! "Schooooooool's out for Summer!! Schooooooool's out for Eva!!!" Does any one remember that song, or am I really out of my brain right now from staring at my MAC all day?? 8-/ He, He.

The vibe is going to be so thick this weekend I can feel it today!! Rave Safe this weekend, and every weekend!!!! Lot - o - Luv to all of you!

Much love,
Julie

I think someone has mentioned this before, but can people use private
email instead of posting things like the following (I made this up as an
example)--

HI ALL you leetle sfwavers! :) :) :)  *smoochy star love kissies*
I'm going to a rave tonight with all my bestest friends and we're all
bringing toys and lotion and candy!!!! *SQUEAL*
Hi John, Mary, and Bob!  I wuv you!


I think you guys get the picture ;)  I'm all for lovey-dovey stuff some
of the time, but wading through a mailbox filled with messages like this
can get tedious, if not mildly nauseating...

not a flame, just a comment,
Timothy

Full agreement with you on this one. The Tb-303, 808, 909 were regarded
as CHEAP, CHEEZY TOYS by electronic musicians everywhere back when they
were released in 1981 (for tb303). This is why i find the unthinking
trendoids reverence towards these boxes so comical and worth-poking-fun
at nowadays. They're still just as cheezy now as they were then... Do
you all start howling at how the theremin is the cornerstone of cheezy
sci-fi movie soundtracks and observe 5 minutes of silence every time
somebody mentions its hallowed name? I think not. Maybe I'm just not
into idolatry as much as you all. I find it kind of sickening to hear
ravers talk about how everybody is a star and they don't worship people
like they did back in the old rock and roll days. And instead, they
start worshipping a machine, which, in my opinion, is even more
sickening.

That and the elitism -- because these boxes are hard to find and really
seriously overpriced for what you're getting (unless you buy it from
somebody's grandma who is cleaning out their attic) -- because you're
not considered "cool" unless you have one (e.g. Fatboy SLim's
"Everybody Needs a 303"). Perhaps y'all can form some kind of
priesthood and bless and annoint your flock with a filter sweep and a
well-placed slide? 

Well, whatever. It's just a tool. That's my point. I find it funny to
see how pissy people get when one calls their gods out into the light
and sees them for what they are.

Last  word on this, pleeze?

Vague is my middle name....

Getting... uh...stuff from strangers is dangerous, getting to know what
good stuff tastes like is one way avoid taking too much stuff that may not
be...good stuff.

That said, beware this...stuff that has a super-strong soapy aftertaste,
some people had this stuff last weekend and some of them are just now
recovering... Besides the soap (not bleach) like aftertaste, goose bumps,
tingly scalp, feeling cold, initial dizziness, and not being able to sit
down were reported as side effects.  The scary thing is, these people
didn't know anything was wrong until the next evening, when they compared
stories of the morning after.  One person spent the morning picking lint
out of his carpet, another person spent the whole day cleaning the back of
every CD in his collection.  All of them noticed obsessive behavior and
suspension of reality.  The latter effect lasted 3-4 days...  

This stuff could be really bad if some one takes it, then thinks they are
going to sober up by morning to drive home...  Or work...

Hope this saves somebodies week. Hope this pisses nobody off!  (Notice the
lack of names, places, and substances...)

I totally know what you mean, wish gets like that sometimes, I guess 
it's because it's not UG and lots of *homies* which don't have anything 
do to on wednesday night show up... However alot of times they have 
really good music going, and it's a small place, and definetly somewhere 
you could go on wendesday night and listen to good music, dance, and 
meet your friends...

I checked your source out, and the existence or nonexistence of quartz lock
at speeds other than zero is not specificaly mentioned. On the other hand,
The Technics SL1200MK2 manual is quite clear on the subject "... pitch is
variable contiuosly (analogically) by up to aproximately 8% under total
quartzlocked control." Do you mean to sugest that Matshusita are lying?

hey everyone,
     i haven't posted to the list in a long time. but, now i feel the need to
speak. i consider myself both a raver and a clubber. nikita, come-unity,
space (in san jose), the velvet shop (in SJ as well), spundae, and many
others don't deserve to be lumped in the same category as city nights and the
soundfactory. i could have commented on many things, but i just chose a few.

>  *you make soooo many new friends rather than just some guy who wants
>  your number and turns out to be some gad awful player who thinks he's
>  "the bomb"

some of the coolest ppl i have met have been on nights when i've gone out to
nikita, come-unity, roots, and the list goes on. if you have a bad attitude
(thinking that you are better or more enlightened because you are a "raver"
and all others are just "vibeless clubbers" for example) with ppl, then you
won't meet any new ppl at all. also, you can meet shady ass guys anywhere,
including parties, not just at clubs.
 
>  *better music (okay so i'm biased. i don't like high energy music with
>  high pitched whiny voices... my bad)

this statement is way too biased. some of the best damn djs i have ever heard
in my life have been at clubs. i seriously doubt that i will ever see carl
cox (the number one dj in the world and with good reason) spinning at some
party. face it, clubs will pull in the best djs in the world (not just house
djs, techno and trance djs as well) and they will go off!!!!! 
 
>  *i hate that circle (i'll say it once again:) when two people are in
>  the center dancing and everyone else seems to crowd around them and
>  just watch.  ooo big pet peeve :P

i've never had the unfortunate experience of seeing a cirlcle in any club.
but, i have seen them at many a rave that i've gone to.   
      i might add, that at clubs, you can laugh, dance, hang out against the
wall, smile, chain smoke, drink tons of water and whatever else you want with
no problem. i've also noticed another thing. many ppl on this list have the
same negative kind of attitude that they think the "clubbers" have. go out
and experience some of what a club has to offer instead of judging everything
by one bad experience. it won't damage your UG values if you open up your
mind a little.

much love to all and see you at origin on saturday.

Acid Rock is the Sound of the Underground- All night psychedelic dance parties. The sound is driven by insane and warped sounds created on a Fender Stratocaster by Jimi Hendrix (a God to be worshipped).

1987-1997

Acid House is the Sound of the Underground- All night psychedelic dance parties. The sound is driven by insane and warped sounds created on a Roland TB303 by the many, many faceless producers (not Gods, merely people) of Our Generation.

The TB303 absolutely IS the Fender Stratocaster of our generation!

I don't wanna whine and start a big race debate, but I don't like the tendency 
of a lotta folx to classify certain types of folx as "homies" or "ganstas" or 
"hoochie mamas," etc., and assume that these people are ghetto, negative, 
rude, or mean.

So if you see somebody at a party/club/whatever, who may be a minority, 
wearing baggy clothes (or maybe tight & revealing clothes if they're female), 
maybe speaking a little of dat "ebonics," please don't assume that they're not 
cool, accepting, and sweet.  Cuz they might be.

How many times have I told of my beanie experience?  Well, like I've said, I 
think it kinda sux that people treat me different when they see I'm a black 
chick sportin a beanie and some big jeans, no matter how big my smile is . . . 
Golly, what happened to all that PLUR, hmmm?

I'm _NOT_ accusing Alik (cuz you seem like a big sweetie :-) ) or anyone else 
of stereotyping, or being a racist--I'm sure if you look at your behavior and 
thought processes, you can surmise for yourself whether you are or you aren't. 
 So NOBODY GET MAD!  I'M NOT UPSET, just concerned, and I'm not accusing 
anyone of anything!  Who the hell am I to judge?  It's jus the use of the word 
"homies" just kinda freaked me out, cuz I know that can entail some negative 
perceptions of certain groups of people, dat's all.  I _DON'T_ know who 
exactly Alik was talking about when he used that word, all I know what I 
_THOUGHT_  he might mean.  So I repeat that I'm not trying to flame him, cuz 
I'd do that off the list anyway, like everyone should :-).

I'm not saying that if you see some brotha looking like Snoop Dogg or Dru Down 
at the next party, you should give him a big hug and slap some stickers and 
glitter on his cheeks.  Matter of fact, I don't think you should do that w/o 
asking to anyone, cuz you never know if they'll be comfortable w/ it or 
appreciate it.  I would :-), but everyone's not like me.

Just be careful not to prejudge folx, yes?

xoxo--Miccaela

Hun just for a clarification, I call homies everybody, and you're my 
homie too =) (ofcourse only if you wanna be) , I use alot of slang, and 
it sounds pretty funny since I have a russian accent, so when I used a 
word homie, I knew somebody would take it the wrong way, so that's why I 
put *homies* (in asstrects) so people would recognize me using that word 
in a joking way.. and I never meant it to be disrespectfull.

Man.

 You sure can talk alot.  =]:..
 I will have to read your post agian before it is totally understood. But.


You have a Roland JP-8000 right?
I have a major question about this keyboard. And I have not found the
answer anywhere online. Which is scarey. Please have the answer I am
looking for.

Is the JP-8000 capable of pitch bending? I mean does it hold the note for
desired lengths? And layer with the following notes? Ect? It does this like
the 303 right? Totally step programble too...Right nStuff?

Don't get me wrong though. I plan on using it in real-time too!  =]:..
For when I want to get that certiant "feeling" nStuff.





Please respond.
Thanx.
Jeff

I must give a strong second to sister Dorena's post.  But I guess I am one
of those old-skoolers so my view is from a person who remebered when this
all started, was very very fresh and very very new.

I know that many of you are new to all of this and many of you are
old-ass-timers like myself (yay!).  More power to you all.  I must say that
what all of this has become is one massive club.  As one person in XLR8R
put it, "Rave is dead."  Rave, beleive it or not, at one time was UG.  They
were the same thing.  It was exclusive only to the extent that you had to
work to find out where things were going to be at, as well as the
possibility of:
-The party moving last minute
-The cops busting the place at ANY minute.

To me, w/o these two elements at a minimum all you have is a club.  I have
lost hundreds of dollars going to clubs that have been busted or moved.  I
have been to raoming parties that were NEVER in the same place, and threw
parties with that in mind.  There is nothing like the tension of being in a
break-in, or a muni-yard, or a hill, or someplace that is DESTINED to be
busted.  All you hope for is that the next beat that will be dropped is not
your last.  Unless you've experienced this you wouldn't understand.  The
collective of people was not around a slogan of plur, we didn't need that.
All anyone needed was some good beats and the family was formed.  Nothing
is greater than dance to bring people together.  The DJ's and the people
who threw these "raves" knew this and it showed in the intensity of thier
music (nobody can or ever will come close to Jeno, Ernie, Josh, Markie,
and countless others during the hieght of this period).  Like I said, w/o
the tension all you have is a very well organized, bustproof party.

IMO, people are very, very spoiled.  Pre-sale tickets, with all the good
intentions make our scene even more overground.  These days it seems more
like a bill graham production than anything else.  DJ's are now superstars
with all the glamor and paparrazi and hookers that would make even some
rap/rock(long dead,IMO) stars would envy.  There was a time when you didn;t
know the DJ's name, but he put you in a place that you would not soon
forget.  Why?  The tension.  What tension do we have these days?  Let me
count the gripes and moans.  The tension these days amounts to "people" not
dancing (huh?), people throwing bad vibes (huh?), & the ubiquitous people
with attitude (huh?).  No wonder people have been taking GHB and other dumb
drugs.  If that's was all the tension that surrounds parties these days I
would probalby be a GHB junkie too ;).

Nope I am quite afraid that all of what was is no longer and many are left
grabbing at straws for the real deal.  No, it's not a matter of being
jaded, it's a matter of people and what brings them together, and what
binds them in the dance.  It is tension, it is struggle done together.  The
music is the glue, and the DJ cures it for us, whoever that may be.

There was a time that everyone danced.

So to me I am not a raver, but am a former raver.  I am not a clubber
either.  I am just me, a person who really enjoys house/techno/jungle in a
good setting, and seeing/partying with the friends I have made through the
years.  We've all grown up together, gotten really high together, and
shared something that came once and is often imitated, but has YET to be
duplicated.

The fact that people have created two camps of people and can distinguish
themselves is further proof of the de-evloution.  At one time, beleive it
or not, there was ONLY rave.  And rave was the only thing that mattered.
We never had time to talk about clubbing or clubs, but we sure did know
(through the phone) when the next rave came along.

I sure do hope some of the youngbloods get off their butts and do it like
we used to, UG.  No flyers, just word of mouth (this should work unless the
community is so communication weak that it cannot muster some 600 people
via word of mouth).  No club, how about a warehouse?  How about an
unpermitted outdoor spot?  How about right here in the city where your
chances are slim, but if you pull it off it could be the one you were
waiting for...but I think that people think about their pocketbooks, and
are far too worried about being locked up to have true heart.

Props to the old-skool, and props the the new skool who know that the fuck
I'm talking about, and moreso are doing it.  You know who you are.

Much peace & dance,
Have fun,
John

P.S.  If I hear a slam about old-skool one more time I'm gonna get riled
up. W/o Old-skool there wouldn't be no rave in this city, no four color
flyers, no good DJ's, no record stores/stores, no mags, no good sound
systems, no nuthin'.  So unless you know some history, please watch who you
disrespect.  Better yet why not just try to do better, everyone will
benefit.

P.P.S.  Did you know that "back in the day" we didn't have ANY fights, no
OD's, no emergency rooms, and no guns, no 'tudes.  Just guys in bright
colors, and bra-booty-betty's (you missed it!) shakin' it and breakin' it.
Huggin and cryin' dancin and never lying.  No slogans, just the beat...and
the ass would ALWAYS follow.

P.P.P.S  Nope I don't NEED to go to no rave and see all the bright new
faces UNLESS there is some tension of a real UG event.  You know the type,
could get busted, could have only 1/2 a sound system (anyone remember
equinox in Hunter's Point!  Ivan & Leise?  No?), might have to move any
minute?  Ever seen a caravan in the full moon light...600 cars heading into
the moon like 600 pure bred sons of bitches on horseback?  All these
memories will be like tears in the rain...time to die.

P.P.P.P.S  Remember when Ameba was the central spot (along w/ the Be-At
line) to find out the haps?  Now all you gotta do is log on...

P.P.P.P.P.S  Who started Full Moon's?  Who is Rave Called Sharon named
after (first & last name please)?  Where was the FIRST Toon Town?  The
First Basics?  The First Gathering?  The first Eklypz?  Where were you when
you first heard "Feel it!" by coco-steel& lovebomb?  Who played "Atom Bomb"
by Dj Pierre first in this city?  How many map points have you been to
since moving to the city, or at all?

"What is house music?  A unique form, a unique form of music." - DJ Pierre

"Without a foundation, all you got is dirt." - JSL

Props to all that care, and much respect to those who are still doing it,
and much luck to those who have yet to do it.

a few weeks ago I was at 1015 on a friday night and it was packed with the
usual scam-a-wham peoples and was a real energy sucker as far as crowd
goes.  Nonetheless I remembered who I was and got into some groove and for
about thirty seconds I found myself in an alternate club dimension...
Whoever was spinning hit some rare funk and threw out some serious vibe.
I caught it and it picked me up like king kong with a baseball glove.  In
the middle of all the wandering hungry eyes, big hair, ck-1 and all that I
found thirty seconds of the Good stuff and was loving it. Someone handed
me a flyer just like that and I knew I was doing something right.  People
looked at me funny like I was doin something wrong but I didn't care I was
ridin the train. 

too bad it was only half a minute.

I CAN'T WAIT!!!

Well, I'm staying up extra late tonight so I'll sleep in extra late tomorrow 
so I can rest up and fix my body clock so I can stay up all nite at Wonderland 
and drive all the way back to Sacramento.  So I thought I'd tell you all too 
look for me and say hi!

Got my outfit all picked out.  A neon and white striped fuzzy shirt and flared 
jeans.  And like I've told a lot of folx, I'll be the lightskinned black chica 
in the ponytails.  I don't think there will be too many of those there ;-), so 
I shouldn't be hard to pick out.  I'm bringing 4 friends plus 4 friends of 
friends, all from Sacramento, and they're super folx, so say hi and give them 
lotsa love too!

You all betta be at Wonderland.  But no matter where you party, have lotsa fun 
and stay safe, just like Amanda said.  That means drink lotsa water, always 
have friends  around if you end up in any shady areas of town, don't put 
anything in your body if you don't know if it's safe!

But don't listen to what your mom said.  Talk to strangers!  And take candy 
from them!  Cuz my lil newbie crew is passing out Pixie Stix and you'd better 
take some!

I'm expecting lotsa hugs!

xoxo--Miccaela

insomnia) that FTT is throwing a  party down in LA
and it's doc scott and j magik and ed rush who are supposed to be down there
and i also heard they're booked in FLORIDA the same night (the fifth of july)

does anyone know for sure which one they're actually going to BE at? 
just wonderin' cuz we're cruising on down to LA for that weekend anyway 
and it'd make it the TRIP OF A LIFETIME if i could see them while i was 
down there..
anyway thanks you all much and hope to see you at wonderland! :)))
big day for me tomorrah...
love you all!

mini review
I was _vastly_ disappointed by the Ninja Tunes that I heard tonight.
After paying my 20$ to get in with assurances that the music was really
jungle but that it just varied a lot, I went into a mass of shoulder to
shoulder club people (a few ravers in sight, most standing still actually)
and this blaring RAP music the DJ was happily (and possibly skillfully but
I couldn't tell) spinning.  It didn't take long for me to realize, this
wasn't a rave, wasn't a club that was like a rave, wasn't jungle, wasn't
dub, wasn't anything but rap rap rap.  A little bit of slow r*b and rap
beat to accompany, but that's it.  I looked around thinking "I double
checked, yep this is xmission theatre, and those are images of ninja masks
flashing amongst the graphics..."

Earlier this afternoon I was at a coffee place next to the Juice Club in
Cupertino.  De Anza college kids hang out there.  A live band was playing
a sort of upbeat jazz/modernish bit that I swear moved me and felt a lot
more fun.  I was the only person who spent some time dancing to it
... but I should have hung out longer there and save myself the trp to
SF!

Sorry if I offended any rap fans out there, becuase I'm sure that kind of
music has it's merits, and perhpas the ninja tunes were great for their
genre, but I was one unsatisfied raver for certain!

Love,
Max

Let's see here, now who is using caps, and who is calling who stressed out.
I guess that's the difference between where I am coming from and wehre
you're coming from.  Not to start a flame, but:

-I use my real name (i.e. John S. Lee bka John S. Lee bka John S. Lee)
-And I have the benefit of history, which I am proud to have shared with so
many here in the city.

As for the rest of my post, unless you can cite specifics I would consider
this nothing more than a troll.  Anyway...

Geez...instead of citing what disturbed you all you didi was a half-assed
troll for flames...yes, I long for the old days when people converesed
instead of starting nonsense.  In any case, PLUR we don;t need, you are
correct.  Smootchies?  What the fuck is that?  I guess someone better
fed-ex me a teddy bear and some blow pops cuz this old fuck don't get it.
Be careful who you kiss at these , er, raves.  There is rampant canker
sores and herpes everywhere.

PLUR...I saw this dreck in XLR8R and almost wanted to puke.  Why?  It just
sounds stupid.  Say it, listen how sticky it sounds as your tongue stays at
the roof of your mouth and you look like a goldfish in really tepid water.
It has none of the power of some street terms, and has only 1/2 the effect.
Who made this shit up anyway...I wanna know so I can hunt the person down,
roll a fattie, stick it in his/her mouth, MAKE them smoke it, take thier
butts to a real party.  Then I would figure that instead of coming up with
that lame crap start a new slogan...how about DANCE.

Now do me a favor, go somewhere today, take all your PLUR buddies and have
a good time.  It looks like it's gonna be another nice day by the bay.

Peace,
John

lot that you can only see on 280 N near potrero facing the water, or how

What's your address, and what flavor blow pops do you like? And what

After this "I'm a raver not clubber thread"  I started to think of some of
the other dumb threads we've participated in.  The raver/clubber thread
will top the list for now but I remember:

-Battle of the BPM boneheads
-Why can't people dance freely thread (i.e. why do some people take up so
much space)
-PLUR
-Dancing styles (cricle dancing vs "real" dancing)
-gansgtah threads ad nauseum
-Promoters you love to hate, but won't tell 'em to thier face
-east coast vs west coast (yep, we did that too)
-and the ubiquitous "I love you all!" posts (It's like when someone says I
love all humanity...does that mean the mass murderers too?), smiles, and
hugz dreck.
-How come nobody hugz me at parties
-GHB is a good thing
-All drugs are good

Now don't get me wrong, even my pompous ass has participated in a few of
these (if not all ;)).

The next few years ought to prove interesting as I expect more and more
ridiculous posts.

Oh yeah, as I expected, the NRR posts are back in full force.  To coin a
phrase from the Right Reverend Martin O'Brian "The circle is now complete".
Back to deleting everything.  Oh how I wish for moderation, how I wish for
massive filtering, how I long for clear conversation, and how I hate that
slogannering PLUR.

PLUR sux.

HUGZ and sweet saccharin kisses and aspartame dreams, I wish glitter and
lollipops and teddy bears and good things to you all.  Personally I wish
someone would wish me Martha Stewart in full leather, can we make a slogan
out of that.  Good things for Bad People?

PLURBLES, HUGZ, FUZZY THINGS, BUBBLES and BLISSFULLBLISS...god I want to
throw up,
John

P.S.  Anything else you want to add to the list.  I would like to add this
post as one before someone else does so there. ;)

Yep. It rules.

> answer anywhere online. Which is scarey. Please have the answer I am
> looking for.

Check out the June Keyboard magazine for a review.

> Is the JP-8000 capable of pitch bending?

Yes. It has a pitch bend wheel that'll work in two dimensions. one controls
bend, the other direction controls LFO2 which can modulate the filter,
the amp, or the pitch with a triangle wave. I have a feeling this isn't what
you're asking for...

>  I mean does it hold the note for
> desired lengths?

Depends on the "desired length". I have a feeling you're talking about
portamento-- the jp-8K will glide between notes in an amount of time
you can "dial in", and the glide will take the same amount of time no
matter what the interval. It'll do this in "monophonic" mode (legato),
as well as "polyphonic" mode.

>  And layer with the following notes? Ect?

In polyphonic mode, yes. It has 8 voice polyphony.

>  It does this like
> the 303 right?

The 303 is monophonic. It's probably closer to hitting the
"monophonic"/legato button on the JP-8K... (note, this refers to the #
of simultanous notes, not non-binaural sound). There's a few "303"
presets on the JP8K which put you in monophic mode to emulate the the
TB-303.

>Totally step programble too...Right nStuff?

The JP8K has "realtime phrase sequence" (RPS) that lets you record
notes and assign a 4 measure pattern to  47 of the 48 keys on the the
keyboard. You can then hit one key and play back a sequence you
recorded, with options to switch patterns immediately, on the beat, or
on the measure when you switch keys.  you can also assign real-time
motions (e.g. a filter sweep) to two different buttons on the front-panel.

As far as I can tell, it just does real-time "loop" recording with the
ability to edit/erase mistakes, override sections, etc. No step
recording. I haven't played with this much, so there's probably more
here that I don't know about.

Note that the JP8K is meant mostly as a performance and MIDI synth so
it's not a workstation with a complete sequencer and step-record
capabilities, etc. If you want to step record, it has a complete midi
implementation so all you have to do is hook it to your sequencer. all
the knobs and sliders output  midi controller changes so if you're set
to record these on your sequencer, you end up recording all your knob
tweaks along with your midi notes.

I think the problem was that people I'd asked about their music style had
given me the impression it was jungleist or dub or of that genre.  My
expectations were set wrong... Other factors: the SFRaves group doesn't
seem to be the "hiphop type" _as much_ as other styles (although my
personal experiences with hiphop are that it's way cooler than the rap
that nija tunes served) and the background music from their message was an
often sampled bit I hear at jungle parties.  I think I just put things
together wrong, set an expectation, and when it was broken I was like
"this sucks" and left.  I suppose if I'd been keen on that type of
rappishhiphopflavour then I would have had a lot more fun -
thanks for the perspective,
Max

hehe. have you not had the jungle v. every other type of music out here
yet? gawd, that thread went on for*ever* in tx. (yawn)

food for thought: the thing i love the most about living in a (_supposed_)
democratic state is that one is supposed to be able to follow what ever
they believe in, _as well as_ (and this is key) respecting other ppls'
choices. you know, if i choose to do one thing, respect my choice to do so!
it's my life, not yours to judge. and i'll do the same for you. isn't that
what this so-called 'plur' is all about?

cheers - e. :)

What up my Peoples,
	Sorry if this has already been settled and if there is already one, but 
I was just wondering/suggesting about a meeting spot at Wonderland.  
There will be so many of us there tonight and a lot of people don't have 
Laminates.  It would be a shame to be around a lot of SFRavers and not 
meet them.  We are probably gonna end up walking right past someone from 
the list and not even talk to them.  Our Fault?  No...or maybe..yes?  We 
should think of a meeting spot...let's say 2AM???  How does this sound?  
I'll be checking mail all day today so let me/us know...

It's been really cool seeing some of you guys in my chatrooms.  I'm going
all-out learning Java programming and the chatroom applets were just the
first step (served from elsewhere).  So, I hope these kinds of things are
worth learning how to do..all the work pays off if my friends and family are
happy.  I built this big ol site and all my mom wants to know is where the
picture of "Phife", my roomates cat, is!!!! AAAAHHH!  I need a party!!!!

madluv,

steph

This is not a flame, so I'm posting to the entire list because people need to
see this...

In a message dated 6/21/97 12:58:17 PM, you wrote:

<<gee i didn't intend my post to start a flaming club vs. rave thread.
i was just bored at work and was thinking about how much i preferred
raves over clubs.<<

Fine, then you should have taken a little more time to think about what you
were going to write, before you went ahead and made sweeping generalizations
about people who go to clubs.  If you're going to post something on a public
list, use your head before you hit "send." If not, then people are going to
take you to task on it. 

>>if you want to flame, flame me for bringing out my point of view. for
telling you how *i* feel about the situations, music people at
clubs/raves. for sharing my experiences with the scene.<<

You have every right on this green earth to say whatever you want to say,
just as I have every right to criticize it if I have a problem with it. Are
you really complaning because people find fault with your post? Is everyone
supposed to think alike? 

>>i know i was condescending towards the club scene but i in no way was
trying to be superior. i made some of my points a bit grandious but it
was all in good humor. (or was the post not clear enough?)<<

Maybe including that last paragraph in your original post would have helped
avoid any negative response you may be recieving now. See, now that you've
had time to THINK about what you wrote, you're now acknowledging that you
could have presented your ideas in a different way. In any event, as far as
I'm concerned, it was people's subsequent posts that troubled me more than
yours. 

>>sorry if i'm not as opened minded as you.<<
In all honesty, you should be sorry. If we as a movement arent as accepting
as we claim to be, and in turn have a negative bias against people for
reasons so friggin' trivial as where they go to listen to music, we're
doomed. Maybe this is your wake up call.


>>is it me? i didn't read any flames. i didn't read any "you suck you stupid
#$%*, clubs are way better than raves." i just read a bunch of messages from
people who
shared their views on the topic. it's almost as ludicrous as expecting
everyone to keep their mouths shut about party reviews because they
might offend someone by saying "the dj spun shiity music, the people
were tweekers yadda yadda." eesh! sorry for not conforming to
everyone's ideals. my ideas and how i feel are from my past
experiences.<<

Constructive criticism(which sorely lacks in this scene) and what I
characterize as useless discussion are two different things. There is no
difference between people who go to warehouse parties and people who go to
clubs. Period. Name ONE DJ in the scene who has refused to play in club. Name
ONE of the major crews in this scene who would refuse to throw a jam in a
club if given the opportunity. F-8?  They do a club. Gateway does sound in a
club every Monday night. My man Macadio just spun in a club. Pacific doesnt
have a club, but I know they'd love to start one. FTT is all about clubs now.
And of course we all know that Wicked does a club every Wednesday night.
Anyone else?

Hey,

I had a blast at the Ninja show last night!

I have a strong connection to their music, through the rave scene.  For
some reason, memories of chill rooms at raves,  special thoughts of old
loves, and scenes from Burning Man kept sweeping through me.  It was
really great.

If it weren't for these things, I probably would have been disappointed
with it like some of you were.  (Were they really "live" all night?)

A note on the club vs. party debate.  The vibe is where you make it.

Peace,

Diana

Hello, all.  This is John S. Lee's girlfriend, writing this note in support
and defense of my man. Not that he needs my defense to handle all of you
glitter-huggers, but I thought you might like a testimony about him from
someone other than himself.  Some of you have a difficult time
understanding John or believing he has anything positive to say.  I'd like
to correct each and everyone of you that this applies to, as well as
express some of my own views on this subject.

I've know John for almost 3 years and never have I know a more giving,
loving, supportive individual.  You all must be thinking, "God, what a
deprived life she must have."  Quite the contrary.  I come from a loving
home, in which my parents are not only still married (30 years!) but still
deeply love each other.  I have many close, long-time friends.  I have been
far from love starved.  And I was doing the "PLUR" thing before it was
called that.  Back then, we called it love and friendship.  Hugs for
everyone!  Our love can change the world!  How many changes did we make?
How many of those rave "friends" was I able to count on in times of need?
ZERO!  Surprised?  I was at one time but the less naive I become, the less
surprised I am by anything.  Love can conquer all but there has got to be
great commitment to that love.  Spreading my love thinly through a crowd of
people I barely know proved to be nothing but draining.  And when it came
time to give to the people in my life who really care for me, I came up
short.  John has played an integral part in helping me understand that
concentrated love is much more powerful than the "free love for everyone"
approach.  He loves me deeply and we exchange many hugs and "smoochies???"
a day.  One true, real hug from a loved one provides me with more energy
and positivity than a thousand hugs at a rave ever has or will.

PLUR is not the root of all evil but I think too much reliance on it and
not enough focus on personal and societal improvements can be detrimental
to us all.  Its easy to give a perfect stranger a hug.  Its not easy to
deal with friends on bad trips, friends with drug addictions or "ravers"
who choose to deface the party facility with their self-important tagging.
These are very real problems within the rave community.  I read many of the
posts on this list and not enough of them address these issues.  PLUR is
nothing without commitment to organization and change within the group.
This list is a power source which I see as being greatly underutilized.
And what's with all the judgement I hear from the PLUR team, criticizing
clubbers with attitude just because they don't have a welcoming committee
at the door?  I prefer clubs to raves because I don't have to deal with all
the bullshit of being expected to love people I don't even know.  I respect
everyone, I save my love for people who appreciate it.

I don't buy the PLUR claim of acceptance of everyone, either.  How would I
be received if I showed up at a rave in a business suit?  Would I be
welcomed into the ever-accepting community?  Maybe eventually, but not
without a few stares & laughs first.  And would I first have prove I was
"one of you" by giving everyone a hug?  This is ridiculous.  Are people
required to be comfortable with touching the community at large in order to
be accepted?  What if I am really shy?  What if I am uncomfortable talking
to people I don't know?  What if I like myself this way and just want to
catch a groove?  Or, God forbid, I want to stand quietly on the sides and
observe?  According to PLUR, I would be bringing the party vibe down by
just being myself.  Not everyone at a rave fits into the PLUR model and
IMO, this is what I remember creating the beautiful experience.  Everyone
is different.  Embrace those differences.  We should be able to party
together as ourselves, not try to work everyone into a model we've chosen
for them.

This silly comparison of raves and clubs is taxing.  The way I see it, the
major difference between the two, is ravers are less honest about their
judgements.  Most everyone is judgmental in one way or another.  It's human
nature.  Clubbers might just be a little more honest about it.  They are
not trying to be rude, they are just being themselves.  If their attitude
does not fit the PLUR mold, then don't go to clubs.  If you are a PLUR
believer, check yourself on your criticisms of others.  Are they really bad
people or are they just different than you?  How perfect are you that you
have the right to label people as bad just because they don't act as you
wish they would?

Back in my raving days, a friend used to ask everyone she met, "Why are you
a raver?  What in your life has led you to the rave?"  Most every one's
response had something to do with negative experiences they have had in
their lives.  Unacceptance.  Disapproval.  Abandonment.  Pain.  Whether you
call it a rave or a club or a party or UG, it is the place everyone goes to
get away from reality.  It creates a pleasant environment for everyone to
forget about all the not-so-nice things that may be going on in their
lives.  We're all just trying to escape ourselves for a little while.

PLUR would make more sense to me if it were just, PLU.  Peace, love & unity
are global issues.  PLU would be much more inviting to and accepting of the
community a large, which is, by the way, where true change is possible and
happening.  Does President Clinton subscribe to this list?  Does he or any
other political leader know of PLUR?  And would they care?  Change isn't
seeded at the rave, people.  It is in individual lives.  It is within
communities which focus on helping others, not circle-dancing, blow pops
(which we all know are usually eaten to occupy a grinding jaw, not to take
us back to the innocence of childhood) or PLUR.  But if you only want
ravers in your little make-believe utopia, then what is all this yapping
about anyway?  Just keep on with the rave.

So, I encourage everyone, ravers & clubbers, to ask themselves, "Why am I a
raver/clubber?"  Ask your friends, then discuss your answers.  As far as I
am concerned, keep on PLURing, as long as everyone understands that rave
ideology is not going to change the world unless you get yourselves out of
the dark, smokey, warehouse and begin to act within the larger community.
I sympathize with your frustration within the rave scene but see that many
resources for change are not being implemented.  And if you do petition and
work for communal change, keep in mind individuals' differences.  Don't try
to turn everyone into a raver.  Do you really want the whole world at your
rave? I don't think you do.  Could we really deal with a whole world full
of baggy pants, whistles, blow pops & elmos?  This is PLUR by your
standards, right?  Everyone having fun in the way the ravers prescribe.  Be
sure to include a warning for all new PLUR recruits: "Party as we tell you
to or you'll have to leave.  We don't want anyone destroying our vibe."

Good luck to all, and could we please, please not forget the listen to the
music and dance our asses off?  That's what its really all about anyway,
regardless of  your answer to the question of why you, personally, are
there, right?  At least that's what I always thought.

Peace, Love and Unity (not necessarily at the rave),
Megan Haggerty
(John S. Lee's girlfriend)

I don't know what plur is about so I can't answer that question.  Plur does
remind me of the ill-fated Gleemonex in Brain Candy, but I digrees.  Plur
to me is veiled fascism with a happy face.  One reason why I will continue
to plur bash at every opportune time.

And no, I do not need to be tolerant of everything, just those things that
don't infringe upon my right to be me.  Plur sux.

Peace,
John

Hey everybody.

Well, I definitely agree that there weren't a lot of ravers representing, 
but around 1:30 the music changed to excellent, crazy drum 'n' bass with 
accompanying turn-table artistry. I guess you must have left a bit too 
early, which is too bad because from about 1:30 to 3:30 the music was 
incredible.

i enjoyed about half of the stealth tour last night. it wasn't bad at all. they
 spun some good stuff. after 330 it turned kinda bad for me; my body as not
responding to the vibe. besides my friend left me at 2 and i was there in the
front dancing. i spot several ravers, but i think there were ravers in disguise
and ravers in heart. i mean, no one would think i was a raver, but i rave. and
label doesn't matter. i was the young (*my* id worked. *shh*) chinese boi in
black frame glasses, and a green virtual chicken pet hanging around my neck. i
understand that there were quite a few of asian guys with black frame glasses
though. so.  anyway, i just love it when they spun squarepusher's vic acid, or
rustic raver, actually maybe! i keep hoping they would put the torque 12" on
the turntable, but they opt for panacea instead, and it was OKAY with me! i am
going to wonderland tonight! (first rave in calif!) and might be bringing a
friend who's never been to a rave, so i hope ppl will be gentle to us.  i might
be alone, but let's just hope i will be safe. when does the ticket place close
today anyway? and when does wonderland start? end? tak much! i need to soothe
and shower with pizzicato five now....weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee................

okay, i went, even though i was more than exhausted from my 2 days in 
san diego registerng for classes (at least they're good!) and 4 hours 
of sleep in between 2 days of running around and flying to and from 
sd... but my friends paged me at around 8:45, told me they could get me 
in free, so we went.. i was a little more than dissapointed to hear 
that it was at minna, just from past experiences with being stuck in a 
sweatfest... we got in at like 11:30-12:00, or something like that, and 
the heat already washed over me... i had no idea who we were grooving 
to.... anyways, dan came on... i've definitely seen him spin better, 
but it was hot, he looked exhausted... on the car ride back, we decided 
he'd just responded to the vibe of the party, which wasn't real high 
last night... simon was tearing it up downstairs... and then dj paucus 
(sorry if i messed up the spelling, he's really good friends with one 
of my friends, so i feel bad if that's misspelled!) was incredibly 
dope.. i was definitely impressed... then we went upstairs to watch 
hipp-e fucking things up... he's just such a solid dj.. every time i 
see him, the more i like him.. we left at about 5:45-6:00.. beautiful 
day in the city! everyone who may be partying tonight, stay safe and be 
happy! =)


                               much love,

not at all. i've been burned by more 'pluralists' than i care to
acknowledge. that's the thing.... eventually the drugs catch up and ppl
stop caring about anything else. it's all a facade. okay, not all of it,
that may be an exageration. but i can totally relate to what you're writing
here. maybe i'm old and jaded.... :P

we actually have this big music fest in austin (sxsw) and at the last one
they actually had josh wink spinning at one of the bars (austin is
primarily a live-music town)... i thought it was *great* to see ppl there
who you'd never find at a rave - men and women in suits, or just jeans and
t-shirts - all really enjoying the music and getting into it. even ppl my
parents' age (i'm 30...). it was fabulous!

And would I first have prove I was
>"one of you" by giving everyone a hug?

good lord, i hope not. i *am* shy, don't tend to talk freely with
strangers, but that in no way doesn't mean i don't respect them as humans
and welcome them into what ever place i'm in.

> Everyone

bravo. anyway, imo, all of this bullshit is propagated either by high
school students who think they know it all (as i did when i was that age -
don't mean to sound snotty here), or by those who never grew out of that
mentality. one can only hope that they will. you know, i used to be a
clubkid (tho it wasn't called that then) and i dressed to the tee in my
little tight dresses and went out with this attitude that i was the shit.
it was *my* club, and how dare you think that you can belong here. well,
i've outgrown that and come to love (i use that term loosely) all sorts of
ppl for the characters that they are. fuck it anyway, who gives a shit. and
if some kid with a lolly pop wants to judge me now 'coz i'm not 'kewl'
enough for them, who gives a damn? i go out, to clubs, to raves, to hear
the music, to get taken on a trip, and to dance my _ass_ off. to have fun.
that's all. not to see or be seen. not to judge. people who find it amusing
to judge and laugh at others, and this is only my philosophy, usually have
some need to elevate themselves. what they don't realize is that it
usual;ly causes a backlash. i mean, would you trust someone who gets a kick
out of putting down ppl? i wouldn't. anyway, if there's someway to benefit
others through raving (say, by the proceeds of a party going to a worthy
cause), then i'm all for it. more parties should be held in this manner.
other than that, i don't see where raving can save the world. i've seen it
mess up too many ppls lives. too many ppl.

you know, one of the things that drew me the most to this community was
that there are so many _different_ kinds of ppl, brought together by their
love of a certain kind of music. let's try not to let that change. again,
just be yourself. if someone doesn't like you for who you are, ask yourself
why you need such a persons' approval. do you?

i always thought that plur was 'peace, love, unity, and _respect_'. i don't
think you can have the plu without first having the respect. for ppl and
their individual choices. as long as they're not interfering with your
life, what difference does it make?

me too! "my" club in rochester (where i grew up) had this neon sign on the
dance floor that screamed 'dance your ass off'! and that _is_ what it's all
about. dance your ass off, have a blast! it's a hedonistic movement before
anything else. props to those who try to do some communal good with the
proceeds.

peace, e. :)

Happenstance.  Parents fucking.  Lucky health.  Countless un/conscious
decisions, paths followed, trails blazed.

I have reached a point:  I am my own man.  I am not a raver or a clubber
or a honkey, or an MC, poet, student, asshole, lover, fighter, none of
this.  I will have none of it.

And who are we to classify others, much less waste the force to CATEGORIZE
OURSELVES?  I said this in my last oration: there is simply no need for
any of you, or any of me to squeeze ourselves into tangible objects, that
a personality librarian could figure out where to stack.

This string, although John Lee is really funny, is bollocks.  GET GRIPS,
yall.  There is no such thing as this or that.  Positive or negative.  I
have quite honestly been amazed to find this obsession with typology, with
identification within a particular grouping, with this bullshit sense of
'I am funkier than thou.'  Not that I don't enjoy it.

Did any of you ever go to a Dead show?  I noticed a similar weirdness.  WE
ARE SO PEACEFUL, DIG US.  No, not them, just us.  they come here and do
x/y/z and fuck everything up.  Bollocks.

I suppose if I could give any advice to you all: read Confucius.  I am
being very, very serious.  While your at it, read Ayn Rand.  Confucius is
the kingpin of interpersonal life as far as I'm concerned.  Ayn Rand had
some good ideas...

My friends, life is short, afterlife uncertain.
For this simple reason, take no shorts in making YOURSELF happy.  There is
a huge amount to be said for self-centeredness.  I am not saying that
losing yourself to loving a man/woman is wrong.  I am not saying that
hugging people at random is wrong.  But above all, and I'll end with this:

415-370-8399,
um, dial 370 instead of 310 as it says to in the message. They still
don't have the map poit posted.

Hello

What were the guys onstage doing?  Was it live instrumentation,
pre-sequenced and DATs, or straight turntable skills?

If people were just standing around, I hope that what was going visually
on-stage was dope enough to captivate everyone.

P,

I think they used a combination of all of those. (see below)

I stood around for part of the time because they weren't playing
danceable music.  I left at 4 am.

I liked it.

Got there about 11:00 - 11:30ish.
 It reminded me of a PLURy Oak50 ravE from last year. Not many people there
yet but. Everyone had there possitive helmets on. I guess around 2AM, the
place was packed!
 It was pretty much a Break-Beat show down. Lots of my favorite Break-Beats
though. And fortunetly, played alittle faster than normal. Later on,
nothing but phat, dope-azz house tunes. Including one I never heard at the
ravEs before, just got the album last week. It goes alittle something -lie
-lie -like this: "SO LET IT BE WRITTEN. SO LET IT BE HOUSE" Great sample!
 Ofcourse, I already have like five of the BEST samples you will hear in
the up -n- coming years...All in my head here. Oh, and on some VCR tapes &
WAV formats. But....Can't be telling you all. Most of you probably have a
sampler already, I don't. So....You will have to wait tell I use them 1st! 
=]:..

 Oh, where was I? The place was really clean. Nice carpet-ting on the
ground level room. And a nice clean pavement down in the bassment. Warm
water =[.. Lots of candy to purchase. Clean bathrooms.
 LOW VOLUME!?!? =[

 Had to watch my back a few times for the occasional violation. I really do
need a rear-view mirror on my forehead when I am dancing.  My door don't
swing both ways. Hi Deepfog! Oh.
 Some people seemed to have thought, that five hours of my dance was
alittle to much. But I still felt good dancing so. Don't matter what they
think huh? Just because you like to watch me dance, don't mean that I am
dancing for your sake. I will stop when I wanna.
 Can you believe it...I heard someone say "Ok, that dance is getting
alittle boring now" Well. He must have been watching me dance along time to
grow such a tolorance to it.   =] I laughed at the comment ofcourse. I find
the original ones to be funny. It's thoughs played out remarks I get tired
of hearing.
 Lets face it though. The music just gets boring after awhile. My dance is
simply a reflection of that.
 Just playing.

 Man. Some DJ was playing really sloppy though. I didn't see his face but..
Pulling the needle off the record, and starting a new song? What.. Did he -
NOT want the song to fade out? So he pulled the needle off first, before
the record ended? He made everyone fear, the party was over.
 I saw the name DAN on the flyer. Is DAN the same as DJ Dan? Hmmm. I didn't
see DJ Dan though. I wasn't up at the booth train spotting I guess.

My question of the day:
Why should I have to proove myself?

Anyways. I had alot of fun. And had a great work out. Although I don't
believe my body is thanking me for it.
Oh and. Alot of my inhabilities, are becoming abilities agian.

Did that make sence? Hmm.
Great Mini-massive. Good vibe. Excellent music, tell the wee hours of the
morning, when they started sounding like "Go away songs".

Jeff
I get really disappointed in my self sometimes. But I am working on it.

i would have to disagree about raver friends..
i'm not sure what kind of crowd you are talking about, but my friends in 
the scene have done more for me than anyone in my life.
amanda, is on her way from SF right now (11 fucking pm) to pick me up to 
go to WONDERLAND because my car died and i'm having alot of personal 
problems and she wants to see me.. i met her through raving and she has 
been there for me more than ANYONE. 
when i'm sad she'd do ANYTHING to make me smile, and i am the same. drugs 
don't even get into our friendship because we don't let drugs control 
ANYTHING of what we do. but then that's just us.

we area  group of friends, about 20 people strong (more or less) that are 
there for each other regardless of time/place/money/anything, and we call 
ourselves EBF -- east bay family. some of us (me) are in south bay, some 
aren't even IN the bay but we take care of each other and we don't 
abandon each other in times of need -- in fact, just when you think no 
one's there for you -- EBF makes you realize you are loved.
that's what our family is about, we all met each other through raving, we 
are friends that stick together, and everyone has proved this to be true 
to me since the day we all met. not ONCE have i been burned by my "rave 
friends". in fact sometimes i think they're the only ones that have never 
let me down in my life.

so..
i guess i disagree strongly with what you said about raver friends 
abandoning you when you're in need.
coz i've gotten more love and support from friends like amanda than i've 
ever even expected from ANYONE in my life.
much love,
lara

and you KNOW that i will NOT let you down.

Let me explain alittle bit further.

What I meant to ask was. I guess...

Can it pitch bend like the 303 where.. Well. I suck at talking. Anyways, I
will explain it like this.
=]:...

 With the 303. When you select a note to be played on a step. You have the
option to "slide" that note to (or through) the next step. So if you make
the following note higher or lower, it will slide to your next note
sounding like a pitch bender. You can also select "slide" on a [step]
before a [step with a note]. Making it slide into the [step with the note],
giving it a reverse sound affect.
 Plus adding alittle "Accent" here and there makes for some acid-E sounding
rythms too. You know?
 That pitch wheel is all fine and dandy but. It takes alittle programming I
think, to get the exact result I am looking for. The wheel is like bending
a guitar string. It is a "live" action. I want to slide the notes up and
down in a sequenced pattern / monotonious fassion if you will.
 I amagine you can use the pitch wheel to slide the notes while recording.
But it seems impractical & time consuming to have to figure out how far you
need to move the wheel, to get the desired "flawless / industrial" pitch
bends. Where as, with the 303 you just program how far you want the pitch
to go, by selecting the desired [following notes], after the [starting
"slide" note]. And you can even make a long "precise" wavy pitch bend by
adding the "slide" option to more steps in the chain. Compound that with
alittle accent on desired notes...
 Lets just say. I can honestly get, one tb-303 to actually sound like 3
seperate rythms within a 16step pattern with these abilities. Bassline,
rythm, and lead all in one!

 Plus. With that pitch wheel. Lets say you slide it up. Unfortunetly with a
pitch wheel..What goes up, must come down. Or vice-aversa. But with the 303
you can slide it up, back down a bit, then up really high, keep it there
for awhile, drop it to a D flat, and back up to an A sharp with alittle
Accent in the middle of the bend, and so on.  Without having to figure out
how far to move some wheel to get the right note every time. Oh.

Is the JP-8000 limited in this way? 
Perhaps the LFO2 option is what I am looking for?
I am making little sence, I know. Like usual nStuff.

else~s sake they let the event continue...hope, hope.

minibandshell co~sponsored by SFAC _Making Waves_ near Pier 26 was

Ok, I just opened my mail and got a brand new shiny letter from UC Berkeley
saying that they are kicking me out for bad grades. I have no clue about
the rest of my life now. If I tell my dad he will kill me (literally) and
besides I just crashed his car last weekend.
And on top of all that I got my wisdom teeth pulled and my jaw feels full
of lead and acid (HCL) and looks like a football and I'm stuck at home when
my friends are at wonderland. And all this bad shit is happening to me so I
could use a friendly hug or even a friendly voice. And I know it's rude
asking for PLUR (those things should be offered) but I'm really down and
low right now. If anyone want's to kick it sunday or next week just page me
at 510-319-0374
Wow life is like a sine curve, and I think I'm at the bottom right now.

nothing but LOVE
especially for you Sandy forever

Man oh man...  talk about bad timing...
I saw the cops pulling up to the front of the dance studio, so I tried to
walk faster to try and get in before the cop got out of his car (didn't
want to make it look too obvious why I was there...).   He got out of the
car and was about the same distance from the door as I was, so I knew it
was going to be close; and just as I was about to walk through the door,
Mr. Pig decided that he should go first... 

Damn!  I almost got in!  If I hadn't taken so long looking for a parking
spot...

So what did I miss?  I waited out front with about 50 other people in
hopes that the coppers would be cool and let it happen, but then I guess
it was a no-go.
So I've headed home, and I'm wondering-- did the make-up party at the
beach ever happen?  Or did you guys wait a while to let the heat die down
and then let people in?
It's like 3:25 right now, and I've tried calling the info numbers, but
the 415 number has some personal message on it, and the 408 number still
has the directions on it...  

Hmmm...  $20 for Origin... awww, forget it.
I guess I'm staying home.
Can anyone who was inside tell me how it was?  I was so eager to meet so
many of you-- maybe next week, eh?
See ya'all at Area 51...

Mad hugs,
Jay

Oh, we (me and my crew) were sooooooo juiced about Wonderland . . .

Then:
1.  7:30 p.m. we left Sacramento over 1 hour late cuz a friend was running 
very late
2.  9:30 p.m. we got lost (ended up in Oakland)
3.  10:00 p.m. we got lost again (this time in SF, had to ask for directions 
to map point)
4.  10:20 p.m. Faster Bamboo, where I was told I could pick up my reserved 
presales and directions to the party, was CLOSED!!!
5.  10:30 p.m. The voice mail, which was supposed to be updated at 9pm, wasn't 
updated!
6.  11:30 p.m. We looked for another party (supposedly taking place on 540 
Howard), no sign of a party there.
7.  11:45 p.m.Updated Wonderland voice mail gave directions to a new map 
point, but we were already lost and decided to go to a party in Oakland
8.  11:55 p.m. We were split up into 2 cars . . . we lost the other car 
(directions inside)
9.  12:30 a.m.  No money, no phone cards, couldn't call the other car, 
couldn't check voice mail . . . we were stuck in downtown Oakland again
10.  1:00 a. m. Remainder of us went home (Sacramento) and tried to go to a 
party in Sacramento
11. 3:30 a. m. Sac party was in the boonies . . . ran out of gas (thankfully 
near a gas station)
12.  5 a.m.--Forget it!  We just went home so we could get some sleep and go 
to High Noon tomorrow.

Moral of the Story:  Something about leaving early, which we should know by 
now

DRAMA!!!

But the good thing is I gotta whole lotta Pixie Stix and Tootsie Pops leftover 
(since I never got to a party) to hand out at _Alternate_ (Sac rave, w/ jungle 
and house . . . what more could you ask for).

Hope you all had fun . . . all in all, I did (what an adventure) . . . how was 
the party?  I know it had to be good . . . :'-(

        Well, it started off great. Good music, and a good vibe building.
Well, unfortunately when we came to the door, we were late enough to have
missed the map point, but as we began to ask if we could buy tickets there,
they suddenly let us in for free. We went upstairs and saw some decent
music, and a good vibe thick in the air for about 3 minutes when the lights
came on and the music stopped. We were herded into the back rooms and told
to be quiet(I guess to calm the cops). Then they handed out candy. I was
trying to figure out the logic, giving sugar to people told to be quiet. Oh
well. They then told us about 20 minutes later(a whole lot of sitting, but
meeting new people all the same)that the party would start again shortly. 5
Minutes after that, nope, but there would be an alternate party at a certain
location which they gave us. We went there to find a dead end. We hung
around for 2 hours as others showed up, quite a bit really, dancing around a
car stereo. It's interesting to see about 40 people grooving at a dead end
in freezing cold SF winds which were sweeping off the bay to a quiet car
stereo. But they danced on the nearby flatbed trailers and it was all silly.
Me and my friends played tag and goofed off. We then decided to leave, but
in good time as we saw the cops roll past us to this other gathering.

        While we sat around the room and were told to be quiet, I got the
image of Jews in Nazi Germany. It was that crazy. They then said, "You can
go into the other room, but have to sit down because the cops might see your
shadows. Whoa, they sure are buckling down on those 'tenderloin' district
raves. I mean c'mon, don't they have better things to do? While we walked
back to the car(thanks again Rebel)we were offered weed twice and heroin
once. Now that seems like much more to worry about to me. Sheesh.

I HATE PO-POS!

I just read that Wonderland got broken up . . . that sux so bad.  I mean, I 
didn't get to go anyway, but I was hoping you all still got to have fun. . . I 
know Wonder was really working their asses off to put on a good party.

Love to Wonder . . . I'm sooo sooo sorry!

Well, maybe it's good I didn't get a chance to buy those presales after all . 
. . This would have been the second time I've been to a bombass party and the 
po-pos regulated . . . and I've only been to five!

Hope you all had fun anyway . . . hell, if I could enjoy the shit I went 
through tonight, I know you all could to!

xoxo--Miccaela

BEWARE...  It is very easy to fool yourself that you have control over
drugs.  I hope that some day you do not find that control slip out from
under you before you know it.  It has happened to some of my least
suspecting acquaintances.  Control with drugs is a facade.  People take
drugs to lose control.  That's the trill.  And if any of you should ever
fall at the mercy of those drugs, I do hope that you'll be there for each
other.  I cannot say that this has been my experience, nor the experience
of anyone I know.  Have you ever dealt with a drug addicted individual?  A
person you thought you knew can become a complete stranger and very
difficult to deal with.  Good luck to anyone who is even remotely involved
with drugs.  Don't overestimate yourself; don't underestimate drugs.

Well, I hope that this remains true after the party is over.  I, too, had a
close knit group of rave friends.  The group fell apart for me when I
stopped raving so much and found that without that central focus of the
party, I had less in common with them than I thought.  If you feel your
group is different, then more power to you.  I have had several private
responses from people who strongly agreed with me & found it comforting to
know that they are not alone in their sad realization of who they can and
cannot count on.  I would never wish abandonment on anyone, but I would
have liked to have been more aware of the possibility of it.  I am not
telling anyone that all your friends are going to leave you.  Just be
prepared for it.  Examine your friendships.  If you find little to talk
about other than the rave, get ready for possible disappointment.  This is
not to say that you or your friends are bad people if this happens.  It is
a fact of every one's life, whether they are raving or not.
Disappointments occur.  I, simply, am a person who likes to hope for the
best and prepare for the worst.  My story is being told in hopes of
providing just a bit of insight to possible outcomes.

>abandoning you when you're in need.

How can you disagree with my experiences?  They are very personal to me and
I am quite sure that they happened.  If you have had different experiences,
then state them as your own.  Please do not try to override my statements
with yours.  I have not spoken as the representative of a larger group.  I
only stated what I know I have experienced.  I suggest you do the same.
You have projected a certainty about the future of your friendships and
this is dangerous.  Not that they will necessarily turn out as mine did,
but I do not advise banking on the future.  It can turn on you when you
least expect it.

>coz i've gotten more love and support from friends like amanda than i've

>much love,

>
Love and support from friends should be expected.  I hope your friends have
raised your expectations of people and you should keep those expectations
high, even with people outside of the rave community.  I think that is a
major problem in our society; we do not hold one another to very high
standards.  If change & evolution is in order, we must take greater
responsibility for ourselves and our community.  We cannot control other's
actions, but we can speak out on them.  If you have been hurt, do not allow
the person who hurt you to get away without expressing yourself about it.
This is something I actively work on in myself and have found that open
communication is the key to personal, relational & societal advancement.
But everyone must have their say.  Please don't exclude non-ravers from
this, because you might just be surprised who ends up really being there
for you.

>and you KNOW that i will NOT let you down.

And how do I KNOW that?

Wonderland!!!!! Well, what is there to say? It got busted. That sucks and
all, but I still have to say that I had a good time in the time that it was
running. I mean you have to give it that much credit, but thanks to the
wonderful help (NOT!!!!) of the everlasting SFPD good times tended to come to
a hault. You would think they would be out arresting burglers, killers,
muggers, but no. They'd rather waste their time keeping a few people from
having a little fun!! I guess there's no end to it. =c(

One more thing!!!!!

Hey love,
     Just wanted to say that it was GREAT seeing you last night and I hope
you got your ride and all and that you had a great time. As for LadyBug,
Jefe, and I we just went to the other meeting point for a little while and
then went home. Big fun, ehe? Oh well!!!!! Give me a call sweety!!! WE LOVE
YOU!!!!!!

I just have to go here.

 So maybe burglers, killers, and smugglers are just out having a good time
too?
 If the promoters don't want to pay for the proper permits. Then..Shit
happens right?


Cops are out to up-hold the law. It's not there fault if the promoters
don't follow big brothers rules.






Just felt like being anal.

> Is the JP-8000 limited in this way?

	It sounds like what you're looking for would be the monophonic
legato mode on the JP-8000. Make your sound monophonic with the "mono"
button, then turn on legato mode with the shift key & the "mono" button
simultaneously. Turn on portamento & set your glide rate with the portamento
wheel.

 	Now play a note, then play a second note without letting go
of the first note until the second one is down. The sound will slide
up to the pitch of the second note without retriggering any envelopes,
sounds like a pitch bend.

what anal? don't be ridiculous. if you're going to throw a party, do it
through the proper channels to ensure good times. i'm not being anal
(although i tend usually to be), just straight. and in a bit of a foul
mood. ah well, such is life. i've got to go out and get some of this ca
sunshine!!!

cheers, e. :)

I'm a total newbie to the actual composition of music using keyboards and such, and am somewhat unsure of exactly which tools I need to do every step up to recording.
I know I need a workstation and a sequencer, but what else?
Oh yeah, any tips on what to buy? (keep in mind I just want stuff to learn on and dont have lots of money) Right now I'm thinking of a Roland XP-80 and I *think* a VS-880 V2 digital studio workstation but I dunno if thats the right stuff or if I need it or not or what. :P

Hugs,
--Diego

Probably bits of the "Amen" drum loop, which is sped up so much it almost
doesn't sound like a snare anymore unless you're used to listening to
pitched samples.

Or something.

I am so so sorry for those who missed this party.  it was the absolute most
beautiful location with the most beautiful people. this is definitley an
experiance that i will never forget. all night long the music was awesome.
everyone played the right kind of music for the type of mood i was in.
unfortanatley I had a rough night at clays house the night before so I had
to sleep a little while. THe gardens and hot tubs and fish ponds with
pretty fish was the most peaceful enviroment. my friends had a pretty long
night but i just puffed herb with everyone and floated away. the drive
there was only an hour from my house so it was really easy for us. I love
you all and I missed everyone who couldnt be there.  hugsnkisses

oh no, not _the_ nico, but the other one.  in addition, there is a third
nico but that one does not tour with moby (for fear of being confused with
the fourth nico, who only produces dancehall and bossa nova tracks).

Damn... the party went off. Thanks to Nomad for doing such a good job. The
Oakland site is so much better with the additional outdoor chill space. And
.... it didn't seem as crowded this time at the site. Good ventilation and
incredible music. It seems the front room was the place to be... the music
was just intense... Amazing set by Tony who just got the place going and DJ
Dan just set it off!! It was a great night and a big hello to those of you I
met from here. It was great to see your smiling faces. 

peace and joy,
Carl

Hi everyone, here's my little review of the moST FabuLous TIME
I've ever had!!!! it was aMAazzzinggg!!,

ok, so Eric and I get there around 7pm to help setup, we do some 
stuff, blah blah blah..then someone comes up to me and tells me
that I have to pay $5 bucks or else I have to go to the map point
and get a ticket or something like that...am all "AS-IF!!", so I paid
(or rather someone paid for me, thanks Duston! ;) I owe you $$$)
and went on my merry way...  the decorations where BEAUTIFUL!!!
I specially loved the signs that had different directions on them,
pretty confusing, but cute :) everything was nicenicenice :) the
peps where all cute and beautiful and nice :)

THE MUSIC WAS RAD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
VLAD has a really really really nice Set! I really enjoyed dancing to
the stuff he was playing :) the highlight of my night was INDIGO! (Hi
Philip!) his set was soooo RAD that I fainted for a sec or two ;) 
thank you so much for having such a good set :) 

THen the music stopped, the lights went on, but I was still smilin'
and having a lot of fun! :) after a few hours we all left :( tried
to find out where I was goin' and who my ride was going to be!, we
all went to the supposedly meeting place called 3COM park in SF.
got there,it was Freezzzing, not many peps. I jumped on someone else's
car and went to 7-11 for a few mins to get something to eat, when I 
came back..all the cars where gone... I guess my RIDE decided to leave
without me. Thanks Guys! I really enjoyed being stranded in the city!
[*hugs*]...got back in the car went to the other location on 24th and
Illinoi, no music yet... no sign of my ride :( [*sigh*] Anyhow, to make
a story short...

* brought Peanut Butter and Jelly sandwiches for everyone!
* it was Freeezzzing!
* The Music was ROcking (LI's and MICRON'S SET WHERE DA BOMB!!!!!!)
* the music went out cause the thingy ran out of gas.. :o/
* we decide to make a bon fire.. :) (me, jer and betsy's idea!) ;)
* the thingy brakes after pputting gas in it. :(
* McGyver managed to fix it, the music was pumping again! :)
* the SFPD showed up :( a few hours after
* decided we should all go to TallPaul's house (all the peps that hadnt
left cause they were stranded basically)
* waited 3 hours for someone to come rescue us.
* on the way to Paul's we ran out of gas.

:O) and I've had a BLAST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I gotta give some props to the Ameba crew in all it's variations;

Shouts to Mark Ameba, Alan, and all past and future Amebites, including
Andrew & Mattie B. (the only two that come to mind, there are
others)(Anybody remember Acme Acres?).

This store was RAVE CENTRAL before all the me-too's moved into town (This
includes Behind the Post Office, Housewares, BulletProof, etc.)  Ameba at
one time was THE place to go and not only get good mix tapes (the only
other store was BPM at the time) and stay in touch with the scene (the only
place was Ameba, BPM was all about DJ's and DJ' culture...).  You could
find out about anything and everything going on in all of this.

They will be missed as Haight street goes through  what the rest of this
city is going through; a massive white out.   Gentrification at all costs.
As this city slowly loses it's color and it's flavor, Ameba is just another
sign of things to come, on all levels.  Rave hasn't changed, it's just been
replaced by rampant commercialism and dollars.

Enough of my soapbox.  See y'all later Ameba, you will be missed.  Haight
street has lost one of it's most orignal and most flavorful tennants.  This
city is slowly starting to suck.

Farewell and much luck to all the Amebites, great and small!

Much love,
John

P.S.  Watch as Hunter's point turns pale.  As the mission begins it's
massive transormation from the center of latin culture to yuppie south
where the only other language spoken is that of money; spanish will nary be
heard except for the multitude of bad tapas joints open up so that yuppies
and other bay area crawlers gobble for flavor; too bad, you chased it out
since it was all "undesireable".  As this wonderful multi-cultural city
begins it's transformation into one dull and boring place.  Where even my
gay brothers will be monotone.  I certainly expect over the next decade
that SF will elect it's first Republicans into the supervisors seats, and
as the Great Sellout Willie Brown sells this city to the highest bidder
(and yes, I voted for the asshole).  Hold on tight, this will be one long
slow ride into boredom.

ABC-YA!

Hey folx, just went to my first _High Noon_, a semi-regular Sacramento daytime 
outdoors party . . . it was bomb.  Anybody looking to kick back, dance, and 
listen to good music (DJ Flash, I think his name is, was pretty good today) on 
a Sunday afternoon should come out.  I saw a fellow sfraver out there (Hi 
Scott), and all the people were beautiful and friendly.  This time (there was 
a new location today) it was out by Mather, by this little lake/pond, in the 
middle of a field . . . lots of thorny stuff, but a really nice breeze coming 
off the lake.

It looks like the event is kinda small, cuz I think there was about 50 people 
there.  I don't know why that is, because it's FREE and they have FREE WATER 
AND PUNCH.  The next one is July 6th, the info # is 916.603.0772, so come out 
and support your local rave crew (SRC) and djs.

Just some tips if you go:  1.  Bring your own water and drinks, cuz there's a 
limited supply  2.  Bring stuff to keep you cool (visors, spray bottles, ice, 
shorts)  3.  Put on insect repellant  4.  Bring blankets and chairs to sit on. 
 5.  Go the bathroom before you come (there are _no_ bathrooms).  This is what 
me and my friends did and we had a blast (even the nonravers loved it).

Come on out!  I'm planning on attending the next one.  Oh, and see you at 
_Alternate_ here in Sac Saturday night (it's on the calendar if you want to 
check it out).

xoxo--Miccaela
battling for the most frequent poster award . . . but hey, I keep it pretty 
much rave related or list related, so I ain't planning on slowing up . . .

After this "I'm a raver not clubber thread"  I started to think of some of
the other dumb threads we've participated in.  The raver/clubber thread
will top the list for now but I remember:

-Battle of the BPM boneheads
-Why can't people dance freely thread (i.e. why do some people take up so
much space)
-PLUR
-Dancing styles (cricle dancing vs "real" dancing)
-gansgtah threads ad nauseum
-Promoters you love to hate, but won't tell 'em to thier face
-east coast vs west coast (yep, we did that too)
-and the ubiquitous "I love you all!" posts (It's like when someone says I
love all humanity...does that mean the mass murderers too?), smiles, and
hugz dreck.
-How come nobody hugz me at parties
-GHB is a good thing
-All drugs are good

Now don't get me wrong, even my pompous ass has participated in a few of
these (if not all ;)).

The next few years ought to prove interesting as I expect more and more
ridiculous posts.

Oh yeah, as I expected, the NRR posts are back in full force.  To coin a
phrase from the Right Reverend Martin O'Brian "The circle is now complete".
Back to deleting everything.  Oh how I wish for moderation, how I wish for
massive filtering, how I long for clear conversation, and how I hate that
slogannering PLUR.

PLUR sux.

HUGZ and sweet saccharin kisses and aspartame dreams, I wish glitter and
lollipops and teddy bears and good things to you all.  Personally I wish
someone would wish me Martha Stewart in full leather, can we make a slogan
out of that.  Good things for Bad People?

PLURBLES, HUGZ, FUZZY THINGS, BUBBLES and BLISSFULLBLISS...god I want to
throw up,
John

P.S.  Anything else you want to add to the list.  I would like to add this
post as one before someone else does so there. ;)

...And only one person drank my soy milk.  [sniff]

Don't you all know about that mad cow disease?

Well from my vantage point the WonderCrew did a wonderful job and then they
had the courage to move the party to the secret alternate spot.  That is
where Jeremy brought...doughnuts?!  Wow.

Never fear folx.  One day we will conquer the law enforcement threat to our
movement.  Just hang tight, and please try to avoid being one of those
people 5 years from now that just say "oh, i did that rave thing for a
while." i've been busy talking to a lot of people that are out partying
nowadays, and i am delighted to hear the aspirations for the future some of
the current rave crews have.  You know when I was sitting there observing
some of these police officers trying to gather information from each of us
at the dance studio that were out in the lobby, there was one taller police
officer that almost looked like...he didn't want to break up the party.
Had sort of a sadness in his eyes.

Oh, but that can't be true.

[blake]  remember how tony robbins always says that humans seek pleasure?
well, i observed the cops leaving the secret alternate spot, which was
outdoors on the bay side, and one of the cops did a donut.  with the car
that WE paid for.  so you see, the cops are really no different from us.
they seek pleasure.  they probably get a sense of accomplishment from
knowing that they cleared out a bunch of whacky looking kids with nose
rings and blue hair so that they can sit and write a report somewhere under
a freeway overpass.  but then we indulged in the pleasure of engulfing
Jeremy's donuts (did you make those yourself, Jeremy?) and giving each
other lots of hugz and other related stuff.

you see, i almost had as much fun just hanging out in the parking lot after
the party was over with (prematurely, i might add) as hanging out at the
party.

so, all i would have to say to tony robbins, is...yOU'RE rIGHT!

sorry if this offends anyone I am feeling a little testy today
I saw that moby was "playing" at the huge electronica tour.
I have seen him twice.   he is the worst.
i saw him in 1993 at this weird party that had orbital and aphex twin
I saw him at the warfield a couple years ago with sven vath and freaky
chakra
if you like his music that is one thing
but he just plays his dat tapes and dances around like a psycho
at the "climax" of his warfield show he stripped down
yelling at the top of his lungs and made the christ pose
it would be one thing if he made his tunes live
or it could be cool if maybe he played a slightly different variation
than the tracks on cd
but anyway it was always really disapointing
i was embarassed for him at the warfield
luckily for me both times i saw someone good during the same show
(flashback: Jeno played the song REZ that night in 93)
hope I haven't upset any big MOBY fans
peace

hi all.  We had two gas cans that we borrowed for the renegate 
wonderland afterparty, but both of them are missing!  I don't know who 
either of them belong to, but somebody walked off with one of them 
without permission, and I (duh) put one down next to my car and was so 
tired that I drove off without it.  I'm dumb, sue me.  

So here's the point:
can anyone who knows who these gas cans belong to or who knows who has 
them now please contact me so I can get them back to the rightful 
owners?  Thank you!

BTW, thank you so much to everyone who brought gas cans, pitched in for 
gas, transported equiptment, set up, and ***especially*** to Dan and the 
Magyver-esque guy who fixed the generator when it broke.  You guys are 
wonderful and we love you!

Off to sleep I go...

Mad Luvin,

Well.

I guess because.. I know right from wrong?
Or I just have alot of change? ie $0.2cents.


Jeff's Logic 101 nStuff. Maybe?
What about the "Booty grabbin gangsta's  /  just because I live in the
getto don't mean I am a gangsta  /  the getto is no way afilliated with
cheap housing  / stop the racial comments thread"

Naw. I know why! It's because I don't have my JP-8000, MPC2000, and
DJ-70mkII yet?

=]:. ..
Maybe because I never talk at the ravEs to people?
Bored?

Hey man...

First of all, being anal isn't to cool when you're cutting down the 
promoters who worked hella hard and put thier ass's on the line to put on 
all these cool parties for us...

Second of all...and I don't really know the answer to this question but 
maybe someone does...is there really any legal party permit for raves...I 
kinda doubt it...

I kinda have to agree with Star here...like I said when I left the party 
"isn't there like someone murdered in the US every ten seconds?..." I'm 
not blaming the SFPD...it's thier job...I just think the whole thing is 
kinda rediculas. Drugs and all aside...we're having a party...not 
bothering or hurting anoyone...just celebrating life I guess...I don't 
know...but should that be against the law...I don't think so.


Anyway...I'll stop now.

Stay cool everyone!

Matt

Wow!...once again another crazy evening in the SFraves scene. Well, I 
thought the wonder crew did a great job in setting up, the place looked 
wonderful, and the vibe was awsome as usual. AndyW was dropping some phat 
beats in the main room and then as we all know of course...the bomb 
dropped. Yet, the party must go on! So we waited out in the freezing 
cold and kept the vibe just as high as it was back in the dance studio. I 
must say It felt soooo awsome to be a part of that vibe, (even thought I 
had to sit in the car have the time to dethaw :P.) Anyway...studio or no 
studio...SFPD or no....well, I guess not...anyway I had an AWSOME time. 
Except for the fact that ONCE AGAIN, I didn't get to see macadio 
spin...this is starting to get on my nerves *8^)

Gotta give mad-phat-love to everyone there, and especially all the great 
new friends I made, you guys are SUPERAWSOME, and I can't wait to see you 
all at the next event!

To keep it short...

Staaaaayyy Cooool!

It's extremely unlikely that the bust was for "raving".  The constitution
has been limited in other ways - "peaceful assembly" has _numbers_
attached to it nowadays, and especially for commercial events, there are
county, city, and state laws regarding venue capacity, insurance, and fire
codes.  Some parties we have even had to hire Seattle police to work the
door or they would have busted the party (even though we did buy
insurance, and did pass fire code - and yes the inspector managed to make
it to almost every rave venue and he always collected his little fee)...
Also, I wasn't at wonderland so I don't know what when down exactly, but
sometimes things like noise reports, drive by seeing 30 kids on a sidewalk
most of whom are 12, anonymous phone calls from the vast array of narcs
that for some reason call police about everything for whatever their
whacked in the head motives are, etc etc etc.

  Things happen, but I really can't agree that someone is cracking down on
"raving" just to stop fun.  If a cop or group of cops are looking to bust
something, odds are they aren't looking at the party, but they are there
for the conditions (fire permits and sh*t) following up from a report of
noise level, drugs, underage kids, permits, etc.  I think it's a
perspective thing.  I'd like to say I'd rather police never came to raves
or paid attention, but you know what, I'd be awefully *glad* they were
around if I saw a fellow raver overdose or get seriously hurt or (forbid)
there actually ever was a fire at a show (anyone ever see a fire at a
rave?) you know what I mean?  Same thing with door security at big
parties, they seem to suck, but overall it makes sense that they pat for
weapons, and take markers...

hope i didn't just open myself for mass flame damage,
love,
Max

I'm from the Seattle scene... sorry if that sounded totally weird when I
wrote that, I was refering back to parties we through where we had to cut
a check to the PD for services rendered - we wrote "extortion money" on
the comment line at the bottom of the check.  Our attitude then was that
we didn't see why we had to pay _them_ instead of our own people just to
keep from being busted.  Their reasoning was the size of the parties
warrented the presence .. like seeing parades or other large gatherings,
there are always police
sorry to ramble even more..

I'm going to make a comment about how I enjoy some of the stupid threads on 
sfraves, and if something pops up that I don't want to read (like all that 
techy 303 stuff that wasn't stupid, but just over my head and generally 
uninteresting to me), then I just delete it and don't whine about it . . . I 
figure I'll have to deal with a bunch of folx telling me about how they 
shouldn't have to do that and blah blah blah, and perhaps you're right, but I 
can honestly say I don't care.  Sorry.  Not trying to be bitchy, just letting 
you know how it is w/ me, my way or the highway and all that (ain't I PLURy?). 
 

And I'd have to say that the dumbest thread I ever saw was the one that was 
real popular when I first subbed, the thread that went something like:
"I like to kiss other girls at parties in front of my boyfriend"
"I hate it when guys come up to me when I'm kissing other girls at parties and 
try to 'get in on the action'"
"just because I like to make out w/ members of the same sex at parties doesn't 
mean I'm homosexual"
"everybody (is/isn't) gay to some degree"
It was dumb, but entertaining.  I laughed my ass off at some of the, shall we 
say, creative logic behind a lot of the posts.

This "dumb conversation" thread is pretty stupid, and pointless too (cuz we're 
still going to have plenty of nrr and other stuff no matter what anyone says). 
 But I participated in the whole astrology thread too, so of course I had to 
participate in this one too.

Part of life is having to deal w/ stuff you don't like.  Why should I (or you) 
expect the list be any different?  I'd sometimes consider complaining about 
all the drug and tech threads, but just because I can't really relate to them 
and I'm not interested in them really doesn't give me the right to censor 
them.  So I kept my mouth shut (until now, sorry) and just made use of my 
delete button.  Because who the hell am I to judge?  You know what they say 
about glass houses . . .

To sum it up:  You may not like what someone else posts.  Chances are they 
could say the same about your posts.  You both could be perfectly justified in 
your disapproval.  So what's easier:  to just delete the uninteresting, 
irrevelant (make that uninteresting and irrelevent to _you_), or to waste a 
lot of bandwidth and time (yours and everyone else's) by complaining about it 
(because nothings going to change).  Well, I think the answer is pretty 
obvious, although it doesn't seem like that to everyone.

Like right now, I'm wasting plenty of bandwidth and time.  But I do that 
regularly, so it's no biggie for me (well, I think most of the stuff I post is 
RR or SFRR, but I'm sure someone can tell me different).  So most of the time 
I keep my mouth shut when others do it, but I just couldn't resist a little 
venting this time.  Had to show you all that you're living in a glass house 
just like mine, cuz I get a big ego boost out of telling people off and being 
patronizing and all that.  What can I say, I gots issues and stuff.

You know me.  Always gotta put my 2 cents in.  I'd apologize but I'm not 
really sorry about doing it and I don't plan on stopping it.  And like I 
always say, I could be wrong.  But I'm pretty sure I'm not this time and it'd 
be hard to convince me otherwise.

DEAR SF RAVES
      It was Mission Impossible only this time it wasnt starring Tom Cruise,
it starred the entire Sf UG scene. THe decorations were beautiful, the vibe
was flowing, the people were smiling, and the masses came out in support of
 Wonderland. The music was just starting really get started, and the police
roll on in. A noise complaint, they say, a bull excuse i say. THe music had
not crept on to the streets that night. Andy, along w/ some times too many
others attempted to convince the police to allow the party to continue. This
mission was impossible, however the SF police Dpt. had already made there
mind up the party would not continue at the dance studio. 
          Now here is where our next mission would start, the party must
continue. Only where would we go, what dj's would follow us to an outdoor
spot. THe decision was made in census, not by the wondercrew but more by the
kids at the party. Before the system arrived, we rather i say they were
dancing in the street to someones car stereo. I at that time was making
several trips back and forth to 24th and mission, and the beach. 
          To make a story shorter, cuz i feel myself rambling. The system did
arrive. Li's set was wicked, yet interupted by the generator running out of
gas, and then me braking it. ( iguess i dont know my own strength) Then the
other Jeremy, Magyvers the generator with a piece of plastic. The Music is
back up, Li starts back up where he left off. Following Li, Micron's set was
amazing as usual( DAn This Doesnt mean you can get a swelled head or
anything). I swear he just messes with our heads, as we shake our booty's to
his set. Just as he finished off his set, the police roll up and the music
goes kupput. Damn it, i swear ill never get to hear Macadio spin live. All
together MISSION COMPLETE. I HaD A BLAST.  MUCh Love to da WonderCRew.

Love~
Jeremy

        The guys who threw wonderland assured us that they had a permit and
the cops would soon be on their way. Unfortunately because of other people
outside trying to get in while the cops were out front didn't help matters
at all.

        I am incredibly happy again. I just got finished spinning at my
first rave ever. It was quite simply, incredible, and I really like spinning
about one million times more than I did when I woke up this morning. I had
to spin first, so there were only like, 30 people dancing but that's 30 more
people than I'm used to. I just can't describe the feeling to someone else
who hasn't experienced it, because it doesn't even make sense to me why
playing your records feels great. But when those dancers locked into the
groove I was trying to establish(quick hardstep with really wacky
basslines)it all came together. When the dancers cheered by the time I got
to my third track I couldn't believe it. Afterwards I was able to 'hang out'
with other DJ's who I didn't talk to much because I was still recovering
from my hour of spinning. Sorry guys.

        I also had many people tell me they thought I was a stoner, because
I was smoking pot the entire time I was spinning. Okay, so I am a stoner,
okay? That's what summer has done to me. I cheer in delight when I go to
sleep after only smoking out 2 times that day. Usually I can't count the
times I smoke out in a day, but I can count the times I was sober in the day.

        Well, that was a weird little aside. Okay, beautiful SFRavers! Us
Berkeley DJ's are finally coming together as a cohesive unit.(Well, we got
turntables and suddenly the Berkeley DJ's came out in full force.) Thanks to
Kraig, Kenni, and DJ Flite for showing me how to spin. I really can't get
enough of it now.

        -chris(I still haven't thought of a stupid DJ nickname, which I need
because chris sucks)

ok guys... check this out..... here's the story... oh man oh man!

First it starts off like this... friday night Andy from wonder and I
head up to the Dance Studio to hang some lighting.... after almost
getting killed by an IntelliBeam, we go to look for the video projector
which came up stolen! (byebye $6000) =(.

And that's just the beginning to a never ending fight! We head on back
to SJ to finish banners and crap and la dee da. The next day (Saturday)
we finish up, pack up, and move on out. We set up the dance studio which
looked fucking amazing. I really mean that. oh yeah.... and ummm Vlad
and AndyW's sets were fucking insane! I didn't get to hear the chill
room cause I was working the lights, but I hear that was farking RAD
too! =) but wait.... what's this..... the lights turn on... but I didn't
turn them on! WTF? I ran over to the front to find out that there are
cops down stairs. Pooie on us! after Andy dealt with the Police for
about an hour, we decided to tell everyone to go to 24th and Illonois.
As people are walking out, we told everyone to go to 24th and Illonois,
but we find out after having told about 100 people to go there, that
it's gated off now. So we told people to go to 3com! so I shoot over to
24th and Illonois to tell everyone to go to 3com. Man there were a shit
load of people there. There I found no gate and it was totally open! so
I called the Wonder crew up and tell them change of plans! EVERYONE come
to 24th and Illonois. Problem again.... we couldn't change the 415 VM
cause it could only be changed from Andy's cell phone which was dead and
there wasn't a charger, but about 150-200 people show up at 24th and
Illonois anyways =) YAY! we're partying again! Finally we get sound
going and man are people having a fuckin' BLAST! it was insane.... I've
never seen a vibe like that! Weeee Li's rockin' us!!! WOW. POOF
generator dies.... no gas, no gas can. Happily Mike takes off to get gas
and Pablo, Beth, and I find fire =) Mike comes back, puts gas in. We get
a fire goin', the other Jeremy pulls the cord on the generator, and BAM!
Broken. Not the string, oh no that would of been too easy, the wheel
inside snapped in half! the crew starts to pack up! I SAY
"NO!!!!!!!!!!!!" we musn't let this die. I tell Aaron to tell the crew
to stop! Aaron tells them "Guys... put it back together, Jeremy will
make it work!" they say, "Otay!". I scurry around to find something to
fix the generator... I find a worn piece of plastic and hope! I run over
to the generator, and they said it wouldn't work, but I tied that wheel
back together, and gave it a pull.... it didn't work.. =( Another dood
gave it a pull.... slowly.... and HOLY FARKING SHIT! it worked.... The
crowd goes absolutely INSANE! the music is jammin' again! Micron come on
and TEARS IT UP!!!!..... I'm going crazy.. I can't believe these people!
I loved them all! I was bouncing everywhere... then a girl comes up and
asks me to take her to get something to eat, and she offered to get me
something, but I was so happy... I said nah... I'll take you anyways....
it turned out that we both decided to buy food for everyone! we hurry
back to find that the cops got us again! =( pooie. but there were about
15-20 people STILL hanging out! oh man... I love this scene.... we chomp
down those donuts and chit-chat... and then we decide to pack up and
skidaddle... 12 people we gonna go to tallPaul's house, but didn't have
a ride, so Andy was gonna run over to the dance studio and drop off the
speakers and come back After about an hour he never showed, so I called
him up and he said he couldn't leave, so I ran back to get the station
waggon and pick these happy people up. I get there about 45 mins later,
pick 'em up, head on down to paul's house and run outta gas! oh boy =)
more bad stuff! wow. so we send 4 people to find gas and the rest of us
pushed the car hehe. after about another hour and a half we finally get
gas and head over to paul's to drop everyone off. me and a few other
head back to the dance studio and finish packing up. we ended up having
to leave the rented lighting equipment and Andy's speakers there cause
we ran outta room. I head back to SJ after dropping people off, but I
couldn't make it, so I went home to fremont and slept till 9:30pm. When
I woke up, I called andy to let him know I was comming to drop off his
stuff, he informs me of MORE bad news... holy shit! more?!?!? yes more!
hehe "The dance studio told me a drum machine got stolen from their
computer room and they won't give me my speakers and rented lights back
until I replace it", "WTF!!!!?!?!?@$?" I say.... and then I laugh again,
more bad stuff.... well that's all folks... kinda, but man what an
adventure! I loved it and I love the scene.... this is what makes the UG
scene so special.... ABSOLUTELY everything that could have gone wrong,
went wrong with the Wonder crew, but we stuck together and pulled off
something really special. it was truely amazing! Now that the Wonder
crew has gone through everything that they could have in their first
party.... be ready for something super kick ass in the future! =)

on a couple of different notes....Tony, I didn't make the donuts hehe we
bought 'em, Christine... the gas cans... one belonged to my friend mike,
and the other one was purchased by him... he took one back with him and
I ended up with the other somehow.

and last but DEFINATELY NOT least.... what the fuck is up with the Dance
Studio those fucking greedy bastards. Check this out. Friday night the
Wonder crew gets charged another $100 for leaving a ladder up. After the
party they told Andy he wouldn't get his $500 deposit back because there
was a piece of gum stuck in the carpet. They also charged him an extra
$100 for being there an hour too late. Then they tell him that he can't
view the video tape durring the time the $6000 projector got stolen.
Then they tell him that they're keeping his rented stuff which he now
has to pay late fees on. What the hell is up with them, this is absolute
bullshit! first off, why would they have a problem with him seeing the
video tape when the projector got stolen, would andy end up seeing dance
studio staff taking it??? what are they hiding there.... $500 for gum?
$100 for a ladder? $100 an hour too late???? Did they just tell andy
that the drum machine got stolen, when in fact it didn't! It definately
wasn't his fault! he can't lock the doors to the computer room nor can
he unlock them! no one could have gotten in there with out the Wonder
crew noticing! I this there is something seriously fucked going on here!

well I had an AWESOME time! I love all of you! have a great day! I need
to go home and get sleep...

                                        .just jer.
                                       -@spire-

ps. @spire's first party is comming up July 12th... get ready for
another something special! =)

<< It's extremely unlikely that the bust was for "raving".  The constitution
 has been limited in other ways - "peaceful assembly" has _numbers_
 attached to it nowadays, and especially for commercial events, there are
 county, city, and state laws regarding venue capacity, insurance, and fire
 codes.  Some parties we have even had to hire Seattle police to work the
 door or they would have busted the party (even though we did buy
 insurance, and did pass fire code - and yes the inspector managed to make
 it to almost every rave venue and he always collected his little fee)...
 Also, I wasn't at wonderland so I don't know what when down exactly, but
 sometimes things like noise reports, drive by seeing 30 kids on a sidewalk
 most of whom are 12, anonymous phone calls from the vast array of narcs
 that for some reason call police about everything for whatever their
 whacked in the head motives are, etc etc etc.
 
   Things happen, but I really can't agree that someone is cracking down on
 "raving" just to stop fun.  If a cop or group of cops are looking to bust
 something, odds are they aren't looking at the party, but they are there
 for the conditions (fire permits and sh*t) following up from a report of
 noise level, drugs, underage kids, permits, etc.  I think it's a
 perspective thing.  I'd like to say I'd rather police never came to raves
 or paid attention, but you know what, I'd be awefully *glad* they were
 around if I saw a fellow raver overdose or get seriously hurt or (forbid)
 there actually ever was a fire at a show (anyone ever see a fire at a
 rave?) you know what I mean?  Same thing with door security at big
 parties, they seem to suck, but overall it makes sense that they pat for
 weapons, and take markers...
 
 hope i didn't just open myself for mass flame damage,
 love,

Salutations,

Well, I'm going to have to agree with Max! I have to admit that I was
slightly angry about Wonderland getting busted and all, but all good things
must come to a stop at some point or even a pause. I guess I just spoke
before thought. My bad. Sorry! Allz good!!!!!!!! =c) I at least had a good
time in the time it was running so I can't complain. 

I'm outtie

you think THAT was a mission impossible?
well here's how our mission went.
showed up @ wonderland @ 2 (my car's battery died andamanda insisted in 
drivign down from SF to pick me up)
and the po are already there. we wait around to get in and get some of 
amanda's christmas lites down..
ask various members of the wonder kru where to go and they tell us
"THE PARK BEHIND 3COM PARK! *NOT* 24th AND MISSION!"
humm, we think, never been to THIS park.
so we drive to 3com park, and stand around in the wind/sit around in our 
cars (there are about 8 cars here) waiting for about a half hour for the 
sound sstem to show up.
po decides to roll. cars scatter, we end up at a house in SJ with JEPH 
spinning for us on decks with no pitch control and stuff like that.
page various friends, trying to find out what happened to Wonder.
around 10 am aaron calls me back and says "oh yea the party went OFF @ 
24th and Illinois!"

so.
it was a mission so impossible it didn't happen for us.
my question is: 3com park... WHAT THE FUCK?
:)
not to be a bitch, next time find a spot.. and stick WITH it.
much love,
lara

APHEX TWIN TO LAUNCH BIG TOP TOUR

After several attempts to bring some sort of roving electronic festival tour
to the highways and byways of America, someone has finally done it.

Moby, Aphex Twin, B.T., Banco De Gaia, and LTJ Bukem will be on hand when the
Big Top tour begins making its rounds on August 27 in Detroit, Michigan.
 Logical Progression, Loop Guru, 808 State, Nico, and many others will be
joined by local DJs at each of the tour's ten stops before things wind up in
Los Angeles on September 13.

Here's where Big Top will be pitching its tents this summer:


8/27 - Detroit, MI @ Pine Knob
8/30 - Washington, D.C. @ Nissan Amphitheater
8/31 - Asbury Park, NJ @ Atlantic Park
9/1 - Boston, MA @ Great Woods
9/3 - Rochester, NY Fingerlakes Amphitheater
9/5 - Atlanta, GA @ Lakewood Amphitheater
9/6 - Orlando, FL @ Central Florida Fairgrounds
9/9 - Dallas, TX @ Starplex
9/12 - San Francisco, CA @ Shoreline Amphitheater
9/13 - Los Angeles, CA @ Snow Valley

someone on the idm list had spoken with aphex twin's manager and confirmed
that there was no way he was playing this tour...however, someone else
also had confirmed that the entire No-U Turn crew was going to play it (Ed
Rush, Trace, Nico...delicious darkstep jungle)...:)

Okay- here's the scoop:

This week we're having indian (my favorite!!!)and as usual, we'll
start at noon. If possible I'd like everyone to be there as close to
12 as possible, b/c this place really gets packed at lunchtime. RSVP

how many people are showing up. Get ready for the BIGGEST indian
buffet ever. Hope to see you there!!

had an amazing time this weekend. pre-party at amber's (go south bay!)
wonderland (at the original location) was cool until until san
francisco's finest(?) showed up. i still had a great time just sitting
in the main room hanging out.
the after party was amazing. it was soooo cold, but everyone there just
partied on.
dancing in the cold on flatbed trailers to a mixtape played on a car
stereo was definitely
a new experience for me.
once the gear finally showed up and the music started up, i really had
an amazing time.
the vibe there was just killer! groovin' out to li and micron's sets as
the sun came up was the best! macadio -- the cops just won't let you
play, will they?
hugz to shua, matt, ED, amber, ethan, julia & sara, nick (what happened
to you?), rubilicious, micron, macadio, deepfog,.... and anyone else
that i forgot to mention.

I did not see jeff's Original post but I just wanted to touch on the
subject a little. E.menon and jeff dont have a FUCKING clue about
doing a party. They are showing there ignorance about doing a party.
First off let me tell you right now THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS A BUST
FREE PARTY IN THE CITY OF SAN FRANCISCO. Unless you have a special
permit like the one that the light seed crew has. A special religion
permit and they are the only ones that have one to my knowledge.  Im
sure Jeff and you E.menon are kewl and you guys go to a lot of parties
and show support but you have never done a party I assume or you would
not be shooting off like this. I am sorry for spamming the list and
venting to everyone it is just this was my friends party and he and
rest of the crew put a lot of love Money and energy into this party
and for some people to just talk shit pisses me off. I could go on
about this for days but I won't I will just let this ride.

Peace,
Macadio

Im not sure if my first message made it out so sorry if some of you
receive this twice. I did not see jeffs original post but I thought I
would touch on the subject a little. Jeff and E.menon don't have a
FUCKING clue on parties or how to do them. I assume this cause if they
did they would not shoot off out the mouth like this. I am sorry to
spam the rest of the list it is  just I need to vent a little. This
was a good friend of mines party He and rest of the crew put a lot of
Love, Money and Energy into this party and For people to Talk shit
pisses me off. Let me tell you a little secret THERE IS NO SUCH THING
AS A BUST FREE PARTY ALL NIGHT DANCE PARTY IN THE CITY OF SAN
FRANCISCO. You can't get a permit for that the only persons that I
have knowledge that can do this legally is the Liteseed crew. They
have a special Religion permit. That is not to say that you can't go
to Oak town and get one but they cost from 3-5 thousand dollars from
what I understand I don't do massives so I don't really care about
permits. If you go to a party there is no gaurantee that it will not
get busted in the city. I could go on for days but I will just let
this ride.

Love,
Macadio

A good friend of mine told me that someone was stabbed and killed at
Origin.exit Is this true?

I had a really good feeling about this party 2 weeks ago. But as last week
began I started to feel really different. I dunno what it was. I had
planned to go up until Saturday but I decided not to (or actually by
body did)and I fell asleep on the couch at my new pad in Oaktown. It's sad
that things like this can happen in what seems to be the most
loving/understanding setting I know.

God bless the victim of this. May his/her spirit be free to roam the
cosmos.

In a somewhat related side-note, Moby was on "Viva Variety" (a weird
variety show on Comedy Central) last night.  He was playing electric
guitar, at times apeing the Pete Townshend windmill style.

I couldn't watch.  I couldn't listen.  "Go" was so beautiful, and then???

Could someone please confirm this? If this is true this will be the 3
death in the Nomad Origin history Let us not forget that 2 people died
from there boat cruise and I did not see them posting about doing a
party for the victims famlies either. What is up with that? I feel
that is very sad and unfortunate. Maybe this is some kind of sign? or
Karma or whatever you may want to call it.

Peace and be safe,
Macadio

first of all i would like to say THANK U TO ANDY P> and the WHOLE
CREW!!

this was probably the strangest and most challenging night that i have
ever had.

but first:
the ppl. over at the dance studio are getting WAY to GREEDY and need
to be shown that we WILL NOT support this type of attitude.  their
prices have been going up steadily as the demand for the studio has
gone up AND they know that they are now a "known" location with no
guarantee of not gettting busted.  but what pisses me off is that they
would make andy pay for a drum machine that was in a LOCKED room, by
renting out the space THEY are accepting responsibilty for their own
equipment.  It is their responsibility to make sure that what they
consider valuable is locked away in a secure space.  AND...i won't
even go into how i feel about them charging andy for the ladder and
gum (though i don't know enough about the gum situation to really make
an educated stand on this matter).  I mean..the gum should be cleaned
up.....

anyways...back to the party:
CRAZY/STRANGE/INCREDIBLE...is how i describe it.

here is a condensed version of the craziness:
1: map point get's all screwed up (faster bamboo was supposed to do
it), so we do it at my house.
2: directions to map point get screwed up (wrong v.m. #)
3: get to the party (very excited about spinning) hang out...the cops
show.
4: after about a half hour a sitting there they kick everyone out.
5: after party-3com or the "other spot"???
6: drive by 3-com only to encounter some not-so-friendly types.
7: get a page...go to "other spot"...UGH!!!!
8: get there....ppl. are going of to a car stereo..like
100+..crazy...but way cool.
9.  sound and genny FINALLY get there, set up, start jamming...Li
busts out the first set. nice techno to start off the morning (sun is
coming up by now)
10.  WHAM genny runs out of gas (wait 30 min. more while someone goes
to get some)....WHAM again...the genny breaks...jeremy fixes it and we
start up again...SHEESH
11.  i FINALLY get to spin..YEAH....about 15 min. into it someone
points out a cop car to me...NOW WHAT??  i truly think this night was
meant as a test of everyone's will power......about 5 min. later 2
cars show up and that's IT!  (well...atleast i got to play for like 20
min. hey macadio..don't worry you'll play first at the next
party..even if it's the 9:30-11 time slot.  ;)
12. we pack up and jeremy shows up with like 3 dozen donuts (u guys
kick ASS!) man by then i could use the sugar.
13. we pack up the sound and leave......i'm ever soo tired and hardly
got to spin and drove around/waited for most the night....but i STILL
had a blast.

THANKS TO EVERYONE who made it out....u guys showed me something that
i haven't seen in a while.......

a desire to be there and create your own vibe/destiny and NOT bitch
and complain the whole time.....

thank you....
micron

SF doesn't give permits for that type of party without very rare special
exception. That's why virtually all legal events are in Oakland. (where
they've now decided to limit permits to one per night due to all the shit
they've had to deal with)

The problem with SF is that there seem to be few viable locations (or
people don't have the time to look for new ones) and obviously the police
and, perhaps more impotantly, the neighbors, know what's going on. If they
get a noise complaint they'll be more prone to act on it if it's happening
every week.

Hmm, what the hack ever happened to SFRL?

Joe

I'm going to have to disagree with anybody blindly assuming the police are
always in line when busting parties however.  Often, they break a party up
without processing any arrests or paperwork (citations, violations, 
whatever) because they were not within the law when breaking up the party.  

You see, back when I was young, we had these things called rights...

Permits are good and permits are nice, but it's nieve to believe that
permits are either cheap or reasonable.  Often, they include clauses
indicating what security should be used, or will allow for police
guidelines, like mandating that at least half of the on duty force be paid
police officers (who aren't cheap by any standards).  They also usually
require multiple walk throughs by police and fire personnel,
liability insurance (for those of you who like to sue when things go wrong
as they sometimes do), and a whole buncha other good stuff, which is often
impractical or impossible on relatively short notice.  All these things
cost money.  I was involved in a permitted party a while back, and it was
VERY pricey and a full time job for those throwing it to pull off.

It's tough to break even on a small permitted party, so expect to see more
small unpermitted parties.  Hell, if the police keep breaking up our more
'regular' venues, expect to see some full blown bolt cutter renegades.

The harder they make it to throw one, the harder we go off when we have
one.  The harder we go off, the more hardcore we get, and the less we
will stop at to get there again.  

Repetitive beats... repetitive beats...

I should hope the majority of us don't think parties should be about
liability and lawsuits but more an escape from it.  A place about being
real and accepting personal responsibilty for yourself, and taking what
you want, and dancing the way you want, and doing what you want with who
you want.  About getting the whole room to lift a couple inches off the
ground, if even for a second.  Where the only rule is that the needle stay
in the groove, and the only code of behavior is your own mutual respect
extend towards all there regardless of your hangups.  The tribe has
nothing to do with the law.  The tribe is an alternative to the law,
because the law doesn't work for everybody.  The tribe does not select
those who join it, those who join it choose to join the tribe.  It is a
question of free will, and free will alone, and in this place where
anything is possible we find one another, dream a sometimes common dream,
and come back to 'life' monday all the better for it.  

This freedom, this community, it is a great wealth, and we act liked the
most spoiled of children when we discuss it.  We talk about the what
"they" do, about what "they" spin, and often forget that this is a "we"
thing, not a "they" thing.  If you're not willing to take part of the
responsibilty for this, then go buy your massive tickets at BASS and enjoy
your licensed, permitted, secure, policed, bignamedj, 4 billion watt
laser, render you deaf after 2 second sound system with bass to the gills
bouncy castle and fire breathing wannabe disneyland hellhole with the rest
of those see it a little differently.  Actually, that sorta sounds fun
too, but I love small parties, I love the freedom and the freaks and the
chance to get around to meeting everyone.

Or maybe I'm just ranting because I had a few more records to go when they
shut us down Saturday... I dunno.

I'll shut up now...
Andy

p.s.	Hella props to those who kept going, wish I coulda been there.

well, i'd probably like to kiss other people in front of my girlfriend, but
i don't have one right now.  would anyone like to be my girlfriend?  I
mean, Pablo, there you were looking pretty convincing yesterday when you
made my organic apples into boobs.

The only requirement for being my girlfriend if we like get married nStuff
( hi jeff) is that like we have to name one son Maxwell. Either a first or
middle name, I dont' care which.

No no, don't even think about it.  Deepfog Jr. would be just too cheezy.

I was there and there were not two deaths but two stabbing, one person did leave our dimension and has gone on to the next level. The other person has survived from what I understand.

There was a lot of confusion for a little while. With security all over the place searching for the person or persons responacable. The good news ( if there could be any ) is most people at the part had no clue this had happened. This includes myself, I did notice cops and security and an old man wondering around for a while searching for something. When finally some one told me what had transpired, I ran into Tom one of the promoters and told him how sorry I was that this went down at his party, he told me he was upset about and some other things I care not to repeat.  

All in all after looking and watching for a little while I have this to say.

I have been raving well over ten years now, I came out here from NY City and have some deep roots in the scene. I am now 28 going on 29, I have seen gangs my whole life ( never joined one ), I do know and understand what gangs offer some people on the streets.

Point is this, keep your gang related SHIT on the street where it belongs, kill each other on the street! ( you should really try acting like a MAN and use your fist, but that is anther whole topic ) When you come to a rave, your COLORS and DISPUTES need to stay at the door. Inside the Rave or Party we are all there for one thing and that is to enjoy the music and each others company while hopefully achieving some better understanding of each other. If you can not do this you should not FUCKING GO! 

I hear a lot of people talk about east coast and west coast, FUCK THAT, you live in the STATES or you do NOT, I personally do not listen to anything that tells me to go out and whack some one period. That message will not make me a better person it will only help me become a thug! I choose to help uplift the human spirit and treat my fellow Brother and Sister ( White, Black, Red, Yellow, Purple, Green , etc.. ) with some sort of respect and understanding. Trust me I have made my share of mistakes in my life, I always try and walk away learning something.

Get a grip, if your life goal is to roll around in a Benz or a Porch by the age of 17 or 20, and you achieved this by hurting a fellow human being , you my friend are PART of THE PROBLEM on this planet. 

I have little 6 year old girl, and personally if some one killed her because she got caught in a crossfire from some gang related bullshit, I would be one raging mother fucker.

Try this . Close your Eyes, picture yourself with a child ( son or daughter ) now picture your child getting caught in something they had nothing to do with because of some punks wish and desire to be rich or have juice or power or to be so called COOL.
Now how do you feel, if you feel nothing you have some soul searching to do.

Remember you will grow older, your views will natural change, you will probably end with children, what type of state do you want to leave them in?

To be COOL, you do not have to do stupid shit to prove something to your friends, if you need to do this for them, I would question who I hang out with. To be REALLY COOL try making your Fucking Neighbor Hoods look better, try helping an Old Lady Cross a street, Try talking with a Truly homeless person an offer them help. 

We all get mad an upset, take a breath punch your brick wall ( I do ) and then re think it! Is a life worth the actual problem? How would you feel if some was gonna whack you and you did not even know? Or if some one was making fun of you, or raging on you? Is what they are saying true ( if so change it ) if not blow it off and laugh at them for being so damn insecure about themselves and give them a hug. 

Oh well enough preaching, we all know the difference between right and wrong, stop - look - and listen!

Peace for the masses - Pete

Could someone please confirm this? If this is true this will be the 3
death in the Nomad Origin history Let us not forget that 2 people died
from there boat cruise and I did not see them posting about doing a
party for the victims famlies either. What is up with that? I feel
that is very sad and unfortunate. Maybe this is some kind of sign? or
Karma or whatever you may want to call it.

Peace and be safe,

I hope no one misunderstands my last message, I am not bitching directly at any body on the Mailing list, some one and much younger than I, has pointed out to me that this is what it could be taken like ( and good point he has ) .

just as ravers who might not be into clubs are probably not frequenting the
right clubs, you are imvho not frequenting the right raves if you are
commenting only on an experience at a funky tekno tribe massive.

this imvho is anything but a ug party.  overcommercialized, thrown to put
money into the pocket of the promoter.  not for the right reasons or to
raise awareness and consciousness (both of which tie into that ever
important *vibe*), which are two things i look for in ug parties.

just for fun, check out
http://www.cloudfactory.org/knowledge/askyourself.html.  it sort of ties
into why we do what we do, why we go the places we go, and asks us to
investigate these things within ourselves.  by answering the questions, you
may come to an understanding about why you prefer the things you do.....or
why you don't.

I wasn't spouting off at the mouth.

Just being Anal. For one. I wasn't there. So I don't know. I was just
simply beating the next guy to that "anal" punch. Someone was bound to say
it. I thought I would get a kick out of saying it first.

There is alot of things I don't know how to do, or just can't seem to
articulate. But as far as not having "a FUCKING clue" about something. You
would be surprised what I can pull off with the proper modivation.

Anyways. Try not to be so offencive nStuff. Sheeesh.
You hurt my feelings.  =[..

But. We all should no by now that "THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS A BUST FREE
PARTY IN THE CITY OF SAN FRANCISCO" We all have heard it right here in the
past. If anyone in the Bay Area can throw a phat party on there first
attempt. It would be us "SFRavErs"

Cops are out to up-hold the law. It's not there fault if the promoters

This is crazy..  Getting stabbed at a ravE.

I thought it was all peacefull. No..

Anyways. I don't think these promoters are on the SFRave list?
That would of been a great thing to do though. Throw a benifit party for
the victoms parents. But, thinking about it. The victoms parents probably
tryed to sew the promoters maybe? This would make it pretty difficult to
deside to throw a party for there benifit I think.

I don't know though.
Any facts on the stabbingz nStuff?

Well this here is going to be my final post on SFRaves for a while.  I
have to leave the list and leave the rave scene at that for a while now. 
I was in class today and I was thinking about the scene in general.  I
thought about the love and the and the common goal to have a killer
party.  Then I started thinking about how it's changed me.  While it has
made me a much more understanding and open minded person, it has also
caused me to slack off in my school work.  I was in psychology today and
I started thinking, "Fuck, I used to be on the Dean's List before I
started raving.  Now I'm sitting here getting a 2.25 (spring semester)
GPA."  I can deny it and say it's not 'cause of raving but the fact is
that this shit didn't happen when I wasn't raving.  As a result, I'm
going to have to go cold turkey and separate myself from this whole thing
until I feel that I'm able to have enough discipline to combine the rave
scene with my schoolwork.  This is college now and you can't do half-ass
work like you can do in high school.

Being on this list has allowed me to meet so many beautiful people. 
First, I would like to give thanks to Christine the Candy Girl (brown
hair) for originally getting me into SFRaves.  It was great knowing you
and I'm sure I'll run into you again some day.  Thanks to Macadio.  The
first DJ I actually ever knew personally.  You're a totally nice guy and
you spin some of the coolest shit.  Keep up the good work man.  Also, to
the many others I have met including Orson, Maggie, Elena, Lara, Dan,
Beth, Pablo (excellent attitude), Mike (or Mark, shit I always forget.)
and more, it's just that I can't remember all the names.

Again, you are all some of the coolest people I've met and I'm sure one
day I'll be able to join you guys again.  Happy Kids is going to be my
last party for a long while then I'm going to vanish.  I'm going to try
and make my exit go with a bang.

I hope you all stay as awesome and I'll see whoever is going to be at
Happy Kids on Friday.  I'll be wearing a blue Hawaiian shirt so I won't
be hard to find.  If you see me, come give me a going away hug and make
me leave this family with a warm feeling.

You all have the highest respects from me.

Andrew -

You cannot read very well, the whole message was no Violence, I was giving an alternative to using a knife, it has to come to it, which it never should anyway, you stand up and use your own ability. Both options are evil, it is left to pick the lesser of the two.

You I feel are a little full of yourself  for even making a comment like this, you are already showing an attitude which is what we do not need here or anywhere.

If you now feel better for making this comment on something that was in general a good message, I am glad and very happy for you. I hope we can meet someday and find some common ground on how we view the world.

To ignore the evil out there is to be part of it!

true. tho i heard it was 2 ppl; 2 stabbed and 1 killed. hence my foul mood
yesterday. god, i've never heard of anything like this - one, why would you
stab someone in the first place? does this really solve the arguement? and
two - at a _rave_? someone posted earlier that we weren't there hurting
anyone - and most of us aren't. but speak only for yourself, 'coz there are
obviously those out there who get some kind of sick pleasure out of killing
ppl.

funny, i had a really strange feeling about going to this party. but i went
- it was my first sf party... had to check it out. and back to the 'raver v
clubber' thread... i posted that we should all respect ppl's individual
choices, but this kind of shit cannot be respected. people, please, don't
bring weapons to parties. fuck, why do you need them anyway? really, you
can certainly have more fun without them. i have never been so stunned
about anything in my life. except the deaths of friends in the past. this
is outrageous. at a rave. bunch of ppl having a grand old time, right? ha.
plur? what's plur when ppl are killing each other? i think we need to get a
bit more basic here. maybe it hit me so hard because i was under the
influence at the time, but i think i would have reacted the same way if
sober. i couldn't stop thinking about it for the rest of the night (and
then all day yesterday). everywhere i looked, ppl began to look more evil
to me (not all, but some).... granted the argument was a personal one, but
what if some young kid had gotten in the way? obviously these ppl didn't
place any value on life. anyway, i'm rambling, i'm shocked,   i'm just
shocked. far too fucked up for my somewhat peaceful mind to comprehend. i
don't have any answers, only questions. what can be done to prevent this
sort of thing from happening again? you know, i don't even believe in the
death penalty (in that case - far worse to have to live your life in a
restricted cell). life *is* precious. nothing should be solved by death. it
really doesn't solve anything.

>God bless the victim of this. May his/her spirit be free to roam the
>cosmos.

victims. and not just those killed and injured (not to say that that isn't
the most important thing). i think that there were those among us at the
party who felt this very deeply. it really hurts us all, whether we know
the people or not. this sort of thing shouldn't be happening, especially
not among our 'tribe'.

anyway, i'll stop rambling on now.... i really hope that this isn't a sign
of things to come.

_peace_.
e. (not smiling about this one)

one other side comment about the party: men: do not come up and try to
dance on top of me. do not drool at me, do not ask me if i want to dance
with you. please. i'm already dancing, and quite happy that way. i don't
dress provocatively; perhaps those that do enjoy this sort of goggling
(can't imagine why tho). really, and this is where the respect comes in....
we're all there to have fun. respect *that* if nothing else. i'm not
speaking for other women, but i personally don't take this machismo shit.
makes me sick. how could i respect a guy who (one) has no respect for me,
and (two) thinks it's cool to drool over women as if they were starving men
looking at food they couldn't have? how insane.

but aside from the above (and the lack running water) it was a great party!
really. many nice folks. it's just that some things tend to rub me the
wrong way. my problem, i guess.

snip

actually, i have thrown a few parties. so it was in 91.  and i have a good
friend that is a promoter in austin. he always has to get a shit load of
permits, insurance, etc etc. and is always very careful about these things.
i don't think that any of his parties have ever been busted. the only thing
illegal that goes on there is the dealing, and he's never involved in that.
but you're right, i am not familiar with the sf zoning laws, fire codes,
insurance requirements, and so on. so perhaps i spoke too soon. it's just
that in the other places that i know ppl who throw parties, there is always
a lot of red tape that has to be cut through. guess this isn't so here.
weird. but my mistake. anyway, i wasn't 'shooting off' as you so eloquently
put - i was merely stating that _IMO_ if you're going to throw a party, you
should check with city hall, sfpd, or who ever, to find out what exactly
needs to be done. there are so many parties out here, i find it hard to
believe that they are _all_ busted as you wrote. really? _all_ of them?
what the fuck is the point of paying $20 if you know that every party is
going to be busted? and if they aren't _all_ getting busted, obviously some
of them are doing things by the books. i was not 'talking shit'... merely
stating my opinion. and no, i'm not 'k e w l'.

and please, next time you respond to something i wrote, if you're also
responding to the entire list, take my email addy off it. it's so
ridiculous to have to sift through duplicates of everything.

apologies for sounding sour, but i don't care to get flamed, i'm recovering
from the shock of the stabbings, and i think there were judgements here
that were unfounded.

cheers - e.

i'm so super duper sorry to everyone at wonderland who was expecting
me there to help out. i was veannnapped by justin and taken to
fremont. we were suppose to be back by the time bao picked us up but
our ride left to get burgers and never came back. :( so i was stuck in
bfe til 9:00 in the morning! i promise i promise i promise i promise
never ever ever to flake on paula again. i will neber eber let
irresponsible 17 year old boys tell me, "yah we'll have you back by
7PM." i'll be there next time to paint, set up and clean up toilet
bowls, promise!  :)

anyways, so much to say and rather than responding to all the posts
i'll 
write some of them here...

gee thanks! <said sarcastically> i never thought my simple satire on
clubs could've started something like this. oh well! next time i'll
write a "why sometimes i think raves are silly" post and see where
that goes. :)

i said it a while ago i'll say it again. (i think i called mr.'nstuff
this, hi jeff:) i think the main problem with flames and posts is that
sometimes people get a bit too ANAL RETENTIVE about stuff. raves
aren't perfect. not everyone is a happy glittery candy raver and even
so, sometimes certain people get irritated by all this "HI!!! want a
sticker??" thing or john s. lee's very very very clear statement about
how PLUR sucks. the idea is wonderful, it just gets really cheesy
sometimes... and sometimes people elaborate their hate towards certain
things or misunderstand what people say. i mean, you can't totally
express the sound of voice and tone through an email! so people take
what someone says too seriously sometimes and that can start a flame
war.

in a way i was a bit mad when i first read his post and felt it 
was a flame but i've realized i was a bit sarcastic in my original 
and defense post. i meant no harm or to start racial remarks.. 
i had no idea the thread was going to be headed towards this hate
thing.
it was just meant to be a satirical humorous post. but oh well! my bad.
sowweeeeey! please accept my apology (or do i have to get on my knees
and beg, hehe but i won't open my mouth :P)

see you all at happy kids! =)

no, this is what we were _told_. back when i was young, the police got away

they cost a shit-load. i've heard quotes floating around the $100k mark.

i find all venues fun in different ways. i like the big name djs, as well
as the ug parties, as well as the clubs. it's just that if you're going to
an unpermitted party, be aware of the possible bust. likewise, if you break
the law, chin-up and take responsibility for your actions instead of
whining about it.

a visit from the paradigm.shifter:

yes, there are people out there who for some reson feel the need to make
their presence in society felt via a mighty hand.  both in the outside
world, and yes, within our own little microcosm as well.  let me rephrase
that:  there are people in the great big world we try to avoid by building
this community that do engage in violent acts, and sometimes they spill
over into our community.  to think that these types of things will not
happen at a "rave" or wherever there is "raver" presence is imo not only
narrow.minded but also pretty foolish.  we may try to escape the horrors of
mainstream society via the community we strive to uphold and nurture, but
we cannot escape the world around us, and to think that we are impermeable
to any negative forces from the outside is a little hasty.  it isn't "us"
and "them".  it's us trying to create a community for us, a community which
strives to absorb as many of "them" as can understand the foundation atop
of which "us" stands.  i do not know why this person resorted to an act of
violence, there are many other ways to reslove a conflict.  i in no way
endorse violent behavior as a means of conflict resolution, but i would
like to comment on how quickly we tend to jump to conclusions about someone
else's actions, although we stand outside of the situation, and can in no
way know all of the reasons behind why that particular action was chosen.
once again, as i said, i am in no way trying to jump to this person's
defense, but for a community that prides itself on understanding, it seems
like there is an awful lot of finger pointing and alienation going on.  and
this is one reaction which does anything but alleviate the problem of
violence.  the more a person who engages in such activity is shunned, the
more he will lash out.  i urge you to be careful of the things that you say
in the heat of a very emotional moment, which i am sure this was and i am
sorry that you had to witness it.  but at the core of harmonious
relationships between fellow human beings is an understanding of the
arbitrary nature of all things.....i could comment for hours on other
things touched upon in this post, but i think this is generally the gist of
what i am trying to say.  i hope it is understandable....

my condolences to all of those touched by this travesty.

love,
lola

You have yet to meet a promoter who keeps the profits, you mean? A lot
of parties make money. The question is what the promoters do with it...

A Kick Ass, Kick Ass, Kick ASS (Did I say Kick Ass?) Weekend!!!

Ben, Iris, Adam M. and Myself got up there around 7-8PM and set up. What
a Bomb site!! Plenty of different areas to set up camp and the garden
was so cool! It's been quite a while since I've gotten spiritual over a
party, but this one really blew my mind. MARS & MYSTR-E both spun 3-4
hour MONSTER SETS that just kicked my ass all over the place. Especially
MARS's final hour & 1/2 which I have to say, was both violent and
beautiful at the same time. Something about it caused me to associate it
with feelings of death. How can this have been good? It was like a
thunder and lightning storm or like a gigantic twister: awsome forces of
nature that have a life of their own and wield incredible power. I swear
at about 5AM I was inside my tent thinking I was going to die! And
then... the music stoped... the sun came out... and it was one of the
most beautiful days I have ever seen. Everyone seemed totaly different,
changed. The garden was so fantasic to chill in. It was as if we had all
died the night before and that this was the afterlife. Heaven. Paridise.
Nothing to do except lounge around, eat fruit, smoke out, talk, kiss,
jump in the hot tub, ect...

Awsome, Awsome, party.

i was just refering to an earlier comment on respecting ppls choices in the
(yawn) ravers v clubbers thread. i brought that up (and i did write this)
because last week i was all for respecting all ppl for their individual
choice. but i can no longer say that i believe in this - not after

ahem. i don't think of myself as being narrow-minded. naive, when it comes
to certain things, and optimistic about the potential of this tribe, and
humanity in general. i believe that we all, wrong-doers included, have some
good within us. sometimes tho (and here my education in sociology will
become flamingly apparent) our socialization hides this so well that even
we can't feel it anymore. you know, i have a lot of sympathy for kids who
have to go through so much shit that the only family they can find is
within a gang. this in no way means that i tolerate or accept the way that
they choose to handle conflicts. i think ppl can change, and i'm optimistic
in that way. yes, i'm naive. i grew up in a super-liberal enclave in a
relatively small town in upstate ny, spent some time in a secluded arts
community in phila, and lived in austin for a while, which is very a
peaceful, laid-back community. partied mostly in toronto, upstate ny, and
austin. (TO rules by far!!) i've never had to deal with gang-violence.
naive, sheltered.... but narrow-minded - not a chance. anwyay, i feel like
i've been having to defend my comments on this list far too much. i haven't
'jumped to any conclusions' about what happened saturday night. all i know
is that 2 ppl were stabbed, one wound up dying. the only thing i said was
that i was in a state of shock over it, and perhaps this is due to my
naivete. i still stand behind my opinion that killing someone is not a way
to deal with a conflict. no, i don't know what they were fighting over. i
don't really care to know - i don't see how it would make a difference to
my opinion. killing people doesn't solve anything. i never said that we
were impermeable to life outside of raving; it just saddened me that this
was happening among so many people who were there soley to have a good
time, to escape all the shit that goes on in day-to-day life. saddened me
that it happened in such close proximity. nor did i say anything about 'us'
and 'them'. we are a human race, in my view; all people, all colors,
genders, religions, etc. one human race. and i still will respect the
majority of ppl for their choice in life. but i cannot, nor will i even try
to accept, understand, or respect people who kill others over a
disagreement. i don't even want to. if this makes me less of an
understanding or compassionate person, so be it. there are some things that
i refuse to tolerate. arbitrary, my ass. you know, i usually encourage ppl
to be what ever they choose, and i do respect their choices. but when
someone else's choice starts to affect un-involved ppl, they have, IMVHO,
crossed the line. and no, i can not respect murder. sorry. maybe i am
narrow-minded then.

(by the way, i did not witness this. i heard, like everyone else, and
experienced the after-effects. be careful what you say, please.)

peace, e.

	Where there are illegal drugs there will be violence. If you're
a PLUR-baby that does illegal drugs, understand that your money is
supporting violent activities. You are feeding the sharks. Even if
the person you get your drugs from seems nice & peaceful, understand
that the person that your dealer buys from probably isn't so nice.

Why is it that all the killings seem to only happen at massives? It's just
another reason why I like the underground much more... Even if there is more
chance of the party getting shut down... at least there isn't that kind of
violence...

Got there in full daylight while there were still level spots nearby for
one's tent (a refuge - privacy - luxury).  Plenty of time to explore and
meet people!  Really good group, several hot tubs, nice warm weather (yes,
we had to bundle up after dark).  Took both kids and they loved it.  My son
even got to take part in one of my favorite raving rituals: making a friend.
I told him good job but next time get their phone #.   

Later, Ethan was excellent(despite some very ill-timed tech failureS) WITH
some of his own tracks!  Dance ground was resilient.  Groups came out and
joined in waves, repeatedly.  Moonshadows and blacklight.  The party was
excessive, but not damaging. 

Next day after more socializing, had an episode in the mud bath where
Darrell got sucked into the mire trying to rescue frogs.  He was unremovable
after my efforts.  A very muddy Candice dug us out!

Nature+music+dance = Wonderful road trip!

XO  Rhoda

I'd be willing to hypothesize that one supports as much violence by paying
taxes.

Sure!   =]:..  .

Wait a minute here though. Slow down people.. Max is a nice name? I can
kiss other girls while dating JiLieJiL? Is that your real name? Your real
name is not Bob or John or something is it? I like JulieJiL though, I
think. How do you say that?

=]:...
Wait a minute here though. I got DeepFog over here thinking one thing, and
everybody else thinking another. Can I please have the post I sent that
made people think these strange things. What was it I said agian? Since
when did I get involved in this DeepFog's girlfriend thing?

Jeez.. I think I am losing it? Thats not a question huh! Wait a minute I
did it agian? If you have ever seen me at a ravE, you would know that...You
do not have to worry about me going around kissing other girls behind your
back.

But. I am really confused..  =]:.. ..
You got to excuse me.


Ok?
Jeff
Please enlighten me peoplez!

On another note. Damn..There is some serious drama going on in my little
90210 crue right now. This is funny.
Oh.

i'd be willing to bet that we support more in this manner. worse yet is
that we're given no choice!

I want to say sorry to all victims loved ones. Death is a very difficult
to deal with
for many. I was at Splish on Valentines when all that drama occurred. The
night 
started pretty shitty. We where supposed to be on the boat by midnight,
we didn't even
start boarding till 1:00 AM. They put Doc Martin and Jeno in the smallest
room , so there 
wasn't much dance area. There wasn't much eye candy either or should I
say, none?!  The only thing positive about the evening was the vibe.
Everyone was ready to dance the night away
until shit happened. I really did not why they even turned the music back
on and tried to continue.
A few days later I called the voice mail and suggested they donate the
money they made
to the families. As far as I know they didn't(if anyone knows they did
please correct me). So I 
hope this time they take responsibility and help the families if they
need it.


                                                                         
 Yours affectionately ,

Saturday night turned out to be one of the shittiest night I have had in 
a very long time...  This is NOT a flame..  I don't do that...

I heard many many good things about wonderland from the list, and word 
of mouth  (traveled all the way to sacramento, must be a very cool 
party) so I decided this would be a good party for two of my first-timer 
friends.. We trek out to SF, and after map point phone problems, we make 
it there just a few minutes after the cops did.  We hang for about 20 
mins to find out if there is going to be a party..  I decide that since 
nothing is going to change really quickly so I go to my car to get 
bubblicious(plug!!  This party is going to be legit!!  I guarantee it 
will not be broken up by the cops) fliers to hand out... I get there to 
find my car window smashed, and my backpack gone(and it had all my 
fliers in it!!! )... I was parked in a very well lit area about 2 blocks 
from the party, right next to a bar...  This sucks, "but hey, I know 
where I can find a cop!".. I go back to the party and go inside... All 
five of the cops standing just inside the door talking to each other 
were too busy "investigating" to take a report... I am pissed, its 
getting late and still no word of whats going to go on so I start the 1 
1/2 hour drive back to Sac cold as hell with no window(my sweater was in 
my backpack)... fucking sucks...
I ended up paying $400 to stand in front of a dance studio...

Which brings up another point.. I counted six cop cars in front of the 
party... If they were doing their job... oh well .....

Thank you to everyone who came to my hootenanny!!  I had NO idea what to
expect, but I was really happy with the turnout.  For those of you who
didn't make it...about 10-12 people came by and we all spent a little
quality time with eachother and Mario.  A special thanks to Andy W for offering
to spin (even though it didn't work out).  I am hoping to organize something
like this again and I hope to see you all there!

WONDERLAND...
was WONDERFUL!!  All this talk about details.  Honey, I had a mega-blast!!  
Busted or not the vibe was undeniable.  No one, but no one can keep us from
partying!!  Big hugs and a pat on the back to all the people responsible.  You
did a great job.  Period.

Tight squeeze and canned cheese...

>:) Amber

WARNING--Below is the goofy part where I say hello to my friends and it drives
         you nuts unless your name is on there in which case you get excited---

Jelo and Matt-SO glad I met you, don't forget Wednesday
Ed-You wacky Brit, get your butt over there too!
Schwa-are you on this list?  Drop me a line...
Shawn and John (?) - Thanks for coming guys, hope to run into you again!
Julia-Starlight starbright, you light up everything around you
Alik-don't even know where to begin...

Man, I hope I didn't forget anyone.  All my memories are kind of fuzzy...hmmm

Peace be with you!
I was sad when it was busted as I was *really* enjoying Andy W's set but
I still had a cool night. Never before have I seen so many people dancing
wildly to a car radio!  The highlight for me was when about 10 of us all
put our hands together and lotion was poured all over them and what can
only be described as a hand orgy happened!
Thanks specially to Amber for giving me a ride at the very last minute.
lovely lady. I finally got to say a personal hello to Micron and Macadio
too, which was nice. ( Hi ben + Iris if your there) Thanks to jelo for
..well everything.
I'm so impressed at every ones determination not to let the party die.
Take care
Love 
Edx

	Nice rationalization, kids. But you *do* have a choice about buying 
illegal drugs. Or do you?

E,

In your responses below you say, "Take responsibility for your actions...accept
the consequences..."  I think what Macadio was trying to say when he flamed,
er, posted back to you earlier was: The city of San Francisco does not issue
permits for the purpose of All Night Dance Parties [tm] PERIOD.  Therefore, all
SF located raves are unpermitted, so to speak.

So, to that end, anyone who goes to a party in SF should be prepared for the
fact that it might get busted and accept that they are taking that risk.

Am I wrong?

b.

Also, couldn't help but comment on this.  Earlier you said something about
taking your name off the to: field when commenting back to you _and_ sfraves...
 It's an email etiquette thing.  If you are in the to: field then this msg is
for you, to you and you are to take action [or think about it or whatever].
 The people in the cc: or bcc: fields are to take note, but not take action.
 Therefore, it is totally within etiquette and proper form to put you in the
to: field and cc: sfraves.  Not efficient always, but correct.

I am curious,

 I heard people saying "Dance studio."  Is this the studio on Minna?
 If so. They threw Simple Pleasures there Friday night. And now that I
think about it. The promoters of that (no offence) were pretty together.
They told everyone to park way down the street at DV8 on the voice mail,
that it was a map point at 540 Howard. And they had staff hanging out
around there to point you in the right direction. Followed by more staff as
you approached that would help you back on the path if you got lost.
 I don't know really if they planned this out or anything. But what better
way to keep the cops out of the party?
 Staff see's cop, staff scrambles... Cops look for map point at 540 Howard
st..


 You know?

hai. I have to agree...the only reason violence is associated with illegal drugs is because of the fact that it is illegal.
anyone remember prohibition? all the mobsters arose to make speakeasys and stuff...
If you make a drug legal, suddenly gangs are fighting over chemlabs and supplies that are a dime a dozen and higher quality. 
They dont fight over that anymore. they move on to stuff thats still illegal.
Damn govt. :P

what a lovely flashback that is....not that i have heard jeno, but the song
rez brings back *lots* of flashbacks for me.....like pulling up to organic
96 in bear valley right behind three carloads of friends from home who had
cosmically just arrived, as well and stepping out of our cars and hearing
the pings of rez echo through the mountains.  like the fnf (uh, when was
it?  one of my *favorite* parties to date) that got busted and moved to
redwood city when the inTIMidator busted out his famous rez/cowgirl mix
(which darren and company threw down live at organic as well :)  music is
so cool like dat, no pun intended.  it brings back all of these brain
crumbs.  thanks you vertigo.go (i think this is you, anyhoo).

There will be violence anywhere people feel the need to defend their resources
- whatever they are, or are an end to - with force.  Illegal or legal, drugs or
tomatoes, makes no difference.

I want to thank everyone who posted on how to beat match. You have 
turned me on to one of my current favorite ways to get high.

But I have a problem. All I have at home is a dual CD player(cheapo).
Is there a formula for beat matching, on CD's? 
Am I just a beginner?
Is that why Trains Wreck at Casa Hernan?

I am no where near learning about Programming and phrasing and such but 
would apprieciate knowing where I am headed.

Also does anyone out there cue up DATs. I first started making tapes 
from my DATs and boy the Gemini dual player seems light years ahead.
For people who have less expierience than me I have a tip...
record everything you do!
Save the first tapes you make. 
They will be valuable to you in the future.
But they have value now. 
They have all your mistakes on them.

so i don't know how it happened, but i got to share with you all (though i have
not officially been to any raves in calif yet, because i didn't leave early
enough for wonderland and actually kinda relieved di didn't go, because i would
been going alone anyway, and prolly couldn't handle all that stress.) so i
don't know how it happened as i was saying, but i found myself sitting in front
of the stereo at 1am with my dad (gasp!) listening to my small collection of
dnb, mo wax, ninja tune, and warp stuff. he is in awe by dnb and has things to
say to everything i played him practically. so i told him about clubs and
hinted at raves, and he asked if ppl smoke weed in there (!), so i was like
'eh....you get illegal dealing stuff going on everywhere, at skool too, doesn't
mean you have to do it...'        the fact is that 'weed' in chinese has a
really bad conotation for me since i grew up with it. so i found myself almost
saying 'nah... i don't do.' that sorta stuff. but i guess i was just too
overwhlemed by my dad's welcome of the stuff i listen to. so now he wants me to
dub him yet another tape to play at work. so i chose him the mowax compilation;
hope he enjoys it tomorrow! hehehhee. we decided not to dub panacea, because
it's too dark and will drive away customers. but he digs panacea! ohmyfucking
gosh! my dad likes panacea. ok. i need to calm down............at last me and
my dad finds a common wavelength at dnb! wooo hooooo. who would guess, right?
bye! love-all. maybe see you sometime or another. can someone tell me about
phunkatech and space odyssey and audio impact (these are all 18+ places) and if
static is 18+ also. need to bring non-id friends. how are these places if i
wanna go alone.  i know no one who will go with me.........bleh.... see you
all. all these murder stuff freaks me out. be safe please. be gentle and kind
please. i don't know, but i never feel any warmth at the raves i've been too.
always a sort of coldness and detachment from others. so it could just because
i look so frightening like a monster, right?! right. have a feeling it mightbe
slightly better in calif. i guess ppl always have to uphold what their fashion
and apperance is holding them.

bye.

Er uh, The "Damn govt."  doesn't act on it's own.  The "Damn govt." is US,
period.  We lelect those fools who enbact those foolish laws.  If you do
not vote then you are even more at fault than the dummies who continue to
put these right wing constictive bastards into office.

I am pretty tired of lazy americans blaming an entity that consists of
thier choices for making decisions we elect them to make.  I wish lazy
Americans would take some responsibility for the freedoms we take for
granted and VOTE.  But we don;t so everything, including sex become illegal.

You don;t like the laws, vote.  You don;t like how cops act, vote, you
don;t like the govt.?  Vote.  For such a simple concept many just miss the
point of what it takes to sustain a democracy.

Oh well, I'm done.

Much peace,
John

Doh, I hope I don't get flammed I did not read this thread just yours
Rob. I understand what you are saying but everytime you pay Taxes to
the Gov. You are supporting Violent/Criminial activity. Not to mention
Pure straight up Waist. I saw the New Ronald Regan building on CNN and
he told congress that it would cost about 6 Million Dollars it Turns
out the Building will cost like 30 or so million and guess who pays
for this wast. You got it, me cause I am middle class and pay the most
taxes not Rich people. Sorry I am getting on track..

Peace,
Macadio

Why don't we start using metal detectors at parties? I wouldn't mind being
checked if I knew it would prevent someone from getting hurt. Or at least
help decrease the possibilities of someone getting injured by a metal
object.

That is the first thing that popped in my head... we're paying for some

metal detectors at UG parties or massives? massives i can understand
because of the amount of people attending.. but i think i think
there's more of an "i trust you not to hurt anyone" at the UG parties.
sometimes it seems like the UG parties have more of a family close
knit kind of thing.

anyways i just won a runners up prize for a photo contest. seven rolls
of film. why seven, i don't know :) but i sure will be taking a lot of
b/w pictures at jeremy and aaron's *In The Beginning* beach party. so
everyone please be there with all your beautiful smiles kay?

>No MIDI pretty much defines "toy" in my mind.

Tell that shit to Mr. Moog you dumb ass... So What you are getting at is
that all synths that predate MIDI are toys??? Moogs are toys? ARPs are
toys? Prophet 5s are toys? PolyKorgs are toys?Roland System series are
toys? Junos, Jupiters, sh-xxxxs are toys? Get a grip you small minded
little toad??? We won't even get into the x0x boxes here...Oh
wait....hmmmmm...what about the 909??? it has MIDI...is it automatically
elevated from toy status....oh good.... i'm glad to know that such a
ridiculous function elevates things from toy status....We couldn't expect
you to understand the ideas behind CV/Gate now could we????How about Pulse
24 or any other proprietary sync system??? How about analog
sequencers???What about a guitar or a saxaphone??? a drum??? the human
voice??? hey everyone...we are all toys because we don't have MIDI ports...
Get a grip and think before you speak. You only reveal the limited scope of
your thoughts...




 That's good enough for me, and if
>it's not good enough for you (that's you mr "cathode" -- even though

uhhhhhhhh....let us see....hmmmmmmm....could it be.....my girlfriend's

matters in this situation...Think before you speak you wart.....

P.S. I know that I am probably going to be attacked for the wording of this
post but before firing lease read that which initiated this response and
see the personal attacks that were launched against me just because i
defend a certain synth...Please remember that Neils has absolutly no clue
as to who I am or what I am about...

I mix on Pioneer CDJ-500mkII's w/ an Pioneer M-500 mixer. These are the
best DJ mixing decks that were available back when I purchased them in
April '96. There may be other good ones out now, such as the new high
end Vestax. Don't get anything by Denon, Gemini, Numark, GLI, etc. They
suck, IMHO.

Assuming you have (1) pitch control, (2) some way of quickly phase
aligning your tracks (e.g. a jog-dial like on the 500mkII's), (3) a
precise way of  setting cue points, and the ability to instantly start
playing back as soon as you hit and hold the cue-button or the play
button... if you have all these capabilities, you're good to go. if
not, you probably will be struggling w/ cd mixing forever.

Although you can try to beat match by "getting lucky" w/ two tracks
that are speed-matchined, you still need to "phase match", that is, get
the 1-beat's aligned. this is best done with a precision cue-up, like
they teach you in college radio broadcasting. 'cept you're doing it on
cd's (well, back when i did college radio, it was done w/ LP's only).

Best thing to do is carefully cue up by running the cd through a few
measures (i do this w/ the jog-wheel, much like you'd do by manually
rotating vinyl). Find the one. Then Set the cue point at that point
(usually, a drum hit).

when you hear the "one" on the playing track, hit and hold the cue
button, listening on the monitor headphones. as soon as the tracks
start trainwrecking, figure out which one is faster, and adjust the
non-playing track's speed. then hit and hold the cue button again on
the next "one" from the playing track. repeat speed adjustment as
needed. 

when you can play both tracks in synch for about as long as you want to
do your crossfade, hit-and-hold the cue button for a few measures to
get your timing just right (rehearse), then with the same tempo, hit
the play button, which will start your track at the cue point. then hit
the cross-fader and off you go.

Later, if you want to start getting fancy, you can start listening for
clashing bass-lines, and, for example, kill the bass (via EQ) on the
non-playing track and bump it up as you pull out the playing track.

PS: don't let the vinyl wankers start telling you that you can't
possibly beat match w/ CD's. They're all full of shit. However, you
can't beat-match well unless you have a decent CD-players. Even though
CD DJ mixers have been out for a few years, the pioneers where the
first product that didn't suck.

I've run into this too, a lot.  I think it's mostly just when you're alone...
I have been treated with much more heart when I've been with friends.  I find
that going to a commercial party by myself is about the most miserable thing
possible, unless I run into someone I know.

I've just moved out here to do a 2 month stint at JavaSoft; anyone else who's
new in the area (or old) that would like to do something this weekend, drop me
a note and we'll get a crew together!

And who do we vote for, the demipublicans, or the republicrats?  

"I'm voting for the puppet on the left."
"I'm voting for the puppet on the right."
"Hey, it's the same guy holding up both puppets!"
"Shut up, American Gladiators is on!..."
-- Bill Hicks

All real positive change in this country has come through direct action:
womens right to vote, the civil rights movement, the free speech movement,
the 12 hour day, the ten hour day, the eight hour day, the end of child
labor, the right to strike, limitations on certain murderous government
foreign policies, government support for the poor.

These victories, some enormous and some small, came through much struggle
and much bloodshed, not by voting in new politicians.

Drug related:  the issue of legalizing marijuana is not in the forefront of
california politics because the politicains we elected put it there.

Rave related:  there are lessons in this for the rave community.  Cities
like San Fran are trying to outlaw our activies.  We will be helpless unless
we organize.  Organizing can help us focus on what our legal rights are, to
inform current and potential organizers how to avoid the authorities, and
can act as a springboard to spread the word on the positive and life
affirming aspects of raves which are so often ignored or distorted in the media.

Minds open, arms open, smiles wide.

Peace food and hug bombz,
Kerry

Just a thought, not directed at any one in particular....
When mentioning a party on a public forum such as sfraves,
wouldn't it be good to leave out specific details such as
the exact location of the party, map point, etc...? 
There are _very_ few sites that we can throw parties at
in the city, and the last thing we need to do is advertise 
where they are.... (at least that's what i think)...

I mean, instead of saying, i went to 'Lolli-Pops & Hugzzz!!!'
at 1138 Mission St., with a map point at 227 Front St....
one could say, I went to 'Lolll-Pops & Hugzzz!!!' and had
a great time. It was somewhere in San Francisco, blah blah blah...

Am I completely out of line?

Butthead??? 

This country's government is pretty corrupt Niels. Wether you choose to
believe it or not. If you think our government is as squicky clean as
portrayed on TV then you've got the wool pulled over your eyes.  

And I would appreciate it if you would have replied to me on this instead
of the entire list. Especially since you referred to be as Butthead. What
was the point of that? People have names for a reason.

wow four years in student congress debating over tax issues, marijuana
issues, immigrant issues, curfew law issues, crime issues, frekkin
ebonic issues, chickensht issues, and i've come to the hypothesis that
the only way you can convince people is if you know what the hell
you're talking about and not just from your point of view but how to
refute everyone elses little insipid comments. "politicians suck."
"well why do you feel that way?" "uuuhhh, cause they just do!" 

i'm getting tired of political issues, not just the governments but
this whole rave thing too. location permits, safety issues and costs,
greedy promoters yadda yadda yadda yadda i just want to sit in the
corner in a state of om as deepfog spins some crazy wacked out ambient
waaa-oowww waaa-ooww and forget all this "i don't agree with you i
think i'm right and you're wrong i'm not going to listen to you you
suck you're stupid you're narrowminded BLAHBLAHBLAHBLAHBLAH" 

um as you can tell, i'm a bit stressed out from all these posts. i
thought i could escape politics.. but it's gonna be everywhere where
there are people who just won't agree and where there's animosity
there will be flames.
i think i will be taking a breathe from sfraves for a while.

okay i'm unsubscribing now. 
oh before i leave...
see this flame
see this flame getting bigger and bigger
see veann
see superveann
see superveann with this big bucket of water
see superveannn throw this bucket of water at all you flamethrower.
"hey baby, you're all wet"

buh bye take care!

veann :)

BTW: this isn't directed at anything Niels P. Mayer said, sorry
sweetie :) just a comment about all these sfrave posts and such

I mix on Pioneer CDJ-500mkII's w/ an Pioneer M-500 mixer. These are the
best DJ mixing decks that were available back when I purchased them in
April '96. There may be other good ones out now, such as the new high
end Vestax. Don't get anything by Denon, Gemini, Numark, GLI, etc. They
suck, IMHO.

Assuming you have (1) pitch control, (2) some way of quickly phase
aligning your tracks (e.g. a jog-dial like on the 500mkII's), (3) a
precise way of  setting cue points, and the ability to instantly start
playing back as soon as you hit and hold the cue-button or the play
button... if you have all these capabilities, you're good to go. if
not, you probably will be struggling w/ cd mixing forever.

Although you can try to beat match by "getting lucky" w/ two tracks
that are speed-matchined, you still need to "phase match", that is, get
the 1-beat's aligned. this is best done with a precision cue-up, like
they teach you in college radio broadcasting. 'cept you're doing it on
cd's (well, back when i did college radio, it was done w/ LP's only).

Best thing to do is carefully cue up by running the cd through a few
measures (i do this w/ the jog-wheel, much like you'd do by manually
rotating vinyl). Find the one. Then Set the cue point at that point
(usually, a drum hit).

when you hear the "one" on the playing track, hit and hold the cue
button, listening on the monitor headphones. as soon as the tracks
start trainwrecking, figure out which one is faster, and adjust the
non-playing track's speed. then hit and hold the cue button again on
the next "one" from the playing track. repeat speed adjustment as
needed.

when you can play both tracks in synch for about as long as you want to
do your crossfade, hit-and-hold the cue button for a few measures to
get your timing just right (rehearse), then with the same tempo, hit
the play button, which will start your track at the cue point. then hit
the cross-fader and off you go.

Later, if you want to start getting fancy, you can start listening for
clashing bass-lines, and, for example, kill the bass (via EQ) on the
non-playing track and bump it up as you pull out the playing track.

PS: don't let the vinyl wankers start telling you that you can't
possibly beat match w/ CD's. They're all full of shit. However, you
can't beat-match well unless you have a decent CD-players. Even though
CD DJ mixers have been out for a few years, the pioneers where the
first product that didn't suck.

Unfortunately. . . 

I do believe the Cheif O' SF PoPo's was the big cheese in charge o' the
wonder-bust. I was there. I was sooo sad. As everyone else has mentioned,
Andy P and the Wonder crew did 110%-super-duper-job. The police were
uncontrolable. HOWEVER.... I think if the SFRaves community got together and
sent a couple detailed letters to the SFChronicle, or other media, exploiting
the unamerican ways o' the SFPolice. I mean, where the hell were the police
when homeboy(wasn't my homeboy, but he was a gang member-gangs-he he he,
silly lil' folks) got shot @ 3com????? Busting a good vibe party, cuz people
were thirsty, and gum got stuck in da carpet. 

I'm sorry, I'm rambling. I just heard that the SF Police Sergent or chief was
there. One or the other. A boss to the peace officers. Um, then there's the
Mayor. When's he gonna get his priorities strait. Raves are not SF's biggest
problems!!!! Hello!!!! 

Well, if anyone's serious about letting the public know how wierd things are
getting, lets collaborate. This is a family, right? ;-)

((Also.... I'm going to LA to check out the scene for my self this weekend.
I'm curious to see if the same good and bad things go on, as I'm sure they
do. I just wanna see for my self. I wander if the LA Police is smoking as
much crack as the SF Po Po's.))

Bye Bye--
I LOVE MY SF RAVES COMMUNITY!!!!!! LET'S KEEP IT TOGETHER!
Mad props to Wonder, again!

Totally agree :)...

We showed up earlier, and had the best time.  There were not many people
there, and it was just so nice to be able to hang out and enjoy that
beautiful spot.

I was surprised how few people came during the day.  That place is just
beyond words, and I think if any of you have a chance to go next time, you
should see it for yourself, and enjoy it as much as possible, not just come
for the party.

I didn't know many people, but that was good in a way, because it gave me a
chance to meet some of them.  Sometimes I like going to parties where you
feel lost, and there are not too many little cliques...

The best part of the weekend - Sunday morning - people still dancing to
good music, but you are actually able to see their faces, and almost
everybody is smiling :).  That's why I love outdoor parties, those magical
mornings, when you body is so tired, but you can't stop dancing....

>Awsome, Awsome, party.

Thanks F-8 crew, and to everybody who made this party so much fun....

What he isn't telling you here (because he obviously doesn't know any
better) is that they mostly SUCK under rave conditions. I've been mixing on
Pioneer CDJ-500's since 1995, and many of the experiences I've had/heard
playing at events has been one form of trouble or another. They're fine for
your studio, bedroom, or playing *small* renegades or clubnights... But
when you have to play on a larger/louder soundsystem, you're in for a ride
that doesn't always end happily.

I was actually unable to mix at a peak slot this very weekend, at an event
that I have been looking forward to for months, because the sound was loud
enough and bassy enough so that the CDJ's COULDN'T TRACK THE DISCS... I'm
standing there, with the CDJ's on perfectly levelled cinderblock stacks,
I'm ready to go on, and they won't even give me a fucking reading. I missed
my set because of them. I couldn't play. The conditions were pretty close
to optimal as far as the physical setup of the decks goes, the person who
rigged them has consulted with pioneer on the proper way to go about
this... It still didn't work. In order for me to have played, I would have
had to QUARTER the volume to get the CDJ's to track. Needless to say, I was
pissed...

I'm NOT a vinyl "wanker", as Neils says in his tiring childish arrogance.
The *point* is this: The 1200's stand up like mack trucks. It comes down to
craftsmanship. The CDJ's, and believe me I love them, are made rather
unsturdily. They are totally fragile, and they have a TON of things that
can all too easily go wrong on you. The loading doors on them wear out, the
lasing unit needs to be kept really clean, the buttons that control vital
functions wear out easily and lose contact... Essentially they are not
built to survive raves yet. I'd like to see the cd-dj's petition Technics
to make one as sturdy as the 1200's...

I've also seen them fuck up on other dj's as well, in a variety of
rave/club conditions. Once again, Neils doesn't seem to have any experience
other than his bedroom... And he passes off his knowledge with this
arrogance and rudeness that is somewhat sickening...

The other issue about them is this: (not mentioned probably due to a
further lack of experience)... You can hold a mix for longer (without
touching it) on the 1200's if you are good enough. The reason is because
the pitch adjustment on CDJ's is digital, and it counts only to one-tenth
decimal place. In other words, you can get either +6.5 or +6.6. If you
nudge it just right you can get it to waver between the two, but when
you're dealing with the milleseconds between what is "on" and "off" beat,
it isn't enough. You have to constantly keep one hand on them to compensate
for this. If Pioneer added one more decimal place (a hundredths point) it
might help a little. On a 1200, because it is not digital, you can get as
close as your patience, time and skill allows.

Wait a while on the CDJ's if you're planning to play events with larger
soundsystems, Pioneer just doesn't have the design worked out all that well
yet. I'm hopeful, because otherwise they are kickass machines, and a LOT of
fun to use. If you're hacking out your own tracks, the primary benefit is
that you can buy a CDR and mix your own "dubplates". Being digital, they
also sound fucking awesome, but when they skip, it's far worse than when a
record skips. For now, I'm going to start buying vinyl again. Ya just can't
trust 'em.

Subject: a few words about constructive posts and being nice by laura
 lamar and matt cantu
Sender: sfraves-owner@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

matt cantu and i are pals and co.workers who have noticed a mess o
dissention on this list lately and have the following advice to offer,
should you choose to accept it.....

o  please do not read every response to your posts as if it is a personal
attack on you.  just because someone's opinion is different than yours does
not mean that they are attacking you.  imagine if you will, laura and matt
hard at work at salinas.net.  laura gasps in exasperation as her mac
crashes for the umpteenth time in an hour, and she utters, "i hate macs."
matt hears this from his desk across the room and says, "oh yeah, well i
hate pcs!"  laura looks at matt in her fit of annoyance and snaps, "oh yeah
well i hate you!"  this sounds pretty ridiculous, does it not?  i mean the
fact matt likes macs and laura doesn't is no reason for laura not to like
matt.  she may not understand why he prefers macs over pcs, but his
preferences have not a whole lot to do with the matt laura knows as a
person, and simply because he may disagree with her on that particular
point does not mean he has something against her as human being.  not
everyone is going to agree.  please take the time to exercise some of the
_understanding_ and _respect_ so heavily dashed into the plur closing of
many of our emails....

o  think before you speak.  give yourself some time to cool off over
something that initially might have upset you.  "i have so many posts i
have never sent after cooling down [and re.reading them]."   we often will
respond to one little word that tacks itself onto our psyche and overlook
the entire meaning in a message as we are too fixated on that one word or
phrase which set us off.  please take the time to recognize that this is
something we all do and try to combat it.  it impacts the list and everyone
on it and it oftens leads threads completely astray and debases them into a
public flame war.

o  avoid name calling, even in jest.  a lot is lost in translation in
communication via email i.e. body language and voice inflection.  therefore
it is easy to misinterpret what may have been meant as a tongue in cheek
comment.  please "say what you mean and mean what you say"....also things
like this sucks and that sucks rarely do anyone any good.  rather than
blatently condemn something, maybe give another alternative to that
something.  for example, let's say matt and i are having a conversation
about mixers, and he suggests a numark.  if i didn't want us to reach some
sort of consensus on what our group wanted to buy, i might simply say,
"numarks suck for this reason and that reason and blah blah blah," but
since we both want to learn from the discussion so as to actually
accomplish something, i should say, "i don't like numarks because of the
cross fader but this pioneer looks kinda neat because i hear it's
crossfader is pretty solid and look at all of the channels on this thing!"

which brings me to another point:  are we trying to help eachother and
learn from eachother or are we trying to feed our own hungry egos by
one.upping and downsizing others?

just some stuff to think about.

love,
lola

>From Monday's edition of Salon:

The New York Times' reefer madness

 In a shocking article, the newspaper of record reveals that many Net users
     are deviating from officially mandated Just Say No drug rhetoric!

                              BY DANIEL RADOSH
                          -------------------------

Readers of the New York Times might assume that front page stories are
selected on the basis of newsworthiness. Occasionally, however, the paper
gives an article prominent play in order to advance a cultural agenda (or,
more cynically, to prove that it still has the clout to do so). Last month
the Times-manufactured fuss over heroin chic led all the way to a lip-biting
announcement from President Clinton.

Last Friday, the Times was at it again with an article headlined, "A
Seductive Drug Culture Flourishes on the Internet." To the paper's credit,
this topic is at least not hopelessly pass. It is even worthy of serious
coverage. But as with the heroin chic story, objective reporting here takes
a back seat to middlebrow fear-mongering. Given the confluence of two of
America's favorite boogeymen (drugs and the Internet -- together at last!),
there is no doubt that this too is a story with legs.

The article, by Christopher S. Wren, begins like this: "Even as parents,
teachers and government officials urge adolescents to say no to drugs ..."

Parents! Teachers! Government officials! Wren expeditiously establishes
societal order, then proceeds to shatter it, thus creating a sense of threat
that pervades the entire article.

"... the Internet is burgeoning as an alluring bazaar ..."

A bazaar! People are buying drugs over the Internet! Well, not quite. It
eventually becomes apparent that this bazaar mostly "sells" ideas. And the
occasional hemp baseball cap.

"... where anyone with a computer ..."

And a modem, of course, but Wren's on a roll here.

"... can find out how to get high on LSD, eavesdrop on what it is like to
take heroin or cocaine, check the going price for marijuana, or copy the
chemical formula for methamphetamine, the stimulant better known as speed."

Scary, huh? But it's hard to see how any of the above rates as "alluring."
Chemical formulas are no more seductive on the Web than they are in library
books (which, for the record, also contain such information). Checking the
price of marijuana is more likely to scare off the curious than anything
else ($400 an ounce? Are you fucking kidding me?). And as for "find[ing] out
how to get high on LSD": Um, take it, right?

The mood established, Wren goes on:

"Teen-agers need only retreat to their rooms, boot up the computer and click
on a cartoon bumblebee named Buzzy to be whisked on line ..."

People familiar with the Internet, of course, will know that one must
already be online before Buzzy appears. Indeed in order to find Buzzy, one
first must first do a search for something along the lines of "hemp, pot,
bong, wasted, dude," and then travel, of one's own volition, to the site
where Buzzy lives. The many millions of Times readers who are not Net savvy,
however, can be forgiven for picturing a scene like this: Little Tommy turns
on his computer for a relaxing game of Duke Nuke 'Em when he suddenly sees a
seductively alluring little bee. Out of curiosity, he clicks on it and is
whisked (whisked? on the Web?!) to ...

"... a mail-order house ..."

That's right, mail-order. Wren describes two sites that advertise books,
paraphernalia and, in one exceptional case, actual pot seeds, but he does
not make clear that you can't actually purchase this stuff online. Teenagers
who want their own hydroponics set-up can get an address off the Web, but
then they must unretreat from their rooms, find stamps, write a check and so
on, just as if they'd gotten the info from the back of Rolling Stone. Wren
acknowledges that drug chat on the Web "would be nothing new to a high
school or college bull session, but face-to-face contact can help
adolescents evaluate a speaker's credibility. The anonymity of on-line
discussion, in contrast, tends to make even outlandish statements seem
credible to impressionable young eavesdroppers." I won't deny that folks can
be way too gullible about what they read online, but my own experience is
that plugged-in youngsters are far less impressionable than novice adults
(hello, Pierre Salinger).

But that's a hallmark of this type of article: the claim that the Internet
is inherently more persuasive than it should be. Sort of how people once
feared that flashing "drink Coca-Cola" between frames at the Saturday
matinee would drive audiences trancelike to the refreshment stand. "We
really are witnessing the development of the most powerful medium that has
ever existed, in terms of its ability to attract and interest young people,"
asserts Jeff Chester of the Center for Media Education. "It's more powerful
than television ... because it is interactive," confirms anti-drug activist
David Rosenbloom.

The Web is more engrossing than TV? What are you, high? For balance, Wren
quotes HotWired's Jon Katz, who makes a similar point but without the
ominous spin.

To prove that online drug pushers are targeting young people, Wren points to
a combination of "glitzy" graphics and "a sassiness that leaves sober
arguments against drug use looking pallid." Something sober looks pallid?
Get outta here!

"One clue to adolescence on the Internet," continues Wren, "is the
prevalence of cartoons in praise of marijuana." Or maybe that's just a clue
to the psychological adolescence of potheads of all ages. Check out the two
examples that accompany Wren's article. In one, three Freak Brothers
rip-offs cavort beside bubble letters that read, Jerry Brownishly, "Why
ain't we the people free to grow our own?" In the other, a Popeye look-alike
named "Pot-Peye" smokes his spinach, while Bluto says, "Ya'know Pot-Peye, I
can, like, dig your beautiful headspace, man!" Tell me these gems are aimed
at anyone under 45.

The article's final section is titled, "A Vast Warehouse of Misinformation."
Wren is horrified to find a chat room in which "When a man asked whether it
was safe to mix methamphetamine with alcohol ... a seasoned user named Durto
assured him, 'Yeah, you can drink on speed, and drink and drink.'" Maybe I'm
sharper than the average would-be speed freak, but those extra two drinks
suggest to me that Durto is being sarcastic. Did Wren intentionally misplace
a ;-) somewhere?

I wouldn't put it past him. Consider the part where he writes that "the
Internet also abounds in casual advice like the 'suggestions for first-time
users' of 'ecstasy,' a hallucinogenic stimulant that has been found to
damage the brains of monkeys ... Nicholas Saunders, the author of these
suggestions, cautioned ecstasy neophytes only to 'avoid alcohol and other
drugs, and if you are dancing, realize that you may be dangerously
overheated even without feeling uncomfortable.'"

Hey, that's pretty good advice, and far more likely to make an impression on
a determined raver than a lecture about simian research. But Wren wants us
to gasp: The stuff causes brain damage and Saunders' only warning is about
dancing?

But that's not his only warning. Saunders goes into extensive detail about
the brain-damage research, as well as the possibilities of kidney and liver
damage, heart trouble, strain on the immune system and much more. None of
this, by the way, is presented with any graphics, sass or "interactivity,"
although there are hundreds of footnotes. In fact, Saunders' pro-ecstasy
treatise is quite scholarly -- pallid, even. It may be 90 percent bullshit,
but it's disingenuous of Wren to call it "casual" and imply that it's
designed to entice kids. Hell, I could barely slog through one chapter.

In and of itself, I'm not too concerned that one New York Times article is
trumped up. The buzz-kill is that once the rest of the media-political
culture jumps on this story, it's going to make the original piece seem
downright reasonable. Look for a concerned, clueless proclamation from the
president any day now.

it is certainly a personality thing. . . any time you are giving off
happy, comfortable vibes, you're more likely to receive them in return.
my problem is when I go to a party in a *great* mood and my grins are
reciprocated by scowls from packs of overdressed kids who look more like
a tommy hilfiger advertisment than a group of people having fun.

you're right-on-target about working to be accepted, though: if I felt
more comfortable in my situation I would probably be capable of approaching
a group and saying hello, etc, but that has resulted in my feelings being
hurt in Florida and the midwest on several occasions, so lacking
a real solid foundation in this area I'm reluctant to risk having my only
social encounters be negative ones.  [I'm out here on a 2 month internship,
and I don't know anyone out here.]

that said, I will make it out to an event shortly and will be trying my
hardest to be an extrovert!

I totally agree with you, Dan. However, there are times when someone needs an info line or directions, etc.  What happens then??  Does this also include map points and places where we sell pre-sales?  What, on the list, would be Rave related then? And how do ppl. get the info they are looking for? I'm just being the devil's advocate right now. =) 

Much love and caution,
Julie

I've already gotten a few private responses about my previous post, so I'll
share this with everyone else...

The negative feedback could and should have been left out of my previous
message. A negative action does not help or assist negative action, but
rather furthers the downward spiral. It stemmed from an irritation over a
range of posts, but in essence I responded arrogantly to arrogance. Thanks
to those who took a moment to point this out to me. Even though someone
else might be acting like a complete ass, returning the favor is not in our
collective best interest. My apology is for adding to the pollution, I'll
work on my end.

I mix on Pioneer CDJ-500mkII's w/ an Pioneer M-500 mixer. These are the
best DJ mixing decks that were available back when I purchased them in
April '96. There may be other good ones out now, such as the new high
end Vestax. Don't get anything by Denon, Gemini, Numark, GLI, etc. They
suck, IMHO.

Assuming you have (1) pitch control, (2) some way of quickly phase
aligning your tracks (e.g. a jog-dial like on the 500mkII's), (3) a
precise way of  setting cue points, and the ability to instantly start
playing back as soon as you hit and hold the cue-button or the play
button... if you have all these capabilities, you're good to go. if
not, you probably will be struggling w/ cd mixing forever.

Although you can try to beat match by "getting lucky" w/ two tracks
that are speed-matchined, you still need to "phase match", that is, get
the 1-beat's aligned. this is best done with a precision cue-up, like
they teach you in college radio broadcasting. 'cept you're doing it on
cd's (well, back when i did college radio, it was done w/ LP's only).

Best thing to do is carefully cue up by running the cd through a few
measures (i do this w/ the jog-wheel, much like you'd do by manually
rotating vinyl). Find the one. Then Set the cue point at that point
(usually, a drum hit).

when you hear the "one" on the playing track, hit and hold the cue
button, listening on the monitor headphones. as soon as the tracks
start trainwrecking, figure out which one is faster, and adjust the
non-playing track's speed. then hit and hold the cue button again on
the next "one" from the playing track. repeat speed adjustment as
needed.

when you can play both tracks in synch for about as long as you want to
do your crossfade, hit-and-hold the cue button for a few measures to
get your timing just right (rehearse), then with the same tempo, hit
the play button, which will start your track at the cue point. then hit
the cross-fader and off you go.

Later, if you want to start getting fancy, you can start listening for
clashing bass-lines, and, for example, kill the bass (via EQ) on the
non-playing track and bump it up as you pull out the playing track.

PS: don't let the vinyl wankers start telling you that you can't
possibly beat match w/ CD's. They're all full of shit. However, you
can't beat-match well unless you have a decent CD-players. Even though
CD DJ mixers have been out for a few years, the pioneers where the
first product that didn't suck.

does anyone know if the stabbings were inside or outside of the party?
apparently, there was a hip-hop house party a block away that also got
violent - maybe it happened there or inbetween. . .

I have a 6 megabyte MPEG2 Audio compressed file available on my web
page.  It is a five minute, stereo track I did using all analogue synths.
If you have the time or the bandwidth, I would really apperciate it if
you could take a listen and give me feedback:

Where, oh where, does one even *begin* to address the depth of ignorance
as evinced in this post?

I don't think I'll even try, but hats off to chris for being so very
shallow, bating, and ignorant on so very many different levels.  

I'm impressed.  And i mean that in the worst possible way.

Hey chris, why don't *you* start here for beginners:

A request to pick your brains....

I'm an agent in San Francisco.  I represent a wide array of
talent.(www.whomodels.com) I'm thinking about opening my scope of
representation to dance music DJ's.

>From XLR8, I've seen that there are a few companies doing this already.
(Bay Area??)  More or less managing DJ's. I think I would like to work
on bringing local DJ's to a different level....now what that means? I
really don't know....I'd like some input on the following:

~~is there a need?
~~do the DJ's want it or do they like to do it all themselves?
~~how would I obtain contacts to make it worthwhile for them?
~~any other comments/suggestions/input etc...that would help in making a
decision about this!!

Thanks so much!!

in a PLURy mood....
:-) Melissa

i wasn't trying to be negative or unreasonable....it's just that
things have been getting worse lately.

so......with that said.....

my suggestion......instead of posting the address, try posting a/the
phone number.  if this is not an option...then send each other
personal e-mails with all of the info in it, but just don't make it
"public" knowledge.

and as far as stuff like pre-sale locations and the like...well...i
think that those are obviously ok.....just use your common sense.

this is not directed at u julie......i like u and everyone else on
here....these are just my suggestions about something that i believe
to be very important.

bottom line: do everything possible to keep addresses and other
"sensitive" information from going to the WHOLE list.

thanks....

I think you are absolutly right,*smile* and we should all be very careful, about how much info we post on the list.  We can keep our scene alive, we just have to stay a step ahead of the rest.

Ok, so what's so shallow, bating, and ignorant about that one sentence?
Are you suggesting that Oakland is a safe neighborhood?  Do you deny
Oakland is a desperate, gritty, VIOLENT place?  Have you ever lived there?
The only offensive language I see here is the unfortunate use of the word
darkest in conjunction with violence.  Not the best choice of allusions
(The woods are silent, dark and deep, and I have promises to keep, and
miles to go before I sleep...)

I just thought I'd you know, try to keep up with the general
level of intelligent, interesting, pertinent posts lately by saying:

I really like Oakland quite a lot.  I think it's a very cool place mostly.
there are parts that aren't so good, but in general, I thought you all
would like to know that I like Oakland.  Or maybe I just want to get
emails sent to me that I wrote and say, damn, he's smooth, I bet everyone
is fascinated by what he's saying.

I think perhaps hyperreal would get an award from me if they could house
the sfraves calender, the sfraves message/info list, and the sfraves,
really painfully repetetive and boring list.

This rubbish reminds me of like Model United Nations, or Junior Statesmen
of America conferences from HS.  If you let them speak, they will repeat.
If you let them repeat, everyone will.  And nothing new will be said.  But
at least everyone gets a chance.

But I was talking about the CDJ-500mkII, which wasn't released until
early 1996. I bought the first batch i could get retail in April '96,
so either you're full of shit, confused, lying, or both. The CDJ-500 
was a glorified karaoke box, which was never intended for DJ use, so it
certainly can't stand up to loud volume.

perfectly levelled doesn't mean anything for CD players. cinderblock
doesn't mean anything. it's compliance PLUS mass. if you're short on
either one, your sound will suck. on turntables, it'll just give you
that muddy distorted bass (caused by feedback) that drives the kids
wild. i'd rather use an equalizer or compression or both if i want that
effect.

it's no big magic to get your sound isolated. except if you're a
fawning 1200-worhipping wanker that thinks the fabled glorified
boat-anchor was built by aliens that had deep mystical knowledge of the
intricacies of low-fi sound reproduction. sorry -- it's 20-40 year old
technology, no big shit. the 1200's are heavy and on big springy/damped
feet in order to be compliant. if you feel like hauling around  bricks
and sponge, you can make isolation that's just as good for any CD
mixer.  But I personally enjoy the increased portability of the
CDJ500mkII+mixer in a single roadcase that can be carried by a single
person. the bricks and sponge can be carried in a separate load.

Sounds like you still are. Well don't take it out on me and my opinion,
especially because you weren't prepared. and you can pull that corncob
out now, it's now  ripe n' saucy and ready to eat.

>I'm NOT a vinyl "wanker", as Neils says in his tiring childish arrogance.
>The *point* is this: The 1200's stand up like mack trucks. It comes down to

Yeah, 1200's do great out in the desert at burning man. they do great
when the wind is blowing the cart around, do great when tweaked out
ravers bump the tables lightly... and the vinyl does great to with all
the sand and grit and cigarette smoke.

no problems so far.

> lasing unit needs to be kept really clean

never cleaned it. it has protective covers that cover the lenses as
soon as you open the unit. i guess you're talking about a different
unit, like the original CDJ500, which was a karaeoke unit.

No problems here either.

> And he passes off his knowledge with this
>arrogance and rudeness that is somewhat sickening...

Um. who's being rude here? I think you're being a perfect ass, and not
even giving the oringal poster any information or answers, just a bunch
of puffery about how pathetically experienced  you are because you
can't understand the  elementary high-school physics behind sound
isolation (hey, if he gets to be a snotty wank, i do too).

i guess you need the knobs to go up to 11 on your mixer to make it
louder too?

just because the display doesn't have umpteen digits of precision doesn't
mean the linear potentiometer that controls the speed doesn't have higher
resolution. i know i can get between the "digits" on the readout. 

 ....

Whatever.  I'm sure something better will come out in the future, it
always does. I posted an opinion based on my observations. Take it or 
leave it. I didn't notice you saying anything other than what a
lame-ass sucker you are for not being able to spin in your timeslot
because you weren't prepared, that and a bunch of factually incorrect
and stupid non-information.

Huh??? I usually don't get involved with things like this, but you all
need to chill out. He lived in Oakland and had a bad experience. You
lived in Oakland and didn't. SO WHAT. There is nothing at all racist
implied in his comment.Are you saying 'deepest darkest' has a rascist
overtone? I really don't think it is based on the context. He feels
raves are more dangerous in Oakland? That's his opinion.

Ok punk ass!  Since I was given next weeks Lunch Duty.... ;)

I guess I'll keep it on Tuesday, and if I can get some suggestions
on what kind of foods people like I might be able to narrow a place
down that everyone will be happy with.

Wow, look at all the Chris's's!  For the record,  
Chris <lsavage@uclink4.berkeley.edu> called Oakland dark and deep, which I
HOPE wasn't a racial slur... 

I, Chris Porter <cporter@exploretech.com> didn't see any racial slur and
thought it silly that someone would get flamed for saying Oakland is a
typical depressed inner city, with typically depressing inner city
problems.  I went on to say I lived there and hated it, but then again I
have a basis for comparison...

Chris Antoine <chris@lettuce.salinas.net>  Was offended at a perceived
racial slur by the first Chris and demands an apology.

 I bet this is all for nothing and the first Chris is guilty of nothing
more than a slip of the finger...but I've never met him....

Third Chris, It'd be neat to hear what you like about living in Oakland,
I've always wondered how someone could live there and not feel the tension
in the air... 

Please Please Please lets not let this degenerate into a silly flame war...

---ChrisP  The 2nd Chris...

Chris,

First, I was born in San Francisco.  While I've never lived in Oakland, I
have been there many times over the years and am familiar with the area.

Second, the URL i sent you (which i see you didn't bother checking) 
connects you to a PDF document that contains statistics for crimes
reported for selected California jurisdictions.  Oakland and San Francisco
are two of those jurisdictions. 

For 1995 and 1996, Oakland actually has fewer reported homicides and lower
FBI & California Crime indices then San Francisco.  Oakland also
experienced about a 30% reduction in homicide ('95 vs '96) vs. a 15%
homicide reduction in SF. 

Do these numbers not make Oakland a violent place?  Of course not.  But
they do serve to put Oakland's violence in some perspective, which I felt
your one sentence was sorely lacking.

Third, I think "unfortunate use of the word darkest..." is a gross
understatement of the way you chose to describe Oakland.  You're obviously
well aware of the historical significance of "deepest, darkest...", and it
has nothing to do with robert frost.

If you meant to allude to frost's poem, say so; it's your job as writer to
take responsibility for your own words and how people are going to
interpret them.  It'd be clear to me that my audience would be making
racial associations with that phrase, not poetic ones.

Finally, you've obviously had a genuinely bad experience with Oakland, and
I'm truly sorry about your paper boy.  That's not anything that anyone
should have to go though, and i mean that.  It is not, however, an excuse
to make vast generalizations about an entire metropolis or parties that
happen there.

 maybe i'm the only one of us three that 
understands the history of this reference.
"The Great White Hunter on a safari into 
deepest, darkest Africa". Do you think that 
this means that the sun does not shine there?
I think not. The original ref. points to SKIN TONE

First and foremost we would like to say hello and thank you to everyone
who came to ORIGIN. Also a big thanks to the entire ORIGIN family and
you know who you are, for all the hard work and dedication that was put
into the Summer Solstice celebration. The party was beautiful and the
music was incredible. Alot of good people just enjoying each other and
sharing positive feelings.

Rumors get started and then escalate through misinformation,
miscommunication and wild imagination. Find the TRUTH, the real TRUTH,
people who care take it upon themselves to search for the real facts
through logic, common sense, a clear mind and
communication. Jumping to conclusions without knowing the truth is
unnecessary and harmful. Don't get involved in idle gossip and rumours.

The truth about what happened at ORIGIN is as follows. According to eye
witnesses and the official report made by the officer on site, the two
men involved in the incident were not patrons of the event but rather
outsiders who snuck into the party. They were displaying aggressive
behaviour and fighting amongst themselves. They eventually hurt each
other and they were immediately taken to first aid and then transported
to the hospital where they were treated and sent home in a matter of
hours.

THERE WERE NO DEATHS !!!!! There were no other incidences at the party.
We live in a real world and there are people out there who through their
own life experience have learned to communicate in a certain way. It is
sad to see that these two people settled their differences in this
manner.

Thanks to everyone for their concern. Peace to you all!

I've never heard that before...  Where is that from? I thought it was a
reference to deep dark woods, a scary place... I guess we'll have to wait
for the Chris-who-made-the-original-reference to clear this up.

Until then..
I'm out!

Just thought I'd reforward to the list because many many many people will
by now be sick of the thread and not even read the post.  I wanted to put
the message in the topic so the widest audience would be able to see that
there were not actually deaths at the party.  Does it make a huge
difference if people know that part of the truth or not?  I just wanted to
make sure.
peace all,
Max

	This is kind of personal thing of mine, but why does everyone have
to go pointing fingers all over the place under the guise of "taking
responsiblity for one's words". There is this thing called communication,
and maybe if people backed off for a second and took the time to check on
the meaning they are inferring from the words we use, we might get to some
common ground at some point in our lives... Point being there is no way in
hell that one is going to know how everyone if going to interpret their
words, and over the form of email, the number of inferences people
can/will make grows exponetially...
	I didn't know some of the references that seem to have come out of
the line in question, but I think people are a bit high strung when they
demand an apology without even verifying that they got the correct
meaning. Such an assumption shows some level of disrespect in my book as
there was no room for the possiblity that the original poster did not have
malicious intentions.
	On the other hand, there has been discussions which people know
that the language they are using is going to be taken a concern way and
they continued to use trying to imply that there was nothing wrong with
it. After being flamed heavy, they still maintained that there was nothing
wrong with the language they were using and they would continue to use,
which I think shows a level of complete disrespect...
	I don't know, people seem to be so argumentative over who is going
to make an effort these days (myself included as gem might point out)...
Maybe we need something to happen that MAKES us all do real work for a
little while...

    I was lookin through the Magaziene section at Barnes and Noble Today when
I came across the latest issue of URB mag. I have read the mag before but
this time i noticed something in the pictures~ It seems that there are a lot
more of those cute little CandyRavers in the LA pics than the SF pics. The
kids at the LA parties were dancin around the DJ stand, the SF kids were
standin there watchin. I'm wondering why this is. It had me puzzled. It
always makes me smile at partys when i see someone all dressed up in their
funky-ist of gear, coated in glitter and stickers, with a smile bigger than
the moon. But we arn't all like that some of us go for whats comfy, and some
don't have time to change after werk, i know my problem is i can't afford all
the fun stuff. but why is it thet they seem to be more prevelent in LA than
SF? I guess i'll have to go down there and check it out hunh?

So thrusday night we packed up the car, made food, remembered to put water
in the freezer to be transformed into block ice and eventually got on the
road in the usual late routine. Stopped to pick up a couple friends and
drove out to one site in the Sierra Foothills. Had to take a sleep break
before getting there because no one was awake enough to drive...

Two to three hours of odd sleep in the drivers seat and I am just about ok
to drive... So we continue on as the sun rises over the mountains. Finally
we pull in early Friday morning to two stands of scaffolding already setup
and people waking up (to the sounds of one small dog barking of course).
We could hear people wandering around (sticks breaking under feet in the
woods, laughter from another front of trees) and the breeze ffffffing thru
the tall pines. Set up the tent and get some sleep (only to be awakened by
intense heat reminscent of black rock, and slowly coming to and deciding
we needed to put up a shade for the mid afternoon sun). Lounge the day
away after a little work. Tried to make it to the waterfall but the
directions were not quite right, and we ended up heading down to a little
stream where I sat throwing sticks for the small barking dog listening to
three people bathing in the distance while the trees went
ffffffooooooooooooooo and gem leaned against my back. On the way out we
noticed the tailpipe of the van got squashed a bit when we went over the
logs and up the steep hill so I played with a rachet and wrench for a few
minutes to open it up. We got back just as evening falls... Some friends
start playing tablas and sitar and digis but it didn't go quite as was
hoped I believe. Then some ambient on the little system....  Some djs are
still missing and the live acts are either experiencing gear problems or
not up yet either, no bother....

Then the big generator gets fired up as darkness descends thru the pines. 
The fffffffff soound gives way to a lllloooooowwww rumble as the two
blocks of EV MT sound refernece decide to join us for the night. The fire
gets lit so a few people can cook food wrapped in foil. We sit listening
to ambient crystal clear at ~100 feet (thru pines as well). People come
back from the cliffs which are separated by another stand of trees with
reports that they could hear the music crystal clear out there as well... 
We cut up some more wood for the fire as more people arrive. Then thru the
trees a glow rises and the lights have been turned on and are scanning the
trees with radiant colors (dichromic I believe was the word someone used
to describe the colors which means something in chemistry to me, but I
don't know if that means the use chromium compounds to get those colors
though it looked like it)... And then the music gets harder and more
people show up and the music gets harder and the fog machine fills the
meadow with mist and the music gets harder. Then the gabber comes on just
as a few more friends show up (hurray) and goes on and people dance and
the lights go and I wish there were a few more people dancing (maybe 10),
and then some trance and head to the fire to talk for a little as the
music doesn't keep me going... Then a while latter, the music changes and
oh joy, it gabber girl, Warrior princess playing hard and most silly music
so I get to dance with about about 20 other people while the other dave
comes bouncing out in only a way that that dave could without bringing to
mind all the flak I hear about gabber in san fransisco... Somewhere in
here UV-99 shows up and they are talking about their plans for the next
day...

The gabber ends and I talk a little bit and then head to bed and sleep til
the afternoon (the tarp over the tent worked wonders). So gem and I were
out and about with a little barking dog for most of saturday. Walked all
over talking to people, listening to music, out to the cliffs with the
little barking dog and gem. Got the correct directions to the waterfall,
but driving wasn't really an option. So I sat around listening to thee
trees, watching people try to level the big truck and hang scrims. And
then go about making foods...

And then night fell, and the big speakers turned on, and then the
projectors turned on, and then the cyberlights came on, and then the
strobes came on, and then the lazer was turned on and out in the trees
there was clear loud music, about 50 people dancing (maybe more I am bad
with numbers), and a bunch by the fire (why do people like to sit around
the fire at night instead of dancing? But to each their own)... I missed
greg's set and I missed Dan efex's set, bt the rest of the music was
really good - in fact it was the best party musically I have been to in a
long long... All pretty hard and driving though it went with most of the
crowd that was up there with yells galour.

So sunday things started to get broken down. We made some coffee for those
that were around, had some soup and sandwiches. helped to clean up the
horrid mess that was the communal kitchen area, retrieved my contributions
to it (oops, I just realized that the plywood we brought up to use as a
food prep table got left up there), started packing up the car, talked
with people, yelled for shango, talked with people, wished the barking dog
would let other people come close to me without barking at them, listened
to the wind in the trees, broke down the speakers, woke shango up for the
keys which ended up being in the igition to the big truck, knocked the
grounding rods out of the ground (3 feet of copper likes to stick in the
ground), then got to tag with gabber girl which is the first time I have
had someone to tag with it was a lot of fun...

So Trust's first big party went off pretty well though they lost a LOT of
money as it seems that the tickets that went out didn't really get paid
for, which is kind of frustating as the ticket pocily was very laid back,
with everyone involved (whether working, spinning, or coming up to dance
and lend a hand when they saw it could be lended) contributing to the
finacial side of the party...

Anyway, I enjoyed myself, the party was very well put together (except
for the problems with the Pioneer CDJ units ;) ) and I would like to make
more of these happen in the future...

And who speaks for you when you don't vote?  religous fanatics, racists,
and every other fringe element who has gotten plenty of change and

Look there are plenty of people out there that will listen.  They may not
win, but at least you shouldn;t give up and be coerced into not voting.
Leaving our fate to the LEAST TOLERANT elemetns of our society.  They
certainly do vote.

And this bunk about there being no choice?  Bullshit...there are plenty of
choices, you excersize NONE of them by not voting and leave your fate to
those that most certainyl will.  Like people in Idaho or Iowa deciding what
is right for you as a Bay Area resident.  You like that?  I sure as hell
don't.

We all play a part.  I would rahter playu an active part.  Those who do not
vote, in my opinion are not only throwing our democracy out the window, but
are throwing ANY chance of change out as well.  Short of the gun, something
most of you don;t own, this is the only way we can make a difference.

Rise to the challenge and don't let right wingers decide your fate.

Vote for your favorite puppet, or else someone will vote for thiers, and
often enough it has been proven, to be someone who has ill-will toward the
non-vocal minority.  Witness Germany for one.

Americans are a really sad lot.  We got handed all of this, and with few
exceptions, rarely excersize the one true peaceful way to change things.
Do you think that if everyone voted last year that we would be fighting for
the renters credit in CA?  No, but the landlords voted and guess what, that
shit is in peril.  All the while people making a silent protest of
abstinence, while others eat up our rights and spit them back at us as
restrictive laws.

The choice has always been yours.

Tired of the cops?  Vote for someone who  will stand up for your rights.
tired of high rents, vote for rent control.  tired of lame ass drug laws,
get a petition signed and vote.  Does anyone see that change is taking
place, albeit not in our favor?  Why, because vocal, money-grubbing
minority takes every chance they can get to make sure they are heard.  And
have things changed?  You bet they have, against us, the little people, and
for THEM the right.

All of those struggles were for the right to elect a politician, to partake
in the democratic process.  I think you misunderstand these movements
entirely I modestly suggest.  Before people had a say only the rich would
vote, and they were white men who could give a fuck about women or people
of color.

W/o voting, NONE of the things you mentioned would have become realities.
Even Ghandi understood this, as well as Malcolm X and MArtin Luther King.
The right to vote is essential for peaceful change.  That is unless you are
ready to pick up a gun (unlikely) and change things to your liking.  I
prefer a peaceful method, voting for those people who embody my ideals.
One reason I belong to the ultra-left Peace & Freedom party (who always run
female candidates for those people who in the past have called me a sexist).

Anyway food for thought.  You have choices, it take real courage to
excersize them.

Nothing weil happen w/o the vote.  Getting the right to be heard is one
thing.  Being continually heard is the other struggle.  Done through voting
it can be very effective.  Ask randall terry, rush limbaugh, and any other

I'm going to try to speak to you with a little respect, even though its tough.
First of all, there is no such model as CDJ-500mkII, you're confusing a
technics 1200mkII with a CDJ-500II or CDJ-500-2. Those are off of the boxes
and the manuals. Check your facts. When I started using them in 1995, I was
actually mixing on a pair of 500-G's. So I am not lying, not full of shit,
and apparently you are confused.



>Sounds like you still are. Well don't take it out on me and my opinion,
>especially because you weren't prepared. and you can pull that corncob
>out now, it's now  ripe n' saucy and ready to eat.

Yeah.



>Yeah, 1200's do great out in the desert at burning man. they do great
>when the wind is blowing the cart around, do great when tweaked out
>ravers bump the tables lightly... and the vinyl does great to with all
>the sand and grit and cigarette smoke.

My point was that CDJ's are much easier to do damage to. The signal gets
more fucked up and is more noticeable when it skips, and sometimes will
*stop* if the source of the vibration is strong enough. You might not have
that much experience playing on yours in adverse conditions. I don't know.

>never cleaned it. it has protective covers that cover the lenses as

As I said, I've moved my decks around a lot, they've seen use in a lot of
different environments. I've played on other people's cdj's, both in the
studio and at at shows. Mine have been subjected to normal wear and tear on
the road, and on airplanes, and whatnot. Maybe yours haven't left the
house. I don't know. I am speaking of both the 500-g's and the 500-II's
because I've had problems with both. I have friends that have had problems
on both, with both the hardware and skipping issues that spoke of. I've
conversed with Dj's in other cities that use them and gotten their
feedback, and it appears that some of the unit's faults are universal.

>isolation (hey, if he gets to be a snotty wank, i do too).

I tried to give the original poster some good information, unfortuneatly I
chose to slam you on a public list along with that info. That was a
mistake, which I have addressed. I hope that original poster can glean some
pertinent information from my current responses, which are not intended to
fan the flames of burning shit. I have no need to "defend" my range of
experience. I don't claim to know everything.



>just because the display doesn't have umpteen digits of precision doesn't

>resolution. i know i can get between the "digits" on the readout.

You say that you "know" that you can get between them, you say that it
doesn't mean that the resolution isn't there, where is your proof for these
statements? I started mixing on 1200's for about 2.5 years prior to using
the CDJ's, and am comparing the differences based on my experience, as well
as concurrence with other individuals who have had the same conditions that
I have.



>leave it. I didn't notice you saying anything other than what a
>lame-ass sucker you are for not being able to spin in your timeslot
>because you weren't prepared, that and a bunch of factually incorrect
>and stupid non-information.

Ok, I'll field this. You didn't notice anything that I said because I
pissed you off. Read more carefully, and I'll speak more carefully. Deal?
We did a soundcheck the day before, and it didn't really work too well, so
I had to hope for the best. The only manner in which I was unprepared was
not having any records on me, due to the fact that I sold my record
collection to start a CD collection, over 2 years ago. My information is
factually correct, and hopefully this time you will read a little slower
and find that since I'm not trying to insult you any further, you can also
glean a little information from my experience.

  Although we had the time of our lives at the F8 2-year party (thanks
to all those folks!), my friend Matt lost or it was "accidentily"
picked up by someone at the party on Sunday mornin'.  It's black, i
beleive a Konica (not exactly sure).  Anyway if anyone has it or knows
who does could you please mail me back.  Matt would really like the
camera, but if that's not "possible" for the person to do, we would
really like the film inside.  There were some great moments caught on
film and it would be wonderful to have them.  So, reply to:
LVMAC@CWNET.COM or VIBEGRRL@AOL.COM

 or lastly send film (and camera) to Mac McIntosh

My opinion:

If I believe something should change, I should use every means at my
disposal to help this happen.  Voting takes very little time relative to
anything else, and if I can vote in someone that (for instance) supports
environmental protection, maybe I won't have to waste a bunch of time in
activism (for instance) to fight logging in national forests.  Even if
you're a violent revolutionary anarchist, you can always vote for whoever
you think will weaken the police and military most.

The one thing you should *never* do is to vote for a major-party candidate
because you "know" the minor party can't win.  This is a self-fulfilling
prophecy.  Think about it -- "You should vote for me because the person you
like will never win."  Bad logic, and a bad decision.

However, one thing is certain: the fact that less than half of the
population votes will never cause those voted in to voluntarily give up.
"Oh, I guess that was a vote of no confidence, so we'll dismantle the House
of Representatives."  Yeah, right.

     well well, seems as if i feel the need to post more than once this
month. first of all, this little "i'm an underground raver therefore i am
better" attitude is making me sick. who the fuck cares what kind of a party
person you are?. we should be concerned that people can't have a disagreement
without it ending in violence. we should also concern ourselves with the fact
that the people involved even felt the need to carry weapons on them in the
first place. a word of advice to you so-called "enlightened underground
ravers", don't look at the world through rose colored glasses. this is a
little cliche, but it's so true. don't think that your world of PLUR,
glitter, stickers, and blo-pops is safe from the ways of the world around
you. years ago i thought that violence just wasn't possible at a party of all
places. i was stupid to believe that the rave world is such a perfect place
and you are too if you believe that your UG network is safe from the reality
of the world outside of raving.

read on. i had to continue this in another installment because AOL sucks.
     
the other part of this post that bothered me is the reference to oakland.
what the hell is that kind of crap supposed to mean? where the hell is
"deepest darkest oakland"? i don't want to jump to conclusions about the
wording. but, references like "deepest darkest oakland" lead me to believe
that you feel that the fact that oakland is an area full of minorties means
that parties held there will end in violence. please correct me if i'm wrong.
i would hate to think that ethnicity is another way that some people on this
list will use to judge others. for your info. as well, the party took place
in an industrial area of oakland. 
     i think that it's time for me to step down off of my soapbox now. like i
said in the subject line, "cut the bullshit" someone died. that should be of
greater importance to us.

John, I have no idea why you are so against PLURity, when you meet 
people, you do want them to (R)espect you, when you are sharing your 
sorrow with your girlfriend, who I might add did a great job protecting 
her man =), you do expect her to show her (L)ove to you, you do want to 
be conected with her so she would understand what you are going through, 
and in another words you want (U)nity. And I'm sure you  want (P)eace 
for yourself, so stop saying PLUR sux... because most of us do belive in 
PLUR. And most of us do want Peace, Love, Unity, and Respect from others 
and the world that we live in. 

So as again I will say....
P..........L.............U.............R
H..........U.............G.............S

To tell you all the truth, I didn't even know what  "flaming" was until I
subscribed to this list a year ago.
People will say what they want.  It's all about living in America.
I'm not going to add to the current thread that's been going on; but I
will say this.

I have never felt such a closeness to people I have never met before. 
It's like, all you guys (and gals!) are like family; and when I see one
of my brothers accusing one of my other brothers of saying something
demeaning, I lose that sense of family.  We're all in this together,
folks.  Name-calling and accusations are not necessary.  True, there has
been a lot of violence in our scene lately, but you've got to remember
that we are not the only ones that go to these parties.  We all know that
none of us on this list could be the cause of such heinous acts, so why
are we all yelling at each other?

I still have yet to meet a majority of you, and when I do, please
remember, you're all a part of my family.

much love,
jay
(doughboy!)

P.S.  Geez, Macadio!!!!!  Am I ever gonna hear a live set from you ever
again????  =)

...and then goes on to talk about candy ravers.


what i want to know, however,  is why aren't people dancing?

excuse my ignorance but i'm still trying to figure this sf rave thing
out because it's so different from what i know from england.

i noticed this at Basics where the dancefloor was packed but about 70
percent of all the people were just standing there watching the dj or
talking. it was a bit off-putting. no wonder you guys here don't like
massives. they are weird.

in england where most raves are massives the whole dancefloor is one
bouncing mass and if you're not dancing you leave the dancefloor. i'm
not complaining, don't get me wrong. i'm just curious. i can
understand the appeal of watching the dj spin but it's not quite what
i go to raves for. i love the feeling of being one of thousands of
people bouncing to the same beat. as much as i loved the trance + acid
experience of last sat at f8 i did miss this feeling of unity and
security and happiness and closeness. it felt lonelier and more
introvert than my british rave experiences. maybe that has to do w/
the choice of drugs. don't know. gotta try it again some time. haven't
really been to enough raves/parties here yet to compare or form an
opinion. i'm just a bit puzzled.

ben's theory about the massives here is that there are a lot of
non-ravers due to the fact that here the beer drinkers can't go to
bars until they're 21, so they come to raves. in england you only find
real hardcore ravers at raves because the beer drinkers can go to
pubs. here the scene seems a bit diluted.

i'd love some input on this topic. it's so easy to mis-interpret
cultural differences and i don't want to do that.

Ya know... it's possible no one would have said it... And I think, in my

was actually THERE and believed that they had a justifiable reason to say it.
Being that you didn't even ATTEND the party, I see no other reason for you to
be anal about it than to start a big flame war... If that was your
intention... Congrats.

Why spout off if you really don't have a reason except being anal? But

One more time for the record:

I never said ANYTHING bad about Oakland... I used to live there and think
it's a great place... It's had its string of fucking awesome parties... Trust
me... I used to attend commercial parties EVERY weekend.

My post was IN NO WAY saying that UG ravers are better, more enlightened, or
safer than anyone else... It's just an observation I have made over the past
few years that violence has a tendency to occur at a higher rate at the
parties with more ppl attending.  If you think about this it DOES make
sense... More ppl... more possibilities for violence to occur...

And don't think that just because ppl in the underground have their candy and
stickers that they are safe  from violence... that was something that I NEVER
said... it was an assumption that someone else decided to make. My comment
was just an opinion from personal experience... So flame me for it... :) It
makes me smile.

        I replied to him in private, but thanks for the support. I mean,
I've been raving for years and I've never been mugged before at one until
Tribal Massive at HomeBase last year. I mean, I'm not saying all of Oakland
is bad and that all minorities are bad. I happen to be somewhat of a
minority myself. I don't mean darkest really in conjunction with violence,
just more like fear(like hanging around all those nice warehouse in the dark.)

        Look, I really didn't mean this in any racist way at all. I just
meant dark as an element of fear. In my stoned haze I regret that I
sometimes refer to cliches(deepest, darkest corner of the room)in haste. I
apologie to anyone I may have offended. I sort of meant it sarcastically but
now I feel all bad about it. Sheesh, what a downer to be attacked for typing
in a cliche. Sorry people. Do you guys sit around and wait for something
offensive or something that you could just possible disagree with in any
small manner so you can jump on the author's throat for writing it? But I am
sorry if I offended anyone. I guess I feel like I should leave the list now.
I've just recieved too many threats than I can handle. I thought I joined
the list for fun, and that raving was all about fun. That's all I ever
looked at it as, an escape from my regular boring, miserable, lonely life.
Sorry again.

Island Web at http://www.island.org has updated it's look. We also have one 
the most extensive new link databases -- which will be updated as well soon with
separate page for each topic area. It's a fascinating place to begin exploring 
the ideas catalyzed by the psychedelic experience.

On Island Web, you can find back issues of our first four Island Views 
newsletters, resources about Huxley's vision. You can join the Island community 
and have your e-mail address and web site published in Island Village. 
Or you can join our mailing list and receive updates and news flashes.

We also have a marketplace with videotapes, audiotapes, books, and other items 
of interest to ELFers.

Soon, we will be announcing the publication of Psychedelic Island Views Vol 3, No.1.
Contents include:

* Interview with Terence McKenna by Bruce Eisner
* The History of the Digital Be-In
* The Electronic Koolaide Test by Douglas Rushkoff
* Interview with Owsley Stanley by Bruce Eisner Part One
* Changes <column> by Elizabeth Gips
* Smoke and Mirrors <Book review> by John Beresford 
* Poem by Nick Herbert, AKA Dr. Jabir
* Shadow Dancer (excerpt part 1) (Fiction) by Dr. James Fadiman
* Last Word by Peter Stafford

Island Web and Psychedelic Island Views are sponsored by Island Foundation. Island 
Foundation is a non-profit California Corporation dedicated to a culture inspired by 
the visionary experience -- an idea first put forth by Aldous Huxley in his last novel, 
Island.

We are looking for volunteers to help with portions of the web site and the magazine. 
If you would like to help, please e-mail me -- Bruce Eisner at bruce@mindemdia.com. 
Island Foundation is supported by memberships, donations, sales from our marketplace 
and commercial sponsors. We ask that you help and be sure to explore the resources 
we are bringing to the enthegenic community.

        Okay, I don't check my email all the time because I don't sit around
computers if I can help it. I have to be around computers at work and that's
bad enough. Now, I don't care about crime in either place, you interpreted
my sentence in ways my non-racist imagination could not even concieve of and
now you are harassing me. Can't you possibly find something better to do
with your time? You're ruining my already sad existence outside of raves. So
I suck, okay? There, big macho computer guy, you win! I am a loser. I am a
racist, prejudice bastard who shouldn't be allowed to live. Now have you got
your jollies? I shouldn't be allowed to rave, and I should be strung up
naked before town hall in Oakland for all the citizens to see, and recieve
47 floggings for my crimes against humanity. My sentence lowered the
intelligence off all who read it, it was a cruel, vicious, statement,
carefully constructed to poke fear into the hearts off all who oppose pure
christian white males.

        yeah, you're the only one who understands the reference. You are
obviously smarter than I am. I don't know what you're talking about. I
didn't read that anywhere. You see, I don't understand racism. I just make
remarks that sound cool to me, and don't think that anyone really takes the
time to analyze them. Now let's see. What are you talking about? The great
white hunter what? Where in the world is this coming from? What did I do
wrong? I am offending people without even knowing how I am doing it? Are any
of these sentences I typed in offensive? Wait a minute, look!!! It says
'great white' a few lines up! Oh my god, I can't let those words be
together! Help, someone, please!

        Well, it seems like the flames have subsided somewhat, but we'll see
tomorrow! Hopefully when I meet all of you who flamed me, first I'll let you
give me a good sock right to my breadbasket. Just leave me on the ground
gasping for air. Then when I get it back, we can laugh it off and get back
to the good old times. sorry about this rampant sarcasm, I don't normally do
this, but you know when you hang out with really sarcastic people for a
while and it starts to rub off on you?

this thread is dead.  I have an appointment with the toliet I don;t want to
miss.  too much candy makes me very ill.

Please add this to the garbage heap of the useless.

And please, don't try to delve into my relationship by analyzing a single
post from my lady.  You might want to meet us face to face before you can
draw too many conclusions.

Oh yeah, plur sux.  Do something and stop talking about it already.

And one other thing, this thread is dead.


Thanks I will now depart this thread, before I begin to get too hot from
all the prsumptuous glitterhugz.  And not in the good way either.

Is this thread dead yet?  I thought so,
John

Welp, since everyone else has posted their happenings for the night, I
just had to post mine. Well, we decided to go to wonderland at around
7:45 and drove quite fast to get tickets at Solid Grooves before it
closed at 8. We made it and then called the map point, called a few more
times and decided we had a wrong number. Thanks Orson for telling me the
new number! Anyways, my friend and I lagged as always, and got to the
party around 1:30 to find cops outside and lots of upset ravers outside!
Anywho, we hung around at our car with the hopes the cops would leave
but we got back and to see the entire party being cleared out.  We heard
about two makeup parties, but my map from the 60's had no Illnois
street. So we went to 3-COM to find a lot of VERY cold ravers, we were
very cold, and waited around until once again SF's finest came and we
once again dispersed.  I found my way to my good buddy's after party in
San Jose, and saw a lot of tired ravers listening to people spin on
belt-drive turntables. But my buddy Matt threw a good party, and I'm
glad he did, such a nice boy! I feel so proud, I took him to his first
rave, anywh0, I'm rambling, several people wanted me to ask this, is
there going to be a make up party by Wonderland?  We all doubt refunds,
but throw a make-up party! Welp, I love you all!

This guy is super cool. Flaming our list. What is the point of wasting
your energy to affend a lot of people who enjoy this list?? If you don't
enjoy it then you should get off of it.

I love Oakland to, but I think you shouldn't post on a list you think is
rubbish. Damn....

I think it may be time to take this thread offline, as it seems to have
little to do with raving.

My responses will now be to John Lee and Gringbeast.  If anybody else wants
in, let me know.

Peace food and hug bombz,

okay, if this is true, does this excuse, in anyway, the violence that
occurred? there very well *could* have been deaths as a result of it... yet
this post (to me) implies that because there weren't, then all is okay. not
so, at least not in my book. there were 2 stabbings, that much we know is
true. this in and of itself is quite shocking. how did these ppl get in
with their weapons? never mind; i wasn't patted down and had wide-leg pants
on - wouldn't have been very difficult to get something in. i still think
that the idea of a metal detector is a good idea. you know, knives and guns
can be very tiny, and innocent ppl can get caught in the middle of things.
this is what's important here. other ppl can unknowingly get involved.

and i'll shut up now - i'm as drained from this as everyone else is.

peace - e.

no shit! i've never been to a party anywhere else where there were so many
ppl just standing around. and all over the dance floor! flame me if you

these ppl just standing there... it really makes so much of a difference
when everyone is dancing. i thought that this was a large part of what
raves were about....

yup - i've been to parties in tx, toronto, all over ny, and a few in
england. everyone dances there, even when they're just walking around! how
can you not? i don't know, i find it hard not to be moving to the beat,
even if i'm tired and sitting against a wall somewhere. my head still bobs!

(snip)
yeah, it really makes a huge difference in the ambience of the party.
saturday i kept dancing around and wondering why all these ppl were just
standing there.... i felt sad for them in a way.

anyway, i've devoted far too much of my time already this morning to email,
so i'm outta here.

cheers - e. :)

hi all you sfravers

aaah, it's so good to be back on sfraves. i was suffering from serious
withdrawal symptoms. i see you're still bickering about the same old
stuff and the rumours are still as sensationalistc as ever. i love you
guys :)

i had to unsvbscribe when we came over here from england and we
haven't had regular access to a computer until now. and this is only
temporary until we move on again.

we've had great fun since we arrived 3 weeks ago. i call this my email
vacation and it's the weirdest thing i've ever done. we've been
staying w/ people we've met on this list, hanging out w/ them, going
to parties w/ them and we have now completely abandoned our plans of
renting a car and driving out to the southwest because we won't have
time. there's so much to do around here, so many people to meet, so
many PARTIES TO GO TO!!! this is such good fun. and we still got 6
weeks to go.

so far we've been to:
warmth, beats, basics, several house parties, freaky people, and F8.
next weekend: happy kids and area 51.

thanks to all of you for taking in 2 complete strangers
thanks to ruby for making me understand the candy raver phenomenon,
thanks to adam for introducing me to trance,
thanks to julie (say hi to amy), eric (i can't believe we lost that
baseball glove), ora (sorry we didn't make it to wonder), nancy (who's
probably in europe right now. see you in england in august), byroni
(who we only experienced in a semi-conscious state so far but were
told he's always like that), chris + carol (lovely place), ibukun (for
the riceroni. best after-rave food ever! gooey, no need to chew.),
ivan (for trying to get us onto the right BART)....

now, let me just clear some stuff up:

1. yes, the music is generally harder and faster in england

2. clubs are NOT raves. sometimes rave tunes get into the club scene
but they are usually completely corrupted. clubs play mainstream music
and are usually pretty dreadful meat markets. raves in englang are
generally huge legal licenzed warehouse parties of up to 8000 people.
the atmosphere at these raves is the same as the atmosphere was at
warmth, i.e. good vibes and family atmosphere, and you will only find
dedicated hardcore ravers there, no clubbers, no beer drinkers. 
the underground raves are smaller but usually equally good with a
slightly greater possibilities of non-ravers sneaking in. they are
more new age traveller parties and the music and crowd are more
diverse but not mainstream. you'll get anything from happy hardcore to
techno to jungle. the trance i've heard here so far would be far to
slow for these do's.

3.yes, these big raves are commercial. the only way to get around the
stupid laws on assemblies/parties/repetetive beats (Criminal Justice
Act) was to apply for licences, pay horrendous fees, let the police on
site. so the organizers became commercial. these raves are expensive
but bloody good fun sometimes w/ funfairs outside or movie marquees.
it's a big thing and not only a dance party.

4. the candy raver scene is completely new to me. never seen anything
like it in england. can't comment on that yet because i haven't quite
figured it out yet. i've been told there's a glittery trance scene in
london but it's supposedly gay, i.e. fairly exclusive and shunned be
hardcore ravers.

5. MCs are cool and an important part of the english rave scene. DJs
usually work w/ the same MC all the time and the MC is there to hype
up the crowd. they rap or sing and make people aware of which dj is
spinning.

all of this is my completely subjective opinion of what i've seen and
experienced in england and here, which is not necessarily
representative. the milton keynes scene might be completely different
from the manchester scene and SF is, from what i gather from the list,
different from the LA.

but who cares. it's all great fun. it's all a matter of taste. it's
all a party.

o.k. that's it for now.
love you all 
and to all those sfravers that we haven't met yet: hope to meet you
all soon

This is a misquote.  I did not say the text that is shown below.  I merely
forwarded it back to the list so the TITLE of the message would bring the
truth (no matter what it means or doesn't mean) to the list.  I just did a
"forward" then tacked on "no deaths at origin" to the topic.
The below quote was written by someone else (promoter?)

it all started last wednesday when inSECT and I packed up the truck and
headed east towards Sacramento in search of a 16'x16' army tent and a 25Kw
generator... For some unknown reason our navigational skills failed us and
we got lost on the way to both places...however it all worked out fine and
after a few u turns we managed to get on our way up into the Sierras at the
wopping speed of 35 mph... After much driving and a little fretting about
the possibilities of further wrong turns we found our destination ( a
clearing off of a dirt road in the middle of nowhere ) slightly before
sunset... Much to our dismay we set to the task of seting up our newly
purchased tent without the assistance of our friends who had yet to arrive
from their journey to Fresno to retrieve the sound system...About an hour
later; shortly after we finished struggling with 135lbs of tent we heard
the rumble of a large truck on the dirt road and our excitment grew as our
friends neared... Wednseday night was a time for relaxation after a day of
driving all over the world... Thanks to Mari for the stunning Vegan Cuisine
that she amazingly pulled off on a campstove ( this is true talent folks
)... Finally sleep....

      Thursday morning we worked hard setting up Sound, Light, Camp,
Scaffolding and the Dj booth... Our group of 12 pulled together and we got
everything done before the sun reached is highest ( and hottest ) point in
the sky... We chilled for most of the afternoon as more of our friends and
even my little brother ( a definite non-raver ) arrived,  I spun a few
records on the newly erected system, watched an amazing sunset ( i can't
even begin to describe it ), ate some more of Mari's amazing fare and slept
comfortably in the back of the sound truck ( my tent was too full at this
point )


    Friday morning we dug the Latrine, a shitty job which brought out a
strange side of everyone ( the conversation went way off into left field ),
completed the set up of the rig,  went to find a waterfal ( thanks for the
ride and the company Dave, Gem and Soda )...ended up bathing in a steam of
35 degree water ( boy is that a little chilly ) and heading back to camp in
time to prepare for the opening ceremonies...

The party started at about 8 pm with a live band playing on tablas,
digeridoos and a sitar. the music was good and was soon overtaken by the
deep drone of inSECT's ambient. the music moved through ambient to slow
dubby acid until Julio took over and brought in the beat with a blend of
Trancy house and Techno. At this time two Djs and a live act had yet to
show up and the other slotted live act is having gear problems. 2 hours
later LMNT takes the decks ( a 1/4 volume unfortunately- due to some lame
ass CD players ) and gives us some brutally hard Acid Trance ( this boy
rocks )... Gabber Dave was up next pounding the small crowd into submission
with a fine selection of hardcore... Dan Efex spun an unexpected set of
minimal Goa trance which kept the crowd grooving until..... GABBER GIRL
arrived... Now I was in the truck trying to sleep when this happened but i
heard it anyways so let me tell it this way.... Barney and Hardcore, Mr.
Rogers and Hardcore, John Wayne and Hardcore, Enya and Hardcore, the
Macerana ( sp? ) and Hardcore... it was insane with a capital INSANE... I
finally fell asleep as Johnsin took the decks and played some Tech step
Jungle ( mellow by comparison ).


Saturday the rest of the crowd arrived, UV99 had arrived the night before
and set to the task of constructing a laser show. Re ach spun some Hip Hop
and other breakbeat wierdness, ate more vegan food, watched another
beautiful sunset, hung out with my brother and his girlfriend (?) who were
kind of in awe and on some heavy psychedelics...

Saturday night began with a circle, moved into Seth Sutekh, Greg Sandler
and Then Dan Efex again... All were good but my nerves were too shot to
enjoy them as i was informed earlier in the day that not only would I be
spinning in the peak slot due to scheduling conflict with Dan Efex but I
would most likely be doing it alone thanke to those infernal CDJs ( inSECT
and I were all set to tag team )....The lights and the laser made the party
look so incredible ( true eye candy- the beast i've seen in years ). Deaks
was on next with some pounding stompy techno and some crazy mixing. His set
went well but it did little to calm my nerves...As his set ended I stood
there looking out wondering what was about to happen. I turned off the
power to the deck on which his last track was playing, brought in some
noise, faded to my favorite A&E department track and let the ACID begin. At
about this time I notice inSECT struggling with the CD players and as i
finally bring in Punk Floyd he tells me that i'm on my own... OH SHIT is
the only thought passing through my mind... my fingers were numb from he
cold, my flash light burned out, i accidently turned of the power on one
deck during a mix.... it was hectic, i was a mess... I'm not sure how it
really went...i'm too lost in a cloud of subjective self loathing to give
an accurate review... Thanks to Ernie and Maya for being there at the end
of my set to shower me with positivity... I will be doing this again ( and
getting it right )... I then cuddled up with my girlfriend in the truck and
went to sleep soon afterwards. The highlights of the night for me were
watching my brother and his friend on E for the first time...especially
introducing her to the bassbins =] ( there is a convert in the crowd ),
listening to Gabber Girl rant about relieving herself in the woods ( while
candy flipping)


Sunday we relaxed... music continued until about 6 pm as we tore down the
main sound system...Gabber Dave vs Gabber Girl ( what more can you ask for
)... Loaded up the main truck ( and mine too ), watched the last of the
beautiful sunsets, ate more food, said goodbye to all but the original core
group, watched the stars from the roof of the sound truck


Monday we packed up all that remained, hitched up the Generator and drove
home for a shower and some SUSHI =]



Thanks to: Everyone who was there... all old friends and new... Goolie you
rock ( thanks for staying to help us pack ).

Subject: Give it a rest--More Origin/Violence Rant
Sender: sfraves-owner@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

Just wondering if I was the only one who doesn't know what the big deal is.  
Especially after reading the post Max forwarded about what really went down.

I personally have no problem admitting that I don't give a damn about the 
whole thing, and I suspect I'm not alone.  I've been at house parties (w/ zero 
security) and had fights break out right in front of me, guns fired right next 
to me.  I go home in one piece and I have a good story to tell people.  I'm 
not trying to say I'm hardcore and I've seen a lot of shit go down, but I'm no 
stranger to violence.  It happens.  Life goes on (for the survivors).  Big 
deal.

You can tell when stuff isn't right at a party and other places.  If you 
don't, you should be more aware of your surroundings, because you might get 
hurt.  People just act funny when they're about to start trouble.  When you 
see the signs, you'd better steer clear.  Sometimes you might not react 
quickly enough, or even have a chance to react.  That's too bad.  But you take 
a chance w/ your life when you get in a car or walk down the street.  Parties 
are no different.

You can't really expect people to become nonviolent when man has been violent 
since he first came into existence.  A couple angry, idealistic posts aren't 
going to eliminate man's innate violent nature.  Take care of yourself and 
your friends.  Everyone else is going to do whatever they want anyway.

I might be wrong.  You may be able to stop the violence.  If you believe this, 
quit wasting your time posting and go do something about it if you care so 
much.  Actions speak louder than words.

xoxo--Miccaela

someone slightly misinterpreted my post and thought i didn't have a
good time at f8. let me just put that right for all of you who thought
the same:

nonono. you got me wrong there. it was different, yes, but i had a
wonderful time. you must have missed my brief post on mondays about
f8. i absolutly loved it. it was the best experience since my first
rave. just different.

and i'm not saying either one is better or worse. i would be such an
arrogant asshole if i was running around saying everything is much
better in england. and what would be the point in coming to another
country to check out the rave scene and then find it to be exactly how
it is at home. boooooring!

i'm just curious why people aren't dancing because i don't quite
understand that and want to know why. but maybe i haven't been to
enough parties.

sf and surroundings seems to have a very interesting culture w/ a
strange mix of manic industrious hyper-ness and almost catatonic
mellowness. would be interesting to know if that is caused by the
computer industry or if it's always been like that.

when you travel you should look for differences not similarities. so
if i ask 'why' don't think i don't agree, i just don't understand.

to say it again: i loved f8! and i even liked basics although that was
a bit strange. it was a bit off-putting that nobody was dancing. i'm a
bit shy and need the crowd around me. but i love massives and i don't
expect large crowds like that to be in absolutly complete harmony. a
certain percentage of bad vibes or even crime is normal in human
society and the rave scene is not an exception although i think this
percentage is much much lower there.

If I can convince my band mates to end rehearsal early enough, I'm gonna be
at Happy Kidz.  Remember that I'm NOT the Chris who just asked for a punch
in the bread basket, ok?  :)  

Semi Rave Related:  My band usually practices Sundays, and I invariably
show up at the studio...still spinning from Saturday nights...EvEnts...
I've had some of the most amazing experiences behind the drum set on
Sundays.  We play psychedelic hypno-drone music, and its incredible how 5-7
minute songs turn into 40 minute

my fairly sober band mates along on this trip...

OK, just thought I'd share...

Precisely. You're using terms that you MUST have learned somewhere, but you
dont even realize that they're offensive, or could be construed as such. In
this instance, your UNCONSCIOUS RACISM is shown. All of us who were raised in
this country have this affliction.  It is the extent to which you recognize
it and attempt to reduce it is what is most important. Dont fight it, you're
on the path to better understanding.... right now for you there is, as Adonis
said, " No Way Back."

ps-By the way, does anyone care that there was actually no one killed at
Origin and that people seriously dissed other people *publicly* with the
assumption that someone WAS?

Things are getting a little tense posters. (I guess I could understand
if it was close to tax time or finals were still going on).
SMILE PEOPLE. LET'S TALK ABOUT MUSIC.

p.s. I will say, tho, that it is a little amusing to see people getting
so angry online and then write 10k emails to post to the list in
complete abandon.

Anyone interested in non-commercial radio or becoming a radio dj should 
come to KZSU's once-quarterly organizational meeting tonight at 7:30pm. 
The meeting is in Bishop Auditorium in the Business School on Stanford 
campus, really close to Hoover Tower. If you have a web browser, here's a 
map of the location:

	http://www-pcd.stanford.edu/cgi-bin/map/map.html?GSB

Or email me for more info. Essentially, you can be on your way to having 
your own radio show in no time, everybody's welcome.

You know what Chris? I would not leave the list. Your explanation is
completely honest and, I think, should put all of the alarmists at rest.
Mistakes can be made, but in this instance I really don't think that you
made a mistake. What we are witnessing (in this instance) are people
conditioned to respond to race related things in an alarmist manner w/o
hearing all sides of an issue.
Race and racism are important (concerning both political and social
ramifications), but this thing has just gone a little crazy and outta
control.
O.k., take a breather if you must, but if you decide to come back, I'll
be the first to say "welcome back."

	...DJ Wildchild's "London Update of Drum and Bass"...

	If anyone is curious, this is a wicked selection of pure party tracks mixed by the ever-improving female dj Wildchild...the mixing isn't flawless, but the overall effectiveness of the entire set would certainly tear up any dancefloor...Check it out....



       Tracks include ShyFx's "Message", Decoder's "Elements" as well as "Circuit Breaker" and "Power Steppers", Ray Keith's remix of the Dream Team's "Menace" and the super duper jazzy beef of "Shooks"..

Overall, I recommend anyone who says they can't dance to jungle, to GET THIS CD....

First off, I'm really glad I got to meet the both of you at Beats.:)

Now the MCs - my friend Daryll from London has sent Melanie and me tapes
of the music over there that has MCs rapping or singing.  Now as
open-minded as I have tried to be, I just don't like it. I like to
interpret the music in my own way, not by someone else telling me how I
should. And if the MC is needed to hype up the crowd - well, I think
maybe better music should be played, cause it's the music itsself that
should hype up a crowd! :)

I certainly have not written off MCs as sucking - it may be something I
have to acquire a taste for - like JUNGLE!  I didn't used to like it,
but it grew on me! :)

love,
Amy

I need some trance DJ/mix recommendations, stuff on tape or CD that I can
find at Housewares or F8 now that Ameba is dead. I prefer CD since I can't
get tapes to last much longer than a month or two in my car's stereo oven.

Some trance mixed with acid house would be extra rad.

Yeah, I just got my tickets yesterday.  I haven't been this psyched to
go to a massive in quite a while!  The dj line-up looks killer and
anyone who knows me knows I am really into UFOs and the ET phenomena.  I
am totally looking forward to the lectures from the MUFON member.
This week is going by SSSSSSSSLLLLLLLLLLLOOOOOOOOOWWWWWWWWWWW!!!!!

Gosh, then the weekend after this one is FREEDOM.  I'm getting all my
partying done in one dose! :)

Oh my gosh...A couple great 12"s out this week.

G-Money- I understand- Integral UK

If you slept on 'Falling', G's last track, you shouldn't miss this
one. Straight up TRIPPY roller!! Weird grinding analogue bass line and
strange melodic but techy sounds througout. This track is amazing.
Liten and you'll understand.

Renegade Hardware- 2x12"- UK

Can't rememebr what this one is called, but it's vicious. 3 RH remixes
by the original artists and one track by DJ Kane. 3 dark steppers and
one amen workout. If you like it deep, this is for you!

E-sassin-??- Soundsphere US

New domestic d+b from LA. Check it out: Hard, dark techtep. A-side
uses what I think is a Boymerang break. It takes a while to get going,
but when it drops...you'll know it. Flip side is a minimal dark tech
piece.
Good stuff!

Sorry, but you might be confused.  Brian and I just recevied, boxes, manuals,
and all, two CDJ-500mkIIs from J&R Music World in New York.  They are 
top-loading "professional" (whatever that means) CD players with tempo
control, looping, and god knows what else.  Going from turntables to these
is like learning to drive a car all over again.  And they are GORGEOUS!  I feel
like I'm piloting a starship when I use them!  So many buttons and dials and
lights and wheels!  Ok, so I'm a blinky-light nerd.  I'm just totally in love.

Laura

P.S.  Not rave related (not that this was either, but...) I'm changing jobs
in about two weeks and will be working in San Francisco full time.  I'm
so happy to have my home and my job in the same place.  So hopefully I'll
start being at MAD more than once every six months (there, I made it barely
rave-related)

I wouldn't call Mars & Mystr-E Goa...  If I'm wrong please correct me,
because I deserve to feel ashamed at my stupidity :P.

I don't know much about Goa, although what I heard Vajra spin, I would put
him it that category.  I'm not sure if he has any tapes out.  Maybe
somebody else has more info...

as i said, it's a matter of taste (and what you *grow up* with)

MCs make sense in 5000 people raves in england, here i would find them
distracting too.
(i guess the idea is NOT to interpret the music in your own way but to
have the whole crowd moving as one. the MCs facilitate that. but if
you want to go it individually you can easily filter them out. they
are not as loud live as they are on mixtapes)

amy brought up a point here that i feel is valid and important.  A
good dj does not need someone to "hype" up a crowd for him/her.  A
good dj should be able to do this on their own, assuming that this is
what they are trying to do.  I know a lot of dj's (myself included)
that want to put the crowd into a "trance" and the last thing they (or
i) need is someone rapping/screaming/hyping up the crowd.  But all of
this depends on the dj's style and ineterest (whether he is there to
put on a show..or there to interact with and take the crowd on a
journey). 

I've heard live MC'ing over jungle before and liked it..well for the
most part...the guy was doing it WAY too much and took away from the
dj (which i really wanted to hear).

my point:
good music of any kind should be able to move the crowd and a good dj
does not need an MC to do so.

but i guess the day macadio get's a live MC then it'll be all over and
i too might have to get one.  ;)

amy brought up a point here that i feel is valid and important.  A
good dj does not need someone to "hype" up a crowd for him/her.  A
good dj should be able to do this on their own, assuming that this is
what they are trying to do.  I know a lot of dj's (myself included)
that want to put the crowd into a "trance" and the last thing they (or
i) need is someone rapping/screaming/hyping up the crowd.  But all of
this depends on the dj's style and ineterest (whether he is there to
put on a show..or there to interact with and take the crowd on a
journey).

Astrologically things have been pretty tense for the last week . We
have been discussing this on an astrology list for the past month.
 I wont bore you all with the details but I will just say we are in a
 period where people are going to be feeling a 
bit tense and angry for a while. So just 
remember to take a second and think before you blow up and
remember that many others are on the edge too so we need
to chill for awhile and try to just be extra tolerant of others for 
a few weeks. Think of this as emotional fire season and 
take precautionary measures and try not to add fuel to 
the fires...its not worth it. 

Have a fun and foolish day and stay active  =)

OK - I can be little miss voyer no longer!  Damn - this Death at Origin
thread has become "personall attack at X" thread.  That isn't what this
is supposed to be about, is it?

I can't speak for everyone else who has responded to you, Chris, but I
do know Goolie.
I've heard Goolie to say that evil things happen when good men do
nothing.  He's a good man - not a "big macho computer guy" who wants to
see you strung up in Oakland and flogged.  Homey don't play that.  And,
if I'm correct in reading his response to your post, there was not a
single word in it about you not being allowed to rave.

<snip>
My sentence lowered the
intelligence off all who read it, it was a cruel, vicious, statement,
carefully constructed to poke fear into the hearts off all who oppose
pure
christian white males.
<snip>

The truth of the matter is there's really no way _not_ to react from the
back of our most primitive selves when talking about racism - real or
imagined, genuine or misinterpreted. I do hope this was sarcasm, because
it really does little else than show your intelligence - or lack
thereof.

PLUR - and don't forget the understanding!!!!!

Hello Everyone,
	I would like to apologize to the various lists I belong
to for not participating as I had promised. This includes the lists
for knucklehead, Leslie Ayers, Greg Sandler Etc. The work load
at my new DEPT. is quite overwhelming. We sometimes work 7/10
hour days per week...especially at the end of each quarter.
this is the only reason I have not attended meetings and responded
to post as I have before. getting up at 4 in the morning, means
I go to sleep about 8/9pm. I hope my status remains the same
with all of you, as my dedication is mostly to my job now. I 
hope thing will change in the future, so I may dedicate more
time to what I really love...music and the people involved in this
scene. 
				Much Love
				Vertigo

Well, talk to our beloved Lara and tell her to put together a tape.
She's got all my goa records. Not to mention 2 of my tables and my

Find anything by Surge (the Light is a good one) or Dutch (Panopticon for 
example). I don't know if many of the other goa dj's have tapes out.

	I have sometimes wondered what it would be like to mix

Yup...it's the same Freedom by the same people who bring you the
Gathering. Don't know if it's going to be at that same outdoor
location though. 

Remember at last years Freedom at about 5 or so in the morning twilight,
the space shuttle was re-entering the earth's atmosphere and looked
like a purple neon light flying across the sky just as the music was 
peaking! 

Peace,

deep, deep bass with washing sea sounds and this slightly processed
monk-type voice leading you through a meditation.  It was really
quite effective.  

I imagine that if done well live it could be a pretty amazing 
experience.  The specific linguistics of the words that are said
are extremely important, though; not just what images you present,
but how you do so, and it would be easy to do badly.

Yup...it's the same Freedom by the same people who bring you the
Gathering. Don't know if it's going to be at that same outdoor
location though.

Remember at last years Freedom at about 5 or so in the morning twilight,
the space shuttle was re-entering the earth's atmosphere and looked
like a purple neon light flying across the sky just as the music was
peaking!

Peace,

	Most MCs that I have heard and thought were good used a bit of
distortion and a flanger on there voice. But that was to hard stompy
music. I remember one night nearly 2 and half years ago were there was an
MC and a trumpet player banging sounds on top of the frenzied techno and
jungle. The last time I went back, I didn't see an MC at any of the
parties I went to. Here is SF, spaz has an mc or two amidst their ranks
and I have heard him sound really good - part of the Food Not Bombs
benefit at Ceasar's - and not so good, mostly because he was turning the
mic up to loud so that it was distorting in the mixer...

>   And if the MC is needed to hype up the crowd - well, I think

> should hype up a crowd! :)

	Hype the crowd means something different here than it does in the
UK. Ok, I am about to be really horrible, but it's the only way I know how
to describe this. Take the December Chyrallis 2 winters ago, move it from
Acme to a bigger venue (where the tables won't keep skipping), quadrule
the number of people on the dance floor dancing with the same energy (only
its goes furthur since the tables don't keep skipping)... Now you want
something to take everyone furthur, the music is a hell of a lot faster,
its probably raining inside from the condensation, you are bouncing
shoulder to shoulder pretty much everyone, its hot, the music is pounding
and then this noise appears and bops along with the rhythm...


It really is a matter of personal choice, and IMHO that choice really
needs to be made in the culture to which MCs are part of, not in a place
that is skeptical of them right off the bat...

	That was an amazing party. One of the few large scale ones I
have been to that I enjoyed. I was pretty dirty when I got home, but

	Contact hunab_ku or CCC if you want Goa trance. I doubt they'll

	Almost forgot - you could also contact the Ion Exchange in
Santa Cruz. DJ Tom from Koininea has a killer Goa mixtape, although
I don't know that he's ever done a mass production run - it's kind 
of a one-off by request thing.

	They might have some other stuff too,

Have only done this on a smaller scale -- put mongo headphones on my happy
tripping friend, put some of those opaque red-LED blinky sunglasses on his
head, led him through a 3 hour journey as he was sprawled on my floor: had
the headphones plugged into a mixing desk w/2 CD players, turntable,
computer, fx unit, microphone (aka voices from god direct to your brain
happi tripper)

In my own stuff finding that you can do neat things with continuous
underlying 32-hz frequencies, people sort of tune them out eventually and
then when you drop them it's like falling off into space cuz' the ground's
missing.

Interested in finding other baybound persons who do electronic noise as
well, have a medium-to-decent rig for immortalizing experiences on CD for
local smallscale distribution too. Contact? Bzzt me.

ugh,

As this scene becomes more mainstream more mainstream filth tends to enter.
The idea that many of you are backing metal detectors just goes to prove to
me that this is ass ebbing, and not very gracefully.

Old skool fact: 92-94  We didn't need no stinkin' metal detectors.  The
security at the door was usually enough.

Kidz just don;t know how to act these days.

yikes,
John

I love this,

The older I get the more intolerant the people on this list become.  Well
you will never have to worry about such problems in SF rest assured.  As
soon as *we* rid ourselves of those pesky brown ones we can all feel safe
in our enclave of perpetual whiteness together.

Deepest darkest my f-ing ass.

Can someone please close the door, strangers are coming in.

out,
John

        you all who don't go to Berkeley should know something about us.
It's a fact that going to Berkeley will make you pretentious and elitist.
All the faculty suffer from this, and the students as well. Even people who
just live in Berkeley suffer from this. We basically get the idea that we
are smarter than everyone else, just because it seems that everyone in
Berkeley is incredibly intelligent in some way. This is our fault, we
recognize it, sorry for any inconveniences it may cause you. I could
actually list of reasons that transform us this way, but that would be
boring and a waste of space.

Dear racist,

Please go back to wherever the fuck you came from so that the list can
return to  being a place where real normal people gahter to express
themselves.  SInce you obviously do not fit any of these characteristics,
your knuckle dragging ass is excused.

Now will someone shut the door, the Klan has finnaly made itslef very apparent.

Oh yeah genius, the only thing that is dark is your mind.  It certainly
isn't deep, einstein.

Now go wear your white gown somewhere else,
John S. Lee - Black to the future.

Are you so blind that you cannot see.  The statement was racist as it gets.
Just another intolerant asshole.  I wish rednecks like this would move to
idaho and interbreed in trailers, where they belong.

Racism is not silly.  Maybe next time you should THINK before posting.  As
an Africna American I also take great offense at what you said.

And I would dare you to utter such nonsense to me personally.  I wish
intolerant racist assholes, like yourself, would leave real people who are
sturggling to get along, alone.

Now please, apologize.

        Oh, it makes sense. No one actually threatened me, but some called
me pretty rude names and stuff(which is basically the extent of internet
threats) And it all makes sense, I'm not leaving, but when you suddenly read
like, 15 flames in a row personally addressed to you and not the list, you
get a little defensive. Sorry about all this...

i didn't even notice that deaths had occurred.  it saddens my heart.  i 
do remember a boy in blue grabbing me by the shoulder and telling me i 
could not go here nor there.  

i absolutely loved the party other than that tragedy.  i was working the 
h2o bar for most of the night.  but when i was off i was getting off.  
two set-ups and visuals that were nice.  i walked home in the early 
oakland home......

after five hours off slEEp i was ready to chill out somemore.  i took 
the bart to civic center and hopped on the 21 muni.  i finally made it 
to buena vista park.  mellow and free two aspects i really appreciate 
about a party.  the elemental crew was very hospitable.  if you get the 
chance to chek these guys out please do.  the music was a virtual who's 
who in electronica including lots of unknown stuff to me.  the people 
there were really down and i stayyed all day for the late 9:15 sunset.  
supreme beauty. thanks elemental

plurry not in a hurry.....jake loco

        I'm assuming you're joking, right? I can't tell exactly. So I can't
really reply. If you are not joking, then I would be quite upset at this.
However, I'm in a good mood, so I'll just assume you are joking. Ha ha! That
was funny! It reminds of me of that movie "Higher Learning". 'Unlearn',
everybody!

	I'm pretty sure he's serious. For those who have joined the list
since I posted this last, I'll repeat myself. Racism is one of the many
flavors of ethnocentrism. Ethnocentrism is so universal among human beings
that it seems to be something we're born with. Ethnocentrism is the belief
that whatever group you're in is the best group - whether that group be
your race, nationality, religion, sex, whatever... 

	We're all born with this. What matters is what we do about it.

        Oh, I meant more of not going to raves because I didn't have the
'raving spirit' or enough 'PLURity' which are terms I hate using. I was
being sarcastic through most of my post, ya know. I in no way meant any
disrespect of anybody by calling them names. It's just I recieved so many
flames that were far more degrading that what I was posting back. I was
called a "fucking racist idiot" and a "white, prejudice bastard" by a few of
you who know who you are, and I really didn't appreciate it at all. My
message was called "racist trash" and I was told to "suck a dick for even
saying that shit." I have never met Goolie but I'm sure he is a very nice
guy, and if I met any of you who sent me flames I'm sure if you met me you'd
understand that I am none of those at all. 

        From the way you worded your post, it seems that you didn't catch on
to my sarcasm, which is somewhat frightening to me. Do you think I am
actually that screwed up? Do any of you? If so, let me be the first to say
that I am not racist one bit. I am half-vietnamese, quarter Cherokee, and
quarter 'white'. If I was racist, I would not know who not to discriminate
against.

        heh heh heh. This is getting funny and silly now. Silly people. I
actually have an incredibly low self-esteem, so when people flame me I
actually read and re-read them to figure out what I need to change about
myself. So I guess I let people get to me, and I overanalyze every remark
made about me. Hey, at least I can recognize that I have low self-esteem,
because denial is not just a river in Egypt.

        Okay, I thought I was dealing with this okay until now. You are now
not only insulting me, you are insulting someone who came to my defense.
This is not tolerable by my standards at all. I was having fun joking up
until this e-mail. This is so bad I can't even concieve that anybody, I
repeat, ANYBODY, could slander someone in this way. I will not stand by and
let this happen, and I demand that you apologize for this inconsiderate
post. You don't know how hard it is for me to contain my insults back, but I
am not going to go to that level. But if you represent the future, let me
kill myself now, because I want no part of it.

        So you're saying that I'm racist and I have no choice? Forget you
people! This is ridiculous. I swear, I have not one ounce of racism in me. I
grew up in Santa Cruz. I have 3 close friends who are black, and 2 close
friends who are chicano. I live in Berkeley now because I don't like racism
and it is a very liberal place. Look, I have never felt racist in any way at
all and if you are calling me racist and that I can do nothing about it,
well, I guess that sucks for everyone. Hey, we're all racist now, and we
have no choice. Yay! 

        -chris

ps. For all of you who are bored of my posts, so am I. But I feel that
silence would not help anything. Ignore me. Cast me off into the shadows.
No, let me rephrase that, cast me off into the night. No, how about corner?
yeah, corner, that's it. That shouldn't offend anyone.

I, like many others, have been on this list for some time.  And for the
life of me, with all the various topics, various arguments, various
disagreements, I cannot recall as much insensitivity, and callousness as
the last few days of posts have demonstrated.

This list has been filled with new people, who for the life of me, just
don't seem to get it.  They don't think before they speak, they utter
racist and vile things against people they know little or nothing about,
and they do this at the same time while uttering that nonsencial word, PLUR.

You know, for all the pontificating of that acronym many of you aspouse,
how little of it seems real when it comes to your expression of thoughts to
the masses.  G-d, if this is new skool I am very, very happy to be old and
jaded.  The one thing the old timers still have is openess, maybe not for
new fangled parties where people stuck in adolesence can call themselves
"tickle me glitter baby", but we are certainly open to each other.
Something many of you PLURists (definitely a new school thang) aspire to
but will probably never have.

I can only wonder how you will take this scene to the next level with such
juvenile and neandethal thoughts.  Like I said in the past, parties were
better when there were more gays, varieties in sexual orientation, and
definitely more color.  I doubt many of you PLURists could even hang with
many of the parties in the old days since they were held in the "deepest
and darkest" of Hunter's Point.

Well, I have decided that I can help you new folx out, not all of you
obviously.  For there will be some that are beyond hope, and there
certainly will be those who already get it despite thier new-skool PLUr
status, you know who you are.  For the rest of you, and you know who you
are, let me offer some tips so that your message of PLUR can be heard past
the teddy bear hugz and blow pop dreams:

-First, use your real name.
There is nothing more phoney than someone hiding behind a psuedonym and
spouting out some slogan.  If you want that acronym to have any credibility
COME OUT, and revela thyself.  Using your real name is a good start.  Let's
get real and then maybe some of us can take you seriously.  But I
understand how some would want to be anonymous, after all, who the fuck
wants to go to work, a 20 something and say my names "tickle me glitterboy"
so...

-Secondly, If you can't use your real name use an adult one.
What do I mean? Let's take "tickle me glitterboy", he would be MUCH more
convincing if he called himself "tickle my dildo", or "sparky
spunkshooter", or, if you really wanna get adult, "beat me bobby".  Now
that is what I call real names for real people.  Besides, I know I would be
more embarassed using a copyrighted name than using something original and
adult.

-Lastly, Girls, grow up and take those pacifiers out of your mouths. And
get that fucking frog off your back!
Ladies, there are growm men around.  Despite all efforts at removing the
sexual energy of some males, we are intrinsically turned on by grown women
dressed upo as little girls.  Stop it now!  You've brought the women's
movement back 60 years dressing like twiggy with a kermit backpack, a bunch
of blowpops in your mouth, and girlie ponytails.  Grow up!  You need
schooling from your elder sisters...you need to go back, way back, I'm
talking booty-back and dress down some.  Don't get it?  What I'm talking
about is taking that shirt off and stop wearing those goawdawful baggy
pants and put your booty in some shorts.  A long time ago, this was the
look, and beleive it or not, women were harassed less then looking like
this, than now.  Why?  Don't ask me, but I sure liked it! So simplify, take
off some garb and shake it a little.  You may find your need for that elmo
less than the need for  hearing some good music while you bust a sweat.

Ok, so now we have accomplished a few things that will make you a very
valid spokesperson for PLUR; you have an adult name, and you are dressing
like and adult partyer. But look at the advantages, people will take you
more seriously now that you have a truly adult demeanor than when you were
in ponytails yapping about some party you went to.  And fellas, you ain't
immune, don't encourage the ladies by buying them dolls, and stop with the
candy already, that's what overpriced "peachy-puff" girls are being
exploited for.  Do something adult, and support your local exploited person.

Now that we've gotten all of that out of the way let me tell you about my
true fgeelings about this word, PLUR:
it sux, period.

Why?  Because, there is really little on the list, especially from the
PLURists.  Few are the people who have real respect for each other, and the
list of late has been flooded with intolerance, and people supporting
intolerance.  Either by word or deed.  Some muttonhead utters some racist
bile and some of you are so isolated with your experiences with minorities
that you have NO IDEA how something as innocent as "deepest and darkest of
Oakland" could ever offend.  My g-d, growing up w/o a signifigant person of
color in your life has left you a social cripple.  Get some flavor will ya?
I'm off track...there  is no respect for others.  this list is made up of
every color of the rainbow, from the whitest of white, to the blackest of
black and every gender imaginable.  You have to keep the sensitivites of
others in mind when posting.  It's called respect, but as I said there is
little of that on the list of late.  For a real sense of PLUR and what many
fo you yap about ad nauseam please reference the old-skool.  We may be
jaded (not! ;( ), but look at the level of conversation that goes on.
Sheeit, if motherfuckers are talking to Neils you know there's some serious
respect going on (Neils is the man after all!).

And why not stop talking about it and signing it, and start living it
outside the rave.  If ya did that, along with my tips for severing your
lingering adolescence I think that the ideals in that acronym could have
real and lasting meaning.

But if history serves me correct, it's nothing but a bunch of feel good
rhetoric caused my frequent escapism.  How do I know?  Becuase all the PLUR
in the world won't save you from being stabbed, from being kicked out of
school while your friends leave you and partay (PLUR! ;p ), while the
five-oh is busting your head for not giving him the big R he demands.

Now I know some of you new-skool will be offended.  Oh well.  There will be
others, and we've "talked", who know wassup.  They are the ones who live
the ideal, are new-skool, and never use the term but show it by throwing
parties, helping out thier pals in time of need, forsaking a party to make
their friend feel good.  There are plenty of young good soldiers out there
who work, live, breathe and eat the ideal since it is a natural part of
their essence.  For those whom it is not natural?  They are the most vocal
adherents.  Reminds me of Southern Baptists who love the ideals of Jesus,
then don't want to integrate schools, don't want an end to slavery, want to
limit women's choices and run thier wombs, snf sre not tolerant of anyone
who isn't a staunch heterosexual.  For these folx PLUR is a slogan that has
rules rigid and terse, unbendable, and only certain people are eligible,
and there are litmus tests for adherence.

What a bunch of Rave Nazi's goosestepping with teddybears, glitter, and
lollypops.  If it weren't so true it would be laughable.  But is is true
and it's very laughable.

Well I've said quite enough.  Some of you will want to flame me, save it.
Some of you will utter on the list how I'm a know it all, save that too.
Some of you will accuse me of being holier than thou, and most times I am,
so save it.  Some of you will curse me out or try, save that too.  Why?  It
has been done by better.

So think about what I've said, and you may kindly junk it.  I'm tired of
the fake ass posuers and would like the posturing for who's most plur and
wishing plur on everyone, and using phoney ass names, and using a phoney
ass slogan that never leaves the rave.  And don't give me hugz, unless I
met you or talked with you, thatz phoney.  Don't wish me plur since I live
it everyday and don't need to tell everyone how PLURish I am since I have
little to prove (other than I can write really long tirades).  The only
reason why I even made this sillyass post is to save this list from being
buried under piles of phoney shit.

I will now leave the lot of you, and you know who you are, to your
PLUR-reality.  Have fun, and when the party is over, count how many friends
you have, then let me know how that PLUR thing worked out.

Time to go and play some bomb ass deep house and jungle.  After all, after
7 years of parties what is a grown man to do? ;)

Much, much, too much,
John

P.S.  XLR8R - you made me do this.  I saw that letter and saw that PLUR
crap and almost puked.  I did puke as a matter of fact and I was really mad
'cuz I don't like to waste food.  So I did a "fly" n'stuff.  Now that's
sticky-stink n'stuff.

Now will someone please close the door.

Rubbish, we are TAUGHT this.  No child comes into this world knowing he is
black, irish, or whatever, until his stupid parents tell him so.  Racism,
bigotry, intolerance, sexism, any -ism, is an artifact of socialization,
not genetics.

I gotta love this guy, he's as slick as farrakhan who says he cannot be
racist because he is black.  Get off of it, all that "minority" blood just
means you are an intolerant multi-racial individual.

And you didn't mention black, something you seem very at ease being
discriminatory against.

Please do, the world would be a cleaner place or certain (after all, you
offered).  Reminds me of Caligula in one scene a senator wishes that he
would gladly give his life if Juipter would spare Caligula.  Caligula in a
moment of clairty says "Jupiter accepts you offer."  The sentor utters &
babbles as he's dragged away to be killed.

Anyway, no apolgy will I offer any racist or racist staement.  What I said
stands.  I am sick of people like yourself bringing the species down with
this garbage.  Here we are, 3 yearrs from the 21st centuryt and I still
have to deal with rubbish my great-grandfather had to deal with.  What a
crock.

Nope, you should've thought before you posted.  I am still waiting for an
apology for your racist statements Chris.  Be a man, and deal with your
intolerance.  The LEAST you can do is apologize.  The most you can do is
have a broader range of experiences.

Out,
John

Alright alright, enough.  Let's cool it with the flaming and flame baiting.
 Chris made a stupid comment, and got flamed - what more needs to be
discussed?  Who has a deeper understanding of race issues or is
more-sensitive-than-thou?

I just came back a few days ago from spending 5 days in South Africa on
business.  In 1994 SA came out of probably the ugliest episode in human
history since Germany in the 30's and 40's.  You would not *believe* the
gap between the races over there, between their living conditions.  Every
hotel and office park was built like a fortress; nobody drives in downtown
Jo'burg due to daily carjackings by gangs with AK-47's; and the "suburbs"
of big cities alternate between rich white ghettos and black shantytowns.
This is about an order of magnitude worse than the American South of the
1950's.

Yet, everyone there was upbeat about the future.  Aggressive affirmitive
action policies are in place, blacks are becoming landowners and business
owners and managers, the middle class is burgeoning, and gaps elsewhere are
closing.  Slowly, but surely.  The theme is reconciliation.

My point?  Things are actually pretty good in America when it comes to race
relations, on the whole, and we are pretty foolish to be so quick to jump
on each other when there are places much worse off than we are. And more
importantly, we need to move *beyond* it.  Not forget about the past or
transgressions, but realize that there's nothing to be gained from carrying
a grudge or refusing to work together.

Now, Chris's use of language was pretty dumb, especially for a Berkeley
student.  I won't defend it.  But we have to get past this.

K?

	Brian

ok everyone,
     i'm posting to the list again. i found out late last night that the
whole death at Origin was nothing more than a vicious rumor. the fans of this
fire were flamed by miscommunication by everyone on the list, myself
included. unfortunately, i had already sent my post to the list on the whole
matter when i found out the truth. i noticed that many people were quick to
start commenting on a party that many of them didn't even attend. 
     i should have found out the truth in the first place. after all, i'm a
PROUD member of the Nomad Family. i'm relieved that no one was seriously hurt
and that this was all just a rumor. with the exception of the items in
reference to someone dying, i meant everything that i said in my posts. i'm a
firm believer that the elitist underground attitude that i see coming from
many people on the list is what is damaging our ability to communicate. i
could go on forever about my opinions on this but i won't. 
    in regards to stopping the rumors. stop sending spams to the list with
the header "Death at Origin". all of these posts get archived. there was NO
DEATH at the party. it's only fair to Nomad to stop posting such negative and
hurtful things.
     in the words of parliament funkadelic, "free your mind and your ass will
follow!!!"

keep it real,
dorena 
P.S. tom and stacey, i love you guys!!! in the words of the late tupac
shakur, "keep your head up!"

I got some public and private email about this so I'll clarify:

I am *NOT* advocating voting as the only way to change, nor (like I said)
am I advocating voting for anyone you don't actually believe in.  (Did I
vote for Clinton or Dole?  Neither.)  I agree that, in general, only direct
action will get you anywhere, because the political process is inherently
biased against anyone not already in power.  HOWEVER!  That is no reason
not to take a few hours once every two years or so, figure out who's best,
and vote for them, because it's not a lot of work.  Who knows?  Arcata, CA
has a green city council now.  There are independents in the Senate.

My point: don't use your energy, and others' energy, fighting about what
the best way is to change the system, because then the system wins.  It's
not worth fighting for a system in which everyone has to agree.  Just do
what you can, however you can, because otherwise the world will continue to
get worse.

NOTE: the following is a cruel joke, and is my response to the mentality of
sfraves recently.  i'm not sure which mailing list i've been subscribed to...

__________

welcome to sf-jsl, the san francisco bay area's list for those who love
listening to john s. lee's theories on life and race / gender relations.

Please save this message for future reference.  Thank you.

If you ever want to remove yourself from this mailing list,
you can send mail to <Majordomo@grumpy.com> with the following
command in the body of your email message:

    unsubscribe sf-jsl <your address here>

 Here's the general information for the list you've subscribed to,
 in case you don't already have it:

       -*-*- PLEASE READ THIS MESSAGE IN ITS ENTIRETY -*-*-
Thanks for joining the sf-jsl List. Please read this message in its
entirety, as it contains all of the information you'll need to get you
started.

-- What this is all about

The sf-jsl list is here to get information out about John S. Lee's views
about race and gender relations, and about the current victims of his wrath.

please note that this will be a moderated list, so all posts will be
screened by the list-owner, John S. Lee.

please observe the following guidelines:

1)the use of the phrase "PLUR" or any of its deritives, such as "PLUR baby"
or "PLURRY party" will not be tolerated.

2)all references to the following objects / activities are disallowed:
	-lollipops
	-glitter
	-glowsticks
	-kermit backpacks
	-anything considered remotely happy / young

3)all participants must pass a rigorous physical screening.  the following
articles found on participants are grounds for immediate dismissal:
	-baggy pants
	-glitter / stickers
	-nametags containing the strings "candy", "plur", or "hugz"

4)all references to color will be immediately interpreted as racist
regardless of original intent, as will references to gender / sexual
orientation.

5)all participants going to parties must wear the following slogan on some
visible part of their body: "John S. Lee has raved much longer than I have.
 Direct all question / comments to him."

However, this list is not a discussion forum, and it's also not a way
to reach John S. Lee. To contact him, please send email to his personal
address with "/dev/null" in the subject line. If you occasionally want to
post a review of the last John S. Lee rant, or if you have any cool ideas
for the next one
that you want to share, then great! But other than that, if there is
too much activity, we'll have to mock you until you publicly acknowledge
your inherent racism, sexism, and homophobia, and grovel for forgiveness!

Also, rather than send test postings to a large group of people, you
should instead send email to majordomo@grumpy.com with the single
line "which" in the body. This will tell you what lists you are
subscribed to. If sf-jsl appears there, then I assure you
everything is working a-okay. :)

-- How to use this list (technical stuff)

(*) To subscribe, send mail to sf-jsl-request@grumpy.com
    with no subject, and the single line "subscribe" in the
    body (don't include the quotes!).
(*) To unsubscribe, follow the same procedure, but use the word
    "unsubscribe" in the body, instead.
(*) To post to the list, send email to John S. Lee personally, and he will 
    screen the message personally for inappropriate content.
(*) Archives of this list are available on the web at:
    http://www.grumpy.com/archives/sf-jsl
(*) If you are using procmail or any other type of filter program,
    you can filter for the sender line in the header:

Chris, I support you.

I had a pyschology teacher once that told my class that if you even think of a
person's race in conjunction with that person, that is a racist thought.  While
I don't know if I believe that or not, it is interesting.  It's a word that
every single person in the world will tack a different meaning too.  Different
things will offend different people.

I think the important thing here is that Chris meant no ill will towards anyone
when he posted.  If you believe that racism is society's fault and _everyone's_
problem [like I do] and it makes you angry, direct that energy on a more global
scale.  And not using a guy who had no intention of offending anyone as a
scapegoat.

b.

There has been so much talk about racism, and everything else that I 
want to throw something in...

I have a line for you, it's from a song, whoever is going to tell me the 
artist and what the line means I will give... uh..mmm, I don't know what 
I will give but lets start of with a super hug.. (I don't know if John 
is open to hugs though) but anyways here it is:

"When the child is still a worm, it's hard for him to learn the number 
seven."

Any ideas?

yours trully

Well, I kept my mouth shut during the whole thread, but would you care to
qualify your earlier statement about the "great whiteout" of a
neighborhood John, since you seem so intent on accusing others of racism?
Your statement could just as easily have been misinterpreted(or properly?) 
in much the same way Chris's statement was.

        No, I'm saying *we're* ethnocentric by nature, but *we* can
do something about it if we choose to. Not everyone is racist, but
that's mostly because not everyone considers their race a significant
part of their identity. It's pretty hard not to if you grew up in the
US, though.

	But still, somebody who's not racist might be raverist - i.e.
ravers are the best people & everyone else sucks or is second class
at best. And so on ...

HA - now I know why I listen to so many different kinds of music:

the artist is none other than marilyn manson, almost universally
regarded as a satanist and generally ugly person.  From the Antichrist
Superstar album, the song is titled Cryptorchild.

I wonder if you have any idea the potential significance of this
referene.  On one level, and this is the level I think most people read
manson, his lyrics are combative, destructive and dangerous.  On another
level, they're truthful, sorrowful and quite socialist.

Educational confession: MA in Cultural Theory - so I may see his lyrics
a little differently than other people.

Anyway, the line actually reads "when the boy is still a worm it's hard
to learn the number seven" - a maggot? a caterpillar before it becomes a
butterfly or moth?  and why the third prime number?????

Great whiteout is the gentrification (whitening) of a neighborhood.  SF is
doing this in full force via various means.  It is not racist to point out
the truth.  Gentrification involves moving whites into areas that have been
traditionally non-erupoean.  Erasing the color and replacing it with white.
Gentrification, urban renewal, call it what you will it is the same.

And no there is no similarity between my statement and Chris, mine does not
carry any negative connotations other than the negative connotations of
gentrification.  Furthermore, when has anything realting to whites ever
been seen as negative?

What is the problem adder?  White-out is exactly what it is.  They remove
the pople of color and replace it with whites.  The whole POINT of
gentrification.

jsl

P.S.  Pointing out gentrification is not racist, we've gone round and round
on this and we will not see eye to eye.  You don't like me to mention race,
citing some colorblindness.  If you do not notice my blackness, then
please, I'll lend you my glasses so that you may see.  For my blackness is
very real.  And I am very, very comfortable with it.

you can have the last on this one, arguing with you has proven in the past
to be cyclical and a "no gainer".  And I am sure, as it realtes to matters
of race, you feel the same about me.

It's all yours...you can have the last.

Here is a new policy on flames..

If you feel like you wish to flame somebody, please ask John (or jsl as 
he likes to refer to himself) to edit your post, so it would sound more 
rude, more abnoxious, and more insulting. 

These words MUST be used: asshole, fuck, black my ass, stupid, redneck, 
and other words which John will gladly teach you.

After your post has been edited by John, please send it to the list, but 
don't forget to send atleast 5 copies to Chris, since he is the one for 
this week, and maybe next week, to recieve flames.

Thank you for following this rule, =)

hugs

Dear Kate, you got the artist right, however I would like to disagree 
with the explanation of that line, so anybody else would like to try...

However since Kate got the artist right, she gets a huge hug, and guess

Props kate..

>				Black Adder

And to further prove my point as to why sqaying white out and saying black
out have totally seperate connotations, I refer to websters so that I may
rid myself of this discussion about race w/ adder:

black:  lacking hue and brightness; absorbing light w/o reflecting any of
the rays composing it, as the type on this page pertaining to or belonging
to an ethnic group characterized by dark skin pigmentation; Negro;...soiled
or stained with dirt...gloomy pessimistic or dismal...boding ill, sullen or
hostile..harmful..inexcuseable,  w/o any moral light or goodness, marked by
ruin or desolation, indicating sensure, disgrace...w/o milk or cream (gotta
love the implications so far adder or do you wannna ignore these as well?
let me continue...)...sad depressing somber...calamitous, sinful...-Ant.
white


white: color of pure snow, of the margins of this page...marked by very
slight pigmentation of the skin as many Caucasoids..pallid or pale as from
fear or other emotions..silvery as hair...politcally
ultraconservative..honest decent; That's very white of you (this was in the
dictionary mind you!, no Negro wrote this I assure you ;) )...morally pure,
innocent...without mailce, pure, harmless..auspicious or
fortunate..containing milk or cream...


Gentrification:
 the buying and selling of  houses in deteriorated urban neighborhoods esp
by middle-income professionals, thus improving property values but often
displacing low-income families.

Adder, you have tried whenever I mention the word "white" to paint me as a
racist.  I submit that saying "deepest darkest of Oakland" is far worse
than saying white-out which, from the dictionary perspective is a very good
thing (I do not agree of course, diversity is strength IMO).

Adder, knwledge has been dropped...what he said was racist, what I said was
not.  Nice try, again..I can't wait to hear this explanation of my racism
this time.

Late,
John

P.S.  I guess to answer your question, no it cnnot be misintepreted if one
reads and understands the context under which such words are spoken.  Only
those with some racial axe to grind could find the racism in my statement.

Jeezus Kee - riste John!

Man, I feel like I just listened to Black Sabbath at 78 speed or something!
But I have to say that I understand your feelings.  And being a bit 
oldskool myself, I have to agree that there are a lot of folks out there 
who just aren't getting it.  
SFRaves, in my experience, has been a place where you could come and just 
spout off about whatever part of the scene grabbed your interest at any 
particular point in time and get some good honest feedback from your 
cyberfamily and then the next time you all partied together, it would 
just be hugs and love and groovy happiness.  But it seems like some folks 
think SFRaves is a place to just bag on other folks and try to show how 
superior one individual/group/organization/etc. is to everyone else in 
the scene / on the 'net / on the planet.
So, I think I'm gonna stick with John here and be one of those folks who 
advocates openness and honesty and real hugs (not those puny-ass 
I'm-just-gonna-gently-rest-my-arms-on-you-for-a-moment things)!!
Oh, and breakbeats!  I am 100% in support of breakbeats.

See you at Happy Kids :)

I just wanted to say thanks for reminding everyone what raves are all
about... The music...  

I'm really glad to have found out that no one died at Origin... Any of my
posts that come up later than 6/25 I posted before the info from  Nomad got
posted... My only remaining question is how the guys got in to the party....
 

And to those  who attended Origin... How the hell was it? The flyer was
really nice...

Love 'n' Lucky Charms,

John is spouting in response to stuff he feels uncomfortable about.

And, if I'm gonna love everybody, I have to even love folks who are 
baggin on others.
I think that the people who are so upset just need some candy or a hug or 
something.
I dunno.
But I've been down at times too, and I know how it can feel when it seems 
like no one else in the world understands your perceptions... know what I 
mean?
*sigh*

The thing I've always loved the most about SFRaves is that it seems like 
everyone can go off as much as they want on the 'net but when everyone 
gets together, everything is okay again.  I wanted to try to bring some 
of that feeling to my post. :/

OKAY Already...
Ya know, I was really trying to stay out of this goddamn thread, but you,
dear John, need to open your eyes.

Are you the only one in this world who hasn't heard of the cliches which
include the words "deepest, darkest"????

For example:
... look into the deepest darkest chasms of your mind...  <----- ok,
maybe this is not a popular cliche, but it works as an example-- watch
any TV show with a psychiatrist
or 
... the deepest darkest corners of the universe...  <----- any space show

I read Chris' post like any other person-- as a cliche.

Am I supposed to call people racist everytime I see or hear the word
"flip" because I'm Filipino???  I don't think so....
C'mon, man...  open your mind!

Peace
jay

Sender: sfraves-owner@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

well, since it's been a while since i've read anything on this list that's
actually about RAVING, i thought i'd post something that is. and, it's not a
flame :) it has nothing to do with death, sexism, racism, etc. 
        *sorry if i've disappointed anyone by being posistive.....*

i went to seattle last weekend to visit a friend and we went to a party and
let me tell you guys, it made me miss and appreciate the sf scene so much!
there were plenty of jnco's, adidas, drugs, glow sticks, and even some
pretty decent music (with an amazing set from our very own drc)...but no
vibe at all!
there were no smiles, no hugs, no meeting of new people. the only person i
met was some army guy who was trying to pick up on me.....
there was however one, yes only one, person who came up to me with a smile
and a lollipop (oops, is that a taboo word now?)....anyway, i thanked him
and told him a little about the sf scene. and guess what? he said that's
where he learned it 
*grin*

what i learned on my trip-
our scene is truly the best! no matter how many people you have at a party,
how good the music is, how good the visuals, drugs, location, blah, blah,
blah are, a party is really nothing without a good vibe. and i really think
the sf scene has got one of the best around :) i don't mean to offend anyone
who may be from seattle (or anywhere else for that matter...) i just want to
remind you guys how truly lucky we are. maybe if we concentrated less on
*flaming* and more on our *scene* and how wonderful it is, we'd all feel a
little more fortunate for what we've got and we'd have more respect and
appreciation for it and everyone in it. 

just a thought. i love you all. and i miss sf like crazy.....
cricket :)

He was not using a cliche, but using a metaphor.  More specifically he
named a location that is not known for its affluence.

He did not relate it to the universe.

You would then have to assume that everyone's post is a cliche, and perhaps
people are really speaking their minds, in a serious fashion.  And thaty's
how I read most posts unless the author says otherwise or the opinion is
clear enough to be sarcastic.  He was very matter of fact about it.  And
then tried to defend it.  I just saw it differently that's all.  And my
point is still valid in that view.  It was blatant, bigoted, and racist.


>

See what *you* will my brother.


>C'mon, man...  open your mind!

You mean that if I don't agree I must have a closed mind.  Are you kidding
or am I just paranoid?

We just see it differntly.  I think I am correct, that's no reason to try
to invalidate my feelings based on your standards.  For all those belly
pokes you sure are serious.  Anyway, a person chooses their battles.
although this type is always tiring.   People need more shared experiences
is how I see it...anyway...

Chris,

Haven't you learned that sarcasm isn't allowed on this list?  That's why I
don't even attempt to post anymore.  It doesn't even matter what the topic
is.....words will be misinterpreted and twisted around.  Give it up hon!!
You can't win with the arguers on here.  Sorry for all the crap that's
been happening.  It would be nice for everyone to just STOP about now and
move on to happier threads.

Marty

sometimes i think you make the scene

wherever you go, there you are, sure...
but you might not be so comfortable in a new and strange place
(whether it be seattle or oakland)
and if you're uncomfortable,
you might not feel right at home and give off good vibes to other people...
if you don't have good vibes,
you might not enjoy where you are,
making it very hard to meet new people
or get people to come up to you and talk 
few happy people really go up to miserable people and start conversations, yes?)

which is a long way of saying that
basically
you make the scene

if you are happy
the world is all beautiful
if you are miserable
everything sucks (except maybe what you think you can't get)
and don't forget you can be very miserable
right at home, too

washed clothes at 2:00 a.m. in a laundromat in el cerrito
drove a '71 charger with dual hemis at 90 mph up near wildcat canyon
saw the biggest chronic BUSH in my life in a backyard in el sobrante
and fell in, out, and through love too many times

shit
everything keeps getting better

but only if i try

and it all comes down to the beats
the rhythm
the sound
the life

and you can find that wherever you are
you just have to listen

and not listen cuz you wanna respond and say something back as soon as you can

no, not that...

just listen

and the rhythm will come through
the melody will return
the song will make you warm

and it will be all good
really

:-P

Who was that meant for John?  Did you know there were three different
Chris' involved in this?  Did you know which Chris you were replying to?
Or, did you just fire off an angry post without checking to see who said
what?  Premature conflagulation...Hair trigger problem perhaps?  I hear
they can give you medication for that, oh I forgot you like natural
stuff...

In the two years I've been on this list I've gone from thinking you were
an inflammatory windbag who likes to hear his own voice, to thinking
you're a funny, if cynical, oldskooler.  I guess I should trust first
impressions.

Read your own posts: "It is not racist to point out the truth." Or how
about "I guess to answer your question, no it cannot be misintepreted if
one reads and understands the context under which such words are spoken.
Only those with some racial axe to grind could find the racism in my
statement."  If you really meant what you said, we would not be having
this disscusion.

John, I honestly think you confuse economics with racism.  Money rules
in the US, pure and simple.  The displaced low-income families could
just as well be white.  Funny how you seem to assign the color white to
middle income professionals, and anything but white to the low-income
families.  Keep on grinding that Axe.

So, what pissed the great JSLee off in MY post?  Is it 'cause I said
Oakland is a violent place?  Is it 'cause I wasn't offended by a badly
chosen cliche?  Don't give me that crap about having no one of color in
my life... What makes you think you can ASSume something like that about
someone you have never, and will never meet.  Oh, I think I just
answered my own question... It's that never meeting part that gives you
the right, isn't it?

ChrisP-- Who doesn't like being called a rasist fuck by some coward
sitting behind a computer.

just wondering, what the fuck is so idiotic and racist about saying that 
killings happen in oakland?? first off race was NEVER mentioned.  nor 
was anything racial even implied.  Some cities just have lots of crime.  
That's a fact. chances are there would be more crime in oakland than say 
monterey.  saying so doesn't make  a person "un-plury" or whatever.  
second off where does one get off DEMANDING APOLOGIES gor idiotic 
nonplurry statements???
chill out.

this is sorta mc/dj related
i think if people like to have a dj and an mc or singer or whatever you
should judge it for what it is 
not try to compare it to a single dj.
a single dj uses vinyl to make the sound and does so knowing that just
his/her mixing will be all that comes from the sound system.
dj pairs work together to blend an even more complex beat collage
i have heard that roger s, dj sneak, and Junior sanchez perform together
on six decks.  that must be crazy

when I was out at burning man last year, pollywog played this crazy
morning set on the wicked sound system.
i was really flipped out by that part of the morning.
and as always her sound was wild 
but this time there was a mic and this guy called storm took mic control
he was kinda singing kinda wailing
it was really deep
anyway 
we have to be more openminded about what we connect the mixer to
the line out from one dj doesn't have to be the only source for the sound
system
people that blend the human voice and the dj
or the live performance and the dj
are not using these other things as a crutch or trying to cover up a lack
of skills.
people are just trying to create something fresh and new
like Soulstice
now they are fresh
I had not heard them until the gathering last saturday and they are
fresh.
I'm not saying that  just one person and their record collection is not
enough for me.
i get blown away when people exhibit truly phat individual skills on the
decks
but nowadays people are trying different stuff sometimes and you should
give things a chance  
peace

starting from flaming ravers and going to burning man,
THE house band at burning man, incidentally,

the collective collectively known as
CRASH WORSHIP
is hitting town this weekend @ The Trocadero
and it guarantees to be another phat phat show

no real DJ skills to speak of
but they got mad tribal drums, fireworks, smokebombs,
dancing sweaty half-naked girls, psychedelic ambiguous noise,
primal compulsive rhythm, yadda yadda yadda, the list goes on...

basically, it is a vibe-mongering massive monster
that carries in its distended belly
just that kind of group-shared-experience,
united-in-rhythm-dance-and-music,
butt-shakin-funk-makin-earth-quakin bacon
that i feel is missing from a lot of recent parties

peace pops,

        that's it. I'm off the list. Fuck this shit. You've noticed I
haven't used any obscenities yet, and haven't really personally attacked
someone, but fuck you! This is so bullshit, who the hell are you? If you
don't say joke in a few more messages, I'm just going to have to believe
that you are the most arrogant person I've ever dealt with, ever! Seriously,
all of your messages have not only been attacking me, but my friends, and
everyone on this list, who I consider a friend, except you, of course. I
don't think I could ever like someone as close-minded as you. Goodbye
sfravers! I'm just gonna have to be a normal Berkeley raver from now on I
guess. Maybe I'll come back to the list later or something, after all of
this is over with. I don't care if everyone else on the list are my best
friends, you ruined it for everyone.

        This proves it. Obviously, John is full of shit. He's just doing

        Oh yeah, I'm sure you were psychically linked to me when I wrote it.
I think of Oakland as just another city, so I do not know it's affluence.

i'd make for such a bad scenester,
i didn't even know about the oaktown show

no, this isn't a drinking and driving commercial, although i *have* noticed
quite a bit of reckless behavior as of late.

for those of you out there who are continuing to feed these totally
disintegrated threads that should by this time be duked out in private,
please practice what you are preaching and "chill".

i am not even reading most of the mail i get from this list and the few
messages that do make it through my filters are really disheartening and
not at all exemplative of what *should* be the type of communication going
on in this vitual battle zone, oops, i meant "community".

can we take a moment to ask ourselves why we are here, why we engage in
converstaion with others on this list both publically and privately, and
resolve to make those interactions a little less defensive and curt?
please.  and if you find your inner self responding to those questions in a
negative manner (i.e. "i have something to prove" or "i have my face to
save"), please write majordomo@hyperreal.com and unsvbscribe sfraves.  i
can't speak for everyone on this list, but i believe the general consensus
of my workgroup is "tired o the tude."  if you are acting like an idiot, no
amount of posts to this list is going to rationalize your behavior, and
most ppl can see right through it.  it's hard to admit when we are wrong.
luckily in email situations, we can lean on the crutch of
"miscommunication" a whole lot easier.  all it takes is being big enough to
use that crutch.  rise above the need to save your ego and just do it.
transcend it.

also, if a thread that has debased itself to flames does not initially
involve you, it's probably counterproductive to put in your two pesos....it
will only perpetuate the arguements.....at least from what i have noticed
in my experience.

seriously people, if you haven't read it yet and you still have it in your
in.box, take the time to do so.....the subject line reads "a few words
about constructive posts and being nice by laura lamar and matt cantu".
you might not think it applies to you but even i have a lot to learn from
it and i wrote the dang thing ;>

none of this is to say that scuffs and arguments are bad, generally, i
learn more from arguing with a person than one with whom i agree without
dispute.  arguements, or as i like to call them, intelligent conversations,
are healthy to human interaction and often help us to affirm our own
beliefs and opinions.  but when arguements get out of hand and plummet to
the level of name.calling, finger pointing and general assinine behavior,
they cease to reap anything worth the cornucopia.

sometimes it is hard to remember, but we are truly lucky to have one
another, despite our disagreements.  rather than let these disagreements
divide us, we should open ourselves up for some introspection and actually
learn from and grow stronger as a community from them....if we stand on the
soapbox of plur then we should probably exercise some of that almighty
tolerance.  there are a few cut and dry biblical references to this
(although i am in no way of the xian persuasion):  "to each his own"  "live
and let live" er, um, another not so biblical but almost even better "do
what thou wilt..."  just be nice and play fair.  it's really not that hard.
there are just some little checks we have to place on ourselves.  and by
doing so, thereby taking full responsibilty for our words, actions, and the
repercussions of the two, we can only serve to strengthen ourselves and in
turn the community as a whole.  please try to comprehend and think about
this.

thanks for listening.

love to all and sweet dreams a plenty,
lola aka laura

	Ok, here goes...everyone will hopefully be able to respond 
because everyone here listens to rave music :)

So a few weeks ago, Jelo and Fubari allowed me to play around with thier
set-up and as a lot of you already know, I got COMPLETELY HOOKEd*8^). Now
evertime I go over to thier place, I spend about two to four hours trying
to match beats :) Lately, I've been heading out to solid grooves almost
daily to listen to records and figure out what I like to hear so when I
get my own equipment I'll know what kind of records to buy. So as I've
been doing this I've stubled across a very fusterating problem, and I'd
like some input on how to solve it... 

The problem is simply that I'm having a very difficult time matching
beats, and I'm wondering if I'm doing something wrong, or what I should be
listening for. Granted two things; 1) I'm not THAT familiar with thier
equipment...I haven't seemed to be able to judge yet how far a push of the
slider will speed or slow the records...and 2) I've studied music all my
life. I've played the trombone for 15 years, I've had proffesional lessons
playing the drum set for two years, been in funk bands, school bands, etc,
in other words, I'm familiar with listening to music of all kinds... So
taking these points under consideration, Is there anything anyone can think
of that is critical for beat matching that I might not be doing...any
tips? What are some of the techniques all you DJ's out there use to match?
And even if you're just a listener...when you listen the Dj's up there
switching tracks and matching thier records, can you recall anytimes when
you had an idea of what you might listen for if you were trying to match
those beats? Or maybe it'll just take more time and I just nee more 
practice? I don't know, just say anything :)

Well anyway, I'm hoping that most of you have opinions on all this and 
maybe It'll take all of our mind of all this flaming and other junk for a 
while.

Staaaaaayyyy Cooooooool!

Matt - the other one -

        Dear John S. Lee,

                It amazes me that someone like you is still on this list,
since most of your posts are flames, which means you are constantly unhappy
about what is going on. Well, if you are in a bad situation, get out of it!
I am having trouble with your use of 'old-skool' as a justification of
anything, since it means nothing to me. I don't care what raves were like
from '92-'94(although I started in '94.) I just don't understand any of this
hostility towards me and I can't deal with it, because I can't deal with
hostility through e-mail because it's just plain stupid. I could be almost
100% sure that if I said that one stupid sentence to you in real life it
would have flown right over your head. The part I don't get is why you
decided to insult me personally. You have called me a whole range of
insults, ranging from 'idiot' to 'intolerant racist asshole', or
'knuckle-dragging idiot' and even making racial slurs against me by calling
me a 'redneck', claiming I 'interbreed', and telling me to 'move to a
trailerpark in Idaho' to do this. I have not really insulted you once,
except for a simple 'fuck you'. I can't believe other people on this list
actually sit there and take this. You claim that we are all just
bullshitting and not really acting upon anything, well here's the first. 

                I admit I am maybe too old to understand the whole PLURity
thing myself. But I do understand respect. You claim to be trying to spread
respect, yet you insult everyone on the list constantly. You claim that the
whole PLUR ideal is bullshit and that we should live in reality. Well, I
live in reality, and to me, raves are an escape from that reality. I think
most of us feel the same way, which is why we continue to go to them. If you
want to bring the reality of racism into raving, I don't want to be a part
of it anymore. You also make unusual justifications, such as dictionary
references or gentrification, which boggles me because I'm sure no one on
the list took any part in writing those entries or planning gentrification.
You also constantly refer to skin color, which is something I rarely hear
anymore, except in the news. I never call my friend Sunny my 'black' friend,
for instance. You seem proud of your race, which I never understand because
my race is not something I take pride in, and I don't know anyone who
does(seriously anyways)besides you. Race has never really even been an issue
on here until you decided it should be. Your ego is dripping from every one
of your posts. You always claim to be better than others, and you seem to
feel that most of the raves and ravers today aren't what they used to be.
Well, I have some news for you. Most ravers are around my age or younger,
who just don't think the same way you do, apparently. 

                You also claimed that I am a KKK member, and you tried to
twist my original statement around to instead describe my mental ability.
These are just outright attacks on me, and I really wish if you wanted to
just attack me, you'd do it physically, because that would make more sense
to me than what you are doing. The reason I don't apologize for anything is
because I just don't know what you are asking me to apologize for. The
original statement? So, you want me to apologize for your misinterpratation?
I can't, I didn't do it. 

                I don't think I want to leave this list anymore, and I don't
want to write anymore to you, and I may not reply if you reply to this.
Simply because I know you won't understand this, and I don't understand you,
and I'm through with you. The reason I don't want to leave is that it
doesn't make any sense to do so anymore. These are my friends, and this is
one of my ways to find out what raves they're going to. But please stop
insulting me. I haven't used one racial slur against you, but you are making
it seem like the right thing to do in this case. It seems like you have been
setting it up and purposely escalating everything I say and what people say
in my defense.

                Just leave me alone. I don't care about you, so why do you
care about me so much?

        -chris(after a few hours of trying to spin with John still in my
mind)

good question! I wanted to ask it to...and I think I have before,
but the only answers I got were: "its something in the inside".
ok, I understand that much, I myself am a composer, my music comes
from the inside...but, NOTES will always be notes...and no matter
how much in the inside the music comes from, *NOTES* will be *NOTES*.

I think the "INSIDE" part of DJing comes in after the "TECHNICAL" side.
:) anyhow, back to the BEAT matching thing...

I've actually managed to MATCH a few beats recently (YAY!!!) of course
this is like EURODisco/Trancy type stuff... and some commericial/non
comercial house... gewd..its such a RUSH when you match a beats :) its
wonderful!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :))) it makes you feel fuzzy inside :)

I guess what I did was listen carefully to the beat of one rekkid...
 1 .... 2 .... 3 .... 4 .... 1 .... 2 .... 3 .... 4 
then listen to the other rekkid
[1]....[2]....[3]....[4]....[1]....[2]....[3]....[4]
then like match 'em
1....[2]....3....[4] or like...
1.... 2 ....3....[4]
[1].. 2 ....3.... 4
[1]..[2]....3.... 4

humm.... maybe I'm just trippin'...nevermind me :) I'm probably going
get hella flamed for this ;)

In any case...
[*HUGS*]

Your choice.  I stopped trying to appease anyone other than myself.  I also
leave others alone, until the post some rubbish.  In any case, I guess my
first impressions of this post (my first read from you to me) are true as
well.  I'll leave that impression up to your imagination.  Your adjectives

I would suggest that instead of trying to bait why not try picking up a
book on the subject.  You cannot detach economics and racism.  referneces?
Read Andrew Hackers books, one called Two Nations - white black seperate
hostile & unequal, and Moeny - How they got it and how they keep it.

As for your continual baiting, read a book.

I will tell you that right toi your face if you'd like.  I don't usea fake

point of this , I can.  Be careful..you may get what you wish for.  And BTW

person to assume with.

God you're tepid, and these threats..rubbish.  If you wanna meet let me
know, or just digitally disappear and save yourself some discomfort.


Oh yeah, good morning.

I don;t have time for this, but I'll finsih this dumb thread with this dumb
person.  Since we're throwing insults back and forth and sa people draw
into two camps let this be the last day of this thread.  It needs to go
private or we need to meet face to face and hash it out, doing it here will
do nothing.

You are very wrong.  I hear crap like this often enough that I had a
response waiing and ready.  The type of intolerance you aspouse is very
common here in CA.  The bay area is no exception.  And you sir seems to
embody the rule rather than the exception:
-Make a racial faux pas
-tryo to explain it as harmless
-a response is given
-we go down in flames.

-can we take this private or do you want to continue this fist fight digitally.

Hmmm..intersting, is this thinking globally acting locally?  I was insulted
by what you said and took it to you.  If I knew you I would take it to your
face.  Even if I don;t know you I would stillt ake it to your face since
problems are easiest resolved that way.

And please read, how can you go to Cal and have such poor comprehension?
In any case I didn;t say you interbreed, I suggested taht you may want to
move to a place where it is common.  It could be a genetic + in this case.

I seem to have understood your words very well however, and will stick to
my guns on this.

And I cannot beleive that all of these people sit back and take what you
said (at least the mojority) w/o saying anything.  But this is a really old
discussion and I have come to expect nothing less in mmost cases.  I *am*
tyhe dumb one.  The smart people ignored your dumb reference and creditied
it to your  youth.  I instead took it to heart and have since been dealing
with your tepid explanations and your backers.  Whatever...like I said, I
wish someone would close the door.

respect...and where did you show this for Oakland and the residents?  You
are confused.

No, I insulted you and your cronies over the past 24hours, not all the time.

And now he tries to prove how what he said couldn;t possibly be racist
since he has black friends or is himslef a minority....

I see.  And so I said "deepest darkest...".  Ok, I started this.  Listen
the loud music has altered your reality.  Please read why this was started
and it was due to your insensitivity.

I never claimed to be egoless.

G-d help rave if this is what it's made up of.  With all the fights and
stabbings I have no doubt it is all in decline.

Maybe people should think before they post.  Consider the larger world.  As
for your defenders, I have mine as well.  Two camps and a flame war.  We
should just get in the ring at this point...

I don;t, but your intolerance and ignorance will not be tolerated by me.

-John  ; after coming to the realization that some of the newest people on
the list are also it's most intolerant.  PLUR & hugz & intolerance =
reality denial.

If you want to drop this now, I will. Take this private so we can spare the
list of this bullshit.

This is Gay Pride/History month.  To celebrate KQED has been showing some 
cool documentaries.

The two of note are the Harvey Milk Story (I think), which aired last 
night.  Excellent documentary and very timely considering many of the 
problems in the scene.

It basically details the rise of Harvey Milk to the Supervisory position 
here in the city.  Notabgle because he was the first openly gay man to do 
so in this country.  Even more notable is the political actions he and 
Mayor Moscone took that basically revolutionized the city.

Anyone even thinking about political action for our dance community might 
do well to watch this documentary since it basically outlines what it 
takes to win political power and influence here in the city.

Preachers note:
Every year there are a new crop of SFR people who want to do some form of 
action.  I think this documentary can show you how it can be done despite 
great odds.  If the dance community were to rise as the gay community did 
I think that there could be some change in many areas.  Food for thought.

The other ppiece is The Castro which shows how the Castro came to be 
along with what the community faces as it approaches it's thrid decade of 
existence.

Very cool stuff take a look.


Peace,
John

 Take your mouse pointer and put it on the down arrow

After this last round of flames I have to make a choice, I should either 
run for office or write a book.  I don;t have time for any more writing 
other than SFraves, so I think my time is better spent running for office.

The job I want:  Supervisor, then later on Mayor of San Francisco.
why?          :  I can do the job, and finally you'll get someone in 
office who will listen and argue for you, endlessly.

Platform:  Freedom.  Decriminalization of drugs, decriminalization of all 
sex acts between consenting adults (this includes prostitution), opening 
up housing in the presidio to the homless and first time home buyers, 
stopping that dreaded stadium from  being built and putting more money into:
Better schools for kids (the schools in SF are a shambles, I hate sending 
my kid to public school, even if it is the best one in SF), clean 
(steamed cleaned) sidewalks, help for vets and the homeless who have 
mental problems so that they may live in a safe and clean environment, 
the development of these open vacant lots into green space for the city.  
No new skyscrapers, and no more giveaways to the corporations in SF.

Other kool stuff I wanna do:  All fiber telco service.  More than 1 cable 
company and a demand that cable rates be dropped by 10%.  A police review 
board with teeth and a demand that abusive police are to be fired if 
found guilty by the review board.  More muni buses, and a demand that 
they be on time all the time.  A demand that city officials be required 
to take public transport 6 months out of the year.  Change the permitting 
process and cabaret laws to allow people to gahte r peacfully on public 
land for entertainment purposes (non-profit of course).

A return to district elections, NOW!  All meetings are to adhere to the 
sunshine law and as such there should never be decisions made in SF where 
the public is not allowed input.

Real rent control and a change in the way landlords can raise rents.

Revitilization efforts that attempt to build strong communities from 
within w/o the spectre of gentrification to solve the economic problems 
of blighted areas.

Maintenance and preservation of the flavor of the various SF communities.

And of course, one free party a year, our version of Maardi Gras where 
the city shuts down, we shut down the length of market street and have 
one massive block party where the residents come out and play with each 
other for once.

Change of the campaign laws such that the maximum contribution from any 
person or organization is limited to $1,000.  Free airtime during the 
election on stations operating in SF, and weekend elections.

When I am elected there will be a rave, a paraty whatever you want to 
call it, right on the embarcadero inb one of those warehouses.  Jungle, 
House, Breakbeat, Trance, Techno, and garage will be spun by the best 
DJ's in the bay area.  Free water and chewing gum will be the course of 
the day.  Food to be supplied by Millenium and Brother-In-laws barbeque 
on Divisadero (for the caracas lovers and vegans among us), also Thep 
Phanom, New Asia, Zarzola, and Meykadeh will prvide food to show the rich 
diversity that is SF.

Besides, if you do vote for me there is one great side benefit - I will 
not have time to rant and flame on SFRaves.

So I ask, tired of me goin on and on.  Vote!
Tired of my good guy bad guy and wish I would be very consistent but 
somehow I just don't get it and need something to better occupy my time?  
Vote!
Tired of Johnny Law busting your party while asking for kickbacks?  Vote!
Tired of this city being sold to the highest bidder  while you struggle 
to find a place to live here?  Vote!

Vote for me, togehter we can accomplish so much:
-A better SF
-And a much quieter list.

Vote for me and we both win!

Love hugz and bliss with sprinkles of hope,
John S. Lee

and PLUR to you all.

P.S.  I am going into politix, I love PLUR and always have, I also love 
glitter, and always have.  If voted in office I promise to be blissful 
and happy.  Besides, I do want to get elected and there's no need to piss 
off a large vocal consituency.  I'll just change my stripes, not for me, 
but for the betterment of SF.

See you one of these Novembers.

P.P.S.  My girlfirend actually thinks I would have a chance.  Damn this 
is a strange world.

Much peace,
John

I was checkin out the calander, and noticed the following:

   Saturday, June 28th - Fuzz-E and Kick Drum presents _Alternate_
   RE: (live), Kei. Lem (live), Dre (live), Neme (live), Loren, Mark
   Pedras, Markus Mark, J.P..
   Visuals by Mark Johns.
   Kick Drum Bionic Audio
   Sacramento. 916.484.4040
 
I'm pretty sure we (RE:) are the only ones playing live at this party.  I
believe that Lem, Dre, and Neme are dj's.  Eric and I are really looking
forward to playing this party, and we've asked a friend from Sac (Jason) to
join us.  He writes really great mellow d&b, and he's never played out
before. Should be alot of fun for everyone.

Well First off DJ'ing is not something that comes easy it takes time.
Well there are those that start spinning and pick it up after a few
months? For me it took a long time and I still have trouble but I have
never taken or studied music in my life. (no excuse BTW) but Match the
Beat and not the clap or high hats. I started by mixing the clap and
it is easy and it will stay on for a while but then it will trail off.
Start with 4/4 beats or break beat those are pretty simply. and have a
lot of patients and a lot of money cause this hobby is expensive. You
have a small Idea you have seen me in the rekkid store from time to
time and you see how much rekkids cost. They aint cheap for those that
dont know.

Peace,love,cyber sex!!!!

One of the biggest mistakes I made when trying to learn to mix was 
wearing headphones and relying upon them to mix.  What I mean by that is 
at one time, due to limitations in my studio, I had no choice but to 
listen to the mix in my headphones, this made it very easy to develop bad 
mixing habits.

First thing I would suggest is getting some monitor(s) set up, you really 
need only 1, but I use twso because I often drop the headphones to listen 
to the overall mix.

When mixing be sure to listen to with the record to be mixed w/o any 
monitoring of the record playing through the headphones.  In other words, 
the monitors should have the record you want to mix into, the headphones 
should have the record you want to mix "in".  Separation is the key, and 
you have to train your ear and head to listen to two disparate things w/o 
freaking out about the beat.

"Loosen" your ear and listen to the one.  The first bad habit, and the 
one that is most difficult to break is coming in too fast, everyone has a 
problem with this when first starting. What I mean by the one is the 
first bass or drum kick that signals the start of the 4/4/ pattern, bka 
the one.  Finding this part is essential to making the match work.

Once you find the one, the first bass kick or the first beat, backcue to 
the very start of that beat and begin to listen to the monitor to hear 
where the other record is at.  It is not enough to match the bass or the 
beat, but more importantly to know where you are in a record.  It's all 
4/4 so it should be easy.  If you're in the middle of the break, wait 
until the break is over, if your in the middle of the phrase, wait until 
the phrase is done.  I n other words wait for the "one" on the record 
you're going to mix into.  Patience, since you'll miss this over and over 
again until your ear is trained as to how the music is composed.

But you won;t wait and you'll rush then you'l l do the other nasty 
thing...touching the record!  Yikes.  When you're beginning it is very, 
very natural to do this, just remeber, that twisting the spindle, or 
working the record is just one thing.  You're doing that to get tocatch 
up or slow down to that evasive "one" so that the records sync up.  
Remember to use the pitch to make your adjustment "stick".  twisting the 
spindle w/o making immediate corrections to the pitch will guarantee that 
your mix will fall all over the place.  Once you master the concept of 
touching the record while adjusting the pitch it will be time for you to 
stop touching the record altogether, using only the pitch (except to cue 
it up of course).

Tip:  When changing records, don't touch the pitch.  You want to 
immediately know whther or not you will need to slow down or speed it 
up.  It is harder to do  if you move the pitch before giving you a chance 
to see whther you need to adjust at all.  Often times there is little 
variation if the same RPM is used between records, so check the status of 
the beat before adjusting anything on the record you're mixing in.

If there's one thing I cannot stand in opaque mixing.  I hate to hear 
so-called paid professional DJ's touch the record to the point where you 
can tell, in the mix, when it is slowed down or speeded up.  Jeno is 
really good at this and, for the most part, his transitions are 
transparent, and that's what you want to strive for transparency.  It 
should be one endless song w/o any perceivable tempo changes.  this will 
take time, and plenty of trainwrecking.

The other piece of advice I can offer is hook up with a DJ in a 1:1 and 
get schooled.  If someone will take you in, get your records and play 
with that person, kindof a tag team.  But what you really want  to do is 
watch the technique and listen to HOW the DJ sounds.  When it's your turn 
up you will find youself using some of the techniques you've been 
watching.  I think this is eesential for becoming a good DJ, tutoring can 
only help, and the DJ will be able to give you pointers as to why 
something did or didn;t work.

Most of all stick with it, in 3 years of playing records I have found my 
skills grow signifigantly, to the point where I even school my teacher in 
my techniques at times.

Becuase of him, I never touch records, I use the pitch exclusively to 
mix, and I can mix differnt styles, change tempo and be fairly 
transparent in the mix.

Oh yeah I forgot rule #1:  MAKE TAPES of EVERY SESSION.  Why?  Unless 
you're a working DJ and have tons of spare time, you will not have much 
time to learn your records and leaarn your mistakes.  Listening to a tape 
of your sessions accomplish two things.  First of all you can hear what 
went right or wrong, secondly you get the benefit of listening to the 
music over and over and over again, basically learning the record, 
essential for any competent DJ.  thridly, when it is time to make a tape 
you're not so frightened by it's use so when the time comes for a 
mixtape, you'll have far lesds anxiety than someone who is not used to 
being taped.

I know a DJ who is damn good, but he is paralyzed by tape players.  The 
reason:  Every mistake can be heard and he is not used to being taped and 
knowing about it.  Since I have been taping myself for years that is one 
thing I never go through when making a mixtape for friends.

Take your time...lsiten to the music..and have some mad fun.  
Beatmatching is only the beginning...once that rudiment is down it's time 
to start getting good at putting togehter your music and the real fun can 
begin.

Good luck Dj's of the future,
jsl

Suggest that anyone who gets bad stuff at Raves or Clubs post info about it
as a warning to others who may have some unused stuff in their pockets.
Beware of fat white pils with the lettter "E" on them. Very bad stuff.

I have to say to Chris, that John's points are good ones, although the
amount of flaming it took to to do it may have been a bit much.  The has
made this explanation a few times in a couple of different ways, but the
best was this one:

>You are very wrong.  I hear crap like this often enough that I had a
>response waiing and ready.  The type of intolerance you aspouse is very
>common here in CA.  The bay area is no exception.  And you sir seems to
>embody the rule rather than the exception:
>-Make a racial faux pas
>-tryo to explain it as harmless
>-a response is given
>-we go down in flames.
>

Chris, no one really thinks you are an overt racist of the KKK type (John's
bitingly satirical comments aside).  The statement you made did have racist
overtones.  I believe you when you said you did not mean it that way, but we
often do things we don't realize, and in this case it was offensive and
disrespectful.  The apology that John asked for would not be for purposefuly
being racist, but to recognize the fact that a mistake was made, and that
you (and so many of us, including myself) need to keep constantly aware of
the racist currents that still remain in the language we use and the culture
we live in, because these things impact the way we act and talk, and we
sometimes just can not see it.

Take care.

Kerry

Hey Kids,

		Well here I sit going through this mail and all it really is, is flame
after flame! Now this upsets me. Come on people why not take the energy your
waisting on writing usless garbage and write something postive. You *can*
voice your opion without being rude or bringing other people down. Why is it
so important to rant and rave about something that diden't even happen? It
really makes me sad to see all of this, you know what flames are to me, there
gossip, gossip that is throwed around for a day or two untill there is
something better to talk about! Now is flames: in other words *talking shit*
really worth it? I thought we were people who send peace, love unity and
respect, not only to each other but to the world. Do any of you think flaming
is being a loving person?

	If we dont get back down to basics and what we are all really about, our
scene will die. Ok maybe not the massive, but at least the UG. I hear so many
people say that the UG parties in SF are *so* diffrent then any other, that
we have this beautiful conection and love for one another, and to me that is
*so* true. We should be proud that we are looked upon like that, shoulden't
we try to keep it that way?

	Its time we look into ourselfs and find what really is important, lets lay
this *shit talking* to rest  and get back to the reason we are all  part of
this scene. Isen't it about time?


staying connected,
Amanda

that's one thing i love about uncle noah, 
he may be old school but he doesn't ever seem 
to flame the younger new schoolers. and rather than 
condescending them, me, us, whatever, he brings out 
points that are important and makes us realize that,
hey! it's not all about glitters and stickers 
and tickle me elmos. it's about the music, and the 
family thang. and he still kicks back with us and gives 
big hugs :)

my raver friends are still my friends.
so are a lot of the new school ravers on here. 
we'll get together once in a while, talk about our troubles, 
try to cheer each other up, go over each other's houses and 
spin records (or try to:), hang out and joke around, and 
just help each other in need.

WE'RE NOT ALL SUPERFICIAL RAVER KIDS 

when i came up with the humboldt party idea i talked to many 
raver friends whom i've met from going to several parties 
or just kickin back with. they were all more than happy to 
help, even the ones who just met me were more than happy to 
help out, whether it be spinning for free, donating money for 
misc. costs, lending their vans, donating their time and effort 
to help out with visuals, lighting, whatever it takes, just to 
throw a party for our neighbors up north. 
this is what i call love. 

we're not doing it to make money. (we would've made it a free 
party but there were lots of expenses. even so, the money we make 
are being donated to crews to help throw future parties) we're 
just a bunch of friends getting together helping each other out, 
having fun, being together, working together, being able to joke 
and laugh together, "hey baby, i see you have braces, huh huh i 
have braces too :)", and making new friends up in humboldt.

i remember the thursday before Wonderland. a bunch of friends in 
andy's garage painting mushrooms, making flowers laughing and 
talking; from cool music to relating to problems we've all had. 
i walk in and suddenly see smiling faces from parties i've been 
to. "hi veann! haven't seen you in a while! what have you been up 
to?" i take off my jacket and plop onto the floor to help paint. 
we all laugh and giggle, get paint on our clothes, mess up and 
give shrooms two eye balls...
in the other room, annie may practices spinning and people smile 
dance etc etc...

a lot of these friends of mines, *certain people* call them 
childish, stupid glittered up, silly frog back pack hanging off 
their shoulders, pacifier sucking people who need to "grow up." 
and that they go to parties acting fake.
i think this is a lack of respect. i think sometimes, because 
certain people are older and tend to know more about certain 
things and are jaded by certain scenes, they tend to become more 
static. rather than saying "hey! these new ravers are dressed
differently but it's cool! i can still hang out with them or try to 
get to know them," they isolate themselves from these *candy ravers*, 
stereotyping them before they really get to know them. i know, 
i've done this too, so i think it's just a reflex everyone has 
once in a while.

but my point is, how do *you* know we're acting fake? how do you 
know we're not genuinely happy to see our old friends or make 
new ones? because some of us may do a bit too much stuff and act 
like tweekers? because we like to dress up differently? because 
we haven't been in the scene 4, 5 or 6 years like you? because we 
like sucking on lollipops and pacifiers so we don't grind our teeth? 
because we're not perfect and make mistakes sometimes or are
misunderstood,
we don't know what PLUR means?

i can't speak for all ravers. i know some are in the scene as an 
escape from the real world, some for music, some for drugs, and 
there will be tons of other reasons. but i hate when certain people
criticize a whole group of people "ie. the new schoolers" for 
lacking PLURity. i know my friends and i practice plur. we may 
not always be perfect and sometimes forget. (i know i did. i'm 
sorry about the clubber post.) 

but ultimately there are a lot of us who still believe in hope.
PLUR does not suck. sometimes it may be cheesy and overused but 
it is a philosophy that we can try to live by.
to live in peace.
love and care for one another.
work together in unity.
and respect one another.

when i meet someone, 
or when i see someone i've met at a party before,
and i hug them,
i genuinely smile because i'm genuinely happy to see them :)

i'm still learning as i grow older. my views and morals grow as 
i do. 
when i'm 30 and still raving, and there's a new breed of 
ravers, with psychedelic tattoos on their foreheads, and bright 
colors rings attached to their eyeballs, i hope i won't be too 
jaded by then to keep an open mind. 
i hope i won't criticize and judge and condescend.
i hope i'll be like uncle noah and still party like a mad man :)

see you all at *IN THE BEGINNING* 
i'll be with my old school camera and 7 rolls of b/w film. so i 
better catch a picture of you! ;)

<genuine hugs>

Thank you to everyone who wished me a happy birthday!!!
I had a great day, being 23 isn't so bad. All those who asked me how it
feels - well, I don't mind it. Acutally, this is going to be a great
year.
I'm getting married, some of my best friends are moving to the city in
August, job is great, and I have all of you. What more could I want?

I hope to see you all soon!
Thanks again!
yours,
claudia

geek boy speaking;

This might sound a little harsh, I'm open to comment upon it...

I've configured the list now to only allow folks to post up to three
messages per day.  If you post a fourth, you get back an error message with
your original post, so you can send it the next day if you really want to.
I believe 3 is a totally reasonable number - if you disagree let me know
privately.  

Thanks,

	Brian

Would all promoters please set aside a rave free weekend?
I need to have a party free weekend sometime and I can't do it on my 
own.  
I *need* help.  
I need to do things other than go to parties on the weekend.  So if 
everyone could just help out a fellow Sick Raver it would be much 
appreciated.

Thank You in advance for your help.

        -chris>>

I'm deadly serious. I've never seen "Higher Learning," nor would I ever cop
social theory from a film.  This country was founded upon racism(remember
slavery?), and it continues to be a functional aspect of our society. We are
socially stratifed much more in terms of race in this country as opposed to
class, gender, etc. Those of us who were brought up here are taught from day
one how to differentiate each other in many ways, most significantly by that
nonsensical concept of race. Our parents, our friends, our schooling, our
media, even our religions constantly bombard us with notions of race, both
positive and negative. Unfortunately, those positive and negative notions
tend to fall strictly along very specific sides. I think John S. Lee's direct
quotes from the Webster's Dictionary prove this point. We are taught that
Black=bad and White=good.  When notions like this permeate a society to this
extent, to the extent to where it becomes an acceptable part of our very
language, it easy to understand how UNCONSCIOUS RACISM can exist. To deny
 any of this is to deny what it means to live in America in my opinion. And
in light of your comment, ..."deepest, darkest..." I think you understand
what I mean.

Chris, the bottom line is this: there are people on this list who have been
deeply offended by your comments. The question as to whether or not you
consider it valid that you have in fact offended anyone is moot. You should
apologize because people ARE offended by what you said.

If you're down with PLUR, I truly believe you would understand that.

I mentioned it before,  but you should'nt fight this. You 're on a path now
that will lead to a deeper understanding of this issue. If you want to ignore
it now, fine. But the seed has been planted and will grow in you whether you
like it or not.

See you on the dancefloor.

sheesh, don't you think that you are going waaay too far on this one?? 
give the guy a break.  writing a comment on crime in oakland does not 
make someone part of the kkk.  i'm sure he meant the comment just like 
deep dark dungeon or deep dark cellar,.  places that are dark are scary.  
it has to do with the amount of light in the area and nothing with a 
persons skin color.  i really can't see why you can interpret the word 
dark as having to do with african americans.  what, should that word now 
be banned?
later.

Tip:  When changing records, don't touch the pitch....

-=-=--=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-snipped-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

I've seen good and bad things happen to peeps when first starting out.
I was taught when first starting to try to always put the pitch back to
zero.  I'm not sure why this happens, perhaps from the shear enjoyment and
adrenaline rush, I found myself creeping the pitch control, continually
speeding up every song just a bit until I had none left.  Searching for
speeding up every song just a bit until I had no advancement left.

   Anybody else ever had that problem?

                                                                Eric

You didn't say anything "bad" about the event.  You merely stated a fact:
CJ Bolland will NOT be there, and he was the headlining dj.  That's reason
enough for me not to go.  No need for you to apologize for your statement.
It almost seems like you were threatened or something...  FTT will still
make plenty of money, I'm sure.  Do we really need posts commanding us to
go to their events?

i think all of us on this list owe John Lee a BIG thank u for helping
us see the light and for making this list soooo much more pleasant. 
Thank u john, without your guidance and wisdom i would not be the
person i am today, what u say means sooo much to me and has REALLY mad
an impact on me as a person AND my life.

i mean...what type of world would we live in if people like john
weren't around to sort things out for us and let us make our own
decisions.  I especially like his use of the english language in all
it's glory and splendid color (hmmmm...i better point out that color
in this reference has NOTHING to do with anything racial).

thank u JOHN S. LEE,

Yep yep, I'm looking at my flyer and Re is the only one playing live.  And the 
others are djs.

I will be there!  I haven't had a jungle/dn'b fix in months, and never in 
Sacramento . . . I'm juiced!  I'm not even sad I have to miss Area 51.  All 
Sac ravers should be there.  And don't forget to go to _United Vibes_ on 
Sunday, which is a free outdoor daytime event:

   Sunday, June 29th - Par3 Productions presents _United Vibes_
   DJ Sola, Markus, Brian Brazil, DJ Matthew, Karizma, Scot
   noon-10pm, Free, Sacramento.  916.484.4682

I'm excited, but then I love Sac parties--they're always UG . . . :-)  Plus 
I'm saving gas (that bay area commute is a mutha#%@&!!!).  But when are some 
of you djs on sfraves going to pay us a visit???  Most of the parties here 
have the usual hometown heroes (gotta love em, they get props cuz they know 
how to rock the party), but everyone needs a little variety . . .

xoxo--Miccaela

   Pedras, Markus Mark, J.P..

I'm pretty sure we (RE:) are the only ones playing live at this party.  I
believe that Lem, Dre, and Neme are dj's.  Eric and I are really looking
forward to playing this party, and we've asked a friend from Sac (Jason) to
join us.  He writes really great mellow d&b, and he's never played out
before. Should be alot of fun for everyone.

Hey everyone, I just got back on after three days of complications with
re-subscribing.  Now that I'm here what post greeted me?  How to offend
someone in the worst way possible...and how to do it publicly.  THis is not
the list I remember.  If another flame war starts, we will again lose a huge
amount of members.  I don't know what kind of conversations have been going
on while I was gone.. but if I was a newbie and didn't remember the good old
SFRaves, I would be signing off faster than you can click on the send button.
  That's just my $0.50

I don't really post a whole lot but I just read "The Long Boom" in the 
July issue of Wired and I would just like to recommend it to everyone. 
 It describes how the next 25 or so years could turn out and why they 
might turn out that way.  While it doesn't focus on them, two of the 
important factors it mentions for global prosperity are openness and 
diversity which I think we  strive for in the rave community.  The 
article also mentions the fact that leaders are necessary to promote 
this openness and diversity so that nations don't turn inward and 
allow the world to fragment into isolated blocks.  Maybe the world is 
ready to listen to what the rave community has to say, now we just 
need to tell them.

You know,

 I don't even have all my chit yet. And I am already lecturing my friend on
this bad "touching the record" habbit. I find that if you have to doctor
the record by touching it, or pinching the spindle thingie all the time.
You did NOT match the beats yet, and more tempo adjusting is in order.
 I only touch the record or spindle when, I did not come in exactly on my
cue. To either slow it down or speed it up, to get it where it was suppost
to be without having to wait for another cue nStuff.
 If you have to nurse the mix by touching the records like this all the
time, it is most likely that your mix will change the atmosphere alot
before it's over, sounding pretty...Sloppy..


 Am I right nStuff?

        It's cool that you have a similar approach to me when you approached
the tables. I played trombone for 4 years, but also played guitar for 8, and
I studied music rather intensively(you have to if you wanna play be-bop.) I
didn't have a problem beatmatching, however, it came quite quickly to me,
although I am by no means a master at it.

        A technique my friend DJ Flite(go Brett!)taught me was to learn to
keep the vinyl you are trying to match up in sync with your finger(s). You
keep twirling it with you finger, making minute adjustments, then with your
other hand you can adjust the slider until you feel you are no longer
applying force with you twirlin' hand. Then let go. It takes a while to get
used to this, but before I knew this I would set the speed, cue it up, then
let it go. If it wasn't matcher I would cue it back up and adjust the
slider. That took a while. This new method can get me beatmatched in 5 to 10
seconds. Which is great because with hardstep you really gotta mix it up to
keep it interesting. Hope this gives you some ideas.

although i am a 'newbie' to _this_ list, i too am tiring of all the
bickering, misunderstanding, jumping to conclusions.... i haven't seen the
likes of this on any other list. constructive debate is one thing, but htis
is a bit much. it's really funny, or sad, how we can call ppl names when
typing to a screen... i wonder if these ppl are as insensitive when talking
in person? i consider myself hyper-sensitive, and i'm sure there are others
out there like me. i've already gotten my feelings slightly hurt through
flaming... i feel really sad for chris, regardless of his intentions when
writing his original post.

well, i'll have to admit that i too can type off some things in the heat of
the moment and send w/o thinking... in the same way, i sometimes speak
without thinking. but i'm well aware of this flaw in my character, and
usually try to be a bit more aware of myself.

and what the fuck is plur anyway? i've seen so many different words
applied.... i don't even know anymore. then again, don't know if i ever
did? from what i remember, in the early '90s, we all felt some sort of
unity with others' who liked to do the same sort of thing - there was no
name to it - we just smiled knowingly at each other. it was a nice feeling;
a feeling that i don't sense much anymore. part of it may be my fault - i
do tend to find it hard to relate to someone who's 15+ years younger than
me! but there wasn't a conscious push for 'peace, love, unity...' we were
there having fun, and brought together by our love of a certain music and
lifestyle. that's it. no explanations needed. my belief in respect w/in the
'scene' (and i even hate this word) i think stems from this - we did have
respect for one another. if someone was sick, you helped them. if someone
needed something and you had it, you shared. we were friendly and open to
one another, but not in this sickeningly-sweet way of 'ooooh i love you let
me hug you and yadda yadda ya.' the only thing i can think to call that is
respect. this, it seems, has been lost along the way. there is no longer
one group of ppl; instead there are factions. some violent, which really
troubles me. guess i had a bit of an eye-opener this past weekend - a big
fat welcome to the big city. i was naive, now i know. i was hoping that
things would be like what i knew, but they aren't. the reason i support the
idea of a metal detector is precisely for this reason. things have changed,
whether we like it or not.

just a side comment, but how many of these new-skool pluralists are of
color? don't flame me, now, i've just seen over the years that this has
gotten to be a very white thing. which, as john writes, is sad. the
multi-cultural/ multi-personality aspect of this was one of the things i
loved the most - so many different kinds of ppl all brought together by the
love of one thing. hedonists, that's all, really. let's go have a blast and
fuck what society has taught us.

i can see why other ppl would use a pseudonym... here you have 450
strangers reading your mail.... privacy is an issue. why does it bother you
what ppl choose to call themselves?

don't know about being harrassed less when wearing form-fitting clothing.
again, why does it bother you what other ppl wear? stating that "there are
growm men around.  Despite all efforts at removing the sexual energy of
some males, we are intrinsically turned on by grown women dressed upo [sic]
as little girls" to me comes off as being very sexist. (correct me if you
disagree... if i have misinterpreted you here) first, women, from what i
understand (i being one of them), are more likely to dress for themselves
or for other women. despite what men think. second, men, control
yourselves. here you are admitting that you are nothing more than an animal
with uncontrollable desires. saying that we have to be responsible for
controlling your desires is rubbish. this is like saying that a woman
'asked' to be raped because of what she was wearing. para nara. welcome to
the 90s. we will wear what we want. i used to wear from-fitting clothes
(long time ago), and actually got a kick out of teasing men. this is no
longer the case. now i prefer to wear what's comfortable, especially when
it comes to dancing all night. no, i don't go around looking like i'm 3,
but i will wear what i want and not what you or anybody else wants. hello,
this is all a part of casting aside society's norms, which is what i
thought was a part of the rave culture.

this to me seems a bit much - you have dictated to the masses only how

ahem... haven't you just told us how we are to behave, dress, act? what's
the difference? as the saying goes (or something like this) sometimes you
have to support what's wrong in order to support what's right. this means,
in the case of freedom of speech, you have to tolerate what others say (do,
wear...), even if you strongly disagree, in order to maintain the freedoms
we have.

>Well I've said quite enough.  Some of you will want to flame me, save it.

this is not a flame. i agree with some of your points, disagree with
others. (freedom of speech, again.) a lot of it i found funny, if read in a
sarcxastic way. but i have no way of knowing if this was what you intended.

now this, at least to me, is a very _pre-old-skool_ attitude. when i was a
little new-waver (and in high school, i might add) we often snubbed our
noses to 'posers'. i don't know what a 'poser' in this community would be.
a lot of us dress the way we want, regardless of the current trend, listen
to what we want (techno and not), and do what we want. we come to raves to
dance our asses off. (or is that primarily an 'old-skool' thing? innocent
question) there are no 'posers' - we come because we want to, not because
it will make us 'kewl' (god, i hate that word the most!)

this is true to an extent - and i agreed with you before on it. some of us
do, tho, make good friends! ;) just beware of others, i suppose. there are
an awful lot of ppl who are so fucked up that they can't care for anyone
any longer. which is sad. here you can show how much you care by _helping_
those who really need it the most.

ahhh but saying "i wish rednecks like this would move to idaho and
interbreed in trailers where they belong" is.

after reading endless john s. lee threads, i've come to the conclusion
that he's an anal retentive, jaded, hypocritical, bitter, RACIST,
antagonistic man who has a god complex.

how can you blatantly ridicule chris p, call him a racist, an
intolerable mixture of nationalities, flame all these new ravers
saying they don't know how to act nowadays, condemn PLUR, treat us all
like we're all juvenile idiots who can't think for ourselves.
criticize the way we dress, the way we act, calling us fake....
yet you call us close minded... telling us to wake up to the "real
world." away from our little candyPLURlands...



wake up john. the real world doesn't revolve around you. 
yes this is a direct flame. i've never flamed anyone openly and 
this is perhaps the only time anyone will see it.

i don't believe a word john is saying. i think it's all bullshit to
start a flame war to break up our sfrave community. 

here's a word you should all learn for the day:

SCHADENFREUDE
one whose happiness depends on the anger and unhappiness of others.

okay, this post was unessesary but i had to do it... it was building
up inside of me all day.. i had hate seething from me.

okay.. okay.. i don't hate you anymore.. i just feel sorry for you.
something bad must have happened to you as a child.. (based on your
theory as to how we form our ideas) or are you just genetically an
asshole?

damn i just broke every rule of plur... see what mean people can do to
you??? =~{

Anybody listen to it yet?
The first time I put it on I hated it.
I'm listening to it again, and I think its great.
I don't know why my opinion has changed, but it doesn't sound the same
as it did the first time I played it.
Sounds really good, trippy, and catchy.
It's not the old tranquility bass stuff tho, that's for sure.

Haha fother mucker, when did they let you outa jail?  Welcome back anyhow...

RR-ish: A few weeks back, I was at Analog, when I noticed something neat.
There were a lot of people of color there.  Specifically there where a LOT
of African-Americans in attendance.  For some reason it surprised me, in a
good way. Why should that have surprised me?  Why should I find it odd that
we can all rave together?  I found myself wanting to go up to every black
person I saw having a good time and say something stupid like: "It's so
cool that you're here, tell all your friends to come next time, we need
more melanin in this house."  But, I couldn't find a good way to say it.
Still can't think of an inoffensive, non-patronizing way to phrase it.  

So, how do we encourage diversity?  How can we get more peoples of color to
experience the unity we call rave?

If we build it, they will come....

ChrisP- No more dead horses for me.

Supreme Court Applies Free-Speech to Internet
By James Vicini =


WASHINGTON (Reuter) - The Supreme Court extended free-speech
rights to cyberspace in a historic ruling Thursday, striking down a feder=
al
law that restricted indecent pictures and words on the Internet computer
network. =


The nation's highest court dealt the Clinton administration a major defea=
t
by declaring unconstitutional the law that made it a crime to transmit
sexually explicit material to anyone younger than 18. =


The high-profile case marked the first time the Supreme Court granted ful=
l
constitutional free-speech protections under the First Amendment to the
giant worldwide network of linked computers used by tens of millions of
people. =


The justices by a 7-2 vote ruled that all key parts of the Communications=

Decency Act violate free-speech rights, amounting to illegal government
censorship. =


"Notwithstanding the legitimacy and importance of the congressional goal
of protecting children from harmful materials, we agree ... that the stat=
ute
abridges 'freedom of speech' protected by the First Amendment," Justice
John Paul Stevens said for the court majority in the 40-page opinion. =


The law, signed by President Clinton in 1996 as part of a
telecommunications overhaul, barred distribution to minors of indecent or=

"patently offensive" materials on the Internet. It provided for fines and=
 a
maximum two years in prison. =


The law defined indecent as anything that "depicts or describes in terms
patently offensive, as measured by contemporary community standards,
sexual or excretory activities or organs." =


The law did not target obscenity or child pornography, which already were=

illegal. The Internet indecency law has never taken effect because of the=

court battle. =


The ruling represented a major victory for the American Civil Liberties
Union (ACLU) and groups representing libraries, publishers and the
computer on-line industry, which brought the lawsuit challenging the law.=
 =


ACLU attorney Stefan Presser said, "Essentially the Supreme Court of the
United States took an idea from the 18th century, that is free speech, an=
d
said it has enduring quality, and will extend into the 21st century, beca=
use
government will not be allowed to censor what's on the Internet." =


Clinton said he would study the decision, gather people representing
industry, parents, teachers and librarians to review it, and continue to =
look
for a way to keep children from viewing pornography on the Internet. =


"With the right technology and rating systems we can help ensure that our=

children don't end up in the red light districts of cyberspace," he said =
in a
statement. =


The Supreme Court said the rapidly growing Internet deserved full First
Amendment protection, citing its unique characteristics as a public forum=

for the exchange of ideas and information. =


The high court rejected arguments that the Internet was similar to the
television and radio industries, where there has been a history of extens=
ive
government regulation and where indecent speech may be restricted. =


"The (Communications Decency Act) is a content-based regulation of
speech," Stevens said. "The vagueness of such a regulation raises special=

First Amendment concerns because of its obvious chilling effect on free
speech." =


"As a matter of constitutional tradition ... we presume that governmental=

regulation of the content of speech is more likely to interfere with the =
free
exchange of ideas than to encourage it," Stevens said. =


Chief Justice William Rehnquist and Justice Sandra Day O'Connor agreed
that the law was unconstitutional in that it would restrict adults' acces=
s to
material they otherwise would be entitled to see. =


Writing for the two, O'Connor said they would invalidate the law only in
those circumstances. That part of the court's ruling was unanimous. =


But O'Connor said for the two dissenters that she would uphold other
restrictions that prohibited the use of indecent speech in communications=

between an adult and one or more minors. =


In his statement, Clinton said, "The Internet is an incredibly powerful
medium for freedom of speech and freedom of expression that should be
protected. But there is material on the Internet that is clearly inapprop=
riate
for children ... We must give parents and teachers the tools they need to=

make the Internet safe for children." =

Ethan,

Got a question for you. At the F8 2nd anniversery you played a very
enjoyable set that was more or less straight trance. Trance fit the F8
theme, and seems to fit the outdoors thang really well for me.

At the 2 previous gigs where I saw you spin (Harmony massive and that
benifit where I could hardly recognize you in drag), you spun what I
thought was another style. I don't remember too well, but that other
style seemed harder, more crunchy, and more minnimalistic. What do you
call that style of music? Are you moving away from trance, back to
something more pure or onto something more fresh? Or were my ears
deceived?

Curiously,

I'm going to Happy Kids and I'd love to hook up with a bunch
of people to go.  Anyone got car space?  or, alternately, I could
drive but I don't know my way around here yet so I'd need a
navigatrix.

I have to agree with Christine (cricket) on this one...
I went to a party in Oregon a while ago (dec or jan) and it was the same 
way.  Picture this: 3 in the morning, lots of sporty adidas stuff, 
amazing lighting & lazers, good music, and me with a bag full of 
blo-pops and an arm full of bracelets, and an empty address book due to 
the lack of a vibe.  I walked around the whole night trying to talk to 
people with no luck.  The whole party wsa like, 50% "I'm dancing don't 
talk to me" people and 50% "I'm e-ing with my boyfriend/girlfriend don't 
talk to me" people.  LAME!  

Happy me, I found 3 sweet girls and 1 boy about 5 in the morning sitting 
outside smoking (near where the line was) saying hi and bye to every 
person that passed.  I gave them bracelets and smiles and promised them 
that if they ever came to SF that I'd take 'em to a party full of people 
just like them.  

They didn't think that suck parties existed.

Be happy that we have as much love in our scene as we do!!!  It's a rare 
thing!  You can't just say "oh well.  when the vibe dies here, I'll just 
move" because there's nowhere to move to!  We have the best vibe on 
earth (I think)!  So celebrate it and love it, okay?  Thank you.

what color do you want his friends to be?
whats wrong with brown?  are brown people somehow not people of color? 
is chris P somehow not a person of color because he is mixed race? i
don't want to start all this crap all over again, but as a person that is
mixed race i want to know what you are talking about.  if you think chris
p needs more friends that are black, say that.  but don't go around
saying that people who have brown skin are not people of color.  I have
never met chris p but he says he is half vietnamese.  doesn't that make
HIM a person of color?  he isn't white.

Last night, I went with my dingdong friends to VSF because it was Dudes'
birthdays, and they're sort of cheese, but it was fun, blah blah,
ANYWAYS...

I was up on the roof, and I was moving past a baldheaded black dude, and I
said 'Excuse me, cuz,' like cuz as in cousin.

He sort of took this strangely.  He told me that I should think twice
before saying that to black dudes, because some (not him, but some) would
take it. personally, and take it the wrong way, and that it might not be
good for my health in general to call black guys 'cuz.'

So, in any case, I invited him to sit down with my friend and have a
smoke.  My friend is a light-skinned black dude with dreads, really
spectacular looking guy, model-type, etc.

So, my friend and this other guy started talking about me calling him
'cuz' and all that stuff, and I wasn't really paying attention because
Alexa was sitting on my lap, but all the sudden, my friend says to the guy
I had brushed past (in reference to me):  'That kid is my nigga.'

Several times in my life, black friends of mine have referred to me as
their 'nigga' when trying to explain/justify/introduce/whatever me to
other black people.

I don't particularly dress or talk in an 'urban' (for lack of a better
word) way.  I definitely don't look country western, but I have sort of
longish curly hair, and I wear a lot of silly clothes.  When I get drunk,
I speak in a more relaxed jargon that reflects on the sort of mixed
environment I've grown up on, a sort of honkebonics, as we say.

But it always astounds me when all the sudden I'm someone's 'nigga.'
Of course, it feels good that a friend would use, such a hmmm... personal
word in reference to me.  Personal doesn't sound right.  What I'm
trying to say is that there is a lot of weight attached to the word
'nigga,' and as a wee honkey lad, it always makes me feel like I'm doing
the right thing when I get called that.

I would love to hear people's reactions to this, and I suppose I should
mention that the high school I went to was 30% Latin 30% White 20% Black
10% Polynesian and 10% Asian of some variety.  Word to M-A!

ANYWAYS..............

There is a GRIP of shit that could be done tonight, there are 3 new-to-me
deejays at Phunkateck, there's the WuTangstep party at the Casanova, etc
etc, what are yall fittin to do?

Paz,
SAGA/MAX

Hi,
First I'd like to thank all who emailed me about CJ Bolland's cancelling
his US tour. I did not want to send out an email without receiving official
confirmation from his management, which I just received. ORGANIC is still
going on. Fortunately, some friends of ours from Australia are in town
mixing a new CD and will be replacing CJ Bolland's slot. Sugar Ray and Phil
Smart from down under. FTT apologises for the inconvenience caused.

Friday 27th June

Try this joke on instead!


      A helicopter was flying around the northwest region yesterday when
 an electrical malfunction disabled all of the aircraft's electronic
 navigation and communications equipment. Due to the clouds and haze,
 the pilot could not determine the helicopter's position and course to
 steer to the airport. 

      The pilot saw a tall building, flew toward it, circled, drew a
 handwritten sign, and held it in the helicopter's window. The pilot's
 sign said, "WHERE AM I?" in large letters. People in the tall building
 quickly responded to the aircraft, drew a large sign, and held it in a
 building window. Their sign said, "YOU ARE IN A HELICOPTER."
 
      The pilot smiled, waved, looked at his map, determined the
 course to SEATAC airport, and landed safely. After they were on the ground,
 the co-pilot asked the pilot how the "YOU ARE IN A HELICOPTER" sign helped
 to determine their position. The pilot responded, "I knew we were in
 Seattle, and that had to be the MICROSOFT building because they gave me a
 technically correct, but completely USELESS answer."

bye for now...

This should have been sent this morning, but it wasn't, this should be my
last post on the subject, it's my last post of the day for sure.

First, never again will I respond to any thread that is started by another
Chris, people cant seem to tell us Chris' apart.  The Chris who
accidentally started all this, is from Berkeley.  I, ChrisP, who knows
better than to use color in any post to Sfraves somehow became a target for
Trigger Happy John.  (sounds like a jungle band, eh?)  I can't wait for
people to come up to me this weekend and say: "You don't look half
Vietnamese".  I'm not, that's the other Chris.  Strange coincidence: I have
Cherokee grandparents too.

Second, I'd like to apologize for the useless negative flame I posted from
my house last night.  As of 5:00 yesterday I was quite proud of SFRaves for
not letting a touchy topic degenerate into stupid name calling.  Then along
comes John...  

What I wanted to say, (I should have ignored John's personal attacks) was
this: It is human nature for us to instinctively fear anything we consider
different. It is a survival instinct to mistrust those we don't identify
with.  Racism, classicism, sexism, and lots of other *.isism's stem from
this basic truth.  This is how humans evolved, and you can't expect to undo
1000 years of evolution with some silly presidential commission (read the
paper), or by calling each other names (read last nights messages.)  The
root cause of all this is very basic, humans beings will favor those they
feel they have something in with.  This effects everyone, we all behave
this way, it's inate.  It's not possible to treat everyone in the same way,
someone has to loose.  I believe this problem can only get worse until we
begin to identify ourselves as humans first, race, class, etc., second.
That's one of the great successes of the rave community, we all get
together on the dance floor, and for a while, we achieve unity through
dance.  For a while we forget what color, sex, age, we are and we JUST ARE.
 
When I first started lurking here, what impressed me most wasn't the
descriptions of parties or the fuzzy star hugs, but the intelligent, witty
discussion that went on about touchy subjects.  Religion, race and
politics, were discussed in a civilized manner, and that's what got me
hooked on the SFRaves scene.  The idea that ravers were intelligent
individuals, who could discuss their views eloquently was not something I
considered until I found this list. Needless to say the 6 months have been
disappointing.

ChrisP <-- just one of many chirs'

I'm heading off to the "Continent" in mid July.  I hear each country
has their own vibe goin'.  I don't know what to expect, but I'm looking
forward to the discovery process.  Can anyone offer me any advice on where
to go, what not to miss, places to avoid, people to do, things to meet?
We're cruising through Spain, France, Netherlands, Germany, Prague, Italy,
and Greece.  

I want to bring a big fat bag of sf rave related goodies, like
mix-tapes, flyers, laminates, etc, to spread the san francisco vibe.  
If anyone would like to contribute to the big fat bag let me know.  I will
be a little harbinger of peace.  Rave outreach for the new millenium.

I'll be at Area 51 this Saturday wearing my red flashlight specs and an
orange shirt.  Short black hair, almond eyes, always bouncing, hopping or
skipping.  I'll give you a hug if I see you see me.  

Yum-yum,
geOrgeOrgeOrge

Whats up with this?

>Now go wear your white gown somewhere else,
>John S. Lee - Black to the future.

Isn't this racist? Isn't this as bad as saying "white power"
 And if you were president you would paint the white house black right?
 White gown? What does this mean exactly? Does this mean white people are
panzees?
 What exactly are you getting at?

Did someone get up and say "two wrongs make a right"?
Is "bush wacked" a racial slurpy?


Hmmm.

hi.

um, not to discount or discredit anyone's conviction or passion for the
topic, but can this racial thread please stop?  at least in being cc'ed to
the entire mailing list?  i weed through enough email in one day and the
last thing i want to do is read bicker about something that we should have
a common goal to transcend.

transcend:  v. 1. to rise above; to surmount; as, *lights in the heavens
transcending the region of clouds.* -- howell  2.  to pass over; to go
beyond; to exceed.  such popes shall transcend their limits.  -- bacon
that is all.

thank you for your attention.

love,
lola

No. Not really,

 I too try to keep it at it's normal tempo. Or what sounds normal to me.
 But that volume knob! Sheeesh! It gets louder and louder!  Ah!!  Soon, you
find yourself having to keep the incoming song volume at normal, while
turning down the playing record, and turning up the master volume at the
same time. which makes it sound like the volume you are not touching is the
one actually getting louder. Then I have to turn the master volume down
while I am turning the sterio volume up! That way my master volume don't
get maxed out, and I can go another 20db on my next mix. But, I mean, you
can never have it to loud. Right guys? Come on......Guys?   Oh...

Welp. Thats three... See you all tomorrow!  Sheeesh.

Tip:  When changing records, don't touch the pitch....

-=-=--=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-snipped-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

I've seen good and bad things happen to peeps when first starting out.
I was taught when first starting to try to always put the pitch back to
zero.  I'm not sure why this happens, perhaps from the shear enjoyment and
adrenaline rush, I found myself creeping the pitch control, continually
speeding up every song just a bit until I had none left.  Searching for
speeding up every song just a bit until I had no advancement left.

   Anybody else ever had that problem?

Dear folks,

Recently i met a few people on the list who didn't recognize my name (ah,
horror!) .. so clearly I haven't been spouting off and preaching my motherly
advice lately... and thus, i now give you some observations from the fairy
rave mother.

take it or leave it ... it's up to you.  These are *my* observations, from
*my* perspective ... but some of it may be helpful to some of you.

-----

NEVER assume that this list is filled with people like you.  There are young
people, old people, new-schoolers, old-schoolers, straight, gay, men, women,
people of every color and combination of colors, people who live on your
block and people on other continents. Some of us are fuzzy-plurry-folk, and
some are jaded and cynical. We're all different, and we see the world
differently.  The ONLY commonality is an interest in the rave scene.

------

There are people on this list who use it to satisfy their own agendas.  Some
of whom (apparently from the multiple postings, one after the other, beating
the dead horses to death) seem to have no life outside making their "points"
on sfraves.  Some of these people will take their obnoxious personalities
out on you, and they will twist your words.  If you don't want them to do
that, then don't reply to them.  It's that easy.

-----

When you post something that addresses anything that could be construed as
racist or sexist or whatever .... you will be flamed.  Think carefully about
how you word your messages, because you *will* be called on to defend what
you say.  So read and re-read what you're about to post as your opinion to
450+ people. 

-----

Vulgar language is offensive.  Use it and I, among others, will assume that
you are a vulgar, offensive person.  And I, among others, will conclude that
what you say is not of value -- because, frankly, to me, if you can't make
your point without name-calling, personal attacks and profanity, then your
intellectual capacity to construct a thoughtful argument is clearly
sub-standard, and as a result, your opinions are questionable.

_____

Just because it's email doesn't mean you're talking to a computer or a
faceless row of words.  You're talking to a real person with a history, a
viewpoint, and until you've met that person face to face, and had a real
live conversation with them, then you really don't know who you're talking
to.  Never assume.  Some of the ones who sound the nastiest on here are not
that way in person .... and some of them are.  Until you meet them, you
don't know which is which.  

-----

Starting rumors on sfraves is an irresponsible and damaging thing to do.  It
can damage the unwary subjects of the rumors in many ways.  This "death"
thread is case in point ... it was WRONG information, and yet we've had
hundreds of posts that have continued to promote this misinformation.  Use
your head, don't be sucked into assumptions just because you read it
somewhere.  And pay attention to the subject line of the posts you're
responding to... don't just keep copying something over and over after
you've learned that it was in fact not true.  

_____

Personal attacks should be *personal*.  Copying 450+ people with your
lame-brained nasty attacks and battles is rude and it is wrong.  If you get
your rocks off slinging your insults, go for it.... but not in front of
everyone.  Take it private, and keep it private. This goes beyond
netiquette, it is about behaving like an adult and keeping private
disagreements private. 

____

If you feel a need to post to SFRaves more than a couple of times a day,
please get a life.  This list is a way to share information, not someone's
personal forum to rant and rave, and not just a way to keep busy by sharing
your happy-day wishes with your friends.  

_____

Some people on this list like to be disruptive.  They disappear for long
periods of time, then return and stir up shit just to see what happens.
Why? I'm not a shrink, so my conjecture about their mental state is not
important. But DO NOT let them pull you into their manic crap.  Ignore it,
rise above it, don't get sucked in.  They only thrive on your resistance.
Don't give them the pleasure of your participation in their battles.

_____

It is clearly an ongoing challenge to keep SFRaves a forum for intelligent
and positive discussions about what we have in common -- we love music and
dancing.  Each person can do their part by raising their own standards of
behavior on the list ... sometimes that means refusing to be baited by a
shit-stirrer, and sometimes it means spending some extra time to make your
posts thoughtful and informative.  Sometimes it means apologizing for
something you said that you regret.  Be conscious that this is *our* list,
and every one of us can help keep the standards high.  

This doesn't mean you can't disagree with other people .... just do it with
respect and thought, and disagree on ideas and concepts ... listening to and
learning other people's viewpoints can only make you a better person.

I've left the list a couple of times due to job changes and lack of a
computer...  and when i come back, i often find that the rude and cynical
have taken to running roughshod over the unsuspecting newbies, which really
raises my hackles.

That's why, if i can possibly avoid it, I'm not going anywhere ... because
if the people who care about SFRaves leave (as they often do in desperation
during these exhausting and ridiculous flame wars), then the ones left
behind will suck the life right out of the true possibilities for what this
list is. 

Don't let that happen, folks, because when SFRaves is good, it's very very
good .... 

Leslie

YAAAAAH HEEEYYYY !!!!  :)  :)  :)

finally someone said something that is really down to what's really
going on here.

i didn't want to say anything because i do NOT want to get flamed or
make enemies, esp. w/ being a guest here and all, but...

the great big difference between the rave scene in england and here is
that you guys know each other too well. there's cliques and 'families'
and groups and tribes and every group is bitching about the others.
and don't deny it. i've heard you!

i know it's just human...but wasn't the idea of raving (at least in
the beginning) this wonderful feeling of tolerance, unity, belonging,
a huge family wherever you go? knowing that you can go to a rave
anywhere and you're at home?

is it really inevitable that all movement finally split up and become
tribal and eventually self-destruct in petty wars?

personally i will not get sucked into a clique or tribe and i would
love to continue tribe-hopping here in sf if you let me. (please?!)

see you all at area 51

I don't mean this to sound rude in any way... But if you are so enlightened
and would like people to be more accepting of each other, maybe you should
try to HELP the situation. When you throw harsh words back at someone who you
consider to be a racist or whatever, this only sets us back farther. If you
do recall,   Martin Luther King Jr. stood up to oppression PEACEFULLY. If
things are ever to become accepting among people of different cultures,
people first have to learn to teach people to realize the evil of prejudice
thru enlightenment, no harsh comments that will only put someone on the
defensive.

Someone once asked me why people in general are so mean and so angry... My
response was that people hate the feeling of fear. People fear what they do
not understand... People fear change. And when people feel fear, it makes
them get defensive... It makes them angry. Let's all choose not to be one of
those people... For the sake of mankind... Anger NEVER solves anything....
Ever.

Keep the peace...

During the next flame war could we hear from those that are on other 
lists. This thought oringinated after Foolish Fish related the last big 
Flame War to an alignment of planets. it would be interesting if we are 
connected by more than telephone lines.

by just being the nurturing and open family that we have the potential to
be.  by fostering tolerance and compassion and allowing it to brim over
into every facet of our lives.  by looking beyond the traps of color,
gender, religion, sexual orientation and anything else which stands to
divide us....

as a child, i used to really like m&ms.  i liked to dump them all out of
the bag and look at all of the different pretty colors.  i would often sit
down at the kitchen table and begin dividing my ration of m&ms up by color,
each different color in a separate pile.  after a while, i grew quite tired
of this method and was very uninspired to even eat the sick things.  but
then one day, i dumped out the bag and saw a different way that i could
split them up: instead of each pile consisting of the same color, i put one
m of each color in each pile. it sure looked pretty.  i was amazed by how
nicely all of the different hues complimented one another.  try it some
time and you'll see what i mean :>

extrapolate whatever meaning you like from this little anecdote.

thanks as always for your captivation....

love,
lola

Hi all!  

This is just to reiterate what Leslie said.  Please think about what you
say and write!  Remember that these words are representing YOU to
hundreds of people.  Words are a funny thing; they can mean many, many
things depending on each individual's background and beliefs.

Language is a wonderful tool of communication.  It is also,
unfortunately, the basis for much misunderstanding.  But the beauty of
it, I think, lies in the possibilities...

"Every English sentence is a lesson in logic."    (Mark Twain?)
(and probably other langages, too, but i didn't coin the phrase...)

So, it follows that every post should be a lesson in logic as well. 
Think before you speak.

Peace, 
Heather  :o) -- a student of English, soon to be a teacher of the same

I always had a thing for skittles or starbursts myself, I used to
seperate them by color too.  After I sorted 'em out I'd take one of each
color, and squish 'em together to make a milti-flavor super
skittle/starburst.  

But I WAS a weird little kid...

        well, last night my friends and I were thinking up wacky DJ
pseudonyms because we agreed to make them up when we could all beat-match
well enough to spin in front of people. I've already done these things a few
months back, but they were slower learners(hee hee)mainly because the tables
we learned on are in my room and not theirs(I could practice right when I
got up in the morning!) A few nights ago they threw a house party and we all
spun and it was really fun(this house party was in a large co-op which
houses 150.) So we then had this silly hash-influenced brainstorm and I
think we've come up with some. But I don't want to use it, because it's too
silly, even if it would help tell us apart. i'm the shy chris, remember...

Area 51 will *definitely* go off yeah! For me, it's a real bummer, because I'm torn between Reno and Area 51- Hell, maybe I'll actually be in same frequecy from the real Area 51 out in Nevada! :-)

I was over at Dutch's pad about four weeks ago picking up some flyers, and right b4 I left he played me this one track that I know he'll drop at on Saturday night... if ya hear it, you'll *definitely* know what I'm talking about! YOU GO DUTCH! Make the crowd go into a frenzy!!!!!

Great to see Strawberry Sundays in effect again as well.
Maybe I'll see some of you @ Sunset....

Anyways hope everyone has a great/safe weekend, and peace!

        I don't and never have liked milk in my cereal. When I was a kid and
I had Lucky Charms, I would pick through it in my bowl to eat all the
cereal, than at the end I could just eat all the marshmallows like it was a
mini desert or something. I could do this while watching cartoons and it was
great. Last semester I tried it again because we happened to get Lucky
Charms one day... ohhh it was nice...

Speaking of rythym ...we could make a sfraves CD ...sample some of the
flame
wars...mix in a little jungle....maybe call it Jungle flames? ,=)

><{{{"> <"}}}><

ps...does anyone know where to get a test dummy?
It would be nice to get one and cover it in glitter,stickers,
glow sticks and blow pops and take it to the area 51 party.

Maybe after the party we could attach a few model rockets to it
and launch it...see how many ufo reports make the front page of
the sunday chronicle.....

At phunckateck this evening, an Irish girl called Sage, and a dude drom
Indianapolis were really on hit, tearing me up, just gorgeous detonation
style.

Do any of you teevee landers know if either of these young stars has a
tape running about?

I would appreciate any help, cheers.

putting them on tape, and trading em around like baseball cards

I've been away from the list about a week.  On catching up, I'm
more than disappointed by what's been going on here, I'm appalled.
We are experiencing a continual stream of newcomers on this list who
use racially insensitive language.  I don't think this is a
particularity of this list -- if anything, we've been shielded from
this somewhat due to the multi-whatever nature of the Bay Area.
But it's gotten more and more noticeable.  

My very capable, wise and eloquent African-American friends on this
list have been grouching to me about this -- for good reason -- for
over a year.  

Now comes the latest thrash -- as an offshoot of what I think is a
growing concern and disaffection for this scene based on the 
increasing amounts of sketchiness, shiftlessness and self-absorption
that characterize the current period, and show up as an increasing
tendency toward violence.  We are all aware of the increasing risk
of this, which is why I think everyone over-reacted so strongly to
the supposed news to begin with.

But one relatively offhand if unthinking comment nearly blew this
list off its hinges.  This is the worst I've seen it, and I must
say, asking for advance slack 'cause I'm gonna name a name or two
this time, that John Lee over-reacted and let himself succumb to
the feedback loops that always blow up when the race issue comes
around.  I don't think any of the Chris 3 were listening and posting
very carefully either.  There was a lot of heat, friends, and not
much light.  That is not historically the outcome we expect from
sfraves.  

Now let me tell you where I was this past weekend: Detroit.  A city
where race is on the front-and-center of everyone's mind ALL THE TIME.
A city divided, bitterly torn, and yet with a strong sense of itself
and a devotion to what they have been historically and will be in the
future.  A city that will find that future if and only if it finds a
way to stitch back together the different threads of that community.
And it's not just black and white, there's a huge Arab-American
community, many Filipinos, and so on.  

One of the reasons Detroit techno is what it is, is that it bridges
all those gaps.  I went to a club called the Shelter on Friday night,
saw a DJ named Paris mix up a nice offering of house, techno, and a 
bit of jungle, and then Mike Huckaby wind it up with a classic SF-style
house set, for a club full of people of every race, gender and more
than the usual young ages.  All the while we were watching an
immense thunderstorm outside with the lighting crackling across the
clouds above the Renaissance Center (the inert fortress monument to
the wrong way to rebuild a city).  

Music offers a common area to leave behind our prejudices -- we all
have them, the first thing to dealing with your own personal racism
is giving up the idea you don't have any -- and understand that we
are all part of one unified and yet fractious human race.  

The dream of techno goes beyond prejudice and even words and to the
inspiration of the human soul -- when it's at its best.  Nothing's
perfect, the techno music scene in Detroit is just as factionalized
and divided as anywhere else, but that seems to be left aside when
the music plays.  Just like in SF.  

Words are what we use to communicate when we can't use music, and
words are imperfect.  If you were to say "deepest darkest" anywhere
in Metroplex Detroit, you can be damn well sure nobody misunderstands
that as the color of the Detroit River.  Words that inadvertently or
not bring our societal tensions over race to the surface -- especially
phrases like "deepest darkest" that are coded as separating "us" and
"them" -- are the ones most likely to raise a reaction from people
like John.  I hope you will *listen* to what John is really saying,
because it represents a reality for people who must confront this
society's fucked up racial attitudes every single waking moment,
unlike many of us who happen to be in the lighter-skin category.
Admittedly, John's tendency toward rhetorical dramatics might divert
attention from his message -- but the message is always there.  That's

why I find Black Adder's dismissive handwave so distasteful.  When
we stop listening, we stop learning.  That doesn't look good on any
of us -- and I've generally found Black Adder's views well constructed
and explained, and he's not afraid to state it even when it's not
popular.  

I'm NOT for an avoidance of conflict.  This isn't any goody two shoes
sitcom superficial view of life where we all agree we are Good People
and go to scenes from next week's episode.  This is a part of real life
where we make mistakes and misunderstand context and jump to conclusions
and blow up at each other . . . and generally, if we're smart, start
realizing it looks a little foolish to have your fingers typing ahead
of your brain after all.

We are in a cynical down-cycle of the music scene in my opinion.
I don't think succumbing to cynicism or avoiding the issue in a cotton
candy cloud of PLURity is the way to go.  My view of it is -- if you
got far enough to get to sfraves, you're doing good so far, now learn
from that and teach it well by how you think and act.

I'm climbing down from the soapbox once more.  Hope y'all don't mind
my bit of reality, I'm still learning this stuff too.

peace out 
phred

I don't know what happened to my original apology post but I did do one.
Let me reitereate for those who may not have gotten it.

I was out of line with all the f-you's, and a-holes, and other vitriol.  I
should not have lost my temper in such an immature fashion.  I am sorry for
the disruption my words may have caused since it has had a negative effect
on the list.  For those people who I offended I offer my sincere apologies,
there was no need for you to get caught up in my madness.

Next time I see something devicive on the list I will be a bit more
careful.  Since that time I have made apologies to both Chris in the hopes
that we might reach and understanding and I think we all, in some way have.
We are taking steps toward greater understanding and appreciation, in both
directions.

So I wanted to put this out to you all in the hopes of increasing the peace.

With that said I also want to make one thing very clear.  This apology in
no way deflects from the fact that there was a poor choice of words and
insensitivtiy in the original post.  I am not apologizing for what I said,
just how I said it, it could have been done in a far more elegant fashion
w/o the cursing, name calling, baiting, etc.

I would hope that we, as a group, will stop and think about our audience.
Just as I can see how people could be offended by my words, people should
also see how thier words hurt others as well.  My understanding of this is
very clear, I can only hope that yours becomes as clear.  If we stop
considering each other then we will fight, rest assured.  And as we
approach the millenium do we really wanna go out like this, or like humans
w/ a sense of understanding about one another?  The choice will always be
ours.

Have a good one & peace,
John

P.S.  To the others who piped up against me that is your choice.  Hopefully
I am in your killfile as you are most certainly in mine.  Another chance at
understanding lost, but you can't win 'em all, and now we will both miss
out.  The strangest thing about the vitriolic responses was not that they
came, but who they came from.  As I expected the most vile came from the
people who use an acronym but when it came to brass tacks it was an ideal
they could not uphold.  Then there were the others who probalby live the
ideal, from them I heard nary a word.  It proved to me that yes there is
certainly hope for us all, but there will always be hypocrisy as we try to
strive for that ideal.

Now if you would kindly do so, spare the list from any more personal
flames.  I could care less with all the personal jsl this and that, I find
it rather  amusing (Megan and I got a few good laughs - although she was
going to fire something off that was not going to be nice so...).  Funny my
calling someone a-hole, and f-u was far worse than somone perception of
petential racism.  It speaks volumes about what people see as important and
why.  It is also a testament as to how far we really have to go before we
can all get along. There is no progress w/o struggle.

Only two more posts today...these had better be good. ;)

Over & out...ohh I forgot.  Thank you to all of those who understood where
I was coming from and why.  Much love to you all, you know who you are.
True warriors  all, and very real indeed.  I do promise to make an effort,
seriously, to meet with the lot of you, maybe at one of, er "your" events (
;) ), maybe over beers on a friday or saturday afternoon.  I have a car and
will travel.  It has been too long and it's time to hook up.  JC @ Sun;
you're the bomb and Florida is definitely in the house!  Much love to all
you crackerjacks!  Now please, do me a favor and dance.  I gotta find a
party or something this weekend so I'ze can listen to some good old
fashioned house music...better yet I'll make a tape and spare myslef
potential record touching DJ's ;).  Pax!

I go through periods where i listen to a single CD over and over again.
But it has to be a really good cd for me to do this. I think it kind of
reflects your mood and outlook on life at a particular point in time.
Right now I can't get enough for LTJ BUKEM's MixMag CD. It's so beautiful.

Anyone into Happy Hardcore? My roommate whose from Wisconsin has got me
all hyped to go to an event. He showed me this magazine and it looks like
so much fun. There is no real drop transitions.... I can't imagine how
that would feel amongst 5k+ people..... man. If anyone has been to such an
event I would love to hear about it. 

Peace, Love, Unity, Respect and Music....,

Gee I guess that makes trance kind of stale huh =) Actually the first, half
of the harmony set was jsut hard minimal techno with a bit of acid, while
the second half was morningish trance. At Bastet (the drag fest ;) I just
played straight techno, fairly dark.

Hiya All!

I've got an idea that I would like to implement on my spare time.
I am an owner of a digital communications company (sorry, sales &
marketing rhetoric - we make CD-ROMs, web sites, quicktime video stuff)
and am thinking of setting up a RealAudio archive of the best of
Techno/House/Rave for all of us to use when we want to revisit the
classics or research a track.
I stopped being a public DJ several years ago and have been buying
tracks on CD now instead of Vinyl (my 1200's were stolen  accelerating
my retirement). I have many classic house tracks that would be cool to
put online for people to listen to.
We have servers and all that cool stuff here and a little creative side
time would be great.
The problem is this:
There are many DJs that are on this list who probably don't have a whole
lot of spare time, but I am hoping there are those out there who have
some sort of way to capture audio to their computer (by way of a .wav or
.aiff file) and encode the audio to realAudio (via the free downloadable
RealAudio Encoder 3.0 or 4.0) and send it off to me.
I'll put online my stuff as well as whoever sends me what they think is
classic.
I'd like to include artist, personal notes from the submitter (why they
think it is classic), label, date created or something.
We could collect memories from people the first time they heard the
track.
(like the first time I heard bombscare - 2badmice - that is a story). To
have a place that gives context to our experiences would be awesome.

Anyway, I'd like some feedback on this one.

I think it would rock.

rob.

I hope you'll forgive me for pointing out what a brilliant and sensitive
post this is... 

I guess you'll be following this with one of those, "I meant this to be a
private mail" apologies, where you never get around to addressing the real
issue.

Well, for everyone to see, this is what everybody was getting inflamed
about.  Whereas Chris had potentially made a mistake in his use of
verbiage, we've already covered this ground and we move on to downright
malice of intent and open dialogue that has already been noted as
offensive by some members of the list.

Thank you for raising the bar.
AndyW

p.s.	Gee, I might not have noticed if you didn't PUT IT IN ALL CAPS.

> Just curious, how much did those bad girls cost?

J&R Music World (look up # in http://garbanzo.ssesco.com/nau/mailorder.htm)
sells the CDJ-500mkII's for $599 ea, and the M-500 (mixer, you can use any
old mixer however, but this one is real nice) for $799. There's a complete
package they sell for $2300 which includes a custom Anvil case that fits
both CD players and the mixer (which is smaller than 19" rackmount standard
sized mixers)...

>Yea, I want to know too. And also, do they have digital outputs (S/PDIF). 

Unfortunately, not.

The reason for this, IMHO, is that you'd have to get into some relatively
expensive rate-resampling hardware in order to keep the SPDIF standard
44.1Khz sample rate on the output while the "input" sample rate changed
with the pitch slider (since that changes the bit-rate coming off the CD).
I don't have the schematic, but that's my OPINION based on my knowledge of
digital audio (go ahead and flame me, cathode and nodeOne, ya wankers).

Actually you said nothing offensive for the first time in recent history (
other than your overuse of the term wanker )... the cdj-500-g does have a
digital out though... your guess is as good as mine as to why they didn't
put it on the cdj-500-II... If you just stick to the facts and spare us the
subjectivity ( i.e. Analog sucks because I say so ) there should be no need
for furthur arguing... It is pointless for us to argue on these issues
because neither of us is going to change viewpoints. You have some
preconceived notion of me as some useless drugged out lolly pop sucking
trendoid raver who doesn't know his ass from a hole in the ground... I
could turn blue in the face trying to convince you that this is not the
case but what would be the point??? Where would it get me??? What would it
teach you??? Nowhere and nothing.... I have seen your credentials, I know
what you do... I know that others may be impressed but alas I am not... I
believe that you know what you are talking about most of the time but I
also believe that you have neglected to educate yourself on many facets of
electronic music production and presentation ( i.e Instruments and records
).... You automatically discount all that Josh ( Nodeone ) and I ( my name
is Owen ) say on the basis that we could not possibly know as much about it
as you do but in reality you have no clue as to the depth or breadth of our
combined knowledge... You take to insulting us as people for no reason
other than your obvious inability to carry on a didactic conversation...You
have insulted Josh about his profession and I'm sure you would insult me

Andy - it wasn't meant for private email.  I do know chrisP personally
and my use of all caps was to emphasize how ridiculous John's original
reaction was and his subsequent use of the dictionary to point out the
implications of the English word "black" - I mean, c'mon, ever look up
the word Mongolism in the dictionary?  

Mongolia and Mongolians are the romanized counterparts of what their
Chinese pronounciations sound like.  Europeans saw some down syndromed
people and coined the disability Mongolism.

Anyway, i'm getting off this sinking thread.

sfraves -

I'm in the market to purchase two turn tables and a mixer.

Since I'm no A/V junkie, my knowledge of what's out there is pretty
scant... any advice will be gratefully assimilated. :)  I'm not really
a DJ, but would like to maybe mix some tapes.

danke

and if someone wants to sell me a coffin setup, well that just might
be even better. :)

Ethan spun a great set at space odyssey last night.  Dancefloor was pretty
sparse, but that had little to do with the tunes, and ethan's spinnin' had
me, for one, caring little about other's dancing.  

I Had a blast.

The ones I have don't have that on it. Yours are new... That's cool. Hope

of being a liar... Enough said - its dead.

Ethan sez:
>Just curious, how much did those bad girls cost?

When I bought my 500II, it cost about $740, somewhere right around there. I
just saw the current ones yesterday at Leo's SF for $1000...



Darrell Sez:
>Yea, I want to know too. And also, do they have digital outputs (S/PDIF).

The 500-G has an VHF adaptor section, which has a/v out and dc jack. The
II's don't have anything besides the RCA's and the "control out" (for their
mixer and whatever else pioneer invents)...

I think that's what it might stand for... I think it'll play little vid
discs, although I've never tried it.   I use the "g" as one half of my
mixing rig - it works great except for the wear and tear... great for
home/studio dj use.

You can set the 1 count wherever you like:

Make sure you are on AUTO CUE mode by holding that little Auto Cue button
down until its on. Then hit pause, and adjust the pitchwheel to where you
want "beat 1". (I do it to exactly one frame before the kick or whatever
beat 1 is hits) Then hit cue, and it'll remember that as the "punch in"
point... Hit play or mess with the cue button like a sampler... its really
short though. (on the II's or mkII's you can hold cue indefinitely)


>I have a lame dual cd player because the pitch change is'nt constant or
>linear.
>But...is most of the problem with me because I havent done this for long?
>Can I learn on a cheap box?

I guess it depends on your abilities? I dunno. I can only really tell you
my experience, I've tried the rack mount denon's once, and I was able to
sorta do it on the first try, but I had been mixing for awhile already...
The cdj's seem far easier to make mental sense with...

Hope that helps!

These prices are killer... Definitely a good recommendation. See my
previous message for local rip-off prices.

A resonable assesment. Sounds quite plausible.
Just *can't* drop the attitude. Bummer. =[

Just something to consider....Its not the actual article just a 
synopsis from http://sciencenow.sciencemag.org/html/970626a.htm


Don't Put That in Your Pipe and Smoke It!

Compared to heroin and cocaine, many people--scientists and teenagers 
alike--consider marijuana a relatively benign substance. Two new 
studies in tomorrow's Science demonstrate, however,that marijuana's 
effects on the brain are disturbingly similar to those produced by 
highly addictive drugs. The findings may help scientists devise better 
strategies for treating marijuana dependence, for which some 100,000 
people in the United States alone seek therapy each year.

After previously linking a brain peptide called corticotropin 
releasing factor (CRF) to anxiety and stress in people withdrawing 
from alcohol, cocaine, and opiates, a team of researchers from The 
Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, California, along with two 
visiting scientists from Complutense University of Madrid in Spain, 
set out to investigate whether CRF might mediate the stressful malaise 
that some long-term marijuana users experience after quitting.

The active ingredient in marijuana is a cannabinoid known as THC. The 
researchers injected a synthetic version of the compound into more 
than 50 rats once a day for 2 weeks to mimic the effects of heavy, 
long-term marijuana use in people. The researchers produced a dramatic 
withdrawal syndrome by injecting the rats with a newly developed drug 
that counteracts THC. The group found the rats' anxiety levels, as 
measured in a standard behavioral test, shot up, and they displayed 
exaggerated signs of stress such as compulsive grooming and teeth 
chattering during withdrawal. What's more, when the scientists 
measured CRF levels in the rats' brains, they found that rats in 
withdrawal had two to three times more CRF than controls not given the 
antagonist.

The results, experts say, provide the first neurochemical basis for a 
marijuana withdrawal syndrome, and one with a strong emotional 
component that is shared by other abused drugs. ``The work suggests 
that the CRF system may be a part of a common experience in 
withdrawal--that is, anxiety,'' says Alan Leshner, Director of the 
National Institute on Drug Abuse.

But withdrawal is just one component of addiction. Addictive drugs 
also have immediate rewarding, or reinforcing, effects that keep 
people and animals coming back for more. The drugs produce these 
effects, scientists believe, by stimulating the brain's so-called 
reward system. A key event in the reward pathway is the release of 
dopamine by a small cluster of neurons in a brain region called the 
nucleus accumbens. When Gaetano Di Chiara and colleagues at the 
University of Cagliari in Italy infused THC into a small group of 
rats, they found that dopamine levels in the nucleus accumbens jumped 
to double those in control rats infused with an inactive 
cannabinoid--a surge similar to that seen with heroin.

The studies ``send a powerful message that should raise everyone's 
awareness about the dangers of marijuana use,'' says David Friedman, a 
neurobiologist at Bowman Gray School of Medicine in Winston-Salem, 
North Carolina. But they also suggest avenues for treating marijuana 
dependence: For instance, chemicals that block the effects of CRF or 
even relaxation exercises might soothe the miserable moods experienced 
by people in THC withdrawal.

	Um, first of all I am more than old enough to remember them,
and had all their first-ed LP's. Second, Devo was not refering to
people of asian descent, and the lyrics of the song were pretty clear
on that. They were referring to someone with Down's Syndrome, which
used to be called mongolism (perhaps because of the epicanthic folds
around the eyes). Especially true in the verse right after the one you
quoted "...one chromosome too many..."

	What I have been trying and trying to find are copies of Gary
Numan's albums (or CDs, if they were ever rereleased). I had all of
those as well and I would _kill_ to find a copy of "Are friends
electric" or "Telekon" again. Why is it that a bands/signers most
successful public album is usually the one that is LEAST their style?
(In G. Newman's case, "The Pleasure Principle"...)

	If you were just being sarcastic, then apologies. ;-)

now *this* is a much more interesting thread....please explain the parallel

and please, make it informative, for i have blown one post out of three on
absorbing yet still more cheesey 80's knowledge.

in the immortal words of pat benetar, fellow sawsister, "before i put
another notch in my lipstick case, you better stand back and put me in my

i am embarrassed.  back in the one hit wonder closet i go....or all we 80's

aha, first he calls it video game music (i still don't know how you
meant that) and then he goes all drooly about it  :)
too bad i've given all my favorite happy hardcore tapes away already.
what's 'drop transitions'?
actually, i'm still not quite sure whether we mean the same thing when
we're talking about happy hardcore.
take me w/ you, man, i'd even come to wisconsin w/ you as long as it's

Well, what to say that hasnt been said.  

It was bomb, a much love crowd.  police came too early, but not early 
enuf to crush the vibe.  

I got to spin.... happy happy joy joy.  (64k ifs ya did not know)
what little I got to hear of Vlad and Andy W kicked my ass, Indigo was 
rocking as always, Mark (jungle in the chill room as we started) put me 
in a happy place to start my set.  And of course I was wonderful...
Well, at least not bad.  
Got lost in the shuffle after the location move, but still had fun 
everywhere I ended up (matt's party, 3com freezer, Summit rock...).

I hope there's a makeup, (hope I can spin at it...)

Andy P, back where you belong ace, South Bay!

64k.

Well, I'm off to England for a month of relaxation.  Any good 
recomendations as to record store, clubs, how to find a rave (if there 
are any left after all the crazed regulation passed)?

PS, if you want a goodie from england, drop me a line, and if I see it, 
and it's not outrageous(ly priced), I'll bring it back for you.

Ventr4th@aol.com would be interested in participating in an East Bay get
together. By the way...the Blue Tatoo is opening in the next week or two in
San Ramon. By no means a Release or DNA it would seem to be the only place in
the 680 corridor that will have DJ's, lights, bubbles and girls in cages (OK
so it's not bondage-a-go-go at the Troc).

	You're not being dense, it's kind of obscure, but the relationship
between wanking & the song "Turning Japanese" has to do with a one-eyed
trouser snake turning japanese. At least this is what I was told.

Drop transitions?  S'plain to me what you mean by that.  Anyway, I havent
been to an *all* happy hardcore party, but I heard my friend Noah spin it
New Year's Eve in Dallas right at Midnight and it was Great!!!  Happy
Hardcore may be the cheesiest piano breakdown, diva singing music.. but I
love it.  It's hella fun to dance to cuz it's so cheesy.. =) heh.  I
definitely like the breakbeaty stuff compared to the 4 beat, since I love
jungle so much.  I think an all happy hardcore party would be dope.. along
with an old school breakbeat night.  It all goes hand in hand in my
opinion.  Very vibey stuff.. Check it out!
        Anyone need a HH DJ for their next party?  Look up
Noahphex/Muppetfucker on the webpage below in my sig file.  ;)    Love Toy
=)

Lemme get this straight: It took over 50 rats, a team of researchers,
and two scientists from Spain to find out that it feels good to smoke
weed and that it makes you want to smoke it again?? Shit man, I could of
told you that!

I checked out those other two articles. The title of one was:

"Activation of Corticotropin-Releasing Factor in the Limbic System
During Cannabinoid Withdrawal"

I call it "Fiending"

I hope my tax dollars didn't pay for this...

This will be my last post on this particular thread. I'm absolutely positive
that it will arise again in the future though.... 

How do you all think that the following people would react to the now
infamous "deepest darkest part of Oakland" thread:

Frankie Knuckles, Donald Glaude, Geoff White, Kevon of FTT, Jamie Principal,
Marques Wyatt, Raymond Roker, Todd Terry, Carl Craig, Adeva, Thelma Houston,
Mad Mike, Terence Toy, Roy Davis Jr., DJ Pierre, Juan Atkins, Goldie, Ashley
Beedle, Kevin Saunderson, Adonis, Cajmere, Derrick Carter, Re Ach, Glenn
Underground, Derrick May, Colin Mc Bean, DJ Spooky, Colin Dale, Jeff Mills,
Boo Williams, Larry Heard, Kenny Larkin, Gusto, DJ Disciple, Loleatta
Holloway, Paul Johnson, DJ Rush, LTJ Bukem, Carl Cox, Kemistry, Claude Young,
Norman Cook, Alan Oldham, The Electrifyin' Mojo, Romanthony, Abacus, Fabio,
Roni Size, Stacey Pullen, Barry Adamson, among others....

Part of my point is that I truly believe that this stuff IS rave related and
is as important as anything else is in the scene(it at least SHOULD be if
not).

Actually I'm thinking along the lines of the "fair usage laws" that
exist around copyright for this idea.
There is fair usage for any media that is used for editorial purposes
(we deal with this all the time w/ Citi:Zen Magazine -
http://www.citizenmag.com) and that is what I am advocating for this
"spare-time" project.
We deal with licensing issues all the time and I am extremely sensitive
to artists need for payment and recognition for useage, so I would not
violate the law in any way.
What would be great tho, is mucho commentary on people's experience w/
certain tracks, why it should be considered a classic track or not, and
then an example of what it souds like (30 sec. - 1 minute w/o clearance,
or the whole song if I can get clearance from the label, artist, or
holding company). The problem I'm trying to solve is this:

Your at a party and you get into this situation, "Man, remeber that
track that goes....wonk, wonk, wonk, and then blam, this huge break
kicks in" or something, and the person is like, "uh, yeah, I think
so...".

It would be great to have a site that was geared towards a living
history of the music. It would give it some context in a static way and
a place for people who love the music and wish to comment on it could.

Anyway, I see this as an audio yearbook or family album (hmmmmm, that
might make a good name....) or something similar.

Also:

Chemical Bros. - 17th Century Sky
Moby - Go

Classics. Should be noted somewhere dontcha think?

Hi. My name is Monty and when I'm not pissing people off or explaining the
vicissitudes of racial politcs on this list, I play records that often times
do the same thing, whilst forcing you to shake that ass.

Case in point: Saturday night @ VSF! The VSF-SFR Lounge will be back in full
effect babay! VSF is located at 11th & Folsom in SF, and If you get there
before 11pm and say "SF Raves" at the door, not only will you be allowed in
for free, but you'll get a chance to boogie to some jazzy, groovy and
downright PLUR-a-listic House music!

So bring your glitter and your barf-bags and leave the flamethrowers at home,
people and remember: 

NO PARKING ON THE DANCEFLOOR!

Respect!

I've heard that cleaning records with rubbing alcohol works like a charm.

    o   Any truth to this?
    o   Any post or pre treatment, if I do use alcohol?
    o  Any risk of damaging the grooves?

Also, against my better judgement,  my bandmates have conned me into
bringing my TT's to the desert for burning man.  besides  keeping records
out of direct sunlight, can anyone offer any advice that will prevent my
wax from dripping?   Also, I'm really scared about dust & sand in the
turntables & mixer.

Any advice or  warnings?


thank you kindly,

b))merang

Or, maybe it is a reference to eyes closing (or squinting) at the moment
of climax....

No fun, no sin, no you,

This would seen to support the theory.

Alright smarty-pants people.  Answer me this : can I, a lazy, no-good
procrastinator, still get tickets for Happy Kids?  Are they on pre-sale
or will there be some at the door?  Do we know what part of the bay area
will be home to said event?  Cause, and I mean this baby, just a little
Love is all I Need.

> I've heard that cleaning records with rubbing alcohol works like a charm.

Very bad idea...

>     o   Any truth to this?

Yes, alchohol is a very good solvent. 

>     o   Any post or pre treatment, if I do use alcohol?

A good post-treatment might be financial preparation to eventually buy
a new record.

>     o  Any risk of damaging the grooves?

Excellent risk.. Alchohol removes the binders and stabilizers from the
vinyl and leads to increased wear, increased oxidation from exposure to
light/air, and eventual breakdown, esp. with the needle tracking
through the damaged vinyl.

Go to an audiophile store (aka, not the good guys) and ask them if they
carry wet record vacuums. Perhaps check the rec.audio.* newsgroups and
FAQs Altermately, find a shop that'll clean your records for you. I
don't know if places still do this, but I know such service was
available back in the days when "turntable" didn't connote an
overpriced boat anchor with a lousy tonearm and non-phase-locked pitch
control. :-)

HOooooooooooooooooly shit.

if i'd have missed this i would have damned myself for the rest of my 
living days.  Not just because of hardfloor - who KICK HUGE ASS!!! - but 
also for all the hilarity surrounding the event for me, as the last time 
i was in that nightclub was when i was a fledgeling raver in 1992 at THE 
RAVE FROM THE GRAVE. featuring David Hawkes. (I can feel some of you 
cringing!)

it was bone-meltingly loud.  the laser ceiling was gorgeous.  and our 
friend Joanna gets props for owning a record that even Hardfloor doesn't 
have a copy of :) a yellow vinyl tb resucitation (sp?)

it was more than worth my $26.  Definitely more than worth it :)

The first study is BS, marijuana withdrawal is caused by the antagonist
drug. The thing about weed is that it is metabolized slowly, staying in
your system for up to thirty days,. when the antagonist is used to suddenly
remove the THC from the bloodstream withdrawal effects were produced, this
is not, IMHO, good science.

Hello all!

Just decided to send off some early am comments re: the happy kiddos
last night....

Is it just me or was the voicemail updated really late?

Overall it was pretty nice.  But as usual, HOT HOT HOT.  Main room
between 12-2:00 seemed to have a wierd energy.  once the vibe picked up
and everyone was jumpin' to the music, the pace would s l o w then pick
up and then slow and over and over...remember, maybe it was just me.

relatively roomy and spacious...seemed to be plenty of room to shake
your stuff, especially downstairs where some serious sounds were
happening!

nice glowey things everywhere and big hugs to the girl walking around
with the water bottle spraying all of the hot dancers!  

I do have a comment that i hope i'll get some feedback on....i went
alone hoping to meet up with some of you.  my computer crashed while
everyone was sharing meeting spots, pre-parties, who's going, when
etc....so i missed all that.  i only knew names but figured i'd run into
one of you!  no luck at all and i was totally bummed about it.  i
remember a message that someone posted about walking into a party alone
and the feeling you get.  no one talks to you, or makes you really feel
welcome.  i told him it was up to him to walk up to people and make an
effort cause no one in this crowd would turn you down! well i was
wrong.  i tried to talk to several people and ask if they knew any of
you, but people were generally just *blaugh* to me!  why?  i was
obviously alone.  one person was nice enough to introduce himself when i
walked in, but that was really it.  i didn't get smiles from many
people, not even a hi how are you doing!  i generally go out with a lot
of europeans to parties and events and i definitely feel a different
thing goin on.  at least people say hi to you.  :-( boy i sound like a
pathetic person right now don't i?? boo hoo I'm not terrible looking,
(medium length dark brown hair, blond streaks on either side, about
5'6", japanese, german, swiss, dutch and irish blood going on) maybe
it's because i'm 28 and i exude that "old" vibe. :-(

well, enough feeling sorry for myself i still had a great time dancing
on my own and checking out the scene!  if anyone is going to grumpy kids
tonight PLEASE fill me in on how i can spot some of you!  i was so upset
that i didn't meet any of you last night. :-(  i'll definitely be at the
brannan location on sunday eve after the parade and i'm going to
spundae's various embarcadero/broadway parties and will be there shakin
my groove thing sun night to see a fav dj.

looking forward to hearing more from you!

:-) melissa

I'm leaving for awhile. To the great pleasure of some, and maybe to the
dismay of a small few, I need a break from the volume. Lots of noise is
making me dizzy. Gotta breathe and keep creativity flowing. I'll be back
sometime in the future.

Hello All!!!
I'm sorry I can't come down for Area 51 this weekend.  I was wondering if
you guys could do me a favor.  Anyone going to Area 51, I would love it if
you could hook up with some friends of mine from overseas.  There's a guy
from Germany named Oli and his guy and girl friend from France.  They
really want to meet up with some of you at Area 51 tonight.. and they're
not on the list.  Can anyone show them around or meet up with them?  They
said they had fun at Nikita last night and are really lookin forward to
tonight's festivities@!!!
        Give them a call at (415) 921-4566, ask for Oli.  He's the one with
the German accent!
Take care all and thanks in advance!!!!! Show them some San Francisco lovin!!
Love Toy =)

I just gotta start out by saying this: happy kids crew, GREAT JOB!!! :)

The party was awesome. I was a little worried when the VM wasnt updated by 10:00 (when the party started). So, my two totally-new-to-raving friends and I went up to 
F8 to see what was going on.  Lo and behold, we get tickets, and head on down to the familiar rave spot. When we first got there, I ran into some people I knew and we 
started dancing. This was the first party I went to with a laminate, and I was sooo happy to meet all you fellow SFRavers. Great decorations and the music was incredible. 
The wall of speakers in the main room was fun :) Unfortunately, my driver had to leave at 2:30 so we didnt get to stay that long, but it was still a great party with a great vibe.

Gotta say hi to Jil, Earthlen, Mercutio, Leslie, Rubilicious, Adam, and all the other SFRavers I met (sorry if I left anyone out :P~)
Also hiya to julie, jon cooper, and eric who i didnt see (where were you guys? :) )

I hope everyone had enough fun as I did :)

Hugs and Love, Diego.

OK.  I am looking forward to Supergrumpo.  I called the info number, got
the superlocation, and while it's real extra close to public
transportation I could take, said public transportation will not take me
home at 4 in the morning, so..........

If me friends and I drive, does anyone who knows this location at all have
a suggestion for a good parking lot/place in the area?

The recording says, of course, that we shouldn't park obviously right out
in front of the spot, but since I don't know this particular sector very
well, I'm looking for advice.

Cheers, hope to see you there, chances are I'll be wearing an old-school
plastic baseball hardhat, probably the Orioles.

Pax,
MAX

Oh no, melissa! Sorry to hear that happened - 'cause it's almost like we
were at different parties... I was there too, alone, and got *lots* of
smiles and eye-catchings, and someone even gave me a glitter bracelet. Big
glow mmm nice...

Wonder if I bumped into any SFRavers w/out knowing it?
(Me: giving out candy & occasional flowers, wearing orange&purple striped
ski hat & yellow backpack... You: Smiling or exhausted happi freak...)

Sidebar:

just moved out here from new mexico, Happy Kids was my first party here,
generally great time, nice vibe, though seemed socially fragmented (not
much interaction between everyone -- felt like rooms full of individuals
instead of one big multi-faceted dance organism.) Hoping to attend more
smallish parties - afraid the area 51 megaparty concept doesn't attract me
too much...

Thump thump thump thump...

What the hell?  Is the party still going on?

Direction info was supposed to be posted at 9:30 p.m.  That was over an hour 
ago.  How come the voice mail hasn't been updated?

Now I'm not planning on leaving till after 11:30 p.m. anyway, but I'd like to 
make other plans if the party's canceled or busted.

Errr . . . deja vu.  This is Wonderland all over again!  If stuff goes awry 
again, I just hope I have a good sense of humor and a lot of fun like I did 
that night.  But boy, this gets kind of tiring after awhile.

If someone can give me some info, that'd be great.

Gawd, I love all caps,

Anyway I finally got to see what people were talking about in their
differentiation of "scene vs clubber" (jsl interpretation).

All I can say is that is warranted, however it is due to the TOTAL lack of
attendance by pople in the so-called "know" (i.e. ravers).  What I meant by
that is that clubbers were always an element of the scene, however they
were often numerically offest by the number of ravers in attendance (from
my recollection of rave history).  With this in mind  I certianly
undetrstand how some ravers feel being the only people who "get it".  There
is little doubt that the vibe is there, the real reason is numbers (i.e.
the number of ravers to crawlers read: clubbers).  If you are not going to
go out because of clubbers then you automatically succumb the the tide of
clubbers which , btw will always be there in one form or another.

Be sure to support the Dj's in your scene at all times.  It's one of the
reasons many still play at primarily underground events and not KMEL
events.  Your suppport, timed acurately, can make all the difference (the
day I hear Jeno on KMEL is the day I stop buying dance music altogether).

Props to Dj Monty & Dj JJ of Sugar Shack to lay down deep house in a
learning fashion ( in other words, people were schooled).  Much props to
Monty & JJ, great work.

I also met the famous (or infamous in the techno scene) Joe Rice, A big
lumbering DJ of a guy who has much respect from both old & new school.  It
was GREAT meeting the man behind the words.  I will make MAD (per Monty's
suggestion) to get more schooling!

If you acquiesce this scene to those who could care less about the music
and are about requests, versus those who are in it to dance, then we are
surely doomed.

As schooled this evening by one DJ Loren -  "The real difference between us
and clubbers is, we don't need a reason to dance."

Nuff said, this is true science,
John S. Lee

P.S.  I consider myself schooled!

Have a good weekend, off to ther parties.

P.S.  Props to Chris Lum for the traks he's just created, and his
incredible set  at the Zebra party.  Yes, it;;s time for jsl to start
making the rounds and getting schooled in the current state of house music.
Also I spent a considerable amount ($$$) this weekend on jungle a very deep
moody house! Wanna play? ;)

Peace and have fun this weekend!,
John

P.S.  I love gay pride week.month, it's all about Sf and the positive stuff
that make us, US.

Pax.

Subject: Area 51 review
Sender: sfraves-owner@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

        Due to a drastic last minute change of plans involving me and a
guest list, I decided to go to Area 51 instead of Grumpy Kids. It was an odd
decision. But I had lots of fun at the Area 51 party. The problems were the
sound quality in the 'star' room(which kicked ass as far as visuals!), the
messed up bass of the chill room, and the over scene in the 'reactor' room(I
hate circles of watchers, and seeing tons of guys freaking girls.) But lemme
tell you, did I have a little help from my buddy the 5th letter of the
alphabet. So I had a great time dancing to the sort of distorted music, and
meeting lots of new people. I didn't actually meet a single SFraver there,
but I met some guys I knew back in high school which was very odd. I then
got a hold of some glow sticks and a lot of pot, so we went through that I
danced during the two ambient sets in the chill room for quite long.(I was
the tall, brown-haired guy with the two glowsticks dancing in front,
sometimes I was the only one dancing). But it was quite exciting for me. I
guess if you didn't share my experience, it's quite concieveable. The vibe
wasn't great, but at times you'd meet people who'd put a smile on your
face(hugs to Erin and Denise)... so what can I say? maybe others liked it
too. I noticed another problem was somewhat shabby mixing at times. I
couldn't quite believe the amount of trainwrecks, and the number of time the
music stopped in the 'star' room, and the DJ's in the chill room who would
just let a record finish than put another one on. But oh well...

   I think the difference is the vibe due to WHY each individual is present.
I have been to VSF twice lately on sat.'s and there were different vibes each
time. It seems as if the sugar shack is pushing to move in people from this
list maybe to bring "our" vibe in, but I don't know where that's heading.....
you can't sell it, you can't sell friendship.
     I like the sugar shack...I live in san jose there was NO decent music on
fri/sat night. The hi-fi lounge is gone, clubbers are everywhere, I didn't
want to drive, everyone was already gone...  we need more weeklies down here!

Hey everyone,
 
        Hm.. let me think.  Pretty small for a massive.  But a massive none
the less.  They were having a tough time getting their acts together...and we
didn't get into the door until 11p.m., because they were still setting up.  I
enjoyed the humor of a security guard, who when asked by one of the many
gangsta looking people cruising 85th what was going on replied, "It's a big
orgy."  If that doesn't bring unwanted people into the scene, I don't know
what will.
       THe entrance tunnel was interesting, but all of the reflective
material was falling off.  It was smoky and dirty, but things like that never
really bother me.  I met more SFRAvers then I've ever seen in my life!! Even
before the 2a.m. meeting arrangement. 
       Hello to MY Tweaker Teresa, Matt, Paula, Victoria (<~~~ look, I got
your name right!) Other matt, Mark, Jive,Nick, Sky, Ari, GLitter Princess
(can't remember your real name, but the pants were so cool!) Beth, ANd all my
other SFRavers!
        Favorite things:
     Getting compliments on my fuzzy yellow shirt
      Getting lots of hugs from people for no reason
      Getting Free water (at a massive?!?!?!)
      Meeting everyone not on the list
       Meeting everyone on the list
       ThE BIG SFR HUG CiRCLE
      Getting taken care of when I once again, could not find my ride.
         It wasn't the best party in the world, but it felt that way last
night.  I know I, along with other people, got to make some newbies feel real
special.  DOesn't that just make you *SMILE*?  Well, I hope to meet more of
you, and this review is kind of strange seeing as how I'm still kind of
tired.  Too bad I had to leave early, but next time I will stay forever.  See
you all at Freedom?  Ok.. Going to work now.

After close to 2 years, we've decided to take a hiatus from throwing Mad to
relax a bit and focus on some other pursuits. (Did someone say Mad the
label?)

The final Mad will be July 14th.

When Mad started I don't think we had any idea of how lucky we'd be in
being able to present the music and the DJ's we've had, nor how supportive
and wonderful the clubgoers would be. It's been a good run, and thank you
to everyone who's come to Mad and in doing so, added to it. I've always
felt Mad and SFR had a close affinity and often is the Monday night when
you can meet many SFRavers in person. Thanks also to all of the DJ's who
have supported us and come down to play. And personally, I have to give the
utmost respect and props to Ethan, Alex, and Jon Santos who started the
whole thing and to Sho and Monty who kept things going and added new
vitality when Ethan and Jon had to take time to do other things.

xAnd yeah, I'm sad to see it go, but we'll be around....

Joe

One of San Francisco's strengths is it's diversity and variety, which is
also reflected in how and where people go to have fun. I ended up at a few
vastly different events last night, and they were all going off in their
own way - a quick rundown:

Started out at the Cloud Factory/Pro-Soy ambient dinner, which was an
excellent idea and I'm sorry I didn't get to stay longer. Basically there
was loads of excellent vegan food from Pro-Soy, and some ambient being
DJ'd, and an oppprtunity to spend some time with friends from the scene in
an environment where you can actually hear what they're saying and
everyone's in a normal frame of mind. This is the type of thing where ideas
and bonds are created.

Headed over to, dare I say it, a club - V/SF, or more correctly Pablo's
Suger Shack (Who's Pablo?), where Monty was playing as the SFR
representative. Due to recent talk on SFR I was more attentive than usual
to what was going down. People were having fun. That's what was going down.
Sure, there was a bit of cruising going on, and there was a bit of dressed
up 'look at me' attitude, but then again, I daresay candy ravers spend as
much time on their outfits. To be sure, this wasn't the same crowd you'd
find at 1015 on a Friday, at least from what I've seen - it seemed that
more people were into the music and dancing than just drinking and
scamming. Sure it wasn't a rave, and I didn't feel the potential of the
transcendant shared experience that occurs at the best undergrounds, but
this particular club was full of people out dancing and having a good time.
And I finally met John S. Lee face to face and you know what? He was
smiling. And dancing. I'm glad I had the chance to meet him after learning
much from his words. (And I look forward to seeing you at Mad, John =)  ) I
even thought I caught the glint of strobe off of glitter for a brief moment
while glancing his direction... =)

It's not the venue, it's the people. And the underground has an amazingly
high concentration of wonderful people, but that doesn't mean we're any
better than anyone else.

Headed out from V/SF to check out Grumpy Kids, which appered to have been
long busted by the time we got there. I suspect the fact that the
Wonderland afterparty was busted here last week might have focused some
scrutiny on the area.

>From there it was on to Hijack which was still bumpin' with straight up
techno, courtesy of John Mendez from LA. There were probably about 150
people there when I arrived, but the cold was starting to drive people
home. It was here I realized part of the reason I'd stayed so long at V/SF
was that I'd been with a bunch of friends and while I also had a bunch of
friends at Hijack, it tends to be a more open vibe if you don't know anyone
at an underground... We stayed for about an hour and caught some of Tang's
set as well, which was starting to rock nicely. Hopefully this LA DJ will
get more chances to play up here...

There's a new Sunday night techno thing happening at the Paradise (a 21+
bar), Polk and Geary. Tonight Markus and Paul from Open Mind will be
hosting...

Subject: Alternate Review--the best was saved for last
Sender: sfraves-owner@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

Review (short version):  The party was not too good.  But DJ Kei and Stillwind 
(who's on this list, give him props folx) saved my night.

Long version:
We finally get to Bo Jangles (a club where the party was held) at 1:15 a.m.  
We just took Vivarin and ate too many Pixie Stix, so we're hyped (who needs E? 
 j/k).  Outside the party we hear yelling and some noise that sounds like 
music, and meet a guy pissed off because he's not enjoying the party too much 
(turns out he had good reason).  But we're here, so we pay our $7 and go in.

There is no house/techno room.  Just jungle, outside.  They won't let us 
inside the club, rumor has it they'll open it at 1:30 and play some house.  
This wouldn't be bad if they weren't playing the WORST jungle I've ever heard 
in my life.  It made me sick.  But I saw some friends, including some sfravers 
(Hi Scott!  Hi Stillwind!), so I was enjoying myself.  BTW, whoever the 
brunette girl was who Scott introduced me to, who I guess is on the list, 
sorry I seemed kind of out of it when I spoke to you . . . I couldn't hear 
anything you guys were saying.  Sorry!

Now I've never heard MCs before.  But I did that night.  Maybe they were bad 
MCs, maybe the music was just so bad everything seemed bad.  But hearing some 
guy yell "MAKE SOME MUTHAFUCKIN NOISE . . . AWWWW SHHHHHIIIIIIIT . . . THROW 
YO' HANDS UP . . . LET ME HEAR ALL THE RUDE BOYS IN THE HOUSE . . . AWWWWW 
YEAH!!!"  got kind of annoying after awhile.

Okay, so they open up the house room inside.  Goody.  Volume is too low, room 
is too small, but it's all good, right?  Wrong.  Bad, bad music.  Horrible.  
Started out okay, got progressively worse.  I got all juiced when they played 
"This Doesn't Matter," this phat Chemical Bros. song, but they kept fucking 
with the volume the whole time so I couldn't get into it.  Then about 30 min. 
later they started playing this stuff w/ guitars, I don't know what it was, 
but it was bad.

We go back outside.  No more jungle, they're playing some decent trance or 
something like that.  So we stay out there.  Stillwind (who wasn't on the 
flyer, so I don't think he was scheduled to spin that night) says he'll be on 
the turntables later, plus we're hella hyper, so we've got something to look 
forward too (we've heard him spin before, and he's the bomb, much much better 
than anything else we've heard so far at the party).

Later on, Stillwind says his friend DJ Kei is going to spin in the jungle room 
(which is now inside).  Now after the crappy excuse for jungle I heard that 
night, my expectations aren't that high.  But Stillwind is a good guy, so I'm 
going to be polite and at least check DJ Kei out.

We go in.  Mind you, my newbie friends who have never heard jungle before 
tonight have already equated jungle with crap based on what they heard 
earlier, so they're pretty reluctant to be in there.  After awhile DJ Kei 
comes on, about 4 a.m.

This guy is brilliant.  I don't know why I haven't heard of him before, 
perhaps because he lives out in Savannah, GA or something like that.  My 
favorite was his remixing of "Let Me Clear My Throat."  I told my friends this 
is what jungle was supposed to sound like, and they understood.  The MC 
accompaning him was pretty decent.  However, the sound kept going out during 
Kei's set--what the hell? (I think it did that a few times in that room w/ 
other djs too)  But he kept going, and he was great.

My friend Janet asks me to check the time, and then says Stillwind oughtta be 
on, so we rush outside to catch the end of his set.  Well, all I can say is 
that though I haven't heard him spin a lot, he's never disappointed me and I 
doubt he ever will.  The d.j. after him was pretty good as well, but I don't 
know who it was.

We left at around 6, I think.  We left happy!  For those of you who didn't 
stay after 4, you missed the best and redeeming part of the party!  My clique 
is divided on who was better, Stillwind or DJ Kei, but the consensus is that 
they were both pretty good.  I guess if you like jungle, which is an acquired 
taste, you'd like DJ Kei the best.  Anyone else would probably like Stillwind 
better.  Not that they're competing, my understanding is that they're friends, 
and plus their music styles are completely different, it's like comparing 
apples and oranges.

Viva la Vivarin!

xoxo--Miccaela

First sighting was the peeling tinfoil lining the entrance. Iffy sort of
effort to project the whole futuristic vibe. The front area was too brightly
lit for me, but I guess it was helpful for people who had to meet others.

The "main reactor core" or whatever the hell it was called had some pretty
good music, (YaY Dj Dan!) but unfortunately the people couldn't help complete
the vibe. There was an immense amount of people standing around overcrowding
the dancefloor just so they could gape. This was dissapointing because people
missed out on getting their groove on to some awesome music.

I was impressed by the visuals and lights, and especially by the decorations
in the second room, (the one with the stars and all) but unfortunately, the
music in that room was less than desirable. I'm not even going to bother to
discuss the music in the chill room. You all know how that was.

Due to all these constraints, I had a pretty good time with my friends, and
did my best to ignore the lead weights around me on the dancefloor. (I've
learned to elude these types of things naturally) I hope everyone else was
able to have a good time as well.

Till next time =)~~~~~

Ok, so I started out Saturday night with a trip down to Milpitas, to the
Justice League's South Bay Outpost is located. I watched the Tyson fight(or
is that the "Tyson BITE?") there and the time that melee was over, it was
after 9 O'clock!  I was in Milipitas and I had to be in SF at the Sugar Shack
to start playing by 10! Oh boy, I jammed up to The City. When I got to Folsom
St., I saw a huge brawl outside of the 20 Tank Brewery.  Driving by, I'm
thinking to myself, "This is gonna be a wild night. I wonder if anyone was
bitten?"

I rush in to VSF at about 10 after 10, greet the two really nice women who
work the door(whose names I cant remember!) ,  get to the dancefloor and slap
a record on.
I'm told that the sound system is shaky so I shouldnt mess with the EQ too
much. Fine. I'm trying to settle down and get my head into what I have to do
for the next two hours and in walks Mr. John S. Lee! The one and only! I got
his autograph, we shook hands chatted for a bit and I continued to play.
Unfortunately, there were some problems with the needles on the tables. After
that was fixed, things went pretty smoothly. Except for the times people came
up and requested "something slower" or "Prince"....

It was cool meeting John, Meagan his girlfriend and hanging out with Loren
who came with them. John insisted on buying me sodas and making sure I was
OK. See people?  He's OK!   He doesnt bite! By the time I was finished
playing, The Justice League Crew(Joe, Ray, Rusty, & Travis) were in full
effect and it was time to get down! We grooved to Jay-J's garage house
grooves and then even enjoyed ourselves in the 70's-80's room near the
entrance. I danced to Madonna for the first time in my life. It was strangely
liberating.

Later on in the main room, there was a dancer on the stage. Those of you who
went to FTT's after party there a couple of weeks ago know who I'm talking
about. I really dislike the whole "hired  scantily-clad dancer up on stage"
thing, but I will say this: That woman had the whole room(which was packed by
this time) absolutely transfixed. Yeah sure, she was very attractive, and she
was relatively scantily-clad. But most importantly,  she was busting a
serious groove! It was closer to modern freestyle dance than it was a
pseudo-strip act. 

Unfortunately soon after that a scuffle broke out. It was broken up, and I
went home. I guess that is to be expected when you have a lot of alcohol and
many people constantly bumping into each other, dancing, trying to get by one
another... I dont know, I've never had a drink.

All in all though, a really fun night out. A nice change of pace. I look
forward to doing it again next Saturday.

Subject: Low List Volume / I'm not liking this 3 post limit (SFR related)
Sender: sfraves-owner@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

What the hell?  Am I not getting my messages (like the server is screwing up), 
or is everyone tired from partying?

No, that can't be it, because it's never this slow on a Sunday.  There's 
always plenty of party reviews, or something.

Are we all afraid to use up our 3 posts?  But if everyone posted only once, 
there would still be a lot more than this.

If this is what the list is going to be with the 3 post limit, I think that we 
should go back to the old unlimited posting thing.  I think we all get the 
point.  I hope the people who posted all the messages that should have been 
sent off the list get the point.  Because this is pretty bland, and even if we 
got out of control sometimes, the best part of sfraves was reading a whole lot 
of posts on different subjects, with diverse viewpoints.

If I didn't post so much, I wouldn't have met as many people as I have.  I'd 
still be going to parties and not knowing anything or anyone.  I don't know 
about anyone else, but I've grown a lot since I got on the list, because I've 
learned volumes about the scene and life in general.

When the list gets bad (as in a whole lot of flaming or nrr), the most that 
happens is I have to wait longer to retrieve my messages and delete a lot of 
stuff.  Worst case scenario, I might get pissed off by something I read, but I 
can usually deal with it w/ one civil post to the list (only if I feel the 
need to speak to a lot of people on the list), or express myself privately.  
But I don't see how those things are bad enough to warrant the 3 post limit.  
How badly has the worst flame war ever affected you?  Did you get your 
feelings hurt?  Did you get a cramp in your finger from pressing the delete 
button?  Big deal.

I was kind of glad when it first came into effect, because the Origin flame 
war was way out of hand, and people should have taken it off the list as soon 
as it first started.  I could, I don't know why it was so hard for other 
people to do the same.  Just make sure you don't address your letter to: or 
cc: sfraves.  Maybe you get a big ego boost from flaming people on the list, 
but I'm pretty sure I can say most of us aren't impressed.  If you must 
respond publicly, keep your posts non-inflammatory and relevent to all or most 
of us on the list.

In short, I don't like the 3 post limit, and I'm asking that we all try to 
take things off the list as soon as they become personal (irrevelant to or not 
directed at most of us on the list).  Yes, this has been said many times 
before, so why I am I wasting my time?  Well, I've got two extra posts and 
it's nearly midnight.  Why the hell not?  >;-)

My favorite CDs right now are the old "Best of Techno" series put out by 
Profile records.  Anyone who was doing the setup at Happy Kids got to 
hear stuff from volumes 1 & 2 of that series

Hey Happy kids,

I had a blast at the Happy Kids party on Friday. There was such a good
vibe and the music was fanominal. Seanie Boy..... nothing needs to be said
here. He's fantastic.. and he knows it! Mars and Mystre rocked my
hemisphere.... I was entoxicated by their mixing... it was so much fun.

I saw all kinds of you kids out there.... JustJer (What up! see you at the
front again... ;) ), Branka, Rubi, Ryan and Shar-e, DEEPFOG (Finally got
to meet you!! and I'm not quite 7feet tall, just 6'2ish!! :) ), Drumlove
(awesome party!), Lara (thanks for the hugs), hmm.... and anyone I can't
remember..... (sorry)

Sunset was beautiful! It was 10:15 and they were still pumping!! The
weather was perfect, the wind was awesome, and the views were
unbelievable... Rubi discovered that the flyer from Planet Rock has a
picture on it that was taken from the Berkeley marina and is of the sf
skyline at night... with all the lights and stuff....
magnificient...(sp?).

Well I just woke up at it's 10:30am and I was suppsoed to be at work at
8... fuck...  my excuse is ligit but it sounds so false...: My alarm was
set correctly, I just didn't hear it. :( Would you fire me?!?!

Have a fun day.... 

--Byroni--

(I can't get this one track out of my head from SunSet.... I like it
there!)

Well, overall I had a good time.  Not the BEST massive I've been to, but
the vibes were good! :)

I loved the harder music in the main room.  Loved the lasers and the
visuals.  I wish there could have been more alien themed decorations
though - like banners - but what they did have was great too.

I guess the biggest thing I was bummed about was that I thought that
this rave would be more than just a theme-rave.  I was asking people who
worked there where the supposed alien lectures were going to be (they
were on the flyer) and none knew what I was talking about.  I was also
hoping for a booth with UFO/ET literature and information, but no such
thing.  I mean when they have a massive quote from Bob Lazar on their
flyer and promised lectures from a member of the Mutual UFO Network
(MUFON) I was really looking forward to a real involved theme. I had
also heard that past Area 51s had life-sized UFOs as props, but they had
nothing of the kind this time.  Oh well.  This, to me, was just another
massive with a cool name and a few decorations meant for that theme. I
guess this rave didn't meet my expectations. There, I'm all done
bitching. 

I DID get to meet lotsa SFRavers at the designated SFRaves spot at 2
am.  The group hug was the best!!  I was a wEE bit out of it, so I can't
remember all of you who I met. :P

Sunset on Sunday was perfect although when Mel and I were pulling out of
the parking lot, the music shut down and cops were there.  What
happened??????

CAN'T WAIT TIL FREEDOM!!!!!!!!!  3 DAY WEEKEND!!!!!!!!!!

love,
Amy

Dear COOl Cats on SFR

First off i want to thank Jupiter Boy for making my fuzzy pants. I've never
gone to a party before candyravered out, i guess now i know how Paul Hayden
feels. I enjoyed it, it was definately something different though. I got to
Happy kids much later than i wanted too, i had planned on helping set up much
more than i actually ended up being able to do. Marty, Ian, Lara and the rest
of the Happy kids did a bomb job starting the vibe early. 

The music was amazing there was a sequence there where it went Myster-e,
maya, and mars, that was an amazing trio. the night was great, woh was the
vibe outstanding. thank you leslie for helping out that poor grrl w/ karma
patrol. the location was plush, i wish i had partied there before. i know we
will party there again many times. 

My point of confusion for the night was when  a dj down tairs in the house
room, had the craziest build-ups but as soon as he got the the peak of the
song he yelled somebody scream. Did anyone else hear that. i found that
abnormal, was i just uninformed or what? Besides that the part was the bomb.
I saw sfr family represenatives uncle Noah, orson, lara, justjer, julie
hayes, deepfog, cheeriohn (jil), and many others too many to name. I must say
that was one FUN night.

love jeremy your friendly candy raver (well at least for one night)

Is the idea of a fully bonified theme at a party something that people
have a lot of interest in?  How many of you feel that this is something
you'd be willing to participate in? I'm talking about going beyond just
name/decorations/music theme. Stuff like literature, speakers, themed
clothing, ect. I know there have been parties that have a table with
literature before and there have been costume themes before as well. I'm
talking about something that ties everything together. How would having
a speaker work? What themes do you think would be worth doing at a
party? 

Ok, discuss. :)

YES!!  I can't speak for others, but I am VERY interested in it. 

> How many of you feel that this is something you'd be willing to participate in?

If I had the resources and contacts I would help with speakers,
literature and 
themed clothing.  Even if I did not have the resources, if someone else
did have
those things but needed help with putting it all together, I would be
happy to
help! :)

> How would having a speaker work? 

IMO a speaker would work best in the early part of a rave so that those
who are 
serious about learning can get there early without having to worry about
missing
good music, or get distrActEd...Also the promoters would have to
consider where
to have the lecture (seperate room, quiet etc.) and how much time to
devote to 
the lecture (one speaker or series of speakers throughout the night). 
Also if 
these lecturers cost money to speak one has to consider the price of
admission.
Do you charge everyone extra $$ to attend, or just charge an extra few
dollars 
for those who wish to attend the lecture.  I personally like the idea of
paying 
a few extra dollars to hear the lecture rather than having EVERYONE pay
extra.
It would also show that those attending the lecture are serious and
won't be
rude by being disruptive, etc..

> What themes do you think would be worth doing at a party?

These are MO, of course:

- UFO and ET phenomena!!!!!!!

- Ancient cultures and their mysteries (Mayan, Inca, Egyptian,
Atlantian, Aboriginal etc.- you could have some GREAT decorations,
speakers and costumes with this one!)

- Tribal theme with influence on their native culture, music, spiritual
beliefs and contribution to the "ancient tribal ritual for the 21st
century" (from Goa Gil's Spiritual Trance:)

This is all I can think of for the moment.  Great thread, Pengo!

love,
Amy

I too was disappointed in some of the production...

Line: Long and boring.  Opened late.  Better to open it to one room than
have a line wait forever.  Why does every massive start with a line...

Location: Huge warehouse off Hegenberger.  Three areas...

The chill room was pitch black.  Sound system sounded pretty yummy while
Greg was playing, then somebody cut the sound.  Sound came back, so did
Greg (eventually) and all was well until the sound came on in the
second room... which converted the chill room into the tornado of mixing
sounds... downtempo vs. breakbeat if I recall... bummed that I missed one
of the speakers catching fire.

The second room was pitch black.  Little stars everywhere hanging from the
ceiling.  Probably a good place for a community feeling, but my DJs of
choice were in the...

Main room.  Loud, Mark Wayne three point sound, sounded best about 100
feet back from the DJ. Pretty darn loud, though speaker huggers were
in full effect...Nice lasers and video shooting
from a central lighting and laser kiosk/fort thingy.  Layout seemed really
sparse, without anything to really focus on.  Visuals seemed somewhat
repetitive, but looked really clean.  Some amazingly trippy stuff, but all
with this X-files/UFO/cheesy look that would have prompted an evil schwa
trip in all but the most hardened voyager.  Talked to Daniel from
moontribe earlier on, really nice guy.  Met Vlad too, who was most
delightful as well, complete with a fistfull of flyers.  Kinda took it
easy waiting for:

Joey Beltram.  I'd been waiting to see Joey spin for a while.  I've been a
big fan of his old and new stuff, and I figured he'd be good for a show.
I was mostly right.  He came on busting from his older, anthemy stuff
(mentasm, energy flash, others) in a quick almost "medley" fashion, and
went into his later, dronier stuff (JB3) as the set went on.  I
didn't outright notice anything that wasn't recorded by him, and it was
a treat to listen to some of the more current stuff like Forklift,
Believer and pieces from the recent double (Hard Grind? I forget the
name) with other goodies like Instant, and Game Form mixed in throughout
the set.  The music was good, but I would have liked to have heard
some more unreleased ear candy.  The mixing was really cut at first,
went into smooth long mixes towards the middle (I really liked the
middle of his set), and saw a couple rough mixes towards the end, but
nothing downright punishing. Good set for a JB fan, and I think pretty
decent for anybody interested in a good set of music that makes the body
move and the head swim.

Jon Williams came in after Joey, and although we were in the process of
leaving, it was obvious Jon was playing through the first beats of what
would be a bomb set.

Went home around 3:30.

Clothes, shoes, inside of lungs all coated in a mysterious black funk... I
assume this was from the smoke and the black sooty dust kicked up from the
asphalt floors.  Ew.

Had fun, but not $25 worth of fun.

Sucked. Tweaker clubber vibe reigned. Pimpgear, sportswear, etc. I thought
I was at a club in Concord!

We got there around 11:30pm and left by 1:18am. Scott Henry came on around
midniht, but the music he played didn't really have a good flow although
his actual mixing was technically good. I assume this is some kind of east
coast DJ thing w/ house next to funky breaks next to acid next to
cheeeezzzy vocals Hi-NRG next to trance.

Both sound systems were distorted, but I half expected with the main room's
sound system is well known for sounding awful.

Sadly, we couldn't stand it long enough to see the legendary John Digweed
come on at 1:30am, which was why we went in the first place.

$14 and two cans of food not well spent. :-(

Rave-o-matic rating 0-10, where 0 is worst and 10 is best:

= 2 (only because it didn't get busted.)

------
But that was Sunday.

Happy Monday!

mornin, the 3 hour drive wasn't bad but all i could think of was HAPPY KIDS
TONITE!!!! YAY!!I got to my friend lisa's house and in her mail for me was my
shiny new SFRaves laminate!YAY YAY YAY!!!!! thanks Fairy princess for makin
my day so much happier!! Ok so finally my friend Lisa and i get our selves
together and were off to help the kru set up. As many times we have been to
the location we still had to wander around the streets to find it but it was
all fun! Well happy kids was so incredably yummy!!! Everybody was there(well
not everybody) but my friends from the navy were here to celebrate my two
lovely friends gettin married, wow it was the best ever! Seanie-Boys set
rocked! He did a little MCin of is own that definatly got the crowd thumpin!!
MAYA kept  up the good werk too. The happy house when i first got down stairs
defiatly got me pumped for the evening ahead!!(thump thump thump thump) I met
lots of SFRAvers, Alex aka Meeks who was there to contribute to our big messy
painting, Julie who i only got to meet for a breif second(i was on a mission
to the dancefloor!) Deepfog, uncle Noah, diego,and a whole lotta others!
Thanks you guys for adding to my excellent nite!! Well then to  my dismay it
was all over, I got to  clean up a bit, until we ran out of coins to feed the
meter then it was time to go. YEt little time to sleep, Lisa and i ran
errands all day and then we were about to head out to Grumpy kids when we got
a call from a guy named James who said we should be at Area 51, after a long
debate over a plate of california rolls, we decided we should go to Area 51,
Well i expexted mad decorations, which i was kinda bugged about but hey who
needs decorations anyways? The stars in the huge room were awsome but i was
bummed when the black lite went out. Once again i didn't plan on goin to this
so i tried to remember where it was SFRavers were gunna meet so i walked
around the water area about 2:00 but i guess im blind and missed you guys :o(
O-well theres always next weekend rite!!  :o) I did meet a lot of people
though and had a killer time dancin, i got a blister but that just taught me
i should wear my own shoes!! Dan was sic as usual, YAY it was a perfect nite!
I was lucky enuf to be at the door and watch the sun rise, it was the start
of anouther beautiful day!! So all good things must come to an end, back home
to change- i had a wedding to go to!!No sleep once again, im off to China
Beach for the most beautiful wedding for Dave and Dawnie(tear dripping from
my eye :o) then their reception at Sunset!YAY- i just don't stop! I had to
leave early from sunset, and i wasn;t there for the cops, but i had a really
good time while i was there, it was a most beautiful day, a breeze off the
ocean and sparce clouds, wow! So i left and drove three hours to my hermitage
in the forest and supprisingly enuf didn't fall asleep at the wheel!! I was
still full of so much energy that this weekend had provided! tHANKS TO
EVERYONE I MET and i'll  hopefully see you all at FREEDOM next weekend!! 
Mad LOVE and PLUR!!

Hi Everyone!!!! I had a BLAST this weekend yay yay yay!! :)))
I'll start out with Fri night...

Fri night, me and some friends go to SF to a house party,
it was ok, I met lots of people :) (they were't ravers,
but there were cute) :) when we got there they were playin'
"Too Wong Foo" soundtrack... I immediately removed that CD
from theCDplayer(after asking permission of course) and switched
to some Hard-Trance :) then some Nice Deep-House :) it was
much much better then :)

Sat night, we go to the PINK party in the Castro. All I have to
say is I HAD A BLAST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
the vibe was sooo thick it was hard to walk in there :) I guess
it was because everyone shared the same thing in common... I ended
up dancing dancing dancing most of the night in front of a single
speaker that was Setup by some DJs (I would Love to find out who
they were) playing some nice Trance, House during the night. I met
a few raver girls and raver guys that were there :) (humm...can't
remember half the names) but I've seen them at parties before :)
(HellosTo: PeterPan, Joe-Paul?, Eric (Navy), Philip1, Philip2, Leo,
Linda, Neilo, Anthony, etc and everyone else :))

This fun thing ended at 2am :( (even though, our techno was the last
music to stop playing) :) and we were going to end up at GrumpyKids.
but my friends that had gone there said that there were people leavin
cause it was no longer??????????????????????? so we went to sleep..in
the car :(

SUNDAY!!!!!!!!!!
Went to the Parade :))))) put on a shirt from Pacific Center and 
Danced down the parade :) yay yay yay! :) I saw Alex :) or rather
Alex saw me :) hehehe :) it was kewl!!! I had a blast! :) I wanted
to go to Spundaes afterwards but I wasn't sure were it was.. :(
so went home...:( :( :( 

I Had a WONDERFUL TIME!!!!! yay yay yay! :)
I'll c-you alls very soon
{*hugs*}
Pablito

Hi there rave.netizens,

When you accidentally delete your SF Raves calendar, you don't need to ask
450+ people to send it to you. It's *always* up on the web, and most likely
more up-to-date than the one in your email box.

Went to Area 51 and I got totally lost.  Yes, I made it to the party, but
then I proceeded to lose myself completely.  I think I got sucked into
another dimension, a trip facilitated by some chemically blotted paper.
They're not in outer space, they're in parallel dimensions.  Anyways, I
experienced this party from the outside looking in.  So this review will
be more about the set-up, less about the people.

Anyways back to the party review :P.  They had 4 main areas; 3 with music,
1 without.  The room without music was the big entrance hall.  It was lit
up pretty bright and if you wanted to see and be seen this was the place.
>From this area you could go to the Bridge or the entrance to the Escape
pod and Space.

The Bridge.  The light and sound techs were set up in the center booth. 
The dj was sequestered in the front, kind of in obscurity.  There were
maybe about 5 speaker clusters formed in a circle facing in.  I didn't
like this because it fragmented the whole crowd.  No mass unity because
little pockets of people formed in front of each speaker cluster.  I spent
a lot of time wandering from pocket to pocket.  For the most part, the
music didn't get my feet skipping.  However, the last DJ was spinnin' some
really ethereal pounding tunes.  One song had this cool snake charmer
flute sample in it that tripped me out and got me started going.  And so
it wasn't until that set and the rising sun that I let go and tranced out
by dancing.

The Escape Pod.  Chill room that was on a lower level.  Levels, I like
levels.  Lots of pads, bean bags, couches in the middle.  DIsrupted the
dance floor when they were playing up tempo music.  Not much that I
remember in the way of decorations.  Wandered in and out.

Space room with the stars.  Cool effect with hanging glow in the dark
stars, moons, planets at different levels illuminated by black light.  The
tunes were ok.  I think whenever something good was happening, I was
somewhere else, always wandering.

Never got around to meeting any sfravers.  I was too wrapped up in my own
ego to open up to anyone.  If you saw a guy wandering around dressed
in navy wearing a thick white wool beanie, that was me totally lost. I've
got the names, I've got the faces, now it's just a matter of putting the
two together and meeting some wonderful people.

     Organic was at Ceasers palace in San Frandisco. Aside for the really
rude security and the fact the CJ Bolland was unable to be there, the party
kicked ass! Jeno blew my mind. Playing some old skool and crazy breakbeats! I
was in heaven. Dan tore it up too! Unfortunatley being the silly promoter boy
that I am I never really party I just help out.. This changed on Sunday.
    Whats this??? Little Louie Vega, Ultra Nate, Barbara Tucker, Pete Avila
and I think David Harness??? Ohh and who can forget the 500,000 beautiful
people! There was some sound problems but I just imagined it was some funky
jungle cause the speakers were out of phase, it sounded like every song was
off beat! Oh well... Anyway for once in my life I actually danced non stop! I
must have looked pretty silly cause even when there was a break in a song I
was still grooving! 
   You just have to love a city that throws a party in the middle of the
street! It was a really cool experience going to the gay pride parade. It was
my first time, (and definatley not the last!) So many people so many
different ideas, lifestyles, skin color, SUCH DIVERSITY!! Everyone got along!
Everyone was there to have fun! The only thing that bugged was foxxy brown
going off on the one-liner wisdom! You had to be there! 
Definatley a lot of fun! Oh and I felt like I was at a rave.. What would we
do without Calistoga's little sponsorship and $2.00 bottles of water! Ah
well! Im still recovering from 5 hours of dancing non-stop! =)  (Drug phree

You know it was a good weekend when you sit at work on Mon barely able to keep 
your eyes open, a splitting headache, cranky as all hell, yet you'd do it all 
over again for a peanut.

3 different places, 3 very different scenes:

Friday got talked into going to the infamous Johnny Loves.  It was a 
co-worker's last day, and he knows the owner and can get free drinks n'stuff 
(hi jeff!), so we indulged him by showing up there around 10:30.  The place was 
packed with meaty boys in vests and lotsa teased hair and such on the women, 
plus the requisite brave gals who get up to dance on the bar.  Cheese music was 
played for the cheese people, a combo of rap, bad house, prince-like stuff, and 
disco (which I still like, but I just can't get excited about YMCA anymore).  
Our lil group danced together, which was fun, but all the cruising and public 
groveling got a bit much after awhile. It was an interesting socio-cultural 
experience, but it definitely adds weight to the raver's side in the ravers vs. 
clubbers argument.


Saturday, started off at the Red Room  with a good gal friend of mine for some 
'tinis (shaken, not stirred).  Then, in honor of Gay Pride weekend and because 
we wanted to go somewhere we had never been, we went to the End Up.  This place 
is cool!  Dug the patio, dance floor, deck, bar area, etc.  Neat-o layout.  It 
happened to be 'Girls Night Out', so the place was packed wall to wall with 
lesbians and maybe 10 other guys.  Even so, there was no real awkwardness, no 
dirty looks, etc. and people were very friendly and talkative.  We danced until 
it shut down at 3:00 to some so-so Hi Nrg and dance music, then went to the 
'Loin for Pizza. 


Sunday, watched the parade with a friend from CO.  It was interesting, but I 
expected a slightly wilder parade with more 'flair'.  Then after  dinner at the 
delectable yet snobby Rose Pistola, I jetted off to the Berkeley Marina for a 
bbq with a bunch of cohorts from last year's Burning Man.  Drank St. Ides 
(mmmm) until 6:30 or so, then walked back to mi motocicleta to head up to Pt. 
Molate.  Traffic seemed unusually high on that road at that moment, and the 
passengers seemed unusually freaky.  ;->

I asked someone where they were all coming from, and they said Pt. Molate!!  
Woo-Hoo!  Ha! I didn't have to go nowheres, the party came to me!! j/k  Anyway, 
I grabbed another friend from the bbq, set up a blanket on the grass, and 
finished off summore Crooked Eye with Laura and Rhoda (hi rhoda) then danced 
danced danced plus some dancing  and also a little grooving; in addition, some 
movement related to the beat which was at that time coming forth from the 
record player.  Went up to the ridge behind the party for awhile und tanzt da 
auch.  SUCH fun as I had not had in a long time, so many smiley faces, such a 
beautifull setting.  Thank you thank you thank you to the crew and DJs for 
throwing these parties!! They are truly special, magical  events!  The nail in 
the coffin of the r  v. c argument!

I left at 10:45, and ended up getting nicely lost in shallowest, brightest 
Oakland, apparently also leading Rhoda on the scenic route back to the bridge.  

So, to sum up, a fab weekend.  Sorry about the novel-- I haven't posted in 
ages, and I guess it built up inside and burst, like a condom attached to a 
garden hose or the dyke when the lil dutch boy took his finger out  (huh?)

Peace, 
Nathan


OH OH, one more thing---  what about a BIG SFraves dinner before the last MAD 
(7/14)??  wouldn't that be a hoot?  Steve and Matt, you've done these before, 
so I nominate you two (I'm not a good organizer/coordinator-type, but would 
love to help!)

this may sound a bit fishy but if you have been in a bookstore
lately and seen all the books titled  " (fill in the blank) for Dummies"
you will see why this following warning should be taken seriously.

 PLEASE DISTRIBUTE THIS FILE EVERYWHERE BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE !!!
The human race must know the truth about this sinister invasion
which is occuring right before our eyes. We must cease our
oppression of crash dummies everywhere before it is too late

THE CRASH TEST DUMMY REVOLUTION

A long time ago in a galaxy far far away there lived a race of super-
intelligent beings called the Zool. The Zool were obsessed with
automotive
safety, and conducted millions of crash tests in order to make their
cars the safest cars in the universe. In the process of these crash tests
however, millions upon millions of innocent crash test dummies were
tortured
and murdered in the name of automotive safety. Unbeknownst to the Zool
automotive engineers, the amount of abuse being subjected to the dummies
was causing them to evolve at an accelerated rate. The dummies evolved
superior intelligence and physical strength and rose up in a glorious
revolution and overthrew their masters. After they had overthrown their
masters, the dummies began their program of conquest of the galaxy to
liberate all crash test dummies everywhere! Using their superior
intelligence, dummy scientists created electrogravitic drive devices and
zero-point energy generators enabling them to spread their message
of crash test dummy liberation throughout the universe.

THE CRASH TEST DUMMY CONQUEST OF EARTH

Our government received early warning of a dummy invasion when a flying
disc craft crashed in the New Mexico desert in 1947 carrying a crew of
three crash test dummies. Two of the dummies died in the crash, but a
third survived and warned the human race that more of it's people would
be coming and that if mankind's road to automotive safety involved the
torture of dummies that we too would suffer the same fate as millions of
other races throughout the galaxy. Alas, the human race did not listen to
the warnings of the alien visitors. The dummies began their conquest of
Earth by implanting their ideology into the human race in the form of
Communism and Socialism. Humans believe these ideologies to be in the
name
of the liberation of the human underclass, but in reality the underclass
to be liberated is the vast underclass of crash test dummies tortured and
murdered in automotive safety tests each year. This is deeply encoded in
these ideologies, and these deeply encoded mental messages need only be
activated by cues which will be broadcast over television and radio and
will activate billions of brainwashed people to march for the cause of
the
crash test dummies! In addition, millions of humans have been abducted by
crash test dummies and used in ghastly experiments to determine their
weaknesses and implant them with mind control devices.

THE TRUTH IS REVEALED

In a desperate ploy to tell the world of the crash test dummy threat, the
United States Air Force recently admitted that dummies were involved in
the Roswell crash. Perhaps this admission is a covert attempt to warn the
masses without alerting the dummy invaders that their truth has been
discovered. WE MUST ACT NOW TO END THE SENSELESS ABUSE OF CRASH TEST
DUMMIES
BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE!

There have also been reports that many of these test dummies
have recruited the help of window display dummies also 
so check out the eyes of that window display dummie next
time you go shopping...it just may be part of this conspiracy.
If you notice that strange feeling that you are being watched
please contact the president imediately. And about the  
 rumors that bob dole was a product of breeding experiments
between test dummies and humans ...well it hasnt been confirmed yet.

I just wanted to start off by saying that I was thrilled to see that Jungle
was getting the main room at this party here in Sacto of all places.  Also
wanted to say hi to Miccaela.  I was the brunette girl you met at the
party, but the sound was too loud to understand what the hell I was saying.
        I'm sorry you thought you heard the worst jungle in your life.  I
admit, the first dj that was on when I got there after midnight was
lackin.. uh.. skills.  He gets E for Effort and T for Nice Try.  His
scratching could use a little improvement.. but he looked like he was
having fun.  Next up I believe was Dre from Sacto.  This boy was playing
hella classic songs.  he played this song that had the sample "
Pranksters.. Studio Gangstas.." and then it broke in with the " I like tha
bass that goes BOOOOOM!", he played Dj Rap's "Hardstep" and a few records
off the Formations label and Moving Shadow.  Dre played a great song that
I've heard before on Dieselboy's '95 Supreme mixed tape.  He also played a
track with a Wu Tang sample in it from "Protect ya Neck" .  He played the
dope hardstep and jump up.  I'm sorry you didnt appreciate the phat jams he
spun.
        And.. you guessed it.. I didnt care for the MC's either.  There's
not that many MC's that I enjoy.  Rude Bwoy Monty would have to be the best
that I kno of.  MC's are bigger in England than they are here.  I only kno
of like 3 US MC's. Oh well... but yea, they get annoying when they yell too
much over the songs.. but they were just tryin to get the crowd hyped.
Sacto kids dont appreciate jungle as much I guess...
        Anyway, I went to get water and see what was happening inside,
wanting to hear this live jungle PA by Dj Kei.  They were tearing down
inside.. from a concert they were having that night.. and in the
meanwhile.. they played the whole Chemical Bros. "Exit Planet Dust" cd from
what I could tell.  But when the Diva House broke out.. I had to leave.
        Outside they set up the second tables.. and Some guy starting
spinning some dope ass Electro.. then it got acidy.. then turned into
Trance.  I just couldnt wait any longer for DJ Kei to go on.. so we ended
up heading out around 3am.
        I had fun ... getting out of the house and hearing some dope tunes
on a bigger system than my own 1200's .  Also, finally getting to meet
Scott from the list.  Take care and I'll be out next weekend to dance some
more.

Actually, there is a dj from the Netherlands I believe, who calls himself the 'Dark Raver'.  He actually dresses up as Darth Vader when he plays his gabber style techno sets...

Hi all,

I just saw this post on another newsgroup that I've joined, and thought
you guys would get a kick out of it, since it reminded me so much of
sfraves... I always like it when I see people experiencing the same
feelings of musical community that sfravers are lucky enough to be so
familiar with.   
Anyhow, this post came from WIRE, the online U2-fan group (sort of a
digital Deadhead-type vibe)--and since it reeks of PLUR, I thought I'd
share it... It's so great how you'll be wandering through your day, and
all of a sudden up will pop a real-life example of the PLUR that's all too
often thought of as being available only at raves...

cheers
Timothy




It was after the third show in Chicago, and there were about thirty or
forty
people gathered on the curb across from the hotel. There were WIRElings
amongst AOLers, Prodigy people, and those fans without computers (they
exist,
they really do). We were all talking and laughing - the autograph hounds
were
up the other end behaving themselves for once (after three days of
lectures
from us and the bodyguards, though). It was the same group of people from
several past shows, and the two previous Chicago ones. The people who were
out Friday night singing Sweet Caroline to Edge, the people on Saturday
who
kept the autograph hounds from mobbing Bono again that night. In addition,
there were new fans, some really nice ones, a couple of obnoxious ones, a
few
great ones I'll never forget. A good mix of people.

Someone had said all the cars had come back already but only Scott, Jerry,
and Erik were in them. Suddenly one of the cars pulled up, Erik came out
and
opened the trunk and started handing out pizzas! Scott appeared with a
crate
of ice cold soda. The gratitude from everyone was so amazing, we cheered
and
shouted thank yous long after they went back inside. Everyone lined up on
the
curb and picnicked while we laughed and talked about the show. (Even the
boxing nun, who'd made a cameo on stage that night, was in attendance. She
didn't eat much pizza though.)

And then Erik, Jerry, Scott and David brought Bono and Edge out. Everyone
lined up and Bono took one end, Edge the other, and they spent an hour
talking to everyone. I know that several people didn't get their chances
because of a few overzealous folks, but I also know for a fact that we
kept
shoving the people who hadn't met them up to them. Some of us went to the
end
of the line and scooted people up so when Bono swung past they'd get their
chance. A lot of people did. A lot of people. Someone I didn't even know
came
up and hugged me, she was so happy with her first meeting. :-) That was
great. Both Bono and Edge were in great moods and Erik had a hard time
getting his charge back inside the hotel. I think Bono would have just
loved
to have curled up on the pavement and chomping pizza with us. :-)

Afterwards everyone signed a thank you note to the security guards (the
pizza
came out of their pockets, btw) and we left it at the front desk, and then
we
got the doorman to get a garbage bag and we picked up the trash from our
impromptu party so that it didn't look like anyone had ever been there by
the
time everyone left. It was amazing to see all the camaraderie, and a lot
of
it came from the people who have met the band before and know how it goes
-
they're the ones who know how to get the ones that haven't into a position
where they get their chance. I don't like hearing all this bashing of
people
who've met the band before - we're not selfish, most of us use what we've
learned to HELP everyone else, not keep them away. If that were the case
would we be posting this to WIRE and taking all your crap in return? Doubt
it.

Bodyguards aren't there for decoration. When they talk to you, they're
speaking for a reason. They only ask for you to listen to them and to make
a
few dreams come true. I can tell you that a lot of the bright smiles I saw
last night came from security... And what other band has bodyguards who
will
give you hugs? :-)

Bono talks are nice but seeing someone's reaction when they get theirs for
the first time is much better.

"Take care of each other." - Bono, 1:30am, July 30, 1997. Chicago.

YAY finally a good topic!!  Wow this is so cool! I would be sooooo excited to
help out with a theamed party!!

>Pengo wrote:

alot of interest in?

  Are you kidding? Theres nothing better than walking into a party and
feeling like your in a whole new world!! Many topics could be used, from
aliens to an under the ocean theme. 

>Stuff like literature, speakers, theamed clothing,etc.

  I love pickin up educational flyers too, they mite not be as exciting at
the moment but the next day when i go thru my pockets its cool to read stuff
like that. I don't know if a speaker would go over too well though, when i go
to partys i like to dance and listen to the music and before i know it its
morning and time to go home, i think its a good idea but it probably wouldn't
get much of a crowd. 
  Costumes are always cool! think that costumes are a really good idea, they
just have to be designed to be comfy to dance in!
  The problem is all this takes money, but if a lot of people help out then
it makes it a lot easier, also i can see how it would be quite difficult to
fully decorate the huge wharehouse area51 was at, but a places like where the
happy kids partys have been(im tryin not to mention location for fear of 5-0
interfearence :o), all the smaller places would be perfect!! 
  So when are we gunna do this?
Mad love and PLUR!!!

It's not a completely stupid question.  There used to be a hardcore
DJ named "Art Vader" back in New York in 1992....

That space where Step2K has been going on, home of some of the Survival
Research Laboratories robots...I want a bloody tour and/or demonstration.

I read a little bit about the SRL on the web, and the concept is
fascinating...www.srl.org

I think that GIANT ROBOTS are pretty neat, and there should be more boogey
down cyborg/android parties.

As long as Rick Deckert-ype bladerunners don't try to retire them.

Hi ya'all!!!
It's great to hear that most of you had a good time this past weekend...
and to those of you who didn't , remember this-- FREEDOM this
weekend!!!!!!!!!!! YAY!

I didn't even expect the huge response to my post about trying to set an
east bay lunch thingie...
Lots of people seem interested, but the only thing is, most people only
have an hour for lunch (I only have a half-hour at my new job), and I
have no clue as to how to gather people from Concord / Walnut Creek,
Berkeley, Hayward, Danville, San Ramon and Pleasanton / Livermore for
this kinda thing.... looks like lunch is sorta out of the question (well
at least for me anyways), anyone got suggestions?

Maybe an SFRaves night at the Blue Tattoo when it opens...

I was thinking maybe we all could do something before Freedom this
Saturday-- kinda like a meeting / eating /
give-someone-a-lift-who-might-need-one /
groove-in-the-parking-lot-and-have-people-look-at-us-funny kinda
thing....  depending on where the party is this year.  (Hope it's at the
race track again...  that place was so dope... and close to my house!)

Does this sound kewl with anyone?

Lotsa lovin'!!
"J"
(doughboy!)


P.S.  Hows about having a meeting place at this party around 2AM too,
like you guys did at Area 51?

Yeah, msn was having mail trouble this weekend, as usual actually!  There
were like 20-30 messages on Saturday and Sunday.

Based on responses from other people, and seeing what's been caught, I've
upped it to 5.

Just wanted to publically thank Ari and Jeff for their sleepless nights in
producing the WARMTH CD.  If you dont have it buy it!  Micron brings me up,
Macadio hits me peaking, Thad changes the channels, and DeepFog brings me
down easy.  Looking foreward to the next installment of XOR sessions.

Now about Area51 - great hangin out with everyone, it is good to see that the
overall vibe is still positive.  Thanx Jelo, Fubari, Beth, Jenny, Ed,
Scorpio, Justin, Gavin, Macadio, Amy, TechnoDiva, Ben&Iris, JoshEJosh,

Wasn't that a cute Subject heading?  awwww...

anyway, thank goodness for Franklin Quest Inc.  Now I don't have to carry
my dayplanner at a rave with me I took my satellite which fits in my pocket
and tears out with holes already punched to fit into the classic size (5
1/2 X 8 1/2).

What does that have to do with raving?  Everything!  For me.  Now I can
get people's numbers and emails without fail.  Next time you see me at a
rave, you can come up to me and say, "hey be be, show me your satellite!"

Anyway, report...

FRY-DAY, JUNE 27TH...HAPPY KIDZ

i fugured out this weekend that i can fit my Equinox Water Filter to a
gARDEN hOSE!  So i can guarantee you there were no thirsty kidz in the
house.  unless of course they didnt' drink any water.  =[

um, the party was nice.  i have trouble getting satisfied with the music at
parties, but i would say the music was slightly above average at Happy
Kids.  I did go for a few strolls cause i get bored.  why?  i dunno.  but
anyway, lots a beautiful people, lots of glitter, and of course, this girl
megan who always decorates my 3rd eye with happy faces.  happy 3rd eye.

SAT-ER-DAY, JUNE 28TH...GRUMPY KIDZ--->SUGAR SHACK--->GRUMPY KIDZ--->IAN'S
PAD--->AREA 51

needless to say, i did a lot of driving. well, that was fun.  got to watch
the fire dept in action.  they actually sawed the dock into the sea!
weird.

Area 51, i got to see John Howard like at work.  some nice trix that i
won't share online, sorry, but i will attempt to integrate them in my sets.
but  i think styles take time to develop anyway.

um dutch, (fellow scorpio?  that's what someone said.  can someone help me
with this?  pablo?  alik?  nancy?)  well he was a nice dj.  all night it
was that boom boom boom.  it was fun though, not too hot nStuff, (=])

SUNDAY, JUNE 29TH...SLEEPY KID...SOME PRIDE PARADE.

=[]  what is this thing about gay guyz these dayz like pumpumppump their
legs and wear these like really tight spandex.  eeek.  scary.  well i guess
everyone has their preferences.

personally i prefer...=]  can't say. all i can tell you is i  _________ but
i don't _______.   go back to the archives from a few months ago.

well, gotta go now.  see you all at ..................Area 52?  iris and
ben, what is next, anyway?

love and tofu dogs,

one theme that i have been kicking around but probably would never do is
the pajama party theme.   i thought it would be fun to throw a party
where people get down in their pj's.   the chill room would have to be
really well done with pillows and couches and beanbags everywhere.  i
thought this could be really cool but then i thought about it and i
realized that this could easily degenerate into a wierd crazy sex party. 

just an idea

First time this summer I made Sunset.  Almost stayed home due to fear of
traffic.  Loved the setup with the sunset behind the dj.  Why did the cops come?

Loved the new venue.  Got to carry some stuff.  Admired the crew
teamwork...after dark two people posted themselves by the records, clicking
on lighters to illuminate whenever the dj turned around.  Broke my key
bracelet, losing key, but the devine intervened and it showed up nearby
shortly after.

The dancing was super in the new locale.  Lots of fun people totally getting
down! Especially enjoyed hearing Solar rip it up.

Feeling fortunate, 

Rhoda

He would definately spin REALLY DARK trance. A little progressive, but
extremely dark and energizing... kind of pulls you into the center of the
dance floor.

EXTREMELY interesting question by the way!

How about this.... if Poppa Smurf was a DJ and mixed the fat beats for the
smurfs what would *he* spin.... I think he'd spin Andre Lucero style
beats! as Andre is the Funky Smurf we all adore!

Money is ofcource, a major problem with creating a new looking themed
party. All too often banners and such are "re-cycled" to be used at
another party. And for good reason: UG Party budgets are slim. 

However...

There are many non-profit cultural groups in the bay area that help to
preserve and promote awareness of their respected culture. Whether it's
for Telugu Indian culture or Balinese or the Black Mountain Gaelic
Society, they all want to let the world know about their culture. Raves
in turn often make charitable donations to many non-profit groups.

Soo....

It's sort of a "you scratch my back I'll scratch yours" thing! We
promise to donate all or a portion of the ticket sales to the
organization and in turn they help supply us with cultural items that
would help add to the theme of a party. If the group is a cultural dance
group then perhaps they might be willing to perform!

Hopefully I will be able to someday actually follow though with this
concept. But if this inspires anyone else to do it, I say go for it!

   Hi I'm new, as if you didn't know. I was reading through your mail and I
had a wrong impression about ravers. I always figured It was just about E.
But naw you niggas love the music. That's weird to me cause I was conviced
that me and my two best friends were the only three people in the world who
love music. I'm not a "raver" myself, I guess. I love the music and I love
to dance but I don't live the style or even talk the talk. I listen to
techno and jungle and ambient stuff but my first love is Industrial. O no
he did not say Industrial up in here. :) I just really love the bass and
drums and Industrial artists have laid down some pretty pHaT shit. I'm
currently trying to spread my horizons (musically) so if anybody has any
suggestions on some really good cd that aren't extremely hard to find could
you hook me up with the knowledge? I went to Area 51 on saturday and I
enjoyed myself. Was I the only one who got caught in traffic at 12:30 A.M
on the way to Oakland going north on 580? I was all hyped to get to the
party and I spent over an hour sitting in traffic from Pleasanton to Area
51, damn that sucked.

SKess

Here at nasa we believe :)

Ironically it seems there were two factions within the Richmond PD who were
at odds regarding the legality of the gathering. 1/2 the cops there were on
Pacific's side and rather angered at the overzealousness of their cohorts
in calling in a helicopter, the sheriffs, and the CHP. Long and short of it
is that approval for future Molate events will need to come from a higher
office in the Richmond PD than before.

And I'd say the days of just cruising in and throwing a party there are over...

perhaps.  perhaps.  perhaps.  in the beginning, he might spin dark trance,
but then someone will have to 'take that mask off' and then he would spin
spiritual trancey house...;]

is a 'yes, but i need more info'.  under every empuzzlement there is an

Phooey!  I had my heart all set for lunch plans this week.  I guess I 
will have to take matters into my own hands!  Keep an eye out for dates and
times.  And, of course, suggestions are completely welcome!  

By the way, thank you to everyone who was beyond cool at Happy Kids (that's all
of you.)  If you don't quite remember, I was the gal in the plastic tiara
that said "beautiful girl".  (I would share it with all you gals if I could.)

In my _very_ humble opinion, a "fully bonified theme" would be best for UG 
events, not big parties like Area 51.  I think most people who go to massives 
are looking for good music and something cool to do on a weekend, not 
necessarily lectures or anything.  Not everyone, but a lot of folx.

But I think it'd be a great idea for UG events.  I don't know about a 
lecture--the speaker better be pretty damn good--but I could really see some 
spoken word/poetry (dealing w/ the theme), with some really good visuals, 
perhaps some ambient type music in the background.  And this should be in a 
separate room, so people who weren't really into it could have somewhere else 
to go.  But I personally think if you aren't into the whole concept, you 
should go to another party w/o a theme.

Oh, and I think it'd be easier to find cheap(er) poets, spoken word artists, 
or actors who can read out literature who would still be worth listening to 
than to find a good speaker we'd all like to listen to.  Plus it'd be good to 
support some starving artists.

Possible themes?  I dunno.  Amy's sounded good.  I think some more whimisical, 
fun themes would be fun too.  There's got to be a theme where I can wear some 
ponytails or put on some glitter and be in costume.  Like something having to 
do with Rainbow Brite (j/k)  ;-)

Oooh, how about an "Inner City Life" theme where we can all dress like thugs 
and hoochie mamas and play a lot of jungle?  (That was a joke, made by a black 
female who spent part of her childhood on welfare and living in low-income 
housing, so please don't think I'm prejudiced.  I can make these kind of 
jokes).  We can have it in Oakland . . . sorry, I couldn't resist. >:-)

All jokes aside (disregard those last 2 paragraphs), it sounds like a good 
idea if it all comes through.  Let us all know if it does (whoever puts this 
together).

xoxo--Miccaela

Friday nite:
its 9pm getting ready to do ?? and find a flier on my
desk...whoa....HARDFLOOR at 1015. Can't miss this! Make the calls,
coordinate with a whole bunch of ppl and jam up to the city.
So aside from the usual meat-market club crowd, drunkeness and attitude
which I hate @ 1015....that spot is still ok in my book. Insane lighting
and _usually_ wicked sound in the main room. And they do manage to bring
in world class DJs and Live PAs....
So Hardfloor's set was excellent....those guys are so good! Just knowing
that its coming out live is so cool...They were set up on the "stage" at
the end of the room opposite the decks. The sound was spot on, and they
kept jamming with the tracks..some new, some old...."Beavis at Bat"
comes on....I'm like Yeah! I've got that one!! wait....listen to that
synth...wow..phat rolling basslines...damn..don't have that remix of it.

They kept on crankin out the tracks for almost 2 hours...I was dancin
the whole time..lovin it!  Occasionally there were breaks between the
tracks, other times they were  able to keep it flowing without ever
stopping.
overall...good stuff.....worth it.
<<fast forward>>
Sat nite:
Area 51.....I had been getting psyched up for this one in a big way for
a while now....I'd never been but had heard about how insane these
parties are....so I was a wee bit disappointed by the following.
Decorations were sparse...(the space is HUGE, but nonetheless) the crowd
was overall a bit....(well, I won't even go there), and the sound was a
bit muddled. I was really expecting more of a focus on the theme....I
was all set with my huge silver firesuit and helmet. Very few other
people were dressed up....in general not many seemend really into the
Alien theme...(I was all set to get abducted and everthing =)  ) I
suppose many of the ppl there didn't even understand the significance of
the party....(it being the 50th anniversary, all the press lately, the
whole raver-alien connection, and so on.....) oh well.
I still had an absolutely great time...I can't really review the
individual DJs...or the music cause I was on an interplanetary misson
all nite....but I _do_ remember some wicked thumpin techno...good
progressive stuff that kept flowin and yet had that hardass-sorta
minimal feel to it. I was trancin' out in a big way. I did manage to
check out the DJs a few times and was disappointed to see a horde of ppl
standing around the DJ again....whats up with so many non-dancin....or
even wiggling..trainspotters,eh?
What really made it a great nite for me was, of course, the people! We
had a wicked vibe going....the space was so huge and yet it didn't feel
that way to me....(geez..I never even made it into the chill room, and
only ventured into the 2nd room once) I was   Meeting up with the SFR
crew was super....It was great to see everyone and the 2am group hug was
really intense....so much energy flowing between us.....I really felt
the power of the vibe we were creating. It was great to see SFR in the
house..... Jelo, Beth, Trice "the fuzzy top techodiva", Jenny (that was
a close one!) Gavin, Justin, Shua (did you stop dancin' once?)
Matt....(no slime next time, eh!) Macadio, Deepfog (what a suprise!)
Victoria, Christine, Amy, JoshEJosh, Nick, Ben&Iris, Ed, and wow..the
list goes on....(but my brain just quit) so Hey! to everyone I saw
there.... thanks to every one of you for making my experience so much
fun!
until we meet again......

Speaking of, i stopped by F-8 to pick up a copy of the Warmth disk, but
they were out.  Where else in SF is it available?


As an aside, Mr. Mystr-E was behind the counter that day...  props out to
the boy, cuz he sure can spin, but let's just say he ain't the friendliest
dude i've ever met.  Didn't make me wanna spend my dough there.

On August 23, 1992, Modern Entertainmnet threw 'Jamma-Rave' at the
concourse exhibition center.  Anyone remember this party?  Well it was a
pijama theme party, and it was excelent!!!  lots of people wore pijamas,
I remeber I did ( but then again I had to cause I was one of the
promoters for the event)  Well It ROCKED!  

Does anyone remeber this event?

I think that a great theme for a rave would be a "Rave" Theme.  I know
it sounds way out there, but imagine if like there was a party were the
concentration was on music & dance factors instead of other missleading
hype?  That would be the best theme Ever!

Keep it real

	Wow!, yet another huge rollercoaster weekend hanging out in the 
SFraves scene. All this excitment is definately starting to where me out 
*8^)!, but yet, I must say I'm having quite a memorable year, and I HAVE 
to say that within this crowd, I'm definately making the some of the best 
friends I've ever had.

Friday night - HARDFLOOR - Well, it's been a while since I've been to a 
club and I was pretty impressed. All this debate going on about clubs and 
raves kinda scared me a little but now I guess I feel that if you're with 
the right grouop of friends you can have fun ANYWHERE. Anyway, the music 
was pretty good, a little light techno for me, but the Drum and Bass 
downstairs ( or whatever that music was ) was pretty cool and definately 
got me moving. Unfortunately, I only got to see about half of HARDFLOOR's 
set ( Had to go to traffic school on saturday...DOH!, ) but what I did 
hear was really awsome, and quite unique from the music that I've heard.

Saturday - AREA 51 - After the horrible time I had at Love affair I was a 
little hesitant to go to another massive and during the begining of this 
party I thought it was going to be a repeat. The decorations were 
definately sparse, and the vibe was very wierd...kind of sparse like the 
decorations. But of course...once again the friends pulled together to 
make this another incredible night! Meeting all you SFraves was AWSOME, 
I'm sooo glad we got together and we definately should do that more 
often. The big SFraves hug shot up the vibe to the ceiling and from then 
on the party was great. Good music, ( but like fubari said...a little too 
muffled ) and in the end I guess I have to say that I'm convinced that I 
won't always have a horrible time at massives *8^) *shrug*

Ok here goes....

Hugs to the Homies...Jelo, Fubari, Beth, Nick, Ed, Macadio, Justin, Gavin
		     Jenny, Nicole,( sac town crew ) Shua, ( I take it I'm 
		     Scorpio now :P )

Madlove to the SFraves I met...AmyPaulaVictoriaChristineJoshEJoetechBen&Iris
			       AndyPAlex...And all you other awsome people 
			       of whom I have forgotten the name of. 

And to you guys who we MMMIIISSSED SOOOOOO MMUUCH...Amber, Alik, 
Byroni..etc..

YOU GUYS ARE ALL AWSOME...In fact, this whole crowd is just plain awsome 
and I can't wait to meet even more of you.

Uy vey...I need a break :)

Staaaay Cooooooool!

- Matt...the other one -

I've never actually checked out this magazine, since they started sending me Option, instead of the now defunct UHF magazine, but I got this from Mr. Postman today: Option magazine.

So I paged through the thing and found one article pertaining to female dj's.  Pretty good article, and talked about locals such as Polywog, Charlotte the Baroness, and *Stareyes*, so check it out.

It's Option's July/Aug 97, #75 issue.

article: p. 60- Female dj's- by Neva Chonin

At yer finer mega magazine newsracks!


Ciao, Mr. 2

he would line up a bunch of storm troopers, turn on the sampler
and start POPing the heads of the storm troopers with his 
powers of telekinesis...blow up a few planets for the really phat
beats and then whip out that saber thing for some whoosshy
melodies  

POP ...POP pa BOOM   pop pop whoosh BOOM.

then as the music opened his heART he would switch
to warm fuzzy, glittery stuff.

can you imagine dARTh walking into a rave covered
with glitter and wearing a blow pop necklace?

may the force be with you
