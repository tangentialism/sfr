I posted a comment about this a while back but didn't get around to

actually looking at the regs until now.


Can any one shed some light on the ability of government bodies (in this

case the city of Santa Barbara CA) to restrict our right to dance in

public. It strikes me that this is infringing on our rights of free

speech and the right of the people peaceably to assemble. What a bunch

of s__t! Here's some exerpts from the regs:


1)definition of Public Dance

"the words 'Public Dance' mean a gathering of persons in or upon any

premisis where dancing is participated in, either as the main purpose

for such gathering or as an incident or to some other purpose, and to

which the public is admitted."


section 5.20.030

A. It shall be unlawful for any person to conduct, or assist in

conducting, any public dance hall, dancing club, or any public dance in

the City, except under written permit issued by the Chief of Police of

the City"

B. It shall be unlawful for any person to participate in such a dance

conducted without the permit.


section 5.20.080

No public dance shall be allowed within the hours of one-thirty a.m. and

seven a.m. of any day.


Incidently, the owners of public drinking establishments have

successfully seen to it that these permits aren't issued to any

establishment that doesn't serve alcohol.


The police have a terrible record of selectively enforcing this

regulation


Please e-mail me as well as posting any responses. If any body knows a

lawyer that likes to rave, have them e-mail me with advice. There's a

bunch of unhappy ravers looking for some help

There are a lot of great things about the SF rave scene, but
there are also a lot of great things about scenes in other
cities.  I've met beautiful people from all over the place,
and every city has something unique to offer. I love going
back to cities like chicago and detroit, where the kids have
an ear for crazy complex rhythms, or to cities like Austin,
where the scene is so fresh that the kids are hearing the
music for the first time. Minneapolis and Columbus have some
of the most active groups of musicians (well, so do detroit
and chicago, now that I think about it).. I could go on;.
The point is that there are all sorts of great things going
on in lots of cities across the US, and I'd hate for anyone
to close their mind to the possibilities.

Good Day,

I have been consumed by school and this new computer since I returned from B-MAN.  If anyone needs to contact me for any reason,  please use this
address for now.  I have another IP on the wing that will be more permanent,
if it doesn't bite like this one.  I really miss all of you wonderful people  :)
and am looking to having a little more time to spend at least reading some
mail instead of spending 6-8 hr in class and at least that much time studying.

Take Care,
                   Jason

P.S.  Hope your having a wonderful day!

     I thought this was rather funny, so I took the liberty to pass it on

     Felis Catis,
     
     Is your taxonomic nomenclature 
     
     And endothermic quadraped
     
     Carniverous by nature?
     
     Your visual, olfactory and auditory senses
     
     Contribute to your hunting skills 
     
     And natural defenses
     
     I find myself intrigued by your subvocal oscillations
     
     A singular development
     
     Of cat communications
     
     That obviates your basic hedenistic predulation
     
     For a rythmic stroking of your fur
     
     To demonstrate affections 
     
     A tail is quite essential for your aerobic talents
     
     You would not be so agile
     
     If you lacked its counterbalance
     
     And when not being used to aid in locomotion
     
     It often serves to demonstrate
     
     The state of your emotion
     
     Oh, Spot
     
     The complex levels of behavior you display
     
     Connute a fairly well developed cognitive array
     
     And though you are not sentient,
     
     Spot,
     
     And do not comprehend
     
     I nonetheless consider you
     
     A true and valued friend.

	Hello again,

	I am at another dilema with my new car.  I want an alarm but
	I know NOTHING about car alarms.  So I was wondering if you could
	take a sec to tell me what alarm you think would be best for
	a new Honda Civic EX.

					Thank you,  =)

  This is probably NRR; but, on the ground that many ravers park their
cars in dangerous parts of town at weird hours of the night, here's my
public reply:
  There are a number of things you can do to keep your car secure: use a
car cover; install a Club on your steering wheel; always park it under a
street lamp at night; etc. For your car stereo, buy a unit with a
removable faceplate; don't leave loose CDs or tapes where they can be
seen; etc. 
  For car alarms, there is a whole world of protective options, including
one unit that will gas intruders! But for normal folks:
  Believe it or not, the most important element of a car alarm is the
flashing red light goes on when the alarm is activated. That tells would-be
thieves, even before they break in, that there will be a commotion. The
light encourages them to look for another car to rip off.
  I like the Champion Mark 3 system, made by Avital, though there may be
too many options for some folks' taste. The best thing to do is to look in
the Yellow Pages under Car Stereo and Alarm, talk to the folks, and
compare prices.

Hear me, mark me, learn me, throw the mind's ear open. Shut up the

This is a message I just sent to Marc Fathauer, marcus@technologik.com

I thought that some of you may find this informative:

Hello Marc,
Unfortunately for you, these laws are being enforced now.  Gone are the 
days when the cops would come to our parties in Santa Barbara and say, 
"This is kind of cool.  It's like the 60's or something," and go away 
stating that we should call them if we have any problems.  Now I did go 
to a party there a few weeks ago that was in East Camino Cielo that was 
really cool, but its too bad that we had to get driven so far up in the 
hills.  Don't get me wrong, the location was EPIC, but what happens when 
it gets cold?  

This is maybe something that you should work out with local authorities.  
Talk to the powers that be and see what they would like to see in order 
for you to have your parties.  Perhaps some parties where a portion of 
the proceeds go toward a local charity.  What would it take for you to 
get a permit for a night.  Hire off-duty police officers for security 
(lessens the bust factor).  Find a location that is at least several 
blocks away from the nearest residence (noise complaints).

Unfortunately, there is a system that we have to work within in order for 
us to have some fun.  If we try to circumvent the law, it can bite us in 
the ass!  Eventually, if we keep working towards it, things can change.  
Don't Give Up!  We just need to keep on keeping on!

- Andre Lucero

I received the following forgery today. It is a variation on a pager scam
that has been going on, in which a person is paged with a number in the

Just thought I would let you all know in case you receive a similar

A young man goes into a drug store to buy condoms.

The pharmacist says the condoms come in packs of 3, 9 or 12 and asks which
the young man wants.

"Well," he said, "I've been seeing this girl for a while and she's really
hot.  I want the condoms because I think tonight's "the" night.  We're
having dinner with her parents, and then we're going out.  And I've got a
feeling I'm gonna get lucky after that.

Once she's had me, she'll want me all the time, so you'd better give
me the 12 pack."

The young man makes his purchase and leaves.

Later that evening, he sits down to dinner with his girlfriend and her
parents.

He asks if he might give the blessing, and they agree.  He begins the
prayer, but continues praying for several minutes.

The girl leans over and says, "You never told me that you were such a
religious person."

He leans over to her and says, "You never told me that your father is a
pharmacist."

Hello!

        Well thank you to everyone that came out last Saturday! I had so
much fun!! I am proud to say that I did not work at all during the party!!!!
I did however join the "walking dead" in the clean-up portion of the night.
=(   But I had to!! 

        I really want to thank all of the people that set that party up so
well!!! You guys really did a great job!!! I am really glad to see that a
lot of the new 3 year crew is still going to be helping out with the future
parties!!! New people=new energy and ideas!!! (very nessesary!!!) Your
energy and efforts do more than bring new props to our parties, or just
supply Harmony with a newer, fresher and bigger crew... You guys inspire me
and the rest of Harmony to keep doing this. You show me that, yes, what we
are doing is needed (and apprieciated)!!! But anyways, I am not going to
name names, but you all know who you are!!! So, thank you!!! =)
        (by the way, there is going to be a Harmony meetting sometime soon
so get in touch with me!)
        
        Anyways, I also did expirience the "oh my god, it's 5:30am" feeling.
I was stuned!! I had no idea what was going on, who was playing, where the
crew was, if evryone got paid, etc. But I didn't even give a s**t!! But,
yeah, where did the time go?!!  Whatever!! =)

        So, I had a lot of fun, and I really hope all of you who came did
too! And I will see you @ Charity!!!

Peace and love,

Greg =)

Age does not necessarily determine a maturity factor.  I know many people 
below the age of eighteen who have far more maturity than the majority of 
people who have an average age of twenty-three.  Perhaps they are not as 
well versed in the ways of how to be a *cool* San Francisco *raver* (is 
this a good or bad term?), but they may be some really nice, genuine and 
interesting people.  

I understand if your experience is receiving bad interactions from these 
people, but if it's just from looking around and seeing how young these 
people are, isn't that being prejudiced?  I remember being young too.  I 
remember going to parties when I was young.  Back then, I was treated 
with much more respect than the younger party goers are given now.

Is it just me, or do you find there tends to be more attitude at 21+ 
nightclubs than at all ages raves?  Hmmmm.  Who's more mature?

My 60 pesos,
Andre

Subject: The present condition of Omar!
Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

Hello again,

        I went to Reno yesterday to go see Omar. I did the marathon run (bad
idea)! We left at 2pm and got there at 6pm, then left to come home at 11pm
and got here at 4am... Uhhh...  Never again!!! (at least with my car, the
Metro, it was scarry) 

        Anyways, he is doing a lot better!!! He is still in a coma, however
he has the strength to open his eyes and move his body. He has begun to
track with his eyes (which means he can recognize you and follow you as you
walk around his bed). This is great news, because it is a major step towards
him coming out of his coma!! But here is the bad news... The doctors think
that due to nerve damage, (not brain damage) Omar has lost the use of his
left arm. This is not a definate thing yet, but his left arm does not
respond to stimuli nor does he move it at all. But we'll see what happens
when he wakes up. But now the good news... 
        
        I was at his bedside, and he was just moving around, trying to
turnover or something, (he can't completely turn over cause the doctors have
him tied to the bed right now). He was very spacey, and not really ever
paying any attention to the fact that Matt and I where there. I don't really
think he new we where there yet. But, I leaned over and grabbed his hand. He
did not squeeze my hand in return. But then I started talking to him about
what is happening to him, the support that he is getting from all of us,
etc. And he stopped everything that he was doing. He stopped moving, he
stopped blinking really fast, and he looked straight at me, squeezed my hand
and got that face that Omar always makes when he is really interested in
what you are talking about!! When he did this, I began to wonder if he new
who I was or what the hell I was talking about. I asked him to squeeze my
hand as hard as he could if he new who I was, and could recognize me.  And
he did!!! (It actually kinda hurt my hand) At moments, he was very attentive
and alert, but then sometimes he would just pass out!!!

        We could not stay too long, cause it was getting late, and Matt had
lost all of our money at the casino, so we left!!! But before we left, we
went back to Omar's room to say goodby. I leaned over Omar and told him I
was leaving, and he got this wierd look in his eyes. (like a "don't leave, I
am scarred" look) So, I didn't want to just go like that... I looked at him
and told him who much we all love him, and how we are all pulling for him,
and he started getting a happy expression on his face again!!! I grabbed his
arm, (as a sort of hug, cause you can't really hug him, his ribs are broken)
trying to show him some sort of sign of strong love, and I said goodby. He
then grabbed my arm, and actually pulled me down onto the bed, and gave me a
hug!!! (or at least as good as he could with his arm tied to the bed) I was
so fucking happy!!! He is still Omar!!! He understood that we are all here
for him, and that he is being the recipient of a ton of positive energy!!!
He looks a lot better than the last time I was there!!! (thank god)

        Matt has his own storries as well, so maybe when he gets home he
will post about Omar too!! Also, I told Omar that I will be organizing a
party for him. I asked him if he could squeeze my hand if he wanted it to
happen, and he did!!! So, it is going to happen!!! 

Peace,

Greg =)

I was just wondering what was happening  with TF.

So who's going to this, anyway?  I must confess to be a little disappointed
at it not being at the same location as the one in June, and I'm not
entirely prepared to do another 7 hour drive (what it took for us, stops
included, to get from home to the actual BM site) to get there.  And I must
also confess a reluctance to go camp in the Nevada desert again, having just
done so little more than a month ago (don't really feel like doing that till
next BM, should it occur).  Alas!  I may have to pass on this one and just
fill my three-day weekend (Columbus day, Bank holiday! woohoo!) with fun &
frivolity on the homeward front...

So what're you folks' plans for that merry weekend?

Shawna

while i normally *lurk* on this list, just taking in the positive vibe, i was *so* moved 
by the following post that i just had to say something.

i do not personally know gregory or matt.  however, i have to say that i am so inspired by 
the love and genuine care that these guys (and many others i'm sure) have for a member of 
the family.

i am relatively new to scene, at least as far as going to parties but i have been on this 
list since 06/01/96, although i did got to a harmony party held on a beach off highway 1 
(in july, i think).  i was the guy dancing on the rock in front of the arch.  i am forever 
in awe and amazement at the display of positive vibe that this list has toward other 
people and life in general.

even though i really don't have the time to go to parties, i am on this list because it is 
a way for me to feel connected to the beautiful people on this list.  if only i could find 
the time, money, gas, etc to meet most of you and dance and hug and smile and share my 
love with you all. :-)

when someone on the list posts something about a great party, even though i wasn't 
there... i see the smiles and hear the beat and feel the love.

so to greg and matt and leslie and others like them (including john kawamoto who i met at 
the harmony party) i want to say: 

"keep spreading the vibe because you continually inspire not only me but i'm sure 
countless others."

PLUR,

hug!!! (or at least as good as he could with his arm tied to the bed) I 
was
so fucking happy!!! He is still Omar!!! He understood that we are all 
here
for him, and that he is being the recipient of a ton of positive 
energy!!!
He looks a lot better than the last time I was there!!! (thank god)
 
Peace,
Greg =)

You definitely have a good point Andre! There are some parties where you 
go to, and you can see how immature some old the older people are, and 
there are some 21+ parties, where you see how stupid that particular 
person is acting . . . and this will never change! That's what makes the 
scene so diverse, the age, attitude, and maturity of all the people.  Peace!

Here's the info that Tony was asking about -->

October 12 and 13th 
Planetarium a Cloud Factory camping trip
$15 proceeds split 50/50 btwn Cloud Factory sound fund and Omar's Healing 
								Fund

djs confirmed so far are (this is on two systems) ...

... jason (sd), spinsilver, jeff (lettuce dance), astronaut scott, mike 
clay (live), brian flipp, k-go (st. louis), tim/jeremy (live), swoops, 
stonie, christian, sig/tina, gizmo (eug, or), lee (harmony), drenalin, 
jeyson, the inTIMidator, cloud, deaks, joe rice (plus one), brad (c-lab), 
maya, monty, (to be confirmed still) ... john carel, moonpup, gabba dave

This event is going to be about 3 hours north of SF on privately owned 
land.  The location is in the north of Sonoma county, there is a 9 mile 
dirt road up to the property.  We recommend a car that you trust, we'll 
have some more coherent suggestions regarding what to bring/how to 
travel, etc. sometime this or next week.

We have djs scheduled from noon sat. until noon Sunday, we highly suggest 
getting an early start so you can see the sunset, which is one of the 
most amazing parts of this space.  The space is literally on top of a 
mountain and the view is a nice 360 one.  You can see a couple pictures 
of the site at http://www.cloudfactory.org/planetarium.html

We are having the tickets printed today and hope to have some out in 
stores for presale next week, I'll send out a post when that 
materializes!  If you have any questions just send me some email.

love drenalin

>>Dear Mrs. Carmen,

>>
>>     - On the shelf under medicine cabinet - 18 Camay in 4 stacks of 4 and

>>
>>     - On the Kleenex dispenser - 11 Camay in 2 stacks of 4 and 1 stack of

>>
>>     - On the bedroom dresser - 1 stack of 3 Cashmere Bouquet, 
>>
>>     - 1 stack of 4 hotel-size Ivory, and 8 Camay in 2 stacks of 4. 
>>
>>     - Inside the medicine cabinet - 14 Camay in 3 stacks of 4 and 1 stack 
>>       of 2.
>>
>>     - In the shower soap dish - 6 Camay, very moist. 
>>
>>     - On the northeast corner of tub - 1 Cashmere Bouquet, slightly used. 
>>
>>     - On the northwest corner of tub - 6 Camays in 2 stacks of 3. 
>>
>>     Please ask Kathy when she services my room to make sure the stacks are

Hi All,

I've set up a website at <http://www.deeje.com/soapbox/> and have 
organized a monthly collection of essays, short stories, humor, painting, 
and animations that I really really want to share with the SFRaves list.

Why?  Because from just two raves (both Harmony), you all have touched me 
profoundly, and probably don't even know it.  This is an extension of my 
expressiveness at raves.  In fact, I wrote a short story about my first 
two experiences, and I would love for all of you to read it.

Also, I have asked if I could include a post by KaySEE, because it was 
just so well worded!

Please, visit.  I hope it brings a smile.

Thanks, peace, and love,

deeje

The beta version will probably expire in 30/60/90 days too.  Try
setting your computer date ahead a year and see if it still works.  Just
enough time to get you hooked on a beta package.  :)

Eudora Pro 2.2 has the capabilities of filtering as well.  I live by
it.  I picked up my copy online for $49 recently, and I get a free
upgrade to 3.0 when it gets released.

Dear Greg,

	This is really good to hear!  I don't recall whether I ever met
Omar, but I've been thinking of him since Burning Man, and I'm glad to
hear you say he responded and may be recovering.
	I guess there's not much else to say.  

Happy (belated) birthday & best wishes,

I was just wondering about a couple of events that are coming up. 

-What's the latest on Friends and Family?
-Anybody know about a party at Bonnie Dune? I've heard good things.

The folks from Planet Orgo are presenting another F'Tumsh! this thursday
(3rd October) featuring Markie and Tracey in the Raw. They can be found on
boarding
the Orgon shuttlecraft. Acheived through the time portal located  through
the door of 414 Haight Street. Earthlings know this as the Top. First
shuttle leaves at 10pm earth time and may return sometime this side of
yesterday.

Thursday 17 October an unusual phenonemon may also be observed by the very
wary. Space Dog Felix and Star Cat Andre Lucero will be performing their
molecular motion rituals. Bring a test tube and someone to hold your hand.

Holy Lord of the Grand Vacuum F'Tumsh blesses you all.

Hello netpeople and techno lovers (at least I hope so)

As the title indicates I am a newbie to this list. I have been getting 
the email but haven't had the time to contribute. I just moved to this 
area (I'm in Livermore - East Bay) back in January of this year.

Previously I lived in Texas, but not born there...just going to school. I 
have always loved techno/rave/synth music. Most of my friends couldn't 
understand how I could listen to it hour after hour.

I'm not really looking to get too deeply into the rave scene and am 
looking for friends to email directly. I am looking for an older crowd 
and honestly can't say I have gotten a sense of the age range of this 
list. I am assuming all ages are represented here. I'm 25 and enjoy the 
music for the music. I have never really been in the scene because I 
never had that environment or opportunity around me.

I would enjoying trying out some clubs and or a couple raves...but don't 
have any friends that like the same type of music.

So I'm writing this email. If you have room for one more friend that 
likes the same type of music then I would love to get to know some 
people. I have a lot of talents and would like to get to know things 
about other people with the same interests. I work in the software 
industry so technology is a love.

Please email me personally or post a reply to this list (if you don't 
mind the superfluous traffic)
If you wanna flame me then send that one personally also.

Thanks for sharing my same interests!

Sincerely,

Matt Petrowsky

There ain't no such thing as a newbie.  We've all been here before.

     I have two wonderful kitties who are looking for a new room-mate. 
     Their owner is moving and can't take the cats with her. Here's a 
     description: 2 two year old brothers, both are smokey grey, one's 
     fluffy and the other's short-haired, both neutered, have had regular 
     shots, flea treatments etc. But most importantly they are soooo cute 
     and wonderful and love to sit in your lap, curl up and get chin rubs. 
     If anyone out there can adopt 2 wonderful new friends please mail me 
     back.
     
     p.s. they have beds, combs, collars and all the stuff they need.
     
     Thanks everyone!

well if the times can jive.

Hello,


Well I know that this guy isn't Mr Popularity on this list, but he is in
need, and has requested my assistance in posting this message.  I do
consider him a nice guy, save a few flaws.. However We all have flaws in
this cycle...

So Without further ado....

Mr. Brian Darkness is in need of a place to stay for a few days to a
week.  He did state to me that he is willing to pay for the time he
stays and is in somewhat of a dire need (He is currently living in his
car).  If any of you out there feel you can help him out in this
situation, please respond as to which I can foward a number to contact
him...

Precedence: bulk

In light of the fact that I have advicated a positive & rave related
agenda......the following is a complete NRR item that I feel must be
addressed..... 
 
I would just like to announce to everyone on the list, that before eric
dunkelberger starts telling you all what a jerk I am, I will announce it
myself. I AM A JERK TO ERIC DUNKELBERGER......... 
 
I wish to appologize to anyone who I have (according to eric) been rude to
over the phone.........  
 
eric & I are having a $$ dispute that we dis-agree on......and he has
threatened to denounce me and my reputation.......... to many of you. 
 
for those that know me personally, I feel justified in any actions I take,
and have tried to be a positive type of characture.......for those of you
who don't know me I guess you'll never know where I am coming from...... 
 
If I have taken a negative route, (in regard to our $$ workings)......Know
that I hAve my reasons........and I am not some kind of rip-off or
scumbag....... I am just reacting to a series of issues that evolved during
my visit to  the U.K. while eric made up his own rules, and it cost me
plenty in communication (or should I say lack of communication), as well as
deleting some programs & e-mail addresses etc.... etc.... 
 
there is alot more, but I do not wish to get into a public forum regarding
these issues.........but I primarily wanted to apologize to those of you
who have been talking with eric about me and I'm sorry if I appeared
rude..........to anyone.

Dear Friends,

sitting on the couch last night, watching TV and recovering from a short trip
to Hawaii with Mrs. Frying Dutchman I zapped to a program called "Extra".
They had an interesting item on methods for the treatment of pain at
the dentist, using electrodes placed on the jaw and allowing the patient
to regulate the amount of anasthesia by controlling the current send
through the electrodes. (Hmm, got to get me one of those sets and experi-
ment with where to place the electrodes... ;) ). Nothing really new there
but in addition to that, they gave the patient something what looked
like virtual reality glasses and headphones and displayed the kind of
computer animations that would not be out of place at your average rave.
This, combined with what they called "sound effects" (yeah right, probably
the latest gabber mix tape), was supposed to distract the patients atten-
tion from the sound and workings of the dentist drill.

Wow. Going to the dentist is going to be fun again! Imagine that, regulating
your electronic anasthesia while looking at trippy videos and listening to
whatever you're allowed to bring with you on tape. This offers new
opportunities
to the VR people I'd say. Hmm, perhaps I should get my last two wisdom
teeth removed?

I see that Doc Martin is playing at the Maritime Hall tomorrow night. 
Has anybody been to a Thursday night there? 

I've just decided to take the rest of the week off work and I'm looking 
for places to abuse my mind and body. 

See you at Come-Unity tonight.

I said before that I had been to my last Wish, but with Mars and
Mystr-E there, it's a totally different kind of party than the usual
Wish.

So my arm has been sufficiently twisted; I'll be there tonight with
bells (and blinking lights) on! Besides, my new dwelling is only a
couple of blocks away from the Bahia (living in SoMa *rocks*), so I
have no excuse to stay home :)

Steve

My friends band, Mephiskapholies, from NYC is playing in Berkeley Square
tomorrow night (Thursday).  I don't have all the information yet cause I
haven't actually talked to them but I'll post more tomorrow.  

I believe they are playing with the Blue Meanies.

I was there last thursday.  The space is ok, but they are in dire need of
a decent sound person.  The soundsystem in the "main" area was muddy, and
the highs were painful, and overall was much too loud to be enjoyable. The
"other" room didn't have adequate bass and was overdriven. The crowd was
sparse, and for the most part pretty young.  I was looking forward to
hearing Doc spin this week but after last weeks letdown (and hearing of
similar experiences on past thursdays from others), I don't know if I'll
bother...  free b4 10 though...

SFRavers,

I oppologize for this entering onto the list.  I refuse to waste your time

Better yet, let's eat those vegetarians, I've heard they're supposed to

Help!

I was on the phone today with my mom (who is still trapped in Rhode Island),
and she says:
"I hope you're not getting so involved with this rave scene"
uh oh.
"um, I don't suppose you watched Leeza the other day?"

Yes, *my* mom, with all her years of hipness, coolness, being an
artist, a supporter of music and underground arts, an ex-hippie, a New
Yorker, and the owner of a really cool wardrobe, watched the Leeza
show and returned with the impression that raves are big drug-fests.

She's even *been* to a rave before...  So I told her about Leslie, and
how we were friends, and how the show was designed to be a bunch of
sensationalistic media-hype, etc, etc. Seemed to ease her mind
a little bit. But then she asked,
"*You* haven't started using drugs, too, have you?"

So I admitted to my heroin habit :) She wasn't amused, but I got a
hearty chuckle out of my office mate ;)

Anyway, my point is: if *my* mom (who ranks very high on the cool mom
scale) could be influenced by this, can you imagine what Teenage
America's parents are thinking right now???

Oh well, it's things like this that keep us underground.

Steve

I have been watching this NRR thing go back and forth for a while....and am
now ready to throw in my $.02.  Part of the reason i subscribed to sfraves
is for the feeling of community of all the people on here.  Now, while i
love to read reviews about parties nad am DEFINETELY interested in all of
the other rave related material, i really enjoy the people and sense of
community that is offered by this list.  It is here to serve everyone on the
list and if people want to exchange other information and ideas or plan
things together, then power to them.  I mean, where else am i gonna find a
100 people in the bay area that are into what i'm really into and can easily
exchange information with them.

I, do however, fully support the idea of putting a NRR heading on all
material that is directly non-rave, that way if u are really against talking
or sharing other ideas with these people, u don't have to.  

I really like the list and everyone on it and would like to see it progress.

I'll probably get blasted for this, but hey it's how i feel, and i feel like
i have a valid opinion.

PLUR to every last one of you,
Micron

Uhm, isn't that true? I understand what you mean, i.e. there's much more
to raving than drug use but on the other hand I feel we're fooling ourselves
and the general public reached by the (s)Leeza show, by suggesting that
drugs are not abundantly present and used in our community. In fact, I
doubt whether raving would be what it is today without mdma becoming
available to lots of people in the late 1980's. Perhaps, instead of
apologizing for and marginalizing the role of drugs in raving it would be
more honest to state that our scene allows everyone who is part of it
to experience it in the manner that suits her/him best. Raving
is going to be trashed no matter what we say about the other aspects of
it because of its relation with recreational drug use. If we (would) want
to explain it to our parents or the media we need to clarify our stand
on this issue instead of keeping things vague with statements like "not
everybody at raves uses drugs". If we value personal freedom regarding
this matter we should say so. Note that I do not suggest that we should
advice people to take drugs but rather defend the right of each
individual to decide for themselves and act upon it. It wouldn't hurt
either to counteract some of the lies and misinformation that have been
flooding the media over the past decades regarding drugs, which has lead
to situations like the one descibed below:

The Underground is a beautiful thing and maybe should remain what it is.
On the other hand, this country and the world could use some of the raver-
family values that are referred to so often on this list (i.e.. PLUR).
Now how do we get them out there without being portrayed all the time
as devilish drug fiends corrupting the youth of the nation? Teaching
people tolerance in as many contexts as possible might be a first step.

Just my $0.02

Ha ha ha ha

this one made my slooow afternoon at work

I too have a New Yawker, ex-hippie, progressive, arty mom... who was 
entirely supportive and excited when I explained to her what raving is to 
me (INCLUDING mind-expanding and empathy-inducing drugs).  She saw right 
away that it was this generation's incarnation of the 60's 
countercultural movement.

:)
I am beyond grateful for my liberal upbringing!!!

However, I feel that sometimes the discussion gets a little bitchy.
Over the last 2 days I read about some guy sleeping around and someone else's
money problems.  I think that "I'm not a rip-off" or "My boyfriend is sleeping
around" have no place here.  Nor should anyone use this list to try and ruin
someone's reputation.  That's the way I saw BOTH those posts, in a very bad
light.  No names, please.  Please do not use this list to vent or for evil, and
we all will be OK!

Just my two cents, added to yours make four.

Yes, Leslie did come across very well, and the show was somewhat one-sided
with a focus on drug problems in the scene.
I do think there is some validity to this.  There are alot of people who
may be doing drugs who imo probably shouldn't be doing them.
I've personally have dealt with some who have done drugs which probably 
because of some pre-existing condition, have triggered them to become 
psychotic, which continued well after the time span of the drugs lasting effects.

Of course I don't think this is souly a rave-related issue, but I do think 
we should continue to emphasize educated usage and non-usage in our scene, 
which is something that I have found to be a good part of the history
of this list.

Hopefully there will be another show someday that will focus on some of the
more positive impacts of raving on people's lives.

Why does it seem that the rave scene in general all over the world, is dominated
by the younger generation?
Do you younger ravers think you will stop raving when you get older?

I couldn't help laughing when someone in the audience mentioned that the
raves have people as old as 30  :o
I'm 36 and know quite a few older ravers.  When I get older and have to 
spend alot of time in a rocking chair, I hope to be still rocking to beat.

I think most "popular new movements" are driven by an audience of 16-24
year olds. There are certainly people on the younger and older sides of
this range, but that segment, IMHO, represents the biggest portion of
the "bell curve." This is what I gather from pictures, movies, stories,
etc that I've seen from the swing movement (e.g. benny goodman, count
basie, duke ellington), be-bop (charlie parker, john coltrane, miles
davis), rock-n-roll (buddy holly, elvis), rock/acid-rock (beatles,
rolling stones, led zepplin), Soul/R&B, Funk, Disco, Punk, Industrial,
Rave, etc.

Take a look at the movies we've all seen of fans at Elvis, Beatles, and
Stones concerts, or Woodstock -- the majority of audience faces you see
are "teenagers" and "early 20's". While the performers were typically
in their mid/late 20's and 30's.

Likewise, a majority of press coverage during those times focused on
how the new music/drugs/fashion/sexual-mores inspired degeneracy in the
youth of america... It happened in the 20's with flappers, jazz music,
and alchohol (resulting ultimately in prohibition and the rise of the
mafia to distribute alchohol). And it's happened in the 60's, and 70's
and 80's and 90's with the associated musics and inebriants of
rebellion, and the opposing laws, prohibitions, and criminal
profiteers.

So while y'all think you are breaking down societal barriers with yer
newfangled trendy shit, just remember.... Same as it ever was, same as
it ever was... The more things change, the more they remain the same.

One day, some of you youngins will become parents, and you'll be 
wondering why the fuck junior is going off to monotonously repeating
pulsing squarewaves on his stereo, head plugged into a
stereotaxicvirtualreality simulator, and electrodes plugged into the
temple causing his brains to smoke and limbs to twitch spasmodically to
a rhythm you can't comprehend, and you'll say -- damn kids today! and
junior will say oh maaaaw, you just don't understand!

PS: one thing I've been thinking about w/r/t the Leeza show. Perhaps
this is the first real evidence that "Rave" is going to become an
official mainstream way for kids to rebel against their parents. It's
almost as if TV is now instructing kids all over amerikkka -- hey
really want to piss your parents off -- go to a rave! parents will do
their part by saying "Johnny, you're not going to those raves are you"
to which lil Johnny suddenly takes great interest in because it has
become "Taboo".

Why would TV set out to create an official mode of rebellion for youth?
Because there's a lot of money to be made selling records (Rap/Hip-Hop
becoming a rather played-out and politically dangerous/divisive form of
youth rebellion). To say nothing of the "all new" fashions that parents
will have to  clothe their kids in so they can stay hip and popular. To
say nothing about all the new drugs the CIA can start selling to the
youth of America without even risking importation. ANd best of all,
there's no lyrics in the songs telling kids how fucked up the
government is, or to go out and kill cops! Just a bunch of blissed-out
sheep bleating "PLUR" while the government clamps down on yer rights
slowly, steadily. Turn up the heat slowly and the frogs in the pot
don't jump out, they cook! Cook lil froggies cook!

Since you are 36, I'm surprised you don't know the answer !  :-) 

80-90% of the problem is the time of day, ie the midnight to 8 am bit.

People over 22 have day jobs.

People over, say 25, start to feel it more when they stay up all night
(eg get sick).

And people over, primarily 20 (although as young as 13) have kids.
Having kids makes it difficult to stay up even past midnight even on a
Saturday.

I know there is more than one reason for the midnight to 8 am aspect
of raves, but my perception is that the major reason is to keep out
most people.

I've read plenty of rave reviews here which said something like "at 3
am, all the jerks left and then the rest of us got down to dancing".

So, you can't have your cake and eat it too.

Either raves are an underground phenomenon designed to leave out most
people in order to limit it to people dedicated to the vibe and PLUR,

OR

You want to share raves with the rest of the world, including the
over-30 crowd, in which case it needs to take place at regular clubs
between 8pm and 2am.


Cheers,

Ken                         <*>

You say this with such authority. Please site your source of such
definitive statistics.

I seem to remember being 17 and having a day job.

Ok, I am writing this down... "People over the age of 20 have kids...."
Got it.

The problem is not the "over-30" crowd. The problem is not the "under-30"
crowd. The problem is people that just don't get it, don't want to get it,
and don't think you should try to get it either.

The menenites and amish are fairly drug free. I know of no real psychoactive
or physiological drugs they ingest, unless meat, vegetables, fruits, starches
and sugars fit your definition of drugs? They do drink rootbeer which
contains safrole type compounds similar to a precursor of MDMA???

Helllo all !!!

Damn it's been 2 - 3 weeks since =CE moved and I miss SF sooo much.  I live
in SLO that is San Luis Obispo and it really is slow and conservative.  I
love the attention I get when I wear all my funky rave shit on campus,
kinda amusing...
'
Anyways I'll be up this friday to go to Charity.  My sister is getting me
tix and soo I really want to get down this weekend!!!.

I haven' been to a party since Open.

I'll have my sfraves badge (I just subed again 2 days ago) and some glow
sticks and some other cool shit.  I hope to have a great time and feel at
home once again with my 2nd family.  Look for me and say hi!

Hope things are going well for all of you and I send hugs to everyone.

See ya friday!

Austin

PS If anyone is planning a trip to LA at anytime,for some hardcore
parting..let me know and I would like to join.  I'm only 3 hours from La
and ready to go down.

Also BP  There is a party in SB mext weekend on the 11th if anyone's
interested.  I'll post about it when I get back.

Peace

Here comes the my drug is better than your drug discussion again. The mdma
vs. alchohol discussion. The legalize them and eliminate the dangerous
illegal drug trade argument.

Sure altered states have existed throughout history, but we are dealing
with a society that sees illegal drug use as a threat. It is very hard to
have a calm, logical discussion with parents/law enforcement/middle
america/right wingers/etc.. about how your use of illegal drugs is no
better or worse than their use of alchohol, cigarettes, perscription
drugs....

I just saw this much discussed topic coming up again.

To end my .02, try bringing this up on your daytime tabloid talk show, and
you will SURELY see some creative editing, and a very scary end result.
Maybe one on one you could work this angle and convince a few people, but
to take this to a larger audience would probably be suicidal.

OK, so that was .03

Just wanted to introduce myself, as i am fairly new the sfrave scene and
wish to make e-friends, so i thought i'd drop you all an e-mail.  i've been
makin' reks in the back of solid grooves since "the energy e.p." and
continue to explore the possibilities of MIDI within the realms of
progressive house, techno, trance, breakbeat and just plain house.  it's
been a while since e.b.e., but don't worry, another one will come along one
of these days.  i keep going through these stages of self-discovery (it's
different every time).  i just released a record called "solid trax vol. 1"
this last summer, which got quite a good reception in the s.f. bay area
(thank you).

i appreciate all the love and support that i have received thru these past
three years... this is a beautiful scene we have here, let's not let it
ever slip away.

i'll keep everyone posted on the new developments of solid grooves as they
come along.

until next time...

keep the peace

just a little perspective from my side on this:

i have probably known an equal number of people who have used drugs
regularily and people who used alcohol regularily. i personally have never
seen anyone physically or mentally harmed from drug use (unless you count
the rumour about the guy at my high school who was reputedly fed a vial of
liquid acid - and was now on some heavy medication.) however, my father's
dad and three uncles all died from heart disease (they were all heavy
smokers and drinkers), one of my uncles will die very soon from liver
failure due to alcohol abuse, one of my cousins has been in 3 accidents
while drinking and driving, i know more people than i can count on my
fingers that have been hit by drunk drivers, and i have had two friends
rushed to the emergency room to have their hearts shocked back to life from
alcohol poisoning.

certainly no conclusive, die hard evidence; but i know which of the two -
legal drugs or illegal drugs - that i consider safer.

NoNoNoNoNO!  I seem to need to dance *more* as I get older

The best raves start in the afternoon and go all night, and into the next
day and.....
so you bring a tent or use the chill room to snooze whenever you're too
tired to move anymore.

Dancing until the sun comes up does have a certain magic to it,
and I think that's why we do it.  Probably none of us get to do it as
often of it as we'd like to.  We all have various obligations....

Surely you must have noticed an increasing number of daytime raves lately.
These are just the thing for those of us who need to dance, but also need
to sleep.   They are often held on the beach or in a park and usually don't
get busted, because it's legal to be there during the day.

Daytime raves in public places may be the best way to show the essence of
our scene
to people who have not found it yet.  Anyone who wants to can come dance
with us.
(They are also a great defense against yellow TV journalism.  How sinister
can raves be
if you can hold them in the middle of the day in a park?)

>I've read plenty of rave reviews here which said something like "at 3
>am, all the jerks left and then the rest of us got down to dancing".

Those all refer to events that happen at clubs.  The jerk coefficient does
tend to go down
shortly after the bars therein stop serving alcohol.   I vastly prefer raves
that are not held
in clubs.

>So, you can't have your cake and eat it too.

Yes we can.  (Munch munch)    Every weekend in and around San Francisco there
are a LOT of parties.   Some are in clubs, and some of those go all night,
some don't,
some are in warehouses,  summer camps, beaches.   Some are so heavily promoted
that you can't avoid finding out about them, some are so underground that
none of us
know about them, and there is everything in-between.

Most "regular clubs" are not doing much of anything at 8 pm, that's too
early for them.
I've been to quite a few raves that started that early or earlier, but
almost never a club.
And why must it stop at 2am?  You can leave whenever you want, but I usually
want
to stay later than 2, and besides, who wants to drive during the National
Drunken
Driving Hour?  Much better to wait until 3 or 4.

There are quite a few events in clubs.  Some of them resemble raves more
than others.
Entirely too many of them DO shut down at 2am.  

The essence of "rave" and the essence of "bar" are to some degree in
opposition to one
another.   Often "bar" overwhelms "rave".

The best place to share raves with the rest of the world is on the beach in
the afternoon.

My partner and I will be playing live music at a rave on the 12'th.
Yesterday we went to check out the space, and while talking to the owner, we
found out that the part of the space we are playing in has a power shortage.
After looking in the switch box we found that the breaker we will be running
off of can only handle about 15 amps.  He said to add up all of the ampage
on our gear to see if it would work.  So last night I did it, but couln't
find any indication for ampage of any of our stuff....but I did get the
wattage.  So here's my question O Keeper Of the Sacred Ampage Knowledge.
How many amps is 771 watts?  What is the ratio of amps to watts?  Your
insight will be most helpful for I am currently electrically illiterate.
Thank you.

 In this case , Power (watts) =  [(Volts rms)] times [Current (amps)]

 estimating mains volts ac rms at 110Vrms, the current would be:

 771 watts divided by 110 vrms = 7 amps 

 You can test the setup by getting a power strip with a 15 amp
 circuit breaker on it, and plug everything you're planning to bring
 to the rave into that one strip. If you trip that power strip's 
 15 amp breaker, you'll trip the breaker at the site. Also, don't
 forget that lights drain a lot of power too!

 Note: Be sure the wattage you were adding up was the total power
    comsumed by the amplifier, not the watts-per-channel going to 
    the speakers. The total power is always more watts because
    of non-ideal power conversion - if your amp is warm, it's 
    eating watts.

Yes, Leslie did come across very well, and the show was somewhat
one-sided with a focus on drug problems in the scene.  I do think there is
some validity to this. 
>>>>>

Drug use and raves is such an interesting topic because concern IS
valid.  There are usually a lot of very easily accessable drugs at
parties...it's not a problem for just our community though.  Hmm, reminds
me of a story:

One of the most offensive experiences I ever had was meeting a guy (a
guy who raves and djs no less!) one morning after a party and while
chatting to him I mentioned that I worked at a Birkenstock Store.  (Bear
with me, this IS relevent...)  He looks at me and says "Oh, so are you one
of those deadhead hippies who, when Jerry died, needed some place to
do your fucked up drugs...so you started raving?"  ! ! ! !  How totally
offended could I possibly be!  I didn't know what to say because no, I
wasn't a deadhead before I partied (I was a phishead, thank you very
much) BUT EVEN IF I WAS!!  Is this how people see both the deadhead
AND raving communities?  That concerts and raves are simply "a place
to do your fucked up drugs"??  It's such an insult to both groups of
people.

Drugs ARE a part of our scene (and the deadhead scene, for that
matter)...and maybe I sound a little naive to say "but can't anyone see
BEYOND that?"  But drugs aren't what it's all about!  Any time I meet
someone who's like "yeah, I've never been to a rave sober" I'm always
SHOCKED...how can you consider yourself true gruver if you've never
been clearheaded at a party?  (IMHO, of course)  What is it about these
two wonderfully different scenes (folks who rave & fans o' The Dead)
that fosters some of the most loving vibes ever...yet a public recognition
as drugged out losers?

Hmm, I could think about this for a long time...

What can I say,  Wish was purrfect.   The club presence was at an almost
nil factor with a few of the SFR Family I got to meet (Justin? Steve S.?
Jenn? - Oh, how I hate names)... Dancing all thorough Mystr-E's and
MARS's sets, I took a trance nap when the two were going one-on-one...

Speaking of which, has anyone had a strange feeling of "going away"
while resting to trance music??? It seemed that once the music stopped,
I "snapped" back to this reality... Just Curious.

This is a good idea for exploration by a group of people in our scene with a 
definite purpose in mind.  

One thing we do have to deal with no matter which scene we go:

Here's a little factoid I picked up:

In our society
3% are leaders
10% support the leadership
60% follow the masses 
and 27% are the problem causers.

the "27%ers" are the people who's whole purpose in life is to be negative and 
drage everyone else down into their negative world.  

How this relates to educated usage, there are a certain percentage of people 
that are going to abuse drugs anyway no matter what the rest of the people do.  
I don't think this means we shouldn't educate, we definitely need to.  

But think about this for a minute.

Every profession, every walk of life is permeated with these types of people.  

Cops
Lawyers
Doctors
Computer Programmers
Ravers
yes, even dj's.  
Parents

Now there is no really correct way of categorizing, but it is just something to 
think about.  There are certain numbers of people that really just need to help 
themselves.  Provide the education for everyone, fully realizing that a lot of 
people will ignore it or not be able to comprehend it.

Of course I don't think this is souly a rave-related issue, but I do think 
we should continue to emphasize educated usage and non-usage in our scene, 
which is something that I have found to be a good part of the history
of this list.

Assuming the line voltage is 120 Volts RMS, and knowing that
Power == Volts * Current

the current (amps) == power (watts) / volts == 771 / 120 == 6.425 amps

However, if the way you are coming up with wattage for your power
amplifiers is by using the rated maximum continuous output wattage,
then the above figure will need to be fudged by approx 50%. Most power
amplifiers waste a lot of energy -- a 500W "true class A" amplifier
(audiophile) could actually use over 1000W, wasting 500W even while
"idling" for example. Most PA amplifiers are class B or class AB which
will typically waste 25-50% of the output power. Beyond that, if the
amplifier is  being strongly driven, it could actually draw 2-3 times
it's continuous rated power (+ wastage) for very brief moments of time.
(This could be enough to trigger a circuit breaker even if the average
power is below 15 Amps.)

And this is a powerful weapon in the fight to *not* legalize illicit
drugs. If people are killing themselves left and right with currently
legal drugs, what do you think the result would be if you told that
drunken jock(stereotype I admit) that he can now take a sheet of acid,
snort a few lines of speed, and shoot heroin legally?

Micron,

I feel exactly the same way, man.  Your opinion is valid and well

you know, the leeza show (and shows of that genre) wouldn't have anything
to do with the subject of raves, if there wasn't that "darkside" to them.
in the talk show circuit, drugs have always been controversial, and
therefore ratings magnets. of course, none of these shows would ever talk
only about the grooves and good vibes that happen naturally at these
gatherings, because hey, that's boring and not tragic enough.

drugs are always going to have a place in our society. there will always be
different viewpoints, just like there will be different types of users.

but what the hell do i know anyway? just thought i would up the ante to $.06

happy fuzzies,

What always get me wondering is the MARKETING of legal drugs.  Its my
opinion that we should be free to use and purchase and substance we
choose to...  Its my body... I'm responsible, and I contribute to this
society, yadha yadha yadha....

But I can't beleive we still allow the legal drug manufactures to market
their substances.  Free choice to use drugs, yes...  Subliminal brainwashing
to promote the use of these substances, no... HELL NO!

I mean, what if drugs were legalized, do you think it would be right
to have big billboards all the way up the 101 with yuppie types dressed
up having fun at a party promoting how great Cocaine is?  How about
Grunge Rockers dressed like Calvin Klein models lounging in semi-erotic
positions in semi-lucid states promoting Heroin?  Yeah, it sounds unbeleivable,
but Marlboro Country and Joe Camel and Mr Jenkins are really no different.

so true.  did you know that the average person watches 8.5 hours of television a
day?  This is typical american folk.  they watch the news and these talk shows 
where they find the most negative things going on in the world and mainline it 
into the brains of the average american.  and what's happening to our society as
a result?  its FALLING APART.

DUI, regardless of the chemical in the body, is illegal.  More 
information is available in the CA DMV motor-vehicle handbook.

the calendar feels full again with lots of stuff this weekend.  i hadn't
been out for a while, but i stopped by come-unity last night and it
was good to see some familiar faces and to see the party bumpin'.  I
have to get out more :).

This weekend, the Pacific and Charity parties on Friday look pretty swell,
and then there's no excuse for missing the Organic in the park on Saturday,
it's free and all ages :).  Then there's several parties that night for
different tastes, and some new stuff has been popping up in the weeklies -
i might try out Massa at the Caribbean Zone, then there's new drum n'bass
(Sexy TKO & Blueprint), Step Off, Return, Syncopic...

i think the sad thing here is that as a result of all this neg-frenzied
brain feeding is that people are now even more dependent on chemicals and
such for enlightenment/happiness/comfort/ and in some sad cases
acceptance/hope. it is a sad fact but america needs bad vibes or it
wouldn't know what to do with itself. look at the history of this country.
what stands out?

for that matter, this is why the rave scene gets such the bad rap. others
(outside the scene) just cannot understand how happiness can just happen,
so they blame it on that "drug thing". if anything the good grooves aren't
attributed to just drugs, but hey, how bout the people, music, environment.
the drugs should be looked at as the perfect martini at the coolest party.
it emphasizes, it doesn't make the scene.

it is sad though, to see those few people who rely on the scene for their
good vibes.

anyways, that's just how i see it...........

I think this is true because youth experience a situation similar to the
bourgeois.  They do not have to accumulate monetary capital in order to
survive; it is provided by their parents.  Therefore, they have certain
luxuries that the bourgeois have.  There are less responsibities, to a
certain extent.  It is easier to be idealistic because one doesn't have to
realize their ideals, and a full understanding of why others can't isn't
clear.  This provides the time and capital to be a part of youth culture.
Even youth who work experience something similar.  There are less
responsibilities to pay for.  This becomes painfully obvious to most
people when they leave college/high school and have to start paying for
their own lives.  

Another thing with regards to the Leeza show, to some extent it does
represent a valid part of raving.  Although, it may not be one you or I
experience, obviously it effects some teens like the ones on the show.
Don't get me wrong, I don't support sensationalistic media, and this show
is ALL that and more.  But, there lies a grain of truth in it, like Peter
(I think) said.  I was a teen once, and I remember what it was like to
find a place for yourself.  Peer pressure means everything, and American
teens (and Americans) are hung up with being "cool."  You are in this
precarious position of not being quite a kid, but not being quite an
adult.  It is actually a shitty time (at least for me), and you try and
grasp for anything that will make you something.  Mix that attitude and
drugs, and I think you get uneducated use.  

One thing the show didn't allow was for anyone to explain their position.
The teens just weren't well spoken or insightful enough to get their point
across.  And, they had good points: unity, community, joy, fun,
friendship.  That probably lies in their own hands, and I would emphasize
for children that want their parents to understand them, to be educated
about what they do.  Also, the parents need to be open-minded and
understand the positions of the children.

  The above statement is rather bothersome to me.  Is it negative to *not*
follow the masses?  I don't think so.  I don't think that 27% (not
sure I buy the number, either, but that's another story) of people have as
their sole mission in life the spreading of negativity.
  Here's my big problem, though.  I don't fit into the leaders.  I
certainly don't fit into the 10% who follow the leaders.  I'd like to
think I don't follow the masses.  So, according to this "statistic" I am
an agent of negativity.
  I prefer to think of these elements as subversives, agents of change &
evolution, chaotes, etc.  Not at all negative things, in my mind.
Evolution is a Good Thing.
  Sorry for the NRRness :)

Overwhelms is right!
Its been quite a while since I've been to come/unity, and it will 
probably be a while before I go back.
Most people looked like they were having a great time.
The music was GREAT!
Because it was so good, I felt frustrated most of the time, as I 
couldn't find much space to dance.  When I would find a space, it 
didn't take long for a drunk to bounce off me or someone to step on
my feet as they tryed getting through to crowd.

Too bad it was like a sardine can, because with the great music and soundsystem
along with nice visuals I would have had a great time.
Didn't seem to thin out much either as the night went on.
Happy to see others enjoying themselves.

:)

First of all, if they want to they can already do it (and they do). Legal
or not, it's all available and being used anyway. And my impression as a
European is that the fact that alcohol in the US is still treated as semi-
legal (you have to be 21, your ID is checked, you can smoke, drive a car,
vote, go to vietnam but not have a beer) makes it that alcohol is used
much more excessively here than back home. Most raves in Europe have alcohol,
you never have to show ID to get into any bar, club or rave (unless you look
really young, i.e. 14-years old) etc. What I'm trying to say is that even
in the case of alcohol I have the suspicion that its semi-legal status
is the cause of more of the problems. If you educate people and treat them
as having a brain they can act rationally. In Holland for instance the
use of heroin is still steadily dropping and the junks aging. Heroin in
not a cool drug anymore, people know the difference between a (legal)
phat joint and a needle in your arm. In the US it's much more difficult
for people to discriminate between drugs, since they're told by the
government/media/police they're all equally bad and have similar
sentences associated with them (and thus all equally interesting to a
16-year old). If you legalize stuff, you'll have to explain to people
what they can expect and then let them decide whether they still want
to eat a sheet of acid.

Hehe, on returning to Holland I will start to work for a drug company
there... But it's a business as all others. What scares me the most is
the kind of drugs they are trying to sell, especially in the US. It's
the kind of "drop a pill, be happy"-attitude. And basically they're giving
the people what they want, prozac to feel good, ritalin to keep the
kids quiet, tylenol to keep you going even if your body says no and
peptobismol to keep you eating even if you're full. It's not even
subliminal brainwashing, that has apparently already happened to the
masses, it's pretty much in your face I'd say.

Exactly. But that doesn't make it good. Back home cannabis is perfectly
legal to buy and use. It is however not allowed to advertise for it and
this works fine. I could imagine a similar scheme for other drugs.
Heroin and cocaine are a different thing, given their addictive nature
they should probably  be supplied only to those who are addicted by
people with a medical background. In Holland, lots of drugs which are
illegal here, can be bought in headshop-like stores, apparently big business
is not too interested. This probably has to do with that only a relatively
small part of the population actually likes to get stoned, even while
it's legal and available, while many more people just enjoy to smoke or
drink... You see, experimenting with psychoactive substances is not for
everybody, some find it scary, some boring, some don't react very well
to them etc.

I gotta say, checking out Come-Unity and just dancing last night reminded
me of why I'm in this.

I personally wouldn't worry too much about a person(s) opinion if they

Neils,

  You *almost* had it there...although I think you miss an important link
between government and popular movements.  Eventually, if a movement is
big enough to cause a shift in popular consciousness, its effects impact
government.  Say what you want about the American flavor of democracy,
but the fact remains that we vote for our leaders.  After you strip away 
all the arguments about media manipulation and PAC money and whatever 
other issues are relevant, you're still left with the undisputable
notion that one vote equals one vote. 
   
   So I disagree with your claim that ravers are little sheep who will
be squished by the Almighty Powers That Be.  Let's look at history,
as you wisely did in your post.  Take the 60's for instance, an era
when Bill Clinton was doing his Rhodes scholarship at Oxford, sporting
a shaggy hairdo and mustache, 'experimenting' with inhaling, and 
protesting the Vietnam War.  Al Gore, meanwhile, was at Harvard (another
socially and politically active campus), in a time when he attended 
Grateful Dead concerts (yes, it's true, our VP is a deadhead), and he
too embraced the 60's idealism, also "experimented" with inhaling, as
he euphemistically put it, and believed that politics was a viable arena 
to enact social change.

  And so now, Clinton and Gore have tidied up their image a bit, (they
are smart enough to realize they have to--remember, they have to represent
the entire country, and change comes slowly) and sure, they play by the
Washington rules, but they are still bring as much change as they can
given the present environment.
[I realize this is starting to sound like a 're-elect Bill and Al'  post;
 that isn't my point, though--I'm trying to show that social movements'
 ripples can have long-term effects on government.]

  Now, if everyone in our generation raved, and then when we grew up and
were given the keys to Washington, do you still think we'd 'clamp down
on the little froggies'?  I certainly don't think so.


best,
Timothy

I think this will end up getting a very skewed results.  Many people not from
California (or even in California) do not know what 215 is about and this
really doesn't tell them.  It just asks if you think Marijuana should be in
the same category as Heroin and LSD.

good observations.  i don't have all the answers, so i might add that your 
opinions are just as important as mine, if not more in your case.  I didn't post
these stats to try to prove my intellegence; I don't need to be that smart or 
important.  I just found that they were fascinating and wanted to share them 
with the collective brain here.  Whenever we classify people into categories, 
there will obviously be some overlap.  For instance, there were times when I by 
running a self-diagnostic, that at some instances, at different times, fit into 
all of the categories provided, and sometimes, none.

  The above statement is rather bothersome to me.  Is it negative to *not*
follow the masses?  I don't think so.  I don't think that 27% (not
sure I buy the number, either, but that's another story) of people have as 
their sole mission in life the spreading of negativity.
  Here's my big problem, though.  I don't fit into the leaders.  I
certainly don't fit into the 10% who follow the leaders.  I'd like to 
think I don't follow the masses.  So, according to this "statistic" I am 
an agent of negativity.
  I prefer to think of these elements as subversives, agents of change &
evolution, chaotes, etc.  Not at all negative things, in my mind. 
Evolution is a Good Thing.

So how're y'all doing?  I just got back from MAUI!!!!  Wow, that was SO MUCH 
FUN!  I'd never been to Hawaii before, and it was a blast!  I'm already 
planning my next tropical getaway.  Rented a jeep and took the top down, 
wore little more than a bathing suit for 4 days.  Snorkelling, jet-skiing, 
hiking through the jungle, exploring *amazing* tidepools, laying on the 
beach at night and staring at the stars.  Yow.  To prevent burning I skipped 
over the various sun blocks and went for straight up zinc oxide.  In neon 
colors.  All over my body.  I often mixed and matched colors for the most 
striking effects...

RAVE RELATED:  How about this:  We missed our connecting flight going back 
and had to stay in Honolulu for a night.  While we were there, we went to 
Waikiki and visited a club (the folks I was with are more the sports bar 
types) called {something} McDoogles.  That was all well and good, but the 
club across the street, The Jungle, had serious techno playing!  I peeked in 
and saw intellibeams and lasers and a semi-freaky crowd.  I was dying to 
check it out, but I was cooperative and went to the other club.  Which had 
an excellent band and still succeeded in sucking.  Oh well.

Almost got a tattoo of a Tikki god (would have been my first) at Skin Deep, 
down the street from The Jungle, but I backed out since the art there wasn't 
that great.

One of the hamstas announced he was staying.  Yes, Spaz is realizing his 
native Hawaiian heritage (who knew?) and has set up a surf shop on Maui 
renting tiny little surf boards and boogie boards to rodents.  Mostly he 
sits in front of his shop on the beach under a little umbrella, wearing 
shades, sipping Coconut Mai Tais and wiggling his pink toes in the sand, 
listening to tapes by Doc Martin and Moonpup.  He said to say, "Aloha", and 
promises he'll send the occasional post card.

|    So I disagree with your claim that ravers are little sheep who will
| be squished by the Almighty Powers That Be.  Let's look at history,
| as you wisely did in your post. 
|[...] 
|   And so now, Clinton and Gore have tidied up their image a bit, (they
| are smart enough to realize they have to--remember, they have to represent
| the entire country, and change comes slowly) and sure, they play by the
| Washington rules, but they are still bring as much change as they can
| given the present environment.

I think the situation is best summed up by a bumper sticker I saw the other
day -- "Republicans for Clinton and Gore" -- IMHO, in Clinton's
triangulation towards the center/right, he and Gore have actually become
republicans. The republican party, meanwhile, has become out-and-out
reactionary, even though Dole is supposed to represent the tempered and
wise "middle of the road republicans" (as opposed to Pat Buchanan and Jerry
Falwell extremists). In pandering to the center, Clinton has left a big gap
in representing the very progressives that put him into power. Who is
supposed to represent the progressives now that Clinton is representing the
middle of the roaders and all but a small mintority of republicans. I
resent that and refuse to vote for him or support him for that reason. If
he were a man of principle and values, he would stick to his values, to the
values of those that elected him. This is the presidency of the united
states, not a ff-ing high-school class president popularity contest.

There's way too many examples of the republican sell out on CLinton's part.
There is no trace of the "60's ethos" left under his command:
	-- The recent passage of cryptography laws that appear to
	   solve the export problem, but also ensure that the government
	   gets a "back door" -- no more freedom of speech, no more
	   right to assemble in cyberspace.
	-- Not vetoing the defense of marriage act.
	-- Not vetoing the welfare bill.
	-- Recent war in Iraq.
	-- Caving in to pressure from Republicans to continue fighting
	   the war on drugs "the old fashioned way."
	-- Caving in to Republican resistance to solve the health-care
	   crisis.

The only thing Clinton has done for the progressives came very early
in his presidency:
	-- The Family Medical Leave Act.

|   Now, if everyone in our generation raved, and then when we grew up and
| were given the keys to Washington, do you still think we'd 'clamp down
| on the little froggies'?  I certainly don't think so.

I wish I could be as "positive" about people as you are, but I've dealt
with too many real people to know that this is not the case. Most people
sell out their values for the comfort of the "american dream" and whatever
youthful and idealistic values they might have held near and dear go
straight to hell once "adult concerns" (raising kids, keeping a
relationship and career balanced, ensuring there's a roof over your
family's heads, etc.).  Way too many of the hippies that wanted to change
the world are now just a bunch of Saab-driving cyberwanks who'd sell out
their friends, trash the economy, etc, all just to "get ahead." Just 'cause
Bill Clinton inhaled (though he denied it), and just 'cause Al Gore was a
Dead Head (hey, I've known some Deadheads that were utter assholes) doesn't
mean jack. Michael Milken and Donald Trump partied as well, probably wore
their hair long in college (otherwise they'd'a been square and wouln't have
gotten laid) and it didn't make them better people, or less
greedy/destructuve. What are most people going to do but follow the
mainstream culture/fashion of their time??

I think things are worse off for the Rave scene than they were for the
60's/70's. Ravers don't have a "message" that they are trying to get out.
The message is inward-directed, self-change-directed, as if people have
given up on being able to change the world and just want to hallucinate it
all better. They want to "do our thing" in private, out of sight from the
judging eyes of society... underground is good, mainstream is bad, and all
that. Don't rock the boat is the corollary of "respect" , "it's all good"
is the corollary of "peace love unity"...  Ravers songs don't have protest
lyrics, political/social/religious discussions on SFraves are hushed as
"non rave related"... we have misinterpreted Leary's "tune in, turn on,
drop out" message so that we revel in infantile helpnessness, trying
nonsensically to go back to simpler times when other people nurtured us and
we had no worries. That's all good and fine, everybody needs a vacation now
and then, but it's not going to solve any problems, and nobody's going to
"dose the world..." and make it all better.

Actually, the more I think about it, the more I see the rave movement
following the same ineffectual "solve all our problems through drugs" ethos
that made the whole hippy movement useless. IMHO, the real messages of the
time were coming out of Soul, R&B, and Funk. Where is the rave equivalent
of Marvin Gaye's "what's going on" (1971) which is probably one of the most
important, poignant, chilling anti-war albums of all time. Hell, you've got
Sly And the Family Stone's "Babies Makin' Babies", "Everybody is a Star",
"You can make it if you try", or "Everyday People"... versus "Puff the
Magic Dragon." The real message of the 60's and 70's didn't even come out
of the Hippy movement cause all those white college kids weren't being sent
off to war, it was the underclass black/latino/white-trash that were
getting shipped over to 'nam. Meanwhile all the hippies were sittin around
having casual sex, casual drugs and listening to "EIght Miles High" while
spewing a bunch of philosophical drivel straight outta their college
textbooks.

Basically, I think we got the wrong Clinton in the White house -- shoulda
been George Clinton cuz he understood the issues, the vibe, and how to have
real fun.  Meanwhile the hippies were just navel-staring and preparing to
become yuppies and libertarian-i-got-mine-now-you-get-yours selfish
bastards in the 80's...

(Please realize I'm playing devils advocate here, as I fully appreciate the
nonverbal, nonrationalistic, animal togetherness that raving does bring
through the beat and dancing alone. But other than feeling good, I don't
think it is going to solve any problems -- after the parties over, you
still have to deal with life. It's just a party.)

i step foot in there again.

Oh you haven't seen the latest Calvin Klein commercials. Someone coined
the term "heroin-shiek"

Yeah, it sounds unbeleivable,

Stifiling advertising sends out mixed messages. On the one hand, we are
saying that fill_in_the_blank is a legal substance. But we also say "you
can't promote your legal product."

I beg to differ.  Perhaps you haven't visited your local 
meat-market/pickup bar/club lately.

Raving is not just a party, its a tribal celebration.  The closest thing 
I've seen to this kind of true love of life was a renneasance (sp) faire, 
and that's mostly staged.  At a rave, it feels real to me!

And when the (norcal) rave scene decides to direct its strength towards a 
cause, things happen: earth conservation, helping Omar, supporting 
legislation, supporting non-profit groups, etc.

with a hug of encouragement,

deeje

	Personally I think restricting advertising of drugs is OK... sort of 
like not allowing yelling "fire" in a theatre (assuming there isn't one).  I 
don't miss the tobacco ads, and I kind of regret that tobacco financed the start 
of tv and radio because it must have fucked up a lot of people.  I think there 
are also restrictions on hard liquor ads on TV...  Hell, if a drug is good, it 
promotes itself...  What was that 60's song -- "god damn the pusher man"...

	However I definitely agree that illegalization provides incentive to 
indiscriminate experimentation/use.  The less big brother gets involved, the 
more responsible people are.  This is pretty evident if you look at the origins 
of our current prohibitions: they were enacted, basically, to keep the mob in 
business when alcohol was re-legalized.  Its also obvious when you walk the 
streets of Amsterdam.  The red-light district there is one of the safest in 
town (or any town), because the cops can do the job they ought to be doing: 
protecting people from real criminals (ie robbers and rapists).  And less people 
smoke the evil weed because they can smoke pot instead (and that *is* 
rave-related).

_Police seize potentially fatal drug - versions of Ecstasy found in
Ottawa_

Ottawa Citizen, Sept 28, 1996. C1

by Mike Blanchfield

A potentially fatal version of the designer drug Ecstasy has surfaced in
Ottawa, prompting Health Canada to issue a countrywide warning.

"It's the first seizure of this type of pill in Canada," said Insp. Dale
Begbie, of the RCMP drug section in Ottawa.  "The potency is so high it
can be fatal.  One pill could kill a person."

Only 121 pills, worth $25 each on the street, were seized recently with
the arrest of a 26-year-old Ottawa man.  But officials are concerned
more of the extra-strength pills - two to three times more potent than
the usual hit of Ecstasy - might be in circulation across Canada and
could be unwittingly purchased by people seeking the euphoric effects of
this synthetic narcotic.

"It suggests the drug may be in use in other parts of the country and it
just hasn't been detected yet," said Dr. George Mattock, director of the
Bureau of Drug Research with Health Canada.  "These are super potent.
It's like taking an overdose."

Ecstasy - sometimes caleed "E" or "X" - became a fringe culture
phenomenon in the early '90s with its use at raves.  The warm euphoric
glow, lasting four to six hours from one pill, went hand in hand with
massive spontaneous dance parties in empty warehouses, known as raves,
which have their roots in the British underground dance music scene.

Even with regular doses, Ecstasy has been linked to sudden hear and
kidney failure, said Mattock.

In a public appeal that sounds more like the 1969 public address
announcement at Woodstock warning against "bad acid," Health Canada is
telling potential Ecstasy buyers to beware by issuing a countrywide
warning saying this new version "could prove lethal."

"In England, there have been several fatal incidents associated with
Ecstasy use at 'rave' parties," the warning states.  The round pill
features a bird on one side and a slash on the other.

"The challenge is to prevent people going to these rave parties from
using the pills," said Mattock, whose branch of Health Canada has been
analysing Ecstasy for the past six months.

Two common forms of Ecstasy have hit the streets in the past: MDMA
(which goes by the street name Adam) and MDEA (known as Eve).  A typical
hit of Ecstasy contains 75 to 100 milligrams of the drug.

But these new pills seized in Ottawa contain 300 milligrams or higher,
combining versions of Adam and Eve, said Mattock, who analysed the drugs
for the RCMP.

This new stronger version of Ecstasy was likely manufactured in a lab in
Amsterdam and smuggled into Canada by air travellers, says Begbie.

The Mounties seized the drug as part of a cocaine bust on Tuesday.
Begbie won't divulge how the Mounties may have traced the drug's origin
to Amsterdam.

OPP Staff Sgt. Doug Wilkinson, head of Ottawa-Carleton's joint police
force drug unit, said he doesn't believe the drug is that popular
locally.  "We've made some seizures and we don't see more of it on the
street."  He said crack and powder cocaine, as well as hash, are the
local drugs of choice.

The RCMP has charge Craig Paruche, 26, of Ramsgate Crescent in Ottawa,
with trafficking in a restricted druga and trafficking in cocaine.


[The Ottawa Citizen can be reached at http://www.ottawacitizen.com if
anyone cares to send comments to the editor.  There are several factual
errors in this piece that should be corrected and it's definitely
alarmist.  BTW, these E are being called Blue Doves in Ottawa (I think).
So far no fatalities. ;) If anyone has any info on these, please post
it.  If they are, in fact, dangerous, we want to get warnings out to the
ravers.  Thanks.]

But this is the rub isn't it? I have seen a lot of people comment about
how so many more people have died from legal substances like tobacco and
alcohol as opposed to illegal drugs. I just don't see this line of
reasoning as helpful in the battle to legalize some of the currently
illegal drugs.

What do people who say this want? Do they want the currently legal drugs
made illegal? Do they want tobacco smokers and drinkers to suffer under
the same puritanism and persecution that many of us suffer regarding some
currently illegal substances? How many people would die, if suddenly,
every drug became legal? How many stupid people, who think that because
something is legal it must be ok to consume it in overwhelming quantity,
would go out and get themselves hurt, or hurt others, through their own
ignorance or lack of caring? 

What is, and has been, lacking in this equation, at least in America, is
education. I have seen it at parties, I have seen it on this list. For
example, the dipshit(and I do not apologize for my choice of words) who
thinks it is perfectly acceptable to burn a fatty right before hopping 
into the car and driving home. Would you want this person next to you on
the freeway? With so much ignorance among the "rebels" and the unwashed
masses alike, is legalization really that great of an idea?

I am not sure the last of this is true.  Politics has some connections to
the rave scene, particularly politics of freedom of speech and expression.
Know any parties shut down lately by the cops?  Wonder why?  What could
motivate the authorities to shut down a large group of people dancing?  It
is more than just a clash of cultures.  Gatherings are where ideas are
spread.  Where examples are set.  Where small rebellions (drugs, music
beyond the norm, youth cooperating together and having a good time) show by
their success that other kinds of rebellion are also possible.  There is a
politics to dancing (licenses, limits on kinds of music, the push for
commercialism); there is a politics to rave music (the difficulty in
marketing it; its underground nature).  There is something very rebellious
to being able to hug a stranger in a society that encourages people to stay
home, watch TV alone, and be good little consumers.  Society no longer
encourages people to look around at their community and see that we have
common interests.  That ravers are able to form their own communities is
dangerous, because people who band together have power, a power capable, in
principle, of being used against the powers that be.  Consider the Medical
Marijuana Proposition benifit next week, the Food Not Bombs benifit last
week, the crackdown on raves in England and the subsequent movement againt
the Criminal Justice Bill (which made gatherings with "repetitive beats"
illegal, as well as removing the right to silence for anyone arrested, along
with other terrible provisions).  Note that in England, raves and rave music
are basically mainstream.  The music is played in clubs in all major (and
most minor) cities (even the greatest of DJs there play the club scene;
some, like MR C, own their own clubs).

No matter how mainstream raving may get, I feel ravers will remain capable
of staying beyond the manipulative grasp of commercialism and pedestrian
culture.

Peace, love, UNITY(!), and respect,
Kerry

No, we needed a place to DANCE!   The Dead got me hooked on dancing!
Couldn't get enough of it even when Jerry was still alive so I started raving.

Nobody told them that it was possible to do what we are obviously doing,

I'm never "sober" when I dance, because the act of dancing, by itself,
takes me far away from any mental state that fits that description.

It probably just means he is giving the drugs more credit than they are due.

Sorry to keep this string going, I know it is getting rather boring...but I
have to get my .02c in too...

A few days ago I was talking to my brother about the Fantasy Island party
and how much fun I had.  My father (suffering from the nosiness plague that
seems to affect all parents) took it upon himself to eavesdrop on the
entire conversation (including the part when I told my brother about how
spiritual it was to take e).  Later that night my father found me outside
smoking and came over to give me the usual 'You know one of these days your
lungs are going to start bleeding and I don't want to hear your complaining
when it happens!' lecture, but he decided to take it to a different level. 
He started talking about how he 'overheard' my conversation with my brother
about my raving and how it bothered him.  You see, my father is a police
officer here in Livermore.  So he proceeded to go off about all this legal
mumbo jumbo about how raves are all illegal and all they do is promote drug
usage.  Then he brought up the Leeza show!  (I haven't seen this show
personally so I can't really make a judgement on it quite yet).  He told me
that he saw how all the people on the show were just strung out addicts
that just went to raves as an excuse to get p*ucked up.  He practically hit
me when he started talking about me doing E.  He told me that he couldn't
believe that he raised a son that was so weak that he had to resort to
using drugs to have a good time..blah blah blah.  I finally calmed him down
and tried to explain to him what raves are really about.  Meeting people
and exposing yourself and others to a loving, nuturing community where
there are no enemies.  He tried to play it off like it was just the drugs
talking.  By this time I started screaming at him (something I regret
horribly, I find it very disrepctful to lose your temper like that).  But
my battle was one, we left the conversation with him having a better
understanding as to why I rave and me having a stronger sense of love from
my father.  After all, he really does care about me and he doesn't want me
exposed to a 'scene' where he thinks bad things are going on.  OK...my
babbling is over.

Hugs and love to everyone for putting up with my rambling!

Ya know... after XLR8R folks threatened to call the cops and shut down H3 
unless they got in for free, I just can't support them anymore.

Hi!
Since we're all on the subject of being non-subjectual, I thought I'd 
tell anyone on the list who wants to listen about an incredible place 
that my girlfriend and I just
came back from, the incredible Anasazi ruins centering on Chaco Canyon (New 
Mexico)

All I can say is that Chaco is an experience that will blow anyone away 
who takes the time to visit it. It is the remains of an incredibly developed
prehistoric civilization, right in our own backyard.

If anyone wants to hear my story, drop me an email at "chris@ncafe.com"
DONT REPLY TO THIS ADDRESS.. and I'd be glad to tell you more..

Chaco is a real-life mystery....

Wow..

I think there is a distinction between a chain letter and a petition
chain letters are to change -LUCK-
and petitions are written/signed to bring about -SOCIAL CHANGE-

If you do not believe in your responsibilities as a citizen I surely hope 
you never complain about the far reaching ramifications of governmental 
legislation, one that perhaps will seem far removed form your own 
interests and that of those around you.

My motives in forwarding the petition to save PBS are not merely based in 
the fact that I like Sesame St. and I think Elmo is fuzzy and cute.
I believe television programming is an issue pertinent to the whole of 
our society. Television often becomes an insidious vehicle of oppression- 
the view presented therein become views perceived as mainstream and 
empirical facts. If you asked a child where they learn something, more 
often than not they will respond, "I learned it on TV". 
Children seem to have an umbilical cord attached to a screen, and I do 
not believe that that is a value statement.

If we examine they purveyors of our notions of body image, gender roles, 
violence and crime, "hero" myths, and other forms of human interaction, 
they stem from things we as a nation are able to view as a whole. The 
marketability and societal effect of violence should not be 
underestimated. This is not to say that I believe in censorship. I just 
think children- and others- should be able to learn their numbers and 
letters, something most would agree is more pertinent to the development 
of our society than steamy sexy scenes and 1001 ways of killing the 
foreign enemy.

Hello and Happy Friday everyone!  Yay!  The dirge of the work week
(Ariel Meadow Stallings: during the week restless Document Specialist
--read as: file monkey-- at a busy Palo Alto law firm, during the
weekend crazed gruving raver...who would have known?!) is finally
done, and now it's time to celebrate our two days of fun! :) :)

I'm not going down to LA this weekend so I hope I will be seeing all
of you tonight at Charity!  Looks like it's going to be a good
party...and for a good cause.  Who could be happier!?  If you see me
(I'll be wearing phat pants, a striped citrisy colored tank top and a
glowing red "go dogs" hat or pigtails...and maybe I'll even bring my
mickey gloves!) come and say hi! :)

And for those of you who are headed elsewhere tonight (Pacific, X
Files, etc) have a wonderful time and a wonderful weekend!

Loves to All!

After moving into to my new apartment and staying up way too late at
TND last night, I am still ready for Charity tonight! So you will see
me there with the usual ergonomic features (flashing bike lights, big
chain o' laminates, army pants, etc) and some additional safety
features.

So anyone know if there'll be any jungle tonight? Thusfar, I've
only heard rumors, but I'll pack my Alieve just in case.

And a big-ass public thank you easter bunny to Brendan for helping me
move my stuff last night!!! Brendan, you're da *bomb* ;)

Steve

I was wondering what kind of reply you got to this post?  I am of a 
similar status...a newbie.  I just started grad school at Berkeley.  I 
love the music and have used the rave environs as a place to enjoy the 
music and be with my friends.

Since I'm fresh here and my dept wont typically have people into the same 
things as myself, I havent really had the opportunity to experience what 
this area has to offer, I basically just dont know anyone and I have no 
means of transportation.

I tried using this list last week to muster up some possibilities but 
nothing came up.  So if you have any more success than myself I'd love to 
take part.

you could eme or call 845-3088

Greetings, all you SFRAVERS!!!!!

Yup, I'm down here in LA for school, but I didn't want to wait until I
moved back up to keep in touch with all of you.  

I miss the bay area!!!  Things aren't quite the same here, when your
family is up there!

Anyways, I'd just like to say hello to all of you, and hope things are
well.  I'm going to be coming home the weekend of October 13; I'll
probably see many of you.

MANY HUGS and SMILES!!!!!!

:-)  Karen (karenk420)

DEATH OF AN INNOCENT
     
********************************
     
     
     
I went to a party, Mom, I remembered what you said.
     
You told me not to drink, Mom, so I drank soda instead.
     
I really felt proud inside, Mom, the way you said I would.
     
I didn't drink and drive, Mom, even though others said I should.
     
     
     
I know I did the right thing, Mom, I know you are always right.
     
Now the party is finally ending, Mom, as everyone is driving out of sight.
     
As I got into my car, Mom, I knew I'd get home in one piece.
     
Because of the way you raised me, so responsible and sweet.
     
     
     
I started to drive away, Mom, but as I pulled out into the road,
     
the other car didn't see me, Mom, and hit me like a load.
     
As I lay there on the pavement, Mom, I hear the policeman say,
     
the other guy is drunk, Mom, and now I'm the one who will pay.
     
     
     
I'm lying here dying, Mom.  I wish you'd get here soon.
     
How could this happen to me, Mom?  My life just burst like a balloon.
     
There is blood all around me, Mom, and most of it is mine.
     
I hear the medic say, Mom, I'll die in a short time.
     
     
     
I just wanted to tell you, Mom, I swear I didn't drink.
     
It was the others, Mom.  The others didn't think.
     
He was probably at the same party as I.
     
The only difference is, he drank and I will die.
     
     
     
Why do people drink, Mom?  It can ruin your whole life.
     
I'm feeling sharp pains now.  Pains just like a knife.
     
The guy who hit me is walking, Mom, and I don't think it's fair.
     
I'm lying here dying and all he can do is stare.
     
     
     
Tell my brother not to cry, Mom.  Tell Daddy to be brave.
     
And when I go to heaven, Mom, put "Daddy's Girl" on my grave
     
Someone should have told him, Mom, not to drink and drive.
     
If only they had told him, Mom, I would still be alive.
     
     
     
My breath is getting shorter, Mom.  I'm becoming very scared.
     
Please don't cry for me, Mom.  When I needed you, you were always there.
     
I have one last question, Mom, before I say good bye.
     
I didn't drink and drive, so why am I the one to die?

     If the mind is happy, not only the body but the whole world will be 
     happy.  So one must find out how to become happy oneself.  Wanting to 
     reform the world without discovering one's true self is like trying to 
     cover the whole world with leather to avoid the pain of walking on
     stones and thorns.  It is much simpler to wear shoes.

Hey there all you beautiful people,
 I hope to meet more of you and exchange real hugs as opposed to virtual 
ones.I will be at charity tonight. I will be wearing blue jeans, a blue 
soccer shirt with white lines on it and glasses. Six foot tall male of 
possible Hispanic or East Indian descent, short hair. Hope to see y'all then.

Ah, some wisdom on a friday afternoon. I couldn't resist, here are some of

 friends. The glistening tear on the cheek of a golden child. But
 personally, I'd mud-wrestle my own mother for a ton of cash, an

Do not remove a fly from a friend's forehead with a chopstick.

Paranoia doesn't mean the whole world really isn't out to get you.

Majority, n.:

The main obstacle to progress is not ignorance, but the illusion of knowledge.

As long as we can produce the Taj Mahal, Shakespeare and striped toothpaste,

In Switzerland they had brotherly love, five hundred years of democracy and
peace, and what did they produce? The cuckoo clock.

Smoking is, if not my life, then at least my hobby. I love to smoke.
Smoking is fun. Smoking is cool. Smoking is, as far as I am concerned, the
entire point of being an adult.
(Fran Lebowitz)

Laugh and the world laughs with you. Snore and you sleep alone.
(Anthony Burgess)

The optimist proclaims that we live in the best of all possible worlds; and
the pessimist fears this is true.

Alright, bear with me:

I'm trying to convince two of my favorite djs from Seattle/Vancouver
(DJ Czech and Jon Lemmon, aka capt. ky) that they need to come play
parties in San Francisco.  Jon said to me:  "get me the addresses or
phone #s of promoters and Czech and I will mail tapes down and see if
anyone (besides you, Ariel) is interested."  Obviously my love of the
djs does not a whole party make.  Anyway, my response to Jon was
"duh?" since I don't know any promoters in the bay area and I don't
even know how to find them (other than just wandering around parties
and asking strangers).

Does anyone have any suggestions?  Czech tends to play house and
breaks (ah, the BEST breaks) and Jon is mostly house, although he
also can do some fucking AMAZING downbeats.  Can I play middle
(wo)man and refer the djs to the promoters and then reap the benefits
of good music??

Please email me privately with any suggestions...Thank you so much!

Ariel

Hi Renzo--

Excuse me, but do I/should I know you? Is there some reason you sent me this
maudlin piece of crap? I trust it wasn't a joke sent in questionable taste! 

While I believe in responsible ecstasy, I also believe in honoring one's
intelligence--and that of one's friends.  This piece does neither! How could
you feel positive about DEATH OF AN INNOCENT unless your emotional and
intelligence quotients have temporarily (hopefully not permanenty!) dropped
to the level of cretin?

Looking forward to your reply,
om namah shivaya,
Will

Hey folks...

  Since people are posting descriptions & stuff, figured I might as well
do the same.  Baaaaa.
  Skinny, fairly tall, short (grown out buzzcut) brown hair, *big* grin,
black corduroys & a big orange t-shirt (which looks pink under
blacklights)  with a yellow dancing figure on a blue background.  I'll be
there from start to finish, and am very likely to be selling water during
the night at some point.
  Free hugs to the first 10,000 people who come up to me and mention this
posting :)
  Can't wait to see you all there!!!  (where?  I forgot to mention that
part... charity tonight, probably the Funky Tekno Tribe free outdoor
gathering in Golden Gate park tomorrow, and hopefully Sunset.  I'm
feeling energetic today... we'll see about tomorrow :)

You know what... I have to admit that I am getting really scared watching
TV lately...

In general, a disturbing theme has developed... The conservatives are
coming!

I dunno... Those Bob Dole commercials and all these talk shows lately are
beginning to frighten me. For example I was watching a talk show and they
were talking about GHB... Now, I understand the concern for people having
died or had reactions to GHB, but the first thing everyone said was "Ban
it!" "Make it illegal now!" This bothered me, because instead of finding
out the problem or understanding the situation, the public's consensis
seemed to be "just get it out of our sights, and it'll solve our problems."
This is certainly not true! Though I am just as concerned about drug abuse
as the next person, I really believe that people need to understand the
chemicals and substances that are out there, that people WOULD consume even
IF they are illegal... In other words, we need to understand the problems
before we can solve them. I was getting so upset listening to a narcotic
officer keep saying that "This substance is deadly, that substance is
deadly..." I wish she would simply EXPLAIN why they are deadly, because I
want to understand... 

Oh well... I was just thinking about how many social problems don't get
examined, instead the law makers just decided to cover them up by slapping
"illegal" on them...

Sorry... I rambled...

Anyways, hope to see all ya KRAZY people tonight at Charity! :)

Hi.
     
I don't mean to get involved, but could you keep these sorts of 
responses personal, rather than to the whole list?
     
Actually, that death of innocent post was sent to SFRaves a couple of 
months ago for the first time; it was well received and started some 
interesting conversation.

	You have to admit its convenient though -- the result is that the gov't 
makes these handy lists of substances to look for.  They're even broken into an 
A list (*whole* lotta fun), a B list (worth trying anyway), a C list (the ones 
your mother gives you), and so on...

Um. Sure.  Ok, how about this:

"Direction is highly overrated.  The undirected hiker is never going the 
wrong way".
        -- SDream

I guess another way to look at it would be to say that when you focus on one 
thing, you have focussed on something that, if not attained, defines your 
efforts as failures.  At the opposite extreme, if you focus on nothing and 
are happy that way, you never risk failure.

The opposing view goes something like this:

"To sail to new lands, you first have to leave the safety of the harbor."
        -- dunno

On the other hand, if you see new harbors in all that is around you, you 
rarely have to forego safety for new vistas.

Is that enough philosophy for one day?  It's Friday.  I shouldn't be 
thinking this hard...

     Hello SFRaves,
        In response to the e-mail below. No, the poem I posted to the list 
     earlier was not meant as a joke. Nor was it meant to be funny or 
     positive. I apologize if you were offended or if you felt that I 
     insulted your intelligence. I, in no way meant to suggest that you are 
     all not responsible enough to know better than to drink and drive. I 
     simply felt that it was a very sad poem being that I know people 
     involved in such accidents. I replied privately to the character who 
     sent me the e-mail below and decided that I should also respond to the 
     list with an apology. I felt that the author was a bit harsh and maybe 
     misinterpreted my reason for sharing it with the list. That's all. 
     Have a great weekend. Later......
     
     -Renzo

Hi Renzo--
     
Excuse me, but do I/should I know you? Is there some reason you sent me this 
maudlin piece of crap? I trust it wasn't a joke sent in questionable taste! 
     
While I believe in responsible ecstasy, I also believe in honoring one's 
intelligence--and that of one's friends.  This piece does neither! How could 
you feel positive about DEATH OF AN INNOCENT unless your emotional and 
intelligence quotients have temporarily (hopefully not permanenty!) dropped 
to the level of cretin?
     
Looking forward to your reply,
om namah shivaya,
Will

Renzo, don't apologize, it's totally unnecessary

Yeah the poem is a little corny but it has a very important message and 
most of us know you posted it because you care about the people on this 
list and want to remind us of something we might otherwise forget about...

And, as someone else pointed out, this poem was posted previously, to a 
warm reception by people - many people shared their stores of loved ones 
who had been hurt.  I know it made ME more aware of driving under the 
influence ("oh, I've only had a few beers" no longer being acceptable), 
and I am thankful for that!

N

SFR Friends -
If we find something objectionable in a person's posts, I think we can 
find a more constructive way to discuss it with the person than degrading 
insults.  I'm glad that "private" posts was sent to the list - maybe it 
will get each of us thinking of how we can communicate more effectively 
and in a more respectful manner.

:)
(insert overused SFR acronym here)

     I'm going to celebrate my release of authority/responsibility this 
     weekend.  I'm considering partying my ass off... think I should?  I'm 
     starting with Charity and I'll see where I end up by Monday.
     
     I have a new boss now.  It's not me.  He's an incompetent ass kisser 
     that I hired almost two years ago.  I'm so excited!  I can't wait!
     
     So to all of you who see me this weekend, I would like to introduce a 
     modified Andy.  Now that I am free of the responsibilities of managing 
     a small group of underresourced geniuses, I can let go more than ever.
     
     Kinda bummed... but sorta relieved.  The corporate ladder now looks 
     like the corporate stepstool.  A little less imposing on the horizon, 
     but not too awe inspiring either.
     
     Plus, now that I'm a normal geek again I can ditch the tie and collar 
     scene.  Ahhhhhh.
     
     The joys of corporate restructuring.
     
     -Skyscraper, I love you-
     
     AndyW
     
     p.s.       I wanted to thank whatever entity is responsible for the 
     invention of the Technics1200SLmkII.  I bought my first one earlier 
     this week, screwed a fresh Stanton in there, and now everything sounds 
     so pretty... mmmmm..... vinyl.  If anybody's got another one out there 
     for sale... me hungry for more fun stuff.  So fun digging through the 
     old rekkkkerdz tooo~!

hi...

just a quick question for all of you out there :)

Have any of you experienced, or do you know of anyone that has
experienced, any strange neurological sensations 1-2 days after
doing 'e'.  

The symptoms could include:

	tingling sensations anywhere on the body (similar to 
	what may occur while doing 'e')
	eye-strain
	sub-cutaneous pressure (pressure under the skin)
	sunburn like sensations under the skin
	etc.

These symptoms may tend to come and go, for hours or for days at a time. 

If anyone has heard of these or knows of these, please e-mail me.

thanx

hugz :)

Actually I got a totally gruuuuuvin response. This list is really cool. I 
almost instantly met 3 people in my direct area and wanted to try out 
Charity tonight. Unfortunatly, I didn't get to go. I have been a little 
bummed lately because I work waaaaayyyyy too much and just wanted to take 
the full day off.

I am going to try going to Sunset and meet some new people there.

This is also a public "Thank You" to all of those that responded to my 
post. I have never had it so easy when meeting new people. I am working 
on my own personal page and will point you to it if you want to get to 
know me before we ever met in the real world.

Thanks a lot!

And by the way you didn't leave your name.... J Cohen... Is that John? 
Jim? Jack?
What do you do? The list, I'm sure, would be interested in knowing what 
you do and like.

Sincerely,

Matt Petrowsky "DiGumo"

PlayScool review  (c) by Crunchman

About a week ago,   I get this posting in SoCal Raves about PlayScool,
indicating that Todd (the promoter) was on the net.

I wanted to put together a nice little review of this big massive with
pictures,   narration and interviews with the promoter (Todd),  and
some of the DJ's.

I sent Todd an Email message with my intent,  asking in return to be
placed on the guest list,  and Todd wrote back....

"How are ya.  No problem on the guest list but I do not have a place
to stash your camera.  There should be a coat check upstairs with
Mandies Candies. You should be able to check it with her.  I hope you
enjoy Playscool. It is not your typical rave because we do have a
variety of Music and also alcohol which some ravers don't like being
around.  With that said.Enjoy and I would love to read your review
and see the picutres afterwards.  E-mail after the event and maybe
we can hook up"

Ok,  so I haul out the camera and arrange a safe place to stash it,  and
head out to the Sports Arena in San Diego fairly early to get a feel for
the place.

I walk up to the WILL CALL and learn that I HAD a comp ticket,  but
Todd had changed his mind and I was to pay half price for the ticket
and my associate would get NO price break on his ticket (who was to
act as my assistant and take charge of the camera,  so I can dance).

So,  I reluctantly shelled out the $10 I was to use to make my
evening more enjoyable like food,  drinks,  and whatever.   Then,  I
headed back to the car with my camera and my mind set on NOT
taking any pictures or doing anything to publicize his party,  and felt
personally betrayed,  and a victim of his greed.

Later,  I learned that Todd has lied on numerous occasions and made
promises to guest list people and then not keeping his promise.
Other people I talked to,   have also substantiated this.

Anyway,  that aside,  I finally enter the huge complex and was
astounded with the size of the whole shindig.   I spent some time,
soaking up the vibe,  going from room to room,  checking things out,
and showing up at the Acid booth to see if I can meet some SoCal
ravers,  but nobody came up and said Hi,   and I didn't recognize
anyone.    I wore my SFRaves laminate and old "Friends and Family"
ticket for easy recognition.

Noticed a LOT more beer drinkers than usual,  but saw a lot of happy
faces and it didn't take me long to discover the Trance room and I
got down to the serious business of dancing until Kelly came on.   I
met Kelly at the Loft a few days previously and we hung out on the
Loft turntables and spin some choons...  I gave Kelly my master tape
for his opinion (soon to be released).

Kelly Lynch played an amazing variety of house,  trance/house,
breakbeat,  shoons that kept me movin and a groovin....    until I per
chance heard a snippet of beats coming from the other room.    The
sound level in the main room was so loud that it tickled my nose,
and I was constantly scratching it,  but I did find a "Sweet spot" and
seemed to avoid the wet beer spillage on the floor without slipping.

The other side room was more crowded,  but I eventually worked up
to the DJ setup to learn this girl was spinning some sick trance and
techno....  Excellent thumpin set....  that got me totally lost out there
in Trance land....

Something broke my trance,  and I snapped out of it,  and wandered
into the other room to hear this live act.   Because I had made up my
mind NOT to cover it in a more complete report,  I made no effort to
learn who it was.  Instead I danced like there was no tomorrow,
until my feet told me it was time to chill....  So I slipped out of the
main stream for a while to remove a few "energy blockages" by
doing some Yoga before heading back in the main room.   I caught
Kelley's last track before there was the characteristic break between
DJ's - I noticed this a lot....  In SF,.  the Dj switch over is hardly
noticeable.  unless you look up and see them switch.   Down here,
the changeover is quite a bit more pronounced.    They had this MC
guy,  rapping over the music that I found distracting,  so I headed
back to the main trance room just in time to hear Thee-o GETTING
OFF big time with some Hard trance of the likes I haven't heard since
I visited Australia.

My energy level was peaking at this time,  dancing like there was no
tomorrow for his entire set non-stop....  Excellent 150 - 160 BPM
hard trance,  happy and melodic,  got be bouncing off the walls
literally.....   I met about 20 people from Sf area who had moved
down to San Diego and were surprised to learn I was living down
here as well.

Eventually Thee-o's set faded out,  and someone made announcement
about the upcoming act,  Hardkiss,  or something like that,  but I was
already leaving the room,  heading for my private little Yoga space,
intent on a little stretching and chilling.

The act in the main room was pretty weak and didn't really impress
me,  so I headed back into the side techno room again to hear some
good fast trancy techno and jumped right into the groove and lost my
reality for about an hour.   By that time,  it was about 2:30,  and the
BPM's dropped significantly such that I lost interest in dancing and
headed back into the main room.    Rabbit in the Moon was in the
middle of their live set that captured my attention for a while,  but
my allegiance was trance,   so I slipped back to the Trance room to
hear What I thought was Mike Orasco ripping it up....   Much slower
than Thee-o,  but excellent melodic and happy trance with good
thump to it,  but was getting a lot of "Bleed through" from the main
room.

I found a good sound "Sweet spot" and had unobstructed view of the
video in the main room that really enhanced my trance state,  not to
mention the awesome lasers.

Despite "Rabbit in the Moon" in the main room,   I stayed in the
trance room until the end,  which came all too soon.  Boo!  for having
such an awsome party end so early....

I eventually make it back to the Loft to chill and write this report.

Weather your a Trance tripper, or one of those cool stuffed with fluff
housers, or believe that one can only really ever get an "O" with techno,
or that the jungle tip is the shit, you have something in coomon with all
other
member's of the rave scene: you smoke pot (or, if you don't, you don't
resent or change your attitude about some one who does).  So what better
issue then proposition 215, the medical marijuana initiative, then to
bring together the most diverse dj line-up for quite sometime.
     For anyone who is still in the dark about prop 215 this is a
stae-wide propsal to legalize the use and cultivation of marijuana for
people who are deemed by a doctor that using marijuana would be benificial
to there help, from procecution by the authorities.  This propsition is
being voted on on November 5th, the same day as the Presidential election.  
And lo my people, please be happy, because now there is finnally a reason
to vote!
Anyway, that's enough plugging, what about the rave itself?

Floor three: "Dance'n'Trance.  Trance dj's Theta Blip, Myster-E, et-al,
will be taking you on a magical journey (?!) to the land of trance; depart
time 9.pm!  Featuring a live performance by Terbo Ted and vissuals by 
Peter-Booth-Lee.

Floor two: Neon Soul Kitchen. Sit down and relax or get down right
funky in the Dinning Room as Food NOt Bombs feeds and refreshes you with
Chi and eats while Dj's Mr.Trippy and other's soothe your soul with
Ambient Techno and the retro tip.  

Floor one:  The techno Zone.  Dj's Eathen and co will proove once and for
all that you only get an "O" with techno.  Vissuals by gateway.

The Bottom floor.  "Reality Check."  Tired of repetive beats for a bit?
Then come and chill out down here.  Featuring speakers Denis Peron (CBC
founder and one of the biggest pot heads of all times), John Perry Barlow
and live performaces by Exterminating Angel and Anzi as well as stalls and
information booths to educate and free your mind.

We still need a few bits and pieces such as more lighting and ideas.  If

stalls/information booths, backdrops, etc, etc, please conatact me Tristan
either by e-mailing me sandoz@sfsu.edu or paging me 415-220-4173. 




Please come and have a good time and please register to vote so that we
can ease the the suffering of literally millions of Californians and teach
that no good scum-bag Wilson and his crony DA Lungrin a lesson in
democracy they will never forget. 

Using the unifying power of the dance to keep hemp alive,

Tristan.

Does this shit get any better?We journeyed far in the quest for the phat 
beats and the good vibes, little did we know how close we were to the 
motherlode.We (Ben, Gerhard, and me) got there early and helped in some 
of the set up. HAd a blast actually seeing the space before it became the 
manic, hyperactive, spliced reality, stream of consciousness energy 
vortex that it became. In essence, what I'm saying is that I had the time 
of my life... again. 
Once again I was able to divide my time meeting people and dancing like a 
madman. That perfect balance was reached. Got to meet all the trippers 
that I've wanted to and this time actually got phone numbers and e-mail 
addresses. ben and me were particularly moved by the litereature that was 
available in the ambient room on that desk. If any of you know the origins 
of that stuff, I would appreciate any info.
 Greetings and hugz to all the people I met in particular:
Ashley,Libby, Heidi, Michelle, Rick, Brendan, Greg, Marjo, Clench(like 
jaw not fist!) Moonpup, Andy, Adam, Philip, Lucas, David, David, Jesse, 
Sy,Eric Peterson, Ran, FatherTime,Rudi, John, Vicki etc. forgive me if I 
forgot your 
name, I still remember your smile and our hugz. The pace is familiar but 
I can't quite remember the mane. 
Ian, our impromptu recitation and 
analysis of Police and Beatles music 
was one of the conversations that pushed my night teetering and tottering 
into a very spiritual zone.
I finally met Steveo again whom I haven't seen since an F-8 party in June. 
and of course, Ariel, whom I right away recognised by her Phat pants and 
impish grin. 
The music in the main room was incredible when I think Deaks was spinning. I 
was walking on clouds all the way through that set .
I'll see y'all next week same time same place unless I see you at sunset 
tomorrow.
Until then,
LOVE 
Dhiren

My favorite lyric of the day off a compilation called Rave-o-Lution (yes 
I thought it was an original name too!)and it goes" YOU KNOW WE CAN DO 
THIS, YOU KNOW WE CAN DO THIS, YOU NOW WE CAN DO THIS, ....... WE ALWAYS 
DO THIS....." repeat ad infinitum. By the time the song's over I am 
utterly convinced that whatever THIS is we can do it.

The evening started off with a trip to Bezerkeley, to get some *supplies* for 
the evening at Charity. Made it to the Acme about midnight, after eating some 
lovely zoomers, organically grown of course. There was a group of 6 of us, 2 
guys and 4 girls, and it was two girlz' first rave.  For some reason, they 
kinda freaked (a little sensory overload, I think) and took off about two 
o'clock. 

Finding the mushroom room was key, as I had had a little too much and needed 
some space to chill and get over that peak. The feeling passed, and then the 
basement was calling. Danced hard for another 2 hours, then went up to the top 
floor, sat in front of one of the bass cabinets, and got lost in the jungle. I 
think that's one of the main reasons I love to go to parties: just to "feel" 
the music, to feel the fuzzy bass tones reverberating (sp?) through the body.  
I call it my "electronic acupressure therapy".

Anywayz, re-found the hardy survivors of our group, and danced in the main 
floor from 4 to 6, up at the very front of the room. Who was spinning then? I'm 
never able to keep track of the DJs, so when I find one that rocks (as he did), 
It would be great to know who it was. Also key was the wonderful gentleman who 
was passing out cups  of ice and water bottles. Danke!

Question: Upon leaving, the only complaint of the group that I brought to this 
was that they felt "old", which sounds funny because most of them are 23 (I'm 
24), and 24 sure as hell doesn't feel old. HOWEVER, I do sorta know how they 
feel as it seems that alot of the smaller parties either are targeted towards 
or seem to attract the "raver kids", who are all in high school or just out, 
and who all seem to know each other. On the other hand , the "massives" seem to 
attract a much broader range of ages and "types" of people, but massives also 
sometimes lose something in the vibe. 

So, what's the answer? Is raving something you outgrow? That's a depressing 
thought, as I believe the vibe, feeling, awareness, connectedness, and "karma" 
one gets from the scene are truly unique and special. But how many people in 
their 30's did you see at Charity? I was imagining if I was 30, would I feel 
comfortable dancing and hanging out with people in their 'teens?  Would they 
fee comfortable with me? Perhaps Leslie holds the answer to this, but she's on 
vacation. Certainly, the love, awareness and other feelings can be internalized 
and carried with one's self throughout life. 

Just a few thoughts. This is in no way a diss on younger ravers; indeed, I 
personally get a good charge from the energy of youth.  I just want to 
know....what does the future hold for us grandpappys in our 20's and beyond?  
:)   :)  :)

Peace out!

It's 4:35pm.  I've been up of 35 hours.  The question occurs to me - why
do I do this to myself?  And then it comes to me... that creeping grin
that starts as a smirk and winds up hurting my face, as I remember the
reasons (and there are many!)

Charity was beautiful.  Purr, purr!  Hard work, trying to get the ACME
into decent shape, I must say.  I was recruited as a helper, which in my
case meant sweeping out the whole place Thursday night and then Friday
helping with the decorations, an hour of door duty and a little under two 
hours selling water (downstairs).  I've said it before, I'll say it again
- - I get a real charge out of helping out!

I was pretty well exhausted by the start of the party, and was really not
expecting to do much dancing.  Hah!  Silly me forgot how much I love
jungle :)  Though actually the dancing started out with what would turn
out to be my only dancing on the main floor, very early on, while Greg was
spinning.  Yummy stuff.  But really, I did 90% of my dancing on the top
floor, during the 5 or 6 hours while they were spinning jungle up there.

Too bad about the space limitations.  I really prefer to have a large
space for dancing.  I just made do with what I had, most of the time :)
I must say, it was really wierd (to me) to have people start cheering at
my dancing.  Not a bad thing, just really strange.  It was *so* much fun,
anyway.  Left me craving more, though.  With space, preferably :)

And of course there was the wonderful people.  Much of the same crowd that
has been at the Harmony parties I've attended.  Which is great!  I did
less socializing than I have been recently - my prime social hours (after
4am or so) were spent *almost* sleeping to the trip-hop on the top floor.
I did meet a lot of great new people (some of whose names I may even
remember!) thanks mainly to the gifts I gave out.

I vaguely remember helping out with tearing down, too.  I was pretty
tired.  I played a few records for the cleanup crew, which was great fun.
And by the time Melanie drove me home - 12:30 or so - the place was pretty
well back to normal (i.e. utterly filthy but without any decorations :)

For some reason, when I got home I wasn't able to sleep.  So... trundled
on down to Organic, Funky Tekno Tribe's free autumn equinox celebration in
Golden Gate park (20 minute walk from my place.)  It was a housey party
with a housey vibe - happy but lacking in depth.  But it was outdoors, it
was a beautiful day, and I was too tired to notice my legs screaming, so I
danced... just a little.  Left at about 4pm.  I'm not a big house fan -
but I recognize that this was high quality house and a *very* nice sound
system.  Mars was there... if only he'd been spinning.... mmm...

Tomorrow - sunset.  If there is one?  I believe so.  This will be my very
first sunset.  I'll be well rested, hopefully, by then.

It's been (and continues to be) "One of Those Weekends".  Cool!  Next
weekend, I'm looking forward to not raving (with the exception,
perhaps, of sunset).  Gotta recover the legs.  Hurtin'!

See (some of) you folks tomorrow!  Pleasant dreams and/or happy dancing,
wherever you are tonight!

too crowded, too hot, too dangerous.  otherwise, good party.

cripes, I thought that by this time we know the max capacity 
of Acme, and I hoped ticket sales would reflect that.

I would not have minded spending $2 more for a ticket if it meant that the
ticket sales were capped at a reasonable limit.

Shit, how can you blame anyone for going to a dope party like that, but
especially those under 21, where there's no age limit.  Whatdaya expect
them to watch a moive with their 'rents?

"I feel old." ??  Get off it!  How did those in your group feel when they
were partying at 17-21?  Or were they home watching movies with their
'rents?  =)

There is nothing in this life that you have to outgrow unless 1) you want
to; 2) you allow others to force you to; 3) society forces you to (for
moral reasons); or 4) you just get bored with it.  And I think what happens
to most ravers is number 2, and even more so, number 4.  That's why you
find older ravers becoming more involved, so they don't just go out to
parties all the time, they throw them.

I saw a number of people in that age range, and you know what, maybe by
them hanging out with 'teens, they look feel and ARE younger.  So maybe you
didn't recongize them, huh?  But here's the thing, maybe they can guide and
teach the teens.  I think it's astounding, and probably one of the ONLY
social settings where you have old and young partying alike, and partying
that hard.  I think it's a great thing.

Whatever the fuck you want!

Tony

P.S.  I was at the door from 12-2 and in my professional opinion the crowd
was not THAT young.  Harmnony 3 year?  Now THAT was a young crowd. But you
know those Harmony kids... =)

Well, this is number 11 and I've promised myself that no matter what I
write I will send it.

...No wait, I just had to delete something.

...Fuck, I had to again!

All I can say is the promoter seems to have gotten ripped off...

        Yeah. . . my mom was influenced a bit too. She was talking about how
stupid those parents were on the show and how everyone needs to come

Yes, it IS finally happening... The wacky Swede is going to show
up at an event! =) Here's all the info you'll need:

Place: CCC Party @ some location.
How to spot me: Look for the 6' tall guy with a shaved head. He'll
be wearing black and white pants and a bright orange hunting jacket.
Good ways to strike up a conversation with me: Say something in 
Swedish. =)

See ya there!

        Just so you all know, (but who really cares), I'm attempting to take
my three friends: Jason, Kevin, Ryan, and my girly Lay-cee to love thang.
The last attempts have been thwarted by puke attacks (not from me), and
overall being scared.
        I'll be in a long sleeved red white and blue shirt (which will
probably be replaced with a cooler white shirt), a grey hat, a red winder,
and a few straggly newbies.
Come say YELLO!!!!

Well, we arrived at Casa Zimbabwe at 11, expecting to find the
party going at full speed. Instead, we found a bunch of people
looking bored and NO music. We decided to go grab something to
eat, and then come back. When we returned at 11:45, we met a lot
of discouraged ravers who had been turned down at the door. I
guess their efforts to keep this underground didn't quite do the
trick. I feel sorry for anyone who missed out on this, because
the vibe was great. I guess we'll have to blame Gil's somewhat
[flame.gif] mediocre mixing on the sound equipment or something.
But the tunes he spun still created a wonderful feeling of
euphoria, and I couldn't leave the dance floor. But at 3:30 I
had to leave, and Gil was still spinning. =)

I hope you all had a great time there, I sure did. And just imagine
how could it would have been on a non-slippery floor with a dj
that was on the same team as his equipment... ;)

Last but night least, big ups to the guy who went around the room
handing out glasses of water! =)

reespect, jonas

The Global Rhythm Movement is here in full force. After producing "Megga Buzz
One" with Feel Good Entertainment, we are now seeking any spirited individuals
to help out with Nexus' "2nd Chakra" on Nov. 9. We intend to use theatrical
props, turning the dancefloor into a play stage. Direct interaction is our
focus for this party. Your creative participation will be much appreciated.
please email us privately. :)

Sunset is going to be 3pm - evening, at Point Molate.  I don't drive, so
I'm not really qualified to give directions - but you can call the Pacific
infoline for directions --> (415)985-5264.  See you there!!

Ahh... another great party in the building everyone loves to hate.
Memorable moments for me Fri night include:

Setting up the lights that spelled out "Charity".. getting to the "T"...
having the lights burn out on me (DOH!!) and then doing it all over again.
Paying homage to the Giant Majic Mushroom. Asking a girl what she does and
hearing "I'm an exotic dancer" and replying "oh shure, I hear that ALL the
time" ;). tRiPPy ViSuAls off of my ciggarete. More Visuals from that room
behind the fan, you know, the one that looked 'normal'. Shom (Did I spell
that right?) ending the set in the top room with a telephone ringing for 20
seconds ("You get it!" "No YOU get it!") Talking to Thad before the party.
Getting my backpack back from Randy (Thanks again man! :) ) Sessions with
Eric Peterson. Finally meeting -Brandan- . Watching Karen going wild
sitting on top of the speakers. (<--That was SUCH a Kodak moment!!!! Seeing
her trip out with her hands, the "We are all beautiful people" sign above
her and the energized crowd below her.) Getting into some PHAT Trip-Hop
beats like I never have before.

Well, back to my homework.

        Is it just me or does every single persons directions tke you
somewhere thats pretty cool, but like ten miles from where you'd actually
like to be. I swear, there must be like 20 gas station attendants laughing
their little heads off about those directions they gave me which took me
somewhere in SF (all I remember is ofarrel, mcallister, ofarrel, mcallister,
ofarrell. . . ). I guess I'm just not to hip with the dYeRektuhn thing.?!

        So, eventually me and my buds eventually make it to the map point,
which was housewares (but that didn't help since I was looking for a
tupperware shop). It was on haight (a street which I've been lost, and
found, but haver never found without being lost).  The chick gave me the
tickets, and a little ass piece of paper with like some chinese writing  on
it (may also resemble messy cursive). I sorta found where you were actually
supposed to go, and she didn't tell me that oak would turn into another
road, or you could go straight and race that half asleep guy down the wrong
way of a one way road. I just ended up turning right on the next road down.

        Now, we had to get parking. That was easy compared to merely
stopping at a normal market street intersection. Just a few drives for a few
blocks, and a short walk (refraining from making a rhyme). We gave the
whoevers thier little red tabbs and went in. I talked to some guy named
bello or bollo or jello or something and he gave me his pager number. We all
went in and it was a bit too crowded. It was 2:00 though. And everybody
seems to magically appear at 2:00, but I didn't see them following me?
after a minute or two, me and lay-cee started dancing around. The place was
cool, lots of people to step on you and smile and say sorry (even if it was
MY fault for stepping under their foot at the wrong time). We danced, got
comfy, and kinda settled in.

        My friends Jason and Ryan thought it was cool. They've never gone to
something like this before. People would go up to them and talk to them.
They met a few guys and smoked whatever with them. And some people had some
wicked ass smelling green somewhere. I knew this Johnny guy did (he asked me
to look at his sacks{pot}). I don't know if he thought he was getting his
moneys worth or what but he sure seemed proud of his little baggies. My
girly got tired and lumbered around, my friends just kinda got adjusted to
the new world, and I went out to make a little dust.
        
        It kinda pisses you off a little when you get this killer little
section of sand cleared out so you can dance non-injurily, then these people
come out of nowhere and drop this board on your hole? It's ok. . . they were
cool though. I just loved listening to the music and moving my limbs
whichever direction they wanted to go. I probably looked like a geek wearing
a long sleeve striped shirt with my other shirt hanging from my pants. It
looked cool, but I actually meant to put it on when I got hot, it just never
happened. Dancing was great, the music was great, I didn't like the sand
much though.

        Those two chicks with the flames seemed pretty friendly. They put on
a good little show, and everyone really though it was the bees knees. I
wasn't exactly sure what they were doing the whole time, but it looked like fun.

        We left around 6, and it took like 5 mins to get to the freeway, and
like 15 more home. That's really not fair. I wish I got lost getting home
instead of getting to where I wanted to go. My friends said to call them if
I ever go again, Jason especially reminded me (he'll go a lot). Now I'm
still up, my girly's asleep, and I want to go wake ryan and jason up to go
to Santa Cruz. . . hey, maybe Kevin'll let me drive his 280 (that car is
f****** killer).

        I hope everyone had similar encounters???

Hugyerselves4me. . . 

Oh, and I'm in an especially good mood cuz I'm starting to get to know my
girlfriends friend Jenny better. She's a waaay killer chick to talk to and
she's up on my level. It's wierd how you can have a girlfriend who's
everything to you and there's still someone who can make you feel needed. Or
whatever. I hope we become good friends (that's all). She's more interested
in the things I do than my girly is?? Just a big happy family. . . wait, no.
. . nevermind. . . 


. . . fryin purple people eater. . . 

keep it ON!

(Old Geezer Voice ON)
I'm 34 and I go raving every month or two. I'd go more if it were easy to
go for just a couple of hours. This is about the only thing that makes me
feel old!

(Old Geezer Voice OFF)

But I judge "age" on more of a mental state than anything else. I've got
friends that are 20-50. My 50 year old friend is going to her first rave in
San Diego next week I think. She can't wait. I've got 20 year old friends
who are smarter and more knowledgable than my 30 year old friends.

The only thing most yourer kids have going against them is a lack of
wisdom. It seems that wisdom has to be obtained by experience. Not to say
that there is no such thing as a wise 20 year old, just that that 20 year
old will get much wiser as he/she ages.

I like to guide by telling "war stories"... what happened to me when I did
something. People learn from their own and others experiences... DO NOT
PREACH. DO NOT ACT "HOLIER-THAN-THOU". If you know someone younger than you
is going to do something really stupid; give them survival tips. You can
say you wouldn't do that if you were them, but encourage them to learn for
themselves. Warn them of what might happen and tell them successful ways
you dealt with it.

Besides, most young people like listening to stories from "Rave Moms and Dads".

It gives them hope that they can still be cool when they're old. :->

PS-  I would have made it to Charity if I didn't have to deal with the Map
Point being way over on the other side of town from me (and Acme being
almost down the street). This is another old guy give away: we're too lazy
to deal with map points.

Greetings and hugs all around to my fellow SFRavers...
I want to extend a phat THANK YOU to Raven for inviting me to the CCC party
last night.  I never met her there, maybe next time.

This was the first Rave that I have gone to where the chill room was so
much more live than the dance floor.  Dancing was good, but the vibe that
could be felt coming from this rave could be felt for miles around.  So the
chill room was the place to be.

I have never been around so many wonderful, fun-loving, friendly people in
my life!!!!  BTW:  I was the really annoying guy with the white tank top
and the two flashing bike lights... Thanks for all the hugs and much love
to the two flame dancers that put on a killer show for us as the sun
rose!!!

Much Lovin' all around!!!

all I can say is wow! since I used to live in cz (where the party was) it
was really strange to come in a nd be a guest. I couldnt even get to the
roof to see the view:-( oh well, I have never seen cz as decked out as it
was last night, the people from CCC did a terrific job with the lighting
and turning a kitchen/living room into a totally new space.
	One hightlight for me was before gil came on the drum circle in
the main room and the didgeredoo...that was bad! I never saw someone play
a didgeredoo with a microphone and a mixer before...and watching gil mix
with dat! what a trip! Also, This is the first time that dancing with
drummers in the background wasnt annoying, somehow it mixes in really well
with trance...

ps. One big Hello to Mike Migurski who I finally met in person!

I posted this question I'm about to ask in a private message to someone, 
but would like to ask it to sfraves as well:  Don't you have to know 
someone from CCC to be able to go to their parties?  This is the first 
time any of their parties have been talked about on a public mailing 
list, so I'm wondering if they are staying as underground.

I attened their camp at Burning Man and I ***LOVED*** it and would love 
to go to their parties once I move to SF, but alas, if I don't know the 
right people to get in, I guess I'm SOL.  Any information on this would 
be greatly appreciated; thank you.

love,
Amy

Hey all,

Sorry I posted earlier about going to Charity but I ended up at the Pacific
party instead and I had a GReAT time!!

I heard that Charity was at Acme, which isn't a spectacular venue.  I would
have gone if my sister didn't have an extra tix for me.

This party was near Santa cruz in a very spiritual place in the woods.  It
seemed like a dance studio with the wood floors.  Sheets, decor, black
lighting, and a disco ball and of course great musak.

Everyone was friendly and having a great time.  I met many new friends and
some old ones. No listers ('cept ethan)? anyone else go? The music was
mellow in the main room (s. Murry?) till Ethan came up and got quite a few
souls shakin' including myself.  J. Howard came up with some great trippy
and trancy tracks.  I missed Galen.  I spent some time in the ambient
room-more than time than I usually do. and I heard some great, relaxing but
fluid shit, that kept me interested but not asleep.  Know what I mean? I'm
not sure i do ...n w ways.

It was quite an older crowd which was a refreshing change except that it
was the  first time I felt young at a party.  I got over that with the help
of some hardcore dancing and some conversation..

I love sf and I miss the scene.  I hope I get more chances to drive up and
party again, however I think the next party I might be able to make will be
the FTT Anniversery party.

PLUR

PS I'll probably unsub from this list to concentrate on my school and come
back every once i a while. bye   :(

First off I would like to say that I dont want to get into an argument over
your report of Playscool but I must respond to you review of Playscool.  

First.  You e-mailed e saying you write reviews of raves for your page an
that if iyou were tolet you have a 2 VIP passses you were more inclined to
write a positive review of my club.  That is extortion.  I had a VIP list and
that was a halof price list.  I take full responsibilyt for forgetting to
tell you that it wuold be half price  but it was not in ill intetntion .  I
can show you a copy of my guest list which shows two people at $10.00 each.
 IF the sports arena employee allowed one that is them not me.

  Secondly,  For you to say that I have numerously lied to people about the
guset list is a lie.  First lets look at the guest list issue.  How come a
promoter must always let everyone in free.  I take the attitude I'll work for
free but the D. J. wont so I must get some money to cover my costs.  At the
arena every time the turnstile turns I give teh sports arena $10,00 weather
it is a free or paid ticket.  Myself and I know many other promoters risk
enething wee have to put together a party.  Everyone weants in for free.  I
am the only promoter who can proudly say that in ten yearrs of promonting I
have only been shut down twice, once in 1987 and the other 1992 Apocolypse 2
and I refunded everyones money. NO other promoter can say that they did that.
 I have no problem with you critisizing the event but Please understand.
 D.J.;s insurance bands all cost money. 
      They have to be paid.  If people really supported the scen they would
come up with some money to pay for this talent.  If you are to review this
scene it should not matter weather you get in free or not.  That doesnt
change the quality of the show. If I sound bitter I am sorry but one of the
reasons I am getting out of promoting is I cant afford to risk everthing I
have and then have everyone expec to get in for free so they can be happy.
 Again I apologize for any inconvience but if you don't feel that 21 D.J.'s 7
bands, a fully permited legal, insured locatin was not worth ten dollars that
i didn't see a dime of then maybe you should reevaulate who has worked hard
to keep this scen afloat and how it got towhere it is.  Not by people getting
in free but by people supporting the scen so it could expand.really s

Hello,
This is my first time writing and I have alot to say but sometimes you 
know you think about something so much that when the time comes you 
can't seem to get it all out.So here goes my try.  First of all I 
ended up on this keyboard on this night after I stumbled onto some 
mail while working on my next flyer.  I try to work with many people 
and give  everything a chance without being judgemental.  I find it 
hard to point my finger at something and call it bad without getting 
near it first and putting my best effort forward to make things 
positive and enlightning.

It seems that the Global Rythem Movement, a group I have helping me    
try to keep things more organized, also works with alot of people.
They have inadvertentley made it seem as though the people from 
Feelgood entertainment and nexus are one in the same.  There could be 
nothing further from the truth.  Our two events are not the same and 
are not associated with each other.  If you have had the chance to 
come to one of our gatherings you know we give all of our selves up to       
it and really try our best to give everything we have to make new and 
creative things happen that will benifit not just our scene but all 
people. I,m sure we will make some mistakes and I know that we already 
have learned from many, but before you make the mistake of being 
judgemental come and see what we are all about.  If you find things 
you don't like give us advice not isolation.  If you have any comments 
please feel free to send them.  Our web page should be up soon.  Well 
before I fall asleep I guess I'll say goodbye.         
 

                                                 Jeff (nexus)

 How To CCC - real short review of Sat. night's CCC/Goa Gil birthday event,
              plus some comments about access to CCC events

 Sat. Goa Gil Birthday Party: 
 Setting: Very dormlike, in a dorm/co-op called Casa Zimbabwe. Lots
          of colorful dayglo hangings with themes involving Hinduism,
           mandalas, energies, chakras, and aliens. Upstairs was hard
          dance, downstairs was chill & old pop music, courtyard with
          vendors of jewelry, hand-blown pipes, facepainting ( later
          a mini-tank of nitrous in a backpack ).
 Crowd: CCC vets who knew how to behave during the long ( 1/2 to maybe
        1 hour ) ritual section before the drumming ( there was a silent
        period of meditation right around 11:30PM, so if you payed
        your way in at that point and just hung around downstairs, there
        wasn't any music or speechifying ). 
        Non-core CCC folks who go to CCC events but may not have
        expected the extended nature of the opening ritual.
        Folks who were probably at their first CCC event or maybe even
        one of their first raves - participated in the ritual with respect.
        Atheists - went downstairs and hung out in the chill room or the 
        courtyard until the drumming started.
 Ritual: If I was in a better position for sitting on the floor, I would
        have maybe gotten into it more. The extended meditation at the
        end of the ritual was hard on myself, as I had to reach backward 
        to hold the hand of the person to my right, putting a twist 
        on my body tha wasn't working in the long haul. Other parts of
        the ritual involved the visualization of energies without and
        within oneself, breathing, stretching. Sage was burned.
 Music: Great! I liked the drumming portion right after the ritual opening.
        Then Goa Gil started in nice and easy , building up to full up
        trance thumpa-thump. Drummers on the side added an organic 
        element, sometimes in conflict with the DJ over dramatic silences. 
 Crowd Density: Oof! Right at the start of the trance music, too packed on 
     main floor. Got a little better later, as folks left to cool off.
     Courtyard was full of folks. 
 Summary: Good! 


 Attending CCC events - This was the first I heard of this event :

 I did, and was then informed that it was a CCC event with a Goa Gil
birthday included. I was asked to keep it not post it to SFRaves and
to generally keep it quiet.

 Later ( as I understand it from 2nd hand information ), some folks in
CCC decided to make it more publicized to help fill up the venue. It was 
packed, so I guess they were successful! ( left because of personal
atigue and the density of the dancefloor ).

 So, I guess we could keep an eye out for more "goa/psychedelic trance"
postings, which may be CCC events. Or, folks in CCC might be moving
to going towards greater publicity. 

 Just my opinons - Larry Ching/larryc@netcom.com

I'm so sorry the PBS forward continues to appear on these lists. I have 
received a couple messages admonishing me for posting it in the first 
place, and I do not wish to aggravate these people any further.If you 
decide to forward it, please remember to change all of the addresses it 
gets forwarded to.

Someone told me that I was the OLDEST SoCal raver,  but I'm NOT the oldest
SFRaver.    Will Penna got me beat by quite a few years,  but at 53,  I'm
still going strong.   Just ask any SFRaver... :-)

CCC parties have ALWAYS been totally underground,  but they are talked
about AFTER they occur.   YOu're right,   you DO have to know someone
to get into it....  BY the way,  did Goa Gil spin?    I heard his birthday
is coming up...

This weekend I had the chance to go on a retreat with Humboldt State to the 
City of 10,000 Buddhas monastery in Talmadge, which is about 2 hrs north 
of SF (next to Ukiah).
The day started at 3:30 am with morning recitation and meditation, then 
mmmmmmm  good vegetarian all you can eat Chinese food oh it was so good. 
Then we did more meditation, tai chi, ceremonies, ceremonies, ceremonies, 
and rituals, and chanting and eating of wonderful food with kind kind 
people, the day ending at 10:30 at night.
The nuns (not monks because men and women do not interact) were always 
there to answer any of my questions, and went out of their way to see 
that we were able to follow what was happening. They were truly the most 
kind, sincere people I have ever met, and one of the most harmonious 
comunities.A great way to learn about the Mahayana school.
They operate on donations and welcome visitors at any time and love for 
people to come learn about the Dharma. Beautiful!!
drop me a note if you want more info...

     In proper review of the events that led to my non-attendance to 
     Charity, I have come to the following conclusions:
     
        -'Sliders' is a very interesting show.
        -'The X Files' proved to be even better.
        -Just because I unplugged my tv for 1 year and now I have turned it 
     back on doesn't mean I should spend the next year making up for lost 
     tv time.
        -One may find great treasures in a dj that is moving to England's 
     lost record collection.  
        -The **** ******** is near the ******* ****** (oh, why didn't they 
     tell me?)
        
     
     Record of Events
     
     After watching 'Sliders' and 'The X Files', which were both very 
     interesting, i took shuttlecraft 3 through the warp 101 tube toward 
     starbase 22 (in the moonpup system) where i picked up a gem sony 
     receiver and then spent the next hour filing through records trying to 
     find that one song  (you know, that one song that...if i had it...).  
     Actually I found about 10 of them.  Wow, those are 10 good records.  
     Wow, those are 10 good records.  Wow-no, you're not reading the same 
     line over, but my excitement about the records went up incramentally 
     by the minute that I owned them.  
     
     I then left and stopped for late night food.  Why?  Why not.  Then F8 
     was closed when I ddropped by.  A friendly dead head told me that it 
     was at the **** ********* at *** *** ******.   So I drove down there 
     and missed the intersection 4 or 5 times and with all the one-way 
     streets, I got extremely frustrated.  Scanners and navigational 
     sensors were off-line because of the extreme electrical interference 
     in the downtown section.  Shuttlecraft 3's clutch pedal began acting 
     up, causing the gears to grind incessantly.  This proved to be quite 
     annoying, however, since there were no patrol scouts within visual 
     range I decided to set down for the time being.  
     
     I met with 3 shape shifters who told me that there were too many 
     Klingons in there drinking the blood wine.  Actually they were going 
     to reenter the location when Gawron returned.  
     
     Since I had to be in the Arboretum to attend the Farmer's Market the 
     next morning at 0700, i returned to shuttlecraft 3 and sped at warp 
     speed back toward the grounded Crazy Horse, where i listend to my new 
     found finds on my new found receiver unit.  
     
     Definitely next time.

[ to sfraves ]

 Here was the SFR calendar listing for the SAt. CCC event:

 Saturday, October 5th - _The CCC Goes East!_
 All night psychedelic trance.
 Goa Gil, Craig, Neal.
 proceeds will help pay back our Burning Man debt
 415.487.7817

 No mention of "suggested donation" amount, but it was $5 at the door.

 The evening started out as an "ins and outs OK" , but so much people
showed up, it turned into a "No ins or outs" event by 12:30AM. Of
course, folks were hanging around outside, waiting for their chance pay
their way in, or waiting for their friends who were lucky enough to
get in before the new door policy came into effect.

 I don't know what the crowd situation was after I left ( 12:45AM ),
maybe they went back to letting ins and outs when the crowd thinned
out. I remember thinking as I left that maybe a map point would have been
a good idea, except this was no isolated warehouse . There would have
been enough publicity from the residents of Casa Zimbabwe itself, much
less the folks who heard about it from the CCC folks and the SFRaves
calendar listing.

Hey you all...

In blatant disregard for the laws governing the maximum bandwidth
consumable by a given individual within such a short span of time, I'm
posting a review of Sunset... my first Sunset... 

I'd never been before, because I really hate begging for rides, but Pao
offered me a lift at Organic, so how could I refuse?  (Thanks Pao!!!!)
Anyway, it was a lovely warm day, tons of tired smiley faces... I was
really impressed with the number of people who had been to 3 or 4 or more
(!!!) parties over the weekend.  Turned out to be "One of those Weekends"
for a lot of people!

The sunset was kind of anticlimactic (sp?), but very pretty in a calm,
non-dramatic way.  The music was housey again, and again I danced only a
little.  Enough to regret the next day, though - especially after Charity.
So what transpired at Sunset... I was convinced that I made a huge error
in not going to CCC.  The people who attended it were seriously glowing.
Oh well!  Next time.  I finally figured out who Ariel is (hey!)  I ate
more than my share of Melanie's strawberries (*blush*... i couldn't help
myself :)  I sorted out getting Bert (my gingham bunny) back from San
Jose.

But truly, the highlight of my evening (and perhaps my weekend) came when
the DJ who spun the long, beautiful drum&bass set upstairs at Charity
(can't remember his name!!!) gave me the most enormous compliment.  He
told me that my dancing was the reason he spun for so long!  Left me
speechless.  That really, really compounded the idea that there is
feedback between the DJ and the crowd.  If his music hadn't been so
beautiful, I wouldn't have danced as hard, and as it turns out I was also
instrumental in making his music beautful.  Happiness!!!  Joy!!!

Sleep was excellent.  As some of you know, I have to get up really, really
early for work.  The one real bonus of this (it's hard to be full of
positivity at 5:15am, okay?) is that on clear days, I get to see the
sunrise.  And this morning was just gorgeous.  The sky skipped through so
many shades of pre-dawn grey, yellow, orange, and somehow magically
faded into a beautiful clear blue.  A very moving sunrise.

I hope you all have wonderful days!

Charity!  FUCK!  My first and foremost comment is TOO MANY PEOPLE! 
There were certain points during the night when I just felt
assaulted...I was standing in lines of shoving people to get to
doorways to get into a hallway so I could spend 10 minutes squeezing
between people so that I could get into a room that was too hot and
too crowded to dance in!  AARGH!

But, capacity over-filling aside, the party was pretty phat!  Music
was AMAZING on all floors, and although I spent most of my time
downstairs hardstepping, I was all over the place...The trance in the
main room was pretty damn good...Dutch, in particular just RIPPED the
place apart.  Who was it last week who was talking about boiling
frogs?  Um, HELLO?  I have never felt more like a boiling frog then
when Dutch was pounding out semi-evil trance, punching the air, and
there I was with probably 400 other people in the room dancing to
this music in one of the hottest, wettest environments I've ever been
in.  We were boiling frogs!  We were stuck in a Floridian workcamp! 
It was Hades!  I didn't know whether I was having the best time of my
life or whether I was more miserable than I'd ever been...Um, maybe
the whole situation would have been different had I been sober, but
as it was, I just couldn't quite cope.

So, I wandered upstairs.  Granted, it took me 20 minutes to get there
(um, why do people always insist on talking in crowded stairwells?)
but the jungle was GREAT!  When I was there, DJ NICE was spinning,
and it was truly inspired!  I *like* jungle, but that man made me
love it...it seemed much more melodic than usual, easier for me to
dance to...Again, the room was WAY too crowded.  I heard that the
party was set for a max of 800, but that Xfiles and Pacific
overfilled and so Acme's seams were stretched to 1200...is this true?

Finally, after what seemed like a LIFETIME (seriously, in my
altered-state, that party took on EPIC proportions!  I felt like I
had lived in acme for 3 days...and it was only 3:45!) I made my way
downstairs, and was SO PLEASED!  The people downstairs weren't just
going off, they were going off with STYLE!  There was a semi-circle
formed, but it was open to intepretation and SO much fun!  The music
was just GREAT GREAT GREAT!  Can anybody tell me who the dj with the
blue facepaint and shoulder-length brown hair was? His blue-face kind
of scared me but the music??? DAMN!!  Although, as good as he was, I
would have to say that DJ Cloud is my new favorite DJ.  By the time
he started spinning I was EXHAUSTED.  I'd been hardstepping for hours
and my legs were starting to shake from fatigue. But somehow DJ Cloud
(aka Saben?  I think that's it) kept my shit going and going and
going and going...I swear, I reached a point of purpetual motion
where every last part of my body was moving in sync to the
music...YAY! IT WAS SO EXHILARATING!  (er, sp?)  Although, by the
time Timothy and I finally left I was SO SO SO ready to get OUT of
Acme!  The party rocked, but it could have been so much more in a
larger, cleaner, less over-used space.

Oh, and hello to everyone who I saw there...names are escaping me (I
remember Dhiren and David...and other faces but not names...) but
hello anyway!  See you all next weekend!

Ariel

If I was keeping track of things right, the DJ with the facepaint
was Stony (sp?) Someone please correct me if I'm wrong though!

Well,  what can I say.  It was great!  

While I know it was hot and crowded most of the night, it never really
bothered me.  I ws in such a good mood I just accepted the heat and the
press of bodies trying to move every which way. Lots of water and smiling
faces (amoung other things :) kept me going from when I got there at around 
11:00pm till the music stopped in the morning. 

Thanks to all the people that put effort into the party.  That was the best
I personnally have ever seen the ACME look.

Seeing how everyone I usually eat lunch with here at work is either on
vacation or telecommuting today, I figured I'd see if anyone was interested
in meeting somewhere for lunch.

Kind of short notice but.....

Anyway, I work right by Great America.  I can drive 15-20min if anyone is
interested.  Give me a call 408-267-1853.

Wondering what this is about?  Well I had composed a little message asking
if anyone around the Great America area was interested in going to lunch.
And it appears to have become lost somewhere between me typing it and 
arriving in all your in-boxes.  So if your interested give me a call
408-527-1058.
I can drive 15-20min to meet somewhere.

That's Amce.  It sucks in that way, but it's always sucked in that way.

I have to agree, the music rocked in all three rooms all night!

No, not that many in that room...

No fucking way!  Try, like 700 for the whole party (est.).  1200 people in
that space would burst the seams, not that they haven't been stretched
already.  I agree that about 500 people is the max for that place with all
rooms open.  I also feel the promoters need to think about air flow better.
I walked into the mushroom room, and I swear there were mushrooms ready to
sprout from the dripping walls.  I was, quite literally, a sauna in there.

I slid a piece of plywood aside from the cooler open space behind the room,
and then got some people to pull a banner up that was seperating the main
room with the mushroom room and the air cleared very quickly.
Unfortunately, the banner that was then covered was one that they had been
working on all night up to the beginning of the party.  Later I saw it was
down again, most likely at the insistence of the artist.

Fans, airflow, traffic flow (telling people politely that the stairwell is
a BAD place to be), etc. make things much smoother there.  But really, even
with all that in place, Acme was not built as a club, and it shows.

Chin stands corrected...It was Jake.  And it DID rock!

Imagine, Shoam [sp] trading off really fat drum&Bass with [?] up stairs,
Dutch pounding the hot main floor, and Jake making the basement writhe with
dope break-beat.  But it was frustrating at times getting between the
scenes.

The set-up upstairs was beautiful (period) but more for an ambient setting,
people wanted to dance to the all-night jungle, so that made it a bit
crowded.  The sky-holes kept the upstairs reasonably mild.

Tone

P.S.

>Acme!  The party rocked, but it could have been so much more in a
>larger, cleaner, less over-used space.

Baby, you find that space!  =) You make it seem as if the promoters have a
choice of spaces but elect Acme due to, what, nostalgia?

Promoter #1: "You know, this party is going to be phat!  And I woulda had
it in that stylin' big, dope, clean, rarely used place over on Indiana, but
you know, I just have so many memories at Acme, I think I'll have the party
there instead."

Friend of Promoter #1:  "You want another hit of this crack?"

=)  I'm glad you had fun Ariel, despite the heat and crowds...

(Charity, CCC, Sunset)

So many cool things happening last weekend, that I don't know where to
start. But perhaps I'll start from Friday morning: I was walking
towards my office from the parking structure, and as I'm doing so, I
hear the magical sound of a 303 in the distance. Cool, I thought, what
a way to start off my day: acid riffs at Oracle! But as I approached
the 400 building, I realized that the happy chirping off in the
distance was actually the chirping of a bunch of birds (!) - perhaps
my brain really is just tweaked from too much techno :)

Friday night was spent at Charity, which was really cool, but had an
Acme factor of about 9.0. There were soooo many people there that it
was impossible to walk (I can't count how many times I was trapped
upstairs, sandwiched between people trying to walk). And from the
moment I walked in, I was dripping with sweat before even dancing a
step. I was surprised to not see any fans, considering the turnout.
But really that was my only complaint :)

Charity rocked! I actually spent most of my time in the breakbeat room
upstairs. At first, there wasn't enough room to dance (very
frustrating when listening to jungle!), but after the crowd thinned
out a bit, there were a bunch of us getting *down* to some serious
jungle! Rich shaked my body with jungle fever (I suspect he was at
Buggin' Out, too), and you know how much I loooove jungle (we won't go
into details!) :) But Rich is probably one of the best jungle DJ's I've
heard around here. Lots of fun for the whole family :)

Ernie Deaks was, of course, fucking amazing. Every time he spins, he
blows my mind, rocks my world, shakes my booty, etc. That guy has
talent! And such energy: he just gets down and dances the whole time
behind the tables during his set. He has such energy, and he's so into
the music that he plays. I would go anywhere to see him spin, even
MegaGangstaSoopa-Bomb Party XVII or whatever.

I would occasionally check out the downstairs, but for the most part,
the music down there wasn't my cup of tea. I heard some music that
was too housy for my taste.

I caught some of Dutch's set, but after Deaks, my ass had been
kicked so hard that it was time to head back upstairs. As cool as
Dutch may be, I knew I had an entire night of psychedelic trance
waiting for me in Berkeley the next night, so I didn't feel like I
missed anything.

So I made my way upstairs, and spent almost the rest the night
grooving to some funky trip-hop. That Benji guy is one rad mixologist;
any DJ that can throw down Axel F (you know, the one from Beverly
Hills Cop), and mix it in to a trip-hop set... damn! I never
remembered Axel F to be such a good track :) He played such a wide
variety of breakbeat; I hope to see him again sometime.

I spent the last hour of the night pounding myself to some serious
techno downstairs, in keeping with my "dance until they have to scrape
me off the dancefloor" policy :)

The next night, we went to Mike's house to hear Goa Gil :) Seriously,
the CCC party was at Mike's co-op in Berkeley! What could be better?
CCC really throws some great parties. Last time I saw them was at
Burning Man. This was the experience that I've been looking for: very
spiritual, very focused on music and dancing. The fruit-stand factor
was very low that night (okay, raves aren't meat markets, but they
definitely are fruit-stands), and thus there was very little piling
and cuddling 'n stuff. The dance floor was so packed, and everyone was
just going off! But then, how could you not to Goa? The music is so
powerful and so intense.

The night began with a meditation circle and some relaxation
exercises. My body was rather happy to be loose again, especially
after dancing the night before. The meditation quickly transitioned
into a drum circle, led by Goa Gil.

Goa Gil was very interesting. I've never seen a DJ using DAT's before,
but I found it interesting how he was able to create a continuous
stream of sound and smooth transitions without having to mix or
beat-match.  The music was possibly the most intense I've ever heard
(actually, the BM CCC parties were just as intense). There were so
many black lights, day glow banners, day glow clothing and body paint!
I have a permanent glow in the back of my retina.

I had such a wonderful time at CCC. Dancing to Goa is such a spiritual
and peaceful experience for me - as I listen to it, my mind becomes so
settled and my body becomes so loose. And then movements and thoughts
begin flow through me, unobstructed.

About 4pm, I was simply too tired to take it any more, especially
after the previous night of partying (the best compliment came from
Randy at the CCC party when he told me, "I love watching you punish
yourself." Right on!). So I went to Mike's room and slept for a little
while. 

When I woke up, it was the next day (I guess), and we (me, Brendan,
Mike, Wayne, Marcie, and others) spent the day being sticky from sweat
(sorry I soaked two of your shirts, Mike!) and listening to Gabber.
There were defintely some "Hardcore Vibes" in Mike's room ;)

I was actually feeling crazy enough to go to Sunset that day; of
course, not until I did my laundry first. I spent very little time
dancing, but it was a nice chill thing to do to ease myself out of the
phrenetic phun of the weekend... Surprised I didn't see Wayne and
Marcie again!

Anyway, I'm not dead yet, so see you all at Mad tonight!!!

love and sweat,
Steve

Hi there,

I desided to write this now because I'll just get distracted again if I put it 
off. Anyways, hi my name is Nicko and I moved here from Chicago. I know you 
guys might be jealous of Chicago's scene but trust me, up there they are 
jealous of your weather. ;)

Anyways, I'm here in the nice and lovely city of Sacramento and just two 
nights ago I was aproached as I was leaving Faces and asked if I knew where 
the rave party was. I saw that as a sign of many nights oif partying in the 
crazy west side. Now on with the issue at hand.

I have nobody. No, really. I know no one here that raves. And of course I will 
not get up and go wild goose chase at SF without another person with me. So if 
you live in Sacramento, hey drop me a line. 
I am also trying to put a piece together about raves and why they are illegal. 
(because I like to get busted all the damn time). So since I am the Features 
editor of my school's newspaper (ARC) I am trying to get photo's and reviews 
of a party that I would ppreferably like to be there. Now the catch 22 is that 
I would have to be with some of you (Sac area people that are willing to look 
at me sitting with a recorder humming) for the whole day. I want my article to 
have EVERYTHING in a day and night of a party. I even want to take pics while 
you are getting ready etc.

You know I never had the chance to watch that Leesa show but from what I hear 
it was class A potato like everything else in the media about raves. I'm sick 
of that shit quite frankly and finally now I have some power to do something 
and do it right. So let me know people. Private email would be fine or just 
post something to the list.

Peace.

I feel old sometimes, myself. I'm only 21, but now that my life has
become so filled with my career, bills, surviving, etc., that I feel
it's hard to relate to some people who are even 2 or 3 years younger.

However, the coolest thing happened a couple of weekends ago. I had
rode up from San Jose with a friend, and we had some great
conversation, enjoyed some Chai tea together, had some laughs, and so
on. But she's only 16. 16 and in high school, no less. We are worlds
apart. My life is probably more similar to her parents.

During the party we're all the same age: ageless. Just free spirits
floating around. Enjoying life. Being free from the stesses and
obligations from the outside world. Free from politics and social
convention. In effect, we are nothing but pure light and anything that
we choose to bring in.

Leave behind your age, and you are free. Look at Wayne, Marcie,
Leslie; all so far away from high school age. And I can't even begin
to count how many people at Charity work at hi-tech Silicon Valley
companies.

And I have met many people who I thought were high school kids that
are really in there early twenties. You never know.

If you really start to feel old again, just remember to grab your
"bloo balloon" and keep smiling!

Steve

Hi folks! =)

 Well this weekend was pretty busy for me. I voluntered my efforts for 
Charity and had a great time!! For a first time party by the promoter it 
was very well done. (of course the experienced help he recieved couldn't 
have hurt ;) I got there late (9:00 pm) but was ready for the hordes that 
came pouring through the doors. There was a LOT of people there but it 
wasn't as hot and sticky as it was at Greg's B-Day party or at the BP 
house party a few months (?) back. I didn't mind the crowd so much; I 
generally like all the body contact from large friendly crowds

 Dutch was totally out of control! I swear he's not human! He is that 
good. Granted I only caught the first 15-20 minutes of his set, but they 
were probably the best mixed minutes I have ever heard. No flubs, 
everything prefectly blended, and no measure of the music was allowed to 
run too long. Tasty, tasty, tasty.

 So I run over to the CCC warehouse as I hear they could use my help for 
their party. The CCC crew vaguely knew me but made me feel welcome in 
their home. After talking to Sky, we realised how I could help best. I 
drove home thanks to the ever delightful Jess (kisses and thanks Jess!! =)
and showered and changed clothes then went back out to load equipment 
into Jonathen's truck and drove up to Berkley. I napped on the way up so 
I at least had an hour or two of sleep between parties (woof!).
 
 It was really crowded on the main dance floor and a little to hot for 
me; I waited to about 4 or 5am for any serious dancing.

  I must say that the CCC crew is one of the nicest group of people to work 
with!! The best part for me was the meditation circle. Every time I 
closed my eyes (while in the circle) I started to hallucinate wildly. 
Really pretty mandala-like star patterns of all colours. And here I 
hadn't consumed any sacraments! (yet ;). I alsoenjoyed sitting and 
holding hands for 20 minutes! I can't remeber the last time I did almost 
nothing for 20 minutes. Goa Gilwas playing in the drum circle at the 
beggining which felt really good.

 Made some great connections with folks that night. The sweet moment in 
the morning was when Sky came up and payed me for my work. Why? Oh 
because I had volutered my work to CCC that night because I so fully 
support what they are trying to do. Being payed (especially for such an 
inexpensive party!) really put the finishing touches of a near perfect 
night. Every moment I was there felt very appropriate and I was very 
happy to have been part of the entire experience. 

 Overall; A killer weekend!!!!!!!!!!!!  =) =)

oh yea; thanks to Steve and agent 99 for the video projector!!

Peace y'all,


Ran @ Dionysus Dreams

     >>>Charity<<<
     
     Got there with newbie in tow.
     Ouch.  Hot.  Crowded.  Ew...
     
     Lost newbie.
     Vibey.  Positive.  Emptier.
     
     Deaks was bombbbbbbbbb.
     Dutch was bombbbbbbbbb >that was Dutch right?<.
     (If I ever spin, I will get a five letter name that starts with D.  I 
     think I notice a pattern).
     
     Had some epic conversation.
     
     Met some beautiful souls.
     
     Hello all you people!
     
     Felt like a wet dog in the morning air.  Looked like wet dog in the 
     morning air.  Probably smelled like... ahh.... whaaa!
     
     Felt almost not guilty for having so much fun after helping move the 
     basement sound system upstairs @ 10:00am.
     
     >>>CCC<<<
     
     Got there really late, maybe 2:00ish.
     
     Met more new people.
     
     Strange blend of Berkeley students, happy ravers, and CCC people (from 
     what I gather).  Really turbulent energy when I first got there.
     
     Tried Chillum thingy...BOOM!... *thankyou* (sorry I forgot your 
     name).. 
     
     Couldn't keep up with Goa Gil.  Well, I really tried for an hour or 
     two.  Wasn't impossible, it just hurt after Charity.
     
     Dug the Gaian Mind thing (totally sober, and I almost started 
     drooling).  Visuals... eik!
     
     Got totally jealous of the Jacuzzi People (people live here... where 
     do I sign!?).
     
     Beautiful view of SF from across the bay.
     
     Spontaneous dancing with JohnK under the stars (Orion was so prominent 
     from the patio!!!).  Fuckin inspired.
     
     Amazing trip hop downstairs.
     
     Blacklight Blacklight Blacklight!
     
     Couple Giggolo ravers (apparently with corporate sponsorship from 
     Adidas, as their logo was all over them) looked so classic with their 
     bee'atches on the love seat, wearing their sunglasses, looking cool.  
     They matched too...  I won't start... Same planet, different worlds.  
     I'm so glad we all love this as much as we do!
     
     The energy was there... amazing.  Really diverse crowd, took a while 
     to get used to but it WAS so worth settling into.
     
     Peace peace peace

That was one of the best moments at Charity - trying to fall asleep on one
of the mattresses that I was sharing with 5-6 other people, kind of dozing
off and hearing that song and just having the hugest grin on my face -
needless to say I woke up that moment and had to sit up and start
dancing....  It was so unexpected and it just sounded so great :)

As of Acme - yes, it was hot, and yes it was crowded, but the party was
still great.  For me Acme has a special place in my heart (I went to my
first rave there - in February), so maybe I don't mind it as much as other
people.  It would have been better if there were not that many ppl there
(the stairs were hell for the first part of the night).

I haven't met that many people - I saw few that I knew, talked to few
(people liked my fuzzy shirt - glue-gunned pom-poms (SP???) and a lot of
people talked to me because of that) - what an attention - I really didn't
expect that...  Now, I know what to wear if I want to meet a lot of people.

Organic was fun, although I had too much beer :( and was dead for the rest
of the weekend.  I missed Sunset again, because I was catching up on my
sleep (which is not bad, considering that work will be hell for few more
weeks).

Hugz and hope to meet more SFRavers soon,
Branka

Hey everyone!

	My name is Jason and I will be visiting SF this next weekend
11th-13th, with the posibility of a move to the San Jose area in the
near future...

Anyways, I noticed there are quite a few events going on this weekend
and I'm sure I'll be going to at least one of them.  I was wondering
if someone could point me in the right direction as far as music
is concerned.  I like HARD acid trance, Happy hardcore, and maybe even
a little gabber.  What's the main music played in the SF area?  If
one of these events is going to be primarily trance related could you
tell me which one?

Many Thanks, PLUR

Actually you both win the boobie prize.  It's Jake (aka Jacob) aka DJ 
Stonie.  As far as I know Jake still likes to go by dj stonie.  he'll be 
spinning at our campout this weekend.

Thanks everyone who showed up and proved that co-ops can do more than toss
around "college parties." The people really respected CZ and CCC and the
vibe. ('cept for all that NO2!) Goa Gil tore my brain to shreds time and
time again... Setup with the CCC people was a blast (they're so nice!) and
their morning torch spinning was beautiful; sunrise was a quiet moment of
reflection on the roof, before dancing like a maniac to the last couple
hours of Gil's set.

Sunday morning: Gil's set ended at almost 10am (!) and CCC had their shit
packed up by noon... unbelievable how together these kids are! surprisingly
little trash in my backyard; nice to know the no alcohol policy kept that
down. A little jarring to see my dining room back to normal after such an
INTENSE night.

hello: flea =), hairgoop99, wayne, marcy, greg, nancy, tom, larry, andy,
tony, and all the other netnerds who made it out the other night. I'm still
recovering. =)

smiles to all,
-m.

PS kicking myself in the ass for missing charity. =(

how long did it take before they started letting people back in?  i got
there around 11:30 and they had stopped letting folks due to being
over capacity :(  i'd also like more info about the CCC.

I have been coerced by the lovely and charming Diana Greer to attend
dinner and Mad tonight, despite my better judgement (and plans to
unpack and clean my room). So I hope to see some of you tonight (and
that means you, Mr. Matt Lanier!) for a fine evening of dinner and
dancing.

And as long as I'm wasting company time, does anyone know the latest
word about Mantra? Is it coming back or not?

 The latest word I have is that Dutch is trying to get a possible monthly 
thing going (with help from Dionysus Dreams potentially =) so he is still 
trying to put it together. Stay tuned for further developments!

 Hey everyone!
 
 After more than a month of computerless, e-mailless college life I'm back.
 I
 missed you guys and gals so much!!  I know I never contributed much and some
 of you may never remember me but I always thought of you all as my extended
 family, most of whom I've never met.  I hope to change that soon.  Sorry to
 waste the bandwidth on this message but I just wanted to let you all know I
 LOVE YOU ALL!!
 
 Love,
               Megan              Czefir
 
 p.s.   anyone who joined the list in the last month?  It would be nice if
you
 introduced yourself to me since I'm sure I've missed a bunch.

I was driving passed a place that was 15,000 sf space for lease. It looked like
it use to be some kind of retail store maybe. The question I put in front of
you is this....

What's there to stop someone from getting it, having it open during the
weekdays as a place to goto buy/sell/trade records and DJ tapes and demos, a
drop off place for flyers. You can also have DJs come in to make tapes. People
that want to learn or practice spinning can come in if they have nowhere to go
or don't even have turntables. Hell, a place to try out your new dance moves
for that matter. A totally legal place to do all the above, but only using half
of the entire place with the other half blocked off or used for minor storage
or something. Then maybe one day every weekend or maybe even just once a month
in the other half roughly 7-10,000sf have a party. It would be consider a
private party where the "customer/clients" of this store is showing off there
talents by performing( spinning/lasers/visuals/dance moves). It would be a
record/DJ equipment and lighting/dance studio store.

Can all that happen and if so do you know any of the loop holes it would create
or am I just wishful thinking.

Dear Friends & Family,

	I just learned that Libertarian Party Presidential candidate Harry
Browne is on KSFO (AM 560) as I type this message.
	Anyone interested in hearing the candidate of the largest party
kept out of the Presidential debates by the Democrats/Republicans, and
incidentally the party that would give us freedom to rave without being
harrassed as we are now, tune in & turn on!

Yours in liberty,

Hey people my friend Noel is looking for some kind roomies, here she is:

stuff about me:
I'm a girl, age 26. I'm looking for a room to rent in San Francisco from
now til the end of February. I've lived in the East Bay for three years but
I work in SF and I'm tired of commuting to work. I like to go to parties
and dance the night away, but at home I'm chill and hang out reading or
drawing.I work 9-5. I'm reliable for paying the bills and taking care of
the place.

 Please page me if you have a room open:   415-232-4064

 Hi everyone in Santrancisco,

As a person who attends CCC parties on a regular basis. At first I really
loved the small and intense vibe and still do. However the larger ones like
the one that took place this weekend has alot more rewards. For instance
there was alot of people who have never been to a party like this, let alone
alot of people who never meditated once in their life, this party affected
alot of people in a positive way. There will still be alot of small parties
but I believe you are about to see larger parties being put on, and that
dosent meen it is less underground it meens turning on and tuning in.

Bom Shankar

Flipped his lid

P.S. most people call it psychedelic trance not Goa, mainly because it is
such a global scene now and expanding everyday.It is also in its nature to
always change and advance with time if you heard the music in the 80's they
were playing industrial and such, at one time it was even acid house. The
music just keeps getting better and better wait till you here the next wave
of music just blinding and even more diverse.

I was wondering if some of you who have put out a mix tape could give me 
some pointers. 

-What did you record the master on? 
-Where did you get it dubbed? 
-What are the prices (generally) for those generic blank tapes. 
-Where can you get covers printed and how much does it cost ( the 
printing, not the are)?

any help would be appreciated.
-peace!-

Actually, Perot's party is the largest "third party" being shut out of the
debates, garnering 15% of the popular vote in 1992. I wish that the Perot,
Libertarian, Green and any other party that wished could be allowed to
debate the "popular candidates." There would be a lot more lively debate
for sure.

It's really two bad that the two-party system is so self-preserving that it
actually could influence a decision to bar opposing parties from a
free-speech debate.

Unfortunately, the "popular" candidates will do very little for us if/when
elected. So vote for anarchy in '96. :-)

I haven't had a chance to read the reviews, so advance apologies if this 
treks over old ground!

Friday night I missed Charity because of a drunken night at a 
friend's (who's "on the list"!) housewarming party (My, El Cerrito is 
LOVELY!). Well, drunk and stoned at 2AM is NOT the time to drive over to the city, 
even for an event like Charity.  But back 
here, several SFRavers mingled among the crowd, and it was really nice to 
see people I know mainly through "partying" in a different context, which 
completely foreshadowed...

CCC!

Saturday night in Berkeley, and I was making my usual rounds of the co-op 
parties. See, almost every weekend you can find _something_ happening in 
the co-ops, and word spread that there was a "CZ party" - meaning, 
usually, a drunken/drug bash with bands or a dj, and a lot of 
alterna-Berkeleyites.  So, first I drank at home, then to another co-op 
for a truly wild "progressive" (drinks in every room), and then, 
stumbling, to CZ.

Here my two worlds - the self-contained universe of Berkeley and the 
underground life of raving - collided.  Earlier I couldn't fathom a 
"rave" at CZ, that gargantuan concrete structure housing 130 students 
that I called home two years ago, and that now houses SFR'er Mike 
Magurski and raveling Kenny (among others!). I approached the 
too-familiar behemoth only to find throngs of RAVERS!  It was midnight 
and everyone was being turned away - CZ had reached capacity.  The ravers 
- and, it seems, earlybird college students - had come.

We kicked it down the block for about an hour; my insane curiousity about 
the spectacle of a rave at CZ wouldn't allow me to leave.  At one we made 
it in...

I thought it would be impossible to transform the truly-ugly Casa 
Zimbabwe.  But CCC, with love, and effort, and a faBU collection of 
tapestries, made it happen.  This was BEAUTIFUL!!  Upstairs, in the  
grungy dining room where I had consumed too many midnight nachos, 
hundreds of people decked out in partygear went wild.  Goa Gil was 
AMAZING!!!  The sound, the people, the decorations... the magic of the 
ritual managed to transcend the ordinariness of the space.

But, like a wrinkle in the universe, my usual Berkeley world was 
impinging on the alternate reality of the rave.  Buzzed on alcohol, too 
tired to really dance, and unable to shake the image of the _real_ CZ, I 
jsut couldn't float on my usual journey into a rave wonderland.  Like a 
typical Berkeley Saturday night, I made my way home at three, hours earlier 
than I would ever normally return from such an amazing party.   

I am eagerly awaiting the next CCC party - and the next appearance of Goa 
Gil!! But I have to hope, far away from my normal life!

:)
Nancy

Greetings 
I read this book by a Swiss writer named Erich Von Daniken when I was 
still in the ninth grade named Chariots of the Gods. It has elaborate 
theories on why all life on earth is actually descended from aliens. 
thebook was quite interesting to me at the time. This was before a 
barrage of critical thinking/logic/communication classes that I've taken 
since. I'm curious if any of you out there have read this book and what 
you think of it. I plan to read this book again and come to some 
conclusions. All the reviews that I've read on the net (using Yahoo with 
the authors name) have completely ripped the theory to shreds and 
questioned the integrity of the author. I would be curious to see what 
the erudite subscribers of sfraves have to add about the book or any 
similar theories. Please send me mail privately should any of you deem 
this a waste of that important resource... bandwidth. 
Thank you all for listening
Until we meet again
Love and Peace
Dhiren

The site was the Subud center in Soquel.  Subud is not exactly a religion
but more an approach to spirituality that is open to all creeds.  The
Soquel center has been the location for half a dozen or so raves that I
know of in the past year.  It's a great space, though not large.

Me!  I wasn't planning on going out that evening, but when I figured out
that tthe spot was just down the road...well, why not?  I was there, though
not til shortly before Ethan's set, which I liked best.

So what about this SB event on the 12th that you're supposed to tell us
about?  You do recall, of course, from your previous message:

Dear Wayne & Friends & Family,

My computer tells me that on Mon, 7 Oct 1996, Wayne Correia shared:

	I think this is a popular misconception, due to the fact that
Perot and the Reform Party get a lot more mainstream press than the
Libertarian Party does.
	It is true that Ross Perot got 19% of the Presidential vote in
1992, compared to I think like 1% for Andre Marrou, the Libertarian Party
candidate that year (partly thanks to Perot's inclusion and Marrou's
exclusion from the 1992 Presidential debates).
	However, the Libertarian Party has more registered voters, more
elected officials (several hundred minor officeholders across the country)
and is more organized nationwide (this year we beat the Reform Party in
getting 50-state ballot status for our Presidential nominee, and did it
with less money) than any party in the U.S. other than the Republicans and
Democrats.
	Ross Perot and his billions is the driving force behind the Reform
Party -- by contrast, the Libertarian Party is based on a philosophy, and
is not dependent for its success on any one individual.
	Now that Perot has also been shut out of the debates this year, I
don't think he will get anywhere near the 19% of the vote he got in '92.
I'll be surprised if he gets 5%, and I think between now and 2000, we will
see the Reform Party splinter as his star fades.

	What I think is particularly telling for the future is that the
Internet is disproportionately full of libertarians.  In several online
polls, Harry Browne has outpolled *all* the other candidates, including
Dole and Clinton, leading one source to dub him "The President of
Cyberspace."
	Browne's running mate, Jo Jorgensen, is a thirty-something CEO of
a software company, and a very cool woman too I might add.
	I can certainly understand Wayne's reasons for not voting, if
that's what he meant by "vote anarchy."  However I think it is a mistake
to only vote for a candidate you think has a chance of winning -- some
of those who have little chance of winning are candidates worth voting
for -- like when Jello Biafra ran for mayor of San Francisco.  8)
	The Libertarian Party gets most of its publicity from small
papers, talk radio, word of mouth, etc.  Network TV and the "opinion
leader" papers like the New York Times and Washington Post tend to ignore
us, which perhaps is not surprising in view of how out of touch they are.  
	As Las Vegas Review-Journal columnist Vin Suprynowicz put it,
"America has a third party -- why weren't you told?"

For liberty,

Well, because of meeting so many cool people I wanted to let you get to 
know me a little.

I had my bio and web page laying around but I just never put it up....now 
I have.
I appreciate all who responded publicly and privately to me when I posted 
for the first time.

If you want to catch a peek at who I am and what I do, visit my personal 
web page.

http://members.aol.com/digumo/

If you like the logo, invite me to a get together...make sure that I go 
(and stop working so much) and I'll whip one up for your web page.

Sorry to the guys but I have to do this one....If you're female, in the 
Bay area and single, and want to see a cool picture (not what you are 
thinking it is!) I have one on of me on the page! (Hey....wouldn't you 
mention it too if you were a single "and date-seeking" guy?)....flames 
about this are welcome (but won't be responded to) because even if you 
flame me it doesn't change the fact that I'm out there looking! :-) 
Rave-ya-later!

Sincerely,

Matt "Digumo"

This evening,  I finally finished the final mix of the Crunchman Goa tape.
Tommorrow, I design the J card....

My problem is that Don't have the up-front cash to duplicate the tape,
but I'm now collecting money from those that want the first run of copies.

I listened to it this evening,  and could not tell when the mixing takes
place,  so thats a good sign I think you'll like it.    I played a few
excellent Goa favorites,  but stuck to some new stuff I haven't heard
other DJ's play..  It's mastered on Cassette,  unfortunately,  I could not
obtain empty DAT's here.   Perhaps next tape...  The recording quality is
excellent.

For those wanting a copy,   please send $10 to.....

John Draper

San Diego,  CA  92101

When I get enough money to cover the duplication costs,   I'll send it
in for duplication,  and about a week later will have the tapes....
PLEASE include your Email address on the check.  It will make my life
easier in case I have to return your check if I don't have enough
orders.

Please Email me after you send in your money,  so I'll know to be expecting
it.    Now..... perhaps I won't mind paying my way into raves,  if I have
any money left over.    I have to get at least 8 orders to pay for the setup
fees.   If I don't get enough orders to cover the charges,  I'll send the
checks back.

As soon as I can get into my WEB site,   I'll put up the details on my
home page....

Actually, at this point, it's a one party system. The only people taking Dole
at all seriously are the abortion-over-my-dead-body-shit-fer-brains-christians
and the i-have-tons-of-money-that-i-earned-the-old-fashioned-way-by-fraud-and-
graft-and-wish-we-could-reestablish-slavery-ahh-the-good-old-days. Oh, and 
don't forget the I'm-a-lame-corporate-peon-that-earns-$20K-a-year-but-i'm-
gonna-work-myself-outta-the-mailroom-and-become-somebody-oneday-and-my-boss-
told-me-the-only-way-that'll-happen-is-if-i-vote-republican-so-i-am. That's 
about the extent of the republican constituency.

Casting aside the aforementioned lamos, who are clearly a minority of the
USA populace (see, I can be positive! :-)), we're left with Clinton
taking the rest of the votes.  Or at least that's why they're planning to
offer you a candidate that isn't really much different from a republican.
The new kindler-gentler fascism they're planning to offer works best
when you don't have a choice but to fall in line behind the leaders.

But you can stop this plan dead in it's tracks. WRITE IN RALPH NADER OF
THE GREEN PARTY. They didn't even allow him to be on the ballot in a
number of states, so you may actually have to write him in. The point
is that you can say FUCK YOU to this joke "one party plus a senile
codger's swan song" version of politikkks and give 'em a real idea of
what representative democracy is supposed to be about.  It may not
matter for this election, but when 10% of the vote gets eaten up by
Perot, 10% by the green party, and 10% by the libertarians, perhaps
they'll have to re-think USA's political in-joke for '2000. At this
point, even most european parliamentary systems are more democratic
than the USA. In most of these systems, there is a broad-spectrum 
representation of the people's will in Parliament -- Labor, Socialist,
Peace&Freedom, Green, Christian, Fascist, and other parties having some
amount of representation within Parliament -- even if they're not a
majority. Meanwhile, back at the ranch, it's republicans and democrats
ONLY in congress, in the senate, in the supreme court, and in the white
house.

Now that we essentially have a one-party-system, please note that
they'll be preening Al "I'll-escrow-your-cryptographic-keys-in-my-bunghole" 
Gore to be president  in 2000. After all, who really needs freedom of 
speech, the right to peacable assembly, and protection against illegal 
search and seizure in cyberspace when there's TERRORISTS and DRUG
DEALERS  planning on stealing the pink flamingos from Amerikkka's
family lawn!  (I don't know about you, but I worry more about the
wrong-doings of the right-thinkers of US Government than I ever do
about terrorists and drug dealers.) Oh... and does anybody remember
Tipper Gore's "rock and roll obscenity hearings??" 

Please think of your future when voting in '96, because if you don't
send a  message NOW you may never have a chance to send a message
again. The way things are going now, in the year 2000, they may not
allow any 3rd party candidates to even run, be on ballots, be written
in, or to campaign. After 40 years of harping on the communists for not
allowing free elections (because they're essentially one party
elections) we seem to be heading in that direction ourselves. Democracy
my ass.

hi,
I'm in the market for a couple of mix tapes, maybe some Goa, and something more
varied, techno-like maybe mixed with other stuff.  Any recommendations as
to good dj's/tape-titles would be helpful.  mostly what i have now is from
the Wicked boys, and sounding a little dated.
thanks,
Bruce

It doesn't matter much how we all vote (for President, that is) becuase
even if 80% of the people in the USA voted for the Libertarian candidate,
the Electoral College will most likely vote for Clinton anyway.

     Does anyone have a number for the Dept that supposedly disqualified 
     Perot from attending the debates?  This is an outrage.  Obviously 
     someone's afraid of him getting elected.  But whether or not you 
     support him, he should be allowed to stand up and debate with them, 
     shouldn't he?

Actually, Perot's party is the largest "third party" being shut out of the 
debates, garnering 15% of the popular vote in 1992. I wish that the Perot, 
Libertarian, Green and any other party that wished could be allowed to 
debate the "popular candidates." There would be a lot more lively debate 
for sure.
     
It's really two bad that the two-party system is so self-preserving that it 
actually could influence a decision to bar opposing parties from a 
free-speech debate.
     
Unfortunately, the "popular" candidates will do very little for us if/when 
elected. So vote for anarchy in '96. :-)

Hello all :) One of my good friends has departed for sf, thanks to his
new job. His name is James Cooper aka Pixel and he's a great breaks/
trance dj. He just left Columbia, Missouri, so he should be loving
the west coast right about now. If anyone meets him, give him a real
big hug :)

Missouri still sucks. I'm stuck at school :(

	Well, not really... Perot was averaging about 2% in recent polls,
which makes it hard to justify that he deserves to be in the debates,
whose rules require that a candidate "have a reasonable chance to be
elected" before s/he is allowed to participate in the debates.  In 1992,
Perot's chances were much higher--he garnered 19% of the vote
nationally--and so back then he was allowed to participate in the debates.
        This time, Perot has made the compelling argument that the debates
should be seen as a means to having "a reasonable chance of getting
elected"--i.e., maybe I'm getting only 2% now, Perot said, but if I could
debate the two big guys then maybe I could have a reasonable shot of
getting elected.  This makes sense, but by that line of reasoning, then
the debate commision would have to let all sorts of wacky candidates in,
and the number of participants would make the event cease to be a debate.
Then again, that might not be a bad thing, but it wouldn't be too
practical.

cheers
Timothy

I think the Tuesday night gig was at the Up and Down club.  She spun in
the "UP" room every week.  It was about three weeks ago that I was at the
Up and Down club, so things may have changed.

She also seems to be a consort of the Braun Fellini's.  I've seen
the names together frequently, and thought I read something about that,
too.  But, that's just my observations.

Huh? It's a *two*-party system? And here I thought the Republican
party just had two candidates this year. :)

void soapbox(void) {

The only reason I'm voting this year is because I would feel guilty if
I didn't. I heard on an NPR radio show last night that Clinton is
proposing *uniforms* in public schools and *curfews* as an effort to
"improve" our nation's youth (WTF??!!). Sounds pretty Nazi to me.

Not really trying to start a political battle here, but it seems that
both major candidates are in a race to see who can turn the US into a
police state the quickest.

I'm not voting for either of those losers. They don't need my pathetic
vote, anyway. I'm going to research the candidates running in the
"third-parties" and hope that one of them sounds okay. They need my
support (and yours).

Don't waste your vote ("I guess I'll just vote for Clinton so that
Dole won't get elected"). Support third parties and someday, maybe
there'll actually be a choice in US politics.

return();

}

hugz from the flea,
Steve

plus, when perot was campaigning for his party nomination, he refused to
have a debate with another candidate for the party nomination. could perot
be so hypocritical to demand that he be allowed to debate when he doesn't
have a chance of winning when he refused the same priviledge to a fellow

Rhea,

Keep your eyes peeled for 2nd Chakra, thrown by Nexus, Saturday November
9th.  Charlotte's on the line-up.  Preliminary flyers are out now; full
flyers should be out next week.  I've never heard her play, but I'm looking
forward to it.  There ain't enough women working the turntables these
days  :o(

     perhaps focusing on debating with other candidates was not what he 
     wanted to do during that time, rather focus on laying down what his 
     issues were.

was fantasy island anyway, I drove by and it didn't look like it was too busy.
If you rate parties by the size of the flyer, this one wouldn't even pass
go. It looks like it'd be a cool video game though.

if you rate flyers though it's pretty good. it's large, die-cut, anime and
has a place on my wall. there sure are a shit load of them floating around
the bay area though...

yeah, i noticed that to. if you wanted to go for the title of "east bay
area's #1 dj" ...well you may have to have a few words with ethan about
that. but "bay area's #1 dj" ? what the fuck ?

Charlotte has been the Broun Fellinis' regular in-between-sets DJ for quite
a while now, check them out at the Elbo Room (17th & Valencia) sometime.
She also usually is doing one or more mid-week things in the various
clubs around town.  I'd rank her as one of the best and most underappreciated
DJs in the Bay Area, but then again, I'm biased as a friend :-)

She doesn't just do downtempo stuff, either -- I heard her do really good
house at the Top last fall when the Hardkisses were doing their Friday night
thing there.

Remember that flyer size is usually inversely proportional to party quality

A few possibly descriptive words for this party: suburban, circle dancing,
sportswear.

This party is being promoted by the "6 in da mornin" crew. I saw some of
them on haight street a couple weeks ago. They were a sad lot -- two gold
hoops in each ear, gold chains, wearing nothing but a bunch of sportswear,
having a posturing attitude, looked pretty young and full of themselves.
They were thrusting their flyers in the faces of young (high school) girls.
It was funny how the girls fended off the flyers and promoters over and
over... it was really quite a sight to see.

If you were from their clique (maybe you dress/look like that and live in
say, Fremont or Concord :-) ), you'd think they were hot stuff I guess, but
they just looked like bad vibes all over to me...

This is so rediculous I cannot even comment.

This whole "suburban sportswear rave" scene just reeks of burbs-livin'
white boys who watch way too much "Yo MTV Raps." Not much old school spirit
there, unless you count break dancing. :-)

Hey all!

Had my first official car accident last night, and I definitely feel
grateful that as many things went well as they did.  Had it coming back from
Monday Nite Dinner, just crossed the bridge in to the oakland area, when I
came to that section after the bridge where they start coning off the lanes
to do road work.  Everybody ahead of me suddenly started braking cuz I think
they coned off more lanes than people thought they were gonna (because there
wasn't any traffic backup before that, I assumed [incorrectly] that they had
only shut down one lane, cuz the traffic should have been way worse had they
shut down 2-3, right? Wrong!)  Anyway, everybody realizes simultaneously
that more than one lane is coned off, and they all suddenly start braking,
and so the guy in front of me slams on his brakes, and of coure I must
follow suit or plow into his rear end.  Unfortunately, not enough room cuz
we were all braking so quickly!  So my brakes lock up & I slide right into
him, and again unfortunately, he was driving one of those trucks whose
bumper is elevated higher than the usual car, so rather than just hit up
against his bumper, I slide under it and his bumper peels over my hood like
a sardine can opener!  My poor hood really does look like it lost a battle
with a can opener, very strange looking.  So when I hit him, the chain
reaction goes on down the line, and I hear a couple more crashes behind me,
and I just figure I'd been hit from behind too, altho it turns out they
manged to miss me (you'd think I could tell whether or not I'd been hit from
behind, but in all the hullaballoo, I couldn't tell until I'd gotten out and
looked at the back).  So any of you driving across the bay bridge towards
oakland at about 11 pm last night who saw a string of accident cars along
the side of the freeway, that was me! :P   And again, I am thankful of
everything that managed to not happen.  There were injuries in the cars
behind us, but luckily none of them had run into me, thus avoiding possible
further injury to me and them, and it also served to make things way less
complicated for me, as having a combination accident where I rear end
somebody and simultaneously get rear-ended would make for one helluva
insurance nightmare for everybody.  Also, it turns out that I had just
gotten around to registering my car, which had expired back in May, and I
only got around to it in the past couple of weeks or so!  My insurance was
in order, my license was just renewed, everything (oddly enough) was in
order.  I had not drunk anything at all at Monday Nite Dinner, I was not
driving back after having been fucked up at a rave and awake all night, all
these things could have made things waaaay worse for me and anybody else
involved.  Nobody in our accident was injured (aside from a couple sore
muscles in my neck), the guy I hit was very nice, the cops were amazingly
nice :), so all in all, aside from the accident itself, everything went as
well as it possibly could have.  And I'm grateful to be alive! :)  



Love,
Shawna

Do any of these people who wear sportswear actually participate in sports?
Perhaps we should require them to. ;)

I wouldn't be surprised if I went over to my local Concord mall (just down
the street!) and found flyers in the stores there, much like I did with the
Lucky Charms party.  (I was amused but saddened when I went to my co-workers
house for dinner, and I got into a conversation with her 15-year old
daughter about raves, and she hops up and says "wait a minute!", runs to her
room, and runs back with the Famed Lucky Charms Flyer [xlr8r: "We are SO
over cereal box flyers!"] in hand!  This is pretty much what she assumed
rave parties were about, and she had indeed gotten it at the mall, and had a
hard time convincing her to look beyond that.)

Hey that look is DA SHIT! ;)  Or so I was told by my brother when I asked
him why he dressed like that...

Yes, it's way better to wear something like strange nylon shirts with weird
little televisions picked up in new york, along with black vinyl pants and
black patent airwalks perhaps...  ;);)  Wayne's rave gear is "da shit" ("da
bomb" even!), follow his lead & you'll all be way cool hip ravers! ;)
(wayne, didja notice they now have the shiny black airwalks with the little
hologram bits in 'em now? gotsta get me sum! :)

Test'; I haven't heard this one yet ( but, I don't think that I would be
disapointed). Both are probaly still at Ameba=).

Hi Paul,

I don't know what kind of music you like but here are some of my
favorites (Title - Artist, Type of Music):

Loose Caboose - New DJ Dan continuous mix funky breakbeat deep house CD.
Contains among others: Fat Boy Slim "Everybody Needs a 303", 
Electroliners "Loose Caboose", Electroliners "Crazy Train", Simon 
Pearson "Two Crates Original Mix".

Clandestine Electronic Subculture - Symbiosis continuous mix trancey
breakbeats CD. Contains all original tracks.

Hunab Ku - Time Shard compilation funky trance and jungle CD. Contains
all original tracks.

Amrita - Loop Guru compilation world fusion funky jungle trance CD.
Contains all original tracks.

I tried my best to categorize these CDs but as you can tell they can't
really be pigeon holed into one type of underground music which is why
I like them so much. You can listen to all of these CDs before you 
buy them if you can get to any of the following record stores, all
are listed in 411:

Soundworks, SF
Tweekin, SF
Solid Grooves, SJ

Peace,
John

	BEFORE all you guys start going off on Ground Zero being "another
	gangsta fest" why don't you just relax, ckeck it out for the music
	and create your own vibe....and stop bitching.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

	Liquid and I went to Fantasy Island, just the 2 of us, and had a
	kick ass time.  Yeah we saw the flyer, yeah lots of you thought it to
	be just another "gangsta fest", yeah they didn't post the 
	directions till hella late, but you wanna know something...that
	IS NOT what makes a RAVE.  

	The music @ Fantasy Island was pretty phat, right from the start, 
	and that IS something that makes a rave.  We came with good spirits
	and with hopes of meeting up with some of our friends, so we had a good
	vibe and did run into some people we knew...again, what also MAKES
	a RAVE.  Lots of raves are not easy to find...um hello...isn't that
	part of going to a rave.  I mean if you want something "easy" to find 
	go to club!

	Anyhow, I have said my piece...sorry if I offended *anyone*

        I've been hearing all kind sof complaints about massives and
specifically, Ground Zero.  I'm not going to condemn anyone's point of
view.  You all have the right to rip on GZ as much as you please.
Personally, I like to keep an open mind towards all raves.  There are
massives that are great and intimate raves that suck.  I think that they
quality of of raves should be accorded to its music.  MegaBuzzOne was one
hell of a massive.  There were plenty of gangsters
but the music was as phat as phat could be.  When I close my eyes and start
shakin my ass, I couldn't give a damn about gangsters or location or
anything.
        Since everyone has the right to their own opinion, I'm not going to
make this some passionate defense of massives.  Of course, there are plenty
of massives that suck.  I'm just saying that I personally like to keep an
open mind towards all raves.  If the djs look great and the price is
reasonable, I go
whether its in a 10 people in a back alley or with 5,000 people in a stadium.
        I prefer smaller events but the mere size will usually not turn me away.

Friends,

Aren't warm nights the BOMB?  I love warm nights!!!!!!!!!!  I don't know
exactly what it is about warn nights that make me feel this way, but all I do
know is I feel so alive, and vibrant!  I'm always excited and filled with so
much energy that if I don't tackle some sort of project, or do something
vigorous to expend that energy I will just explode (BOOM)!!!!!  And then when
you compound that upon the fact that this time of year the weather is
supposed to be getting a little cooler; instead we are experiencing a little
Indian summer!  How great is that?

The last couple of days or so have been great!  In order to cool my nerves a
little, and release some of my overflowing energy waves that have turned my
body into a Steve Simitiz prone dancing to Jungle!   I'm sending out all the
positive energy I have to all my SFRAVERS on this and any list they may be
on!  Lord knows that I already have enough energy as it is, and I don't need
any of this extra energy generated by these warm evenings that we have been
experiencing over the past couple of days, so I want all of you to have it!
 So take and do something positive with!  Lord knows that this world could
use a little positive energy now and then!

Your Friend,

I'm sorry for bringing this onto the list, but I had no choice.
I have managed to locate a few copies of "Acid Rain over Goa",
and they are on their way over from Sweden as we speak. However,
there were not enough copies to make everyone happy. Therefore,
I had to do it on a first come, first serve basis. If anyone
else DESPERATELY wants a copy, please email me and we'll talk
about it, k? ;)

Last but not least, sorry for not getting back to you all sooner.

reespect, jonas

Dear Friends & Family,

	I must say, even though I don't doubt that the Lucky Charms party
left much to be desired (can't say for sure, I didn't go), I absolutely
loved the flyer.  In fact, it is still up on my wall.
	XLR8R may be "over" cereal box take-offs; I'm not.  A cleverly
done rip-off of a corporate logo for the purpose of promoting a party
where people will be grooving till 6am on who knows what pills, and
generally doing things most corporate types couldn't relate to, is funny!
	It's social satire of a fine nature, just like the "McSatan's" and
"Submit" (Subway) logos at Burning Man... and the wonderful surreality of
seeing two of the huge chef-hatted dog heads from the old Doggy Diner
chain sitting out in the desert.
	I like a flyer that makes me smile, and I've also come to believe
that artistic appropriation of intellectual property should be allowed --
as long as it's not to make a profit at the owners' expense by selling a
competing product or something.
	In a society overburdened by commercialization, brand names,
status symbols, corporate logos and slogans, humor is one of the few
effective weapons at our disposal to try to improve this sorry situation
and get lawyers, marketing folks, CEOs and others to take themselves a
little less seriously.  
	
Just do it,    ;)

One of the most important things that "makes a rave" for me is a group that
is intent on positivity. And you just don't get that from a bunch of
frontin' sportswear gansta kids.

If the music is great, that is another key ingredient, but it alone will
never make a good party.

I hope it turns out OK, but, as in the past, the attitude on the flyer sets
the stage for the attitude of the party.

And remember, suburban is not necessarily a location, rather a state of mind.

Hey all,
   Well this is my first time writing to the list, and i have NEVER EVER
been to a rave, but i desperately want to go to one.  I would prefer to go
to a good one, because I know if i go to a bad one (is it possible?) i would
not want to attend one again.  I live in Fairfield, and am 20 and male.  I
would really appreciate some info on some up and coming raves that may be
around the weekend of Oct. 18-20.  Thanks for the bandwith and i hope to get
to know some of you guys.  Oh yeah, some one e-mail me privately and tell me
what the usuall dress is like, like i said, i am a begginer, but i do have

 I think one important point that many of us are missing here is that 
raves are many things for many people. Despite the fact that many people 
talk like "their" ideas of raving are the only legitimate or sincere ones 
around. The whole point of raving, I thought, was for a bunch of people 
to come together and enjoy the latest dance music and alternative 
enviroments. True, there are some raves I prefer over others, yet I try 
to see the value in all kinds of raves. Not every raver can have the 
same tastes in music and shouldn't. 
 More to the point, not everyone is at the same place with their lives as 
others so they need something different. Personally I can't stand most 
jungle untill I see Steve [whatever his last name is] dancing to it and 
then it makes sense. I don't like dancing near circle dancers but I love 
to watch them. I especially hate the intimidating feel of gangs and 
gangsta types yet I will not deny them the right and freedom of raving. I 
would rather they have their own scene anyway rather than busting in on a 
CCC party ( although who knows what a CCC party may show them).


 Anyway just some random mental debris...



hugz,


Ran

Depending on where your tastes lie, you might try Dave Clarke's "Archive
One" or Grey Boy's "Freestylin'".  Granted, these two releases have
absolutely *nothing* to do with each other stylistically, but I like 'em :)

"Freestylin'" blew me away -- really funky jazzy stuff over down tempo
beats and some scratching.

"Archive One" is a collection of Dave Clarke's work over a couple of
years, including Red's 1-3.  There are maybe two or three week ones, but
also some really good stuff as well.

You can get both of these at Rasputin's or Mod Lang in Berkeley.

	The dancing/breaking that most of those "sportswearin'" folk
	bust out with can be classified, IMO, as an arobic activity
	that highly surpasses the phsical fatigue from golf, or ping
	pong...
		They probable got a hella of alot more rhythm than
		most other fucked up folks!

...might actually win, like they did in 1994, 1988, 1984, 1980...

It really does make a difference.

Reagan, Bush and the people who put them in power have dragged the country
so far to the right
that about all Clinton or anybody else could do for now is slow the
rightward lurch down.  That is
very disappointing to all of us, but it's way better than what Dole would
do.  It took the Republicans
12 years to make this mess, it will take a lot longer to clean it up.

	1) "...as in the past, the attitude on the flyer sets the stage for 
	   the attitude of the party.'

	   Flyers do not set the stage for anything, unless you are solely
	   going by who is putting on the rave (even then that doesn't ring 
	   true -> Bankok Tribe put on Lucky Charms this past spring and they
	   also just put on Fantasy Island)
  	   EX: the 2nd Fusion this summer and Omniscience, also this summer.

	2) "a group that is intent on positivity. And you just don't get that 
	    from a bunch of frontin' sportswear gansta kids."
	
	   Look, you're just falling into the world of stereotypes by
	   believing that.  My good raving friend Alan wears all that
	   sportswear stuff and he's really sweet.  Not to mention, I've
	   met other nice people @ raves who are wearing that stuff.  
	
	   You seem to be a bit insecure.  Anyway, the rave scene should
	   be open to those who wish to participate.  They can wear 
	   whatever they want!  It's better than them being on the streets.
	   At least they are participating in a worthwhile activity.

I just wanted to say that you are SO RIGHT about this.  I mean, if you are REALLY high, and can barely see straight, then SURE the music is going to be great - regardless of company.  But positivity is what it is about, and always has been about (the rave scene) - not just good music.  Personally, I would much rather have a detailed coversation about raised consciousness, beautiful music, or SOMETHING positive, rather than say, watching people circle dance while talking about "macking bitches."
And as so many say, "just my $0.02."
Happy trails....

One of the most important things that "makes a rave" for me is a group that
is intent on positivity. And you just don't get that from a bunch of
frontin' sportswear gansta kids.

If the music is great, that is another key ingredient, but it alone will
never make a good party.

I hope it turns out OK, but, as in the past, the attitude on the flyer sets
the stage for the attitude of the party.

And remember, suburban is not necessarily a location, rather a state of mind.

I'm all for the 215 Benifit...it's a good cause to party for and a
good line-up (go women!)

Tribal Future is too long of a drive, and Ground Zero?  Hmm, just
looks a little too big for my taste.

     Well---
     
     
     this is a good question to ask, and it comes up again and again.  
     
     there really is no clear definite answer as to what to wear to a rave. 
      since we live in a society where we are judged by how we look and 
     what we wear, but...
     
     sportswear is always in!  some others on the list might not approve, 
     but the people that wear sportswear will like you.  
     
     there are no rules, but if you wear sportswear, you may want to 
     consider breakdancing.  Please don't take up too much room, as this 
     will gravely insult the people that don't like breakdancing or people 
     who wear sportswear.  
     
     
     or you could go for the trippy hippy look.  this should prove to be 
     quite sylish unless you are at a party with mostly breakdancers 
     wearing sportswear.  
     
     If you want to really "stick out" in the crowd, you may dress as a 
     clown or something like that.  I would not suggest dressing as a 
     newscaster or a corporate executive because, well, um, it just 
     wouldn't be too comfortable for the bump-n-grind that is likely to 
     happen.

Hey all,
   Well this is my first time writing to the list, and i have NEVER EVER
been to a rave, but i desperately want to go to one.  I would prefer to go to 
a good one, because I know if i go to a bad one (is it possible?) i would not 
want to attend one again.  I live in Fairfield, and am 20 and male.  I would 
really appreciate some info on some up and coming raves that may be around 
the weekend of Oct. 18-20.  Thanks for the bandwith and i hope to get to know 
some of you guys.  Oh yeah, some one e-mail me privately and tell me what the 
usuall dress is like, like i said, i am a begginer, but i do have clubbing 
experiance.  Would love to hear back from anybody.
     
                                                                Thanks,
                                                                    Jake

Planitarium!  Great line-up, shorter drive, camp-out...  =)  Word is it's

Howdy folks-

Since we're already talking about suggested albums, could anyone suggest the 
following:

1.  a really TRIPPY, Trippy trippy trippy, techno cd, kinda hardcore, something 
with lot's of low frequency tones, and haunting, surreal-ish feel? Anything out 
there that kind of sends shivers down your back when you listen to it, and 
makes you feel like you're having a flashback?  And you can only listen to it 
every now and then, because it's just too eerie?  

2. a killer ambient disc, something mellow, that you would listen to while 
watching the sunrise, meditating, reading a book on a rainy day, etc. Emphasis 
on mellow. 


I'm slowly building a collection, and have the need for these two "types" of 
music in order to complete the puzzle and find the golden monkey.  I would 
really appreciate any suggestions regarding these, as well as  where to find 
them.  I've found it hard, like (trose??), to know what the hell to buy.  It's 
not like mainstream music, where you'll hear a song on das radio or at a 
friend's pad, and that leads you on a trail.  

Oh...  one more question....
Who is the artist (female), of that older housy song that was out a few years 
ago, that went:

So baby if you want me, 
you've got to show me love
words are so easy to (hide??)
oh ah, you've got to show me luh-huv

etc.


Thanks!!
Nathan

Agreed... 215 is a mere walking distance from home (like 2 blocks)
anyway :)

Well, there's always the Cloud Factory campout, but that again
involves some driving... I might flip a coin on that one.

Total agreement on DJ Dan's "Loose Caboose". 

Other good'uns I recently picked up include

	Doc Martin "Unlock Your Mind" (moonshine) -- this seems to
	be Moonshine's second Doc Martin release (the first being
	United DJ's of America or whateveritscalled series). This has 
	Garth and ETI's "Twenty Minues of Disco Glory (Acid Rock Mix)"
	which Garth Played at B.M on Sunday morning and I've been "humming"
	ever since... More tips of the hat to the SF Scene include
	Simon Pearson (Come-Unity Records) "Two Crates"...

	Trance Europe Express, volume 2, 3, and 4. (compilations).
	These are really expensive at tower, cheaper at Reckless --
	$16.00 for a double CD -- prety good deal on volumes 2+4.

	Textures (trance europe express vols 1,2,3,4 mixes by Alex
	Patterson and that guy from underworld whose name i can't
	remember). Pretty Expensive ($25 for 2 CDs) and when I got it home,
	there was spoo all over the back of both CD's so I cleaned 'em well
	enough to play them w/o skipping my CD player, digitally copied 'em
	to DAT tape and returned them as defective :-). All other copies at the
	store had similar spoo all over the CD's. After listening again,
	I'd say save your money and get Trance Europe Express vol 2,3,4. 
	First, Alex Patterson's mixing and song selection is kinda lame (IMHO);
	second, you can hear pops/clicks from the vinyl sources from which
	the DJ's were mixing -- this is really annoying to hear on a CD.
	Third, perhaps due to the fact that this stuff was recorded off an
	LP, through a mixer, and back to the CD, the material sounds kind
	of sonically dead. Since I can probably mix better than Alex Patterson
	and already have Trance Europe Express vols 2,3,4, there seems
	to be no point to having this CD...

	Squarepusher. "Feed Me Weird Things." Rephlex Records. Pretty
	Fucking Expensive CD ~$22.00 -- I totally love about half
	the songs on here, and am quite bored with the other half.
	Very interesting stuff. Trainspotters might describe this as
	Dali's Car does Intelligent Drum and Bass Speed-Jazz.

	100% Drum&Bass. 2 CD Telstar compilation. Ignore the D&B instrumental
	version of the Prodigy's "Firestarter" (blech!) and most of the 
	tracks on here are pretty nice. A few are great.

	Speedy J "G Spot" -- 2 CD set w/ old 1994/5 album containing
	old standards like "The Fun Equations" (also on Trance Europe Express
	volume 2). Second CD contains live mix of Speedy J mixing his own
	material.

Hmm, I've got one that falls almost exactly between these two -- because
it's mellow, beatless, and completely eerie in just the way you describe
(trippy, flashback-inducing, etc).  It's called "Symphony of the Planets:
NASA Voyager Recordings" and claims to be selections of recorded material
from Voyagers I and II as they picked up the electromagnetic interaction
of solar wind and the magnetosphere of Jupiter and Saturn.

This cd would be perfect for any chill room because it's so nebulous --
there really isn't any musical structure to speak of.  Just lots and lots
of texture... and bass :)

Whether or not it's true is up for speculation, I guess, but it really
does sound amazing.  You should be able to find it at Tower or any other
mainstream music store.

	Sami

        Hey, if you go to LA, they have Vans like that too. Yep, I had the
burgundy airwalks before I even saw them in stores. I had to special order
them for like 3 months before they actually came in. Then, every little dork
in my neighborhood thought they were being "diffirent" or "crazy" for buying
them and wearing them. They even sell them at pacific sunwear! Too many
people trying to be diffirent, I gave that up a long time ago, now I just
try to be better than thou. I wore those damn shoes till every little peice
started decaying and falling off (don't get them wet).

        About what you were talking about. I'm a circle dancer. Usually one
forms near me and before I know it, I have to be in the middle to have
enough space to dance how I wanna. I've met some cool gangsta lookin people.
They were friendly. Most are just there to get fucked or get some chicks.
I'm not saying that just cuz you look like a gangsta that you have too get
fucked and check out the chicks, I was just sayin that the majority that
I've seen do. 

        I usually just dress in something I feel comfy in. I can't dance
with too heavy of clothes on. I usually like really baggy duds cuz they
complement my dancing more and are more airy. Usually though, I'll wear
something that'll look cool under certain lights like: White gloves, Bright
shirts, Something hanging from my pants, Or wierd striped things. I always
have my chain, I've worn it non-stop for a couple years. It goes a little
past my knee and it clears a 5 foot circle around me when I dance. 
        
        Yep. That's what I was thinkin.

Aryck

        Just so you know. Things that make up a good party:
                
                                #1 You have a killer ass time.

                          Things that make a party suck:

                                #1 You don't have a killer ass time.

Basically thats it.

But I've never not had fun. My friends have hated some parties we'd go to,
but then again what they do for fun is get fucked on beer and weed.

My Idea of fun is dancing, listening to music, being with friends with a
killer attitude, and meeting new friends.

It's all pretty simple.

Say cheese:)

Haunting, surrealistic techno, eh? You might want to try:

Basic Channel
    One of the most influential techno labels of recent
years. Hauntingly dark and beautiful, lush with murkiness,
and hypnotically repetitive. One warning: the music is very
repetitive, and may be hard to "get" at first. 
     There are ten or so basic channel 12"s, and another
five or ten 12"s on the side, as well as a compilation
CD. For a good review of BC06, read
	<http://www.mich.com/~marmoset/bc06.html>

You might also try the "Usability Now" CD, which is an
Infonet compilation. Now if you were interested in vinyl, I
could make TONS of recommendations... :)

check out the deep space network live disk - "traffic" (km20).  and the
new elfish echo - "sato yumiko" (also on km20) is a must if you're into
quirky experimental electronic music (ala atom heart).

also, dj spooky's songs of a dead dreamer (asphodel) has some suprisingly
good ambient, perfect for a rainy day. 

and there's a recent dbl. cd fax collection entitled "genetic drift" that
gives a decent overview of the label... 

but my current favorite cd is the new warp compilation - blechdottir,
tracks spanning the warp back catalogue (autechre, aphex, plaid, + lots
more) starting with a very crunchy disjecta cut and excellent mixing
provided by the dj food guys.

you can find all of these at dropbeat (www.dropbeat.com) in oakland.  it's
a relatively new shop but they have a great selection and their prices are
the best in the area.  the staff is very knowledgeable, they should be
able to help you find whatever you're looking for (as long as you're not
looking for goa trance ;). soundworks (in sf) should have most of these
too...

I prolly have more suggestions for #2.  There was a radio show called 
electronica that I used to listen to that offered a great depth of music 
from the ambient/electronic genre:

1) Sunelectric: The kitchen album>>>>>>>>'sarotti' and ':) and :(' are 
classics that i wish would last 10x longer.

2)Delirium: semantic spaces and both spheres albums>>>>I believe these 
were side projects of front line assembly members.  The first track on 
semantic has beautiful vocals that if anyone knows where i could find 
more stuff with her voice i'd be most appreciative to find out.

3) Cabaret Voltaire:the conversation>>>>>>>double cd with an epic 59 min 
track 


Sorry I cant suggest where to find them in the area...im fresh, but they 
shouldn't be that hard to find.

I think everyone should tell a little about themselves, and where they live.
It'd put some personalities in with these voiceless words.

Say cheese:)

        Flyers are art. That's all. I kinda think people who post flyers up
on their walls are a little goofy but that's just me. My girlfriend does
that, I think it's annoying. Kinda like being a poser or something.

        Now what kind of sporstwear do these people wear? MX gear? Mountain
climbing outfits? Bowling shirts? Hockey masks? How about golf shoes???
That's a good Idea, I think next time I'll wear my AXO pants, my golf shoes,
an old soccer jersey, a bicycle helmet, jet ski gloves, swim goggles, rubber
underwear, and some NIKE socks. Then I'll be waaaaay cool.

Aryck:

I need to make a request of you, which is to please trim any unnecessary original 
messages out of your replies!  The email you sent, which contained about 2k of 
your message, was almost 9k long cuz it also contained all of my first email, 
wayne's email, Madame Mercury's email, my sig, and Madame mercury's sig (which is 
huge!) in addition to your reply.  eNORmous!  Wastes bandwidth, takes forever to 
scroll down all the way to your reply at the bottom, kind of annoying all around, 
and I am probably not the only one who thinks this.  This is one of the general 
rules of net.consideration, so thanks in advance! :)

:)
Love,
Shawna

the strength of out-of-sight parties is their ablity to deliever a solid
line up for a poverty jet-set cover charge, a claim that a lot of the
local underground parties can't seem to make these days. i still remember
that out-a-sight last year that had robbie hardkiss, jeno, markie, galen,
spun and john howard for $8. good party. 

they've had a weird history of throwing both legit bar ((big heart city))
and outlaw parties in places i'd never been to before. some have gone off,
others haven't. some say their parties don't have much soul but i guess it
depends on how much you're willing to put into it. watch out for the cia
ravers.

they had a free 1 year anniversery at the acme last week. about 3 people
dancing to graeme at 1AM.

if you do go you should post a review.

Yes, good call, Shawna! (not singling you out, Aryck) Could we also
add trimming down super long headers to our list of minor irritations?
Most of us don't really need a complete record of every message's
journey across the Cabal :) Sometimes I have to wade through an entire
screenful of quoted headers before I get to any content... oh my!

And it just looks like ascii vomit, anyway... :)

love and phleas,
Steve

Well, ok...

I am a dynamic figure, often seen scaling walls and crushing ice.  I have 
been known to remodel train stations on my lunch breaks, making them more 
efficient in the area of heat retention.  I translate ethnic slurs for Cuban 
refugees, I write award-winning operas, I manage time efficiently.  
Occasionally, I tread water for three days in a row.

I woo women with my sensuous and godlike trombone playing, I can pilot 
bicycles up severe inclines with unflagging speed, and I cook Thirty-Minute 
Brownies in twenty minutes.  I am an expert in stucco, a  veteran in love, 
and an outlaw in Peru.

Using only a hoe and a large glass of water, I once single-handedly defended 
a small village in the  Amazon Basin from a horde of ferocious army ants.  I 
play bluegrass cello, I was scouted by the Mets, I am the subject of 
numerous documentaries.  When I'm bored, I build large suspension bridges in 
my yard.  I enjoy urban hang gliding.  On Wednesdays, after work, I repair 
electrical appliances free of charge.

I am an abstract artist, a concrete analyst, and a ruthless bookie.  Critics 
worldwide swoon over my  original line of corduroy evening wear.  I don't 
perspire.  I am a private citizen, yet I receive fan mail.  I have been 
caller number nine and have won the weekend passes.  Last summer I toured 
New Jersey with a traveling centrifugal-force demonstration.  I bat .400.  
My deft floral arrangements have earned me fame in international botany 
circles. Children trust me.

I can hurl tennis rackets at small moving objects with deadly accuracy.  I 
once read Paradise Lost, Moby Dick, and David Copperfield in one day and 
still had time to refurbish an entire dining room that evening.  I know the 
exact location of every food item in the supermarket.  I have performed 
several covert operations for the CIA.  I sleep once a week; when I do 
sleep, I sleep in a chair.  While on vacation in Canada, I successfully 
negotiated with a group of terrorists who had seized a small bakery.  The 
laws of physics do not apply to me.

I balance, I weave, I dodge, I frolic, and my bills are all paid.  On 
weekends, to let off steam, I participate in full-contact origami.  Years 
ago I discovered the meaning of life but forgot to write it down.  I have 
made extraordinary four course meals using only a mouli and a toaster oven.  
I breed prizewinning clams.    I organize underground raves for my tribe of 
Siberian Dwarf Hamstas, and sometimes I spin entire mind-blowing sets with 
one tape deck and a Captain Crunch whistle. I have won bullfights in San 
Juan, cliff-diving competitions in Sri Lanka, and spelling bees at the 
Kremlin.  I have played Hamlet, I have performed open-heart surgery, and I 
have spoken with Elvis.

CHEESE!

um, this is my first post here (we just got our e-mail thingy 
working...adam posted the dj crack poem earlier), so introductions seem 
pertinent at this point.

my name's philip diaz...i live in (that sorry excuse for a 
'city') downtown sj with my roommate and friend adam. i'm a 3rd-year 
architecture student and graphic designer (but not currently attending 
school). i've been going to raves for about 5 years now, but i didn't 
really grok the whole thing until about 3 years ago.

so for the past few years, i've been planning the coup. rounding up the 
forces. i've met others who want to take the 'underground' in a positive 
direction and do their best to keep it from deteriorating and getting 
swallowed whole by our lovely american capitalistic conglomerate 
tv-junkie society. lately we've all joined forces (and worked our butts 
off) to bring Charity to life. this, as far as we can tell at present, is 
to be our life's work (but not our careers!). whether it be a rave, 
concert, art performance, ritual, or festival, the Underground will 
always exist, and there will always be people who know and act upon what 
is right. we're doing our best to turn raving (or whatever future 
form raving may take upon itself) into the most postive experience 
possible for people. that means ALL people, not just ravers (yes, even 
those capitalistic conglomerate tv-junkies). this is something i'd hoped 
would happen for a long time, and now it's here!

that's me in a couple'a paragraphs.

next!

What happened to love?
what happened to PLUR?
what happened to the scene?
what happened to me?
what happened to dj's?
what happened to promoters?
what happened to.........

I was just thinking about the scene and how it's changed in the past few
years, some for better, some for worse.  I still LOVE it, but it seems to be
SO divided these days, it used to be that i would go to a certain party and
see tons of happy faces and people i knew.  It was soo new and fresh.  Now
it is soo divided and everyone seems bitter or jaded and doesn't like this
person, that "type" of clothes or that "group" of people for numerous
reasons.  I really am just curious about the motivation and goals of this
scene, as it stands today.  I REALLY wish there was a lot more unity.

Just some random ramblings,
Micron

PS, i STILL luv u ALL!

Hey everyone,
I was surfing around some music sites and happened
to find www.hotz.com.  Hotz has software that
allows you to compose music, play along with any
existing track, etc.  It looks kinda cool but I
would like to see if anyone in sfraves-land has
played with it.  I would really like to hear
your opinions (good, bad, or otherwise) before
I take the plunge.

TIA,
Bradley

>=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

I'm not going off on how much ground zero's going to suck; i'm going off on
how much of a dink ghost is. He's arrogant enough to rate himself "#1" on
his own flyer and a friend of mine has met him and can't seem to find any
nice things to say about the guy personally.

I might actually go to Ground zero (assuming I get in free with Jon & Sin),
but I'm not expectng much. A flyer advertising several rooms of "audio
devastation" and "sexy anime dancers and a giant robot" just isn't my
style. Sure the DJs might be fucking SICK but music is just one aspect of a
rave, IMNERHO. I mainly go to dance and meet awesome people in a
comfortable family environment. (FnF, harmony, etc.) I'm willing to pass up
a party with a BOMB-ASS line-up (see: funky tekno tribe halloween massive)
in favor of a party where I know I'll be surrounded by beautiful happy
loving people and close friends. (see: halloween FnF)

I'm not saying Ground Zero will be a gangsta fest for sure, but I'm
assuming it will be becuase the types of people that flyers like THAT
attract tend to be a little shady. Yeah, there'll be alot of cool people
there (yes, you, sherry and ryan! =) but it sucks having to search for them
in a crowd of pimped-out drugged-up lookin'-fer-lovin' foolios. good
quote/paraphrase from the last XLR8R:

"when the ravers are outnumbered by people who have come to see what ravers
look like it's no longer a celebration but a freak show. and guess which
lot are the freaks?"

smiles,
and see you kids at FnF!!!

Anything by Deep Listening Band.  Barramundi is a label that puts out a lot
of ambient stuff with something of a "world-music" feel--you might look for
comps or samplers from them.  Transformer 2 is the only Barramundi artist
I'm really familiar with; they're nice, but maybe a little beatier than
you're looking for.

Well, for ambient music, at least, if you can get KKUP (91.5), tune in
Sunday from 8-11 am and at midnight for lots of good stuff.  They'll tell
you what they're playing, too.

 SKENO ( Sparks/Reno ) RAVES?

 My wife and I will be up in Reno this weekend ( and misssing the big
parties here in the S.F. Bay area! ), to visit my dad. In my free time,
I was wondering if there was anything rave-like in the Sparks/Reno
area? Are there any good record stores or info numbers I can check
on?

Perhaps part of individual and community growth is identifying any
obstacles to further growth and development.  The items Micron mentions
appear to me to be such obstacles.  For growth to occur, we must transcend
our human nature, finding ways to overcome obstacles to growth.  Sometimes
we can do it ourselves, while other times we need help from others in
examining ourselves as we are, and as we'd like to be.  Then, whether by
ourselves or with others' help, we can bring ourselves closer to the kind
of individual and community we wish to achieve.

        Y'know. . .you're probably telling the truth. But Elvis lived across

discovered the meaning of life one night while under the influence of a

I've seen clever parodies, and that Lucky Charms ("tragically delicious?")
flyer wasn't it. I like those coolio skater shirts where designer(s) works
with the original's style and actually "designs" something tha fits yet
makes a clever joke about the original (see: almost anything Fuct or Giant
or Designers Republic has done), but trying to see how many ray-traced
pills one can fit into a bowl of cereal is neither design not parody, IMHO.
He could've done something cool with it (actually, no he couldn't. It's
tough getting creative when Bagok Tribe is on your ass telling you to they
want to throw a party called Lucky Charms-- I seriously doubt he had much
of a say in what the final would look like), but I just can't see the
effort in that flyer.

Side note: What's wrong with e-con these days??? Has anyone seen his
kick-ass webpage or his old flyers? (Area 51, Land Before Time) I used to
LOVE his work so much and now he's consistently putting out K-R-A-P. (lucky
charms: probably less than 1 hour of work. Fantasy Island: I'm guessing 1
hour of work and 3 hours of waiting for that boring-ass Bryce Island to
render) Has he found a really awesome girlfriend or something?

"everyone seems all bitter and jaded"....

As someone who is relatively new to the whole "rave scene" (my six
month birthday is coming up in a few weeks!  Yay!) it really saddens
me to see how burnt out so many of my fellow gruvers are...This isn't
everyone, of course, but it seems like the majority of people who are
partying in the 21+ age set are kind of spent, since those are the
people who have been partying for a while.  It seems sometimes like
the only people at a party who have that same giddy enthusiasm as me
("WEE!  I'm here to DANCE!  And have FUN!!!") are the 16-year-olds
who have been partying for about the same time as I have...in fact, I
have had people tell me they thought I was 16 myself because my
energy was so pure and un-cynical.  What is it about being
"experienced" at raving that makes folks have less fun?

Isn't partying about HAVING FUN?  I mean isn't this why we DO it?  If
it's not fun any more, why do people bother?  I figure raves are too
expensive and too overwhelming to go to if you're not there to have a
GOOD TIME.  Again, I know I'm generalizing...there are plenty of
older ravers who make me look sedate.  But it seems like all the
SPARKLY ENERGY drains out of people after a year or two.  Is this the
fate that is destined to meet ME in a few years?  "Oh yeah, pshaw.  I
USED to party.  Used to dance till 9am.  Used to have a good time and
dress up in texturally-exciting clothes and sparkles and hug who-ever
came near me.  Now I see that's all just a load of hoo-haw.  I took
up badmittin instead."

EEK!  Someone shoot me!

much love and enthusiasm

Subject: About the XLR8r review of SF scene
To: sfraves@hyperreal.com
Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk


Did anybody have a chance to read the scene review in the latest 
issue???  If you have not yet done so, mabee you should and see how you 
feel about it??    When I read it, let me tell you, I was rely upset.  
That thing read like a big fucking insult to the entire SF rave 
culture.  I felt like we had a great and positive summer and that there 
were a lot of great parties, but after reading the bi-monthly review of 
the "scene report" It almost made me sick. 

What I don't understand is this:  How can a magazine that is based in 
SF expect any of its readers to take it articles and advertisers 
seriously is the HOME SCENE of the magazine is pertrade to be as fucked 
up as my spelling?????  Don't they uderstand that it just compleatly 
undermines their credability as well as makes them out to be on the 
wrong side of the line.  Its bad enough that we have TV shows like 
SLeeza, But when a 'RAVE" magazine like XLR8 writes a review of their 
own HOME town parties and promoters, that is nothing but a huge SLAM, 
and is circulated and read all over the country, thats when real damage 
is done.  

If you lived in another state, and you were reding XLR8, Which you knew 
was published in SF, and you were reding the reviews of all the 
diferent party scenes all over the country, and you get to the one 
about SF, and it is a big fucking joke, full of negative conotations 
and drug inuendoes, and just all around slanted, and biased and 
negative.  Wouldn't you say to yourself "Well fuck, look at the local 
scene in SF, its all fucked up, an this magazine is made in SF, I can't 
take any of it seriously"  Well at least that would be my opinion.

Personaly, I already think that the magazine does not have much 
jurnalistic value.  Their viewpoint is usualy biased and slanted, and 
they rarely try to cover any article from more than one side.  But 
that's cool, because it is their magazine and they can do whatever they 
want as long as it sells advertising and subscriptions.  Thats the 
beutiful thing about living in a country with freedom of the press.  
But we also have freedom of experssion, and I for one have expressed 
myself to the editors of XLR8 by sending them E-mail about my feelings. 
 Atatched below is my letter.  If anyone else outhere would like to see 
a change in the way our scene in SF is described in future issues, 
please send them E-Mail also to:  xlr8r @ cyborganic.net

P.s. I am in no way afiliated with the magazine, and this is not a ploy 
to start contraversy with the magazine to increase its exposure.  I am 
just a local promoter that feels that there is a buitiful scene here in 
the bay area, and does not like to see it belittled by some spun out 
second hand gosip.



This is the letter I sent to XLR8:



Dear editor,

I would like to know, how come a SF based magazine caries such good and 
detailed reviews of the scene in other parts of your distribution area, 
(ie. LA, portland, seatle, san diego, newyork, etc.) But when it comes 
time for the scene and party review of your home area (San Francisco) 
you realy drop the ball????

In fact your latest issue read more like a gosip colomb than a party 
review.  I don't know, mabee Im not getting it or something. It just 
seems to me that when people from outside the area read this review, 
their impresions of the SF scene will be less than favorible with all 
the downplaying and negative conotations in your reviews.  Sure, to 
those of us who know whats going on and see it from the "INSIDE-OUT", 
it might be funny to joke about the intent of UNITY, or Dis on Space 
Children or talk about the cost of parties in derogitory content, Or 
even throw in drug asociations.  But the problem is that people that 
read it from the "OUTSIDE-IN", People that arn't in the "KNOW", and 
especialy people outside our area, will think of thye SF scene as a 
bunch of FUCK-UPS trying to do parties.

I just think that your magazine, being a SF based publication, Should 
do a litle bit more to make our local scene sound a little more healthy 
and positive than you make it out to be.  Puting a half ass bullshit 
party review as the last review in the section, and giving it such a 
minimal amount of content makes our local scene look bad.  It is your 
home town, and the readers understand this.  When you downplay and diss 
your home scene, it takes away from the credability of your entire 
publication.  Don't you see that????  How are people suposed to take 
your articles and advertisers seriously if the home Party Scene of the 
publication are made out to be a big fucking joke.  You can't be so 
ignorant that you don't see the conection.

Im sure that if you took a little bit diferent perspective on your 
pertrail of you HOME scene and put a litle pride in the review, as well 
as puting it in the begining of scene section, you might get a litle 
bit more advertising from promoters who might want to place adds for 
local events, and you actualy might improve the image of your magazine 
by improving public perception of where YOU are coming from.

I don't know who it is that writes the revies for the SF scene, but I 
feel that it is in your magazines best intrest to re-evaluate your 
policy on the way you depitc your home town, and the way that you 
support the promoters that make up the scene that you make your living 
writing about.  Don't forget what came first.  There were promoters 
doing parties, long before there were people writing about them.  The 
parties are the thing that make up the scene, not yours or anyone 
eleses fictitious representation of it.  Mabee you should give it some 
serious thought and try not to write revues that are biased, negative, 
sarcastic, synical, and slanderous.  These are not so caled "raving 
virtues" that should be in a magazine that "suposably" is down for the 
positive movement of the house culture.

If you want to ask any questions or if you did not understand where I 
was coming from, please call me and I would be glad to chat.

ps. sorry for bad spelling, buts its a trademark.

I haven't been "in the scene" for long, so I wasn't around when all these
parties happenned, but:

don't let yourself get bogged down with that attitude!!! Hindsight is
always 20/20, but usually a little rose-tinted as well... Everything works
in waves... old crews sell out or fall apart so new ones are formed to take
their place. The scene is evolving but it's not getting "worse" --I know
this because of the way it's changed my life and the way I deal with
people. When people get tired of the current scene they form their own
crews to improve it! Just look at Harmony, FnF, and all the others who
consistently open my mind and my heart to new forms of music, new ways of
dancing and new people... This scene is too vibrant and healthy to let
itself be detroyed by the shitty parties... Bagok Tribe and others will
consume themselves one day and new parties will rise up to fill the void.
Nothing stays the same. Don't expect it to. Just let the changes take their
course and open yourself to their positive aspects!

take care,
-m.

I wasn't trying to cap on the scene, or even say that i don't like it, i
love it.  But it DOES seem to me that there are a few people getting quite
cynical about it.  Maybe it is that i've been meeting all the "wrong" people
lately, i yearn to meet cool, POSITIVE and happy people, people that want to
be your friend and like to go out and play.  My posting was just about my
experiences and my overview of the scene and some of the people in it over
the last 6 years.  

I also have to agree with those who posted about what makes a "party"
It, for me, is definitely the VIBE.  The music is very important, but if i
get bad energy, it does ruin the experience for me.

Finally, who am I, someone posted that we should say something about
ourselves, well hmmm.  I REALLY like Sdreams answer and got quite a chuckle.
Me, i LOVE music, art and people.  That is definitely the 3 things that best
represent me.  I am in a constant search to discover and develop myself.  I
also love the outdoors and anything that involves being in it.  Hope to meet
u all one fine day.

RARELY do I laugh out loud reading email.  =)

However!  Ray does have a point.  I only skimmed over the XL article (I
think there were two parts right?) and from personal experience, there is a
whole hell of a lot going on in the SF scene (mainly the true underground
stuff) that never gets mentioned.

I'm sure that will all change when they review their anniversary part...

Somebody just said it few weeks ago, but I would like to mention it again,
because it happened today *once again*.

When you post, please use paragraphs...  sometimes people really hate to
read posts that are huge blocks of words - no paragraphs or no empty lines
between paragraphs.  It just makes reading way more simpler and people
don't get lost when they are reading 1-2 page posts.

Sorry for bitching,

This seems to describe me...

Play me some truly innovative music and you will me become a lot more
enthusiastic.  Does anybody else find the current state of music in
this city to be stale?  Or is it just me?

What do I want to hear?  Funky, downbeat goa.  Music I can groove to that
has many layers of thick analogue synths.... with an emphasis on FUNK...
with some hip-hop influence.  I want to work my body into a groove...
NOT just bounce around.

I am really tired of that 135 bpm kick drum on every beat music.  

The last thing I heard that I really liked was Liquid Blue's set
in the ambient room at Harmony.

I picked up one of moonpups tapes at Charity and it definately has some
FUNK to it.  Very cool!  Even has some Public Enemy in it.

Agreed. The first two or three tracks spun(?) by Goa Gil the other
night fit this description (somewhat). Slow, thick, trancy, exotic -
I'd go as far as to say sensual, but in a spiritual sense. I've been
dying for music like this.

If anyone knows what I'm talking about and can point me towards music
like this, I'd be very happy.

Steve

Hey Troy,

I am not into fast bpm's or that goa stuff, but I do, like yourself, like 
to groove.  

The current state of house music in the city is, er, well it leaves 
plenty to be desired, for myself at least.

I go out quite a bit less these days...I would go out more IF the music, 
the DJ's and the scene was more vibrant than it is.  After 6 years of SF 
partying, it can get a bit, old.

I think the problem revolves around patterns and modes of behavior we all 
fall into.  Earlier in SF there were many more events going on than now, 
many more UG events, and a plethora of good DJ's.

There was techno, trance, garage, deep house, tribal, breakbeat, italian 
all over the place.  Since parties have become easier to throw, easier to 
get fine talent, and since people in genereal have become pro's and as 
such a bit more jaded, it adds to the sense of dullness to it all.

The main reason I go out these days is to be sociable, and IF POSSIBLE 
dance a little with my lady.  This all depends on the expertise of the DJ 
at hand of course, and the general mood of the party.

At one time you had NO CHOICE BUT to go off.  Why?  Well the cops were 
gonna be there and that added to the level of tension.  The place you 
partied at was abandoned and dangerous, that added to the danger.  You're 
on so many drugs your eyes are like slot machines flipping a triple bar.  
That's why.  The combination of uncertainty, the drugs (drug free 
partying....er, why?), and a new venue was just enough reason for people 
to have a good time.  The DJ's, who at that time were at the pinnacle of 
thier madness had plenty to do with the crowd.  Now it almost seems like 
a show...or a circus.

I've been to some of the events thrown by the Good Times people, and some 
other sundry affairs...the vibe is definitely there for the new younger 
crew, no doubt.  And I'm sure from their and others perspective that  
certain events are "on the one!".  

For me, I have seen the blue buddah many many times.  At this point I go 
out, sometimes get a little stoopid (or a lot, can I get a witness Mr. 
White), dance a little, then hang with friends at the ULIMATE chill out 
space...home!

I'm glad the scen is going on, although at a different energy level than 
it had in the beginning (believe me, nothing beats the newness vibe..and 
in SF, there really ain't all that which ain't been done before...), but 
this is a good thing.

People are more picky, and know what they like.  People get off of thier 
asses and do parties if they don't like what's being done, and it is 
still a fun scene with alot of nice people.

I know many people on this list are pining for the days of the more 
intimate F&F's, etc.  and are just out of respect, not airing their 
views, but it is inevitable.  Nothing beats the first time.   There is 
nothing like the first kiss, the first hug, the first grope, the first 
love, or the first orgasm.

Same thing for parties.  You probably already had the one you were 
waiting for...

I was talking to my girlfriend the other day and she noted, after seeing 
some of my old Ameba clothes that: "No matter what you say now you WERE a 
raver.  Maybe not now, but at one time you were raving, just like 
everyone else. AND you had a good time doing it too!" (little minka :) ).

I guess the evo-devolution would be:
Raver -> Partyer -> Scenester -> Old Skooler

I just like to go out, catch a tune or two, say hi to my friends, drink 
some alcohol, organic engagement, some hugz & kisses, then chilling the 
brain at home.  If I have the next day or three off, maybe some 
crackerjacking, BUT it has to be the BOMB partay!

One doesn't have to become jaded as they age, but one usually does become
realistic.  Idealism is usually for the uninformed.  My life at 16 was a
lot less complicated.  One usually doesn't have the life experience to
understand how the world is not black and white.  At least from my
perspective, and I'm not even old.

When something is new and unblemished, you usually have more energy for
it.  After you lose your innocence, you see the inherent impurity.  You 
also become more discriminating.  Raves, like life, are not perfect.  When
a lot of people begin raving, they are somewhat of "rave-sluts", not
knowing a lot about the music, promoters, etc.  So, they go to ANYTHING
until they learn a bit of what they like.  Then comes the choosey stage.
When you know what you want to
get out of it, you search for those kinds of parties.  From here a lot of
people begin helping with the kinds of parties they like.  Notice the
current influx of sfravers who help with Harmony.  They know what they
like and want to put their energy into it.  As for people who have been
doing it from the beginning (greater than 6 years), I don't know what they
do, I'm not there.  Some people start making the music which appears to be
a natural progression.  There is a contiuum of experiences with raving and
age.  People just simply find themselves at different points.

One's life isn't all about raving (I'd hope at least), and many things
call you.   I'm in a place where I can afford, both time-wise and
economically, to go to 2-3 parties a month.  But, when I'm working on my
Ph.D., I don't think that will be the case.  And, I certainly hope it
isn't.  I don't plan on stopping, but sometimes you have to put your life
in perspective and realize that dedication to any one thing leaves a lot
of other things out.  So, I wouldn't necessarily say that people get jaded
and cynical all the time, they've just have time to see a more full
picture.

After 5 years, I think to the lot of people it will be tired and old.  
Even tires have got to be changed every so often, but it's still a tire 
nonetheless.

I think the SF rave scene will pick up some steam when my son is, oh 
about 17 or 18.  By then he'll have the skills to do the do, and maybe he 
can hook up with some of the other kids of rave vets and show the old 
timers how to do it PROPERLY.

Man, the synthetics they should have by then coupled with some cranial 
implants ougtha make tripping safe easy long and effective.

     Hi :
     
     
     I've got about 3 or more cool & globally aware friends that I want to 
     bring to a proper renegade San Francisco party this weekend. The last 
     good trance I was at was Hallucinations a while back. Anyone now 
     anywhere ? These are good people : My brother, & two friends that 
     deserve a better intro to SF than a commercial club.
     
     My bro is over from Ireland for another 2 weeks and I want to show him 
     a party with that unique Californian vibe.

Hi all!

 Sorry to put this everyone's box, but hopefully someone can help...

 I left at the Charity party, at Acme, a bicycle wheel mounted to a square 
piece of steel tubing. Anyone familiar with my slide show schtuff knows 
that I use it for my slide show. I feel really stupid for bothering 
people due to my own ineptitude (or was that drugged exhaution? ;) but I 
really would like to get it back. If anyone picked it up and would like 
to help me get it back they can reach me here. I would like to get the 
phone # of Lamont (sp?) at Acme; he may have it still.

 On a happier note; I just had my phone turned on after a month or more 
of disconnection. If anyone would like it, please email me privately.

Thanks for your patience.  :)



hugz,

hey sorry i'm not posting this until sooooo late but i just finished all
my classes =( for the day ...

stella luna is playing tonight at ebf (enchanted broccolli forest) here at
stanford - ebf is a co-op on the back (i-280) side of campus, right near
junipero serra.  those of us who saw them at harmony i bet want to see
them again ... i know i do!

one note - there's probably not much stella luna/underage drinking
crossover, but just in case: be aware that the stanford cops (and
administration) are on some sort of fucked up crusade to clean up the dorm
drinking scene.  be careful if you drink, and please don't mess up other
people's night - like that really needed to be said.  8)

see you there

     Hi :
     
     I'm tentatively organising a camping party the weekend after next. All 
     I/we (around 20/30 of us at ther moment) need is some sort of sound 
     system. I don't think a boombox is going to do the job (!)
     If anyone wants to suggest equipment for a party of this kind please 
     e-mail me. It is just going to be a group of chilled out folk 
     travelling North to sleep/dance/talk under the stars before the 
     weather breaks...
     
     ps : We dont want to spend lots of money.
     
     
     Cheers !

yeah you are right on it John S. Lee, but I think the word "jaded" could 
also apply to the tone of some of the other points in your rant...

hey I'm a fan of your posts, and max respect to your other achievements, 
but Mr. Lee nobody on this planet has been to that party they've "been 
waiting for".  if you're still breathing, you are still raving, in some 
form or another...!  that of course is my humble $.02.   ;)  you as an 
Old Skooler would recognize the agelessness of dancing with friends and 
loved ones, I'd think.  You as a partier would also agree to the timeless 
magic of good beats and kind vibe, yes?  The blue buddah never goes away.

> asses and do parties if they don't like what's being done, and it is 
> still a fun scene with alot of nice people.

so really you are a raver, this last bit proves it's true in your heart of 
hearts.  it's my net.soapbox opinion that you are just in a "jaded" phase.  
you'll come through it man!     d;)

peace
love
unity
respect

PLUR huh....

Well John, thanks for the reply, but out of respect you should respect 
what *I* wish to call myslef, and not take it upon yourslef to tell me 
who I am. (This is how fights get started on this list.  I know it 
sounds curt, just being straightforward).

Also, you describe my post as jaded...huh?  I ave respect to the new ones 
on the scene, and I was giving my opinion of my perceptions of the 
problem.  I said I still go out, and I have a good time.  My intentions 
though are differnet, and I am WELL aware of why I go out. Accept them.

No it was not the post of a jaded raver, just a person who has been on 
the SF Dance Culture arena/scene/whatever, for a little while.  There are 
others, who are probably 100 or so, who were here duirng the barbary 
coast, and that makes our little piddly parties look like kindegarten, IMO.

I still have a good time when I go out, but I do not rave, not even 
close.  I USED to rave, but I have not been to a "rave" in years.  
Probably becuase I am not a raver, but someone who lkikes to listen/make 
house msuic, someone who has friends in the dance culture, and someone 
who enjoys listenting to goo DJ's, buy a record or two, and hang with the 
many friends I've made through SF dance culture throughout the years.

Jaded, hell...I have good times now like I had good times then.  I have 
the advantage of enjoying it with a historical perspective, having played 
a part in part or in whole at throwing parties, and having friends who 
are still doing parties, my two favorite being Wicked and Stompy.

Whatever...I know you had good intentions, and gave me props and all.  
But people, IMO, should spend more time appreciating others experiences 
rather than making these attempts at redefining or classifying them.
We just might do better as a species as a result of such respect.

But then again, I could be wrong.

Peace out,
John

:)

Yes.  You know they used to call it letter writing.  Grammer.  Spelling.  You
know all that stuff we would have learned if we had not cut class all those
days.

Hey, I just did it.  It can't be that hard.  Now we just have to work on the
"Post only the smallest part of the original post that you need in order to be
clear" thing.

Wow!  If I can do this then anyone can!

hey! i live in downtown san jose too!

this is shannon, and i am a seldom poster but a daily reader!

i go to san jose state university, majoring in industrial/orginizational
psychology & environmental studies,   minoring in anthropology(main emphasis
right now is in archaeology!)  [whew!] - obviously keeps me from doing much
else - 
(i noticed at least one e-mail address on a sfraves post from sjsu! hi!)

i have been going to raves since about 1993. 

the main reason why i am responding is because i have been trying to learn
how to play the digeridoo for awhile on a pvc pipe.  i just got the real
thing for my birthday and was looking for someone who is willing to help me
with circular breathing and making more than one drone out of it. if you
know of anyone, please send me a message personally.  

well, that's it for me. 
peace.

i have to agree with you.  it was a real downer of an article, both pieces.

I think you're overreacting, cubensis.  jslee was responding only 
tangentially, and I don't think he meant it at all personally as you
felt it was.

You talk about not being a raver now.  In retrospect, my firm belief is
that "raving" in SF meant a quite different experience than in many
other places, in part because of its "Disco City" history.  Acid house
seems to have made a bigger impact there than most other places, and
I count myself lucky that I lived through some of that.  There's onluy
a glimmer of those times any more, and that's what John was really
talking about.

I had a long talk with someone the other night that some of you may know --
he was an original Rave Called Sharon partner, worked at DV8 and 1015,
he knows what's up.  After hearing his perspective a bit -- which helped
fill in some of my own history -- it just reaffirmed that what happened
in SF was similar to but so much different than elsewhere.  It couldn't
have, and never did, stay in the same place very long, and as always our
memories highlight the exceptional experience.  But it *was* truly
exceptional, and I even missed out on most of the earlier phases.

That time will come again, it always does, maybe not in SF, but we'll
know about it when it does and if we're lucky, we'll be part of it once
again.  

In the meantime, while the scene as a whole is jaded, the bright spots
are still there and shine as brightly in SF as anywhere.  Sunset, Harmony,
F&F, daytimes at Golden Gate Park, great house parties, the once-in-a-blue-
moon top megaparty . . . I've been chained to my desk for over three months
now, and I can't tell you how much I miss it.

But I'll be back!

In the meantime, a small word of advice for those who look askance on jslee's
claims to have been there, done that and got the postcards.

He was, he did, and he does :-)

A copy of the flyer is located at http://www.infinary.com,


"Let me have silence always in the centre of the shouting, that is
essential. Let me have silence so that no pin may drop and not be
heard, and not a whisper. Escape us for all our spouting, nor the
needle scratching upon this gramophone of the circular cosmic spot.
Hear me, mark me, learn me, throw the mind's ear open. Shut up the
mind's eye, all will be music. What sculpture of sound cannot, what
cannot as a fluid token words, that nothing else cannot."

I still find it hard to compare any experience with the peak moments
I've had dancing at the better raves in my life.   I'm not going
to bore everyone with all the reasons why those peak moments seem harder
to come by these days.  But one thing that has become clear over the
last 2 years, is that some of us reach a point where we want more in
our lives than an ongoing continuim of amazing Nows.  The Reality Beyond
calls for our attention: there's a big, weird world out there, for
better or worse.  The metaphysical connections some make to it through
the rhythm/dance/plur experience of raving can start to feel
illusionary and shallow if not accompanied by a more "reality"-based
involvement with the things happening around us.

For many, the responsibilities of careers/family/health call us away.
Others choose paths that seem to have more substance in a political,
creative, spiritual or social sense.  There are other thriving scenes
and intimate social circles in the SF Bay Area that attempt to do many 
of the things that raving has only touches upon.

Despite its flaws, the rave scene still seems like a wonderful place
to be.  As long as you have your clique of raver friends, it's
pretty hard not to have some great times.  I used to wonder if there
would ever be anything to replace it in my life.  I'm happy to say that
the Universe is an infinitely rich place for endless exploration.

	who is a massive vinyl junkie and wants to hit stores in S.F. over the weekend.
	He'll be looking for (hard) house grooves and techno as well as anything
	distinctly S.F.

	So let me know your fave vinyl outlet and we'll pop by tomorrow or Saturday.

I just wanted to say that I have zero respect for DJ ghost since he dissed
me on a tape cover he made about 3 years ago....... 
 
I was in charge of the DJ line-up in the small room at one of the community
benefits held at the richmond auditorium, and I already had too many DJ's
and I already excluded myself (as a DJ that nite), to help give everyone
have a chance to play....... 
 
now somebody (I won't say who), told ghost he could play, and I had already
nixed him as a possible DJ because of time restraints and I felt at the
time his techno was too hard for the room (not nessesarily the right
reason, but it was my decision to make), anyway.....he shows up with his
records and expected to spin.......... I explained to him he was
mis-informed and the person was out of line to tell him he could spin......
I truly felt bad about the situation and tried to apologize and smooth it
over, however.......... 
 
.......... it was a bad vibe and so life goes on..........until about a
month or so later when he puts out a tape, and he thanks all the people of
SF etc......bla bla bla............. and then at the end of his list of
thanks he puts.........and no thanks to the brit posse & moonpup....... 
 
I thought ......what a jerk...........he may have his hard feelings and
granted, maybe he felt slighted, and justified to slag me off,
..........but on a tape !!!!!    well ever since, I have had no respect for
his style or vibe........ just another bad vibe story from the
pupster..........     moonpup    oh yeah......... the party went off and
the vibe was awsome......

Yes.  You know they used to call it letter writing.  Grammer.  Spelling.  You
know all that stuff we would have learned if we had not cut class all those
days.

Hey, I just did it.  It can't be that hard.  Now we just have to work on the
"Post only the smallest part of the original post that you need in order to be
clear" thing.

Wow!  If I can do this then anyone can!

Hello SFR,

This is the voice of the Cloud Factory...

This Saturday and Sunday, October 12-13, 2:00pm-2:00pm, 1996, .... PLANETARIUM

There is a $15 suggested donation for tickets, with proceeds split between
Omar's Healing Fund
and Cloud Sound.    (408) 457-7726

In East Bay we have tickets at Drop Beat, a new record store in Oakland!
        www.dropbeat.com
        5417 College Avenue, Oakland

In SF we have tickets at Frequency-8,
                www.frequency-8.com (mars this isnt working for some reason?)
        1816 Haight Street

In San Jose we have tickets at Solid Grooves
        368 S. Bascom, San Jose

There will also be tickets available on the mountain.  Everyone who gets
there before sunset will get a special treat.

You can get more info about the party and see pictures of the site
(whoohooo!) at our website @
                www.cloudfactory.org/upcoming.html

Preparations:

        If you are planning on attending this weekend, there are several
things you should keep in mind. The last hour of the drive is a dirt road
that is fairly steep and bumpy. If you are driving your car should be at
least 8-10 inches above the ground.  Make sure you have a fair amount of
gas when you leave the freeway--that's not the end of the journey.

        Remember we are a LONG way from town, so if you haven't stopped to
get supplies by the time you get to Healdsburg, you better hit a store.
Here's some goodies that might come in handy:

                                * a gallon of water
                                * food
                                * sleeping bag or blankets
                                * smile, or three
                                * tent
                                * sun screen
                                * bug repellant
                                * snacks

Directions:

      From San Francisco:
            *101 North towards Healdsburg, go past Santa Rosa
            *Exit on Dry Creek Road, the third exit in Healdsburg (make
sure you have a full tank)
            *Turn left on Dry Creek Road, set your odometer
            *at 12.1 miles turn left, the sign will read

                            Skagg Springs Road
                            Annapolis
                            Highway 1

            *watch for the sign with a Saturn picture on it
            *turn left and reset that odometer baby, use your lower gears
and not your brakes
            *at 11.5 miles the road gets narrow,
            *at 12.0 miles take a right on the dirt road, follow signs to
the spot

Reasons to make sure to get there early:

        * Sunset on Saturday
        * If you get there before sunset Sabin has a special surprise for you.
        * The Exxon at Dry Creek Rd. closes at 9:30 pm (you need gas before
you start up Dry Creek)
        * If you come up during the day the drive is through beautiful wine
country
        * It is safer for you to drive the dirt road during the day
        * We want to spend more time with you =)




                        SEE YOU THERE................

             Huh???
                Umm, excuse me...  It's not me to post public flames on
the net, I mean we're a family... right???  
So when I read this post on the line up I was quite suprised to find
SJ's very own10BassT on a prime time slot.  Cool, I thought, I get to
check out my brother, Selector G, spin @ a rave again...  

Ya see, Selector G used to spin @ the LA massives back in 90, which ,
incidentally brought me into the scene...  

So, imagine my suprise when I found that NO ONE of the 10BassT crew
(Selector, Solrac, nor Milo) were aware of any performance this
Saturday, lest alone anyone from Cloud Factory contacting them.
---Not cool---
Well, I belive that if this is a different 10BassT, not the one that has
been named "one of the top 10 underground bands in the bay area"(BAM
Magazine), played @ Lollapaloza in 94', opened for Counting Crows at the
Fillmore or had various articicels written on them by Metro Magazine,
not to mention a new CD and tape relased this Tuesday (Do You Know the
Way?) then my deepest apologies...
But if not, then I feel that this post is just and fair.

---Adam
BTW: this email has been CC'ed to the appropriate 10BassT members and Im
positive they will be contacting you soon...

yo-

to the recently self-appointed posting police: chill out just a little.

we are about communicating ideas, not about enforcing structure.  the rules
of grammer, while making your ideas clearer and easier to the reader, also
have this nasty tendency to constrain your ideas.  when we start spending
more energy on the structure of our posts, that energy comes at the expense
of our ideas, thoughts, and other creative energies.

imho, this largely unexplored medium, (the internet) is all about casting
out the old structural ideas and developing new ones.  plus, many
individuals may have different ideas about how to structure posts and
communication.  so, deal.

that's my $2 (everything's expensive in south park)


on the other hand, we do need to be concerned about people's ability to
understand out ideas.  it's a fine line.

"creativity at the expense of netiquette"

Why iz everybody talking shit bout the tribez? I know. I think that 6 in-da
morning iz prolly mostly out for the money too. But hey. Screw it! Keep
your bad vibes to yourself.! And whats up with people throwing bad vibes at
me? I usually alwayz get a bad vibe at the ravez. I am Jeff... That one guy
that dancez like Bernie. You know. The Bernie on the movie "Weekend at
Bernie'z"..  I sometimes wear my cool red sweat jacket, and alwayz wear
black sweats. And da girls seem to enjoy watching me dance.You wanna know
why I don't hit on any of them girls at the raves.? No! It iz defonetly not
a gay thing!!! The reason being iz... Well ....  I am a freakin idiot,
thats why!!! Frankly, I don't know why. My jaw bone just locks up after
adding "E".... I have some kind of cronic shyness.... And it iz not
entirely my fault either,,,,, I mean.. The girls just come up and stand
near me. They don't say anything either... I am not stuck up, not gay, and
I don't have aids or nuffin.. I just need to be comferted or something.. I
could go on for dayz. But I need to go back to work. Work iz cool though..
Without it. Ravez would only be a dream. I am going to try and make it to
Ground Zero though.. Hopefully the Dj,z take turnz mixin old school tunes
(like they did last time) agian.
 But I do usually leave the rave thinking. "God,, I am SO stupid!! That
girl waz so beautiful.. And I let he get away" But oh well.. Hopefully for
me.. Good things will come to me who waits.. But I am not really waiting..
I am ready.. I just need a girl to rape me nStuff!! I will prolly take a
couple of baby tylenolz at Ground Zero though.. It feels SO GOOD to dance
on E, don't you agree?.....

peace out scout'z....
P.S. No this izn't an inportiant update.. But it got your attention didn't
it?

I'm still a big fan of Moonpup's set on the legendary Connection II
tapes.  For those who might not know, Connection II was an sfraves-sponsored
gathering in March of 1993 "where it rained so hard the needle made a wake
on the record."  Bob Ramstad did an awesome job of dubbing off six hours
of music to four cassette tapes which, if you look around, are probably
sitting on your friends' shelves.  I've just been relistening to them
again and once more am knocked out by the variety and taste in the music
and mixing styles.

I don't agree. If I can't read a post because it contains 1 page of
headers, three pages of quoted response, a half a page of quoted
signatures, and then the text of the message is a two page badly
formatted un-proofread uni-paragraph, then there's no way any idea
could possibly be communicated to me.

If I got drunk and slurred every other word, would you be able to
understand me? Of course not. How about a radio show with ten minutes
of ads for every one minute of content? Would you be able to follow
it? Not me.

Communicating ideas is also about presenting them in an accessable
form.  Look at the web, and how important it is to have a well laid
out web page. Matt, if you designed a web page that communicated
everything your boss was trying to say, but had a terrible layout and
interface, how do you think he would feel about that?

Although noone is perfect, using good grammar is imporant. Sometimes
it can be confusing or unclear to read something with bad
grammar. Especially with the written word, where other cues like vocal
inflections and body language are removed, it's a little more
important to be clear about what you're saying.

For the record, there are many people on this list who use good
grammar and have a good posting style (Mike (lachim), SDream, Randy
and many others!!!) and can express what they need to say very well,
with no "constraints" of any sort on their ideas. It's not an
"either/or" thing; recheck your boolean operators :)

I love flaming my friends!
Here's a happy *hug* for you, Matt :)

as always,
my 5 drachmas 
(I hope they don't shift the exchange rate) :)

love,
Steve

        I don't believe anybody as acting as a "posting police", people are
just giving their criticism - which can be positive, negative but in either
way constructive, not destructive.  Don't read everything with such a
bitter twist :) <- just a friendly advice.

I've thought about this question a lot. Pretension or no??- in putting up 
my flyers on the wall. Maybe even putting that much thought into it makes 
it even worse. But I think I put them up primarily to remember what went 
on.If my friends threw it, if I met rad people, or if weird things 
happened in association with that flyer, if the party was -the shit-, or if 
it is just too damn cute.Sometimes i have to wonder if I'm a poser or not but 
I think if I didn't have my flyers all of this would dissipate 
into one big blur (albeit ecstatic).

Yay!

No this is not the band of which I have now been paged twice by people 
involved with the band.  One of whom threatened that they could sue us if 
we didn't change the name.  Everyone involved with that band needs to 
take a chill pill man.  Two friends (one of them my roommate) made a live 
set for this weekend and just chose a name to play with.  This isn't a 
super huge mega rave, we didnt put that name on any fliers, it was just a 
name for a project this weekend!  I've never heard of this band 10BassT, 
I don't care to hear them, sorry for the confusion.  If you would check 
out our web page or meet us you would understand, we don't put names 
places and do bullshit like that.

Yeah great thanks, just what I wanted to get into record 
label/company/band bullshit calling me and nagging me.  Why don't you try 
calling me or emailing me first next time so I don't have to deal with 
these people's attitude.

thanks
drenalin

ps I'm serious about the record label/rock star bullshit I think it's 
lame and it sucks and I don't like dealing with it.  We're happy to 
pass on the message that my friends can't use that name, but this we own 
this name bullshit and the attitude that comes with it is really lame.

> I just wanted to say that I have zero respect for DJ ghost since he dissed me on a tape cover he made about 3 years ago....... 

I hesitated about mentioning this opinion of mine but it seems I'm not
alone (which means it's same for my feeble will to speak) so..
The way I always judge a DJ is by how appriciative (sp) they are of a
persons thanks for spinning that night and the job they did. Virtually
every time I have told a Dj: "Hey man you ripped it up tonight!!" They
always are very sencire and grateful that I took the time to compliment
their set. Example: Me:"Man that was a killer set!" Dj: "Hey man thanks!
I appreciate that!! I'm glad you felt it! " 

Here's what happend at the last Five party then I talked to Ghost.

Me: "Hey man that was a killer set!"
Ghost: "ya man thanks" (looking like I just asked him what time it was)

Oh and BTW, at that party they failed to keep the lines in control.
Which caused the Boys in Blue to pay a visit and take some lovley photos
to give to the City council to show them "what Raves are". Ghost and
security people spent 3 hours yelling at the top of their lungs for the
crowd to "back the fuck up". They used pepper spray on the crowd (which
does wonders for any vibe). I heard of worse things as well. But this is
what I observed with my own eyes.

     What kind of music do you like?
     
     I like a lot of different things, with my tastes leaning away from 
     house, disco and gabber.  I like really trippy stuff.
     
     Here's some juicy bits I picked up recently...
     
     Autechre > Tri Repetae++ (this is available with a bonus cd for a 
     couple extra bucks if you look around).  Gorgeous ambient, interesting 
     experimental, great working music.  Some good slow grooves, orchestral 
     stuff and staticy weirdness but mostly kickback stuff.
     
     The Mind of Goa > Various Artists (on 'Jumpin and Pumpin'/Passion 
     Music)
     Totally hyper beautiful goa.  Pretty solid all the way through.  No 
     real lemon tracks.  Worst piece on the album is the first track, and 
     it's okay.  I've been asked for so many tapes of this CD... 
     
     Funky Desert Breaks > DJ John Kelly
     I love this disc!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  It's the Moontribe sunrise sound 
     on CD.  Killer shit, from them notorious Full Moon Gathering events.  
     Los Angeles Breaks done right.  Nonstop hard hard hard!!!
     
     Hardfloor > Homerun
     Ahhhh!  This one is sick as well.  Funky acid sound throughout (grrr 
     grr grrr grrr 'blip! grrr grrooooowwwwwlll), from the people that made 
     it okay again.  Available as a double vinyl that sounds even better.  
     (their EP just prior to Homerun *DONT REMEMBER NAME* is sooo stoney)
     
     Meat Beat Manifesto > Their new one (can't remember)
     Slow dark grooves that step on me.  This is my turn out the lights but 
     I can't go to sleep disc.  Spooky and gorgeous.  I have the LP (double 
     vinyl plus extra 12"), but the CD is a double cd, and the first one 
     alone has like 20 tracks.
     
     LJT Bukem > Logical Progression
     Drum and Bass with gentle weaving melodies.  Really minimalistic 
     layers.  Almost an ambient album that you can dance to.  My couch 
     lifts off the ground when I play this one in the right mood.
     
     Hope that helps...

     Why iz everybody talking shit bout the tribez? I know. I think that 6 
     in-da 
     morning iz prolly mostly out for the money too. But hey. Screw it! 
     Keep 
     your bad vibes to yourself.! And whats up with people throwing bad 
     vibes at 
     me? I usually alwayz get a bad vibe at the ravez. I am Jeff... That 
     one guy 
     that dancez like Bernie. You know. The Bernie on the movie "Weekend at 
     Bernie'z"..  I sometimes wear my cool red sweat jacket, and alwayz 
     wear 
     black sweats. And da girls seem to enjoy watching me dance.You wanna 
     know 
     why I don't hit on any of them girls at the raves.? No! It iz 
     defonetly not 
     a gay thing!!! The reason being iz... Well ....  I am a freakin idiot, 
     thats why!!! Frankly, I don't know why. My jaw bone just locks up 
     after 
     adding "E".... I have some kind of cronic shyness.... And it iz not 
     entirely my fault either,,,,, I mean.. The girls just come up and 
     stand 
     near me. They don't say anything either... I am not stuck up, not gay, 
     and 
     I don't have aids or nuffin.. I just need to be comferted or 
     something.. I 
     could go on for dayz. But I need to go back to work. Work iz cool 
     though.. 
     Without it. Ravez would only be a dream. I am going to try and make it 
     to 
     Ground Zero though.. Hopefully the Dj,z take turnz mixin old school 
     tunes 
     (like they did last time) agian.
      But I do usually leave the rave thinking. "God,, I am SO stupid!! 
     That
     girl waz so beautiful.. And I let he get away" But oh well.. Hopefully 
     for 
     me.. Good things will come to me who waits.. But I am not really 
     waiting.. 
     I am ready.. I just need a girl to rape me nStuff!! I will prolly take 
     a 
     couple of baby tylenolz at Ground Zero though.. It feels SO GOOD to 
     dance 
     on E, don't you agree?.....
          
     peace out scout'z....
     P.S. No this izn't an inportiant update.. But it got your attention 
     didn't 
     it?

Thanks Anarch for the reminder.  Well this is the info I got from Socal
raves.  I've personally only been to 2 parties in SB and they were both on
the beach so this will be my first warehouse party in the area.  The people
are all great.  They crowd has an LA style energy with out the bad vibe.
Lots a jumpin' shoutin', whistles groovin' etc.  //if anyone wants to go
they can crash at my place in San Luis Obisbo (about an hour north of SB)
If they are promoting this heavily in the area well, I wouldn't know what
to expect.

We shall sEE
Peace!

Austin

Hey...

I went to my first rave around four years ago, it was in LA, and it 
sucked (I could not deal with the music at all).  The house was horrible, 
the sound wasn't that good, almost everything was horrible.  There was a 
lot of crank going around, and a lot of leather and attitude.  Everybody 
seemed either full of themselves or full of shit.

A friend, knowing how much I love music, started turning me on to some 
more recent techno last year, and by this year I started driving down to 
LA for raves.  I liked the music, and the vibe was good.  I started 
wanting to go to them more often than I could afford to drive.  So I went 
to one here.  Alone.  Wow.  I've been pretty steady ever since.

There are some crappy ass parties around here, and it's not impossible to 
detect them (the large flyer rule seems to be batting about .900 from 
what I've seen lately).  The small parties I've been to (200 or less) 
have all been mindblowing so far, and I'm really glad I started going.  
I've been floored by the people I've met, and they're some of the most 
amazing personalities I've ever had step into my life.  Geniuses and 
artists and lovers of life and closet philosophers gather together to 
enjoy togetherness and music and the notion that we've been missing 
something from our lives for a while.  I'm finding glimpses of it, and I 
think that's enough to keep me going strong.  I've been happier and more 
outgoing, in my life in general.  I've made it a point to stop being such 
an asshole and listen for a change.

You're all amazing, and if the scene was better a few years ago here, I'm 
impressed.  I don't honestly know if it would have been for me, so I'm 
glad to be here now.  I've noticed myself that as I start to get to know 
more and more people at parties that the experience is changing, but in 
many ways it's getting better.

You're all really groovin folks.

If there are 'posers' amongst us, you'll never know it till they move 
onto something else.  It's the ones who are doing it for the wrong 
reasons that will try too hard, and have the clothes, the attitude the 
talk etc down cold.  Hope nobody minds if I show up to one once in a 
while, and smile, dance, talk, laugh, smoke, sleep, wait in line for 
bathrooms, experiment, explore, touch, plan, share, eat, hug, listen, 
joke, philosophize, and daydream with you all.

Love,
AndyW

     I've got room for one (1) brave soul who...
     
     *  Can weather the elements.  Convertibles aren't for everybody.
     
     *  Doesn't want to pan out.  That's right... thanks to the crack 
     design staff at Suzuki, my super stock Samurai is jacked up to boldly 
     clear rocks and dips up to 6"!!!  Cool for that last hour of driving.  
     Did I mention it's 4X4 (sorta)?
     
     *  Enjoys really talkative drivers who tell bad jokes.
     
     *  Doesn't mind that the brakes make "a noise".
     
     *  Can tolerate a three hour drive with no music except your own 
     drumming/singing (not enough room for trombone).  My stereo got ripped 
     off a while back.  Portable player might work... I'll bring some 
     healthy portions of tapes if you have one.
     
     *  Warm fuzzy IMITATION cow skin seat covers.
     
     *  Is hoping it doesn't rain (I'll bring the top, but it's ripped, old 
     and generally hosed).
     
     *  Wants to find out what Saben's surprise is really bad (that would 
     mean earlier Saturday).
     
     *  Lives somewhere near the 101 between here and there.  Here is South 
     San Jose.  There is 'whine' country (are we there yet..?).
     
     *  Will pitch in for gas, oil, coolant, or any of the other things my 
     car needs to have replaced all the time ($10-$20 would be sweet).
     
     Please reply personally, unless you feel everybody should know you're 
     willing to accept such a pathetic offer.

       I thought some of you might, as did I, really desire to read this,
but 
       since it was just one big paragraph, my eyes said "AAAAARGH", my 
       stomach said "go to lunch, now!"  and my brain said "this does not 
       compute", complete with smoke coming out of my ears.  Really!
       
       Therefore, I have taken the liberty to double space this in
Microsoft 
       Word for Windows 6.0.  
       
       It may not be perfect but a bit easier on the digestive tract...

Just got this in the mail (big ups to John at Dancebeat!), and I 
figured I'd tell you about it...

First of all, for those who don't know, it's a double CD (if it
sells well, there will be a vinyl release. So buy this!!!) with some
of the best psychedelic trance to ever come out of Scandinavia.

CD #1:

* Timo Maas "Germany" - Not too speedy with a vocal sample that goes
round and round. Pretty good stuff. =)
* Joel Mull "The Runner" - More technoish stuff. A really slow track.
Not something for me, but that's just a matter of taste. =)
* Pagan Acid "Close Encounters" - Another slow track, this time with
an acidic sound that makes me go bonkers! 
* Kosmic B "Liquid" - Back on the psychedelic track, but still a bit
slow. This track is a killer though!
* Saia & Catha "I Whip You [spank me mix]" - This is a great track of
psych trance with some hard acid influences. Loses in tempo after a
few minutes, but then kicks back after some vocals (look at the title
and take a guess).
* Mirios "Insanity" - Ambient? Well, it sure isn't psychedelic. It's
a pretty neat track, but totally out of place...
* Planet Kaos "Sunburn" - Not headbanging but damn close. The melody
won't stop going around in my head. =)
* Pinocchio "Redline" - A slow starter, but soon turns into a major
stomper. Has ACID written all over it, and is headbanging.
* K "Simple Technology from Earth" - We're back in the land of laidback
beats. At least for a few minutes, then the fat beats kick in.

CD #2:

* Conundrum "Wild E" - Freaky techno, nothing I'd spin in front of a
crowd wanting to go crazy. After 5 minutes ambience sets in, and this
is probably the best part of the tune. Majorly laidback beats that make
you feel good.
* Joel Mull "Air Born" - Slow trance, but still pretty good. 
* Zack "Spirit 'n Soul" - WOO HOO! One of the fattest tracks on this comp.
Total psychedelic madness!
* Mirios "Trace and Trance" - TRIPPY is the first word that comes to mind
when listening to this track. Sounds like something Kraftwerk would come
up with had they tried to produce psychedelic trance. And just like most
of Kraftwerk's material, this ROCKS!!!
* Cut Off Frequency "High Position" - Heavy acid coming your way. And I
mean HEAVY ACID. 8 minutes of the same boring beat.
* Mirios "The Scale" - The piano riff is just SO beautiful! The rest of
the tune is a stairway to acid heaven!
* Bob Manning "Shine on You [bound 2 da bass mix]" - Starts off with a 
housy sample ('keep on stepping'), and just when you're about to give up
any hopes of it picking up, it turns into this mellow techno piece that
really makes you feel good. And that sample just keeps getting better and
better throughout the song!
* M-Zone "U.K." - How appropriate that the first and last tracks on this
compilation have names that are also countries. =) This track starts off
as a technoish thingy, but then develops into some kind of laidback hybrid
of techno, acid and psychedelic trance. Not bad, but not too exciting
either.

Altogether, this is a pretty good compilation of Scandinavian dance music.
The highlights are Planet Kaos "Sunburn", Zack "Spirit 'n Soul", and Mirios 
"Trace and Trance". If you like techno, acid and psychedelic trance, this
is a great compilation for you! And it's apparently being sold as 2 CDs for
the price of one! And as I said, if enough of us buy this, there might very
well be a vinyl release! =)

reespect, jonas

You know, there are many people in the country today who, through no
fault of their own, are sane.  Some of them were born sane.  Some of
them became sane later in their lives.  It is up to people like you
and me who are out of our tiny little minds to try and help these
people overcome their sanity.

Pounce, How's the rave scene? It's been a while.
Joke for ya.


	Two young guys were picked up by the cops for smoking dope and appeared
 in court before the judge. The judge said,

	"You seem like nice young men, and I'd like to give you a second chance
		rather than jail time. I want you to go out this weekend and
try to show 		others the evils of drug use and get them to give up
drugs forever. I'll 		see you back in court Monday."

Monday, the two guys were in court, and the judge said to the first one,

	"How did you do over the weekend?"

	"Well, your honor, I persuaded 17  people to give up drugs forever."

	"17 people? That's wonderful. What did you tell them?"  "I used a
	diagram, your honor. I drew two circles like this

 	         ___
	       /     \
	      |      |        O
  	       \ __ /

	and told them this (the big circle) is your brain before drugs and this
	(small circle) is your brain after drugs."

	"That's admirable," said the judge. "And you, how did you do?"
	(to the 2nd boy)

	"Well, your honor, I persuaded 156 people to give up drugs forever."

	"156 people! That's amazing! How did you manage to do that!"

	"Well, I used a similar approach. (draws two circles) I said (pointing
	to small circle) this is your asshole before prison.

8-10 inches of ground clearance is more than most 4x4 sport utility
vehicles, e.g.
	Ford Explorer      -- 6.7"
	Mitsubishi Montero -- 7.1"
	Subaru Outback     -- 7.3"

I guess this means that most of us normal car drivers won't be able
to make it up there without screwing up our cars.

Can anybody clarify if this is the case -- has anybody made it up there
with a normal car? Will I be able to make it up there in a Mazda Rx7??
(Probably Not :-( ). Hey wayne -- are you going?? How are you getting
up there??

Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com

        Well, I had an acrylic bar in my tongue the other day, and it kept
coming loose and falling out. Yesterday, the ball came off while I was
eating and I accidentily swallowed it (shit), so I couldn't find anything
else to put in place of the bar, except a long screw and a couple nuts.
Today  I went down to Zebra's and got me a new bar, but the problem is. . .
The screw won't come out! It won't twist, pull, or budge at all. I suppose
my tongue healed around the threads of the screw. Now, will the hole
eventually loosen up (it's slight;y swollen at the moment) and let me get
the damn screw out, or do I have to stretch it or somethin? Will sucking on
ice make my tongue shrink a little and loosen it's grip on the screw? 

        Anyone have any suggestions??? This things driving me nuts.

Speedy J's "Ginger" is one of those records (just one, dunno about his CD's)
for me. Very haunting. Joey Beltram's "Energy Flash" (12"), and Carl Cox's
double CD (mixed by him, forgot the title, check it out, they're pretty good).

Emphasis

Definitely my all time favorite is "Visions of the past" by Robert Leiner.
May be hard to get hold of here, I bought mine in Europe, it's on the R&S
label I think. I haven't come accross anybody who didn't appreciate that
record, no matter what their taste in music. He made some other stuff too
that's harder but still very well done.

Hello,

        Our friends, Tim (Whiskey Bottle Gotch) and Jeremy (listed in the
schedule as "10-Bass-T") were recently contacted by a representative of
"10-Bass-T" of San Francisco. Hence they will be performing as "FFT", so
please don't call them "10-Bass-T" because you might get them in trouble.
Oh, and if you know of any other "FFT", please let us know and they will be
happy to change their name again.

BTW, watch for an album and video from SF's "10-Bass-T" soon.

     Hey :
     
     Following on from Burning man & after a few drinks at a barbeque the 
     other night I'm organising a camping trip next weekend & would like 
     some help from some of your extensive knowledge base.
     
     I've got a genny, turntables, mixer : now all I need is some advice, 
     suggestions, offers of help.
     
     1. How much wattage would you recommend (outdoors) to appease a crowd 
     of around 40 people ?
     
     2. Where can I get said equipment from (cheap) ?
     
     3. Is an amp and two speakers all I need along with the decks, etc. ?
     
     4. Does anyone have any tales of similar experiences to relate to me ?
     
     
     Whoever wants to help is welcome to join the group. Send me a private 
     e-mail if your interested !
     
     Peace,
     
     
     Ciaran O'
     
     P.S. Does anybody know an Sfraver called "Micron" ? I need his 
     address. Hope to see some of you at the 215 party.

I have it on good authority that Scott made it in a mini-van, so it's
probably passable in a normal vehicle. I don't know if he'll get a chance
to confirm this or not...

Bart will work.  The location is 1444 Market Street.  I think Civic Center
is the closest station.  Does everyone concur?  

See you there (look for me at the Food Not Bombs literature table).

Hey all...
I've had something on my mind this whole week and I just can't come to
peace with it.  Maybe you guys can help me out with a little
reassurance...anyway, here's my story.
Last Friday I planned on going to the Ground Zero rave with a few friends. 
They dogged me (actually...their idea of a better party came up, go to a
park and drink until they pass out...whoo hoo ;P ) so I was asking around
at a book store/coffee shop that I hand out at in Livermore.  This girl
named Alaina who I had met just a few days before overhead my conversation
about my dilemna and asked if she could go with me.  I figured, what the
heck, she seems like a really open-minded person.  Let's do it!  So we went
to the party...got there at about midnight after getting EXTREMELY lost in
SF.  :)  We danced around a little bit (She doesn't like to dance tht
much...but me, on the other hand...can't help it when I start hearing the
beat! So that proposed a problem...) then I found a guy to buy some e from.
 I asked her if she wanted to try it and she said 'sure.'  So I asked her
again just to make sure and she still wanted some.  So I bought a few and
we went downstairs to buy some water.  I explained her the effects that she
should feel and the dangers of doing it.  She seemed like she was ready so
we dropped around 1:30.  We danced around a little more and just chilled on
a couch for a while.  Still waiting for the e to kick in.  Nope...bunk
doses.  Couldn't believe it.  Oh well.  I still wanted to dance...so I went
downstairs and danced some more.  When I came back.  Some guy was sitting
with her and talking to her.  I asked her if she wanted me to help her out
and she said yes to I very politely told the guy to take a hike.  :)  She
pulled out this little baggy and showed it to me while telling me that the
guy had given her a pill.  He said that it was extacy (sp?  Geez...I feel
really dumb right about now!) So she took it.  We chilled out for a while
longer and then all of a sudden she sat up and went "Oh Shit!  I'm feeling
it now!"  Then she got this big ole frown on her face and just sat back and
held her stomach.  I told her to calm down...just go with it.  Let the e
take over your soul.  It's a wonderful feeling.  She wasn't liking it at
all...After sitting next to her watching her eyes glass over and her
breating getting more and more rapid I picked her up and carried her to the
bathroom where she threw it up.  After she threw it up she told me she felt
fine and stood up and gave me a big old hug.  Then she thanked me for
saving her life.  I honestly don't think that I saved her life.  But she
can believe what she wants.  We went outside and danced some more (she said
she was feeling fine).  Then we went back upstairs and sat down on the
pillows.  She crawled on top of me and started talking to me while stroking
my hair and telling me how gorgeous I was.  I knew it was the e talking so
I payed it no mind.  Then she started kissing me.  I had been attracted to
this woman since I first met her so of course I kissed her back.  Then I
thought better of it since she was pretty fucked up and I had heard that
she was kinda sorta seeing this guy back home.  For those of you that were
there, you know that the last DJ didn't show so we left around 4.  I took
her home and haven't heard from her since.  No wait, I take that back, I
saw her the next day at the coffee shop where she gave me a quick kiss and
then ran off.  I was talking to one of her friends today about the Ground
Zero (here comes the point) rave on Saturday and she told me that I should
watch my back there.  I was totally shocked...watch my back at a rave? 
Why?  Why should I have to worry about anything negative happening to me at
a rave?  She told me that her self-appointed boyfriend (Alex) was on the
rampage after me since last Saturday when she found out what happened to
Alaina.  Anyway, my questions being...A: Should I even go to the rave
knowing that some thuggish wannabe gangsta is going to be looking for me
there?  B:  Does anyone have any other suggestions for Saturday night?  C: 
If you guys see me there with a knife in my back and a bunch of smashed
bicycle lights around me...please pull the knife out and stuff the lights
in my pockets...I'll probably need them at the next rave....  :)

Peace, Love, and many thanks for putting up with my incredibly thoughtless
waste of bandwidth for this post

OK OK Ok...
This is me...
My name is Jason Lucas.  I am a Computer Technician for CompUSA in Newark. 
I am fresh out of high school (graduated in June).  18 years old. (Please
paste nasty age/maturity labels here).  I have only been to four raves
myself.  Fortunately my first one being the Harmony rave about a month ago
up at the campsite in San Jose.  I went with about four friends who had
been going to raves for a while and fell in love with the scene.  I still
can't believe how wonderfully happy everybody is.  The sense of unity at
these events is so strong it can be felt for days afterwards.  I am about
5'11'.  Blue eyes, blond hair.  I live in Livermore (about 45 miles SE of
SF)  If any of you have seen me at a rave.  I usually go all decked out
with glo stiks and bike lights and a whistle to keep the beat if the sound
goes out (which seems to happen at every rave I have gone to). 
Well...that's me.  Any questions?

Well, Scott did make it there in a minivan with 8 people in it.  Many 
different types of cars have driven the road (including a large truck 
carrying a house).  The imporatant thing is that your car is reliable 
(especially your brakes).  If you think that your car can handle a narrow 
windy dirt road up (then down) a moutain then you should be A.O.K.:). 

yay! what an adventure...

When in doubt think PLANETARIUM!

I think Moonpup's set starts with a >sick ass< breakbeat song that says
"It's time to move..
It's time to move..
It's time to move..
it's time to get down with it!

Are you ready..
Are you ready to testify?
Are you ready?"

....

and for SpinSilver!

tape 1: open circle, Scott Hardkiss (43 min)
        closed circle, Scott Hardkiss (12 min) / Jon Drukman unmixed (31 min)
tape 2: # side, Jon Drukman (43 min) / sick ass (1 min) of Moonpup
        b (music note) side, Moonpup (43 min)
tape 3: one cross, Moonpup (39 min)
        double cross, Moonpup (17 min) / Lee (22 min)
tape 4: upside down A, Lee (45 min)
        inverted E, BLURrrr (45 min)

and whoever asked about that song says You Got to Show Me Love.. It's by
Robin S. "Show Me Love"  I mention it now because that song is on the
BLURrrr tape.. Who is BLURrrr anyway?  I've heard of everyone else, but
never in my time in SF have I heard a mention of BLURrrr before Connection
II.

hey everyone,

its been a long time since i wrote anything to sfraves.  since i got
filtering mail program (say goodbye to NRRs!) i've made it a habit to read
sfrave mail.  between finishing my 4th year in school and life.. there
hasn't been much time for dancing, but my soul is craving it!!

i'm thinking very strongly of going to stompy a week from now.  i haven't
been dancing in a while and stompy's crowd and music seem to do it for me.
stompy has a really diverse crowd.  i've never seen so many asians in one
club!  and i think townsend has a beautiful light system and clean sound
system early in the night.. i was fortunate enough to hear Johnny Fiasco
the last time I went to Stompy.  I guess i'll have to go out to stompy,
rest, and then to 'get down get down get down' the day after with Terry
Mullan, Johnny Fiasco, Mark Farina, Robbie Hardkiss, Steve Loria, Doran.

My question about Stompy is.. who's Merran from Club Heaven UK?  I've heard
Preston before.  I think Neon Leon has been around for years in SF right?
And is this Mauricio person local.. or is it that guy that makes deep
soothing techno?

i will try to go to both parties.. but i'll make it to at least one..

Yo Brotha,
	Chewing on ice one hour before going to Zebra might help. It helped me
when I got my stud changed. Also try an ant-inflamatory if your tongue 
is completely healed.
 Hope this Helps

Isn't the 1500 a domestic turntable?  I think you want to find yourself 
another 1200 (or 1210).  That said, who's complaining given the price....

Hahahahaha, Sorry about that I just had to laugh. I can just picture someone
with a big screw in there tongue and the sight is kinda funny. You need to get
that thing out ASAP. When the swelling goes down you might be able to get it
out if you, haha unscrew it. Sorry. 

The thing that might have happened was that the muscles in your tongue might
have started to heal in the shape of the screw. If and when the swelling goes
down you will have to unscrew it out of your tongue. Regardless of if it hurts
and bleeds you need to get it out before it get infected.

Next time use a paperclip, safety pin, nail, or kabob stick. Something straight
with no ridges on it.


Hope you get it out.

Don't forget about the CBC prop 215 party at 1444 Market street (@Van
Ness) going from 9.00pm-8am tonight.  Featuring the most diverse line-up
of dj's
at an SF rave for ages including Jonah Sharp of Spacetime Continium and
dj's including dj Flux, Ethan, Alex, Tracy, Astral Matrix, Mystery-E and
Mars, Polywog, etc, etc.  Please see previous mailing on this list for
more info.
As this is a benifit we are asking for a $10-15 sliding scale donation
which means that you can give what ever you feel right-just give
something.  It is also a 18+ no i.d. required rave.
Come along and support the most important Human rights issue to be on the
State ballot in years.
Tristan.

take the exit for 9th street which is now called the detoured Fell Street
exit (this exit is closed owing to earthquake renorvation work).  This
exit takes you all the way to market (about 4 blocs).  Go one bloc past
Market and turn left, park, and then walk back to Market and turn left for
Van Ness.  If you need more info page us at 415-220-4173.

I would like to extend out a sincere apology for that nasty letter that I
posted last night.

I realize that the whole thing is comprised of a whopping one paragraph
run-on sentence.  I hope all you can find it in your hearts to forgive me
for my unthoughtfullness.

Once again...sorry

Jason

     60,000 bits of information later, i am finally able to get to the 
     finest compliment i have received, well, lately!  Thank you, but i 
     really have to give credit to Microsoft Word 6.0.  I look forward to 
     the day when everyone will just remember to hit 
     
     return
     
     every once in a while.
     
     know what i mean?

       I thought some of you might, as did I, really desire to read this,
but 
       since it was just one big paragraph, my eyes said "AAAAARGH", my 
       stomach said "go to lunch, now!"  and my brain said "this does not 
       compute", complete with smoke coming out of my ears.  Really!
     
       Therefore, I have taken the liberty to double space this in
Microsoft 
       Word for Windows 6.0.  
     
       It may not be perfect but a bit easier on the digestive tract...

That estimate is probably a little high.  I think what Tim was trying to 
convey when he wrote that is that this isnt a sissy road.  There arent 
deep ruts, the only thing that might get some 'low' cars is rocks ons the 
road.  There have been small cars that made it up there.  My minivan does 
it no troubles at all.  If you've been to parties out in the woods on 
dirt roads before and you fellt comfy your car will make it.  Just make 
sure you have good traction and that you travel/drive at a safe speed and 
you will be fine.  

hope to see you there

love scott

I guess your tongue is screwed...  What would make you want to use that as a 
replacement?  I guess you're just a little screwy in the head, huh?  A 
little nutty?  Got a screw loose?  Bolt got your tongue?  Feeling a little 
rusty this morning?  Guess you're a real metal head now.  Bet you'd rather 
eat nails for breakfast than do that again.

Hi all!

 Well, it is my turn to return the favor that many have extended to me; 
I'm driving a passenger van to SF and can give rides to the City. Many 
hitches tho; I'm leaving Santa Cruz at about 6 pm and I don't want to 
wait any longer than that. Stopping in a city on the way is possible but 
only VERY briefly. And I don't know how long I'll be staying. I have to 
be back in Santa Cruz no later than 7 am. That is a very set time and no 
interference with that aspect of my schedule can be tolerated.

 So if this works for you, email me here or call 408.427.1666

Peace ya all,


Ran

A little poem I wrote for all of you...

 * * * * * * * *
As I woke up this morning, a frown on my face,
I thought to myself "My life's a disgrace."
The sky was still dim, the air still cool,
And my face was stiff with that nasty morning drool.

"I just hate everything" was all I could say
As I stumbled towards the bathroom to start another day.
"I'm going to brush my teeth, then get in the shower,
Then I'm going to get in my car and drive for an hour,
Over the Dumbarton Bridge, all brakes and stop and go,
Till I arrive in my hell of Shallow Alto."

As I stormed around the house, pissing and moaning,
I managed to hear the radio, out-shouting my groaning.
"T.G.I.F.!" said the DJ in his usual cheezy manner,
And I jumped with shock!  Where was my daily planner?
I flipped through the pages, past old days and weeks,
And when I found what I sought, I really started to tweak!
Much to my suprise, the dj was right:
It was Friday morn already, which means soon:  FRIDAY NIGHT!
So there I was in my skivies, at quarter to seven,
Shouting to the world "I FORGOT TODAY WAS FRIDAY!  THANK GOD, I'M IN
HEAVEN!"

The commute went quickly, and work has been fine,
Because I've been smiling quite broadly and dancing in my mind,
To the music in my head that no-one else can hear,
But the beats are strong and the 303s clear.
It's FRIDAY everybody, the week is finally done!
And with working out of the way, it's TIME TO HAVE FUN!
So I'll see you all tonight, at 215
Or maybe at PLANETARIUM...I might be seen
Regardless where we are or what we all shall do
HAVE A SUPER WEEKEND EVERYONE!  ALL MY LOVE TO YOU!

* * * * * * * *

Much plur to all my fellow corporate ravers!

Ariel
The Wee Li'l Document Specialist.

        See, one day, I was strolling through the park, yep. . . that's what
i was doin, and I came to this place to sit, it was a bench, I like benches,
and I said to myself, hey, you're stupid, why stand by a bench when you can
just sit on it, so I replied to myself, self, you're not stupid, you're not
sitting on that bench because you haven't got close enough to it to sit
down, if you tried to sit now, you'd just fall and hurt yourself, and that's
no good. So I moved to the bench and sat down, I was happy, but soon enough,
this girly came over and sat by me. She was a pretty girl, I like pretty
girls, so I just stared at her. I noticed she was uncomfortable with me
staring at her, I don't know why, it's just that whenever I see a pretty
girly, I think, mmmmm, pretty girl, uuuhuhuhuhuhhhhhh. . . and start to
drool profuc. . .profushus. . . profuvuous. . I started to drool , a lot.
Then time passded and She left. I was sad, I didn't like that, I said to
myself, self, you're stupid, whydin'tyamackondabitch, so I was sad, and I
cried. I guess I'm just too shy or something, or maybe it was that mixture
of crack, e, and heroin that did it, I always have a problem talking when my
jaw's stuck. But then this pretty little birdie came over and started
talking to me. . . 

blah blah blah

       Hello all you slick-stylee people!  I've been E-mail less for a
few months, but I'm back again!  I was formerly known as Juhstyn or JDub
or jus Justin Wilson, but now it seems I am Faust (the trickster, as he
was known).  So call me what you like, just don't call me on time for 
anything (I won't make it)!  
        Just like to say that I'm glad to be back in this hotbed of
politio-social discussion!  Plus,  I've truly missed all the good
feeling and representin' that people show here!  Keep the piles of smiles
moving like butts to a beat!

        Ok, point two:  Being that I have had to work the Ren Faire (if
you can call that work!) for the last 8 weekends, I have not been
partying at all!:(  But I heard through the grapevine that FnF is
throwin down on halloween. So how 'bout it? What's the mail-in
address? I missed the boat last time and wish not to be left out of
this truly special event!  Can anyone (Ethan perhaps?) give the
low-down?  Sorry if I am covering old ground here, like I said I have not
been partying and had no E-mail for months, until 3 days ago!
        Thanx in advance, and I hope we are all up to our ear balls in
funfunfun!

start trouble at the ravE nStuff.. If someone did they wouldn't be welcome
agian. And there will be some pretty big bouncerz at Ground Zero to.. I my
self plan on dancing all night. But I sure wouldn't mind if a girl wants to
jump on top of me in a bunch of fluffy pillowz.

: Hey all...
: I've had something on my mind this whole week and I just can't come to
: peace with it.  Maybe you guys can help me out with a little
: reassurance...anyway, here's my story.
: Last Friday I planned on going to the Ground Zero rave with a few
friends. 
: They dogged me (actually...their idea of a better party came up, go to a
: park and drink until they pass out...whoo hoo ;P ) so I was asking around
: at a book store/coffee shop that I hand out at in Livermore.  This girl
: named Alaina who I had met just a few days before overhead my
conversation
: about my dilemna and asked if she could go with me.  I figured, what the
: heck, she seems like a really open-minded person.  Let's do it!  So we
went
: to the party...got there at about midnight after getting EXTREMELY lost
in
: SF.  :)  We danced around a little bit (She doesn't like to dance tht
: much...but me, on the other hand...can't help it when I start hearing the
: beat! So that proposed a problem...) then I found a guy to buy some e
from.
:  I asked her if she wanted to try it and she said 'sure.'  So I asked her
: again just to make sure and she still wanted some.  So I bought a few and
: we went downstairs to buy some water.  I explained her the effects that
she
: should feel and the dangers of doing it.  She seemed like she was ready
so
: we dropped around 1:30.  We danced around a little more and just chilled
on
: a couch for a while.  Still waiting for the e to kick in.  Nope...bunk
: doses.  Couldn't believe it.  Oh well.  I still wanted to dance...so I
went
: downstairs and danced some more.  When I came back.  Some guy was sitting
: with her and talking to her.  I asked her if she wanted me to help her
out
: and she said yes to I very politely told the guy to take a hike.  :)  She
: pulled out this little baggy and showed it to me while telling me that
the
: guy had given her a pill.  He said that it was extacy (sp?  Geez...I feel
: really dumb right about now!) So she took it.  We chilled out for a while
: longer and then all of a sudden she sat up and went "Oh Shit!  I'm
feeling
: it now!"  Then she got this big ole frown on her face and just sat back
and
: held her stomach.  I told her to calm down...just go with it.  Let the e
: take over your soul.  It's a wonderful feeling.  She wasn't liking it at
: all...After sitting next to her watching her eyes glass over and her
: breating getting more and more rapid I picked her up and carried her to
the
: bathroom where she threw it up.  After she threw it up she told me she
felt
: fine and stood up and gave me a big old hug.  Then she thanked me for
: saving her life.  I honestly don't think that I saved her life.  But she
: can believe what she wants.  We went outside and danced some more (she
said
: she was feeling fine).  Then we went back upstairs and sat down on the
: pillows.  She crawled on top of me and started talking to me while
stroking
: my hair and telling me how gorgeous I was.  I knew it was the e talking
so
: I payed it no mind.  Then she started kissing me.  I had been attracted
to
: this woman since I first met her so of course I kissed her back.  Then I
: thought better of it since she was pretty fucked up and I had heard that
: she was kinda sorta seeing this guy back home.  For those of you that
were
: there, you know that the last DJ didn't show so we left around 4.  I took
: her home and haven't heard from her since.  No wait, I take that back, I
: saw her the next day at the coffee shop where she gave me a quick kiss
and
: then ran off.  I was talking to one of her friends today about the Ground
: Zero (here comes the point) rave on Saturday and she told me that I
should
: watch my back there.  I was totally shocked...watch my back at a rave? 
: Why?  Why should I have to worry about anything negative happening to me
at
: a rave?  She told me that her self-appointed boyfriend (Alex) was on the
: rampage after me since last Saturday when she found out what happened to
: Alaina.  Anyway, my questions being...A: Should I even go to the rave
: knowing that some thuggish wannabe gangsta is going to be looking for me
: there?  B:  Does anyone have any other suggestions for Saturday night? 
C: 
: If you guys see me there with a knife in my back and a bunch of smashed
: bicycle lights around me...please pull the knife out and stuff the lights
: in my pockets...I'll probably need them at the next rave....  :)
: 
: Peace, Love, and many thanks for putting up with my incredibly
thoughtless
: waste of bandwidth for this post

Well..  The JK sound system was used at Harmony.. And everytime I goto a
ravE with the JK sound system. Yes the music has stopped, or a speaker was
blown. Anyone going to Ground Zero will prolly get a kick out of the first
speaker they hear blow up, after reading this msg.

ended up going to 150 Fulsom.. It was some kinna record release party.. Was
that the CCC one?

Yeah, one time I was hammering some barbed wire through my earhole,
just to see if any chunks of brain would come out the other side, cause
I was hungry for some food. And instead of coming out -- it got stuck!
So I used the clawhammer and pulled like a mothafucka and it came out
along with a big chunq o' brain. OOOh that smarts! But now I'm happy
all the time and want to hug everything in site, especially fluffly
lil' sheep. <sinatra>bleating in the night... oh how i love bleating
in the night</sinatra>

PS: someone who knows about this piercing shit suggested -- between
howls of derisive laughter -- that you ice your tongue (a lot) to
reduce the swelling. Then get your ass to a piercing shop (gauntlet or
body manipulations) and let them do the rest. They in turn will perhaps
refer you to a clinic/doctor for antibiotics or further treatment. The
swelling might be due to infection, and/or allergic reaction (hope the
screw wasn't nickel plated). If you're too embarassed to show anybody
-- are you a member of the darwin club?? -- don't try aspirin to
relieve pain or reduce swelling as it will also prevent blood clotting.
Perhaps you might try some over-the-counter ambesol (lydocaine) to numb
your tongue, then use a vice-grip and pull/twist real hard (remember,
righty-tighty, llefty-loosie) ... of course, if you cause major trauma
to your tongue you could bleed to death, especially if you are taking
any aspirin products (try tylenol or advil perhaps). Please take
pictures for us and put it up on the "evolution in action" web site. 

PPS: I am not medically trained you should not take this as official
medical advice. in fact, I think tongue/genital piercing is pretty
stupid but that's just my opinion. it's all fun and games till someone ...

A friend of mine just called me to say that he heard on the radio that
Dennis Peron, founder of the Cannabis Buyers Club & lead organizer to pass
Prop. 215 in favor of medical marijuana, was arrested at his apartment
early this morning, in connection with his CBC activities.

I don't know if he will still be speaking at the Prop. 215 event this
evening, but it should be interesting no matter what . . . see ya' there!
This Deadhead Raver will definitely want to speak with John Perry Barlow,
1st Amendment defender & lyricist of most of Bob Weir's original Dead
songs.

That "it's time to move . . . are you ready to testify" is Lionrock's
"Are you willing to testify" which samples an old MC5 track, I believe.
They were heavy into the "revolutionary" White Panther rhetoric in
addition to being a kick-ass guitar band in Detroit circa 1970.

Fresh stack of Jungle plates for anyone interested...
--------------------------------------------------------------
Paul Z, One small step, Prophesy recordings

An excellent mellow 12" perfect for the beginning or end of a night. One 
Small Step is a chilled steppy track with nice sparse bass and apollo 
moon mission samples. The flip is a gorgeous little song with almost 
housy synth stabs. Armchair music at its best.

NU EMOTIONS EP, Smi)e recordings.

Domestic jungle? who would've thought...actually, all of the 4 artists 
here are known. Jamie Myerson supplies us with a typically lush piece 
filled with plenty of heartstring tugging pianos. Sub Zero offers us 
Pressure, a standard though energetic ditty with a female vocal line. DJ 
DB and Tommy D weigh in with an interesting Acid/jungle song. Finally, 
Jason Mouse finishes up the EP with a banging jazzy choon called Better 
World. Solid stuff, I must say...

Art Of Noise, Camilla.../Something always happens, Indochina

Remixes from a forthcoming album in which drum'n bass artists pay homage 
to a classic synth/electro band. This 12" has Doc Scott doing a super 
mellow 2-step version of Something... with strings that just keep going 
and going. J.Majik pulls up the rear with his patented apache break in 
full effect. Fluffy, but nice.

Roni Size, Brute force, Full cycle

Finally found this one. A banging tune from one of the UK's most 
prolific artists. Brut force is dark and mean, yet mysterious and 
soothing at the same time. Has a great breakdown halfway thru. The flip 
side, "secrets" is a pretty standard Roni Size affair: minimal and deep.

Q-Project, The instrumental/solar system, LGR

What you've come to expect from LTJ Bukem's label. A side is an amazing 
journey through melody bliss. The drums take a while to kick in, but 
once they do, the strings cut out and the mood is REALLY dubby and 
bouncy. The flip is a housy jungle track, but lots of fun to mix. Big 
Ups!

Omni Trio 8, Trippin on Broken Beats, Moving Shadow

Mr. Haigh puts out a nice but predictable track. His bass lines have 
been getting more and more funky with time but unfortunately, I can't 
sit with the diva samples. The flip, though, (Soul Of Darkness) is a 
remake of an old choon, and i found this one to be outstanding. Steady 
breakbeat drums, melodic bass and a cool african sounding vocal sample 
for a change.

St. Etienne, The Sea (PFM rmx), Heavenly records.

No review needed. Buy it before it's gone. Everything you've come to 
love about PFM is present here.

Promo- Juice #8

2 Deep minimal steppy tracks. One side has simple shuffle-step drums and 
an entrancing bass line. The flip has a bit more action going with weird 
sounds pulsating thru the speakers. As the song says,"this stuff is 
dangerous"!

Agent K & Majistrate- 2 for the show, Brain records.

These guys can't fail. A side is a cool jump-up track. harp intro is 
sweet and innocent, but the bass, my friends, has other ideas! Halfway 
thru, after the break, the drums go wild! simple simple simple, but so 
good! Flip side is almost as good, but sticks to one steppy beat. Both 
are monstrous trax.

Underworld- Born Slippy (Alex Reese rmx), Wax Trax

Finally got released domestic after Trainspotting became such a hit. Mr. 
Reese shows a lot of restraint, peeling away the "euro" feel of this 
song and going straight downtown with the vibe. Oi Renton!

Brown #1

I know nothing about this 12", but I guess that's the beauty of buying 
records. Who cares about who made the track as long as it does the job. 
2 experimental hardstep trax. A-side is just a bit too dark for my 
taste. Flip side, though, is a masterpiece. A really cool rippling bass 
line wobbles up and down thoughout, while a chill indian vocal snippit 
pierces the air. Interesting AND playable.

Trunk 2, Step to the Edge, Secret History

The second trunk record is an interesting turn for this duo. "Step..." 
appears in two incarnations, one energetic, versus a more dubby option. 
Neither is particularly original, but the programming is solid. The 
b-side set the tone perfectly with a female vocal sample which repeats: 
"Hello, the aliens are coming" again and again. massive! The song breaks 
into a mellow bass heavy journey which has a pleasent old-school feel. 
Recommended.

Tortoise, Galapagos 1 (Spring Heeled Jack Rmx), Thrill Jockey

A wonderful remix of a wonderful band. In case you haven't heard, 
Tortoise is THE SHIT. In the 3rd remix of their last album, SHJ take a 
bluesy guitar piece and turn it into a stormer- contrasting peaceful 
melodies with a quirky analogue bass hits. A perfect set closer.

see you next time....

Hey sfravers, what's up?  It's me again, and it's unfortunate that I can't
come up to go to Planetarium.  It's the funds.  :-(

Anyways, if anyone happens to be down here in the LA area, are any of you
guys going to LOVE?  I know it's supposed to be tomorrow night (Sat).  It
would be great to see some of you San Francisco faces.

Hope to hear from someone up north soon!  

If not, have a WONDERFUL weekend!!!!!!!

Many hugs....

:-)  Karen

"Let me have silence always in the centre of the shouting, that is
essential. Let me have silence so that no pin may drop and not be
heard, and not a whisper. Escape us for all our spouting, nor the
needle scratching upon this gramophone of the circular cosmic spot.
Hear me, mark me, learn me, throw the mind's ear open. Shut up the
mind's eye, all will be music. What sculpture of sound cannot, what
cannot as a fluid token words, that nothing else cannot."

Hell yes!!  Some of the best junglist dj's in the world are going to be
there (alongside some american phatties if I do say so myself) - dj RAP from
the UK is going to play for crissake!  I would fly to london just to see
her.  amazing devestation on the turntables.  I hate commericialism and wish
these people wouldn't charge so damn much, but even with this exaggerated
prices, I hope it's the only large rave that night, because I want to see
everyone together in one place... In Seattle the halloween (saturday) raves
are the biggest of the year...  uhm hey I just delurked.  Ooops.

>>huh?

In case anyone else was confused...

A dissection of my poem:

Rave music is beat oriented.  Ravers sometimes play with toys...
   teddy bears,et.al.
Allen Ginseberg is a "beat" poet known for his fascination with young boys,
and his role in the NAMBLA (N. American Man/Boy Love Assoc.)

Ginsberg's gen was known as the beat gen
So is ours
Let's make some noise (rhymes with boys and toys)

I'll be there.  Come say hi.  I have brn shoulder-length hair and brn eyes
and am 5'4".  I will have glow-stick glasses that I just found somewhere. 
They look kind of interesting and are the only thing I can think of that
might be distinctive.  I hope to be dancing maniacally because I haven't
since Harmony.  One definite place to find me is in front of the
turntables when Gabba Dave spins.  I have a secret affinity for really
fast music. :)

See ya'

Howdy all...

On of my buddies (an aspiring DJ) who isn't on SFR yet wanted me to see if
anyone had the following to sell....He wants to start spinning for friends @
house parties and is looking for a basic setup. If anyone has or has been
down that road recently and can suggest something for the up-and-coming dj
;) or may be looking to offload their equipment to upgrade, please give him
a call. He is a *really* great guy, loves the music & the vibe, and would be
*very* appreciative to rap with anyone about this...
You can either call him @ home or email me back privately.

Rhett (415)-928-7956

this is what he's looking for (suggestions welcome!)

2 12" or 15" woofs w/mids & tweets in speakerbox
1 500w amp

Thanks,
look forward to grooving with you all real soon.....  =)

I am thinking of buying a Fatman from Paia electronics, it costs 170
bucks. Ive heard that it is a tb303 clone. Does anyone have experience
with this equipment? Would it be a good place to start as far as the first
addition to my computer to make som emusic? thanks for any advice! :-)

Hi Lara!!

  Yea, HOME BASE is the bomb! Did you goto Mega Buzz One? They opened up a
whole new HUGEFATDOPE warehouse that night. I was more than impressed.
  IF i go to Ground Zero (Not sure yet, friends are wimping out) But if I
go, I will be wearing my cool bright red sweat jacket, black sweat pants,
flashing/rotating bike lights from fry's (optional). You can't miss me with
that jacket on. It has that reflective material on it. 
  And hopefully I will be in a dancing mood. Not sure becouse: My tooth is
like really messed up, and I have been popping alot of Tylenol to kill the
pain. And well, Tylenol really tirez your system out.
  I don't socialize much at the ravEs. But it iz only becouse I am like
that at night, I have sum kinna cronic shyness disorder on top of that, and
I am usually E'in tornadoes! But I shore wish some of you ladies would
actually do what you seem to be thinking when watching me dance.
  Welp, I just got off work.. And it be time to: "Fire it Up"

Later skater!
Jeff

I'm going to Prop. 215 tonight.  I live at SF State and will probably be
going alone.  If anyone lives nearby, I'm planning on leaving around 9:30 or
10:00 taking public trans.  I'll check my mail right before I leave so if you
want to join up with me that would be cool. 

I'll be wearing my hair in lots of little buns, black satiny pants with a
reflective strip on the sides and a light blue vinly halter top.  So, if you
see me there say hi!

LOve,

             Megan               Czefir

Wrong mailing list! Take this as constructive criticism. Everybody gets

man!  i just caught this little article about raving on that show Real TV. 
Apparently the drug of choice at all raves is nitrous!  They seemed to
only want to show people who were all a) on about four different drugs and
b) VERY young ... like grade 9.  But whoever was spinning in the 
background of the "underground video" :) was actually very good ...  I 
just found the whole piece very frustrating.  Especially the lady who was 
introducing the article .. "Well! that's one party i'm glad I lost MY 
invitation to."  :P

Sorry - just had to rant a little.  The media annoys me so sometimes.

I'm having one of those nights.  So lonely, & that unpleasantly familiar
feeling of something missing.  But that's not the point...

I actually wanted to apologize to the people I saw at the Proposition 215
thing.  I wasn't very friendly, I know - I'm feeling really withdrawn &
down.  Sorry 'bout that.

Hope you all are having a better night than me.  Take care...

Hey!
Who's doing what tonight? 
Where's the action @?
Where must I go to in my quest for the phat beats ? I might have some 
neophyte types with me. I would love to give them a taste of what the 
S.F. scene is all about. I would appreciate any feedback, suggestions.

		Thank you all

I think that the whole rave scene IS very tribal, regardless of the 
technological fantasylands that we tend to immerse ourselves in when 
attending raves.  There is a difference between tribal and religious 
ceremony.  Small but it's there.  :)  For me the whole thought of 
"tribal" involves small groups of people who join together at larger 
events to affirm their basic one-ness - kind of like a Star Trek 
convention ... or even a big Cub Scout meet ...

And don't all of us ravers, in one way or another, "worship" technology? 
We may say nah i'm not a slave to it but if you could never ever ever hear
a really yummy track again as long as you lived cos there were NO
turntables i bet you'd be pretty miserable fo a good long time.  I'm glad
we have all sorts of funky gadgets to make life more amusing, personally. 

And the whole experience of going to a rave is fairly ceremonial, at least
going to the large ones ... getting your tix ...  locating the space ...
preparing your gear for the night so you have whatever you might desire on
hand ... choosing the clothes/headgear/footwear/to glitter or not to
glitter?  :)  and then oftentimes GETTING to the damn thing is an 
expedition in itself ....  everyone has their own little pre-party 
rituals. 

I like raving because of the tribal feel ... like we all are a bunch of 
different tribes getting together on friendly ground for a great big 
stompfest to celebrate individuality and friendship.

suggestion 1-  don't go to ground zero... there will just be a bunch of 
               homey-G's and gangstas circle dancing there.  if you want	
	       to go to where all the friendly people will be, goto outa 
               sight or planatarium (those are the two that stick out in 
               my head, although there could be more)

	       I have yet to go to a party and come home the next day 
	thinking, "Gee,  the music wasn't that great last night, and I 
	don't think i saw anybody smiling all night, and there wasn't a 
	place to sit comfortably, and water was 3.50 per bottle,.... but 
	did you see the size of the 3-D robot??? It was just incredible! 
	I just wish more parties could be so cool..."

	it's the people, the music, and the vibe that bring me back 
	every weekend... 

suggestion 2-  try not to blame yourself for what happened.  If you ever 
	       see Alaina again, try to talk to her about... 
	       communication is the key you know.  Ask her 	        
               to have her buffalo-boyfriend tamed.

just my advice

The Fatman sounds more like a MiniMoog than a 303.  If you're looking for 
the 303 sound, buy a 303.....Nothing (at least that I've heard) can even 
come close to the sound of a real 303.

I can attest to that. If I'm thinking of the same Alan, then I met him at
Charity and he really is a cool guy. We kicked it just shooting the bull
for about an hour after the party was long over.

Greetings,

Yet another PHAT party at The Loft...   Shakin booty all night long to the PHAT
House sounds of Mark E. Quark...   for his "Going away" party....    Good
luck in
San Francisco Mark....

And for all you SFRavers up in the Northlands,   WATCH OUT for Mark E.
He'll rock
your sox off..... You got some good DJ'in to look forward to.

Being that I live at the Loft (Well,  not officially of course),   but I
have to say this
party WENT OFF BIG TIME....  I was dancing my ass off all night,  and after
taking a
break from all that House music exposure I've had from San Francisco,  I
have to
say,   this is the finest and PHAT'est house choons I've heard thumpin from
those
speakers in a long time.

The vibe was excellent,  and considering the amount of work that Fletcher
and the
Loft heads had to do to get the 4th floor ready for this gig is nothing
short of
amazing.  I mean,   just hours before the party,  the 4th floor was a disaster.
We jokingly call it the Demilitarized zone....

Also,   Fletcher took my advice and hung the turn tables from the ceiling,
and not
ONE record skip (Except a few places where the Dj or someone standing nearby
caused a musical "glitch")....  A few strange "pops" were heard
occasionally,  but it
was hardly noticeable.

Also,  that same evening,  at the World Beat center,   Ron D. Core was
hammering
out some SICK hardcore,   but those people who went there,   eventually
wound up
at the Loft.

It's really strange,  yet wonderful to live in a space and have 500+ people
dancing
and having fun in your own living space..    Ahhh Yes!!   RAVE HEAVEN....
If I can't
get to raves,  have them come to me....  :-)

Hi, 

I never thought I would be asking this,but; could everyone who sent me
mail yesterday or today plese re-send it?  Why?  Because Slip.net
SUX!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Along with the re-send could you beam some of my unhappy vibes at the
clowns who promised me that everything would be okay by Friday,
1:15pm;(when they probably had full knowledge that it would take them 30
hours to recify the crash....)  They won't even pick up the phone during
technical support hours!

I could have had a whole new ISP by now!

Slipnet sux, (did I mention that?)

ps If you know anyone who works there, kick them in the ass for me.

        First of all, please don't jump all over me for considering Ground
Zero.  I was just wondering if anyone knew the prices for either Ground
Zero or Out-A-Sight?  I'm guessing that GZ is in the $20 range. I have no
idea about Out-A-Sight.  It's my friend's birthday so HE gets to choose
which one we go to.  If he chooses GZ, so be it -- it's his birthday.  Any
price info ot there?  Thanx everyone.

Jose

Hey everybody,

        This is Matt and Greg and the rest of my roommates are out of town
for the evening. I was wondering if anyone is up for maybe going out to
Out-of-Sight, and if so, would you like to meet up there. Please respond
back and leave your number and I will call you back. If you know my number,
then give me a call.

Peace, Love, Harmony,

        Matt 8^)

If anyone read the front page of the chronicle today you will see that the
net went down all over the bay yesterday! Why? because of two rats that
chewed into some power cable, setting off a chain reaction accross the
bay...stanferd needs to keep the rats out of their computer labs! ;-)
It is likely that this is why your network was down yesterday..

T,

If I has an ISP, and I had a major problem, like say; two rats that
chewed into some power cable, crashing my main server, and setting off a
chain reaction across the bay, perhaps I would let my customers KNOW
THAT. Perhaps I wouldn't tell them the problem would be fixed in the
next 30 minutes.  

I would let people know what happened, and suggest that they choose a
hobby outside, in the beautiful Indian-summer day, rather than cling to
their keyboards counting the fucking minutes until its fixed!  I hate
the fact that an ISP thinks I need to be lied to in order to keep my
business.

Slip.net needs a kick in the ass for not having the presence of mind to
IMFORM their clients; and, for not picking up their phone during listed
technical support hours!

I think you are indeed correct, sir.  However, the sample is also used
on the Lionrock one -- in fact, it uses about 30 seconds of it, really

Unless you get lucky at your local yard sale, plan on spending $1500-$2000
for a real 303, though. I hear the Syntecno TB303 clone is closest thing.
Caveat: it's from Europe, direct mail only, but I have some email info
coming to me in about a week that I can forward if anyone's interested.

It goes for around $650. For $550, you can get the Novation Bass Station,
which is still a nice little acid box IMHO.

Hey, here's some keyboard in the round party reviews of 215...
Members of the board:
Steve (that's me!), Sarah Aberant (my grooovy housemate), Ryan
(Sarah's friend from Canada).

Steve: music kicked ass. Ambient jungle in the basement was beautiful.
Theta Blip had a killer set, but he should have been earlier. I was
too tired to handle the intensity of his set at that hour. Ethan was
spinning opposite and delivered the perfect set :) Too many floors;
too much walking; the energy of the place seemed very scattered.  The
after-party at Steve & Sarah's (hey, that's us!) capped off the night
perfectly as we watched the sunrise from the roof :) And thanks to all
for giving a listen to saturn5 - it was fun playing to other people

Sarah: music was yummy. mars and mysterE- yipeeeeeeeee!! they really
know how to get a crowd goin. couch in the elevater looked fun, tho 
i didnt get a chance to ride it =( party seemed to die around 530, 
but dats ok cuz i was tired. too much dancin not enough sleep. too 
tired to think now. time to sleep. 
sunrise was beeeeeoooootiful. 

where were ya matt??? we missed ya.

Ryan: woosh -- i'm from toronto canada and this was my first party in SF and
i was kindly impressed by the overall vibe which was warm from the moment i
stepped in the door until i left -- lots of variety in the music, and a
great feeling of purposefullness to the night ... party left a tad early, but
i danced so hard earlier that i needed to sleep anyways.  love the city,
hope to be able to come again for a longer period of time soon... 

love and phleas,
Steve

some of the new boxes like the syntecno sound similar to the 303 but none
so far have come close to really emulating the 303.  the clone boxes
do not have a sequencer on board and so you have to drive them from an
external sequencer.  the way the 303's internal sequencer drives its synth sound
making features (oscillator, filter and amplifier) is what makes it unique.
the clones have the same (or close enough) basic synth (osc, filter, amp), but
you would have to spend a lot of time using a external sequencer to make a
novation pattern sound like a 303 pattern.  what a pain...  also, the 303's
totally user-hostile UI and flaky buttons make it easy to come up with random
patterns, which sometimes are insanely good :)

the cloners are getting close (even roland is a cloner nowadays), but without
the 303 sequencer (or a way to emulate it) and the randomness, people are still
gonna want the 303.  i do have faith that someday, someone will be motivated
enough to really clone the 303, but so far, no dice.

for a starter synth i would recommend a used korg poly 800, casio cz-101
($100ish), sequential circuits six-track ($300ish), or even the novation with
the keyboard.

The fact that there are many, many millions of people who take the media 
as the gospel truth is EXACTLY what annoys me about the media and their 
evil manipulations!

pounce

You know, there are many people in the country today who, through no
fault of their own, are sane.  Some of them were born sane.  Some of
them became sane later in their lives.  It is up to people like you
and me who are out of our tiny little minds to try and help these
people overcome their sanity.

Ok, I went to see my friend spin and that was cool. BUT i have never seen
such a huge Circle for circle dancers. Sorry Ghost but if your on the list...
Having two women dance in cages next you is really tasteless. The vibe was
OK.. Stupid funny story: My friend was getting water from the water fountain
and I told him not to cause it was nasty water....I also pointed to this guy
and said" YOu will end up like this freak right hear...this dude is a
wierdo!" Well i thought it was a friend of mine, but it turns out to be some
gangstar!!! AHHHHHH! I almost got my ass kicked... I had to do a lot of fast
explaining!! Well overall I wasn't to pleased with this party.. I went in
with a negative attitude thinking all gangsters(from Concord,Wayne!;) would
be dancing in circles.. I was partially right! Anyway.. I like the power bars
for a dollar Vlad... Especially when they are those little chocolate or
vanillia pies tat cost a quarter in the hostess section!! Really
energizing,(suger!!) Well uh, My opinion is Somebody in this crew has a small
penis and they really need to make upfor it wth a lot of bad hype!!

ENGAGE FLAMES OR AGREE WITH ME!!!

You know, there are many people in the country today who, through no

them became sane later in their lives.  It is up to people like you

people overcome their sanity.

Yes, I'm going out again tonight. This time, look for a tall
darkhaired (shaved head though) guy wearing a REALLY green
shirt. Or a white skivest, I still need to make up my mind.
*grin* Just walk up to me and say HI or whatever. As always,
any Swedish words equals extra credit! =)

And oh, be sure to say happy b-day to my friend Dan! =)

reespect, jonas

does anyone know where I can get copy of Fontographer 4.0? I need a
font-making program that candle handle imports from A. Illustrator
(fontographer 3.x SUCKS) so I can (rave-related part...) make more flyers!
yeah... that's it... flyers. Pretty fuckin' rave-related, aren't I?

If you have it, and want to share it, send a copy to steveO too 'cuz he
wants it.

BTW: who (other than jon) went to ground zero last night? I want to make
sure I get a good, balanced range of ideas on why it SUCKED. =)

OK OK OK...flame me all you want but I had a BLAST at Ground Zero.  This
was the biggest rave that I have gone to and I loved it!  There were so
many wonderful people there.  I was mostly walking around outside, just
talking to all the people (everyone was trippin' off my spinning bike
light).  Then I went inside and danced my booty off, I even dropped my bike
light a few times, and someone actually followed me all the way across the
room to give it back to me!!!!!  I met some wonderful women there too...It
seems like there were a lot of high school kids there, but I didn't mind. 
They were all dancing their a**es off like the rest of us!!!  Bottom line,
had a blast.

<<<Rave On!!!>>>

P.S.:  Heard DJ Ghost spin for the first time.  This man is AMAZING!!!
       Everyone told me, don't give him any props, he's an arrogant
       sunuvvabitch, so when I was watching him, I was trying to catch
       his vibes.  He seemed like he was a little arrogant in the way that
       he dresses and the expression on his face.  But when we all started
       whistling, he just looked up and out into the crowd and the
       phattest smile busted out on his face.  It was great to see that he 
          
       was having just as much fun spinning for us as we were having
       dancing to his beat.

Ok, so this was a lot bigger than last week's CCC party. But was it a lot
better? Well, read my "review" and you might figure out how I feel. =)

When we got to HomeBase in Oakland we were met by a HUGE line. Ok, standing
in line isn't THAT terrible. But then the security people started letting
girls walk past all the guys. Excuse me for not being from around here, but
WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT ALL ABOUT??? I thought raves were all about letting
people be who they are, and not putting anyone in front of anyone else. But
I guess that doesn't apply to high school dances (oops, I mean RAVES) in
Oakland.
We did get in after about 45 minutes in line, and the place is not bad for
a rave. In fact, it's a REALLY cool wherehouse. Two "rooms" separated by a
not-too-thick wall. In the big room some hard 4-beat with lots of drum'n'bass
was being spun. I have to admit that I liked the first 2 hours of it, mostly
because of the fat acid beats that were dropped with all this breakbeat.
Then, at 2:30 or something, I made the move into the smaller of the two rooms.
In this room, the room progressed from hard techno to 4-beat and hardcore
during the wee hours of the night. Big ups to whoever was spinning in there
at 3:15am for dropping MARRS' "Pump Up the Volume". Too bad 75% of the crowd
were too young to know what it was. I've never seen so many trainspotters
trying to get a glimpse of the record currently being spun! =)

The crowd yeah...Well, I guess there was nothing else to do for Oakland
teenagers
last night. A high school crowd means two things...gangs wandering around
trying
to look a lot cooler than they really are, and girls all dressed up. I most
definitively do NOT have a problem with the second part, but who'd want to pay
$25 ($20 with a stuffed animal or toy!) to walk around and look cool all
night?
Not me. But most of the crowd seemed really up for it. And no wonder, the vibe
was really good, and so was the music. If you don't happen to think that 
breakbeat is dead. =)

Oh yeah, $2 for a bottle of water! ARGH! Put a f**king tap and let us drink
from
it, we don't need the "good" stuff!

Altogether, a great night. I apologize to all those who tried talking to me. 
When you stand 10 feet from the speakers, it's hard to hear what people are
saying to you. =)

reespect, jonas

Here's something that I found interesting. For people that connect on high 
bandwidth. Wouldn't recommend it if your modem is anything less than a 28.8.

PopFlash
http://www.pop.com/

It's my second week sending out this newsletter about the HotWired
Network's arts and entertainment section Pop, and I've got good news and
bad news.

The bad news is we had to cancel a planned feature that included videos of
Pop staffers doing a striptease while throwing virtual money that literally
flies out of your screen and turns into real money. We just couldn't get
the techology to work right. The good news is we are posting a special
multimedia show, made for Pop by The Future Sound of London.

This feature, which posts on Monday, 14 October, is a sort of surfing
safari. As you listen to 20 minutes of original techno music in RealAudio,
photos and images made by the band (and quotes from interviews) flash on
your screen. By the way, the show runs for a few weeks, then disappears.
So if you want to see it, don't wait too long.

Also coming up this week:

Monday, 14 October:
TeeVee: Harmon Leon tells you all about the new fall shows -
so you don't have to watch them.

Tuesday, 15 October:
Reading: People treat computers like humans and even favor boy computers
over girl computers, as John Alderman discovers by reading the new book,
"The Media Equation."

Wednesday, 16 October:
Music: Rob Levine sticks up for Jon Spencer's faux blues, plus remix
music from Freaky Chakra vs. The Single Cell Orchestra.

Thursday, 17 October:
Movies: Mike Tanner dares to complain about Mike Leigh's
much-loved "Secrets and Lies," plus Barry Levinson talks about "Sleepers."

Friday, 18 October:
Multimedia: HotWired tech expert Mike Kuniavsky explains the problem
with electronic arts festivals.

One last thing: Pop is one of the sponsors of the Low Res Digital Film
Festival, which runs at The Kitchen in New York this week. If you go,
please stop by the Pop booth, so I won't have to sit there alone. And if
you're not in New York, you can see short film clips and hear audio
interviews with the filmmakers on our site.

The Low Res Feature is at:

     http://www.hotwired.com/popfeatures/96/34/index4a.html

See ya,

Michael Small, producer of Pop

hello all-

after doing a lot of thinking, i think that i'm finding myself going the
same path as larry ching (having to significantly cut down on the raving for
a while and focus on some other things).

why, do you ask?

well, i find that my priorities have already shifted without me knowing it.
the past 4 weeks, i've wanted to go raving, but something has gotten in the
way every week.  coincidence, or is that my brain trying to tell me something?

plus, i'm finding that raves don't mean nearly as much to me as they used
to.  i love the music, i love the people(i'd like to do a list here, but
that would take far too long), i love the energy, but it's just not speaking
to me any more.  i need to find out why, and to find what will speak to me.

so, i shall restrict myself to the parties that are most special to me (fnf,
f8, harmony), and embark on whatever journey it is that my mind is calling
me on.

love-

matt

The rave was put on by by Ghostribe, I heard that this is what they do at
all their raves...Another testiment to their sexist/arrogant/a$$hole image.

I did notice that there were a lot of little wannabes walking around
throwing attitude as best as they could.  and there were TONS of little
e-babies strutting around trying to find the circle dancers with their
fresh-fly sportswear!  :)

Did you miss the water tap right outside the door by the smart bar????
How about the fountain in the chill room?  If you held down the metal
thingie in the middle...it shot out a stream that you could use to fill up
your bottle!!!!  :)  But be careful, the water in the fountain gave me the
squirts!!!   :P

You know what, I feel the same way! I've been pretty quite lately, and I havn't been to 
a party since Harmony's 3yr! So that's about ONE WHOLE MONTH WITH NO RAVING! I went to 
parties every weekend straight from 4/20/96 to 9/14/96!! So like, I need a break now. 
I've been concentrating on school now and I need to get my ass in gear!

Sorry if I havn't seen or spoke to my fellow friends in a LOOONNNGG time! So, I'll save 
myself for F&F or maybe another party. So.. My break has made me miss all you people...

...But don't worry... you'll see my ass on the dance floor soon enough...

Dear Friends & Family,

	For everybody complaining about sportswear at raves, here's a
brief historical tip on where to direct your ire:

"In the late 1970s the American designer Norma Kamali was instrumental in
bringing sportswear into the fashion arena, introducing sweatshirting
ra-ra skirts, bandeau tops, jumpsuits, leotards and leggings.  Stretchy
Lycra yarns, developed by Du Pont in 1959, were in use by the 1970s and
did much to improve the appearance and fit of sports and fashion clothes.
Another significant originator of the sportswear trend was the reggae
musician Bob Marley, who appeared on stage in football gear and tracksuits
from the late 1970s.  By the early 1980s tracksuits and training shoes had
become a fashionable uniform among young urban black youth and were
subsequently adopted by both sexes and all ages, as comfortable leisure
wear."
	-_Costume & Fashion_, pp. 272-273, by James Lavar, (C) 1995

	Now you can give Senor Marley's mural the evil eye when you're walking 
up Haight Street.
   
Much love,
				<<< Starchild >>>

No way! The way he dropped it was almost as classic as when DJ Anti dropped
"Numbers" by Kraftwerk in the middle of a set of headbanging psychedelic
trance at a rave in Gothenburg, Sweden, this summer. =)

First let me tell you I've decided to come back, I just couldn't leave all
you wonderful people. You all are great.

This weekend was amazing. The 215 party was PHat with a "PH". 5 or 6 floors
with some really good DJs. Great vibe, and great people. Mars, Mystr-E,
Ethan were throwing down some killer sets, but the one that really warped
my mind was DRC. She spun one HELL of an awesome set. Had me going the
whole time.

I'd love to see another party at the CBC again.

Saturday night I went to a little party at Stanford. Well it wasn't so
little in the beginning, but just about half way through the night half of
the people left and then that's when the real party started.  I had a blast
at both parties. I'm really glad I went out this weekend.

It was as great to see you back :))).  I wish we talked more at 215, but I
guess I'll see you out soon.

hey......it's 6:30am.......The clocks buzzing..I look at it and the first
words out of my mouth are a big "FUCK!!!"  Where was I during the last 36
hours????

I thought I had died an gone to rave heaven...A party on a hilltop,360
degree views that only god could make to remind us to be humble,love nature,
love each other and the MUSIC.  An such music "that would bring tears to the
eyes of the Angels."  Roughly translated, this means "da bomb!!"

I want to thank Joe Rice for needing a little sleep on Sunday morning, and
letting me spin for about 50 minutes.....it was the first time I had played
anywhere other than my living room...I couldn't have asked for a better spot...

I had crawled out of my tent after two hours of sleep and forced myself to
go over to the other music just to see Joe..or see if he was still
playing..I tried to hear some of all the 20 or so dj's playing..he was
asleep, and I was toasted, and barely awake enough to play myself......I
cannot begin to review them all now..I've got a hot bath and coffee waiting
to get me to work...

I was wearing my trusty Ameba dayglow rave shirt for those I didn't get a
chance to meet...

But, to the Cloudfactory crew...Much love and respect, thanks for letting me
be part of the party....andmy deepest bow of respectand offering of love and
appreciation to all the dj's who played and played and played....for future
reference, those of you who were afraid to brave the dreaded 9 mile dirt
road that killed 4 cars..."the harder a party is to get to, the better the
party is gonna be"...

                                              More later......SpinSilver

Happy Monday fellow ravers,

I'd like to say that Prop 215 was one of the most insprational,
mindlifting, thought provking, and just pretty danm good party I've been
to in a looong time...  Between dancing, chatting, breaking away for
some time in solitutde and all in the span of about 10hrs...  Really
good time.  DRC had a real ripping set,  MARS, Mystr-e, @ Ethan did some
fine selections in the trance genre.  I also liked the DJ that spun a
jungle set early on 'round  9:30 or so...  

Highlights:  
		Chilling out with a couple of fellow DJ's discussing the trance scene,
prop 215 itself as we
"We get it..."
ll as the rave culture in general.
		Dancing in a Capoeria circle w/a fellow artist (that's always fun).
		Coming back to this reality and realizing that you've been dancing
almost 5 hrs straight...

Lowlights:
		Having to see the party end.
		Saturday - with the soreness associated with it.

The remainder of the weekend was pretty NRR but interesting never the
less.


---Adam

Hi!

 Well I really wanted to go to Planeterium but my circumstances prevented 
that. Happily the 215 benefit was really fun. For me the best part was 
the crowd. Very aware and diverse crowd who were all there to support a 
vitally important issue; personal control of our own medical care and 
medication [at least that is how I read prop 215].

 The building was a labyrinth of rooms with something for everyone, 
including a live band room. As it was my night off I mostly took it easy. 
Danced to some cool techno in the basement and missed everybodys set that 
I really wanted to catch :(. But that was okay as I met someone who it 
was important for me to meet. The two of us spent most of 4 to 5 hours 
talking about interwoven realities and the light beings who becken from 
beyond. She is a student at Berkley who is attempting to construct a 
major she calls transpersonal psychology.

 It was very cool to run into Steve, Wayne, Marcie, Jonathen and Sharron 
(!?!), Tim, Dutch, Raven, Owen and a few others I'm having trouble 
recalling at this moment.

 Big thanks to my hosts earlier in the evening; the dinner really hit the 
spot and as usual the magick was flowing.


peace ya all,

Ran

this is true. it's things like these, or the Haight St. Fair, that are a
reminder of just how big this blanket term of alternative, or freak,
culture really is. Myia even brought her mom along.

usually whenever I feel too much spectator energy being thrown around at a
party i find myself getting really resentful. it's like, "Fuck you man,
i'm not your Home Entertainment System. you've got muscles, use them."
but this was different. we were guests, or maybe just a novelty act, in
someone else's home/culture. didn't find myself getting resentful even
once that night.

showed up at around 2 to help set up. by 4 i had cleared out most of the
3rd floor and was stoned. by 6 Denis was out of jail, the story had made
ABC news, and i was baked. by 8 i was helping Tristian with the basement
and was comfurtably numb. the music started at around 9:30 and that's when
i moved on to my pharmaceuticals. all in all, a good night for many.

hanging out with Doug in the trance room, i mentioned the high turn out of
raver superheroes that night and Doug goes "yeah, we've all become 
figureheads." and i laughed. but thinking back on it he might of said
"yeah, we've all become pawnheads" or even, "yeah, we've all become 
fishheads." i don't know, we were both pretty fucked up.

What a space that was!  SIX floors o' fun...although it seemed to me
that the basement, 1st & 3rd floors were the ones to be on...Although
the CHILL space on the 5th floor (literally: the room had to be 20
degrees cooler than the 1st floor) was nice.

A good night and a good crowd, although I have to say it:  I really
like trance, BUT I AM STARTING TO FEEL OVER-SATURATED.  DRC's set was
amazing, honestly, but you KNOW you've heard too much trance when you
start thinking "this is cool, bu-u-u-u-u-ut..."  I spend some time on
the third floor which was nice, but there were some folks with
attitude going on...There was one guy in warmup pants, a white
wife-beater tanktop, fisherman's hat (can we say "CYPRUS HILL,"
kids?) and SUNGLASSES who I was this-->  <---  close to saying "well,
you've got the ATTITUDE to dance, but I haven't seen you move ONCE,
asshole." to.  But I didn't.  (tee hee)

It depressed the hell out of me that everyone cleared out at 5 am or
so...seeing as how I was straight-edge clean for the evening (going
to a prop 215 party not even STONED?  how ironic...) and I was
suddenly surrounded by cracked out folks who were just waiting to
sober up before the drive home...What happened to parties that go
strong until 9am?  It felt like a ghost town by 6!  One minute there
was NO room to dance on ANY floor...next time I checked there were 4
people dancing in the main room.

I have to apologize right now for my slightly negative filter to this
whole night: I realized when I left that I was just over-socialized
and needed to NOT BE AROUND PEOPLE for a while.  You can imagine how
being burnt out on people and sober and tired would make for a wee

ahh!

sorry, this got slightly NRR, my apologies!

I have a Syntecno TeeBee 303... pretty fuckin killer. Has accent, has
slide, same oscillator, same five potentiometers as the 303, plus full MIDI
control over all the above, plus 4 midi to CV gates each of which you can
assign its own midi channel... tough little box.

Key differencee as noted, is the sequecning UI, I know the box can make the
sounds but figuring out what the hell it looks like in studiovision is not
easy... sigh.

FORWARDED MESSAGE from Ariel Stallings (ASTALLIN @ SMTP 
{ASTALLINGS@gcwf.com}) at 10/14/96 9:22 AM

What a space that was!  SIX floors o' fun...although it seemed to me
that the basement, 1st & 3rd floors were the ones to be on...Although
the CHILL space on the 5th floor (literally: the room had to be 20
degrees cooler than the 1st floor) was nice.

A good night and a good crowd, although I have to say it:  I really
like trance, BUT I AM STARTING TO FEEL OVER-SATURATED.  DRC's set was
amazing, honestly, but you KNOW you've heard too much trance when you
start thinking "this is cool, bu-u-u-u-u-ut..."  I spend some time on
the third floor which was nice, but there were some folks with
attitude going on...There was one guy in warmup pants, a white
wife-beater tanktop, fisherman's hat (can we say "CYPRUS HILL,"
kids?) and SUNGLASSES who I was this-->  <---  close to saying "well,
you've got the ATTITUDE to dance, but I haven't seen you move ONCE,
asshole." to.  But I didn't.  (tee hee)

It depressed the hell out of me that everyone cleared out at 5 am or
so...seeing as how I was straight-edge clean for the evening (going
to a prop 215 party not even STONED?  how ironic...) and I was
suddenly surrounded by cracked out folks who were just waiting to
sober up before the drive home...What happened to parties that go
strong until 9am?  It felt like a ghost town by 6!  One minute there
was NO room to dance on ANY floor...next time I checked there were 4
people dancing in the main room.

I have to apologize right now for my slightly negative filter to this
whole night: I realized when I left that I was just over-socialized
and needed to NOT BE AROUND PEOPLE for a while.  You can imagine how
being burnt out on people and sober and tired would make for a wee
li'l grumpy gruver.  So, instead of hanging with my family of friends
in Berkely, I went home alone, took a shower and slept the morning
away.

ahh!

sorry, this got slightly NRR, my apologies!

     This reminds me of the first circle dancers i saw at the gathering 
     newyesars thning on dec 31 1992 at solano? county fairgrounds.  it was 
     raining.  i remember that.  it was definitely raining.  we stood 
     outside for like 1 1/2 hours in the cold, it hadn't started raining 
     yet, and when we finally got in, it was completely packed.  
     
     when i entered the restroom facility, the floor was covered with about 
     1/2 of water that had overflowed from (somewhere) |(  yuck  
     
     there were circle dancers 
     
     there were couples procreating everywhere.  some of them you wanted to 
     join in, they were gettin pretty heavy.  
     
     that reminds me of the drive back in the rain.  this was only the 2nd 
     party i had been to and i was feeling, well, good.  we fit 5 of us 
     into tiffy's little black car and listened to 'inside the mind' for my 
     first time.  wow.  
     
     those were the days.

WOW!

A great word to sum up this party and the cloud factory crew.  They did an
amazing job setting up and they have the most incredible vibe.  I rarely
meet a group of people that throw parties that i am so impressed by. Thank
you SO much for the fruit, COFFEE, and muffins in the morning. A VERY nice
touch...hey guess what the water and coffee were FREE, what a strange concept.

The party....
Well first i'd like to thank everyone for driving up there because those of
u that did made my night! I might a lot of cool people and some from
SFraves..Finally! the spot was amazing..atop a mountain in the middle of
nowhere.

The sound system atop the hill was great and the other one pretty good.  The
music and dj's were amazing.  I actually danced sober for quite a while. I
got to see alot of dj's i normally don't get to...thanks for the tunes.
There were also 2 good live acts.

Hello to all my new friends and THANKS..i had a BLAST.

Such a GREAT VIBE there!

much PLUR
Micron

chill out jeff... Its just annoying seeing people's personal mail going to
SFR... I'm not trying to police it because there's too much "gray area" in
what shouold or shouldn't go to SFR, but there's definitely some stuff that
just straight up doesn't belong there... like alot of the shit that's been
posted in the past few days: "I'm going to dress up like a raver!" "All
theez girlz iz gotz to be getin with me'zzzzz" etc., etc., etc... Now's
about the time of the year when all the new college freshman discover that
they can do e-mail for free without learning any decent netiquette. (this
was me 1 year ago, so don't think I'm trying to sound uppity or anything)
Please, everytime crap gets posted to the list it wastes my bandwidth, my
time, YOUR time, and bogs hyperreal down even more and fucks up sfraves in
ways that can't just be solved with the delete button (i.e. bounced
messages, overloaded bandwidth, etc.)

So take a big fat gelcap chill pill and smile, because SFR can benefit
everyone but not when it's being abused.

BTW, this discussion shouldnt even be on the list. It finds its way there
far too often... I'm not going to post about it after this one teensy
weensy note (sorry kids!)

Jeff I'd like to meet you some day, because often people come accross in
very wierd, unlike-their-true-selves sorts of ways through e-mail.

smiles and such,
-m.

Hey, same situation down here!  I haven't gone to any parties since I
left the Bay Area back in August!!  For now my concentration is on
school, but you don't even know how much I miss getting out on that
floor, hugging my friends, and dancing my ass off!!!  

So, when I do come home for vacation, you can bet what a natural high I'm 
going to get when I hear my music.....

Many hugs......hope you all had a spectacular weekend.......

Hi hugz@pacbell.net!

  Feelings of panic..  What I mean is:

       A few dayz after E'ing, I alwayz get these high ang.. enziaty..
engziatie... (PANIC) attacts..  Like for example... I will be in my car
driving. I want to get into the next lane, so I put my blinker on, but the
car in the lane I want to go into starts to speed up. Either I can cut him
off now, or I can wait for him to pass. No biggy.. But when I get these
panic feelings.. It's like once I notice him creaping up, I feel all light
headed and confused (only for a sec) almost like a feeling of panic. It's
weird. Another discription: I can envoke this feeling by closing my eye
lidz and moving my eyes around rapidly, this also creates the "rush" panic
feeling.
       Oh and. I also get some really weird back painz.

	Okay, okay, I know I'm lagging concerning this thread, but you 
didn't go on vacation and have to return to 2000 rave messages.

	I just have to put in my two pence worth (or $25 worth as might be 
the case)...this party SUCKED.  Aside from trying not to get shot by a 
gangsta, dehydrating to death because the moron at the door took 
everyones water bottles (so they can make money selling theirs), getting 
bored by the live acts, the worse offense is when they took my bottle of 
hand lotion AND, get this, took away my _contact lens eye drops_ (thank 
God the girl behind me in line picked it up and sneaked it to me 
later--<hugs & more hugs> to you)
	I don't bitch concerning these things, but going for my eye drops 
was a bit over the top.

	Where was the chill out?  There were supposed to be a bunch of 
rooms, but I only saw three areas.  I basically spent the whole night in 
the room with the black lights and the cool trancy music.  It was not 
worth the price I payed for only one room of music.  This experience 
really questioned my image of the SFRAVE scene.  However, I realized it 
was just a bad pick out of many good ones (remember not to judge a rave by 
its flyer kiddies), and I tried to make the best of it.  If you were 
there, I was the fanatic in line with the two bright blue glowsticks 
jumping up and down and yelling "Jooooaaaannnaaa."

	I second that motion.  I am not going to go into detail about all 
the great scenes here on the continent because this isn't the group for 
it, but his point is extremely valid.  I find tolerance and an open 
mind to be extremely important in a persons character.

	And a note about sLEEzA, if you ever get a chance to go to one of 
her tapings in the studio, you would be disgusted beyond outrage.  I went 
once when I was still in high school (you know, to make money for some 
club or sport thing cause they had to pay us to have a captive audience --no
really, I'm not a geek, honest :) , and could never watch a sLEEzA episode 
ever again....

SFRavers,

Pacific Bell Internet is still looking for Technical Analyst positions
(A.K.A. Phone support for an internet service provider).  This place is
growing so fast that they can't hire enough of us... call up the phone
support number and you'll see what I mean (800 708-inet)... be prepared to wait.

All you need to know is Win95, Win3.x and some Mac.  The staffing supervisor
sits right next to me and she said that as long as you are a computer geek
and know windows 95, then you have a damn good shot.  No experience is
necessary... I didn't have much.  They have a two week training program that
you can learn just about everything you need to know.

Check out the job description.  It sounds really technical... but none of it
is really required.

       http://public.pacbell.net/jobs.html#techan

Call Mitra (staffing supervisor) @ 278-5928
 or me @ 278-5121

Good Luck!

Thanks, Mike. If for some reason you have a need to spout off random
thoughts to a bunch of ravers, try V-Rave, hyperreal's online chat:

telnet hyperreal.com 7283

Or check out http://www.hyperreal.com/raves/vrave

So now, you have two choices:
1) Saying something *interesting* that 500 people might want to read
while at work: post to SFRaves
2) Spouting out random ramblings: chat on V-Rave

simple, no?

Hi Andy ... I went and didn't have much fun.
Sadly, it's been so long since I've been in the Acme that I didn't realize
that's where we were headed until it was too late. It was really the same old
Acme; a dirty, overcrowded firetrap with holes in the floor you can see 
through. The music was house, house and more house, and only the sound 
system on the main floor was at all adequate.
Not worth $12 IMO.

take care,
Dan

> I've been pretty quite lately, and I havn't been to a party since Harmony's

Gosh, I haven't been to a "party" since Burning Man, so that makes it 
almost a month since I've been to anything.  I've been getting into some 
other outside interests as well.  For over 2 years, raving has been my 
main outside interest, and now I have about *4* new outside interests and 
now raving is sorta taking a back seat.  Of course, due to my geographic 
disability (soon to be remedied!!!) and lack of money to make a trip to 
SF every weekend, I usually only go to one rave a month anyway.  If they 
are cheap (as in $10 or under) I usually go to more than one a month.  We 
out-of-towners have to consider extra expenses that you lucky locals 
don't have to worry about.  :):)

> So, I'll save myself for F&F or maybe another party. 

Me too.  I am hoping every single day that you all involved with F&F have 
come up with a space for the party.  I'm not exactly in the mood for 
Funky Techno Tribe.  I only wish I could be closer to help out.  Only 2 
more months and I will! (that's when Mel and I are moving to SF!!)

The other party I am definately going to is Tom's party 2o12.  Hell yes.

love,
Amy

It was COOL!!!  When I realized it was at Acme I began to panic and thought I
had made a major mistake in my plans for the night but I decided to trust
there would be no fire or earthquake that night.  Their was neither and I had
an awesome time.  I don't really know if I ever heard Doc Martin.  Everytime
I would ask someone who the current DJ was they always said it was Jeno.
 This was from the time I got there, 11:00 to when I left at 4:00....now I
don't know if that is really true or not so if someone who was actually
paying attention could report what dj's were playing at certain times it
would be nice.  

If anyone cares to know I was the girl with chopsticks in my hair.  I spent
most of the night in the very bottom floor because it was MUCH cooler so I
didn't reallly see everyone.  

I hope everyone who went had a good time.  I also had a good time at 215 but
I left kinda early, 2:30, because I was really tired.  It was nice to have
toilet paper in all the bathrooms for a change and the cannabis club was a
nice place to have a party, lots of nice people.

Love,
           Megan               Czefir

i have been worried lately that the kids aren't into house anymore, but
jon, jeno and doc rocked their boxes...  the music selection really
reminded me of wicked.

i eventually had to bail around 6am cause it was so damn hot.
it's just not healthy to be dancing in a sauna.

Okay. I'm kinda sad. I just moved up here from orange county. I loved 
the L.A. party scene, I made so many friends and there was always a good 
vibe. The music was great too. I was so happy to come up here because 
everyone always told me how great the sf parties were, that they blew 
away the LA ones.
When I came up here I went to Mega Buzz one and the vibe was kinda bad. 
I think what started it was the fact that within the first half hour of 
being there I got grabbed about 30 times. That's not what this is all 
about! There were all of these little boys running around grabbing 
people and trying to hook up! Also I noticed a lot of gangsters. I 
thought I was gonna get killed. I thought it was just because it was 
such a publicized big event, but all I read about in every e mail here 
is about gangsters and circle dancing and "mateing rituals". Is it this 
bad all the time.

Girl, you are just going to the **WRONG** parties! Believe me when I say 
that most of the huge massive are like that and the smaller parties are 
not.  Go to the smaller parties, that's my advice.

Dear Ms. Tee,

Check out Beautiful People/Harmony parties. They hit me with the silly
stick every time.  Pay attention to what folks say online about upcoming
events...you can get a good idea about what the turn-out *might* be like.
Also, contact jondabomb@aol.com for info on a warmvibey party he's throwing
on November 15.  Jon's da bomb but he won't grab your butt.

You like bigger parties, you say?  Check out 2nd Chakra (put on by Nexus)
on November 9.  Their parties are larger but nice.

Big flyers do not a good party make!

Don't give up on us.  You'll probably need to do a little bit of homework
on the local scene before you figure it all out.

Love,

b))merang

kaytee,

NO!  It's very good!  The list has just been spending a bit too much time 
lamenting the diversity of parties in the area.  I started raving with 
Harmony, Charity, and Sunset.  Great Vibes.  The Prop215 party this last 
weekend was also a blast.

Don't let the negative posts paint the wrong picture: SF knows how to 
rave with positive vibe!

peace and love,

deeje

Hey, anyone else feeling like there were slim pickin's for parties
this weekend? Okay, 215 was pretty good (despite the mixed vibe), but
Saturday night? No way. No good parties (IMO, of course) happening
(unless you were up for the road trip style party). And no *Sunset*?
arg!

I personally could use some good tunes tonight! And it looks like they
will coming from the Bahia tonight...

As a side note, Sarah & I caught a view of the Bahia Cabana last
night...  I guess it was salsa night. So creepy to see salsa dancers
groovin' at a raver party spot :) Imagine a death metal show at the
Acme; it was sort of like that.

Whats up with all this Gangster stuff?
 I see alot of people at the big parties that look like gangsters yea. But 
they don't start no trouble. Whats with this stereo typing? Poor people, 
can't dress the way they want with out being classified. And if they really 
are gangsters, give them alittle credit! They seem to be respecting more 
than 50% of the venu'z rules.
 As far as grabbing a$$ez...  Most girls seem alittle more loose at the 
raves (correct me if I'm wrong). Hell most of them that approach me seem to 
want me to be that blunt or rude. I bet that azz grabbing stratagy works 
more than it fails.

  Now don't get me wrong or anything.
  There's no way in hell "I" would indulge myself in such temtations. To 
grab someones booty like that showz you have no respect for women. AND no 
respect for yourself. You might aswell be one of though weirdo'z that 
masterbate in public!
  And I have seen one fight started by "what appeared" to be a gangster at 
a rave. I don't think that all should pay for the acts of the one.

I do believe that this "RAVE" scene iz making a difference in are 
community.
But if all of us start casting out people becouse of the way they look. 
Were going to end up back at the beggining agian.

P.S. Bad spelling, bad timing, and to much calls at work made this letter 
alittle less readable and understandable. Sorry.

I totally agree with you on that.. Smaller parties are SOOOOOOO much

        San Francisco, and the parties that surround that area are the
epitome of what raving is all about.  I've only been there twice, and both
parties I attended are on my top 5 list ( near the top :).  This time it was
Planetarium, thrown by those spectacular Cloud Factory people.
        What can I say?  This party was fantastic.  The location was
brilliant. I don't know how many people I talked to that told me they had
never seen so many stars in their entire life.  And the sunset/sunrise!  I
won't even attempt to describe them in words.  I didn't even know the sky
could get that beautiful. 
        I couldn't believe the Dj'ing that was happening that night, either.
My belief that 80% of the really good DJ's in the world haven't even played
a party yet was confirmed.  People I'd never even _heard_ of were simply
kicking my ass up and down that mountaintop.  I don't know how I'm going to
deal with some of the shoddy spinning around here that passes as "good" now. :)
        The real reason I'm posting, though, is for the people I met.  I
showed up at the sight at about 10:00 on Friday night and knew maybe 1-2
people there ( aside from those I drove up with ).  By the time I left at
12:30 on Sunday, I had around 20 beautiful new friends.  You all down there
are simply amazing.  Never before have I met such a large group of
accepting, embracing people.  Absolutely breathtaking.
        So, to wrap this up, I'd like to ask all those that I managed to
meet, and who are on this mailing list, to get in touch with me.  I don't
want to lose contact with any of you great people.  Always know this, too.
You _have_ a place to stay if you are ever in Eugene, OR ( yes, we do have
parties in Eugene, OR :).  Take care.  I love you all!

Hugs,
Beau

PS If any of you know Shakti ( who lives in Eugene but was visiting for the
weekend ) then _please_ get in contact with me.

Dere Mizter Croop,

Well spake.
 I was at Grownd Zero thiz weekend...one of the kidz I was with couldn't
ztand it, hated the "vibe", but ya know, to hell with it.  Techno music
rulez, no matter who'z danzing.   We're tapping into something really heavy
with this music.  The more kidz danzing to techno, the better better off
the world will be...someday, I hope.

Keep da vibe alive, dewd.  You rock.  And Ztuff.

Ah...
The Bahia was playing Salsa well before MAD was ever there, I can 
guarantee that. We should be thankful that they were receptive to having 
a "raver party spot" like MAD in the first place. See you all tonight!

Oh and,

  I forgot to mention in my last reply that.
  I have had my butt violated four times now. All by (what appeared to be) 
women. Ofcourse each time, they made it look like they tripped (accidently 
bumped into me) or whatever.
  But don't worry. I am not offended when my booty iz violated by girlie 
girlz.

  Keep it up!    =]:...

The only real event I've been to here in the bay area since I moved here is
Harmony.:)  I didn't realize how important raving was to me until I really
had to work to get to one!! In L.A., it was more like I'd have the thought,
"Gee, I feel like going to a party. Maybe an outdoor thing..." and then I'd
be able to find something to suit my tastes. Here in Monterey, I feel like I
have to go to ANY events that look good for fear that I'll miss the chance to
go have some of the kind of fun I like, and see the people I love to be with.


Overall, I am really grateful for this list. It is my security blanket. I
know that without it , I'd be COMPLETELTY lost, and afraid of losing my
raving roots. And, of course I'm grateful for the people who make up the
list. It's really cool to have a source of insightful people to interact with
(even if it is virtually :O(  ).

 So, I guess that I, too, am a virtual raver. And, if I had to choose, I'd
choose virtually over not at all.

I'm from LA too. And, my roommate and I got really discouraged at first.
(We're in Monterey now, to add insult to injury.) But, we still have hope.
Watch this list and ask for help when you need to hook up. The people here
are really nice and helpful. 

I agree that the vibe is different. I wasn't sure that I was going to find
the kind of openness that I knew in LA. I think, though, that the people here
are just more underground than LAites are. There's gold in the Bay area, you
just gotta be willing to dig and remember to look in less obvious places.

Hey all,

lately I keep hearing this house record that appears to have lyrics in
it that go like (female voice): "It's saturday baby" or something like that
(people tend to hear the weirdest things in records until somebody tells
them what they actually are hearing). Anyway, if this seems familiar to
anybody out there, I'd be interested to know what record that is (+avail-
ability).

Thanx,

The Frying Dutchman

As one of the first returnees, I would like to answer the following
frequently-asked questions:  80? people attended, it took 7 hrs. if you
didn't get lost, 10 if you did which was most of us who did not go to burn
the man.  It got down to about 40 at night and not above 75 during the day.
The spring there was a beautiful fountain of thermal water surrounded by
tiered brightly colored mineral deposits - no sulphur odor.  Two 50' dia.
mud bottom 3' deep pools ADJACENT TO - YES the sound system were 95 degrees,
not too hot to make extended soaking possible.  I personally logged a good 4
hours with entertainment as diverse as aquatic dancing, frisbee, teaching
the butterfly, constructing a mud mask and headpiece for one pliant model
frequently referred to as Mud Man, watching the kids play around in an
inflatible boat (thanks, Isaac!)  Oh yes, and the absence of a moon made for
great stellar viewing in the incredible darkness.  It was fun when the sun
rose seeing people who arrived after dark admire the location.  Mark
deserves a lot of credit for organizing this ambitious adventure!  In
addition to some S.F. regulars, people came from the Tahoe area, Santa Cruz,
Harbin Hot Springs, one really cool couple made it from British Columbia-he
being her tatoo artist (designer and execution).

For those of us who like a road trip and good music in a natural
environment, this was the perfect combination.  We enjoyed making camp
together... settlers shoveled cow pies off the dance ground and set up chill
tents... built a fire and brewed tea there all night...made fruit salad for
a hundred in the a.m.  My neighbor made buckwheat pancakes with some stove
on his auto hood and one after another walked up to consume them all with
the same one plate and fork.  Supplies were diverse and freely exchanged,
including specifically some incredible organic Merlot.   

Anyone returning after me - yes, there was raving-on planned until way after
my departure Sun. afternoon:  who went on Sun. nite and did the spring
remain relatively undamaged and did anyone make it back with my blue
drawstring sleeping bag cover?

well not extremely new, i moved here a few months ago but still have had a
hard time finding the smaller, friendlier places to go. 

so far i have really enjoyed funktion and mad. any other nice happy zippy
parties go on weekly? 

it seems people often need rides, well i often need someone to share the
excitement of finding a parking place, so next time you know of a slick party
let me know and we can go together.

hope to see you all at mad tonight. maybe i'll wear a bow tie... hmmm,

That's right! They all ask for it! Hell, everybody knows that if they say
"no" they actually mean "yes"!

Yeah, I love those raves where you have to kick the chicks off you.
They're all there to get laid anyway, right? I mean the way they dress
and all that? The way everybody hugs and stuff, they're just begging for it!

Sure it does! That strategy is as old as mankind! Although personally I
still prefer to hit them over the head with a club and drag them back
to my cave. But then again, maybe I'm more the subtle and romantic
kind of guy.

And ehm, if you ever go out with your girlfriend (if any) I'm sure you
will find all those guys grabbing her ass completely acceptable.

Jeez, what century are you from?

The fidget-meister speaks true here. I've been going to parties for only
about 10 months but form what I've gathered there are two basic kinds of
parties in the SF scene: What I call "Open" and "Non-Open" parties. The
"Open" parties are what everyone hears about. These parties find you,
you don't have to look very hard and their presence is more noticeable.
"Non-Open" parties, on the other hand limit their exposure and
consequently are reiceved by a select group. (I know this is not exaclty
news to most people here but I've been dying to type this all on paper and
it's in your brain  cells now so youre stuck with it. :P)

But be glad for "Open" parties like Ground Zero, Megga Buzz, ect.!!!
'Raves' are a popular buzzword. People want to go to a 'Rave'. Even if
they don't know what it is. Open parties fill that demand. This enables true
lovers of the scence to function more efectively. So we can do things like
bring Virtual Reality toys from home and let others play with them. (Hint
Hint)

I must concur.  the last week has seen a lot of "z"'s and I don't quite 
understand it.  It's one thing to wear a costume to a rave to 
celebrate... it's another to be in costume on the list.

Please, be real, be true, PLUR

(this is being forwarded to SFRaves)

Diana - you have to cut down the number of folks in the "To:" header when
you send these weekly messages out, the majordomo spam filters are
catching them because it looks like a cross-list spam.  Since almost all
these people are on SFRaves anyways it's kinda redundant, but if you want
to send it to them individually could you make it a separate message?

Also, note to other SFRavers - it looks like the location of tonight's
dinner is Hamburger Mary's, not the italian place in north beach, as a
previous message had noted.

Please don't send random job openings to the list.... there's so much
demand in SF for technical folk that this list could easily become
ba.jobs.offered.  Ugh.  Unless, of course, the job involves spinning slabs
of vinyl and odd hours.  :)  Put the URL for the job listing in your
signature or something.... thanks.

B,

Many folks on my list filter out posts to ALL in SFRaves.  Doing it the
way I do is the most economical (time-wise) way to get the message out.

Does anyone know who the guy was in the basement, with the mag light in his
mouth for 2 hours, playing the most awesome, weird, scary, cool music I
have heard in a while.  They were on from about 2:00 - 3:30 am.  I was
LURVING it (as well as the rest of the party : )

If it was live, it was O.S.T. (Chris). I think he was due to be on around
that time.

I'm working on a Web based job board for anyone interested posting to it.
Just can't decide if I should take the time to go with an MSQL back-end,
or just do flat-file lookups. Suggestions anyone?

No, maybe, just maybe, these people have some R-E-S-P-E-C-T for women,
something you seem to be very much lacking in.

oops!  I didn't mean to make my message sound like a flame; I apologize to
Diana and others who thought I was being abrupt when really I was trying
to make sure people understood why I had to forward the message and why it
bounced in the first place.  I do tend to be curt in email only because I
get a lot of it and can't spend more than about 20 seconds in most email
messages, particularly when dealing with list bounces and such, and since
I figured that message was particularly time critical. 

Anyways, I didn't mean to imply that you shouldn't send messages about
dinner to the list; quite the opposite I think it's great to get something
like that going, and I hope to get to a dinner one of these nights, and
more involved in sfraves stuff in general.  Definitely still send notice; 
but if you need to send it personally to a bunch of other people too, I
just recommend making it a separate message.  Actually, there is another
very good reason to do that - if you want to send it personally to a bunch
of people so it doesn't go into people's filtered mailboxes, then
including "sfraves" in the To: field will probably defeat that purpose
anyways. 

Sorry about the confusion.

	Brian

Hey everyone! I was on the list in June, but I dropped because I was
getting sick of being jealous listening to all your party stories (I live
in Colorado)...but I'm on again because I'm moving to SF in November. Does
anyone want or know anyone who wants a roomate sometime in the very near
future? If so I will give you a short description of what i'm looking for.
I don't mind smokers, I smoke cloves on occassion. Absolutely no
tweekers!! I don't mind messy people as long as they do their share of the
cleaning (dishes etc.) A little about me. I'm 23 year old psyc
major/artist gemini. If anyone is interested please send me private mail.

Sounds like this is Tori Amos _Professional Widow_ Armand Van Helden remix.
If the song you're thinking of has a funky/house beat...this is the one!

Hi,
	Thank you to everybody who responded with their favourite vinyl shops,
	Adam, Andre, Alex, Shannon, Shimako, illumin8. We basically hit Haight
	in SF and ventured into F8, Housewares, Ameba followed by Zebra & BPM.
	My visiting friend Mark managed to find a few fine tunes which got his
	weekend off to a great start!

	In the evening we hit 1015 Folsom, and had a good time, but we decided that
	we should have hit the 215 party so on Saturday we loaded up and headed for
	PLANETARIUM which was outstanding. A big thank you goes out to Brian (Flipp)
	who let me follow his Jeep up the dirt track in my 6" clearance Corolla and
	another nod to Brian for his great set in the evening. I was rocked !!

	What a great setup, on top of a mountain watching the stars come out one by
	one until there is a brain numbing amount with a brilliant dj line up. The
	diversity of the music and the quality of the djs made it for me. The icing
	on the cake was all the friendly faces :)

	Having been up to 4am on Friday, I only made it to 2.30 (I tried) before I crawled
	into my tent just as Get Decor (Passion) came on (you should have called it HEAVEN).
	Managed to get up briefly for the Sunrise though (very briefly).

	My friend Mark is just back from 2 weeks in Ibiza and thought that this was just
	so cool that it probably topped his experiences over there! He met everybody
	there and introduced my wife (Frances) & I to Chris, John(with the big fluffy collar),
	Kerry, Steve and probably some others. We also met Jason from San Diego who said it
	was worth the trip (it was) and Adam who said he put on Charity which should run
	again in November. See you there =)

	BTW, I was wearing a black woolly hat and a huge grin ;-()

 - Da Funky Scotsman -

P.S.	If any of you want to stay in touch with Mark in the UK his e-mail is mark@bssl.co.uk
	or he can be reached in Denver (for the next few weeks) at myou@gwl.com

"Grow up punk" <-- Sign of old age.

<Ram> My apologies to the list for these word...

  We will leave Rams positive vibes out of this reply.
 God knowz he only speaks them with the happy face he defiantly wears for

more than likely lose it's grip, plunging his ever so faithful companions
to there betray.

 I don't mean no body any disrespect.  I am just sick of racist comments.
Calling someone a gangster that might not appreciate it. Iz just as bad as
calling someone a nigger that feels the same..

I can do nothing but wholeheartedly agree.  I can't be believe that someone
can be so stupid as the say that girls at raves want their asses grabbed,
much less actually believe it. And so what if that ass grabbing strategy
works -- that makes it right ?!? Come on.  Grow up a lttle. This is exactly
the kind of attitude that has no place on this list.  Sorry everyone for
using up bandwith
but I just had to vent my spleen against a jerk like this.

[ from Larry Ching to SFRaves list ]

 This is mostly in reaction to parts of Lee Fogel's reply to something 
KaySEE posted , although it could also be considered my contribution to the 
topic of "Aging and Raves" . I'll try to keep the "me too" statements to a 
minimum...
( LF: == Lee Fogel )

LF: "I still find it hard to compare any experience with the peak moments 
I've had dancing at the better raves in my life... But one thing that has 
become clear over the last 2 years, is that some of us reach a point where 
we want more in our lives than an ongoing continuim of amazing Nows.  The 
Reality Beyond calls for our attention: there's a big, weird world out 
there, for better or worse. "

Me: I've had peak experiences at raves that do rate in the "most profound" 
catagory for me as well; and I also feel that I must do more to find 
spiritual experience outside of the rave scene, as well as finding 
spirituality within it.

 As far as the "big, weird world out there" , that reminds me of something 
attributed to the deceased rock concert promotor Bill Graham. He was a mature 
man when he got involved in the late sixties San Francisco music scene . 
During the 1967 Summer Of Love,he happened to be talking to a young teenage 
hippie , who was gushing on about the experience of tripping and how it was 
the ultimate experience in the world. Graham replied something to the effect 
"Well, have you ever gone skiiing? Jumped out of a plane? Gotten married? 
Held your newborn child in your arms? Have a loved one die?" 

 I may be misquoting, and I don't quite remember how the encounter went from 
there, but what I get from the anecdote is that ordinary living can provide 
isolated moments of intensity and emotional profundity that match any trip. 

 By the way, I think what both have in common is that the experiences from 
life and from LSD do not come about without the decision to take on a risk - 
to DO with the knowledge that one may be hurt in body or heart or soul.


LF: "For many, the responsibilities of careers/family/health call us away."

Me:That's spot on for me right now! 

LF: "Others choose paths that seem to have more substance in a political,
creative, spiritual or social sense. "

Me:Hopefully, I can work the careers/family/health issues with some time for 
some of these things too.

LF:"...Despite its flaws, the rave scene still seems like a wonderful place
to be.  As long as you have your clique of raver friends, it's
pretty hard not to have some great times.  I used to wonder if there
would ever be anything to replace it in my life.  I'm happy to say that
the Universe is an infinitely rich place for endless exploration."

Me: I still love our scene too. I feel I'm at a stage where I should look
for more outside it, while not abandoning it altogether.

 I feel that raves can provide a "doorway" experience to aspects of oneself,
but that what lies beyond those doorways must be found outside our rave house.



 I think I should write more , but I don't know what just now, and I want to
go to bed! Goodnight ...

life is a trip. be here now. ive met some of the most wonderful people in 
the rave scene. friends come, friends go, some are just faint memories in 
the distance of my consciousness, those memories of laughter and warm 
days in teh sun that seemed they'd never end. i learned something from 
them, thay are a part of me. my friends now are beautiful, creative, and 
full of life. we like to be around eachother, and plan these sometimes 
elaborate gatherings that all of us are a creative part of. we love to 
dance, we love electronic music, and we constantly change. the rave scene 
flows from our creative powers, the creative love we have for one 
another. it is appreciation, it is companionship, it is togetherness, 
sometimes in a sweaty warehouse, sometimes on a grassy hill in a daytime 
sun, sometimes in a house, or anywhere doing anything. it is constant 
change, evolution, new ways of communication and creative ways to be 
close with good friends. i will never grow tired of being with good friends.
be here now. were changing faster than we realize. appreciate.

I sure hope that all Ran'z mentors can find it in there heart to forgive me
someday.
I really don't want to go on in life with nothing to lose.
Give it a rest Randream. 

I know you rely on your popularity amongst your computer buddies. But no
need to worry I am sure they will take your side.

As for me. I am not looking for support.
 So read me or don't people!

The Bahia may be kinda square a lot of the time (and I can definitely
do without the soccer-warmup-suit crowd that also infests places like
the Cafe Bastille where Vanilla Fudge is), but I'm all in favor of
any kind of music that involves shakin' yer groove thang to something
other than prefab American rhythms.  

And don't dis salsa too much -- sure it's a commercial, bland style
the way it normally is heard, but the *real* stuff is da shit.  I was
fortunate enough to hear Tito Puente and his orquestra do the do in
Seattle a few years ago, and they were great.  Salsa definitely feeds
on the same powerful stream of musical history that house and techno do.

you scribled:

>They seem to be respecting more than 50% of the venu'z rules.

What about the other 50%. It's the 50% of the rules there not respecting that
is probally why there consider gangstas in the first place.

>As far as grabbing a$$ez.. Most girls seem alittle more loose 
>at the raves (correct me if I'm wrong). 

Your wrong! They may have there guards lowered only because they feel safer at
a "rave" because usually there are people there with respect. They don't go
there to be grabbed.

>Hell most of them that approach me seem to want me to be that blunt 
>or rude. I bet that azz grabbing stratagy works more than it fails.

I have yet to see a female that wants to be treated they way you mentioned, at
least the ones that have an ounce of respect for themself don't. One of these
days your going to get your ass kicked by a boyfriend or even a female, and
then maybe you'll think twice when you talk rudely to a women.


>I do believe that this "RAVE" scene iz making a difference in are 
>community.


Your right, with people like you, that difference is not helping us. Next time
you goto a "rave" goto the people working the door and ask them for the
envelope that says "CLUE" and get one!

>But if all of us start casting out people becouse of the way they 
>look. Were going to end up back at the beggining agian.

It people like you with your attitude that will wreck the "rave" scene.

I find you to be as rude , and uncouth as anybody I have ever read on SFR 
 
you are some kind of neo-lithic throwback to the stone -age (no,
actually.......that gives you too much credit....) 
 
I would strongly consider, reconsiderering your angle on women, and life in
general........  
 
You are an offensive child in an adult forum.......... I strongly urge you
to unsubscribe before you are wiped out publicly on line....... or suffer
the consequences of being publicly humiliated ........actually, it's a bit
late............ you have already opened mouth (several times), and
inserted computer........ 
 
I seriously doubt if you are much older than 16, and I doubt if you would
know what to do with a woman if she walked up and bit you in the
ass........ 
 
you are offensive & down-right nasty. (oh I do hope you wish to flame me as
I could shred you alive in reply) 
 
I strongly urge you to appologize for you incipid and downright sexist
attitudes before you find yourself ostrasized and unwelcome into 450
peoples computer. 
 
I may have made statements in the past, I have been sorry I printed in
public, but have appologized later......... it's never too late to come
down off your uneasy pedistool, and join the rest of us here at
SFR./......a simple apology and a slightly more adult approach might
actually get you somewhere......... It will sure show all of us (at SFR)
that we have mis-understood you....... something we can't possibly do for
now (i only speak for myself), as your words say SO MUCH about your
mentality........ moonpup 
 
I hope you will consider the consequences, before you go ripping 1/2 the
community again....... you are a BOZO..........

Hey kaytee - - - :-)

Just one thing...Just like other SFR's have probably told you, try to
eliminate going to the over-publicized, $20-25 raves.  The smaller, less
expensive parties are usually the ones that have the good vibes, less
hassle, and can usually guarantee the location - when I was living up
there, my friends and I had some bad experiences over the summer.  We all
had the gut feeling that the parties we were about to spend $20+ for were
going to get rampaged by good old SFPD, or that bad vibes were going to be
present.  Well what do you know, our gut feelings were right!!!
Yeah, there will be a huge event here and there that may hit it off really
well, but wouldn't you rather spend less and receive more hugs and
smiles?

Have fun up in SF - I know you will!!!

:-) 
Karen

I find you to be as rude , and uncouth as anybody I have ever read on SFR 

you are some kind of neo-lithic throwback to the stone -age (no,
actually.......that gives you too much credit....) 

I would strongly consider, reconsiderering your angle on women, and life in
general........  

You are an offensive child in an adult forum.......... I strongly urge you
to unsubscribe before you are wiped out publicly on line....... or suffer
the consequences of being publicly humiliated ........actually, it's a bit
late............ you have already opened mouth (several times), and
inserted computer........ 

I seriously doubt if you are much older than 16, and I doubt if you would
know what to do with a woman if she walked up and bit you in the
ass........ 

you are offensive & down-right nasty. (oh I do hope you wish to flame me as
I could shred you alive in reply) 

I strongly urge you to appologize for you incipid and downright sexist
attitudes before you find yourself ostrasized and unwelcome into 450
peoples computer. 

I may have made statements in the past, I have been sorry I printed in
public, but have appologized later......... it's never too late to come
down off your uneasy pedistool, and join the rest of us here at
SFR./......a simple apology and a slightly more adult approach might
actually get you somewhere......... It will sure show all of us (at SFR)
that we have mis-understood you....... something we can't possibly do for
now (i only speak for myself), as your words say SO MUCH about your
mentality........ moonpup 

I hope you will consider the consequences, before you go ripping 1/2 the
community again....... you are a BOZO..........

Subject: Prop 215 Benefit, review


Until Friday I thought I was taking a roadtrip up to Mendocino for 
Planetarium and therefore skipping the very worthwhile 215 Benefit.

Then I found out, after a couple of weeks of thinking otherwise, that I 
don't get Monday off at work.

BUMMER!  There has got to be nothing worse than having a 3-day weekend 
suddenly taken away. :(

Then Friday night none of my friends wanted, for various 
reasons, to go out raving.  My choices for the night's entertainment 
ranged from drinking and playing cards at home, going to sleep early, or 
going out to bars in the city with some non-raver friends.

BUMMER!  I chose the bars.  We drank at Kate O'Briens, an Irish bar 
where, to my surprise, upstairs was the debut of a new triphop/tribal 
weekly - name escapes me now.  Of course the friends didn't want to pay 
the 3 bux to check out the dj.  :(.  We drove around looking for more 
bars.  I made them drive past the Cannibas Club, just to gaze longingly 
at the line outside.  We drove past it to Haight Street, where we got 
drunker at Mad Dog and across the street at Noc Noc, where my friends 
announce they are ready to go home.  BUMMER!  And then...

COOLNESS! At Noc Noc, who should I run into but 
Raver Eric, who is on his way to 215!!  I dump my understanding friends 
and hop in Eric's car.  :) :) :). 

At 215 is a whole world of raver friends, people I know when I go out 
partying but wouldn't think to call beforehand.  It is strange to 
potentially miss a party just because you don't have someone to go _with_, 
when a whole community awaits you at the party!

Actual party review: WOW! I had never been in the actual Club - five 
floors of serious lounging area, couches, little bars.  I was so pleased 
to be partying for such an important cause.  When I smoked out on the 
dancefloor it felt like a political statement.  Aside from 209 and the 
little matter of the presidential race, this Proposition is among the 
most important issues on the ballot.  The criminalization of marijuana is 
ludicrous, but what we're talking about here - prohibiting its medical 
use to people who are suffering - is nothing less than unconscienable.  
Yea for the rave community for standing up for what's right!  Yea for our 
community for its utmost optimism, its dedication to social causes!  
It is in our faith that change can happen that it will. :)

Down to business: the music ROCKED.  I am pleased to have several new 
favorite dj's.  I have never heard MysterE, Deaks or DRC before - and 
they blew the dancefloor away, down on the first floor (where I was 
planted most of the night).  DRC is a goddess.  Who do I have to give e 
to to make sure she's booked more often???  I know she plays "out" 
(other cities) a lot... I'll just content myself with the next F8 (Mars, 
Dutch and DRC - send me straight to trance heaven!!).  Unfortunately by 
Ethan's set my group was too tired, and we set out home (helping a very good 
party die too early).

Here I have to give the biggest TTTTHHHAAAANNNNKKK YYYYOOOOUUU to Eric D 
and his friends and housemates.  They live in SF.  They agreed to take me 
back to where my car was, at my friend's in Oakland just off the Bay 
Bridge.  And we sat on the Bridge for over an hour (overblown Caltrans 
project or evil conspiracy to break the spirit of renegade dancers?).  
Then all the freeways were closed and we were dumped onto some street in 
Oakland, all of us completely clueless.  Almost two hours after we left 
215 to "quickly" drop me back in the East Bay, they finally were heading 
back to SF, and I was feeling pretty bad about the whole thing.  If you 
see him (or Walter or Janice) give them a hug for me!

And vote on November 5th, all you stoney ravers!

Love you,
Nancy

***** NOTES from Jeff Croop (JEFF @ UAI-MHS) at 10/15/96 10:31 AM


 Not once did Jeff say he grabbed girls asses. Actually Jeff said that 
people that do such things are as low as people that masturbate in public.
 I don't think that all women at raves want this kind of disrespect. But I 
do beleive that more than half like to go there to make out with total 
strangers. And there is nothing wrong with that. And there is nothing wrong 
with my E-Mail reply towards gangsta'z.
 You don't know me, you can't judge me on my E-mail, all you get do iz vent 
steam.
    Vent on brothers.!

J,

THANX for the solution about the mail-spam!  

I eat dinner with a bunch of geeks every week; I myself am a geek; and
none of us ever thought it out like that!

Thanks again,

Diana Greer

FUCK OFF, I need no public addulation. and it's obvious you don't care what
impression you make on this here net.......

seriously doubt it, because you hide behind a screen 
 
I am a well known DJ and I do not hide behind private e-mails or

I would love to meet you in person and continue this thread.........

I would seriously love it, if we could end this thread.  We really don't 
need to be jumping on Mr. nstuff's back quite to this degree.  Granted 
what he said was not the most well thought-out, enlightened post I have 
ever read, but I am sure many of us have posted something to the list 
that we did not really think out first.  

We are so quick to judge, even though we spout off about love and acceptance.
Let's try not to act so much like a lynch mob.  I think one or two people 
responding to a post that is considered inappropriate for this list is 
one thing, but when everyone has to jump in and call someone a jerk, it 
is just going a bit too far.  It actually attracts more attention than it 
deserves.  Know what I mean?

Asking for someone's apology after he has already been attacked is just a 
little too late in my opinion.  If an apology was going to be requested, 
that should have been done first.  At this point I think Jeff
deserves an apology.

Cheers***
Cami

Ps.  Please flame me privately regarding this post, I don't want to 
subject the list to any more of this bs.

I would just like to say to all my fellow SFRavers.........sorry to waffle
publicly but this nerd needs to be put in his place. 
 
granted I am not the one in charge or do I try to be the e-mailer god
(whats good & not good). 
 
but I find this kind of rubbish to be offensive to all of us (ok just to
me).... 
 
I appreciate all the positive responses, and support........... I even

....ahem!...uh, I think I come in at a weird time....

I just subscribed to the list to ask about some places to go out while in
SF over the holidays. (I'm in Manhattan) It's been so long since I've been
back to SF (lived there 3 yrs ago), I want to make sure I don't miss any
good parties or clubs that are it at the moment.

But, with all this flaming going on, this must seem like boring, trite LIST
patter to you all!!

I'll give it a shot anyway...

I'd love to find at least a club or two (small or large) that has more of
an underground flavor of jungle? Is that even happening out there?? (I
know, I know, I'm sure it was there first!) Or if anyone knows of any good
techno clubs that are relatively new (ie: not in the "cheese" phase yet),
your favorite spots to go to hear the best music.

There's just so much stuff going on here weekly, I don't want to be out
there and miss what I'm sure is happening there, too!

I'll try and return the favor for any of you visiting NY!

And seriously, not being a regular of your list, if this is boring
overkill, those who take pity on me can email me directly and not to the
list!!!

Thanks WAY in advance!

-Suzanne

You incideous filth.......... Do you know who I am......... I am moonpup
the DJ who was raving long before raving was a popular art form........
certainly a member of the "scene" long before you got your ass out of your
smelly diapers........ you have a lot to learn about raving, ravers, and
the scene......... I assure you, I have plenty of friends, and I can assure
you, that I will be getting noticed (likes thats really a dream of
mine)....... long after you have gone to bed at night............ or have
given up raving because you don't understand the first thing about P.L.U.R.

 
Just keep up the attitude and you will find yourself on the outside looking
in........ and I hope you end up with a girl who allows you to pinch her
ass........ like you so proudly prophess.......  
 
I would agree in general, that you can not judge a person from one e-mail,
however in your case.......... it's all to obvious you are as shallow as
your e-mails, (if not more so). 
to actually defend your position with pride makes me want to throw
up........... 
 
I have never thought that a person (on SFR) would be so out there in left
field on there own with such narrow and digresive ideas and words......that
I hope Brian would consider throwing you off the list......... you are not
worth the time or bandwith. 
 
I actually feel sorry for you...... I hope you are able to live with
yourself.......... good luck and I hope we never meet in person.......... I
might be not so nice to your FACE in person.......... moonpup (very upset &
dissapointed in my fellow man) 
 
I'm actually embarrassed to be of the same sex as you.......... let alone
the same species..... 
 
if you want more......... just continue with the insults of my family &
friends (SFR)

It was great!  Gateway's soundsystem rocked the Bahia.  Lots of friendly
people (as usual at Mad), and by 11:00 the dance floor was a big sea
of energy (well, maybe more like a pool of energy, the Bahia is not THAT
big)  Stayed to hear Jon Santos' and Ethans' set.  I danced a lot.

I wish I could get to Mad more often, but I'm usually pretty tired on
monday after a hectic weekend.  It is nice when there is something
happening at mad, like this 1 year party... or a guest dj.

There is something about the vibe at a good mid-week club that I really
like... especially at Mad.

FUCK OFF, I need no public addulation. and it's obvious you don't care what
impression you make on this here net....... 

......but do you have the balls to say all of this to my face.......... I
seriously doubt it, because you hide behind a screen 

I am a well known DJ and I do not hide behind private e-mails or

As most people (mostly men!) on this list realize, the rave scene offers 
a haven for women where we are actually treated with respect as human 
beings and not as objectified things.

I have despaired that raving if the _only_ place I can feel comfortable 
being my self, because out in the other world of houseparties and clubs 
and bars, if I smile or say hello to someone who is actually male, if I 
dance, or if I simply walk 
around I am the target of harassment.  NOT friendly attraction, I mean 
HARASSMENT - unwanted touching, leering and intimidating behavior.

As someone so rightly said, imagine someone bigger than you.  Now imagine 
them drunk, singling you out, grabbing you (they are 
much stronger).  If you break away or yell at them they become hostile.  
This is not fun, or flattering.  This is frightening.   

Most of the time I have had my ass grabbed it is NOT by someone who then 
says 
hello.  It is anonymous, a hand on me in a crowd, fondling me then moving 
away before I can yell or determine who it is.  It is saying, ha ha, I 
can do this to you, there is nothing you can do about, you don't even 
know who just violated you.  It is a repulsive feeling.

At parties I experience unbelievable freedom.  I dance with abandon, 
knowing I can express myself without it being interpreted as sexual 
availability.  I can smile and look in people's eyes just because we're 
human beings.  I can walk around exploring without it meaning I'm alone 
and looking.  In this world, these simple pleasures are amazing freedoms 
for women, things we usually are denied.  Think about that.

When the sexist, domineering attitude appears at parties - my refuge - it 
is the cruelest feeling.  It ruins the happy feeling of safety.

One story: at the CCC party, there was a security guard in front of the 
bathroom.  I went up to him to ask to go inside.  He looked at me and 
said, 'you have to hug me first."  This was not a happy raver, let's hug 
each other type of thing.  This was a guy leaning over me, demanding a hug 
before I 
could use the bathroom.  I said I wasn't comfortable with that, and I 
needed to use the bathroom.  he blocked the door, stopped smiling, and 
ordered me to hug him.  I pushed past him and went into the bathroom.  He 
came after me and bodily dragged me out of the bathroom by the arms.  I 
was not allowed to go the bathroom because I hadn't given him a sexual 
favor.  Because he was bigger and stronger than me, he was able to 
punish me for not pressing against him.  

It was hard to be "happy" after that experience, and left soon after.

Some women can just shake it off, but for me, the reminder that I can be 
treated like an object with impunity is so galling.  It is up to men to 
treat us with respect.  Yes you can grab us and we can't do much about 
it.  So we flock to the rave scene for some measure of a safe, respectful 
environment.  "Ass-grabbing" is not so benign; it is a power inequality 
that is frightening and demeaning to women.  When it is accepted in the 
rave scene is the day the scene dies for most women.

I've been out of town a lot lately, just trying to get up to date on the 
latest.  About the recent posts and threads:

Brian now goes as THX1138, or something to that effect, but he hasn't been 
posting lately.  I too would like to hear the finale to that saga, but 
apparently Wayne wrestled Brian to the ground and relieved him of his 
computer... <j/k>

GANGSTAS:
I don't care how someone dresses or poses, so long as they respect my space. 
 I'm old enough to realize everyone's pretty much the same underneath the 
latest fashions, and different folks have fun in different ways.  So long as 
I'm able to have my form of fun without hurting anyone and vice versa, it's 
all good.

RESPECT:
As for the moronic post about grabbing women's butts at a party, I think the 
mother of the guy that posted that was less than competent in raising her son.

RAVING:
Thank God Larry Ching is still on this list.  I love hearing his balanced 
views on things.  My sentiment is that raving has provided the wild release 
that balances the mundane aspects of my life.  It has given me some 
fantastic memories and some wonderful friends.

PARTY SIZE:
I choose the party based on size and what I'm looking for.  Major production 
= massive.  PLURry vibe = small underground.  In both cases I look for good 
promoters.

I would just like to say to all my fellow SFRavers.........sorry to waffle
publicly but this nerd needs to be put in his place. 

granted I am not the one in charge or do I try to be the e-mailer god
(whats good & not good). 

but I find this kind of rubbish to be offensive to all of us (ok just to
me).... 

I appreciate all the positive responses, and support........... I even

Hello-
	Hopefully someone may know someone who may know someone who
knows the someone who walked off with the wrong (or additional?)
black and silver anvil record case at the 215/CBC benefit. If you
walked off with a set of records that sounds nothing like the ones
you expected to be bringing home, could you please return at least
the last 40 or so pieces of vinyl in that crate? I don't think they
are worth much to many people, and I don't care if you want the
crate, I just would like that vinyl back.
	If anyone knows anyone that picked up the wrong crate, or
an extra crate made it in your car with all your gear, please get in
touch with me. If you hear anyone bragging about lifting some poor
saps records at the CBC benefit, can you either take a photo and
mail it to me so I can subtly drop some nuisances on him or her...
If you own a record shop and buy used vinyl, can you watch out for
someone trying to pawn off a load of gabber and techno and trance...
Thanks...

dave

So there's been a lot of talk about the "gangsta" element... but what I 
usually see are a lot of teenagers trying to fit in... hey man addidas 
pants are the shit... and how cool are they to be 16 and going to 
all-night drugfests?  if there was such a thing when I was in high 
school, I woulda been there, with the latest fashions!!  "Cool" and "hip" 
are major deals when you're that age... they're going to parties for 
different reasons than people in their 20's and 30's who are in a 
different stage of life.  (I'm having so much more fun in my 20's than in 
high school!!)

So anyway, at the 215 Benefit, there was this little boy in front of me 
on the dancefloor.  He did a mating circle dance for me, bustin' moves, 
glancin' up at me.  When he's done, he comes up to me, smiles proudly and 
says, "so, what you think of my moves??"  I felt so bad, but I just had 
to laugh to myself.  Here this little boy thought I would be so 
impressed, just like a 16 year old girl, with his fly hat and his 
footwork, that I would want him because he was coolraverboy.  I just told 
him he was a good dancer and then danced away.

Sometimes a "gangsta"
is just a highschoolkid
without a clue

Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com

Well I thought in light of all the gangsta post people might have some
serious filters flying and might have missed my last post.  Sorry for being
redundant.

I'm planning to throw BBQ & BEATS III   (Stuff your Face) or (a Feeding
Frenzy) not sure yet. More then likely on Nov 16th.
Time: noonish-9pm
DJs...????? Don't know yet.
location: TBA
More info to come so stay tuned....

We as a SFR family need to get together as a family once more. I've loved
the last two BBQ & BEATS. The people and the music are wonderful. You can
not imagine how great I felt at the last one.  (Except for ANN from New
Moon, who probally has a great picture which I want to see). The few time I
got away from the BBQ and looked at the crowd dancing, sitting talking to
others, throwing stuff on the BBQ, it was all heart warming to see that.
I'm sure some of you that have thrown parties feel that too when you stand
back and look at that.

So call me greedy for wanting to feel that again, who wouldn't want to feel
it. This is why I want to have another one.  Everyone that went to the
other ones made it special, as well as all that help out with them.

I was told by someone that I found something special to do for our
community and that was getting them together in a sorta different aspect of
"raving". All I was trying to do was to make people happy and try and give
back to this community. I wasn't wanting to throw a bad ass party to be
talked about for years to come. All I was concerned about was seeing
peoples smiling faces and seeing them all having a good time. People have
asked, why I don't spin at these. Well, for one I don't feel I'm ready yet
and two, it's not about me, it's about YOU.  This all my sound corny and
all but it's how I feel. I've had some of the best times of my life with
alot of you since I've been raving and this is my way of saying thanks. One
of these days I'll spin out, but not yet. When I do though, look out!

Anyway, just thought I explain way I do this for those new people on here
as well as for those wondering. Plus I was kinda getting tired of reading
the gangsta stuff.

If you want to lend a hand feel free to email me privately

There is no greater reward than to have your peers, those people you admire
and respect most in the world, offer you an oportunity to dabble their
medium...and then give you a positive response...

I would walk to the steps of heaven for Cloud Factory, and Friday night
almost did.  You see, our van arrived after the gate was closed and being
the sporting chap I am, I decided I could use a brisk walk at 1am.  After a
wild pig scared me shitless (not a boar, a little pig), I decided I should
sing to scare off other wild vermin.  Singing and walking, walking and
signing.   Rustling in the shrubs.  Louder singing, faster walking, more
rustling in the shrubs.  Yelling loudly, trotting nervously,
rustling...rustling...running...singing really loud...rustling stops,
walking again.

After about two miles I get rescued by Sabin's parents who were coming out
for the night.  I had gone about two miles out of NINE!  Someone said I was
"hard core" for being willing to walk it, and I had to smile and think, "No
I'm just an idiot."

Anyway, heaven it was.  Two sound systems, plenty of space.  There's a
house up there, and they truck fresh water up from a stream below.  The
roads tough, but not too tough for most vehicles.  ("Think Wayne's car will
make it?"  *Snicker*  "What's Marcy drive?")    And the stars!  Oh my
gawd...  Almost as brilliant as the people.  =)

Got to sleep on the hill top the first night (night of the great walk), and
that was amazing.  Woke up completely disoriented but with an amazing
sunrise to bring me back to reality.  Snapped a picture and fell back a
sleep.  'Drenalin woke me later.

Music ran from around 1PM Saturday until about 3PM Sunday.  Braced for rain
a couple times but only during the day.  Windy on the mountain top, but we
braved it.  One of the greatest moments was when the tail end of a wind
storm blew a canopy half apart and while Sig and Tina were putting on crazy
music (i.e, Farmer in the Dell samples, etc...), about 15 people were
trying to get the canopy back together.  It was a scene.  Finally it took
the long arm of Joe Rice to get the canopy back in place, but by then the
storm had passed for good.

Was given a chance to spin some disco/funk at around noon Sunday and for
that I can't thank Cloud Factory enough.  I'm forever indebted...  =)
Well, maybe not FOREVER...

Questions?

        If they ask you with words, "Please grab my ass sir", then go ahead.
Otherwise, no one should grab anyone's anything without prior approval.
Sexual harrassment (pronaounsed huh-RASS-Meant) is inflating and that's not
something cool to have on your record. Just look at that little boy who
kissed this girl on the cheek and got charged??? Some people just have
problems, or maybe it's just all of you who partied this weekend and are
posting as you're comin off of whatever you were on.

I got this from a guy in the Mid-West who is looking to do some
traveling next summer, and asked me to forward it to the list. He
was pretty cool on hs way through SF last year about this time, so
if anyone wants to put together a larger party (concert sized?),
give him an e-mail... Would be pretty cool to get a traveling
sound system community together....

If the records were misplaced in someones gear (or whatever) that sucks
because Dave wasn't able to spin at CBC _OR_ the Cloud Factory party.  But
it's forgivable.

However, if they were stolen, it would be easily the most fucked up thing
I've seen in the rave scene.  Not only was this a benefit party, but Dave
was loaning his sound system!  And they were taken before he spun!!

For those of you with excess energy berating one another, ready to take
things "outside", I beseech you to focus that energy on trying to track
down a crate of records we all have grown to appreciate.

In one way or another this will affect everyone in the Bay Area Rave
Community, whether or not you've come to appreciate gabba at the end of
those special parties, or just enjoy Dave's sets in general.

This is a cause worth fighting for...

UGH!

Warning:  This message contains no flames and makes no references to gangstas.

I just got back from a little trip to Ithaca, NY.  And I had a great time
despite some transportation problems.  I partiEd for the first time while not
at a rave.  Instead I walked around the Cornell campus with friends and 
enjoyed the rivers, lakes, waterfalls, and all the leaves turning red, orange,
yellow, and shades in between.  Thankfully the weather warmed up while I was
there (maybe I brought some of that California sun snuck into my backpack
before I got on the plane) so I didn't have to walk around bundled up in a
big coat.

Things I learned on my trip:
---------------------------
Never fly Continental Express.  They cancelled my flight from Newark to Ithaca
on Thursday night and put me on a 5hr bus ride instead that got into Ithaca
at 3:30am.  They also cancelled my flight Sunday from Ithaca to Newark.  But
that wasn't as bad.  I got to stay an extra day.

Cornell has a beautiful campus.  But its big and you can get lost at night if
you don't know where you're going. :) (Not that that's a bad thing)

I am able to be in two different places at the same time.  

Airport security guards collect books. 

Dogs can't always smell illegal substances.  Even if they walk right past you.


:)  Have a great week!

Sorry.  I'm probably commiting a pho-pah by writing.  I've only been 
around a few days...  

Jeff,  quit fighting.  If you haven't yet noticed, every statement you 
make...every effort at explanation gets turned on you.  You are probably 
a nice guy who just made a comment that, in different company would not 
have been taken so seriously or negatively.  I read all these damned 
messages, and it is obvious that you don't go "booty grabbing", you've just 
made some observtions from your perspective, and shared them.

Randy,  everyone knows where you're coming from.  I and many other 
people agree that "booty grabbing" is disrespectful.  Go as far as 
you like on the issue, but bashing character is wrong.  You set a person 
up as a psycho and you'll never be at peace, with him, yourself, or the 
world. 

Negativity is not conducive to presenting ones point of view to someone 
else.  I personally shut out people when there is negativity in their tone 
because it makes me so uncomfortable.  I'd love to see an end to this 
with some shared understanding...

BTW, I already feel really comfortable with the community on 
SFRaves...this bashing was the only thing that hurt me...kind of like 
watching family members fight.  The escallation leads to intolerance, and 
I couldn't bear to see that here.

			Peace and Understanding

	If I have heard about this scenerio correctly, he had asked
her first, was given permission and then kissed her. Where is the
sexual harrassment in that? And if I was told the story accurately,
it was the teacher who intervened, dragged both of them to the
principle's office where either both or just the guy was suspended
for a while on the grounds of sexual harrassment. Maybe I have
missed something in the developmental psychology field that says
young boys kissing girls on the cheek leads to oppressed housewifes
and continues the male domination of the human race, but to me,
this has nothing to do with sexual harrassment. In fact it seems
more of an invasion of allowing people to grow up feeling that they
can show affection for each other (he asked, she said yes, the two
were happy, then someone punishes them for it). But again,
maybe I didn't hear the story correctly...

Actually, I *like* salsa quite a bit! One of my fondest memories when
growing up was seeing Tito Puente live at the Newport Jazz festival
(that was the same year Miles Davis played; what a treat!)

I was actually commenting on how bizarre it was to see a completely
different crowd, music, atmosphere, etc. at a place that I have often
tranced out at many a weekend night.

So sorry if I came off the wrong way. Actually I keep my mind open
to all musical styles (except gangsta rap and country...sorry :)
especially music that is at the roots of our scene.

Well, I made it back from my 8,500 miles at sea, not to mention the 4,000
miles of air flights to get to San Diego to start my Panama Canal cruise,
and back from lovely Fort Lauderdale via the ever-so-tardy Delta Airlines.

Cruise review:  I was traveling with an 88-year old cranky woman on a ship
filled with another thousand cranky seniors.  Enough said.  However, I saw
lots of interesting places (Cabo, Acupulco, Guatemala/Tikal, Cartegena
Columbia, Grand Cayman and the Bahamas), got to be one of the youngest
passengers on the ship (how scary is that??), drank way too much, ate WAY
too much and too often, made a great new friend who lives in LA (he'll
visit soon and I'll bring him to a party) and fell madly in love with a
Portuguese waiter who, unfortunately due to a number of reasons (oops), was
summarily sent home packing at the end of the cruise.  Shit, now what?

Leeza review:  My VCR kindly did its job so I saw the show when I got home.
(My answering machine, however, did not, sorry if anyone tried to call).
Pretty much what I expected ... though I was offline and can't downlead the
archives from September to see what the SFR people thought afterwards (it
crashes my computer) -- oh well, at least Madame Mercury and Terry looked
cool in the audience, yes?

Planetarium review:  Wow, what a beautiful party.  A little rough on my
car, but well worth the trip just to stand on top of a mountain and look
straight up at more stars than I ever thought possible.  The music was
amazing though it got so cold I spent most of the night snuggled in my
tent, listening half-conscious and wishing I could gather the energy to get
out and dance.  Many thanks to everyone who put this together, most
especially the breakfast complete with coffee!

Job review:  I'm looking for one, if anyone has any leads for me (business
and marketing writing/ proofreading and editing/ desktop publishing/general
administration or whatever) let me know and I'll be eternally grateful.

SFR review:  Whats up here?  Some of our most regular presences are no
longer present ... and in the last few days since I've been back on, the
content of many of the (dare I say it ... too many?) posts has been mostly
off-topic or negative, rude or confusing.  I welcome the evolution of this
list, as people come and go, but it only works when we keep the energy
positive and the information appropriate to the focus of the list.  For the
newcomers, welcome ... and for everyone, a reminder to think twice before
you click that "send" button to ask yourself if your message is indeed
something that many SFRavers will benefit from reading.

Hope to see everyone at MAD tonight!

Much love, Leslie

Ya know, I mean no offense, but what the hell is all this "iz" and   
"izn't" stuff all about?  Is that supposed to be cool?  It's _SO_   
_IRRITATING_!   AAARRRRAAGGHGHHHH!

Please.  I know it may seem petty, but somehow it's just really obnoxious   
to have z-for-s substitution all over the place.  It seems so put-on   
cool, so utterly corny.

Am I alone in feeling this way?

Thanks for writing this on SFRaves.  The story about the security guard 
gives people your perspective, and that is so helpful in explaining point 
of view.  I just had to say thanks.  :)

Okay, Shamini, here's a Mad review for you :) Hope it doesn't burn
up between all the flames...

For me, the pre-Mad dinner is always part of my Mad experience. 
Hamburger Mary's, despite the name, was very vegan friendly. Good 
SOMA dining spot. Dinner was fun as always...

The first thing I noticed [other than that there were no salsa dancers
;)] when walking into the place was that many of the tables and chairs
had been moved away... and they needed it! That little restaurant got
packed!

I was really happy to hear the Gateway system there. At the last Mad,
one of the woofers of the house system had been blowing out, leading
to a little extra crunchiness. So it was nice to see the familiar big
blue cabinets. Although it was a little dark sounding; the high end
seemed to be somewhat hidden.

The visuals last night were extra good. The graphics all night were
great, and having the lasers was a nice touch. I almost forgot that I
was at the Bahia!

There was some great energy coming from the speakers last night.
The DJ's for the night really pumped it out... there was not
a single moment when I had to stop because I didn't like the
music.

John Santos was playing first when I walked in, and he was spinning
some really good minimal trance. Alex spun a really hard set, although
I went outside for some of it to rest/socialize. Ethan was especially
good; good solid dark trance. I've been enjoying Ethan's sets more and
more lately... perhaps I'm just getting to know his music.

Finally, Joe Rice finished the night. This was the best set I've ever
heard Joe spin! I even heard some Orbital thrown in there. He finished
his set with a couple of tracks that I can describe as "trance-jungle"
(Joe, what were those records?): jungle-ish beats (but sequenced,
rather than than sampled drum loops) with a trance energy around
it... He ended the set with some really pretty music. Like I said,
definitely my favorite Joe Rice set, and it was the one I listened to
the most last night.

The music last night was extra good, and possibly some of the best
techno I've heard in one place in one night. Worth two dollars?
hmmm....maybe... ;)

Steve

SPECIAL NOTE : The following is from Mark Heley (currently residing at
Moonpup's) 
 
This Friday (October 18th), at ACME Gallery, (667 Howard/3rd, SF) sees the
opening of PSYCHEDELICATESSEN,  the largest showing of contemporary
psychedelic art and video brought together anywhere in several years.  
 
Featuring established artists like Alex Grey , (Sacred Mirrors) and Paul
Mavrides (Church Of Subgenius, Zap! comix) along with material from artists
in the  international techno/ trance scene, including 'back-drop' art from
the UK's Earthstar and Nagual,  video installations from South Africa's
Project Love, Japan's Video Drug and the West Coast's Hyperdelic, Synergy,
Cyber Dreams Factory, Repsychled Products, Terbo Ted, Ani Phyo, Sharon
Donahue, Tom Williams, Dan Mapes, Todd & Cindy, Craig Larsen and others. 
 
There will also be an interactive installation of Nick Phillip's new
CD-ROM, Radical Beauty and performances including butoh movement from
Ledoh, spoken word, fire dancing, live music from Reverend Markus and
Reverend Yusen Yamato of the Global Peace Orchestra and a drum circle by
Beyond Race. 
 
Psychedelicatessen opens at 7pm on Friday. There is a sliding scale
donation of $3-10. 
 
On Saturday October 19th there will be a benefit party for The Commitee On
Unfair Sentencing and The Initiative to Legalize Medical Marijuana
(Prop.215) which will feature three floors of  trance, tecno, trip-hop,
house and live performance including environments from members of SPAZ, CCC
and Acme. Sliding scale donation $10-20. 
 
On Monday October 21st we present the Awards ceremony of The Committee on
Unfair Sentencing for acts of 'valorous conduct in the War On Drugs'. These
awards go to long term psychedelic prisoners who have refused to
colloborate with the government. There will also be a sale of  signed
(Laura Huxley, Allen Ginsberg, Sasha Shulgin, Ken Kesey) blotter art to
benefit the Committee. 
 
Psychedelicatessen will run daily 11am-7pm until Saturday October 26th. 
For more info contact Lamont or Mark at Acme on 415. 777-ACME (2263). 
Please come and check it out - we think this show should be mind blowing -
and all profits are going to an extremely good cause.

 It just so happens that in today's S.F. Chronicle is an opinion piece
by Ellen Goodman on page A21 ( tues., Oct. 15th ). What is happening
is that two recent cases are being confused together in the public
mind. The first was a case where a 6 year old who kissed a female 
schoolmate without her consent. He was sent to another room for awhile
for "unwanted touching", not suspended for sexual harassment. And his
story wouldn't have made the news except that HIS mom decided to go
on talk-tv with it. The second incident in another part of the country 
involved a boy who repeatedly harassed girls in his school to the point
of getting called on it many times and having his mom called to the
school twice, ending finally in him getting suspended for sexual
harassment. 

 In a great example of urban folklore in action, the two true stories 
have merged to become a fictional one where a boy is suspended from 
school on the PC charge of sexual harassment by a liberal school
administration for the innocent "crime" of kissing a willing schoolmate.

 Ain't humans wonderful ???

There's not too much jungle in SF, so when there is some going on, I
jump all over it :) You can look for a jungle room at the next Gateway
party coming up (this is according to Marjo... any other Gateway people
out there that can confirm this?).

Also, there's a new jungle weekly (actually, there will be all sorts
of breakbeat) coming soon... I will post some more info as it comes.

love and jungle,
Steve

The Li'l Grumpy Gruver's Ten Ways to Save $$ At A Party:
 * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * 

1.  Go Sober!  (zoinks!  What a thought!)

2.  Go Naked!  Save money on those trendy (and costly!) accessories. 
Although this does pose an interesting question: where do you put your
wallet 'n' chain?

3.  Hide a friend in each phat pant leg and split the ticket three ways!

4.  Sell your old stuffed animals at the door!  Old CARE BEARS bring
extra cash!

5.  Put Pert Plus in clear straws and use 'em as glowsticks!  (Added
bonus: makes for a convenient shower in the morning when you get
home!)

6.  Sell aspirin as e, then cover your butt and get out of the state as
quickly as you possibly can.

7.  Do flyer origami for the person working the door!  "LOok!  It's a crane! 
LoOk!  It's a throwing star!  LoOoK!  It's a pair of FILAS!"  Maybe they will
let you in for less!

8.  Become a DJ Bitch.  "No, really, I +LUV+ how you spin!  Now please,
let me carry your record crate...PLEEEEEZE?"

9.  Wait until 6:30 in the morning, then offer to help clean up...maybe you'll
catch the last few minutes of music in between sweeping up empty
water bottles and cigarette butts!

10.  Avoid parties with excessive decorating, lights or extravagant
sound systems: sit in dark warehouses and listen to youreself breath,
instead!  Fun for the whole raving gang! :)

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * 

Hope this brought at least a little grin to your face (even if you're an
ass-grabbin' gangsta -DUCK!-)...these are the words that go with the
pictures for a comic strip that me and a friend are trying to get
together...I'm doing the written and he's doin' the drawn.

I Hope everybody's day is going better than mine...I am the mood swing
queen today and my stupid fucking filing job is NOT helping.

I have been on this list for years.  Most of the people on it are or have 
above average intelligence.

It is obvious from the  azz grabbing post that , perhaps the person was 
either:
1> Joking
2> Does not have above average intelligence.

Treat the post as such and IGNORE it.

It has little value, and is so preposterous that it deserves no note or 
notice.

Don't let someone get under your skin for something as ridiculous as that 
post.

Now can we being to argue about something substantive like we always do, 
and leave mister (or mz as the case might be) "z substitution" to himself.
Another option is a filter, which BTW, Eudora does quite well.

With that I await a more lively debate about something other than booty 
snatchin'...er...I'm out ;)

Peace,
John

this behavior is institutionalized at clubs that have vip rooms, such as
dv8, 1015 folsom, and i think the dna sometimes.  men can't get in unless
they "know someone" (whatever that means).  women can get in if they look
good and allow the bouncer to fondle them.  i've seen vip room bouncers
allow a women to go in, but keep her boyfriend out, even when they are both
dressed comparably well.

this bugs me.  if i had time, i would take my tiny little camcorder and do
some discreet video taping and sue the club for either harassment or
discrimination.  i would love to see a major club get shut down for this.

RE: the psychedelic art show this Friday (October 18th), at ACME Gallery, 
 (667 Howard/3rd, SF)

 One of the artists is going to be Alex Grey? Fantastic! He's the guy that
seems to be copied in a lot of rave wall hangings ( or , at least he's
the inspiration for a lot of them!) . He's the artist that does paintings
of people with transparent skin and translucent muscles , energy bolts
flying dense likean aura around the figures. Definitely worth checking out.

 Paul Mavrides is no slouch either, but more surreal/satirical than 
Grey's intense chakra mysticism.

Did you report this to the people up front?

 I remember at Eon to Eon. This guy approched my friend Luciana (The mos
beautiful and the most noticed at the rave, person I know, that I call
friend) he wispered something in her ear that outraged her. She turned to
him and said "Get off me" and she amediatly started to walk away. Once he
started walking towards her agian, my smile quickly turned into a look of
confusion. As he grabbed her arm, I approched them and told him to chill
out. I was very nice and possitive in my speech. He looked at me with
confusion, and I walked away with my friend.
 I think that alot of the guys get embarrased when they get dis in such a
mannor infront of there friends, and feel as if they need to get the last
word.
 My friend really blew him off in a strong way. After she would not tell me
what he said, I told her that maybe she should of just been alittle less
dramatic in her wayz.
 I don't know...
 But that security guy should have been reported.
 Even after what people make me out to be. I still have the balls to say
that this type of stuff is not right.
 And when I get to Tribal Massive on the 26th. I will just keep my mouth
shut and dance my ass off like usual.
 If you see a skinny blonde guy that (on the dance floor) looks like Bernie
from the Movie Weekend at Bernies, tapping his feet, shaking his ass, and
rarely missing a que or beat. That might be me.

Peace out scout!

 And the security at big parties (which I know most of) are not perves like
this guy you talk about. They treat people with respect, except when there
job requires them to move people fast , they can be pushy. But they alwayz
know what path is the right one.

In some ways I agree, and in some I don't.  Definitely, IMO serious
personal disagreements should ALWAYS be private to begin with, and private
forever.

Yes, this is "our" list.  But the trouble with the "I can say whatever I
want attitude" is that it ignores the needs and choices of the other 480+
people on the list.  Frankly, I'm  not sure I want to remain on a list with
such immaturity and selfishness in so many postings lately -- sure, with so
many people in our group, there are bound to be ignorant people, racist
people, sexist people, and just plain old
I'm-an-unhappy-jerk-so-deal-with-it-people.

But that's NOT what this list is for, and there is a point where the
wading-through-the-ignorant-shit ratio outweights the benefits of being on
the list.

I often wonder if some of these ridiculous idiotic posts would ever happen
in the "real" world?  Do these people stand in the middle of their
classroom or office and just spout off things like "you asshole you don't
know shit" or whatever?  Or do they at least understand about rules of
behavior in real-life situations, but just choose to ignore them in
cyberspace?

The saddest thing is that many of the valuable contributors to this list
have become silent, either because they've stepped back into lurkdom, or
signed off totally because of the high volume of crap, and I can hardly
blame them.

For those newcomers who apparently don't understand what this list is
about, and how great a source of information, support and motivation it can
be, may I suggest you take a foray into the archives?  The first month's
archives will give some background on the original intent of the group, and
you can see how, throughout the years, the same themes and messages appear.


For now, I'm planning on lying low and hoping that things improve.

yes!  Hackers, No!  Most of them anyway.  I do agree with you though, they are

I just wanted to add something to that:

This list is a forum for the rave community to exchange ideas, get
information, discuss music, plan parties, make new friends, and talk
about aspects of raving.

SFRaves should *not* be something you do to pass the time at work.
Bouncing retorts back and forth all day is completely uninteresting
for everyone else. SFRaves is not a chat line.

There are those us who aren't impressed by how bold your words are
or how snappy of a comeback you can think up. Everyone loses in a
war of words, especially the spectators.

Please, if you want to impress me, post an interesting party
review. Describe an experience you've had as a raver. Plan a
party. Talk about records. Send something to make us laugh.

peace and quiet,
Steve

Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

Hello everyone!!!

        Wow, I come back from a long weekend, and all I am reading is
"Gangsta" slamming!!! Hmmm... Well, what ever!!! I have to thank The Cloud
Factory for an awsome weekend!!!! The space was completely amazing!!!! (You
should have been there if you didn't go!!!)

        So the point of this post is to tell all of you about the first
official fund-raising party for Omar. We intend to throw these parties at
next to no cost, giving Omar's family as much $ as we can, to help them
through this tragedy. We will keep throwing these parties until Omar can
come home and throw them on his own. See, Omar has always dreamed about
throwing a party, and was pretty darn close to doing it. But then this awful
accident happened, and now he can't. So we here at Harmony, figured it would
be a great idea to do this for him, as it would benefit him in many
different ways!!!

        The party is called "A Wrinkle in Time," symbolizing this changing
time in Omar's life. We hope that this will only be a wrinkle in time for
Omar, not a permanent, painful tragedy. He is going through the most trying
time of his life right now, and he knows how much support all of you are
sending him. This party will be the connection between him (in Reno) and us
(in S.F.) There will be a break in the party to provide time for a group
meditation. We want Omar to feel our combined positive energy, and be moved
into a more positive place...

        The date of the party is Saturday, November 16th. The location is in
S.F. The info lines are (408)486-9591  -  (415)263-4885          Call
them!!! There will be much more info about this party as we come closer to
the date, so keep your ears open!

Peace and harmony, 4 Omar,

Greg =)

I asked the people on this list what time Doc started on Sat. but either the
message didn't actually get on the list or nobody actually knows what time he
came on.  So I'll ask again: Does anyone know what time Doc Martin started
his set at Out-A-Sight on sat/sun?  I'm afraid that I might have actually
missed it!

Subject: circle dancing...what is it?

I subscribed to your list, which is a little out of my geographical
region (beautiful British Columbia, Canada), to gain access to a wider
audience and hopefully more answers to my question concerning why techno
music is the music we ravers want to listen to. Thanks to everyone who
took the time to give me their $0.02 worth...everyone had something of
value to contribute. Peace. Unfortunately I`ll have to unsubscribe due to
the insane amounts of mail I face every time I logon nowadays. But before
I do I am looking for some info on a topic I've seen discussed in the last
few days, ie circle dancing. So it's some type of dance that G`s and
little girls perform with each other in order to hook up and make for the
dark corners of the party?? Can anyone actually describe to me the moves
used? Isit like what flamingoes do when they go to raves? It sounds like
something that would be fascinating to watch and I doubt I'll have the
opportunity to see it in the near future as there aren't too many gang
members here in Victoria (maybe 2) and until school is done at is worth
explaining please send me a private note. Thanks in advance,

well, i stopped into f8 to grab a copy of xlr8r last night. they were out,
but five minutes before i got there eric had just gotten a shipment of new
cds in... so i looked them over, and one of them is an astralwerks cd with
a wicked looking cover. it attracts my eye, so i look at it, and the track
listing is incredible! the prodigy, underworld, orbital, leftfield, photek,
the chemical brothers, fluke, source direct, and daft punk. amazing stuff.
it's all hard-edged sounding, along the lines of the prodigy's firestarter
(the instrumental remix is on the cd). anyway, big thumbs up for this
compilation.
but the funny thing is, it's a soundtrack. and it's not a movie soundtrack,
it's a video game soundtrack! awesome.

No I am from Fremont. I don't really join the circles. But I have had them 
form around me. If a circle dancer come up to me with that competative 
attitude, I will usually throw down some moves though.  =]:..

I just wanted to add something to that:

This list is a forum for the rave community to exchange ideas, get
information, discuss music, plan parties, make new friends, and talk
about aspects of raving.

SFRaves should *not* be something you do to pass the time at work.
Bouncing retorts back and forth all day is completely uninteresting
for everyone else. SFRaves is not a chat line.

There are those us who aren't impressed by how bold your words are
or how snappy of a comeback you can think up. Everyone loses in a
war of words, especially the spectators.

Please, if you want to impress me, post an interesting party
review. Describe an experience you've had as a raver. Plan a
party. Talk about records. Send something to make us laugh.

peace and quiet,
Steve

Just thought I'd ask all you that might be planning on going to the 3rd BBQ
& BEATS Nov 16th what kind of music do you want to hear. Please cast your
vote if you plan on going or are considering it.  I'll tally it up and see
what I can do, this bbq is for YOU. Remember this will be during the day,
unless I happen to find a place to have it at that can go until late at
night and get my BBQ to with out having to haul it down hills or anything.
So send in the request...only one vote per customer please..

Also if you have a certain DJ that you want to hear that doesn't mind
volunteering there time let me know. I can't promise anything, but I will
give everyone a fair chance because this is about what you want, not me.

Funny how names change with the times.  I remember it being called
firewalking when I got into it...  I think the mating connotation came
from the breakdancing genre, however, I can just relate to my personal
experiences.

In the past 6+ yrs that I've been in the scene I've been a dancer.  I
"burn" ,"shred", "go off".  I enjoy the feeling of syncing my body to
the beat of the music, and syncing to others frequencies dancing with
them.  The Circle is indeed a grounds of proving.  To who or what your
proving is up to you.  I usually prove to myself that I can express
myself to my fullest. Commune with whatever higher entites may exsit... 
And sometimes to get to that state you need to find other eagles to fly
with (I.e. other firewalkers, breakdancers, circle dances ect...) .  The
Circle is also a learning area if you let it.  The circle welcomes all
as we did the wheelchair bound gentleman @ the prop 215 party.  The
Circle allways has been (and allways will be ) part of my Rave
culture...

And although I've been "bustin' moves" since 90'  not once have I used
this ability to pick up on females... It dosen't upset me to see peoples
perceptions of this, but it does alienate me and make me feel a little
less understood...

Precedence: bulk


I'm not going to participate in today's flame war, but I've got to say this:

As Nancy pointed out, women (usually) feel safer at raves because there is a 
(relatively) high respect level in that environment.  The overwhelming 
majority of women don't like strangers taking liberties with their bodies.  
Apparently a young boy, whose mother failed to instill a healthy, normal 
sense of respect for other people in him, has taken it upon himself to make 
a profoundly sexist statement and then to defend that statement in the most 
immature manner available to him.

Ladies, this page is about raves.  Please PUBLICLY voice your opinion about 
how you wish to be treated at raves.  

The question is simple: do you find it acceptable to have a stranger fondle 
you at a party?

Perhaps by responding publicly, you can take up where this young boy's 
parents left off by instructing him on the right and the wrong of social 
interaction.

I'm not going to participate in today's flame war, but I've got to say 
this:

As Nancy pointed out, women (usually) feel safer at raves because there is 
a (relatively) high respect level in that environment.  The overwhelming 
majority of women don't like strangers taking liberties with their bodies.  
Apparently a young boy, whose mother failed to instill a healthy, normal 
sense of respect for other people in him, has taken it upon himself to make 
a profoundly sexist statement and then to defend that statement in the most 
immature manner available to him.

Ladies, this page is about raves.  Please PUBLICLY voice your opinion about 
how you wish to be treated at raves.  

The question is simple: do you find it acceptable to have a stranger fondle 
you at a party?

Perhaps by responding publicly, you can take up where this young boy's 
parents left off by instructing him on the right and the wrong of social 
interaction.

   Subject:  RE: Women and Safety At Raves: Please respond to the list
             (LONG)


Ok, here is my personal take on sexual issues at raves.  There are
several issues here, in my opinion.

#1:  Raves are not clubs.
Yes, people dance in both environments, but for different purposes. 
There is crossover between the scenes, of course, both in people and
attitudes, but my experience with the two has been that clubs are much
more sexually oriented.  Maybe this has to do with the fact that people
are drinking, and alcohol *IS* a social lubricant, but so is e (in fact, e is
even MORE so...see below) and I think it has more to do with the
attitudes of WHY people go to each place.  People go to raves TO
DANCE first, SOCIALIZE second.  When I go to clubs I go to socialize first
and dance second (thus, why I don't make it to clubs frequently).  Some
of the confusion with how to behave sexually at raves I think comes
from the impression that raves are just all-night clubs where someone
couldn't get a liquor license.  WRONG.

#2:  E is for ECSTACY, not rEtardation
Ecstacy is an empathogen.  One of the ways to comprehend the
empathy it induces is through feelings of love...and one of the ways to
express love is through touch.  This can be a hug (who's gotten that
HUGE BUZZ off of a hug on e?  I have, I have), or a back-rub or a kiss.  I
think some people get this kind of confused and skip those middle logical
steps and say "OOH!  E MAKEZ YOU REALLY HORNY!"  I have had
boys/men/whatever sit down next to me at parties and ask if I'm on e.  I
don't like to lie (even though I should know better) and say "Yes."  Then
the above said person says totally straight faced "have you found a
groping partner for the evening?"  Like that's what is to be done on e! 
What an abuse of a potentially wonderful drug!

#3:  Raves ARE social situations
And I HAVE met people I'm attracted to at parties and I HAVE hit on them
and (yes) I have been reduced to one of those people making out in a
corner.  It DOES happen.  Just like it could happen in any other
environment, only when you meet someone attractive at a grocery store
you don't typically go curl up in a corner by the boxed cereal and start
making out.  Raves are open environments, so things DO happen, I just
think that it's not fair to assume that they SHOULD.

I have to acknowledge here that there is a double standard.  As a
woman, I have been high on ecstacy started chatting to some cute boy I
really like and reached up, grabbed the back of his head and stuck my
tongue down his throat.  If I was a man this would not seem nearly so
cute and assertive to the recipiant as it has the few times (ew, ok, I'm
exposing my skeletons, here!) I have done such a thing.  It's sick and not
very pc of me to say it, but I can DO things like that because women in
society are the ones who have gotten stuck with being the "green light"
sexually...which means when we want it, a lot (NOT all) of the time we
can get it.  (eek, am I actually saying this?  ...hmm)

Anyway, now that I've offended myself (and probably half the list) I will
ask if anyone has read a document on-line called "E is for Ecstacy."  I've
got it linked to my homepage at
http://weber.u.washington.edu/~ameadow if you want to go find it, but it
has a great point about how women have a lot of fun on e because it
ISN'T a horny drug like alcohol, in fact it can cause impotence in men at
times (hmm, been there, seen that, TEE HEE!  *duck*) and so women feel
more comfortable at raves because they don't feel like they're constantly
fending off horny drunk men.  That whole document is really interesting,
it's worth a read if you can find the address...I wish I had it handy...

ANYWAY.  My point is that sexual relations at raves, like in any social
situation, is complex.  Duh.  Toss in low lights, loud music, ecstacy and
maybe some slightly inexperienced kids and you get TOTAL CONFUSION
and gangsta ass-grabbers.

I don't know if any of this has made any sense...thanks for letting me
type it though.

Ummm... I nor any other female that I know of responds in a sexy, 
positive manner to having rear ends slapped, or anything else thrown into 
their personal space without their consent. We are not horses, we do not 
need to be checked for gluteal firmness. If you really want to let 
someone know you really want to -get it on- and you think the chick is the 
really loose type, there are less invasive ways of approaching her and 
really -score(!)-.
Same thing with kissing (it just makes my glasses smear, not make me horny),
same thing with smut dancing (I want to bust my moves not bust a move 
with you!)
Things of this nature have only made me feel disgusted, violated, and cheap.
Usually when it happens I am too astonished to express my astonishment, 
so -beware- if you do those things they are not nice things to do.
Women don't always express their sentiments about being violated. Take 
rape for example; it is such a serious issue yet there is such a stigma 
surrounding it.

 Wrongo again bucky boy!! You incited the riot by your original post and 
kept it up by keeping your responses public rather than private. You 
started this mess, you can end it.

 You can recitify your intial mistake by taking responsibility for the 
responses to your post and by going private.

 I find it interesating to note that I tried to take this private [which 
yoou responded to] after which you then posted to me and the list.

 My original post is just misunderstood.. You started it by cussing up a 
storm of evil.
Your the one that fueled this fire the most.
 I just publicly defended myself. Becouse you publicly attacted me.
 But I am done with you bub. You were last nights flamer.
 You can take it how ever you want. But you can qoute me about what you 
disagree with in private. That way I can explain it to you in private if 
you get the wrong impression.
 Oh.. But thats not your stile right Randy.. You need to put on your front 
for everyone! I forgot.

 Anywayz. I am on overtime now. Keep it up. I will read my mail ASAP when I 
get home.

 You started it. No you started it! Nuh uh.. You did!! You did!! YOu did!!

First off, kudos to the sisters who have responded to this whole issue
so far...well put, and very representative of the whole issue...Ariel in
particular put forth a view I never really thought of before...the whole
double standard thing.  This makes it all messy of course.  But I'm
really glad you wrote it Ariel, because it can be true. 

My personal opinion on this is that if you respect the 
person you're dealing with as a human being, you wouldn't want 
to do anything to make them feel bad or violated in any way. 
(I think the assgrabbers or "assgrabbing isn't a big deal" people 
on this list have realized from recent responses that no, women 
DON'T like being groped by strangers at raves (or anyplace else), 
that it makes them feel violated and angry, even if they don't show 
it at the time.  Oh, rest assured, for every woman who is taken 
aback by an unwelcome misogynistic gesture and isn't able to respond 
right away, there are those of us whose first instinct will be to 
kick you VERY HARD in the place that it hurts the most to make our 
opinions very clear. Ok, long aside.)

One thing that we women should think about, is that we shouldn't take
advantage of the social stigmas for our benefit.  Sure, chances are if
we without warning grab a guy's butt or "stick our tongue down his throat"
;-) that he's not going to tell you he feels violated.  Maybe most 
won't feel violated. 
But there ARE some guys who will feel lame about it, but would never 
admit it, perhaps even to themselves, because they'd feel like a ween
because they're "supposed" to want that as a "man".  I've talked to guys
who have shared this viewpoint before.  Guys, care to share your 
take on that?  
I have no problem with spontaneity or making out in corners...show 
your love in whatever way you see appropriate :o) As long as it's a 
mutual thing, you know?  And if you're not sure it's a mutual wanting, 
it's probably a good idea to check first!!  :P

ok, that's this girl's opinion...

Back when the company I work for was a startup, I had a coworker who
would regularly do this to the president of the company, as well as his
coworkers. They wouldn't fire him because his code output was
equivalent to about 20 "manageable" programmers. I think he spent so
much time behind the computer that he took "flaming" habits into the
realm of real life. Of course, he was always 100% right and brutally
honest in telling everybody how things really were (except for
politics)... I regularly applauded his abusive behavior as the
then-president of the company really was a tie-wearing wanker (also
known as a "stanford MBA") that really didn't know shit about anything
and made so many wrong decisions that his  name is synonymous with
"fool" in Silicon Valley (just little things, like president S.H. being
too miserly to properly support Marc Andreesen's ambitions (you know
the Netscape guy) back when he worked here, not supporting Marc Pesce
(you know the VRML guy) back when he worked here....), not supporting
Simon Spero (you know the HTTP-NG guy) back when he worked here...). 
Good thing S.H. is long gone, long forgotten (and Steve, if yer reading
this for some reason, a big FUCK YOU for the cowardly back-stabbing
after your departure!!!).

Then again, thinking back to where Marc Andreesen is now and the trauma
of bad engineering that Netscape is perpetrating on the world-wide-web
community, I particularly appreciate said verbal flamer's regular
public abuse of Marc Andreesen (e.g. "waste of skin" "couldn't program
his way out of a paper bag if his life depended on it"), and I even wax
nostalgic about his regular verbal abuse of myself....

i don't know about others, but E does NOT make me horny... but it does make

s*xual, even on E.

>What an abuse of a potentially wonderful drug!

i think the abuse comes when people stop respecting other peoples
boundaries... thankfully there is less of that in the rave scene than there
is elsewhere.

there is a big difference between liking someone and expressing your
fEElings physically (to whatever extent you're both comfortable with)
versus going up to a perfect stranger and _expecting_ them to do
kiss/grope/whatever.

very true... i've seen this happen at raves and it always bothers me,
because if i happen to be feeling kissy some night, i can't just be totally
open and forward about it, i have to find people who i already know like to
kiss at raves, or else just forget about it and it'll happen if it happens.
on the other hand, it's still just a matter of peoples boundaries-- women
tend to more easily offend at physicality from ppl they don't know very
well-- and i wish to respect those boundaries...

if you want to _do_ something about that double-standard you can: either
(a) ask first before sticking your tongue in someones mouth, or (b) don't
get offended when some guy who thinks you're cute kisses you all of a
sudden. i think (a) is probably a better (more respectful) solution.

>ANYWAY.  My point is that sexual relations at raves, like in any social

ok, let me pose a question to the list:

what is sexual and what isn't?

i've had experiences with people that any sober observer would have called
sexual (kissing/"making out" with someone in a chill room) that we didn't
consider sexual at all.

and then i've had experiences, almost indistinguishable from the former to
our hypothetical sober observer, that most definitely _were_ sexual.

i have trouble figuring out where the line is. and if it matters.

so, where do YOU draw the line between "not sexual" and "sexual"? and does
this line coincide with the line between what won't offend you and what
will? or does it depend who you're with?


hugs;

if (i won't offend you with a kiss)
{
        kisses;
}
else
{
        more hugs;
}

i think that's true of some guys... personally i would be a bit, um,
surprised if a girl just kissed me totally out of the blue...  if she
_asked_ first, it would be no problem-- i like to kiss. by asking (or
making kissy gestures or something) i would feel more respected and
wouldn't be caught off-guard.

Right before somebody gets hauled off to the principal's office for
throwing dirtclods and spitting. Alas, no recess monitors here at SFR.
(Generally a good thing)

I'd just like to offer this suggestion:

If you read something that raises your hackles, go ahead and write whatever
vitriolic spew you'd like in return, but don't send it immediately. Wait 15
minutes and go back and reread what you've written and see if it's really
expressing what you want to say in an intelligent and succint manner or if
it's merely an overwrought emotional reaction. Then decide if you want to
send it, and if you still do, whether or not to send it to the entire list.
I've yet to see a contructive end to a flame war.

All IMHO, of course.

My debate was on people calling there fellow ravErs "gangsta's". 
  The booty thing was my way (when I was upset) of telling the girl that
sent the last "gangsta" message I could totorate, to... "Shut the hell up
racist!" 
  Then all of you rambled on about the booty thing for days!   Twisting it
into a sexist remark, one that it wasn't writtin for.   And I had to get
enough word in, to atleast make someone understand what I meant... Which
more than expected, did.
  I just started reading this garble about a week ago. And all I have read
about is how you people get so-o-o upset when the "gangsta's" start showing
up. "Poor babies"
  I thought that the ravE was finally the one place I had found, where
everyone was the same. Nobody tripped off differences.
  But you are all still talking shit about one another.
  And for the name calling nStuff. I have been doing it on here for six
years now. And it's alwayz fun. Sorry. Someone wants to Vent or flame on
me. COOL! Lets play. Everyone has there hobbies.
  One thing I have noticed in the past 24 hours though.  The gangsta's
thing has quietly slip out of the list. Atleast enough to notice a change.
  If I have something to say about any diologue posted on this list later
in life. I will make sure to get a mediator to write out my opinion for me.

Ok? Ok...
Peace out scouts!

yeah, Mark's one of the good guys :)

San Diego is a very different world. in terms or raving, you really don't
have the luxary to be selective in your partying. there are ((or at
least at one time: were)) only a handful of DJ's that really had the
skills. Mark was one of those veterans who had achieved a local folk hero
stautus in the community, but without any of the negative aspects normally
associated with that title. no one really talked shit about him, there
weren't any rock star accusations, the guy didn't do heroin, and he tended
to put out good tapes. Mark's just a real likeable guy.

Word is that he and Lotus are moving into a house in these parts.

        OK, I am bored at work, so considering that I am female gender I
feel like saying something on this topic.

        Intro: I've been raving for 8 months now, and last 5 I spend raving
with Marc (my BF), so some of my opinions might have been influenced by
that.

        I don't like when people touch me - grab me, at raves or any other
places.  I don't like when people check me out and make rude comments about
the way I look (verbally or just with their expressions).  And, maybe I ask
for it, by wearing tiny tops that show my belly-button, although that is
not my intention.  Sometimes I get angry (happened to me at 215, and I was
in the state of mind when I wasn't scared, and I was ready to punch this
big 'G' kind of guy - I tried to get Marc's attention but he was in a
different world.  If you know me, you know I would have gotten my ass
kicked big time).  Almost always I can control my anger for my own good :).

        I used to be able to deal with it better - when I lived in bar /
club world.  That's the way people are, and you get used to it, by behaving
like that in return.  I used to be able to walk up to a cute guy, talk to
him, get him drinks, ask-for-whatever-I-wanted and usually get it...  I
used to drink a lot and alcohol just makes me very confident, horny and
ready to do whatever it takes to get what I want.

        At raves, I feel totally different.  Majority of people who are
there are not there to get laid (or maybe I am just a naive silly person),
but rather to meet other people and make friendships.  If somebody was
grabbing me at a rave I would feel angry and maybe even scared, because my
'protective wall' is down and I feel more relaxed and secure in that
atmosphere.  I don't feel like I have to act bitchy or be tough just to be
a small part of the scene, because being who I am makes me a part of it (at
least I hope).
        I am not one of those people who like puppy-piles and hugging
everybody.  I hug my friends, but I don't believe in kissing/making out
with every possible creature that happens to be next to me.  I know people
who do, which is cool if everybody is into it - it's just not something for
me.

       Another thing that changed for me since bar world (I am saying this
in response to Ariel's post) is that I don't have that confidence I used to
have.  Maybe I just envy her for beeing the way I used to be :(.  Before
Marc and I started going out (I don't do it now) I used to see cute guys
and just be able to look at them and think how great would be to kiss them
or even just talk to them.  But that's where it would end at.  Same feeling
most people have when they are 11 years old.  Pretty silly, cosidering that
I have no problem talking to other people.  And I am not sure if there is
anything I could do about it.  I don't have to worry about that now, but
there will be time, when I will feel like talking to a cute guy and wishing
I had couple beers and my confidence back...

        OK, enough babbling, I should get back to work.  Sorry this got off
tangent.

Hugz,
*B*

I am a total trance junkie! My favorite DJ is Ethan (215, MAD, and F8
all this week! See ya at F8). The energy I get from Goa and Trance is
just magical. There is no substitute on the dance floor. 

But, I have been cought dancing in the chill room (stepping cautiously
about the tired ones). And, for work and home listening I've been
purchacing some ambient and other stuff. Actually I still listen to
Goa Trance, Prana, Dragonfly or the like in the morning, but ...

The ambient music stuff has been growing more than any other type of
electronic music, or so it seems to me. One interesting style is the
"Drum and Bass" stuff. To my ear it is like a combination of jungle
and ambient.

I picked up this CD by PLUG called "drum'n'bass for papa" on blue
angel records. I really like it. It is very sample based, very
intricate, and I think it is made quite well (production, taste,
original, etc.). It often sounds like movie sound track music, but too
much movement for an actual sound track. It gets me going in a totally
different way than trance. Kindof "picks you up while it relaxes" like
they say in those old coffee achiever commercials.

With my own music, I often try to do trancy stuff, but it often comes
out sounding a bit like this stuff, only with beats other the the
classic jungle break. People often say my stuff sounds like movie
sound track sounds, because it sort of takes you on a journey (I like
to think). So, I was quite pleased to hear this stuff. I've also added
some jungle beats recently.

Anyway, does anyone know who else sounds like PLUG, or have a more
clear definition of drum'n'bass, or any comments. It seems like
trip-hop and ambient dominates the chill rooms. Are you hearing
drum'n'bass in chill romms more? I'm usually not so carefull a
listener in the chill rooms.

  Before I get into this, I want to say - great post!  I was really glad
to see some more balanced perspectives show up on the list.  Flamefests
are cool & all, but when nobody is actually *saying* anything, they're
boring as hell.
  Anyway, the issues of double standards & physical boundaries are really
fascinating and I do have some things I'd like to add.  First, quickly, I
would personally be upset, angered, and hurt if anyone kissed me without
my say-so.  Generally, I think it's a good idea to bear in mind that
others may have different physical boundaries than yourself.
  In general, I think it's important to communicate.  Empathy counts, by
the way, and so do body language, etc.  It's possible without words to
tell someone you'd like to hug, ... them - no need to be extremist.  But
respect is a huge part of PLUR.  I'm a firm believer in empathy, however -
I'm confident that for the simple reason that I'm *not* into kissing, no
one will ever surprise kiss me (there may be other reasons too <-- note
self-deprecating humor... eliminates the need to flame!).  But that's
extremely optimistic, and apparently doesn't work too well in the
butt-grabbing dept. for many people... :(
  I guess I think it's really important that everyone be clear in their
own head what their boundaries are *before* messing around with
psychoactives.  And it's even more important to bear in mind that everyone
has different boundaries, and that those boundaries should **always be
respected**.  If you're not sure, ASK - don't GUESS.
  Anyway, now that this has actually evolved into a relevant and
interesting *discussion* (as opposed to a flamefest between several people
- - all with severe foot-in-mouth disease) I'm interested in hearing
reactions!  Keep it up!
  And if you feel the need to flame me for whatever reason, keep it off
the list please!

i would NOT like it if someone smooched me with out asking first. in fact
that is how my first kiss happened years and years ago, it was horrible, i
went "iigewwwerresghh (sounds of suffocating)" and generally felt pretty
bizzare. not a good thing. 

do people ever sort of hang out and talk about the music/vibe/feel of the
place and inquire about life, friends, interests and such? 

i see bunches of scoping at every place i go, and sure i do it to, but i
always think it would be swell if someone would come up to me and say
something like, "hi, how are you doing?" and then we could chat and feel
happy about meeting someone who was not thinking in their sneaky mind "oooo,
how can i get this man/woman horizontal??" 

well, well well.... just notes from a not excessively horny boy. 

also, just in case people forget, bunches of boys like boy's butts better
than girl's.

Wow, now we're getting some good stuff out, here!  Intelligent   
conversation springing up out of what started as pure crap... gotta love   
it.

My compliments to Ariel and Shamini for some thoughtful and open   
responses.  Shamini, it's really refreshing to hear a note of   
thoughtfulness about the position social stereotypes can put a guy in, in   
a world that seems to often assume that only women suffer from   
stereotypes.

I find this REALLY interesting... I'm trying to find an honest reply.  I   
guess it all comes back to whether or not the interest is mutual.  If a   
woman I find interesting and attractive is assertive enough to put   
herself on the line and make an advance, I expect I'd think it was great.   
 It's happened on rare occasion, and it was a great to have the burden of   
making the first move lifted.  Besides, it's powerfully attractive when   
someone knows what they want and is willing to take risks to make it   
happen.  (The downside is that there is a little strange voice inside   
that says, "Hey, wasn't _I_ supposed to do that?"  But then, just because   
old habits die hard, doesn't mean they shouldn't die.)

But that all presupposes that there's at least some mutual interest.  If   
there's not, if some woman I didn't care for came up and stuck her tongue   
in my mouth, well, I'd be utterly revolted, and I don't know _what_ the   
hell I'd do, but I wouldn't be happy.

Maybe there's nothing new said here; it's always been a judgement call,   
you read the signs, make your best guess, gamble a little.  To read the   
signs, you've got to have previous interaction.  So the verdict on random   
butt-grabbing is pretty clear, but hey, that's not even the interesting   
topic here anymore.

Hello again.  I just thought ofan appropriate quote on the subject of 
sexual issues and raves.  It responds (kinda) to Brian's question...

 On Tue, 15 Oct 1996, Brian Denny wrote:

Okay, here it is:

	"Sexual love is an effort to gain friendship resulting from the 
	appearance of beauty; and it is not directed at intercourse, but at 
	friendship."

This is a quote by one of the Stoics.

So how does this relate to raves?  Well the obvious is raves are full of 
beautiful people, beauty in all it's forms.  And raves are full of 
potential friends also.  It's the most friendly atmosphere I've ever 
experienced.  I love it!  (there I go again...)  :)  I never stop singing 
the praises of raves.  Anyway, if this "Stoic" is to be believed, then a 
rave is where Sexual Love gets expressed sometimes in an attempt to make 
new friends.  There is still some ambiguity as to whether he meant that 
Sexual love "does" happen or "could" happen this way.  I lean toward 
"could".  

In Brian's examples, either is an attempt at friendship.  This is justa 
musing thing.  Thought I'd share.

PS  I see PLUR on here a lot.  I've never seen itbefore, but does it 
stand for Peace, Love, Unity, Respect?  It makes sense, but I'd liketo be 
sure.  :)

personally, i was a little dissapointed with the way the sound was tuned.
to my ear, anyway, the bass was much too muddy sounding, and the midtones
weren't loud enough nor sharp enough to give the drums a good sound.
maybe i'm just not in tune with the "sf sound" yet. ;)

am i the only one who is bored by lasers (rhetorical question)? i mean, i
even thought they were cheesy when i saw them back in the 80's for the
first time (ahh.. new wave hits at the Toronto planetarium).
but i have seen some cool effects with lasers. a couple parties i've been
to at the deli (and my last there, i learned my lesson [boycott the deli!])
had stuff hanging that the laser got caught up in and created a nice effect.
would it be so hard to have a hundred or so balloons hanging from the
ceiling so that the laser could hit them and they would glow?

Anyone already planning to go to it?  Myself and some friends are coming 
down from Arcata, and well, honestly, I don't know SF or the area very 
well.  If it's cool, I'd like to meet someone down there and follow them 
to the venue.  So what do you say?  :)

OK, I'll tell you...  I ran into Brian at the 215 benefit.  He's alive
and well and living in Santa Rosa(but he may move soon).As for the
police story, I don't know why he never finished posting it, but I can
tell you it has a happy ending :).  Whatever you think of him online,
be sure to talk to him at a party, he's very friendly and always has
something interesting and enlightening to say.  Well, I hope I haven't
spilled too much personal info.

*hugz*
David

P.S. he sure izn't the a$$ grabber, as we all know he has way to much
respect for wymyn.

Sure is!  There's definately plenty of discussion on the topic to be
found in the archives, as it's been discussed on and off numeruos
times.

Certainly could be focused on once again considering recent
discussions. :-)

So far the best for me was Jon Aquaviva here at XL in Vancouver :)  
although Astral Matrix's gig at Summer Love comes close!

Yo-
I've seen a lot of DJ's in my day but hands down, the best DJ set I've 
ever seen and heard was done by Stacey Pullen earlier this year when he 
played here in SF.  If anyone has a taped copy of that set, I'd love to 
get a copy of that set.  
--Monty
ps-thanx to everyone who went to mad last Monday nite!

Look folks, there's no point wasting energy or bandwidth on a lamer who
works for a low-end Taiwan clone manufacturer in Fremont and spends the
boss's money and time fooling around posting illiterate screeds on
sfraves.

When you wake up and decide to act human and be yourself, Jeff, instead
of copying someone else's "cool" style, we'll be glad to have you around.
Hiding behind pseuds and spouting halfbaked warezdood stuff don't make it
around here.

The whole thing is a tough call.  There are some men that i really don't
mind getting big squooshy hugs from on a short acquaintance, regardless of
whether i find them sexually attractive.  Then there are the guys who,
although physically they might be pretty happening, just give off evil
vibes ... cos you KNOW they're the kind of person who will simply NOT
LEAVE YOU ALONE!!   :P

And then there are the people who SEEMED okay for the first hour or so,
but as the evening wears on, get weirder and weirder on you.  These are
the most difficult i think ... cos it's hard to justify why you were being
so nice to them at first and then become so much more aloof, without being
rude ... but they usually MAKE you get rude, don't they?  :) "Wanna
dance?"  "no, thank you, i'm a little tired just now."  "So?  come dance
with me!  come on!" arrrghh ... 

There used to be a time when almost all the people i was meeting at raves
were intelligent, thoughtful people with diverse interests.  Ever since
the explosion of speedfreaks up here, however, i am WAY more careful about
the people i will approach, or welcome into my space.  It sort of saddens 
me, as i once looked on raving as a glorious time to ramble and roam and 
communicate and laugh with complete freedom and no worries about what i 
might be getting myself into.

By no means am i limiting these experiences to women only.  I know 
there's just as many weird girls out there who probably have annoyed a 
goodly number of you guys. :)  I guess this is really the one thing which 
bugs me most about the growing popularity of the MASSIVE scene ... the 
more people who go to these things, the more chances for utter idiots to 
make life aggravating for everyone else.

it's a long shot, but... 
do any of you college ravertypes have a copy of the September issue of U
Magazine (y'know, that annoying rag that shows up in your box every month,
chock full of Mennen and Fruitopia ads)?

my roommate and I appeared in that issue, in a feature on
strangely decorated dorm rooms (ours was, I suppose, strange).  
I never received a copy.

If anyone has one to spare, I would be forever grateful.  I would also
grant you license to mock me publicly for the quote which 
appears under the picture (see message header).  :P


	thanks.

Subject: sexuality at raves
Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk



Some women definitely are interested in sexual 'expression' and/or contact
at raves, you cannot deny this.  As an (often single) man, I often find
myself in very ambiguous situations at some of these parties.  I mean I like
sex as much as everybody, and it can be a fine line between flirtatiousness
and actually sexual invitation/desire, especially when E is involved.  In
fact, this is true in other aspects of living in SF too.

Moving from a place of much less sexual activity (people have girlfriends
for years, etc..) i'm still struggling with the local customs, rules, and
so forth about sexual interaction.  My question is (ladies, help me on this)
should one explicitly ask before any sort of contact (even if it totally
feels like the right thing to do) (e.g. "may I give you a kiss/whatever?")
or should one just try to go with the flow and risk overstepping the
bounds (which I've done innocently and felt bad about later)??  

The subtleties involved are many, and to compound the problem you get
a lot of young (and not so young) GIRLS who flirt way too much then you
say hi and they act suprised or worse.  So much insecurity out there, in
this shallow capitalist society(I could go on and on).

Then sometimes I feel like an outcast just because I'm horny, although
this may be partly imagined.  

I'm sure many besides myself would like some feedback on all this.

Thanks,

Bruce  (My name's Bruce and I'm a Goa addict.)

Call me silly, but the "substance-lite" aspect of BBQ and Beats,
(IMHO), just makes these parties so special. Not only do we get to
meet the faces behind the signatures, but we get to do so in a much
more productive manner. These parties have given me more than a chance
to meet all of you, they've given me a chance to really get to know
the indivdual forces driving those raving hearts.


 People have

I'm sorry Knucklehead, but you know you can go off. I have your debut
set on tape and I'll play it there if you don't spin. Well, maybe
not...but you should spin anyways.

See you there!

much love and energy,

Terry

	It may not be PC, but it's definitely not sick.  And some men
*do* find such behavior cute and assertive, which is probably even less
PC, but equally true.  Anyway, thanks for being honest.

Much love,

Now we know why Niels' flamethrower comes on so regularly -- he's just
indulging his nostalgia for verbal abuse.  ;)

Sorry Neils, I couldn't resist that one.

moonpup you suck big time.
god knows i'm a pretty peaceful and tolerant person, but you really get 
me going. anyway, just to be polite, i will retreat from calling you 
anything, like you so generously use to do with other people.
let me just say one thing : a nazi calling somebody else a nazi is 
definitely something very bizarre.
yeah sure, you're the famous dj moonpup aren't you...

I've been an ambient dj for a few years now, and recently I've been getting
into more drum and bass type stuff.  Now I've even started writing the
stuff.  Half time stuff though, where the main emphisis of the beat is like
at 80 or 90 bpm's with quick little occasional shots of double time breaks
thrown in....and ofcourse the ambient washy stuff over the top.  It's like
the ambient part relaxes you, and the complicated rhythm patterns tinker
with your intellect.  I always find myself struggling to *understand*
jungle....to see it's complicated structure in my mind.  So yea, when I
play, you will hear a little drum in bass in the chill room as well as other
forms of electronica.

be, which would be cool to do, BUT, it MIGHT turn to a popularity contest
and that's not what I really want to happen.  So I'll just list the main
styles of music that the DJ's spin without the names, and go from there.
I'll put the names in a hat and pick them.  I think that's fair enough and
it get you involved with what you want to hear and it keeps it from being a
popularity contest.

If you have any comments or suggestion let me know. This will be the last
public post about this until further info comes about. If you want to know
the latest info or want to help and contribute to this, please email me
privately.

Thanks for all the help.

I think this is a great idea.  Once you get a list of dj's and types of
music the people can vote on it.  This lets everyone feel as one with
everybody else, and part of the event.  I don't think its corny, but thats
my opinion! =)

Tis hard to say, as my tastes for different types of music has changed 
over the years.  I prefer goa/psychedelic trance now, but if I had to 
choose an all-time favorite set it would have to be:

Tony - The Gathering 2 Year Anniversary - 1993.  He even had it put out 
on a mixtape.  It was so unbelievably incredible.

love,
Amy

Check out Funky Porcini (SP?).  The sound is similar to PLUG, as far as 
the strange drum & Bass feel.

does anyone know where I can locate an "air flight" record case.  it is for a friend of 
mine whose boy friend is a dj and she would like to give him one for his birthday.

she says it is like a closable crate for carrying records and is made of metal.

any help in locating one would be much appreciated!!!

I'd say John Digweed at Nation, and (anyone else see this one?) Daniel (LA)
at Tribal Funk in Santa Cruz, Aug 96 (around 4am). Unbelievable.

     It was a dark and warm Sunset at 4 mile
     
     Spun was playing some old skool acid beats.  
     
     Then he mixed in something that PERFECTLY complemented it, but was the 
     same type of song.  
     
     That mix is still in my head, and this party was 1 1/2 years ago!

OK, my last words on this subject:
[snip]

> courage, you fucking coward sheep),

Although I understand and respect your willingness to fend for those who
speak their minority opinion (like Jeff or Wowser in the past) I think
the list's response was not born out of a "boring new age vibe" but
basically because people feel pretty upset about his viewpoints. Although
I don't care much about the flaming that's been going on, Jeff hasn't
really clarified his point besides stating that he still has to kick
women off his God-like body. I find it kind of encouraging to see so
many people actually caring about womens personal freedom and all that,
given that they're still the "niggers of the world" as John Lennon put
it. Just because Jeff's opinion differs from that of most on the list
(but not from many people in the real world maybe) still doesn't mean
he is right. Just take a look at salaries of men and women in similar
jobs, domestic violence, date rape etc. and I guess you'll agree with
me that some people still need to be educated about the equality of all
people. Unfortunately, that was not the kind of attitude some people have
shown on the list by bluntly flaming away.

I like that one, "a free, playful, uncensored, un-pc thought". In that
respect one also could consider Moonpup's posting the same thing, i.e.
being pretty rude. And I wouldn't consider Jeff's way of thinking playful,
just plain stupid and people have to right to say so. It's only words, like
you said. And besides, totalitarianism requires an organization and the
people here all send their e-mails as individuals. I guess it means that
a lot of people have the same (respect-women) mindset on this list.

Ofcourse people have the right to state their opinion but this particular
one is part of an ongoing battle for equal rights. If nobody had spoken
out about women's rights in the past, you probably would sit at home
right now, taking care of 12 kids and not being able to vote, go to a
university etc. I'm not surprised people react strongly to this kind of
stuff.

> it was said more than once by himself, let me say it again:

Exactly, and people are sending words back to him, they don't kick his
butt. I only wished the discussion would have been more intelligent
(which it is becoming slowly after the emotions have died down a bit)

That's a different thing then when it just happens to you unexpectedly
and without your consent.

> however, when it happens to me and i don't

You accept it as a normal part of life, I guess. That's a pretty sad thing
I'd say. And where do you draw the line? Fondling your but is OK, attempting
to kiss you not? When you allow one, is there a reason to not allow the
other?

It's not about diversity, it's about your body being yours.

Personally I haven't seen much of a clearly worded defense or explanation
from him (which would have been interesting).

Friends should be able to speak their mind to each other.

   Isn't  ATAM the biggest gateway drug? You think?
   E really seems to adjust your charactor alot in good ways. But I would
like to suggest to the high school kids not to go abusing every drug on the
black market. I did way to much LSD in high school, And I will pay for it
subconciously for the rest of my life..
  Be carefull peoplez..

after being gone at work for 4 days I look forward to wednesday when I 
can read my email and see what I missed..usually i come away from my 
computer with a smile on my face, but this time i had about 400 messages 
that took me forever to dig through....that wasn't so bad in itself, but 
what is up with all the negative negative negative negative negative 
energy going on?????

i don't know.

but i decided to do my best to counteract it with some happy vibes.

so hold on tight because i am sending all of you some LOVE and SMILES 
(and all sorts of other good wishes)

PLUR

WOW!  I've been thinking a lot about this whole issue and it seems (from
some of the postings and emails I got) that other people have too...

shamini said:
One thing that we women should think about, is that we shouldn't take
advantage of the social stigmas for our benefit.  Sure, chances are if we
without warning grab a guy's butt or "stick our tongue down his throat"
;-) that he's not going to tell you he feels violated.  Maybe most  won't
feel violated.  But there ARE some guys who will feel lame about it, but
would never  admit it, perhaps even to themselves, because they'd feel
like a ween because they're "supposed" to want that as a "man"
>>>

Really good point.  And I certainly wasn't saying that I walk around
randomly inserting my tongue into strangers' mouths.  In the situations I
was refering to, there was generally a lot of talking and body language
going on, and when I "made my move" (ew, what a PIMP this makes me
sound like!) I was pretty damn sure it would work out.  Although it has
NOT worked out a few times.  I've gotten the "oh, you ridiculous little
etard" look and a hug and had to tuck my tail and slink away, but I've
never had anyone be OFFENDED.

What I'm saying is that as a woman, I can make assumptions men can't. 
Worst case scenario:  I attack some random man with my tongue, he
feels violated, he's 6 inches taller than me and weighs 50 pounds more
than me, pushes me off him and walks away disgusted and in need of
therapy.  We ALL know that the worst case scenario for a woman in
that situation is pretty different.

Brian Denny wrote:
If you want to _do_ something about that double-standard you can:
either (a) ask first before sticking your tongue in someones mouth, or (b)
don't get offended when some guy who thinks you're cute kisses you all
of a sudden. i think (a) is probably a better (more respectful) solution.
>>>

Hmm, yes, you're right here.  I want to have it both ways though!  I
mean...What's bizarre is that of the two I prefer the LATTER which I
know seems strange but let me explain.  I prefer it within the rave
community because it is an open expressive scene.  I would rather keep
that openess and spontaneity alive and keep a bottle of Listerine handy
for those random kissing-attack moments (which, don't get me wrong
here: THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT HAPPENS TO ME WITH ANY
FREQUENCY) than feel like I'm at that college where you have to say
"may I now untuck your shirt?  May I now touch your penis?  May I now
take off my shoes?"  I mean, what I'm saying could be taken out of
context and turned into "Ariel support date rape" which I really really
really vehemently (OBVIOUSLY) do not support...I'm just saying that
affection to some extent is a freedom of expression...

Ug, am I saying I'm in SUPPORT off A$$ GRABBING?  No.  I don't know
what I'm saying any more.  :S

BRIAN DENNY WROTE THIS, TOO:
i think that's true of some guys... personally i would be a bit, um,
surprised if a girl just kissed me totally out of the blue...  if she
_asked_ first, it would be no problem-- i like to kiss. by asking (or making
kissy gestures or something) i would feel more respected and wouldn't
be caught off-guard.
>>>>>

AH!  SEe, that's what I'm saying.  It's not OUT OF THE BLUE...Basically,
what I'm trying to say (in between tripping over my tongue and sounding
like a proponent of date rape) is this:

>I have no problem with spontaneity or making out in corners...show
>your love in whatever way you see appropriate :o) As long as it's a
>mutual thing, you know?  And if you're not sure it's a mutual wanting,
>it's probably a good idea to check first!!  :P

>what an idea... respect and open communication...

Words of Brian and Shamini.  Ah, they said it better than I could.   And for
anyone who is now worried: I PROMISE I DO NOT GO AROUND PARTIES
KISSING RANDOM PEOPLE.  Although...hee hee hee.  The first time I
kissed Timothy (my sweetheart/partner in crime) was at a Beautiful
People and I just interupted him mid-sentence and kissed 'im.  Thank god
he wasn't offended! See, it does work out, SOMETIMES.

:)

Ok I promise I'll be quiet now.

I've been skimming all the BS on here the last 2 days and WOW.  I fully
supported freedom af speech for this list...but.....well...this is
RIDICULOUS.  U guys definitely need to start answering and sending messages
DIRECTLY to the person for whom it is intended and NOT the whole list if it
is something as ridiculous as this ass grabbiong and let's take it outside
kind of things.   I just spent an hour going through a bunch of BS.

My main reason for this post was to offer everyone (who wants one) a BIG HUG. =P

Oh yeah i missed MAD.. =( heard it went off.....
I will actually be moved into SF by the end of the month..and then watch
out, cuz i'm gonna go to all the dinners and mad and wish and.....well u get
the idea.

MUCH LUV and PLUR,
Micron

     First... 
     
     If you didn't go, don't feel bad.  It was only totally 
     unfuckinbelieveable, had some kill DJ's, best outdoor location I can 
     remember, cool promoters, and great people showed.
     
     Started in patented "Andy's in a good mood" mood, making dumb jokes so 
     bad people were just laughing at how lame I am.  Got a call from a 
     certain DJ (who's remaining unnamed but has certain luna-canine 
     affiliations and is going back to England soon *maximum respect!*) who 
     couldn't make it as my copilot, so I kinda got a little sappy... I 
     might have to go alone in the Samurai of Death to where the kindest 
     kind comes from... a two-three hour drive.  Ick.
     
     Fortunately, I found a ride from some enthusiastic newbies (heh heh 
     heh...) named Sabrina and Greg and took off about 7pm.  The road was 
     classic, and reminded me of why I love outdoor parties (the harder to 
     get to, the harder they rawk!).  I get there... and there's not a lot 
     of people there, the directions seem a little off, and some guy tells 
     us to follow the planets down the mountain about 9 miles... uh, 
     astrological driving?  Oh, little pictures of Saturn with arrows.  
     Okay.  I felt safe anyway... we were in a Volvo (which I think means 
     indestructible family style tank sans gun in Swedish).
     
     Two DJ areas, maybe 200 people.  So intimate.  Took care of the 
     newbies, made sure they started off right and got to the business of 
     partying.
     
     (+)
     I met nice people exclusively.  Nobody sucked.  Except me for running 
     out of cigarettes, and being a bum from about 4:00am on.  Oh, I was 
     the tallish guy with the doo-rag/F'd up hair, the pale blue and white 
     flannel with hood, black cords, and gratuitous KGB offerings.
     
     (+)
     Witnessed Deaks spin the best set I've heard in a long time... I love 
     hearing a DJ that throws it around like that.  And when's the last 
     time I heard "DILDO!DILDO!DILDO!" ... best use of happy hardcore I can 
     remember.  Buildups a mile long and a mile high.... Why were there 
     only a handful of people dancing... I'm still sore as hell (neck ouch, 
     back ouch, legs ouch).  Crazy crazy crazy crazy... 
     
     (+)
     Cloud never seems to spin the same stuff twice.  I vaguely recall 
     Gloria Gaynor's "I will survive" at Charity (disco... run away!)... 
     Didn't know he did trance.  Pretty trance.  Damn good trance.  Yay!  
     Also noted... pyrotechnic light show using only the mother of all 
     BBQ's and a lot of lighter fluid.
     
     (+)
     Stoney's tasty choices around sunrise.  Trees, mountains, hills, sun, 
     clouds, sky, fog, that peach to pink to blue fade that went halfway 
     across the heavens, you and me.  Damn.... Funny watchin people go 
     running out of their tents putting on clothes to dance to "Funk 
     Phenomenon".
     
     (+)
     Morning Junglism on the hill. I had to leave the area because 
     everytime I tried to dance I almost passed out.  You just can't stand 
     still to good jungle...
     
     (+)
     Maya's "oops!" face she does when things get chaotic at the 1200's.
     
     (+)
     Took a tip from Gilligan:
     Tikki Torches = Good Party
     
     (?)
     The shadowboxing dancer at like 5-6am on the hill.  Didn't hurt 
     anybody, but it was really weird feeling at one with the world with 
     all the angst and frustration gone from my mind body and soul, and 
     seeing this guy faking like he's tearing people's heads off and 
     pulping their skulls.  Maybe it was just me.  To each their own...
     
     (?)
     Kept thinking this one rock was a grizzly bear or something... I 
     wanted to go up and touch it or throw a rock at it or something, but 
     what if it really was a bear?  Maybe the bear just liked techno, or 
     found a baby Tylenol and was in the mood to hang with some cool folks. 
      Or maybe it was just a rock.
     
     And the moment of the evening goes to...
     
     Anonymous:
     After falling asleep on a haybale in the fetal position (it's the only 
     way a 6'2" person fits on a hay bale), some lovely person woke me up 
     to tell me they had pushed up another haybale up and that I was 
     welcome to stretch out.  That was soo nice... sorry if I seemed like 
     I'd just given birth, but Thank You.
     
     Oh... and I've been sick all week since.  I guess it was pretty cold 
     up there.  Howcome nobody informed me?

I've never given this much thought as in the aspect of "raving" because i
never thought harassment was that prevalent and it's not something me or my
friends do.  But when i read Nancy's post i got some insight as to what it
must be like for a woman, especially in her social life.  Men, i MOST
definitely admit, are not always gentlemen and i think if we make people
aware of this important issue and educate ourselves, then MAYBE we can
atleast cut down on it.  As attitudes change, so will people's actions.

My $.02...well actually i'm broke, so i owe everyone $.02.

Hmm, lots of big names and big parties being mentioned in this thread.
It's hard to choose though (even harder to acquire and remember the
names of the people spinning when you're having a good time ;) )
What makes a good DJ set? Would you still admire the choice of records,
the technique etc. while at the time you thought the rest of the party
sucked for other reasons?

But maybe my friend Eddie spinning in the living room of a friends
house at her birthday party when I was just over in Holland for 2 days.
Still pretty much jet-lagged, after being half a year in San Francisco.
He sees me come in and almost immediately puts on some of my favourite
records. It was good to be home.

I think I know exactly what Ariel is trying to explain.  I also like that 
bit of respectful sponteneity between two people.  You can tell it would 
be alright by reading each other body laguage and feeling the other's 
energy.

It's strange and rather difficult to explain, but when I am not in the 
mood to meet guys, somehow they can tell that.  Last year for about 8 
months I did not want to be physically involved with any guy.  Flirt was 
not a word in my vocabulary and I was totally happy being by myself - 
heck I didn't even want to be a part of a puppy pile or hand-orgy!  I 
just met lots of people and acquired friends of both genders.

When I was finally "ready", thinking it might be nice to share in some 
male company, I did that very night.  Guys can just tell if you are ready 
- at least the sensative ones do.  I think it is all in energy and body 
language - you just know how to tune in, that way you can act without 
asking and still remain respectful and non-offensive.  

That's this gal's 2 francs for this hump day...

love,
Amy

Subject: MC303 -- review

Precedence: bulk


Well, I finally had a chance to play with the little silver box at
Guitar Center in SJ... And well, it was, er... not bad. Okay, I didn't
like the sound (at all), but I recommend checking it out.

My initial interest came from the possiblity of using it as a grab bag
of sounds, especially when I was looking for a 303 emulator. But the
TB303 sounds are terrible on the Groovebox. Roland really blew it on
this one, IMHO. Less like a 303, and more like a Casio harmonica with
filter sweeping capabilities.

The drum samples also were quite disappointing. I was expecting the
thump of a 909 and the "bwwwaaaauuuum" of an 808, but they weren't
there.

However, the pre-programmed loops are ultra cool, despite the cheese
factor of the patches/samples (I seriously did not find a single patch
that impressed me). And each instrument has a mute button, so during a
loop, you can insert a break by killing the kick and the snare, for
example. Neat stuff :)

For some reason, I found the MC303 very addicting, though, and I
finally was able to determine why it should exist. I see it as the kind
of thing that you keep in your backpack... for those moments on the
train... a tune comes in your head; you sing it all day in your head
and hope it'll still be there by the time you get to the sequencer.

But instead, you pull out your Groovebox and record those precious
moments before they escape... yes, I like the idea... I like it. Then
get home and do some real recording. A laptop for musicians? ;)

As a side note, I picked up a Bass Station, but I'd still like to
compare it to the Syntecno. Any comparisons?

Steve

Well, IMO, what makes a good DJ set is which one is the most memorable.  
When I saw Spun spin at the 91 New Year Gathering, I had only been raving 
for a short time.  Listening to his set, was the first time I actually 
'got it'....the vibe, the experience, the people, the music, everything 
just kinda fell into place, and I remember dancing just to the right of 
the DJ booth, and thinking...."WOW!! I get it now!!  This is where I Need 
to be."  I even remember what track he was playing, "Nature" by Young 
American Primatives.

[ to sfraves list ]

 My music prefs for BBQ&BEATS III ... ( no particular order )

 1. House! ( I usually eat too much to do trance effectively anyway! 
      ,and I realize that I haven't heard any soulful vocals coming out
      of a speaker bin in quite awhile. ) 
 2. Jungle/breakbeat/trip-hop/acid jazz  ( dub may be too much on the 
      ambient side for my taste - maybe REAL early in the day )
 3. Psychedelic trance ( after the food has digested! )

Hmm, Favorite DJ's...

Well, at the risk of sounding concieted I'd have to say Im my favorite
DJ, else I wouldn't be spinning...  Although I make my fair share of
errors and I look at other DJ's for tips and pointers.. I'd say I like
my own sets the best.. (I also catch myself thinking, "man, if he/she
put this song or that track instead of that beat then it would of been
deep" at almost every event I go to.  And I go to events at least once a
week...).

Ta da!

Roland makes a pocket sized 8 track sequencer with about 300 or so sounds,
as well as some effects in it for this purpose.   It's a little bigger than
a walk man.

"Let me have silence always in the centre of the shouting, that is
essential. Let me have silence so that no pin may drop and not be
heard, and not a whisper. Escape us for all our spouting, nor the
needle scratching upon this gramophone of the circular cosmic spot.
Hear me, mark me, learn me, throw the mind's ear open. Shut up the
mind's eye, all will be music. What sculpture of sound cannot, what
cannot as a fluid token words, that nothing else cannot."

I just bought an MC303 on Tuesday.  I'll agree with you on the 303 
sounds, they suck.  Sounds nothing like a 303.

Have to disagree with you on this one.  I think the drums sounds are 
increadable.  Again, nothing like the real thing, But there's a ton of 
them, and they sound great when run thru the filters.

Yes, really cool stuff.  By playing with the preset rhythm's I definatly 
see where they came up with the name "GrooveBox" (still dont know where 
the '303' name comes from.....I guess the Marketing Department).  The 
downside of all the cool preset loops is, people are going to be using 
them......to release records......Which, IMO, is really sad because its 
not their music, its some dude sitting in a cube at Roland creating the 
music for them.

That would be cool if it was battery powered, but its not, so you are 
limited to using it only near a power source.

Its a great tool for getting ideas down when you're sitting at home or at 
work (when your boss is not around, of course).  Still dont know how its 
going to work for me live, I'm not sure how much I can actually store in 
the sequencers memory.  I'd deffinatly recomend it if you're looking for 
an all in one portable techno box.

oh ya, the head phone output is WAY too low.  You'll need to run it thu a 
mixer first.

i would NOT like it if someone smooched me with out asking first. in fact
that is how my first kiss happened years and years ago, it was horrible, i
went "iigewwwerresghh (sounds of suffocating)" and generally felt pretty
bizzare. not a good thing.

do people ever sort of hang out and talk about the music/vibe/feel of the
place and inquire about life, friends, interests and such?

i see bunches of scoping at every place i go, and sure i do it to, but i
always think it would be swell if someone would come up to me and say
something like, "hi, how are you doing?" and then we could chat and feel
happy about meeting someone who was not thinking in their sneaky mind "oooo,
how can i get this man/woman horizontal??"

well, well well.... just notes from a not excessively horny boy.

also, just in case people forget, bunches of boys like boy's butts better
than girl's.

 Hmmmmmm...... tough question.... but I think that I can narrow it down to
two: #1 Tracy at the last Tribal Future( that woman can tear it up!! ) and
#2 Ed Colmar at the last F&F! I think that any DJ out there can keep me
dancing despite sheer exhaustion is on my favorite list=).

     In the Monterey area, I have been seeing all of these signs everywhere
that say, "No On E". It had me quite distressed for a while I just would
think to myself, "What kind ao a place have I moved to?? Am I going to have
to rethink my place to settle in and go to school?"

Then, last night I found the answer to my question... A sign, bigger than all
of the others that said. "Urban sprawl costs us all...   -YES ON E" 

I began to smile and before I knew it, I was yelling to my roommate to "PULL
OVER NOW!! I'VE GOT TO GET THAT SIGN!" Soon I was dashing from the street and
over to the 2'x4' sign. Deeply buried in the soil, I had to pull on it with
all of my strength to make it mine. (Luckily, Monterey has nice sandy soil)

Now, mind you, I realize that what I did was probably a misdemeanor, and I'm
not condoning criminal behavior. But, now it decorates our livingroom,
clashing with everything we own. It's black letters on a yellow background
beaming its message from above the computer. "YES ON E."

To everyone who responded to my post privately: thank you! for all your 
kind words and consideration of the topic... I'm sorry I haven't written 
back personally, I have to sneak email at work at public monitors (a very 
tricky and risky business!!!)

I ALSO haven't been able to follow this thread totally (b/c of the work 
situation) but I am so heartened by the few I have read that show a lot 
of enlightened respect for women on behalf of the people on this list.

I did notice that the topic changed from the original objectifying 
treatment of women (the notorious "ass-grabbing") to a discussion on the 
gray area of how to appropriately approach people/signal attraction.  

There is a lot of confusion in our generation about this but I think this 
is GREAT because we are moving away from a more sexist paradigm (rude 
male behavior is "just being boys" or female clothing signaling 
availability) to figuring out a new paradigm based on new roles for men 
and women (hopefully more equal!).  Gender roles are in a state of major 
transformation - our discussions trying to figure out appropriate 
behavior is simply reflecting the positive transformation happening.  :) :)

As I think has been said, flirtation based on RESPECT for the person, 
paying attention to their signs and treating them like human beings is 
hopefully where we're headed.  

What I was initially upset about (actually, will always be upset about) 
is the lack of respect in objectification.  Leering, grabbing and 
generally being rude to women is NOT flirtation - it is behavior that 
dehumanizes the woman because it doesn't care about her response.  The 
whole point is that they can freely treat you in this manner; that they 
believe it is acceptable because you are female.  Whether you want it or 
not is totally immaterial.  It is a power differential exercised over 
women, thrusting them in to a sexual object role without their consent, 
and without any means of recourse. It happens whenever we walk down a 
street in public.

As for the "double standard," yes I agree women have a happier response 
from men when they approach them aggressively!  But it is not exactly 
reverse sexism; women grabbing guys' asses does not carry with it a 
legacy of thousands of years of domination based on a sexual definition and 
subordinate status of men to women; women do not constitute the physical 
threat to men and therefore the fear that a "little ass-grab" can 
instill; and I would bet that most women do it flirtatiously to a 
specific guy, not as an anonymous molestation in a crowd as most often 
happens to me.

Also, it could be true as was stated that women have a "sexual power" over 
men and use it.  But this "power" is based on the definition of women as 
sexualized beings to men, to wield power by accepting this definition and 
then trying to use it to her own advantage as much as possible.  The 
"power", in other words, is itself dependent on subordinated status.  
Then you get the stereotype of "whores" or "teases," women who use just 
about the only means of power available to them in patriarchal society - 
the definition imposed by hierarchy, that of sexualized object.  

Just as the "tease" is hounded by men, the aloof or playboy type of guy 
is sought after by a lot of women (as you "nice guys" have pointed out!)  
These types are a manifestation of the sexualized roles of patriarchy.  We 
have a system of patriarchy with which we are instilled from birth - 
being the horny creatures we are, we eroticize the roles associated with 
it.  

It is my hope that as our consciousness changes - as we move away from 
sexist thinking to a system of greater equality - that what is attractive 
to us will also evolve.  That "sexual double standards" and confusion 
will give way to relations based on equal human beings respecting each other.

It's a dream anyway!  

Feeling theoretical today,
Nancy

	Except that to be objectified "whenever we walk down a street in 
public", "we" have to MENTALLY allow "ourselves" to be objectified. This 
line of reasoning bothers me for the simple reason that it is based on a 
you have no idea of what I go through line. I might make a similiar 
arguement that since there are women out there that will flaunt their 
sexuality, I am being objectified because, in this day and age, I have no 
means of recourse either. Now, am I really being violated in this case, 
or am I letting someone else get the best of me and placing the 
responsiblity for my own weaknesses on someone else? The case of 
ass-grabbing is a bit different because there, one's person is being 
violated.

	Let us look at this double standard a little more closely. Let us 
begin with the notion of a "legacy of thousands of years of domination". 
For the longest time, history has told us there has been a struggle 
between men and women that has centered around sex and power. Women had 
something men seemed to want, and it seems they still do. Now, since I 
was not around for most of the last thousand years (or if I have been, I 
surely do not remember it), I cannot say whether or not women have been 
dominated for that time. Looking at the stories that have made their ways 
through history, I know that either some cultures have allowed women to 
become sexual objects to be taken advantage of (an important distinction, 
because a sexual object such as goddess worship is still objectification 
though some forms of goddess worship supposedly came from matrical 
soceities).
	Anyway, bouncing through my memories of these stories, it seems,
when we look within the bounds of one soceity there has always been a
combination of behaviors, men raping women and women using sex to get what
they want (whether it be intercourse or clothing style or what have you). 
Each in itself is its own form of domination, one physical, one mental. 
But can we say which is worse? In today's standard's it seem obvious that 
the physical form of domination is far more voilating then the mental 
form of domination. But we have laws which restrict physical domination. 
Do we have equal laws under which someone can get legal recourse for 
mental domination? If you are a woman, yes, you do, it can be found under 
sexual harrassment, emotional abuse, and so on and so forth. Can men 
claim these as well? I would doubt it.
	Now let us take another look at mental domination. How many 
places does this enter our daily lives? How often do women bat their eye 
lashes to get a favor, play stupid to get out of something (or to get 
someone else to do it?). Let us ask how a male would go about doing the 
same things. Ok, now let us look through mainstream soceity as to what 
is expected of females and males. If you are female, you are now taught 
that when you grow up, you can either find a job and pursue it, have a 
family, or maybe be a housewife and just raise childs. Either way you 
are going to be working, and most likely, if you are working you will 
not be the sole wage earner in your family unless you are divorced. A 
male can look forward to growing up and supporting a family, maybe have 
a wife that works. (this all is based on "normal" growing up from what I 
understand it to be, howmany people have been raised in a different way 
- by both your parents and the rest of soceity). Here is a little theory of 
mine.
	Now, I personally could care less about who dominates who, or who
earns whose money... I try to stay away from those games, I have enough to
deal with with myself and my involvements, I have no time or energy to
waste on living someone else's life as well. Granted I slip up every once
in a while - ask anyone who has tried to drive my bus up a big hill and
has gotten stuck between gears. I just do not like being yelled at for
something I had nothing to do with. I also do not like being yelled at
people who want the best of both worlds... I shall go on to try 
to demonstrate:

	Why is this power dependent on a subordinated status? Did these 
females perceive themsevlves to be subordinate, or did they play on the 
constructs of an inferior intellect to gain their own superiority? 
Abolsute status in a soceity only works if you buy into it... Why would 
you buyy into it? Most likely because it has something you want or feel 
you need. If you don't want to participate in the status struggle, then 
don't. If you still want things from soceity, than sharpen your wit, and 
take some self defense courses and most importantly, when something 
happens, follow through with your beliefs and don't sink into the 
background, because that is letting yourself be dominated. If you want to 
remain in the role of batting eyelases while being deamed equal, you have 
another thing to consider, at least in dealins with me.

	The same can be found in matrical soceities. Please, enough of 
the women are inheriently better than men shit. Power corrupts men and 
women equally, period. If you switched things around so that women were 
in charge, how different would things be? You might have men have 
revolutiuons from the tyranny and oppresion of females, because then, the 
cycles would just be reversed.

	Which means no more bitching and name calling and I can't because
of my sex on everyone's part. I think in most places, relationships have
progressed quite a bit. Maybe not in business sectors like sales and
marketing, but overall, if you act like a human being, you will be treated
like on, if you act like a three year old who cannot do anything for
themselves, you will be treated like one, if you act like a sexual being,
you will be treated like one... What are you supposed to be? I don't know,
it's up to you to break through all of your cultural shit to figure it
out... So now all the women out there exclaim it is harder for women
because of all of the above mentioned reasons... Great, well, then maybe
you are bearing the weight of all the women in the 50s and previous who
fooled a generation into thinking men were dominate in all views and
forgot to pass on to the next generation the secret of manipulation, or
maybe we males have figured a little too much of it out, but if you want
to make a change for those who follow, your best bet would be to get your
shit sorted, right?! Which means I expect to see every "equalist" out there
helping break down the speaker stacks because although you might not be as
strong, you still can carry something ;)

	The ideal would be for everyone to be treated according to their wishes.
But even if everyone were willing to look upon each person exactly
as he or she wished to be regarded, they would not have the ability to
guess correctly every time.  Because we are not mind-readers, we must rely
on spoken and unspoken signals.
	I think it's important to recognize that being treated as sexually
desirable is in itself neither good nor bad.  Often we assume that this is
bad, that no one would want this, but when you think about it, that
assumption defies common sense and life experience.  There are lots of
times when people (both men and women) wish to be the recipient of
physical cues (not limited to physical contact) letting them know that
they are desired.
	The term "sex object" is usually used in a negative way, as if it
is impossible to treat someone as a sex object and respect them at the
same time.   A good example is the movie "Working Girl" where Melanie
Griffith's character says "I have a head for business and a bod for sin."
(I love that line!)  Clearly she wants men to appreciate her body, but not
only her body -- she wants to be a sex object, but she does not want that
to be the extent of how she is perceived.
	Agression and rudeness are one thing -- they're just plain wrong,
whether sexual or not.  But being politely appreciative, or making an honest
mistake in misreading signals, I don't see this as "a power differential
exercised over women" as Nancy puts it.  Just as plausible to complain
about being put into a *non-sexual* role without one's consent or any
means of recourse as to complain about being put in a *sexual* role!  
	Unless you really feel physically threatened, no one has power
over you unless you give it to them.  Feeling uncomfortable is not the
same thing.  Lots of guys feel uncomfortable when they are ignored by
women.  (Right now I can feel Gloria Steinem glaring at me).

	I agree, more is permissable for women right now...  Hopefully
we're moving toward men being less grope-happy and women being more so.
That would balance things out and make everyone in favor of equality
happier.

	Patriarchy is defined as rule by men, and I don't think that's
necessarily an apt description of social relations in our society.  The
balance between the genders is uneven in  many ways, but clearly men are
not "ruling."  (I know I'm going to get flamed for this one!)  In certain
countries like Saudi Arabia, that's another story.
	Again I do not think that being a sex object means being
subordinated in status.  It can, but the two don't go hand in hand.
Arnold Schwarzenegger and Tom Cruise are sex objects -- does that mean
they are "subordinate" in our society?  Madonna?  Clearly not!
Disrespected by some maybe, but not subordinate.
	The sexual power wielded by attractive women is not based on 	
a definition, IMHO, but on the biological reality of male sex drive.

> Just as the "tease" is hounded by men, the aloof or playboy type of guy

> have a system of patriarchy with which we are instilled from birth -

	Isn't this again assuming that sexualized roles are bad, by
associating them with a negative term like "patriarchy"?  Couldn't we have
a gender-equal society with sexualized roles for those who want them?

> sexist thinking to a system of greater equality - that what is attractive 
> to us will also evolve.  That "sexual double standards" and confusion 
> will give way to relations based on equal human beings respecting each other.

	As long as we don't confuse "sexist" with "sexual," and we allow
people the freedom to be sexual and still give them the respect that we
give to the non-sexual, I think it will all work out eventually.

Much love (& sex),	;)-

Nancy, Ariel, and others have provided a lot of insight into women's
perspectives on all this stuff. now i'd like to offer some insights into
how men's minds work...

i have spent a lot of time and thought observing women's reactions to men
in this regard...

i have seen innumberable examples of a female friend walking down the
street, and getting checked out by some guy, and she'll say either: (a)
"wow, he was cute!", or (b) "ewww, did you see that guy leering at my
breasts? yuck!"

i was confused for a very long time about this and i finally decided that
the response was based on 2 things: (1) how attractive she found the man in
question, and (2) how discreet he was being with his stare.

and it really seems to me that your comment "whether you want it or not is
totally immaterial" becomes an interesting problem at this point, because
women notice this behaviour by men, and if they happen to want it, the men
are rewarded, and if not, the men are accused of sexism.

some men are jerks and actually intend to objectify you. i make no defense
for this behaviour. but many, many men have NO CLUE about the way women's
feelings work. these men see women accepting some sexually aggressive
behavior and rejecting others, and they don't know what to do. what they
actually do depends on what type of guy they are.

the aggressive, insensitive ones get way too forward and behave rudely and
offensively, perhaps even grabbing asses. these guys aren't doing this out
of premeditated disrespect... they _are_ disrespecting you, but it's
because they don't see any other way to handle the situation. women's
practice of the "double standard" that ariel mentioned really contributes
to this problem because:

these guys are insecure inside, and seeing women exercise sexual power in
this "unfair" way actually seems oppressive to them.

and then there are the non-aggressive, sensitive (but not sensitive enough
to read women's social cues), insecure guys... i was one of these for a
long time and still am to an extent, so i can really provide insight here:

these guys do NOT get forward, do NOT grab asses, do NOT take or even ask
for kisses... they just make SURE to respect women's boundaries no matter
how unhappy they may be about doing so at that moment.

a story: i was at Harmony 3, around midnight, going up on E, feeling
physically affectionate-- not s*xual, mind you, just vEry physical (which
for me, as i've said, includes touching and kissing in ways that some
people _would_ consider sexual...)

anyway, i was also feeling particularly insecure and un-self-confident that
night, i was having trouble meeting people for plain ol' conversation, let
alone chill activities...

and i noticed some women (including one or two of my friends) kissing some
people, and observing how easy it was for them to find people to kiss, and
thinking "this is really unfair..."

and that feeling right there can really hurt, can really make you feel like
shit... i'm sure it's nothing so shitty as being physically violated, but
it's a very real, shitty feeling.

my point is that men who are more agressive than i am deal with that
feeling by being forward to the point of offensiveness.

so, to sum up:

1.      some men are complete evil assholes, but many just _act_ like
assholes because they're too unaware, hung up, and insecure to do anything
else.

2.      the paradigm i see is this: men have exercised physical sexual
power over women since the dawn of time. women have, in response, developed
ways of exercising psychological sexual power over men. (ariel's "double
standard" is a manifestation of this...). women's exercise of psychological
power makes things more "equal" on the surface, but it also helps promote
the exercise of physical power by men in some ways. thus i see it as a
self-perpetuating paradigm, and do not share Nancy's optimism about the
paradigm shifting towards a truer, more respectful equality.


--this has been a very long, rambling post... home some of you got
something out of it, and my apologies for the parts of it that seemed more
like a personal rant...

plurally,

brian

Dear Friends & Family,

My computer tells me that on Wed, 16 Oct 1996, Dave Bayer shared (in
part):

	I would agree with Dave that he is not at fault for actions
committed by others, but I would disagree regarding the historical status
of women.  In most societies, women have been treated as second class
citizens historically, because the idea of "universal human rights" is a
relatively recent Western concept.  As we have embraced this concept, the
mechanisms of aggression have become weaker, or less directed toward
groups based on race, gender, religion and the other traditional criteria
for which people have been mistreated.  Today minority women like Marian 
Wright Edelman and Maxine Waters enjoy more favor and protection from
society than do white men like Christian Martensen and Randy Weaver.
	Power in America is not based on sexual dominance, even if we do
have a sexual harrasser as President.  But because we still allow
aggression through government (some would say it's getting worse) we
haven't realized universal human rights either, and so it would be quite
easy to backslide to "might makes right" again, in which case power will
go to the strong, the aggressive, and the ruthless -- probably not a good
formula if you're a woman, or a sensitive man for that matter.  
	And in conclusion, that's why ass-grabbing at parties is bunk.  ;)

My $.02 (it was $20.00, but after inflation...)

				<<< Starchild >>>


P.S. -  Something else to consider:  Few people downgrade their social
	status voluntarily unless they are getting something they consider 
	more valuable in return.  What then to make of the fact that more
	men than women are getting sex changes, at no inconsiderable
	expense?  I doubt that you would see this in a truly sexist
	society like Saudi Arabia...

That one is also off the C2 tapes, don't remember which one, but it goes,
"I'm in a permanent state of ecstasy/Don't wake me up" and goes straight into
what M Normal used to call "that damn spaceship song," namely "Phuture."
Which was *already* six years old at that time!

Who is it that doesn't know the first thing about PLUR????????

P=Peace ..  Something that you have yet to show us that you believe in with
   		your constant insults.
L=Love  ..  Not just for your friends, but to every creature that resides 	
in this universe.  Unconditional Love, even for those that you 		feel
hatred for.  After all, hatred spawns from ignorance and 	
misunderstanding.  
U=Unity ..  Coming together as a whole and working together for a greater 	
cause.  Can you not see that all you are producing with these 		accusatory
posts is just the opposite? (A word of which I can't 		seem to think of
right now ;)  
R=Respect.. I wish I had my Webster's out right now.  Because you really 	
need to learn a lot about these seven little letters.  You may 		be a big
bad DJ with a lot of friends but that doesn't even 		come close to making
you the slightest better than any of us in 		any of our eyes.  (Can I hear
an AMEN!!   :) 


ARGH...(OK agression out now...) Can every one do me a big favor and just
give 'ole moonpup a big HUG from the bottom of your hearts!  I think this
guy is a little lacking in the Love department right now...

Wow...I think I just started a war...

Wow.  This has really given me a lot to think about over the last day or
so.  This post will probably get kind of long & turn into NRR land,
despite my best intentions.  Apologies in advance. 

I can't pretend to speak for men in general, by the way - and as a matter
of fact am always just a bit upset when someone claims to speak for me,
regardless of whether I agree.  In fact I know that I'm in a fairly small
subset of the male population as someone who, to put it bluntly, is
virtually asexual - so be it, what this all means is that this is all
merely one person's opinion.

In brief, I'm not happy with gender "roles".  One of the things that's
been pretty much taken for granted in virtually all of the previous rants
has been that all (or at least most) men can lose control of their own
actions, or be manipulated in other words, by another person's sexuality.
I'm really, really uncomfortable with this generalization; what's more, I
disagree.  Primal urges are all good, but in this world there are many
times when it is quite simply not acceptable for anyone, of either gender,
to allow themself to be ruled by their instincts.  Too many times have I
heard the "she was wearing a skimpy dress; I lost control" argument.
Truth or not, it's not a good enough excuse.  There's no such thing as
"asking for it" aside from literally saying "touch my ass, stranger."

Men, it is safe to generalize, tend to be larger & stronger than women. 
Obviously not in 100% of cases, but an overwhelming majority of the time.
In a world where we are trying to even the scales (not because they are
inherently even, but because we think it's *right*!), this gives men an
extra responsibility in being considerate & thoughtful of their actions.
My older sister (a very wise woman, BTW) once put me through an excercise
in understanding, for which I am very grateful.  For a month, I had to
alter my consciousness to some semblance of the female perspective -
almost every male who walked by on a dark street, I had to see as larger &
physically stronger, and as a potential assailant.  There was a lot more
to this excercise, but that's a general idea.  It really opened my eyes,
and (I hope) made me a bit more considerate.

A couple of people have proposed that women have the upper hand in the
mental arena, whereas men have the physical advantage.  I'm sorry, but
there are just as many manipulative men as there are women, if not more -
they may use different tools & methods, but both are equally nasty.  And, 
for the most part at any rate, there's no inherent advantage women have in
this area (it was implied that women are somehow more able to flaunt their
sexuality - I tend to disagree.)  Physical size & "superior" strength are,
sadly, biological differences that hinder true equality when flaunted.
Mental superiority or manipulative superiority are imagined.  Women do, in
general, tend to be more empathic - however I think (& am well supported
in thinking) that this is societal, not biological, in the same way as
men's tendency to be more agressive is.

And to those of you who think we are not living in a world/society where
women are subjugated & debased daily, bad news.  Girls are still
discouraged from certain subjects in schools at all levels, passed over by
employers, beaten by partners, raped by strangers and "friends", and so
on.  Yes, all of these things happen in the reverse as well, but the
numbers all point to the fact that the situation is considerably worse for
women.

Something else, and here I step into the realm of mere conjecture.  It
seems to me that women have much more clear & rigid societal expectations
to live up to.  Women's roles are significantly more pigeonholed than
those of men, it seems to me.  There is a beauty standard applied to women
that is not applied with equal force to men - not only that, but the
beauty standard applied to nowaday's women is *really* unhealthy.  Men are
still more free to explore their individuality in our society, sadly.

The rave scene is one place where women of all shapes, sizes, styles &
personalities are accepted for who they are.  They are free to dress &
talk & move & behave as they like, moreso than in everyday life.  For the
most part, they can expect to be free from harassment, sexual or
otherwise.  The above all applies to men as well, of course - it's just
more important for women because it's not like that all the time - in
daily life, there are more expectations (behavior & appearance) applied to
females than males.

I should try to justify that statement a bit, because I know it's going to
raise a few hairs.  Obviously (I think,) we are all - regardless of gender
- - free to be ourselves.  Women, however, are more likely to be treated
negatively if they don't conform to some relatively rigid standards of
behavior and appearance.  As a more concrete example perhaps: Men are
pretty free to eat what & when they want, with their weight varying
accordingly.  I've known many women who do the same - just eat what they
are comfortable with eating & are of whatever size is natural for them. 
But these women of any size above *sickeningly thin* can be called fat,
and are, regularly.  Several times I was within earshot when my
then-girlfriend was called fat - she was almost exactly my size & build,
and... well, I'm certainly not fat.  The insult-hurlers ranged from
strangers to family members.

Trying to come to some conclusion, here, I really want to make it clear
that the world is not yet equal (and if I hear anyone say anything about
white males being the most oppressed... I will have to scream!)  I would
really like to see the whole world be as safe for women as a rave can be.
There are many other positive & wonderful aspects of raving I strive to
bring into everyday life with me too, but this one is especially
important.  There are some inherent difference between genders, which need
to be worked at overcoming in the name of equality & fairness - this means
excercizing self control, when you're bigger & stronger (and when you're
not, for that matter :)

Okay, I'm almost done.  But I really want to add & expand on something I
said in my last post: RESPECT is a very, very important part of PLUR.  I
wanted to point out that without respect, there could be no peace love or
unity, and yet it is so often neglected.  It is to our credit, as a
(sub)culture, that we work towards this ideal - but we're not there yet.

I love you all, & implied in this is that I respect all of you as
individuals - including diverse views.  I hope this message says something
like what I want it to & isn't misunderstood... it's way past my bedtime,
so I hope I made sense... sweet dreams everyone!

this point, too, i meant to imply in my last post but failed to make it
very clear...

i believe in sex-positivity, and think it's a shame that s*x is an un-PC,
"dirty word" in the rave scene.

it troubles me to see men groping women, and it troubles me to see women
using their "sexual power" over men, because all of these "power
relationships" in sexual matters just push us farther from a respectfully
sex-positive society.

AND...

OK..here's a little ditty about my experience at Ground Zero in relation to
the whole groping/sexual misunderstandings surrounding E.

While I was in line my friend spotted the incredibly hot brunette a little
further up in line and started pointing her out to me so we did the whole
<winky><winky> <smile><SMILE> <stare><stare> come here cutie..yeah you!
Game and coaxed them into stepping back two places in line to talk to us. 
We talked to them (Sara and Michelle) all the way throughout (sp??????) the
line and kind of split up once we got inside.  About a half-hour later we
bumped into them and Sara asked me to come sit down next to her.  The first
words out of her mouth were "My God, I am SOOOOO high off this E!"  I
thought to myself...great, what am I gonna do now?  I honestly didn't know
what she was trying to tell me, if anything at all.  So I decided to go get
some water for us while my big whopping stud of a friend (Shaun) talked to
them for a while.  I walked around a little bit (still completely sober)
and bought some water and one of those little glo stiks for my mouth (I was
tripping out on other peoples, so I figured I would be a part of tripping
out others!  :)  When I came back Sara saw the glo stik in my mouth and
just stared at it, then she just reached up, grabbed the back of my neck,
and kissed me!  She shoved her tongue down my throat and managed to wrestle
the glo stik out of my mouth and into hers!
At first I was amazed at her talent with her tongue, then I was appaled by
the fact that a complete stranger just kissed me in a way that I had only
been kissed by my most loved girlfriends!  It didn't take long for me to
say my goodbye's and make my dissapearance after that.

Not long after I was walking through the Robot Room, Dancing my skinny
little booty off when a girl with this incredibly cute braided pony tail
bounced past me and flashed a smile.  I started following her, just
tripping off this cure little bouncy wouncy pony tail in front of me! 
Oh...I had dropped by now and was feeling the E somethin' aweful!  I lost
track of her for a while and then I felt a pair of hands reach around my
back and tweak my nipples through my shirt!  Eeeek!  It's Sara again! 
Oh...no,...It's that cute little girl with the pony tail!  Ow...me nipples
are sore now!  then a few minutes later...this time she took aim for my
little boogeyin butt!  Which, I must say, took some talent to grab as I was
dancing so hard!  But she rightly managed to do so and properly offend me
in a small way.

Later that night I found a WONDERFUL woman by the name of Renee with which
I did end up going off to the chill room with and taking a right and proper
trip with...

The point of my story being, Men aren't the only ones that grab and fondle
at raves, it just seems like they are more easily offended by it.  Maybe
it's just a cheauvanistic male thing that is forcing me to post this...I
hope not....

Peace

Have you seen the Roland PMA (Personal Musical Assistant)?  From the reviews 
I've seen, it looks like it's designed for exactly the purpose you describe.  
(Except that it's a palm top.)

this point, too, i meant to imply in my last post but failed to make it
very clear...

i believe in sex-positivity, and think it's a shame that s*x is an un-PC,
"dirty word" in the rave scene.

it troubles me to see men groping women, and it troubles me to see women
using their "sexual power" over men, because all of these "power
relationships" in sexual matters just push us farther from a respectfully
sex-positive society.

AND...

"...if you act like a sexual being, you will be treated like one..."

which i think is something we all should think about for a little while.

OK..here's a little ditty about my experience at Ground Zero in relation to
the whole groping/sexual misunderstandings surrounding E.

While I was in line my friend spotted the incredibly hot brunette a little
further up in line and started pointing her out to me so we did the whole
<winky><winky> <smile><SMILE> <stare><stare> come here cutie..yeah you!
Game and coaxed them into stepping back two places in line to talk to us.
We talked to them (Sara and Michelle) all the way throughout (sp??????) the
line and kind of split up once we got inside.  About a half-hour later we
bumped into them and Sara asked me to come sit down next to her.  The first
words out of her mouth were "My God, I am SOOOOO high off this E!"  I
thought to myself...great, what am I gonna do now?  I honestly didn't know
what she was trying to tell me, if anything at all.  So I decided to go get
some water for us while my big whopping stud of a friend (Shaun) talked to
them for a while.  I walked around a little bit (still completely sober)
and bought some water and one of those little glo stiks for my mouth (I was
tripping out on other peoples, so I figured I would be a part of tripping
out others!  :)  When I came back Sara saw the glo stik in my mouth and
just stared at it, then she just reached up, grabbed the back of my neck,
and kissed me!  She shoved her tongue down my throat and managed to wrestle
the glo stik out of my mouth and into hers!
At first I was amazed at her talent with her tongue, then I was appaled by
the fact that a complete stranger just kissed me in a way that I had only
been kissed by my most loved girlfriends!  It didn't take long for me to
say my goodbye's and make my dissapearance after that.

Not long after I was walking through the Robot Room, Dancing my skinny
little booty off when a girl with this incredibly cute braided pony tail
bounced past me and flashed a smile.  I started following her, just
tripping off this cure little bouncy wouncy pony tail in front of me!
Oh...I had dropped by now and was feeling the E somethin' aweful!  I lost
track of her for a while and then I felt a pair of hands reach around my
back and tweak my nipples through my shirt!  Eeeek!  It's Sara again!
Oh...no,...It's that cute little girl with the pony tail!  Ow...me nipples
are sore now!  then a few minutes later...this time she took aim for my
little boogeyin butt!  Which, I must say, took some talent to grab as I was
dancing so hard!  But she rightly managed to do so and properly offend me
in a small way.

Later that night I found a WONDERFUL woman by the name of Renee with which
I did end up going off to the chill room with and taking a right and proper
trip with...

The point of my story being, Men aren't the only ones that grab and fondle
at raves, it just seems like they are more easily offended by it.  Maybe
it's just a cheauvanistic male thing that is forcing me to post this...I
hope not....

Peace

 Well, that 's o.k. Does everybody remember awhile back when some of us
naughty S.F. Ravers went around the city grabing those "yes on E" signs?!
I remember pulling over to the side of the street one night and jumping up
and down on the hood of her car,trying to get at one of those signs;).
                                 It's all good=).

Tristan here.  I too got the following stolen at the 215 party: five
Sandoz cd's (worth $25 a pop), a pair of brand new technics
headphones (nice ones) and my pager.  If anyone knowds some one who may
have took these items could you please ask him to return them to me by
paging me at 415-220-4173; it's a long shot I know.  
But the begging question is as follows: where the fuck do people get off
on coming to a great rave with the express intention of stealing stuff.
All the above items were in my record bag si the theif had to have had a
good rumaging through my bag in order to find these items in the first
place.  What ever happened to that old rule of never touching anything
that is not your's with out asking permission before hand.  Fucking
arsehole(s)!
If you know or surspect that you know this person tell him that he can
contact me through him for a reward for a finder's fee.  And then tell him
that you are not going to hbe his friend ever again and also tell him that
if I ever find out who did it he will die, literally, the most horable
and painful death imaginable.  Kunt!
Talk about not being on the vibve.
Tristan.

My favourite set of all time was the set that John Howard did at a 111
Minna Sunday morning party called "One Sunday Morning."  Quite simply, the
most blinding set of house/deep house you'll ever here.

     whoever did this will look at themselves and where they are in life a 
     few joyous years from now, scratch their cranium, and ask, perhaps 
     publicly, "were those headphones really worth it?"

Well despite the fact that I got hundreds of dollors of stuff nicked
there; and despite the fact that nobody knows who I am  despite te fact
that I did the basement room and publlicised it like bitch on heat, the
215 party was a
complete success.  We had the most diverse crowd at an Sf rave that I have
seen in ages (even the hip-hop kids were there).  People played exellent
sets including Jonnah Sharp, Tracy (my favourite dj), Astrasl Matrix, a
blinding bit of live work by Chris-Cross and a quite simply
legendery set by Theatre-Blip.  Still can't get the hang of Ethan's music
but people seemed to be really into it.
But by far and away the best piece of news was that we raised $11,000 for
the campaign.
Thank you very much for all coming down and making it such a good party;
it just goes to show that there is no more unifying subject then the right
to smoke pot.
And don't forget to to vote for 215 on November 5th.
And don't forget to come to the next one in November which will be a
celebration of the proposition passing.

For ever encased in a cloud of KGB,
Tristan.

I really didn't like jungle and I found some records in my collection that
had jungle toonz on the other side, and the shit is dope!!! I can't see my
self dancing to it, but It is a hell of a lot of fun to listen to! Anyone
notice how a lot of Jungle(or so it seems) seems to have a heavenly feel to
it, with a lot of strings and sound effects??
Just a thought!!!! What do other people think about jungle????
anyone ever been to a Bass Kru(?) Party?

I *love* jungle, but I don't know anything about it...  None of my friends
like jungle, so when we go to parties I usually don't get to hear it,
because they can't stand it and I usually don't like hanging out b alone.

I would love to get some tapes, or have people educate me :))).  My fav
jungle set was at CCC party ("Untitled") in Berkeley, before BM, in the
basement :) - way cool.

Just my thoughts,

I would love to follow this discussion and answer all of these posts but, 
as I posted before, I have this really fucked-up work situation where I 
have to sneak email praying no-one will walk by and catch me.  <sucks>

In skimming,  I did see something about becoming a sex-postive society 
and no longer whining about sexuality.  Please don't confuse being 
treated respectfully with no longer being sexual!!  It's too bad that if 
women complain about being harassed, it somehow means they are not 
sexual.  I was simply trying to support a more respectful approach to 
people (arguing that the objectification in leering and grabbing is not 
flattering - something, thankfully, that does not seem to be too 
controversial here!)  It is the WAY it is done, the intention behind it.  
Not sex or male-female relations that are inherently bad (hey, I'm a 
Scorpio - you don't have to convince me sex is good!!!)

One other note: Dave said that being harassed walking down the street 
only bothers you if you "let" it.  I have tried for years to let it roll 
off of me.  But when I am alone on the street and I have to pass a group 
of frightening men who start leering and commenting, it is a scary and 
vulnerable feeling.  And people can violate you with their eyes and their 
words on you, just as with their hands.  

I would love to take the time to discuss whether or not men have more 
power than women in this society, whether there is sexism or not, what a 
more sex-positive society could possibly look like, how to achieve 
equality, etc., but there is a job for me to keep and a list to return to 
the topic of _raving_.

PEACE Y'ALL
(and special thanks to all the brothers out there
that showed such concern on this issue - I know it's
easy to feel attacked.  You all deserve - all of us deserve -
a great sexy one-night whirlwind chillroom affair!!)

Fun, fun, fun - there should be more parties there :).

Still remember:

- 6 floors which you could explore
- The Couch - one in the elevator - I spend at least one hour there and got
consumed in The Elevator World :)
- chatting with Wayne and Marci - hey guys :)
- meeting Steve - hey, hey
- MYSTR-E's set - kicked ass (and Mars dancing in a back <- how cute :))

Want to forget:

- way messed up chicky (only on pot, as she said - yeah, right) who was
about to fall out of the window on 6th floor and could not get a clue and
stop talking to us
- missing DRC's set
- missing a lot of my friends who didn't make it for various reasons
- people having their stuff stolen - sorry :(((


        Unfortunately I will not be able to go to F-8, Get Down, Get Down,
Get Down and boat party this weekend (I will be in LA).  It sucks because I
was really looking forward to these :(, but I am sure you guys will have
fun :).

        I will be at FTT, right after Exotic, Erotic Ball (never been to
one, so I am looking forward to it).

Have fun this weekend and I will see some of in a week,
*B*

so I'm skiing a few years ago and wipe out, landing on my *head* and my 
neck goes CRACK! and I can't really move the next day but I don't see a 
doctor because I don't have health insurance.  And then about once a year 
I do something and my back says NO and I can't really move the next day... 
and then it happens a little more often, and so finally I see a doctor who gives 
me drugs, and then I see a physical therapist who tells me I need to see 
a chiropractor because the accident knocked my spine out of alignment, but 
it's not covered by insurance so I don't go.

And then my back is hurting more and more, and I notice that the last few 
times after I've gone dancing I can't really move the next day.  So 
yesterday I finally DO see the chiropractor, and two doctors plus a 
massage therapist are leaning over me and asking, is there anything I do 
that really exacerbates it?

And I have visions of sweaty swirling nights of drugs and lights and 
people and going absolutely CRAZY on the dancefloor, and I tell them, 
well, I kinda like to go out dancing sometimes.  And the three of them 
start clucking at me and shaking their heads and they tell me

you can't dance anymore

if you want to get better
that is

but but but, I want to sputter at them, you don't understand - I'm a 
RAVER!  Dancing is what I DO!  It's what I live for!  It's like an 
addiction - the insane excitement, the anticipation, the incredible 
release in the dazed otherworld of raving.  I LOVE it you can't tell me to

just stop

Yep, I've seen those too. But here in San Francisco there's another funny
sign, namely: Borg for Congress! I can't understand why these people didn't
adopt the obvious slogan to follow that line: "Borg for congress, resistance
is futile!". Got to get me on of those...

I don't get it. I was at the 215 party and around 4:20 I heard someone
going around saying "It's almost 4:20, get ready!". What is the
obvious thing that I am missing about 4:20? Maybe I should just read

That just doesn't make sense! There must be some kind of dancing that
would HELP your spine/back. You could always just lay on your back and
wiggle your arms and legs in the air. I had a boss who used to do that
at meetings because she had back problems. Who knows, you might just
start a new fad! Wouldn't it be cool to see a dance floor with
everyone laying on their backs wiggling their limbs? It would look
like sea urchins in the tide pools. I guess the music would have to be
oceanic/dolphin drum'n'bass. :)

How many times have you heard those stories about sport athletes who
have some tragic accident, are told that they will never play again, but
triumph nevertheless and return to the field?

It's all about MIND OVER MATTER.

Now I'm not suggesting that you go right out and dance anyway. You are
likely to cause yourself more harm. But I'd look in to things like yoga, other
forms of therapy, simple exercises that can strengthen your back
muscles, ect. Build yourself back up to where you are able to safely
dance again!

I don't want to see you putting your self in a wheelchair, so please don't
be carless with your body. But there are many options still un-explored
so don't throw in the towel on your passion.

Subject: But I'm a Raver!
Date: Thursday, October 17, 1996 12:09PM


so I'm skiing a few years ago and wipe out, landing on my *head* and my
neck goes CRACK! and I can't really move the next day but I don't see a
doctor because I don't have health insurance.  And then about once a year
I do something and my back says NO and I can't really move the next day...
and then it happens a little more often, and so finally I see a doctor who
gives
me drugs, and then I see a physical therapist who tells me I need to see
a chiropractor because the accident knocked my spine out of alignment, but
it's not covered by insurance so I don't go.

And then my back is hurting more and more, and I notice that the last few
times after I've gone dancing I can't really move the next day.  So
yesterday I finally DO see the chiropractor, and two doctors plus a
massage therapist are leaning over me and asking, is there anything I do
that really exacerbates it?

And I have visions of sweaty swirling nights of drugs and lights and
people and going absolutely CRAZY on the dancefloor, and I tell them,
well, I kinda like to go out dancing sometimes.  And the three of them
start clucking at me and shaking their heads and they tell me

you can't dance anymore

if you want to get better
that is

but but but, I want to sputter at them, you don't understand - I'm a
RAVER!  Dancing is what I DO!  It's what I live for!  It's like an
addiction - the insane excitement, the anticipation, the incredible
release in the dazed otherworld of raving.  I LOVE it you can't tell me to

just stop

Hey peeps, I was just trying to remember this for someone yesterday... 
420 means "time to smoke out!!" because the number is associated with 
marijuana in a whole bunch of different ways... but the only thing I can 
remember is that it's the legal code that is violated if someone smokes.  

Does anyone know the other "420"'s ??

Thanx

I'd have to say that my favorite DJ set came from one of my first raves
ever. It was Barry Weaver, Doc Martin, and Ron D. Core at Messiah in L.A.,
summer of 1991. I don't think I ever stopped groovin' except when it was
420.

Bonghitter!

I am breaking the mold this weekend (in more ways than one) and going
to at LEAST one bigger, brightly-colored flyer party, and MAYBE even
TWO!  I'm sorry, but I simply cannot pass up seeing Dubtribe & Donald
Glaude tomorrow night at Common Ground.  I know, I know, I know.  No
vibe, right?  Well, this time I DON'T CARE!  With good music like that (aw,
come on: Donald is my boy from Sea-town!) I can manufacture my OWN
vibe!  Honestly, I will just lose my shit if I go to another TRANCE party.  I
know I've bitched about it before, and I LIKE trance...a LOT!  It's just that
I've heard SO much of it lately that I'm actually missing house!  EEK!  ME?! 
Missing cheezy house?

Then Saturday I'm either going to a private party in Berkely or GET DOWN
GET DOWN GET DOWN.  Steve Loria reduced me to speaker-licking once
in Portland, I want to see if he can do it again! :)

SO!  We'll see!  This is my big experiment...I haven't EVER attended one of
the flyered parties here in SF...even when I was here in May I went to
MADNESS, which was reletively small (hey, by the way, did anyone on
the list go to that party?  It was down by potrero hill...)

i also tried to resist the massivity of jungle, but sometimes, with the
right drumroll and or fresh ass sample, one cannnot help but groove right
down to the bone.  jungle will never die, it just keeps permeating in the

[ to sfraves ]

 Nancy Shaw's situation reminds me of my own a few years ago, except it's 
much more extreme in her case. I suspect my dance style ( in which both
feet are in contact with the ground simultanously most of the time ) 
has more than a little to do with my touchy back. I'm just another 
keyboard-pounding slob who doesn't exercise properly outside of raving!

 I think there are still some body workers on SFRaves who can give
Nancy some better advice than me. Also, her post didn't include any
hard data ( pinched nerves? fractured vertebre? "just" muscle spasms? )
for us here on SFRaves to give a full diagnosis and treatment recommendation.

 Best of fortune to you, Nancy

Hi Jonathan!

Check out a 10" single by PFM..they remixed a Saint Etienne track called
"The Sea". Excellent trancey! / jungle stuff. I just bought it about a
week ago so it should still be available.

Peace Brother!
John

You need to get some semitranlucent bright colored scarves and start
dancing all swirly like those deadhead girlz visualizing whirled peas.

Actually, I'm serious. I've seen some ravers (including myself) really
pound themselves over the course of the evening. All night cracker
jacking can't be good for yer back, especially when you're not wearing
sensible shoes. (those 10 inch glass elevator-shoes with live goldfish
in them just don't cut it!).

I don't know if this would apply to your situation or not, but...

After I injured my back recently (blame it on jungle!), I was faced
with two options: (1) stay at home, rest, get better (2) rave. (1) of
course was out of the question, so I tried to think of ways I could
dance and not make things worse.

Here are some suggestions: 

(1) Take a moment to think about the parts of your body that are
injured. Try to locate which muscles, joints, etc are causing you
problems. Identify other muscles that support or connect to these
trouble spots. So when you dance, you'll know which parts of your body
to keep perfectly still or supported, and which other parts can be
used to dance with.

simple example: if your legs hurt, move your arms
another example: if your neck hurts, use your hips to pivot your head
etc.

(2) Dance in half time. There's nothing written that you have to
bounce up and down uncontrollably to the beat [although sometimes it
can be uncontrollable ;)]. Groove slowly to something fast... if you
do it in half time, you'll still get a chance to move to the music,
but you won't be killing yourself in the process.

Also, slow movements might be good for resistance strengthening if
there are any weak muscles that are troubling you (can be the cause of
back problems).

Anyway, that's what I do when I'm having problems, and it seems to be
a good compromise.

Steve

If that doesn't work out, we could always get together for a 420 session.

amen, it's a heavenly track! but i doubt you can still find 
it...supposedly was a very limited pressing. Actually, you can get it on 
a new compilation which features all the St Etienne remixes. 3x12"!

I thought the police code thing was the only one?

side note: apparently that whole 420 thing is only big around here and I
think in the northwest. (a lot like the word "hella." =) People from LA
don't "celebrate" it, but I remember the dorms last year... the guys' floor
got a keg and peple were leaning out of windows shouting "happy 4/20
everyone!!" and other shit like that... I won't even attempt to count the
number of "420's" scrawled on the walls in my huose right now....
ridiculous!!! =)

take care,

Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com

     I think we agree, but I wanted to clarify some area from my 
     perspective.
     
     About gangsta ravers...
     
     Nobody is being cast out by anybody, but might I note:
     
     I just like the diversity of (in my opinion) a "good" rave.  I like to 
     see costumes, funky shit and people who look like a crowd of wierdos, 
     freaks and deviants (oh-my).  Sailor clothes, platforms, Birkenstocks, 
     Feather Boas, chucks, big smiles, goa freaks, tie dyes, people wearing 
     foil, sports jackets, hamstas, handmade jewlery, assorted TH garb, 
     batique prints, funky hats, pants big enough for three, embroidered 
     2nd hand dresses, Docs, plaid socks, day glo, and vinyl clad bondage 
     ninja turtle armor are all badass and they ALL belong because of the 
     smiles and openness of the people wearing them.
     
     Nothing is scarier than when I went to Eon and found...
     
     4000 people wearing the same black three stripe Addidas, baggie blues 
     and white shirts.  I'm sure it's comfortable, I'm sure it's great to 
     dance in, but massives look more and more like an army and less like a 
     party every time I go.  Some people were having a great time.  Props 
     to them, regardless of what they are wearing... But there's some 
     people who I am convinced were looking for a fight.  I don't consider 
     myself a very evil or wicked person, but somehow I managed to get 
     verbally/physically threatened or totally looked down at by people 
     several times.
     
     Sorry...
     
     As for giving gangsters a little credit, I went to high school in a 
     neighborhood where gangs had been around for generations, not the 
     bullshit COLORs wannabe 'cap in yo ass' bullshit I sometimes see at 
     parties (or on MTV, but I won't go there).  Gangs were for some, a 
     choice between living in fear and knowing somebody else was looking 
     out for you, not a bunch of bored kids with rich folks like a lot of 
     the people I see.
     
     I give EVERYBODY (except the guy who cut me off and then flicked a 
     cigarette into my open convertible this morning) respect because 
     that's all I ever wanted from anybody.  Sometimes I get it, sometimes 
     I don't.  When I don't get it from a group of people that are hanging 
     out dressed alike who threaten me or make me feel like I'm at THEIR 
     house, I write it off as territorial gangsta bullshit.  It has nothing 
     to do with social status, race or anything except for people who fuck 
     with me and make me feel like a stranger who has to watch their back.  
     I came to have fun, I paid just like you did... what the fuck?  Smile, 
     it's a party.
     
     Let it go...
     
     We're all beautiful people.
     
     And finally...
     
     Please don't start throwing race/racism labels around.  It looks like 
     you're trolling for something that I don't honestly think you're going 
     to find on this list (yes, I'm assuming but it keeps me sane).  
     There's not a lot of members of the Nazi party too into dancing to a 
     rippin set from Carl Cox, Cesar or Juan Atkins (FUCKIN Cesar & Juan @ 
     Space Children!!!!!!).  I should hope partyers/ravers are waaaay past 
     that, and I think it's an alarm you didn't need to set off.  Gangsters 
     and non gangsters come in all sizes shapes creeds and colors.  We're 
     talking about a mindset, nothing else.  I don't even mind people who 
     run with clubs or gangs, just leave any negative vibe or attitude at 
     the door.  That goes for everybody, I think it falls under being fair 
     and respecting everybody as if the slate was all around clean.
     
     Embrace misfit power!
     
     I love not knowing what I'm going to see when I open my eyes when I'm 
     dancing.  I don't want it to be people who all look the same, or 
     people making me feel intimidated or uncomfortable.
     
     +
     
     Peace:     I leave my spears and slings and fears at the door.  I come 
     to make friends and meet friends, and strive to find joy in all those 
     who are gathered here.
     
     Love:      If you smile at me, I will understand.  If you ask me, I 
     will try.  If you embrace me, I will hold you with my eyes closed in a 
     world where none of this can find us.  I open myself to you.  My 
     energy is your energy.
     
     Unity:     My past affiliations are nothing in the face of what WE 
     could do together.  I come with empty hands ready to create and an 
     open heart ready to understand.
     
     Respect:   I choose to be with you tonight, rather than my mother or 
     father or friends or those I labor with.  I know you have made a 
     similar decision.  And for this decision, you have already earned my 
     respect.

Hi!

 As many of you know (cause I whine a lot ;) I tore a tendon in my 
shoulder a while back and still went raving (and setting up H3's ambient 
arena amongst other theraputic activities). I found that my shoulder still 
felt better than expected after each party. Of course I was REALLY 
careful. I put my sore are/shoulder in a sling one night when I couldn't 
feel anything due to my pain killing cocktail =)

 I believe some movement is beter than none as long as you are careful 
not to aggravate the old injury (too much) or create new ones as your 
body tries to do what you ask it and tries to protect the injured area. I 
feel that if you immobalise (sp?) an area too long it will heal that way 
so that it will not want to move in the future. But it is certainly a 
question of balance and sensitivity to the unique structure and concerns 
of your body.

 BTW my shoulder still has some pain and weakness in certain directions 
but it is doing really well. I think I have the rave community here in 
the Bay Area to thank for a significant portion of my healing.



                      !!!!!THANK YOU EVERYONE!!!!!

Francisco Bay Area_;
   and MARY TEETOR, a needlework artist using tesselation patterns.

A part of that weekend's San Francisco Open Studios, their experimental
art
explores a diverse range of digital graphics, art-science
synchronicities,
sociopolitical imagery, fractals and tessalations, cosmology, light,
motion
and time.  There will be some demonstrations and presentations by the
artists as well.

this can also add a whole new spiritual side to dancing ( well it
does for me)...kinda like
tai-chi or something moving not to the beats but to something else you
find...helps me to feel the music and work into a groove ;-) :-0 :-)

Now that this Subject has had time to get my attention!


   I must say....  At FUSION, "Psycho Bitch & Miss Thing on six turn
tables" defonetly played my favorite set of all time.

   Right before they played I walked out side only to see my friend Wayne,
and his newly found friends smoking a doobie.. Of course I managed to find
a gap in there circle. When that tiny joint got to me, I sucked on that
thing for dayz with no luck at all. I just could not get a hit.        So I
wipped out my own fat sack of skunky doobie stuffagez and twisted up a
fatty. Needless to say. EVERYOne got stoned.
   While I was taking my last intended hit off my blunt, I felt my second
hit Oh <E> kick in..
   I am sitting there baked! My left hand is starting to fall asleep while
the bay door across from me is jerking around speraticaly. I look at the
people in our little circle and think.. "No time for conversation. I am so
F'in baked!!!  It iz time to DANCE!!!!
   I walk back in the warehouse at Pier 17. And the music sounded really
good.. Most of the time when the music gets this progressive, I will end up
walking towards the Dj to see who it iz. I get there and it ends up being
to girls. One really fat, and one really skinny, both totally cool and
having a great time.            I like, was all     Yea!!!  Wooooo!!!
   I did not once stop dancing through there whole set. It was like they
were playing everything that sounded good, one on top of the other for
three hours straight..

   For more reasons than this.....     I will never forget that ravE

Well I guess there is a bright side to everything. If things go well with
215 you might actually qualify for medical marihuana! You will find that
you have many (new) friends who will be willing to come over to your place

Get well soon Nancy...

  Id have to agree with Phred here.  Some other quickly:

 * Dante at Andromeda afterhours (DC - March '93)
 * Wink at Digitaria (Feb '95)

honorable mention:

Scott Henry at Sunrise Festival (Balt - July '94)
DJ Duke & Luke Slayter at Sputnik IV (NY - June '94)
Frankie Bones at Liquid Holiday (b4 busted (DC) - Jan '93)

that was hard.  some many good sets over the
years. but these are the one's that stick out.

Holy Cow!
 It's easy to see from the last few posts on this topic that it's fairly   
highly-charged and brings up a lot of feelings and personal baggage.

It can be really frustrating being a man in modern society.  This is not   
to say that it's not frustrating to be a woman, but I can relate to the   
frustrated tone of Dave's post.  I would like to put in a word on Nancy's   
behalf; I think she got vented at a bit, when her post wasn't really   
endorsing eyelash-batting or sexual double-standards.

That being said, if you're a Caucasian male in our society, you find   
yourself in the unfortunate position of belonging to the only group that   
can't point a finger at Caucasian males for past wrongs that are still   
lingering today.  Doesn't matter what group was wronged, it's your fault   
(so some say).  That can get burdensome.

It became clear sometime in the sixties-seventies that some changes were   
needed, and it was driven by the frustration women felt about being kept   
out of "men's roles".  That's been the steady context of gender dialog   
for quite a while, that things needed to change to correct wrongs against   
women.  Recently, there's been a men's movement that has surfaced, that   
has recognized that men are suffering today from a loss of masculine   
identity.

What's it about to be masculine?  It's not supposed to be about being   
strong and tough, that's old-school thick-headed jockspeak, right?  It's   
not about being successful in a career; now that women are right there   
alongside men in the workplace, it's no longer a "masculine" domain.  Is   
it about being the head of a household?  No, that's old school too, and   
really folks, how many of us grew up in a house where Dad was official   
family pants-wearer, but as a practical matter, mom ran the show?  I know   
I did.

The old roles have been thoroughly assaulted, denounced, condemned, but   
what has been offered as a new direction?

Modern men grew up with the idea that things were changing, and many grew   
up with a resolution not to be like all those brutish, oppressive men of   
the past (isn't that what we've learned our fathers were?).  But in   
trying to be different, to change, to listen to what women say they want,   
to try to chart a new course, we get laughed at as "sensitive new-age   
guys", mocked for retreating to the woods to beat on drums and try to   
re-evaluate what masculinity means, as some men's groups have done.  And   
sooner or later, a well-meaning guy gets _angry_, and lashes back at a   
society that sometimes seems to be saying that every way he turns, he is   
wrong, and offers little new guidance.

It's been a personal issue for me in the last couple of years that I've   
been trying to explore.  One thing is clear; one doesn't get very far   
asking others what one's identity ought to be.  At some point, you have   
to retreat from what the rest of the world has to say, and commune with   
one's self and other men to try to reshape masculinity, not in an   
obsequious way, but in a whole, strong, and healthy way.  I have a lot of   
respect for men who've formed men's groups to address these issues; I   
personally haven't joined one yet, but I'd like to look into it.  There's   
also some good literature on the topic that's appeared in the last   
decade, such as "Fire in the Belly" and "Iron John".

I'm also grateful for the many wonderful women I've met who've offered   
understanding and support instead of feeling that addressing men's issues   
somehow undermines women's issues.  I believe there is healing that needs   
to happen on both sides before we can come out a more whole society.

Thanks for taking the time to read this; it feels good to put these   
thoughts out there.  I'd be very interested to hear any and all thoughts   
back on this, publicly or privately.  I'd be especially curious to get   
some feedback from the men out there: can you relate to this?  Can anyone   
suggest other good books?

Hi everyone,

	I'm having a difficult time getting in touch with Housewares to 
buy tickets.  Will they even sell me tix overthe phone with my Visa?  I'd 
like to get them at the presale price...the road trip is going to costly 
as it is!  =)  So...any info would be greatly appreciated.

			Peace and Fresh Powder

Hey y'all!

After 3 weeks of haggling with the owners, we finally got a space for a
jungle party.

What's up with these bar owner's anyway?

The owner said they heard about jungle a while ago, but always wondered
why it never got played out more. Then they give us TONS of shit with
gettiing ONE night. I'm finding more and more that the venue owners in
this town are whacked. 

Oh well, guess we'll just have to buy a few warehouses, have one of us
run for mayor, and set this town straight!  ;)

oh yeah...

Wed. Nov 6th, Hunab Ku has teamed up with the B.A.S.S. crew to bring an
all ages event to a nice sketchy part of North Beach. Puurrfect for
Jungle!

We'll be going from 9p - 3a.
tix are 5 bux

no alcohol will be served, so we encourage everyone to buy some
softdrinks and help pacify the management.  ;)

lineup, in no particular order:

Jason Mouse (Emocean Records, Boston Mass.)
UFO
Flux
Thad
Tomas

We'll be having free mix tapes for the first 30 people, plus promotional
giveaways from Island and Quango records, celebrating Alex Reece's US
debut.

We'll also be celebrating the anticipated passing of Prop 215. So fire
up your blunts and come on down!

We might be able to get this into a weekly, but things are conditional
with the management. Again, they're whacked, so who knows?

For more info, call the BASS crew's number:

415-332-5800 ext. 247

Subject: 420 def. & story
Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

i first heard of 420 -- where else -- at Dead shows . . . here is the entry
in Skeleton Key, a Dictionary for Deadheads (by sometime raver Steve
Silberman of HotWired):

        Said to be police radio or civil statute code for a bowl of
marijuana "in progress."  Used as a justification to smoke pot at 4:20 in
the afternoon (or morning).  The term has become so widespread that hats
and bumperstickers have appeared in the parking lot reading, "It's 4:19 --
you're late!"


I've heard the story that 420 = the number of active ingredients in
cannabis, but this was just some urban myth ... i try to avoid the
california penal code or police lingo, but the 420 as the L.A./California
code seems to be the true origin.

At 4:20 a.m. at the Gateway 420 party, everyone else seemed to have
already, um, consumed their special party treat, but I had made sure that
my glass "object"  Rose's predecessor was well fed all evening, and my
distinctive cone-shaped party treat (thanks Ben) was still intact and much
enjoyed.

420 24-7

	Beautifully said, Andy.  As the Christmas carol says, it's been
said many times many ways, but it only becomes a cliche if we treat it

It didn't have a title --just your name (It waas a tape a friend of mine
had copied) It was a song that reminded me of this friend that I've sort
of lost along the way, but hope to see again in SF. But anyway I think it
might have been called "coma", I'm not sure. If your happen to come across

I have plenty of vocal house music.  I have offered to spin at this, but
we're all still voting on it.  If any body would like to see me spin you
can see me at Nimbus Salon in Los Gatos on Sunday the 20th.  There will be
an art show from 4 to 6 with belly dancing some where in that time frame
then I go on at 6 to 10pm with a nice 4hr set.  So come on down and see
what I'm all about if you'd like.

Have a good weekend what ever you all do!!! =)

You might also get into swinging those glowsticks on the end of a string 
(space permitting, of course).  I've seen many folks "grooving" in this 
manner and you don't have to really move the rest of your body much.  
plus it provides entertaining visuals for everyone.

(One glowstick memory to share) Remember at Burning Man how someone 
strung glowsticks up on some kites and took them up?  For those who 
weren't there, it was at night at the rave camp and I saw what looked 
like hovering fireflies in the sky - it was the most unusual spectacle.  
I was too far away to see the figures of the kites, all I saw was the 
faint glow.  That's when someone told me what it really was.  Ingenius!

Amy

Well, I'm in a good mood. Got 4 killer new records yesterday, 2 of which
are trance and 2 housey-trance type.  I'm getting of work early 10:00am,
going to the city to pick up a F-8 ticket and maybe a record or two, and
then chill out somewhere until the F-8 party starts.

I also have ordered parts to make a bar for my tongue with a flashing LED
on it. 4-8 weeks I'll be making some and they will all be water proofed. It
took along time to track down the right material that will allow me to do
it safely.

So if any of you are going to F-8, I'll be there. Probally going to wear my
black t-shirt with  Marvin the Martian on it.


What a great day Friday is,

Tim (knucklehead)

The weekend is finally here.

I'll be going to the F-8 party tonight.  Should be a nice small party.  Hope 
to see some of you there.

Not sure what my plans are for the rest of the weekend but maybe I'll run into
some of you.

It is really important to build up your muscles. If your therapists have 
given you exercises to do, DO THEM. It will give support to the whole 
structure.
It is also important to work on your movement gradually- it is hard to 
restrain impulsive strenuous dancing. Watch out that you don't favor 
anything too much because you will build subconscious dependencies on 
certain ways of moving that could throw the rest of your body out of 
whack even more than it is now, grinding up other joints.
So- emphasis on time and self-restraint and you'll get there in a very 
good way.

Here's something for all you to think about.

Your in the forrest and you come up to a cliff with a log crossing to the
other side. Your traveling with a fox, rabbit and a bag of lettuce. You
need to get all three across, but can only take one at a time. You can't
leave the rabbit with the lettuce because it will eat the lettuce and you
can't leave the fox with the rabbit because the fox will eat the rabbit.

How do you do it?

The weekend is here and my number is up! I hope! 
Last week's ride situation to Planetarium was a fiasco but I hope I make 
it to SF to-nite. Two months of party deprivation  and I am starved like 
you wouldn't believe.
Going to F-8
i'm wearing black pants and a shirt with flowers and such in those drab 
citrus colors from long ago. Got glasses and butterflies on my fingers
see you there

wa- HOO!

I had SOOO much fun with glowsticks at burning man!
We were throwing them up up up into the air and then running around trying
to catch them...of course this was a big desert so we had the space. ;)  We
had them on strings and would twirl them and then launch them like 40 ft
into the air.  woo hoo

Just thought i'd share. =P

"Let me have silence always in the centre of the shouting, that is
essential. Let me have silence so that no pin may drop and not be
heard, and not a whisper. Escape us for all our spouting, nor the
needle scratching upon this gramophone of the circular cosmic spot.
Hear me, mark me, learn me, throw the mind's ear open. Shut up the
mind's eye, all will be music. What sculpture of sound cannot, what
cannot as a fluid token words, that nothing else cannot."

At the IG/VW camp or at least in that area, they were taking about 5 or so
glosticks and putting the on a string with helium ballons. That was fun to
watch. The first time I saw them they were in the air and I thought a UFO
was coming.

Take the lettuce across walking backwards.  Hold the lettuce down so that 
the rabbit will follow it.  The Fox, in turn, will follow the rabbit.  Do 
it fast tho, cause the fox might catch on and just gobble up the rabbit!  :)

throw the lettuce across, let the rabbit go after it, and carry the fox before the rabbit can eat all the lettuce
?

Wheeeeeee, ever think about an SFRavers SnowDay?  Oooooo, Crossing the 
lines between Skiier and Snowboarder, I'm for it!  Anyone who loves the 
snow can shoot down through the trees with me!  Aaaaaaah, the absolutlely 
free feeling flowing though the fluff!  Ohh  S**t!  Then fly off a 20 
footer into more fluff!  Gotta love it!  

And the greatest thing is, I always have some groovy tune running thru my 
head as I board!  Way motivational.  The music, like the snowbarding, is 
a spiritual experience for me!  

So who thinks a day/weekend of us all meeting at a resort and 
boarding/skiing/grooving together sounds like a good idea?

(1) using advanced tantric methods and shiatsu massage, induce an extreme
    state of relaxation in the rabbit and fox.

   (note) head of lettuce is already sufficiently relaxed.

(3) walk across log, juggling the trance-induced rabbit and fox and the
    head of lettuce.  you will only need to touch one of the three at any 
    given moment, although you may feel a sense of psychic one-ness with 
    all three during the crossing.

   (note) you will feel especially as one with the lettuce.

(5) to revive rabbit and fox, serve odwalla and bagels with accompanying
    goa soundtrack.

   (note) head of lettuce does not consume odwalla or bagels, but may
          vibrate satisfyingly to goa sounds.  consider hugging lettuce
          while sticking head in speaker.

Oh Yeah!!

I got my snowboard 'n' stuff all ready to go by the door, complete 
with my trusty anti-roll walkman and big ass trendy lookin' 
headphones! More importantly, a place up at south shore for anyone 
who's ever interested in spontaneous trips up! 

There is *nothing* like phat ass hard house pounding your ears in mid 
360 off a giant hit into virgin powder!

praying for an early season,

	below is a story from the /chronicle/ that ran today.  officer
	haggett is the man that i and many of my friends witnessed
	betaing a friend of ours at a party raid.  her "crime" was
	that she was observing the officers beating other partygoers
	from a respectful distance and then taking photographs of
	the police officers actions.

	hagget has repetedly flaunted the law and violently violated
	citizens rights.  we waited two years for our turn at justice
	for his actions on new years 1994.  we thought we had some
	sembelance of justice recently, but the police power establishment
	has ruled against the citizens.  i urge you to take whatever action
	you think you can in this matter - letters to the police
	commisioner, board of supes, mayor willie brown and the media.
	how can we, as citizens, feel safe in san francisco if the systems
	that are here to protect us *and* the systems to watchdog
	them send us a clear message that we are not the priority,
	rather the systems themselves are.

	haggett's actions are patterned: violent outbursts against
	citizens and then completely lying in inquiry as to what caused
	his unwarranted actions.  i know this for *fact* because i
	observed one of these incidents first hand and his subsequent
	explanation of my friend "yelling and inciting the partygoers
	to riot" as a warrant for her beating, false imprisonment and
	mysterious disappearance of the film in her camera while
	in police impound.  i know what she was doing - standing and taking
	pictures, which is not illegal in the least.  in fact, it is
	within the law to observe police action without interfering.
	she was attacked for this, and it is reasonable for some of
	us who were there to assume that this attack was an effort to
	prevent those pictures from existing.

	there are plenty of good, valuable police officers out there
	who are doing their best to to serve and protect our citizens.
	those who are clearly out to commit violence and violate rights
	should be imprsoned, not employed at the taxpayers expense.

	most of us will not settle for anything less than his badge
	at this point.  please do what you can to help.  hopefully
	our leaders will be strong and advocate for us citizens, who,
	so far, have been ignored and taunted with false hopes,
	promises, and lies.  thank you for your time.

Cop's Suspension May Violate Rules

Susan Sward, Bill Wallace, Chronicle Staff Writers

     The San Francisco Police Commission's decision
     last week to allow Sergeant John Haggett to
     remain on the force after finding him guilty of four
     firing offenses appears to violate the department's
     own guidelines for disciplining officers convicted of
     misconduct.

     After finding the 38-year-old officer guilty of falsely
     arresting three people, using excessive force and
     filing a false report in connection with a 1995 New
     Year's Day police raid on an AIDS benefit, the
     five-member commission voted to suspend
     Haggett for six months.

     The commission and Police Chief Fred Lau said
     they decided not to fire Haggett because they
     did not want to impose the department's most
     severe penalty on him for an incident in which
     many other officers made mistakes.

     Lau did not return The Chronicle's call for
     comment, and John Keker, chairman of the
     commission, was out of town and could not be
     reached. Haggett's lawyer, James Lassart, also did
     not respond to a Chronicle request for comment.

     Department guidelines adopted by the
     commission in 1994 stress the need for
     ``progressive discipline.'' They call for an officer's
     disciplinary history to be used in evaluating an
     officer's current misconduct charge.

     Haggett has one of the most extensive misconduct
     records of any member of San Francisco's
     2,000-member force. In 14 years on the force, he
     has had two previous 90-day suspensions for
     excessive force, the maximum suspension at the
     time; has been named in six lawsuits with more than
     $70,000 in damages against the city so far; and he
     has been the target of dozens of complaints from
     citizens.

     Critics say the department's apparent failure to
     act according to its own guidelines shows it lacks
     the will to discipline rogue cops.

     ``An explanation is owed as to why the
     department's own disciplinary guidelines were
     abandoned in this case,'' said John Crew, an
     attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union
     who monitors the Police Department.

     Lawrence Sherman, chairman of the criminology
     department at the University of Maryland and an
     expert on police misconduct, said that while he
     does not know the details of Haggett's record, he
     has never encountered a case in which an officer
     with such a substantial prior disciplinary history was
     not dismissed from the department upon the next
     substantiated incident.

     ``I have looked at a lot of police departments,
     and I can't recall a case with that much prior
     discipline against an officer who was still on the
     force,'' Sherman said.

     Here are some of the major incidents in Haggett's
     career:

     -- James Tahsini was 19 years old when he
     encountered Haggett in May 1987. The officer
     approached him at midnight outside the Diamond
     Heights Safeway and asked to look in the duffel
     bag in which Tahsini was carrying two six-packs of
     beer. Tahsini says that when he told Haggett ``you
     have no reason to look in my bag,'' the officer
     ``grabbed me by my throat, slammed me against
     the hood of his car and started hitting me.''

     ``At first, I thought he was psychotic -- the way he
     slammed me against his car and hit me with his
     pistol and pointed it at my face,'' said Tahsini.
     Tahsini later testified that Haggett told him, ``I'm
     not in the mood for this s--.''

     The 150-pound Tahsini found himself lying on his
     back with his hands handcuffed underneath him. At
     that point, ``He (Haggett) stepped on my throat as
     if I was some sort of animal. It was just the way he
     was standing on me. You know when you see a
     movie where the hunter kills the wolf and steps on it
     to pose for the picture? It was sort of like that.''

     All charges against Tahsini, including resisting arrest
     and assaulting an officer, were subsequently
     dropped. Haggett earned a 90-day suspension in
     this case.

     At the end of the police commission hearing on
     the Tahsini case, then-Police Chief Frank Jordan
     called the allegations ``very serious'' and
     recommended that Haggett be suspended for 90
     days and fired if he engaged in another act of
     misconduct.

     Police Commission President Lou Giraudo was
     equally stern.

     ``Under no circumstances could I possibly sit here
     and believe that that which occurred in the
     parking lot . . . was reasonable behavior on your
     part,'' Giraudo said in imposing the suspension.
     ``We are saying 90 days because that's the
     maximum short of termination that this commission
     can do, to let you and your fellow officers know
     that we do consider it a most serious matter.''

     -- Later that year, Haggett appeared before the
     same commission and the same chief -- this time
     charged with smashing another teenager in the
     face with his walkie-talkie after the youth failed to
     sit down fast enough for him.

     According to police commission records, Haggett
     hit the teenager, Matthew O'Leary, at least twice
     with the heavy metal-and-plastic radio, breaking
     O'Leary's nose. During an investigation of the
     incident by the Office of Citizens Complaints,
     Haggett told investigator Araceli Matus that he
     did not know the department's general order
     governing the use of force on suspects. Haggett
     dismissed the departmental regulation as ``an
     opinion written by people that don't work in the
     street anymore.''

     In November 1988, the commission found Haggett
     guilty of using excessive force on O'Leary. But
     instead of firing him as Jordan had suggested four
     months earlier, the commission suspended
     Haggett for another 90 days.

     Police Commissioner Jose Medina, who was on the
     commission at the time Haggett received both
     suspensions, said the commission's hands were
     tied in those cases by the recommendation of the
     chief. The commission followed Jordan's
     recommendations by imposing the longest
     possible suspensions -- three months without pay.

     Medina said that even though Jordan had
     recommended that Haggett be fired for any
     further misconduct after the Tahsini case, Jordan
     did not ask that Haggett be terminated for
     beating O'Leary.

     ``He failed to follow his own recommendation,''
     Medina said of the former police chief. ``What he
     recommended was a suspension, and we
     imposed 90 days, the maximum that was allowable
     at the time.''

     Attempts to reach Jordan were unsuccessful.

     -- Court documents filed in connection with a
     police brutality lawsuit in 1989 showed that at that
     time Haggett had been named in 27 complaints
     ``which contain allegations that officer Haggett
     either falsely arrested a person or used excessive
     force in the course of the arrest.''

     The suit also indicated that Haggett had been
     named in 16 other complaints alleging conduct
     unbecoming an officer, neglect of duty or
     discourtesy toward citizens -- and 13 other
     complaints of various types of misconduct,
     including three that were still under investigation.

     -- In addition to the dozens of citizen complaints
     that have been filed against Haggett, he has also
     been named in six lawsuits that have cost city
     taxpayers more than $72,000 in jury awards and
     settlements.

     In a 1986 suit, Christopher Torres, an Ingleside
     District man, claimed he was dragged from his car
     and beaten by Haggett and other officers after he
     cruised through a stop sign on his way home. It
     later turned out that the officers had mistaken him
     for another man with a similar name who was
     wanted on a $160 warrant.

     During the incident, ``Haggett jumped me from
     behind and put a lock on my neck and grabbed
     my hair and threw me on the ground,'' Torres said
     during his testimony about the incident in Superior
     Court.

     ``I was screaming, telling my neighbors to stop
     him,'' Torres said. ``I yelled out that he was hurting
     me . . . (then) he choked me so tight I couldn't
     yell.''

     One of Torres' neighbors, Marie Louise Fernandez,
     confirmed Torres' story in her own sworn testimony.
     ``I remember thinking that he must have robbed a
     bank or murdered somebody because they
     (police) were not treating him as an ordinary
     citizen,'' Fernandez testified. ``He was being
     treated as a criminal.''

     Shortly after a Superior Court jury began hearing
     the testimony in Torres' case, the city settled his
     lawsuit for $35,000.

     -- FBI agents are conducting a federal civil rights
     investigation into Haggett's fatal shooting last year
     of parolee Edwin Sheehan, 40, who had a long
     string of convictions for drug abuse and one for
     armed robbery.

     Haggett shot Sheehan after the parolee drove
     into several vehicles in the Tenderloin while
     attempting to flee from police. Haggett said he
     thought Sheehan had a gun and made furtive
     movements. Investigators at the scene searched
     Sheehan's body and found he had been
     unarmed.

     Kenneth Quigley, an attorney for Sheehan's family,
     said at the time: ``All he did was run. He didn't fight
     them, and he didn't shoot them. All he did was try
     to get away.''

     As for Tahsini, putting his 1987 encounter with
     Haggett behind him has been a difficult ordeal, in
     part because lawyers keep seeking him out to
     testify in cases they have pending against the
     officer.

     ``I know a lot of cops who are good cops,'' said
     Tahsini, who collected a $35,000 jury award for his
     encounter with Haggett.

     ``There are a few bad apples who make it worse
     for everyone else (and put) a bad rap on the
     whole department,'' Tahsini said.

     ``With Haggett's record, once, twice, three times
     maybe you let it go. But when it's continuous, it's
     getting out of hand. Obviously something is
     wrong.''

Ok, so who's going to organize a mini-rave up at Tahoe? Does anyone own a 
cabin?  My legs are telling me: don't even THINK about skiing all day and then 
dancing all night. But it can be done, oh yes, it can be done. 

Just imagine: skiing (or boarding or sledding or snowmanning/womanning) all 
day, in fresh powder, a little herbal relaxation afterward (420 thread) in hot 
tub, then groovy tunes in evening, perhaps with a bit of gambling thrown in to 
pay for the trip.  

Ok, so who's the organizer type?

Too bad the 3 strikes law doesn't apply to bad cops. He'd been in jail

It's too bad there cops like that out here. They give the good cops a bad rap.

Dear all,

This message is extremely important.  This is no JOKE!  Really its
not.  It's completely true and you'd better read it and beleive it or
suffer the consequences. Honest, I wouldn't joke about something this
serious.  It is about a very highly intelligent virus that is being
spread worldwide called "Gabba Times".

Once you have read this message, please forward to fellow musos you
care about.  Thanks.

SUBJECT: [Very Important  !!! ]

There is a music virus that is being sent across the Internet. If you
receive an email message with the subject line "The Gabba Virus", DO
NOT read the message, DELETE it immediately, do not RESEND it and
immidiately backup your MIDI files, CD's (both Audio & ROM) and take
casts of all your precious vinyl.

Please read the messages below.  Some miscreant is sending email under
the title "The Gabba Virus" worldwide, if you get anything like this,
DON'T DOWN LOAD THE FILE! It has a virus that rewrites your hard
drive, obliterating all SMF, MID, RA, WAV, in fact *any* audio related
file, replacing them with a Gabba Mix version.

Not only that but if you store your CD's within the same room as your
harddrive the virus will emit a special magnetic field, which will
compress the data on your Audio CD's causing them to play back at
anything up to twice the normal bpm. Worse still, if your CD's have
not been mastered using a special 'Anti-Quantize Tampering' technique,
recently developed in the US to guard against such viruses, you will
find that the CD plays back to a viciousley quantised banging gabba
rhythm. Even jungle!! Or Enya!!  Remember, CD's contain only 1's and
0's. By altering the spacings between these it is quite a simple task
for the virus to alter the rhythm of a track.

Even vinyl is not safe. By downloading "The Gabba Virus" an electrical
pulse transmitted through the household mains will manifest itself in
the stylus of record deck causing irreversable damage to your
favourite platters, next time you put one on.

Unfortunately, most novice computer users will not realize what is
happening until it is far too late. Luckily, there is one sure means
of detecting what is now also known as the "Gabba Times" virus. It
always travels to new computers the same way in a text email message
with the subject line reading "The Gabba Virus". Avoiding infection is
easy once the file has been received simply by NOT READING IT! The act
of loading the file into the mail server's ASCII buffer causes the
"Gabba Times" mainline program to initialize and execute.

The program is highly intelligent- it will send copies of itself to
everyone whose email address is contained in a receive-mail file. It
can search all your HTML files for any reference to music or links to
music sites and transmit itself too all email addresses listed within
these files.  It will then proceed to trash all music of the unlucky
recipient.

The bottom line is: - if you receive a file with the subject line "The
Gabba Virus", delete it immediately! Do not read it!  Rest assured
that whoevers' name was on the "From" line was surely struck by the
virus and will die a horrible amphetamine/poppers overdose death.

Warn your friends and local sound system users of this newest threat
to the Music World! It could save them a lot of pain and anguish.
Could you pass this along to your global music mailing lists as well?

Oh, also if you receive a file called GABBAZIP300 be equally aware.
This is merely a ZIP file version of the virus, cleverlry and cunninly
renamed.

Please be careful and forward this mail to any muso you care about.

REPEAT: DO NOT DOWNLOAD ANY FILE NAMED GABBAZIP300 REGARDLESS OF THE
EXTENSION AND DO NOT READ ANY MAIL WITH THE SUBJECT "The Gabba Virus"

Oh and PS. Gabba fans - Beware the Ambient virus!! It's just like the
Gabba one but it will convert everything into an Orb stylee remix.

First...What the hell are you doing in the forrest with a fox, rabbit, and
a bag a lettuce in the first place.

I think, How did you get the fox, rabbit and the lettuce there in the first
place and who says they want to get to the other side.


Anyway, for those who said.

take the rabbit over, then get the lettuce, bring the rabbit over when you
go back and drop it off and take the fox over. go back over and get the
rabbit.

you got it right. But I still say, what the heck is the fox and rabbit
doing together in the first place and how did they all get there.

Locate the fox, rabbit, and the lettice.  Bring in a generator, set up the 
sound system, put on some killer tunes and let the thumpin' base bring there 
little nature boogie'n behinds across the road!

I know it doesn't make any sense, but it sounds great.

Tom, you win for the Lamest post award, but it made me laugh. Only if I
knew how to get there from here and get to F-8 for tickets. I'm here in the
city every weekend and still do not know how to get anywhere. Now I know
why we played follow the leader in school.

I was just thinking of all the things we probally have a password for
remembered that something I have a password for and the password is (was,
changing it now that I'm telling everyone) but the password was Dipshit.

What the hell was I thinking when I came up with this. No clue.

Anyway, that's enough from me today. I'm in a good mood for some reason and
just wanted to talk. Alex (Soto) and Pao if your there, I accidently
deleted the email with your phone numbers on it. It getting kinda light now
to hook up so I'll  see you at F-8 tonight.

RAW is on 9th Avenue between Lincoln and Irving in the Inner Sunset area 
of SF.  The most awesome food you will ever taste, though a bit pricey.  
Everything is RAW (not cooked).  YUUUMMM!

My fellow sfravers, you may want to check out the following DJ sets coming to
a party near you. Aside from Robert Miles, I've heard them all and in my
opinion, they're consistent.

Josh Wink (Philadelphia)
DJ Sneak (Chicago)
Phil Smart (Perth, Australia)
John Debo (Florida)
Voo Doo (New Orleans)
Robert Miles (UK, he better be good at $4000 a set!) 
Evil Eddie Richards (Dynamix, UK)
Mark E. Quark (soon to be S.F. resident)
Mr. C (Shamen)
Danny Hybrid & Mike E. Bloc (E-lustrious, Direkt, UK)

1) Go to supermarket.
2) Rummage through the raw veggies.

I mean really, why would raw food be 'pricey'???? ;-)

you've obviously never eaten there. just because it's raw doesn't mean it
isn't prepared.  the food is awesome, and it's worth every penny. i've 
taken many vegetarians and non-vegetarians there, not one hasn't left
stoked.  not to mention that it's raver owned and operated, and that
they have live music/djing.  definitely  one of the best restauraunts in the 
city, and a perfect place to relax and get some eats before going out...

I love it when a spur of the moment decision comes together & turns out to
be really fun.  I was kinda planning on taking it easy this weekend,
but... well, at 10:30 I suddenly got excited about the prospect of
*dancing*, so I trundled up to F8 & got me a ticket and ride up there with
some friendly folks.

I have no regrets, though I'm gonna be sore as hell tomorrow.  Only rarely
do we get to hear four flawless sets as I did last night.  I got there in
time for the last half-hour or so of Ethan's set.  Gorgeous.  Then DRC was
up - she never lets up!  Hard, hard, hard!  It was exactly what I was in
the mood for.  Mars, with his tuneful, melodic but very hard set, and
finally Mystr-E with a fantastic set.  The music was hard all night long,
which is normally a bit much for me... but it was just right last night.

The lighting & decorations were very minimal, which was not so great. 
I've always preferred a bit of actual light, so I could see what was going
on - and lots of pretty things to stare at.  But somehow, the giant
glowing pyramids & tons of blacklights were enough.  Barely.  That's
pretty much my only complaint, though. 

It's always a relief and a joy to rediscover the beauty of raving after a
bad rave experience (as I had last weekend.)  I did.  Hugs were plentiful,
smiles were even moreso, beautiful people were everywhere I looked... and
the music (clearly the number 1 priority of the night) was phenomenal.  I
spent quite a lot of time on the dance floor, particularily during DRCs
and Mystr-Es sets.  Yummy! 

There were a couple of really pleasant surprises for me, people-wise.
Ariel showed up, despite her intentions of going to a larger party and
*avoiding trance*.  Looked like you had a good time anyway, Ariel!
*smile*... and Shamini, it was really great to see on the dance floor,
finally!  Yippee!  There were of course many wonderful, friendly people
there (both familiar & unfamiliar) - too many to list, I'm afraid.  I do
have to thank Jay for giving me a lift home though!

So, that was my Friday.  How were you alls'?  What's up tonight for you
folks?  I'll be seeing some of you, I am sure.

'Till next time.... take care & have fun!  (quack quack!)

I have one of IVO's tapes, Millipede, and it's been in my deck for the last
month straight almost.  He's really good.  The number on the tape is:
(510)934 9397  (it says booking and info).

anyone going to XNTRK tonight?  I thought I might go done there, the DJ

Anyway, I'm a 6-4 185# white dude, withshoulder length hair and I'm 28.
Maybe I'll see some of you there.

Nomad has been pretty consistent in throwing smaller parties. I had a great
time at Origin. DJ Bone from Detroit was great. Dan is well-known for
breaking out his best sets at smaller parties like this one tonight. I'm
looking forward to it. Last I heard, Get Down will not have the DJ's they
promised. Can anyone verify this? :)

Anything else, I have the normal stuff from the calendar. XNTRK sounds
interesting, but djdan usually has a following of goupees. And then next
would be get down get down get down. . . which would probably end up pretty
big, (and I'm not gonna pay $20 just to go).

Is that the same Robert Miles who had the hit single 'Children' ?

While Im on the subject I would like to see more music reviewed on here.
I love to shop for CDs but I never know what to buy. I usually end up
picking up stuff if I can listen to it and that doesnt happen very often
:(

Just a thought ...

The fact that you know so much about my headphones I find very
interesting.  Do I know you?  If so well and good.
  But if I don't then
how come you know so much about them.  Where you the person that knicked
my gear?  If so all I want back is the headphones and the two HIA albums
and you can keep the rest.  Sounds fair?  You can leave them for me aat
Ameba if you like.  But I am probably much mistaken (at least I hope so!).

A friend of mine is trying to decide where to go tonight. What do
you recommend, Psychedelicatessen or XNTRK? He cares more about the
vibe than the music. All suggestions are welcome! =)

reespect, jonas

	Hey,

		So who all is going to to XNTRK?  Does anyone have any
	inside info. yet?  All I know is that you get tickets @ Housewares
	B-4 11:30P for $15, but where is the party.  On the message it says
	that there will be 2 rooms...Home Base? or Pier 17?  What else has
	2 rooms?  Anyhow, let me know what you know....
			
	I'M GONNA SEE/HEAR DAN TONIGHT!!!		    MHg

just came from Housewares on Haight and I can't believe how much good-sounding
shit is coming up in the next month or so.  Of course, I'm just now getting 
pretty busy at school, and my funds are a little low.  I definitly want to 
catch Goa Gil on the 25th before he leaves, I hear he's a kind dj.

Brand: Stanton Vestax
Model: Top Loading Dual Varispeed CD Player
Condition: Mint
Price: $350
Features: *joystick* cueing and pitch bend, +/- 8% pitch control with super long faders
Size: fits in 8x19" rack spaces.
Shipping: I will deliver to any SF bay area address

This is a first generation DJ CD player which I bought a few years ago
before I moved to Brazil. It never made it to Brazil and sat in a storage
space here in a rack unused until I came back a few months ago.

It handles two CDs with full transport/pitchbend/cueing on each side.
It sits *flat* and is about the size of a large dj mixer. It has 19"
rack-ears.

The technology is clearly first generation. It works but is not as accurate
at keeping a constant pitch as the newer DJ CD players. It has really cool
clear plastic space-bubble top loading CD transports and is much nicer
to control than those teeny weeny rackmount jobs of the modern era.

It does NOT have looping or cue memory features.

This is a fine unit for DJs who need to play CDs with beatmatching/varispeed
but not quite good enough for super accurate professional use.

This unit works as perfectly as it did when purchased since it was almost
never used. However, this is an "as-is" sale. Once you buy it, its yours.
No returns. No complaints. If you have cash in hand you can come over and
try it out if you want.

Hi,

 I hope everyone can excuse my lack of cheerfulness here. The death of a 
location is never very inspiring.

 Dionysus Dreams was hired by the folks at Get Down to provide lighting. 
I was very excited at first as I have always heard good things about 
their parties. Came to find out that the folks using the name were not 
the original creators of Get Down. 

 At the VERY last minute it was decided that Get Down would be at Acme 
along with Psychedelicatesen (and Goa Gil!!). I was all stoked on being 
at what would essientially be a micro-massive.

 I get to Acme at 7pm and start setting up. The Acme event 
(Psychedelicatesen) was the most unorganised event I have ever worked on. 
At 10:00pm the stage on the main floor was still being disassembled, JK 
Sound had not arrived yet, the upstairs and the basement were still 
completely unready as was the dance floor for Get Down.

 Eventually word gets out that the police are outside. Eventually the 
police come inside (all doors were open to the building) demanding to know 
who is in charge. The cops hang out for a good 45 minutes and then the 
Fire Marshall shows up. In the meantime the individual who rents out Acme 
is taken away to jail for not identifying himself to an officer (refused 
to give his birthdate). The Fire Marshall walks through the building 
yelling out that the building is unsafe for human occupation and that 
everyone must leave. Then an officer walks through a minute later saying 
those with equipment can stay to pack up their equipment. 

 It is interesting to note that the promoter for Get Down shows up right 
after the Fire Marshall shuts us down (about 5 to 6 hours late!!!). 
However, despite the implication, I believe the fact that Acme tried to 
do this as an open art showing and had LOTS of people milling about and 
was obviously open for buisness is what drew police attention.

 I had heard that the lease for the current occupant at Acme was up in a 
day or two. This was probably meant to be the last party there anyway.

 Psychedelicatesen was okay (as an art show, I was at the opening the 
night before) but there was a lot promised on the flyer that didn't 
happen and would not have happened even if the next nights party had gone 
off. Also I had heard that the individual taken to jail by the police had 
done this double booking before (one party rents the building, can't fill 
all the floors and then another party gets rented the available space 
despite the wishes of the first promoter) which is kinda tacky I think.

 What did I learn? Trust my intuition (it had been screaming at me not to 
work with Get Down), the SF police department doesn't always mind being 
videotaped (someone got some GREAT footage that night!), to listen to the 
advice of my more experienced friends, Never EVER to work with Get Down 
again.


peace ya all,


Ran @ Dionysus Dreams

No more Acme?

  Sounds like you had a terrible night..   I will miss the E Ticket events
held at Acme.

  But I will never forget Oak50. This was the biggest loss in the city this
year.
  Rumor has it they closed down Oak50 to ravErs becouse of GHB Overdoses. 
Seeing how many (OD's) there were at 2nd Chakra. It wouldn't surprize me.

Hi, I would like to introduce myself, my names is Lisa, and I 
just relocated to Boston.  I spent this evening
at a gay bookstore for a book signing, and I noticed a severe lack of
literature for the bisexual  community.  Now the first thing that pops
into my mind is what would I want to read?  And the second question that
pops to mind is what would I write?  Now I have not completely answered my
own questions, but a spark of inspiration did happen.  I am quite sure
that I could not fill an entire book of ramblings of bisexual experience  
and I am sure that I would not want to read it, but, there
are many of you out there that have some things that you might be
interested in sharing.  Such as guidelines, experiences, questions, and
random tid bits.  I have decided to start an adventure of writing a book,
or more to the point compiling a book.  I may not get enough entries to
complete a book but I think this could be a lot of  fun trying.  What I am
asking of all of you is to send me information stories guidelines, hints
tips, questions, thoughts, and random tid bits. anything that you would
like to share with the known bisexuals, curious, and general populous.
Submissions can be anonymous, but I would like to know where you are
writing from.  Just so that someone reading this book does not think that
this is the Boston view on Bisexuality.  Please remeber that  this could
in fact be published, this entirely depends upon how many submissions I
receive, and if there is a company out there willing to print it.
Submissions can be one sentence or go on for as long as you feel
necessary.  If I end up with 100 coming out stories, I will edit  and
make a request submissions on other topics to even things out.  

I am also interested in what people would entitle the book.
The first thing that pops into my mind is "End the confusion: Bisexual
people speak out".  

Please pass this message on to your friends,
acquaintances, relatives, or anyone that you feel is interested in saying
something on their view of  bisexuality.  
I am currently in the process of moving, so I do not have a reliable snail
mail address,  but a PO Box is in the making, but for now, please respond
by e-mail, for this account will remain active.  

As I had stated before that submissions will remain anonymous, but I am
not sure of the laws regarding printed material,  I will be checking in to
that next week, so a way of contacting you may be necessary, if your
submission is to be printed.  Thanks for taking the time to read this
message and for passing it along to all interested parties.

Thanks again talk to you soon

Lisa

That's bad to hear.  The Get Down Get Down Get Down Get Wicked party
at the Sonoma County Fairgrounds on Memorial Day weekend in 1993 was
one of the highlights of my entire life.  No lie.  It's a shame to
see other people rip on that memory for financial gain.

As for the Acme, I haven't set foot in the place since F&F was shut
down there in March 1995.  I know there have been some good events
there since then, but I still gotta say: good riddance.  Maybe someday
we'll find out what the real story was there.

Hi all,

Who was the promoter for the Acme event?  Was it Marc Healey?  ( I ask
because the posting about the event came from him, via MoonPup's
account...)

[ to sfraves list ]

 My widfe Mary and I drove up to San Francisco today (Sunday) in large part 
to check out the Psychedelicatesen art show. When we got there, it was locked
up, and there was a sign in the window "Closed By The Police". Sheesh!

 As we were driving away, I speculated that maybe it was the exhibition of
blotter acid art that got them busted - I guess not.

 Does anyone who was there notice if they actually had any of Alex Grey's
or Paul Mavrides' art up on the walls? It seems to me that would have been 
too packed to entrust originals to errant elbows or hands.

OK it's bad enough that ACME was shut down Sat. night. What's even worse, is
that the promoters of Get Down knew that Terry Mullin, Steve Loria, and Mark
Farina would not be able to play at their party BEFORE the teasor flyer was
even released. This word comes straight from the very DJ's who will soon be
dealing with these cheeky promoters. Feel ripped off now? I suggest that no
one buy presale tickets UNLESS....1. It is being sold by an establishment
(i.e. Wicked, Housewares, BPM, etc.) or the event is being thrown by an
established promoter with a good reputation. Major props to Dionysus Dreams
for his efforts at ACME!

:)...with a positive attitude!

		    SCIENTISTS DISCOVER NEW ELEMENT!

  The heaviest element known to science was recently discovered by
  university physicists.  The element, tentatively named
  "Administratium", had no protons or electrons and thus has an atomic
  number of 0.  However, it does have one neutron, 15 assistant
  neutrons, 70 vice neutrons, and 161 assistant vice neutrons.  This
  gives it an atomic mass of 247.  These 247 particles are held together
  in the nucleus by a force that involves the continuous exchange of
  meson-like particles called morons.

  Since it has no electrons, Administratium is inert.  However, it can
  be detected chemically as it impedes every reaction it comes in
  contact with.  According to the discoverers, a minute amount of
  Administratium added to one reaction caused it to take over four days
  to complete.  Without the Administratium, the reaction occurred in
  less than one second.

  Administratium has a normal half-life of approximately three years, at
  which time it does not actually decay but instead undergoes a
  reorganization in which assistant neutrons, vice neutrons and
  assistant vice neutrons exchange places.  Studies seem to show the
  atomic number actually increasing after each reorganization.

  Research indicates that Administratium occurs naturally in the
  atmosphere.  It tends to concentrate in certain locations such as
  government agencies, large corporations and universities.  It can
  usually be found in the newest, best-appointed and best-maintained
  buildings.

  Scientists warn that Administratium is known to be toxic, and
  recommend plenty of fluids and bed rest after even low levels of
  exposure.

According to the people who put on xntx the  main player was a guy
called Migel (probabbly wrong spelling).  They said that he had done this
sought of thing before: recieved booking money and pre-sale tickets, sold
the tickets, pocket the money and not shown up to do his room.  In short,
he ripped us (S.P.A.Z.) off the old fashioned way: he signed a contract
and then ran out on it profiting from the tickets and his hiring fee in
the process.  I personally know the people at ACME and can say that, apart
from stoner style organization, no wrong doing was done on their part.
In short, we were ripped by Miguel who, IN NO WAY WHAT-SO-EVER,
represented Get Down or anyother sound system or promoter.  He lied to us,
ripped us off and was the one who probably called the police on us and
then told them that he was calling from xcntrx! (an abvious complete lie
on his
part!).  If anyone knows this person tell him he is a wanted man by both
us and xcntx possie and that if he ever shows his face at one of my
parties he will be punished accordingly.  This guy is a complete scum-bag
and I heartily reccomend that no-one has anything to do with this
individual in the near future; in short, he's dodgy as fuck.
Tristan.
PS.  Despite the fact that I thought that Stacy and her boyfriend were
really nice good people, and the fact that DJ Dan played (i missed him
owing to the fact that I did not get there until 4.20) XCNTRX really
sucked as a party.  I don't think I have ever seen so many generic looking
people at an SF party ever.  Very dissapointing!

earlier if they can!  (my house is always open!)

Ok, Ok, Ok...for those who saw me at F-8 on Saturday, yes I bit the bullet
and swallowed another night of trance.  *sigh*  Despite ALL my bitching I
had a great time (who knew those Marin kids could party so hard?) and
don't have any regrets.  ALTHOUGH: mark my words!  If Common Ground
had been less than a 2 hour drive away (who's idea was it to throw that
amazing party in Sac?) I would have been there in a second.

But, despite all my reservations, I went to F-8 and it *was* in fact
wonderful.  Mars was REALLY amazing...even though I'd been to parties
that he'd spun at before, I don't think I'd ever actually been AWARE that it
was him spinning and damn!  He really rips that shit up!  And he appears
to be damn into what he's doing, which gets me all the more riled up.  (I
swear, if I have to look up from dancing and see a dj doing the "this is my
job" half-assed head-bob over the turntables ONE MORE TIME I'm going to
go up to the tables and kick some ASS!  HONESTLY!  ;)

The space was really nice too...as exciting as a multi room party is, it's
really nice to have the dancing energy centered in one big room.  I
appreciated that a lot.  Chill rooms were nicely decorated.  Bathrooms
were quite nice (always an important part of the whole party
experience).  My biggest disappointment:  The lights turning on at..what
time was it?  5:30?  WAY WAY too early.  I mean, I KNOW there was
only 4 djs playing but it was so weird to get home and have it still be dark
out...did the promoters want to insure that we were all asleep by 7am or
something?

Anyway, all 'n' all a good time (even if it was trance...hee hee hee).  Hey
to all the folks I saw there...Steve, David, Dhiren, Libby, others who I for
some reason cannot remember their names...

Ariel

ps: for anyone who's interested, I didn't make it to Get Down Get Down
Get Down either...I heard they lost their space or something.  But the little
housE partE I went to in Berkeley was THA BOMB!  It was SO much fun
and, not that this is a forum for discussing drugs, but can I just say that
was the BEST e I have had since I moved down here?!  DAMN!  That,
combined with the fact that the music was progressive house (meaning
slower than trance) meant that I was dancing for over 5 hours
non-stop...slower music means I can get that "marathon runner" rhythm
going which I can't maintain to trance.  Ok, ok, ok: enough bitching about
trance.  :)  --Ariel

 Hallelujah!

Yes, the death of a location is usually a sad thing, but in this case, 
I'm celebrating. ACME was a death-trap, and should have been shut down 
years ago. It's also been a crutch for promoters who don't want to bother 
trying to find anyplace else, and have NO concern for the safety of their 
paying customers. Not to mention it always required a map point (which 
never seemed to be on-the-way to a MUNI rider like myself).

Sorry, folks got burned in the aftermath, but the risk of using ACME 
was obvious. (1) downtown, (2) constant use, (3) overcrowded, (4) totally 
unsafe. It was only a matter of time before it got shut down. I'm just 
glad it got busted before someone died there, because one of the two was 
bound to happen sooner or later.

good riddance ACME.
jmar!

WOW!  Cool party even if it ended a little early for me.  I had to sit in my
car for a little bit and relax before I drove home.  I still had a lot of
energy built up and wish I could have kept dancing for another hour or so at
least.

All the DJs had great sets but for some reason DRC sticks out in my mind.  
Maybe because there was that short pause in the music before she started.  She
has some killer records.  Definately a collection I wouldn't mind owning. 

Glad I got to see some familiar faces and glad I met quite a few new ones. It
was only Libby and I one the way up, but my car was full on the way home.
Pretty cool.  And your welcome David.  Anytime.

Subject: another great weekend (F-8 and more!)
Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com

It no longer makes sense to do "party reviews". For me, the weekend is
just one long event, broken up by periods of sleeping (or not!) and
transitions from place to place. And before I go any further, I just
wanted to say that I have the *best* weekends!

The weekend started off with a trip to Raw (one of my favorite grazing
places) to hear Tom spin some Goa. I met up with some other friends
quite randomly (apparently they had gone for the same reason) and
enjoyed a healthy dinner to some great music. Too bad the food there
is so damned expensive; I would be there every night otherwise.

I had been wanting to go to a Frequency-8 party for some time, and I'm
really happy that this one happened. The space (a recording studio in
San Rafel) was very cool. The first thing that I noticed was that it
was completely sound-proofed! 

I personally enjoyed the decorations and the lighting. It was, true,
minimal; however, there was enough light to see everything, and there
were just enough black-lights to make everything glow. Really, though,
the F-8 party wasn't about the visuals, it was about the *music*.
(The red light in the chill/smoking room was a bit too agro for my
taste. A nice blue light might have been better... details, details :)

Although I only caught the tail end of Ethan's set, it set the stage
very nicely for the Frequency-8 sound. DRC spun some excellent music
during her set (despite the fact that it began with her wrestling with
an unruly DAT player); really hard dance music, at times with a german
industrial flavor. Mars spun the best set that I had ever heard from
him (w0w!), and Mystr-E pumped up the crowd and then brought them back
down at the end with a phenomenal choice of music.

Mars and Mystr-E seemed to be the most comfortable I had ever heard
them spin, quite possibly because it was *their* party. As a result, I
spent somewhat little time socializing... the music was just too good
all night. Even though it ended early (5:30), I had no regrets. Any
longer, and it would have dragged out a good thing. Okay, I was a bit
miffed that I didn't get to see the sunrise as I drove back over the
Golden Gate bridge... :) but oh well!

Saturday was spent at a house party in Berkeley, hosted by Brian and
Susan... hey, thank you *so* much for the party on Saturday!!!
I had a woooooonderful time :) :) :)

Tom spun some more Goa (Tom needs to spin out more; he's probably SF's
best kept secret... can't wait for 2012!), followed by Jon Logan
spinning ambient for the rest of the night. Jon spun an incredible
assortment of tracks; ambient, IDM, trip-hop. But, Jon, where was the
BK crown? ;)

I *almost* went to the Pacific boat party, but bailed out at the very
last minute (like, at the docks). Which was fine. Instead, I went home
(imagine that!) and went to bed at 11. Besides, it would have been
hard to top the incredible night that I had at Brian's party, so I
enjoyed staying at home, relaxing and reflecting...

well rested,
Steve

 One of the dissapointments of the art show was that there was only one 
signed piece by Alex Gray. There was another piece next to the other that 
was unsigned but did not seem to be an Alex Gray piece. The signed piece 
seemed to be a very early work and unfinished. It was certainly not in 
the style that Alex Gray is currently known for.

having only been there once, and also sensing the fear in peoples post
after every party that was held there over the past year or so...(how many
times have we seen this sentiment on sfraves?-->"if there was a fire or
other emergency I would fear for the lives of my friends and myself" I can
only say that it seems like a good thing...I know it sucks to lose a place
for our parties, but obviously we need to use safe spots to avoid ruining
our scene...food for thought, what would happen to the scene if there were
a major tragedy? is the media on our side? 
	
     On a brighter note...happy monday!!!!!!smile everyone!! ;-0 ;-() ;-)

God knows how promoters have so many available locations, and they use ACME
becuase it just has so many fond memories. I think your statemant was a
little narrow minded. I really dont think people used the ACME cause they are
to lazy to find a better location, but because there are no other
locations(or they have yet to be found)!

     Overall had a really good time that somewhat expanded my idea of what 
     a good party could be.  Different is good.  Too bad the music wasn't 
     more varied (I'm pretty sure DRC would have taken care of that aspect 
     actually - I really like her style).
     
     It wasn't the DJ's, or the people, or the herbs and spices, or the

     David Lowe's monkey made the party for me.
     
     Some might ask "Andy, you seem like your life is somewhat full (an

     And to you I say... "You don't know this monkey".
     
     It's funny that almost every rave I go to, I get there, and I'm not 
     quite there.  I spend some time kicking back, or dancing until IT 
     comes over me.  Usually something is affiliated with IT.  Sometimes 
     it's a song, or a smile, or something I ate.  I can understand that.  
     I'm just worried that I'm getting off on toy monkeys now.

I just had to post a review of Sunset's last boat party of the year.  I 
really contemplated not going, because the last two I have been to seemed 
to lack the usual boat party energy.  Not so last night.  

The one bummer about it was that we started out kind of late.  We were at 
the dock for one of the most beautiful sunsets; had we left on time, we 
would have had a pretty full view of it.  Not that the party didn't start 
while we were waiting to leave.  It was going off way before we left 
port.  Solar was spinning a high energy, funky ass set almost immediately.  

The group of people and the energy on the boat was amazing.  It sold out 
(as opposed to the last 2 that didn't) and was a perfect size crowd.  
Everyone was smiling and chatting and grooving.  I didn't run into one 
attitude the whole time.  

Mark Farina had people wooping it up with smiles all around.  He played 
his usual technically awesome, soulful, phunky house set.  I love hearing 
Mark spin because he not only helps you get a groove on, but he brings so 
much positivity to his music.  He must be a really happy, cool person. 

I am sorry that I didn't get to meet any new sfravers, but I saw some I 
already knew and met some really cool non-sfravers (hey maybe they were and 
it just didn't come up).  

Looking forward to next weekend's last Sunset of the year at a new location:)

Cheers***
Cami

I agree. Even though I haven't as of yet been involved with securing a
place for a party, I have realized that a statement such as: "Just find
a better spot." is easier said than done.

If you are interested in promoting an event, or are asociated with any 
upcoming events and you need help getting a location, then give me a 
call.  There is a lot more to promoting than throwing parties at the 
ACME.  If you have the drive and the ambition to produce a great party 
and need a place to do it, contact me soon.

Although I agree Bman is dangerous (i spent a rather sleepless night 
friday as cars whizzed within 25 feet of my tent), i think it's a 
different story. Burning Man *is* about survival. The desert's a rough 
place. That's made clear up front. Safety is a personal responsibility.

Of course that doesn't take into account the cars. That was a problem not 
created by the promoters or the location, but by the attendees. I was 
dissapointed to discover that most of the offending vehicles were driven 
by people from the rave crowd instead of the regular bman crowd. The tent 
accident was a tragedy, but we (the attendees as a whole) can only blame 
ourselves for it. The lack of respect and responsibility that caused the 
dangerous driving is something only we (again, the attendees) can remedy, 
not the promoters. Hopefully, Omar will not have to pay the price for all 
of us.

As unfortunate as it was, the motorcycle death Tuesday night was just 
naked stupidity. Drunk + motorcycle + no lights = death. period. He made 
a choice, and sadly, took the consequences. It was an empty and selfish 
act that could very well be the final blow to the event he and the other 
artists tried to create.

Though I have no direct source anymore, I have heard of changes the 
promoters are considering (as opposed to ACME) to minimize the effects of 
our stupidity, including: some sort of shuttle between the camps, more 
clearly defined roads, pre-sale tickets only, &c. This is of course 
assuming there *will* be another.

At ACME, I have seen *no* effort to remedy a dangerous situation, caused, 
not by the attendees, but by the space itself and the constant 
overselling of tickets. If the ex-tenants of ACME or any promoters who've 
used the space are here, I'd like to know something.

Just what was your plan in case there was an emergency? 
Did you even have one?

Hell, even Kommotion made some changes to make their space safer.

  Andy... I'm afraid so ;)
  Okay, just kidding.  I'm pretty fond of that monkey myself.  But I would
be lying if I said it was mine.  Jay Wiley brought it, but I'm not sure if
it was his or Libbys.  I *do* have a small gingham bunny named Bert, as
well as a a ratty ol' panda bear named Ralph, though... 
  Anyway, that Monkey makes my night every time I see!  It rules!  But I
think the best toy there was that plastic thing that bounced up and down
on the dance floor.... that thing was cool! 
  See ya next time!

            ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Interestingly, though you disagree with me, your last seven words made my 
point exactly. I do not accept that there aren't other spaces. There are. 
It's just that the mindset and lack of responsibility that is evident in 
throwing parties at ACME is keeping us out of them. Owners of property 
are ultimately responsible for accidents and complaints. Why would 
they put themselves at (a very real) risk of fines and lawsuits and 
property damage just to make a few dollars. Answer: they won't. 

Yes there is more to promoting than just finding a space. It's called 
taking responsibility and promoting (here's that word again...) 
sustainability. And yes, as has been seen, those are easier said than 
done as well.

This isn't an attack on anyone in particular. Just an observation. 
Parties used to be all over the place. Seemed like everyone was 
advertising "virgin warehouse space, blah, blah." Then about three years 
ago, most parties began to consolidate into a few spots, used repeatedly. 
Now these places are closed off to us, largely due (in my opinion) to 
irresponsible over-use and over-crowding. That's the real reason why 
"there aren't any other spaces." Promoters have been shooting themselves 
in the foot with their actions. So now ACME's gone. What'll be the next 
place to get burnt? Bets anyone?

hehe, oops! I sent this to the nw-raves list!  heh

uhm...

====================
I read some of the noise about the Acme location, and I didn't make it to
this party so I don't have anything to say about it, but I did want to say
that with the _vast_ resources I see here in the bay area, we should
definately be able to have new spaces often.  I recently moved here from the
Seattle scene, and we had pretty good luck with spaces.  As a promoter you
have to CALL call call, talk to everyone that might have resources.
Sometimes if you have to deal with permits, it can slow you down pretty fast
-  but still this is a big area, and I don't know about you guys, but I've
driven my _ass off_ over the hills and through the woods even to get to a
good rave.  In Seattle it got to a point where you could put 'in a virgin
warehouse' or 'new space!' on your flyer or by word of mouth and it was just
the shit before you even saw it... there is something about a fresh space.
oops, I delurked.

Here's a really cool puzzle to play with on a Monday afternoon--
what's the only word in the english language that contains the
letters u-f-a, in that order, somewhere in the word?  
   (guaranteed to drive you mad for at least 10 minutes, possibly days :)

by the way, does anyone know if F&F is happening this weekend?  I thought
I saw a post about it a while back... hope I didn't miss the tix
distribution!

I'm willing to help with this, although I don't think I have the energy
(heavy school load) to head this project.  Maybe we could break the tasks
up among us so it would not be so big of a job for one person.

	here's how you can help.

	draft up a letter about officer haggett and your displeasure
	that he still has his job.  fax it or email it (i suspect
	tha faxing gets noticed more) to the sf supes and the
	mayor.  be very respectful and non-abusive, but firmly tell
	them that you do not feel safe with haggett holding a badge
	and that you want him fired - as perscribed by his numerous
	warnings and previous punnishments.

thanx!  let's make a fucking *difference*.

	below is a story from the /chronicle/ that ran today.  officer
	haggett is the man that i and many of my friends witnessed
	betaing a friend of ours at a party raid.  her "crime" was
	that she was observing the officers beating other partygoers
	from a respectful distance and then taking photographs of
	the police officers actions.

	hagget has repetedly flaunted the law and violently violated
	citizens rights.  we waited two years for our turn at justice
	for his actions on new years 1994.  we thought we had some
	sembelance of justice recently, but the police power establishment
	has ruled against the citizens.  i urge you to take whatever action
	you think you can in this matter - letters to the police
	commisioner, board of supes, mayor willie brown and the media.
	how can we, as citizens, feel safe in san francisco if the systems
	that are here to protect us *and* the systems to watchdog
	them send us a clear message that we are not the priority,
	rather the systems themselves are.

	haggett's actions are patterned: violent outbursts against
	citizens and then completely lying in inquiry as to what caused
	his unwarranted actions.  i know this for *fact* because i
	observed one of these incidents first hand and his subsequent
	explanation of my friend "yelling and inciting the partygoers
	to riot" as a warrant for her beating, false imprisonment and
	mysterious disappearance of the film in her camera while
	in police impound.  i know what she was doing - standing and taking
	pictures, which is not illegal in the least.  in fact, it is
	within the law to observe police action without interfering.
	she was attacked for this, and it is reasonable for some of
	us who were there to assume that this attack was an effort to
	prevent those pictures from existing.

	there are plenty of good, valuable police officers out there
	who are doing their best to to serve and protect our citizens.
	those who are clearly out to commit violence and violate rights
	should be imprsoned, not employed at the taxpayers expense.

	most of us will not settle for anything less than his badge
	at this point.  please do what you can to help.  hopefully
	our leaders will be strong and advocate for us citizens, who,
	so far, have been ignored and taunted with false hopes,
	promises, and lies.  thank you for your time.

Cop's Suspension May Violate Rules

Susan Sward, Bill Wallace, Chronicle Staff Writers

     The San Francisco Police Commission's decision
     last week to allow Sergeant John Haggett to
     remain on the force after finding him guilty of four
     firing offenses appears to violate the department's
     own guidelines for disciplining officers convicted of
     misconduct.

     After finding the 38-year-old officer guilty of falsely
     arresting three people, using excessive force and
     filing a false report in connection with a 1995 New
     Year's Day police raid on an AIDS benefit, the
     five-member commission voted to suspend
     Haggett for six months.

     The commission and Police Chief Fred Lau said
     they decided not to fire Haggett because they
     did not want to impose the department's most
     severe penalty on him for an incident in which
     many other officers made mistakes.

     Lau did not return The Chronicle's call for
     comment, and John Keker, chairman of the
     commission, was out of town and could not be
     reached. Haggett's lawyer, James Lassart, also did
     not respond to a Chronicle request for comment.

     Department guidelines adopted by the
     commission in 1994 stress the need for
     ``progressive discipline.'' They call for an officer's
     disciplinary history to be used in evaluating an
     officer's current misconduct charge.

     Haggett has one of the most extensive misconduct
     records of any member of San Francisco's
     2,000-member force. In 14 years on the force, he
     has had two previous 90-day suspensions for
     excessive force, the maximum suspension at the
     time; has been named in six lawsuits with more than
     $70,000 in damages against the city so far; and he
     has been the target of dozens of complaints from
     citizens.

     Critics say the department's apparent failure to
     act according to its own guidelines shows it lacks
     the will to discipline rogue cops.

     ``An explanation is owed as to why the
     department's own disciplinary guidelines were
     abandoned in this case,'' said John Crew, an
     attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union
     who monitors the Police Department.

     Lawrence Sherman, chairman of the criminology
     department at the University of Maryland and an
     expert on police misconduct, said that while he
     does not know the details of Haggett's record, he
     has never encountered a case in which an officer
     with such a substantial prior disciplinary history was
     not dismissed from the department upon the next
     substantiated incident.

     ``I have looked at a lot of police departments,
     and I can't recall a case with that much prior
     discipline against an officer who was still on the
     force,'' Sherman said.

     Here are some of the major incidents in Haggett's
     career:

     -- James Tahsini was 19 years old when he
     encountered Haggett in May 1987. The officer
     approached him at midnight outside the Diamond
     Heights Safeway and asked to look in the duffel
     bag in which Tahsini was carrying two six-packs of
     beer. Tahsini says that when he told Haggett ``you
     have no reason to look in my bag,'' the officer
     ``grabbed me by my throat, slammed me against
     the hood of his car and started hitting me.''

     ``At first, I thought he was psychotic -- the way he
     slammed me against his car and hit me with his
     pistol and pointed it at my face,'' said Tahsini.
     Tahsini later testified that Haggett told him, ``I'm
     not in the mood for this s--.''

     The 150-pound Tahsini found himself lying on his
     back with his hands handcuffed underneath him. At
     that point, ``He (Haggett) stepped on my throat as
     if I was some sort of animal. It was just the way he
     was standing on me. You know when you see a
     movie where the hunter kills the wolf and steps on it
     to pose for the picture? It was sort of like that.''

     All charges against Tahsini, including resisting arrest
     and assaulting an officer, were subsequently
     dropped. Haggett earned a 90-day suspension in
     this case.

     At the end of the police commission hearing on
     the Tahsini case, then-Police Chief Frank Jordan
     called the allegations ``very serious'' and
     recommended that Haggett be suspended for 90
     days and fired if he engaged in another act of
     misconduct.

     Police Commission President Lou Giraudo was
     equally stern.

     ``Under no circumstances could I possibly sit here
     and believe that that which occurred in the
     parking lot . . . was reasonable behavior on your
     part,'' Giraudo said in imposing the suspension.
     ``We are saying 90 days because that's the
     maximum short of termination that this commission
     can do, to let you and your fellow officers know
     that we do consider it a most serious matter.''

     -- Later that year, Haggett appeared before the
     same commission and the same chief -- this time
     charged with smashing another teenager in the
     face with his walkie-talkie after the youth failed to
     sit down fast enough for him.

     According to police commission records, Haggett
     hit the teenager, Matthew O'Leary, at least twice
     with the heavy metal-and-plastic radio, breaking
     O'Leary's nose. During an investigation of the
     incident by the Office of Citizens Complaints,
     Haggett told investigator Araceli Matus that he
     did not know the department's general order
     governing the use of force on suspects. Haggett
     dismissed the departmental regulation as ``an
     opinion written by people that don't work in the
     street anymore.''

     In November 1988, the commission found Haggett
     guilty of using excessive force on O'Leary. But
     instead of firing him as Jordan had suggested four
     months earlier, the commission suspended
     Haggett for another 90 days.

     Police Commissioner Jose Medina, who was on the
     commission at the time Haggett received both
     suspensions, said the commission's hands were
     tied in those cases by the recommendation of the
     chief. The commission followed Jordan's
     recommendations by imposing the longest
     possible suspensions -- three months without pay.

     Medina said that even though Jordan had
     recommended that Haggett be fired for any
     further misconduct after the Tahsini case, Jordan
     did not ask that Haggett be terminated for
     beating O'Leary.

     ``He failed to follow his own recommendation,''
     Medina said of the former police chief. ``What he
     recommended was a suspension, and we
     imposed 90 days, the maximum that was allowable
     at the time.''

     Attempts to reach Jordan were unsuccessful.

     -- Court documents filed in connection with a
     police brutality lawsuit in 1989 showed that at that
     time Haggett had been named in 27 complaints
     ``which contain allegations that officer Haggett
     either falsely arrested a person or used excessive
     force in the course of the arrest.''

     The suit also indicated that Haggett had been
     named in 16 other complaints alleging conduct
     unbecoming an officer, neglect of duty or
     discourtesy toward citizens -- and 13 other
     complaints of various types of misconduct,
     including three that were still under investigation.

     -- In addition to the dozens of citizen complaints
     that have been filed against Haggett, he has also
     been named in six lawsuits that have cost city
     taxpayers more than $72,000 in jury awards and
     settlements.

     In a 1986 suit, Christopher Torres, an Ingleside
     District man, claimed he was dragged from his car
     and beaten by Haggett and other officers after he
     cruised through a stop sign on his way home. It
     later turned out that the officers had mistaken him
     for another man with a similar name who was
     wanted on a $160 warrant.

     During the incident, ``Haggett jumped me from
     behind and put a lock on my neck and grabbed
     my hair and threw me on the ground,'' Torres said
     during his testimony about the incident in Superior
     Court.

     ``I was screaming, telling my neighbors to stop
     him,'' Torres said. ``I yelled out that he was hurting
     me . . . (then) he choked me so tight I couldn't
     yell.''

     One of Torres' neighbors, Marie Louise Fernandez,
     confirmed Torres' story in her own sworn testimony.
     ``I remember thinking that he must have robbed a
     bank or murdered somebody because they
     (police) were not treating him as an ordinary
     citizen,'' Fernandez testified. ``He was being
     treated as a criminal.''

     Shortly after a Superior Court jury began hearing
     the testimony in Torres' case, the city settled his
     lawsuit for $35,000.

     -- FBI agents are conducting a federal civil rights
     investigation into Haggett's fatal shooting last year
     of parolee Edwin Sheehan, 40, who had a long
     string of convictions for drug abuse and one for
     armed robbery.

     Haggett shot Sheehan after the parolee drove
     into several vehicles in the Tenderloin while
     attempting to flee from police. Haggett said he
     thought Sheehan had a gun and made furtive
     movements. Investigators at the scene searched
     Sheehan's body and found he had been
     unarmed.

     Kenneth Quigley, an attorney for Sheehan's family,
     said at the time: ``All he did was run. He didn't fight
     them, and he didn't shoot them. All he did was try
     to get away.''

     As for Tahsini, putting his 1987 encounter with
     Haggett behind him has been a difficult ordeal, in
     part because lawyers keep seeking him out to
     testify in cases they have pending against the
     officer.

     ``I know a lot of cops who are good cops,'' said
     Tahsini, who collected a $35,000 jury award for his
     encounter with Haggett.

     ``There are a few bad apples who make it worse
     for everyone else (and put) a bad rap on the
     whole department,'' Tahsini said.

     ``With Haggett's record, once, twice, three times
     maybe you let it go. But when it's continuous, it's
     getting out of hand. Obviously something is
     wrong.''

Hey, are there any women out there that snowboard? If so let me know.  I'd

Ok maybe everyone's getting sick of reading reviews for the same party. 
However, I am -VERY EXCITED-  because this was my first city party in two 
months and i just wanted to share that excitement with you all.

The vibe was great the music was great it was all damn great.
I loved the circle pictures in the red room and the one of the gears in 
the entrance hallway. Red was a good offset to the blue of the main room. 
i also -loved- the circle laser thing where the water was. It was 
probably the simplest, most repetitive laser pattern ever but it was so 
neat and trippy like that.

DRC rocked my world! She played some of her own new tracks and let me 
tell you... Unh! Power!

We drove five hours to get to that party and it was worth every drawn out 
minute of that crusty exhausting drive.

I met some rad enthusiastic people and even saw some people that I knew 
when I lived in Monterey. It really makes me want to go to school in SF; 
I feel so isolated up here, even though it is very beautiful.

Had wonderful randomly deep conversations with random people.
I had hoped to meet more SFR people but I did meet Andy (hello to you!).

Decided to let go of the scene for a little while, at least until I move 
down there. Making the trip to often I could get crispy burnt. But I 
definitely want to go down again this semester sometime.

zippety doo da!

oops!  I forgot to explain my reasoning...
The puzzle was worded "somewhere in the word", so I interpreted that as that
the letter must be in that order but not necessarily next to each other :)

Hey all,

for those of you with an interest in ambient music and who are willing to
look beyond what's on the shelves in Ameba I can recommend the CD with
the music of the movie "Jacob's Ladder". I picked up the last copy from
Virgin records this weekend and am very happy with it. It took a while to
locate the CD but the movie is available on video and definitely worth
watching. Although it's in the horror section and containes some bad trip-
like footage it is in fact a very fascinating movie about life and death
and what is just in between (that was a clue, in fact it may take a while
before you get an idea of what is actually going on). If you rent it, check
out especially the music accompanying the scenes where Jacob is running
a high fever up to the point where he returns to the moment where he is
back on the stretcher in Vietnam and taken to the chopper. ("High fever"
on the CD, at t=1:50 and further on...).
Enjoy.

Wow!  Talk about watching a seed turn into a flower!  I feel obligated to 
nurture this growth, since I sowed the seed, but I'm no gardener (ie, I 
suck at organizing).  I did, however, put together a list of e-mail from 
people who expressed interest:

 CT <ctd-zine@ix.netcom.com>,
 "nathan.b.beckord" <nathan.b.beckord@ArthurAndersen.com>,
 Dan Capriles <c9d@ix.netcom.com>,
 Melissa Wong <inanna@best.com>,
 karen m keefe <kmk42406@email.csun.edu>,
 Rick Riffle <rdriffle@ucdavis.edu>,
 Alex <bwret@best.com>,
 Noah Ruiz <noah@cadence.com>,
 Pengo! <blake@luna.tenetwork.com>,
 MarsMyRat@aol.com,


--Pengo mentioned a lodge he *may* have access to, but has to wait for 
  the go.

--CT has "a place up at south shore for anyone who's ever interested in 
  spontaneous trips up!"


So, here's the ball.  Anyone proficient, and willing to run with it?

Hey all,

Being Dutch, and therefore supposed to have a thing with water, fingers in
dikes and all that, I couldn't refuse my friends invitation to join them
to the Sunset boat party. This was a first for me and I have to say I wasn't
dissapointed. Although we left about 1.5 hours behind schedule (apparently
somebody got kicked off the boat because of being too fucked-up and
aggressive as I was told) we cruised for a few hours through the bay.
Interestingly, the boat had a full bar and those who keep insisting that
alcohol has no place at raves stood corrected. Everybody was real friendly
and relaxed which goes to show that it's really _the people_ and not the
drink that make the difference.

The scenery was great and floating under the GG and Bay bridges was quite
a sight. The music on the lower deck was a little bit too house oriented
and monotonous for my taste, although it definitely had the crowd moving.
It was a bit crowded though and the way the speakers were set up required
everybody to stand near the DJ to really feel the bass so I decided to
alternate a lot between dancing and wandering aimlessly through the ship.
The music on the upper deck went from ambient to jungle. Got into
conversations with two different people completely at random, only to find out
later they were both friends/co-worker of another friend of mine and
I'm still wondering what the chances of that were. Found that dancing
with the boat moving underneath you yields interesting effects (and
masks any incompetence actually).

Anyway, I had a great time, although I would have liked a bit more variation
in the kind of music being played. Definitely worth checking out in the
next season, which unfortunately I will not be able to enjoy in SF...

Thanks for the tip Dutchman!  I know that there are tons of great
soundtracks lurking around out there.  Ten years later and I still love
listening to the soundtrack of The Last Temptation of Chritst.  Any other
suggestions?

Hi all!

 Well, I have called the promoter (from Get Down) twice asking for _half_ 
of my agreed upon fee (to be paid irregardless of whether the party was 
busted or not) and to no one's surprise he has not called back. In the 
interest of giving an idiot a break I have withheld certain info but no more;

 My intuition knew from the start that this was a slimey operation by the 
way I was approached; Madvi (sp?), the girlfriend of Miguel the promoter 
basically approached me, at the CCC party with Goa Gil, asking me if I 
would be interested in working Get Down. As she was talking to me she 
essientially was rubbing her breasts on me and getting really close (in a 
semi hot n heavy way). I sorta dug it as I was EssiEntially in a warm 
friendly mood.

 The next clue was that I never again talked to her again, only to Miguel. 
This guy didn't have a clue on how to do anything and was constantly asking 
me for names, phone #s, and advice on how to do things. Then he would 
take the info and lie to venue owners/operators about who he knew so he 
could get a space. Did I listen to my intuition then? NOOOOOOOOOOOOO. Yeesh.

 Well Miguel was always promising me to call at some time and took at 
least two days to accomplish that at any given moment. And oh man was he 
a fast talker.

 The final straw was him not showing up to his own party until AFTER it 
was shut down; about 12:30 am - 6 hours after he said he would be there. 
Yea, I think he called the cops on his own party.

 Anyway, whatever. If anyone wants to call this ass and his slutty 
girlfriend here are the numbers;

VM 		800-731-1557
VM/Pager	888-361-2779
Home		510-644-8308
 
 I mostly put these #s up so those that bought presale tickets could 
bother the guy (at least untill he changes all his #s) and to also show 
him (and other despoilers of the vibe) that this shit will not go 
unchallenged. This guy has done more to fuck the scene than anyone in a 
long time.

    !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!FUCK MIGUEL AND HIS SLUT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!


 My apologies to the list for the vulgarity. I also relise that 
disclosing this info may make promoters less likely to want to work with 
me... oh well.



peas,

Ran

My expected gig playing the opening set for a party in Portland with
Derrick Carter and another Chicago DJ to follow, this Saturday, has been
scratched.  Parties got merged, more or less, and I'm off the ticket.
I was planning to go to Sunset anyway on Sunday, so might come down for
the whole weekend at this point.

I think it will only make the promoters who are sneaky stupid bastards 
not want to work with you :) i would hope that the GOOD promoters would 
see your point of view.

Mind you, i also enjoy a good stab of revenge when someone's pissed me 
off badly enough, so maybe i'm biased :)

hi folks,

i've really got the energy and the vibe to do it right now and i want to
send you all lots of *love* right now.

the following are my opinions...

everywhere we go and everything we do we've got the opportunity to learn
from our situations and and use our free will as a magic wand to do the
karmically correct thing, we should keep this in mind and also keep in
mind that what we percieve is only our perception, i.e., the folks
posting, the folks reading the posts, the promoters, the partiers, ect.
i'm saying, we all attract experiences to ourselves at times that may seem
painful, that may make us angry.  we learn and grow, especially in the
rave scene or whatever you want to call it, this stuff will still come up
as long as we need it for our growth.

i wasn't there, but it sounds like there was an intention that wasn't made
clear.  always be clear of the intentions.  always be clear about your
intentions.

i say this because being faced with a scene here in Portland that can be
utterly vibeless at times and racked with odd intent, i have had to ask
myself, how have i contributed to this?  besides the music, the ideal of
the love vibe is what has me hooked on this shit.  the only way i'm going
to have it is taking care of my shit, taking care of myself, loving myself
and then loving those immediately around me so that when i go to a party
my karma is clear.

i know this from personal experience and i just wanted to share it.  also,
i hope to say hi to many of you at Tigger.  i didn't get a chance to say
hi (because i didn't know who you were!) to many from the list, 'cept i
did meet a guy in the bathroom (?) (i had shoulder length dreds).  but
i'll be singing in the ambient room at tigger so please say hi.

extra special warm, vibey hugs to randy...

love,

brenda

ok. got the harmony web page up and going, i'll be posting more info as
soon as i know what's going on. In the meantime, feel free to take a look,
it's at http://www.cyborganic.com/people/erase/harmony/
(the bar on the left side might look a bit funny - but it's not my fault!
it's netscapes! really!! there is a problem with frame interpretation on
unix and ibm platforms, i believe the mac version is fine)
the page is linked off hyperreal as well, incidently.

if anyone has some good pictures from any of the harmony parties, i'd like
to get my hands on them and scan them for the page.... hint hint. :)

hhhhhhmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm


 Well the chances I shot off my mouth again are pretty high. I really 
hate it when that happens. :(

 I was just contacted by Miguel from Get Down. He is unhappy about what 
he heard from me on the message phone (and I can't wait till he hears 
about my "get even" post =(  ). But he says he wants to pay me qnd 
everyone else he owes money to. He then wants to throw a free party to 
make up for this past fiasco.

 If he does this (and pay back the presale tix bought) I'm going to be 
looking for an awefully damn big bottle of catsup. The fact that he 
called me back and says he wants to take care of his incurred debts 
already raises my respect for him immensly (sp?). I really hope he does 
make me eat my words!! It will only help the scene. Only time will tell. 
I'll keep you folks posted from this end.

 If there are any people connected with Get Down I would like to say that 
I won't apologise now, but I'm starting to feel humbled again.

potentially in shame,


Ran

Someone might want to talk to SteveO from the list....he set up the one last
year that has become so legendary.  Someone should try to get that same
cabin.  It was so great....three stories with the huge hot tub and sauna,
and a masive living room for dancing.  

I'm up for playing live again, and maybe providing sound, decks and a mixer.
I'd like to split all that stuff up if possible, but if it comes down to it,
I have everything.  I'll have to check on the sound though, because it
belongs to my partner.  We know from last time that more than 25 could
easily fit in one of those cabins though.  We could probably have done about
35 to 40, I think.  What do some of you old timers from last year think?

heard, and not a whisper. Escape us for all our spouting, nor the
needle scratching upon this gramophone of the circular cosmic spot.
Hear me, mark me, learn me, throw the mind's ear open. Shut up the
mind's eye, all will be music. What sculpture of sound cannot, what
cannot as a fluid token words, that nothing else cannot."

Alright, I know I'm pissy and I haven't had my coffee yet, HOWEVER:

#1:  Is it REALLY necessary to pick on eachother's grammar?
#2:  If you think that it is, could you please send trite shit like this privately
or marked NRR so the rest of us who DON'T think it's necessary don't
have to deal with it?

Thank You! :)

hi all,

within the next few days, we will have installed our RealAudio 3.0 server
here at x-radio.  Once this happens, we would like to start a weekly
netcasting program.  To make it simple, we are planning on just netcasting
mixtapes at first (and at some point, possibly netcasting live).

So, if you've got mix tapes that you'd like us to netcast, get in touch with
me.  All mix tapes should have the playlist so that we can credit the
original artists.  We will, of course, credit you for supplying the tapes.

Thanks all, and have a great day1

pauly

[ message for "old" ( 1994 era ) SFRavers ]

 I'm filling out a personell questionaire, and my memory's a bit hazy on
answering the "Ever charged, tried, or convicted of any crimes?"
question. Can those who were invovled in the busted birthday party for
Bryce Ryan please tell me:

1. Wasn't it reduced from a misdemenor to a citation or some lesser
   charge?
2. We all involved paid $50 each for the lawyer and the fine, as a
   group deal?

 Please respond ASAP, those who remember!

 Thanks loads - Larry Ching/larryc@netcom.com

While I agree that Irregardless is redundant and the combination of two
words, your response that it IS NOT a word is not accurate.

Websters Collegiate Dictionary - Tenth Edition:
Irregardless - adv. - [prob. blend of irrespective and regardless] (ca.
1912) nonstand: regardless
USAGE  Irregardless originated in dialectal American speech in the early
20th century.  Its fairly wide spread use in speech called it to the
attention of usage commentators as early as 1927.  The most frequently
repeated remark about it is that "there is no such word."  There is such a
word, however.  It is still used primarily in speech, although it can be
found from time to time in edited prose.  Its reputation has not risen over
the years, and is still a long way from general acceptance.  Use regardless
instead.

FYI
Tony

No kidding!  That rave was incredible.  Massives are really not like that 
anymore.  These days, it's just - I dunno - different.  Most of the 
greatest parties of my life have been the massives of 1993.  But the past 
is the past - nothing we can do about that.  I can only concentrate on 
the future and how to make it a great one.

Although I missed the pre-Mad dinner, I was (contrary to popular
belief) still in the Bay Area ;). But I promised myself last night,
that even though I was going to Mad, I wasn't going to dance... In
fact, I even went in disguise: *no* glitter, *no* flashing lights, not
*even* any laminates... I was just going to take it easy and recover
from the weekend.

But when Drenalin played that slow acidy/trip-hop track that grooooved
and grooooved, and got faster and *faster* and *FASTER* until it
exploded(!) --- w0w! 

Okay, I gave in :)

It was the first time I had heard Scott, and you can really tell that
he's an ambient DJ at heart: tracks with long, lush beatless breaks -
but then it surprises you with a sudden build-up, and (wham) you're
pounding the dance floor again. very cool :) I'd like to hear him and
Joe Rice spin back to back some night...

But being the grumpy old raver that I am, I left (reluctantly) during
Sho's set to get some sleep. I'm really getting to like Sho a lot; too
bad he spun last.

As always, worth my $2 :)

Steve

I have to agree with Ariel...let's respect each other and try to use good
grammar and spelling...but let's not pick on each other.  And if u MUST do
it atleast send it privately so that the person gains something from it and
is not made a fool of.

I haven't seen anything posted that says its not happening, but I haven't seen
anything that says it is either.  Last I heard (on Friday night) was they had
1 or 2 leads on possible spaces.

(Apologies to anyone intimately involved with creating this party - it 
was the best pun I could come up with on the spot)

Anyone else endure the last Funky Tekno in May, the one in the gigantic 
warehouse close to HomeBase?

For those who didn't go, let me synopsize:

$25.  HUGE warehouse, one room only.  (Well, one TINY room off to the 
side).   Speakers surrounding half of it for a dancespace.  The other 
half of the room was barren, milling people, bad sound, dark.  No chill area 
at all.  No decorations to speak of.  Uneven vibe, decent at times.  A few 
lasers.  A large Flinstones-like/rock-constructed stage for the dj.  Paid dancing 
women.  DJ Dan, Chris Flores from LA.  Several special acts/attractions 
advertised that did not materialize. But cool firedancers in the morning.

That's it.  That's all there was to it.  Worth $25?  Not a chance in hell.

I still had fun.  I ALWAYS have fun at raves.  But I DID NOT see where 
this money went at all.  It certainly didn't show in the party.

It was the last massive I ever went to.

Hopefully more is going into the Halloween Tribal MASSIVE.  We'll see.

well... steve's right. FnF just doesn't look like it's going to happen, so
I'm hoping to see the ENTIRE FnF crowd out at the Tribal Massive... if we
can't have an FnF this halloween, we might as well make FTT as fun as
possible. I'll be there, wearing my FnF laminate from the 7/27 Friends &
Family. =)

take care,

Yes, unfortunately after finding that Chrysalis (which had been planned for 
that same night) had been canceled, I found myself with a group of friends 
waiting in an hour-long line for that same silly party, finding out *after* 
waiting that hour that it was $25 at the door when it was advertised as $20 
beforehand, watched drunken idiots swill down as much JD as possible before 
falling into a window and breaking it to be hauled away by the police 
afterwards, watched bottles get smashed onto the pavement, helplessly observed 
large groups of people cut into the already long line, found myself in an 
enormous empty space almost entirely devoid of decoration, found that half the 
promised dj's were nowhere to be found, found a kick-ass system with kick-ass 
music blaring out of it, danced my ass off all night, and somehow had a really 
killer time in spite of it all.  Then I went outside after the party to find 
that our car had been broken into and my purse stolen. :(  I will not bother to 
attend another massive, with the possible exception of The Gathering in 
December.  I've certainly been able to hear kick-ass music even for free at 
times!  I do not need to make these other sacrifices for it.  But of course, 
this is all IMHO. :)

I hope all who attend have a fabulous time! :)


Love,
Shawna

Well........i don't like massives either...but the line-up looks promising.
I hope they put some energy into the party and the space.  I hope to see
(and meet) some of u there.  Most of my friends are going and what is better
than spending halloween with your friends....and hopefully making some NEW ones.

:P

Wel, someone previously said let's find out what we need.

Why?  'Cause we all love to mix our passions!  aaaaahhhhhh...
	Board all day, dance all night, it's my personal dream!

When?  Thanksgiving, X-mas, some random weekend?

Where?  WE have offers of places in South Shore Lake Tahoe -- two in fact.

	place to board?

Who?  well, the list is growing
	
	DJs?

And the two most important:

	HOW?   How was it done in the past?  Words of wisdom?  Leadership?

	WHAT?   What will it take for this to go off smooth?
		What do we need?


If I can find the time, I will put together a review of things offered us 
and suggestions.  As for the list of folks, look below.  

Does anyone know SteveO  who did the snow thing last year?

I agree with Nancy all the way!  This party sucked!  I made the decision
never to go to a massive again after that party.  They pissed a lot of
people off... including me.

Hey, you know what?  CT has a group photo of a bunch of SFR people 
(including you, of course =)  )  waiting in line for this party!  It's
labelled as being a picture from Freedom, and I remember thinking 
"Hey, I wasn't at Freedom, was I?"  But I wasn't sure.  But when you
said "watched drunken idiots swill down as much JD as possible before
falling into a window" it all came back to me.  "Oh yeah, it was
FTT!" =) 

I remember that party pretty well...  I had decided to go sober, which
had turned out to be a good idea as a bunch of my friends ended up
with bad dosEs and had a not-so-good time.  But I did meet a lot of
people that night who are friends to this day, so there are quite a
few fond memories!  It's certainly a bonding experience to have a
kick-ass, happy time together, but strangely (or perhaps not so
strangely) it can be just as bonding to have a so-so time, but
have it together! 

The picture can be found at:
"http://www.cyborganic.com/people/ctdzine/photo/src/free0796.002.jpg"

And CT: update the caption!  =)

Smiles, 
     Chin

I hope for your sake it does go off.  I'm not going - for one thing I 
heard that it was advertised on LIVE 105 and tickets are available 
through Bass.  NO-THANK-YOU!!   I'd rather do NOTHING that night and just 
hold out for Tom's party" 2o12.  (Gee sounds like I'm promoting for that 
party or something the way I ramble on about it all the time! I'm just 
looking forward to it and Tom is one helluva good dj and person.  Plus I 
love trance!)

This weekend is Friends & Family or nothing.  Looks like I may have to 
plan to do nothing. :(


love,
Amy

     All this stinky talk (pew!  put yur shoes back on) reminds me of the 
     WORST rave i've ever been to.  i can't even remember what it was 
     called, but it was at the "Real Rock Cafe" at like 51st and 
     something-or-other.  I remember when i was walking out, the people who 
     were bouncers were like harley people that said things like "those 
     rave gigs...the kids just love them!"  
     
     One main speaker was right in the bar...
     
     the speakers were muddy...
     
     there were some 70's glamour girls into vanity there...
     
     they played like house mixed with KMEL jams stuff...
     
     oh, it was awful!
     
     :)
     
     phew!

All this talk of photos makes me remember that when I was at Madness
(in May, which apparently EVERYONE on the list went to) there was
someone there who took a picture that I just happened to be in.  I
had totally forgotten all about it until now, but if the person who
took that picture (or was taking pictures at that party) still has
them, will you please email me?  It would be a kick and a half to
have a copy of that photo.  Why do I have this feeling it was SDream?
 I think I'm crazy...

Hi everybody. I've been lurking for a while, but Nancy has given me the
perfect occasion to introduce myself. (For those of you who were at Mad
last night, I was the skinny-ish guy with red-blonde hair, about 6'1",
with flourescent fingernail polish, nikes, and a striped thrift-store
shirt).

In defense of Stinky Tekno Tribe, I consider it the best night of my life.
When I got there, the line was ridiculous, so I climbed a couple of
fences, walked along the train track, uncovered a secret entrance to the
warehouse by moving a board, evaded a security guard, and snuck in.

During the night I danced as hard as I could. The music was
amazing, I really liked the lasers, and (this is the big one) I fell
in love.
 
(for those of you snickering: no, I was not on e -- I was completely
sober, except for a mini-thin or two. :) )

I admit the vibe was a bit weird; people kept coming up to me and Cindy
(the girl I fell in love with) and refused to believe we weren't on
crystal or speed. The line was absurd. And a good chill space was sorely
missed.

Even so, FTT (as one of my first raves) really got me into dancing,
electronic music, and the whole scene. that's why I have to come to it's
defense.

-dave

ps. (although, if BASS is selling tickets to the upcoming one, there's
nothing that can be said for that)

Hello everyone!!

        Well, I bring good news!!! I talked to Omar!!! Yes that means that
he is speaking and can hold a, well, relatively good conversation. He has
only been takling for a little while now, and his vocab. is tremendous!! He
uses words that I don't even know the meaning of!! (Not saying that I am an
English wiz, which I am not) He remembers a lot, but some of his memory is
patchy. He remembers certain parties. He can remember certain things about
Burning Man. But he has a bad time with dates, and numbers. Slowly but
surely his memory will come back!

        I told him about the party we are doing for him (A Wrinkle in Time)
and he got really excited. He said,"I'm ready to go!!" I said, "Omar, you
are going to miss this one unfortunatly, but maybe next time!" He agreed...
He is really excited about all of us coming together to help him get through
these hard times. He knows of, and feels everything we have done for him so
far, and is very grateful....

        So with this in mind, I ask that all of you come out to this very
special healing party!! Bring your best, most positive vibes, and send them
in Omar's direction!! This will prove to be a very intense night for Omar,
as well as the rest of the Harmony Family. We have been shaken up and really
hurt for a long time because of this tragedy. There has been an ungodly
amount of emotions (good and bad) bouncing to and from each of us. Well now
it's time to come together to create positive energy from this awful
negative occurance!!!

        Tigger Productions (Omar and Harmony) proudly present... 

                                (Drumz Please)

                             "A Wrinkle In Time"

        DJs = Matt - (The other) Matt - Ethan - Minor Minor - Jason + mtba

        
        Ambience provided by = Dionysus Dreams

                        (415)263-4885   (408)450-3044


        The party will be in S.F. and will go from 9:30pm - 6am. Admission
will be $15 - $20 strickly depending on how much you can give. We want to
charge a lot for this party, so that we can make some $ for Omar. But we
don't really want to charge an arm and a leg, so this is what we have come
up with. But hey if you have a spare arm or leg laying around, bring it!!!
Now, remember this is a benefit party, so, for Omar bring what you can! If
that means, "get well" cards, stuft animals, or just a big giant mental hug,
bring it!! Anything that will brighten his day is what we want!!!

        Also, our ambient room will be totally interactive. Which means that
you guys can play on the keyboards, drums, etc. (sorry no djing though) Also
we will have a full VIRTUAL REALITY machine!!!! You all have to try this!!!!
(mmmmmm...) There will be a whole separate room set aside for a healing drum
circle, as well as group/or singular meditations. So BRING YOUR DRUMS!!!!!!!
(if you don't have a drum, borrow one, buy one, build one!!! Just bring one!!!) 

        Also, if you have anything that you would like to bring to add to
our chill rooms or even our dance room, write to me or call the info
lines!!! Also, for those of you that are interested, there will be a meeting
for this party on Thursday Oct 24th. It will be at City Espresso on Stevens
Creek Blvd, in San Jose. Starting @ 7:30pm So you should come if you're
interested in helping with this party!!! (And that means YOU!!)

Peace, love and harmony to all,

Greg =)
Peace, love and harmony to all!!!

The soundtrack to "Night on Earth" is EXCELLENT.  Tom Waits did it, an
original score.  If you like Tom Waits, you'll like this soundtrack.  The
movie is absolutely hilarious, too.

That figures! It was the only sf party I've ever been to! Being such a

     ha ha!  that happened to me at ComeUnity last month.  some girl came 
     up to me and asked me what i had taken tonight, as if it were a 
     prerequisite to entering the party.  i responded "nothing" because it 
     had not occurred to me to take anything.  it's funny how people's 
     perceptions of the world can be.  A lot of people have pretty funky 
     control dramas they have to work through.

sober, except for a mini-thin or two. :) )
     
I admit the vibe was a bit weird; people kept coming up to me and Cindy 
(the girl I fell in love with) and refused to believe we weren't on 
crystal or speed. The line was absurd. And a good chill space was sorely 
missed.

What is the spirit of raving all about???
What is the spirit of Halloween all about??

To me, Halloween is like the biggest rave-like holiday of all time.  It 
reminds me of youth and the playfulness of my childhood.  Its like 
being young and getting all dressed up and having everybody smile at 
you.  You can dress goofy, weird, odd, strange, scary, or anyway, and 
nobody judges you because its Halloween.  And on top of it they give 
you candy and love for being the special person you are.  It seems like 
Raving has adapted many of its most positive virtues from the SPIRIT of 
Halloween.  For this reason I like to think of Halloween as the 
Birthday or NewYears of Raving.

This Halloween: Thursday, October 31st;  Come and rejoyce the Beautiful 
spirit of raving by escaping into a celebration for the SPIRIT of 
Halloween.

In 1992, Feel Good E., and others introduced you to CASPER.   Now we 
are going to regress even furthur down the evelutionary ladder, and 
start from scratch.  SPIRIT will be a diferent type of Halloween rave.  
We will have  Lots of candy, free stuff, many surprises, toy and prize 
giveaways, games, and a MaskaRave costume contest, and an incredible 
decorative haloween production, with special guests and surprises 
throughout the night.  

There will be a huge haunted house chill room amd 2 rooms of sound.
The dj's for the night will be:

In the Spiritual Dreamscape:
Dj's:  Jin, Tayco, Garth, Simon, Kimo, & Jazz-E

In the ThurZdaze Beat Chamber:
Dj's:  Ghost, Frank Nitty, Essence, Tripnotix, Paucus, Spinner, & Chad

The party will go all night long,  from 9pm til 6am.  We hava a ton of 
safe and secured parking.  Its a real relaxing feeling to be able to 
party and know that your car will be there when you are ready to go 
home.  We are also very close to public transit for those of you that 
don't drive.

THIS is going to be a REAL Halloween Rave for REAL Halloween Ravers.  
Admision is only $10 if you wear a costume and bring toys or 
Trick-or-Treat candy to share.  Door prizez will be given for the best 
and most creative costumes.

The SPIRIT of Halloween is all about FUN.  You can dance like a freak 
to great music all night long, while surrounded by all your friends, 
dressed up all crazy, and feel like more than just being at a party, 
but feel like YOU ARE A PART OF THE PARTY.  Your spirit, and positive 
attitude are the key ingredients that are going to make this such a 
memorable Halloween Rave.  Hope to see you there.

For all information call:   415-915-1704   or    510-340-9401

PS:  There are no flyers for this event, It is mostly word of mouth.  
Please help out by spreading the word to all your friends.
We will have more information to follow in the next few days.

I can hardly contain myself.

I'll be in town on Saturday, taking a break from this hellhole they call 
Chicago.

Count me in for FnF if it happens, if not, I'm sure that FTT will still 
be better than the dreck they throw around here. Hope to see everybody 
then!

Done. Oh, and that URL has changed.

to get to my photo album.

***** Plus, Can all you SFRavers with homepages please send me your 
URL to my business email mailto:ctdzine@cyborganic.net so I can 
include you in my megathumpersuperjungleisticambiegabber 6-way digital

section. Well okay, so it's just a links section, but it'll be cool 
when I'm done.

Looks like I'm gonna miss you guys this weekend without FnF happening, 
so I'm heading to Moontribe down here this weekend and I'll see you at 
Famtasia/SFR BBQ'n'BeatsIII/Harmony!!!!!

much love and energy,

Terry

A friend of mine here at school (north bay) is looking for two or three 
turntables (possibly a mixer too) and wanted me to try and find out where
the best places in the bay area to get some or if any of you have any 
you'd like to sell.
Thanks for your help.

	I DISAGREE with this post.  Liquid & I went to 2002AD and lots of fun.
	I may agree it wasn't quite worth $25, however, I did think the set
	up was quite outstanding...very original.

		I think this FTT will KICK ASS...especially w/ all of us
		SFRAVES folks...=)

I wonder if anyone out there can help me, I want more of this kind of
work...I would also like to get this song on cd or vinyl...I heard it on
radio transperent (kalx thursdays) (hows that for a plug)a few weeks ago
on some parts it says "has any one seen lowry? has anyone seen sam lowry"
and then later it says " now brothers and sisters , ladies and gentlemen,
the man youve been waiting for the drum beater, the system cheater..." etc
etc...then it busts into this funky beat with guitar and stuff...do you
know this song????

1015 folsom.  just a warning..  sketchy as hell.  new windows cost $185.

goes "wow, new york, just like i pictured!"..  any clues?  pls email.
(ps. it is on the "spun out 3+4" tape, great tape).

tx,

Don't know how many out there remember me but this is Eclipse went to
parties out there for awhile from 92-95 then decided it was about time to
goto college so headed to the midwest to rav...err goto school here.
Visited SF this summer on the way back to china and can't say how good it
was to visit the place where my heart and soul live. I plan to go there in
the winter and other breaks. If anyone remembers me give me a buzz would
love to keep in contact with some of you super people there :)

Hey there! 
Ben and me met this Dutch walking angel named D.J. Ganeshananda at the 
Psychedelicatessen debacle. We had a most interesting conversation with 
him about India, Bali, Singapore, Brindavan, Koh Phangang etc. We would 
really like to meet him again and continue that conversation. If anybody 
out there has any info. about him we would greatly appreciate it.
 
Ahhhhh. Yes the sweet sounds of Goa trance.

Until we meet..... again
Peace, Love and an undying commitment to the quest 
Dhiren and Ben

 I've never been to Mission Rock for an event yet. Can anyone give any
hints or warnings about the venue or the neighborhood or parking? At
the moment, I don't even know where it is! I'll look up the address
in the phone book ( assuming they have a listed phone number... )

 Actually I'm not hearing much complaints at all; just some honest feedback 
on what people have experienced. If anything I hear more whining from you 
about others commnts on massives.

 If you are in support of massives then great! Lets hear your support. 
But ORDERING people  and belittling them is mearly the sign of an 
insecure individual. With themselves and their choices.

Hey all!

You may not of missed me but I mis all you in SF.  I moved to San Luis 
Obispo last October and yes it's SLOW!  This town is so concervative but 
it reminds me of Pleasanton, my home town.

First thing I did was look for the local clubs, bard, and any rave 
scene.  And yes they have one.  A small one but it's hear.  There is no 
really good clubs.  They have the Grad on Wed. which is a country club 
every other night and Tortia Flats has a disco night on Tuesday.  Every 
thing else is traditional top 40 or country.

A couple of cal poly student throw parties here.  A total of 5 I believe 
in the past 2 years but this is going to change.  Last Saturday they had 
the biggest party here yet.  
The group goes by the name Urban Generation.  Some local dj's.  Santos 
from SF was suposed to be here Sat but I showed up late to the party to 
see if he spun.  Javier spun (one of the promoters who's origianly from 
LA) and Morgan and Spark-e.  The last two I heard were good.  I got to the 
party at 1 am (I work as a waiter and intraining to be the "sound guy"/mobal 
banquet dj at The Forum {a very financially stable banquet hall).  They 
had problems with the sound (pushing the level, bad amp or something and the 
power cut out too many times) 

The party was at a roller rink in Morro Bay.  10 pm - 3 am. Permits are 
scarce in this conservative area.  Morgan was on when I arrived.  Tight 
security, Club style lighting (search lights - don't know a better name), 
Lots of stuffed animals in the chill area.  About 80 people when I got 
there but I heard there was about 400 - 500 earlier.  Mostly hardcore 
raver types at this point.  Morgan spun some acid trance/break and 
Spark-e was more hardcore with hard trance and goa with a couple good 
breaks thrown in. (huge responce to Loose Caboose many DAN fans here - I 
know I've been makin copies of his tapes for people).  

At the end everyone (25ppl or so) joined in a circle huging, screaming, 
smiling and dancing to the last traks.  Great little family vibe.
After the party I helped break down a little and went back to Spark-e's 
place to continue dancing, listing to music and meeting many of the last 
people to leave the party.  Many friendly people.

I've been to 2 other HOUSE parties since I've been here including 
Jordan's bE-day party in SB (hi Sarvi) and met many 
local dj's including 2 who just moved here from Chicago to train to be 
firemen.  One is purchacing a sound system.  I've met many practicing 
dj's and some students that even design rave flyers.  

I'm hopin to help out and pull resources for a DIY down here.  I also met
Marious or is it Marcus (it was loud and I'm bad with names) The guy that 
threw Seismic parties in SF.  Well, he moved here too this summer and is 
throwing a party this November 2nd!!!

BP to follow *****  Seismic  *******
      ******* Something Kind For the Mind *****
Straight off the flyer-
          November 2nd
Djs-
Thomas Michael (LA)           805.639.3953
Radley Marx (SF)             atmosphere of ease and relaxation by Sputnik
Kimo (SJ)                    Tribal Drummers        Body Painting
Spark-E (SLO)                  Free Sm:)es and candy

If your down in the area please come out and support or if your not 
planning on doing anything come on down and you can crash with me or my 
friends.

Hope everythings great at home.  I'll be up this weekend and am 
planning on going to the Full Moon at Mission Rock and Sunset maybe 
even FTT. 

Well, back to Diff EQ! Yeah-

PLUR

i saw josh wink in LA at -Futurama- (with a name like that, how could you 
lose ?! :P.. ) and i was really disappointed. I liked tracks he's done in 
the past but I didn't think he sounded that great in person. I expected 
something to really drive me, but... 
Oh well. Maybe checking him out for yourselves would be good; it's just

Although I haven't *bitched* about a massive yet, I resent being told not
to.  I am one of those people who think massives generally suck.  I won't
go into the sordid details, but I'd rather stay home and, uh, pick my nose
before I patronize most massives.  Yeah, a party is what you make it, but
then again some people aren't very choosy.  So, you like massives.  I
don't.  Bitch? Certainly I will if I feel passionately about something.
I usually don't get into the massive attack, but this time it was worth
wasting the time at my computer.

Over and Out,

KaySEE

And this may be an important point:

For $25 I expect to be entertained.

For $5 or $10 I will entertain myself.

Been there many times.  It's basically an old marina tavern/hangout that's
been used for years by the club side of the house music scene.  There
are two floors and an outside deck.  It's kind of a funky picturesque
place, definitely a dockside deal, no downtown flashiness.  I can't
say I've ever had a great time there but it's always enjoyable.  

Do be careful where you park.  Also, I've heard some reports of smashed
windows and so on in the vicinity.

One of my sources indicates that Mission Rock
has an uncertain future due to various legal disputes with the Port --
not that they've done anything wrong, more like the same old bureaucratic
hassles.  So check it out before it's history (or even if it doesn't 
vanish :)

Dear Friends & Family,

=09I remember a number of you before the last election were quite
enthused about voting for Willie Brown, and how he was going to make the
city a better place for ravers.  I still don't believe it, but I'd love to
be proved wrong.
=09This is an excellent chance to find out what the man's colors are.
If Brown cares about human rights, he will use his considerable political
clout to nail this creep Haggett and see that he never wears a badge in
this town again.
=09Give "Da Mayor" a call at 554-6600.

>=20

>      approached him at midnight outside the Diamond
>      Heights Safeway and asked to look in the duffel

>=20
>      ``At first, I thought he was psychotic -- the way he
>      slammed me against his car and hit me with his
>      pistol and pointed it at my face,'' said Tahsini.
>      Tahsini later testified that Haggett told him, ``I'm
>      not in the mood for this s--.''
>=20
>      The 150-pound Tahsini found himself lying on his
>      back with his hands handcuffed underneath him. At
>      that point, ``He (Haggett) stepped on my throat as

>=20
>      All charges against Tahsini, including resisting arrest
>      and assaulting an officer, were subsequently

>      this case.
>=20
>      At the end of the police commission hearing on

>=20
>      Police Commission President Lou Giraudo was

>=20

>=20

Hi everyone,
This is in reference to the postings regarding our last big party in May 
(2049:The Dune Kings). We realized that the missing 2nd sound system at our 
party dissapointed many. In particular it caused great distress to us because 
we knew we had let everyone down. I have reprinted (with permission) a public 
apology that appeared in last month's issue of XL8LR magazine from my partner, 
Kevon Banks, regarding what transpired that night. 
Our overriding mission in the 4 years that we've been in existence has always 
been to provide the best music and the best production at a reasonable price. 
We realize that not everyone can afford to pay the $25 charged at our larger 
parties, which is why we have always thrown free parties. To make up for the 
Dune Kings party, we threw the free afternoon LTJ Bukem gig infront of City 
Hall, followed later in the evening with another free gig at Mission Rock. A 
couple of Sundays ago, we also did the 'Organic in the Park'. Many shun 
massives for various valid reasons. FTT hopes that our Halloween Tribal 
Massive this coming Saturday would maybe change their minds. 
We have gone through great lengths to get the best DJs in their respective 
genres. DJ Rap, Nightmares on Wax, Wamdue Kids, Josh Wink and Springheel Jack 
are some of the artists that we are flying out just for this occasion. 
Springheel Jack (my favouriite) will be performing a full live drum and bass 
set. The Quango Music Group crew (Jason Bentley, Bruno Guez, Jun) will also be 
doing their down tempo thing that Quango is well regarded for. We feel that 
musically, Saturday night will be one of eclectic quality. As for your typical 
massive crowd and 'massive' lines, we are going out of our way to keep it to a 
minimal. 
As for the $25 we are charging for the party, we felt it was fair when the 
costs of the space, 4 sound systems, flying the artists here (most from the 
UK) and putting them up in hotels, etc were taken into consideration. The fact 
that there is also a major national surgeon's convention (which jacked up 
hotel prices 3-fold!) in town this weekend did not help our budget.
In closing, I'd like to thank everyone who voiced their opinions about our 
parties, and if you still feel dissatisfied with this lengthy response, feel 
free to email me at this address. The response from Kevon is below.  We 
guarantee you'll have a good time this Saturday. Take care, drive safely and 
see you at the party!!!

Funky Tekno Tribe

"The producers of Funky Tekno Tribe would like to apologize to you, and to 
everyone who attended 2049:The Dune Kings event for the absence of the second 
sound system. It is not our intention to advertise an artist or any aspect of 
our shows that will not appear. Although we have been producing events in the 
SF/Bay Area for many years, unfortunately chaos ruled that Saturday May 25th. 
Artist cancellations, power limitations, miscommunications and equipment 
failure seemed to plague this particular event, culminating in what we feel 
was not a typical Funky Tekno Tribe production. Even with all of the mishaps 
that occurred during pre-production no one's sorrow could have matched my own. 
By the time we finally opened, only half of the second sound system had showed 
up.  I hurried back to San Francisco and immediately began calling everyone I 
knew with a sound system.  After several unsuccessful attempts I finally made 
my way back to the warehouse feeling tired and a bit let down. As always the 
music and the crowds energy replenished my spirits and what I felt would be a 
disappointment turned out to be a memorable experience.  In closing Denise, we 
would like you to know that perhaps no one takes their job more personal than 
us.  We feel that it is our responsibility to create an enjoyable dance 
experience for all who attend our events and your disappointment is ours.  By 
the time you read this Denise, the free make-up party will have been scheduled 
and you will be happy to know Darkhorse will be performing. I might also 
suggest attending our annual Halloween Tribal Massive as I can assure you 
maximum time and effort will be expended with hopes of making this year's 
event the best ever.  If anyone would like to contact us for questions or 
comments please e-mail us at Funkytekno@msn.com or write to: Funky Tekno 
tribe, 1388 Haight St. Suite 57, San Francisco CA 94117

	Is Housewares really sold out of tix? If so, where can I buy tix? 
Everyone is saying Primal records, but I'm not sure where that is, could 
someone help with directions.
	Plus, if presale tix are sold out does that mean they won't be 
selling tix at the doors?

thanx,
ethan

Guitar Center in El Cerrito is the cheapest place to get new ones that I've
seen.  $449 each.

I have the same problem. Some of my friends want to go to this party, but
my friend who drives is under 21. He doesn't drink and drive, but he'll
dancE his ass off at a full moon party if he gets in.

Bonghitter!

I'm coming down for this massive.  Myself and three  friends are cramming 
into my tiny Chevy Sprint for the long haul 5hr drive in the rain down 
Highway 101.  What an adventure!  I couldn't manage a way to buy presales 
over the phone with my credit card, so I hope they still have tix left 
around 10 when we'll arrive.  I hope I get to meet at least a few 
SFRaverswhile I'm down there.  I'll give a description on friday.  =)

Hello everyone,

I'd like to post this because... well, because I can.  I

Allthough Im just a DJ, not a promoter or anything, I feel that we're
all sorta missing the concept of "Rave" and "Massive" .  People say, " I
don't go to massives anymore " and I think that's good, it's
progressive.  Our culture are intoduced into the scene by two ways, 
either through friends or massives.  Only those that are "in" hear of
the Sunsets, Friends and Family, F-8, FMR, CCC ect al... Thus it's a
smaller circle (ie. 500-600) that knows of such events.  To be brought
into via friends is great, but, not everybody can come in through this
path...  
The next path is the massive, it's how I was introduced and several of
you out there have posted fond memories of your early rave experiences
through massives...  I go to massives only once a year and try to keep
it varied: Gathering in 95', Cool World in 94', Toon Town (I think) in
93' @ the cow palace, Casper (and Labrayth) in 92'. 91 and 90 were my
years of introduction of the scene so I was constantly going to massives
(it was my only connection to the scene @ the time, and I got in free
most of the time too :) 
The reason I keep on going once a year is to see the "newbies"  and
reaffirm that our vibe is still alive.  
Yea, there are "heads and hoods" but even they can change... It's about
acceptance.  
	And time.  
		And patience.
But, we're in the scene for different reasons wiether it be drugs, sex,
good times, expression, or waking people up...
I love my family and all you belong here, I don't really associate with
you outside of the list mainly because, in a way, many of you are on the
right path.  I focus moreso on those that are looking.  And I know some
are looking @ Massives.  I was.

     Food for Thought:
     
     Maybe next time some of the advertised entertainment doesn't come 
     through, let people know at the door, and consider cutting the cost of 
     admission accordingly.  All of the people who I heard were pissed 
     about it were pissed because they didn't know till after they paid.  
     
     Sometimes people would have stayed home if it wasn't for that one 
     obscure DJ that they've always wanted to see.  That DJ may be just 
     another DJ to you, but it's what made the $25 expense tolerable to the 
     person who went.
     
     Disneyland posts right at the front gate when a particular ride 
     doesn't work.  You might want to consider following suit.
     
     Peace,

Ok, groovy people.  I'm looking for a definition to the phrase:

Anyone know what this means?  High stakes at hand.

Apologies for posting this here instead of to the not yet operational job
board on Hyperreal(shame on me...) 

My company (East Bay ISP) is looking for a person to do Web page design
for ourselves and our clients.  If you want to know how bad we need
someone, take a look at our current Web page (www.value.net). ;-)

If interested please e-mail me, and point me to some of your work.
 
Thanks

I don't know the name of the song but this part came from the movie
Brazil by Terry Gilliam of Monty Python....I think the movie came
out in the 80's. It's an excellent movie with a twisted sense of humor 
and an Orwellian 1984 nightmarish plot. 

Sorry that I couldn't help ya out more but I've found that every 
little bit of info on an unknown song can help...Goodluck!

And if any of you SFRavers who live in San Diego ARE coming up to FFT,
My friend in SF Area could really use a ride to San Diego if anyone has an extra

While we're on the subject of obscure songs, someone at Hallucination
back in August was playing a song that contained the words "I wish we 
could grow our arms and legs a little longer" (or something like that). 
It sounded so great in the context of a packed room full of insane ravers! 
Anyone know what song that is?

There was also another song which said something like "We are witnessing 
an incredible phenomenon" that I'd also be interested in tracking down.

Trivia time, kids!

Non-rave related.  Used to signify topics that are not directly rave 
related.  Some members of our illustrious list have expressed extreme 
displeasure at receiving posts that did not have to do with raving, so this

Out of curiousity, I'd like to know how this is possible when the Tribal
Massive is advertised on Live 105?  In the add they say it will be "the
Bay Area's foremost underground experience."  How can something that is
advertised on the biggest commercial radio station in the Bay Area be
called "underground."  Might that not be a misnomer?  But, that's what
marketing is about--using "cool" buzzwords to perpetuate an attitude of
"coolness" so we will all want to buy, buy, buy to conform to an image.

Anyway, this may sound more caustic than I actually mean to be.  Massives
certainly have a clientele that they cater to, and I have no disrespect
for that.  I'm sure the music will be excellent and the party will go off
and tons of people will have a blast.  I've had fun at massives
before, and I'm sure FTT will be a good party for many.  However,
advertising on Live 105 will not keep "the typical massive crowd" to a
minimum.  If anything it perpetuates the "gimme" spectator attitude.  This
happens to be something that, IMO, subtracts from a good vibe.  

Thanks,
Kirsten

sounds to me like people have pretty good reason to bitch at all the crazy
shit that goes on... esp. Shawna's post and others'. I'm all for giving big
parties a chance but when too many friends get too jacked by
promoters/"party"goers/etc., I tend to "take a hint." Also, they're just
telling us what happenned so we don't repeat their mistakes. That's not
"bitching," that's "polite."

Sherry you have too much faith!!! =)))

On the other hand, I might actually end up at FTT this weekend if FnF
doesn't happen, but my heart will be with Ethan and the rest of the Friends
and Family kids.

I don't recall these being publicised on SF Raves, and personally, I am
very sad to have missed LTJ Bukem. Any chance you could inform SFRaves
of these outdoor/free gigs?

I am so F'in stoned right now. You don't even know.


I will defonetly date a Funky chick.
I might see a Stinky chick. (for awhile)
But a Stinky Funky chick. Not gonna do it.


       Anyone reading this, ever think about throwing a ravE?
       Do you want to throw one for the money? Or for the people?


If you want to throw a bigger party for the people. 
Your going to need more money from the people.


If you wanna spend your whole life making parties.
And if you want to spend your whole life broke/bankrupt.

Thats all fine and dandy but. Some people have to make a living.
Just think of the money you spend as if it were your half of the price it
took to get you, and your friends, and everyone else together.

We can't expect these people to just dish out all there money, and except
our thanx.
   I don't have the time to get my own 100,000 square foot harehouse, 30
Dj's from around the world, a huge fat sound system with visual
inneractivity. Just so all of us can be together. "I need to make money!"

Sh!t   My buzz is wearing off... 
I need to find something alittle more interactive quick like.

Later skaters.
Peace out scouts.
Jeff

Subject: FTT - another Nation???
Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com

        I heard from few sources that FTT is being announced on LIVE 105
and tickets are being sold at BASS.

        WHY????  Didn't promoters learn that such a big ads lead to a
busted party?  That happened to "Nation" after their entire page ad.  Is
same thing going to happen to FTT?  It would really suck, because although
I wasn't too crazy about their last party, I am willing to go again and see
how it goes (I haven't heard Dan in a long time).  I have a lot of friends
that are drive/flying from LA/Seattle, and it would really suck if the
party got busted.

        Anybody has more info on this?  What are the chances it will get
broken up?  Why is in necessary to advertise on LIVE105, when there will be
ton of ppl from all over West Coast?

Looking for answers,
*B*

Hi all- I've been trying to convince my SO about the wonders 
of techno music, and he just refuses to give it much of a chance.  
Unfortunately I don't have any good music to prove my point with, I know 
what I like when I hear it, but I don't know anything about it.
 
I know that if I found the right stuff he would love it....He's really into 
rap, especially Tribe, diggable planets- stuff with a good groove to it..- 
and he loves funk- so I need to find some tapes that will pull
 in some of those elements.. He loves a good beat and goes crazy for a 
thumping base, so once I get our stereo system pumping and the walls 
shaking  I know he will be in the kitchen dancing in his socks with me.

thanks ahead of time!
-jess


p.s. One last question- Halloween is Thursday and after a little bit of a 
dry spell, I'm going to get out and party...so, where is everybody going 
to be?

A few people have informed me that this event was advertised on SFR. I
guess I must have been out of town, busy, or otherwise indisposed
because I never found out about them. Sorry for the misunderstanding.

Thank you for making these events public and possible! Please 
continue doing so in the future. Spread the music!

One reason I don't filter my mail.

Hi-

 I was listening to Live 105 last night and they played the new Tori Amos/BT 
song "Blue Skys".  Has anyone else heard it, and if so do you know where I 
could possibly get this on vinyl.  The release date is supposed to be sometime 
in November, but I know it's been getting some major play over in the UK.

-Thanks, Todd

	massive in SF and was with only 2 of my friends.  Just recently,
	I have entered the "family" raves.

        By reading this list some people would think that people on the
list are the most sex deprived individuals ;P...

RELAX :) and don't take everything so seriously...

Some people like massives, some people like small parties....
Some people like hugz and sticker, some people get annoyed by them....
Some people like to dress up and pay lost of $$ for designer clothes,
others like used stores clothes....

        Can you imagine how *boring* it would be if all of us were exactly
alike?  Just think about it and don't hit that reply so soon.  We are here
to learn from each other and learn how to respect each other's opinion.  If
*we* (who claim are so concentrated on PLUR) can't do it, how can we expect
other people in the world to do it and make this a pleasant place to live.

Just my thoughts :) (I guess I really don't feel like working today)
*B*

That's not true. It's in the 1963 unabridged websters dictionary accessed
by tools like xwebster(1) or webster(1):

This is how I understand it.  They stopped selling pre-sale tickets on
Oct 20.  They will be selling tickets at the door but they will be $25 
instead of $20.  They said something about pre-sale tickets having 
door priority.  I assume that means if you don't have one you will have to
wait in 2 lines OR those that have pre-sale tickets get their own line.  
Something like that.  I don't know about BASS. Its not mentioned
on their VM or on their webpage.

HI,
	OK. the flyer says pre-tix will be sold 'til Oct 20. Than after
at the door for $25 instead of $20. Not a word of tix being sold at
BASS,which I belive. 
	OK. I had planned on meeting some of you SFravers at past events
but I had never made it. I will be going to FTT. I remember reading an    article about Josh Wink (The"Don't Laugh" man himself), and it was totallypositive and inspiring (I've gotta see/hear/meet him live).
	OK. I'm a six foot Latino, just shaved my head balled, look a
little bit like a gangsta but hate the life style, will be wearing 
Carhart tan overalls. Please come up and say HI. I would love to associatefaces with all the posts and so forth.
					PEACE

     Yeap- I heard the same thing as well as seeing big posters up all
over DVC today. If this doesn't show how commercial this all is than I
don't know what could!

      I would hope that *any* party that occurs, massive or not, does not
get busted. But if the rumors are true, than it may not look too
promising. All I can say is : have fun!

Ok, I should know better, but I'll try anyway...

There's this track on a Keoki tape I've got that has a segment that sounds 
like a chorus of Japanese kids singing.  I LOVE IT!  It just has this 
totally happy sound.  Unfortunately whatever record he was mixing with had 
this horrible scratch in it and I end up having to crank down the bass to 
keep from blowing my speakers from this >>RIP-POW<< sound.  

I would love to know where it comes from, what LP/CD, that sort of thing.  
Many good karma points await the person with info or even the actual music.

Yea, but imagine if they advertised on Wild 107 instead. <shudder>

Hello all,
	Does anyone have any info on Lunarseed this Friday (w/Goa Gil)? I
seem to remember the original post saying tickets were going to be presale,
and I can't find the phone #.  Also, I haven't heard anything since the
original post about a week ago...

Please help!!

thanks a lot :)

        Actually it's ADAM, not ATAM. There's also and EVE drug somewhere. I
think E is shit because it covers up all reality with a pretty puffy soft
little blanket. I have a theory on the drugs I've tried, but no need to
waste time explaining it to whoever, private mail me if you're curious, I
love explaining things.

        I don't think you can MAKE people dance. I have the same problem
with my friends. I think you have to keep just dragging them along, then
some time, the music will just get into them, and they'll get up and boogie.

That would be the ethyl-derivative of MDMA, i.e. MDEA

So? As long as you are aware of that I don't see the problem.
There are few evil recreational drugs, but there are many evil ways
to use them. It's the people, not the drugs. Perhaps I should make a
sig out of this, I keep repeating it on the list. And by the way,
people don't need drugs to cover up reality with pretty puffy soft
blankets, there are enough people in perfect denial of their actual
situation without the use of chemicals.

I too was introduced through MASSIVES..and i still like to go to them every
once in a while.  I don't see anything wrong with the size of the event if
it has something to offer that i want. i.e. a dj i can't otherwise see, cool
visuals, to meet some people that don't normally go to "small" parties, etc.
etc.

I also have fond memories of most of the massives that i've gone too.  I
really have had very few bad experiences at massives.  Some of my FAVORITE
parties have been massives, ie all the freedoms, gatherings and candyland at
the drive in movie complex.  I too have really gotten into the smaller party
scene..but i don't particularly have anything against the
massives...well...against most anyways...there are some promoters' (who
shall remain nameless) parties that i won't go to.

How is everybody doing??????

I also want to know who is going to go to the BBQ 3.  Looks like it'll be
FUN and we'll all finally get to meet.

AND...finally.....
I am getting REALLY psyched for the snow thing...i LOVE tahoe, cabins, the
snow, music, snuggling up to warm fires, tearing it up...etc. etc.
OH, and i can offer my dj'ing services for...well...a hug or two or ten. :P
I also have some equipment that i might be bribed into taking up.

much PLUR

Introduce him to some kick ass jungle, breakbeat, and acid jazz!! There

Hey.....My first party was a Massive too...the Let Freedom Rave..July 94...
A fire breaks out on the hillside...Lasers everywhere...and the biggest,
loudest, baddest collection of speakers I had ever seen in one
place..Simon,Josh,Doc Martin, GArth....A Gagzillion WAtts of
power...thump,thump humpin together...the bass lines take over my
heartbeats...clods of earth turn into powder under my feet..

....For me,  Massives are what some of the most ass-kickin' music was
designed to be played on...Big.Bass lines that shake the ground and
vibrations that run down and through and including your pubic hairs...let me
feel those speaker winds blown out by cone forces..I wanna sit on the
speaker cabinets for another butt shakin......

..In front of  BIG BLACK BASS bins...all lined up in a row.(such a pretty
sight).and the hum hum of generators and little blinky lights everywhere...

..I'm dancin all night and I feel like I'm in the Startrek transporter room
getting ready to be beamed up,( I didn't know where)...the sound...the sound
takes me apart atom by atom,...uh,.....I've got myself droolin'.....

Did i say I like it LOUD??????????????Turn it Up..             SpinSilver

Hi all,
back from another of my "need to catch up" haituses (sp?) I miss everyone and
hope you missed me, even if only a little itty bitty bit! I've got/had a new
address(s), I know this is as confusing as it seems, but

i AM back at @ STEVEOSAC@AOL.COM
i am NOT at I.and.eye@att.worldnet.net

i may APPEAR to be from steveoberk@aol.com, but its an illusion, and i MIGHT
NOT get a message if you mail me there.

Faux paux as it may be, setting up a seperate list mail box, which I may not
always read,is the only way I can remain on sfr and keep up with work &
school.

Love love love,
StEvEo

P.S.  The other option would have been to out send an array of posts about
bandwidth conservation.

That was my second.  My most recent massive was the Gathering last winter
(the one with Alex Patterson in the DJ lineup).  Both excellent parties.
There seems to be a pattern here.
Props and other assorted kudos to Martin!

And more props, hugs, and kudos to Brian B, et al, for this list,
which makes it possible for us to find a lot of the smaller parties too.

Harmony 3 may have had enough people to qualify as a massive,
but it sure didn't feel like one, so I don't think any of us are counting it
in this discussion.  Anyone who can put on a party like that has truely
mastered the art of putting on raves.  Lotsa hugs to all @ Harmony!

  First I'd like to thank all the DJ's on the list for showing interest and
wanting to spin. I just wish I could have all of you spin.


BBQ & BEATS III will be happening Nov 16th from 12noon - 9pm. Info:
415-974-4357. The lineup will be

Alex(Soto),  Noah Ruiz,  Micron,  BioJeff,  Tom,  Mystr-E

As always there will be food provided, however I do encourage you to bring
food to share. Maybe you have a favorite dish you want to bring. If you
want to bring your own food to BBQ that will be great to, there's plenty of
room on the BBQ for that. There will be your typical BBQ items plus veggie
items as well. Your also encouraged to bring drinks either for yourself or
to share.

If you would like to help out or want to bring something, send me some
email and let me know.  Also, if I'm not mistaken there will be tickets for
"A Wrinkle in Time" available at the BBQ. I'll double check that and update
you.

As soon as I find out who all is interested, I'll be setting up a meeting.
So until then..


Take care,

Tim (knucklehead)

Some of you may remember Phelps from over the summer on the list....and

Hear me, mark me, learn me, throw the mind's ear open. Shut up the
mind's eye, all will be music. What sculpture of sound cannot, what

hello all-

it's thursday, so matt is organizing the southpark lunch, a group of
haphazard ravers and their intellectual property/co-workers who meet to eat,
drink, and be merry.

today's lunch will be (pardon my instructions, i forgot the cafe name)
        in the southpark circle (between 2nd and 3rd) on the north side of
the street, is a yellow little trendy coffee shop filled with geeks and the
like.  it is about halfway between 2nd and 3rd on the corner of a block.

i will be there about 11:45 to beat the noon rush and enjoy my lunch.
anyone wishing to join me, natasha, and boris (you'll meet them when you get
there) is heartily invited to come.  e-mail me with confirmations!

i hope to see many of you there!  the last one was fun, with another raver
from my building and some other fun techno/raver types!

love-

matt

I've found a good introductory (accessible) CD for this stuff is
"Funky Desert Breaks" put out by the Moontribe folks in LA. It's
turned several people I know on to the music. It's pretty easy to
find.

i put drugs in two categories

pleasure-producing, habit forming and body harming
	class 1 - harmful if abused over a long period of time
		alcohol, tobacco, pot
	class 2 - use only in moderation - damages brain, etc.
		ecstacy, speed, cocaine
	class 3 - extremely habit forming & damaging - avoid
		opiates

psychedelics
	use in moderation.  bad trips & longterm use can cause psychological
	problems.

the problem is, how do you tell a high school kid, "use in moderation?"
i think that kids should stay away from the harder stuff until college.

Hi all! =)

 Well, I havn't done this in a while so I don't feel too bad ;)

It looks like I will be assisting the FnF party and could use a ride for 
myself and a _little_ equipment. Individual must commit to ride there 
AND back. Covered truck or van prefered (it may rain) Please write me 
privately if interested. I'm voluntering my time and equipment so the same 
is expected from the driver.
Thanks!!

"Let me have silence always in the centre of the shouting, that is
essential. Let me have silence so that no pin may drop and not be
heard, and not a whisper. Escape us for all our spouting, nor the
needle scratching upon this gramophone of the circular cosmic spot.
Hear me, mark me, learn me, throw the mind's ear open. Shut up the
mind's eye, all will be music. What sculpture of sound cannot, what
cannot as a fluid token words, that nothing else cannot."

Ah, I wish I could go see Rap again.  She was amazing when I last saw
her in Boston -- just hope there's more of a jungle following up in SF
than there was in Boston.  I'm sure SS will tear it up also -- wow, what
a combination!  Hey, why doncha try and talk em into heading down to
socal afterwards and doing an impromptu gig somewhere.

You didn't miss anything, becuase nothing has been determined/announced yet.

You'll know when we know, if there's anything TO know.  Ya know?

Cue for awful joke....

Bill Gates, Andy Grove, and Jerry Sanders are in a high-powered
business meeting.  During the serious, tense discussions, a  beeping
noise suddenly is emitted from where Bill is sitting.  Bill says, "Oh, 
that's  my _emergency_ beeper.  Gentlemen, excuse me, I really need to 
take this call."  
 
So Bill lifts his wristwatch to his ear and begins  talking into the end 
of his tie. After completing this call, he notices the others are staring 
at him. Bill explains, "Oh, this is my new emergency communication
system. I have an  earpiece built into my watch and a microphone
sewn into the end of my tie. That way, I can a take a call anywhere."
The others nod, and the meeting continues.  
 
Five minutes later, the discussion is again interrupted when Andy starts
beeping. He also states, "Oh, that's my emergency beeper.  Excuse me, 
gentlemen, this must be an important call."  So Andy taps his earlobe
and begins talking into thin air. When he completes his call, he notices
the others staring at him and explains,  "I also have an emergency
communication system. But my earpiece is actually implanted in my
earlobe, and the microphone is embedded in this fake tooth. Isn't that
neat?" The others nod, and the meeting continues.   
 
Five minutes later, the discussion is again interrupted when Jerry emits
a thunderous fart.  He looks up at the others staring at him and says, 
"Uhh, somebody get me a piece of paper... I'm receiving a fax."

Actually, I just called Guitar Center. They have a "sale" right now on new
1200s: $499.00. 

The price of new 1200s has gone up pretty dramatically accross the country
since the summer. The best price I've found is from Radar City in New York
(currently $475, I think, check out their web page). Other than that,
Fry's (shudder) lists for $599, but will match any local price, so you
could get them to go at least as low as $499 (using Guitar Center's price)

While going through Sega of Japan's Web site, I came across info on
their many VR Theme Parks. It's great reading and really got my mind
spinning with new ideas for parties (which is my favorate Daydreaming
Pastime). (NOTE! Some of the VR stuff they have is TOTALY cutting edge.
My stuff dosn't hold a candle to it.)
Example: Check out the "Theme Story" for OSAKA GALBO. Does it somehow
ring a familar bell inside you as it did with me?
----
          -->OSAKA GALBO<--
Genius Inventor "Dr. Kurono" 
"Destruction of Time"--that's the aim of Dr. Kurono who has a secret
laboratory in Shin-Yamashita. He's been struggling through one
experiment after another, just to give an astonishing impact to those
who, ruled by the "current of time", will never question the way they
spend days in the same old "space". And he has finally succeeded in
developing an energy generator beyond our imagination, and tries it out
at ATC, OSAKA MINAMI PORT. Then, the facility grows increasingly bigger
in an instant, so that it causes time and space to be cracked and
warped. The Time Keepers rush to the spot to find that young people are
sparkling their "minds" with vivid expression and bright laughter. An
entirely new form of communication has emerged. 

At a time when the new century is drawing near, a brand-new space
"GALBO" has been created at ATC, OSAKA MINAMI PORT. "GALBO" is an
utterly new world in a different dimension that one genius inventor
created.

If you're lucky enough to be in Oregon anytime soon, you might want to try out 
Platinum Records in Portland.  I bought my 1200's about 9 months ago and they 
were $425.  Here's the kicker, there is NO sales tax in Oregon.

        Ok, so, please, everyone, whoever has an opinion. . . EXPRESS IT! I
don't want to be the only DORK who thinks that he knows something.

Well, I'm a big thinker. In a past life I was probably a wise man or an
intellectual. I'm constantly thinking of everything that happens to me, or
that goes on in my life.
I don'tt think that I've always been this way, damn, I can recall many many
times where people would tell me to "Think before you act". Now, that's kind
of my rule (actually I can't help it). I like the way I've turned out, and I
owe a lot of it to certain diffirent keys to our conciousness (drugs, but I
don't really call em that).

        Many of you might be more qualified than me to speak of this, but I
did have pschology classes in school, have read a few books on diffirent
drugs, thoroughly searched through drug archives on the web, and have read
any article I could possibly get my hands on. Does that make me qualified?
The chemicals I've experienced are just few, but I've only tried the ones
that I felt I could gain knowledge from, and a couple just to get fuc***
when I was young and stupid. Mushrooms, Acid, MDMA, Alcohol, Marijuana,
Crank, Crack, That stuff from the Robitussin DM, Speed, GHB, and probably
some other stuff. But I'm still looking to try a couple things (just to
expand my knowledge).

        Most drugs are basically useless. These drugs rarely give anything
to you. They just fuc* you up, speed you up, or just make you feel funky
without teaching you anything or giving you asny type of benefit at all. I'd
put Crack, Robitussin, Alcohol, GHB, Speed, Crank, and similar drugs like
Nicotene in this catagory.

        My theory is that diffirent drugs open your mind up to a diffirent
level of conciousness. I think that certain aspects of drugs put you in a
state that makes you think or act a certain way. And most of these drugs,
after you've already come down, leave you with the knowledge of a new way of
thinking or acting. Let me explain.

Marijuana:
         Marijuana is basically just a recreational drug. But to those who
are open to what it does to you, you've probably noticed how it makes you
think when you're loaded. It makes you kind of analytical in a sense. It
makes you think more about people and what they do. Eg: If you and a few
people smoke a couple, when you're all stoned, you'll probably notice things
about these people that you wouldn't normally see, such as certain words
they say over and over, or if that person is a little weird, it accentuates
their strangeness and makes it more aparrent to you. Usually I'll watch a
person and study them, trying to look at the person behind all of the facial
hair, or piercings, or clothes. It makes me think sooo much about people
that I usually am able to seperate the people I really like from the ones
that I don't like too much. It makes me think about how stupid my girlfriend
acts sometimes. I think it brings out peoples annoying traits and makes them
more noticable.

Mushrooms:
        Whoa. . .now mushrooms opened up such a diffirent world to me, it's
impossible to explain exactly what the world is like unless that person is
there with you (y'Know). Mushrooms make you think more about your life, your
religion, your place in this world. I think that's why the native americans
used mushrooms in spiritual rituals. I made me realize everyone's
importance, or lack thereof. It told me who I was, who my friends were, and
who would be with me forever. I guess I could explain it as  being all
knowing, open to the world, and you could solve any problem with just a
couple words. When I ate them with my friends, every person had a charater
about them, and that's who they were from there on. Like, if someone was in
denial or whatever, that's all they would be stuck on, they couldn't get
away from their problems, and all of us others who ate knew it. The
mushrooms put you on a mission, you could travel forever without being
tired, you knew who to bring with you and who to not. And all of my friends
changed after the experience. I think that mushrooms put you on a religious
journey, finding yourself, your friends, and where you're going.

LSD:
        I guess I've had a few diffirent types of acid (or diffirent
strengths). Acid makes you innovative, productive, and kind of like an
inventor always coming up with a new idea  to make something better. It put
you in a diffirent world of thinking. It doesn't vring up new problems, but
it helps you repair existing ones. I've thought the most clearly on Acid,
and it's tought me how to think quickly, and solve problems easily. It makes
you smarter (without abuse), and helps teach you how to think. It brings out
the finest detail in anything, and makes you aware of that. It shows you
things how they really are, makes you realize how things are, and makes you
think about why they are. You'll probably say that "Then why does stuff
melt, and why is everything all so ugly". I guess I really don't have an
answer to that, but everything in the world, no matter how safe, has it's
side effects. It also opens up your creative side, allowing you to talk for
hours on end about a pencil (or whatever), or draw forever. It helps you
express yourself in a way you couldn't before, and it leaves what you've
learned with you after your experience.

MDMA:
        I don't like E too much. I'm usually frying when I see people on E
and it makes me think of how fake it makes you. The only good quality about
E is that it makes you very positive, it makes you love your lover even
more, it makes you sorry for every bad thing you've ever done, it makes you
happy to be who you are without any need for any type of change. These are
good things, but, I think that it covers up the reality of everything with a
soft pretty little blanket. It makes ugly people beautiful, it makes dirty
ass wherehouses the best place in the world, it makes people think that
they're a STAR in the biggest show on earth. I watched this girl intently
once, her name was Jenny, she was really nice n all, but she would go,
dance, then come back and act like the whole world was watching her, like
she was picturing roses flying up on stage, people kissing her telling "Good
show", it misled her into thinking that the Deli (upstairs) was this big
happy cloud in which everyone was kissing and hugging and there wasn't a
problem in the world. I guess that could be cool, but I just think that it's
too fake. I know most of us SFRAVERS E fairly often. Shit, thats where we
get most of our ideas of loving one another and all. But It just makes the
world too unreal, and doesn't teach you anything to deal with the real world
logically. But it can strengthen the love between people, and teach you to
be more compassionate towards others. I've eaten E many times (around 25 or
so) which in reality isn't much, I just don't like how it covers things up.
But I'm not saying that it's bad.


Others:
        I think that all other drugs like Alcohol are prettymuch useless. I
think that Alcohol is a seriously negative drug made to destroy families,
friends, and lives. Crank and Speed just make you get a lot done. Crack
tweaks you to the point to all you care about is you, and is just slightly
better than alcohol. And all that other stupid shit just gets you out of the
world for a certai amount of time and is completely useless and just a
destruction of perfectly good people.

        Again, this is just my personal thoughts on these things. You all
may have diffirent experiences because you're diffirent people, but when
I've talked to my friends, the ideas on the subjects stayed pretty
consistent. So tell me what you think. It's a big world and everyone can
think, so there's no reason to not be able to speak out.

        But without drugs, I wouldn't be as compassionate, thoughtful,
creative, innovative, or wise as I am now. Shit, when I didn't do drugs in
high school, I was an idiot, now I get straight A's in college.

Love ya all (and I'm perfectly sober) 
But even though drugs expand your mind, it doesn't mean that they're good
for you!

logically. But it can strengthen the love between people, and teach you to
be more compassionate towards others. I've eaten E many times (around 25 or
so) which in reality isn't much, I just don't like how it covers things up.
But I'm not saying that it's bad.


Others:
        I think that all other drugs like Alcohol are prettymuch useless. I
think that Alcohol is a seriously negative drug made to destroy families,
friends, and lives. Crank and Speed just make you get a lot done. Crack
tweaks you to the point to all you care about is you, and is just slightly
better than alcohol. And all that other stupid shit just gets you out of the
world for a certai amount of time and is completely useless and just a
destruction of perfectly good people.

        Again, this is just my personal thoughts on these things. You all
may have diffirent experiences because you're diffirent people, but when
I've talked to my friends, the ideas on the subjects stayed pretty
consistent. So tell me what you think. It's a big world and everyone can
think, so there's no reason to not be able to speak out.

        But without drugs, I wouldn't be as compassionate, thoughtful,
creative, innovative, or wise as I am now. Shit, when I didn't do drugs in
high school, I was an idiot, now I get straight A's in college.

Love ya all (and I'm perfectly sober) 
But even though drugs expand your mind, it doesn't mean that they're good
for you!

Been waitin for the details for this one, and I finally got them.

SAMHAIN 
(prounced Sow'en) (the Celtic Winter Solstice).  

This event will take place 1/2 hour outside Yosemite National Park on
November 2-3.  It will go from 2 pm Saturday through sunset on Sunday.
There will be Trance, Psychedelic Trance and Goa in a sound proof wearhouse,
and ambient/triphop/slow jungle/live music in an outdoor ampatheater.  The
location for the event is a hostile and the promotors have rented the entire
space.  There will be 80 beds available on a first come first serve basis,
and plenty of space for camping so bring tents and sleeping bags if you
got-um.  The owner of the site has required the promotors to rent the whole
space, and is limiting the attendance to 250 people.  Therefore the cost of
the party will be $25.  (They have found no way around this due to the cost
of the site and limit on the attendance, I do know they aren't making any
money off it)  Tickets are available at F8.  There will also be a chakra
expansion, light work ritual at sunrise on Sunday.   I am told that the site
of the event is incredibly beautiful. So:

Trance, Psychedelic Trance, Goa DJ's:

Adam (Ceiba Records)
Anon (Hunab ku)
Dutch (Inner Eye)
Ivo
Max Factor (Shyantra)
Jeremy Starseed

Ambient/idm/slow jungle/live:

Consciousness Lab Ambient Sound Research
RE: (performing live)
Felix the Cat (Black Diamand)

Todd (A.D.S.R.)

Lighting/Visuals: Astral Scapes

"Let me have silence always in the centre of the shouting, that is
essential. Let me have silence so that no pin may drop and not be
heard, and not a whisper. Escape us for all our spouting, nor the
needle scratching upon this gramophone of the circular cosmic spot.
Hear me, mark me, learn me, throw the mind's ear open. Shut up the
mind's eye, all will be music. What sculpture of sound cannot, what
cannot as a fluid token words, that nothing else cannot."

I Picked up the Nov. issue of Wired Magazine with Burning Man on the 
cover.  Opened up to page 205, There's a picture smack dab in the middle 
of the page.  And I'm in it!!  Along with Robert Brown (used to be on the 
list), Jason Greene (on the list) and my buddy Neil!

If you look toward the top right of the picture, you'll see the profile 
of a guy with a blue bandana on his head, thats Robert, directly to the 
left of him wearing a brown jacket is Neil, and a little bit to the left 
of him you'll see half of my face, I'm wearing glasses and a green hat, 
and the head thats covering my face is Jason Green.

Quite a random picture.  This was when the man was burning and we were 
just cruzing thru the crowd.  One thing strange about this article is 
there is not one picture of the man burning......guess the photographer 
left before Sunday night. 

peace,

Sorry, just regergetating from some pretty sloppy notes taken quickly over
the phone.  I haven't actually seen the flyer, but I hear it's quite nice.
Thanks for the schooling though.

Not with much hesitation do I post the following.  Let me explain...  
This is a little story that I wrote.  I am posting it as a dedication to
the rave scene and in celebration of Halloween.  Raving sparked in me a
creativity that I knew existed, but never acted on.  I've always dreamed
of writing, not to be famous, but rather as a creative outlet.  The
following is a story that came to me while at the Harmony 3-Year.  It's a
bit fictional, a bit biographical.  Maybe you will see yourself in it.
I'm not saying it's great writing, but it was fun and it is the first
creative writing I've done since maybe elementary school!!  I have never
been a humanities major and all my writing has been technical science
writing, so that is a disclaimer.  I am posting it here after much
hesitation because most of my writing occurs on a computer and I started
putting a lot of thoughts down when I joined sfraves.  It isn't terribly
long, but not short either.  I apologize for the taking-up of so much
bandwidth, but it has been a slow day and I thought someone might enjoy
this.  (Nancy also gave me a gentle nudge to do this, otherwise I might
never have sent this)  I still don't believe I am sending this,
but here goes...........  ***(oshit)***

Children of the Night


As the sun sets, I come alive; awakened by the darkness, entranced by the
full moon.  I feel the hunger inside of me, calling me from afar,
sharpening my senses.  

I dawn my flashy apparel, my bright colors, making up in darkness for what
I miss in the light.  I truly shine.  I pick up the phone and call the
number, being drawn more and more by my hunger.  A beat heard over the
phone and some wispy directions teases the pain inside of me, churns it
until my viscera ache and my brain throbs.  I am restless, waiting,
pondering that moment of bliss.  The ache grows, the hunger I cannot
withstand any longer.

I leave my habitation quietly, leaving behind a small, almost unnoticeable
trail of glitter and the tic-tac of platforms on a stairwell.  No one
notices except for the boy at the corner store.  He sees me every night I
leave, the gleam of knowledge in his eye.  He shares my hunger as well and
often accompanies me on my excursions into the shimmering night.  But, not
tonight, material needs harken him now.

As I climb into my car, adjusting the seatbelt, I reach for the 
radio, desperately searching for a few beats. 
"Please," I say, "just one," I can't stand this hunger any longer.
Although, I know, to whet my appetite is to sharpen the pain.  Yet, I
can't hold back.  Almost shaking with worry that nothing will come
through, I find some sound glowing through intermittent static.
Good enough, it will assuage that empty hole in my gut temporarily.

I pull my dusty, run-down car out onto the city streets that are almost
empty at this time of night.  Gently, I accelerate and head towards my
destination, the place where I will be able to satiate my hunger for
the time being.  But, it will return with a vengeance, this  hunger
of mine.  I can never truly rid myself of it.  It calls to me from afar,
calling through the moonlit streets, sifting through the gutters with its
mechanical voice.

Turning the corner, I see the greenish light with its iridescent glow, a
beacon to us, the sons and daughters of the night skies.  I park and
head for the light.  The air about me hums with the presence of others of
my kind.  The bright colors of their clothing are clearly visible, an
announcement of their pride.  I move slowly, yet eagerly towards the light
with a determined step,  The movement of the air rustles through my hair,
sending shivers down my spine.  Coupled with the anticipation, my nerves
are electric.  I take a deep breath and enter the doorway below the green
light.

All of a sudden I've entered another world; passed through the Wardrobe.
As the Mad Hatter skims past me, Alice greets me warmly at
the door with a kind smile.  Overpowered by my hunger, I
hadn't noticed the mass of my kind surrounding me, pushing, desiring for
the ritual to begin.  I quickly pay for the trip into this alien landscape
that has become familiar to me in the past months.

Gliding through the entrance, my hunger pauses as I shift dreamily into
recollections of my initiation into this world.  I recall the fear of the
unknown being pushed aside by the desire to transcend my ordinary
existence.  My knowing friends had been savvy to these rites for months
and years.  It seemed so casual to them, like an extension of their aura.
Me, on the other hand, was I not a bumbling idiot?  What if I'm not
accepted?  They are so graceful in their movements, so blissful.  How can
I ever earn my rites of passage?  All of these memories swirl in my head
like a crisp autumn leave caught in a whirlwind.  "Funny," I think, "how
everything fell into place."  I was so ignorant to think I couldn't be one
of them, anyone can.  All you have to do is love yourself.

The walls are vibrating as they muffle the huge soundwaves passing
through.  Entering the main room, I am met by an overwhelming blast of hot
air, heavy with the breath and sweat of those joined here to become one.
The juxtaposition of an almighty heaven and a hedonistic hell.

The music is coming from the enormous speakers against the walls.  There
are bodies everywhere, twitching with incalculable delight.  I peer across
the undulating mass of human forms with a certain reverence.  My kind, my
brothers and sisters of the darkness.  With a silent woosh the lasers
sweep across the crowd, playing with the musky, smoky air; astounding even
the disbelievers.  The music is brilliant, generating an amorphous quality
that, once you grasp it, slips away only to be chased again.

The others are simply beautiful.  They are dressed in radiant colors and
lights, reminiscent of Monet.  There is a beauty to be found here in this
dilapidated warehouse.  We are at the turn of the century and technology
is used to its best to find beauty where nothing but decay exists.  Is
this the innovation of the young, of the next generation?  Or
is this the left-overs from the fore-fathers who have taken all and left
little?

I step onto the dancefloor to join the others.  As the music
pervades my body, I begin feeding.  Feeding off the beats. Manipulating
them with my body until they are mine.  The whole inside of me begins to
fill.  Every vein and artery, every nerve, sways with the power of my
nourishment.  Once my soul is replete, a profound happiness will settle
over my being and will last until, from sheer exhaustion, I can dance no
more.

Me, borne to the night, a raver, an intrepid vampire whose sustenance is
music.  My giddiness is contagious; it spreads to him and to her and back
again.  The magnificent infinitesimal circle of life; a crazy eight
filtering the minds of the masses.

In this existence I feel the pain of time passing.  I see the second hand
of the world before my eyes turning slowly, then quicker, then spiraling
until the future cometh.  The present becomes the past too quickly.  Thine
enemy of the dance world has come.  The hazy shades of early morning
arrive.  The sun pushes through the atmosphere with a persistence
unbeknownst to the night.

Glowing with a profound fullness, having made my special connection with
my fellow partners in crime, we end our night's journey in a stunned
satisfaction.  We dissipate with the last remaining shadows.  Back to our
houses, back to pretending we know what normal existence is.  The hunger
never leaves us, like the vampire of yore, we will be called again and
again.  For that inexplicable emptiness of our meager insides never
leaves.  Like a sieve, it empties before it fills.  As we pull the
blankets over our heads to ponder the memories of the night before, we
dream of our parallel existence.  But we are saddened.  For the universe
is endless, but the night is not.

That was THE BEST party....seeing everyone pull together and put out the
fire was soo cool.  The music had stopped during the fire and 1/2 the ppl
were fleeing...but another 1/2 ran up the hill and put out the fire. Me? i
was just coming on and was toooooo high to do anything...well...atleast not
able to try and tame a fire, but i do applaude all who did.  Anyway...if
there is one moment in my life i will NEVER forget is when all of a
sudden.......BOOM...BOOM...BOOM the music kicked back in and just as loud
and hard as ever...it really rocked my world. Thank u freedom!

Just one small experience out of many that happen at SOME massives.

Have a good day all.

Here's Top Secret info on Technics SL1200's:

The current cost to retailers is $374 or less per piece

The average cost of needles is 40 to 75 pts.

That means a Stanton 500el that costs $29 actually only costs the dealer
about $11 to $15. an Orthophon Night Club Kit at $225 retail only costs
the dealer about $100. Most sales people are out to get $$$comm and will
easily bend to price beats. In the South bay, use "SOUNDYNAMIX" on Tully
Rd., SJ,  as a source for a price beat.. There's not much of a profit
margin on the part of the 1200s (due to committed production in Japan),
but at least that gives you ammunition to use on the sales floor. If
this doesn't work, let me know and I'll conduct a seance to possess that
salesf@#%k with ultra-vibe!

NO raver deserves to pay full price for good music.

praying for FnF this Halloween,

Terry

Hello everyone,

        I really hope a lot of you make it to the metting tonight on such
short notice. We could really use a lot of help!

        It starts @ 7:30pm...

        Directions are: 

>From S.F.: Take 101so -> 85so -> 280so... (or you can just take 280so) Exit
Stevens Creek/Lawrence Expressway and take a left at the light. Go under the
freeway and look to your left. There will be "City Espresso" right next to
"Payless Drug." Go there and smile a lot, you'll see us there!

>From East bay: 880so (or 680so) -> 280no... Exit Lawrence Expressway and
take a right at the light. Go immediately left into the "City Espresso"
parking lot and smile a lot!


        Hope to see you there! Also I believe Omar's family is going to be
there to explain a little about what is going on with him. 

Peace,

Greg =)
Peace, love and harmony to all!!!

Greg =)

Hi all! =)
     
 Well, I havn't done this in a while so I don't feel too bad ;)
     
It looks like I will be assisting the FnF party and could use a ride for 
myself and a _little_ equipment. Individual must commit to ride there 
AND back. Covered truck or van prefered (it may rain) Please write me 
privately if interested. I'm voluntering my time and equipment so the same 
is expected from the driver.
Thanks!!

Hi,
This is going to be a BLATANT plug, so don't read on if you don't want to...
Funky Tekno Tribe's Graeme remixed that particular single, so if you want to 
watch him play that single live... come this Saturday.... Here are some 
reviews of it....

Mohan
Funky Tekno Tribe

E.T.I vs Graeme
Baby Rise/Blue Dreamers
Oboro/US/12
Well, well, well Oboro number two is on its way to destroy a dance floor near 
you. This will be a massive summer party track that will outlive summer into 
Fall and beyond. Busybodies E.T.I and the other half of the Robbers of 
Antiquity, DJ Graeme are the perfect combination on this serious two track 
adventure. "Blue Dreamers" is the superfly, beatboxing, old school electro 
sounding jammie that is ooohhh sooooo fresh! "Baby Rise" is a slammin 
subsonic, backbreaking beat offering that is subsonic to say the least. 
Massive potential with this release, find this, buy this record, even if its 
your last five dollars, you will thank me later.
-Ryno XLR8R Magazine

Tori Amos Makes Her Way Underground
Anthem house bigwig BT and singer Tori Amos have collaborated on a single 
together to be out on Reprise/WEA. Big deal, right? Well, through the earlier 
success of the Robbers of Antiquity record Nocturnal, the San Francisco duo 
Graeme "La Paix" and Darin Marshall were asked to remix the track. Half of the 
Robbers, Darin decided to skip the project while Graeme hooked up with another 
local outfit currently slammin out the jams, ETI. So ETI and Graeme got 
together and pumped out their version of Blue Skies which in Graemes words 
isnt as pretty as BTs original, "its much more snappy, with an upbeat 
hardhouse feel to it, kinda funky and warmer with a breakbeat." ETI have also 
seen recent success with their collaboration with Wickeds DJ Garth on the 
track 7 Minutes of Disco Glory. Graeme and ETI have released Baby Rise/Blue 
Dreamers on Oboro together earlier this month and are sitting tight, waiting 
to hear when their remix will be released.

Hi-

 I was listening to Live 105 last night and they played the new Tori Amos/BT 
song "Blue Skys".  Has anyone else heard it, and if so do you know where I 
could possibly get this on vinyl.  The release date is supposed to be sometime 

in November, but I know it's been getting some major play over in the UK.

	I can say nothing about the second two, but as for MDMA, your
characterization of "brain damaging" is a bit different from most of
the research that has been done (though no usuable data has been
collected from studies on humans since the FDA scheduled MDMA in 85 or
86, I forget which). So far, the results that have come from studies
on rats and monkeys is that MDMA causes nerves in the brain stem (I
believe) to form abnormally. Now, no one knows how the brain works,
so no one knows if this is damage or just a different formation. We
as humans, have not come to understand how the networks of nerve cells
in our brains map to thought processes or "normal" behavior, if there
is any correlation at all... Until that time, it will be difficult to
same whether these changes are harmful to us as humans, harmful to
maintaining the current society, or just harmful to someone's
wallet...

	How do any of us know what "moderation" is? High school is
one of those arbitary lines that we can draw, but the real problem is
not age, but maturity or that lovely term for which everyone
seems to have a different definition - personal responsibility. Maybe
I should start using the term presonal accountibility. I had a talk
today with a cop who works with the DARE program in Nevada, and worked
with it in a form that I thought was the most responsible approach the
DARE program has taken yet. He had said their main objective was to
work with kids to increase their self esteem and commiunication skills.
This is suppose to curtail kids being pressured into drugs. He said
the old "Just say NO" campaign is out dated. So what distinguishes a
high school drug user from a college drug user? Nothing in a lot of
cases...

	Anyway, I have spewed on this topic often enough, as well as
others topics concerning personal responsibility for I deal it is
a quality everyone who goes out to parties must have (at least for the
type of parties that really go off which are the ones I want to
attend).

I don't post too much on the list, but i thought i would add my little 2
cents here just for information's sake :)

I would argue with you here Dave.   There have been a number of studies
done on human brains of people who have died in England of supposed E
overdoses, and they have found a degeneration of nerves in them, just as
was seen in the latest study by Ricaurte et al published last fall.  The
Ricaurte studies proved the MDMA caused serotonergic neurons in the brain
to degenerate, and although some did grow back, they never grew back to the
same location.  Because serotonergic neurons are known to have an effect on
mood and the like, it can be safely assumed that this restructuring of the
brain's connections would have some sort of affect on a person's mental
state.

There have also been a number of case studies where doctors have followed
kids who have claimed to have mood changes as a result of ecstasy
overusage.  Some of the people studied also had used large amounts of lsd.
Point is that they were overusing the drugs, and abuse of something like
that has its consequences.

The facts are out there.  Talk to anyone who uses e a lot, and they will
tell you they have noticed changes in their personalities as well....that
is unless they've gone crazy already :P

I am not saying here that one hit of e will totally change a person's life
forever, but i do think people ought to realize that it isn't the wonder
drug of the twentieth century either.  It has ups AND downs, and as long as
you realize that each time you take a hit, you put yourself on a coaster
ride that can go either way up or way down, then you're being a bit more
realistic.

Good point, i think that maturity is the key, not age.  Too bad one can't
easily tell who is mature enough to handle certain situations and who isn't
till after they get into them...

Oh, well, enough cheese.   Hope you're all having fun in california :P

it's not class, it's schedule.  and isn't mdma schedule 1?  it belongs on
schedule 3, but the dea's scheduling system doesn't actually have any basis
in written law.

I know what you mean.  To me, the parties that I help put on in England
with Spiral Tribe and Bedlam in
91/92 was the best time of my life. 2-3,000 people a week, E that makes E
round here seem like a sugar sweet, completely free and a vibe that was so
strong that it was like getting hit on the side of the head with a cricket
bat.  And then I came over here and started to go to the full-moon parties
on Bonny Dune Beach.  Man, those were really good parties: 1,000 people
and a beautiful vibe with beautiful music; exellent LSD as well.  It was
enough to impress me and I am very hard to impress.  Then the last
full-moon rave I went to only had about fifty people there and I thought
that was sad.  Where did all the people go?  Ah well, at least there are
still Sunset parties (which are beautiful in their own way) but some how
the massive of the vibe is not what it once was.  Although I felt that it
might be on it's way back when I done the Canibus Buyers Club.
But, while it may (sadly) be true that the vibe, for some of us, was not
the same as it was, this is actually a very negative view of the scene.
One should always have the attitude, whether it's about the rave scene or
indded any scene that one is involved in, that the best of it is always
just around the corner.

If the guitar centre is selling 1200's for $449 here is what you should
do: go there and a get a written price quote, then take it to good guys
were they will sell you the 1200 for $449 plus taking off 10% of $150
(there price being $599!).  Something to do with their price garantee
thing.

the monkey studies have shown that serotonin receptors get
damaged.  sure, there hasn't been a lot of conclusive proof in
humans, but you betcha that within 3-5 years there will be.  i'm not
saying don't take e. i'm just saying be careful, don't overdo it.
it *will* damage your brain and/or your liver.

i will repost an informative post someone did last year about
the hows and whys, and how you can possibly prevent such damage
(your mileage may vary).

you're right of course, it's hard to draw an arbitrary line.  the
same goes for beer.  some high school kids are ready for it, some aren't.
in general i think they can and should probably live without "hard drugs"
until they are out of HS.

 Well, regarding all this talk about MDMA research, etc.  Here's
 something I thought y'all would find interesting...MDMA is FINALLY
 being studied clinically again, here's some info:

 Actually that address is more specifically
 http://www.maps.org/news-letters/v6n3/index.shtml!  But there's a
 lot in the MAPS site...that particular site that I just wrote above
 talks about all kinds of research around the world that is being
 done at present with psychedelics.

J&R Music and Computers in NYC is selling 1200's for $479.95. However,
if you know of a lower price, they will match it. If you're feeling
really cocky, make up some price, make up a store selling at that
price, give some friends's number who can pretend to be that store, and
give it a try :-). The big advantage is that J&R is in NYC, so you save
on the 8.5% sales tax (which is like $85.00 for $1000.00 o'
turntables). Of course, you have to pay 3% shipping for any "heavy"
items like turntables, but that still saves you 5.5% over what you'd
pay in CA. They also sell mixers (Gemini, Audio Technica, Pioneer),
phono carts,  headphones (Sony MdrV6 -- $69.95), etc. I bought my
Pioneer CDJ-500mkII and CDM-500 plus a road case from them at a price
that was many hundreds of $$$ less than any local shops, and cheaper
than that ProSound ripoff place in LA too, without the lame/rude LA
attitude (yes, it's true, i prefer NYC attitude to LA attitude!).
They're a reputable establishment and  they have a decent
return/defective policy as well. 1-800-221-8180

***********************
Top ten reasons the "Wired" IPO ran into trouble

10. Investors discovered it was a publishing company
9.  HotBot: toy car or search engine?
8.  "Wired" too hip for NASDAQ and AMEX, wants to start
    own exchange
7.  Geeks and suits: not a happy mix
6.  Too many of Hotwired's cocktails
5.  A big mix-up: investors kept going to www.howtired.com
    instead
4.  Top investors spent all their money on snowboards;
    none left for stock
3.  Wired's ticker symbol, SUCK, turning people off
2.  Expected investors to pay with e-cash
1.  Nobody could read the prospectus: printed in blue
    ink on red paper

Apologies, and best wishes, to Wired (symbol: WWWW).

Greetings Friends!

There will be a Friends & Family this Saturday. Before giving you the
details I just wanted to address the following.

  It is in no way our intention to be elitist, superunderground or whatever.

  It is however our firmest intention to manage our parties, and
expectations surrounding them
  responsibly.

Up until this morning, we did not have everything we needed (like
insurance) and hence the party was at best 50/50 for happening, which is
why, despite the fact that we continued planning for it, we did not
announce it publicly. This is also why tickets have not been available.

Two effects of having to pull this together on such short notice are

 a) due to space constraints, there will be less total tickets available
for this party and
 b) we will not be able to do mail order etc, ie tickets will be harder to get

This is not how we'd like it be, but simply How It Is given the
circumstances.  Once again our sincerest apologies to those who want a
ticket and don't end up with one.

So, roughly 300 tickets will be available in the east bay Saturday at 4pm.
They will probaly sell out in a half hour or less, so I'd plan on being
there at 4 on the nose or earlier. There will be a maximum of 4 tickets
sold per person. Suggested donation is $5 though if you care to donate more
you're certainly welcome, and truth be told we could use it this time. The
exact location will go on our VMs at 11am Saturday, however once again,
tickets will not arrive at the location until 4pm.

There will be no tickets at the venue, a map point will be used to check
tickets.

415.281.9432  415.985.7187

hope to see you there =)
ethan

For those of you looking for something a little different and rejuvenating
this weekend, you may like to know about the Full Moon gathering on
Saturday nite in Mount Shasta. "Celebrate Life" is organized by Paula Noel,
one time
Portland promoter, now resident in Shasta. Line up is Mark Farina, Mark E
Quark (fresh new shiny San Francisco resident), Preston, and myself (Andrew
Rawnsley).
I think this party will be worth the drive. Apart from being set in a
wonderful place, the spirit of this party will be one of healing and
connection with....well whatever you make of it. It starts early (@8pm, a
new and quite brilliant concept i.m.o) and promises to be
stellar....perhaps even inter-stellar...

************************ 
 
DILBERT'S LAWS OF WORK 
  
  
 If you can't get your work done in the first 24 hours, work nights. 
  
 A pat on the back is only a few centimeters from a kick in the butt. 
  
 Don't be irreplaceable, if you can't be replaced, you can't be 
 promoted. 
  
 It doesn't matter what you do, it only matters what you say you've 
 done and what you're going to do. 
  
 After any salary raise, you will have less money at the end of the 
 month than you did before. 
  
 The more crap you put up with, the more crap you are going to get. 
  
 You can go anywhere you want if you look serious and carry a 
 clipboard. 
  
 Eat one live toad the first thing in the morning and nothing worse 
 will happen to you the rest of the day. 
  
 When the bosses talk about improving productivity, they are never 
 talking about themselves. 
  
 If at first you don't succeed, try again. Then quit. No use being a 
 damn fool about it. 
  
 There will always be beer cans rolling on the floor of your car when 
 the boss asks for a ride home from the office. 
  
 Keep your boss's boss off your boss's back. 
  
 Everything can be filed under "miscellaneous." 
  
 Never delay the ending of a meeting or the beginning of a cocktail 
 hour. 
  
 To err is human, to forgive is not our policy. 
  
 Anyone can do any amount of work provided it isn't the work he/she is 
 supposed to be doing. 
  
 Important letters that contain no errors will develop errors in the 
 mail. 
  
 If you are good, you will be assigned all the work. If you are really 
 good, you will get out of it. 
  
 You are always doing something marginal when the boss drops by your 
 desk. 
  
 People who go to conferences are the ones who shouldn't. 
  
 If it wasn't for the last minute, nothing would get done. 
  
 At work, the authority of a person is inversely proportional to the 
 number of pens that person is carrying. 
  
 When you don't know what to do, walk fast and look worried. 
  
 Following the rules will not get the job done. 
  
 Getting the job done is no excuse for not following the rules. 
  
 When confronted by a difficult problem you can solve it more easily 
 by reducing it to the question, "How would the Lone Ranger handle this?" 
  
 No matter how much you do, you never do enough. 
  
 The last person that quit or was fired will be held responsible for 
 everything that goes wrong.

While everyone is talking about MDMA, I'd thought I'd slip this in.

A few months ago I had a very informative discussion about MDMA with my
doctor. One thing that I was not aware of that he mentioned was that
when people with ADD (like myself) have lowered Dophamine (sp?) levels,
their 'ADD like habits' are increased. 

MDMA is known to lower Dophamine levels as well as seritonin.

Consequently I haven't taken e scence then.

My introduction to Raving and undergroud DJ'ing was in L.A. in 1990 and all
I used to hear was SF, SF, SF, it's the shit (as in good)......so I finally
came up to check out a full moon party at candlestick park (the one with
the violent ending.......) 
 
I was blown away by the tribal funky house sound that Garth played........
as L.A. was predominately Techno at the time, this was a new sound and vibe
for me....... I was never the same ever again........  
 
I actually decided that night to move to SF and it took about 6 months to
fully move my life......... I arrived in aug of 92 and for about 8 months I
was totally happy and inspired and everything seemed so good.......... 
 
but around summer of 93 things just seemed stale, weird, and got
strange........ for a while I thought it was the scene.........after a
while longer I thought it was me........ it turned out it was both........ 
 
I have spent 3 years searching for the vibe and every 3 months or so I
would find it........ but not with the regularity I was used to or happy
with. I actually gave up and "retired"from performing  but deep down
inside, I really wanted to be DJ'ing and I discovered it was a passion I
could not walk away from........ 
 
I went last year to the haight street fair and ran into greg & cindy (FnF),
and through them I worked with FnF and also worked with the new moon party,
and then I did a full moon, and I began to feel the vibe in SF was getting
better.......... and it has......the power structure seemed to be  moving
hands........as younger promoters began to throw parties.......... some
really cool parties and new vibes in S.F. has given me hope that the future
is in good hands. parties like Harmony, CCC, Cloud Factory, Gateway, Spaz &
Sunsets have taken over the vibe that Wicked used to have with there full
moon parties. 
 
I personally find most massives to be rather formula oriented and depending
on the promoters can be good or bad....... I have only attended one
gathering, DJ'd at one cool world, did a FTT (before they called it FTT),
and basically find I'm happier associating with parties no bigger than 750
people.......... 
 
since my return to S.F. after a summer in the UK, I found I was no longer
inspired by S.F. (after an insane & totally inspired visit to London), and
I decided after 2 weeks to move back to the UK. (I was originally born in
London), so I am legal there and it seemed a syncrinisitus place to be for
me at this time...... like a coming home, only better as I have developed a
lifestyle that is reminicent of rave culture UK circa 88/89. 
 
I found the vibe I was looking for in London this summer, and my heart &
soul is into moving there now.....I hope whether you are into small parties
or massives that you find the vibe you are all looking for.....  
 
I find travelling & moving from city to city (and now country to country)
seems to rejuvinate my sence of excitement and I find I am part of a bigger
family and picture than "the S.F scene" can offer me........ meeting fellow
clubbers & DJ's etc in other parts of the world and being invited to cool
vibe parties is the essence of what the music and scene is all
about......... to inspire others in other places, to be inspired by others
in other places, is what can I say ......inspirational..... 
 
I hope this puts to rest any rumors or attitudes people have of me that
reflect in a negative way.......I have always been my own worst enemy and I
find I mirror peoples emotions......if you are cool, calm, respectful and
kind, I tend to be the same........ 
 
...........if you are nasty, vile, and derogitory, I reflect back on you
that same negative energy......... it is a weakness I try to overcome, and
I try not to associate with people that take me down that ugly road.......
As I did a few weeks ago here on SFRaves........ 
 
I would like to close out by appologizing publically to Mr stuff and all
the other fine members of SFRaves. I have been under a lot of stress lately
and Mr Stuff just pushed my buttons.......... and I responded like a puppet
on a string........... 
 
If anyone comes to London, please look me up and I can help you to find the
vibe in London etc......I will be hopefully changing my e-mail address to 
 
 MOONPUP@CLUB.NET  
 
(I am just waiting for the official word from Wayne)...... I will post that
in the next day or two when it becomes official..........  
 
for those that want tapes, you need to call and sort it out..........like
now........ as I am running out of time......... there will be no tapes
made after Oct 31st and I leave Nov 2nd for London..........call me
@415-337-666 or e-mail me

Yes, it looks like it's another weekend of trance for me, the breaks
fiend...Goa Gil tonight, maybe and then FnF tomorrow night (assuming
I can get one of them ever-ellusive tickets).  I'm actually
considering going to FTT tomorrow Just Because.  I mean yes, it will
most likely suck by the usual "I love a small lovey vibey party"
standards, but ALL THOSE PEOPLE!  People watching alone will be
primo.  And the music you have to admit, will be bomb.  So, I may go
to that...I just can't decide.

Regardless, everyone have an amazing weekend, and enjoy all the
trancey music...people keep telling me that it's not NORMALLY like
this which makes me wonder "did I bring it with me when I moved, or
something?"  I swear, trance trance trance.

It could be me--just my changing tastes, or maybe I've finally gotten
connected to all the cool parties--but I've noticed the same thing...it
seems to have exploded this year, especially over the last six months or
so.

I'm not complaining, you understand.

All that is happening on Saturday, my friend.  And I quote:

"So, roughly 300 tickets will be available in the east bay Saturday at 4pm.
They will probaly sell out in a half hour or less, so I'd plan on being
there at 4 on the nose or earlier. There will be a maximum of 4 tickets
sold per person. Suggested donation is $5 though if you care to donate more
you're certainly welcome, and truth be told we could use it this time. The
exact location will go on our VMs at 11am Saturday, however once again,
tickets will not arrive at the location until 4pm."

Glad you're up for going, see you there.

Tony

I thank everyone for clarifying my stupid error.  I was just so damn
excited about an FnF that I was all pumped up and ready to go.  You were
all correct.  I didn't really want to go to FTT so I've been holding out
for FnF and I'm glad that they came through.  I was just so pumped that I
guess my ears were not functioning properly (I feel so damn embarassed).
Oh well, the adrelenine is slowly wearing off so I apologize for acting in
such haste.  Thanx for replying so quickly.

Jose

Hey guys,
       (Just one last post before I log off of sfraves for another two
semesters.)

           This is a great post about how to stop E Neurotoxicity!

        After reading that thread about the reorginazation of neurons,
I thought I'd put in a little bit of my knowledge and opinion. I've 
basically spent most of my free time this summer reading the current 
journal articles on MDMA, and I'm a junior chemist at Harvey Mudd College 
(which btw, has a pretty cool scene here...), so I THINK I am somewhat 
reliable of a source (though I am always learning, just like everyone else)

        If you don't like boring scientific brain stuff, just skip to the
        end for answers on how to stop E neurotoxicity. There are actually a
        lot of really effective things you can do, and I've tried to list
        all that I know of (I'm sure there are more things...).

Q: What does E do?
A: It causes the massive release of serotonin from serotonergic presynaptic
neurons. Basically the neurons terminals that contain serotonin as their
neurotransmitter are caused to fire (ie. release serotonin into the synapse)
by MDMA. 
A very simplistic view of serotonin might describe it as the "happy
neurotransmitter," since low levels of it are associated with
depression. After this massive release your body probably cannot recollect
all of your serotonin (some gets degraded, some just floats away). Hence
your serotonin levels drop.

Q: What else does E do?
A: It inhibits TPH, tryptophan hydroxylase. This enzyme is the first of two
steps which transforms tryptophan (an amino acid) to serotonin. Hence new
production of serotonin is halted (or at least slowed down signifigantly).

Q: Is this what causes depression the next day?
A: Most likely, yes. After a night in which a chemical has caused the
massive release of serotonin into the synapse, and then significantly slowed
the new production of serotonin, your serotonin levels are likely to be
markedly lowered.

Q: Is MDMA neurotoxic?
A: Yes. It selectively degeneretes (note - it does NOT kill, as far as we
know) serotonin neuron terminals. In experiments on monkeys, after stopping
MDMA use for approx a year, the neuron terminals were found to
regenerate. 

MY THEORY - It's at this point that the serotonergic neuron terminals grow 
back to the wrong place, hence causing the abnormal connections we were just
reading about in the "Rave Drug May Damage Brain...." or whatever. But this
is just my theory on things...

Q: What causes the neurotoxicity?
A: This one's a doozy.....  After the serotonin has binded to the receptor
on the other side of the synpapse (the post-synaptic neuron), there is a 
reuptake pump (on the pre-synaptic neuron) that sucks back up the serotonin 
from the synapse. Every now and then the pump will suck up a dopamine
molecule (another neurotransmitter that isn't really related to the
"feel-good" effects of E). That dopamine doesn't have any business being
inside of a serotonin neuron, so MAO-B degrades the dopamine, IN THE 
PROCESS OF WHICH HYDROGEN PEROXIDE IS FORMED!!!!! 
        
Q: So what's the big deal about Hydrogen Peroxide?
A: Nothing normally. H2O2 (hydrogen peroxide) is toxic to animals because it
splits in two to form two hydroxyl free radicals, which are very reactive
and very damaging. Normally your body can handle these varmits just fine,
just by reducing them with anti-oxidants (like Vitamin C, E, or
glutathione).

Q: H2O2 and MDMA: so what's the connection?
A: MAO-B also degrades serotonin, but not as well as it degrades dopamine,
but there is usually so much serotonin as compared to dopamine inside of a
serotonergic neuron, that it has a hard time getting around to the dopamine,
so very little H2O2 is formed. HOWEVER, during an E trip, a whole heck of a
lot of your serotonin is outside in the synapse, not in the neuron, so the
MAO-B has a much easier time getting to the dopamine, and hence forming more
H2O2. (Also I think E causes a larger production of dopamine elsewhere in
your brain, and eventually some of that dopamine will get inside of the 
serotonergic neurons). Now there is a much higher level of H2O2 INSIDE of
your serotonergic neurons than your body can effectively get rid of, and
NOW we start seeing brain damage: specifically, selective serotonergic
neuron degeneration.

MY THEORY - The neurons form abnormal connections after being damaged, maybe
because they just hook up with the closet thing nearby. If you could stop
this degeneration damage somehow, there would be no way for the neurons to
grow back abnormally since they are already fine.

                        END OF BORING SCIENTIFIC STUFF

Q: So how do I stop this shitty neurotoxicity?
A: Many Many different ways. Below is a list of the ways I am currently
familiar with, though I'm sure there are probably more...


1) Stop the reuptake of serotonin (and hence the accidental reuptake of
   dopamine also which is the real cause of the neurotoxicity) by taking an
   SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor). So take:

                                Prozac 

   Take it 3-6 hours afters taking your E dose, and this will significantly
   reduce neurotoxicity. THIS IS A WELL DOCUMETNED EFFECT! This is not one
   of my other theories. If you do this your brain will love you for it. Any
   other SSRI will also have the same effect (Xanax? Zoloft? Are those SSRIs?) 
   This might even make your trip a bit better, because it will keep the
   serotonin in the synapse longer....

2) Stop the breakdown of dopamine by MAO-B. This is the ultimate step which
   produces the toxic hydrogen peroxide. The documented case I read about
   used:

                               L-deprenyl

   which I believe is a commonly prescribed anti-depressant, though when I
   think about it, maybe it's not since.... Well does anyone have any info
   on this or where to get it? It would be greatly appreciated.... Anyways,
   take it the same time that you take your E, cause that's what worked for
   the rats.... Other MAO-B inhibitors will also work (ask your doctor about
   this....)

3) Increase relative serotonin levels. If you eats lots of tryptophan at the
   same time you eat your E, this will overcome the inhibitory effects that
   E has on TPH (tryptophan hydroxylase), which will increase relative
   serotonin levels, which will decrease the degradative actions of MAO-B on
   dopamine (since all of the extra serotonin will be getting in the way),
   which will produce less H2O2, and hence less damage. So....

        Take something like 2-3 capsules of tryptophan with 1 capsule E.

   Unfortunatley, the FDA has taken tryptophan (an amino acid!!!) off of the
   market for what I believe is essentially political reasons (they found it
   later to be a contaminent in a Japanese pharmaceuticals tryptophan
   product that was causing the sickness, not the tryptophan itself.....)
   You can still probably get it in Mexico though and you probably can even
   mail order it for European Pharmaceutical companies. It's not like it's a
   Schedule I drug like E is....
   This might also make your trip a bit better because you will now be
   continually producing serotonin. IT WILL ALMOST DEFINITELY HELP WITH
   POST-E DEPRESSION....

4) Stop the free-radical damage. This is the easiest to do, since
   anti-oxidants are extremely easy to come by. Some suggestions:

        Glutathione - This a naturally occuring tripeptide in your body. I
                      THINK it is one of the chemicals your brain uses in
                      the process that gets rid of free radicals. And it
                      itself is an anti-oxidant....

        Vitamin C
        Vitamin E
        Melatonin (fairly good report in recent Newsweek on this)
        Many others....

   It would probably be a good idea to take some with your E, and then maybe
   about 3-6 hours later....



                 Summary

Prozac & other SSRIs                    3-6 hours after taking E
L-deprenyl and other MAO-B inhibitors   When you take your E
Tryptophan ***                          When you take your E
Anti-oxidants
    Vitamin C
    Vitamin E
    glutathione ***
    melatonin

*** - highly recommend

        Well, that's it.... Hope I haven't gone too overboard. I would like 
to give one last thanks to the SF scene for giving me what I believe was the
greatest summer I've ever had. Thanks much to all you out there who have
make it so special....

                                          lots and lots and lots o luv,

                                                Jason Sydes

Hearing the same music all the time is boring. Lately, I've been
spending equal time in ambient rooms, going to jungle parties,
listening to trip-hop, listening to more ambient, going to different
*kinds* of trance parties (cyber-trance, goa trance, etc), etc etc...

All of this adds *variety*. It's out there; just look around. At
Charity, I spent most of my time in the breakbeat room, despite the
fact that two of my favorite DJ's (Deaks and Dutch) were spinning
downstairs.

I love trance more than any other music, and I don't ever want to get
sick of it. That's why I take time away from it as often as I can.

just some random thoughts from my cubicle,
Steve

My introduction to Raving and undergroud DJ'ing was in L.A. in 1990 and all
I used to hear was SF, SF, SF, it's the shit (as in good)......so I finally
came up to check out a full moon party at candlestick park (the one with
the violent ending.......) 
 
I was blown away by the tribal funky house sound that Garth played........
as L.A. was predominately Techno at the time, this was a new sound and vibe
for me....... I was never the same ever again........  
 
I actually decided that night to move to SF and it took about 6 months to
fully move my life......... I arrived in aug of 92 and for about 8 months I
was totally happy and inspired and everything seemed so good.......... 
 
but around summer of 93 things just seemed stale, weird, and got
strange........ for a while I thought it was the scene.........after a
while longer I thought it was me........ it turned out it was both........ 
 
I have spent 3 years searching for the vibe and every 3 months or so I
would find it........ but not with the regularity I was used to or happy
with. I actually gave up and "retired"from performing  but deep down
inside, I really wanted to be DJ'ing and I discovered it was a passion I
could not walk away from........ 
 
I went last year to the haight street fair and ran into greg & cindy (FnF),
and through them I worked with FnF and also worked with the new moon party,
and then I did a full moon, and I began to feel the vibe in SF was getting
better.......... and it has......the power structure seemed to be  moving
hands........as younger promoters began to throw parties.......... some
really cool parties and new vibes in S.F. has given me hope that the future
is in good hands. parties like Harmony, CCC, Cloud Factory, Gateway, Spaz &
Sunsets have taken over the vibe that Wicked used to have with there full
moon parties. 
 
I personally find most massives to be rather formula oriented and depending
on the promoters can be good or bad....... I have only attended one
gathering, DJ'd at one cool world, did a FTT (before they called it FTT),
and basically find I'm happier associating with parties no bigger than 750
people.......... 
 
since my return to S.F. after a summer in the UK, I found I was no longer
inspired by S.F. (after an insane & totally inspired visit to London), and
I decided after 2 weeks to move back to the UK. (I was originally born in
London), so I am legal there and it seemed a syncrinisitus place to be for
me at this time...... like a coming home, only better as I have developed a
lifestyle that is reminicent of rave culture UK circa 88/89. 
 
I found the vibe I was looking for in London this summer, and my heart &
soul is into moving there now.....I hope whether you are into small parties
or massives that you find the vibe you are all looking for.....  
 
I find travelling & moving from city to city (and now country to country)
seems to rejuvinate my sence of excitement and I find I am part of a bigger
family and picture than "the S.F scene" can offer me........ meeting fellow
clubbers & DJ's etc in other parts of the world and being invited to cool
vibe parties is the essence of what the music and scene is all
about......... to inspire others in other places, to be inspired by others
in other places, is what can I say ......inspirational.....

Hi all,

for those with an interest in the action and possible side effects of MDMA
I recommend visiting your neighborhood university medical library and
checking out the following recent review on MDMA:"Adverse reactions with
3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA; 'Ecstasy')" by U.D. McCann,
S. O. Slate and G.A. Ricaurte in Drug Safety 1996 (2), 107-115, which
summarizes everything that could acutely or in the long run go wrong
when taking E. Summarizing the conclusions MDMA can acute haert problems,
kidney failure, nasty blood clotting in occasional (acute) cases. Prolonged
use may lead to serotonin neurotoxicity resulting possibly in depression,
cognitive disturbance and anxiety disorders. Note that this review states
that neurotoxicity in humans has not yet been proven. Furthermore it states
that the number of reported complications of E use is low compared to the
number of users (which could be due to people not reporting them) and
that especially the neurotoxicity effects may be very subtle (involving
mood/sleeping/appetite/cognition disorders) and not be noticed until
a few years from now.

Oh, and while people are theorizing on the list regarding neuron terminals
growing back in the "wrong" place, I wonder what the wrong place is
exactly. The connections between neurons determine much of how our
brain/personality/intelligence works and I don't think the relation
between the exact composition of our brain neural network and
psychology is well understood. I guess we'll have to wait and see.

Still not feeling depressed,


The Frying Dutchman
of nerve

I still support "Da Mayor".  Will vote for him again, whether or not he
takes up  MY issue or not.  He still has plenty of work to do, but I will
not micro-judge him on any single issue.  A whole bunch at a time, but not
any single issue...

Oh yeah, I'm also voting for that philandering good-ol-boy George Clinton,
I mean Bill Clinton.  Why?  I could never vote for anyone who wants to roll
back the clock naymore than it already has been.

So for the wel informed:
"Da Mayor" for the Mayor.
"Da Prez" in all his McDonald eatin' glory, for President.

Republicans go home (or back to the plantation as the case might be, and
may Newt Gingritch not only be stripped of his speakership, but may he be
banished forever from the face of congress, same for Jesse Helms, Strom
Thrumond, and the rest of that republican-southern lot!).

Now, I do wish we could do something about the recurring police harassment
at parties.  It seems the boyz in blue are back, in strength, to collect
thier money.  I hope all who are throwing parties, have their permit money
ready.

Late,
John

I haven't seen any references to this yet, but last year's legendary FnF 
was also a COSTUME PARTY!!  I had to miss this party <boo hoo>, but saw 
pictures - and people were decked out!

I am desperately searching for a costume (and an idea!) tomorrow, and if 
I find either, I will come to FnF in disguise...

Hope others are dressed up (I mean, even weirder than usual! ;)

I'm curious about something.  Usually on Fridays the people of the list 
will start posting their plans for the weekend, and give a discription of 
what they'll be wearing that goes something like this:

5'7" brown hair, blue eyes, White Addida's shirt, purple stripped pants, 
green shoes with white pokadots.....ect.........

Has anyone ever found a member of sfraves by rembering how they discribed 
themselfs on the list (other than the group that dress as Crayola 
Crayon's, they are pretty easy to spot)?

just wonderin'

Hello-
	I am passing on a request to anyone who has pictures of the 
Gateway area in rave camp from Burning Man. If you have anything that 
details the area around the Gateway kitchen/living area, the silver dome 
with the yellow bus, or past that area before the accident on Monday 
morning, could you send me an email message? If anyone has any ariel 
photos of the location, that would be greatly appreciated...

        I actually have a night free from my girlfriend tonight (and that's
a good thing too). I've been kinda depressed lately about our relationship
and need to relieve my tension tonight. Anyone have the numbers and
suggestions for where to go tonight. I'm in class right now so if anyone
could send me directions they found, it'd be really appreciated. I may go
alone, but if I have to, I'll get a friend or two to go with me to the
palladium or something (cuz they're afraid of raves). One friend made me a
deal that if I go with him to a club , that he'll go with me to more raves.


Thanks in advance. . .

I must put my two .02 cents here..... not only was it the grooviest music
I've heard in a looooong time but it was also one of those evenings where
you get to make eye contact with everyone on the dancefloor!  People were
smiling, dancing, screaming, and having an all out incredible time.  For
such a small weekly....  I was quite taken! Dj Toby was on first and spun
some great deeeep house to get things warmed up and then Dj Daniel finished
the night off with an INCREDIBLE set of house/trance/crazy
shit-that-dances-your-body-into-another-dimension! If you are ever in the
south bay on a Thursday night or you are willing to make the trek to San
Jose...  you must catch this party!  Nice visuals, friendly vibes, great 
ventilation, and it's cheap (free before 10 and $3 after).  I know that
they are planning a Halloween party for next Thursday, anyone need a ride
from Cal-Train or from Sunnyvale/Mt View area?

Hope to see some of you south bayers there next week
(Larry, Mark, Darrell, Starchild, Brendan, you know who YOU are!)

I'm curious about something.  Usually on Fridays the people of the list 
will start posting their plans for the weekend, and give a discription of 
what they'll be wearing that goes something like this:

5'7" brown hair, blue eyes, White Addida's shirt, purple stripped pants, 
green shoes with white pokadots.....ect.........

Has anyone ever found a member of sfraves by rembering how they discribed 
themselfs on the list (other than the group that dress as Crayola 
Crayon's, they are pretty easy to spot)?

just wonderin'

Well, my first SF rave will be this weekend's Halloween Tribal Massive.  
I doubt I'll get to meetany of you fine people since it IS a massive, but 
just in case... here's my description

	I gotta big nose and brown eyes, shaved brown hair, 6'2" tall.  

	I'll be wearing dark blue baggy jeans (levi silver tabs)

	most noticeable 'should' be my berret.  It is red, and is the 
only one I've ever seen with the badge still attached.  the badge is 
metal, and has and oak leaf with a masonry bridge on top of it.  German 
flag at the bottom (black, red, yellow).  That badge is over my left eye.

	I dunno about my shirt...I'll try to coordinate  :)  

	

	BTW, Brighton Ski resort in Salt Lake just got 4 feet of freshie!

I'm there!  I am oh so there!  I gotta board, gotta board, gotta board...

							SOON
=)

	Thanks for such an informative and very pertinant post.  I (and
many of my friends) were not aware of the complete story.  Reinforces the

Ok, tonight I met this chick down at the palladium. The music pretty much
sucked (I swear that half was on the Best of Techno Vol.3). I don't know
what it was exactly but this girl really really cought my eye and seriously
attracted me to her. Her name was Andrea, she had a Yellow jersey (long
sleeve) with white stripes down the arms, a Goodyear jacket on, and a
backpack(yellow or red) with Elmo hanging out of the back of it. She said
she was going to FTT. I can't make it though.

        Now. . . I would super-way-totally-extra-appreciate it if whoever
goes to FTT, looks for this girl with Elmo in her backpack and gives her a
message for me. I don't know if it'd be easier to just print this out and
give it to her or if you'd like to just tell her some things for me? I will
owe whoever a lot for doing this. It's important to me and I hate myself for
not getting her number when I was there. I don't want her body or nuthin, I
just feel strongly attracted to her, and I want to get to know her better.

Now here's a message:

Andrea. . .
        Hey girly, my name is Aryck, you met me last night, I was wearing a
striped long sleeve shirt and a grey hat at the palladium. I really regret
not getting your number at that time, but I felt that you'd figure that I
was just hitting on you or something. PLEASE call me at (510) 276-3743 and
talk to me, or at least leave your number on my machine so I can call you
back. I liked how you danced, I liked how you talked, and I loved your
smile. I just want to talk to you in hopes of getting to know you a little
better because I'd really be missing out on something important if I didn't.
So please call me soon. . . 

hugz

Aryck

ANd if you don't print this out and give it to her, can you just give her my
name and number and tell her I met her at the palladium last night and I
really wanted to talk to her. . . 


Thanks tons. . . .
If someone does this for me, I'll owe them somethng. . . 


Aryck

Don't forget to also check out http://www.dolekemp96.org.  There is a lame
tax-table thing in there to calculate your tax savings under the Dole tax
plan!  Pretty funny!  Also there are several bitmap/wallpapers for Windows
(also for MAC; guess Dole did not want to alienate MAC users!) available
there for download.  "Decorate your computer today", says Dole.  Heh!!!

There is also a realaudio clip.  Good grief.

I wouldnt admit to going to the palladium if I was being tortured. Now
that I've said that I did go there once just 'cause I was curious. I had
to leave after a couple of hours as I was starting to feel like throwing
up. That place sux.

Hello Ethan,

Maureen here.  Question, in the event that Phoenix and I are able to get 
tickies today, would you like me to bring my alien as part of the ambience.
She was the flourescent 'beauty' welcoming folks into Gateway's 
Stonehedge at Burning Man.  I have my own 4' black light, 100' cable, 
power strip, etc. and she is fairly easy to set up.  She stands about 7' 
tall.  Let me know as soon as possible.  

If yes, while we are in the east bay getting tickets, I could set her up 
beforehand...  Thanks and

~~peace

Maureen
415-459-5334

P.S.  Recently in the November WIRED, she was part of the photo montage!
       :)  !!!!!

I have to say I used to post my description a lot, and I've had LOTS of
really wonderful people come up and introduce themselves to me because of
it ....

Now, I'm pretty easy to find in a crowd, since I'm older, and since I have
distinctive tattoos, wear lots of silver bracelets, and since I'm usually
wearing some crazy hat ....

So I think it's a great idea to post your description before a party ....
but only if there's something about your attire or appearance that's really
memorable...  I know I'll remember something about a shirt that says
something or an odd hat, and I'll go up and ask someone if they're on SFR
....  my favorite post was the person who said they were wearing (among
other things) contact lenses and calvin underwear ... who was that???

Tonight you'll see me at FnF as the Fairy RaveMother ..... so you betta
come say hi!!!  I'll grant you your wish if you do!

Leslie

OK, Melissa and Kristofer, so where is RHTHYM at? I go to Velvet Shop
about every other week on Thursday nights, and that's not too
bad. It's at Hi-Fi/Scalawaggs on 2'nd near Santa Clara in downtown San
Hose.

Thanks for the excellent neurochemical explanation.  One word of caution,
however: if you take Prozac, DO NOT take an MAO inhibitor (most other
antidepressents are MAO inhibitors) with it...it can cause adverse
reactions like madness, death, etc.

Wow!

 The trance party with Goa Gil really shook my world. I probably danced 
more, felt more good energy and witnessed the unfolding of reality in far 
more profound ways then I can easily recall. Where to start?

 Major thanks to Hunab-Ku and CCC. Not only for bringing Goa Gil to us 
before he left for India, but for the _amazing_ decorations (Blacklight 
banners). It was another space removed from the world.

 We started a bit late (partially my fault) but from the first beat the 
vibe _never_ let up. 

 Goa Gil and Adam (who was likewise stunning and motivational!) were in 
the upstairs room. Downstairs the sound system was tied to the one 
upstairs. At first I thought this an unusal setup but it worked great. I 
helped with audio downstairs and brought my slides. I'll leave it to 
someone else to describe but suffice to say I was thrilled at how the 
downstairs turned out.

 At one point I was downstairs and trance dancing so hard my nipples 
started tingling. Not a little bit but A LOT! I had so much pleasure 
running through my body and the wierd thing was that my dancing was 
impressing me (more difficult than the smartalecks may think) a lot also. I 
was just so loving surfing and riding on the sound and literally being 
lifted into the air at the most perfect moments; ahh bliss. =)

 One strange thing was that it became hot and muggy on both floors, but 
rather than it bothering me I really enjoyed it. I kinda felt like a 
tadpole dancing in the water.

 Big thanks to all the very kind and wonderful people I was fortunate 
enough to talk with! Especially standing out was Erika and Liza (sp?). 
These folks shared a lot of quality time with me and I was loving every 
moment ;) Also big hug to James who really went beyond the call of duty 
to help me out =) Marrisa who helped with set up (GREAT tunnel!!) and 
clean up; you probably won't read this but thank you.

 Thank you Hunab-Ku and CCC for allowing me to work/play with you. "It 
can only get better!" =)

 Thank you Goa Gil (and ADAM!! =) for giving me my first/strongest 
exposures to trance. I feel like I've come home.


Healing love vibes to all of you,

I'm gonna have to agree with you on that one. It's going to be PHAT!

Dan might be a hero for a lot of SF people, and YES I WILL TRY TO LISTEN
IN ON HIS SET, but I would happily pay just to hear the god of acid techno,
JOSH WINK. Not to mention all the fab UK acts. You better not miss out on
Springheel Jack, a pretty brilliant debut album if you can stand anything
with a breakbeat. ;)

If you feel you would want to meet this Swede, look for a tall, dark, and
uhm...tall guy with a shaved head. I'll be wearing beige pants and a navy-
blue tee with some arrows and stuff on it. Come up and say hi or whatever!

possibly i have been lucky .. but i was taking Luvox, which is a similar 
drug to Prozac, for two years and never had any trouble taking e as 
well.  As a matter of fact, the first e hangover i ever had was this 
summer AFTER i had stopped taking Luvox.  Maybe there will be some 
long-term results, but i never noticed any immediate adverse effects.  
Mind you, i was taking only 50mg of Luvox a day.

I wouldn't recommend taking anything like Prozac just to have fun 
anyways.  It does NOT make you happy and perky when you first take it; 
that takes about three weeks to kick in :) the first night i began taking 
Luvox i found that i felt so unlike my usual self it was uncomfortable ..

I've been on Prozac for about two years now, and have taken MDMA several
times.  The only thing I've noticed is that the Prozac tends to counteract
the E.

Hey everybody. I do a mostly-jungle-but-also-ambient-dance-techno-whatever 
show on KZSU 90.1fm every Sunday morning from 9am to 11am. It's a bit of

As luck would have it, getting to Drop Beat at 4:15 turned out
to be too late.  So if anyone has a spare ticket, preferably 2,
to spare, give me a call at 1-800-474-2355, extension 6253.
Leave the message urgent (press #, then 2 when finished) and
I'll get back to you.

(I want to dance my ass of in my burlap tonight! :-) )

Thanks, and peace.

If anyone has heard any rumors about the location of FnF I would trully 
appreciate knowing.  If it's in the city there is no problem but if its out of 
the city it's a big problem as I have no way of getting out of the city.  I may 
have an extra ticket as a bribe in the case of the later.  Any info?

I don't know if this is a very good idea; some MAO inhibitors' PDR 
data say that combining them with a sympathomometic amine can cause 
a stroke.  Dying of a stroke can ruin your whole evening.

OUR OWN LITTLE SOAP OPERA!!!

Will Aryck ever find Andrea?  (Doesn't being smitten SUCK!!)  Will she

serious conversation?

I, for one, am interested in following this little story.  Please keep us

What happened?  I was there around 3:00pm, beautiful day, good music, and
there will all of about ten people there (not counting tourists).  Just
interested as why nobody showed up.  Excuses, theories.

And my heart goes out to Spacechildren, because to me it is always a bit
sad when a party doesn't happen, for whatever reasons.

Hi everyone

As FnF appears to be in the East Bay I need a ride.  I have an extra ticket if 
you need that or gas and food money.  I live at SF State but can get anywhere in 
the city if allowed enough time.  If I don't get a response by 9:50 I will not 
be going and will have 2 tickets up for grabs.  If you want the tickets call me 
@ 415-406-4133 but not before 9:50.  If you can give me a ride call the same 
number.

I showed up around 4:30pm....it was really cool.  Even though there 
weren't alot of ppl there, the music was "on" and ppl were dancin.  
Actually it reminds me of what we do in Atlanta's Peidmont Park on 
Sundays after the party.

Peace out to Spacechildren....even the sound was phat.

*peace*

(sorry, a little long!)

Hey, I get the dubious honor of the first post on a tragedy that's enough 
to make even the happiest raver sad...

The busting of FnF!!

I sit here, totally hyped up at 2am, all glittered up and nowhere to go, 
with an SO who's falling asleep on me.  This goes beyond disappointment.

*sigh* 
My first FnF, back in April?95 at the Acme - you all remember this - got 
busted at 2am.  That night turned into a wild adventure of finding 
another party, with my extended group of _15_ ending up at several 
different places, including a superunderground and superproduced 
Dimension 7 party, and a mysterious garage behind someone's house - maybe 
some of you know it - that had been completely redone into a perfect 
chill room.  Congos, stereo, fur, trippy art... and 30 strangers in an 
e-pile.  

No such luck tonight.

Nothing else would do for me right now anyway.  I'm  hyped for a FRIENDS 
AND FAMILY party.  And, as I've been doing all day, tripping on the fact 
that there are HUNDREDS of us out there, all brimming with excitement all 
day, people getting to DropBeat _two_ hours early to camp out for tix, 
the people after the bust dancing in the parking lot, refusing to have 
their spirit vanquished.

300 tix sold out in 15 minutes, sold early because the line was so long 
there was no reason to wait til 4 (btw, when I got there!)  And I know 
hundreds more wanted to go - some newbies that members of our family felt 
should be introduced in the best way possible, many happy ravers, maybe some 
randoms.

Which leads me to question, where is the line drawn between an 
"underground" and a "massive"?  Is it simply the size, 600 versus 3000?  
Or is it the fact of commercialism versus a family party?  FnF's have 
always been small to maintain the vibe.  But there were 600 unbelievably 
excited people with tickets tonight, and I would bet another 600 who 
wanted to go, for the right reasons.

WE create Friends and Family (with all props and respect here to the 
people who actually throw it with endless hard work, energy and LOVE!) - 
but I mean WE CREATE the phenomenon that occurs with what we bring to the 
party.  Our anticipation and our participation in the party becomes a 
great group funnel of energy, creating what we desire.

So, if the miracle occurs based on the intentions of all the 
participants, does the NUMBER of participants matter?  Does a party truly 
reach a "saturation point" when you have so many people that you cannot 
get a universal vibe?  That with so many, there will be at least a few 
who will do their part to bring the vibe down? (stealing, unfriendliness, 
etc.)  If everyone who wanted tickets for tonight went, I bet you 
anything it would GO OFF as hard as always - maybe that much more amazing.

But this is all academic without spaces.  (And without $$$ for permits).  

And the ironic thing is, after all our dissing on FTT, you know all of 
them are partying their asses off right now!  Massives do have one thing 
over undergrounds: mucho money to pay off all the necessary parties.

*sigh*
Better luck next time, kids!
We WILL party
They can't stop us

MAO INHIBITORS: are bad news. they are an old type of anti-depressant that
have nasty cross drug synergistic problems. they work by increasing the
amount of catecholamines (dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine) and
serotonin (the main neurotransmitter E works on) in the brain. because MAOIs
act on such a huge range of neurotransmitters they have a lot of side
effects. So for the most part doctors do not prescribe them at all to anyone.
One deadly drug combo is MAOI and tricyclics (another older type of
antidepressant), so that could be bad. And thus i suppose since E does
similar things that the tricyclics do MAOI and E could also be a sad
experience. BUT im not a doctor.

peace, and gosh, dont it SUCK that fnf got busted!!

well, see you all at sunset!

Maybe one should wait to see if a party is busted or not before doing 
speed.  Otherwise, one may have nothing to do but sit at a computer all 
night, and send really long messages.

MY FIRST PARTY
The whole thread of massives vs. undergrounds reminded me that most 
people filter through the massives FIRST before reaching the 
underground.  They get a taste of something tantalizing, and search 
harder and harder for its purest form.  The massives help form the 
underground, because a person coming from massives has to work to find 
the UG, to, in a sense, "prove themselves" and what they're about.

Sometimes I think my newbies - who I introduced at the best UG parties - 
had it too easy.

Obviously, we in the UG get too arrogant, actually robbing ourselves of 
potential enjoyment because of biases against big parties.  My first 
party was a massive - and a kinda crappy one at that, Kundalini at 
Caesar's Palace - and I remember how enthralled I was all those first few 
months, going to the biggest massives every weekend.  I had a complete 
blast.  Then I moved to UG parties and found a million faults with the 
commercial parties, by comparison.  In finding what was "real" and 
"good," I lost the ability to fully enjoy something, and instead 
prejudice took its place - a value I did not think the UG would impart.

Just something I find ironic that I wanted to share.  

But maybe it's just that when everything's new, and you've just fallen in 
love, you don't notice the faults.  As the relationship continues, you 
have to learn how to live with it, beyond the honeymoon.  You see the 
entire scene with clearer vision, and become choosy about the 
characteristics that you want.

All I know is that massives are pretty much ruined for me, and I'm not 
sure how I feel about that.

Definite highs and lows.  FnF: what a bummer, especially since I, on my own
with no guarantee of any where or how to pass the night, made the hard
choice and decided for the long trip home.  Which means probably no Sunset
for me either (too much time on the road for one weekend).  Sigh...I did so
want to make a marathon weekend of it--been a while.  (But then, we just
gained an hour, didn't we?  Hmm.)

On the upside, Lunar Seed rocked so hard I'm still vibrating from head to
toe.  Hats off to Gil and everyone else who made that party happen.

I'll sum it up in two words: JOSH WINK. The man's a fucking genius,
the way he played with his turntables this morning was just brilliant.
Finishing off with Brand Nubian "Punks Jump Up to Get Beat Down" (a
hiphop classic for those who didn't know), the Prodigy's "Molotov 
Bitch" and "Poison" before the grand finale..."Higher State of 
Consciousness"! And damn did we want to hear that! =)

As far as the rest of Tribal Massive was concerned, it was just that,
MASSIVE. Starting with the line outside (about 50% longer than the
one to Ground Zero, but without the "Girls up front, guys stay in
the line"-bullshit...), massive beats, massive location (HomeBase!),
and so on.

When we got in at 11 (after adjusting our clocks for daylight savings
time), I moved straight into the house-room. And it was Clubland UK
revisited.  Heard Terrance Toy, David Harness, Wamdue Kids, Jay J, and
Marcus Wyaat spin some wonderful house. The records they spun had
everything you'd want in house, soul and beat. =) And we got to hear
Alcatraz's "Give Me Luv" twice. And my favorite house record of all
times, "Plastic Dreams" from Jaydee. 
	
Then, at 4, it was straight into the FTT room to hear and see JOSH WINK.
Like I said, the man's a genius. And DJ Sneak, who took over the wheels
after JW, was just as good. Techno at it's best. At 6:45am he was told to
turn the music off, but the house room (Organic Garden) had now progressed
into ACIDland with Barry Weaver(?) spinning some fat tunes. Especially the
one he finished off with. =)

reespect, jonas

P.S. I was the guy with the glow-in-the-dark spiral on his head. Best place
to find me? Right in front of the DJs. =)

*been a silent lurker on the list for quite awhile but i just had to 
speak up*
hallo i'm lara. nice 2 meet u *shake hand*
enough of that bullshit...
i too was at Halloween Tribal Massive... but i didn't get around to 
seeing josh wink or barry weaver or dj dan or any of them, i spent the 
whole time, dancing (bouncing?) my ass off in Planet of the Drumz to 
some phat jungle and drumnbass
	i was skeptical about going to HTM coz of the rumor that it was gonna 
get broken up, the whole "LIVE 105" deal, the fact it was at HOMEBASE 
*again*, the fact that i partied too hard the night before, etc... but 
once i made my way into Planet of the Drumz, i had died and gone to 
heaven
playing jungle like "code red - conquering lion" and then drumnbass like 
j majik's arabian nights, the room was full of diverse music, but 
everyone danced no matter what. 
	love jungle live jungle and well i met some really beautiful junglists 
there who kept me smiling the whole night through (not to say the music 
didnt do the trick but there were some serious positive vibes going on 
in that room)... didn't FEEL like a massive party to me, felt like i was 
with family... guess its all a part of the fact that *whine moan 
complain* there aren't as many jungle events as us junglists would like 
to be. 
	and might i add hardly a time when we can hear DJ SS and DJ Rap (who 
kicked SERIOUS ass)  and dieselboy (he kicked ass too) all in one night 
LIVE :> *delicious*
	who was i? uuhh well i was in front of the speakers all night, wearing 
a baggy silver shirt and even baggier pants with silver stripes down the 
legs.. o yea and you mighta seen my REALLY short bleached pigtails 
bouncing around when i was dancing.. either that or my huge grin...
	anyway thanks to everyone in that room who kept me smiling and gave me 
confidence that YES there are other junglists out there... i had a great 
night and i don't think it will be topped any time soon :>
back to your regular programming, i'm off to lurk some more...maybe...
lara
p.s. any junglists out there?? :P
p.p.s. sorry if any of you think this e-mail was wasted bandwidth, i 
just HAD to say SOMETHING about the night :> take care!

I agree it was a powerful evening!  After asking a promoter, and then a 
few people that worked the event I came with the figure of 7500 people!

You didn't mention the incredible JUNGLE presence - which is where I spent
most of my awe-struck time - I saw the first lady of jungle, DJ Rap who is
as beautiful as the pounding junglist beats she was dropping for us. 
Those kids from the UK know what is up!  I've been to so many events it's
almost on the edge of losing it's magic, but that was a beautiful night I
won't soon forget!
Now where can I hear more jungle, and in particular the smoother oceanic 
and ambient jungle....
love and respect,
Max

Okay, the first location was busted. And there were a lot of very
upset people... a lot of people who worked really hard to put together
such a positive, beautiful event. Some were even stifling tears as they
wrapped things up.

But instead of going home and ending the night, defeated, the words of
"...call the voicemail..." buzzed around the parking lot... So we
partied in the parking lot, waiting for an update on the voicemail
(someone had a car radio and mix tapes, so we danced on the asphalt :)

Then the word came from Patrick: "hey, anyone want to go to a party
tonight?  *the* party?" They had a space!!!! And it was in... um,
Redwood City? well, uh... okay!

I couldn't believe it! But then, maybe I could:

There was too much positive energy for this party *not* to happen. We
all wanted it to happen. Everyone wanted it to happen. And the Oakland
police weren't going to be the people to stop us.

This night is what it's all about. This party is the reason *why* I'm
a raver. Thank you so much to all of our wonderful friends and to all
of the special people on our scene. Thank you for gathering our family
together despite the circumstances.

Damn, that was the *best* party I've ever been to.

Steve

Max Vision had this to say:

>I agree it was a powerful evening!  After asking a promoter, and then a 
>few people that worked the event I came with the figure of 7500 people!

That might be a little too high a number, but HomeBase sure WAS packed. 
Packed in a positive way though, the vibe was great, at least in the rooms 
where I spent my time. =)

>You didn't mention the incredible JUNGLE presence - which is where I spent

Well, I'm sorry if anyone felt left out. The reason I didn't mention Planet
of Drumz was that jungle, to me, is DEAD. But that does not make me look down
on Junglists, and it shouldn't stop anyone who feels differently about it
from enjoying what they like. =)

reespect, jonas

indeed, FnF Take 2 was truly fabulous. those of us who waited in the
parking lot felt the vibe increasing and increasing... i met more people
in that parking lot than i probably would have met all night had the party
not been busted.

by the time the new location was announced, we were all having a great
time anyway. we packed up and quickly headed into redwood city, found the
space, transformed it into a great rave space, and partied till... well, i
left at 9:30 am and the music was still going.

there was _magic_ in the air. perfect crowd. perfect vibe. i had the time
of my life. met a lot of _really_ cool people. gave and received more hugs
than ever before.

a big thank you to the FnF crew and all my "friends and family" for making
this night possible. i'll never forget it.

full of love,

brian

Hi all!

 I hope everyone had a good time wherever they ended up last night. I 
wanted to go to FnF so badly but burned out at Lunarseed and I have to 
write that paper for class on monday...

 I need to thank a few more from Lunarseed; Brian Darkness whose kindness 
really set the mood for my night, Dhiran (sp?) and Brandon (sp?) for the 
aweful job of carrying heavy stuff after the party was over, as well as 
other folks who did the same whose names escape me know.

 Onward!

 I have two partys coming up that I need help with. On Nov. 1st is Mantra 
in SF and on Nov. 16th is A Wrinkle In Time also in SF.

 Mantra:

 I need to get to SF early on Friday Nov. 1st (1 pm or so). Once I'm 
there with my equipment the driver is free to go. Will want to leave 
SF about 9 or 10 am the next day. I can swing with a different driver 
going back, however the vehicle needs to be a medium sized pickup (or 
van) or bigger, both ways. Will pay for gas and you get in free (free chai 
afterparty!!) In addition I would like to have at least one to three 
volunteer workers who likewise get in for free. You only need to commit 
to either set up OR tear down. Obviously set up will be as close to 1 pm 
Friday as possible. We should be done in plenty of time to relax, eat 
dinner and clean up before the party.


 A Wrinkle In Time:

 Arrival time, in SF, is not set yet but again should be early on 
Saturday. If possible we may set up some the Friday evening before. 
Again, I need a driver(s) for getting there and back. If neccessary we 
will pay for gas but this is a benefit for Omar and his family and every 
dollar saved goes towards them.
 I will need a bigger vehicle as I'm bringing my audio system also. Again 
the driver needs only to commit to driving as that is a lot to ask someone 
(IMHO). If there are any who would like to crew also (in addition to the 
hordes that have already volunteered) please contact me. We will be 
leaving SF sometime around 10am ish.

 Additional note; I live in Santa Cruz and give prefrence (of crew 
choice) to those who have worked with me before (for various reasons) 
and those who contact me first.

 Both events promise to be _Immense_ fun!!! =)

 On transportation; I will consider smaller vehicles if we have enough to 
get all the equipment moved (caravan style). Hatchbacks work well.

 Sorry for spamming the list with my needs and my appreciation to those 
tempted to flame me but havn't! ;)




peace y'all,

Hey, fellow Berkeleyites:

I'd like to start a phone tree that we could use to find rides, etc.

Please drop me an email with your number, area that you live in, and 
whether you have a car, and I'll compile a list for everyone.  

Only Berkeley, or close areas (North Oak, Albany)
:) :)

Oh, my gawd!
I say again,
oh, my gawd!

My first Friends and Family last night was just awesome!  A bummer that 
the Oakland police showed up, yes, but I met so many incredible people in 
between that and the massive caravan to Redwood City.

...And Redwood City boomed last night!

I'm so stoked to have met so many SFRavers, too, putting faces with 
names.  Hi to Rick, Marcy, Wayne, Mike, Amy, Alex, Aniska (sp), and all 
the other cool froods out there.  Thanks to the FnF folks and everyone 
there last night.  It's a night I won't soon forget!

peace and love,

This was absolutely, positively, the most beautiful celebration I have ever
experienced.

Against all odds, this party that was so meant to happen finally happened,
and when it did, it perfectly achieved what every party always hopes to be.
It was truly a magical event.

If I had to sum it up in one word : PURE

Had to park about a mile away for the Home Base Warehouse.  Almost got 
hit by 6 speeding cop cars while crossing the street, Dont think I ever 
saw the end of the line.  Decided it wasnt worth it to wait in said line. 
 Sold our tickets, ran into a group of Oakland residence carrying rocks 
yelling something to the effect of "we're going to bash his head in."  
Walked the mile back to the car, drove home, smoked a bowl, went to sleep.

Shoulda tried harder for FnF Tix.

Sorry for the bandwidth, but last week someone posted that they are
looking for a web page designer.  Who are you? After I deleted the
message, I got a call from a friend looking for more work, in web design.
Please e-mail me or RHOLLIN@aol.com.  Thanks!

peace and laughter-

Hi....

Here's a rather strange rave report.....    Yesterday,   while at Elevator
records,  I pick up this flyer for a "Free rave" valled MDMYeah....

Lineup was "Donayan, Slinky,  Temple, Bung Ho, and more...",  so the
flyer said....

I was undecided as to whether or not to trek up into LA alone,  being
very unfamiliar with the geography and the venues,  so I decided to
stay down in San Diego and check it out.     I learned it was way out
near the US/Mexico border on this private ranch next to a state prison.

So I tried to pin-point the location with maps.yahoo.com and got totally
confused because the highways had different numbers.   Yahoo didn't have
hiway 905 East,  but I eventually found it....   and as I was heading
East on hiway 905,  seeing all these warning signs of the approaching
border,  I decided to get a little paranoid and almost started to
turn back when I found this standard station.  I pulled in and learned
that other ravers have asked for directions.

So,  was told to go out to the state prison,  and eventually found the
turn-off just 1/2 mile before the border checkpoint and sure enough,
i see this dude waving a light stick....   I pull into this dirt road
and found the party.

Not that many people were there,  as it was about 2 am when I arrived,
and perhaps about 20 - 30 people were there totally.    Music was good
Detroit house,  and the dj that followed,  mixed it up with house
and trance (and even Josh Wink's laughing track)....  It was quite
surreal,  dancing next to this big imposing state prison,  wondering
if anyone inside could hear the music.   Seeing a distinct line of lights
marking the US/Mexico border.

No police arrived,   but border patrol was everywhere....    Eventually,
things closed down about 4:30 am and I eventually made it back to the Loft.

They plan on having more parties there,  and the owner of the land is
a really cool person....  the ranch has horses and hogs,  and I stayed
for a while to bullshit with this ranch hand with what little Spanish
I know....

So,  be on the lookout for more of these parties,  but bring warm
clothes,   or plan on dancing all the time like I did to keep warm....

Although the event was promoted poorly,  I think with good promotion,
a lot more people would show up.    The DJ's were unknown but
really good.

I enjoy these smaller,  more underground parties,  then the larger
massives.     So how was YOUR weekend....  Any reports...

Crunchman

Friends and Family,

I would just like to give Phat Props to all those involved with the
organization of the party last nite!  I know that the whole crew wasn't
involved for this party, but those who did put in the time and effort for the
short time the party went on I had a blast!!!!! 

All I know, for the hour or two that I was there, I was having the time of my
life!  I mean most of the people hadn't even arrived yet, and the vibe was
still going off!  I mean people were screamin' on the dance floor, and give
phat hugz in the chill room!  I wish the Po' Po' hadn't busted the party,
which by the way was the most dangerous thing they could've done anyway, but
I won't get into that!  I hope none of you who organized the party got in any
sort of trouble! 

I also want to thank those at the Funcky Techno Tribe's Tribal Massive, who
let my friends and I into the party for free!  It was fun, although they were
a SHIT LOAD of people there!  I'm talkin' mad crazy people there!

Well I hope everyone else found something to do after the party got busted,
'cause I know a lot of people who were really stressin' at that point!  Take
care and I hope everyone has a wonderful week!

Your Friend,

Antone!

If anyone recovers my small tortiseshell prescription glasses and/or black
phone book with photos inside from this event, pls let me know.  Only
strippers lose glasses...did I undress in someone's car and can't remember?

And while we're on the subject, great party, especially mobile group!  The
"transition" added drama but deducted space and winnowed out some less-hardy
ravers.  We had a great moonlit dancing session to the fun Seattle couple's
car stereo while waiting.  And the wait was well worth it as no one lost
spirits and once those speakers were connected across the bay BOOM no one
couldn't dance!  Thanks to people on the list who recognized my 3 yr. old
SFR artwork tee shirt and introduced yourselves, I appreciate that.   Peace
and love to all those up-lifters I have been brought into contact with.  xo

Well I made it to FTT last night. Even though I was not quite in the
dancing mood for some reason, and that first hit of E grounded me to the
concreat. I still had a good time.
BUT! I got alot of bad vibes from a certiant group of people.

I was wearing that bright red sweat jacket, and the black addidas pants
with red stripes. And thoughs silver sun glasses on my head. And I had that
skellitor look in the morning.
I sweat way to much! All the cells in my face lose water, and shrival up.

I don't appreciate the bad vibes. But I can't really blame these people for
perceiving me in a bad way. I know that the way I can act sometimes, can be
perceived in a bad way. But I can't help myself. It's who I am. Atleast
when I am on E at 3:00 in the morning!
I won't go into detail. It won't do no good, only worse.

Sometimes it sucks being me. But I wouldn't want to be anyone else.
Jeff

Well, buddy-
I had your e-mail in my back pocket, but I didn't meet her (I don't think).
My roommate and I thought it would be so romantic if like 10 people gave your

I guess it'll just have to be in the universe's hands.

I'm sorry to hear about FnF. We had a great time at FTT. I busted a move more
times than I can I can recall. It was good to be out breakin it down with
some great tracks. Kudos to all of the Djs... WELL DONE!

I might have to get a great big funky hat to wear until I finally hook up w/
my fellow sfr's. It feels so weird to me to rave with only three or four
people in my party. I still had fun, though.

Have a good week everyone! Take your vitamins and be good to yourselves!!

I am **SO** glad I didn't take off right away after the first space was 
busted.  We held out and were soon on our way to Redwood City.  There 
were probably less than 150 people at the second space, but the vibe we 
created was cosmically *huge*!!

The music was superb.  Then it was complete magic when Deaks took the 
decks and I danced my ass off til 8 in the morning (and that was BEFORE 
the time switch!)

No need to go into detail - words cannot describe that wonderful party.  
Wayne did sum it up into one very eloquent word: PURE. 

thank you, thank you!:):)

  What can i say? A phat party from the moment I got in till when we left.
Variety of music.  House, Tekno-Progressive, Jungle, Trip-Hop, even a
band.  Well thought out and planned lightings and decorations. Solid.
  
DJ Highlights:
 DJ Rap - Amazing!! When she put on that one song sampling that R&B
lyrics, we all went through the roof. (anyone know the name of that
song?)Amazing.  Deiselboy and the other jungle djs were amazing also.
  The house room kicked it with the soulful jams all night long. JJ''s set
was my high-point in there.
  The main room was a total rave vibe in effect.  Dan, Grame, Sneak and 
Wink were all solid.  The trip hop room also rocked the joints in full 
effect!
  My personal contribution to the party was when the lights kept getting
unplugged in the jungle room i found out where the plugs came undone
and put them back together. =)

  amazing party.  one of my favorite large parties on any coast.

peace and see you at the Gathering ;)

WOW...I am still glowing...I knew it was going to be a good day when I
woke up saturday around 1:30 pm after spending all night in the computer
lab so that I could go to FnF, when I woke up and had teh fattest smile on
my face after finding out tickets were on sale right up the street from my
house. So I put on my headphones and rode my bike up to the spot to get
there a little early. Rifing up there I feel like peewee herman in his big
adventure, grooving along to the funky beats in my headphones...the
FATTEST smile on my face, I wanted to ask someone to wipe it off because
my cheeks were hurting! There was soooo much energy happening saturday!!
	SO I get my tickets and come home glowing, and finally my roomate
si started to get buzzed off of my energy and decides that he wants to
go...did I doubt it...!So Im wondering who I should go as...Ineed a
costume, anyway, I got all excited and shaved my hair off, so my official
costume for the night was the bald guy! I guess there are a lot of us,
although I never really noticed that until last night!
	So I finally meet up with Mike and we go to the location and check
it out...the place was set up sooo rad!! major huge props to everyone that
set up the place especially the cool decorations under the parachute,
beautiful. 
	After this the party starts taking off and everything goes into
maximum overdrive until the cops show up...it seems that since FTT payed
the oakland PD 7000 bucks for security that it just wasnt fair that FnF
didnt have to pay as well, so in the interest of bearocratic fairness
we were shut down, its a good thing too, anyone could plainly see that the
FnF party was a tragedy waiting to happen...you know unruly
crowd(violently smiling and hugging eachother), dangerous weapons (hard
hitting beats and bone crushing vibe) someone might have sprained an
ankle!!!!...it was for our own good.
	so after the initial dissapointment, the general feeling was fuck
that, we are gonna go off tonight no matter what! resonance... confusion!
from the many rumors I heard people were trying to find a place that could
accomodate everyone but it just wasnt possible, and finally around 2:00
(but really around 1:00 daylight savings ya know) we were offered a space
but it was not very big...unfortunate for all the people that were waiting
for the voicemail, but there was really no other way as far as I can
see...
	MUCHO MUCHO props to the fnf crew for breaking down and setting up
so fast and perfectly! The new space was incredible!!!! once the music
started again, slip into maximum overdrive and dance dance dance!!!! I
dont think I stopped all night...it was so beautiful, such an amazing
release of energy so many good smiles and viberations on the floor. Really
quite an amazing experience for me. This was kind of my first party where
i made an effort to meet and connect with people, usually I just want to
find my groove on the dance floor and slip into it for the night and go
home refreshed. But this was different and incredible I met so many
amazing people and it was soooodifferent dancing with people that you are
connected/connecting with on the floor...so many smliles hugs ahhh im
feeling all gushy again!! many many props to the girl from seattle (lori?)
spreading soo much good feelings throughout...I wish i could say hi to
each and every sfraver that I met last night but, I just dont think that I
will remember everyone, but you are all in my heart and much to my
surprise none of you were weird freaks...well maybe a few
were...smile!!!!;-)))) 
	I do want to thank brendan 99 for introducing me to a million
sfravers and Tony rotundo for hooking me up with a much needed early
morning heineken and the whole crew that put so much effort into this
party...I hope to be able to give back some day all that I recieve from
all of you beautiful people.

tony "there is no life before early morning gabber" rose

:-)))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))

Dear Nancy & SFRavefriends,

	Excellent posts, Nancy... I was also in that garage you speak of
after Friends & Family back in April '95.  I couldn't have told you when
that was or after which party, but your description matches my memory.  I
think it may have been Noe Valley.  Memorable after-party...
	Regarding massives -- I think as the number of people increases,
the chances of having the kind of pure, joyous vibe we associate with
parties like Friends & Families decreases, but that doesn't mean it can't
happen.  It can, and it can be imho every bit as wonderful as FnF,
Harmony, et. al.
	Regarding arrogance in "the underground" -- even calling ourselves
"the underground" borders on arrogance if we're not careful how
we present ourselves.  Expecting newcomers to "prove themselves" is not,
to my mind, giving the right welcome (not that Nancy was endorsing this).

Much love,

Hi all,

You all heard the news:  FnF was busted Saturday night.  I got there
around 11:00 or so, and I danced for about five minutes before the cops
showed.  It was creepy, but amicable...the cops seemed quite pleased that
they were busting up a rave and not a fight at the infamous Flanker bar
and restaurant next door.  Grrr...

Anyway, the place was packed and loaded up in no time.  My friends and I
didn't want to leave yet...we were there to dance, but mostly we just
wanted to catch up and talk, and when we heard that the party was going to
move somewhere else...we were up for that!

Ethan called everyone to attention and asked for a show of hands to see
how many people were willing to drive to Redwood City to the backup spot.
It was unanimous, we all wanted to go.  Then Derek gave us all directions
to his shop, where he restores motorcycles.

When we got to the space, I thought:  err, this is a bit small.  But it
turned out to be the perfect size for the perfect group.

Joe Rice started us off with one of the best sets I've heard him play.
The vibe was intense..better than anything I've felt in a hundred years.

Then Ethan and Deaks played. I danced and danced.  Then I took a nap in a
cosy van outside, until the owner showed up and regretfully kicked us out
because he was leaving.  Thanks, whoever you are!

After that someone was playing some jungle-who was that?  I liked it and
danced some more.  The party was still going strong when we left - around
9 or so.  It was Derrick's birthday party!  Congratulations Derrick on
another year of life completed, and on a new one beginning.  Thank you so
much for sharing it with us!  And for throwing a party in your garage!  It
was like a dream coming true.  

Then Jason (Cinnamon Twist) and I left, after packing up the New Moon
altar.  As I left, the FnF dudes looked pretty fried, but victorious!!

Just so you know, we taped it!  This party will live on into eternity.
The dance goes on...in my car, in my house, in my Sony Walkman.

Love,

Ann

 Just a note here: I have obtained a driver for A Wrinkle In Time (YEA!!).
Still looking for one for Mantra and crew for both shows (see previous 
post for details).

 My apologies for spamming the list.

     My Weekend... (Just felt like sharing)
     
     Friday Night
     
     I had already committed to going to LA, so the news of the FNF party 
     happening was ripping me apart... but I'd been invited to a Moontribe 
     event.  The party was 100% word of mouth, and the location was prime.
     
     45 minutes away from LA, at the base of a well forested valley in the 
     Angeles Crest National Forest.  The drive was mostly easy, except for 
     the oil-pan killing dirt stretch last mile.  Luckily, we were guided 
     by some very nice people and didn't hurt the car.  Me and Todd (my 
     best friend from LA) pulled in parked the car and almost froze to 
     death.  The air was about 45 degrees and dropping.
     
     11:00 PM
     Jackets and hats in tow, we walk to the site and realize... there is 
     no site.  Instead, just a couple people hanging out and enjoying their 
     surroundings in a small clearing about 80 feet by 300 feet.  A couple 
     of the crew start showing up, and we do our best to help set 
     everything up.
     
     1:30 AM
     Energy circle, some 100 people holding hands and centering as the 
     energy builds.  I look around, and right as the circle breaks up, the 
     full moon appears through the clouds.  The first DJ (I think it was 
     Brad) starts up with some Ambient going into a traditional Breakbeat 
     set to get the place moving.  Crowd is slowly growing... energy is 
     immense.. chaotic and frantic.  Swinging arms and big steps as all go 
     off to the hard trance, breaks and acid sounds.
     
     3:30 AM
     Daniel comes on.  For some the best set of the night... some inspired 
     trance and goa, although not including some of the epic build on build 
     on build psychosis I had come to expect from Daniel (or I just got 
     spoiled at F8 last weekend).  Maybe I'm just cranky.  This is peak 
     hour as far as attendance... probably about 400 people.
     
     After a while of this, I realize I am freezing my ass off, so I go 
     back to the car to crash heaterside for a couple minutes.  Needless to 
     say, I enjoy sleep way too much to stick to a couple minutes.
     
     7:15 AM
     I am woken up to the sky turning colors as the sun starts to come up.  
     I walk back to the site and Brian (I think) is spinning probably the 
     most awesome morning set I have ever heard.  A combination of House, 
     Trance, Breaks, Trip Hop, Disco, Garage, Deep House, Progressive 
     House, Electro, TV show themes, and just about everything else shy of 
     Jungle and Hardcore come blasting out of the system.  EVERYBODY is 
     dancing or sitting/dancing and its all BIG smiles.  People on 
     speakers, people coming up and people coming down... the VIBE was so 
     ridiculously good I couldn't stop dancing or taking pictures of all 
     the people there smiling.  The air starts to warm up, and the dark, 
     bundled creatures of the night before start to shed their jacket 
     layers, and it gets even more beautiful.  The clouds are blowing by 
     creating fragile natural visuals, and the wind goes anywhere from none 
     to about 25 miles per hour to keep a crazy energy reminding everybody 
     that we are here as nature's guest.
     
     Another DJ (sorry.. no name) plays a great house, deep house, disco (I 
     usually hate this stuff, but you had to be there...) set till ...
     
     11:00 AM
     Closing circle, ending in a most satisfying group hug... damn damn!  
     Trash bags get handed out and everybody goes to work cleaning up the 
     aftermath of those who can't seem to find trash cans.  A half hour 
     later and the whole place is clean.  As the main sound system's 
     generators run out of gas, over the hill I can hear a renegade sound 
     system blasting jungle... a perfect way to wrap up this party.  I 
     thank the crew for a splendid time, and go listen to the awesome 
     morning mellow drum and bass (Bukem style stuff) for a few before 
     packing up and leaving for home.  Wow.
     
     Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Fu-u-u-u-u-uck.  I'll shut up now.  (wow)
     
     Saturday Night
     
     Heard there was a party with a Hardcore room (ew!), a Jungle room 
     (okay!), and a Trance (yeah!) room.  There were other events going, 
     but we figured this one would be cool and have something for 
     everybody.  So we call... and call.. and call.. and finally get 
     directions to:
     
     A Chinese restaurant in Norwalk (eh?)... yes, hardcore loving ravers 
     all over, with dustmasks, vacuum cleaner hoses and all.  Buffet trays 
     still left out (no food in them though :( ).  Heavy fog, strobe 
     lights, NO ROOM VIBE AT ALL, and tired, over-drugged burnouts 
     everywhere.  The only source of joy seems to be the 200 bpm twitchfest 
     at the speakers where all the hardcore tweakers are piled up.  At 
     least somebody is having fun... and they're so fun to watch!!!
     
     We hang out and hear the party will be moving... good, because I keep 
     wanting to order something as I sit at the red vinyl and brass riveted 
     booths.  So we get the new directions, an old tired warehouse in 
     downtown.  We go...
     
     Surprise!  Big line, nitrous tank outside and only one room here 
     too... luckily they're playing jungle, but it's really heavy 
     hardstep... and nobody seems to be into it.  Well, seeing as there's 
     nobody really dancing, a great big circle forms, and the people at the 
     perimeter of the circle sit down, as the oldskooolerz start to go at 
     one other.  Some pretty slick moves and great fun going back and forth 
     between those who stepped in, and it was a trippy thing to see 
     everybody watching it, rather than dancing themselves.  The venue was 
     still lame however, as there was plain bright white light everywhere.
     
     About a half an hour later, the lights turn off, and the machine gun 
     assault of gabber/hardcore begins again.  The kids in LA freak to this 
     shit, and if you haven't seen it, you should.  The speaker towers on 
     either side of the stage thing get mobbed by twitching ravers 
     thrusting their fists to the music up on the air.  As all this is 
     going on, I can't help but wonder how nice it would be to hear a 
     simple trance set.  Anything slower than 180 bpm would suit me fine 
     though.  I just hadn't had my coffee or something.
     
     Anyway, the promoters promised all the DJ's would play, so I think "in 
     not too long, the angst will die down and they'll bust out with the 
     trance DJ's".  Right about then, the music dies.  Turns out the venue 
     hasn't paid the rent in a while, or something like that.  Anyway, this 
     place gets shut down early, and the crowd seems like they're about to 
     riot, and all this crappy vibe is really starting to get on my nerves, 
     so we pack up and decide to go hit Fresh Produce, an event that looked 
     like a vibey house music party.
     
     We get to Fresh Produce, and it's going pretty good, air filled with 
     sounds of Deep House and the like, and black light and decorations and 
     costumes.  Looks like a cool place to get settled... too bad we got 
     there 20 minutes before it shut down for the night.
     
     I guess this means Denny's... ZZZZZzzzzzz......
     
     Sunday:
     Record shopping at LA's weird ass record stores.  Spent hours in the 
     bargain bin looking for old goodies.  Found some tasty white label 
     trip hop and breakbeat...
     
     All in all, probably the best and worst LA has to offer (in one 
     weekend even!).  I'm glad so many of you had a blast at FNF/FNF 
     relocated.  Wish I could have been here... sorta.
     
     :)
     
     I MISSED YOU!!!
     AndyW
     
     SoCal Promoter warning...
     
     If you are ever in LA, make it a point to miss any event by "Techno 
     Basics".  They were responsible for a fucked up party (see my Saturday 
     review), more than half the DJ's falling through, not delivering shit 
     they promised, bullshit decor (read none), overpriced water, gun 
     packing security that totally harassed some guy for smoking a hand 
     rolled cigarette but let people do nitrous the whole time we were in 
     line, having ravers driving around town at 3:00 while totally fucked 
     up, and after all that, throwing stuff at the audience and just being 
     shitty when people started cheering "refund".  Plus they lie, and they 
     suck and they didn't seem like very nice people.  So there.  I just 
     wanted to hear some trance and jungle like they advertised... is that 
     so wrong?  I'd be happy to discuss this with anybody... but the facts 
     are pretty clear.
     
     Brief record review...
     
     Has anybody heard Nearly God (the new Tricky)?  It's really rough 
     sounding but... overall... dark, funky, too stoney, too amazing.

Yes, although I can't remember who it is now, but when the Orb played live
in SF last time, I found/met a sfraver based on his discription of his clothing.

Geez, I miss moontribe!!-----especially the mornings!

Your description brought it all back for me. Thanks. Glad you had a good
time! Anyone who has a chance to check out a moontribe definitely should. The
vibe at thier gigs is like no other. It's so easy to make friends in the
morning when the sun comes up. It's like you've been charged by the light of
the full moon and cleansed by the start of a new day. You just have to share
it!

the intensity i witness at these parties is like nothing else. the 
dedication, the pure desire to make it happen, and our collective energy 
exploding in finally overcoming the difficulties we encountered.

the cops came, shut us down, and that was just teh beginning...
what happened from then on was simply magical. from about 7oo people who 
wanted to party, downsized to about 2oo or less of those who refused to 
give up, who were dedicated to be together to celebrate... came together 
in that small redwood city space. everyone there wanted to be there with 
intense desire, and that first beat driven thru those tiny speakers moved 
the universe... ->pure divine energy<-
and 15 minutes later the big stacks came on...
		->earth shaking bass<-
and memories were born...

->resonance<-

Another in a long series of really, really intense weekends.  Yikes.
To sum it up:

Space Children: had to leave before they even got set up :(
FnF: got there just as it got busted
FnF II: drool, drool!!  :)
Sunset: beautiful, too bad I was so tired (no sleep for the wicked ;)

  Sleep deprivation can be really fun!!
  I have to say that for me, the best part of FnF was the incredible
charged-up energy of the crowd during the move... when the music first
went back on, and everyone just completely lost it for a whole hour, there
were many dozens of spntaneous group hugs & everyone was screaming,
yelling, bouncing, and the feeling was so incredible!!!  I felt (for the
first time) really comfortable in the packed part of the dance floor... a
mental adjustment - being part of the single organism made up by the
entire crowd, rather than an individual among a mass of other individuals.
Beautiful!
  Deaks capped off my night perfectly with that one hardcore track - very
intense & the perfect way to drive myself into the ground for sleep.
Which was not meant to be, in the end - I just had to stay up and have
wonderful rambling conversations until (and during, and after) sunset.  I
love that warm fuzzy glow everything gets around it when you're totally
exhausted!
  Sunset - danced only a tiny bit, mostly just laid around, hugged,
talked, and napped.  And stared across the bay in disbelief - I *live*
here!!!  I love this part of the world, love the city, love the people &
the feeling & everything, everything about the way my life is going right
now.  I love my adopted family, the SF ravers.  You rule!!
  I love this game!!!!!

You were there?  You know, the Blue Cube has a lot of FnF history behind
it.  I thought it most appropriate that there was post-bust party there.
You see, the Blue Cube was the site of the first FnFs.  No lie.  A guy
named Steve Lerner lived there then.  My friend moved in after Steve.  And
we had had a pre-party there before FnF.

It was a great chill space after.  Funny thing is it got a little X-rated
in there I found out later...

Peace!

uhhhhhh......Words cannot describe it.  Thanks to everyone that was involved,
and to everyone that was there.  The BEST party I've ever been to.  Thanks
also for making my friends first rave so wonderful.

All the sets were amazing, but Deaks was probably my favorite of the night.

Those Seattle people, Arlin and Lori, are crazy! YEAH!

I ended up leaving around 10:00 or so whenever the jungle came on.  I just 
couldn't move anymore.

Thanks oh so much.  Thats what it is ALL about! 

:)
j
See you at MAD tonight.

Well,

That pretty much says it.  So many kids, such a good scene, much more
diversity than is usually possible in certain other situations... I
haven't been to a party this good in three or four years, no shit.

My hat is off to the promoters of this event for handling everything so
well, and to all the friendly people who were there... I was slightly
worried that since I had brought (or more accurately, since my wife had
brought) 23 people to such a large event, that it would be a big lousy
party, and that it would be unfriendly and impersonal...

I couldn't have been more wrong.  Like I said, it was the *BOMB*, the best
party I've been to in years... whew!  Later y'all...

Greetings Friends

I just wanted to personally offer my sincerest apologies for FnF getting
busted.

Needless to say we couldn't do FnFs for $5 if we purchased the $8000+
permits the cops wanted to us have. Not having them was why they busted us.

In the end I think that all "underground" parties come down to a coin toss
as to whether they'll get busted or not. Over the 2.5 years that we've been
doing FnFs this is only the second bust, so I guess we've won that toss
much more often than not.

I also wanted to apologise for our voicemails being confusing in the
aftermath of the bust. While still at the space we called a variety of
other spaces that might have been able to accomodate the bulk of the party,
none of which were available. Finally we headed towrds what was described
as a very small warehouse in Redwood City. It turned out to be very small
and was packed with the 50 or so people that followed us there. Given that
there was no more room in the space at that point, one voicemail was
changed, saying it hadn't worked out. The other voicemail broke  such that
I couldn't change it, so it still said call back in an hour etc. I think
the vm that was working was changed again once the sun was up as many
people had left and there was a bit more room, but I'm not sure. In any
event, at this point we were just trying to make the best of it for as many
people as we could.

Obviously I feel very bad that many of you payed for a party that got
busted very early. While this is onbviously no justification, let me just
say this....

The reason FnFs have never been more than $5 is that everyone involved
works for free, donating their time, energy, and enthusiasm to the effort,
often at a cost to themsleves, especially considering the substantial
amounts of money people have invested in their lighting equipment their
sound equipment, etc.  Even with with all of the above donated, parties
stil cost lots to throw...there is the space, insurance, water, additional
sound and and lighting etc. and hence whoever undertakes throwing these
parties takes on a fair amount of risk.  I'm happy to say and I hope you
are too, that while the party didn't happen the other night, no one person
took a big financial loss, and more importantly no one was charged with a
crime or arrested. So in this sense I think this community -- many of you
that is to say -- took the risk and bore the cost and of trying to thow
this party, thankfully at a very low cost per person. I hope you feel your
contribution was well placed. We do hope to throw a make-up party sometime
though we're not sure when yet, so hang on to your tickets. Also, the folks
at MAD have graciously offered to let anyone with an FnF ticket in free
tonite, so head down to MAD tonite, it's always rocking =)

Many thanks for the continued support, sorry this one didn't work out.

ethan

Well....I went to my first friends and family party last sat. and WOW.  From
the second i walked in i could feel the energy.  This party seemed perfect,
especially since I planned on partying sober.  Everyone was friendly and
excited to be there and the music rocked.  So, about 45 min. into being
there it gets busted, which leaves me with a big problem.  I was with my
x-girlfriend and she kept hassling me to go to FTT, cuz "all our friends are
there". (what she really meant was all HER friends were there.)

So, after some delliberation, we go.  YUCK!

That was one of the lamest parties i've ever been to, especially coming from
the killer vibe at FnF.  I have never been in such a cold space and around
so many cold people before.  There was like 100,000 watts pumpin in the main
room...actually the sound system was pretty nice.  And like 3 other rooms, 2
jungle/trip hop and 1 house.  I was having no fun..so i decided to take my
vitamin E.

Good e, but it only helped a little.  The music was so..so.  Josh wink and
dj rap had the best sets. IMHO. Dj rap is amazing and she had 2 live
MC's...pretty slick. oh yeah, she's a complete hottie too. ;)

The ppl. were mixed and i got bumped into, not politely i might add, several
times.  Got a couple not so friendly looks, my friends got hassled and 2
other ones had to jump out of the way of 5 guys bum rushing into a fight.
Witnessed several ppl. getting drunk out of their mind, which IMHO
alcohol+the wrong ppl. = trouble....well atleast not a positive vibe.

I did meet some cool ppl, but i hope so since there were like some 6,000 ppl
there.

I guess the point to my story is that i'm really sad that Fnf got busted.
By going to FTT i really realized how much some massives can indeed suck,
but i guess they made 100's of thousands...so SOMEBODY had fun. ;0

I hope u all had a good weekend and i hope sunset went off! i didn't get to
go cuz i was moving all day sunday.

Much plur,
Micron

That was one of the lamest parties i've ever been to, especially coming from

jungle/trip hop and 1 house.  I was having no fun..so i decided to take my
vitamin E.
-----------------------
Well, it must have something to do with the eye of the beholder.  My
take was that friends and family couldn't have touched the massive I
attended at funky techno.  As for cold people, I have to say, that unless
your part of the "friends and family clique", friends and family events
can often be pretty cold also.  In fact, I have had much better times at
massives and have been welcomed with open arms by 17 year olds from
Hayward, etc., while at a friends and family event, I couldn't even get
an E to save my fucking life.  I guess if you're part of the sfraves
gang, and schmooze with people, then perhaps it's more fun, and people are
more friendly, but the only people who have really been very welcoming to
me at friends and family events are the people I already know.  On the other
hand, like I said, I've been treated more warmly by youngsters I don't even
know at bigger parties, and not just this Saturday, although this Saturday
was a serious case in point.  I don't want to schmooze you people, I go to
parties to dance, have fun, and go nuts.  I'm a 60 hour week hacker and I
don't have time to go out often, and when I do, I don't want to have to run
around meeting all the "right people" before I can get connected, have fun,
have people to talk to, etc.  I've felt this way for a long time now, and
have never said anything before about this, as I really don't want to be a
downer, but when I saw this note, I simply had to respond.  I have also had
other people tell me they feel similarly, but whatever the case, your mileage
may vary.  It is my feeling, however, that these parties, while small and
intimate, often aren't very friendly unless you know a significant number of
people at the event.  Last Saturday at this giant warehouse in Oakland with
some 4000 kids, I was treated like family by more kids than I can even
remember.  Yes, it was crowded.  I like that anyway.  Yes, there were people
there who don't know the scene, but everybody has to have a first time at
any sort of thing, and raving is no different.  I also would like to mention
that with even thousands of kids, from all over the place, I personally
didn't witness even the slightest trouble with aggressive males (the folks
you all call "hunters and gatherers"... that's pretty elitist, folks), or
anything even remotely like that, although I can't say it didn't happen, as
the place was much to large to see everything happening...

That brings me to another point.  The parties you folks throw tend to have
a rather homogeneous crowd, which isn't a bad thing per se, but the fact is,
it's much more difficult to get a friendly happy environment when you have
people there from radically different homes, races, socioeconomic backgrounds,
and the like.  Most brilliant of all was that funky techno tribe was attended
by a *very* diverse crowd, a much more diverse crowd than you folks have ever
attracted, and the vibe was still incredibly friendly, peaceful, and as
Coolio says... "all the way live"....  I'm not saying that you should go out
and try to attract a more diverse crowd, there is a place for both massives,
and the parties you throw in this scene here in the bay area, but when I hear
people capping like that, I'm likely to speak.   I don't want to rain on your
parade, but I've been to alot of parties, and that massive was fucking rocking,
in a most delightful way, so I felt your analysis needed a little
counterpoint....

Finally, I must agree with Dan that alcohol is often a serious problem, and
especially when the numbers are large (i.e. the crowd), and I'm usually not
into being around alcohol drinkers (I rarely drink myself), but in this
little formula "which IMHO alcohol+the wrong ppl. = trouble", I have to
note that "the wrong people" is a pretty subjective term.  I didn't notice
hardly any of "the wrong people" at this party, out of the many thousands
who were there.  I don't want to be one of the precious few, I am simply a
person who likes to dance and have fun with my fellow humans... wherever
they are from.  Oh yeah, Dan was right, the sound system was kickin' and
the beats were pretty damn fat!

 Damn! Wish I had thought to try the voicemail number(s) after I read about
the bust here on SFRaves. Oh well, I'm getting a nice positive "contact
high" from all the enthusiastic posts and descriptions about it from 
you all.

 Keep it rolling, Friends and Family!

>>  thank the creators of ID4 for making these facts much clearer to me.
>>
>>   1. Aliens like to blow up significant land marks first. Apparently
>>      the best way to destroy a city is to position your "Death Ray"
>>      over the most recognizable building.
>>   2. All pro-UFO people are morons who dance atop the building directly
>>      under the Death Ray.
>>   3. If alien "Destroyers" come to your city to blast it into oblivion,
>>      leave BEFORE they fire the Death Ray.
>>   4. If alien "Destroyers" come to your city to blast it into oblivion
>>      and you are caught in traffic at the last minute, make sure that
>>      you are travelling with a dog and a small child. The Law of
>>      Averages says you'll survive the Death Ray.
>>   5. If alien "Destroyers" come to your city to blast it into oblivion
>>      and you are caught in traffic at the last minute, make sure that
>>      you are NOT a raspy-voiced homosexual cable TV executive. The Law
>>      of Averages says you'll get waxed by the Death Ray.
>>   6. Stripping is a lucrative profession that allows one to "Pay the
>>      bills," "take care of one's boy," and own a nice house in a middle
>>      class subdivision.
>>   7. Strippers got moxie. When the going gets tough, they can drive
>>      California Highway Department utility vehicles, collect refugees
>>      and use their extensive survival skills to provide food and
>>      comfort to survivors.
>>   8. NASA sends out rejection letters, just like Harvard.
>>   9. Area 51 is an "Assault Base".
>>  10. A fleet of RVs can travel across the Nevada Test Site in
>>      line-abreast formation without the need of roads, thanks to the
>>      immense expanses of Salt Flats and the lack of impeding mountains.
>>  11. Area 51 has a big chain-link fence around it, and the guards at
>>      the gate wear black combat fatigues with white metal helmets in
>>      120 degree heat.
>>  12. Any bonehead with an RV can get to Area 51 by driving across the
>>      Salt Flat to the gate and flashing a captured alien to the guard.
>>  13. Standard operating procedure for the Air Force is to cluster all
>>      vehicles, aircraft, and ground personnel on a 200 meter section of
>>      tarmac in the middle of an Alien Invasion.
>>  14. The F-18 is the sole fighter in use by all branches of the
>>      service, including Marines and Air Force.
>>  15. From the assault scenes on the Alien "Destroyers', it appears that
>>      the F-18 must have had a 1000 unit production run.
>>  16. Both F-18s and B-2s must close to within 10 km of a target 20 km
>>      across before engaging with both air-to-air missiles and aerial
>>      launched nuclear cruise missiles.
>>  17. People too drunk to walk can still fly crop dusters and F-18s.
>>  18. Any bonehead with rudimentary aviation experience can be taught
>>      to pilot an F-18 in 5 hours.
>>  19. Any bonehead with F-18 flight experience can learn to pilot an
>>      Alien fighter in 5 minutes.
>>  20. Aliens with anatomy that includes tentacles and clawed feet use
>>      flight yokes just like ours.
>>  21. Aliens are wimps, even the ones in "Bio-Mechanical" armor. They
>>      have glass jaws and can be taken out with a punch by Will Smith.
>>      (He has had a lot of practice on photographers, though.)
>>  22. Aliens are stupid. When one of their fighters approaches the
>>      carrier, they don't bother to communicate with the pilot.
>>  23. Aliens are even more stupid. They pursue their targets into
>>      canyons walls and closing blast doors.
>>  24. Aliens are unbelievably stupid. While unarmed and unarmored,
>>      they do things to piss off people with hand guns.
>>  25. Aliens are just too stupid for words to express. An alien air
>>      traffic controller can look at a fighter that has been
>>      human-modified for 20 minutes and is only 50 feet away and not
>>      notice the welded-on missile rack until the missile is fired
>>      through his work station.
>>  26. Aliens are remarkably inarticulate. All they can say is, "Release
>>      me," "No peace," and "Die!"
>>  27. If you're President and your administration is faltering, an Alien
>>      Invasion might be a good way to boost your ratings in the polls.
>>  28. If you're President and your administration is faltering, manage
>>      to work into every other sentence the fact that you "flew in the
>>      Persian Gulf." No need to specify what branch of service.
>>  29. If you're President and your administration is faltering and an
>>      Alien Invasion occurs, relocate the V.P., the Cabinet, and the
>>      Joint Chiefs to one centralized location so that the Aliens can
>>      take them all out with one shot. You can always blame the problems
>>      of the past on them after victory is achieved.
>>  30. The President's Press secretary keeps her cell phone listed in the
>>      phone book "in case of emergencies."
>>  31. If your father abandons his Jewish beliefs after the death of your
>>      mother, always carry around a Torah and a Yarmulke. Aliens might
>>      attack and offer him a chance to renew his faith.
>>  32. If aliens abduct you and effectively destroy your life by making
>>      you the laughing stock of the community, never fear. When their
>>      "Destroyers" come, you will be vindicated to those who mocked your
>>      tale.
>>  33. If aliens abduct you and do unspeakable things to you, you can
>>      have revenge upon them by flying an F-18 into their Death Ray.
>>  34. If aliens abduct you and do unspeakable things to you and you have
>>      revenge upon them by flying an F-18 into their Death Ray, you will
>>      obtain redemption and your children will be proud of you.
>>  35. The best way to win back a former wife is to be very annoying,
>>      look perpetually vexed, and keep wearing your wedding ring for 4
>>      years after the divorce.
>>  36. In 10 hours, one man with a Macintosh Laptop can code a virus in
>>      C++ that will take down a completely alien computer system.
>>  37. Even though the Mac isn't compatible with most other Earthly
>>      operating systems, it can interface with an alien computer.
>>  38. Alien network security is nonexistent.
>>  39. Rather than attacking a planet when they first encounter it
>>      (i.e., 1940s), aliens wait until the planet has developed just
>>      enough technology to possibly defend itself.
>>  40. Scientists at Area 51 are a bit touched in the head, and "Don't

I learned something new on Saturday at FnF:

It's Ernie Deaks' mission in life to kill me.
He is relentless.

Each time he finished with another *hardass* track, I would think,
"okay, it's time for a cool-down song now". No way. It just gets harder
and harder and higher energy... and then ends his set with what I can
only describe as acid-gabber.

Ouch. :) I'm still in pain...

But it wouldn't stop me from going to the last Sunset... and w0w! It
was beautiful. I had never been to the Berkeley Marina, but the view
is amazing. Hopefully, they'll use that location a bit more next year.

I had the same feeling as David Lowe when gazing out at the city, lit
up: "Damn, I *live* there!" It's so true what I had always heard
about the San Francisco skyline.

And looking back, it reminded me of a conversation Wayne and I had at
Sunset. We were reflecting upon why we like the DJ's that we do... and
it's not just the music that the DJ spins; it's the karma and the
energy that they project. Some DJ's, no matter how great their music
may be, have certain "arrogance issues"... ya know, lousy people with
groovy record collections.

And then there are those who truly love the people and the scene, and
love creating the energy and the vibe... the DJ's who will thank you
for thanking them for a good set. And I thought back to all of the
sweat dripping off of Deaks, the fat grin on Ethan's face when FnF
finally went off, and watching Astral Matrix smile and cheer with the
Sunset crowd as he tweaked the knobs of his 303...

And it reminded me of San Francisco, and the beautiful view at
Berkeley Marina. Living in SF is being part of this _energy_ that I
can't fully explain. All I know is that you can feel it when you're
there. And you can see it glowing from the city at night, from across
the bay.

It reminded me of the karma and the energy that our city projects.
Maybe that's why it's such a special place to live...

See you at Mad tonight (I'm not dead yet! :)

Steve

Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

NOTE - if you don't feel like reading a party review, please read the way I
experienced the energy (if you are interested in that) - below the second
dotted line.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        Many of my best friends went to FnF, because FTT was going to be a
massive - there will be a lot of gangsters there and LIVE 105 ppl will show
up as well.  I have to admit I was really bummed, because at least one of
the people I really wanted to party with (from Seattle) got talked into
going to FnF....  Oh, well - there was nothing that was going to stop me,
because I was really looking forward to a big party with great DJs.  My
boyfriend Marc, some of our friends and I went to FTT, all of us psyched
about it.

        What can I say?  The party was a massive - there were thousands of
people, but that was to be expected.  I have been to Homebase once before
(The Gathering in April) and I have to admit that FTT made the space
magical.  There were 4 different rooms - some of them with great stage
settings, kick ass laser shows, chill-room looking like a cocktail bar,
killer sound systems.

        We got in pretty early and explored the space.  Tony was spinning
in one of the rooms and we decided to stay there (little did I know that I
will stay at the same place for 10 hours).  Tony was pretty good, although
it seemed like it was a little too early to really get into it (I wanted to
see everything and wanted to see how many of my friends were actually
there).

        I seriously started dancing around 11pm and was waiting for Dan to
come on.  Dan (as most of the times) really kicked ass.  People were
dancing like crazy and it was great to see all the energy that was created
on the dance floor.  The energy I am talking about is the energy that is
very different than energy at the small party.  It is energy of thousands
of people dancing their asses off to the killer music, who are there to
dance and hear DJs,  because they love the music and they want to be part
of thousands of people who feel the same.

        I stayed at that room for the most of the night beaus music just
kept me going (as well as great visuals).  Other highlights of the party:

- glow dancers (they had glow necklaces wrapped around them and dance in
couple rooms) - very entertaining

- fire show outside

- running into the astronaut from Burning Man

- getting help from the medical team (I manage to hurt myself, taking a
short cut to the bathroom, and needed some minor medical help to stop the
bleeding on my back)

- getting a plastic glow-bracelet from this guy who was dancing with his GF
close to us

- leaving a stuffed animal there (on purpose) and actually having this guy
pick it up and give it to somebody as a present

        Thanks FTT crowd, thanks all of you wonderful people who were there
and who brought the positive energy with you.  FTT was definitely my
favorite massive, and maybe my favorite party I went to so far.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        Many times during the night, I though about you guys - many of my
friends, and just many people that had bad thoughts about the party.  I
wished you could have been there, to see with your eyes how great the party
was.  Many times while I was dancing I started writing this letter in my
head, so I could explain it better, but somehow all those thoughts are
scattered and I can't really put them on the paper.

        I was surrounded by hundreds of people, and never in those 10 hours
I was there, I felt the negative energy.  I had people come up to me and
introduce themselves just because they wanted to (not because I put the
description on the list).  I met people, because they were sharing the same
dance floor as I was and after dancing for hours we just wanted to know who
was the person next to us with whom we shared that amazing experience.  I
accidentally hit people while dancing with my eyes closed (one time I had
my fingers in somebody's mouth and almost ripped his upper lip), and
although they would have maybe passed as gangster types, they just smiled
and walked away. I saw people who were hungry for great music and who
wanted to be there for it and enjoy every minute of it.

        I didn't get many hugs and I didn't get stickers offered to me at
every corner, but that is not what I was looking for.  Reading other
people's posts and hearing that people did see the bad energy, makes me
wander if I was maybe at the right spot at the party the entire night.  But
then it also makes me wander if it is true when people say "if you do
something with negative expectations and just look for negative things -
you will see them".  IMO, taking "happy drugs" to get the negative energy
away from you and waiting for drugs to kick in to have fun is the most
ridicules thing.  You should have fun in the first place, otherwise it's
time to go home.

        Many people say how massives are not put together with love and
positive energy, how they are too expensive etc.  It cost $25, but that's
the money that went into the space, permits, stages, visuals, DJs etc...  I
didn't mind spending that money because I had one of the best times of my
life.  I am glad I gave FTT another chance and didn't blow them off,
although I had two good reasons - my last FTT party that I wasn't too fond
of and well as many people on this list "bitching" about how the party will
suck.  Once again I proved to myself that find out for yourself is the best
way, rather than listening to others.

        Sorry this is so long, I just want some of you to see how I felt.
I am glad people had fun at FnF, but I also hope some day, some of those
people who keep dissing massives will give than a change and see for
themselves how great  they can be.

Hugz to all,
Branka

P.S.  the most depressing moment of the night - one of the people I know
came up to me and asked me with a sad look on her face and pity in her eyes
"so, you didn't get tickets to FnF, ha?"

First off I think that in my case you pretty much discredit yourself
completely by relating that because you couldn't get drugs at F&F that it
is an unfriendly/unfamily event...this is not what you may have meant but
I'll bet it appeared that way to many...

I've had some people tell me some similar feelings about the Cloud Factory
(of which i am somewhat of a founder) and I think that these kind of
experiences are common at smaller parties.  I think this happens because of
the reasons that people throw parties.  I wanted to start throwing parties
so my friends would have something fun to do, something they could afford
and someplace close to go (2 hrs to sf is a long ways).  So I suppose out
of that purpose we are intent on making our parties fun for ourselves, why
not we put all of the hard work into it.  I'm sure some of the massives
promoters like to make sure they are having a good time as well.  But when
you take the size difference, suppose we are having a party with 150
people, at the Cloud Factory likelihood is that about 100 of those people
would be friends.  Tendency of friends is to hang/chill with friends...some
people call this cliques...i call it natural.  Truth of the matter is it is
easier to approach those you know than a stranger.  I think that as someone
who considers themselves an outsider or a stranger to those who are the
core of friends is going to have make that effort to be involved in meeting
people and having conversations. At a massive it is easier to meet people
sheerly because of the amount of people (imho), there is somewhat of a
ratio...there are still only a certain core group of friends who throw the
event but then add 4000 people and you have an environment where it is
easier for starngers to meet and interact.

Because smaller parties are more friendly to friends does not make them
elitist or cliquish.  In my opinion it means that there are some of us who
want to go to a party where we know someone.  I don't get anything out a
some random 17 year old treating me like a friend/family for a half hour
and then never seeing them again...I'd rather have people treating me like
that that i can call next week and say hi to.  Just a matter of preference,
some people dont want that kind of relationships in their partying.

I don't understand how that is elitist to call someone who is out looking

gather...

Funky Tekno Tribe this weekend.  Just couldn't resist that bait (sorry =)

I'm glad you had a good time, it sounds like many did!  Those of us who
help throw smaller parties like to hear criticisms if they are
constructive...(your note wasn't really a criticism I didn't feel more a
reflection on your feelings which is also helpful).  If you have stuff you
want to say, say it!  It can only help people do things better (if the
criticism/comments are constructive not destructive)

aaargh!

stop reminding me how great SF is when I'm stuck down here
in Palo Alto!

I felt the same way while gazing at the SF skyline from the Marina last
night.  Truly beautiful.

        Many times during the night, I though about you guys - many of my
friends, and just many people that had bad thoughts about the party.  I
wished you could have been there, to see with your eyes how great the party
was.  Many times while I was dancing I started writing this letter in my
head, so I could explain it better, but somehow all those thoughts are
scattered and I can't really put them on the paper.
------------
It definitely sounds like you were at the same party I was (i.e. funky
techno tribe).  I don't think I have EVER been to a party that had such
a nice feeling, so many cool people (as in something like 4000... anyone
know how many people actually attended that party?).

Also, like you, I saw absolutely nothing negative the entire night.  I also
bumped into people, as I don't always dance that well when I start getting
really tired, etc., and was merely smiled at...

I definitely agree there's something really cool about a good massive
party, as with so many people, there's just something kinetic that
happens... I also agree, that while small parties are cool, that this
thing that happens at a large party is unique to parties with many,
many people... I find it really cool that I simply couldn't have seen
everyone and everything, that no matter how hard I threw myself at this
rave, no matter how many dance floors I danced on, and how many people I
met, there were thousands upon thousands more I didn't manage to see or
experience.  Like I said earlier, that party was the *BOMB*, no doubt
about it, and while I've been to lousy massives, I have to say the funky
techno tribe definitely outdid themselves this time.  I also urge those
who think massives "necessarily suck" to reconsider, as while they are
definitely harder to throw and to keep everything groovy, when it works,
it's quite a spectacle to behold.

I might also add, that I did see alot of kids, dressed in many different
types of clothing, but I saw no one I would consider "a gangster".  I
did meet a bunch of kids from the South East Bay that I would not likely
have met at a smaller party, (as we don't run in the same circles), and
that was also very cool.

IMHO, raving is about being inclusive.  This party was inclusive on a
MASSIVE scale... maybe that's why they call them massives... anyway, if
it's simply the numbers involved (i.e. the number of attendants) that
puts you off of massives, then you probably won't appreciate them anyway,
but if you think that they "necessarily suck", this last Saturday definitely
proved that completely incorrect...

Like I said, it was the best party in three or four years, for me...

And some are out to jungle and gabber! ;)

I'd say the conclusion of all this that most of us had a great weekend,
where ever they ended up going.

: the people I really wanted to party with (from Seattle) got talked into
: going to FnF....  Oh, well - there was nothing that was going to stop me,
: because I was really looking forward to a big party with great DJs.  My
: boyfriend Marc, some of our friends and I went to FTT, all of us psyched
: about it.
: 
:         What can I say?  The party was a massive - there were thousands
of
: people, but that was to be expected.  I have been to Homebase once before
: (The Gathering in April) and I have to admit that FTT made the space
: magical.  There were 4 different rooms - some of them with great stage
: settings, kick ass laser shows, chill-room looking like a cocktail bar,
: killer sound systems.
: 
:         We got in pretty early and explored the space.  Tony was spinning
: in one of the rooms and we decided to stay there (little did I know that
I
: will stay at the same place for 10 hours).  Tony was pretty good,
although
: it seemed like it was a little too early to really get into it (I wanted

: come on.  Dan (as most of the times) really kicked ass.  People were
: dancing like crazy and it was great to see all the energy that was

: on the dance floor.  The energy I am talking about is the energy that is
: very different than energy at the small party.  It is energy of thousands
: of people dancing their asses off to the killer music, who are there to
: dance and hear DJs,  because they love the music and they want to be part
: of thousands of people who feel the same.
: 
:         I stayed at that room for the most of the night beaus music just

: introduce themselves just because they wanted to (not because I put the
: description on the list).  I met people, because they were sharing the
same
: dance floor as I was and after dancing for hours we just wanted to know

: accidentally hit people while dancing with my eyes closed (one time I had

:         I didn't get many hugs and I didn't get stickers offered to me at

: away from you and waiting for drugs to kick in to have fun is the most
: ridicules thing.  You should have fun in the first place, otherwise it's
: time to go home.
: 
:         Many people say how massives are not put together with love and
: positive energy, how they are too expensive etc.  It cost $25, but that's
: the money that went into the space, permits, stages, visuals, DJs etc... 
I
: didn't mind spending that money because I had one of the best times of my
: life.  I am glad I gave FTT another chance and didn't blow them off,
: although I had two good reasons - my last FTT party that I wasn't too
fond
: of and well as many people on this list "bitching" about how the party
will
: suck.  Once again I proved to myself that find out for yourself is the
best
: way, rather than listening to others.
: 
:         Sorry this is so long, I just want some of you to see how I felt.
: I am glad people had fun at FnF, but I also hope some day, some of those
: people who keep dissing massives will give than a change and see for
: themselves how great  they can be.
: 
: Hugz to all,

: 
: P.S.  the most depressing moment of the night - one of the people I know

First off I think that in my case you pretty much discredit yourself
completely by relating that because you couldn't get drugs at F&F
-----------
I didn't draw that conclusion simply on that basis.  I have been around
a *very* long time, and I've had many experiences that have led me to tend
to feel this way.  I simply don't like the elitism.  It's present whether
or not one is looking for intoxicants...



 that it
is an unfriendly/unfamily event...this is not what you may have meant but
I'll bet it appeared that way to many...
------------
I really can't worry too much about what others think.  All in all, funky
techno tribe was such a BOMB ass party, that worrying that someone may
take my statements the wrong way is hardly a consideration.  But, for the
real possibility that I wasn't that clear, let me reemphasize.  Elitism
really sucks rocks, IMHO it's not what raving is about (although I would
never go as far as to say what raving should be for anyone other than
myself), and I'm afraid that even while I know many of the people that
started the whole sfraves thing, and while I'm very close to some of
these people, and certainly appreciate many (as in a great many) of you,
it's become very elitist as time has passed.  The example I gave was the
easiest to explain, required the least amount of text, and was based upon
fairly recent experience, but let me state clearly: IT'S HARDLY ABOUT GETTING
DOPE.  The thing that was so unbelievably righteous about the funky techno
tribe party was the completely insane number of people, and the incredibly
friendly way that this VERY diverse crowd treated each other.  It was quite
a sight.  I've really never seen such an inclusive, widespread vibe in all
my born days, with such cool people, and I was literally flabbergasted.

Since I don't get out that often, it's unclear when I'll next attend any
party, as I'm really quite busy at the moment, but I'm in no way saying
that friends and family sucks, but that I, for one, would really appreciate
people taking care to not play that elitist bullshit.  If I thought that
it was beyond hope, I wouldn't bother to mention it, but I know that a
number of you really care about these parties, and I think that's very
cool.  I feel that if I didn't tell you what I really think, then I'm
not really acting like friends *OR* family... honesty is a good thing, even
when it's not what you're hoping to hear.  So, perhaps I'll make the next
friends and family, or some event in the (hopefully not too distant) future,
and perhaps I won't feel "left out", but I could hardly even complain if I
did feel left out and didn't have the balls to say so.  Include *everybody*,
even if you think they "look like a gangster"... I really haven't met that
many gangsters ever, I'm not really even sure they exist.  Yes, there are
people out there who are completely fucked, and yes, they're less likely
to find your small hidden parties, but there are an immense number of very
cool people who you are also excluding, and I'd be very happy if friends &
family became a little more friendly to "unknowns"...


later,

Well, someone mentioned 6500 yesterday, or was it 7500? =) I don't think it
was that many, but it was MASSIVE! =)

The vibe definitively not as bad as some people on this list kept telling us
it would be. Au contraire, the vibes I got from everyone were vibes of pure
happiness and friendship. If I'm allowed to compare it to a more "underground"
party, CCC w/ Goa Gil, the vibe was MUCH better on Saturday night.

>I might also add, that I did see alot of kids, dressed in many different

Although there were quite a few people in "gangster clothes" (which I really
don't have a problem with, they can wear what they want), I didn't see any
of the gangs that were all over the place at Ground Zero. Instead, the 
"gangsters" got into the music and experience just as much as anyone else at
HomeBase.

>Like I said, it was the best party in three or four years, for me...

Maybe not THE best party I've been too, but it was up there. And I'm not
just saying that cuz I got to see/hear Mr. Wink, this was a truly GREAT
party!

Truth of the matter is it is
easier to approach those you know than a stranger.
----------

What was so unbelievably cool about funky techno tribe was that people
who I had never met, and people who I may never meet again, took the
trouble to meet me, even though hanging with only their friends would have
been obviously "easier".  Like I say, yes, it's harder, but it also makes
that much more of an impression....  It's very cool to realize *how much*
harder it is to hang out with people you don't know, and to include them,
and then to actually see that happen.  To me, that's a real rave.

Anyway.. the song has some like deep sounding organ or something and and a
4/4 beat. 
And a guy keeps saying " I just want to clear my mind."

The song is sick!!!! If anyone knows please tell me the title or any other
info you might have on it...

Well, the only thing I made it to (after FnF getting busted) was sunset.
I have to say that this was my *first* sunset of the year besides the
first boat party.  I'm usually busy on Sundays, but I allowed my friends
to drag me out to the Marina after we went on a short bike ride in Tilden
Park.  Short because of rangers kicking us out due to extreme fire
danger which was disappointing, but understandable.  Anyway, I was
really looking forward to some gnarly hills that would beat me to the
ground and get rid of some of the anxiety, anger, and disappointment
that I've been in possession of lately.  I was hoping to dance really
hard at FnF, and maybe that would have done it, but it wasn't meant to be.

I was grumpy heading out to sunset, and I'm not sure why I went.  I had
other things to do, but part of me really wanted to go, especially after
FnF not happening.  We got there right as the sun was setting and Astral
Matrix was playing.  The crowd was truly impressive-the biggest sunset
crowd I've ever seen.  And everyone was so happy and *so* into the music.
Immediately I felt some of my tension loosening, and next thing I know I
am dancing like a fiend.  Astral Matrix really played some beautiful stuff
and ended with a tad of jungle.  I LOVED  it, and, most importantly, I
NEEDED it.  It is really amazing how you can let yourself sink into
laziness and then become bitter at the world.  

I have to say that I felt really good after dancing and being with such a
happy, exuberant crowd.  I watched the moon rise and everything go from
light to dark to light again.  It reminded me that to be happy one has to
work at it, something I forget from time to time.  

I danced so hard I got a blister on each foot!!  And my spirit returned,
or at least I was reminded of its existence.

I hope everyone had as much of a rewarding time as I did :)

Wow.  Call me struck dumb and clueless... that was one hell of a party...
the weird thing was, I met a serious horde of people I met at Harmony in
the woods a few weeks ago.  Is Dayan on this list?  If so, drop me a line,
I'm the one who was walking by to go to the bathroom, and we both stopped
and did the double take, going "hey, wait a minute..." and Dayan said
"aren't you the one with the tent"... and indeed I was... that happened
several times that night, which was pretty amazing considering how many
folks were there.

I got home from Friends & Family in a complete, happy daze when I realized
that I left my camera there (or somewhere?)

If anyone finds/has found a 27 exposure disposable camera (distinguishing
mark: happy face sticker right on the front) could you PLEEEZ return it?
There's only a few exposures left; the rest are photos from FnF, Stinky's
b-day party and other parties that I really want to have photos from!

I would post a review of FnF, but I think it's pretty much generally
accepted that it was THE SHIT. =)

take care,

I've been on SFRaves for three months now, and I've not seen anything but 
welcoming arms.  I've been going to the parties, saying hello to people, 
talking to some, dancing alot, enjoying the vibe, getting hypnotized by 
the beat.

And just this last weekend, everything seemed to gel for me.  I started 
placing faces with names, meeting a lot of SFRavers with similar 
interests, and at Sunset yesterday, I  was able to go alone and find my 
newfound friends to hang out with!  That as cool; I haven't felt that 
since leaving college and dedicating my life to software.

Elitist?  Not at all.  Making GOOD friends takes time.  I like going to 
massives to see the diversity, to meet new people.  I like going to raves 
like FnF to be with people I know, if not by name, at least by sight.

I'm sorry you've felt "left out".  I hope we can meet sometime, maybe 
talk about snowboards, politics, or music?  In fact, of the near 500 (??) 
people on this list, I've only met a handful, and look forward to meeting 
more of you.

peace and love,

deeje

Sorry..this is kinda long...which is something i don't normally do.

Well...i hope i didn't start anything, though i'm not really sure i did.  My
post was about MY experiences and feelings and was not intended to upset or
embarass anyone.  

SOme background.......
I've been going to parties for like 6 years and truly hold a deep and strong
love for the scene( ALL of it).  But when i first started partying i went to
massives cuz that was all i knew and most of my friends went. I had a GREAT
time at those parties...it was strange to me to feel such positive energy
and to see so many happy and loving ppl., though i'm sure a lot of that was
due to drugs. ;) No really, it was really nice to feel all that positive
energy.  Whether it was the drugs or whatever, it still felt nice to have a
good time with so many ppl. and the MUSIC..WOW....but that's a completely
different story.

So i went to these massives and had fun..a LOT of fun.  But then i also
started to go to house parties and smaller events...and for one reason or
another i felt an EVEN better vibe at these parties.  They were much more
personal and that feeling of unity was much more present.  So i kept going
to both for a long time, but then my life began to change as well.  I
couldn't go to as many parties as before and now had to be much more
selective.  Not only was there a time constraint but my reasons for partying
began to change to one of self expansion and growth, not just having a good
time. Now i realize that both types of parties serve their purpose; the
massives introduced me to the scene and energy and the smaller parties
helped me find that energy in a purer form.  But it was the "smaller" ones
that gave me what i needed, don't forget i'm talking about ME and what i need.

So i began to go to more "small parties" and seemed to find what i was
looking for there. And as time progresses i guess i have become much more
content and comfortable with those parties. And, so, for several personal
reasons i now tend to be really selective about my parties.

Also..i don't have anything against massives and will still go if i believe
in what they are about.  AND i'm REALLY glad all u had fun at FTT....maybe i
was just looking for something different or maybe i was too blind to open my
eyes to what went on..but those were my experiences there and like anyone
else on the list i just wanted to share them with all of u.

I must admit that it felt better to give $5.00 to Fnf than $25 to FTT. And
it amazes me how ANYONE could do a good party for $5.00.

Glad everyone had a good weekend..wherever they ended up.

MUCHO PLUR -even to those that went to FTT.... =P  ;)

Their voicemail sort of sounded like it, but the party referred to was
indeed Karma.

so, what was FTT like? I hear from the list that alot of people had fun.
However, my roommate ryan went (his first big rave) and although he had fun
as well, a few images stuck with him:

1) the bar outside. Selling alcohol at a rave? what the fuck???
2) the $2 water bottles. 2 bones is 2 much for water, esp. when the flyer
says it's free.
3) the brawl(s).
4) seeing a dodgy, speed-dealer looking type of guy walk up to one of the
ever-present cops and give him a phattie hi-five and a hug. hmmm...
5) getting kicked around and stepped on in the chill room, which apparently
had no beanbags, no couches, and no mattresses.
6) Too too many high school girls walking around in large groups clutching
their handbags tightly with that "fish-out-of-water" look on their faces.
7) having to walk through a line of hundreds of e-dealers on the way in,
all of them whispering "ecstasy... e... x..."

I don't even want to know how much FTT had to fork over to the Oakland PD
to get their approval for the shit going down there. There's no way I'd pay
$25 for a party where I was in any way doubtful of the crowd it was going
to attract. (see: radio ads, dodgy promotions, poster-sized flyers) My name
was on the guest list for FTT, but I CHOSE to pay for my FnF ticket, the
tickets of four friends, plus the toilet paper and trash bags that were
there. FTT went off because of the money involved, FnF went off because of
the love and energy and hard work involved!

smiles,

FnF:

An amazing evening of reaffirmation and defining moments for all that 
attended.

My highlight: One incredibly happy Ethan dancing his ass off in the 
              middle of the dance floor at the new location.
              
It was great to see you all again!!!

much love and energy,

Terry

P.S. So who's putting FnF pictures on the Web??

What are you suggesting short of me walking around a party and breaking
groups of people up, telling them "you're being too elitist.  Get out there
and meet more people."

What is it that the crew of FnF does that causes you to feel that we
practise elitism, and that FTT does that serves to negate it?  Are you
faulting FnF, the people that attend FnF, or are you just frustrated that
you haven't broken into an imaginary inner sanctum?

I don't want to come off harsh.  I completly understand the frustration of
not being part of what seems to be a big clique.  It's not.  What you are
seeing is a lot of people who see each other on a very regular basis,
meeting again.  When I began partying I went to four shows where I couldn't
get any candy either.  Most of them in the basement of 1015 Folsom.  I came
with one DJ friend, and of course he knew what seemed to be everyone.
Eventually, I started seeing some faces I remembered, through him, and
things started becoming more fun.  Then, at a free wicked at 1015 Folsom, I
blossomed.  I met no less than 20-30 people in one night, and that was all
it took.  From then on it seemed that I knew someone at most of the parties
I went to.

Jack, the bottom line is: only YOU can affect this kind of change.  You
can't expect me, as a crew member of FnF, to go around and make sure YOU
are being excepted into everyone's circle.  It's your responsibility to get
out and meet people, not mine.  All I do is invest huge hours of
back-breaking work, take financial and emotional risks, and try to provide
the best and safest environment for people to come together and listen to
quality music, and meet.  There is no way in hell we would practise
elitism, in fact I think you'll see more people from FnF practise
inclusionism than most other crews.  How many times at FnF have you seen an
exclusive DJ area behind the decks, where all the DJs hangout with their
others and never become part of the whole?  Never!

It sounds like you went in to FnF harboring ill feelings of elitism, and it
became a self-fulfilled prophecy.  You then went to FTT and let yourself go.

If there's one thing I can do well, Jack, it's getting strangers to meet
and converse.  I like that quality, it's contagious.  Next FnF, find me,
and I'll walk around with you and we can discuss instances where you are
seeing elitism practised...I'd really be interested in seeing the party
through your eyes.  Plus, I will introduce you to some of the greatest,
friendliest, selfless people you could ever hope to meet.

Peace and respect,

Tony Rotundo

They may be as close as your local Safeway...  The Safeway on Market
and Church in SF had tons of them waiting by the registers for happy
ravers. I grabbed handfuls; they were only 99c, but they may be the
smaller variety.

just a tip for those who are amused by bright, shiny things :)

[ to sfraves list ]

 This Friday's MANTRA ( a "new" once-a-month resurrection of the formerly
weekly event ) is listed on the SFRcalender but doesn't have a start or
ending time listed. Being too cheap to call the info numbers ( I'd be
calling from the 408 area code ), would anyone like to post the 
start/estimated stop times for this Friday's MANTRA ?

I have been to small, friendly parties (last Chrysalis for example) that
didn't have anything of that sort either - no beanbagsm, couches nor
mattresses, but you would always agree that Gateway parties are in the same
group as FnF

>6) Too too many high school girls walking around in large groups clutching

I haven't see many of those - actually I saw many older ppl than at FnF and
Gateway parties....

>7) having to walk through a line of hundreds of e-dealers on the way in,
>all of them whispering "ecstasy... e... x..."

Where there are drugs, there will be dealers, some of them are quiet, some
are not, but that there were hundreds - little too much - maybe 20-30 (what
I saw).

        I am not sure I agree with you that love and energy of the
promoters has to be what makes the party.  I think that love and energy of
people attending a party can make it as well.  And FTT didn't go off
because of the $$ involved, I agree it had to add some to the atmosphere,
but also the people there are people that made it.

        Also,  I can tell you for sure that some of the people that were
attracted to this party (at least the once I know) were as great as people
that were at FnF or smaller parties.

        The reason I am writing so much about FTT, is because I don't think
some of you are willing to listen at all.  You just go by what other ppl
say, which is wrong.  I have been to more small parties than massives, and
I do agree that they can be a lot of fun (I met many of you through them).
I chose last FnF over Theta, because I heard so much about their parties,
and I had one of the best times there.  I love majority of people I have
met through small parties, and I will continue to go to small parties when
I am up for a small party vibe, but I will also go to massives, with good
DJs to hear the music and be a part of the massive.

        Also, please think twice before you post ...  I am referring to
this comment:
"There's no way I'd pay
>$25 for a party where I was in any way doubtful of the crowd it was going
>to attract"

I was attracted to that party, as well as some of my friends?  What does
that make us?  I am also hurt (surprised) by reactions of *some* people who
went to FnF who keep bad things about FTT and people who went there.  Is
that really necessary?

Not really understanding where meaning of PLUR comes in play in some of the
posts,
*B*

1) the bar outside. Selling alcohol at a rave? what the fuck???
---------
Actually, somewhere around 8 AM, a beer starts to sound like a damn
good idea, although I didn't have one while there.  They also were grilling
hamburgers and other stuff like that.  I wasn't particularly in the mood,
but it was cool that it was there.  As far as the alcohol goes, I didn't
see any problems as a result of it, and wasn't even aware that it was
available, but given that they were grilling burgers, it's not too far a
stretch.



3) the brawl(s).
---------------
Never saw anything akin to this all night, but, as I said, it was much
too large an event to exhaust (meaning, that even somebody on speed couldn't
get to/cover everything going on), so there might have been a brawl.  I
saw no such thing, but it's possible it did happen.  It must have been
over pretty damn quick, though, because I did scope out the entire venue,
and I particularly enjoy roaming around at these things, so I did see all
the rooms, and frequented nearly all of them throughout the night.



4) seeing a dodgy, speed-dealer looking type of guy walk up to one of the
ever-present cops and give him a phattie hi-five and a hug. hmmm...
----------------
Now that's plain creepy, I don't know what to infer.  However, I would say
that labeling someone a "speed-dealer looking type of guy" is quite possibly
inaccurate labeling... and I do know people like Geoff White think it's a
good idea to make friends with the cops, if at all possible (sometimes it's
obviously not possible... if so, usually best to give them a wide berth).
Perhaps this "dodgy speed dealer" was just some spun raver trying to include
the "stiff policeman" in the fun... it does happen, although I'm usually not
the one to take such risks.  If, in fact, there is collusion between speed
dealers and police, and that's what was happening, then I must agree that's
pretty sketchy situation, but it's entirely possible that what happened had
nothing to do with "speed dealing" whatsoever.  There were a ton of whispers
about X though... and lots of people looked pretty buzzed.  Being that I'm
"old", I often get treated to suspicion at times, and maybe what was seen
was somebody my age being friendly to a cop, as it does happen.  Or perhaps
not.  There's obviously a serious problem with both our drug laws and with
police corruption so it's not beyond the realm of possibility.  Did anyone
see anyone getting busted?  I didn't...



5) getting kicked around and stepped on in the chill room, which apparently
had no beanbags, no couches, and no mattresses.
--------------------
Yes, there were no beanbags, nor mattresses that I saw in there, which would
have been better.  However, rather than being kicked, some unknown person in
a pile of people on the floor played with my hair and gave me a quite nice
hand massage (not that kind of massage, silly, he/she massaged my *hand*!).  I
agree that beanbags would have been the shit, but nevertheless it hardly
detracted from the fun I had, although lying around in there certainly would
have been more comfortable.  The getting kicked part could also have been
somebody stumbling... I know I stumbled on *at least* one person, to whom I
apologized profusely... which apparently amused her no end, as judged by
her reaction.  There were times when it was hard to navigate through the
bodies...


6) Too too many high school girls walking around in large groups clutching
their handbags tightly with that "fish-out-of-water" look on their faces.
----------------
I did see lots of young girls, young boys, older girls, older boys... to
tell the truth, almost all ravers look pretty young to me, but like I said,
I'm "old"....  I didn't really see anyone looking like a "fish out of water",
but that's somewhat subjective also, and it's entirely possible I looked
that way myself somewhere around 5:30...


$25 for a party where I was in any way doubtful of the crowd it was going
to attract. (see: radio ads, dodgy promotions, poster-sized flyers)
------------------
I too was very doubtful from the outset.  Probably because of where it
was held, but as *B* mentioned, they did some really cool things with that
space that made it much better than the (only) other time I've been there.
As for the "Live 105 crowd", I really couldn't tell... what do they look
like?


FTT went off because of the money involved
---------------
That's complete horseshit.  It went off because the environment was good,
the music was slamming, the people wanted to party and everyone was really
friendly.  Yes, obviously that production took serious dollars to put on,
but I'd say your opinion is unnecessarily cynical.  It was a complete hoot,
and it looked to me like everyone there was having a great time.  I would
also say that it's very likely that the funky techno tribe people worked
rather hard also, as the evidence of it was everywhere.  Why do some folks
feel compelled to bag so hard?  It's unfortunate that your friend or whoever
it was had a lousy time, I would have been happy to hang out with whoever
it was that wasn't feeling too good about things, but like I said, I didn't
see really anyone fitting that description....  Just because the current
popular logic says that "massives suck" doesn't mean that they always do,
and to put on an event that large with that good a scene, and to keep it
raging the way it was for so long is akin to building a bridge in the 1920's,
in terms of what it takes to put on parties.  I can only begin to imagine
the insanely complicated logistics that must surely have been necessary to
put that party at the level it was.  For that, I have utmost respect, as
we have all seen what massives look like when that isn't done, and it
isn't pretty.  This was very pretty, very pretty indeed...

Are any of the promoters for funky techno on this list?  I would be
curious to know about some of the things they had to do to make that
thing go off successfully without the police, or any other unfriendly
entity screwing it up.  Whatever they did, it sure worked.  Besides, it
isn't a competition, we're not (or rather I'm not) in the "business" of
being cooler than thou, and the best thing about Saturday was that I
really didn't have to deal with any attitude whatsoever.  I was expecting
to endure hardships, as I've seen big raves turn out really bad, but
in retrospect, I think that I'll revise my thinking, as going with the
"current popular logic" that massives suck, was definitely proven wrong.
On the other hand, there are definitely shifty promoters around (I've
heard that the Acme place was pretty scary, for example, and that if a
fire or something happened, many would be injured or worse), but I
would say that this party was pretty solid evidence the funky techno tribe
promoters are into throwing good events, even though I once went to a
funky techno tribe party at Cesar's Latin Palace which wasn't anywhere
near as good.  This time around they rocked it right, boy...

Hi -
 I just wanted to extend a thank-you to all the Friends and Family folks   
who put in a lot of hard hours to make a beautiful space.  It was a   
tragedy that the party got busted, especially so early, and I'm sure it   
must have been very, very frustrating for those who worked so hard to   
bring it together, so I just want to say thank you.  The space was   
_great_!  It was really apparent that a lot of time, love, and sweat went   
into the production.  Thanks for all your hard work; it was appreciated.
 -Roy

i'm not going to be one of those ppl who says "massives suck!"... you had
a lot of fun, and i'm glad you did.

i'd like to say this:

i've been raving for 3 months. that's all. there have been times when i
felt like an outsider looking at a clique, there have been times when i
couldn't meet anybody...

but meet people i have. i've met a lot of people. at FnF i met more people
than i could count. how? by trying.

one way to meet people in this "clique" is just by asking. that's how i
went to my first rave. i emailed someone on sfraves who seemed friendly,
and asked if i could join him in going to a party he said he was going
to. he said to call him, i did, and the rest is history. first i met his
friends, then i met their friends...

now i know many people, including several who are involved with throwing
"underground" parties. i've become involved with one such group myself,
just by asking someone how i could help out.

because of the bust at FnF, i knew fewer ppl than i normally would. so i
met people. i met _more_ people at FnF than i have _ever_ met before in
one night. _especially_ hanging out in the parking lot waiting for the new
location. people came up and introduced themselves, hugged, gave out
candy...

i only wish i could remember the names of everyone i hugged.

i know i met at least 5 sfravers i hadn't met before: Deeje Cooley, Jay
Wiley, BlackAdder, Tony Rotundo, and Tony Rose. i met a huge number (a
couple dozen? that's huge for me) of non-sfravers, including a few who
i'll be keeping in touch with outside of raving.

some tactics used for meeting people:
introducing yourself randomly.
giving out candy/stickers.
offering water (or hugs or anything else).
smiling.

sound hard? (it can be. i'm usually really shy, and there have been times
when everything on the above list has seemed impossible. but it's really
not.)

my point is this: sfraves/friends&family/etc. IS, in a sense, a clique.

but it's the easiest clique to join that i've ever seen. all you have to
do is put out a little teensy bit of "friendly energy", and you'll be
welcomed with open arms.

i am a case in point: i've gone from knowing nothing about raves and
nobody who raved, to knowing dozens of awesome people. and i met them all
at "underground" parties and/or through eachother.

i hope to see you at a party someday. to me, these parties are more about
"friends and family" (ie, people) than anything else, so i usually stick
to the undergrounds. (on thanksgiving day, i'm driving to modesto to see
my blood relatives, then i'm driving back in the evening to party with my
_real_ "family". i'd never do this to party with 6000 people i didn't
know. but that's just me.)

love,

brian

lachim@uclink4.berkeley.edu had this to say...

>so, what was FTT like? I hear from the list that alot of people had fun.

FTT was great, and I don't regret for ONE second not trying to get FnF tix.

>1) the bar outside. Selling alcohol at a rave? what the fuck???

No big deal. Some people like to drink to have fun, other prefer to take e
or smoke a bowl or two. They sell alcohol in most clubs I've been to. Why?
Because people want it, and isn't that what it's all about, giving the people
what THEY want?

>3) the brawl(s).

Didn't see a single one.

>4) seeing a dodgy, speed-dealer looking type of guy walk up to one of the
>ever-present cops and give him a phattie hi-five and a hug. hmmm...

Aren't we being just a LITTLE bit hostile and prejudice right here? Describing
someone as a "speed-dealer looking type" does NOT go hand in hand with PLUR,
or you think it does?

>7) having to walk through a line of hundreds of e-dealers on the way in,
>all of them whispering "ecstasy... e... x..."

Don't know why that would be a problem. It's not like one has to stop at every
dealer and talk to them about their merchandise.

>There's no way I'd pay $25 for a party where I was in any way doubtful of the
>crowd it was going to attract. (see: radio ads, dodgy promotions,
poster-sized
>flyers) 

Well, that's your point of view. Personally, I prefer to keep an open mind
towards events. Too bad a lot of people tend to swing from promoting Peace,
Love and all then to trying to discriminate some people. Does that make sense?
I think not.
(Yes, I know I bashed 6 in the Morning for Ground Zero, but their policy of 
letting girls ahead in the line is just another example of discrimation)

>My name was on the guest list for FTT, but I CHOSE to pay for my FnF ticket,

And you had a great time, right? So did most of the people who went to FTT,
how about we leave it at that? =)

Well I read and read about everyone else's Point of view on FTT.  And to
add my bit, all I have to say is:

		-Never will I attend a Funky Tekno Tribe again.


I had a stellar time.  I danced all night long.  Broke into a few
circles.  Threw down some serious moves.  Heard some serious beats and
breaks. Smiled, chatted, and had an all around grande time.

However...  

I stabbed at _Lust for Life_ when they had Ethan and Dutch on the flyer
allthough they were not confirmed.  
I voiced my opinion at Planetarium when A band (10BassT) was scheduled
that I knew would not appear.
And I feel the same way when I had to pay 12$ worth of water (throughout
the night) when it was advertised as free...

C'mon leave the lies to the politicans and propisitions.  If someone
says it free, then it's free (ie. chrystalsis, a few of the F-8 's).  If
it's not, don't lie.

We are come into this world with our word and honor.  Hydration is a
very important thing.  FTT broke it's word.  

There are other productions.
There are always other massives...

This is what I see as a very serious problem that can turn the massives vs
smaller parties thread even more negative...it is easy to feel resentment
towards the  people that attend massives and the promoters that throw
massives since through this sort of corruption they are allowed to get
away with blatant stuff while at FnF it was clear that there was nothing
but good vibes happening andFnF got shut down...but I think a really
important thing to remember is that that is a result of the police and
THEIR system, not the promoters or happy massive goers that just want to
have fun...just an attempt to identify the enemy...lets not let them turn
us on ourselves!

	I suppose what this argument is not really about elistism but
instead is how different cultures come together. The cliques that
exist in the smaller parties tend to not be very open to people who do not
use the same "standard" of communication - take all the threads on
gangsters as case in point. Then look at what happens when people from the
FnF lifestyle go to something like a Ghost tibe production - they feel
like the out siders at a G boy party, but those parties do not have very
vocal member of the sfraves community if they are present at all.
	Maybe this is not clear yet. My observations have benn each
culture has its own way of communicating. Things that in one cultures are
signs of respect may be interpreted as signs of aggression in the other
culture. An example, if you are waiting for the train in Glasgow, you
probably should not make eye contact with most of the people on the
platform because you must think you are some kind of hard ass to be eyeing
someone over there, even if they are standing by the Coke machine and you
are debating whether you want a soda for the train. The cliques of the
smaller party "elitist" community want everyone to be able to make eye
contact and smile, but that will get you killed in some parts of the
world. 

	So, as long as one is willing to communicate with the people at 
smaller parties on their terms, it is not an elitist community right? But 
wait, is it elitist to ask people to communicate with you based on the 
majority of people there will communicate with you in those terms? What 
if a certain cultures behavior brings the level of energy of the party 
down at a party where the majority of the people are aimed at pushing the 
energy through the roof (Ok, my personal thing)?!

	So how to reconcile the groups involved? How do we let people 
alone to do what they want without getting in the way of what we are 
trying to do? Which compromises do we make? How many compromises do we have 
to make? How many compromises are the other groups making in accepting an 
outsider? Do you know if the other person's silliness is an act or their 
hard ass stance is a front? Can you figure it out without talking to 
them? Do you want to figure it out? Are you an elitist if you don't?

	Somehow other parts of the world have worked this out because I 
have been to parties with more energy on the dance floor than 
almost any party I have been to here (although the Chyralis last December 
might have been about equal, especially if the needles wouldn't have been 
skipping due to everyone dancing so hard).

oh, blah!!!! didn't you ever understand that Planetarium never claimed to 
book the stupid band you were talking about?? It didn't go through when 
it was explained that nobody involved  had heard that name before? what are 
you, the fucking rave police??? you're starting to piss me off, buster.
leave the decent promotors out of this.  they have a hard enough time

maybe I can make it there. I need some excersize. As long as I can find the
damn place. $3 sounds cool. 

        I'll try to get there tonight, look for me alone, and probably in a
big long vertically striped long sleeve shirt thats basically blue with red
and white stripes. I'll probably also have a red windbreaker, maybe some
white cotton gloves, possibly a grey fisher hat (but most likely not), and
big blue jeans.
        If someeone sees me, please introduce yerself, I need someone to
talk to. All my friends are either asleep or at work. 

        I know, I'll strap a little strobe light under my shirt so I'll be
easy to spot.

Hello! This has been in the works for a while, and it's finally time
to announce it!

On Thursday, Novemember 28th 1996 AD, please join us for:
                    Thanksgiving!!!

This will be an evening to celebrate with good food and music, and
to give thanks for the wonderful people and things that we have in
our lives. :)

This party is especially dedicated to people who (like myself) are not
originally from the Bay Area, and have no family to see... or just
can't make it out to be with their families. Why have a boring night
alone, eating Ramen? Party with us instead!!! Let's make our *own*
family this Thanksgiving!

DJ's for the night:

Mystr-E (frequency 8)
John Carel (gateway systems)
Anon (look for her at mantra :)
Warren Parker (one track mind)
Jon Logan (ambiance during dinner)

Dinner will be provided by Raw, a restaurant in SF specializing in
raw, super-energizing foods, and of course will be 100% vegan :)

Dinner and ambient music will begin around 9pm-ish, with trance music
running until 7 the next morning. The party will be in San Francisco,
and due to the size of the location, we'll have room for only about
200 or so people, so come early! :)

voicemail: 415.248.1997 (saturn5)

from your favorite happy turkey, ;)

Steve

much belated
 a couple of thoughts from lunarseed

(1) what a nice guy at the map point.  does anybody know what's up with
the cool hunab ku cd he was giving out?
PLEASE HELP ME I CAN'T STOP LISTENING TO IT

(2) what a frightening neighborhood.  i was almost afraid to walk to the
party.  what a relief to get to the site itself.
  
(3) ran:d-dreams and everybody else involved in setting up the downstairs
- hooray!  wonderful decorations on walls and especially ceiling!  but!
i have never been in a more humid or muddier rave room - the pipes were
sweating before the room was half full ... i wonder why i didn't mind?

(4) cheers to dhiren for breaking the code - recombinant genetic
experiments in endurance dancing are HERE and AMONG US.  warning - hugging
them may result in enjoyable chromosome damage.

(5) question: is it normal to get RELIGIOUS delusions while dancing to
goa from 2 to 4 am?

(6) warning!  twirling the happy monkey may induce a trace-like state.

(7) question: what is goa gil's full name?
 [  ] goa gilligan
 [  ] goa gilgamesh
 [  ] goa gil
 [  ] other?

what a great night!  thank you ...
matthew.

p.s.
ESP is even more real than i know you think it is.
you're welcome, i knew you'd like to know for sure.

I usually do but i forgot my digital camera this time...at our office 
down here in Salinas we do have a scanner though and would be willing to 
scan photos anyone has.  If you got doubles when you printed them send 
them to us and when we are done with them we can send them back!

 crowd I've ever seen.  And everyone was so happy and *so* into the music.
 Immediately I felt some of my tension loosening, and next thing I know I
 am dancing like a fiend.  Astral Matrix really played some beautiful stuff

AAAHHHHHH!!!!  Reading these reviews is absolute torture.  I just have to 
hope there will be another one soon...

I stupidly only wrote down one number - the one that stopped working.  I 
was stuck at home with no access to the new directions!

A tragedy, I know.

At least I fell asleep before dawn, and got to feel all rested and 
healthy the next day (NOT the way I usually feel after dancing for hours 
on end and missing a night of sleep - the downside of raving :(

I'm happy for all of you that made it to site two!  --> you deserve 
special hardcore awards ;)

And this, my friends, is why I have been just DYING to get over there to 
live.  It's been a long 3 years since I started my quest of finishing 
school so I can get over there - now I have only 2 months left!:):):)

love & excitement,

I noticed this is also a weekly. Has anyone been to it? What's it like
and will this be at the same location? Can anyone who knows some of
the DJs (I've regretfully never heard you, Jonathan. ) tell what the
predominant sound at this party will be? Or what will be offered. 

I'm looking for a place to be Thursday night with a bunch friends
coming to town. Arrrgh, the pressure of being responsible for someone
else's good time. I'm sure we've all been there before :Z.  Thanks!

The part of your post that you had mentioned accidently hitting someone 
while dancing with your eyes closed particularily grabbed my attention.  

While on this general sfraves topic of comparing massives to more 
underground parties and how the "underground movement seems friendlier 
than massives", Branka's statement made me think of something that 
occured at the "very undergound" F&F party that happened Saturday night. 

I was dancing hard in the thick of the crowd right in front of the dj, a 
few people back from the tables.  The crowd was thick and in a dancing 
frenzy.  In that type of dancing crowd, getting bumped every now and then 
just happens and it is no big deal.  If I jab someone or step on their 
toes, I apologize.  

But there was this chick dancing in the thick of it with all of us and 
she was flailing her body around quite disrespectfully (to others).  She 
was taking up WAY too much room and she was right next to me, constantly 
bumping into me and not even acknowledging that she had done it.  Often 
her flailing hands would come within inches of my face and I was 
literally frightened that I would get seriouly scratched by her 
fingernails.  I really wanted to yell at her to knock it off, but 
didn't.  It did piss me off.

So my point is that this kind of behavior is not being reserved for 
massives.  It goes on in the most underground of small raves.

love,
Amy

Lots of people who didn't see the show when it appeared have asked me how
they can get a copy.  I taped it while I was gone (oh, the wonders of
programming a VCR a week in advance and actually having it work!), and
several others have mentioned that they have a copy.

Starchild in SF and Ann in the East Bay have expressed willingness to host
a small group sometime .. I'll try to coordinate a way for people to see it
.... so the question is....

1.  WHo wants to see the tape?
2.  Where do you live?  (generally ... i.e., SF, E BAy, S BAy, etc.)
3.  Do you have it on tape also, and/or are you willing to do it at your place?

Let me know who's interested and I'll figure out some logistics for getting
together (with or without me there doesn't matter, I just dont' want to
lend out my only copy of the tape)...

Love, Leslie

I read the littany of threads about all of the parties everyone attended.
It seems eeveryone had a good time.  To me, that is the good thing.

I just wanted to make note of some of jacks observations SINCE they are teh
same observations I've made about this list, and parties in general.

>From my view, we are all part of cliques.  ti cannot be helped.  I bleieve
someone said that everything is dependent upon the mode/method of
communication, and I agree.

I have not been to an fnf, ever.  I've wanted to go for years, but
something has always come up, I chock it up to karma, and the possible fact
I was not meant to go.  fnf isn't the only party I'm not to attend, burning
man is another...every year I plan, and every year something happens.  Oh
well.

Anyway I think Jack has some very good points as they relate to elitism and
cliques.  Sfraves, fnf, sandbox, and other small UG events are in many ways
cliques.  SFraves is a clique because you need a computer.  Fnf is becuase
it is an extension (to some degree) of SFRaves, sandbox is becuase you have
got to know one of the primaries to get in...and the list goes on.  In
other words, if you do not have access to the mode/method of communication,
you're automatically locked out.  Just a fact of dance culture (and believe
me, there are hundreads of thousands of people who have yet to rave, and
thousands who are looking for one to go to and STILL didn't find it DESPITE
four color flyers everywhere!).

Massives are massives and UG's are UG's.  The type of people forming these
groups will have a direct effect on the people in attendence.  FTT is all
about the brown, the guys who throw it are people of color, and it shows.
FnF has it's people, and it is refelcted in the crowd, it also shows.
Preston's parties have a mix, but homeboy is straight and his parties tend
to be a bit (if not totally) het.  And the list goes on and on.

I have come to accept the fact that if I want diversity, *I* have to throw
the dig myslef (like I used to, and yes, it showed), or just wait for
someone with my ideals to do it for me.  Some parties, due to the method of
communication etc. are exclusionary...not on purpose, but as a result of
said communication only being available or accessible by a very few.  And
those who are lucky enough to be in the communications chain will invite
thier friends, who are a reflection of themselves.  You get the idea.

So all in all, there is plenty in SF and the bay area for everyone and for
every type.  From the tech geek, to the circle dancer, there is plenty to
go around.  I'm pretty much through with pointing out the good or bad in
parties.  I mention it to close friends, but in general try not to rain on
anyones parade.  Since people are at least dancing and not killing each
other, I figure it's all good.  At least it's a small step in the right
direction.

As for breakin' into cliques, etc.  It just takes time, and a willing
guide.  Even *I*, with all my years of crackerjack socialization looks for
a guide before stepping into unfamiliar territory, no matter where it is.

With that, I'm glad everyone partied thier asses off.  I did mine a few
weeks ago, and it was all good.  Especially when I got home!

Take care all, and remember...don't call *me* a raver...instead, just call me,
John

Peace out.

P.S.  Bob Dole - nothing but a stinky pen, and a penchant for saying
"whatever" as he meanders toward defeat.  Pitiful...

Bill "George" Clinton - "I didn't inhale, but I slept with your wife."

H. Ross Perot - Just get under the hood and give me a lobotomy.

Harry Brown - just another pot smoking republican who wants to privatize
everything.

Ralph Nader - cheap bastard, and boy is he shrill.  The only enemy is a
corporation.

Natural Law Party - better living through meditation...I'll meditiate on it.

Taxpayers something or other - a not so cloaked ultra-right wing
bible-beating heretics out to make the world safe for fetuses everywhere.

Yep, I'm really proud to be an American...look at whose trying to represent
me, and not a female or person of color in the bunch.  Ys, as Dole ai,
we aredomd.

To those who had their friday evening cut short by the Oakland PoPo: Keep
your head up-underground. Shitty as it may sound, this is the way it's always
been, but as long as we don't change course, the system will.

Anyone who stuck around for the interim parking lot festivities or the garage
gathering knows the truth in this...

"You can put out the candle but you can't blow out the fire, once the flames
begin to catch, the wind will blow it higher" -Petee Gabriel

...cheezy as it(he,I) may be...

"Ahh yes waiter, I would like the French toast, Reagan will have the
waffle meal, Steve will have an *eggless* omlette(very Zen he said), and
Tony would like a beer."

;-)

I would also like to say that I saw many of us imbibing that night, wine
bottles being passed around at 6 in the morning and such, and not a
drunken frown to be seen. Really, it is all about the attitude. Alcohol,
like so many other drugs amplifies what is already present.

Ok so.. Funky Tekno Tribe. I certainly did not have a good time. What I mean by that is, 
I *MYSELF* DID NOT HAVE A GOOD TIME. But... THE PARTY FUCKIN' ROCKED!!!! The reason why 
I didn't have a good time was that my stomache felt like shit and I spent two hours 
looking for my little 'cuz. If it we'rent for that, I would have had the best time of my 
life!!!!

The party rocked! HomeBase warehouse was set up like Disneyland for ravers! It was soo 
colorful and phull of phat musik!!

Gotta say HI to the great people I got to hang around with. HI Sherry, Ryan, Erin, Alan, 
Terry, Rod, Jason, Janelle, ahem .. Cross-eyed-boy!

Umm.. HI Ariel, Branka!

T'was a good party, T'was a good way to start a 5 week break from raving. So when will I 
show up at another party? Probably Nov.16th.  .... maybe.....

Hey all!

Well I didn't expect to come up this weekend but unfortunatly my uncle 
and grandma both pasted away.  I came up to be with family and friends as 
well.  I thought...as long as I'm up here...

Well Friday I went to the Sound Factory.  I wasn't having a good time at 
the meatmarket so I decided to go find Russ street and check out Goa Gil.
I had trouble parking, forgot my tix at the map point and lost a friend 
but after all that I got to "spacestation" around 1am

I'd never heard Goa Gill before and I can't remember the last time I 
heard Adam but It was all good.  Great decor many black lights, very hot 
down stairs but I liked it - Everyone did!   Met some great interesting 
people (some I saw again at Sunset) and Caban got me movin'

Gil came on around 3 and WOW.  I tried my best to take a break and sit 
down but I couldn't doit. Something about that damn Goa just gets into 
your head, arms, legs, and body and you just can't stop moving.

I couldn't stay till the end because I danced the whole time I was there, 
and I left around 7am.  I was told that GG was to spin till 11 I couldn't 
stay that long.  Did he?   I had a great trip, Hunab Ku, C.C.C., Gil, 
Caban any every one else did a great job.  

Saturday was FTT but I am a broke college student and didn't have the 
money to pay for it.  I could have scamed it but I felt it wasn't worth 
it.  I tried to get on the guest list but ethan who was doing masage 
theropy had to pay as well so he couldn't get me in anyways.  My parent were 
gone so I had a few friends over and we just chilled and a friend brought over
 his tables.

I found out the next morning that another friend got me on the list but 
forgot to tell me and I could have gone for free anyways.  Doh!  Oh well 
there will be more FTT's and more massives to attend.  I'm glad you all 
had a great time.

Sunday I had to drive back to SLO but decided to go to the last sunset.  
And I'm Glad I did.  So many great faces, smiling, dancing and having a 
great time.  I saw so many people I hadn't seen in a while and Sunset 
made up for the missed evening at FTT.  I wish I could of stayed till hte 
end but it's a 3 hour drive home and I left at 6.30 to get home in time 
to finsh homework.  Believe me, I used some serious will power to drag 
myself out of the middle of all the grooving ravers to drive myself home.

If I come up again it might be on November 9th; other than that I won't 
come up till the Gathering.

Till the next~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

PLUR

Austin

mentioned in recent SFR calendars, scheduled for Thursday the 31st, but
that's not going to happen (venue trouble, I gather).  It will be Friday, 1
November instead.

Hi All,
Whew! What a weekend! We're still recovering. Four days of setting up the 
various rooms, dealing with missed flights, delayed baggage (containing 
records), pickups and returns of DJs from SF to Oakland and back, making sure 
a party of this size runs smoothly, running from room to room to catch a 
favourite DJ can take a physical and mental toll on one's body. First, I'd 
like to thank ALL who came out and supported FTT's four years of existence at 
our Halloween Tribal Massive. You were totally AWESOME! No serious incidents, 
a few minor bruises and scratches that our First Aid team professionally took 
care of, 7500 ravers in all shapes and forms... old schoolers, kids, freaks, 
suits, gangstas, metalheads, east bay, south bay, nerds, queens, kids from LA, 
Seattle, Portland ...were there with ONE purpose - to celebrate music and 
dance!!! And boy did we boogie down through the night!! My only regret was 
that I wasn't able to be in the Planet of the Drumz room for DJ Rap's and DJ 
SS's set... I heard it was legendary!!!
I would also like to make some apologies to all. Firstly, the lines WERE 
definitely too long and though we tried something different with the lines at 
Homebase this time... it didn't quite work. We're working on keeping that 
down. Secondly, the party started late, mainly due to last minute production 
set-ups. We're very into our production, so we wanted to make all the rooms 
just right, which ended up in last minute changes in set design.  And for the 
folks out there who did not have a good time for one reason or another, our 
personal apologies. Lastly, for someone who mentioned about alcohol being 
served, there wasn't any.
Massives cannot compete on the same level as smaller parties when it comes to 
that personal vibe. I go to a lot of parties talked about on SFRaves... and 
agree wholeheartedly. What we at FTT try to do is to try and create a 
compromise with the quality of music and production. We also want to spread 
the spirit of raving to the entire community of people who love music and love 
dance, which is why there was a diverse crowd last Saturday. It gave me a real 
good feeling when I saw some heavy-metal friends I forced to go last Saturday, 
actually standing up and grooving in their leathers and chains when Diesleboy 
pumped his thing!! And seeing rastas raising their hands when Springheel Jack 
played that totally wicked drum-and-bass raggae track!!  And when the circle 
dancers formed (one of them was actually a record company executive in a suit) 
and break-danced in the Quango Room to some excellent jungle that Tomas was 
spinning, I was totally blown away!!! Which is what raving is all about... it 
is for everyone because it is IN everyone... and massives are usually (though 
not always) the way to initiate the uniniated.
Anyway, I'd like to thank everyone once again for the support, encouragement 
and love we got. We've a few more events lined up before the year closes. On 
November 15th there is Funky Tekno Tribe vs Porno for Pyros aka rave vs 
alternative... we have a few interesting things lined up for this one. Come if 
you can. We'll also be throwing our last Organic in the Park for the year with 
a very special guest. Oh, for all of those who complained about how our web 
site sucked (yeah, yeah, I admit it did, but what do you expect when you use 
Microsoft's Frontpage wizards ;), check it out now...

welcomed!!

love and regards,

It's rare that I bother to give reviews these days,  I'm mostly content to
lurk on the list
and observe all the foolishness that goes down from time to time. 
Sometimes things
get so outrageous that I'm almost pushed to post but then again I say "why
bother".
But I felt this time that I really needed to post about this party because
it seemed that
a lot of people had a good time (myself included) and it also seemed that
several whiners
felt compelled to dis a party (for various reasons and to compare it to a
failed FnF which
(IIMHO) totally disses FTT and FnF.  I know the promoters of both parties
personally,
all of them have the utmost respect for the partygoes that come to their
party and a deep
reverence for the music played whether it is Trance or Trip Hop.  It was my
intention to go to
both parties that night but (in usual fashion :) I didn't get out of the
house and to FTT till
2 a.m. and by that time I heard FnF had been busted.  I felt bad for Ethan
cuz I know how badly he
wanted to bring the house down and have a kick ass party.  There is no
question in my mind that 
Ethan will deliver the goods in due time and have one killer make-up party.
I admire his stamina
and dedication cuz I know the workload he must be under.  That is why it
really bother's me to
hear so called "ravers" dising and complaining about FTT that was fortunate
to go off. I don't
understand where these people are coming from at all with that kind of
attitude.

As Allways :) Maybe a little grand-pa raver story is in order:

The guys from Funky Techno Tribe have been throwing parties for about 4
years. I remember when
they were considered the "new kids on the block".  I must admit that in the
past, FTT has thrown
some legendary parties and some parties that were horrible.  A lot of
people dissed and made fun of them in the past because they weren't into
the "hands in the air, mystical raver"  clique back when that meme was
popular. but during the Malachy tragedy, these boys came through and
distinguished themselves with levelheaded solid production skills when they
were needed the most, they played a
key role in raising money for Mal when it was needed and some of us never
forgot that they were 
there for the Family regardless of the petty and trite squables that may
have gone on before.  I know Kevin, Jerry, Hector et al. Have their heart
and soul into throwing good parties that transform young people's lives and
despite popular belief on this list, many a "gangsta"
(why is it that it seems that this phrase is only used to describe people
of color on this list :)
Has had their heart opened and turned around by the music and vibe that has
happened at FTT.
It may not have happened for you or me but IT DOES happen for many AND THAT
IS THE IMPORTANT THING! Not whether FTT makes a lot of money (frankly if
they keep throwing parties like the one last Saturday I hope they totally
get Paid IN FULL!!) or whether they bought off the police
transformation happens on many levels, if out of 7000 people 500 See the
Light, then it's worth 
paying off the police.  Kevin and Jerry are good businessmen, (I mean that
as a compliment :) They are in the business of throwing parties for a
living, they have lasted the test of time allong with Wicked, Martin, and
Preston all of whom throw parties FOR A LIVING (as opposed to working as
highly paid knowledge engineers  as many people on the list)
Massives are just that, they are Massive, they are designed to bring
together a wide array of people mostly people who have never been to a
party.  For many this was their first
Rave experience, and for many that night, FTT changed their lives, I saw it
on their faces,  I 
haven't seen it happen a lot at parites for a while but I definitely saw it
on a lot of young people that night and it connected me with that feeling
in myself that I remember (once I set  aside the jaded
attitude from years of raving :)  that feeling of WoW! this is so
wonderful! and these people are so beautifull and I can't believe that this
is really happening to me! Feeling.  I knew I was in the right place when I
 went into the "Techno room" and saw speaker tweekers, boys, gurls of all
shades grooving to Jeno, Wink and Sneak.  You know your in the House when
you can get black drag
queens (Like Foxy Brown) to come to a Rave, (cuz you know how the Children
are :).  To me, this was a trigger that this was not just an ordinary
massive, and yes, I knew this was the place when i saw that guy in the suit
start bustin moves in the Jungle Room :)  I walked all around this massive
party and saw serious pockets of Vibe everywhere, I caught several grooves
both in the Techno room and in the House room and, being as i was
completely sober that night (I wanted to evaluate the party based soley on
"unaltered merits")  I really felt that what I was perceiving was real and
genuine.  In fact,
for the first time in 2 years have I been able to close my eyes and trance
out without worrying about some fool bumping past me or feeling self
conscious. I felt enough of a vibe to feel safe at this party,
It was so wonderful to see Little Red Raver Girls next to big bad gothic
girls, homeboys from oakland, cowboys from concord, techno geeks, black
drag queens (you know its safe when they show up) all under one House.  If
this keeps up, I'm going to have to start going out 3 times a week again :)
NOT!   

Now to address some comments that were made in this general direction:


> 1) the bar outside. Selling alcohol at a rave? what the fuck???

Umm dude, what party were you at? I didn't see this. Now selling MEAT at a
party ain't my thing
(the last thing I want to smell if I'm off my face is searing carcass, but
it's not my party :)


> 2) the $2 water bottles. 2 bones is 2 much for water, esp. when the flyer
> says it's free.

I must agrtee here, FTT needs to be on the free water tip, period, it's
unsafe not to have free water availabe, if it's only just a specket.

> 3) the brawl(s).

I  saw no brawls while I was there, I supoose they could have happened but
even the toughest
guys that I saw seemed to be off their face (in an eXtremely good way) so I
didn't pick up much aggrow in the crowd, (though I'm 6'5" 300 lbs, black
and almost 40 so...) but I have friends who
are little white guys and they didn't feel threatened either :)

> 4) seeing a dodgy, speed-dealer looking type of guy walk up to one of the
> ever-present cops and give him a phattie hi-five and a hug. hmmm...

Dude, unless you know what's up you are completely out of line here. You
don't know what the fuck
was going down.  Over the years I have talked to and with many "Cops" at
parites. Consider the following:
	1) The Cop wasn't born a Cop, they might be curious and want to talk to
someone about
	    the event since so many people seem to be having a good time.

	2) While the Cop is talking he's not looking for people to bust.

	3) Police are people too, sometimes a personal relationship with someone
in Law 
	    Enforcement can defuse or prevent ugly situations from happening
before they start.

Besides I know several of the upper staff of Lyons and I know they do their
job well and are there to keep everyone safe. The Homebase complex is a
hard place to police efffectively,  Lyons (and the
people in charge of the Lyons security for thies parties have been doing
this for years, some of them 
have been raving as long as I have :)

> 5) getting kicked around and stepped on in the chill room, which
apparently
> had no beanbags, no couches, and no mattresses.

Oh poor baby,  try bringing some next time!!
Back in tha day (tee hee) When Equinox threw undergrounds, you might be
lucky if the
abandonded wearhouse  had a clean place to sit :)



> 6) Too too many high school girls walking around in large groups
clutching
> their handbags tightly with that "fish-out-of-water" look on their faces.

A full on Massive to someone not used to it can be a scarey thing, did you
try to 
make them feel safe and welcome?


> 7) having to walk through a line of hundreds of e-dealers on the way in,
> all of them whispering "ecstasy... e... x..."
> 

Well, judging from some folks that I saw in the crowd, some of them must
have had The Shit!!


> I don't even want to know how much FTT had to fork over to the Oakland PD
> to get their approval for the shit going down there. There's no way I'd

With this kind of attitude I'm glad you didn't come, too bad Ethan had to
put up with your bullshit.


Ethan works his ass off to throw good parties for the people that come, and
I know for a fact that
Ethan welcomes everyone who can hear about it and get tickets to his
parties. He has to limit the
number of people that would come to his party because he wants to keep the
prce low and affordable
and have a manageable underground party. He does that very well, but it
seems that some folks have
used the success of FnF to set up some sort of snooby FNF is kooler then
thou Vibe that a lot of people are perceiving, I KNOW this is not coming
from Ethan but I'm not sure about some of you 
who regularly attend FnF.  Massives are just that, they turn LOTS of people
on to the scene
all at once, when they are good they are evolutionary triggers. Small
Undergrounds like FNF
builds solidarity among the "families", it's  OK to go to both! They all
should be about the same thing which is connecting the goer to an intense
experience of Connectedness and Love.  Many people find
God/des on the dance floor both at tiny Undergrounds and at Massives, For
those who have
been so lucky to find a group of people that you can catch a groove and
explore with, please don't fall into the trap of thinking that your groove
is better then anyone else's if it works for you, that's
great but don't knock what works for someone else.

Kevin, Jerry, Hector. Mohan   NICE ONE!!

(Can't wait for the next )

( PLEASE Email replies to me, don't group reply either ... )

So.. as a 41 year old guy who doesn't quite have a handle on the young
folks terminology, I thought I'd ask this - what are folks meaning when
they describe "gangstas" at a party? 

 Reply to me, and I'll post a summary of the replies. Remember, I'm
only interested in what YOU mean by the term, not what you think 
others mean when they use the term. I feel I've been on SFRaves long
enough so that folks know I'm not going to "out" them just because they
may have an definition that not quite nice.

 Also, "gangstas" vs. "gangsta wanna-be's" ? 

 What I think the term means
 1. Guys who actually are in a violence-prone gang.
 2. Guys who want to look aif they belong in a gang.
 3. Guys who copy what rap artists are wearing.

You know, I was brosing through some old records and I have a Freaker's

Hi Everyone!  I just watned to tell you all that I had a wonderful time 
at FTT event onSaturday.  My friend, Denise, and I roadtripped it down 
there in 4.5 hours (usual 5-6hr drive).  When we got there, that p[arking 
lot was full!  we just cruised around until we foundthat muddy spot next 
to the fence that everyone had to walk by to get to the back side ofthe 
ware house.  My tiny little beat up chevy sprint fit really nicely into 
that debris pile!  :0  I'm sure many of you walked by my car!  It had a 
"do not disturb" sign in the side windw.  


ANYWAY!  Even thoug the line was huge, and the dealers were lined up to 
offer us e, all Denise and I could do was smile!  I felt so happy to be 
there.  So many people with smiles on their faces all grooving to intense 
music in every room.  When I danced myself too hard, I just walked around 
observing people in their bliss!  It was soo nice.  I couldn't keep a 
smile off my face!   

So I'm thanking everyone who went!  I had a blast even if I didn't meet 
you, you were probably one ofthose people around me enjoying yourself 
with thousands of others.  I look forward to going to a smallerevent 
where I may meet some of you.  

Oh!  The scenery in any of those rooms!  Was that the shit or what?  
Roman statues, a fountain, netting hanging from the ceiling, a scafforld 
surrounded by trees, all the plants!!!  wow,   andthe columns of water in 
the small room.  Everything was groovy to me!  I am coming down again, soon!

Good morning everyone!

I had a three day weekend so I wasn't able to give a review on "PHONO"!  It
was an amazing place.  Small but it was intimate!  Everyone was in good
spirits.  I got no bad vibes from anyone!  The music was incrediable all
night!  I danced  for 4hrs straight before my body just gave up! =)  The
visuals were good to!

I got there right in the middle of John Howards set then came Loren and
then Galen (I think).  I was completly sober and loving it!  By the end of
the night my body was on automatic, but it felt like I was floating!  I was
having a great time.  Thanks to John and Loren they had a great party!
Looking forward to the next one guys!

Me too.

>p.s. any junglists out there?? :P

I'd listen to it occasionally, and thought it was cool but nothing special.
After FTT, it is all I've been able to think about: the bee's knees. Now I
just want to know what some good stuff to listen to is. Any suggestions?

Terrence.

p.s. Thanks for the hug at the obsidian booth, whoever you are.

Yes!Ye!Yes!

This weekend can be summed up by this ambient track on a compilation 
called Chill Out or Die. The song is Irrestible Force (San Francisco).

That is what I felt at both Lunar Seed and Friends and Family. As Jay put 
it "This is what it is all about!"

Thank you all for everything.

Many thanks to the Lunar Seed people for the cd 
and the stickers. That Cd has been on repeat....repeat... repeat. Yes!

Thank you Goa Gil for taking me all the way ..... again. 

Much Peace and Love
Too many people to name individually
Love

yeah...If you liked the melodic soulful stuff check out Goldie or T Power. 
The new compilation on Metalheadz "Platinum Breaks" is a nice piece of wax (or 
plastic) that covers the spectrum of styles. LTG Bukem's Logical Progression 
is a cool 2 cd set that features a virtual timeline of jungle on one disk and 
then has a continuous mix of newer stuff on the other. For more out there 
sounds try Photek or Plug. I assume you're wanting cd's...

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ron Winchel, professor of Psychiatry at Columbia University,
addressed a crowd of about 150 people last night, October 22,
on Ecstacy, MDMA, and its potential for good and harm. He said
that as of today there is no conclusive proof that MDMA causes
permanent brain damage, but the latest research suggests this
is possible.

He spoke on the topic "Ecstasy: What Every User Should Know"
at the Lesbian and Gay Community Services Center at 208 West 13th
street. Professor Winchel is a consultant to "Project Connect",
the center's effort devoted to prevention, intervention, education,
and other activities related to drug usage.

Professor Winchel also maintains a private practice.

At the presentation, a handout was available which I included
below.

I was very impressed by Professor Winchel. He is knowledgeable,
speaks well, and illustrated his talk with pertinent slides.
He elaborated on the handout and the slides from memory,
and covered the issues which I have which are related to Ecstacy.

He stayed for a long time after the presentation answering
questions from the audience. In fact, he continued until there
were no more questions. I admire that approach.

He will speak again in the near future on the subject of K.
He also has studied other drug usage. He pointed out that
unlike most other drugs - marijuana, coke - which pretty much
have no measurable brain damage once they have left the system,
preliminary indications suggest ( but have not proved ) that
E does damage to the brain which continues after usage has
stopped. He said that research is under way right now to
finally resolve the question of brain damage in humans:
and that a final definitive answer can be predicted to be
available in two to three years.

I will comment futher after presenting
the two page handout here.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Ecstacy (MDMA)

1. What is MDMA?

A chemical synthesized in 1914
In 1980s someone discovered its "psychotropic" (mind altering) properties.
It's a chemical similar to amphetamine. Its effects in the brain
are similar to - but not the same as - LSD.

2. What does it do in the brain when you take it?

First, a brief lesson in how the brain works:

   [[[Drawing of two pear or beaker shaped things called cells
   [[[with the bottoms facing each other, containing little
   [[[circles, labeled cell1 and cell2. There is an arrow
   [[[pointing from cell1 to cell2.

Almost everything the brain does happens
by one brain cell sending messages to other brain
cells. (Brain cells are called neurons.)

The first cell makes little packages of special chemicals.
The cell ejects these chemical packages into the space between
cells, and other cells pick up these chemicals that are floating
around.

After the 2nd cell picks up these chemicals, the chemicals set off
a whole chain reaction of other chemical processes. That is how
the brain does its jobs.

Most psychotropic drugs (including drugs that people use to get
high and medications like antidepressants) work by affecting
this process. Basically, they speed up, slow down, increase,
decrease, or otherwise modulate the process of a chemical
message being sent between cells (a process called neurotransmission).

3. What does this have to do with MDMA?

MDMA causes an immediate surge of secretion of one of these
neurotransmitting chemicals (serotonin) - causing a sudden
increase in serotonin neurotransmission. It has other effects
as well, but this is the primary one.

4. Is this responsible for the high?

Probably. It also causes some effects in another neurochemical
system - the dopamine system. But most of what we are talking
about today is probably related to serotonin effects.

5. Why is the serotonin system important?

The serotonin system is a major player in controlling the
function of multiple brain activities. These include the
regulation of mood, anxiety, sleep, memory, body temperature,
sexual function - the list is very long.

6. What are the immediate effects of MDMA?

Psychological Effect - Short Term                Physiological Effects
----------------------------------------------------------------------
elevated mood                                 |  inc. heart rate
"heightened sensual awareness"                |  inc. blood pressure
decrease in libido                            |  dry mouth
"closeness" with others                       |  decreased appetite
hallucinations - uncommon                     |  jaw clenching
from a self-report study of 20 psychiatrists: |  decrease in erectile
function
    inc. ability to concentrate               |  rats - inc. locomotor
activity
    dec. defensiveness                        |         inc. heart rate
    dec. fear                                 |         inc. temperature
                                              |  Probably same as in people
----------------------------------------------------------------------

7. So - what is the concern

There is mounting data which suggest - suggest rather strongly -
that exposure to MDMA may cause long term damage to the cells
which produce and secrete serotonin.

8. Is this different from other drugs?

Yes. By and large, most other drugs that people use to get high -
except for "crystal meth" - cause only transient changes in the
neurochemistry of the brain. Long-term changes in brain cellular
anatomy are uncommon with other mind alterning substances.
("Crystal" may also cause long-term effects. Other drugs may as
well, when used persistently.)

9. What is the specific nature of the potential damage?

Synopsis:
- Extensive studies with laboratory mice, rats, and monkeys demonstrate
that administration of MDMA leads to significant depletion of serotonin.
- This serotonin deficit is associated with destruction of the parts of
serotonin cells which secrete serotonin.
The damage may last for many months - or longer.
- Studies of this kind cannot be directly done with humans.
- But indirect evidence gathered with human MDMA users have provided
preliminary evidence that there may be prolonged deficits of
serotonin in the brain of some users.

10. But are the doses which are used recreationally likely to do this?

That may be the case. Recreational doses tend to range between one
and two milligrams per kilogram of body weight. Studies with different
laboratory species suggest that species higher up on the evolutionary
scale are more vulnerable to smaller doses. In studies with some
monkeys, single exposures of as little as 5 mg/kg have been associated
with serotonin deficits. Therefore, it is possible that a user may
come close to such doses if they do several "hits" at once, or in
close succession. Since humans are evolutionarily "higher", they may
be even more vulnerable. The longer a serotonin cell is, the more
vulnerable the cell may be. Since human brains are larger, serotonin
cells may be much longer.

11. So, if MDMA does cause this effect in humans, does that mean that there
is any actual harm being done?

We don't know. Such studies have not been done - and are not easy
to do. But several factors raise concerns:
- serotonin function is important in many brain functions
- some individuals may start out with vulnerable serotonin systems, e.g.,
people with mood and anxiety disorders.
- there are a fair number of clinical case reports which suggest that
some cases of unusual and severe disorders of anxiety may have been
precipitated by MDMA use.
- for people who may already have pre-existing depression, the benefits
of antidepressants are, in part, dependent upon intact serotonin
function, i.e., decreased serotoning may inhibit the benefits of
antidepressants.
- and, we may not see the effects of serotonin deficits for many years.
There is a normal decrease in serotonin as people age. The margin of
safety may decrease with time if serotonin deficits do occur and are
maintained over time.

12. Are there any special considerations regarding HIV?

Yes. HIV infection causes decreases in brain serotonin - as do some
other viral infections. This may reduce the margin of safety.

13. Given these concerns, can anything be done to reduce the potential
risk among users?

Maybe. It should be repeated that there is as yet no strong evidence
that there actually is a problem - but based on the existing animal
data, there is strong reason to be concerned.
The mechanism by which MDMA causes the serotonin changes in animals
is only partially understood. But, a leading possibility is that
certain chemical compounds, called "free radicals", may be produced
by MDMA action in the brain. These compounds can be quite toxic, and
may be the source of the long term cellular damage seen in lab
animals. It is possible that free radical accumulation can be diminished
by certain "antioxidant" vitamins, in particular vitamin E. It would be
reasonable for MDMA users to think of taking vitamin E, about 1000 i.u.,
international units - vitamin E is always labeled this way. It should
probably be taken for at least a week before and continue for a week
after exposure. This duration is speculative. NO ONE SHOULD READ THIS
AND CONCLUDE THAT IT PREVENTS POTENTIAL MDMA INDUCED CELL DAMAGE.
It may help. It should be said that the only definite way of preventing
the potential for damage is not to ever use it.

In addition, the potential risks for MDMA may be exacerbated by
dehydration and elevated body temperature - both are conditions
which are typical of dance clubs. One should pay careful attention
to drinking non-alcoholic fluids and cooling off in these environments.

14. Are there any other concerns regarding MDMA?

Yes. In addition to the - still speculative - concerns about serotonin
deficits, there are a number of case reports of other medical
complications. These include potential life threatening heart and
liver problems. There are a number of reports of death possibly
associated with MDMA use.

15. Bottom Line:

The evidence that MDMA causes meaningful damage to brain serotonin
cells is based on extrapolation from effects in laboratory animals.
There is some indirect evidence for long-term serotonin deficits in some
users. Definite evidence is still lacking. (But that is only because
few investigations have been done, as yet. There is also no evidence
that says it is safe.)

Certain individuals may be at increased risk. These include people
with depression, anxiety problems, and HIV.

------------------------------------------------------------

I want to suggest that anyone who has any specific concerns
about how this information applies to them should see Professor
Winchel in his private practice. I found him not to be harshly
judgmental, but rather understanding and compassionate.

He showed a slide and summarized the results of three
investigations into the neurotoxicity of MDMA. He said the
first study in the mid-1970s showed no brain damage. He
commented on a second study but I do not have those notes
available right now. He said, however, that the most recent
study in 1985 by McCann showed definite and permanent brain
damage. He said that there were two groups, one of 30 people
who had not used MDMA, and 28 who had, and the 28 who had used
MDMA showed permanent brain damage.

Professor Winchel showed a slide of a tree with lots of long
branches extending up from a root. He said that in some ways
this resembled a cell in the brain, and that the branches could
be thought of as being like axions which extend out from the
brain cells and communicate with other branches. He said that
MDMA research in animals shows that MDMA causes the branches
to wither and die, and that if they regrow after taking MDMA
is stopped, then they regrow slowly and usually in a pattern
which suggests chaotic growth rather than orderly growth.

He said that this effect had been observered to be stronger
in higher level phylums - creatures more like humans - than
in the lower levels, and could be shown to occur at dosages
of 5 mg of MDMA per 1 kg of body weight.

He elaborated on whether there was a level of use which might
be within a threshold of safety. He made it clear that he was
not recommending use of the drug, and that the only truly save
course would be not to use it. However, if someone were to use
it, he thought at a maximum of two or three times a year might
be a level of usage which would not a level of high risk. He also
recommended that any use be preceded and followed by a one week
course of Vitamin E.

He said that he is now taking Vitamin E and other antioxidents
as is virtually everyone at Columbia's neuropsychiatric unit.

He said that typical street dosage is reported to be between
75 and 125 mg. That the level of safety would be limited to
one "hit". Never do more than two hits at once at that could
exceed the 5 mg of MDMA per 1 kg of body weight dosage which
has been shown to be harmful in certain species.

He said that he thought that the reputed positive effects of
E in the nature of increasing empathy was more a function of
lowering peoples inhibitions. He said that he thought that most
people had an expectation that they would be rejected by others
which was probably wrong, and that when people got over their
inhibition in approaching a stranger they were able to form
a bond which was more a factor of starting the conversation with
them than a factor of improved bonding.

Humorously, he said that he thought empathy meant something
more than agreeing with someone at the end of the evening
that the dj played too much techno music.

He was asked about combining E with K or GHP. He thought it was
a mistake. He pointed out that a known side effect of GHP is coma.

He also said that a hallucinogenic reaction to MDMA was unusual,
and it is not a hallucinogen for most people.

the irrisistible force is mixmaster morris...I think that he put out the

if you liked any of that style on the chill out or die series than you

Lessons of this weekend:

1.  Ariel has now *officially* burned out on filled-past capacity
trance parties.  No really, I mean it this time:  I fell asleep in a
corner at Lunarseed.  I woke up briefly, stood in line for the
bathroom for 40 minutes, and then JUST when it was my turn, Goa Gil
cut in line!  "Um, my name is Gil, and I'm djing next and I gotta pee
real bad...would you mind if I went in front of you?"  Yeah, yeah,
sure sure.  Then as he's in there, a nauseous partier asked if she
could go in front of me "I have to puke...please?".  Yeah, yeah, sure
sure...My kidney infection is only in the early stages.  No really,
The biggest lesson was Ariel Needs A Nap On Friday Evening Or She
Can't Go Out.  I know you all care.  Grumpy Gruvers & Goa Gil do not
mix well.

2.  Under-attended parties in the park can be fun!  I had the BEST
time at Space Children!  Yeah, tourists to gruvers were about 3 to 1,
but that was ok!  I danced and danced, and noticed two women who had
been standing there watching for probably close to an hour, and so I
hopped down and ran up to them and said "Hey!  If you think it's fun
to watch, you should try dancing to it!"  They then just WENT OFF
about how wonderful it was to see people dancing so freely and
happily...they were like "be glad you're young!"  Keep in mind these
women were in their late 20's MAYBE, so I'm like "well, some of us
are young, but not all!"  When I told them I was 21 they were in
shock and sheepishly admitted that they thought I was 16 because I
was smiling so much.  !  It was a neat afternoon though...educate the
tourists!

3.  Funky Tekno Tribe?  Lots o' lessons from that one:  Hmm, you can
cut your wait in line from 2 hours to 10 minutes if you are a girl by
yourself, you know how to flirt with drunk sophomores in highschool
("ooh!  Is that a 40 of old E you've got there?!  mm, yummy!  Can I
have a sip?  giggle giggle") and have no conscience, all of which I
was, did, and didn't have...much to my chagrin.  Next lesson?  Taking
a little 20 minute nap immediatly after taking one's e is QUITE a
weird experience when you wake up.  My first sensation?  "Wow.  My
feet are in my shoes.  Mmm.  My feet:  They're in my shoes. 
Feeeeeeeet....Shoooooooooes....."  Next lesson?  At least there's
LOTS of room to dance at massives!  Phil Smart was awesome, and the
little Quango (or whatever it was) room had awesome trip hop in the
morning.  Other lessons?  Journeez Jeans is making these awesome
SUPERPHAT >>FUR<< PANTS that have 30" cuffs!  NICE!  I stood and
chatted with those kids about rave fashion for a long time...HOW
WEIRD, yet enjoyable.

4.  Someone at Sunset stole my friend Dandilion's backpack from under
her feet while she was dancing.  That sucks.  At the last sunset,
where the vibes of love and community are the strongest, and her bag
got swiped and then looted (she found disks and papers in the
bushes...but not car keys, wallet or organizer.)  Sad sad thing.

Anyway, there's my weekend's lessons.  This weekend I'm heading back
up to Seattle for a few days!  FUN!  Show the ol' hometown kids how
it's done! ;)

        Just a random thought. . . 

        This guy knows what he was talking about. It sounds like he's
totally open to all of the people that were there, and he liked it.

        Also, who's dj SS's ???
        I met a guy who gave me his number inviting me to a party Sat, where
his brother, DJ Esses, or SS's was djing. ?>???

        I wish I went. ohwell

I went home for lunch and decided to spin alittle and put on one of my new
records I bought Sat. I believe the label was Noom Records #21 and listened
to AXIS. That is one SICK track. I heard it sometime in the past 2 weeks
and when I was listening to it today, I was closing my eyes and I could see
the people dancing to it at whatever party it was I heard it first. Anyway
I just wanted to let you know that this song is Bad Ass.

        WOW. . . I guess I could say that that was one of the best
gatherings I've attended. Mostly just because of all of the people I met and
talked to. The music was great, the people were all cool (except for this
one chick and this one guy who just danced like they had problems). To all
of you who haven't gone to a weekly party like this, do it, you'll meet most
of the people you'd like to meet, and everyone is having a good time. But
there were a lot of people sleeping too (HOW?).

        Thanks to all you guys who made it really fun for me, (you know who
you are), and I'm really glad I was introduced to all of you. 
        I'm still not really straight on what beat is what type of music???

        look forward to more in the near. . . 

SMILE:)

Subject: F&F apology
Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

I'd like to apologize for a situation that occurred with F&F on
Saturday.

As you may know, about an hour and a half after the initial bust, we
ended up moving the party to a small space in Redwood City. We finally
decided this after unsuccessfully checking into several spaces in SF,
all of which could have at least accommodated 200-300. At the time the
decision was made to move, the only ones who knew about it were those
who had remained at the first location. I changed the voicemail to
reflect our decision and intended to post directions once we'd set up
and knew that the new space was viable. Honestly, I didn't feel there
would be many people willing to drive down to the new location.

Upon arrival at the new space about 2am (PST), a large crowd was waiting
and two police cars stopped to check the situation out. They thankfully
let us have the party, but it was obvious we had as many people there as
the space (basically a small commercial garage) could safely contain and
we feared that the arrival of any more people could result in a mob
scene and a completely demoralizing 2nd bust. I've been painfully aware
of the perception of exclusion that has been directed at F&F lately and
I felt that leaving a message on the voicemail to the effect that we
were continuing the party but couldn't let anyone else in would merely
reinforce that image - despite the fact that we had no way to open the
party to more people, as much as we wanted to. So I left a message
saying the 2nd location didn't work out, which has evidently led some to
believe we were being less than truthful and has led to some hurt
feelings. At the time, I felt that was the best way to handle the
situation, and still feel that there was no way that we could have let
anyone else into that space - and I certainly didn't want people driving
to Redwood City only to be turned away.

Once the space cleared out a bit, I changed the voicemail again and
posted directions, as we could then accommodate more people. This was
about 5am (PST) and the party continued until about noon.

In retrospect, I should have been more straightforward about what was
happening and given our reasons for not initially giving directions to
the 2nd space. The F&F crew is painfully aware of how difficult it is to
obtain tickets and we're always struggling with ways to sort out ticket
distribution in the most equitable manner. The fact is, there will never
be enough tickets for everyone. We have no intent of being elitist or
exclusionary, and I'm personally quite troubled that we're being accused
as such. We're open to any and all views and suggestions and we're
working on these issues constantly.

Thanks,

Joe

RE: Joe Rice's recent "F&F apology" post

 After the fact, I'm sure a lot of folks will have suggestions about how
the voicemail situation could have been handled differently. I've been
to that garage, and it's not designed for a large gathering at all. I 
didn't make it to the 2nd half party, but no hard feelings on my part!

 Friends and Family has always been mindful of maintaining a comfortable
match of dance space and crowd. The one exception that I can think of
( the "infamous" Acme warehouse bust ) was overcrowded due to non-FnF 
scalpers counterfeiting the tickets and the maps and selling them to
people that overcrowded the site. Lesson learned - ever since, FnF have
used tickets that can't be easily duplicated !

I just wanted to thank everybody on the list for being so damn DIVERSE and
INTELLIGENT.  I have actually learned a lot by subscribing to sfraves.
Sure...things get petty and stupid sometimes...but overall it's pretty good.

I have posted a few things on here...some would probably fit in the stoopid
pile, but that's ok.  I have also seen a lot of feedback to both mine and
everyone elses posts and it amazes me how many good points ppl bring up(on
both sides of most issues).

It just makes me realize how different we really all are.....but...it also
makes me realize how much we ALL have in common and how so many of us are on
the right track to being happy.

I'm not trying to disresect the FTT crowd (a GANG of my friends were there,
and they had a great time) but I tend to get REALLY suspicious when an rave
promoter feels the need to advertise on alterna-rock-radio to get a crowd.
Who exactly were they trying to attract??? I think if they were going for
"ravers" (draw your own conclusions on that term =) they would have let the
strength of their *unbelievably good* lineup attract people. However, the
promotion involved with this event reached and almost exceeded the type of
promotions I'd expect for a Lollapalooza or Kamp KOME or something tike
that... I'm not at all against massives, but I DO think the best way to be
introduced to any aspect of the scene is through friends who know what's
going on and can help "ease" you into it... I didn't have this benefit when
I first started going to parties, and I think that's why I didn't enjoy it
as much. But once I started meeting people and gaining friends who could
show me around and guide me a bit, I began to have a lot more fun and work
with th parties alot more.

take care,
-m.

*oop!* <sound of foot hitting back of mike's throat>

OK, what I meant was: This production went off because they had the dough
to pay off the Oakland PD, the Oakland permit crooks, the owners of
homebase, all those DJs, and everyone else. That's cool if you've got a
pile of cash to spend and blow it all on a kickin' party, but somehow I get
a much better, warmer, *fuzzier* feeling inside when I know that a crew
like frinds and family can do the same, except everyone's time is
donated... I seriously doubt that DJ Dan or Jeno or DJ SS were hanging out
in the morning pushing brooms around and thanking FTT for for *letting*
them play at that party. It's more of a professional money-involved
atmosphere that just doesn't attract me as much. It was more of a
production than a party, which isn't bad necessarily (see: martin's ragers
=) but it definitely wasn't as *pure* as what I've experienced at smaller
parties. From what I've heard about the way-early rave scene in england,
the UG trance scene in SF is alot more in touch with the beginning than
what I see at the big parties.

take care,
-m.

Hi-

 I hope somebody on the list will know the answer to this:  Is it possible to 
take a discman and use it with your third channel on a mixer?  I feel like 
experimenting with a couple of different ideas while I'm mixing my vinyl, but I 
have no idea if plugging a cd player will allow me to hear a CD through the 
mixer.  Thanks!

Buy a plug that fits your headphone jack on one end(prolly either 1/4 inch
or 1/8 in male,) which turns into an RCA on the other end.  Plug the 1/4
inch or 1/8 inch side into the headphone jack, and the RCA side into the
mixer.

Presto.  You'd be surprised what you can run through a mixer.  I wired my
bellybutton once.

-b))merang

(you can get the  plug at radio shack for 3-4 dollars.)

No, when someone looks like a "total pimped-out speed dealer"to you, YOU are
the one who's putting thought into that image. It's YOU who perceive him/her
as a "total pimped-out speed dealer". When I wear a tee that says "DOPE" on
it,
people approach me and ask me for drugs. That's because THEY think I'm
selling,
not because I try to look like a dealer. It's all in the eyes and mind of the
beholder. =)

I have to agree, people approaching you when you're dancing is a pain. That
didn't happen to me at FTT though, and therefore I'm in no position to talk
about that.
However, I have to say that the dealers standing outside or right by the door
don't bother me when I'm at a party, cuz I'm not anywhere near them unless I
want to buy something. =)

Well, I DID have a bad experience at Ground Zero, and I'm not going to another
6 in the Morning event. But I still don't feel that ALL massives suck. A lot
of people on this list kept telling us how bad FTT was going to be as early
as two weeks ago. Obviously, they were wrong. =)

Well, that's true. We could always gab about something else though, like what

How about just *one* massive.....just to see what would happen.  See if the
incredible vibe that has been produced and contained within the evolving
group of 300-600 could carry to a couple or few thousand.  Get the required
permits and what not and just let everyone who wants to come come.  I'm sure
tons of people would be willing to volunteer to make it happen as always (me

Wow.. Thanks for your words of support! It's great to get
feedback (positive or negative, as long as it's
constructive.. although I prefer positive for some reason :)

Well, I'm gonna take a stab at describing the kind of things I
like, but I know that I'm going to miss a lot.

Categories of music are useful in order to get within the
right ballpark, but to be any more specific, I often find
that the best way to talk about music is by knowing your
artists and record labels.

Techno (or Detroit Techno)
   Medium paced (130bpm or so, typically), with a beat
strongly influenced by chicago house. Dark and moody, but
with an underlying sense of beauty. Often minimal (drum
beats + one or two synth noises), but not always so. When
there is a melody, it tends to be repetitive and on the
subdued or atonal side. Like chicago house, there is an
emphasis on production which subverts traditional beat
structures, such as by sticking in an extra measure here and
there, putting in beat patterns on the half-beat, repeating
sections backwards and forwards, and adding synth lines
which repeat at odd intervals (such as 5/4).

   labels: M-plant (experimental, minimal, complex rhythms)
           +8 (2nd wave detroit, clangy, abstract)
           Phono (housey, upbeat)
           UR/Red Planet (jazz/hip hop influenced, dark, beautiful)
           Planet E (discoey, groovy, quirky)
           Reload (dark, hard)
           Communique (Warm groove, abstract and minimal)

   artists: Rob Hood, Derrick May, Richie Hawtin, Carl Craig,
            Cristian Vogel, Luke Slater, Steve Bicknell

Electro
   Originally a form of breakdance music, the recently
revived electro movement typically features round, fat kick
drums, squelchy analog synths, and, more often than not, the
808 cowbell arranged in a slower (120bpm? sometimes
slower?), hip hop-like pattern. Vocoded voices (i.e., human
voices processed through an effects unit and made to sound
like a synthesizer) are common.

   labels: Metroplex (classic)
           430 West/Direct Beat (electro + techno bass)
           Clear (offshoot of rephlex, experimental, melodic & quirky)

   artists: Ectomorph, Dopplereffekt, Will Web, Drexciya, Aux 88

Trance
   Strong four on the floor beat, usually around 135-140bpm,
emphasis on melody, often features at least one breakdown
per track with corresponding buildup. Hard trance tends to
be more repetetive, with less emphasis on melody.

   labels: Synewave, Hybrid, Loop

Acid
   This word can refer to the earlier acid house movement,
but more often just refers to any song with a predominant
303 sound, or other similar analog burble. Acid tracks tend
to have no melody except for the 303 (or multiple 303s), and
the drums tend to be an 808 or 909, often distorted.

   artists: Acid Junkies, Mike Ink

Trax
   A term for minimal chicago-style house, with a banging
somewhat off-kilter beat and often with a cut-up vocal
sample. I include this here because you hear it all the time
when people try to describe minimal music of any type. "Kind
of tracky," they might say, "but with a weird jazzy line on top."

   labels: Dancemania, Relief, Accelerate
   artists: Boo Williams, Dan Bell, Green Velvet


That's all for now. Let me know if you have comments.

We've actually volleyed this about a bit in the past, but the main
contravening factor is the massive budget required to do a legal massive.
Just for location and permits, I wouldn't be surprised if the trade center
in Oakland (behind HomeBase) pushes $20,000. This is before security - I've
found to be legal you'll often be required to have licensed, bonded
security guards. And one thing we're not prepared to do is push the price
above $5.

I'll bet a 2000 person F&F would go off, though!

Hmmm... I'm going to have to think about this for awhile. I tend to get a
little wrapped up in my own "rightness" sometimes without thinking... but
to respond: there defintely are societal stereotypes about what certain
types of people look like. And when someone dresses/acts like the societal
stereotype for, say, a "speed dealer," they're either:

a) trying to break the restrictive bounds of stereotypical dress and the
conventions of modern urban society by affecting the mannerisms of the
stereotyped, while simultaneously commenting on the inherent stupidity of
labelling people based solely on their appearance and apparent membership
in a perceived clique

or:

b) a speed dealer.

I usually tend to believe (b). =)

I don't think all massives suck... I had afuckin' blast at Freedom this
summer, and I'm patiently waiting for the Gathering. (and HOPING that it
doesn't happen after December 18th) But there definitely are different
crews with different associated vibes. I'm softening up a bit towards FTT
after their last "thank you" post.

Subject: The Spirit of Halloween - This Thursday
To: sfraves@hyperreal.com
Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk



Now that all the hype from FTT is passed, It's time to get raedy for a 
REAL Halloween rave, Not just a party on Halloween....You Know What I 
Mean?!?

I don't Know if I saw more than just a handfull of people dressed up in 
costumes or even trying to get into the Halloween Spirit at the FTT 
Massive.  Mabee All the COOL ravers that enjoy dressing up and having a 
REAL Halloween EXperience are saving their juices for this Thursday,  
At least I am.    

Let me ask you something?!?

What is the spirit of raving all about???
What is the spirit of Halloween all about??

To me, Halloween is like the biggest rave-like holiday of all time.  It
reminds me of my childhood.  Its It takes me back to a time of
being young and getting all dressed up and having everybody smile at 
you.  A day when being goofy, weird, odd, strange, scary, or anyway, 
and nobody judges you because its Halloween.  And on top of it, You get 
candy and love for being the special person you are. 
It seems like Raving has adopted many of its most positive virtues from 
the SPIRIT of Halloween.  For this reason I like to think of Halloween 
as the Birthday or NewYears of Raving.  Especialy for a city like San 
Francisco,  Also known of as "Halloween On The Bay".  Halloween around 
here is truely a special ocasion.

This Halloween: Thursday, October 31st;  Come and rejoyce the Beautiful
spirit of raving by escaping into a celebration for the SPIRIT of 
Halloween.

In 1992, Feel Good E., and others introduced you to CASPER.   Now we 
are going to regress even furthur down the evelutionary ladder, and 
start from scratch.  SPIRIT will be a diferent type of Halloween rave.  

We will have  Lots of candy, free stuff, many surprises, toy and prize 
giveaways, games, a MaskaRave costume contest, and an incredible 
decorative Halloween production, with special guests and surprises 
throughout the night.  

There will be an incredible Holistic Haunted House by NEXUS.  With tons 
of surprises and incredible decorations, and 2 rooms of Music.

The dj's for the night will be:

In the SPIRITual Mausoleum:
Dj's:  Garth, Simon, Kimo, Jazz-E, Tayco, Matthew, Jonathan, & Jin

In the ThurZdaze Beat-Crypt:
Dj's:  Ghost, Frank Nitty, Essence, Tripnotix, Paucus, Spinner, & Chad

The party will go all night long,  from 9pm till 6am.  We hava a ton of
safe and secured parking.  Its a real relaxing feeling to be able to 
party and know that your car will be there when you are ready to go 
home.  We are also very close to public transit for those of you that 
don't drive.

THIS is going to be a REAL Halloween Rave for REAL Halloween Ravers.  
Admision is only $10 if you wear a costume and bring toys or 
Trick-or-Treat candy to share.  Door prizez will be given for the best 
and most creative costumes.

The SPIRIT of Halloween is all about FUN.  You can dance like a freak 
to great music all night long, while surrounded by all your friends, 
dressed up all crazy, and feel like more than just being at a party, 
but feel like YOU ARE A PART OF THE PARTY.  Your spirit, and positive 
attitude are the key ingredients that are going to make this such a 
memorable Halloween Rave.  Hope to see you there.

For all information call:   415-915-1704   or    510-340-9401

PS:   Despite the fact that this event is being produced by Feel Good 
Entertainmnet, It is in no way a 'MASSIVE' along the scale of 
Megga-Buzz OnE, or Cool World, Or FTT or.......Etc.   There were hardly 
any flyers made for this event, and almost all the promotion is word of 
mouth.  We especialy would like to invite all of You who postulated 
that all our events are comercial and over-hyped, to please come out 
and eat your words.  
Feel Good E. has been throwing parties far longer than most of you have 
been going out.  If anybody knows how to throw an underground Halloween 
Rave, Well, Its probably Us.  For those of you who have never heard of 
a small underground thrown by us, well, its probably because the party 
is to underground for you, or you havn't been around long enough.  
This is your chance to check it out.

I guess the free water they were talking about on the flyers was the stuff
that you left in the trunk of your car because    you didn't think they would
let bottles into a massive.

why is it that you guys are so willing to write goopy we love you, respect
your vibe etc. to this list after your party but have completely ignored
the concerns of the people that you supposedly care about regarding the
water issue? Maybe you are still working on your reply to address this
issue? It seems like a major lack of respect and in return you lose
mine.

 What!?!? They didn't even have a water fountain!! Actually if there is 
running water in the bathrooms I don't mind SO much buying a bottle and 
then refilling it at a tap. But then Oakland and SF tap water tastes so 
much better than Santa Cruz water.

peace y'all,

I know you exist. I was told you exist before I got to UCSC. SO where are 
you?  and where are the events? Do I really have to go all the way to SF 
to do anything? Can I have suggestions,  to what is going on in SF.

Folks,

I was rummaging through some of my house-tapes and found "Share"
by Garth. I can't get over how good that tape is, and I need to
find one of the songs on side A. It's the one that samples 
Kraftwerk's "Pocket Calculator". Anyone know what song I'm talking
about, and where I could get it? Or is it simply the ORIGINAL
Kraftwerk-track tweaked into the mix by Garth? =)

reespect, jonas

P.S. Come to think of it, if anyone has a COMPLETE tracklisting
for this tape, please DO send it to me! =)

They had port 0 potties... Water for $2, and not place to refill it. SUCKS DON'T IT?!?


Shieeett.. I wish there were 7-11's at all raves.. Slurpees, coke, nachos, water.. all 
for under 5 bux.. That'd be pretty cool...

i've attended maybe 8 MADs, and this one was particularly great for me...
mainly because there were a lot of sfravers/people i knew there (more than
usual), including a few who i had just met saturday night... and also
because THE MUSIC _ROCKED_.

Sho,

thanks for your very informative descriptions/label refs on different types
of music...

i'd love it if others who are knowledgable would extend this list to
include other genres/subgenres (goa, different types of house, ambient in
its various forms, trip-hop, breakbeats)... i've pretty much got the
different genres sorted out but it's always nice to hear how people
describe them, and to have some references so that i'm not totally clueless
when i walk into a record store...

love,

brian

That's actually not hard to do. You just have to get something like those
food wagens you see and lunch time in parking lots or at street corners,
the RV sorta looking things. You need good people that won't jack up the
prices also. I've seen mobile taco bells when I worked at Moffett Field in
Mt. View. There also are Burgr King  and KFC ones. Why can't there be a
7-11 type. If I'm not mistaken, at Freedom 96 there was some kind of
trailer that had food and drinks. A little pricey, but it was cool. Hell,
I'd offer and have offered to bring my BBQ to whoever wants to use it. That
offer always stands, however I'm not going to sit over it like I do at BBQ
& BEATS.

So, if anyone wants to use it for a party, just ask.  I think by also
having that BBQ at a "rave" there would be a better chance of passing the
party off as something other then a "rave". But of course the party would
have to have an outside area or something.

	With Williams Buroughs selling Nikes
	And Speed junkies selling Jeans, it seems to me that
	someone is pushing the notion that the cultures that form
	around these drugs are kool. I don't own a television so in certain
	ways I'm not influenced by the medium but I also miss out on whole
	cultural memes that float through culture (especially "youth :) culture"
	So TV for me is like a drug, when I go to a friends house, I usually 
	become transfixed for a while. So maybe my perceptions are way off
	base but if they aren't then I would ask the question,  why should we
	not push "Rave" or the more prepackaged anacronym P.L.U.R.?  It seem's
	that as far as selling jeans or sneakers, I'd rather have my baby sister think 
	that Tim Leary was kool as opposed to William Bouroughs. Now, don't get me 
	wrong, I'm not saying that Nike and Calvin Klein or whomever shouldn't run these
	ads, but I am wondering why all the PLUR spouting people (if that's your thing) aren't
	spouting it to Madison Avenue.   The bottom line is I'd rather see younger people
	who are coming up and looking for identification to identify with the cultural values
	of the "Rave" scene as opposed to the  "Junkie" scene.


	Questions?

	Flames?

  Yeah exactly Rice-a-Roni;). One thing that F&F has prided   
ourselves on is
that we are *not* another one of those $20-$30 parties. If we got to big;
I would be afraid that we would lose that whole family vibe that we hold
 so precious=).

Yes.  Go to radio shack or some equivalent, and get a cord with a stereo
headphone jack on one side that splits into two RCA jacks on the other.
Plug the headphone jack into your disk man and the RCA's into your mixer.
There ya go.

essential. Let me have silence so that no pin may drop and not be

needle scratching upon this gramophone of the circular cosmic spot.
Hear me, mark me, learn me, throw the mind's ear open. Shut up the
mind's eye, all will be music. What sculpture of sound cannot, what
cannot as a fluid token words, that nothing else cannot."

"Let me have silence always in the centre of the shouting, that is
essential. Let me have silence so that no pin may drop and not be
heard, and not a whisper. Escape us for all our spouting, nor the
needle scratching upon this gramophone of the circular cosmic spot.
Hear me, mark me, learn me, throw the mind's ear open. Shut up the
mind's eye, all will be music. What sculpture of sound cannot, what
cannot as a fluid token words, that nothing else cannot."

I don't know... have you seen the ad for Gap's new fragerance, "Om"?
(which you can purchase in about 25 different varieties of perfume,
after-shave, shampoo, candles, incense, body lotion, deoderant ect.)

The marketing picture for that I see all over the place is a group of
young kids lounging on a couch looking pretty Eed out.  Plus, the
word "Om" instantly evokes images of tranquility and new-age-conciousness...
or something.

Granted, Calvin Cline ads still look like the opening shots to a low-budget
kiddy porn spread... whose models are doing such a thing to pay for their
smack/meth habbit.  But hey, it sells underwear and t-shirts, becuase every
time you see the big C and the little K you subliminally think of trashy
young people who are easy to have sex with.  Thats the whole marketing
hook of CK... associate CK with cheap sex in any way possible.

Where as Gap is looking more for a more cool, concious model of youth
to assoicate with its bright orange "Om" products.

"Ommmmmmmmmmmmmmm.....mmmmmmmmmmoney"

Personally, I want to be just like the clean-cut models in JCPenny ads :)

Because it has all been done before, 30 someodd years ago, though in a
slightly different flavor. It went from being a movement to a prepackaged
mass-marketed trend.

     Think about it... Burrough's work stands alone without an 
     understanding of his personality or his drug use.  I think fewer of 
     Timothy Leary's actions would fit in that category.  I appreciate the 
     contribution of both of these men, and I'm not sure I appreciate 
     Burroughs (author of Naked Lunch and Junkie, which opened up 
     literature to a new kind of storytelling) being compared unfavorably 
     to Timothy Leary (the Guy Who Brought LSD to American Pop Culture).
     
     I'm not sure I appreciate Leary claiming ownership or "invention" (as 
     he did in his last spoken word tour) of the Zippie and Rave cultures 
     either (not that he didn't have a significant influence, but modesty 
     baby, you were not the only one).  I'm not even sure I appreciate 
     being part of a identifiable culture.  I'll shut up.
     
     Besides... it would be difficult to get Timothy Leary to say anything 
     he hasn't already said... rest in peace ... respect.

[ to sfraves list ]

For aspiring/active musicians -

 I was web surfing, and found a US dealer for the Syntecno T303
( known as the TeeBee 303 outside of the US ).

REUSE IT MUSIC
2 Roosevelt Ave.
   Suite 123cM
Mystic, CT 06355       1-860-536-9400 

http://www.reuseit.com/n_keybds.htm   http://www.reuseit.com/orders.htm
sales@reuseit.com  

$599.95 for a Syntecno T303 ( aka TeeBee 303 )

That's  all I know - call them for more details. 


For info about the product itself, there's Syntecno's web page:

http://www.xs4all.nl/~syntecno/     syntecno@dds.nl 

Last I heard, "Price for 1 TeeBee : FL 780,- ( Dutch Guilders )  
                                            (approx. US$ 470,-)"

 - plus customs ( no power supply , but price includes postage & handling )

 Note: A new model has just come out with analog input that mixes with
       the local oscillators or can be just the analog input alone, before
       the filter and voltage controlled amp.

 Larry Ching / larryc@netcom.com

PS - No, I don't own one, but I thought folks here might be interested.
I got some techncal info about the new model that just came out, and 
ordering info from Syntecno via email, and I can forward that to anyone 
who's interested.

came home yesterday to find a message from Martin on my machine
about someone finding a red backpack. called the guy back today and it
turns out it wasn't my old Trager after all but I go , "oh well, thanks
for the call anyway and good luck on your parties." and Martin goes,
"thanks, if you want you can be on the guest list for the Basics on Nov.
16" and I go, "you don't *have* to do that." and he goes, "I know I don't
*have* to do it, but your on it." so at least that part of the story
eventually had a happy ending.

The water thing was a bummer.  B&B's don't have running water as 
bathrooms.  And $2.00 is pricey forthe tiny bottle they sold.  $1.00 
should buy a liter...At least up here where water is plentiful!  :)  but 
then there's no need to sell water up here in Humboldt...it rains so much!

=)

Seriously--
False advertising IS wrong and that issue should be addressed.

I really wasn't upset about the free water thingie.  
Pretty much figured that they meant tap water..
  I figured that when they said free water, they meant thoughs little
coolers full of yellow tap water & free dixy cups. This is what I usually
see when there is a free water ravE anyways.

I wouldn't be surprized if the tap water looked all messed up n muddy after
the rain came down.

 Thats prolly why they didn't have the free tap water.
I planned on buying the gysers before I showed up.
I would rather drink water from a sealed bottol.

Hey all,

well, all good things come to an end and so does my stay in San Francisco.
We've been here for a year and it has been a wild ride (much wilder then
I anticipated when I left home). I just want to say a few things before
signing off.

There has been a lot of discussion about the (NRR) contents of the list
and its usefulness. Let me say this, I am still very impressed by it.
I came to SF as a total stranger and I have met so many great people
through the list, found out about the places to be, exchanged (weird) ideas
or just had fun. This is a very powerful medium, even if it is chaotic
or consumed by flamewars every now and then. You people are the best.

On raving in San Francisco, especially with all the controversy recently
about "massives" vs. "undeground" raves. In my opinion you should all be
very happy with what you have right now, a very much alive scene with
something (of quality!) for everybody. And I say this coming from a country
where house has become mainstream and infiltrated big time by the greedy and
clueless. The kind of parties you have here, almost every day of the week
and several to choose from in the weekends are nowadays hard to find back
home and I will miss them. Lots of what I've seen here reminded me of the
scene in the Netherlands, say, 4-5 years ago. Appreciate it while you have
it, free water may be the least of your worries.

So, the Frying Dutchman will become the Flying Dutchman next week wednesday.
I thank you all. I hope to be online again within a few months from now and
perhaps I'll drop by here once in a while.

And for those 2001 lovers (check out http://www.design.no/2001/ lots
of great soundfiles and pictures for the true geek!!)... the HAL 9000
signing off...

Dave...my mind is going...I can feel it...I'm afraid, Dave...Daisy, Daisy..."

Goodbye,

The Frying Dutchman

Subject: Water at Homebase

I along with many others made sure all the thirsty ravers got water at
Homebase for the Last Gathering and Organic and a few other parties....There
is one fawcett where one can get drinkable water. We had to fill up 5 gallon
water jugs the whole night, so we could fill cups, bottles, etc... there is
no water fountain or any bathrooms to fill up bottles and such... If people
where allowed to fill up from the ONE spigot then it would be pandimonium,
not to mention the fact that there would be a flood... there was when I was
filling up the containers... So that is the water situation at homebase and I
hope that this explains it...
though this does not have anything to do with the fact that FTT said there
would be free water... But I don't know about the situation. I was at home
praying to the toilet, sick with the flu!!!!:(

        Actually, at Freedom, the trailer is a trailer that's always there.
It's used to cater to flat track, MX's, and quarter mile races on the
weekends and weeknights. It's been there for years, (and so have those
bathrooms in that wooden shack that are a shining example of hell).

        I've been racing at Sandhill for years, but the owner Tom Anderson
was an alcoholic dick who always tried to get more money while cutting
corners on designs and track quality. Now he mines most of the place. No one
in there right mind would ride there. He lives in that house to the right of
the entrance. 

        Also, my old High School, had Taco Bell carts n all. An Ice cream
cart would be heaven. . . 



Just some non-needed info
but then, I'm full of it

Hi all!  =)

 First; my heartfelt apologies for spamming the list! I have folks to 
help me for the Tigger party [A Wrinkle In Time] but no one for the 
upcoming Mantra opening. So I'm reposting that request for help.

DJ's are (in no particular order);	Dutch
					Anna
					Theta Blip
					Moonpup
					Neil
and I may be forgetting someone {sorry}

 And of course Dionysus Dreams will be providing lighting and visuals.
If anyone wants to join the fun, you can write me here or call 408.427.1666.

 We are talking full on psychedelic trance.




 Mantra:

 I need to get to SF early on Friday Nov. 1st (4 pm or so). Once I'm 
there with my equipment the driver is free to go. Will want to leave 
SF about 9 or 10 am the next day. I can swing with a different driver 
going back, however the vehicle needs to be a medium sized pickup (or 
van) or bigger, both ways. Will pay for gas and you get in free (free chai 
afterparty!!) In addition I would like to have at least one to three 
volunteer workers who likewise get in for free. You only need to commit 
to either set up OR tear down. Obviously set up will be as close to 4 pm 
Friday as possible. We should be done in plenty of time to relax, eat 
dinner and clean up before the party.


 Additional note; I live in Santa Cruz and give prefrence (of crew 
choice) to those who have worked with me before (for various reasons) 
and those who contact me first.


 On transportation; I will consider smaller vehicles if we have enough to 
get all the equipment moved (caravan style). Hatchbacks work well.

 Again sorry for spamming the list with my needs and my appreciation to 
those tempted to flame me but havn't! ;)


peas y'alls,


Ran

I'd describe the music I play as techno. I know that the
word has become a bit diluted over the years, but it's the
best word to describe the kind of music I like, and it's a
term which encompasses most of what all four Mad residents
play. 

I'm really excited that people seem to be more and more
interested in the music, and I encourage you guys to go out
and buy CDs, and find out more about the musicians.

BTW, thanks for your post.

First off, Im sorry for taking up bandwith for this trifling but...

I have a good friend and kick ass web desinger that has had current
employment with a computer retailer (approx. 3yrs.) in regards to web
design and  tilizes Director, Pagemill and a few other applications...

Anyways, he moved up to the City  and is currently looking to land a job
somewhere fitting his passion in web design.  Seeing that this is the
coolest list in California I thoght I'd do him a favor in seeing if any
of you cyber-corperates (such as myself) or up and comer busnesses would
need his services please drop me a line.

P.S. He's not a raver  (so he won't be spun on Mondays) But he hits the
club circut and likes techno and has a degree of coolness /
professonalism.

Thanks in advance.

Hello everyone!

        Well, I just walked in from a very llloooonnnngggg trip to L.A. It
was fun, but not too productive. I got some really good pounding trance
music though! (Can't find that up here in S.J. that often) 

        So I am really stuned at the outcome of FnF! I thought that party
was never gonna get busted. Everyone put so much energy into the party, it
felt so good, but in the end I guess $ talks... Well, this just means the
next one is gonna go off even harder!!! I can't wait! I went to the redwood
city space, but found myself cold then hot, then cold then hot, and most of
all tired! So I went home and had a few hours of sleep. I am glad that the
party went off in such a great way!

        Anyways, I think I am going to lay low this weekend, I am really
tired. But next weekend is gonna be great! I am going to be spinning at the
Gateway party, Nov, 9th. It's gonna be great, so I will see all of you
there!?!?!?

Peace,

Greg =)
Peace, love and harmony to all!!!

Greg =)

 Maybee your perception is not off at all but you are able to look 
at the spectacle more critically, i dont have a TV and the same thing 
happens to me when I watch it.  But I am also totally apalled at what is 
considered entertainment and the  stereotypical portrayals of people and 
cultures in this medium(the most damaging of which is in the "news"), 
just ask someone what they think of say the Middle East, they probably 
have a strong opppinion formed but did someone help them form that 
oppinion?(CNN)  I simply dont understand it and in a way I am glad.

       Me too..it would also be nice if young people could identify with 
Leary(in some ways) rather than Rambo, Terminator and Steven Segal..but 
who is shoved in your face everytime you see a TV add or ride a bus open

BA, I'll be the first to absolutely agree with you, in fact I've been saying 
something similar all along to friends of mine when the subject comes up, 
but I'd like to ask some questions: 

1. Would you say that the movement, albeit eventually prepackaged and 
mass-marketed, changed society for the good?  That elements of that movement 
still swirl through the miasma of our culture even today?

2. If yes to #1, then would you say that "pushing 'Rave' or the more 
prepackaged anacronym [sic] P.L.U.R." would validate certain elements of 
that original movement and even further them?

While some will slam me for the reference to PLUR, which they see as a 
mindless and constrictive dogma, the sentiment behind PLUR is a good one 
IMHO and could stand to be publicized...

(Ooooo... I'm going to get smacked for this post...)

Uh, I pressed the big -D- button because I didn't think I would be able 
to get down to SF when I read about the Tigger party but I think I may 
have met someone in the lonely Arcata area who may want to make the 
journey down to a big phat small party. 
does any one have the four one one?
e-mail me pretty pleeaase?

     F8 is on Upper Haight almost right across the street from Pack-a-Bowl 
     location, about a block away from the park. I know that there's 80 
     beds on a first come first served basis and then camping for whoever 
     wants to camp - the ticket includes the cabin price.

Hi ya'll,

The phone for that SPIRIT Holloween party this Thursday is the "Buzz
Line" and it is sponsered by the "Global Party Network". Has anyone
been to a party by these guys? It's cheaper if you have your "Global
Party Network" card. (?) "Buzz Line" and "Global Party Network" sound
like big comercial radio station lingo to me.

Hey kids, just wanted to drop a note to say what a wonderfull time Lori
and I had down in SF.  This weekend was my second F&F party and it
completely surpassed all possible expectations.  I've never in my life
experienced such a concentrated vibe as we did in that little garage in
Redwood City.

I was nearly in tears when the cops busted up the first space.  So many of
my friends were there that I hadn't seen in a long time.  We tried to make
plans of meeting somewhere or heading to another party but everything was
just chaos.  As we were heading to the car we noticed that it was
approaching 1am (we had previously planned a cosmic love vibe connection
between us and our family in Seattle and Portland for 1am ;) so Lori threw
some tunes on in the car and we had ourselves a little mini-rave out in
the parking lot ;)  There were 20 or so of us out there gvooving away when
there came the rumors about a new space.  A half hour later we found
ourselves caravaning down to Redwood City not knowing what to expect. 

Once we got there though we knew we were home.  Wow, I can't even begin to
tell you all how good it felt to be there.  Everyone milling about with 
huge grins on there faces, hugging each other and making new friends.  And
then the sound system went on...

I haven't danced that hard and felt so connected to a group of people in
my entire life!!  There was so much love in the room!!  I want to thank
all of you who made that experience happen - each and every one of you are
beautifull beyond description!!  I look forward to seeing you all again.

And to those of you who got shut out or didn't find out about the new
space, I don't know what to say other than we will make this happen again.

Much Love,
Arlyn

A few weeks ago at the corner of 1st & Mission in the city, they had

Or just as good:
coming off of the Mission/Duboce exit on US101 in SF...
underneath "Just Be", someone had spraypainted "SKINNY"

the perfect statement to remind you to stop envying the heroin-chic
models that sneered at you each time you finished your evening commute...

Not as authentic, but certainly got a sinister chuckle out of me.

     2 cents on this thread...
     
     Raves look to me like a cross between the flappers of the 20's and the 
     hippies of the sixties.  The flappers seemed a little less 'hardcore' 
     and ended up having a longer impression because there was less 
     backlash... in fact, the harmless nature of the flappers resulted in a 
     public opinion that hippies were harmless at first which bought the 
     hippie culture time to unify USING the media as an aid.  Only when the 
     dangers of drug use, and the incredible stupid motto of "Don't trust 
     anyone over thirty", flag burning and other poorly selected slogans 
     started to enrage the majority of the country did they fuck up.  
     Hippies lost sight of the goal and got wrapped up in the methods.  At 
     best they are remembered as the nuts who drove the magic bus in the 
     summer of love, at worst, they are blamed for the decline of society.  
     In the grand assessment, hippies and hippie culture DID do a lot of 
     damage and we shouldn't look at the OD's, deaths and conflict of the 
     time through rose colored glasses.  We should benefit from their 
     lessons: Misfit power, alternative community, the power of art, music 
     and media, and a stronger emphasis on peace in our decisions.
     
     America isn't ready for the responsibility of a higher social, ethical 
     and life order.  We need to expand the sense of possibilities first.  
     That's where raving fits in.  If I could address a large group of 
     people that had all the same dream some hot summer night in a 
     warehouse years ago, I could make them feel something.  Too bad that 
     group is a minority of the population.
     
     Currently the only bond we share as a country is what flies out of a 
     box in the corner of our rooms, which may I add is a known emitter of 
     numerous types of radiation.
     
     As a "raver", I choose my own path and recommend everybody involved do 
     the same, in their OWN way.  If we are faceless, and nameless, and 
     agenda-less, we are not a target.
     
     We don't ALL do drugs.
     
     We don't ALL dance.
     
     We don't ALL go all the time.
     
     We don't ALL care about the same things.
     
     We're not all in the same political party (has anybody found one that 
     represents ALL their beliefs... or even most of their goals or ethics)
     
     Several years into this, we can see what works and what doesn't.  I 
     can say from my own experience that I have benefited greatly and 
     become a lot more open to questioning myself, without doubting my past 
     self.  I am prone to growth, regardless of whether I think the time is 
     right.  I try to enjoy the harvest of happenstance.  I like life more, 
     and I don't have to go to another party to benefit.
     
     I don't think we can get much done right now, except spread acceptance 
     to ideas, and a general sense that one person or group shouldn't 
     dictate the morals of an entire country.  As we age, we will watch our 
     children grow up.  We are the prototypes for their genius and power 
     and direction.  We need to make sure we hold the feeling that this is 
     possible deep in our hearts.  We need to stay focused.  The art of 
     storytelling is dying.  When we can't explain things to our children, 
     we leave it to someone else. 
     
     Teach your children well.
     
     and about publicizing anything... FUCK COMMERCIAL TV.
     You don't realize how sad it is till you walk away.

     waking up on a chill room floor still feeling buzzed... it's talking 
     to some of the nicest people I've ever met... it's watching somebody 
     freak out and dance like nothing I've ever seen... it's about going 
     back to your car in a blissful afterglow and finding it keyed... it's 
     about seeing a familiar face and not even trying to figure out their 
     name, but rather what rave you met them at... it's staying a couple 
     more minutes at a party because your friend/ride wants to when the DJ 
     just starts to go off, and then I'm the one who doesn't want to 
     leave... it's about being bored this weekend and having to choose 
     between two killer parties next... it's getting caught by your 
     roomates or parents dancing in your room with a big shit eating 
     grin... it's having somebody you looked at and already made up your 
     mind on approach you and prove you wrong with a smile and a hello... 
     it's about driving god knows where because the directions are a little 
     off... it's about uncertainty and surprise and happenstance and 
     synchronicity.
     
     It's about us doing it to ourselves, rather than them doing it for us.

        Hey all you friendly ravers. . . just in case a bunch of everyone is
going tomorrow, here's my description of ME: I'll have blue jeans, a white
shirt with glow in the dark crap on it, a black adiddas windbreaker, and a
mask which kinda looks like the joker, but not really, it has green hair, a
serious overbite, and pale white skin. That'll be me, so come up and give me
a hug or shake my hand or somethin and introduce yerself. Hopefully I'll
have some friends of mine to introduce you to too.

        ALSO!!!! If anyone can give me the directions to the location it
will greatly de-stress my life. I have to rush after classes and get
everybody together so it'd help if I didn't have to do all that stuff.

THANKS BUNCHES

Aryck

     It's actually better to have water treated right at the source, that 
     way there can be no bacteria growing.  Get a good water treatment 
     device, and I DON'T mean brita.  :(

 David Bowie once said "Life's not a contest, you know--you don't get 
any medals at the end."  I agree wholeheartedly with that statement,and 
I hate to get hierarchical but WOW--this post is the coolest one I've
ever read on sfraves! :)  I vote it's one for the archives...

Many thanks to everybody who put on and came to FnF and FnF, part II. My 
trip in from Chicago for my anniversary FnF was so worthwhile because of 
YOU.

I had been to a few raves before last year's Halloween FnF. But something 
was very different for me that night and my follow-up email to everybody 
I met at that party was "Now I understand."

I guess I can say, "Now I truly understand." Last year wasn't just a 
freak one-time occasion. Warmth, compassion, and kindness do exist.

What I don't understand are the people who have trouble with the idea 
behind this small party. Elitism? I didn't see any; I met all kinds of 
people. One simply has to introduce themselves. A party and your 
perception of it are what you make of it. Show some warmth, compassion, 
and kindness, and people will reciprocate.

Sunny-
Tell me a little about Harvey.  Was he one of Wicked's originators?
And what happ'n'd to Thomas?  While some of the best parties I ever went
to were Wicked, they seemed to lose the vibe in the last 2 years or so,
you know, that explosive intense energy that would go on for hours, like
the roof was going to blow off the building.  So, should I go?

No. The fact that it was mass-marketed and packaged destroyed whatever
hope the movement had at changing anything significant. It went from being
a movement, which encompasses a collective conciousness moving towards
certain goals, to a trend, which is composed of a group of sheep
wearing the right clothes, saying the right things, and hanging out
with the 'in crowd', all which becomes passe' over time. 

Have people stopped killing one another? Have people stopped hating one
another, for whatever pathetic reasons they might have, be they racial,
religious, political, etc.? Are people (legally)free to do what they wish
their own bodies?

No. That is the mistake that has been made previously. You cannot "push." 
You can merely offer. How can you *force* peace? How can you *force* love?
How can you *force* unity? How can you *force* respect?

An overused simplification of an otherwise worthy ideal used as a selling

The real problem here gents and ladies with the, "youth" is that THEY have
been under constant attack.  Media, socially, and otherwise.  Hell, when I
go to war, it serves no purpose to think of Leary.  Better  Sun Tzu for the
job.

I can understand why kidz choose the icons they do.  Maybe society has done
a poor job of amplifying the contributions of others more deserving of such
admiration.  And maybe, just maybe, society has not produced enough good
examples to follow.  Yeah, they are there if you look, but in general they
are not readily accessible.  WHhereas "Junk" culture is easily availabe,
accessible, and created in mass quantities.

Paradigm shift needed.

People follow by example.  This goes for kidz too ;) <- (their future is in
our hands)!

Out,
John

Brilliant piece of social terrorism/deconstruction.  I saw it and got a

Ah, I'm so glad you said this; it touches on a pet peeve of mine.  In
brief, yes.  To say more, first it seems to me that the great majority of
personal attitudes toward "the sixties" today fall into three broad
categories: one, a basic indifference of a sort widely applied to history
and historical moments of all kinds, seeing the past like a museum exhibit
of various exemplary or characteristic concepts (hippies, MLK, rock music,
drugs, etc) without any particular continuity or relation to the present;
two, the mixture of nostalgia and commitment to various ideas or ideals of
the period that can manifest itself in both new and unreconstructed hippies
and activists; three, the disdain and self-congratulatory "realism" that
replies to the perceived failure of anyone to achieve the many stated goals
of those pressing for change in the period: there was no revolution, we
have no world peace, racism lives, and so on.  Each of these views strikes
me as amazingly shallow.  I don't want to wander too far, but to quickly
summarize my feelings, "the sixties" (a grossly artificial category) were
an upwelling of ideas and actions that need to be considered as a natural
historical result of what came before and, most importantly, as a cause of
what came after, of what we are living with.  Hippies, Yippies, Black
Panthers, SDS may not have succeeded in creating the societies they claimed
as their results, but did they simply dissipate, with no effect?  No.  The
world we live in today unquestionably bears their marks, in the form of
every stride toward personal equality, moral freedom, democratic
participation, and individual liberty taken since, and probably most of the
strides taken in the other direction as well.

There was a great example of all this recently.  There was a piece, in the
SF Weekly I believe (maybe the Guardian), about the memorial for Timothy
Leary in San Francisco, a month or two after his death.  It appeared under
the headline "Fucking Hippies."  It's an epithet we've all heard, I expect,
usually with a combination of both derision and respect, the first for the
supposed failure of all that hippies have stood for, the second for their
willingness to commit to an admittedly admirable set of goals.  The report
reflected the title, with a fair bit of jibing at hippie idealism and
nostalgic reminiscence mixed with with real respect for the ideas that
Leary and followers had managed to put forth, and their results.  It was
basically positive, though definitely not lacking in mockery.  On the
mocking side, particular mention was made of the spectacle of Joe
MacDonald, of Country Joe and the Fish, leading the crowd in his famous
Woodstock war chant ("whoopee, we're all gonna die...").  A few weeks
later, a letter appeared in the Weekly (Guardian?) from Mr MacDonald.  It
combined (as I read it) a somewhat sardonic acknowledgment of the truths in
the piece with a comment to the effect that it was pleasant to observe that
a public paper could unconcernedly make use of the word "fuck," which in
the day of his and Leary's prominence was cause for investigation by the
FBI.  Exaggeration, possibly, but I doubt it.  In any case, it demonstrates
real changes that have occurred since the sixties.  Would they have arrived
without the activists, hippies, druggies, panthers, rockers, and so on?  I
don't think so.

The moral, if any, of all this is basically that idealism should never be
shunned.  People today tend to look at the sixties as a collection of
idealisms, either failed or still to be treasured, revered and immemorial.
But the lesson of the past ought really to be that ideals are indispensable
to change, though they might never be realized: ideals are the raw material
of history, producing through all their perversions and distortions the
growth and development of the human race.

Could.  (Anacronym...I like that.)

     Yeah, there isn't much in s.c., but there is a one-off party this 
Friday with markie, garth, dubtribe, tracy, tom, chris, moonpup, polywog, 
keone, jay hartley, plus there is a weekly on Tuesday nights (done by 
the same people)  info # 408-425-3316
     There will be a new weekly opening up approx Nov 21, and will be 
every Thursday. Keep an eye out for this one and call 408-429-2330 in a few 
weeks to get the D.J. line-up
     Other than that, there are the occasional beach party (most of 
which are on winter vacation till next spring...)

Hey, looking for something to do this Halloween night? Then hang out
with me and Sarah! Here's the plan: a bunch of people (meaning YOU!)
come over our place... we all walk around... go to Castro... go to
Civic Center...  look at weird people... have fun... be silly...

Then, (optionally) crash over here in one of our luxurious fold out
sofas (or floor :). If you have nothing to do, and you're looking for
something NRR to do (come on! it's San Francisco... there's going to
be too much weirdness roaming the streets to spend Halloween at a
*rave*), then hang with us! :)

Either send private email or give me a call for directions (my phone
number's in my .sig)...

Steve

ps. oh yeah, Sarah wanted me to tell you all that it's gonna be *phat* ;)

Hi Everybody-

 After talking to a couple of my friends on the list I have decided to let 
everybody in on something I've worked hard on.  I've never felt comfortable 
with promoting myself, but here I go.
 I've put together a mix tape which I'm happy to say is available to others 
other than myself:).  The tape is called Repetitive Excursions, and it is a mix 
of progressive house/trance.  It can be purchased at Groovesmith in downtown 
Palo Alto.  To find out where they are call (415) FAT-LINE.  
 Distribution of this tape will be limited to this record store because I'm 
heading out of town on business in Detroit for the next ten weeks.  If there 
are any suggestions for events/record stores/etc in regards to Detroit, please 
let me know.  Thanks to everybody on the list who gave me a kick in the pants 
to get a tape out.

TODD WHERE ARE YOU?!
Anyone see "Until the end of the world" Killer futurist movie.  They had this
way over designed P.I. software package with a big russsian bear that would
bounce around looking under rocks, cars etc. saying "searching...
searching..." and then blamo, it would find exactly the person you were
looking for, and tell you precisely where in the world they were located.

...I can't seem to find a free download of that baby.

[this note has a cynical section and a constructive section. if you don't
want to hear me bitch about why mass media exposure won't work, please skip
to the second half of this post :) ]

do i think that Peace, Love, Unity and Respect are values to live by?

absolutely.

do i think we (whoever "we" are) should try to "push" these values through
the mainstream media?

no way.

first of all, the mainstream media does not believe in peace, love, unity,
or respect. they are experts in subverting, twisting, suppressing, and,
finally, "commercializing" and taking over such messages and using them to
their own advantage.

secondly, there is not enough Unity among us to begin with. we have all
sorts of different values, beliefs, etc. we bicker over these things all
the time. right now we can't agree on this very question. trying to access
the mass media would fragment us further.

third, PLUR and raving mean different things to all of us. i have seen far
too many un-PLUR posts on this list (and this list is one of the most
PLURry groups of people i've ever encountered.) to some people, raving is
an escape from "real life." to others, raving _is_ real life, and the rest
is just a recurring nightmare. other people think that raving is "the way
things ought to be", and want to try to integrate the rave and non-rave
worlds. many of us would like to live PLUR as everyday philosophy, but we
find the stresses of everyday life too much for us. i'm not denigrating
anyone for being "less-than-ideal", i'm just saying this:

if we could send a message to the world, what would it be? and would we be
up to the challenge of truly leading by example?

i don't think we could agree, and i don't think we are prepared to put
together any sort of unified example to lead by.

now, enough cynicism. i also hold some hope for these ideals.

LEADING BY EXAMPLE (take 2). we are individuals, the rest of the world is
made up of individuals. in our society, each individual gets a vote.

every time you introduce a newbie to the scene...
every time you smile at a stranger, or give someone directions on the street...
every time you give someone a much-needed hug...
every time you get someone to turn off their television...
every time you convince someone to register to vote...

you are promoting PLUR.

a story:

my roommate, Susan, was walking down Market St. the week after her first
rave (Beautiful People in September). a businessman walking near her
started to cross the street against a red, nearly getting hit by a taxi and
delaying some traffic. Susan asked him, don't you think if all the
pedestrians respected the cars and all the cars respected the pedestrians
(and eachother), the streets would be safer and less congested for both?
the businessman looked at her skeptically and said, but everyone's not
going to do that. Susan said, well it's gotta start with somebody, doesn't
it?

Susan watched the businessman as he approached the next intersection. he
waited until it was clear.

point: real change happens slowly, and it CAN happen _one person at a time_.

point: if you don't, who will?

point: the best way to spread PLUR is to _live it_ ourselves, every moment
of every day, not just when we're raving. until we all do that, talk of
reaching mass audiences is futile.

YOU are a beautiful person. YOU can bring out the beauty in other people.
if you don't, who will?

much love,

brian

I am right in thinking that the Halloween parade is going on tonight in
the Castro as it does every year; aren't I?  Last two times I went to
Halloween on the Castro it was on a weekend so I just wanted to make
sure that it was tonight rather then a weekend night.

        plur is life. but you don't need to preach it.  just think of your
favorite religious icon. i.e. j.c. (no offense, cuz i luv him), buddah (not
that plant stuff), mohammed and there are many others......or if you are
atheist just think of the spirit of what these people were trying to
promote.  i think you'll find that they were not trying to convert their
enemies, rather, they were trying to educate them.  this is overly
simplistic, but that's what makes it beautiful.  we are not the first
ravers and we won't be the last. what this means to me is that since we
have nothing to lose (which is what janis called freedom) why not promote
plur by living it?  it comes back to you tenfold....and your raves are more
fun too.....

I think part of the problem is that it's a "they" have been under
constant attack...It's a weird day when you chose to separate
yourself from youth culture...It's hard to say how old everybody is
on this list, but suffice to say, a lot of us are only 5 to 10 years
past being "youth"...by making it an "us" "them" thing it just
creates a deeper cleavage between understanding what's really going
on.  I mean, I'm 21 and I hope to consider myself a "youth" for the
rest of my life!

Tristan,
I'm not 100% certain, but I heard that this year there won't be a Castro St.
Holloween Party, that it might be down near the civic center ( or maybe
by the bay south of the ferry building.).  
I go to SFSU too.  What's your major?

apple juice in them. 

13 people have become ill, 1 in the bay area the rest in washington. (the
local 2 year old became ill approx. 2 weeks ago)

symptoms are similar to stomach flu.

        Yep, Feel Good Entertainment. They've done lots of BIG parties. I
don't really mind, as long as I get in and have a good time. They sometimes
run in conjunction with Cool World I think, or at least they did once.
It'll be ok. . . just go with a good attitude and an open mind. It won't be
too big because they didn't pass out too many flyers or anything.

TOP TEN REASONS WHY TRICK OR TREATING IS BETTER THAN SEX

10. You're guaranteed to get at least a little something in the sack.

9. If you get tired, you can wait ten minutes and go at it again.

8. The uglier you look, the easier it is to get some.

7. You don't have to compliment the person who gave you candy.

6. It's okay when the person you're with fantasizes you're someone else,
   because you ARE someone else.

5. 40 years from now, you'll still enjoy candy.

4. If you don't get what you want, you can always go next door.

3. It doesn't matter if the kids hear you moaning and groaning.

2. Less guilt the next morning.

 AND the #1 reason....

1. You can do the whole neighborhood!!

   Greetings to all,
       
               I was just reading a book on eastern religions the other day,
when I happened across this passage. Now I know to some this may be nothing
new, but for myself it was reaffirming of my views and brought JOY to my
heart. So I'll share it with you all, in hopes of bringing you a smile.

                                     The Yoga of Music
                                   **********************
           ~ The yoga of music is directly related to devotion. Devotion is
inner attachment, love. =>   Without this psycological and spiritual
attitude, music cannot lead to salvation. Music is not regarded in India as a
means of diversion and pleasure but as a path to God-realization and is
called Nada-brahma-yoga or the Yoga of the Brahman as sound. This Brahman is
regarded by the philosophers of grammar as the Word. Music enables man to get
merged in the peace and bliss of the spiritual aspect of sound. (..YES!!..)
 The sense of music, when developed, enables us, like moral sense,
intuitively to distinguish between harmony and disharmony, right and wrong,
to realize the discordance of the worlds with the ideal reality or existence,
and the havoc caused by anger, and so on, on our being.

       
         In harmony with love,
                                         Chris.

I was 10 in 1967 and though I was too young to go to Woodstock I remember
it clearly.
The "Hippie" movement was still kicking in 1971 when I took my first acid
in Central Park Manhatten.
I must say that the 60's and the associated counter-cultural movements have
had a clear,
profound and unmistakable effect on western culture (and thus the world).
Particularly in
silicon valley, you owe flex-time, no dress codes, no drug test (for most
large computer co.) to the
direct effect of "Computer Phreaks" (Hippies who programmed computers). 
The fact that even the
Pres can sday that he put the joint to his mouth (but did not inhale), and
the vice president went all the way
is a result of the memes exported by the 60's

Yes the media apparatus is completely self serving, this is well known, but
consider this that
the spin doctors of the 80s and 90s learned well from the tactics of the
Yippies from the 60s
and 70s. The Yippies sought to manipulate the media by feeding them a
poison pill, i.e. they knew
they would tend towards the sensational so they fed them stuff that was
sensational knowing that
the media would gobble up the sensational part and pull the sub-textual
message along with it.
This is what a meme is. The real goal is to bring the sub-textual message
through.

Hi Guys,
Sorry I didn't get back earlier with the water fiasco. I was out of town on 
business. As everyone has pointed out, free water was going to be available at 
the party, and free water (55 tanks in all) were ordered from Alhambra. 
However, due to a mix-up, the delivery people from Alhambra came to the wrong 
gate that Saturday evening and left. By the time we found out, it was too 
late. 
Yes, water was sold at the party, but ALL the beverages sold that night were 
NOT from FTT. We did NOT make ANY money from the sale of beverages. Our deal 
with the owners of the space was that we could rent it on condition they 
handle and get to keep all proceeds from the beverages. We did however get 
permission to distribute a certain amount of free water until it ran out. 
I realize that this explanation will not satisfy everyone on the list, but its 
the truth. We had no control over the price that was charged for the water at 
the event, and we did not in anyway get a percentage of the profits. FTT 
apologizes for the misleading information on the flyer.  We are going to throw 
a free Organic in the Park soon with some very special guests (hopefully) 
playing live. 
Also, watch out for the Funky Tekno Tribe crew tonite at the Civic Center.... 
we'll be in drag ;) Happy Halloween!!!

Subj:  Rich Contribute To Pot Measure
Date:  Wed, Oct 30, 1996 7:51 PM CST


.c The Associated Press

      SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- George Soros and Laurance Rockefeller
are among the rich and famous who have contributed $1.4 million to
support a ballot measure to legalize marijuana for medical use in
California.
      With their help, supporters of Proposition 215 began airing TV
commercials over the weekend -- something the opposition couldn't
afford.
      Campaign spending reports ending Oct. 19 show that the wealthy
donors' contributions account for roughly three-quarters of the
$1.8 million raised. Opponents have raised $28,128 against the
measure, mostly from law-enforcement groups.
      Proposition 215 would allow Californians to grow and use
marijuana for medical purposes for cancer, AIDS and other ailments
if recommended by a physician.
      Soros, a billionaire currency trader living in New York, donated
$550,000. He advocates ``legalizing some of the less harmful drugs
and devoting the money saved from the criminal justice system to
treatment'' in his book ``Soros on Soros.''
      Rockefeller, brother of former Vice President Nelson
Rockefeller, donated $50,000 after a request from New Age guru Ram
Dass, aka professor Richard Alpert, who was exiled with Timothy
Leary from Harvard in 1963 after using students in psychedelic drug
experiments.
      George Zimmer, owner of the Fremont-based Men's Wearhouse
clothing store chain, donated $50,000 and loaned the Yes campaign
$210,000. Zimmer, whose mother died of cancer, said he had wanted
to give it to her to ease the pain of chemotherapy.
      Other donors include:
      Chicago commodities broker Richard Dennis, one of the nation's
leading advocates of legalizing drugs as a way to reduce crime and
save tax money, donated $100,000.
      John Sperling, president of the University of Phoenix, donated
$200,000.
      Peter Lewis, president of the Progressive Corp., the nation's
seventh-largest auto insurance company, donated $500,000.
      Other prominent donors include Gail Zappa, widow of rock
musician Frank Zappa, with $5,000; former Reagan administration
Secretary of State George Shultz, 1,000; Nobel-laureate economist
Milton Friedman, $150; and former California Sen. Alan Cranston,
$100.

"Hugging can be vital for your emotional well-being. Everybody

feels skin hunger throughout their lives, and unless that hunger

is satisfied by touching, there's a vital void in the emotional

make-up that's going to cause deep unhappiness. We all know that

babies thrive on frequent stroking. Well, adults are no

different. When they are not patted on the hand, embraced around

the shoulder or hugged, they withdraw into themselves. I

prescribe four hugs a day for survival, eight for maintenance and

twelve for growth. Dr. Virginai Satir in Homemade, March, 1990

Hugs are not only nice; ther're needed. Hugs can relieve pain and

depression, make the healthy healthier, the happy happier and the

most secure among us even more so. Hugging feels good, overcomes

fear, eases tension, provides stretching exercise if you're short

and stooping exercise if you're tall. Hugging does not upset the

environment, saves heat and requires no special equipment. It

makes happy days happier and impossible days possible."

	Hello fellow slug raver =)


	Actually, it is hard to find good raves here in S.C.
	Last year we had so much trouble we just put our own rave
	on on campus (ORACLE).  
				  However, most of the raves in S.C.
	take place @ the Civic Auditorium...like FREAKERS BALL tomorrow
	night.  
	         Also, there is The Deep every THUR. @ Palookaville...
	some new people just took it over (they are actually UCSC students
	and they are gonna make the place better -->  DJ DAN, Graeme, Tony...)

	
	So what college are you @?

Thanks much for the clarification, and sorry for starting the bitch chain. I
was just kinda put off because a litle piece of info like that can change how
you plan your evening (i.e.what to bring).  I must say that if a lack of free
water is the best thing I can come up with to bitch about, you musta done
something right!

============================================================================

i think the best things in life are always made hard to find unless you are 
truly looking for them.  I think these things are best left in the 
underground, but not chaotic like some people would like.  Good parties like 
Sunset would get out of hand if 5.5 million people in the Bay Area suddenly 
knew about it.  We wouldn't get fair coverage.  See my next note about this.

============================================================================
     
do i think that Peace, Love, Unity and Respect are values to live by?
     
absolutely.
     
do i think we (whoever "we" are) should try to "push" these values through 
the mainstream media?
     
no way.
=============================================================================

I would have to agree that the media, with a few exceptions, doesn't cover 
topics fairly.  They cover topics based on what they think the people want to 
see to be entertained.  A great example of this was the hard copy coverage of 
raves.  clearly they were simply trying to find only the negative aspects and 
front them to the American people so they may mainline it into their brains.  

Another experience I have had with inaccurate media coverage is a bit NRR, 
however it seems appropriate to bring up in this instance.  About 4-5 months 
ago, 20/20 did a story on Equinox International, an environmentally conscious 
company which markets over 300 environmentally sound products to consumers 
either directly or through catalog sales.  Perhaps some of you out there may 
have seen this show or heard of the company before.  I just found out today that
Equinox has listed #1 as the fastest growing company in the either inc or 
fortune 500.  

Fortunately, since I know people in the company and was able to hear the story 
before the story even happened, I can give sort of an inside story.  

About 5 weeks before 20/20 aired this fairly negative story interviewing 12 
people who were accusing Equinox and its founder, Bill Gouldd, of dishonest 
business practices.  

Now I don't want to go into too many of the details because they are not 
pertinent to our subject of the media, but the 20/20 people ONLY interviewed the
12 people (out of a company with over 300,000 representatives) and based their 
entire story on that.  They gave Mr. Gouldd 4 hours to respond.  Also, Equinox 
sent out some other representatives to 20/20 to give a different side of the 
story.  20/20 wouldn't even talk to them.  

some of the accusations made by these 12 people were that these people had lost 
all their savings and one person even claimed to lose his house because he got 
involved in the company.  Further research found that this person did not lose 
his house, but he actually sold it for more than they paid for it!  

now some of you may be asking what does equinox and 20/20 have to do with the 
mass media?  everything!  because this is a company that is doing a lot of good 
for our generation.  They make charitable donations to several organizations 
many of us are familiar with, such as greenpeace and save the whales.   the sf 
rave scene is doing a lot for our generation, too, such as greg from harmony's 
wonderful bid to donate money to omar's well-being.  but it constantly is being 
picked on because people use drugs.  That is so one-sided it is absolutely 
pathetic!

In closing about equinox and 20/20, the day after the show aired, Bill Gouldd 
responded in a rebuttal show that is approximately 1 hour on his private 
satellite network (how's that for underground?), and he said "we've got a hugh 
downs, a john stosle, and a barbara wa-wa, sitting back, criticizing one of the 
only opportunities that you will ever have to live the kind of lifestyle that 
they enjoy on a daily basis."  This may not be an exact quote, but if anyone 
wants to view the tape, I would be happy to set that up with them.  This is our 
future, and nothing is going to stop us from making some improvements to this 
appalling situation we have going on in our country.  

=============================================================================
     
first of all, the mainstream media does not believe in peace, love, unity, 
or respect. they are experts in subverting, twisting, suppressing, and, 
finally, "commercializing" and taking over such messages and using them to 
their own advantage.
     =====================================================================
     
     This is very interesting, but unfortunately I believe it to be true.  
     We seem to be, in my eyes, on the verge of a higher collective 
     consciousness that will unify at least a small group of minds that 
     truly want change.  
     ====================================================================
     
secondly, there is not enough Unity among us to begin with. we have all 
sorts of different values, beliefs, etc. we bicker over these things all 
the time. right now we can't agree on this very question. trying to access 
the mass media would fragment us further.
     
third, PLUR and raving mean different things to all of us. i have seen far 
too many un-PLUR posts on this list (and this list is one of the most 
PLURry groups of people i've ever encountered.) to some people, raving is 
an escape from "real life." to others, raving _is_ real life, and the rest 
is just a recurring nightmare. other people think that raving is "the way 
things ought to be", and want to try to integrate the rave and non-rave 
worlds. many of us would like to live PLUR as everyday philosophy, but we 
find the stresses of everyday life too much for us. i'm not denigrating 
anyone for being "less-than-ideal", i'm just saying this:
     ======================================================
     
     The best message might be to simply lead by example.  
     
     ======================================================
     
if we could send a message to the world, what would it be? and would we be 
up to the challenge of truly leading by example?
     
i don't think we could agree, and i don't think we are prepared to put 
together any sort of unified example to lead by.
     
now, enough cynicism. i also hold some hope for these ideals.
     
LEADING BY EXAMPLE (take 2). we are individuals, the rest of the world is

every time you introduce a newbie to the scene...
every time you smile at a stranger, or give someone directions on the street... 
every time you give someone a much-needed hug...
every time you get someone to turn off their television... 
every time you convince someone to register to vote...
     
you are promoting PLUR.
     
a story:
     
my roommate, Susan, was walking down Market St. the week after her first 
rave (Beautiful People in September). a businessman walking near her started 
to cross the street against a red, nearly getting hit by a taxi and delaying 
some traffic. Susan asked him, don't you think if all the pedestrians 
respected the cars and all the cars respected the pedestrians (and 
eachother), the streets would be safer and less congested for both? the 
businessman looked at her skeptically and said, but everyone's not going to 
do that. Susan said, well it's gotta start with somebody, doesn't it?
     
Susan watched the businessman as he approached the next intersection. he 
waited until it was clear.

point: the best way to spread PLUR is to _live it_ ourselves, every moment 
of every day, not just when we're raving. until we all do that, talk of 
reaching mass audiences is futile.
     
YOU are a beautiful person. YOU can bring out the beauty in other people.

I agree! Through my bitterness over the lack of a romantic relationship
whatsoever for over three years, I found that I was pushing that type of
physical contact out of my life altogether. When I recently made some friends
who are Kamakazi huggers, my mood lifted considerably, and I now feel better
than I have in a long time. I'm living proof that hugs make a big
difference!!

So, everyone, get out from behind you cold computer monitor, and go hug
someome!!                   Now!

That's right - Wicked won't be at one of your usual spaces.  Since it's no
longer monthly, the parties will have a bit more planning put into them.

Harvey's a resident DJ from The Ministry of Sound in London; which is where
Thomas is at the moment (London that is).

        Actually, at Freedom, the trailer is a trailer that's always there.
It's used to cater to flat track, MX's, and quarter mile races on the
weekends and weeknights. It's been there for years, (and so have those
bathrooms in that wooden shack that are a shining example of hell).

        I've been racing at Sandhill for years, but the owner Tom Anderson
was an alcoholic dick who always tried to get more money while cutting
corners on designs and track quality. Now he mines most of the place. No one
in there right mind would ride there. He lives in that house to the right of
the entrance. 

        Also, my old High School, had Taco Bell carts n all. An Ice cream
cart would be heaven. . .

Subject: My Problem With PLUR...
Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

I know that I may get blasted for this one, but it's a theory that I have
been brewing for quite a while, and I just can't hold it in anymore.

I just believe that we can do better than PEACE, LOVE, UNITY, and RESPECT
with one single word- COMPASSION. I just feel that the word "unity" doesn't
carry the weight of undescriminating inclusion that should be the goal of
every human on the planet. I think that it has the potential of sending a
message of exclusivity to those who don't necessarily think, act, dress, or
play the same way that we do. 

The under ground is always talking about vibe. I believe that we can take the
power that we create in terms of a good vibe to transform the world. It
doesn't have to remain within the confines of our particular sociological
strata. 

Personally, I try every day to lift the vibe of the people with whom I come
in contact. Whether it be the supermarket checker, the cop who pulled me over
(but didn't give me the ticket), the teachers and students I deal with at
school, or my roommate who is the single most important person in my life, I
have made it a function of my life to promote well being for anybody who may
cross my path. The only tool I need to do this is COMPASSION.

This world is a hard place to exist, for everyone. I'm not saying that it's
not enjoyable, just that every moment is a challenge to be something better,
more evolved. All that we have that can truly depend upon to ease the
struggle is ourselves and each other. In order to be truly helpful, you must
be able to empathize and live from a place of compassion, not unity.

The universe is made of one thing- energy. Any unity is promoting a
separation from that which has not yet been included, or has not yet been
exposed.duality On the other hand,  compassion is the unyeilding acceptance
of concepts, appearances, and emotion through understanding.

I realize that the concept of PLUR is better than what a lot of people are
living by today. I just feel that there is a greater potential for humans to
live by. The underground is closest to my ideal, which I have yet to reach
myself.

Thank you for listening!
Take care of eachother-

That's actually not hard to do. You just have to get something like those
food wagens you see and lunch time in parking lots or at street corners,
the RV sorta looking things. You need good people that won't jack up the
prices also. I've seen mobile taco bells when I worked at Moffett Field in
Mt. View. There also are Burgr King  and KFC ones. Why can't there be a
7-11 type. If I'm not mistaken, at Freedom 96 there was some kind of
trailer that had food and drinks. A little pricey, but it was cool. Hell,
I'd offer and have offered to bring my BBQ to whoever wants to use it. That
offer always stands, however I'm not going to sit over it like I do at BBQ
& BEATS.

So, if anyone wants to use it for a party, just ask.  I think by also
having that BBQ at a "rave" there would be a better chance of passing the
party off as something other then a "rave". But of course the party would
have to have an outside area or something.

Happy Halloween!  You can celebrate all weekend with lots of stuff both
Friday and Saturday.  I removed some stuff from the weeklies (things
I haven't heard about for a long time), so if I accidentally dropped
a living party, let me know.

Also, remember to vote on Tuesday!!!

Many things in life are not a matter of choice, instead it is often a
matter of fact.  I do not play in sandboxes with 3 years olds, I do not go
to junior proms, or senior proms, I do not hang out with 16 or 17 year olds
as a general rule.

But I tell you what, I can dance, I listen to house music.  I make house
music.  I play house music.

I am very happy with myself and my standing.  And choose to associate with
those I have the most in common with.

Please remeber, YOUTH culture is generated by a bunch of greying white
males.  Youth have very little to do with the manufactured culture they
immerse themselves in.

And there are plenty who are much older than that.  Rest assured.

Hey Ariel,

Let us say that we differ in view.  I am far past being a child.  I have a
child of my own and I am concerned about his future.  I was speaking as a
parent who has to raise a child.  My child is not my equal, he is my child.
That is how societies grow, and are nutured, and how information is passed.
It's natural, and to me, not a matter of taste or academia.  Humans are
natural, thus we are animals.  The child/parent relationship is mimiced
throughout nature.

I do not want to be a "youth" for the rest of my life.  I am GLAD my 20's
are a memory, and look forward to apporaching 40.  I revel in the fact that
as I get older I get to see the world change.  I do not want to see the
world as a child, although I do miss the wonder at times, but am even more
grateful when I recognize the wonder the world has to offer.  Age is not
something I run away from, it is something I accept, and even revel in.  I
admire my seniors, and learn of the life they have lived.  We can all learn
something  from those older than us.  Youth, IMO, has it's place, and time
in a person's life.  As one's life changes these things become more
apparent.  Not to be patronizing at all, but how you think and how you view
the world will change as you get older.  It already has; you do not see the
world through the same eyes you did when you were 6, or 12, or 18.  And as
you get older, things will continue to change.  To me, this is progress,
evolution.

Our children's future is in our hands.  They, the children, have to deal
with the future we plant today.

Age is a good thing.  And I am glad I went through my teens, my twenties,
and am going through my thirties.  Life rocks, and it gets better as you
get older.

trust.

Peace,
John


P.S.  Damn reading this shit, I fell like my next evoltionary phase will
involve diapers (i.e. Depends).  Eeech!  Did I say something about looking
forward to getting older....  ;)

'Tis the night when the dead come back to party... All Hallow's eve, my
favorite holiday...

A couplet for some of our local promoters:

	Hear the sound of bass and drums
	Something Wicked this way comes!

And another potential reason trick-or-treating may be better than sex:
 
	The shorter you are, the more respect you get!
	
But still, it must be said:

	Trick or treat or turn a trick
	You'll have fun whichever you pick!   ;)

Happy Halloween,	
				<<< Starchild >>>

And now I depart to other haunts...

Hello everyone!

        Tomorrow night, Friday the 1st, there will be a benefit party for
the Pacific Sound System (as some of you might know). The Pacific crew has
consistently thrown some of the best underground parties around. They are
completely devoted to helping our scene, by filling their parties with tons
of positive energy. They have, for the past three years, provided a free
party almost every weekend during the summer. (As well as providing the best
new year's parties around!!) The energy that they have created and put into
their parties cannot go without notice...

        So on that note, it would be a great "thank you" to the entire
Pacific Crew, if you would come out to the benefit party tomorrow night! It
is going to be completely amazing!! There will be at least two rooms (that I
know of) filled with the most intense vibes!! You do not want to miss this
party!!! This party is being put on by a whole bunch of people who know and
love the P.S.S. They/we/you are doing this only out of respect and love! So
come out and show your support to the Pacific Sound System!!!

Peace and love,

Greg =) 
Peace, love and harmony to all!!!

Greg =)
