Hi Everyone!  I hope you all had lots of adventures last night...  my 
Halloween consisted of partyhopping across Berkeley, dressed (absolute 
last minute) as a (so original!) kittycat.  The ears may make a repeat 
appearance at one of our parties! ;)

BSP: Today is my Birthday!!  27!  (um, could someone please tell me how 
that happened?  I swear to God yesterday I was 21... :P)

So, to celebrate my birthday, I'm going to do my favorite thing in the 
world... go out dancing with all of you!  But where to go?

I'm very attracted to MANTRA - psychedelic trance on the spiritual tip.  
The Pacific Benefit too is a worthy cause... but two hesitations: house 
music and (I'm sorry to say) Thomas Trouble.  Now, Irish Tom is one of 
those great characters in our scene, and I met him at my first party, but 
I've heard mediocre things about the parties he's thrown and his dj'ing 
(though he may be much better now).  What are people's thoughts on that??
And where are y'all headed??

See ya tonite,
love,
Nancy

DANGER! EXTREMELY LONG!! (but i think relevant and interesting)

	Wow you just hit on my pet theory (kindof)! Except that my 
pet theory is that flapper women 
were trying to emulate children in their persual of 
men. So really you didn't say the same thing. I also think (in my 
extremely perceptive sense of observation) that there is a significant 
number of raver girls who do the same thing, or at least that I have 
noticed down south. You'd see the lollipop sucking pigtail havin little 
girly giggling high cute voice tweeting raver girls appealing to the boys 
while on e, in overt sexuality. My theory isn't totally hashed out in the 
flapper aspect of the argument, b/c it was a similar (but different!) 
sort of malaise. is that the right word? 
But anyway, flappers wore corsets to squish their breasts down and appear 
flat-chested, and really deemphasize any curves, as did the cut of their 
dresses. I got my spark from watching the movie version of the Great 
Gatsby, where at his party is this flock of women running around 
screaming and then there's this cabaret type scene where the 
singers/dancers have these high trilling voices and well, I know that's 
not much evidence, but...
	Well I see a parallel in the sort of feigned sense of sexual equality 
during the flapper period and what I observed down south. The "little girl"
appeal of what is currently determined to be -fashionable- in my own 
opinion can certainly not be denied; looking in any advertisement or 
magazine geared to the younger set (teens +) would evidence this. And 
then there's that mixed up sexuality bit. 
The flapper period was definitely one of sensuality and the beginnings of 
sexual freedom, and the ability to get totally trashed and fucked up like 
never before, out of which arose role confusion. 
So I don't know how my argument is even convinceable, and if anyone has 
any insight let me know.
However, Andy, I disagree w/ the flapper/hippie comparison. The flapper 
period was one of change, yes, but in a melancholy party to you die, 
conspicuous consumption, glamour seeking sort of way (perhaps 
demonstrated by the Decadence art movement of the time, specifically what 
arose out of the Symbolist and Art Nouveau movements?). 
It hailed spiritedness, independence, but in a self-destructive
 manner. I guess that's where I see similarities in our 
popular culture, in the Heroin eyes fuck me look 
of feminine passivity portrayed in fashion marketing, and other venues.
The hippies, however, encited awareness of the nature of status quo. 
Because of them we presently have a greater number environmentally aware 
and activist people in our nation. Flag burning is a strong symbol, but 
strength is wholly admirable.
	The thing with the mass marketing of the PLUR idealism is that it won't 
work precisely b/c it doesn't carry you any further than believing in 
love; which is powerful in it's simplicity, but there's a lot of room for
hypocrisy in love as evidenced in western literature (literature being 
myths, or a statement of the way people operate). I think people must be 
encited, or excited, to go beyond a mere pronouncement of PLUR (which is 
a fundament, I'm not saying that PLUR is not a wonderful attitude), but 
to release their apathy. An excellent means of furthering this basis of 
understanding is environmental awareness, which is respect at its basic 
level. I read a quote the other day, and I can't remember who wrote 
it, or what it was verbatim, but it basically said 
that during the turn of the century, the fear was not good or evil, but 
mediocrity. i think that that's what we're moving towards- mediocrity. we 
don't care enough about something to make it worthwhile, make it real.

but the weekend's just begun! :)

w0w, Castro street last night was where the fun was at! so much to
see, so much craziness. It was probably the first time since Burning
Man that I've seen a person in a kangaroo suit dancing alongside a
drag queen in a drum circle... And thank Bob for the Civic Center party; 
it really helped to filter out the evil, drunk, annoying, out-of- 
control people from the Castro (we encountered them on the bus and 
decided to skip the Civic Center stop).

I love Halloween... and I'm sad to see it's over...

But tonight is Mantra! great lineup, goa trance, and Chai tea...
Need I say more?

Look for the angel wings... they'll be making their final appearance
in an attempt to drag out the Halloween spirit as long as possible ;)

Hey everybody,

I jsut talked to Averil (sp?) who is organizing the Celtic new year/winter
solstice celebration going on down south near Yosemite this weekend.  it
sounds really awesome...two soundsystems- one for trance in a heated
warehouse, and one for ambient, featuring one of my fave djs: Felix!

415-273-1845

For those of you that know Bill and Gaby- Averil met them in Thailand and
gave her my number...what a trip!

love,

ann

Hey there kiddos!

I hope everyone out there had a nice Hallowe'en, didn't get too loaded, and
has enough vitamin C to get them through the weekend.

I just wanted to let y'all know that tonight, that loveable hooligan Thomas
Trouble is having a party in honor of Pacific, the guys who've been giving
us the free Sunset parties every Sunday.  The intention is to show our
appreciation of the Sunset crew's unending selflessness, and help them
repair and replace equipment they've been burning out all summer with their
spacey trancey thumping.

This will be a 100% benefit party. (Minus, of course,  94% of the profits,
which will be given to the chillroom DJ's in restitution for all the
ambient dj's of the world who have gone unpaid. ;o)


Here's the line-up as I know it:

on the main dance floor:
   Galen, Solar, Thomas Trouble, Andrew Rawnsley, Ethan, Alex, Monte, John

   Howard (TBC) (Howard might have already been confirmed by now, I'm not sure)

jungle/breakbeat: Professor Smith all by his lonesome

outdoor ambient: BoomFidget and JustSin spinning your favorite '80's dance
hits, in the tradition of The Edge Nightclub in Palo Alto.  Joke.

The party will be in a beautiful spot in the central part of the East Bay
(and by beautiful, I *don't* mean a nice looking warehouse surrounded by
pretty barbed wire and attractive shipyard cranes in west oakland.  This
spot is very pleasing to the palate, in a clean and safe area)

For those of you who have been suspicious of some of the benefit parties
thrown earlier this fall, I'll see if I can pull some strings to have
Thomas' accountant hand out spreadsheets at the exit door ;o)

I'll be the geek in the necktie mixing the Grateful Dead with Samuel
Barber's Adagio for Strings.  Hope to see you there, and thanks in advance
for not beating me up.

S.L.U.R.P.,

b))merang

This is a great idea, but not a new one.  The first time I saw this was 
at Grape Ape/Millenium a few years back (where incidentally I heard 
Andrew Weatheral (808 State) spin -- *DAMN*).  They had Hot Dogs, Tofu 
Dogs, Fountain Sodas, Espresso, Juices, etc...  It wasn't terribly cheap, 
but it's probably the best thing for you that you could spend your money 
on at a party.  

Incidentally, that location on Jerold St. (the rave cafe) sold veggie 
burgers (: Homemade patties!!! :) all night long.  Last time I went there 
I ate 2 *oink*.  At an all night party, some people forget how important 
it is to eat.  It used to be more common to see free fruit or food 
vendors at parties (at least in So Cal), but I guess less people are into 
providing such a service.  Don't get me wrong, it still exists...it's 
just harder to find.   So, pack a sack lunch & hope for ins-n-outs.

I guarantee you this will happen. Raves right now are mostly attended by
youths/young adults. All these people who have expierenced the vibe will
grow up like everyone else and become mothers, fathers, doctors,
politicans, teachers, ect. This is when the true test of the integrety
of the vibe will happen. As with all things in life, what happens to you
now will affect how you behave later. The question is: How/Will
something like PLUR affect the desicions of people in 5 Years? 10? 40?

What are the LONG TERM implications of the vibe? Will it fade out, like
an echo in a cave? Or is it a chain reaction, like the chaotician's
"Butterfly effect"?

There will always be "Underground Parties". But people come and go from
within the sociological strata. People change jobs, homes, lifestyles.
Will what they expierence now stay with them later on in the future?

I don't know the anwsers to these questions. But I do know that these
questions MUST stay in the forefront of our mind when we disscuss how
PLUR and the vibe (are they not one and the same?) will affect our
society.

I just want everyone to know Jonathan was the shit, played some awesome
tunes ... he had the first spot, so the room was empty when he started, cuz
they hadn't started letting anyone in yet, and suddenly about 25 people
walk in together and just started dancing HARD!

This was my first party of Vlad's (FeelGood) and I have to say it was SOOO
well done!  THe space was gorgeous, 2 big dance rooms, no sound bleed,
plenty of halls with air circulation where you could still hear the music
if you got to hot dancing with the crowd...  and a chill space with about
50 mattresses all over the floor!  Face painting, cheap water, lots of
porta potties.... well planned and executed.

Yep, there was a gangsta element for sure ... and even the Fairy RaveMother
wasn't immune (got kicked back by a circle dancer that for some reason
thought MY dancing spot should be HIS dancing spot ... but of course, I
cleared that up in a fat hurry!  Shit, don't kick the fucking Fairy
RaveMother, little boy!  He apologized later) ...

But I made some new friends, saw some old ones I don't usually get to spend
time with, and stayed until 4:45 a.m. (after arriving at 9 for Jonathan's
set) ... bottom line, a great way to spend Halloween!

If anyone found my bag of wishes (small red bag with gold embroidery...
actually filled with glitter and wishes) I'd love it back unless it found a
better home.

Love, Leslie

"Let me have silence always in the centre of the shouting, that is
essential. Let me have silence so that no pin may drop and not be

needle scratching upon this gramophone of the circular cosmic spot.
Hear me, mark me, learn me, throw the mind's ear open. Shut up the
mind's eye, all will be music. What sculpture of sound cannot, what

I'd tell you what I'll be wearing but after playing QUAKE for 2hrs
straight, all I can think about are my sore hands. I'd go to Samhain,
but my car would never make the trip and I've been to busy (or lazy,
take your pick) to hook up with a ride. I will be at the Pasific Benefit
though.

See you out there!!!!! :)

 Actually, that was very helpful - "central part of eastbay" means something 
south of Oakland to me. Means I can take a nap, drive across the bridge,
hang out in Berkeley for awhile. Then call the info number and find out 
where the map point is ( I guess/hope there's a map point? More chance 
of getting busted if the admission is payed at the venue )( unless it's
the Richmond Civic Center ..., but that can't be....).

good night ...

Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

     
     
     Not sure if these directions were already posted,as i was having 
     server prblems last night. Also, could anyone with room in their car 
     private e-mail me so I can hopefully hook up pepole needing transport?
     
     
     Directions from San Francisco :
     
     
     Take the 580 east past Altamont,
     Then take the LA exit off the 580,
     Look for signs for the 132 East toward Modesto
     Next, watch out for signs for the 99 south toward Merced. 
     From Merced, take the 140 East toward Mariposa.
     The venue is .....
     10-11 miles past Mariposa on the 140 East towards Yosemite National 
     Park. The property is on the left hand side of the road and is marked 
     with signs and balloons.
     
     
     Transport :
     
     There are still a limited number of seats available on the bus which 
     will be leaving San Francisco at 10 tomorrow. You can leave a message 
     on the transport info line.
     
     
     
     Samhain information line : 415-273-1845
     Leave your name, number, message of support and someone will try and 
     get back to you.
     Transport, directions and accomadation info : 415-208-1820
     
     Looking forward to seeing some of you up there for what will be a 
     unique spiritual celebration of life, love and unity in a natural 
     environment.

READ THIS CAREFULLY!  It's not what it first appears to be.  ;)

  Craig Shergold is a 10 year old boy who is dying of cancer.  Before he dies,
 he would like to set the world record for receiving the most Neiman-Marcus
 Cookie Recipes.  You can help Craig by sending an irate fax to LEXIS-NEXIS
 demanding that they remove all traces of your mother's maiden name from their
 executive washroom wall.  They will respond by sending e-mail labeled
 "goodtimes" to the computer controlling Craig's life support equipment.  When
 Felippe Linz, the technician operating the computer opens this mail, his hard
 drive will be overwritten with thousands of credit card invoices for $250.00,
 erasing the last bit of evidence that Hillary was seen on the grassy knoll
 when JFK was shot, thus allowing world domination by Bill Gates, and his
 tri-lateral commission cronies who are eating fried peanut butter and banana
 sandwiches in the black helicopters with Elvis.

Friends,

Anyone happen to know if there are any known compatibility problems concerning
a Cyrix 6x86 166MHz and Windows 95, please email me privately. I was running
the August 1995 release of Win without any problems, but OSR2 and OSR3 won't
wwork for me. I can install it alright, and then get into Windows to set it
all up, but once I have to restart Windows to finish it all...it won't let me
in. I get a blank screen. Any ideas? Thanks a lot!

reespect, jonas

It is a known fact that nothing is fully tested with Cyrix chips. Frankly I
don't think that software designers care wether or not there programs work
with Cyrix chips.
Unless you have changed mother boards aswell, it iz defonetly your
processor.
But if you really want to run that version of Win95...   Slowing your clock
speed down to about 133 should fix the problem.. If not. I couldn't amagine
it not working with your clock speed set to a 90Mhz CPU.

"I was unhappy because I had no shoes until I met a man who had no feet."
				-(author unknown to me)

	It's a fact of life that everybody sees the world differently, and
two people in an identical situation (were such a thing possible) could
have two radically different perceptions of their reality, depending upon 
their individual DNA configurations and life experiences.
	Maybe MDMA does sometimes make people perceive "dirty ass
warehouses" as the best places in the world.  Is fully enjoying something
while experiencing it the same as covering up reality?
	Maybe in a sense it is.  Many people believe that the partners 
they are with are the people they were meant to be with, and that they are
happier with their partners than they would be with anyone else in the
world.  Considering the number of people out there, this is very unlikely
-- unless you believe so strongly in your present happiness that you
make it a reality for yourself.  This is not easy, but it's easier on E!
				8)
	For what it's worth, a self-hypnosis tape I have on "how to be
happy" advises that the key to being happy is not getting what you want,
but wanting what you have, and "upgrading your *wants* to *preferences*."
	I don't think the happiness we feel on MDMA is any less real than
non-drug-induced happiness.  All happiness involves "covering up" or
ignoring reality in some sense.  If you could be aware, right now, of all
the torment wracking the minds and bodies of untold millions of human
beings across the globe, how could you have the peace of mind to be happy
and still retain any of the compassion that makes you human?  Yet that
suffering is reality; it is only by limiting your awareness of it, by
choosing to perceive it as something removed from your reality, rather
than part of the larger reality we all in fact share, that you can be
happy.
	Only God, if such a creature exists, could know "the reality of
everything."  Makes one wonder, can a divine being know all of this and be
happy?  If happiness and all other emotions are subjective perceptions,
wouldn't knowing everything render one perfectly emotionless?
	But such deep theological questions aside, saying "the only
good thing about E is it makes you very positive" seems to me to be
missing the whole point, kind of like saying "the only good thing about
that restaurant is that the food is delicious."  I mean, isn't that the
primary consideration?  Would you want to take a drug that makes you
*less* positive?  Would you want to eat in a restaurant with bad food?  
	My own experiences with MDMA have not made me feel that I did not
want to change.  To the contrary, they have awakened in me a profound
*desire* to change, a realization that life can be much better, and that
the key to making it better lies inside each of us.  Exstasy has increased
my motivation to fulfill my highest human potential, something I see as
not only a positive goal, but also a logical one.
	Aryck, what do you consider to be a "logical" way to live?  Is
it logical to rave?  If you feel that Exstasy offers us nothing to "deal
with the real world logically," aren't you saying in effect that it's
illogical to be happy?  I hope this is not your concious philosophy!  8)

Much love,
				<<< Starchild >>>

Bill Gates expires in a car accident. He finds himself in purgatory,
being sized up by St. Peter.

"Well, Bill, I'm really confused on this call; I'm not sure whether
to send you to Heaven or Hell. After all, you enormously helped society
by putting a computer in almost  every home in America, yet you also
created that ghastly Windows '95. I'm going to do something I've never
done before in your case; I'm going to let you decide where you want to
go."

Bill replied, "well, what's the difference between the two?" St.
Peter said, "I'm willing to let you visit both places briefly, if it
will help your decision."

"Fine, but where should I go first?"

"I'll leave that up to you."

"Okay then," said Bill, "Let's try Hell first."

So Bill went to Hell. It was a beautiful, clean, sandy beach with
clear waters and lots of bikini-clad women running around, playing in
the water, laughing and frolicking about.  The sun was shining; the
temperature perfect. He was very pleased.

"This is great!" he told St. Peter. "If this is hell, I REALLY  want
to see heaven!""Fine," said St. Peter, and off they went.

Heaven was a place high in the clouds, with angels drifting about,
playing harps and singing. It was nice, but not as enticing as Hell.

Bill  thought for a quick minute, and rendered his decision. "Hmmm. I
think I'd prefer Hell," he told St. Peter.

"Fine," retorted St. Peter, "as you desire."

So Bill Gates went to Hell.

Two weeks later, St. Peter decided to check on the late billionaire
to see how he was doing in Hell. When he got there, he found Bill,
shackled to a wall, screaming amongst  hot flames in dark caves, being
burned and tortured by demons.

"How's everything going?" he asked Bill.

Bill responded, with his voice filled with anguish and disappointment,
"This is awful! This is nothing like the Hell I  visited two weeks ago!
I can't believe this is happening! What  happened to that other place,
with the beautiful beaches, the scantily-clad women playing in the
water?!???"

"That was a demo," replied St. Peter.

E has lowered my (way-too-high) social inhibitions, and helped me realize
how these internal hangups work so i can move past them. it has helped me
meet some wonderful people who became close friends later, under sober
circumstances. it has sharpened my awareness of the lack of peace and love
in the world and how i can help change that situation...

like any drug, it should not be thought of as an end in itself but as a
(partial) means.

E does not give me an artificial sense of happiness. if i'm unhappy and i
take E, it _at best_ makes me realize why i'm unhappy and how i might
change that, and at worst, makes me feel like shit.

a psychiatrist wrote an article a while back on "happiness as a
psychological disorder"... putting forth arguments as to how happiness was
not a normal state of mind, etc.  it kind of fits in with your comments on
shutting out all of the misery in the world... it was an interesting idea,
but i think (having taken E and all :) that happiness should be considered
(at least potentially) a normal state of existence.

        Well, I disagree on some other's posts about thursday. I actually
didn't have a good time at all (partly cuz of me and my girlfriend having
troubles). I was getting pissed off when every time I'd try to dance, I'd
have to eventually stop because of people walking right into the center of
where I was gettin down, and they'd just stand there??? Every little place I
looked, I saw "KIDS" walking around with 40's, drunk ass losers, people
staring others down, and someone hitting on my girlfriend and her friend.
There was not enough room or ventilation for all the people that were there.
My shoes are basically dead now cuz of the amount of sludge from the dance
floors that's made it's home on them. The floors were soooooooo slippery, I
actually almost fell a few times (and usually a little slick is a good thing
for me to dance on). 

        It really pissed me off when I brought a big ol water bottle that I
got for a dollar with me (it wasn't opened yet), and the people at the door
said that I couldn't take it in with me??? Then they took it from me and
said that they'll just use it in case someone od's or something. . . DICKS!!!!

        There were tons of people on drugs, I didn't meet one other person
who wasn't besides me, my girlfriend, and Jenny. 

        Another little thought: It's amazing how some people have totally
screwed up their lives with drugs n all. I knew a few girls that were there,
a couple of them , are like 14. THose girls have f***** themselves soooo
hard on drugs, they're like permanently spaced. They were on shrooms and
roaming abound with such a spoacey look in their eyes , they actually
normally look like that. It's cute n all, but I feel sorry for people like
that cuz their brain isn't even close to full development yet, and they've
already destroyed half of it. Sad, sad, sad. . . 

        I met one or two nice people.

        Leslie helped me out with my girlfriend (or at least showed me how
to get better).

        I swear that I was going to get into a fight with someone (but I
wouldn't have started it).

        Everything cost money (except the bathrooms and parking).

        They did have a lot of blacklights, which was cool.

        

        I pretty much didn't like it because of most of the people there.
But seriously, anyone who e'd that night, tell us how your night was. . .
just curious. I don't mean to sound un-nice or nuthin. Have a good week
everyone, more rain, more rain, and more rain. . . SNow, SNow, SNow, too. . . 

Give it all a "natural" smile  :)
not an :e)

Y'know, I really look up to people who can have fun without help from
whatever, a friend (who's having a problem with steroids) actually told me
yesterday that you can't have fun unless you drink. And he's bringing down
my other friend Jason (who I haven't seen totally sober for like 2-3 months).

What's this world coming to.
Even my home town is remeniscent of most of Oakland, and it used to be such
a nice place to live. . .

the grand-but-short tradition of c.z. raves continues...

Well, the music was ON, the decorations were SOOPER, the hard trance was
RAGIN' and the crowd was DECENT but why-oh-why did the cops have to shut
the shit down while Ethan was going off????

OH well, at least Thomas had the gall to keep spinning his unique blend of
trance favorites (accent!! good lord that song is dope! =) 'til the sweet
foggy morning...

One Question: Why are all the decorations and speakers and amps and shit
still at my house???? and where is Thomas??? I swear, all that crap's gonna
get jacked by at least one of the 125 people who have the keys to the front
door if he doesn't start returning messages soon...

So i went to Technique last night and had a semi decent time. At about
three thirty I sat down with my friends and butt watched for a while (Not
really, but thats all you can see from that perspective). Anyway I noticed
a cop walking by just jammin to the music in his own little way, and
having never seen such an amazing sight before I reached out and grabbed
his hand on impluse. He turned around smiled and squeezed my hand and
proceeded towards the DJ. I just have one thing to say about this incident
(keeping in mind that I am often prejudiced towards cops). What is
probably the biggest danger to the rave world? busted parties? Everything
each one of us does while at a party reflects on everyone else, so when
spreading the vibe around, please don't discriminate. luv yuz --debbie

I have been listening to all the messages of sfraves for about two weeks.
I live very far from San Francisco, Tampa, FL.  I joined the list because
I love electronic and dance music and I plan to move to San Francisco. 
The only reason I'm speaking up is because the problems or
solutions MDMA offer is some thing that concerns me deeply.   I read
Aryck's theory and agree w/ him.  The problem here in Florida, I've been
to events in Jacksonville, Tampa, Miami, and Orlando, is all these REALLY
young kids that don't understand moderation. I used to take E all the time
at any expense and it just isn't worth it.  I have school and work
to think about now.  I don't understand how some people seem to always be
on it. I haven't quit using it, I just don't do it every weekend.  I am
also concerned about the kids that I don't think belong in the scene
because they don't have a good time unless they're on it.  I agree that it
has opened my mind and heart to others in the scene but I hate it when I
see people at a really good event only there because they want to drugs.
It disappoints me.  I think the shift in focus around Florida is from the
music and dancing to doing MDMA. Its a really sad reality and I hope my
move to California will be change from opting to listen to music and
do drugs in my own home.

Hi folks!!  =)


 Well the 1st Mantra monthly (Full On Fridays) got off with a bang but 
sorta fizzled at the end.

 We started at Big Heart City. The Mantra crew did an amazing job of 
decorating the place and Dutch put together an amazing sound system. Huge 
props on the sound!! The b-lite banners were simply amazing!! Raven (our 
sacred altar Goddess) had perhaps the most amazing new banner that night. 
I won't bother describing it as words simply would not do it justice.

 The ambient room suffered from noise bleed; so what else is new. Ambient 
rooms always get last considerations (unless I'm in charge! :) However 
Kraig (sp?) did a fine job of blending his sound with the bleed sound 
from the dance floor.

 Anna started out and I thought the first half of her set was stunning! 
She was jolting my spinal cord just the right way! It was especially nice 
to see her pitch in and help with the set up. It really made the party 
seem like a family affair.

 Theta Blip was on next and he too was blinding. I probably danced the 
most during his long set.

 Then of course Dutch came on and everything went right out the door. 
Talk about some crazy movements on the dance floor! The only real 
complaint was that Dutch had everyone moving so hard that the dancers 
were causing the tonearms to skip... usually right at a peak. Thank 
goodness Dutch is such a pro and recovered as well as he could.

 I had to leave and go set up the majority of my equipment at (shudder) 
Acme. Since BHC closed at 4, the plan was to regroup at Acme and continue 
there, with free chai, until 10 or 11 am. Well Moonpup came in and 
started to really lay down some heavy shit when who should appear but the 
fire marshall. He was lonely I guess and called for Willy's boys (SFPD). 
So we had to stop. Argh!

 Well I'm pushing the Mantra crew for no more BHC parties. The change 
over from one venue to another is just too painful. We will see what the 
future holds.

 Thanks to everyone who came out. We all enjoyed having you trance folks 
out with us that night. Especially huge BIG thanks go out to my crew; 
perhaps the most consistant and hard working crew that has ever worked 
with me personally. Sarah, David and of course my slide projector 
expert, Anarch. You folks filled my heart with joy with your willing help 
and support



hugz y'all,

Ran @ Dionysus Dreams

Hey Aryck,

I know exactly how you feel.  Before i moved I was getting to the point 
were all the parties I went to were not as fun as they used to be for one 
main reason.  I was getting disturbed/annoyed with the influences drugs 
had made on most of my friends in the rave scene.  Many of my close 
friends have drifted away (maybe I've drifted from them) because they 
don't go to parties for the same reasons I still go to them for.  I love 
to dance my ass of to bomb ass beats --- FIRST I love to meet great 
people and exchange interesting ideas with people at parties -- SECOND  I 
love to just be around a bunch of people having a great time  --- THIRD.  
Anything else is extra for my evening.  

	My ex-girlfriend and friends are the type who are very suceptable 
to peer presure (lack of self-esteem I guess) and all are just going down 
hill.  CR is the main culppret.  In my eyes there are Very bad drugs out 
there and there are drugs that are acceptable (to me) to be used IN 
MODERATION in opening peoples minds and perceptions to whole new concepts in 
life.
      My life has certainly change because of the rave scene for the 
better in that i am more open to new things and people, I feel I'm less steriotypical of 
people, I am less of a shy person (It's so easy to say hi with no 
inabitions), I have realized a focus in life and have been able to seperate fun from "work" inorder to fufill a happy 
lifestyle.
           I chose to move to San Luis Obisbo to go to cal poly and to 
get away from my so called friends in the rave scene.  I keep in touch 
with those I want to now and I get a chance to work for something I want 
to achieve in life = a career.  I could have chosen Berkley or gone south 
but I wanted a break and besides SF and LA are only a quick 3.5 hours 
away.  I'm even trying to help out the locals here with the growing rave 
scene, and I stay on this list as well as Socal-raves to stay in touch. 
	The best thing is to offer help to those who realize they have a
 problem.  I've found you can't help those that don't want to be helped 
(look at those forced in to rehab by the courts).  Let those you care 
about know your worried about their behavior and let them know that you 
will be there for them if they need it.  
    Besides all that keep dancin' and keep smilin'

Back to homework and my Dan - Jeno - Garth sf tapes.....


PLUR,

       Austin

	Malaise?  I associate that with Jimmy Carter, not flappers.  8)
But I've noticed the similarties between flapper and raver girls too; I
think it's a wonderful trend, and I hope it continues.
Betty-boop-boppin' flapper gals had it goin' on!  ;)

That's interesting that you see those models this way, to me they exhibit
mostly tired, jaded, and unfriendly demeanors, not at all a fun, positive
"fuck me" look.  Do these ads ever show girls (or guys) in the throes of
passion?  Generally they show scraggly-looking kids standing around in
post-grunge clothing with nary a smile to be seen.

You said something there!  Maybe if more people cared, the models in
fashion ads would look less apathetic too, as a sort of reflection of the
popular culture.

On the other hand, making it real, while good in an emotional and cultural
sense, may be misleading people in other areas.  As the Odwalla debacle
shows, sometimes artificial and pasteurized is better!   8)

Much love,

Hello,

        I will start off by saying, Harmony Productions is looking for some
new ideas and creativity. Basically, what we are looking for is creative
people to do designing for some of our banners, props, etc. There is no
limit to what your imagination can come up with, nor are there any
guidelines as to what we are asking for. If you are interested in helping
with this please don't hesitate to respond!

        We have a couple parties coming up that we are doing new designs
for. First is Omar's party, "A Wrinkle in Time" (11/16/96), the next
Beautiful People party (12/?/96), and the, well, we'll talk about this one
later... Anyways, so there is a lot we can do, we just need more input from
you guys to do it! Please respond privately if interested. Thanks in advance! 

Peace,

Greg =)
Peace, love and harmony to all!!!

Greg =)

<DUH>
Ooops!!  Sorry, didn't mean to cc the list on that response to Monday
Night Dinner.  Should be paying more attention, I guess!
</DUH>

I had a phenomenal weekend!  It was really, really low-key in relation to
my past few weekends (only one party?  Hee hee!)  But just as sleep
deprived, and just as much fun - if not more.

I somehow managed to not sleep at all on Thursday night - so work Friday
was really interesting, and I was in a truly twisted state of mind by the
time I was supposed to get to BHC to help Ran with the Mantra setup.  But
I still somehow stayed upright for most of the night.  Helping Randy was a
lot of fun - watching the setup of the main space was really amazing too,
though.  They had the most incredible blacklight paintings I have ever
seen!  The four vertical paintings that were fitted into the pillars on
the dance floor were especially incredible (IMHO.)

Then the music started and the fatigue disappeared for awhile.  (It came
back later, and *hard*, though.)  It was really rad!  I don't get very
much Goa in my diet normally, and I really enjoyed.  Someone (not sure
who...) mentioned that the music and visuals were very similar in ways -
pretty but overwhelming and confusing and jumbled at first, until you
concentrate, and then all the beatiful patterns and subtleties become
apparent.  Very true!!  Anna was really fun to watch - she was *so* into
her music!  At one point, she threw on a record, came out and danced for a
few minutes, then went back behind the turntables.  That was great!!  She
also spun a track I loved, with a repetitive cricket noise as the
background.

Theta Blip kicked ass, a harder & more driving set.  I think I took a nap
at about that point - managed to miss Dutch, unfortunately, because when I
woke up it was time to head over to ACME fnord to help Randy some more
fnord.

Within an hour of our arrival, the Acme was once again transformed from
the hideous, decrepit & disintegrating warehouse into the magical dance
zone, thanks to Randy's visual stimulus and a lot of hard work, the best
Chai I have ever tasted (from Nub Circus), the beginnings of a fun-filled
set by Moonpup, and dozens of super-fun people!  But alas, it was not
meant to be.  I really, really hope people give up on the ACME warehouse.
It's not worth it.  IMHO, of course.

Cleanup was really interesting - I started to get a bit bitchy from the
fatigue, but pulled through with Chai and hugs, and when the truck was
loaded and the ACME desolate once again, I was greeted by the most
beautiful thickly foggy morning I've ever seen here - couldn't see the
downtown skyscrapers from 3rd&Mission from the fog.

Sleep felt *so* good.

The rest of the weekend was just incredible, low-key and happy.  Walked
around a lot, had good food & excellent company, flew a kite - I even
slept plenty.  It was great.

So now it's monday, another long week ahead.  I hope to see many of you at
Monday Night dinner tonight, and tons of you at Audio Impact wednesday.
And this weekend: 2012!!  Take care all, & have an excellent Monday!

Are there any reviews for this?  Or were they all sucked off the physical
plane into the astral plane just like the Mayans?

I only went to one party this weekend: Mantra on friday night. But
that's okay because I'm feeling very well rested, and ready to tackle
Audio Impact this wednesday :)

Unfortunately, I showed up late to Mantra, which I'm really kicking
myself about (I heard that Anna's set was fantastic). But I did get to
hear Theta Blip and Dutch. Theta (who I've only heard once before)
played nothing but non-stop in your face goa; the music would only let
up for a measure at a time before pounding back in. Dutch, as always,
played a great set; the music wasn't as viscerally intense (but more
intense in other ways), which was perfect... I really needed to wind
down after Theta.

My one complaint about the night: the sound system was great, and it
was well spread out around the space. However, deep bass was seriously
lacking; it was as if someone had carved out the entire bottom octave.
The high and mids were really crisp, but I never had that bass
pounding in my chest feeling. No big deal, though.

The Mantra crew made excellent use of the space: day glow paintings
and banners were hung liberally throughout. There were enough
blacklights to turn everyone into walking glow-sticks regardless of
where one was (never can get enough blacklights :). And the space was
so well lit, while still retaining the essence of darkness! I
appreciated this so much. There's nothing worse than not being able to
see what's going on or who's around you (ever lose your friends at
Sunset?).

The artwork of the day glow banners was truly beautiful. It's my
understanding that they were all designed and painted by the Mantra
people; simply amazing. The beauty of the artwork could not be
appreciated while dancing around wildly... the amount of detail and
depth of meaning of each banner required much examination to really
understand what each one was about. And in that sense, it was a
wonderful complement to the music. Goa itself cannot be fully
appreciated while casually listening... there is so much going on and
so many levels of detail and texture.

The after party, unfortunately, was at the Acme. Considering the big
stink that happened the last time, trying to throw anything rave
related there was simply not a good idea. Shortly after the music
started, it was shutdown by the fire department. It was too bad,
because that would have been Moonpup's final set in San Francisco.  So
we cleaned up and moved the party to the parking lot. No sound system,
but we enjoyed the bounty of Nub Chai (yummy!), the very same
*wonderful* people who introduced me to Chai (and jungle) at Burning
Man. After drinking their Chai, San Francisco Chai just tastes like
water.

After being kicked out of the Acme by the fire people, some horrible
police officer (who I could tell had more than his share of bad karma
and donuts for one lifetime) decided to add insult to injury and be
Mr. Tough Guy policeman. The bottom line is if that space is ever used
again, everyone will be arrested. I don't know if that was an idle
threat or a promise, but I don't want to be around to find
out. There's no way I'm letting my ass get traded for a pack of
cigarettes by some guy named Bubba.

And there's no way that I'll ever go to another party at Acme. I've
had a lot of fun there, it's a great space, but it's dead. And it's
deadly. There's a reason why they don't want us to party there. The
fireman said it best: you look like a nice bunch of people who are
just having fun and not doing anything wrong, but this building is too
unsafe. My position exactly.

Anyway, despite getting busted, I still had a great time talking to
friends outside and helping to clean up. So it's all good :)

So I'm really looking forward to the next *full-on* friday Mantra
party; that was just too much fun :). And the vibe was so
great. There's was so much collective energy without there being a big
pile of mushy people. I was actually able to dance in my own space for
the entire night and be in my own little world in trance land. If I
wanted to be left alone, people would leave me alone. If I wanted to
be social, people would be social with me. Noone was in my face or in
my way. Perfect :)

See you at Mad tonight! As usual, it's at the Bahia Cabana, home of
the Saturday night Macerena party. ;)

psychedelically yours,
Steve

Nov 16th 1996

The Elevators are back in service!!

Socal-raves brings you Elevation2


==============================================================================


			  :::ELEVATE YOURSELF:::

 "PLUR stands for Peace, Love, Unity, and Respect. These four ideals are 
often touted as the elements that make raves more positive and life 
affirming than other kinds of parties or club scenes."


 Remember these words?  Dominic Paolombo put this on the back of the
flyers for Elevation. What is said here is true. Within these words, is
the whole reason why so many of us rave at all. It is what keeps us
doing what we do year after year, and is the reason for us uniting again
to gather under the stars and celebrate this joyous life.

 What was attmepted and achieved last August, was a precursor for things
to come. 

 So, November 16th 1996, we embark again into the great outdoors to
celebrate. We have kept the tradition and picked an incredible site in
the Los Angeles National Forest. I know a lot of you are talking about
cold, but I can tell you that this locale is only 1600 feet up, as
opposed to the last site of almost 4000 feet. There will not be any
snow. Although the temperatures will dip, just not as drastically as a
lot of people are thinking. 
 
 It still will be nippy out there, so don't be afraid to bring all your
warm rave gear.( Do they sell flouro triple fat goose;) WOOD FIRES will
be permitted!!! so the smorEs and techno-campsongs can ring throughout
the night!

*We have an eniter campsite for our use, so we can make the best of it!*

Observe and protect Mother Nature at all times. Let's make a good
exapmle and ensure that we can use sites such as this in the future. The
way that we are perceived is the way that we act. So be responsible, and
accountable. Pack it in, pack it out!

 We will be asking for a $5 donation per person to cover the costs of
the sound
system and reservations. We'll be serving free coffee all night long, as
well as free water, and a bread and fruit breakfast! Plus lots of other
free goodies as well--There is a little cafe' inside of the campground
that will be serving up other beverages and food as well, and a line-up
that I'm sure you'll all appreciate.

 The dj's are:

 Kc    (Dune)
 Tom Allain  (Sweet)
 Andy Kumeda (Elevation) with vocal accompaniment by Adrienne
(NoITuLove)
 And Breaking bread with the morning sun, its 
 DJ Brad (Mother Earth)

We also have Tonka sound this time, bringing the fattest stacks in LA.

 We'll release directions to the site a few days before the event. So
stay tuned to socal-raves, call the info line (714)224-9779 email our
automated response elevation@party.net   and check out our website
(still a few bugs) http://www.online-la.com/~jbondy 

 If you have any questions or suggestions regarding Elevation, you can
respond directly to this email.

 "As we open our minds and transcend our limits, we can explore beyond
the rave to discover new ideas and knowledge relevant to our lives and
dreams."

Spread the love on the 16th, and no meanies please!!!


Thanks, and I love all you guys!!!

Bondy..  J Bondy

Elevation2
an intimate celbration meant to enlight 
and unite those that care about our scene-

Um, excuse me!  I don't think we opened that up to a full-fledge,
why-not-complicate-matters-like-usual, "what should the SFR bumper sticker
be" contest.

You know it can't be that easy, gang.  =)

I say this only because I like this one better:

Ravers thump all night!

And so here we go...anyone else have an idea?

"I (Heart) Techno"
"Honk if you (Heart) Techno" - I think this one would be cool on a shirt 
:)

oh ya, these are modular...you can replace Techno with House or Goa or 
Jungle.  Maybe a hole series of bumber stickers?........

Gabber DJ's do it all night with 12Inches at 200+ BPMs....

     like a big bronze raver statue with space-age sunglassesand a big, 
     funky hat.  almost reminiscent to a parade float.  the rest of the

Okay, Tony Rotundo is right. I probably did open a can of bandwidth
clogging worms. My bad. Bad Pengo. No Glowstick.

So how bout this:

I've gotten all the ideas that people sent to the list already. If
anyone else has more phrases or whatever that they want, send them to me
as so we save the list a little breath. Just put 'Bumper Sticker' in the
subject. Then I'll send a full list to the people that sent sugestions
(If you don't have any ideas but want to get the final list. Send me a
note.) Then we can narrow down the idea list to the favorate from there.

Let's really try to keep this collaborative chaos from adding another
meg or two (well, mayber not THAT much) in the SFR archives. If all goes
well Steve Cooley says he *might* be able to design somethig today. If
not than I'll tug at Hughdhyana's shoulder as soon as the semester is
done.

There's already a 'programmers do it all night' bumper sticker and T shirt... 
not to be excessively whiny or anything.  In the spirit of positive thinking, I 
present these.
     
How about "Ravers do it without permits"
     
Ravers do it in dirty warehouses...
     
Ravers do it while the DJ spins... (nice visual)
     
Ravers do it with each other... (well...)
     
Ravers do it on the basement floor...
     
Ravers do it at a yet an undisclosed location...
     
Ravers do it somewhere else every night.
     
And my personal favorite:::::
     
Ravers do it underground.
     
     Peace,
     AndyW

Nice, but you forgot one:

17.  When you're 90 years old and sitting in an old folks home, your idea of 
a good friend is a person who let's you have the blue crayon when all that 
was left was the ugly brown one...

Had a blast.  Beautiful setting.  Beautiful people.  Thank you to Triple
Horn, and especially Avril for providing us with everything we needed and
for just being who she is.  The ambient area was moved inside due to sound
complaints from the neighbors, but the indoor space had couches and a fire
place, and was all around better as far as I was concerned.   I was pleagued
with gear problems for the first 1.5 hours of our set and had a strange time
because several times while I was freaking out because some piece of
electronica wasn't making any sound and to me the song sounded terrible to
me without it, someone would walk up and shake my hand and tell me it was
great or incredible or something like that.....and I had to thank them and
mean it.   Those interactions gave me the most odd feeling.  Then near the
end of the C-lab set, RE: went back on and mixed live stuff with records
with C-lab and just pretty much freestyled for a couple hours.  Felix joined
in on the decks as well, and that whole jam session just rocked.  We all had
so much fun.  I got to feel that synergy that can be created between live
musicians....which doesn't always happen when everything is played from
disk.  Mega fun.  Didn't spend very much time in the trace room because I
liked the couches in the other space.

heard, and not a whisper. Escape us for all our spouting, nor the
needle scratching upon this gramophone of the circular cosmic spot.
Hear me, mark me, learn me, throw the mind's ear open. Shut up the
mind's eye, all will be music. What sculpture of sound cannot, what
cannot as a fluid token words, that nothing else cannot."

Ravers shouldn't have to face injury, death or the fire marshall just so 
they can dance... but tearing down the Acme?  Isn't that building a 
historical landmark?  It's OLLDDDDDD, folks.  Brick - means it was built 
before the earthquake codes of post-1906.  Narrow hallways, high 
ceilings.  It's probably one of the original buildings of downtown San Francisco!!

I have a consuming passion for raving, but also a serious side 
fascination with history, interesting buildings, and where they converge: 
PRESERVATION!!  Save the Acme!  Let's turn it into a museum of raving ;).

To all the beautiful people who sent me birthday wishes, thank you so 
much!  I have lost all your messages (and, actually, EVERYTHING from Nov 
1 and 2) because the fucking server at my fucking work goes down 
constantly <bitch bitch>.  

But THANK YOU again, and I hope you all danced your asses off for me at 
Mantra, Karma, Nikita?!, or wherever you ended up that night.  I, for 
one, partook of an excellent meal and wine quite late and promptly fell 
asleep.  :P what a party animal!!

Interesting to see the analysis of little-girl sexuality in rave 
fashion... I suppose what is "taboo" (the sexual attractiveness of 
children) becomes what is most exciting to us...  That also accounts for 
the ever-alluring Catholic School Girl trope.

However, pigtails and Elmos always held a different meaning for me within 
the scene.  For me, it is a place to shed the constraints of "adulthood," 
with its seriousness and conformity, and rediscover the sacred place of 
childhood.  To find the "child within," the joyfulness at simply being, 
the ultimate pleasure in the present moment.  To be like a child, in that 
way, and to also return to a place where personal change is possible.  To 
make yourself anew with the optimism and joy and faith of a child, before 
cynicism and resignation corrupts it.

So I pull my hair back in pigtails and I sprinkle myself with glitter and 
Cookie Monster usually rides around with me - the costuming becomespart of 
the ritual of going back to Babyhood!

That is its meaning for ME - a direct result of an e-revelation.  I 
realize that for many others, rave fashion has different meaning.  
Whether it is the suggested sexuality of little-girl looks, or the 
oppressive hand of the fashion industry spoonfeeding alterna-culture to a 
huge market of teens (with cash!) <but that's a topic for another post>, 
"the baby look" means many things.

I sent the call out a while ago to all ravers in the immediate Berkeley 
area, and so far have six responses (TWO of whom are living outside the 
Bay Area and intend to return in a year!!)

So, are there only FOUR of us who would like to carpool from B-town (or 
North Oak, or Albanytown, or EC-town?)  

I know there are more desperate, carless ravers, and more car-owning, 
ride-giving ravers out there - so send me a note!

Berkeley or close by only
tell me:
neighborhood you live in
your phone number
whether you have a car

Thanks!!

love,

     say, that would be a good opportunity for one of those like hot dog 
     stand raves they were talking about last week.  10 dollars includes a 
     jumbo jack value meal...maybe someone should get with them.   I could 
     just see martin in there on the loudspeaker going "thanks all for 
     coming to the pahrty.  you may now go over to the ambient area for 
     your breakfast jacks.  say hi to someone.  meet someone new for the 
     first..."  well, you know the routine.  
     
     
     maybe a new boogie buffet location...
     "jack-in-the-boogie"
     or "boogie in the crack"
     
     maybe...
     
     maybe...

Well, you're close.

     Almost forgot... obviously pro-raving bumper stickers might seriously 
     decrease our ability to park anywhere near an illegal party (you know, 
     the good kind), should they actually be used on ravemobile bumpers.
     
     Stickers are generally good... Perhaps we should consider an 'unbumper 
     sticker', perfect for lunchboxes, binders, DJ crates, coffins, 
     clothing, naked flesh, stables, file cabinets and speaker cabinets 
     with explicit fine print discouraging actual bumper use.
     
     Or not.

     And from the cryptic memories department...
     All hail the bright and mighty Orange "DISCO" sticker.  Whose idea was 
     that anyway?  Simple, elegant, and oh so sexy under blacklight.

Peter-
I've been to spaz a few times, but that was probably almost two years ago,
down on 6th St. (lovely neighborhood, bring the kids,........NOT!).  I heard
they did something at Burning Man and Some kind of tour in Colorado and such,
but I haven't heard of anything in SF in a long time...  They did have good
music and *Live* techno which was really excellent.  Very small, cool vibee,
thought I.

looks like a class 3 request for divine vibrations in teh third 
dimention, captain, coming in thru Earths physical manifestation of teh 
crystal grid.

yes, data, but what can be done?

the acceleration of earths assention into the forth dimention in 
jons perscieved position in the universe allows a 
breif but precise pulsation to be made manifest into his time, 
should he be capable to resonate to that pulsation, healing will be 
inevitable. 

is there any danger in it?

entering calculations....  ...the crystal grid can hold the transmission 
w/o any dissonant vibrations. 

excelent. make it so.

After you have registered to vote (and you would have had to register by 
a certain deadline) you are then sent a voter pamphlet and on it by your 
address is the address of your polling place.

I'm groovin' on Andy's ideas (attached below)

#1 - I don't have a car! (but I have a bicycle that loves small stickers)

#2 - Smaller stickers are good for sticking everywhere and anywhere

#3 - I love stickers/posters where u see a symbol and you're thinking -
What in hell does that mean? - a la the magical mushroom campaign underway
around San Francisco (is that for Mushroom Jazz? or something uniquely
bizarre?)

#4-10 - all the other things that Andy said.

Large or small, I would definitely throw in some green to support the
fruition of this project.  Will also investigate the cheapest place to get
stickers printed (bumper vs non-bumper), unless someone is already hooked
up on this aspect of the idea.

No tear it down , the building is unsafe, many a party have i mused that if
The Big One
came while we were raving insit=d of that place (or just a mundane old
fire) we'd all be
off to raver heaven. As long as it's standing people will be tempted to use
it.

 Yes, but unfortunately there are many people out there, like me, who
did not get this packet. It was in the local paper here and the same thing
happened last year. A computer error is to blame. Damn computers;).
   Ann- try looking in the phone book under the Gov't pages under voter
registeration. Good luck:).

hello all fellow ravers, geels, democrats, republicans, greens,
liberatarians, and anyone i forgot to mention-

in honor of of voting day, (and just because i feel like it) i'm inviting
everybody to a tuesday afternoon lunch in south park.  over the past couple
of weeks, new and different ravers have been meeting somewhere in multimedia
gulch for lunch, good chatting, and playing with various toys (for those of
us who don't get enough of that at work).  so far, the groups have been
intimate, the talk varied, the politics ..., well, you know.

today, lunch is at:

the corner of 3'rd street and townsend (in the beautiful south of market in
lovely san francisco) at the "pallette cafe and deli".

when:

well, today!  more specifically, at noon till whenever you need to leave (i
just camp out there and work, but that's me!).

what:

good food, vegan, vegetarian, and carnivore friendly.  a various assortment
of sandwhiches, pitas, fallafels, and other stuff with a distinctly eastern
european flare!


so, if you wanna come, why don't you get back to me by e-mail (
mailto:mdpkl@best.com ) or phone (there's no phoneto: protocol yet,
unfortunately!  415-777-9901  and ask for matt).


come!  eat!  enjoy a beautiful south park day!  and vote!!!!!


i love you all, and hope you have a wonderful, loving day-

Hello I am new to this list and the San Francisco area and I wanted to 
get advice about good parties clubs featuring good inteligent jungle and 
ambient music.  I am not a fan of most trance or house but prefer artists 
like Richard James, Goldie, Underworld, and Beaumont Hannant.  Where can 
I go to hear DJ's play this kind of music?

I am planning on going to see the Chemical Bros. and A Guy Called Gerald, 
DJ Octagon (Thansgiving rave -forgot the name) and would like to hook up 
with others going to these events.

Thanks

Damon

I don't think I got the normal voter packet....

However, I did get a mailer from the League of Women Voters, and their
computer inserted my polling place on the front ...s o check your election
miscellaneous mail for your polling place...

and if that doesn't work ... go next door and ask your neighbor or go to
the nearest school/govt building and you have a good chance of finding a
polling place, and if it's not yours, they might know which is!

I just get the impression that a *lot* of people shouting PROP 215! PROP

My thoughts exactly ... remember, our friends in blue read your bumper
stickers too, and you increase your chances of being pulled over or picked
out of the crowd .... so those of you whose car says "only users lose
drugs" on the rear end, now you know why you keep getting pulled over!

I'd love a mini-sticker or patch that I could put on my  pack!

Hi, all!  I've been in lurk mode for awhile but I just have to pipe in 
 w/my $.02.

I kinda like small stickers and my personal preference is to keep any 
 sexual innuendo out of it.  I  like easily recognizable logos so you 
 can see it far away.  A reflective base helps, too.  Provided this 
 isn't trademarked, the heart in a silhouetted house symbol similiar to 
 the flag that used to fly at Sunsets (did they put it up this year?) 
 is nice and simple.  It can also confuse many people who think it's a 
 family values ad campaign (home is in the heart)...Perhaps we could 
 add a twist of creating a "techno" symbol (sin wave?) within the heart 
 ('cause w/o technology, the music wouldn't resonate w/in us quite the 
 same way).  I also like the idea of not just a familiar symbol but 
 making it look like an official parking permit so when we do go out, 
 perhaps parking enforcers might think twice before ticketing (yeah, 
 right...at least it won't stick out and say "Pull me over and check me 
 out, I'm a raver!").  So you could have the logo and "Good thru 2012" 
 permit from the "Universal Groove Honor Society" (acronym is UGH!).

Okay, so I'm a little out there, but I just wanted to add my ideas to 
 the thought bank.

Cheers!
Diane

Well, this Saturday the 9th, there will be a rave in Sacramento (1.5 hrs
from SF), and RE: and Astronout (both live ambient electronic bands from the
list) will be playing live and dj'ing ambient/idm in the ambient room all
night.  Live is all created by us, and I use RDJ, and Beaumont, Autechre,
Photek, Orbital and other electronic wizards in my dj sets as well.

It's called Synesthesia, and the number is (415) 273-1190.

There will also be some drum and bass in the dance room as well, but not all

true, but it's the first step.  the proposition states that sic people like
cancer patients can GROW there own doobage.  how will the police know if you
or i are not cancer patients when they see our ten foot plants in our
backyards?  as the law stands now,  the police can disrupt our peace if they
merely happen to see our plants or if a fu*kkked up neighbor decides to
report us. so, although the prop was not created directly for us, it allows
us the space and freedom to GROW.

PFIQ, the world's only magazine dedicated exclusively to body piercing,
is
currently working on a cyber issue. We want to interview and photograph
pierced ravers, multimedia experts, internet junkies, bike messengers,
zippies, and any other relevant people. We want to explore the area
where
piercing meets and blends with the ever expanding internet community. Do
your piercings connect you to home and your humanity, are you using your
piercings as one more way to distance yourself from boring reality, or
do
you have another philosophy about the connection? Whatever your take, we
want to hear what you think! For more information, please contact
michaela@gauntlet.com
or phone 415-552-0505 x107. We pay for the professional photography and
you'll get contributor's copies of the issue.

That's too bad. It's abuses like this that would get Prop 215 repealed
or challenged in court, should it pass. Yes, Patrick had an excellent
point: the measure is to support marijuana as a *medicine* for people
who need it. This is not a measure for everyone to support so they can
go smoke out.

"Hey, officer, I have cancer, I need to grow this stuff...*wink*
*wink*" I can see it now. It's only a matter of time before CBC would
get busted again.

If you *really* want to have a law to support marijuana for general
use, then make your own ballot proposition for next the election
decriminalizing possession. I'm sure you could get one million
Californians to sign a petition for that ;)

I'm still voting for 215. It sucks to be sick and suffering.

And this type of deception is what will lead to a call for a repeal of the
Proposition. Prop 215 is really a great idea. Legalization for everyone
else is a good idea. But as seperate and distinct issues. If people misuse
215 so they can smoke out and get caught, the people that this Prop is
supposed to help, that is Aids patients, Cancer patients, etc. will
suffer as the Prop is repealed.

This has to be short and sweet - the boss is due back any sec.  So, a 
rundown on the most important issues (for me):

PREZ
This one's a toss-up: a last-minute decision made in the booth, I'm 
sure.  Torn between Ole Boy Bill (would have to hold my nose on that 
one), Ralph for the anti-globalization message, Marcia for the totally 
idealistic, socialist values message, and even Ross for the 
what-the-fuck-are-we-doing-with-this-fucking-deficit message.  Thank bob 
that Dole is SO far behind that we have the luxury of choosing between 
alternatives, and are not so chained to the "lesser-of-two-evils" type of 
choice we usually have.  BUT I'll check the exit polls before I vote to 
make sure Clinton is winning in Cal before even considering the 
"throw-away" alternate-party vote.  Remember, whoever takes Cali. wins.

Prop 209
Gee, wouldn't it be wonderful to have a color-blind, gender-equal society 
where there is no discrimination and everyone has the exact same life 
opportunities?  Unfortunately folks, we ain't there yet!  VOTE NO.  This 
one eradicates such awful things as extra tutoring, special efforts at 
recruitment, and other programs aimed at welcoming those historically 
excluded in higher ed and employment.  Don't forget the pernicious, 
obscure "Clause C":  women may be discriminated against for causes 
"reasonable and necessary to their gender": i.e. going back to the days 
of barring women from "dangerous" (and high-paying) occupations because 
they might someday get pregnant, not having to build facilities for women 
(like the notorious no-women's bathrooms in our State Capitol until the 
late '70's!!!)

Prop 215
Compassionate use of marijuana to treat people who are suffering.  This 
one is cake.  The ones opposed to this are the moral majority types who 
feel marijuana is evil (though, for some hypocritical reason, other more 
dangerous drugs to fight pain are just dandy!).  I know I've seen every 
last one of you smoking bowls in the chill room - VOTE YES.


I'd love to go through the others, but guess what!  Here's Boss Man.  
Gotta run.

Please vote.  We get a chance to have a say on some crucially important 
issues.  No, this may not change the world, but a lot of these measures 
will impact real people greatly.  Do it.  Thanks.

Hi everyone,

Last night I got the chance to go to Mad for the first time in months and
months.

It was insanely  great!  

I got there when Joe Rice was playing, and then Tim McKnew went on.  He
started off really trippy, with some slower stuff, and then he settled
into a serious techno set that MADE ME DANCE.  Later on, Monty played and
he did the same thing to me.  I'm so glad I got to hear him play at last! 

It was mighty fine to see lots of friends for the first time since FnF.
Such as Leslie, little Tod, Jonas, Maya the irrepresible (this lady has
energy to spare!), and of course, the Mad crew, who can be counted on to
show us all a good time.  The visuals were awesome, Alex!

Thanks for a perfect Monday night,

Ann

Personal knowledge:
There are currently only eight people who have been granted the ability to
smoke marijuana by the fenderal government.  They are in a special program
which has not been advertised very much where they are allowed to purchase
marijuana pre-manufactured in cigarrette in tins containing 300 marijuana
cigarrettes. The marijuana is cultivated in federally sponsered and
maintained sites.  I don't know what the name of this program is, but I
know that there are surely more than 8 people in the entire USA who could
benefit from the usage of marijuana and I wonder why this specific program
has received very little press.  I'd more liek to leave it in the hands of
the doctors.  Besides, if there's a little side business going on, WHO
CARES.

>From the California Ballot Pamphlet

Quote:

Prop 215: Medical Use of Marijuana

Initiative Statute, Put on the Ballot by Petition Signatures

Summary
Exempts from criminal laws patients and defined caregivers who possess or
cultivate marijuana for medical treatment recommended by a physician.
Provides physicians who recommmend use shall not be punished.  Fiscal
Impact: Probably no significant fiscal impact on state and local
governments.

YES vote:
A YES vote on this measure mean: Persons with certain illnesses (and their
caregivers) could grow or possess marijuana for medical use when
recommended by a physician.  Laws prohibiting the nonmedical use of
marijuana are not changed.

NO vote:
A NO vote on this measure means: Growing or possessing marijuana for any
purpose (including medical purposes) would remain illegal.

PRO:
Marijuana can relieve pain suffering in serious illnesses like cancer,
glaucoma and AIDS.  Proposition 215 permits patients to use marijuana, but
only if they have the approval of a licensed physician.  Tight controls
limiting marijuana to patients only will remain in place.  Cancer doctors
and nurses groups support 215.

CON:
Proposition 215 legalizes marijuana.  Vote no.  It allows people to grow
and smoke marijuana for stress or "any other illness."  No written
presciption or examination is reqired, even children can smoke pot legally.
The American Cancer Society rejects smoking marijuana for medical purposes
and no major doctor's organization supports 215.

This sounds exactly like what happend with the San Francisco CBC.  If
they were running a tighter ship, AIDS and cancer patients would
still probably be able to get their medicine there.

Chances are, even after 215 passes, anyone caught growing pot will probably
still get arrested and have to go to court.  It is here that, if it is
determined that you have a valid doctor's recomendation for growing,
prop 215 will help you out.  If your doctors recommendation does not
stand up in court, you will go to jail.

I agree with Black Adder... the whims of recreational pot smokers should not
interfere with the legal process of getting pot to those whose lives depend on
it.

i encourage everyone to vote for 215.  if it doesn't pass though,
it will be the authors' own fault for wording it too loose for
the average voter to swallow.  no written prescription needed?
no age limit?  no defined set of illnesses?  owing to political
realities they should have made 215 much tighter.  it's better
to take a small step in the right direction and succeed than to take a 
big step and fail (for example, clinton's original health care plan).
are the voters going to be asked again in 1998?  2000?  how many
initiative campaigns can these people afford to run?

if it does pass (knock on wood) then it will probably end up in
court asap, and the courts will clarify prescriptions, age limits,
etc.  look at prop 187.  it passed (by a large majority) but
it was DOA in the courts.  the same thing could happen to 215.

word to the zealots.

Subject: Let me tell you about my weekend {NRR}
Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

Sunday afternoon I was chilling in my room listening to Bob Marley and
watering the geraniums when I heard this guy on the street hooting and
hollering, screaming "You sonofabzzzt, I'm gonna kick your motherfluffing
be-hind when I get my hands on you!  You damn motherphuffer..."  and on and
on.  The dude was shaking his fist in the air, red in the face like he was
fixing to bust an artery, shouting up to one of the windows of my apartment
building.

After ten minutes of this business,  I popped open the window and said,
"Hey, Mac, what the Sam Hill is the matter wichoo?  I'm sitting here trying
to catch that Sunday morning vibe with Bob Marley, and you're straight out
busting my scene!  What's up with that, yo?"

But the cat didn't even listen, he just kept on hootin and hollerin,
frothing at the mouth and turning purple in the face like it was coming
back in style.

Finally, I went over to the kid in the room next door, this nerdy guy who's
always studying and keeping to himself.

"You know this guy out there?"  I asked.  The kid had never seen the guy
before, but he, too was fixing to have a nervous breakdown, on account of
the guy outside was disrupting his studying.

So I went upstairs and banged on the door of Icky and Thumper, these two
punkrockers who live above me.  Punkrockers are always causing trouble; I
thought maybe they'd been messing with this guy outside.  Well, Icky and
Thumper were as clueless as ever, but they were blasting their music,
trying to drown out the maniac's voice.

Old Lady Milktoast on the third floor, she didn't know the guy either, but
she was nervous as a long-tailed cat in a room full of rocking chairs,
pacing back and forth in her room, praying the guy would just leave.  And
let me tell you, we could still here the guy screaming from up there:  "You
got-dam motherphuffer, I'm-a gonna put my foot so far up your arse, you'll
be flossing your teeth with my bootlaces!  You motherphuffing sonofabzzzt!"

Naturally, I was a bit embarassed in front of old Mrs. Milktoast, what with
all this bad language, so I was settled to resolve this matter once and for
all.   "Boomerang,"  said she,  "Please try to do something about this
horrible man with his sinful language!  I would call the police, but you
know how they are with old people."

"Don't you worry, Old Lady Milktoast,"  said I with confidence.   "I have a
notion that someone on the top floor is the object of this scallawag's
rantings.  You make yourself a hot cup of tea to settle your nerves, and
let the Boomerang  handle this."

So up the creaky stairs I trudged, and at the top of the stairs I banged on
the door.  The door was at once yanked open, almost tearing it from the
hinges, and I was looking face to face with what I swore was the devil
himself.  He was a gnarly, fat old greaseball with blackened teeth and bugs
in his beard, his eyes were wild and seething as if he had spent the
weekend on a methamphetamine bender.   He growled and yanked me by the
collar, ripping open my new shirt and dragging me into the kitchen.

He kicked over the trashcan and grabbed a handful of soggy coffeegrounds,
which he shoved into my mouth and down my throat.  I struggled to escape
and tried to scream, but the coffee grounds made it impossible to do
anything but groan.  The guy then grabbed a jug on liquid dish soap, ripped
off my trousers and squirted the dishsoap up my bum, and as finally insult,
slapped me in the face and threw me out the window, into the trash dumpster
below.

I climbed out of the dumpster and started shaking my fist in the air and
screaming at the top of my lungs,  "You sonofabzzt!  I'm-a gonna kick your
motherphuffing arse when I get my hands on you!  You got-dam..."

Dear SFRavefriends,

	Of course I meant to put out a complete list days ago, but simply
didn't get around to it.  For those who may be undecided and haven't voted
yet, here's a few more brief thoughts (partly in response to Nancy's)...

My computer tells me that on Tue, 5 Nov 1996, Nancy Shaw shared:

	The only way you "throw away" your vote is by voting for someone
you don't really support, the "lesser of two evils," etc.  Perot is right
about this -- don't waste your vote!
	In practical terms, your one vote is NOT NOT NOT going to decide
who our next President is!  All you're doing is adding to a total.  Add to
a smaller (third party) total, and your vote makes a bigger proportional
difference.  It's that simple.
	And of course I urge you to support Harry Browne/Jo Jorgensen on
the Libertarian ticket.  Many reasons too detailed to go into here, but a
few pertaining to ravers:  
	-Browne/Jorgensen believe doing drugs should be a personal choice,
		not a law.
	-They support an end to licensing and permit laws that prevent
		many good parties from happening and result in busts of many 
		others.
	-Browne/Jorgensen would establish individual non-government
		retirement plans and stop taking young people's money for a 
		Social Insecurity system that is going to be bankrupt

Opponents of Prop. 209 never want to talk about the actual language of the
measure.  Contrary to media-led belief, it would *not* outlaw affirmative
action in California, only racial and gender preferences by the
government.  Anyone else would be free to keep these preferences, and even
the government would still be allowed to have affirmative action programs
that are based on factors such as socioeconomic status.  
	Clause C is a red herring, most legal experts agree.  It is
designed to allow things like same-sex searches at prisons and airports,
where a perfectly gender-free law might allow a woman to get searched by a
man, for example.  It is not "pernicious" and certainly not "obscure";
Prop. 209 is one of the most straightforward-written measures to appear on
the ballot.  Check it out for yourself.
	I hope you vote yes on 209 and yes for an end to racism.

I hope we can all agree on this one!  Vote YES!  And come to the Prop. 215
election party at 8pm tonight at the Cannabis Buyer's Club, 1444 Market
St.  Your voting stub is your ticket.

	Along with the above measures, Prop. 218 is the most critical thing on 
the ballot, imho.
	During the 18 years since California's last major tax reform
(Proposition 13), politicians have found numerous loopholes which allow
them to raise your taxes without your consent by calling them "assessment
districts," "fees," and so on.  
	By carefully avoiding the word "tax" to describe what clearly are
new taxes, government lawyers have managed to subvert the intent of the
law and undermine the democratic process in this state.
	Proposition 218 will close these tax loopholes by requiring a
majority of voters to approve increases in general taxes, and by requiring
that new fees and charges imposed on property owners first be submitted
for their approval.
	Failure to pass 218 will leave the door open for current and
future politicians to increase the tax burden at will, with a potentially
devastating impact on all of us.  The ability of families and
individuals to pay for necessities like food, housing, and health care, as
well as the little things we all hope to enjoy such as vacations, rave
parties, and visits to libraries, zoos, and museums are in jeopardy if 218
goes down. 
	Please vote YES on 218!

	On a similar note, a vote for any bond measure is the same as a
vote to raise your taxes -- in fact worse.  Bonds have to be paid back by
the taxpayers, with interest, to the investors who buy them.  Everything
paid for by bond is more expensive than it would be otherwise.  It's the
same as buying on credit with money you don't have.

	Final note:  When in doubt, vote against the incumbent!  And
remember, a vote for any third party candidate is better than a vote for a
Republican or Democrat if you want to see a change in the status quo.

	I'm not going to tell you to go out and vote.  That's up to you,
and if you don't want to vote, I'm sure you have a logical and reasonable
reason for feeling that way.  In fact it is your civil liberty NOT to
vote!  Furthermore, if you plan on voting differently than myself, I would
just as soon you did stay home!  ;)

Much love,

	I don't mean to be pedantic or anything, but remember that
Bill Clinton *has* cut the deficit more than in half since he took office!
I know it's not cool for underground-raver types to embrace mainstream
politicians, but I do think that  Clinton is the best president we've 
ever had.   Okay, enough shameless pro-Clinton babbling... :)

Here's the start ofa newe movement:

	If you think your vote doesn't matter, vote anyway!  Just write 
yourself in for all the offices and vote no on all the propositions (or 
don't vote at all on the propositions).  That way, when the votes are 
tallied and percentages are calculated, the candidates scores will be 
smaller since they are calculated out of a larger number of total votes.  

		# votes for Candidate A
                -----------------------  X 100% =  percent of vote
      		Total # of votes in

It would show the mainstream public that the winner really only won from 
a few votes.  This would remind them that their vote does really matter.

			I voted for myself for two officesthis year.  :)

	Or better yet, find a lawyer who will take tthis case and file a
lawsuit against the federal government for breach of your rights under
whatever previous court decisions are applicable and rights granted by 
the bill of rights and the rest of the constituion. Bring into the court 
the fact that the founders of this country smoked pot and that the reason 
it has been illegalized is not due to health reasons but for political 
gain. Then make legal proceedings against the FDA for not verifying the 
so called harmful effects of scheduled substances before scheduling them.

	This issue is a pretty good reflection of how much we trust one 
another these days (well, ok, I admit you can contort anything to make it 
a good "reflection" of your own point, this may be the case here, you 
decide). No American in their right mind is going to let their neighbor 
lose with a whole bunch of drugs, hell, we cannot let them take care of 
their own lawns let alone their own beliefs or even their own kids. No 
one is willing to trust anyone anymore in sura, so why should anyone 
be acountable for their own actions?

What do you recommend this coming weekend? There are some parties
going on, and I can't possibly go to all of them. So what should
I pick? These are my options I guess...

SMILES on Friday. Well, what can I say? Carlos is the only DJ I've ever
heard of (please keep in mind that I'm not from SF), and I'm not even
sure I like him.
2ND CHAKRA on Saturday. Jeno & Garth head to head on 4 turntables?
Sounds interesting. But the rest of the party? Tarot cards? Acupuncture?
Herbal Clinics? Healings? What the hell is this? Do I really want to
pay $18 to go to some health fair with a soundtrack? Probably not.

And then there's 2012, That Girl Mona, [future primitive soundsession 2],
Club Biptut (in Sactown), and some other parties too I guess. Any
recommendations?

reespect, jonas

I don't really know if excessive abuse or whatever of what 215 would
cause a repeal of it. After all, how many people use all those 5' water
bongs and metal pipes for tobacco? And thoes remain legal (in

If you want to know everything there is to know about Prop 215 (well, just 
about), go to http://www.prop215.org/
or specificly
http://www.prop215.org/faq215.html

for information about where the propotion came from, why it was deemed to 
be necessary, who it protects, how it protects them, rulings on use of 
pot for medical purposes, political beuracosy within the DEA.... etc... 
It was in the election materials you may or may not have gotten...

In general, prop 215 is not going to help get pot or any other drug
legalized for recreational use. That fight is going to be a long hard one.
It is one that must do two things, I would think - first, it must show
that the basis of the current drug war is not because of properities
inherient in the effects of the the drugs themselves, but instead the at
the basis was for Nixon's political gain, and that what he started has
snowballed out of control (see the book, Smoke and Mirrors" I forget the
author, I heard an interview with him on NPR).  Secondly, and more
importantly, the war against the drug war must show that drugs are not a
threat to "american" values whatever those are (and if we want to be
techincal as I assume we would, the founders of this country whose words
the courts try to interrept and keep alive, had smoked pot and believed in
personal freedoms, look at their speeches, look at their documents, look
at what they were fighting AGAINST, and I wonder how our current
government might compare with the monarchy of the Britisih Empire of those
days)... 

	So whose ready to go tell their parents, coworkers, children, and
friends that they use drugs? Who is ready to take a stance for what they
believe, or do you really believe it? Who is ready to work through all the
shit that may fall upon you in order to deprogram a nation that has had no
facts, no evidence for that last 16 years that drugs are indeed horrible,
harmful things, but has taken such beliefs to heart (or at least that is
their public stance)? But then, maybe that will not happen.  The more I
travel through this country the more surprised I am to see that as long as
you have your shit together, people do not care what you do, but if you
step over the line and drop your shit on someone else's doorstep of
perception (maybe a better way to explain this in the wise words of a Mr.
Abel, "He was interfering with my experience"), that person is not going 
to be happy about it..

Yay...

just now I had the pleasure of voting YES on 215!  

what it joy it was to vote my heart.  

a couple of years ago a fellow graduate student asked my assistance in
finding some marijauna for an old man who was dying of cancer.  that
experience more than anything else has made me wish that marijauna were
legal.

the underground network for distributing pot for recreational use works
just great, provided you know who to contact when you want some.  but if
you are old, or infirm, or if you don't know anyone who might help you
find it, it is very hard to make the right connection.

if it passes, do you think it will help the cbc leaders (dennis peron, and
others) with their upcoming court cases?  

much respect,

ann

Now, at first, I was very very quiet about this whole issue.  Even going 
so far as to stay out of the fray of this particular issue.

In short Starchild, you have not been discriminated against, and the 
proponents of 209 are the worse sort of people.  I'm glad that you're 
right in there with Helms, thurmond and Duke, all great white leaders.  
ANway unless one of you can show me a case where there was a qualified 
white replaced by a less qualified minority, I would say that this entire 
campaign is nothing but a wedge issue.

It has been over 400 years since my people were brought here as slaves, a 
great social experiment.  Deny the option to read for some 200 years, 
then deny the option to vote for some 350 or so, deny opportunites to 
blacks, women and others for centuries, perfrom the worse sort of 
genocide against the native cultures, and then after a GENERATION of 
corrective measures (restitiution some might say), you wan to say the 
playing feild is level.  Sir, get out of school and find a job, for 
discrimination is very real in the workplace, it is not a matter of 
academia or philiophical deabte.  People are being redlined, and people 
are beign shut out, all because of the color of thier skin.

Please get yourself up to date about the present lawsuit with Texaco for 
proof positive. 

A vote for 209 is a vote for continued racism.. Stop racism...remeber, 
you too will one day be a minority.  time to start looking at the longer 
range when, maybe, just maybe, you might need help as a underepresented 
minority.  Yes, it is happening, see the census.  Look out for the future 
and vote AGAINST the RACIST 209.

NO on 209, NO on 209, NO ON 209!


NO ON 209!!!!!

Ward Connerly <- sell out
Pete Wilson   <- suck out
David Duke    <- ass out

No ON 209, NO ON 209, NO ON 209.....


Now it's time for inteeligent debate.

As Malcolm X said about JFK "...the chickens came home to roost".

Out,
John S.

     They (bongs, pipes, papers, grunge off, head shops) only stay legal 
     because a segment of the population can play the game of... civil 
     liberty warfare.
     
     Part of civil liberty warfare is staying cool.  They say, that's a pot 
     pipe, I say, no... this is my pipe for smoking Earl Grey Tea.  My 
     religion supports me smoking earl grey at tea time.  Would you like to 
     talk to my lawyer?
     
     I don't mind if by carrying around a 6' bong I fuck it up for the 
     non-cannabis herb smokers of the world, but prop 215 is a different 
     story.
     
     If you're not sick with glaucoma, cancer, undergoing chemo or 
     radiotherapy, or starting to experience full blown AIDS symptoms, you 
     should not abuse the 215 name.  If it wins, it's a victory for 
     medicine, it's a victory for the legalization movement, but if 
     everybody busts out with the kind and starts snapping bongloads on 
     Market St, there's going to be a really negative public backlash.  I'd 
     hate to lose this for the sick because some fuckups want to get high 
     and claim they have a ticket to ride because of 215.
     
     I agree with whoever said CBC got shut down because of people who were 
     never intended to be there (kids, bunk notes, multiple caregivers for 
     one patient).  This is a somber occasion... people are DYING and we're 
     working on making medicine available for them.
     
     I guess what I'm asking everybody to do is work on seeing this for 
     what it is.
     
     If you haven't worked with people who are terminally ill, perhaps you 
     wouldn't understand.  My friend Chris passed away recently, and I used 
     to bring him 'free samples'... It was part "make a wish foundation" 
     (he really liked being stoned) and part pain relief (or at least he'd 
     forget it hurt).  It was really amazing though.  He was a stoner 
     before he got sick, and I'm sure he's a stoner now wherever he is.  I 
     did what I did, not out of profit or pity, but because I felt that 
     getting stoned with him sweetened both our lives as his time of 
     passing came.  It meant so much to him.  I didn't know him that well, 
     but I'm glad I met him, and I'm glad I could help him.  I learned a 
     lot.  I think about that and that's how I envision compassionate use.
     
     I wish we could get away from our own needs, and concentrate on the 
     issue.  Please don't use 215 as an excuse to use, possess, or 
     cultivate marijuana unless you are sick or a caregiver (I'm currently 
     neither).  If you choose to be part of the movement to legalize it, 
     contact NORML.
     
     Be discrete, informed and keep your head on straight.  You are a 
     walking advertisement for your beliefs and opinions.  Talk to those 
     that almost understand.  Don't fall into the "hey dude let's party" 
     stereotype.  We've been having our civil liberties taken for us to the 
     point that we can't use certain medicines on our selves when we're 
     sick or just plain in the mood for it (one of the safest drugs known 
     to mankind might I add).
     
     So when you're toking tonite, or this weekend at a party, think about 
     what it would be like to know that those who need it more than you 
     might have a chance to enjoy without persecution.  That's what you 
     voted for, and it's one of the coolest, nicest things I can think of.  
     If you want that right too, read, act, discuss, and prepare to give to 
     the cause.  Cypress Hill won't do it for you....
     
     Peace,
     AndyW

Up until World War I, TOTAL taxes (Fed, State, Local, etc) totalled less
than
10% of GNP.  At the end of World War II total taxes had reached 20% of
GNP.  As recently as 1969, total taxes were 30% of GNP.  Total taxes are
now close to 40% of GNP!

This means that if taxes today were what they were at the end of WWII -
we
could have 3 days off EVERY weekend, WITH NO CUT IN PAY!  No wonder
our parents/grandparents could afford to buy a  house, car and send
their
kids to college with only 1 wage earner!  Pretty soon we'll have to
start having
more kids and send them off to work instead of school just to pay our
taxes.....

Your Libertarian thought for the day.....

Right-
	So I am going up to Seattle for around the new year and was going 
to bring a system up with me. So, I am looking for contacts up there for 
doing a party.... Need help with space and lights and stuff like that, 
probably for New Years.... Any takers monitoring this list?

Well my roommate had an excellent reason for voting no on 215, a rather
serious consideration that I had never even thought of with regards to this
prop.  I said "So!  What are you voting on 215?"  He says "Oh, I'm voting
against it."  I said "Oh yeah?  How come?  Why would you care if dying
people get high, especially if it helps increase their appetites/decrease
pain?"  He says "Well, I didn't really read up on that one, but I figure if
it's currently illegal, it must be illegal for a reason."  & off he went to
the polls.

???

I hope to god nobody here (and I assume not, you're all way more informed
than my roommate it seems) votes on *anything* based on *that* line of
reasoning.

I really don't get it.  It's 7.09 now and Clinton has already won.  But
the polls here have just closed.  If you live in Hawaii then your votes
won't get in until 2.00am EST time.  So, therefore, everyone who voted
after 4pm PST time in the Presidential election effected the outcome of
hte election in no way what-so-ever.  That means that (if my sums are
coreect!) only 3 of every fou8r votes cast in the Presedential election
acctually counted.  Bearing in mind that only about 60% of the electorate
voted in the first place, this means that only 20% of the total votes
casted in this election accctually counted for electoral college votes.
In short, 20% of the US population decide who is hte leader of the most
powerful country in the world.  Any system that permits this to happen is
fucked, fucked, fucked.  You know what I mean.

What would be the best party to go to this month [the best party to 
travel five crusty hours for]?
Something that would be a really good first for my friends who have never 
been to an underground party in SF.(Their perception of SF is somewhat 
tainted by bad experiences)
thinking about a Wrinkle in Time but its kindof out of my budget league. 
But maybe I'll go regardless.
Does anyone have any suggestions?

I too have stayed out of the fray, until now...

You are making assumptions John. Unless you know Starchilds entire life
story, it is impossible for you to make the determination if Starchild has
ever in his life has been discriminated against, by whom, and what for.
And to keep things in perspective it is important to note that *OPPONENTS*
of 209 paid for David Duke to come speak against 209. This shallow stunt
gives the appearance to the uninformed that proponents of 209 are racist.
Once you can easily label a group racist it is much easier and popular to
decry their position. It is just not right.

You are absolutely correct John. People are being shut out of jobs because
of the color of their skin. For instance, persons seeking jobs in the
Dept. of Corrections are given extra points on tests if they are of certain 
national origins. And not suprisingly the system is beginning to actually
backfire, as quotas are met for some ethnic groups and not for others,
locking qualified individuals of what are traditionally minority
groups out of jobs. 

I also remember hearing a while back that Asian-Americans were being
denied admission to UC Berkeley because other minority groups were
under-represented and the Asian community was over-represented. Gee that's
fair, huh?

Racism of the caliber displayed is indefensible and will I am sure be
dealt with accordingly. It is however, wholly inappropriate to offer this
as indicitive of how professionals in every Fortune 500 country think.
That would be sterotyping, wouldn't it? Hmm, sterotyping is a lot like
racism isn't it?

You have done absolutely nothing to illustrate why 209 is racist. The
current system is what is racist.

It is rather amusing that you decry racism, and then quote a racist.

Well, they claimed that they would have up to the minute updates of
election results. Here I sit, listening to a Real Audio broadcast, which
included the concession speech by Bob Dole and Jack Kemp, and they don't
even have *any* results for the Pres. election, let alone updates on what
really matters, the Props. *sigh* 

Why is it that whenever large  "events" are planned for the Internet, the
planners always fail to deliver due to lack of bandwidth, computer
crashes, etc?

Oh well....

Hi,

just wanted to let you know that quoting a long article and then adding one
little line is bad netiquette.  It wastes bandwidth and doesn't stimulate
any positivity.  If you want to reply then just state your reply and leave
out the long quote, we know what you are talking about because we just read
the origido not need to see the whole thing over again.

Thanks,

Yes yes yes yes yes yes oh yes...

I just heard on the radio (California report, NPR) that 

Prop 215 has passed!!!!!!!!!!!!

As I filled in that particular square, I felt a little thrill go through
me...

I could just feel it..that it would pass! 


I can't wait to read the papers tomorrow, full up with quotes from Dennis
Peron (cannibis buyer's club founder)...hopefully.

And next month's issue of High Times ought to be interesting, too.

respect,

Ann

Nah, if you're gonna go independent, vote Shub Niggurath or Yog

I know what you mean but anyone that hadn't voted should still get out and
vote as there are other issues besides the presidency like state props and
local measures so you should still vote.

And yes the system should be changed...the media seemed to pick up on this
oddity this year.  Some decided not to air exit polls and such ad closed
and I think this is a step in the right direction.  But I also think
electoral votes should be given in proportion to the vote for each state
and not an all or none vote like it is today.

Nonetheless I am just one soul in this world of billions...but my vote
still counts! I think :)

	Though one could go out and get any old reflective sticker and
stick it up high so that people could caravan more easily on the

could be an easy marker that you are in the right place...

seems a bit strange to me that a community which passes 215 would also
pass 209... 

being pro-legalization implies a significant social-liberal lean to me,
which is not reflected by the election results.  
 
hmmm...

 but then, there's also the libertarians....

Sorry, dear, the majority of voters vote from emotion, not education.
Unfortunately...

I'm sad now.  209 looks like it's passing.  The biggest deception given to
Californians besides Prop 13.  Civil Rights Initiative, my ass.  Hmm...
the one thing we'll get out of this is affirmative action for white males.
Oops, I forgot, we already have that...  

*much sarcasm*

affirmative action doesn't mean less qualified.  high test scores aren't
the only indicator of "qualified".  we ain't colorblind.  heard about the
Texaco scandle?  case in point.  

still waiting for the day when I receive more compliments on my brain than
my looks....  but, no, we're not a sexist society anymore..

I think that taht is a really good idea...until a cop shines his light
into a parking lot and  a million little starts starts winking back at
him!...but actually...probably just a few cars would actually have it and
it would be useful! I also like the patch idea...i wanna neato patch for
my backpack (whine whine)....I also agree with whoever said that they like
the idea of a bumper sticker  without the sexual innuendo...raves already
have a bad rap for
being pagan drugged sex fests...related to the other thread of publicizing
PLUR...a more tasteful bumper sticker might kill two birds with one stone
while not being blatant PLUR/love etc advertisement...besides <fill in
group or club> does it <fill in sexual innuendo> has been done...
	but then again...Im just being a critic, i actually dont even have
a better idea for a better bumper sticker....im all for positive
symbolism...smiles, sunshine, hugs...things that make you go hmmmm....

its really discouraging...for a long time I really was so wasted on
politics I expected it to all be shit, so i didnt really give one... then
a beacon of light that the ignorant majority(flame me please) actually
isnt completely sleeping when we can get prop 215 to be taken seriously...
so I gather hope, I vote, I regain a little respect for the system... but
then for the one beacon of light there is a black hole of lies,
deciet(sp?)(isnt that ironic?), ignorance, bad politics (can you say pete
wilson is slime?) that just makes me want to give up on it all again...but
the question still bugs me, is that playing right into their
hands?...probably...oh well...im just gonna move to guatemala or
something... be a ravin farmer...anyone wanna come with?

Forgive my ignorance, but I would really like to vote today, however I just
moved to the county and from what I understand you need to re-register, which
I failed to do. I've tried to get through to the "voter reg" office, but of
course it's been busy for weeks. Anyone know how this works?
Thanks,
StEvEo

P.S. The most important thing in a democracy is for people to think for
themselves, with that said, I know one word I've been thinking about this
time around is "Equality", I hope you think about it too.

Depends on which Malcolm X you're talking about. The pre-visit-to
Mecca follower of Elijah Muhammed, or the post-visit-to-Mecca
Malcolm X who suddenly saw the big picture and realized that it's
just as bad to be anti-white racist as it is to be anti-black racist.

In fact, that's why Elijah Muhammed and/or the FBI had Malcolm X killed
(some say Louis Farrakhan had a major role). Because he was getting out
of divisive hate-mongering war-waging, people-oppressing territory of
fomenting a race war (which the FBI would love as they could use it as
an excuse to impose martial law and/or reimpose slavery), and getting
into the peaceful, enlightening, uplifting social-change arena that
made him especially dangerous to the establishment whose very power was
an emergent property of social strife, racial/class divisions, etc.
They killed Robert Kennedy and Martin Luther King for those reasons
as well.

PS: I voted no on 209, 204; yes on 208, 212, 211, 214, 216, and for 
Ralph Nader for president. Guess I didn't do so well!

Well, this is for all you record collectors/DJs out there. And the
occasional punter as well I guess. I'm looking for a few older
records, and instead of going through Hard-to-Find records in the
UK (and others that help you find records), I figured I'd ask you
guys instead. I'm not offering top $$ for the records, but I'll be
more than willing to give you a good price. =)

Here's what I'm looking for:

20 Fingers feat Gillette - Short Dick Man [red jerry rmx] - ?
Absolut - X-Ray my love - Tribal America
Diana Ross - I will survive [sure is pure mix] - EMI
Euphoria UK - Mercurial [stone high mix] - Tribal America
Idjut Boys & Laj - Jazz Fuc - U-Star
Ly - Back 2 Zanzibar - Nite Grooves
Millionaire Hippies - I am the music, hear me! - Deconstruction
Murk - Bugged Out - Solid Pleasure
Romanthony - Ministry of Love - Azuli
Rozzo - Into your Space - Bush
Sweet Tee - It's my beat [deep stix & kentish town remix] - Deep
                                                            Distraction
Urban Soul - Sex on my mind [dj pierre mix] - BPM King Street Records
Urban Soul - Until we meet again [hani's heavenly mix] - BPM King St.

If you have any of these, please email me privately. =) Thanks!

For those of you who believe that a YES vote for 209 is in some way making
a statement
against racism, may I draw your attention to the following map showing how
the great
state of California voted on this matter, look at the map for yourself, 

http://vote96.ss.ca.gov/Vote96/html/vote/vote.htm

click on propositions
notice that proposition 209 is ahead  55% to 445 (@ 1:00 am :)
then click on [View map] for 209

Notice the demographics of the voting.  Now ask yourself, if voting NO for
209 is a vote for "racism" does that mean that the bay area and
specifically
the City of San Francisco, is one of the most racist places in the whole
state?

Or can we draw some other conclusion?

All I can say is that it was  Maps like this that caused me to move to San
Francisco.

Hi all!

 Happy post election day (hmmmmm). I'm trying to find some folks who were 
trying to talk to me about an upcoming benefit at CBC. I'm interested but 
need to talk to someone (production coordinator or somethin') about details.


 Thanks in advance and apologies for spamming the list.

Even more interesting, look at the map/demographics for prop 214, 216,
which are very important propositions that disempowered HMO's and
empowered people -- both lost, badly. The only place they did well was
in the SF region, because people know what's up here and aren't scared
off by the serious $$$ and advertizing lies pitched by the health
industries against these props. 

And everybody statewide was too brainwashed to vote for 211, and 207, 
even those were very important consumer protection props that lost
badly. People don't seem to understand that powerless individuals
cannot take on gaggles of corporate lawyers, insider coverups, the
ability for corporate personnel to facelessly commit crimes of
recklessness and neglect while hiding behind a veil of corporate
anonymity, and finally, do battle with nearly infinitely deep corporate
pockets that can hire the best legal obfuscation money can buy... an
individual or group of individuals doesn't have a chance in hell of
pressing a fraud/liability/damage claim against a corporation without
hiring one or more bad-ass lawyer(s) who are going to expect to get
paid BIG TIME for going up against some serious corporate resistance
and SLEAZE. And the only way to do that is to completely uncap
contingency fees so that an individual who is not independently wealthy
can hire the legal muscle required to do proper battle with a
corporation. But then again, given that each stupid ass silicon valley
employee unthinkingly followed the advice sent by e-mail by thousands
of Silicon Valley CEO's to their employees stating how important it was
to vote against these props or corporations would have to just pack
their bags and move out of state. What a bunch of fucking PUSSY-ASS
FEAR/UNCERTAINTY/DOUBT believing MORONS! I hope you all get what you
deserve!

Even more pathetic is the passage of prop 218, which is the "son of
prop 13" -- this prop. is going to further reduce the funds available
for schools and local services, but the language of the prop is so
obfuscated that you won't kow this at first glance. I guess that's ok
since the property owners that passed this prop can use the tax savings
from this prop to send their children to private schools. ANd in 10-20
years, they can spend 10X that money building more jails, buying fancy
alarm systems, fencing their property, private security guards, etc.
Such a deal -- why, it'll be just like being the elite in south
america!

Finally, with the passage of prop 204, everybody gets to pay for the
special water needs of a minority of extremely rich agri-businesses
farming in California. These happen to be some of the richest
corporations in the state and they could/should be funding their own
water needs by themselves! ANd to do this, we will be damming some
important salmon runs and further upsetting the fragile ecology of
northern california.  Such a deal for all the people that voted for
this prop, we get to destroy nature, and further subsidize california
agri-business, which already is subsidized significantly because they
are "allowed" to pay illegal immigrant workers below-minimum wage,
force them to work in illegal conditions, have the government buy back
surplus crops at inflated rates, and the state doesn't get any
taxes/SDI/ workers-comp/medicare off the "under the table" pay to
immigrant workers. A very good deal for the rich agribusinesses, and a
very bad deal for you, me, and the immigrant workers.

PS: people should begin to know that an individual simply CANNOT read
the language of a proposition and understand what the proposition is
saying. propositions are written in legalese, so ultimately, everybody
should have a lawyer or someone w/ legal savvy (e.g. Ralph Nader)
explain what the propoitions mean and actually do. Yes, I've read the

opinions of numerous parties who have provided
interpretations/ramifications of the props. Then, and only then, can

I see the situation as follows, people tend to promote the group or
what-ever group
they feel comfortable with, In the US, democracy is a delecate situation,
if a strong meme 
(like Nazism or Bigotry ) runs through a society, is can easily sway a
majority of the people to
commit acts that are truly evil (do you think Hitler created Nazi Germany
all by himself?, but by the same
token, were the majority of the German people power hungry jew-killers? Or
just appathetic
until it was too late?).  Affirmative Action was an applied remedy to a
particularly strong meme that gave
White Males the majority of control over the USA.

The facts:

	Originaly only White Men who were land owners and I believe at least 30
years of age were allowed to vote
			(someone plese correct this, dates, etc.)
	Women were not allowed to vote until the 1920's
	African Americans were not given the vote until 1957 and then not
	 allowed to vote until after the civil rights movement of 1963 - 68.
	So let's look at the numbers...

	Number of years US of A has existed.  					215 
	Number of years white women have had the right to vote			 73(?)
	Number of years Blacks (women and men) have had the right to vote	 33
	Number of years 18 year olds have had the right to vote			 29

So for 142 years or 66% (2/3) of the entire existance of the great United
States of
America only White Males were allowed to vote, run for office, and, by
default, control the
reigns of government and power. People of color have only been allowed to
fully participate
in the electorial process (with liberty and justice for all?) for a mere
15% of the lifespane of this nation,
an 18 year old could go to war and die in Vietnam but couldn't vote up
untill 1968 (and some people still don't
want him/her to be out past midnight in SF :)

So it seems to me that,Women, people of color (minorities is a confusing
word, if you look at the Planet as a whole,
it is White people who are in the minority :), and youth have only been
allowe to vote for a mere  29 years or 13%
of the existance of the US of A.  Now, imagine the power base that has been
built up by people of European descent
who basically controled the country (talk about taxation without
representation ;) for 85% (182 years) of it's existance.
"Affirmative Action programs have been around about 20 - 25 years, a single
generation (as oppose to 9 generations
of exclusive govenmental control by People of European descent and  7
generations of exclusive control by European
males.

Let look at the prison system, where an inordiantly high number of african
american males are enmeshed in it,
(almost 90% of african american males under the age of 25 are either in
jail , on parole, or in some other way enmeshed
in the prison system, is this because AA males are "natural" criminals or
is the system flawed.  Maybe we need more 
people of color who are corrections officers, police, etc.  Remember, in
Nazi germany, the "work camps" we're not
explicitly for Jews, they were for communist, terrorists and dissidents, I
guess it just so happened (sic) that there
were many Jews who were communist, terrorist and dissidents, were they
naturally that way? or was the system flawed?

I myself don't believe in quotas, I believe in hiring the best person for
the job, but I also believe that a diverse work force
is a more productive and powerful one.  I once worked at a "progressive"
organization and many people would come up to
me and say " We wanna get more black folks working here! what can we do
about that" I would reply, "Well, how many
black folks do you know ?"  The bottom line is that people hire people that
they feel comfortable with, Afirmative 
Action was a measure (albet imperfect) to insure that white males didn't
just hire other white males. Now look around you,
how many Women are CEOs of fortune 500 companies (a few but they make up
50% of the US population)? How many people of color?, a sprinkling but not
as many as the demographics of population. So I ask you, is the playing
field level?
Where is the Female President? Vice President?

Maybe not every, but how many do think that way, would you care to venture
a guess? Look into your experience.

Racism runs deep in this culture, I remember working as an employee for a
large successful computer firm which shall go nameless, I remeber standing
in the hall way, (When I was hired in 1987 by this company of 3500
employees, I was the
second Black full fledged software engineer working in development (as some
of you know there IS a Caste system in
Silicon Valley,  it goes , Founders/entrepreneurs
		 	Engineering Directors
			Development Engineers
			"Support" Engineers
			"Quality Control" Engineers
			Techs, draftspeople, administrators, assembly workers, freight, etc.

Guess where all the 
			women
			blacks
			mexicans
			etc. are.

Is this because of lack of merit?

Anyways, I was standing in the hall talking to my collegues who all
happened to be White males, all of a sudden they
start talking about someone who wasn't there (who happened to be jewish)
using very derogatory language (none of these
guys, to my knowledge were jewish), I thought to myself shit I wonder what
they say about me when I'm not there :)
There is still a lot of racism in our society, I can understand how some
young white men may feel that it is unfair
that they have to pay for their forefathers mistakes (and indeed you may be
right it is unfair, but we all have to live 
by mistakes that were made in the past,  just because control was
relinquished a mere 33 years ago, doesn't mean
that all is right in the world.  The Rave scene is an indicator that things
may be getting better but as many of you can
attest form  looking around you both in and out of the Scene, we as a group
of Americans are not out of the
woods yet.

maybe the map at

might shed some light, notice, by your standards, what area of california
are the most racist, now mind you ,
any one of these areas are people of color the Majority (though in both of
these areas White people WILL become a minority within the next 50 years)

As usual, A History lesson is in order here...

It is true that Malcome X spouted racist statements in his youth and some
later years, this was a man who's
father,  a Garvyite and was eventually murdered for his beliefs, he and his
brother and sister were taken away from their
mother (who supposedly went insane) and were placed in a foster home.
On January 19 (a few weeks before he was assisinated,) he taped an
interview in Toronto on the Pierre BErton Show,
this pretty much sums up his beliefs before he was killed...

	"Where an ultimate clash between East and West is concerned,  I think that
an objective analysis
	of events that are taking place on the earth today point toward some type
of ultimate showdown.
	  You can call it a political showdown, or even a showdown between the
economic systems that exist
	on this earth, which almost boil down along racial lines.  I do believe
that there will be a clash between
	East and West.
	 I believe that there will ultimately be be a clash between the oppressed
and those who do the opressing.
	I believe that there will be a clash between those who want freedom,
justice and equality for everyone
	and those who want to continue the system of exploitation.  I believe that
there will be that kind of clash,
	but I don't think it will be based upon the color of the skin, as Elijah
Muhammad had taught it.
	 However,  I do think that the European powers, which are the former
colonial powers, if they're not
	able to readjust their thinking of superiority toward the darker-skinned
people, whom they have been made
	to think are inferior, then the lines can easily be drawn-- they can
easily be lumped into racial groups and it 
	will be a racial war. 

Now look at that map again and ask yourself is Prop 209 about racism and if
so, whose?

I'll see you all on the dance floor.

In case anyone is searching for a place to live in the East Bay, we will
have a room opening up at our warehouse in the Vulcan Foundry studios on
December 1.

The warehouse is about 3,000 sq. ft. total with four bedroom-ish spaces,
one bathroom, kitchen, and a music studio.  The rent is $300/mo +deposit.
We are situated about 8 blocks south of the Fruitvale BART station.

You would be living with myself (an unemployed dj, techno musician, and UC
Berkeley graduate), Darin Marshall (techno producer and product manager
at Opcode Sytsems), and Jason Peacock (dj, Pacific organizer, and
full-time gardener).

We are hoping to live with someone who is as interested in music/djing as
we are, which I'm sure applies to most of the people on this list.

If you're interested, drop me a line, or call us at (510) 536-9665

See ya,
Seth

hey all!

i managed to track down some information on getting stickers printed pretty
cheaply.  there's the dude called the Sticker Guy in Reno that does really
good work, really quick, for really next to nothing. a quick example of his
prices: you can get 1500 4.25" x 1.38" red and black ink on white VINYL
stickers for $150.00, this includes shippping.  amazing.

this cat has a web site with all his prices and what-not:

http://www.powernet.net/~stickerguy

you can get them in a myriad of sizes (ovals, circles, squares etc.) and in
anywhere from 1 color to 4 color....though with the color options, he can
only do SPOT color, which pretty much means no colors can overlap.

so yeah, check it out!

Well the stuff did eventually start showing up but it was not very timely,
considering that Dole had given his concession speech, and it was
announced on the radio that 215 had passed, before any of the Web page
stuff started being updated.

Nope, and I'm pretty sure the organizer has never heard of them.  Too late
to change it now.  Synesthesia is just the name of the party, not the name
of any group or dj performing there.

Another proposition that seemed to me to be really covert (I never heard 
much in the way of discussion, on NPR, or ads) was Prop 213.  I was 
really bummed when I saw that this passed.  Basically, it says that if you 
are driving without insurance (which many poor people do, due to the high 
cost of insurance) and you are in an accident where it is the other 
drivers fault, they will not be liable for your damages.  It also says 
(this may apply to some of you) that if you are in posession of any 
illegal substances at the time of the accident, you will not only be 
charged with that crime, but could also be liable for the accident, even 
if it is not your fault.  

Also, the Guardian seemed to think that it could also be used to defend 
police in excessive violence cases.  

Scary.  I think this is almost more scary than 209.  This is major 
discrimination against low income people, which also tends to be 
minorities.  I really hope the ACLU brings this one up in court.

Considering the discussion of affirmativer action, and considering the 
fact that some on the list do not have, let's say, corporate jobs (i.e. 
working for a fortune 500 as I have done for years on end), and 
considering the general shielded nature of some peoples upbringing (i.e. 
what was YOUR neighborhhod like growing up?), I thought I would nab this 
from clarinet to show what African Americans face EVERY DAY in this 
motherfucker.

And yes, racisim has happened to me.  I have YET to hear a solid case of 
ANYONE on this list or in my very limited lifespan, of a white male being 
affected by racism other than dishing it out.

I am looking for the qualified white male who was passed up by a less 
qualified woman or person of color....anyone? anyone?...read on!

P.S.  I am done with this tepid discussion.  When UC berkeley is 100% 
Asian, I am sure my white brothers and sisters will cry foul.  After all, 
based on just teest scores, there are far more Asaians turned away from 
UC than whites...who knows why.  I do know that w/o Affirmative Action in 
place, everyone, at some point, stands to lose.  It's not just all about 
a black & white thang.

209 will not be put into effect, so save your victory pogo dance.  It, 
like 187, will go down in defeat since it ties the courts hands.

If it does hold up?  Whatever, time to form alliances and approach things 
from a different front.  Brothers and sisters WILL work it out.  Stay tuned.

	 NEW YORK (Reuter) - Tapes showing that Texaco Inc.  
executives discussed destroying evidence in a discrimination 
suit are exposing the company to other legal attacks including a 
federal criminal investigation and expected shareholder suits, 
lawyers said Tuesday. 
	 These actions follow wide-spread publicity over the  
existence of the tapes and the resulting drop in Texaco's stock, 
which fell $2 at Monday's close and had dropped another $3.125 
in late Tuesday afternoon trading to $94.50. 
	 Daniel Berger, who represents black employees who sued  
Texaco in 1994 for alleged discrimination, said that he has been 
informed that the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New 
York has launched a criminal investigation into whether the 
Texaco executives planned to destroy documents sought by his 
clients. 
	 A spokesman for the U.S. Attorney had no comment.  
	 In addition to the criminal probe, Melvyn Weiss of Milberg,  
Weiss, Bershad, Hynes & Lerach, a New York firm known for its 
representation of shareholders, said his firm has been 
approached by potential clients who might want to sue Texaco or 
current or former executives involved in the alleged plan to 
destroy evidence. 
	 ``I would say a number of law firms are looking into them  
(suits),'' Weiss said. ``I know we have been approached to look 
at them.'' 
	 The existence of the tapes were made public when Berger  
filed a motion in the discrimination suit seeking sanctions 
against Texaco. Excerpts from the tapes were included in court 
documents. 
	 The excerpts quote Texaco excutives discussing plans in 1994  
to destroy evidence that had been requested by Berger's clients. 
The executives use expletives and racist terms including ``black 
jelly beans'' and ``niggers'' to belittle African American 
employees. 
	 Texaco denies that it discriminates and said that if the  
allegations are true, that they represent ``an outrageous 
violation of the company's core values and principles.'' 
	 The tapes were turned over to Berger's firm Bernstein  
Litowitz Berger & Grossmann by Richard Lundwall, who was the 
senior coordinator for personnel services in Texaco's finance 
department. 
	 Lundwall was responsible for keeping minutes at meetings of  
the most senior Finance Department officers to discuss the 
development of women and minorities within the department. 
	 He said that he had secretly taped the sessions to ensure  
the accuracy of his minutes. 
	 Weiss said the tapes could potentially expose Texaco and  
certain current or former executives to two types of suits that 
can be filed by shareholders who allege injury due to a loss 
value in their investments. 
	 One is a class action that can be filed by shareholders who  
bought securities within a certain time period. They can allege 
that a corporation issued misleading information or withheld 
material facts during that time period. They can allege injury 
if their investments lost value after the information was 
revealed. 
	 The other type is a stockholders derivative action in which  
shareholders ``stand in the shoes'' of the corporation and sue 
executives or directors whose activities exposed it to financial 
loss. 
	 New York State Comptroller H. Carl McCall also voiced  
concern Tuesday about the impact on Texaco's stock. McCall is 
the sole trustee of the state's Common Retirement Fund that owns 
more than 1.2 million Texaco shares. 
	 ``On behalf of the 880,000 retirees and active members of  
the Fund, I am greatly concerned that a corporate culture of 
disrespect and discrimination could have a negative impact on 
performance and value,'' McCall wrote to Texaco Chairman Peter 
Bijur. 
	 McCall said he wanted to hear from Bijur about the facts in  
the case and how he planned to address them.

I disagree here.  Racism doesn't just happen in the work place or in schools. 
It happens everywhere.  I admit it is much easier being a white male but racism
goes both ways.  I've been taunted/tormented before just because I'm white.

PS I voted no on 209.  While I don't think the current form of AA is a good
solution, I don't think doing away with it is either.

...From the list!

Hello everyone!

Yesterday was the one of the hardest days of my life.  The one thing that I
thought I could handle has happened, and I'm barely handling it!  My father
was taken to the emergency room and had to have surgery on his large
intestine.  Well they found a huge tumor that they took out, and he also
has colon cancer.  I'm shaking as I write this today, but I'm in need of
some support.  So if anyone out there has some good thoughts to say to me
please do!

I tried to not think about it last night and practice my set for BBQ &
BEATS, but I couldn't concentrate! =|  So I could use all the help I can
get.

Thanks for your time,

Love,

Noah Ruiz

	Further reduce funds for schools?  Are you aware that
	per pupil funding, IN CONSTANT DOLLARS, has more
	than doubled in the last 25 years?  That the top 10% of
	income earners ALREADY pay almost TWO-THIRDS
	of all the income taxes?

	Is it fair in a democracy that 1/3 of the population pays 90%
	of the taxes?  That the bottom 2/3 can keep voting to raise
	the taxes on the top 1/3?

	We're already working 2 days out of EACH WEEK for the
	government, and its still not enough!!

Why are you asking us about restaurants? I thought all of us
ravers were peniless idealists who subsist on music,
dancing, and the occasional burrito... ;)

What's the price range? Where are these people coming from
(i.e., what will San Francisco offer that their home city
will not), and how adventurous are they? How old are your
clients? I'm going to focus on California cuisine here,
since I'm assuming your clients are from out of town and
will want to have a taste of the local style.

Quite expensive, but great, is Chez Panisse. I know it's in
Berkeley and you asked for restaurants in SF, but it's one
of the most influential restaurants in the United States for
a reason. Dinners are prix-fixe, and reservations should be
made two weeks in advance.

On the moderate to expensive scale ($20-$30/person for
appetizer + entree, no wine), I'd recommend Bix, Zuni Cafe,
and Mecca for an upscale urban kind of experience (i.e., you
feel like you're eating at a fancy place; no jackets
required (come on, this is California!) but you look around
and people look stylish). If your clients are younger
(20s-30s) and would feel uncomfortable in a fancy setting,
you might try Bruno's, which has a kind of grunge meets
lounge feeling with food as good as any of the above
restaurants. You might also want to try Flying Saucer, which
I've never been to, but is known for their, um.. fancifully
decorated food.

On the moderate to inexpensive scale ($10-$15 for entree, no
wine), I'd recommend Valentine's, which is a great little
vegetarian restaurant, or Aperto, which is a relaxed little
italian/california place with a creative list of specials,
a good wine list, and excellent antipasti. Universal Cafe
might be another good choice. All three of these restaurants
are great, but none of them will give you the dinner-as-event
kind of feeling that a more expensive restaurant can give
you.

I feel that prop 209 is just an excuse to yell discrimination regardless of
what or who you are. Why should anyone fill a job position just to fill a
billet. They should hire whoever is MOST qualified NO MATTER if they are in
the minority or not. Employers want qualified people. That is good
buisness. If your not qualified then go back to school.

I've seen many different sides of this. Women not getting job because they
were female, people of color not getting a job because they were of color
and white males not getting a job because they were white or not minority.
All three were qualified more then the ones that got the jobs. The employer
just had to fill the billet.  Why should anyone hire anyone if they are not
qualified for that job.

It's the individuals fault if they are not qualified. You can not use they
excuse that they could not get into school. There are several schools out
there that will take anyone that has the money or credit to get money to
goto school.  If you don't have the money or a line of credit to get money,
it's your own fault.

If you go for an interview and you have 2 people with the same
qualifications, 1 of them is in the minority and 1 is not. Then they better
flip a damn coin to see who gets the job.


If I owned a big company, I would hire only qualified people no matter who
they are. I certainly wouldn't want people that are not qualified to with
for me just because a law said I had to fill certain billets. If seen some
pretty stupid people of all races, genders and what not doing a job and I
wonder how the hell they got that job.

I'm not looking for flames here, just thoughts from both sides of this
issue.  So here's a question to anwser....

Why should anyone get a job just because they are in the minority and not
because of how qualified they are?

hello all-

one day, i was walking from my house, near the haight, to market street,
which took me through the western addition.  i was minding my own business,
thinking to myself.  suddenly, a large group of black men formed behind me.
no, i was not frightened.  they yelled out to me "we don't rob white fuckers
like you, we kill them!"  they then proceeded to taunt me for about 15
minutes, yelling things to me about my skin color, my parents, and other
things upon which they have no factual information to make judgements.  they
then let me go, at which time i made it to van ness and cried for the next hour.

so, white males have never been victims of racism?  fuck no!  the words of
those men ("we don't rob white fuckers like you, we kill them!") have
resonated in my mind since then.  when someone tries to tell me that i have
never experienced racism (there have been other times, also, but i will not
go into them now), i remember that day when i was changed from the
idealistic young man that i was to the jaded white male i am now.

think about that the next time you make a racial judgement, john, like
assuming that white individuals are never judged negatively because of their
race.

Hi John -
 OK then, let me offer you an example.  My Dad teaches at Northwestern   
High School in Flint Michigan.  It's a poor, inner-city school,   
predominantly black, with poor test scores and lots of violence and other   
social problems.  He started there about 20 years ago with the hope of   
making a real difference.  After about ten years, he started to feel   
frustrated that nothing ever seemed to change, so he started looking to   
move out of the classroom and into administration.  He got himself a   
Masters and Specialists degrees in Education Administration, and started   
looking for an opening.  The vice principalship of his school opened up,   
he applied.  The principal, and friend of his, brought his application   
back to him in his classroom.  "Bob," he said, "I'm bringing this back to   
you because I'm your friend, and I'd rather you just know straight out:   
 You are not black, and you are not a woman, and you are not going to get   
this job.  It's that simple."
 A fine thanks for ten years of service.

It happens.  But is that even the point?  Isn't the self-esteem of black   
kids growing up in America damaged by programs that say, "you wouldn't   
get this job/scholarship/whatever on your merits if you weren't black."   
???

***i responded to this last night, but forgot to cc it to the group.  my
apologies to black adder for the duplication****

i just wanted to give my $.02 on this topic. 

from my own personal experience:
in 1981 my mother fought what would be a 2 time battle with breast cancer.
it was just my mom and myself and i was 11 years old.
my mother went through some heavy chemotherapy, which made her sicker than i
have ever seen anyone. 
she was chosen as part of an experiment at stanford to smoke marajuana to
lessen the nausea and increase her hunger.  after smoking she was able to
keep her food down.  
i have marajuana to thank for my mother's appetite and survival through some
rough times. 
after her rounds of chemo ended, she was told by her doctor that they had
already expected her to die. i am thankful for people who discovered the
healing powers of marajuana!!!! 

since cancer runs in my family, and has been a shadow over most of my life
and a few others on this group, that i know of, i hope you think of the
people like my mother that will benefit from this bill passing!  
i hope i will never have to be in my mothers place, but i think of all the
cancer and aids patients that will be lucky enough to have a bill passing
something that will make life easier for them. 

sorry to be a downer, but this is the real reason this bill needed to be passed!
here's hope that none of you will need marajuana to help you survive. 

peace 
shannon

 Further reduce funds for schools?  Are you aware that
 per pupil funding, IN CONSTANT DOLLARS, has more
 than doubled in the last 25 years?  That the top 10% of
 income earners ALREADY pay almost TWO-THIRDS
 of all the income taxes?

 Is it fair in a democracy that 1/3 of the population pays 90%

 Is anyone in the South Bay/SF Peninsula going to Audio Impact tonight?
I'm going, but I thought it'd be nice to go with some folks.

 As I don't intend to stay all the way to 3AM, I was going to get there 
early ( before opening time 9AM ) so that I can get the maximum time
in before I leave at about 12AM/1AM . 

 I live in Sunnyvale. I have a truck, so if we use my vehicle, it
would just be one passenger and me.

 Anyways, if the above is workable, send me a reply!

yep, 213 is another one that really bothered me. first time i saw it,
i was like "drunk drivers -- fuck em i'm voting yes"; it was only 
later when i figured out that this is a way for people who don't
pay off insurance companies to become non-people without any rights.

i heard that something like 60Million was funneled into John Garamendi's
reelection campaign by insurance companies who in exchange asked for
this proposition to be backed by Garamendi.

i personally have the means to afford auto insurance and drive insured,
however, i remember a time when i was a poor student and had to drive
without auto insurance because my research assistantship suddenly
disappeared when they fired the professor i was working for -- he did
to much hacking and too little publishing (wrote scribe, USENET's
arbitron, worked on postscript, etc), and spent too much time teaching
students how to be good computer scientists... and i'm sure there's
plenty of people raising families and working dead-end jobs (without
the free time to seek the higher rewards of our capitalist economy) who
spend most of their lives barely paying off their rent and not even
being able to consider buying auto insurance (even though it is now
illegal to drive w/o auto insurance).

anyways, this is a rather suspect war against those that aren't willing
to play in the  game of the system. if you don't have normal corporate
employment, you will find yourself at the mercy of piss-poor health
care availability and greedy HMO's that pay their doctors bonuses to
not give you the best treatment available. and if you can't afford car
insurance and some fat cat in a mercedes paralyzes you cuz s/he was
talking on the cell-phone instead of driving, you will no longer have
the right to sue his/her insurance company for damages and
pain/suffering caused by the other party. you are automatically
presumed guilty if you have the misfortune of poverty (or have no
desire to play by the rules of a consumption crazed death-culture).

yeah, this is a democracy, right? every dollar is a vote!

        Thanks mann. . . It's like that for me too. Ever since I've met a
few people from the list, and have gone to a couple parties with a phat ass
vibe, I can't help but to be addicted to the "good part" of the scene. The
good part is the part of the scene with the people, the music, the dancing,
the meeting new people, the having fun without the influence of anything but
the people around you. Have you ever gone to a room at a party where
everyone was e'ing and you weren't? If you stay in there, with those people,
eventually you'll feel as if you're on E. It's a strange effect, I've
noticed it a lot, and I really don't have any strong urge to try any drugs
because I'm looking for people who can give me that feeling. I sometimes can
get like that, but only when there aren't a lot of people who ruin the whole
thing ie: gansters, or people who don't understand the scene. 

        My girlfriend is like that, she's pretty drug free and I'm really
proud of her for that, but she hasn't found the fun in the scene that I've
found so I rarely go with her (take her). Therre are also a couple girls who
go to raves fairly often, but mostly the massive ones, and I haven't seen
them sober yet. I think that they use raving as a place where you can do
your drug, or try a new one, and be accepted nonetheless. Thats pretty
stupid. Like when you can be dancing or just sitting there, and someone will
come up to you and ask what you're on, it's even worse when they're totally
be-gollied (gee-willikered??) when you tell them that your sober. Or when
you say that you went to a rave last weekend to someone and they ask what
drugs you did. People just don't know much at all. But really, sober people
are a rare thing at a rave (or at least a fairly big one, excluding small
vibey ones). I've only been to one party where people only really smoked a
little pot, n thats all (I'm pretty sure). Pot's a drug, but it's more of a
just do it drug, instead of a plan it out and do it drug. Either which of I
don't fit to myself.

        Yeah, anyway, so as I was sayin, thanks. And I totally believe in
expanding (not contracting) your mind with certain substances, basically 2,
LSD and Psylocybin, those two things have tought me sooooo much on how to
think and learn that I will never regret experiencing them.

        Never forget to remember to learn. . .

 In reply to a post from John S. Lee asking for examples of a white person
being turned down for a job in favor of a less qualified non-white
person, Roy Feague offered this example from his family history -

 Being that I'm not related to the Roy's dad, some questions do come
to mind that may not have occured to Roy:

1. Was this "friend" sincere ? I suspect that a lot of times, whites are
   told that they lost a job to affirmative action or quotas , when in truth
   the folks hiring just didn't want the white person for the job. They
   can deflect the dissapointed applicants anger against "the rules" than
   the folks doing the hiring.

2. No indication of whether the person eventually hired as vice principal
   had better qualifications , and was a black woman too. 
 
> It happens.  But is that even the point?  Isn't the self-esteem of black   
> kids growing up in America damaged by programs that say, "you wouldn't

> ???

 And, as I hypothesized above, affirmative action can encourage unqualified
and less qualified whites to live in a fantasy that they didn't get a job
or whatever that they didn't get a job due to a damn quota.

I agree with you but i'd have to say its a hollow victory.  The 
pharmaceutical (sorry i cant spell today) drug industry is a terrible 
giant.  The drugs doctors can prescribe to the above mentioned patients 
for their conditions are typically at ridiculous prices....Unfortunately I 
strongly believe that if this proposition is going to really provide 
medicinal use of maryjane than it has to be through a regulated 
controlled manner, ie through a pharmacy.  Through this the 'bad drug' 
image that marijuana has attained might be circumvented.  

Just as there isnt a need for people to grow mold on bread
when they have a need for antibiotics...they shouldnt have to be doing 
something that is shady by american society standards, cultivating marijuana.

A hope of mine, is that when this goes to the courts maybe someone will 
see this as a compromise.  Legalization is just not going to happen any 
time soon.  Let the drug companies continue to make loads of dinero taking 
advantage of the sick....but at least let the sick get the drug they need.

just my lil ol opinion...

remember that line about not talking about politics or religion?

judging by some of the remarks being banded about in the wake of the

reassess our basic thinking on these issues. i thought "we ravers" were

i have been deluding myself.

I missed John's post, but if that's what he was asking for, I can offer
something interesting:

While attending the State University of New York at Buffalo, I worked for
three years in the Purchasing Department of the school.  What I saw, every
single day, was bids for goods and services go out to minority owned and
woman owned business, even if they were not as qualified as other
businesses.  I saw it happen all day, everyday.  Not in every instance, but
in a majority.  Purchasing Agents were required to investigate MWOs first,
and being MWO status increased your odds of getting a bid more than
anything.  (Unless it was for the new Caddy  for the President of the
school, and then it was a relative of some high-ranking
administrator...Makes the world go 'round!  =)

As for a white person being turned down for a job, I saw that too, when the
department was hiring a purchasing agent and the person hired was the first
non-white person on the list.  He just happened to be the 6th person in
line per qualifications and talent.  I know this, I saw it happen, we (in
Purchasing) talked about it at length as interviews were going on.

Those are clear examples of what I saw, and should not reflect on how I
feel or the stance I take.  I'm an idealist, so I would love to see
everyone getting the jobs they would like, and are best talented for,
without compromising their principles.

I'm sort of a romantic too, but that's a different thread...

This is not true. The middle class pays most of the taxes. The top 10%
of income earners are there because they've figured out how to
manipulate their income so that they can tax deduct a significant
portion of their income as "business related"... some do this as
individuals, some do it as corporations.

Life is not fair -- i thought you knew that already. Is it fair that
2/3 of the population is working 60 hour weeks and die an early death
from cancer/heart-disease caused by being wage slaves steeped in
industrial pollution while the top 1/3 can use all the leisure they
gain by having their money (and other people) work for them...
meanwhile they excercise regularly, live in pollution/violence free
suburbs, educate their children at the best schools, and relax by
playing golf and vacationing in tropical paradises? That's not fair!

>	We're already working 2 days out of EACH WEEK for the
>	government, and its still not enough!!

I notice you work at Lockheed -- corporate welfare (to companies like
Lockheed/ Martin) for unecessary military expenditures is the largest
drain on our taxes today -- exceeding the amount we spend on WELFARE,
HEALTH, EDUCATION and INFRASTRUCTURE by many orders of magnitude. (I'm
guilty of this as well, as my research is currently funded by ARPA --
but they chose us to do the work because we can get this non-defense
R&D  contract done in 1/10th the time, with 1/10th the expense, and
1/10th the overhead of a company like Lockheed -- and when we're done,
we're  GIVING AWAY the ressults of our work to businesses interested in
productizing internet related collaboration tools).

Meanwhile, I've also experienced how inefficiently government money is
spent at "the lazy L" and a number of other military contracting sites.
I basically see such corporate welfare as socialism and make-work
programs, so I don't think it's all bad. I would feel 100% good about
such programs fostering science and technology research and education
if they were able to fund the employment of a larger segment of
society, and if the results were more easily accessible by all.
Instead, much of the military work is done "in secret" and the results
are kept "secret" from the taxpayers/corporations whose tax dollars are
funding the work. ANd in general, a few "fat cats" at the top of
companies like Lockheed/Martin are making big bucks, a few congreessmen
and senators are making big bucks off of bribes they are receiving to
keep the  "pork" flowing to their corporate welfare buddies, while the
workers are actually getting paid at below-market rates (but at least
they don't have to work as hard as they would in the free market).

Yes, I mind that I work 2 days a week for the government and get very
little in services back. The main reason for that is that we're busy
keeping a lot of useless military projects funded -- because otherwise
your congressional/senatorial representatives would find themselves
without jobs if they didn't ensure that their constituents continued to
receive "make work" defense pork from the government.

i would be much happier if that money flowed into fixing
infrastructure, educating the populace, socialized health care, etc.

instead, we support a small minority of big companies and their 
employees through "corporate welfare" and build more prisons (more
corporate welfare for prison guards, prison commisary, police, etc) for
the increasing majority of people that fall through the cracks.

and proposition 218's passage isn't helping.

This was the funniest thing I have seen on the news in a while!!

Picture this: The two anchor people are talking briefly about Prop 215
and it's passing. :) Then they switch to the 'on the spot reporter' who
is at the Cannibus Club (whose name I forget). This is what he said in
his report on local TV.

"Yes Tom right now I'm in the middle of a 'smoke fest' of sorts. And I
am shure that all these people here have their doctors perscriptions on
hand ready to show anyone."

This isn't an exact quote. But it's close.

	If you leave $35000 with the DMV, you don't have to have 
insurance.... Actually this is what the 1996 California Driver Handbook says:

"California's COMPULSORY FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY LAW requires every 
DRIVER and OWNER of a motor vechile to maintain financial responsibility:
-Coverage by a motor vechile or automobile liability insurance policy.
-A desposit of $35,000 with DMV.
-A surety bond for $35,000 obtained from a company licensed to do 
business in California.
-DMV approved self-insurance."

So, if you don't have insurance and someone runs into your driveway into 
your beautiful microbus which cannot be replaced because they only make 
generic parts now, you cannot sue the driver. If you don't have insurance 
because registation plus insurance for being young is costing 1500+ per 
year and you get hit by an arsehole in a Lexus who runs a red light, you 
cannot sue even if you lose the use of an arm... Nice little law in a 
nice state which does not have a public transportation system that will 
allow you to get around without a car unless you live in an urban center 
(a bike works to a certain extent, but there is no bus line within two 
miles of my house except from 7-9 and 5-7)... California's do not want to 
give up their cars and part of the reason is because it makes getting 
around this place just too difficult (if you still want to have a job to 
pay rent that is) so no money goes into improving public transit because 
no one is using it because it is not good enough. Nice cycle...

        I completely agree with you. we are all INDIVIDUALS. that is why
the sort of debate that happens on these subscription lists such as this
really should try and avoid touching on issues of a highly individual and
personal nature. let's get that sort of thing out into the open, not
confining it to the net. for some reason people are much more inclined to
talk about "touchy" subjects behind the anonimity of an e-mail address,
hence the epidemic of flaming, and not so inclined face-to-face. (which
also explains why i get accusatory/hatemail letters and phone messages, but
am very rarely confronted in public about my ideas... no forked tongue
here, mate!)
        part of being an individual means having responsiblity to be
ourselves within the collective, and the ultimate responsiblity is
maintaining a level of respect for others opinions and personal space.
however, when it comes down to politics and religion, it seems that our
societal conditioning and upbringing, and our real deep down psychological
fears rear their ugly heads and we get...umm wot's the word(s)...carried
away. it's ok being passionate about things we believe in, as long as that
belief is something we have come to realize on our own, through experience
and contemplation, and not because of pressure from the outside environment
or by inheritance.
        if being a "raver" (ie; someone involved with the underground dance
movement) is a title you're comfortable with then you need to look at WHY
you are one. (those uncomfortable with the term, REALLY need to ask why you
are one!) i found that the day i realized that i was in this for LIFE, not
just the entertainment value, my perspective on the definition of
"progressive" and "forward thinking" and just about everything else,
changed. it changed from exterior terms, to very internal ones. not that i
think everyone has to think the same way, but we do need to be aware of the
bigger picture: relating to ourselves first, then to our environment. that
is what i mean by "new school."  this is after all 1996. unfortunately it
seems the great majority of people are unuable to relate their individual
experience to the collective experience. once you're able to make the leap
to holistic thinking, politics and elections become meaningless.
         as a passive observer of the american "democratic" process it
seems that ultimately the individual american "vote" is a tradeoff. you're
given the impression that your opinion matters in the great (rapidly
failing) experiment that is the United States, when in reality it's your
dollars and your time (ie: work hours). how else can you explain the
ridiculous two-party system which has more to do with electoral coffers and
corporate sponsorship (ie; bribery) than ideology? how else do explain the
complete irelevance of the poor in this country (wot? no money, no job -NOT
INTERESTED!) not that any other system is any more effective, it's just
that the self-righteousness which is inherent about the governmental system
here is overwhelming. it obviously isn't working (need i provide examples?)
so why are we propping it up, and when are we going to come to terms with
the fact that things are going to have to be restructured in a major way?
fortunuately i believe that the restructuring is going to be done for us...
in a few years we'll all be looking back and realizing what a joke this
whole "democracy"/government thing really is. things are changing...
remember pompei?

Listen, anyone who is educated on this issue, no matter which side of it
they're on, understands that job positions, etc.  DO NOT go to unqualified
applicants.  So let's just drop that aspect of your argument right away.  The
issue is this:  does discrimination still exist?  Yes.  just ask the 1500 or
so African-Americans who work/ed at Texaco, who have filed a lawsuit beacuse
their superiors have verbally abused them and denied them promotions, and
because top execs at the corporation were heard on audio tape calling black
people "Black jelly beans"  while discussing the issue at meetings. 
To me, Affirmative Action should exist because we as humans are not perfect.
 We ALL have our biases, prejudices even hates about things.  How could we
not?  This, in addition to the current state of affairs in regards to racial
and gender relations makes Affirmative Action vital
because it acts as an apparatus that negates any possible
prejudices/pre-concieved notions any employer, admissions board may bring
into a situation or have about a particular applicant.  
 To me, it's about making opportunities available to people who may not have
that chance if it were solely up to the employer.
Affirmative Action is also about things like outreach programs.  Universities
have/had these programs in place so that less fortunate people in our
society(who disproportionately happen to be people of color) can gain the
knowledge that yes, there IS more to education after high school, and that a
higher education is key to socio-economic empowerment.  With the passage of
209, outreach programs are now illegal.  That's a travesty.

It's the individuals fault if they are not qualified. You can not use they
excuse that they could not get into school. There are several schools out
there that will take anyone that has the money or credit to get money to
goto school.  If you don't have the money or a line of credit to get money,
it's your own fault.

If you go for an interview and you have 2 people with the same
qualifications, 1 of them is in the minority and 1 is not. Then they better
flip a damn coin to see who gets the job.


If I owned a big company, I would hire only qualified people no matter who
they are. I certainly wouldn't want people that are not qualified to with
for me just because a law said I had to fill certain billets. If seen some
pretty stupid people of all races, genders and what not doing a job and I
wonder how the hell they got that job.

I'm not looking for flames here, just thoughts from both sides of this
issue.  So here's a question to anwser....

Why should anyone get a job just because they are in the minority and not
because of how qualified they are?

flip a damn coin to see who gets the job.


If I owned a big company, I would hire only qualified people no matter who
they are. I certainly wouldn't want people that are not qualified to with
for me just because a law said I had to fill certain billets. If seen some
pretty stupid people of all races, genders and what not doing a job and I
wonder how the hell they got that job.

I'm not looking for flames here, just thoughts from both sides of this
issue.  So here's a question to anwser....

Why should anyone get a job just because they are in the minority and not
because of how qualified they are?

While I think this prop stank, and voted no on it, this is incorrect.
Uninsured motorists cannot sue for pain and suffering, but they can sue
for actual property damage.

Well, if you think that everyone should feel the same way on every issue,
I would agree. The wonderful thing about this scene is that it really does
encompass a very diverse mixture of people. This is a strength, not a
weakness.

so what? education is the single most important factor that contributes to
a working democracy. the lower a person's education level, the lower their
income tends to be, the lower their socioeconomic status, which leads to
lower voter turnout.
of course, it would be nice if everyone paid for school with their own
money, wouldn't it? then only the rich could afford to go and maintain
their position indefinately. yah. great solution.

please don't quote empty statistics. if you want to convince us, show us
all the data. 
for instance, does the top 10% of income earners earn 10% of the total
money? no. obviously not. maybe they earn TWO-THIRDS even??

>	Is it fair in a democracy that 1/3 of the population pays 90%

>	the taxes on the top 1/3?

the voter turnout of the lower socioeconomic classes is far lower than the
higher ones. that is, a higher percentage of those in the top 1/3 vote than
the bottom 1/3.

or would you prefer that the top 1/3 (with all the money) run the country?
that isn't democracy.

the us has a democracy. if you don't like it, go somewhere else where you
can lord over people with money.

------------------------

Yes, this is complete and utter bullshit, but it goes to show the real
power of propaganda and advertising.  I don't really believe that without
such, 209 would have passed, because, as someone already noted (John, maybe),
there are very few cases in which white people have actually suffered any
discrimination which amounted to not getting a job, or other such tangible
circumstances.

I do, however, feel that it will be very difficult, as it has been for the
last 20 years or so, to enforce such legislation.  There are so many ways in
which employers can hide the real reasons they employ one person and not
another, that in an individual situation (which is, IMHO, where this really
needs to hold up, i.e. it needs to actually serve the interests of the real
individuals who have been discriminated against) it's very difficult to get
a conviction based on discrimination.  I'm not really sure what the real
solution is, as it's my suspicion that until we willfully abandon the real
implementation of bigotry, we will never be free of these problems.

Now that is not to say that I'm against equal opportunity laws, as I believe
we should do any and everything we can to stop this shit.  This is one of the
reasons I strongly agree with Niels, that limits need to be placed legally to
severely curtail what can be purchased.  The corporation, in today's world,
is effectively above the law, given enough money, as are a few individuals
(although it's much more obvious at the corporate level, and much more
widespread in occurrence).  This is a big problem, and I believe strongly
that this is one of those bastions of the "white male land owning power
having individuals", and it's a way they can perpetrate and perpetuate
the continuation of bigotry, through the use of the corporate veil.

just my two...

[ WARNING! This post continues a topic (racism) that some may feel is not 
  SFRave related.]

Recently, Matt Lanier ( a really nice guy and no bigot, as far as I

1. Let's assume this was all witnessed and documented by mayor Willy Brown,
a multiracial squad of police officers with camcorders, and everyone's 
most reliable stand-up friend. I want to ask, did a chargable crime happen 
here, as described? Can the group be charged with a hate crime? 

2. The type of "racism" described here is hard to differentiate from 
territorial gang activity. I'm not trying to say that Matt had it easy, but 
if he had been a member of a rival group or gang, he probably would ended up 
in a hospital or the morgue. As it was, while Matt's obvious caucasian 
persuasion  marked him as a target of severe intimidation for their 
amusement, it also signaled that he was not a territorial rival, which may 
have been the case if he appeared black or pacific islander or latino or 
southeast asian. 

 My father, who ran with the "bad crowd" in his youth, finally admitted 
to me a few years ago that his gang used to attack guys from other 
neighborhoods just for being on the wrong street or at the same dance or 
just for the hell of it. It's that fucked-up primate territorial tribalist 
bullshit you can see in action all over the US and the world.

3. Definitions.... we need more words in our vocabulary to differentiate 
between all the ugliness that is being described by the term now. It's
something that scholars more informed and word-wise than I have addressed - 
I can't go into it here. 

4. Not to make Matt's experience any less, but his is one of a few 
replies that did not address the ascpect of racism that was the topic of 
John S. Lee's post. The topic was economic racism : minorities having 
less ability to get ahead in white-dominated fields because whites - 
conciously OR subconciously - would prefer to hire and work with other 
whites. 

 John asked for an example of a white person not getting a job in favor of
a non-white person with LESS qualifications .  So far, Tony Rotundo seems
to have come up with the first ( 2:00PM ). More replies will probably
follow. 

5. This whole family of thread topics on SFRaves may be painful to many,
and considered off-subject for SFRaves, but sometimes these things must
come out. We must remember that , while we may find out that others
have beliefs that alarm us, or maybe even scare us a little, we have
shared an experience of "the vibe". We are all fellow traveler souls on this
dirtball we call Earth. 

6.  I don't have the time or the words to describe what I want to say.
Love to you all.

why should a sick person let themselves be gauged by the pharmaceautical 
industry when they can grow their own medicine for free? pot is just like
any other plant, there's nothing "shady" about cultivating it. the clause
in 215 that allows people with prescriptions to grow their own eliminates
the need to get the drug profiteers (legal and illegal) involved. I don't
understand why you see this as a bad thing...

There is still a lot of racism in our society, I can understand how some
young white men may feel that it is unfair that they have to pay for their
forefathers mistakes (and indeed you may be right it is unfair, but we all
------------------
Whoa, let's hold on a second here.  I'm white, but my forefathers had 0
to do with this shit.  I'm a first generation immigrant myself.  My folks
were never part of the "white establishment" that held and wielded both
power and bigotry here in the U.S.  My ancestry is Irish, primarily, on
1 side, and Icelandic on the other (ok, so my ancestors were berserkers,
and if your family was living in the North Atlantic seas several hundred
years ago, my ancestors may have pulled up in a boat and raped and killed
everyone in your families village... I'm really not sure).  What's my point?
I believe a quote from Malcolm, obtained through Geoff White will do quite
nicely here.  There are basically two times of people in the world today,
WRT this issue.  Those who would continue oppression, and those who would
end it.  My only question is, which one are you?


The Rave scene is an indicator that things may be getting better but
as many of you can attest form  looking around you both in and out of the
Scene, we as a group of Americans are not out of the woods yet.
-----------------
I'm white, as I said, but the prevalence of people on the mailing list
whining about gangsters every time they go to a party that has attendees
who are Hispanic or Black definitely makes me wonder.  Funky techno tribe
a week or so ago is a case in point...

LUAH is a protocol for social discussion, not something that happens 
AFTER the fact.

LISTEN to each other
make sure we UNDERSTAND what is being said
ACCEPT each other for who we are
HUG each other, because physical contact is a great way to remove fears 
and make friends :-)

peace and love,

deeje

What about that guy on the news that didn't get some contract because he
wasn't in the minority, Sued the company and won. They bring him up
everytime they talked about 209.

I read and article last year (sorry can't remember the magazine) it had a
bunch of babies lined up in 5 rows of about 6-8. At the very end was a
single white baby. The title of the article was " Hey whitey, it's your
turn to sit at the back of the bus". All the other babies were of color. It
stated by the middle of 96 to early 97 that white males will be in the
minority.  So, maybe 209 might be a good idea.

The last thing I have to say about this issue is we have to start teaching
our children to love and respect EVERYONE in the same way we would want to
be treated. That way when they grow up they won't need to even have the
issue of prop 209 or anything that discriminate against certain race,
gender..etc.. We may not be able to change the here and now, but we can do
something about the future. So let's stop blaming one another and let's
work together on making the future a better place for our kids.



Now, let's get back to RAVING.

Hi Larry -
 My example is not one of official discrimination due to affirmative   
action, but unofficial reverse-discrimination.

1. My Dad believed his friend to be sincere... can't say much more than   
that, since I wasn't in his shoes, but I think my Dad would have a pretty   
good idea after working with this man for many years.

2. Yes, a black Vice Principal was eventually hired, and unfortunately,   
quite unlike the admired principal, turned out to be a an incompetent   
alcoholic.  He was recently fired.

3. True, there are certainly cases where AA is the scapegoat for a   
legitimately less-qualified applicant , but then, it's certainly not   
always the case, either.  I don't believe that is the situation here.

Are you reluctant to accept the idea that this could be a case of very   
real discrimination?  Or were you just pointing out some of the ways that   
people may cry wolf unjustly?

First of all, much respect to everyone:

However, I'm getting very emotional about something which is supposed to
be intellectual.  "Knucklehead" just stated that maybe Prop 209 is a
good idea since he read an article that excacerbated his fears of
becoming White male MINORITY.  I'm truly disheartened, saddened, and
well, just plain disappointed that he feels that way.  As a minority
who's somewhat struggled, it was at U.C. Berkeley where I discovered
exactly how much a disadvantage I'd had in comparison to my fellow white
schoolmates with parents as professionals and very little extraneous
worries (ie. money, jobs, etc.)  It's just plain SAD that minority
populations INCREASES while support for their advancement in society
DECREASES.  I received my bachelor's degree in two majors and was
allowed the opportunity to prove myself worthy and able at one of the
finest institutions in the world...and not only do I thank God, I also
thank the the systems and programs which gave me that opportunity.  It's
such a pity they will now be abolished by 209 for without them, future
generations of minorities will never get the decent opporunity I had.  

Peace and love always.

>or would you prefer that the top 1/3 (with all the money) run the country?
>that isn't democracy.

In case the recent elections haven't clued people in, the USA is not a
democracy, and in fact, the TOP TEN PERCENT OF THE COUNTRY DO IN FACT
ALREADY RUN THE COUNTRY. That's not democracy, it's a "kinder gentler"
plutocracy hidden behind the anonymous and always-smiling face of  the
corporate receptionist and corporate media hype spinners turned
politician.  Wake up! people don't vote, dollars do. those with the
most dollars win. 

Although such plutocratic government is easy to point out in latin
american countries, people seem blinded to think that the USA isn't a
plutocracy. IMHO, it is, with the special added twist that the ruling
class happens to be embodied by large multinational corporations rather
than ruling families of ancestral wealth and property. To make matters
worse, these companies (GE, Time/Warner, Westinghaus, Disney/Turner,
most insurance companies) own the press and the media by which our 
ideas of governmental choices -- our very notions of what constitudes
"freedom"  and "democracy" -- are shaped. (why is it that "ross perot" 
is the only media-approved third party deserving of mention when "ralph
nader" garnered as many votes in some districts (e.g. SF) as perot
did?? Perhaps nobody in the media wants you to know about someone who
refuses to spend advertising dollars (kickbacks to the media); someone
who makes the media control over the electoral process a first-class
issue?

>the us has a democracy. if you don't like it, go somewhere else where you
>can lord over people with money.

given the erosion of "democracy" in the US, i'd love to work in the
netherlands, but I doubt i'd get citizenship, nor could i find work
easily as i'm not an EEC member. you see, the europeans have seen what
it's like to live under fascism and know well to avoid it, whether it
be totalitarianism fascism of the Nazi's, or the upcoming corporate-run
fascism of the US. The US has been too isolated from such political
goings-on to know fascism if it shat in our faces,  so when fascism
hits here, by the time people realize what's up, it'll be too late. 
perhaps with the ushakable shadow government of the CIA/NSA/FBI,
perhaps it's already here??

for example, nobody happened to say a thing about the recently enacted
(by Clinton, fascisms wonder-boy) anti-terrorism laws which allows a
person who is not a citizen charged with a crime (whether it be human
rights protesting or actual terrorism) to be deported without any due
process whatsoever. as the clampdown continues, nobody will raise a
fuss as the FBI starts tapping 1 in 10  phone lines (proposed, perhaps
soon to pass if another act of terrorism happens), and nobody will
raise a fuss as our constitutional rights to speak freely and assemble
peacably (either physically or in cyberspace) will become illegal. All
in the name of national security or in the name of "keeping drugs off
the streets" or "protecting the children" -- or any other form of scare
tactics that'll make people believe the barbarians are at the gate
waiting to knock down the pretty pink flamingoes in front of the
ancestral trailer-home.

Our government will soon have us believing that near-martial law
conditions are needed to protect the freedom and safety of
right-thinking honest, hard-working "americans"; anybody not fitting
that description will be "them" not "us" and will have no rights --
we'll be convinced that we're under attack from within, and need to
enact these austere measures, which we'll do as happily as we sent
Japanese-Americans to concentration camps during world war II.

soon, our constitutional rights that we take for granted as americans
will seem as fuzzy and distant as all those other myths of americana,
e.g. freedom, liberty, justice for all.

so, no , sorry, I strongly disagree that this is a democracy, certainly
not a constitutional democracy.

Good point (thanks to others as well...the lawyer who won the case was 
the co-author of 209).  Anyway, 1 case, ideed.  2 cases? Dozens?  Hundreds?  
Ok.  There 
are MILLIONS of cases of whites acting against blacks for: employment, 
economic growth, justice (lynchings, all-white juries, racist judges), 
need I go on?

(And DAMN I thought I was thru ;) ).  For centuries white males have had 
Affirmative Action.  You want a job Mikey, let me make a call.  You want 
a promotion thomas, why don't you come to our club, it's exclusive you 
know.  I'm sorry, we had to decline your loan, you live in a high risk 
district.  I'm sorry , our club has stopped accepting applications at 
this time.  I'm sorry, the apartment for rent was just rented.

All of this crap still happens today.  It's really sad to me.  I 
understand that if researched carefully, we can find instances of 
discrimination of whites under the GUISE of Affirmative Action.

I would suggest the lot of us go to the ACLU home page to see what AA 
really is: http://www.aclu.org/

I have been working with a white colleague on the whole AA issue for 
cloase to a year.  We think we have a very good plan, and I'd like to 
share it with you briefly.

Affirmative Action:  This is necessary as a measure of restitution for 
pattern discrimination.  However, why AA has failed has been a mystery.  
The way many whites and some blacks et. al. speak is that AA isn't needed 
(still no black CEO's in the Fortune 500...after 30 years no less...I 
guess that means there are no black qualified candiates huh?).  Anyway I 
think AA should be implemented in the following form.

1 - Race plays a factor IF:
	.the minority is underrepresented in the field or position
	.there is a history of discrimination in the field or position
2 - Any candidate considered for hire under AA MUST BE QUALIFIED. No 
exceptions. (Of course, "qualified" has been traditionally used to 
exclude blacks, but this point needs to be hammered home nonetheless 
since it is the ideal.)
3 - AA cannot be used for groups who meet the 5% economic standard. <- 
the clincher.
	.The REAL test for AA is economic.  IF African-Americans or any 
other minority is making (+/-)5% of the majority, they are not eligible 
for AA.  This means, in todays terms (this will change, rest assured.  
This country is becoming, very, very brown...and I ain't talkin' Willie 
;) ), that African-Americans should make 95% - 105% of what whites make 
to be pulled off the AA list.  Once a group is off the list no more AA.  
We can gahter these numbers now.  This number takes into account the 
poverty rate, and actual earning power of the group in mind.  Any group 
can be put on the list if they fall below the 5% mark (if you're white in 
California, you will need this at some time too...everyone will at some 
point).  So what is accomplished is a levelling, and a dilution of the 
numbers game.  We're talking economics.

I could care less if there are no black engineers IF my people (or a 
portion thereof, I am jewish too y'know) are making 95% of what whites 
make, there WILL be plenty of black engineers, doctors, scientists, 
businessmen, bankers, educators.  rest assured, money does wonders for a 
people.  Ask most successful immigrant groups.

So now we have a hypothetical dilemma:  Blacks, Whites, and Asians are all 
within the 5% mark, our Hispanic and South Pacific Islander bro's have a 
greater disparity.  

Question:  Who gets into school?

good question. I think a portion of the seats should be reserved for 
AA students.  If south pacific islanders make up 2% of the populus, they 
should have 2% of the seats held.  This should be for all groups that 
fall within the AA criteria.

the other non-reserved seats?  Lottery.  Luck of the draw for qualified 
candidates.

Question:  Who gets the job?

another good question.  For those not under AA I think it's employers 
discretion, or a lottery.  For qualified AA candidates, they are given 
preference, period.

See the thing here is, yes, people will be turned down for jobs.  But the 
trend is temporary and has an economic target. When a group has 5% +/- 
they go into the regular pool, where it's luck of the draw or mgrs. 
discretion, preference.

The other element that will make all of this work is STRICT ENFORCEMENT 
OF DISCRIMINATION LAWS.  If an employer is found to discriminate against 
anyone due to race, etc.  The FULL FORCE of the law should be brought 
down upon their sinning heads.  Also a very stiff mandatory fine should 
be levied, AND statutory compensation paid to those affected.  All costs 
covered by the offending company.

There we go, my solution for a system that heals, has limits, and 
benefits ONLY THOSE THAT NEED IT!

Ok, now I'm really done...really...really...

No I'm not...I will not vote for a democrat again.  Yeah, yeah, I voted 
straight demo, but will not forgive them fro dropping the ball on 
Affirmative Action.  Next time, the pot smoking repubs (Libertarians), or 
Natural Law, or Green will get my vote.  The republicans?  Never.  They 
are 50's style Democrats to me!

Audi, I'm gonna go and riot in Specific Whites, I mean Pacific Heights.  
I'm a mad black man who is tired of the bullshit!  what bullshit?  I 
dunno, I'm just tired of it and I need to destroy something.  Hey, it's 
Sf, my white brothers and sisters in arms can join me cuz' we're all in 
this together...right?  Yeah right....It's funny how on election year 
everyones true colors begin to show.  At first it's all peace and love 
and unity, and respect.  Behind that ballot box though everyone's 
thinking about theirs.

When we humans finally destroy each other, an inevitability the way we've 
been going (I'm suprised we're still here actually), there will only be 
one thing left.  A sign left by a stranger that reads "We coulda been 
contenders."  An epitaph for humans...if we don't start caring about each 
other.

I'm out,
John

PGP and "public key block" is software to protect your freedom of
speech and rights to privacy on-line. Using my public key, you could
encrypt mail sent to me so that nobody else could read it; likewise, i
could communicate with you privately if i had your public key... Using
a 1024 bit key and 128 bit IDEA cypher, PGP gives you military grade
cryptography for free that is already in use in millions of sites
worldwide. It would take the FBI/CIA/NSA/corporate-spies/etc about the
age of the universe of time on the worlds fastest computers to decode
your messages, thereby this system is truly private if you use it
correctly, i.e. carefully chosen passphrase, PGP private key kept truly
private, no goons start taking whacks at your knees with lead pipes to
give up your carefully selected private passphrase, and if no
breakthroughs render RSA or IDEA invalid cryptographcally.

A good book is Simson Garfinkel's "PGP -- Pretty Good Privacy" by
O'Reilley & Associates -- available in most technical book stores.
There's much more to it than that, so for more info, Here are some

Tim,
Because what you wrote is indicative of the how 209 got passed, I wanted
to address your comments.

First of all, best qualified(as far as UC admissions go), in my opinion is
not necessarily the highest test score.  SAT scores have a higher
correlation to one's economic status than any other indicator. And
the highest economic status in this country is still white. Therefore,
whites have the highest test scores.  If you have available to you the
best education, be it the best public school or private, your scores will
be higher.  However, diversity in education also plays a role in
"qualifications."  

We are now in a global economy, which is not something that is going to go
away.  In order to understand our neighbor and compete effectively in this
global economy, our education must not exist in a vacuum.  By this I mean,
we should not be educated with people that are exactly like ourselves.
But, if you use highest test scores as the only requisite, you will get
that.  Affirmative action attempts to address this matter and extend
qualifications beyond the highest test scores.  It accounts for
discrepencies in an individual's life experiences caused by lack of 
resources.  We live in a nation that has citizens that come from almost
all other nations in the world.  We are the only country like that, a
veritable experiment in human culture.  We should reap the benefits of
such a situation, and in the process we must make-up for our short-comings
which include racism.

A very common misconception is that affirmative action
means less qualified.  That is wrong.  Everyone who benefits from
affirmative action is qualified.  Of course, there are your occasional
exceptions of people taking advantage of this, but, honestly, this is much
more rare than you might believe.  

The white backlash that has made "preferences" a dirty word, stems from
our economic situation.  People are worried about job security and want
someone to blame it on.  Enter your sacrificial lamb: immigrants,
minorities, and women. Instead of seeing yourself as possessing an
ever-decreasing piece of the pie, look at it from the view that we can all
possess a piece of it, not just a few.  And, someone is not going to come
steal it from you.  But, conservatives want you to believe that is true.
In that way, they can maintain their position of power.  They can get 
their kids into the *exact* school they want, educate them with
people exactly like themselves, do job deals with people exactly like 
themselves, etc.  Guess what?  This is the Good Ole Boys Network.  

The conservatives scream reverse discrimination and upset the people who
vote, hold office, and run this country.  Let's not let unqualified people
in.  Read:minorities and women.  Guess what?  This is how it has always
been.  Beatrice Potter did ground-breaking research (in the 1800's, I
believe) on lichens, but no one would listen to a woman and she was not
allowed to present her research. Does that mean she was less qualified?  I
doubt it, because her research is well-respected today.  Blacks were
thought to be too ignorant to vote.  Does this mean
they were less qualified?  Every time an election comess along, the voters
are deluded by buzzwords and sound bites and selfishness.  History seems
to be forgotten at every step of the way.  But, hey, history is doomed to
repeat itself.  

At its best, affirmative action compensates for one of the greatest
disabilities of women and minority group members: their lack of access to
institutions and networks of education, finance, training and employment
(quoted from Concerned African American Faculty of UC Berkeley).  If
minorities and women are unqualified as white men happen to see it, why
disband affirmative action and lose whatever access they have to success?
We all know that public schools are not going to address this problem any
time soon.

Let me give you an example.  I myself, white female, experienced a
woefully inadequate education in a tiny rural highschool of Northern
California.  Although affirmative action didn't affect me directly, there
are special considerations given to students from rural high school.  When
I got to UC Berkeley, I didn't know how to write a thesis statement, what
AP tests were, and had to fight just to have physics in high school. My
humanities education was lacking and my vocabulary was poor.  I ended up
doing very well in college, but if it had been by just test scores, I
wouldn't have been there.  Does this make me less qualified?  And I am
extemely lucky because both my parents went to college and I knew how
important that was.  My roomate on the other hand is of mixed ancestry
(Croatian and Mexican), whose parents didn't go to college.  In college
she also found out she had a learning disorder.  I imagine that her test
scores may have been lower, (I don't know) but she was always on the honor
roll and had the requisites to go to the University of California.  Does
this mean she was unqualified?

Prop 209 is a huge deception to Californians.  If you voted for it, ask
yourself why?  Do you honestly believe prop 209 is about discrimination
and unfairness towards whites?  If it is what does the following mean:

"Despite the fact that white men make up only 37 percent of the adult
population, they comprise 59% of all chief executives and general
administrators, 65% of all physicians, 71% of all lawyers, 85% of all
construction supervisors, 80% of tenured professors, and 92% of Congress.
Moreover, a National Opinion Research Center survey found that although
more than 70% of whites said they were being hurt by affirmative action,
only 7% claimed to have experienced any form of reverse discrimination."
(Chronicle Editorials 11/5/96)

And in the process of disbanding affirmative action, these zealots tout
socio-economic requirements to take their place.  I ask you, is there
anything to account for these factors?  They didn't propose anything?
Don't you wonder why?

Niels, do you just make this stuff up or what?

Damn right John. Please, let's bring the full force of the law down on
anyone that discriminates against *anyone* for reasons of race, etc.

Given the pretty strong stance of the Libretarians against the government
offering preferential treatment to any group, I find this hard to believe.

Absolutely correct. Nancy made a good point in the first part of her
statement on the subject of 209 when she stated "Wouldn't it be nice if we
lived in a color-blind... society, but we don't yet." (I am paraphrasing
of course.) And as long as we continue to discriminate against one
another, we have no hope of achiving that goal.

"The state shall not discriminate against, or grant preferential treatment
to, any individual or group on the basis of race sex, color, ethnicity, or
national origin in the operation of public employment, public education,
or public contracting." 

I can't think of anything more fair and non-discriminatory than the above.

Care to point me in the direction of where you gathered this
data?  (And, no, Rush's web page doesn't count. :-) )

(I couldn't locate data supporting these claims on www.census.gov,

No, it accounts for discrepencies in *certain* individual's life
experience. Those certain individual being determined by their race or
sex, and not by the real or imagined discrepency in their lives.

Perhaps you were or are a racist, and need to redress your sins, however I
am not, nor have ever been to the best of my knowledge. Why attempt to
hold *me* accountable for actions which I condemn and have had nothing to
do with?

Again, you are incorrect. I have given specific examples of this. Persons
seeking employment for the Dept. of Corrections are given extra points on
tests if they are of specific national origin. It should be obvious that
this can result in the selection of less qualified canidates for a given
position. I also remember a similar situation with persons seeking
employment with the U.S. Postal service, however I am not positive(I took
the test several years ago.)

Preference is merely another word for discrimination. And yes
discrimination is a dirty word in my book.

"People?" Which people? Let's be clear about this, shall we? In a society
where there are more women than men? In a society where "minority" groups
outnumber whites?

Whenever I see the words "the liberal press" I always chuckle to myself,
thinking of the Rush Limbaugh fans, praying to the altar of Rush. Whenever
I see "the conservatives want you to think..." I get the same chuckle.
Given a lack of specifics, you choose to make abstractions, condeming all
"conservatives" as thinking a specific way. 

Let me personalize it for you:

I voted for 209. I am not stupid, have not been  brainwashed by the
"conservatives." I do not have a position of power, nor am I the member of
any "Good 'ol Boys Network"(although I hear they get great health club
discounts). Are you saying that I am a racist because I do not agree with
you?

> The conservatives scream reverse discrimination and upset the people who

As someone else so eloquently pointed out: There is no such thing as
"reverse" discrimination. Just discrimination, plain and simple.

You are sterotyping. And as I have said to others before, this makes you
little better than a bigot. You are no different than those you decry.

No, it about discrimination and unfairness to *ANY* group, on the basis of
their color, sex, etc.

Well theoretically, you will receive the same opportunity as everyone
else. How unfair, huh? However, I think it is fair to say that
implementation of 209 will be held up or blocked indefinetly. And least
the opponents of 209 gloat, think about this for a minute: The majority of
the people have spoken. And their voices will go unheard, ignored, or
shouted down. Does this bode well for the "democracy" we purport to live
in?

Here is a more comprehensive doc about what happened @ Texaco.

Also:

Many of you cited specific incidents where whites were turned away in favor
of others.  What has not been established is their qualifications.

Anyway, just turning someone away because they are white is NOT Affirmative
Action.  Affirmative Action is a process by which a qualified, not
QUALIFIED minority is hired in a job in leiu of a white candidate IF the
minority is a) underrepresented, and b) the job/title/institution has a
history of discriminative practices.  AA is NOT quotas so...

Here's what happened at Texaco folx.

Oh yeah...I know I talk alot about the black white thang.  You meet me, and
you'll find I'm fairly color blind.  I say fairly because I am keenly aware
I am an African-American.  For all you hyphen haters, I just wanted to let
you know I will drop the hyphen when I'm treated like I am a citizen, I
count, AND I belong here.  Until then, I am an African-American (with a
wonderfully Multi-Racial, Multi-Cultural son...that kid is the MACK!).

In the end, to me, people are just people.  We all bleed red.

Peace out & live w/o fear,
John

P.S.  Someone cited how intimidated they felt when some black youths
harassed them.  Back home (the south) when the roles are , reversed, it
usually ended up with a lynching.  As somneone who is white, you have LESS
to fear from black crime than you do from your own racil group.  And I
would also like to say that the MAJORITY of hate crimes to date have been
whites against a minority.  These stats are in the Hate Crime Stats of '95,
FYI.  Besides, African-Americans are and have been very busy with genocide
against our own for centuries.  I have more to fear from my people than you
do, so RELAX and stop looking over your shoulder for the boogey man.  Hell,
if anything happens from anyone, that person will, no doubt, probably look
like you.

Now for the story....

Texaco Execs Planned to Destroy Evidence, Tapes

NEW YORK (Reuter) - Secret tapes of Texaco, Inc. executives show they
discussed destroying key evidence in a discrimination lawsuit and
disparaged minority workers as "niggers" and "black jelly beans," a lawyer
in the case alleged Monday.

Daniel Berger, who represents black employees suing Texaco, said he has
asked a White Plains, N.Y., federal court to sanction the company because
of the officials' plans to destroy evidence. Excerpts from tapes of the
executives' meetings were included in court papers seeking sanctions.

"What we put in our papers is extremely damning because they discussed
purging their files, shredding documents and concealing information," said
Berger, a partner at Bernstein Litowitz Berger & Grossmann.

Berger's motion alleges that senior officers destroyed or withheld
documents after one executive specificially identified them at his
deposition on Aug. 5, 1994, and after the plaintiffs had requested them.

He said lawyers at his firm were shocked when they received the tapes from
the former executive who had identified the documents and secretly
recorded the meetings.

"Our jaws dropped. They are still on the floor," Berger told Reuters.
"I've been practicing law for 17 years and I've never come across anything
like this."

The tapes were turned over as part of the legal proceedings in the suit
that was filed in 1994 by six blacks who alleged that Texaco had been
systematically discriminating against them in promoonad fotrng

Um, the top 10% of the population has 90% of the wealth, but only pays 67%
of the taxes.  The top 1% has 40% of the wealth.  Tell us some more about
fairness, please.

  I think a lot of well meaning people, people with compassion, people with
convictions, or people who thought they were doing the right thing, voted
for 209.
I am surprized that more people didn't recognize 209 as  Prop 187 in drag?????

 Who could disagree with the statement that the "state shall not
discriminate?" And gee, you shouldn't beat your wife either!!! Or, if you
can't say anything nice, don't say anything at all!!! Prop 209 was written
as advertising and marketing, not constitutional law.

  However, does anyone think their vote will be used to really end
discrimination??  Do you think you have somehow voted to strike a
high-minded blow against inequality and end unfair admission and hiring
practices??? 

Guess what...TODAY..209 will not stop state schools from continuing to give
sports scholarships to unqualified men and women athletes who do not have
the same grades as an average student.  In many cases, those "students" will
not have the grades to even get in, let alone compete "fairly."

Today...209 will not stop the music scholarships which are given to the
marching band students who play for the unqualified athletes who get in
first.  The sports and band programs are affirmative action programs that
give first preferences to some and not others. 209 will not stop this
practice tomorrow either.

 209 will stop the few crumbs or the admission "lottery" which afffirmative
action gives to the poor, or members of the underlass.

209 will not stop the Regents and other state politicians from pulling
strings to get the children of powerful or monied parents in--about 3% of
the admissions. This is another affirmative action program which 209 will
not stop.

Even schools like Stanford which benefits from public tax money for research
grants, etc. gives legacy preferences to the children of graduates, up to
20% of the freshmen class.

  I just had a white student, whose father was a Stanford graduate, get in,
and 10 other students who applied did not...and they had the same or if not
better grades, sat's and they were in some cases minorities..The one
minority student had BETTER grades and didn't get in....

..If you think 209 will do ANYTHING to change the LEGACY affirmative action
program for the children of graduates...leave cookies and milk out for Santa
Clause this Christmas.

Affirmative action was a bone that they used to throw to the few students
who managed to survive the unequal schools or families they managed to
graduate from.

 The admissions boards rank the high schools that students graduate from, so
that a student who graduates from a high school in Palo Alto is given a
preference over the student who graduates from a high school in east LA..
209 does nothing to end that preference. This system is not fair, its
economic predestination. Yes, those students from Palo Alto will be "better"
qualified, but is it fair???? 

But people who believe in 209 think we should line up all the students after
they have been through an unfair system and say it is "fair" to judge them
all the same. This year, 50% of the students who were admitted to Berkeley,
came from families who earned more than $80,000 per year. You want to
compare the schools those students graduated from with the students who were
granted affirmative action admission???

209 doesn't or won't recognize these obvious and the ugly little hobgoblins.

The truth is, that 209 was this year's best Halloween costume. If you put
this costume on, then put on the face mask of Pete Wilson, the Newt, Bob
Dole and Jesse Helms.

  If you think these guys, and the Republicans who floated this propostion
(it was authored by the party, the same party who brought you 187) because
they are committed to righting a great social evil........just look how
Jesse Helms played the race card in South Carolina with the same "white"
wing social agenda. 209 was a tool of power, money and politics, certainly
nothing pretending to be an Emancipation Proclamination
for poor white folk.

When Pete Wilson was behind he played the 187 race card when he was behind,
and then won. Jesse Helms won by and even larger percentage this time using
the "affirmative action" race card. It's proving to be an effective wedge
issue in political campaigns, and now that it is a proven winner in
California and South Carolina, you'll see it again, and again.

By playing this political game from either the left or the right, you got
suckered. If you voted for 209 you squashed a bug and left Godzilla alone.
But, if you call the people who voted for 209 rascists, you also play into
the hands of the republicans who are just as happy to have this issue be
divisive and polarizing in an election.

If the republicans really cared about preferences in admissions or hiring,
they wouldn't have attacked it at the tail-end, or after the damage of
unequal educational programs or opportunity has been done.

 The unequal funding of public schools based on property taxes, insures that
the rich keep getting the best education, and the best opportunites, and the
best chance at getting into the best schools.  If you've got enough money,
you can go to the best private school which virtually guarantees entrance
into the best schools. PERIOD. It's the best affirmative action program in
existence. Good education, good Colleges equal good jobs. And that's what
everyone is fighting about.....

209 does NOTHING to correct this evil, which dwarfs the evils which 209
pretends to correct. But, don't get me wrong,  I don't think that
AFFIRMATIVE ACTION, as a program of race based quotas, and preferences is
the answer.

>From the general tenor of the debate so far, it's easy to see that being for
209 or against 209 simply continues to foment rascism from both sides.

Affirmative action should be based on need, not race.  Anything based on
race, will continue to create rascism.

If Pete Wilson, and the republicans who floated this stalking horse really
cared about correcting anything, or making anything fair in admissions or
hiring..

...Prop 209.....would have been a proposition which said.....

"The State shall fund all of its school equally, and give each student the
same or equal amount  which is used to house, detain, educate, and
prosecute, etc.  each prisoner currently in the California state prison system."

Now, I don't expect to see this proposition on the ballot next election,
cause most people are going to be too busing fighting rascism,
discrimination, and preferences from the left and from the right, to bother
to address the real problem......


So, Yes...Black Adder...I CAN think or something more fair than Proposition
209. 

I say this as from someone who has taught in private schools, public schools
and junior college for the past twenty years.....just my 2 cents.

Dear Andy & SFRavefriends,

	Excellent message, and I concur, except to say that I would rather
focus on relegalizing banned substances than on arguing tactics with those
who feel as I do.  The *worst* thing we could do would be to let the
success of the medical marijuana movement destroy the unity of the
community that realizes the final goal is freedom for all of us.
	In conclusion, I hope those of us who still lack the freedom to
toke try not to screw up the chances of those who are now protected, and
that those who now find themselves legal continue to stay true and
agitate on behalf of the rest of us!

Much love,

Dear SFRavefriends,

	Although Geoff clearly has a good deal of knowledge of history,
I think dividing people on the basis of race, however good your intentions
are, remains as bad an idea now as it ever was.
	And although I love San Francisco and am proud to live here, I
don't think San Franciscans have a monopoly on wisdom.  8)  Also, racism
occurs in many colors.  
	And speaking of colors, classifying people on this basis breaks
down very quickly.  If your mother was Irish and your dad was Nigerian,
does that make you black?  How about if you're 1/4 black?  1/8th?  
	If we're all descended from Africans some millions of years ago,
as the archaeological record seems to show, does that make all of us
people of color?
	Another thing about history is that it doesn't break down along
neat racial lines.  Many southern and eastern Europeans were long
discriminated against in this country, people that today would generally
be called "white" (what a catch-all term for such an ethnically diverse
group of people!)  Indians fought and killed other Indians, albeit not on
such a massive organized scale as settlers did later, and blacks in Africa
were slave traders and sold other blacks into slavery.
	Although only blacks were slaves in America (not counting
numerous smaller scale enslavements of Chinese in Chinese-run sweatshops
and the like), looking back throughout history, every race has had its
share of slavery.  Indeed, people used to believe slavery was
indispensible to civilization!  Now we know better, that it is in fact
antithetical to civilization...
	Looking at the numbers Geoff brought up, if he's correct that only
white men over 30 could vote (and originally you had to be a property
owner, too), keep in mind that the average lifespan back then was
considerably less, under 60 is my guess.  So the equivalent today would be
for you not to be allowed to vote until age 35 or 40!
	Before this, in the age of monarchy, you could only "vote" (i.e.
have a voice in making government-level decisions) if you were a monarch,
until the Magna Carta in 1215 when this right began to be expanded to
include the nobility.
	Therefore in the historical time scale Geoff presented, it is not
really white men who had control for the longest period, but royalty --
for thousands of years, before white men as a group (and only a very few
members of that group, not all white men) became empowered.	
	So I guess to be fair, we need to figure out who has royal blood, and 
then give everyone else some sort of special affirmative action
preference.
	Obviously this is ridiculous, but no more ridiculous than the idea
that you should get special consideration on the basis of race, imho.
	An end to racism means an end to taking race into consideration.
If you want to keep considering it because you're afraid someone else is
still secretly considering it, there's no way we can ever end it, because
we can't read each other's minds.  

Love & tears for humanity,

KaySEE, you say above it's a misconception that affirmative action means
less qualified, then you say that everyone who benefits from affirmative
action is qualified -- leaving out that critical little word, "less."

Obviously everyone has to meet certain minimum qualifications to get any
job, even if it's working at McDonald's.  So it's true, no one who is
*unqualified* gets hired, promoted, etc. under affirmative action.

But you'd better believe that people *less* qualified do get preferential
treatment under such programs all the time.  That's the whole point of
these programs.  Otherwise they would specify that affirmative action
recipients have to be the most qualified applicants, which they never do.  

If you got something by means of affirmative action, it means that
ordinarily you would not have been considered the most qualified, and in
the process of getting it, someone more qualified lost out. It's that
simple.

And whoever said it wasn't a black/white thing is absolutely right.  As
Geoff pointed out, without affirmative action, UC Berkeley would be almost
all Asian, because more top-qualified Asians than whites are excluded from
the school.  

What affirmative action does is elevate mediocrity, no matter which groups
comes out on top and which on the bottom, and I don't see how that can be
regarded as good for anyone.

Let me just say one more thing very carefully before I put my other foot
into my mouth.

This is exactly why I don't USUALLY get into debates like this on this
list. For one, I never say what I really mean because my mind work really
fast and usually I'm doing more then one thing when I read sfraves. So I'd
like to say that I'm sorry If I pissed anyone off with what I said. I
re-read all my post this morning and found that some of what I said came
out NOT exactly how I wanted it to be said. And two, since I'm usually
doing more then one thing while answering email on here, I tend to throw
everything I'm thinking into one email and putting more then one issue into
another confusing both issue together. I don't intend to do that but it
happens and I'm sorry.

So, I'll just go back to the main issue on this list, RAVING, and keep my
opinions to myself before I piss off anyone else.

Last stand on 209... 50/50...  both sides have great points.

Noah,  I'm really sorry to hear about the condition of your father.  I pray
that he weather's this storm, and is able to lead a fulfilling life beyond
these difficult times.  This is a good opportunity for you to reflect on the
impermance of this precious human existance we have, and hopfully be
inspired to do good things with your life while you are here on this planet.
The difference between life and death is as simple as exhaling...or not.
Which will come first, the next breath or the next life....we do not know.
I pray for health and happiness for your father, you and all beings.  May we
all attain liberation to benefit others.

"Let me have silence always in the centre of the shouting, that is
essential. Let me have silence so that no pin may drop and not be
heard, and not a whisper. Escape us for all our spouting, nor the
needle scratching upon this gramophone of the circular cosmic spot.
Hear me, mark me, learn me, throw the mind's ear open. Shut up the
mind's eye, all will be music. What sculpture of sound cannot, what
cannot as a fluid token words, that nothing else cannot."

    YLEM - Artists Using Science and Technology

        is hosting a forum:

        "Brain, Perception and Conciousness"
         ----------------------------------

	Wednesday, November 13, 7:30 pm
	at the Exploratorium - McBean Theatre
	3601 Lyon Street (at the Palace of Fine Arts)
	San Francisco, CA 94123

	Free, open to the public, all are invited!
	Come meet some fellow artomatons!


	How does seeing become knowing?  This is
	a subject that piques artists' interest.
	We will hear from some distinguished
	researchers and see a video that plays to
	our perceptions.  What is conciousness?
	Can there be a planetary conciousness?


	Presentations:

	Neural Pathways to Perception
	-----------------------------

	Michael Stryker will discuss how patterns
	of neural activity in the eye and brain
	guide the development of connections to
	the visual cortex during early life.
	Stryker is neurobiologist studies the
	development of the visual cortex and its
	inputs.  He is Chairman of the Dept. of
	Physiology at UCSF.

	Totem of Heavenly Wisdom
	------------------------

	Tamiko Thiel will show a 2D computer
	graphic simulation of a new video install-
	ation in the Totem Project, the Totem of
	Heavenly Wisdom.
	Thiel has studied product design at Stanford,
	human/computer interfaces at MIT Media Lab
	and fine art in Munich, Germany.

	The Autostereogram
	--------------------

	Christopher Tyler, PhD. has long been interested
	in the mysteries of 3D vision and was lucky
	enough to work at Bell Labs with Bela Julesz,
	father of the random dot stereogram.  In 1979
	he conceived of using the classic wallpaper
	effect to program the free-viewing repetitive
	stereograms that have bee popularized in the
	Magic Eye books.
	Tyler is Associate Director of the Smith-
	Kettlewell Eye Research Institute in San
	Francisco, an independent organization
	devoted to the study of vision, brain
	processing, eye diseases and devices for the
	blind.

	An Essential Mystery: Brains Imagine
	------------------------------------
	
	Trudy Myrrh Reagan presents her new painting
	by this name on the subject of conciousness.
	Trudy is the founder of YLEM and is an artist
	incorporating science images and ideas in her
	art.  Her "Essentialn Mysteries" series treats
	intriguing subjects that scientists investigate
	but probably will never "solve".

	From the Silk Road to the Silicon Road
	--------------------------------------

	Alexander Besher explores how the planet
	can evolve into a new template of collective
	conciousness.
	Bescher is a SF based journalist, novelist
	and futurist.  He is the author of Rim:
	A Novel of Virtual Reality, which was nominated
	for the Philip K. Dick award in 1994.  He
	wrote the syndicate column "Pacific Rim" for
	7 years and is the author of the Pacific
	Rim Almanac.

Once again, Affirmative Actions goals are simple.  To allow QUALIFIED 
minorities and women preference in jobs where they are underrepresented, 
or the job/position/industry has a pattern of discrimination agaisnt same.

Stop lying, and get informed.  As a matter of fact, a few years in teh 
workplace wouldn't hurt.

Out,
John

P.S.  For the last time, it is not about promoting unqualified 
applicants.  Promoting or hiring the unqualified under the GUISE of 
Affirmative Action does nobody any good.  Besides such prqactices are not 
only NOT Affirmative Action, they are stupid business decisions.

The point will be moot in 16 or so years so...

Now, on to the discussion of this bullshit from Texaco:
--------------------------
	 The excerpts quote Texaco excutives discussing plans in 1994
to destroy evidence that had been requested by Berger's clients.
The executives use expletives and racist terms including ``black
jelly beans'' and ``niggers'' to belittle African American
employees.
--------------------------
While obviously completely outrageous, this is not all that uncommon.  In
some industries, for example, (particularly Industries whose 'age' is older
than a certain threshold), such attitudes are not only present, but quite
common.  In our corporate society, these attitudes have been shown to be
very prevalent in the oil and auto industries, two industries whose values
tend to be very old world, and whose power brokers tend to be very high up
in the corporate/governmental power and money ladder.  It's indicative, for
example, that Lee Iacocca, an auto industry executive, accompanied George
Bush to Japan to discuss trade issues (this was when Bush tossed the cookies
all over some Japanese diplomat).  Iacocca, from the auto industry, hangs
out with Bush, ex CIA director (which he publicly denied... Bush was a
pathological liar...), whose involvement (alleged, but pretty clear to most
reasonable people) in the Iran-contra fiasco involved the flooding of many
black neighborhoods with crack cocaine....  These folks hang together because
they think alike... the sectors of society and of the corporate world from
which they hail are rife with bigotry (against not only blacks, but women,
and all kinds of other non-white, non-republican, non-rich, etc.).  In the
aftermath of the Iran Contra debacle, the San Jose Mercury has even named
the person (Danilo Blandon) who contacted a young black man named Mark Ross
who was the point of distribution for this CIA (read your tax money) funded
cut rate cocaine selling operation.  Ross, who had no knowledge of his
connection's ties to the Reagan/Bush political machine, and the CIA, was
sold massive quantities of cocaine at very low price.  See:


http://www.sjmercury.com/drugs/

for a completely wild, true story that should turn heads.  So here we have a
guy in the auto industry (there are tales about discrimination in that
industry as well, many of which are as heinous as the Texaco thing), hanging
with an ex-CIA director, come vice president and president who is fingered
in the distribution of cocaine into black neighborhoods (all of this happening
when Congress had forbidden any monetary or other aid to the Contras), and
in support of the toppling of a populist Nicaraguan government (i.e. Daniel
Ortega, who had the literacy level of that tiny country above that of our
own) because that populist government had thrown out Somoza, who was a pawn
of U.S. corporations wanting to exploit the raw materials of that country.

This is not only nothing new, but is a distinct pattern in certain areas of
American corporate business, who often think that manifest destiny extends to
all corners of the globe, and that the rest of the "rabble from around the
world" exist simply to line the pockets of the white corporate right wing
elite, of which Bush, Iacocca and the Texaco people are all part, not to
mention the agribusiness interests which were driving much of the stuff
going on in central America.  So is there discrimination and racism in the
American corporate elite?  Do you really need to ask?  There are folks who
want to assume that racism is over and 'why don't those blacks and Mexicans
get a damn job?', but the fact is, that systematic bigotry has been the norm
within certain industries in particular, and is endemic across wide portions
of the largely white and right wing corporate elite.  We have had a serious
tendency to loosen any "checks and balances" present in our governmental
structure so that these folks (who possess more money and power than our
government itself, in many cases) have basically no fetters preventing any
abuse of wealth and power.  This is why I harp on the need to limit corporate
power, and to limit exactly what can be purchased through money.  Since it's
completely ridiculous to even suppose that any individual or group of such
could amass the kind of money available to many corporate heads, it's of
great concern that if we want to continue to consider this a democracy, then
we must limit the ability of money to influence our political spectrum.  In
the spirit of this, many of these corporate people put out massive campaigns
threatening loss of jobs and other things because they don't want to lose
the power and privilege they currently have.  This is to be expected, as
power never gives up power without a struggle, but what is particularly sad
is that so many young people (largely white, I must admit) have swallowed the
corporate propaganda hook, line and sinker, and unwittingly support the
intricate machinations of the corporate elite without realizing what in fact
they are really supporting.  This all becomes clear, however, when one is
personally made a victim of this power "cartel", but many don't see it until
it's "too late".

Although it doesn't really change the landscape much, I would say that in
general, while there is certainly discrimination and bigotry in the computer
industry, it's also probably true that this industry isn't nearly as dirty
as the oil, agribusiness, auto and banking industries are.  Not that we
should relax, nor quit applying pressure to get reform, but I do believe
that our industry is much less bigoted than the others I just mentioned.
It's still our duty, if we really do care that bigotry disappear, to
continue to hammer upon the "golden walls" of the monetary/power elite, and
to that extent it's probably very necessary to continue these discussions.

As for folks who simply try to insist that bigotry has disappeared, well
they're either confused by the corporate propaganda pushed by people like
Bush, the Texaco folks, & the 6 (!?) or so companies that control nearly all
television, and their ilk, or they are people who simply realize that it's
"uncool" to be a bigot, but whose self interest has basically made them a
bigot anyway, so they try to hide it under rationalization.  For the most
part, to the educated and aware eye, it's a pathetic attempt that rarely
convinces.  I'm afraid there are folks all through even our "precious"
little rave scene who tend to fall into one of these two categories (i.e.
they either are fooled by propaganda saying that bigotry is over, or they
are "closet bigots" themselves, who simply don't want to be recognized as
such).  So, we will continue to shed light where it's possible, and folks
like myself will continue to attempt to create bridges between the white
community (i.e. I'm white... BFD) and the communities disenfranchised by
bigotry.  It's instructive to realize, that "white trash", or those whites
not in possession of money and power, are no more dear to the corporate
elite who exercise nearly absolute money and power, than are the black
and Hispanic and gay communities who are more typically known as the victims
of this bigotry.  As Malcolm realized near the end of his life, it's really
more about socioeconomic class, and that it's really about the rich and
powerful remaining so, rather than a "whites first" thing being perpetrated
from the top.  I'm waiting for the non elite white people all across this
country to realize they're getting shafted just as much as the black and
other "minority" communities, and hopefully, as this realization dawns upon
these people, they'll realize that the political agendas that tend to cause
problems for "minorities" are also the same strategies, put forth by the
same people that have been holding down these non wealthy, non powerful
white folks.  Currently, the message is that the loss of jobs, to take an
example, is due to immigrants.  What it is really due to is higher salaries
for the corporate elite, who will just as willingly do away with the jobs
of poor white workers as they would for poor Black or Hispanic workers.  If
there is a realization amongst us all that we all have a common enemy, and
that our common enemy is also an enemy of our Constitution, we'll start to
make some progress, but for now these elite have happily caused us to bicker
amongst ourselves, which fairly ensures that we'll not be able to amass the
numbers, money, or power to upset their strangle hold on wealth and power
in America today.  However, should we realize (those of us who don't already)
what is *REALLY* going on, it's entirely possible that we could change this
'with a quickness'... [remember that song...? Michael Cooper, ex of
confunkshun...].  So I'll keep talking... and hope you do the same!

Well my first message got munged....fuck...

Anyway, I am sure that by now everyone is hearing about the "black 
jellybeans" and "niggers", and "porch monkeys" who work at Texaco.

I am interested as to how Starchild and other proponents of 209 are 
COMPLETELY SILENT about this level of abusive racism.

Yeah, you guys want a playing feild based on merit.  I only have one 
question, WHO DETERMINES MERIT.  From ym and millions of other 
African-Americans, merit is determined by those white males at the top.

Whatever...this country, and many people minds need a wakeup call.

I would only hope for a grand experiment.  For people whohave NO EMPATHY 
for people of color and women to live as us for one day. 

"You couldn't handle the truth!"

Here's the story...how about 1 mile in my shoes, no?  A yard?


-------
Texaco Execs Planned to Destroy Evidence, Tapes
 
NEW YORK (Reuter) - Secret tapes of Texaco, Inc. executives show they 
discussed destroying key evidence in a discrimination lawsuit and 
disparaged minority workers as "niggers" and "black jelly beans," a 
lawyer 
in the case alleged Monday. 
 
Daniel Berger, who represents black employees suing Texaco, said he has 
asked a White Plains, N.Y., federal court to sanction the company because 
of the officials' plans to destroy evidence. Excerpts from tapes of the 
executives' meetings were included in court papers seeking sanctions. 
 
"What we put in our papers is extremely damning because they discussed 
purging their files, shredding documents and concealing information," 
said 
Berger, a partner at Bernstein Litowitz Berger & Grossmann. 
 
Berger's motion alleges that senior officers destroyed or withheld 
documents after one executive specificially identified them at his 
deposition on Aug. 5, 1994, and after the plaintiffs had requested them. 
 
He said lawyers at his firm were shocked when they received the tapes 
from 
the former executive who had identified the documents and secretly 
recorded the meetings. 
 
"Our jaws dropped. They are still on the floor," Berger told Reuters. 
"I've been practicing law for 17 years and I've never come across 
anything 
like this." 
 
The tapes were turned over as part of the legal proceedings in the suit 
that was filed in 1994 by six blacks who alleged that Texaco had been 
systematically discriminating against them in promotions and fostering a 
hostile environment since at least early 1991. 
 
Some plaintiffs alleged that black employees at the company have been 
called "orangutans" and "porch monkey." 
 
U.S. District Judge Charles Brieant had asked the Equal Employment 
Opportunity Commission to investigate the allegations and earlier this 
year the EEOC issued a finding that Texaco had failed to promote black 
employees because of their race. 
 
The plaintiffs have asked the court to certify the suit as a class action 
to represent the some 1,400 minority employees at the company. A hearing 
on the certification issue is expected in December. 
 
Texaco said it had heard about the tapes last week and had hired outside 
counsel, Michael Armstrong of Kirkpatrick and Lockhart, to conduct an 
independent investigation. 
 
"If these allegations are true, they represent an outrageous violation of 
the company's core values and principles. Any such conduct is deplorable 
and will never be tolerated by Texaco," the company said in a statement. 
 
Berger would not comment on whether there were any settlement 
negotiations 
under way with the oil company. 
 
The tapes were turned over to Berger's firm by Richard Lundwall, who was 
the senior coordinator for personnel services in Texaco's finance 
department. Court papers said Lundwall contacted them Aug. 1 and said he 
had been terminated by Texaco effective Aug. 31 
 
According to court papers, Lundwall was responsible for keeping minutes 
at 
meetings of the most senior Finance Department officers to discuss "the 
development of women and minorities within the department." 
 
He said that he had secretly taped the sessions to ensure the accuracy of 
his minutes. Lundwall said that a meeting was held on Aug. 14, 1994, to 
review documents that the plaintiffs had requested as part of their 
discrimination suit. 
 
Lundwall told the lawyers that one of the reasons for the meeting was to 
"hide" documents from the plaintiffs. 
 
Excerpts of the tapes contained in court papers quote executives 
including 
Lundwall and Robert Ulrich, the company's treasurer until he retired last 
year, discussing how they should destroy a key document. 
 
"We're going to purge the ---- out of these books," Ulrich is quoted as 
saying. 
 
Both Ulrich and Lundwall refer to African American employees as "black 
jelly beans" and Ulrich, using expletives, also uses the word "niggers." 
 
They are quoted complaining how the company has had to adjust to demands 
by minorities. They discuss how some black employees were interested in 
Kwanzaa, a December celebration based on African harvest festivals. 
 
"I'm still having trouble with Hanukkah," said Ulrich. "Now we have 
Kwanzaa." 
 
Texaco's stock closed at $97.625, down $2.125, on the New York Stock 
Exchange.
-----

Did anyone watch Nightline last night?  The CEO was there yapping and 
gobbling.  I was actually PROUD of Ted Kopple who latched onto his ass 
like a pit bull.  The fucker couldn't even admit, publicly, that his 
people were wrong at first, he danced around the issue citing a "lack of 
judgement".  He never called what they did as wrong.  And you gotta know 
that HE had something to do with the atmosphere in such a place, as ALL 
CEO's do.  And these fuckers are SUBSIDIZED via TAX BREAKS paid for by MY 
DOLLARS!

I hope Teaxco ceases to exist.  I hope they never stop paying out of the 
ass for how they treat their black employees.  And it is obvious that 
*I* cannot trust the white males at the top to do diddly squat for 
anyone who doesn't fit thier mold.  The fuckers in question had the GALL 
to calll the National Anthem "ours".  The audacity...but what else does 
one expect from those who wouldn't know what real struggle is....the 
fight continues.

Also 209 is already tied up.  A shallow victory for the racists who 
backed this proposition, and the people who bought into the misnaming of 
this initiative.

Out.

Just because you are an immigrant does not make you immune from this 
country's jhistory.  You and others come over here, you had better be 
ready to accept the good with the bad.  Fact is we ALL relive the sins of 
our fathers.  A company poluutes for decades, goes out of biz, people 
forget they were there, build upon polluted land, and the children get 
sick, are malformed, or die.  The sins of the father are ALWAYS visited 
upon the son.  One should take time to undo the sins of the father.  Else 
they be visited upon us endlessly.

The typical immigrant stance is "I had nothing to do with it.".  Yeah, 
neither did I.  But I still live with the vestiges of racism every day.  
And they are not vestiges, they are real.  When you come here, you get it 
all, you cannot say you like a,b,& c but have nothing to do with the rest 
of the alphabet.  That is not what this country is all about...we are ALL 
in this together.  We are all part and play a part in the mold history 
has set for us.

And again you are incorrect.  That is not Affirmative Action.  That is a 
quaota system which is illegal UNLESS it is court ordered.  And under 
court order you still have to get QUALIFIED candidates.

Get the facts straight.

And this country has a very dirty history.  So we gotta clean it up.  
Want a broom, or do you just want to say "I didn't create that pile of 
dirt, YOU ALL clean it up!"

That is not what this country is about.  Don't want to participate, 
recent immigrant?  I invite you to go back home.

Sorry charlie, whites are still the majority, even in CA by a slim

No, it just so happens that many racists supported 209 as well.  If 
you're comfortable with that, then fine.  Nope, it doesn't make you a 
racist, but you choose to support that which the most undesireable 
support.  If that's who you're aligned with then fine.  It's your life, 
your vote, your choice.  I never want to be aligned with the likes of 
Duke, Helms, or the other rabid segregationist Thurmond.

Man, our historical view is really short.

Funny, my DAD couldn't vite when he was 18.  Why?  HE WAS BLACK!

The real question is what do you do about hundreds of years of 
discrimination...just pass laws, or take decisive action.  What do you 
propose to ensure everyone gets a chance?  Do you feel those opps are 
already there?

Within the state of California this is almost true, as far as the school system is concerned
I believe that over 50% of the students already consider themselves to be "non-white".
Within the next 50 years White (non-hispanic) people will become an actual minority in california
making up less than 49% of the population.  The African American population in California is
shrinking
whereas the Hispanic and Asian population is increasing rapidly. I believe that the census states
that
hispanic families have 8 children to every single child had by a "white" family.  Now mind you
racial classifications are totally subjective and tend to be VERY BIAS. I have a friend who's
Father
is "Black" (from the carribian) and her mother is white, she for all intent looks like a "white
girl", her 
brother (same parents) starts on some TV show (can't remember the name and plays a young latino
"gangster"
(boy our programming runs deep :)  Now who is white and who isn't? In this country racial
classification
is TOTALLY based on skin color which is arbitrary at best. But maybe it wont matter in 20 years
anyway
as the majority of people will be brown (just think of all the money that will be saved on sun tan
lotion :)

Well that's the point, which is why I tend to support parties that exhibit a large amount of
cultural diversity (which is what it all boils down to). Raves (especially well run large raves)
have the potential to bring large numbers of different kids together in a social situation, the 
friendships made here hopefully will extend into adulthood when this generation takes the reigns.
Many of the promoters that I know have very diverse organizations with many ethnic groups and
sexual persuations represented, the only thing that I believe still comes up is the place of women
in the scene, there is still a "treehouse" tendency exhibited by many of the men but it is getting
better.
This is also why it is importent to get Women "on the decks"  competant female DJs (like Tracy
DRC and Charlotte) set very important role modles for young girls who go to parties and only
see boys in control, they realize that with hard work they can be there too.


It's interesting, I was riding the bus around SF yesterday doing my errands and the effects of Prop
209
were already making themselves felt.  There was some drunk caucasion man on the back of the bus
(#33 Haight
no less) with his girlfriend/wife going off about how now he can go get his job back and not worry
about no Nigger 
taking it. He kinda quieted down when I moved to the back of the bus (I guess I was too big of a
Nigger to
express his opinions openly too :) Some people around him were noticibly embarrised, when he got
off the
bus, they started to apologize, I said, "Well see what happens when you don't vote" Actually this
fucked
up Prop was soundly defeated in the great City of San Francisco, the ONLY county in California
where the
YES vote got less than 10%. On another errand I was riding the #15 into chinatown to go to my
acupuncturist.
The bus was filled with young asia school kids and some of them were discussing prop 209. One girl
was happy that
it passed because she wanted to go to UC and before there was a limit on asians attending and her
brother didn't get in.
Before Asian numbers were decreased to let other minorites in, now since admission is totally based
on merit,
guess who will be locked out (mostly white males, OOOPS!) One girl said that she didn't want to go
to a school with
only Asian people attending, One other girl said that it didn't matter because the work force was
still controlled by
white people, for now.. and they all laughed.

Actually, I think the problem is one of economics, in another 100 years at the rate that we are
going, White, Black
and Asian people will ALL be minorities in the USA, every one will be BROWN


Rave On.

Now, on to the discussion of this bullshit from Texaco:
--------------------------
	 The excerpts quote Texaco excutives discussing plans in 1994
to destroy evidence that had been requested by Berger's clients.
The executives use expletives and racist terms including ``black
jelly beans'' and ``niggers'' to belittle African American
employees.
--------------------------
While obviously completely outrageous, this is not all that uncommon.  In
some industries, for example, (particularly Industries whose 'age' is older
than a certain threshold), such attitudes are not only present, but quite
common.  In our corporate society, these attitudes have been shown to be
very prevalent in the oil and auto industries, two industries whose values
tend to be very old world, and whose power brokers tend to be very high up
in the corporate/governmental power and money ladder.  It's indicative, for
example, that Lee Iacocca, an auto industry executive, accompanied George
Bush to Japan to discuss trade issues (this was when Bush tossed the cookies
all over some Japanese diplomat).  Iacocca, from the auto industry, hangs
out with Bush, ex CIA director (which he publicly denied... Bush was a
pathological liar...), whose involvement (alleged, but pretty clear to most
reasonable people) in the Iran-contra fiasco involved the flooding of many
black neighborhoods with crack cocaine....  These folks hang together because
they think alike... the sectors of society and of the corporate world from
which they hail are rife with bigotry (against not only blacks, but women,
and all kinds of other non-white, non-republican, non-rich, etc.).  In the
aftermath of the Iran Contra debacle, the San Jose Mercury has even named
the person (Danilo Blandon) who contacted a young black man named Mark Ross
who was the point of distribution for this CIA (read your tax money) funded
cut rate cocaine selling operation.  Ross, who had no knowledge of his
connection's ties to the Reagan/Bush political machine, and the CIA, was
sold massive quantities of cocaine at very low price.  See:


http://www.sjmercury.com/drugs/

for a completely wild, true story that should turn heads.  So here we have a
guy in the auto industry (there are tales about discrimination in that
industry as well, many of which are as heinous as the Texaco thing), hanging
with an ex-CIA director, come vice president and president who is fingered
in the distribution of cocaine into black neighborhoods (all of this happening
when Congress had forbidden any monetary or other aid to the Contras), and
in support of the toppling of a populist Nicaraguan government (i.e. Daniel
Ortega, who had the literacy level of that tiny country above that of our
own) because that populist government had thrown out Somoza, who was a pawn
of U.S. corporations wanting to exploit the raw materials of that country.

This is not only nothing new, but is a distinct pattern in certain areas of
American corporate business, who often think that manifest destiny extends to
all corners of the globe, and that the rest of the "rabble from around the
world" exist simply to line the pockets of the white corporate right wing
elite, of which Bush, Iacocca and the Texaco people are all part, not to
mention the agribusiness interests which were driving much of the stuff
going on in central America.  So is there discrimination and racism in the
American corporate elite?  Do you really need to ask?  There are folks who
want to assume that racism is over and 'why don't those blacks and Mexicans
get a damn job?', but the fact is, that systematic bigotry has been the norm
within certain industries in particular, and is endemic across wide portions
of the largely white and right wing corporate elite.  We have had a serious
tendency to loosen any "checks and balances" present in our governmental
structure so that these folks (who possess more money and power than our
government itself, in many cases) have basically no fetters preventing any
abuse of wealth and power.  This is why I harp on the need to limit corporate
power, and to limit exactly what can be purchased through money.  Since it's
completely ridiculous to even suppose that any individual or group of such
could amass the kind of money available to many corporate heads, it's of
great concern that if we want to continue to consider this a democracy, then
we must limit the ability of money to influence our political spectrum.  In
the spirit of this, many of these corporate people put out massive campaigns
threatening loss of jobs and other things because they don't want to lose
the power and privilege they currently have.  This is to be expected, as
power never gives up power without a struggle, but what is particularly sad
is that so many young people (largely white, I must admit) have swallowed the
corporate propaganda hook, line and sinker, and unwittingly support the
intricate machinations of the corporate elite without realizing what in fact
they are really supporting.  This all becomes clear, however, when one is
personally made a victim of this power "cartel", but many don't see it until
it's "too late".

Although it doesn't really change the landscape much, I would say that in
general, while there is certainly discrimination and bigotry in the computer
industry, it's also probably true that this industry isn't nearly as dirty
as the oil, agribusiness, auto and banking industries are.  Not that we
should relax, nor quit applying pressure to get reform, but I do believe
that our industry is much less bigoted than the others I just mentioned.
It's still our duty, if we really do care that bigotry disappear, to
continue to hammer upon the "golden walls" of the monetary/power elite, and
to that extent it's probably very necessary to continue these discussions.

As for folks who simply try to insist that bigotry has disappeared, well
they're either confused by the corporate propaganda pushed by people like
Bush, the Texaco folks, & the 6 (!?) or so companies that control nearly all
television, and their ilk, or they are people who simply realize that it's
"uncool" to be a bigot, but whose self interest has basically made them a
bigot anyway, so they try to hide it under rationalization.  For the most
part, to the educated and aware eye, it's a pathetic attempt that rarely
convinces.  I'm afraid there are folks all through even our "precious"
little rave scene who tend to fall into one of these two categories (i.e.
they either are fooled by propaganda saying that bigotry is over, or they
are "closet bigots" themselves, who simply don't want to be recognized as
such).  So, we will continue to shed light where it's possible, and folks
like myself will continue to attempt to create bridges between the white
community (i.e. I'm white... BFD) and the communities disenfranchised by
bigotry.  It's instructive to realize, that "white trash", or those whites
not in possession of money and power, are no more dear to the corporate
elite who exercise nearly absolute money and power, than are the black
and Hispanic and gay communities who are more typically known as the victims
of this bigotry.  As Malcolm realized near the end of his life, it's really
more about socioeconomic class, and that it's really about the rich and
powerful remaining so, rather than a "whites first" thing being perpetrated
from the top.  I'm waiting for the non elite white people all across this
country to realize they're getting shafted just as much as the black and
other "minority" communities, and hopefully, as this realization dawns upon
these people, they'll realize that the political agendas that tend to cause
problems for "minorities" are also the same strategies, put forth by the
same people that have been holding down these non wealthy, non powerful
white folks.  Currently, the message is that the loss of jobs, to take an
example, is due to immigrants.  What it is really due to is higher salaries
for the corporate elite, who will just as willingly do away with the jobs
of poor white workers as they would for poor Black or Hispanic workers.  If
there is a realization amongst us all that we all have a common enemy, and
that our common enemy is also an enemy of our Constitution, we'll start to
make some progress, but for now these elite have happily caused us to bicker
amongst ourselves, which fairly ensures that we'll not be able to amass the
numbers, money, or power to upset their strangle hold on wealth and power
in America today.  However, should we realize (those of us who don't already)
what is *REALLY* going on, it's entirely possible that we could change this
'with a quickness'... [remember that song...? Michael Cooper, ex of
confunkshun...].  So I'll keep talking... and hope you do the same!

I'm not going to bother spouting my opinion on the whole issure 
since y'all are doing such a great job :-) ...just wanted to pass 
along some of the realities that are happening with its passing...

this is from my boyfriend at UCSanta Cruz, whose whole family was trying
to convince me why 209 was a good thing...
 
> Oh yeah, I forgot to say, I know how bad it is that 209 passed.

Here's the UCSC's Women's Center's self-description:

Women's Center
Serves as an advocate for women and women's rights for undergraduate or
graduate students, faculty, staff, or community women.  The center offers
campus and community referral services, forms, space for art exhibits and
discussion groups, conferences and workshops on issues dealing with
sexism, racism, ageism, homophobia, and other discriminatory attitudes and
proactices which hinder the advancement of women in society.  The center
has a small circulating resource library, and is the contact for the
Chancellor's Committee on the Status of Women.

Maybe some of you are thinking, "so what", but I just thought it was a
bummer that a center that works to fight discrimination (which,
unfortunately, does exist still on many levels) is being shut down by a
supposed "anti-discrimination" proposition.

	Where did you get these figures?  I've got LOTS of data to back up

>From the Walls Street Journal 1/16/96 page A20

	Income		Share of		Share of		Average
	Group		Total Taxes	Total Income	Tax Rate
	----------------------	---------------------	--------------------		----
-------------

	Top 1%		28.8 %		13.8%		27.7%

	Bottom 50%	4.8%		14.9%		  4.3%




The point of all this is point out that when people claim that the
"rich" aren't
paying their "fair share" one can see that the top 5% already pay almost
HALF of all the income taxes.  Fairness can be debated!

Kerry gave statistics about wealth, and you gave stats about income.
Income doesn't equal wealth -- income is what people earn in a year, and
wealth measures what people own.

the reason why rich people have a higher percentage of wealth than income
is that for the very poor, a much higher proportion of their income goes
into living expenses, not purchasing real estate & stocks.  this is the
main reason to support progressive taxation as well -- if someone only
earns $15,000 year, they need every penny more than someone who earns
$150,000.

even with respect to income, the u.s. now has the most uneven income
distribution amongst the richest industrialized nations (this wasn't the
case 20 years ago), and the highest level of child poverty.  the bottom 50%
make only 14.9% of the income, and i don't begrudge their lower tax rate a
bit.  i also wonder what the WSJ is basing it's figures on -- do they
include sales taxes, for instance, which hurt the poor disproportionately?

Race relations in this country are at a particularly divisive point. Fissures
between blacks and whites appear nowhere near closure. On top of that, many
people of color right now are feeling besieged -- from anti-affirmative action
and anti-immigrant propositions, a Republican-dominated Congress, new welfare
legislation and the rise of the Christian right.

Sorry to post rave related material, folks. I'll keep it short, I promise ;)

Audio Impact:

I had just way too much dancing last night! I've been dying to hear
some good, hard jungle for a while now, and last night certainly
provided that fix. For the most part, when I've heard jungle at
parties, it has usually been of the softer variety...

I had no idea who the DJ's were by sight or sound, and I really
couldn't tell when the turntables would change hands, either. But to
tell the truth, I didn't care! I was too busy pounding my body down to
the ground :) As usual, I heard the sounds of jungle, and it just
_moved_ me, without my control or knowledge. Only jungle (and Goa) can
make me forget about what I'm doing and where I am.

The music at times was noisy, almost creepy and industrial sounding
(in a jungle kind of way), which was fine by me. I love the more
melodic sounds we get in SF, but every now and then I just need
something hard and destructive. But then, I'm an ex-industrial
head anyway, so it's not surprising.

The vibe was kind of weird; for the most part people were cool, having
fun etc. But the presence of alcohol at the party brought along its
negative effects. My major complaint were people who didn't understand
the concept of respecting someone else's personal space. There were
many times that I would be dancing, and then some large human would
*stand* right in front of me, preventing any further motion. How
irritating!  But instead of complaining, I eventually decided to
assert my territory (yes, it was like *that* at times), and using as
much room as I needed.

But the people who were clearly ravers/jungle people were very cool,
and there was a really fun energy in the place. So for the most part,
it was a great vibe with patches of crap sprinkled throughout...
But then, that's just the "bar" element creeping in, so it's all good :)

Anyway, I'm really glad this is a weekly! Our city really needs more
jungle, and many thanks to the B.A.S.S. crew and Hunab Ku for helping
to make it happen.

Now back to your regularly scheduled ranting...

Steve

We are not talking about dividing people we are taling about equal oppertunity
in the work force.

Well, these classifications were made by the owners of plantations years ago, they were
mostly instantiated into law in the southern states.  The truth of the matter is that there are
very few people in the south who are of totally pure european descent, but they then the rules
don't
have to be fair when you control the power base, this is the crux of the biscuit.

Don't be stupid, it makes us all descendents of Africa. As far as people of color it too is
subjective.
POC is more or less a term used to lable the group of people who are discriminated against by 
the powerbase (which happens to be euro-centric) simply because of their skin tone (generally
darker).

Hmm I wonder if it was because many southern and eastern europeans are darker
then the northern ones...

Is this so,  200 years ago black people in this company enjoyed full employment :)
we worked without wages but all was provided, now not just blacks work on the plantation but
instead of a sack of corn meal you get a little piece of paper and you have to go out and buy your
own damn corn meal!

Please limit the discussion to the US or A.  Indeed I am fully aware of european history in this

but we are discussing the issues on this continent.

Actually you are right as far as europe goes, as many of you who have seen my post
in the past know, I talk about Dominator culture not European culture as being the culprets.
The first thing that this culture did was to murder all of the Europeans that disagreed with it.
It raised it's ugly head in force in the 1930 but is still lurking around. 

But we digress, please keep the topic on the good ol US of A, land of the free and home of the
brave.

How about special consideration on the basis of sex. Are you saying that women who make up
51% of the US population just don't exhibit appropriate leadership tendencies? Why is it that
White women don't have an equal share in the spoils?  Is the syetem fair to them as it stands now?

Subject: 2 cents on 209.....
Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

my opinion is that although the spirit of 209 is good "end discrimination",
it relies on the assumption that merit based hiring/acceptence to school is
unbiased.

all tests are biased. it is widely held that people do better on tests that
were written by people of their own ethnic backround or experience.

timothy leary proved this...while he was incarcerated for a fu**kked up
marijuana charge, he was administered a psychological test to see what kind
of danger he posed to society.  based on the results of this test, he was
transfferred to a minimum security prison which he promptly escaped from and
he ventured to mexico (he wrote the test himself while he was at Stanford
he he hee)

moral: you can't rely on tests to tell you very much b/c it depends who
writes them.

does anyone experience this phenomena:

while white people are becomming a minority? less than 50% (not really a
minority b/c they still far outnumber each individual group) they still
comprise about 85% of the corporate spots  at my job.  is this b/c they are
more qualified.

possible solution:  base ethnic/gender hiring process on percentages
generated from the last census. i'm sure that the level quality of employee
will not drop.  this is b/c PEOPLE are qualified b/c they are people, not
b/c they went to this private school or that.  i'm not dissin' private
schools, on the contrary, i wish every child could afford private school b/c
of the excellent advantages it provides.  sadly, this is not the case.  

letting my logic down for a second and speaking from my irrational heart....

if i was asian i would be mortified by prop 209.  although not every asian
group benefits from affirmative action directly, i would consider the fact
that with more people of color in higher positions, the easier it would be
to break thru the glass ceiling that consistantly denies QUALIFIED asian
people top spots in the corporate world.......

if i was a women i would feel normal b/c women always get the short end of
the deal whatever color.

if i was black then 209 would say to me that it's all good and fair.
nevermind the last four hundred years, it's all good now right? bullshit

since i am chicano prop 209 erases the fact that the u.s. generated most of
its wealth in the last 100 years from land that the u.s. annexxed from you
know who

if i was white, i wouldn't trip off affirmative action,  i would still get
mines b/c i am qualified and nothing will ever stop me.

look people, i know that affirmative action is very flawed, but it is
necessary to promote numbers which go toward reflecting the percentages in
the general population.  just like welfare, it is vital to our nation. you
wouldn't want to scrap welfare w/out putting something else in its place
would you?

if you answered yes to the last question then you probably still think that
jesus was white and i don't want to talk to you anyways.........i still love
all you peoples.... 
when asked whether he was a raver or a clubber ringo answered, "i'ma rubber."

Dear all,

I'm considering upgrading my computer system, part of which includes
getting a new motherboard & CPU.  I am currently looking at two options,
either getting a cyrix P166 or a Pentium 90 that has an overdrive chip on
it bringing it up to a Pentium 150.  So I have a few questions:

1) What speed does the motherboard for a Pentium 90 run at, 60 or 66MHz?

2) How does the speed of an overdrive Pentium 150 compare with that of an
actual Pentium 150 chip?

3) I know that cyrix chips are pretty weak on their FPU, and I'm going to
be doing some things that involve 3D graphics.  What kind of speed loss
can I expect with a cyrix chip, and would the overdriven Pentium 150 end
up being faster for things like that?

Thanks a bunch,
Mr. Jake

I have heard this as well but I don't know of any hard facts or stats. 
The following Timothy Leary example does not fit this criteria as
somehow who actually made the test rather just having someone of the
same ethnicity make the test.  Of course someone who makes the test is
going to do well on that test when they take it later.

It also depends on who takes them, like people who get test anxiety or
who have some learning disabilities.  Though lots of universities now
recognize these deficiencies in the testing process and make
arrangements for people with these problems, like giving them more time
and such.

This would be a quota system and there are lots of problems when you
start having to meet quotas.  I am just saying this as my opinion, I
don't have anything to back it up.

People are just people but that doesn't make them qualified to be the
president of the US or anything.  And private schools aren't all that
you seem to think they are either.  If a person is intelligent I think
they will do just as well in a public school as in a private...(atleast
I have come out alright  :)  )

not true, white women are the single biggest benefactors of affirmative
action by far.  Again I don't have any stats to back this up, but it is
a well known phenomena.

> if i was white, i wouldn't trip off affirmative action,  i would still get

Just ask a lot of white business men that contract with the government
or other firms that sign contracts using affirmative action guidelines. 
I am sure they will let you know that affirmative action has destroyed
or last hurt their business quite a bit.  Now that government isn't
supposed to base contracts on minority owned companies they are going to
be hurt.  So either way someone will be hurt.

The best affirmative action would be based on economic situation and not
ethnicity.  If I am poor and I do good on tests or in school or whatever
then yeah I probably should be hired over the rich person who got about
the same score on the test.  He had more resources available than me yet
he didn't do any better so yes I should be hired over him.  This is the
kind of affirmative action I would like to see put into place (and for
once I agree with Bob Dole who also said he would like an economically
based affirmative action plan)

If you really think that these figures represent what is actually paid out, 
you are badly deluded.  There are so many tax shelters and exemptions, many 
of which cannot be realized by the middle and lower income citizens, that 
the rich in reality pay hardly anything.  The WSJ figures are based on tax 
tables, not on reality.

Just to make this rave related, I am sad to see how raving became more

I will not accept responsibility for things that I have not done. If you

No, this avoids being a quota system. Reread what I have stated is going
on. People are getting extra points on tests. This is not the same as 15% 
of employees must be such and such a race and so on. I have the facts
straight, however you simply refuse to acknowledge them.

I don't know where you get the impression that I am an immigrant. I am
not. However my background is not one of rich landed gentry, but of
working class immigrants(a few generations ago) and a bit of Sioux. Thanks
for the invitation though.

At that is and was wrong. You can vote, and I assume did. All I see from

didn't, so I am going to be mad about that."

The government cannot legislate resentment, ignorance, and misconception
away. You can hower legislate these things into being, through
discriminatory laws.

The best affirmative action should IDEALLY be based on a combination of
both economics AND race because, unfortunately, the numbers are
disproportianate.  WHITES are still OVERREPRESENTED while minority
populations increase.  What kind of fairness is that?  and why? because
the majority have limited access to resouces that others have.  I know I
did.  I made the most of it due to affirmative action.  It gives people
the chance to prove themselves as being COMPETENT.  No, I was not
insulted that I got into school through affirmative action.  I KNOW I
studied in high school but I also had to work so my scores might've
suffered while many priveleged kids had fewer worries or time
constraints and could concentrate on school more.  In college, I NEVER
cheated and I graduated with a B+ average.  AM I "UNDERQUALIFIED"?  NO! 
I did better than my more privileged counterparts.  Giving these
opportunities to people is the best investment towards EQUALITY.
Wouldn't you agree that's NOBLE?  WE DON'T HAVE EQUALITY YET SO LET'S
NOT DELUDE OURSELVES INTO THINKING WE DO.  We must correct the mistakes
our government has made in the past, even if it is a little unfair to
SOME, it would still benefit the country on a larger scale.  SOME
affirmative action is better than NO affirmative action.  Everyone stop
thinking of THEMSELVES personally and think about how inner-city school
kids will NEVER have the same shot at, say, getting into an Ivy League,
than the children of white upper middle-class, or even middle class for
that matter.  Prop 209 is saying they do.  Has any one ever thought
about that?  Or how scary to be aligned with the same mentality as Newt
Gingrich?  Everything he stands for is so wacked and backwards.  And no
matter how you look at it, Prop. 209 is CONSERVATIVE, basically
attempting to CONSERVE the ESTABLISHMENT (ie. WHITE/MALE/UPPER
MIDDLE-CLASS).  It's really sad.
I love all people and I'm not anti-white, I swear I'm not.  I have so
much love in my heart but this issue is soooo important to me.  It means
so much for future generations.  I mean no disrespect.  But when we have
so much diversity, then we HAVE TO have it REPRESENTED, even if it is at
the expense of some, it will benefit millions.  Besides,  so much of the
past was created at the expense of minorities.

PEACE, PEACE, PEACE, PEACE.........................................

However, do you really feel that this guy was somehow a racist as a result
of the passing of 209? Sounds like just another ignorant asshole who
doesn't get it.

Why "OOPS" Geoff? Speaking for myself I voted for 209 so that all people
would be viewed on their merit. If 95% of a school is Asian as a result,
so be it, if they are the most qualified. So why the "OOPS?"

And this is a *very* important point. It is a problem of economics, and
dealing with it as such transends race and sex differences.

Also, I would like to thank you Geoff, in the midst of all the flamage
going on, for being pretty damn level-headed about the whole issue.

Ok don't get me wrong. Prop 215 is at least a step.  What I understand of 
the proposition, is that a doctor can only recommend cultivating your 
own.  What does this mean? Is this then only a verbal prescription, or is 
there some sort of document that clearly gives a patient the right?  How 
is Mr/Ms Police Officer while checking out your lil garden going to 
verify your RIGHT to grow.  The recommendation process sounds too vague.  
The 'shady' feel I was talking about would be a doctor telling a patient 
to take this drug but since its an illegal drug you have to get it or 
grow it at your own risk of harassment.  I assume most of the people that 
subscribe to this list, partake in gatherings where use of this same 
substance is openly accepted.... Its probably still my favorite.

American society doesn't openly accept weed.  What if a patient is not 
amongst the raving community, the alternative crowd, whatever.  How does this 
person feel when only a RECOMMENDATION is given.  Meanwhile there doctor 
would be able to prescribe narcotics no problem that can than be picked 
up at the drug store.  As we both probably agree, those narcotics are 
most likely overkill.  Prop 215 is a good thing...just nowhere near what 
I think needs to be done.

Sorry to be racially polluting your scene..this reminds me of all the shit 
older white people who grew up in San Francisco use to talk.."it was 
such a nice place to live, but now it's all Asian and black, etc...bla bla 
bla" but I guess they're bigots and your not?
(it's ironic i sometimes get really bummed about the lack of racial 
diversity at some really nice u.g. parties..but there might be a more polite 
way to expres it than you did)

Once again we proved the power of a good set and incredible vibes. What's
better than a small obscure rave? An even smaller rave that takes the form
of an X-party.

The Bravo Co. put on a beautiful and intimate X-party. We used a large
Japanese lantern on one corner of the dance floor and painted sperm heading
towards it. A la blacklights said sperm were hovering above the crazed
dancers' heads all night and some enthusiasts jumped up to try to grab those
things all night. 
What made it was the energy running through the whole place. It was _the_
perfect vibe. Everyone was beautiful, people danced all night and we've
never experienced that much happiness save in that chill room and on that
dance floor that night. Nothing will ever be the same again.

It's ruined other parties for us.
But anyways, we just wanted to share our happiness and to tell you all that
the best parties can be those right smack in your home.

Love and Kisses,
Meera & Maly

	After work and a really boring C++ class the only thing I was
looking forward to was Wish - Mars and MYSTR-E, couple beers and
dancing.....

	Two of my friends and I got there around 10:30pm.  The space was
empty and for a while I was getting worried that not that many people will
show up and that everybody went to ComeUnity.  One of my friends even
mentioned ComeUnity, but somehow Garth & Jeno vs. Mars & MYSTR-E...  I just
couldn't do it :).

	Mars came on @11pm and I have to admit - every time two of them are
spinning I alway want to hear MYSTR-E more, but every single time Mars just
surprises me more and more and I think "Wow, this time it's Mars who will
keep me dancing all night."  His set was great and I left my friends and
danced in front by myself (I usually don't do that).  MYSTR-E came on and
he was better than I remembered (although I do have his tape....).
Incredible :).  I just couldn't stop and I was really sad when my friends
dragged me out of there at 1:30am.  I just wanted to stay and keep
dancing...

	I hope there will be more parties coming up with them spinning,
because personally I am loving every moment of it - I even said that if I
ever had a wedding reception I would beg them to spin at it :P.
	Actually my B-Day is coming up and MYSTR-E and Jon Carol will be
spinning that night - if Mars could just sneak in - it couldn't get better.

	By the time we left, the space had enough happy people dancing
around.  I ended up having 5, not couple beers and I must admit I had hard
time getting up this morning to go to work...  But, I also realized that I
like dancing and drinking beer - it puts me in a different world :).

	I did notice that there were showing "Star Wars" again - this is
2nd time in a row that I've been there.  Don't get me wrong - I like the
move, but somehow I don't really want to see it every time I am at the
party there.

Looking forward to more good parties,
*B*

P.S.  How was that jungle party last night - Steve I heard you went - post
a review if you have time

     I think the simple maxim/rule of thumb seems to be : "The 
     bigger/louder/more garish the flyer is the more crap/lame/sad the 
     party will be...", I collect flyers whoch I consider to be 
     aesthetically pleasing but have certainly come across some flyers that 
     can only be described as UGLY. That one for a party called 
     "blitzkreig" particularly springs to mind....
     
     Any nominations for an UGLY FLYER TOP TEN ?

        Junglism in the area ! I'll be there at the next one bud. I'm tired of 
wishy washy house nights. Best BM memory : me & 2 other strangers dancing at the
Spaz collective at sunrise on Monday morning to sweet Jungle toons. 

Wicked !

Audio Impact:
     
I had just way too much dancing last night! I've been dying to hear 
some good, hard jungle for a while now, and last night certainly 
provided that fix. For the most part, when I've heard jungle at 
parties, it has usually been of the softer variety...

Hmmmmmmm?!?!?!  I can't take any more studying or my brain is going to

 Well, if you take into consideration that Dr.Freeclouds lost over
$10,000.00 on that busted party, I don't know if you'd be calling it
lame. I'm not one to attend hardcore events, but they got royaly screwed
over from the property owner who called the police after he saw all of
the crazy kids walking onto his property that was ALREADY rented and
paid for... And then they lost even MORE cash on the free make-up party
they threw for those who had tickets.


Just like what their motto says:
			   "Support those who support you."

I guess some couldn't give less of a shit...


 What's aesthetically pleasing to you, may not be to someone else. Every
flyer doesn't have to be liquid pyramids floating over a distorted
purple lake. Jeez, aren't we all geting sick of that kinda crap that's
so often touted as computer generated art? Looks more like pushing the
demo key on your new poser program.

 Sorry to be so rude. The owners of Dr.Freeclouds are friends, and they
have a huge thorn in their side after 'Bustkrieg' happened. It wasn't
very pretty....

        Sorry,I was talking about the flyer art and knew nothing about the cops 
busting the event or the property owner obviously being a schizophrenic flake. 
Btw, surely your friends had some sort of legal stance to take regarding the 
venue owner. But the flyers alone must have cost a fortune...they were huge. I 
just wasn't into the War imagery, that's all. Bad vibes 'n' all that....

     I think the simple maxim/rule of thumb seems to be : "The
     bigger/louder/more garish the flyer is the more crap/lame/sad the
     party will be...", I collect flyers whoch I consider to be
     aesthetically pleasing but have certainly come across some flyers that
     can only be described as UGLY. That one for a party called
     "blitzkreig" particularly springs to mind....

     Any nominations for an UGLY FLYER TOP TEN ?

I would have to say the New Year Cool World flyer (er, magazine insert)
is the most atrocious thing since . . . LAST year's Cool World New Year's
flyer/thingie!

 That's ok. And yes, the flyers did cost a fortune. I guess there may
not have been many of the other ones floating around the Bay area. The
one flier was a war representation, while the other was the psychedelic
version. They were goingfor the whole good vs evil thing. You're not
alone though...many were discouraged and even outraged by the flyers.

Many disagree with what Jesse Jackson says and does, but one thing is
completely clear, he is anything but a "hate monger and racist," and
Black Adder owes this list an apology for such a careless slur.

I will tell my own personal Jesse Jackson story to anyone who wishes tio
hear it in email.  

In the meantime, I have been buttoning my lip during this storm of 
political postings.  I do politics for a living, sfraves is my place to
go beyond that.  I'm disappointed in the self-indulgence that has gone
on here the last few days.  One or at most two comments from any given
person on a question of the day, whether 209 or 215 or whatever, is
more than enough.  

Thank you.

Really great turnout for a weeknite jungle party:)

We got there about 10:00 and Thad was laying down some smooth dark
plates. The sound system was pretty trick: four-corner system with
plenty of bass. After we made a quick sojourn to Vesuvio, we re-entered
to find the floor PACKED and Flux dropping the bombs. The sound got
jacked up and you could hear it a block away down kearney.

Jason Mouse came on next and really got the place jumping...literally.
His stuff was smooth and deep...really deep. I could not stop dancing,
even though my legs were getting worked. But then again, neither could
anyone else:) His mixes were so fast and spot-on, he's an example to any
drum'n bass dj.

It was cool to see some familiar faces around. MArk E Quark, recent San
Diego transplant was hanging out and seemed pretty impressed. The one
negative to teh evening was when a little fight broke out around 1am. It
only lasted a second, but i got pushed from behind and sent half a glass
of water flying towards Dutch...ooops...glad he was quick and got mostly
out of the way:]

So big up to the BASS Kru and everyone who came out to support the
scene.

-peace-

For a long time, voting had been restricted to those who were above a 
certain age. A long time ago, this probably was a decent method of 
clearing the polls of people who used propositions and elections to serve 
their own means. After a certain amount of time of plowing the fields and 
getting stuck in storms with only your neighbors to help, you had a 
better sense of what the community needed. Laws were voted on by the 
people they affected because the distinction between local, county, state 
and federal was a little clearer.
	Today, we have filled in most of those spaces and most of the
voters out there have been raised on TV (yes, even you 40 year olds who
watch the news and political ads in my opinion are being raised on TV). 
Somewhere, it seems people have stopped voting on what they believe this 
country is/was about and what is good for them. No longer are your 
neighbors free from your scruntity (and if they are not free from your 
scruntity, why are you free from theirs?). No longer are citizens of the 
United States free from religous persecution - Try getting an abortion 
in some states and see if you are "free" of religious presecution, or 
going to school and taking the required Pledge of Allegence...
	I don't really know how this presidental race was portrayed on TV 
because I do not have a TV, but I have heard people talking about money 
thrown into advertising and shifts in the polls from my coworkers. And I 
begin to wonder. My curosity becomes stronger after listening to some of 
the discussions that have taken place on this list. And to me, does not 
sound like people want to fix things, they only want to move blame for 
the state of things to someone else.

>>>> Begin specifics, skip to next >>>> if this gets boring

	How are things going to get fixed without taxes?! And who can 
actually take a higher tax hit? Those who make $450K on the golf course 
with no one leaning over their shoulder demanding they get in earlier and 
stay later or those who make 25K and do not have moeny for anything but 
rent, fod, and transportation money to and from work? Maybe I should 
be allowed to delegate how my taxes are spent, because I do not see 
why my tax dollars should go to piping water down into a desert to 
make golf courses green, to drug law enforcement, to putting extra 
cops on the beat in upper class areas that do not need it, or to 
"improving" the high network when I believe that the money should go to 
an improvement in public transportation. But I have little say in the 
matter bcause the majority of people elected representitives that wanted 
those things and since I can pay rent, eat, and pay my transportation 
fees and maybe a little on the side to drive to butfuck nowhere and camp 
and put on a party or two while on there, I do not NEED that money and I 
will vote next time to hopefully get people in office that will support 
my beliefs for what society needs (which is not equalitant to what >I< 
need). Maybe between now and then, I may talk with one or two people and 
bring up a point and it will make them think about an issue and they will 
look at it and decide to vote instead of following an ad on TV which said 
YES on Prop 203474...
	How is going to Pacific Heights and roiting going to change the
snotty whites images of blacks and latinos? Or is it going to just give
them a basis for their fears?! The TV raises us well, fear those who do
bad, and those who do bad are like this. Now those on TV who do bad are 
coming out here and beging shitty, TV was right, they are bad, we need 
protection from them, and they have no place in OUR society. On the flip 
side, how many people have gone down to
a "shitty"  neighborhood and seen what its like? And why do those people
who have not, believe that the shitty areas are so bad? When I lived on 
63rd and Market in Oakland, we would sit on the roof of our warehouse and 
listen to the gun shots at night in the area, but you know, I knew the 
names of my neighbors, and they left us to our own likess without peering 
over the fence to see if we were breaking the law (if they were peering 
over the fence it was because we had music on and they wanted us to come 
open the door and let them in). I remember one night when I had locked 
myself out when dumping the trash with bare feet and was walking round to 
the other side to punch in the code and this group and hardass guys 
is following me, and they say something about my feet and I shoot some 
sarcasasm back and they continue the banter and we part laughing. Had I 
treated them as hardasses, would it have been the same? But then there 
are places where if I had done that, I would have been picking a fight, 
my opponents would also have been white instead of black...

>>>> End specific

	So, a long time ago, people knew what community was, and when they
knew enough about the community and what they were voting for, they could
vote, back then it was only the man who would have voted if he were in a
family (and who was not in a family by the age of 21 when you died at
45?). I don't know, I wasn't there. Today, nobody knows what community is
(at least the majority of us American types do not seem to) and no one
seems to read what they are voting for. Why should we be allowed to vote
then? I am here today, and it seems silly to vote for things you have no 
idea what you are voting for....

Every few months I go and it's great to see how many people are willing to dance till 4-5 am and go to work the next day, I mean you have to love to dance(maybe this is why despite it being at 1015 the vibe is nice)..Garth got people jumpin with some crazy tribal-drummin-house and strange-thumpin-dubness, it was packed as usual.

I will never apologize for such a statement to you, him, or anyone else.
Do you really have such a short memory as to not remember his famous
"Hymietown" remarks? These were made in a semi-public forum. I wonder
what he says in private.

Not at all accurate. The wording of this proposition was necessary in
order to prevent programs that did discriminate for reasons of sex,
color, ethnicity, or nation origin.

No to the first question, and yes to the second. All one can do is to vote
against government sanctioned discrimination. You cannot legislate the
discrimination in peoples heads away.

Absolutely.

And all very valid thoughts. What I get from your statement is 209 did not
go far enough in furthering the cause of fairness. And given your points I
would agree.

the blitzkrieg flyer has good production behind it (good design, good
balance, good colour, good objects). just because it has bombs on it
doesn't make it ugly.. besides, they was another version _without_ bombs
that looked great.
which is more than i can say for most of the flyers i see. you want bad
flyers? look to ghosttribe. *cough*.

anyone can make a flyer with poser, photoshop, and kai's powertools. shit,
i'm not an artist and i can whip up stuff that'll make you feel like you're
on acid. big deal. that does _so_ not impress me.

want something impressive? check out the Famtasia flyer by mike migurski.
it's small, but it's one of the top flyers i've seen all year..

personally, human happiness is a lot more important to me than "fairness".

if someone who makes a million dollars a year has to give 50% of it to the
government, (s)he still is bringing home 25 times as much money as i am
every year. (s)he probably also owns a very nice house with a lot of very
nice stuff.

there is no justification for letting people starve in the street. i don't
care how much of a slacker someone is, how uneducated they may be... being
penniless when there are people rolling in money on the other side of town
is a misery no one should have to endure.

if we could become less absorbed with "fairness" and "equality"and focus on
human happiness & peace & love & understanding & caring & kindness, i think
our society would end up being much more "fair", and a better place for all
to live.

but that's just my 2 cents, and 2 cents won't buy you bubble gum anymore,
let alone an idealistic vision.

love,

brian

How long ago did you graduate from school? Did you go to a public school?
I went to a private school in Latin America for my first three years of 
high school, and then transferred to a pubilc school in Minnesota. I was 
amazed at how incredibly apathetic and generally uniformed these people 
were. At my previous school we had a very limited exposure to 
resources... our library still used a card catalog for the small number 
of outdated books we had. Yet this school had even more obsolete books. 
Departments were eliminated because supplies couldn't be bought.
Certain things that were considered standard to a decent education were 
sorely lacking at this school.

The cost required for education is a lot greater than 25 years ago. 
Computer education is now considered necessary--but how many people 
actually receive any sort of instruction? How many schools can actually 
buy computers? How many schools even have a room to put them in?
There are also many social factors that have arisen in 25 years.

I worked at an inner city elementary school in San Diego, doing tutoring 
and mentoring for fourth and fifth graders. This neighborhood consisted 
primarily of immigrants from Somalia, Ethiopia, Mexico, and various Asian 
countries. How does a child learn how to multiply (and other -basic- 
skills) if they can't communicate with the teacher? I was speaking in 
Spanish more than anything else. They also arrive with the stresses of 
trying to adapt to a new social, mulitcultural environment. The school 
didn't have the resources to teach them English to where they could 
communicate with their instructors, much less their peers. How could a 
fifth grader not know how to subtract? The middle school they moved on to 
had a very high rate of gangsterism. In fact, one girl, aged fourteen, 
was interviewed on [talk show name here] about her ability to point a gun 
and shoot it.

I don't know much about LA parties, but they sure generate some enormous
flyers.  I have one recent "flyer" (Chemistry) which is actually an 11x17
poster, folded.  A more modest flyer for the same event is about 4x11.  I
have another which is a strip about two feet long and six inches high, sure
to entertain those who find drug references gauche: the party is
"Wake-n-Bake," the slogan "Flowers Blooming...Speakers Booming...People
Shrooming."  Then there's the elaborate folding cardstock flyer for
Nocturnal Wonderland, which is actually kind of neat.  They don't seem
generally much better or worse, design-wise, than what we see up here, but
there is a tendency towards more size and bombast.  Of course, I see a lot
more SF than LA flyers.

As far as ugly goes, I don't see many I'd really call that, though there
are a lot that are uninteresting.  A flyer for Other Whirled at the End Up
earlier this year was weak, a bunch of clumsy CG...they might still have
the poster up on the wall, but I haven't been for a while.  The flyer for
this weekend's That Girl Mona is pretty bad in several ways.  Last
January's Plastik flyer was OK on one side, revolting on the other.
Out-A-Sight flyers have a distinctive style which is usually pretty cool,
but the one from this past May falls down badly.  The design or picture
side is OK, not as good as others, but turn it over to the info side...ugh.
Somewhere I have a terrible flyer from Limelight in NY.

It was the first day of class after summer for a first grade class.  
The teacher, of course, went around the room asking each student what 
they did for the summer.
     
First grader number 1:  "We visited my Nana this summer."
The teacher:  "Well, we are all in first grade now. No need to talk 
baby talk. You didn't visit your Nana you visited you GRANDMA this 
summer."
     
First grader number 2: "We visited a farm this summer and we milked a 
Moo-Moo."                       
The teacher: "Now what did I say?  I said we are all big boys and girls 
and we don't need to talk baby talk.  You went to a farm and milked a 
COW."
     
First grader number 3: "I read a book this summer." 
The teacher: "Which book did you read?"
The first grader:  "Winnie the Shit"

Fair enough. I don't mean that it got whiter and whiter and the scene 
sucked. I meant it makes me sad that I remember it being far more 
diverse, and then it gradually became less.

Then the people I remember put the raves on who were Chicano stoped 
raving altogether. Then people began to say , "Oh, I hate those Cholo 
there. I wish they wouldn't come." And all the nice things they say about 
the latin influenced techno. 

I understand the dislike of Cholos etc, and the possiblilty of violence 
when they participare are definately higher than when they are not. But I 
felt a lot of people would see any Mexican at a rave and term them as 
Cholo. If you (as a plural) don't do it great. Pat your self on the back, 
but if you do, you know think about it. Are you sure the person next to 
you in line is really a gangster (I mean Baggy and shaved head is in). Or 
otherwise. 

I have to say there were moments in my life that I thought that. Then one 
day I was in a rave and there were a big bunch of what I assumed to be 
Cholos etc, and we started dancing and I thought about it long and hard, 
and I realised why my friends stopped raving. People would assume them to 
be dangerous and they were ignored by other non chicano/as.

Here more polite, elaborated responce.

Whoa, for a couple hours there, I got caught up in the election spirit and
almost believed.  Those guys looked like they were trying pretty hard, and

I believe: every day is election day, really.  It's in how you spend your

     Hi all :
     
     I would like to rent a room in the upper/lower Haight, Cole Valley, 
     Wetern addition area.
     I've been in my present place in upper Haight about a year, and while 
     it's a beautiful apartment there are lifestyle differences with my 
     roomates. I'm in no rush to find somewhere as I want to find the right 
     place.
     Hardwood floors, roof/lawn access, fireplace, parking would all be 
     nice.
     Can afford up to $500 per month.
     Dont want to party every night (or every week as I seem to do now).
     Pets/smoking/sex OK :) 
     
     COH

K OK, I've been dying to say this.

        First off, I'm German, Swedish, Slavik, Czeck, and whatever. And
yes, I'm white. Despite being raised my whole life around mostly racist
people, I've never developed an attitude that anyone is any less than me
because of their ethnicity. 

        Now a couple things that piss me off:

                I hate racists of all types.

                I've met more Black Racists than I have white. (That chick
from the fugees said something in an interview about how she never wants a
white person to buy thier album)

                UPN 44 is basically an all black tv station during prime
time on certain days.

                There's the BET channel.

                Everyone would shit a brick if there was the White
Entertainment Channel, or the hawaiian channel. Granted there are channels
for hispanic and indian, but they're not for people who don't speak the
language.

                Every movie by a black producer portrayes the white man as
"the bad guy", "the dork", "the idiot". Like on movies like house party, and
any spike lee movie, or movies like higher education or whatever.

                There are KKK wannabees, and people who try to mimic the nazis.

                People idolize "heroic" figures who resorted in violence and
destruction to supposedly help their race. They wear hats, shirts, and
whatever without understanding what the person did.

                There are too many people using PRIDE as an excuse to be stupid.

                There are too many shops around our area which are built in
the interest of one minority.

                No one does anything about anything.

                I have seriously racist "acquaintences" (x-friends) of whom
I'd rather pick a complete stranger over in the case of a fight. And they're
dragging in my once best friend with them.

                People need to stop making excuses, and they need to stop
teaching others the WRONG things without knowing the RIGHT way to go about
it. Meaning ideals.

                I'm just pissed at all the racists who think that they can't
be racists because they're been repressed all these years.


So the world is actually doomed. Or at least not for the Rich.

Don't take this against me.

Aryck

>Subject:     Systematic Racism part II.

OK, I've had enough.  Both sides, take it off the list.

None of you are listening
I don't think you understand each other
You're certainly not accepting each other
so for god sake, get a hug!

I've been reading this stuff all week, and tonight I chased my cat around 
the house for taking a swipe at my face.  The vibe from the active 
participants of this discussion is bring me down, and I no longer wish to 
partake.  Must I unsub, or will you take it elsewhere?

I don't want to avoid it, I just can't stand lack of progress this thread 
is making.  And besides, email is the worst communication medium with the 
narrowest back-channel information for discussing such a personal issue.

Next party, let's sit down with a loaded bong, and TALK WITH each other!

peace and love (and may my cat forgive me)

My current crusade is against anyone wearing those damn swooshes on

Well,  I for one,  was at Blitzkrieg,  and up until it got busted,  the
party was GREAT!!!   Of course,  I'm a fan of hardcore....   But anyways,
the land owner actually called the police on his own party.    He took $3000
for renting the land for the party,   then called the police and told them
he wanted everyone off his land.    To make a long story short,  Dr Freecloud
has filed a lawsuit to recover his loss.....

On another rave related note....   My tapes are almost ready,  and they are
supposed to be delivered sometime in few days or next week.

Yes, I posted the figures for comparing wealth.  Here are the figures for
comparing income according to the US Census, 1994 data. (availible at:
http://www.census.gov/ftp/pub/hhes/income/incineq/p60tb1.html)

             Number   Lowest  Second    Third   Fourth  Highest   Top  5   
Year        (thous.)   fifth   fifth    fifth    fifth     fifth percent   
1994../21/..69,313      4.2     10.0     15.7     23.3     46.9     20.1 

Looks like the top third earns, in income, about two thirds of all income in
the US.  No surprise based on that that they pay 2/3 of the taxes.

Keep in mind, though, that the wealthiest protion of the US makes most of
their money not in income, but in property, stocks, bonds, and other capital
investments.  This income is easily sheltered, and is taxed at a different
rate.  Lower, for large capital gains, than for income.

The wealthy also get in tax breaks than the poor got in subsidies in 94.
This cleft has increased over the past couple years.  The Center for Popular
Economics (Amherst) estimates that when we consider direct benefits and tax
breaks -- masked welfare payments -- an average household with income under
$10,000 receives about 60% of the welfare provided to households with income
over $100,000. 

Details:  

Food Stamps in 1993:  $25 billion (to be dramatically reduced next year)
Welfare and family support(1993): $16 billion
Supplemental security income (poor, elderly, disabled:): $21 billion

Compare:  

Deductions for interest payments, mostly mortgage payments (80% to familes
with incomes over  $50,000, skewed more radically toward the higher reaches):  
$49 Billion
Farm price supports: $16 billion 

Michael Wines, _New York Times_, Nov 20, 1994:  Total payments to the poor
"add up to less than the three largest tax breaks that benefit the middle
class and wealthy: deductions for retirement plans, the deduction for home
mortgage interest and the exemption of health-insurance premiums that
companies pay for their employees."

Yes this is distressing to me as well, parties are fragmenting allong racial/cultural lines.
Some of it unfortunately has to do with musical preferences (Harder trance music usually prefered
by male europeans, vocal house prefered by mostly gay men, to name too extremes) But I guess in america
this has always been the case, I grew up listening to soul music in the 60's, by the late 60's and 70's
I discovered "progressive rock" and almost exclusively listened to music that was considered "white",
as the 80's rilled around I got into Jazz Fusion which basically knew no color demarcation since it was not
mass marketed and therefore appealed only to a relatively small number of people (though in my mid-new england
college, most of the people that listened to this type of music were black, asian and "kool" white people, alot 
of bridges wee made through music, that is one thing I can say.

As far as house music, it is following the same lines as must american cultural music phenomena,
Initial innovation by African Americans who incorporate some existing musical styles and elaborate on it.
(We can start with straight house and then clearly see the influence of euro-beat groups like Kraftwerk,
Tangerine Dream, etc), the music is generally picked up by kool in-touch europeans (maybe because 
cultural creations by blacks here are not valued?) and elaborated upon, once kids in europe think it's kool it
then bounces back to here and kool white kids in america adopt it. (This seemed to happen in the early days of
rock and roll,  where the black groups were prety popular in the black community here, some of the more successful
toured europe (little richard, etc.) The Beatles were initially fameous in europe for being "white guys" who did covers
of black R & B groups, eventually they added there own distinct mark on this music (rubber soul :).  In the early
days of the SF rave scene house music was still pretty unaccessable unless you were gay or at least not afraid to
party with gay people,  early clubs like recess opened this music up to a wide group of people Gay, Straight, Black
White, old, young.  Later on , partiies like Toon Town made it even more accessable though the crowd started to become
more straight, younger and whiter, but at that time there was still House Nation and that ment unity.

Today the music has fragmented, there are so many different classifications and rarely do you have a party where all types of music
are played, that's why I have to take my hat off to FTT (dry mouth and all :) for executing a massive
the likes of I haven't seen since Toon Town, where there was something for every persuasion and the crowd was
incredibly diverse.  Now don't get me wrong, if you love Goa deep in your soul and want to attend Goa parties,
that DOES NOT make you a seperatist (unless you are :) or if you are truly moved only by wailing Divas that doesn't
make you a racist, but ask yourself, isn't raving suppose to be about bring ALL of the cultures, people, races of the
world together in the context of party and family?  Openmindedness and tolerence are major aspects of this,
if the Goa DJ is on and you don't like Goa, maybe it's time to go to the chill room and get to know that new friend better.
If someone plays a vocal, then maybe it's time to take a bathroom break.  I think it's time that we as a group begin to
show the way when it comes to this kind of thing.

So Yvonne don't give up hope, it's obvious to me that I need to throw a party where all musical styles can be represented.
I don't know how I will manage to do this with my already busy schedule but I guess "Love can move Mountains"

See you on the Dance Floor

Well, the fact we're arguing about it shows you really have no choice.
fact is, we're all part of previous historical wrongs.  Saying your people,
your ancestors had nothing to do with it doesn't help the fact that it
affects you.  You can't just wish history away.  However, you can take
corrective measures.

Everyone on this rock in an immigrant.  Even indegenous people came from

At my college there are more people of color, propertionatly, then there
is in every single higher education institution in England combined.  What
the fuck is everyone complaining about?  People round here have already
got it to good to be true but that is not enough for them and they still
complain like spoilt children.  If 52% of my college is women then they
don't need affirmative action. 
Don't forget that the real sickness that affirmative action should try to
cure is one of poverty and not ethical denomination.  If you are poor you
will do less well at college, reguardless of your ethnicity.  All these
Asian kids going around in there brand new Hondas and living at home with
mummy and daddy do not need affirmative action; they need a good kick up
the arse.  
And also, I hate this thing of if a proposition does not go your way you
block it in the courts so it never really comes into effect legally.  If a
proposition passes it should pass; and the courts and the legal system
should deal with it; changing other conflicting laws if needed.
Otherwise, what is the point of having elections on propositions in the
first place?  It's just another effort by the status quo to lull us into
the false sence of security that our voice really does count.  In short,
it's all bullshit.
And while I did vote no on prop 209 I do not agree with affirmative
action.  If it is supposed to help people from the ethnic minorities where
are all the programs for Jewish kids?  Answer there not their.  Why?
Because people think that all Jewish people are middle class and educated;
this is a lie.  When there are affirmative actions programs for Jewish
people I will then support affirmative action and not until.  We, as a
race, are descriminated from by all sides of the political spectrum and it
has got to stop.  In short, the people who are anti 209 are just as racist
as the people who support it.
We all live in the most amazing country in the world with the least
ammount of racism contained with in it.  Lets all stop feeling so sorry
for ourselves and be happy with what we've got.  Because at the end of the
day that is all anyone can hope for: to be treated the same as everybody
else.
Tristan.

I went to a public school in Baltimore.

My major point is that money is not the solution because money is not
the
problem.  Haven't you noticed that taxes keep going up but the things
the
government used to spend money on that benefitted all the citizens now
have to be funded by bond measures and "special" taxes that force the
money to be spent in a particular way?  All the tax money now goes to
special interest groups while things like libraries, roads, sewers, etc
are allowed to deteriorate?

If school spending in constant dollars has doubled in 30 years yet the
schools are crumbling and the children aren't being educated, then I
don't think more money will solve anything.  Washington DC spends
almost TEN THOUSAND dollars PER PUPIL PER YEAR on the
public schools (as much as expensive private schools charge) yet
the schools are a disgrace.....

What if you're not allowed to have a choice?  What if I don't like
Social
Security, or the Public Schools or Socialized Medicine?  I CAN'T
boycott the IRS or Social Security can I?  You may not like Shell but
what if the government owned the ONLY oil company you were allowed
to buy gas from?  This is the way it is in a lot of countries (and the

it's becoming here).......

Here's a table from the Statistical Abstract of the United States
showing
	how much various income groups pay in income taxes.  It's pretty
	eye opening!  The top 6.82% of income earners (those making
	over $75,000) pay OVER HALF of all income taxes!  You can
	see from the table that the bottom 60% of income earners who
	pay only 10% of the income tax have a veto-proof majority to
	elect those who will give them ever more benefits at the
	expense of the minority who pay the great majority of the
	taxes.  This is the engine that has been driving government
	expansion.

Table above is for '92 taxes and is taken from the latest
Statistical Abstract of the United States  (Table 534, page 346)

Column A:     income groups, in dollars
Column B:     number of returns filed, in thousands, by that income
group
Column C:     total adjusted gross income, in billions, for that income
group
Column D:     total taxes paid, in billions, by that income group
Column E:     percentage of total filers represented by that income
group
Column F:     cumulative percentage of filers for that income group and
above
Column G:     percentage of total income taxes paid by that income group
Column H:     cumulative percentage of income taxes paid by that income
group
			and above

For example, those making $50,000 - $75,000 represented 10.38% of all
those
	filing returns, and paid  18.6% of all income taxes paid

For example, those making 50K and above represented 17.2% of all filers,
but
	paid 69.7% of all income taxes paid

Do we have to start this again? I think we pretty much
covered this topic the last time it was raised on sfraves
two months ago, and I fail to see how it relates to the San
Francisco rave scene.

        Hello out there in rave land. I was just wondering how many of you
were going to this show?! It's going to be at the Warfield.

	I agree.  I'll shut up!  I just find it SO INFURIATING ;-)
	when people say things on this list that can be so
	easily checked for accuracy - if people would just
	make the effort.

	There seems to be a disturbing authoritarian attitude
	among many on this list.  I don't care if it's right or
	left wing authoritarianism - when it comes down to
	it on a personal level, it's someone trying to tell you
	what you can and can't do with your own life......

 Thanks!

 I'm glad you enjoyed Elevation so much! It's always good to hear.
Elevation is actually an event tat features all Socal-raves dj's, is
thrown by SCR peopl and resources are collected and donated from and
through SCR people. 

 What we did last August was a precursor for what we're doing Nov 16th.
I did see a few SFR laminates floating around that night, and hope to
see more in 9 days. It's outdoors once again, and at an incredible
location that is tent/camping friendly. We'll be serving free coffee all
night long, with a bread and fruit breakfast in the morning.

 I hope to see some of you SFRs there!

Hey people!

Audio Impact... I had an allright time, I guess - but it wasn't my night.
I should really listen to the voice of reason when it comes to weeknight
partying - DON'T DO IT!

I think the party itself was probably very good for those who were into
it, but I actually had a complaint that I want to discuss a bit.  Strobes.
The lighting consisted of pretty much just one big strobe light near the
back of the room, and it was driving me completely batty all night.  I
have always disliked them... but this was so relentless - seemed like it
was on non-stop, at the same pitch, all night long...

It really prevented me from having a good time, unfortunately.  Strobe
light aside, my only complaint was that near the end of the night the
sound quality deteriorated badly... mostly just too loud and too much
treble (for my sensitive ears?)

Oh well!  These things happen.  I don't mean to come across negatively, I
am actually really glad there's a jungle weekly in SF... I just can't deal
with the constant strobing.  Which is just as well, because I really
shouldn't be going out on weeknights anyway :>

Take care everyone!

 Yeah, I've got a few from Disco 2000 @ the Limelight that are pretty
aweful. Featuring punk rock kids sticking their tongues out at you, with
Clorox-like grfx. I guess it was ok at the time, since I did keep it.
But, there was also one for Limelight that was flat, and you could fold
it up into a lunchpail for all your raving goodies! ;?)

 *That's what I'd like to see more of; creativity in flyers.* 

 Not just the graphics, but the whole concept, like people used to do.
There is a book out called 'Tribes Scribes' which is a hard bound,
beautifully full-color printed book of rave flyers from around the
world. Focusing on LA, Milan, Tokyo, NYC, SF, Germany, England... you
know.. everywhere. But, Mostly in California to my surprise.

 The book was around $20, purchased this summer at B Dalton.

As someone that was in the Navy for 7 years and the position I was in and
things I've seen, the Navy, as well as the Military in general has to good
of radars, and equipment to have something like a missles hit a plane with
out doing it on purpose. They would have had to aim for it. Also I don't
think that ANYONE would launch a missle without checking the radar. The
radars I've seen are so good they can practically detect a fly that high in
the sky. Plus they have warnings that would have sounded if anything was
showing up on radar. So this, with my personal experience, is very hard to
believe.

With regard to the size and "coolness" of flyers, here's something to ponder:


        Promoters distribute flyers for the reason that they want people to
attend their party. Savvy promoters know that the most efficient and
friendly way to promote is actually through a mailing list/on the
phone/word of mouth. Not surprisingly, the parties promoted like that
usually turn out pretty good (in my experience, both to attend and play
at.)
        Promoters who use flyers as a method of promotion do so because
they want to attract more people to their event. Large flyers are not only
wasteful of resources (especially huge gatefold/full-colour ones) but
prompt the question, WHY?
        There is a level of one-upmanship amongst promoters (equalled only
by that of DJs!) which is demonstrated admirably by the flyer. A flyer
becomes the objectification of the party, available for all the world to
see. It don't matter if the party stinks, the DJs promised don't show, and
if "Peace, Love, Blah, Blah, Blah" statements are clearly not the
motivation for the party. The flyer is the "big dick" ethos of the
promoter. It's all about EGOTISM! This also explains the promoter who
advertises their local party in national magazines. The super-clubs in the
UK use their ads just the same way as banks or department stores: they
create an image, marketing THEMSELVES in the process. Now where did the
"real rave" go?
        I am very careful about MOTIVES. As a writer involved in the scene
I have to be (people are always accusing you of something...) In my
experience, not just in the scene but in general, someone who has something
to prove usually goes around making a big fuss about it...hence the
mega-flyer. Promoters who know wot's up don't need to. Think about it...
        So here we are, an "alternative" movement, yet once more falling
into the ways and failings of mainstream fucked-up society. What a shame.

Waxing lyrical 'bout 1971, the hangover of the '60s...

To some, flyers are keepsakes of times past. We can look beyond the
obvious fact that there real purpose is to attract, but there are some 
of the cooler underground ones with say a simple logo, black and white
xerox with a name and a ph#. These are more like invitations, and less
like advertisements.

 There is a big problem with flyers that turn into trash a few hits of E
later. A lot of people don't think twive about throwing their
collections of flyers on the ground, and then we all blame the promoters
who brought them for the trash problem. Owners of the locations get
pissed, and if it's out in the desert, it's far too obvious what group
is responsible... So where do they put the blame? Not on just the
responsible party, but the whole scene.

 So where do promoters draw the line with flyering a location? How do we
solve the problem of waste vs advertising? This is real tricky. We could
say "Well so and so is an as*hole promoter, so he shouldn't be able to
flyer" but that's not fair.

 Sorry, I have no conclusion... and besides, I'm SCR, why do I keep
posting up here? ;)

I heard this story a few weeks after the TWA bombing (early august '96)
while travelling through beeutiful Breaux Bridge Louisiana (dat's CAJUN
COUNTRY, Y'ALL). The person that told me (just one of those random
people you talk to when you're travelling) was the wife of a army
person, who said that this "friendly fire" knowledge was widespread
within the army's upper ranks. I told her that I had heard the exact
same story through the underground press. 

Of course, we don't know whether this is true, but given the multiple
eyewitness reports of a bright object arcing through the sky towards
the plane, then the sound of an explosion, it's not totally
inconceivable. That, and the total lack of conclusions, overall secrecy
they've operated under, and they've come up with no conclusions  after
multiple months of investigations by US Navy operatives!

Now, some 4 months later, talk that was widely known in the underground
press is finally making it to the mainstream media, and not through the
media's own volition (it used to be the media's role was to ferret out
stories like these, e.g. Watergate, the Chron's uncovering of staged
prisoner fights at Corcoran, etc..) -- this time it happened because
some old and well known reporter guy heard this story, saw the actual
military report of it, and notified his reportage connections...
Either that, or the knowledge of this was so widespread, that the 
media decided it was high time to jump on the bandwagon.

Likewise, i had first heard about the
Iran/Contra/Arms-for-hostages/CIA-cocaine dealing snafu in the
underground press, and approximately 10-12 years later, they're taking
the story seriously, e.g. Maxine Waters, reopened congressional
hearings, and the San Jose Mercury story... but for a good 10 years,
anybody mentioning this was laughed off the air as a "conspiracy
theorist nut." (And let's not forget good ol' Bob Dole's central role
in advocating the pardon and easy treatment of all the chief
Iran/Contra operatives!)

Yep, love our democracy, love our free press, love the way the
right-wing CIA/military/shadow government covers up it's own criminals
so effectively while we run around spouting crap about "democracy" and
"being the freest nation in the world"... We used to complain about
this kind of doublespeak and government censored press back when the
USSR did it, but when it happens in our own back yard, it goes against
our apple pie and yellow-ribbon sensibilities. Time for a change!

PS: Ralph Nader for president in 2000!

   I've been following all the posts about the recent election with great 
interest, and I thought I'd give some of my thoughts back as well.  Please
forgive me if I start sounding preachy (I have a tendency to do that when
I talk about politics, which I feel pretty passionate about.)  

I've noticed that people tend to take a pretty negative view towards 
politics in general.  They say things like "Our leaders are out-of-touch,
bureaucracy's stupid, our tax dollars are being wasted, elections and 
candidates are bought and sold by greedy corporations" etc.  And most
if not all of these comments, taken individually, are true.  Yes, a
lot of things about our government can be fixed.  Many politicians are
selfish.  And there are a lot of disturbing  and depressing statistics 
out there.

But, even in the midst of the glossy TV advertisements and ten-second
soundbytes, every now and the, amazing things can happen in a democracy.
Does anyone really think that the politicians  aren't *trying* to make
things better?  Is 1996 a worse time than 1956?  or 1906?  I think that
 whenever examining or talking about politics, it makes more sense to look
at big trends, and not get caught up in the hundreds of little statistics 
which dominate today's airwaves. Environmental protection has increased 
during our lifetimes.  Human rights have expanded during our lifetimes.
Trade has increased during our lifetimes.    Standard of living and life
expectancy have increased.  Literacy rates are climbing.  Wars occur
less frequently than they once did.  
I don't mean to be naive, and I'm not trying to smooth over the real and 
horrible problems which still do exist.  I just think that the bigger
picture, the longer timeline, is more important

Look at prop 215--it passed!  Isn't that wonderful?!  And while I 
adamantly voted no on 209, I don't think that everyone who voted yes 
is evil or "doesn't get it."   Did a lot of people vote yes on 209 
because they are lashing out unreasonably against groups which
have historically been oppressed?  I'm sure a lot did.  Did everyone?
I don't know.  I look at it this way: prop 209, in and of itself,
was not wrong.; it was just out of its time.  One day, I hope
everyone thinks,  our society will be mature enough to treat everyone
equally, and there won't be a need for  affirmative action laws
 to tell us that discrimination is idiotic.  So, perhaps those who
voted in favor of 209 were simply being prematurely idealistic, and
not discriminatory.  My point is that all sections of the political
spectrum can offer something useful--even though I am a am a Democrat, for
example, I don't believe Republicans don't have things to say which should
be considered.

Personally, I think we're really, really lucky to have Clinton as 
president.  He's a centrist, and has said that he believes that "the truth 
lies in the middle." He's very much into the ideas of inclusion,
education, and global connectedness.   And I think that his philosophy has
a tremendous amount in common with rave culture/PLUR!  So I guess it irks
me a little bit when I hear all the negativity towards politics--if the
only feedback politicians get is "you're doing a bad job", the more 
hesitant they become, and the more they will try to appeal to the 
lowest common denominator, instead of governing creatively.

Anyways, just had to get that off my chest! :)  It just seems to me like
the country is finally, actually starting to have a more thoughtful
government, and no one seems to care or even notice the gradual change.

best,
Timothy

I've compiled the first edition of the Berkeley Ravers Carpool list, and 
there are 12 of us on it!!

If you live in the immediate Berkeley vicinity, drop me a note to be 
included on the list.  Or, you might want to start a carpool collective 
in your area!

Yea, carpooling... ravers getting to all the parties they want, new 
friendships made, and helping out the environment along the way.  :) :)

Hi!

I'm currently looking for a roommate to share a 3 bedroom, 2 bath
condo in the city...here's some of the highlights:

Central location near Geary / Laguna.

Easy on off freeways via Gough / Franklin.

All electric kitchen, dishwasher, garbage disposal, washer/dryer in
unit.

7th story views in all rooms, living room has patio, the 3 bedrooms have
sliding glass door that opens out to small walk out balcony.

Walk to restaurants (Japan Town), grocery (Bell Market, Whole Foods), 
movies (Kabuki, theatres on Van Ness), health club (24hr Nautilus),
just about anywhere in SF.

24hr doorman. Very secure building.

Easy street parking. NEVER have problems finding street parking.

Prefer non-cigarette smoking, raver friendly roommate. I'm hardly
ever home during the week and only go back up to SF for the week-
end...I work in Mt. View.

Solid thick cement walls/floor so each room has pretty good sound 
insulation!

Rent $1895 / 3 or 4 depending if 2 people were to share the master
bedroom with it's own bathroom. Short term lease still being negotiated.

Please email me privately if you're interested or call me at (415)
921-7045 home or (415) 237-0122 work. If I'm not at home please
try to leave a message on my work voicemail too since I'm using it
as my own personal answering machine.

Peace!
John

Sorry for the garbled messages.  I am going to stop posting (I hear the
roars of happiness!  Stop that!) until I figure it out.

Until then...to all the warrirors on both sides:
I'm glad we took the time to talk about the issues.  I persoanlly think
this is the step we should've taken a long time ago to address our racial
concerns.  But I'm glad we took time out of partying and talking about
partying to talk about something that affects everyone in this scene, this
state and this country.

Peace out,
John


Now to figure out what is fucking up my posts....damn!

Audi.

Hello,

Yes, I'm harping on this same issue.  Tristan says at HER college there
more people of color than at all British colleges combined.  However,
that is HER college and most other places are unlike the SF Bay Area. 
What is everybody complaining about?  That it might no longer be like
that and things will REGRESS instead of PROGRESS.   Why assume that
people have it so good?  Since when?  DO people REALLY have it so good
or else why does racism and inequality still exist (INCLUDING WOMEN). 
There is a reason why Asians are excluded from affirmative action (and
this isn't my opinion, it's factual) and that is because they, along
with Jewish people, have achieved what's called "Model Minority" status,
meaning that they are not regarded as academically inferior and have
high visibility in academia.  A LOT has to do with social attitudes
towards minorities.  Social attitudes towards Asians and Jews in regards
to education are not the same as with other minorities.  Society
already  EXPRECTS these people to excel, while, say Latinos and Blacks
are not. If they were, then we wouldn't need the programs that 209
abolishes to ENCOURAGE and ENSURE that these people (including women)
get their foot in the door.  That is why Latinos have the HIGHEST drop
out rate in the country (more than any other minority) because social
expectations of them.  At my high school (which was 90% Latino), the
only students who got extra attention from teachers about college were
the ones in honors classes.  The rest got pretty much ignored or
influenced to just settle on (at most) junior college.  They were just
as capable of entering universities had they been pushed but that was
not expected of them.  Do you see what I mean?
Why are we complaining?  Because there is NOT ENOUGH VISIBILITY in
society!  Do women currently hold as many positions of power as men do? 
I don't think so.  Do we see fair representation of people of color in
almost any other sphere (especially academia and careers)? No.  There is
still a dominance by non-ethnic (for lack of better word), straight
males and that inspires a hopelessnes in those who should be striving to
move upwards in society.  It's telling people that they CAN'T and that
any efforts are futile.  They feel locked out while they SHOULD strive
for something better.
I know not ALL Jewish people and Asian people are educated or
middle-class but at least society doesn't consider them inferior or
incompetent.  But the numbers prove they far exceed other minorities.
Why do you think people acknowledge that, say, "Hollywood is run by
Jews"?  Because they have RISEN (hence, the term "model minority"). And
that's great.  Jewish people and Asians should be proud to have achieved
that status.  
 Discrimination IS NOT THE SAME FOR EVERYBODY ON EVERY LEVEL.  Sure,
Asians and Jews get discriminated against and face racism, etc. But next
time, count the number of them at school and see if it outweighs the
number of black and latinos.
The way society looks at people will reflect on their achievements.  And
our social outlook is heavily influenced by those in power (straight,
white, upper-middle class) It is really sad that we have such a huge
Latino population in this nation but very little visiblity.  I'm not
complaining like a "spoilt child" as Tristan says.  I have been there
and I am RISING and I want to ensure that others do as well.

Peace.

                    Federal agencies deny TWA Flight 800 shot down by
                    missile

                    They reconfirm that Internet        [TWA graphic]
                    report false

                    November 8, 1996
                    Web posted at: 1:00 p.m. EST

                    WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Federal investigators, the
                    White House and U.S. Navy strongly denied Friday
                    there was any reason to believe TWA Flight 800 was
                    accidentally shot down by a missile fired from a
                    Navy ship.

                    The agencies planned to hold a news conference at
                    2 p.m. EST Friday afternoon. The July 17 crash
                    killed 230 people.

                     [Salinger] The denial followed remarks Thursday
                                in Cannes, France, by Pierre
                    Salinger, a former White House press secretary and
                    ABC Television correspondent, that he had evidence
                    the jetliner was brought down by "friendly fire"
                    and the incident was being covered up by the
                    government.

                    Federal officials denied Salinger's report.

                    "There's no indication that there's any
                    credibility to the report," Deputy White House
                    Press Secretary Mary Ellen Glynn said Friday
                    morning.

                    Earlier, a Navy spokesman told CNN: "It's not
                    possible that a missile was fired at the plane and
                    we've covered it up." And, an NTSB investigator
                    said: "There is no evidence of any missile fire
                    bringing down that plane -- unequivocally."

                    Investigators on the case have been frustrated
                    over their inability to determine whether a bomb,
                    missile or mechanical malfunction caused the
                    explosion off New York's Long Island.

                    Salinger was press spokesman for President John F.
                    Kennedy before becoming Paris Bureau Chief for
                    ABC.

                    Document on Internet

                    Salinger said he was basing the claims on
                    information he saw in a document given to him six
                    weeks ago by someone in French Intelligence with
                    close contacts to U.S. officials. He refused to
                    identify the source.

                    Later, however, he learned from CNN that the
                    document actually was a widely accessible e-mail
                    letter that has been circulating for at least six
                    weeks on the Internet's World Wide Web. Salinger
                    expressed surprise and verified that his document
                    matched those CNN showed him.

                    "Yes. That's it. That's the document," Salinger
                    said. "Where did you get it?"

                    The document has been widely distributed over the
                    Internet through e-mails and other outlets.

                    It claims the Paris-bound Boeing 747 was struck by
                    a Navy Aegis missile shortly after takeoff from
                    New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport.
                    The jumbo jet crashed in the Atlantic Ocean off
                    the coast of Long Island, killing everyone aboard.

                    The National Transportation Safety Board, FBI and
                    Navy have repeatedly denied the report. The Navy
                    said it could not have shot down the plane because
                    it had no weapons in the area to do so, and
                    pointed out that federal investigators had already
                    found that possibility "without merit."

                    "We've tracked any Navy assets in the area and
                    there's nothing different. There was nothing in
                    the area that could have done that. There's
                    nothing more to add," Lt. Cmdr. Susan Haeg, a Navy
                    spokeswoman, said.

                    Another Navy official scorned Salinger's earlier
                    claim.

                    "I would find that unbelievable," the official
                    said, asking to remain anonymous. The official
                    said the Navy keeps logs to account for the
                    positions of its ships and any firings of its
                    weapons systems.

                    A streak of light

                    The missile theory has stayed alive because of the
                    number of reports from other pilots in the area
                    and witnesses on shore who claim to have seen
                    streaks of light or something similar around the
                    time of the crash.

                    A New York Air National Guard unit put out a press
                    release Friday as the latest rumors were
                    circulating reiterating that two of its helicopter
                    pilots "witnessed a streak of light" around the
                    time of the explosion.

                    A statement faxed to news organizations, including
                    CNN, by the 106th Rescue Wing based at Gabfbreski
                    Air National Guard Station at Westhampton, New
                    York, said:

                    "The two helicopter pilots that saw TWA (flight)
                    800 explode on the night of July 17 have not
                    changed their statements, according to a base
                    spokesman.

                    "Major Frederick Meyer, the pilot, and Captain
                    Cristian Baur, the co-pilot, both saw a streak of
                    light, moving from east to west prior to the
                    initial explosion. Both pilots, who have made
                    statements to the FBI, do not know what caused the
                    streak of light."

                    The flight report the pilots filed the night of
                    the crash with the Federal Aviation Administration
                    reflects what they now say they believe they saw.
                    The FBI has acknowledged that some pilots in the
                    area that night saw streaks of light but has not
                    publicly identified those pilots.

 That's OK - I started overloading about 48 hours ago and started to
delete any post with "209" or "215" or "reverse" or "quota" or
"larryc" (woops!) in the subject line - unread. If any of the involved 
parties are offended by that, just EMAIL me about it, please don't post
to the list too!

 At least one good thing to come out of this Prop. 209 thing for sure.

The one thing that makes the navy missile theory completely implausble for
me is:

Why the hell would the Navy be conducting ANY millitary excersises
(especially those involving live ammunition) ANWYHERE near a major
metropolitan area such as off the coast of Long Island, NY? You do that
kind of stuff way far out - where there's nothing to hit - not near the
biggest city in the US with 3 major metropolitan airports...

geee....i really wanted to stay out of all this conversations about race 
and what not. but now...someone just cant figure out why parties are 
doing this....well DUH!!!

can we say "MULTICULTURALISM!??!" anyone????

"CELEBRATE DIVERSITY"

yeah...these are the reasons why you have people sticking to their own 
races. when you tell people to stay with their own culture, what do you 
think is going to happen? do you really think people are going to all get 
along like its some fluffy commune?? hell no. you (democrates, liberals, 
etc..) are telling people not to become americans. but to become hyphen 
americans. yeah. thats the ticket..isnt it? not. go to CSUH and take a 
look in the student union...you'll see all the asians in one group, all 
the blacks in another,  all the hispanics in yet another, and the whites 
in one more. no one talks to eachother. why?? because of your completely 
idiotic statements such as "Multiculturalism," and "diverse" and whatnot.

no one will talk to eachother when you guys set the ground rules such as 
that.

yeah.
thanks for your fuck-ups in the '60s

Following is a letter from the Provost of Academic Affairs to all the UC 
Chancellors, on immediate implementation of 209.

The instantaneous effects on thousands of young people are obvious.

Friends, I haven't had the luxury of following the debate here, though I 
wish I had because political/social discussion is so very important.  If 
I repeat things others have said, apologies.

My 2c (there's at least 98c more, but I'll spare you!)
Consider this: most experts agree the elimination of affirmative 
action means less representation of women and minorities in higher ed, 
higher-paying jobs, and gov't contracts.  If we really do have a level 
playing field, then the only possible explanation for white male 
ascendancy is that they are actually more qualified than others. 

Well, this notion of "genetic superiority" has been totally discarded by 
science, about a century ago.

So, the alternate explanation remains: barriers, especially historical 
discrimination and lowered social status of women and minorities, still 
exist that limit these peoples' life opportunities.

Affirmative action sought to address these barriers.  Now it is gone 
without any other sort of remedy in its place.

UCB forecasts a drop of 60-70% in minority enrollment.  Women still only 
comprise 2% of top executives, and make up the vast majority of those 
impoverished, so I'm not sure what a "decline" would look like from there! 

Affirmative action was a tool to help address inequities - a hope that it 
could change things.  30 years and we still have unbelievable social 
problems, but prospects for women and minorities have greatly improved.  
We have a LONG way to go.  All of my professors were men.  Out in the 
workworld, I have found that the executives and the decision-makers are 
men, and the secretaries and the assistants are women.  Examples of 
the stratified social structure are endless, because an unequal society 
is what we have.  Do you all really believe this is based solely on merit?? 
Look at the earnings of white men compared to other groups, their educational attainment, their 
standard of living and their status in society.  There is no question 
that, as a group, white men have the most power and privilege in our 
society.  The real question, to me, is WHY?

How do we address the real, underlying issues?  Socioeconomic differences 
that act as "tracks" - the middle class off to college, the impoverished 
to crime, welfare or the legions of "working poor" (who outnumber welfare 
recipients, by the way!!)  Gender notions that inform attitudes towards 
people (do you really believe women are more 
respected as students/thinkers/businesspeople than men?)  Historical legacy of 
racism.  Social networks.  And on and on.  Our entire social/economic 
system is implicated in the origin of the extreme inequality we face. 

People,
Affirmative action was just a bandaid 
- it was an EASY OUT to allow some measure of possibility for women and 
minorities in a system set up on economic inequality and white and male 
dominance.  Instead of questioning our society, it 
fundamentally accepts the system and merely trys to rectify the total 
exclusion of women and minorities by opening a few doors, if you can do 
the work to get there and go beyond.  It is a CONSERVATIVE RESPONSE to 
systemic inequality.  It takes the place of revolution.

Affirmative action is not about rewarding the "unqualified".  I absolutely 
work my hardest - but the glass ceiling is damn hard to break no matter 
how hard you slam up against it.  Affirmative action was just the sugar to 
help all of us swallow racism and sexism, some crumbs to combat the 
massive barriers of our race or sex.  Now, those small 
crumbs of affirmative action have been taken away and we're left with the 
same problems.     

So now that the number of women and minorities will decline at our best 
universities and in better-paying jobs, and white men will grasp all of the 
fruits from the tree, we can sit back and smile and say, "what a lovely, 
nondiscriminatory society we have!"  


PS The term "white men" clumps all people who demographically fit into 
this category.  Any categorizing is unfair.  I totally understand the 
anger of well-meaning men for being so vilified.  I use the term in a 
sociological sense.  It is important to realize that as a group, this 
"group" has enjoyed immense privilege.  When women and minorities fight 
for inclusion, it is because we feel that our degraded economic and 
social status compared to the most powerful group is 
unfair and without basis.  Who started this?  Who is responsible?  Who 
cares?? I hope we can recognize that 
"white men" are in a higher position without it meaning that particular men are 
evil or that it is a grand conspiracy or whatever.

Peace to all.  Affirmative action was about rectifying the inequality 
between all people. It is in that spirit that I defend it. 

Read on for the future of
higher education:

>Dear Colleagues:
>
>In light of yesterday's passage of Proposition 209, and the fact that it
becomes law today, I am writing to provide you with specific guidance about
how to implement the Proposition.  I wish to reiterate that the University
of California strongly is committed to the goal of a diverse faculty, staff
and student body and will do all it can, under the law and within Regental
policy, to achieve that goal.
>
>The following specific steps that should be taken are based primarily on
General Counsel Holst's October 4, 1996 letter regarding the potential
impact on the University of Proposition 209.  As pointed out in that letter,
it is possible that there could be a court order prohibiting immediate
implementation of Proposition 209; however, absent such an order, we should
proceed with the steps indicated below:
>
>1.  Hiring and contracting programs:
>
>Since Regents' resolution SP-2 went into effect on January 1, 1996, and
contains the same prohibitions regarding preferences as does Proposition
209,  there is no need to take any further action in these areas at this time.
>
>2.  Admissions programs:
>
>Admissions decisions made after the date of this letter should not include
consideration of race, sex, color, ethnicity or natural origin.
>
>a.   Graduate and Professional school admissions:
>
>Regents' resolution SP-1 is in effect for graduate and professional
students currently applying to the University, for admission to the Fall
1997 class.  Under SP-1 race, sex, color, ethnicity and national origin are
eliminated as selection criteria and, therefore, no further action need be
taken.
>
>b.  Undergraduate admissions:
>
>Implementation of SP-1 for undergraduate admissions was to take effect for
students applying for enrollment for Spring 1998.  However, in light of the
passage of Proposition 209, effective immediately, campuses may no longer
use race, ethnicity, sex or national origin as one of the supplemental
criteria used to select admitted students from the pool of eligible
students.  Students are applying this month to enroll in Fall 1997.  These
applicants were notified of the possibility of such a change (see page 5 of
the Application for Undergraduate Admission and Scholarship, 1997-98).
>
>3.  Financial aid:
>
>The General Counsel has recommended the suspension of all future financial
aid awards under which any recipient is advantaged or disadvantaged because
of race, ethnicity, gender or national origin.  Financial aid commitments to
individual students made prior to the passage of the Proposition should
continue to be honored.     Students receiving financial aid awards under
Federal financial programs in which race, ethnicity or gender is a condition
of the aid, or must be a factor in distributing the aid, may continue to
receive these awards.  Under Proposition 209, the University can continue to
accept and administer such Federal funds.
>
>For  financial aid programs funded through University or State funds,  the
University no longer may utilize race, ethnicity, national origin or gender
as factors taken into account to select recipients for disbursement of these
funds.  Campuses may continue administering University financial support
recruitment programs (i.e.,  the graduate level Academic Career Development
Program, and various campus recruitment programs such as the Chancellor's
Scholarships) as long as race, ethnicity and gender no longer are used as
criteria for selecting aid recipients.
>
>The University has received numerous gifts and endowment funds that contain
specific requirements for distribution by race, ethnicity, gender or
national origin.  Policies and procedures for distribution of these funds
are being reviewed by General Counsel and my office with regard to how to
make appropriate uses of these funds.
>
>4.  Outreach programs:
>
>The University has made commitments for the 1996-97 academic year to
schools, students, counselors and employees affected by a variety of
existing outreach programs.  These programs are expected to continue and
remain open to all students regardless of race, ethnicity and gender.
Proposition 209 may ultimately be interpreted to require further action, but
any action should be deferred pending review of the Outreach Task Force
recommendations.
>
>5.  Other UC race, ethnic, or gender attentive programs:
>
>There may be campus-based programs that utilize race, ethnicity, or gender
as factors in determining eligibility to participate, even though such
programs are not exclusionary.  No immediate action should be required if
membership for such programs for this year already has been determined.  The
Chancellors should assure that race, ethnicity, gender, national origin, or
religion, are not considered in future eligibility determinations.  My
office, along with the General Counsel's office, will be available to work
with the campuses in order to identify such programs and to develop
appropriate changes that need to occur.

Sounds like you'll be pleased to learn John, that nowadays, banks often
*turn down* loans to borrowers because they *don't* live in those same
districts.  Entire loan program structures are set up specifically for
people who live in those districts, or who make less money, where if you
*dont* live in a specific neighborhood, or you *do* make too much money, you
don't qualify for the loan.  "I'm sorry Thomas, you make too much money/you
don't live in East Palo Alto/wherever, we had to decline your loan"  How's
that for restitution?  And you should see how our bank offices (and a lot of
others I'm sure) bend over backwards to keep from firing minority/female
employees that really should not keep their jobs for fear of being sued into
the ground with some huge lawsuit where the employee accuses the bank of
racism/prejudice/whatever, cuz so many people wave the racism stick around.
White men certainly don't get that from what I've seen.

>Or one could say more plainly: "Two wrongs make a right." 


Exactly the thought I had the other day.  As far as why AA has failed, I
find it to be similar to a lot of other concepts humanity has come up with
that, in theory, are actually very good ideas, I believe.  I think in
theory, AA can be a very good idea.  But I've discovered that humanity has
one fuck of a time applying good theories to real life, something gets lost
in the "translation" so to speak.  The end result seems quite different than
what was originally intended when the plan was thought out.  The idea of
allowing minorities & women equal access to jobs/education/etc is of course
a grand idea.  At my office (BofA), white males are quite a minority
actually, and all the ethnic people & women are quite qualified to do my
job.  To me, my office is very representative of how I think things should
be; there's a damned even mix of *everybody* working at my office, and we're
all qualified to do the jobs we were hired for.  For a while, all the
higher-up managers were women, there were no men.  We even had one person
working there who had aids.  Our office is simply run and operated by
people.  If we have AA to thank for that, then that's just fine by me.  To
me, that end result is what I find positive about AA.  However, I hear too
much about being told to not bother applying for ABC College or whatever if
you're white, cuz they have too many white people and you'd never get in, or
about having to fill the "quota", even at the expense of not hiring
qualified workers at ABC Bank.  I'd hate to not get a job because I was
white, or to get a job because I was a woman.  I never want to be hired
based on *anything* but my qualifications to do that job.  And I also have a
problem with the idea of "owing something" to minorities for wrongs in the
past.  I don't feel like I owe anybody anything for things done to anybody
in the past, as I did not do them myself. As a woman, I don't feel that
anybody owes me anything for any wrongs committed to women in the past.  All
I will ask for, and all I will give, is equal treatment from and to people
now; I will not make up for wrongs I myself did not commit any more than I
will ask you to.  Yes, white people have majorly fucked over a *lot* of
people in the past, I'm stunned by what I've learned at times, but a) I
myself did not do any of that, and b) no matter how justified your anger
against that is, it will not actually, imo, assist towards any furthering of
true equality amongst people now.  Two wrongs do *not* make a right (altho
three lefts do), only attempting to do the right thing now will.

Things were the way they were, & they shouldn't have been.  Things are the
way they are, and they shouldn't be. I really believe the only way to true
equality is that everybody pretty much has to give up on everything, forget
wrongs in the past as much as it hurts to do so, stop committing them in the
present even if you feel justified because of the past wrongs, and simply
live life as though we were all purple and asexual! :)  Before being white,
before being female, I am first and foremost a human being, and wish to be
treated so, end of story.  These other things should have no bearing on
anything no matter what, they are irrelevant.  This goes for everybody.  End
of story.

interesting thing is that i heard about the friendly fire rumour *WAY*
before it was sent around on the internet. once, on some "conspiracy
theory" radio show, and shortly after that, verbally from the very
talkative wife of an army officer when i was playing tourist in 
cajun-country parts of Lousiana (i jest luv 'dem swamps n' gaters, 
file gumbo, and people speaking french with a weird accent); naturally,
i found it very strange when the "friendly fire" SPAM started making
it's way around the internet, and even stranger when the official
denials started flowing... i've seen this kind of spin control
before...

Remember a few years ago when veterans returning from the gulf war
started complaining about "gulf war sickness"; the military *STRONGLY*
denied that desert storm veterans were exposed to any germ warfare or
chemical weapons while on duty; despite this, many thousands became ill
with a wide variety of inexplicable symptoms -- in response to this,
the government further denigrated it's victims (both on TV and in the
press) telling them to quit acting like sissies, and calling them
"fakers" that wanted to cash in on lawsuits, etc.

then, last year, scientists came forward saying that gulf war syndrome
might be caused by the "cocktail" of immunizations and chemical weapons
antidotes given to soldiers before they were shipped off to the front
lines; and just recently, the pentagon has fully admitted that up to
10000 soldiers may have been exposed to sarin gas when some bunkers
were blown up, and that they were attempting to track down these
veterans... now we're finding evidence that the army knew damn well
about what happened, and some believe that the large number of friendly
fire deaths reported were actually horrible deaths from exposure to
chemical weapons at a bunker blown up by the US army. (the soldiers
were told they needn't wear their chemical weapons masks -- the survivors
just happened to be disobeying ordfers and wearing their chem-suits anyways).

so no, i really don't tend to believe the armed forces when they rush
to deny such allegations so quickly. fact is we don't know exactly what
happened yet. however, if a terrorist group was involved, they're
usually quite happy to let you know they did it. in this case, no such
acknowledgement has taken place. airlines usually don't just blow-up in
mid-air; jet-fuel is specifically less volatile than gasoline  to
prevent exposions.

please consider the sources when such public denials happen by the
armed forces. these are the same armed forces media mavens that
underreported the civilian casualties of the panama invasion by a
factor of 100, blasted international reports that over 500,000 Iraqi's
were killed during desert storm, and blatantly lied about "gulf war
sickness" while insulting the dignity of the soldiers that were
needlessly injured while serving our country.

  Thanks for the info about the origin and development of house. A further
question:
  A couple of folks I was talking to in F8 yesterday said that the
house-and-techno scene is "losing life" here in San Francisco, but it
surging ahead in Europe, and in particular in Germany. Anyone here agree
with/disagree with/want to qualify that observation?

[ to sfraves ]
Awhile ago, I asked folks here on SFRaves as to what they mean by describing 
someone as a "gangsta" :

> So.. as a 41 year old guy who doesn't quite have a handle on the young
> folks terminology, I thought I'd ask this - what are folks meaning when
> they describe "gangstas" at a party?

I made some guesses of my own :
> 1. Guys who actually are in a violence-prone gang.
> 2. Guys who want to look as if they belong in a gang.
> 3. Guys who copy what rap artists are wearing.

>  Also, "gangstas" vs. "gangsta wanna-be's" ?

 Thanks to all the folks who replied!  Here's a condensed and edited 
summary of what people told me -
======================================================================
 When I talk about "gangstas" on SFR, I'm not talking about people who hang
on the street in gangs, it's a whole different thing, it's more of a style.

 To me, a "gangsta" is an attitude and a style.

 Gangstas come to parties in groups ...., often with friends they've known 
for years.

Gangstas like to project a tough attitude,they stand aside and watch the
crowd with that attitude... I think it's because they come from an
environment where that attitude is a daily survival necessity.

They usually wear sportswear (Adidas, etc.), and often a hat down low that
adds to the feeling of attitude, and they often dress similarly within
their group.

They often cruise girls, which is why some raver girls don't like them.
But there are gangsta girls who are as cool as the boys, and they're
usually accepted totally by the boys.

Gangstas usually dance like the shit, and they dance for each other, hence
the oft-criticized "circles" which I happen to like if there's room, cuz
that's how people get to show off their moves.

(< I happen > to think that gangsta boys are way cute)

-----------------------
it mostly has to do with the rave uniform mentality....... I am therefor I
look like etc....

mostly harmless, although I do see scary looking groups (otherwize known 
as gangs) of boys who just as soon you gave em shit so they are justified 
to kick your ass.........

nothing but punk kids with no motivation but to look like , be like , and
act like your contemporary gang looking  kids..... (rap wannan be's and
circle dancers......)
----------------------
The "gansta" wannabes I've seen at raves are young guys so insecure with
themselves that they need to put up a front all the time, and so look
like they belong to a gang and copy what rap artists are wearing.  If it
were real, I'd dig it, but it seems so shallow!

BTW, it has nothing to do with skin color, and everything to do with
attitude.
----------------------
> 1. Guys who actually are in a violence-prone gang.
yes, but not really in context with the ones at raves

> 2. Guys who want to look as if they belong in a gang.
oh, mais oui! add in sky high ego and giant attitude and you've got it.

> 3. Guys who copy what rap artists are wearing.
well, sorta. rap artists clothing tends to follow the street, so they are
the same as the gangasta wannabes.
----------------------
You pegged it.  Rap-star/gang clothing, mean faces, tough-guy/tough-chick
strut and attitude.  That's about it for me.
----------------------
 I guess my def of gangstas would be

        ganstas, ie: gangsters, gang members, ganster look alikes:

                Would be a male or female, generally there to either create
trouble, get fucked up, or get some chick. Usually looks like a gangster in
the way they dress, and can be seen standing against a wall dogging the
real ravers. Gangsters generally look like the gangsters on tv (the new
ones), wearing baggy clothes, big ugly puffy jackets, beanies, lowrider
shirts, or any other gangster clothes.
---------------------
when i say gangsta, i mean a person who is ready and willing to use
violence to resolve conflicts.  appearance and clothing are a barometer,
but a lot of the same clothes appear on people i'd describe instead as
club kids, street kids, or just plain kids...
....more than anything else, the gansta "litmus test" is that subjective
reaction you get from their body language and speech that says to you,
look out!  if you give this guy attitude, he'll beat the shit out
of you.  without the street threads, that's a hooligan or a psycho or a
head case or a mean off-duty cop or whatever - with the street clothes,
it's a gansta.

>  Also, "gangstas" vs. "gangsta wanna-be's" ?

there are also people who are dressed like ganstas, try to put out that
tough and violent body language, but you are deeply convinced that if they
met a REAL gangsta, they wouldn't say a damn thing while he stole their
shoes, jacket, and girlie.  they prey only on those they perceive as too
weak to put up a fight - those are wanna-be gangstas to me.
====================================================================

 Hi, Larry here - I don't think the above definitions need any kind of 
clarification by me. I do want to point out that it seems that what I 
suspected is true for my respondents - that folks were not using it in a 
"code word for minorities", but were keying on a combination of dress,
body language, and "attitude".

 Again, thanks for the replies!   Larry Ching/larryc@netcom.com

At last, at last!  This is just what I need. ;)   I shall be at 2o12 
tonight in my blue Moraccan gandora. I also did henna crop circles on my 
hands, and they turned out really good.  I guess I'm trying to capture 
ancient cultures (egyptian & moroccan) with that of the future (UFOlogy) 
and the setting (rave) itsself seems to capture the past and the future.

ritual of the 21st century.'"  Oh yeah. :)  ....the chai will be

Hi everybody,

Im supposed to be getting ready for a three week trip out of town
today but I just found out the Dave Matthews band is going to be at
the Cow Palace tonight. Is anybody else from the list going to the show?
Id be interested to hook up for dinner or something before the show (or
after the show) and then some raving after that.

Peace,

Rudi

     Picked up a flyer last night for this party. Gotta say it looks kinda 
     tasty : J saul kane (depth charge), Freaky Chakra vs. Single cell 
     orchestra, A Guy called Gerald, Consciousness Lab (saw them last 
     weekend at Samhain)
     Something for folks who like ambient and jungle.
     
     Also has Peter Lazonby (uk) who is meant to play some great Techno.
     
     Anyone else going ?

They usually wear sportswear (Adidas, etc.), and often a hat down low that 
adds to the feeling of attitude, and they often dress similarly within 
their group.

well, I kinda agree, but I also look at flyers from an artistic
perspective. I can't deal with flyers like "fantasy island" or "megga buzz
one" which have no artistic side, just a promotional side.

However, there's alot of designs out there which are simply "beautiful."
They show that the artist cares about his/her designs, and that the
promoter cares enought to hire someone who can do a good job, not just an
"egoist" hack job. I fully understand that *ideal* way to promote parties
is through word of mouth, but for a lot of up-and-coming promoters that's
just not feasible yet... They have to rely on flyers.

So why blast all flyers out there?? In the past few weeks alot of really
incedibly flyers have hit the streets.. justa few that blow my mind are
soundlab's "recombinant" design, the back of chew-z's "be here now" flyer,
all those "eden saturdays" designs, the front of the "get down get down get
down" flyer, and a bunch that my man terry sent me from LA. I appreciate
the fact that there's a chance for young designers to show off their
talents like that.

Of course, you must understand I'm totally biased on this subject because
I'm trying to get into the flyer bizness meself. =))

take care,
-m.

PS: andrew your set at karma last week was great!!! I just love hearing
someone rip shit up like that in my own fucking kitchen! =)

I fully disagree... the techno scene is SO ALIVE here; I feel it every
weekend... in regards to europe; it's so played out in germany. I mean, in
germany they have live mixing shows on MTV, they play trance and gabber
videos, and *everyone's* a raver. which I suppose is cool and all, but
where will it end?

The scene over there is huge, which just isn't my taste. I don't want SF's
vibrant scene to degenerate into some kind of lollapalooza nightmare liek
it has in europe.

Come on...Sure, techno is huge in Germany, but I know at least 2 germans who aren't ravers:)
Besides, no matter where you go in europe, there is STILL an underground, even in the biggest 
"party" cities in europe.

Like i said... the scale of commercial parties is no greater than the commercial end of the 
scene here and I went to a couple quality undergrounds in London last summer. Sure they have 
aweful MTV crap but they also have wicked pirate radio stations as well. It all balances out. 
Don't worry, I don't see any signs of lollapaloolization any time soon...(besides the porno 
for pyros shindig...HA!)

     Does anyone out there have a copy of this BBC "rave" drama on video 
     that I can borrow. It stars that guy who played John Lennon in 
     backbeat, Ian something or other....
     Also...while I'm at it do any of you tape Flux tv on sat nights. I 
     just got cable again after 6 months and remember it was the only show 
     that had good non-mainstream dance videos.
     
     On another note : where can I rent an lcd projector to hook up to a 
     laptop, and how much for same ?

Like i said... the scale of commercial parties is no greater than the commercial
end of the 
scene here and I went to a couple quality undergrounds in London last summer. 
Sure they have 
aweful MTV crap but they also have wicked pirate radio stations as well. 

        I'm in full agreement on this one, the pirate stations in Europe are 
excellent. I think I posed this question before, but  does anyone out there know
the legalities of broadcasting. Is it a feasible propisition to set a 
transmitter up somewhere ? All I've heard of so far is Radio Free Berkeley. 

Peace,

Ciaran O'

I think free radio berkeley is in the business of selling small FM
transmitters so everyone can have pirate stations.

can anyone second this rumour?

hi all--

i'm going to 2o12 tonight (as i've said before...) 
 
i'm coming straight from work, so i pretty much know what i'm wearing: 

blue jeans and a genesis t-shirt. pretty damned normal, i know, but i felt
like being comfy today. 

i'll probably be dancing more than usual tonight (those of you who know me
know that i usually spend most of my night in the chill space :)... 

i'll also hopefully be wearing my sfraves laminate. 

please come out and support djtom and the
others who have put this party together. i think it's going to be really
great, and the more of you who come, the greater it will be. 

hope to see you all there! 

love,

brian

I'm all for pirate radio stations, but there's a 100% legal option I 
think all you sfraves people should know about. Non-commercial stations 
like KZSU are all-volunteer; anyone in the community (i.e., greater bay 
area) is welcome to come down, get involved with the station, take a DJ 
training class, and get their own show. Unlike pirate radio stations, we 
have a huge music library, trained engineers, a support staff, and a 
pretty good transmitter range.

Anyone who has music (or ideas) they want to share with the public can 
contact me about getting involved with KZSU.

What's goin' on for a girl who needs some HOUSE?  We're talking deep
house...  I think I need a break from all the trance and techno tonight.

Hi everyone!!

Tonight I had planned on going to either Chrysalis ar 2o12 depending on 
whichever was easier to get to but after I was sexually assaulted on the bus 
yesterday I don't feel like going anywhere by myself.  So...if anyone is going 
to either one of those and wouldn't mind a companion give me a call.  I live at 
SF State, have gas money if needed, do not smell, and have a sense of humor.  I 
don't mind meeting another public trans. soul if need be.  My number is 
415-406-4133.  I might be taking a nap so leave a message, the phone ringing 
will wake me up but I'm not always in a mood to talk the second I wake up so I 
will call back almost immediately.

Thank you,
	Megan         Czefir

I'm mixing with CD's, mastering onto DAT. One of the big problems I
have is that i can't always be cheking my DAT levels for overload, and
when i do overload, it sounds horrible. Also, my neighbors are getting
tired of my loudness, so i figure if i compress, at least it'll seem
louder... Anyways, it's high time to get a compressor/limiter.

Anybody have any recommendations on a stereo unit that sounds good, here
are the ones i have seen in catalogs, etc.

	Alesis Nano Compressor (about $200.00)
	Aphex "Tubesessensce" compressor (???)
	Behringer MDX2100 Composer (about $220)
	Rane Mojo MC22 ($299)
	DBX 262 (about $200.00)
	DBX 166A (about $350.00)
	DBX 1066 (about $500.00)
	TC Electonics "Finalizer" (about $2000).

The last one looks awesome and can also function as a high-end A/D
unit, 5 band parametric EQ, normalizer, stereo enhancer, and lots of
other stuff, but it's about 4X what I want to spend (about
$300-500.00)...

Also, anybody recommend a store in the bay area that carries these
units so's i can check 'em out?

You're invited to dinner on Monday! And this dinner is going to
be at the lovely home of Sarah and Steve in beautiful downtown
San Francisco.

This will be an especially wacky pre-Mad dinner, since it's also
Sarah's birthday, so come on down and get your party hat and noise
maker thingee :)

The dinner's going to be potluck, so bring anything you might want to
eat.  Please try to keep food in the vegetarian/vegan end of the
spectrum, as we're both vegans :)

Rather than post directions, please call or email your RSVP (if you
know in advance what you'd like to bring, email that, too) and
directions will be given then.

After dinner, we'll walk over to Mad!

Hope to see you then!!! (dinner starts at 8pm)
Steve: 415.626.5074 (simitzis@netcom.com)
Sarah: 415.487.1433 (saberant@sfsu.edu)

yes, they do this...its not too expensive, I believe that you can legally
broadcast over a two mile radius...but then with the internet you can send
feeds to various locations and have a number of 2-mile stations set
up...you can find flea-radio berkeley at the ashby bart station every
saturday and sunday for the flea market...bring ema demo and theyll
probably play it too!...

House/techno is surging ahead in Europe because it is becoming Disco Part II,
a huge commercialized edifice built on the foundation of an underground
music movement.  There are plenty of old-style "underground" events there,
but the scene seems (from afar, since I haven't visited) to be pushing well
along the popularization curve with all the trappings -- the DJ as star,
club culture overtaking the non-commercial scene, incorporation of house
and techno into commercials, TV and other mass media, and so on.  Some
good, some not so good in all that, I think.  Certainly it mitigates
against innovation and inquisitiveness in both the producer and listener
as far as the music is concerned.  I was buying 75% UK and European in
1993 and 25% domestic, the proportions are nearly reversed now though the
proportion of European releases is far greater.

The change in the dance music magazines from specialist to mass-market is
the biggest indicator.  I really liked Mixmag and DJ a couple years ago,
even as commercial as they were then.  Now they and Muzik and even Jockey
Slut have turned into People for Clubbers, complete with every DJ's favorite
color and pet peeves.  

I had some hope this wouldn't happen with house and techno, but frankly,
it now all seems basically inevitable.

to all you that are paranoid about the "scene" dying out...I am not
afraid...dancing will never be out of style, dancing will never lose its
magic no matter how much press you give it...maybe the "raver" lifestyle
may get a little old, but if you truly love the ritual of dancing and
losing yourself all night long... as has been happening since the dawn of
man then you have nothing to worry about...this energy is not based upon
four million peoples approval, along with camel and budweiser.
I cant say what it is about for me, maybe if you want to talk in person, I
can elaborate about the meaning of dance for ME, but I really believe that
most people here understand but, that is for all to figure out on their
own...but certainly, camel, budweiser, all the mixmags and "popular" press
dont really have a clue...maybe the individuals of the organization do,
But, once the mentality changes to money and control of the popular
opinion, the organization as a whole loses touch with the energy.

NOTHING will ever stop me from dancing!

My first couple of parties I went to had little or no flyering and it was 
there i picked up flyers for future raves I wanted to attend.  Being new 
to the scene at the time and not being "in-the-know", flyers were the only 
ways I knew about parties.

Now that I live in the Central Coast the people around here rely on word 
of mouth and local friends.  If a flyer pops up around here people are 
interested.  There's not much out here in the way of a rave scene so 
anything is better than nothing.  I recently distributed some flyers at 
Quest in Santa Barbra and about everyone picked one up, looked at it and 
gave it to a friend or kept it.  Hardcore ravers will drive the 3 - 4 
hours a weekend here to go to LA or SF because there is not much here. 

   Interest in the rave scene is rasing here.  There are many local dj's 
that just got their start a year or two ago and are making an impact on 
the locals about the rave scene else were.  Seismic flyered well for 
this area and pulled a great crowd.  The party went off past 6am which 
is great for this area and everyone came away with a positive 
impression and wanting more....  But there is not much more unless you 
go south or north.  If I had the time and money I would love to throrw 
a DIY and flyers would be one of the best ways to introduce new people 
to the scene.  

*I think I rambled*

As far as the tras thing you can only hope responcible peopel will throw 
there trash in the cans - providied that there are some.

Hey I post to both SCR and SFR.  It's one of the connections I have left 
to the scene - besides my mixed tapes.  :P

PS I never personally made it to Seismic in SLO but from all my friends I 
heard Thomas Micheal was sic and Kimo threw down some funky shit - over 
all the best organized/promoted party thrown in SLO county to date.
It was on a hill with two large tents -one for chill filled with 
matresses and the other the main dance area.
(I got to requset those party days off - doh!)  

There's another party schedualed for Dec 7th here and i'll post d-tails L8TR.

  PLUR,

       Austin

After warming up with Flouro (happytrance at its best/worst mixed by
Paul Oakenfold), we finally arrived at 2o12 around 11:30. The beats
were mesmerizing, and I immediately found my way over to the speakers
to the right (when facing the DJ booth). And for the next 5 hours, I
was unable to leave that spot. This was psychedelic trance at its best.
Maybe a little bit too soft and fluffy, but still WICKED! The last 45
minutes of these 5 hours were bouncy acid with lots of breaks, and 
definitively the best 45 minutes of the night.

Then at 4:30, 3 things happened...
1. The average BPM dropped from 145 or so to 80. We're not talking DANCE
music anymore, we're talking Fugees and 2Pac (tempowise). Slow, trippy
acid is really neat at 9-10 in the morning, but at 4:30? At 4:30 we should
get the hardest and fastest beats!
2. Someone decided to turn down the volume. And not just a notch or two,
more like 50%. It was about the same level I keep it when my roommates are
asleep. =(
3. The DJ obviously felt that he was done for the night, and started mixing
like ... well, a NON-mixed CD. I can mix better with ONE turntable.

The BPM _did_ pick up after half an hour or so, and the last hour was more
wonderful ACID MAYHEM! But the fact that there was no mixing whatsoever still
lowered the overall score.

And now it's time to bitch. If you don't want to read my bitching, please stop
reading now. =)

Still here? Ok, here goes... I go to a rave to dance to mixed music, I don't
go to a rave to jump around in a circle or watch some slender girl stand on
her head in the middle of the dancefloor (impressive, but the way she shoved
us out of the way was TOTALLY rude!) to unmixed music. I'm sorry if this is
putting down your loving SF-scene, but that's the way I feel. Don't get me
wrong though, the overall vibe at 2o12 was WONDERFUL. It's just these little
things that bug me. =)

I hope everyone had a good weekend, no matter where they went. =)

reespect, jonas

To Tom and everyone who threw 2o12:  You all should be patting yourself 
on the back for a party well done!  The space was excellent, the banners 
and artwork were *breathtaking*.  I am SO glad to have gotten a couple of 
photos of them before some fell down (due to humidity?).

I was surprised to find  that I knew Jeremia, who was one of the first 
dj's I believe.  What a trip.  Last time I saw him, he was living in 
Sacramento helping my exboyfriend in his sound production.  He's come 
quite far!  

Then our very own "Superstar DJ" Tom (as his friends lovingly call him) 
spun a wonderful set.  The power could not keep up with Tom's great energy, 
as it cut out a couple of times.  But hey, sometimes things like that 
happen.  

Then Dutch came on after Tom and his music worked me.  That's all I can 
say.  I was by the right front speaker, too, watching Jonas and his 
glowing head, but I mostly closed my eyes and deeply tranced out for what 
seemed like hours.  Thank you for that, Dutch - I really needed that!

One more thing before I sign off.  NubChaiCircus - what is their secret 
ingredient for their magic chai?!?!  I make the stuff at home now (my 
first chai was NubChai at Burning Man) and it's just not the same!  
Theirs is ***SOOOO*** much better!  Everyone I know now is addicted to 
the stuff.  I can see it becoming the next big thing to those who are 
coffee'd out.

love,
Amy

...to Michael Clay and his stunning visuals @ 2o12.

Particularily for showing BRAKA.  Melanie told me how the creator of 
that film traveled all over the world, capturing people in spiritual, 
ecstactic bliss during religious rituals, or just meditating by 
themselves. It was really a unifying experience for me, because I felt 
we were all participating in our own ritual as we were watching others do 
it in their way.

That's exactly what rave flyers should be, an invitation. I love those
simple ones, especially the last Hug O' War flyer.

High SFR!

I agree with Jonas on this one. The party was dope until 4:30 when "3
things happened...," that's when I finally stopped dancing. Actually, the
beat got so slow, that I ended up going home. Overall, it was one of the
best parties that I've been too in a while. I found myself slipping into a
trance several times that night and it felt soooo good.

 I look foward to going to BBQ and BEATS III next weekend if everything
works out. I haven't met most of you from the list, but I plan on changing
that this weekend.

PLUR and 420!
Bonghitter!!

Hit Discovery right after a whoppin spaghetti lunch at OJ's (it was local for a 
SanJosean like me).  Nice to see an outdoor, mellow production with some nice 
music, and a group of people all having a good time.  Too simple a formula.  
Just be outside on a nice day and have fun.  Had to leave after no time at all 
though... whaa.

Went for a tour of the Bay area for the benefit of my friend from LA.  Too bad I
ran out of time for the MOMA... I wanted her to see the giant multimedia potato 
from hell.  Went to band practice, they were all drunk when I got there.  It 
went on forever.

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>Actual Chrysalis Review Here<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

Finally left for Chrysalis around 1:00.  Picked up Phil and Kate after they were
stranded at the map point, which really put a positive tilt on everything (Phil 
admits to being an alien, Kate just has a great accent, both were FULL of 
energy).

Got there at two.

Found out I missed Deak's set.  I like Deaks because he spins like I drive.  
Hectic, spazzy, and spins his wheels sometimes coming around corners.

EconoRaver Victory...
$1 water bottles and free fills at the fountain thingy... nice to find after a 
$15 ticket.  You can make a profit on $1 water.  I think the vegan fruit 
smoothies were $2 bucks.  Nice for the budget raver.

Had to take care of freshly out of box newbie from LA (Lesly says big hi to 
everybody she met this weekend BTW).  E hit a little hard for the uninitiated 
one.  Had fun telling funny stories at whisper volume all night to cheer her up.
 She felt a lot better as the morning came, and I took her to the chill room to 
dance to a great morning set from whoever it was *sorry* (thanks for showing us 
those morning clouds John).  I will never hear "What's going on" by Marvin Gaye 
the same way, a definite compliment to whoever was spinning around 6:30am 
for keeping the groove with the crowd.

On the Main Room...
There's a part of me that honestly wishes that trance dj's would play something 
other than trance in their sets.  Two sets in a row I heard nothing but hard 
trance being played, and it seems like there's more that can be done.  I've 
heard some DJ's mix it up stylewise, and those are the sets I walk (or crawl) 
away from feeling like I've finished a journey.  If it's the same sounding music
at the same speed with the same 4/4 kick drum, how could it be going anywhere?  
It was also very steamy/hot/funky in there, on account of 100 groovers, no vents
and one fan.

Anyway, the night was a bittersweet kind of beautiful, and it's great to see the
sun after a long night of helping keep somebody sane and comfy.

As I we left, somebody was found who had overdone it, apparently on Ketamine.  
My heart goes to her brother, who was outside and scared, and to her, hoping 
that all goes well.  Other than that, I guess there's little I can say or do 
except hope.  To everybody who does chemicals, be careful.

Peace,
AndyW

My major point is not that the well-off are paying too much in taxes,
it's that
the way the tax load is DISTRIBUTED results in a built-in bias toward
more
government.  The fact that some citizens taxes are increased to benefit
other citizens is what  cannot be justified - it's merely one group
taking money
away from another, whether they can "afford" it or not.  A perverse side
effect
of increased government spending is that taxes on ALL citizens tend to
increase.  If you dropped income taxes to zero on low income earners,
they
would still be groaning under the weight of all the sales taxes,
property taxes
(which they pay indirectly when they rent), car registration "fees",
road tolls,
etc.....

     it seems kinda funny that a couple hundred years ago (give or take a 
     few years) we had a revolution because the english government raised 
     our taxes to 13%.  now we're in upwards of 40-50% (i hear the worst 
     tax bracket to be in is $100,000/year, married).  who knows?  maybe 
     there'll be a silent revolution...

Hey kids!

Thanks to all who made it to the Gateway party Saturday.  Thanks for the
review Andy.  Here are some random comments...

Yes, Deaks moves wax like a well greased hive...  =)  There were a number
of comments that Deaks shouldn't have spun first, but one, I love that
someone has to get the cogs turning, and who better than Ernie?  Second, I
feel it was pretty fair consulation that he spun for 2hrs. and 20min.  =)
Anyone wishing to hear more of Ernie Deaks should consider the Pro Soy
event "Wyrd" on the 23rd.  (BSP:  I'll be spinning in the morning, as well.)

Yeah, probably enough to cover gas from CostCo to the party and back.  =)

Joe Rice and Brad were spinning in the morning.  I believe it was Brad that
spun MG.  My kind of guy...=)

I can't comment on the music you like or don't like.  All I know, is that
it was consistent, and pounding, and there were a lot of people loving
it...I think the best way to make an impact, is to get involved.  If you
like sets where DJs mix it up, lead by example.  I'm not saying this to
sound harsh, or be an asshole.  It's just that everyone has their taste and
style.  Have you ever watched Minor Minor spin?  Dude, that cat is working
the Rane so hard.  It's amazing!

As for the heat, that's an issue with the venue.  The sound was too loud on
the street to open windows.  There's really not much you can do there.  I'd
love to hear your ideas.  Consider this, however:  There needs to be foam
on the windows for sound proofing, there are power limitations, and there
are two small openings into the main room.  A sound system can't build
vents in the space, can't force people not to dance there, and there was
more than one fan.  Heat is a part of the dance studio, much as it was a
part of Acme, and Komotion, and King Street, and....  It's something that
comes with the territory.  The third room wasn't officially ours to use,
and we risked a lot to let peopel chill in there, but I allowed it to help
let people get a breath of fresh air.

She's okay.  It was GHB.  I think she may have taken some K, but it was
mostly a GHB thing.  She woke up yesterday and is alright now.  I agree,
Andy, people have got to be careful of what they take.  That stuff is a
promoter's nightmare.

Anyway, thanks again folks, it was a fun little party.  =)

Love
Tony

P.S.  How about that chill space?  Man, with the laser hitting the crystal?
Brilliant!

Greetings all!
I did have a rather hectic weekend .... all good though!
I was in L.A. friday nigth and went to the wicked party and had a great 
time. Doc Martin and Garth rocked my world ( my part of the world that 
digs house anyway). An excellent set by Stefan in the other room. He 
platyed the most eclectic set I've ever seen anyone play before. Cool.

Drove back up here after a few hours of sleep so that I could follow my 
heart and go to 2012. 2012 was one of those things that I JUST HAD TO BE AT!
It was sublime! THank you Jason, Lauren, Tom etc. for everything. The 
good folks at Nubchai circus kept me going for a long time with their 
excellent chai, fruit, and most importantly phat love vibe in everything 
they did.
Excellent music all the way through. I was having too good a time and 
digging on that pure energy in the room to notice any of the sound 
malfunctions that I've been reading about. 
Got to meet tons of really aware people! 
In essence, I have never felt at home with the vibe as I did with 
everybody at 2012. I will be there all the way for anything these 
guys do next.
The enormous group hug , Om session, and spontaneous hugs all night 
reinforced the essence of Goa for me.

Thank you all for being there and making it one of the 
most special nights of my life.


Until next time
Peace and Love
Dhiren

They usually wear sportswear (Adidas, etc.), and often a hat down low that 
adds to the feeling of attitude, and they often dress similarly within 
their group.

     well, you know, this sort of thing is like the earthquake of 1989,

Subject: my weekend of fruit
Sender: sfraves-owner@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk


This weekend was insane. I stayed awake for 34 hours, went to four
parties, and had an incredible time (despite the fact that I was
sick). This weekend was a blur in every sense of the word, so here's
a whirlwind review of each party:

- Cyborganic

Most of you probably hadn't heard of this, since it was private party
at the Cyborganic offices. There was techno and jungle in the
basement, though not that many people were dancing. Weird Blinking
Lights played, which brought back some of my tweakier memories of
Burning Man. Talked to some friends, ate some fruit, and left.

- 2012

This was the party to be at last night! The people involved with 2012
did a *beautiful* job of decorating the space, probably the best use
of the D7 warehouse that I've seen yet. Todd's blacklight art made yet
another appearance, and many other banners and glowing things in the
Mayan theme covered the walls.

I caught most of Tom and Dutch who spun some excellent psychedelic
trance. The music was so good that I was almost tempted to stay and
discontinue my party hopping (some of the people I was party hopping
with decided to stay, though).

The vibe that they created at 2012 was amazing. It just goes to show
you what happens when a few ravers get together with all of the energy
and positivity that they can gather to throw their own party. Not
big-wig rave promoters, not business people after the "rave market";
just plain good folks who want to share an evening of music and
celebration.

And of course, Nub Chai :) was there, those wonderful people who made
Chai such a special part of my life. So I drank a lot of Chai, talked
to some friends, ate some fruit, and left.

- Gateway (Chrysalis)

I came here around 4:30/5-ish. I'm glad I went - I was able to see
many friends that I had seen at the other two parties. I came just in
time to see Greg spin, which was nice; he was spinning exactly the
kind of music I was in the mood for. He ended (or what I thought was the
end) his set was a nice mellow song that wound everyone down.

But then he decided to sneak in one more...pretty hard and
thumping. It was just enough to get me pumped up for the next party :)
After that, the music ended for the night, so I talked to some
friends, ate some fruit, and left.

- CCC

While at 2012, I had heard of a CCC party that was a mere block away
from my house; so why not? Okay, it was 7am, but I was sure they would
keep it going until at least 9am.

So I arrived at party number four. And looking around, all I saw were
remains of a wonderful night. I have loved CCC events since Burning
Man, but unfortunately there were too many other things going on this
weekend for me to have gone to this one in its entirety.

They finished the morning with some beautiful spiritual ambient music,
but still very much with a Goa feeling. I ate some fruit, and left,
feeling grounded and energized.

- Other stuff

After all of the celebration, fruit, and Chai that I absorbed, I had
too much energy in me to even think about sleeping. So I spent the
entire day, mostly wide awake and happy doing things. After much
prodding from people ("you should sleep you crazy fool!") I finally
forced myself to go to bed later on that night...simply an insane
weekend :)

Too bad there was no Sunset! I was definitely up for that!!!

- Gripe section

I have a small gripe/request that relates to map points. Frequency 8
is not the best location to use for a map point, especially when the
party is downtown (ie. SOMA). For people who are already coming up
from the South or East Bay, this might not present a problem.

But for those of us who are local to San Francisco, it can be somewhat
difficult. I would like to ask promoters to please try to keep map
points within 8 or so blocks of the party, and at the very least have
the map point and the party on the same bus line.

Thanks; I know of others who have this gripe, and I thought I would
present it here for consideration/flaming :)

- Future plans

Hopefully, we'll see some of you tonight at our crazy pre-Mad dinner
party. Or if not, at Mad :)

Steve

Stay away from the Alesis, it's nasty... TC Electronics is high end stuff,
if you can afford it it's the best thing on the list.

The Behringer is a good unit (they operate by making knock-offs of better,
higher priced gear - I think this one's based on an Aphex), as is the Aphex
Tubessence. I think this goes for about $200-300??? Aphex makes great
stuff, definitely have a listen to that one. If you're in the market for
something a bit pricier (but not as much as the TC), try out an Aphex
Compellor, or one of the other Aphex high-end dynamics processors - they're
well worth the money, the sound great and add a lot of warmth to the sound.
(If you're primarliy looking for something to keep overloading your DAT for
mastering, you may even want to check out their Dominator II Limiter -
absolute brickwall limiting that sounds great even at limiting levels of 15
dB or greater). I also have used the dbx 1066 and 166A and find them to be
good - the 1066 is a nice unit with lots of control over the dynamics, you
need to be careful and know what you're doing with this one. The other dbx
units have fewer controls and are easier to set up and get a good sound out
of.

Dunno about the Rane, but they generally make good gear. Also check out the
Drawmer DL 241 for about $500, nice compression unit that's easy to use.

Try out Leo's on Van Ness (or in Oakland on Telegraph) if you want
demonstrations of this stuff... Cutting Edge in SF is a good place to buy
but they don't have a lot of stock on hand to test with.

It sounds to me like your application is more limiting than compression.
Most compressor/limiters have a fairly puny limiting section - often one
"peak stop" knob. If this is truly what you need it for - keeping a DAT
from clipping - and you're not interstied in general compression, I'd
seriously consider getting a dedicated limiter instead. There's not many on
the market, but you might find that you'll have more precise control and
better sound out of something that's designed to do that job exclusively.

Thats NOT true...   According to the FCC rulz and regs,  you're only allowed
to run 100 miliwatts,  and ONLY if it son't interfere with esisting
services,   HOWEVER....  If you DO put up a pirate station,  amd make
awfully darned sure your signal is CLEAN and has no harmonics that would
interfere (Which is technically hard to do),   it's possible to operate
the station with little or no interference from the FCC...  The First
tima a complaingt comes in (even from that old lady upstairs with interference
patterns on her TV set),  you're OFF THE AIR...   However,  with Cable YV
being the norm these days,   that is less likely.

        OK, well, pot isn't a drug really, it's a naturally occurring
substance right??? What about psilocybin mushrooms, are they a drug, nope,
they're a fungus. And hey, alcohol is a naturally occurring substance (sure
people make it), but it's a natural process of fruit of wood fermenting. . .
is that a drug? What about nicotene, it isn't made by man (well not really)
it's a chemical that's in tobacco leaves, another naturally occurring plant,
is nicotene a drug? What about peyote (however it's spelled), or morning
glories, or tenactl (I think that's right), or other naturally growing
substances that are used for certain spiritual enhancement?

        Now a question for you all: Is whatever not a drug unless you use it
as one?
   At what point is use and abuse seperated?
   Is it only a drug if it's man made?
   

        Now I think that most everything has been made into a drug. Sure pot
may be a plant, but it's so mutated for strength or whatever that's it's not
natural anymore. Like nature made hydroponic green bomb weed. . . yeah. . .
sure.

        I personally think that marijuana shoul not be legalized for any
purposes other than medical reasons. It's not going to help the world any.

I haven't seen no reviews on 2nd Chakra!
 I'm not much of a poet but: Roses are red and violins are brown. At 2nd
Chakra. Well EVERYBODY got down!
 I am probably the only person in the world that has to blow of nurmorous
bad vibes every Saturday night. But I had a blast at this party! NEXUS has
got it together big time.
 I stayed in the chill room for like three hours when I got there. E'in
tornadoes! They were playing some realy fun music in there. Everyone was
move from side to side just having a great time! Kinna like on that movie
Grease Lightning. How everyone on there was always boogyin down together...
 But check it out. Sence I love to whine so much n all...  Check it out. 
My friend Luciana went with me last night.. And we were kicking it in the
chill room fer quite awhile nStuff.. It felt so good to just lay there and
chill yanno?
Well I finally talked her into getting off her ass, so we could go dance.
And on the way to the main room we held hands (most likely becouse Luciana
didn't want every guy hitting on her on the way there). 
 But all the people you may have heard me talk about before. Well they were
trippin! I heard:
"Check it out! He has a girlfriend!!!"
"What the...  Now I am really confused"
"Who is she.." <snobby>
And alot of other things, some flattering, some just plain rude "Bla, bla,
bla." anyways.
 Well. I care about Luciana alot. And I would like to be with her. But she
likes tall guys, buff guys, brunets, tan. And alot of other things I am
none of. Even though I feel she likes me too...  I still think about
thoughs things. So I think we would be better off just friends becouse of
her standards nAll..

 Later on while we were dancing (apart) <--- You know.. To be honest. I
have trouble dancing in contact with women to "techno"..  It just don't
click.  I used to be the master at the Hip Hop clubs.. But I have no
practice slow dancing to Jungle, sorry.  =[   Anyways.. While we were
dancing. I saw this guy with a hat just like the one she whore at the last
ravE. I wanted her to have one. So she went up to the guy and borrowed his
hat. Then she came back and told me she was going to dance with him for
awhile. Ok..  Cool. I seem to dance better alone anyways right?
 Well while she was dancing with him. Thoughs people.. GOD! They thought I
let her slip away (maybe I did)  So I hear things like:
"What an idiot! She took off"
"What? Your mom won't let you have sex tell you get out of high school?"
"Check him out. He is leaving alone"
And much, much more funny Stuff......
Whats up with this?  Why do people care so much about my sexual prefrence
and status? What is so special about me? So I am the only person at the
ravE, not seen kissing some girl? I doubt that.  And um it's not that I
don't wanna kiss no girls.. I realized that girls did not have the koodies
along time ago. Lemme tell yea.. And I have already had my share of good n
bad relationships.
 Most people seem offended that I don't talk to them (heard it).  But they
don't talk to me either.. Well.. Only behind my back.. Sheeesh how rude
huh..

Got to get back to work though..
Cami. I sent a letter to the rave page at work. But I don't see it on
here..  I was looking for you.. I lost all my current HDD stuff..  My drive
stopped spinning. And everything for the last month or so that was not
backt up. GONE!
So E-Mail me.....

Subject: Let me tell you about the kind of guy I am (a love story)
Sender: sfraves-owner@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

Friday night, my homeboys tried to talk me into checking out a rave in San
Francisco, but I had other plans.

See, sometimes on Friday nights I get in the mood to hop in my IROC and
sliiiiiide on down to the Sound Factory to check out the score, if you
catch my drift.  And having a bunch of your homeboys hanging around when
you're looking for love just ain't the bus I'm lookin to ride.

So once I had myself looking all fresh in my new Gucci loafers, black 501's
and my P.I.M.P. t-shirt, I jumped in the ride, dropped the pedal to floor,
and let the house beats  pump out the trunk, tossing empty Colt 45's out
the window, just to let everyone know what time it was.  Cause that's the
kind of guy I am.

Johnny was working the door down at the Sound Factory, and he don't like me
coming around these days, on account of my reputation on the dance floor.
I guess all the boys there start fussing and pouting when I'm macking the
ladies, so ole' Johnny finally had to put a stop to it.  But  twenty bills
and a fresh pack of Marlboros in his breast pocket was an easy cure for his
bouncer blues, and soon enough I was saddling on up to the bar to scope out
the freshies.

Well, wouldn't you know it, over there in the corner, dancing atop the
speakers, was the finest, tightest-jeans wearing score I had seen.  And lo
and behold, she, too was wearing a shirt that said P.I.M.P.!

"What's this?" I asked myself, freaking my way across the floor with a Bud
in my hand.  "Ain't nobody can pimp the pimp!  Ain't nobody can play the
playa!"

So I climbed onto the speakers to get to acquaint myself with my heavenly
doppelganger, this denim-wearing shadow of my psyche.  A Jungian fantasy in
the making, with potential eroticism and psychological metaphors far
greater than in Basic Instinct!  Be I her darkness, or she mine?

So what I did was, I went up to her and said, "Hey, baby, ain't your name
'Damn'?  'Cause that the first thing I thought when I seen you."  Then I
proceeded to come to familiarities with her.

Together, we tweaked with the tweakers, freaked on the speakers, and
circle-danced for hours as only lovers could, but when the time came for me
to work my charms and ease her on back to my crib, she protested,  "Oh no,
Boomerang, that wouldn't be right."

"Damn,"  I said,  "You better check your crossfader, baby, 'cause you're
spinnin' two different records at the same time, if you catch my drift.
You're playin' "Let's Get Busy" on one turntable and "Uh-Uh No Way" on the
other, and that's a bad mix, baby.  I swear, I'm not trying to Mac on you
or nothing.  I was just thinking you could come on back for a glass of wine
and a little massage.  I just wanna get to know you better, on a mental
level. 'Cause that's the kind of guy I am."

"Well, if it's platonic, I guess,"  she said finally, and next thing I
knew, we were jamming across the bridge to my pad.

I pulled the old trick on her about "just a massage", but once I had Otis
Redding on the radio and a little bit of wine in her, she couldn't help
succumbing to the boomerang charms.

Afterward, though...oh, man, let me tell you about afterwards.

I sat up on the edge of the bed, and started crying like a baby.  It was
weird--one minute I was balling, the next minute I was bawling.  It didn't
make no sense to me.  Usually when I get all emotional on the ladies, it's
to get something juicy.   I said, "Shoot, baby,  I don't know why I done
you like this.  I brung you back here, took advantage of you, pimping you
and macking you like you was an object.  Shucks, I didn't even tell you I
got a girlfriend."

She said, "Aww, now don't you worry, Boomerang.  What you did to me ain't
so bad.  Plenty of people done worse things than what you done to me."

I began to feel a little better.  I wiped away my tears and said,  "Yeah?
People done worse than what I done to you?"

"Sure.  Hey, take me, for example.  I knew I had warts when I met you!"

Hey now,
Chai is actually the Hindi word for "tea"...personally the chai I've had most
places outside goes way overboard on the cinnamon and clove, but that's just my
opinion...what exactly is in Chai depends on who's making it (or perhaps what
part of India they are from)...I think the stuff that is sold at cafes etc
usually has ginger, cinnamon, cardamom, clove...and is boiled with milk.  Of
course, there's tea in it also :o)

My fave way to make it...all my friends really dig it...boil up some water in
a teapot, throw some cardamom seeds and a cinnamon stick in there, you can 
add maybe one or two cloves and a bit of ginger if you like...when it boils
add some black tea (even lipton teabags are fine, or get your fave black
tea)...put it in, let it boil for maybe a minute, take it off the heat, let it
brew for just maybe 2-3 min, pour, add milk and sugar.  There!  Your very own
homemade chai, and you didn't have to go to a cafe to have it!! ;)
some people use half milk and half water and boil it all up.  your tastes may
vary.
that's probably more info than you wanted, but oh well :^)
I love chai, it's the first thing I ever learned how to make :-)

namaste ;)

If all it does is mellow people out a bit, it would totally help the world.

Tell me this: how could legalisation harm the world?

Hi!

So, once again, I find myself saying, "Please offer suggestions."

Here's the scenario:

You need a place, about 8 blocks from 150 Folsom.  It has to be open until
2am, it has to be safe and secure, and it can't be just some public area
for there will the the transfer of thousands of dollars over the course of
the night.

Next, find me one of those 8 blocks from 24th and Mission.

Any suggestions welcome.

(We'll make fine promoters out of you all, just you see...=)

Tone

P.S.  The planning of a party can be very difficult.  What happens, most
times, is you have to rely on the resources that are available.  The ideal
party would have a map point 8 blocks from the party, or even better, 8
blocks from everyone going to the party.  ;^)  But that can't happen.  As
it happens, the record stores most willing to provide the wonderful service
of playing map point happen to be on upper Haight Street.  That's just the
way it is right now, in the underground rave scene in San Francisco.  I'm
sure that will change with time.  Most of the promoters I know would be
very happy to hear that you've unearthed a more centrally located, safe,
secure, cheap map point.  Peace!  =)

Sorry, I only caught the tail end of this.  Is someone planning on setting
up a microbroadcast?  Hmmm...  I've been doing a monthly gig at Radio Libre
in SF.. they've been pulling it off for quiet awhile, with a littlebit of
heat from the FCC.  If one of y'all is interested in talking to someone
about how this is done, rules & regs, etc., respond privately...I might be
able to connect you with the people who are running Radio Libre..

that was my first rave in over a month, and boy that was the BEST, most
RAD, experience in my whole 3.5 years of raving!!!  If anyone was at 2012
they should know me.  I was walking arround to everyone, and I do mean
everyone, saying hi and seeing how they were doing, asking if they were on
E, and if they weren't I told them they should be.  I was on 2.5 hits of
it.  The E at that party was killer.  The music was even BETTER, the
screens were very RIGHT ON!!!!!!!  The envionment there was sooo positive,
friendly, happy place to be.  I didn't realize how much I missed the rave
community until Sat. night, I felt sad when the party ended, there was soo
much positive energy from everyone there that they shouldn't have broken up
the party.  I can't wait until Friday, 4 days until I go to Famtasia, not
sure where I am going on Sat.  Any suggestions?????? 
P.S.
Highlight of the night:
some of my friends and I were smoking out near the speakers, and I looked
down and someone dropped us off food and water and I no one in our group
saw the person.  Who ever that was I am going to find them, and give them
the biggest happy raver hug I can give! 

Rave on,
	Eric

THERE IS NO REASON IN THE WORLD that water should cost $2.
Anyone and their uncle can go to Costco (considering that they are a
member) and by boxes of 24 of those little guys for $4.69.

With tax, that's about $5.  with a $24 dollar income, you're makin'
about twenty bucks per box.  that's over 75% profit margin.  To anyone
that knows anything about business and retail, that's damn good.

Also, there are many people (me included) that think that free water
should be available at parties.  If you wana sell water aside from the
free stuff, that's one thing, but tryin to squeeze every penny you can
out of ravers makes me feel like a wary consumer more than a care-free
raver.  

In my opinion, the price or lack of price of water at a party makes a
big impact on the atmosphere the promoters set for their party.  Do they
want people to have fun and create an environment for people to be
comfortable, making sure that people have water, and making sure that
there is adequite ventilation, or do they just want to get people's
admission money, and then close their eyes and wait for 6 AM.

I don't know about how the scene exists in other countries, and don't
really know much about how it is in other parts of this country.  But
the scene here will never die.  It changes, yes, and there are elements
we might not be all to appreciative of, but you can't change what other
people do or think.

You can change what you think and do.  Be positive.  Contribute to the
positive scene and make raves what you want them to be.  There are many
people raving today that were in the scene five or more years ago.  Yes
things are not the same as they were back then, but there will ALWAYS be
an underground.  No matter how comercialized the music becomes, there
will always be a cutting edge of underground that stick together and
know what positive energy is truly made of.

     Geez,
     
     I would be really worried if we were stating opinions as fact...
     
     Suffice to say we don't know what would happen if the entire planet 
     got stoned.  They might all go to sleep, or eat all the cookies in the 
     world causing riotous economic upheaval or they might realize we've 
     all been assholes for a really long time and try to change things for 
     the better.
     
     Anything that alters perception can be considered a psychoactive drug, 
     and I KNOW pot alters perception.
     
     But I think it's a personal choice and should be a personal choice 
     without legal recourse.  If you feel it should be illegal, just pick 
     up the phone and call 911, and mention my name, President Clinton's 
     (it's not inhaling that's illegal you know), as well as the majority 
     of people on this list.  The only reason we are free to do it as many 
     of us do currently is the present ineffectiveness of drug laws.  A law 
     that cannot be enforced makes a mockery of justice.  I don't want to 
     raise my children in a place where I have to explain laws that have 
     lower mandatory terms for rapists and murderers (people who HAVE 
     committed evil against other people) than for certain types of drug 
     dealers (try to think of them as Robin Hood liquor stores that MIGHT 
     be hurting other people for the sake of this argument).
     
     If you have ever even tried illicit drugs, I'd recommend you lay off 
     being a hypocrite as well (you've opened up and told us about your 
     shroom/lsd experiences if I remember correctly).  Too many people 
     tried something a couple years back, but "know better" now.  Too bad 
     that if they'd been caught 'back then', they'd still be serving time 
     today.  Let the penalty fit the crime... oh it was no big deal... than 
     work with us on reducing mandatory drug possession penalties, not 
     badmouthing a drug that doesn't happen to fit comfortably into your 
     particular lifestyle.
     
     Fact is more people die yearly from lung cancer/heart disease as a 
     result of cigarettes than all illicit drug od's and drug related 
     accidents combined.
     
     Source:(http://www.drcnet.org/)
     
     :)
     
     You decide what's right to do with your own body and mind... oh wait, 
     you can't... the law won't let you.
     
     Peace,

     oh, ps by the way, they're around 30 dollars.  i believe that's what 
     30 cents per gallon as opposed to $2 a bottle.  and think of the 
     landfills you'll be saving for other stuff instead...

It's really not that hard for the promoters to pay for water and give
it away. We are filling up old gallon jugs with the 25cent vending
machine water, and giving it away at Elevation. It may not be evian, but
it's non-tap, and its good.

 I figure that 20 gallons will be enough for around 300 people, and
that's a cost of a whopping $5. Ouch! ;?) And to think that we're only
charging $5 to get in. So one person comes through the door, we've made
our money back.

 We're also making coffee all night long, and giving that away too.
Didn't cost us that much either. Bought a brand new 100cup coffee
machine for $30, 5 pounds of starbucks coffee for $10, and that'll be
more than enough for our tribe of Elevators. So that's another $40. So,
we need another 7 people to walk through the door to make that money
back.

 Now you come to a differnet problem. CUPS! now you have to go out and
buy cups, and then people will leave them somewhere else, and everytime
they want more water, they want a new cup. So, that's kinda tricky. So
you buy 300 cups, and go through them very easily. But, for an outdoor
venue, lots of people bring their own bottles, and hold on to them
throughout the night, eliminating the cup crisis.

 Then we've got fruit and bread. Spent $40 on that, so we need another 7
people to come. So to get paid back for all of that stuff, we need 15
paying guests....sounds a little too easy huh?  Well, it is.

 Promoters need to think of the people more often, and think of what
they are giving to them. Albeit, getting big name dj's can cost a lot of
cash, but if you use locals who aren't charging $500 a set, you'll be
ok.


 Where am I going with this? A lot of promoters want to gouge you at
every angle, and it's immediately accepted by most ravers. It seems fair
to you at the time, but when you go to an event where things like water
and fruit are free, you know that you're getting a lot more than what
you paid for.

 I'm happy in knowing that I am giving something to the people that come
to the party, and not scamming all of their cash away from them. I'm a
raver like everyone else, but I look at other events, and see what I
would want to be different, and act accordingly.

Demand Free water!!!

Hi. A couple people responded to me who were interested in getting 
involved with KZSU, so I'm going to post some general info here.

It's really a great organization with a lot of 
crazy-knowledgable people -- I've learned a lot about music from working 
there.

We have organizational meetings once per quarter, where we invite anyone 
who's interested to come out, apply for a spot in our (free) DJ training 
class, and find out about working around KZSU. The next org. meeting is 
scheduled for Wednesday, 8 January, at 7:30, location TBA, but somewhere 
on Stanford Campus. If you can't make it to that meeting, or if you want 
to get involved ASAP, come down to KZSU on a Monday night (staff meeting 
night), and I can introduce you to some people and hopefully get you 
working. ( Did I mention that to have a show at KZSU, one has to do at 
least 15 hours of work at the station per quarter... work includes 
reviewing music, writing public service announcements, alphabetizing the 
music library, recording promotional stuff, contacting clubs, etc.)

	This is something I am torn over. On the one hand, I believe
people should be able to do what they want with their bodies. On the
other, making the promoters of a party deal with your overdose or your
friend's overdose is totally out of the question. One of the things that
most people who eat scheduled substances complain about is that it is my
right to do with my body what I what (something I totally agree with).
Yet with that statement is implied or should be implied as long as I am 
not hurting or demanding things of other people, would that be a fair 
assumption of what we mean?
	When someone overdoes it, one necessary places themselves on the 
help of ours (unless you pass out in a corner, and come back to without 
breaking things or before that party ends and clean up has occured and 
the owner wants the space back...). This becomes a problem when those 
whose responsibility the overdoer becomes do not want the responsibility, 
such as the EMS people who get to hear "I don't know" to questions of 
dosages and the like so they can figure out how to handle the situation. 
This problem becomes even larger in the current state of affairs because 
when a call is made to EMS, a police officer is also dispatched and 
depending on the beliefs of the officer, a stink could be raised and 
parties could be hassled more or it will be viewed as just what is was 
someone either fucking up or being irresponsible either in not knowing 
their dosages or combining too many things together.
	I guess my anger as it is, stems from those who knew the girl
paniced (ok, I can see that happening, but is that an excuse?). Gateway
called an ambulance to help the girl because helping the girl was their
first concern (I don't think anyone there had much experience with k and
GHB induced unconsciousness nor should they be required to be). Because of
that concern, there was the possiblity that they will NEVER be able to
throw another party without police sercuity, searches on entry and the
like.
	When we are in circles of people who use illecit substances, we
can become repsonsible for our friends and here was a case where people
were not prepared for that responsiblity. I hope they either will be in
the future, will better educate themselves, or will stop doing illecit
substances (but I suppose there is the consideration that one does not
know exactly what they are prepared for until they get there). I work in
an industry where people immediately believe a speech like this assigns
blame, but I am not interested in assigning blame because I don't know
this situation, I leave that to the people involved, and hopefully they
will be able to deal with whatever went wrong and not just point a finger
at someone else.  This is a cold hard opinion of mine - people exceeding
their limits and leaving themselves to the responsiblity - of which this 
was an example - is one of the LARGEST reasons I believe drugs remain 
illegal (that is based on everyone believing one cannot be trusted with a 
choice which is based on their conceived ideas that those who chose this 
obviously fucked up and since those who fucked up are the only examples 
of people have that a decision on a certain choice, it seems they always 
tend to believe that that same decision will result in the same end for 
ANYONE who makes that same type of decision)...
	I think people should be allowed to experiment with their 
consciousness and continue to alter or enhance it as they see fit, but 
with that goes the responsiblity of doing such.

	Well, because these were going to be 1/2 benefits for the CBC, 
and since Denis Peron is currently awaiting trial, they have been put on 
hold til they see how the trial goes. They are hoping that once the new 
year comes and the trial is hopefully over that the space will be useable 
for biweekily benefits... Basicly, no one wants to possibly put anything 
more on Dennis's head because Dan Ludburg (or whatever the correct 
spelling is) will most likely use anything he can to convince the jury 
that Dennis is an evil man who should be behind bars...

Ok buddie. . . heregoes. . . 

        Do you actually think that such of a depressant is safe out on the
streets with sooo many drug abusers and stupid people out there? 

        Sure, you probably think that marijuana is as safe as water but only
in small amounts. Don't mix weed with anything else, or else you will end up
hurt or in an accident somewhere. I smoked pot a lot, my friends smoke it
even more. The funnies thing I see while my buds are driving is when they
sit at an intersection and forget where they are for a second. Also, most
weed gives you a phat let-down afterwards, you almost have to go to sleep. 

        Too many people would be smoking it before school: You can't learn
when you're high on pot, you have a very slow reading speed, and your
attention span isn't much worth mentioning either.

        People at work will be stoned out of their minds: Would you want
some loaded guy to put your car together? Or would you rather have a bunch
of stoned guys build a room for your new home? Work will decrease sooo much
that the re-cycle rate for employees will be exceptionally high.

        Would you want to be out on the freeway in traffic with most
everyone around you smoking joints, swerving into your lane and cutting you
off cuz they couldn't move out of the way in time? Or what about following a
kid  who's already sparked a couple and he slams into the car in front of
him, and before you can react (because you never saw his breaklights) you
slam into him?

        I know this os exaggerated, but it's true, and it WILL happen. The
only people I know who want marijuana legalized are people who obviously
smoke too much or are under educated. But hey, isn't more than half of this
country?

        I don't really think that making kids addicted to an x-drug would be
a good Idea, and yes, they will become addicted, since it's legal and all,
why not?        

        That's just what I think. . .

It wasn't simply because the Brits raised taxes.  The niggly point had to
do with a complete lack of representation in Parliament. 

erm, at least that's what I remember from 9th grade.

Heck, even I'd start a revolution if there weren't a corrupt Congressman
I could call my own.

My recipe as given by Brian from Harbin:
1 cp of soy milk or cow milk
1 cp of water(if you use soy milk)
cardamon, cinnamon, clove, fresh ginger, and gotu kola(optional) to taste.
2 tblsp of sugar
2-4 teabags of black or green tea

add all ingredients but tea and heat over medium-high until milk foams on
top. <breathe> (that really is in the recipe!)  Add tea and turn down heat
allowing the tea to brew for 3-5 minutes. <breathe>  ENJOY!

Yes Adam, the water often is overpriced.  But I think it's time to share 
a different perspective on the subject.

**The price was $1.00 for the same bottle at Gateway.  Consider:  the 
people selling the water take the time and energy to go and buy the water, 
then they carry it all over the place, up stairs, etc. then spend the night 
selling it because too many fucking ravers have yet to figure ou t that they 
need to take care of themselves!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Grow up people.  
Bring your own fucking water, pretend every party is Burning Man.

** So two people work their butts off and make a couple hundred dollars
usually with some proceeds going to the party.

** What is it going to take, a two by four made out of X?  Not every 
venue has running water, major renegades seldom do.  I for one will not 
drink water SOMA, period.  Also, where does it say that the people who 
put on parties have to 'take care of you?" They are busting their asses 
in ways beyond most raver's comprehension to make these parties happen.  
If you smoke or take E, then be fully responsible and carry in your own 
unopened water.  If they don't allow unopened water in, find another party.
For the latter is always a sure sign of greed.

**The ravers are ultimately responsible for whether or not a party goes 
off.  e.g. all of the free tasty water in the solar system isn't going 
too make a party positive energy happen if everyone is on speed. 

If the promoters sell it at too high a price, pick other parties. 
If the venue is a toxic, fire trap, don't go back and let them know why.

**I must consume a minimum of .5 gallon of water at every party I 
experience, just for my health.  I grow weary of having to say no to 
sharing the water I carry..also and lastly, I have no medical insurance 
and I can't afford the risk that sharing water with strangers carries.
In 1993 I had bronchitus four times.  I was raving about three times per 
week for one year and shared my water often, any connection?

Please Adam, teach everyone you know to carry their own water into 
parties and recycle those bottles afterwards.   Lastly there is a 
an even greater ability too let go at a party knowing that 'you' 
have taken care of all of your needs.

There are so many skewed statements here that it's not worth picking 
apart.

The problem with most chemical abuse is not the chemicals themselves.  
Have we not learned from our (recent) history that the solution to 
chemical abuse is not prohibition, but education and social 
responsibility?

Plus, you're only arguing about marajuana, completely ignoring hemp and 
all of its benefits and uses: fast growing crop, can grow in many soils, 
parts can be used for fuel, threads, paper, oils, food, etc, cheaper than 
lumber, infinitely renewable, etc, etc.

And I think you have a lot of nerve for, among other things, calling 
members of the SFRaves list "under educated".  YOU appear to be the 
uneducated one here.

I would have loved to have seen this thread follow a gentle tone, but 
right out of the gate, it's a series of assertions of right and wrong, 
instead of a friendly exchange of information.  There must be a better 
way.

Friendships are forever, lovers are temperary. . . 
        I've had a best friend who's a girl for about 2 years now. It all
started from me breaking up with her best friend because of how my girl at
the time treated me. Now, all my x's old friends are mine, and they all hate
eachother (which I wish didn't happen). But I've got a few friends for life,
and that's the most important thing I can think of. Even through all of the
"messing around" stages, and the "other boy/girl friend" phases, and even
the "We both think we love eachother" phases. But now I love her more than I
ever could if she was my mate (girlfriend was too insufficient).

        Best of luck to yall, I gotta meet you guyz. . . we'll have a phat
three way hug ( I bet I can squeeze harder than anyone, just ask someone who
hugs me ).

AND dont FORGET tO SMILE:), you never know who might be watching, and you
want to look innocent enough. . . 

Aryck

Ok buddie. . . heregoes. . . 
     
        Do you actually think that such of a depressant is safe out on the
streets with sooo many drug abusers and stupid people out there? 

+
Marijuana is not formally considered a depressant.
     
        Sure, you probably think that marijuana is as safe as water but only
in small amounts. Don't mix weed with anything else

+
Works great with Betty Crocker brownie mix in my opinion.

, or else you will end up hurt or in an accident somewhere. I smoked pot a 
lot

+
Then you might be behind bars right now by current law.

, my friends smoke it even more. The funnies thing I see while my buds are 
driving is when they sit at an intersection and forget where they are for a 
second.

+
Are you implying you travel in a car with people who are so stoned that they 
forget where they are... brilliant.  I don't promote irresponsible use of 
any drug.

 Also, most weed gives you a phat let-down afterwards, you almost have to go 
to sleep. 

+
Totally subjective information.  I used to enjoy waking up to a bowl every 
once in a while, without the need to immediately go back to sleep.  I've 
noticed in my own experience that green pot with white crystallized hairs 
(as opposed to red or brown hairs) tends to not have the 'burn out' many 
people associate with marijuana.
     
        Too many people would be smoking it before school: You can't learn
when you're high on pot,

+
Passed AP physics and chem in my junior year with the highest grade in 
the class.  Did book reviews for the school paper.  Pot was a daily thing 
for me back then.  If you can back it with data from somewhere fine... 
otherwise cool it with the subjective arguments.  You're not going to 
convince anybody with data that only makes sense to you.

 you have a very slow reading speed, and your attention span isn't much 
worth mentioning either.

+
I personally don't feel that is true.  Are there any studies you have 
proving this?
     
        People at work will be stoned out of their minds: Would you want
some loaded guy to put your car together?  Or would you rather have a bunch 
of stoned guys build a room for your new home?

+
Have you ever met a real construction worker?  I live with two.  Many of 
them do enjoy the occasional spliff.  Do I think it should be openly 
tolerated in the workplace... no.  It should be treated in a manner similar 
to an alcoholic beverage.

 Work will decrease sooo much that the re-cycle rate for employees will be 
exceptionally high.

+
Recycling is good.  And no, I have not noticed higher turnover in employees 
who indulge.
     
        Would you want to be out on the freeway in traffic with most
everyone around you smoking joints, swerving into your lane and cutting you 
off cuz they couldn't move out of the way in time?

+
No, I'm not asking for legalization of irresponsible behavior.

Or what about following a kid  who's already sparked a couple and he slams 
into the car in front of him, and before you can react (because you never 
saw his breaklights) you slam into him?

+
This could happen from sleep deprivation, or changing a station on the 
radio.  Once again, I don't advocate driving under the influence of 
ANYTHING.
     
        I know this os exaggerated, but it's true, and it WILL happen. The
only

+
I agree that it's exaggerated, but I don't agree it's true.

 people I know who want marijuana legalized are people who obviously smoke 
too much or are under educated. But hey, isn't more than half of this 
country?

+
How about people who think synthetic fabrics are harmful to the environment, 
or people who feel it brings them closer to God (as a few religions do), or 
people who want healthier alternatives to petroleum, or even a return to 
natural hemp rope.  Or how about somebody who is bulimic or has AIDS, or 
somebody who just wants to get high once a year or so?  Or enjoy jazz from 
another perspective or use it to alter their perception of arts or 
philosophy.  So Aryck, am I ... uh... undereducated?
     
        I don't really think that making kids addicted to an x-drug would be
a good Idea, and yes, they will become addicted, since it's legal and all, 
why not?        

Alcohol, Robotussin, Cigarettes, Nitrous Oxide... the junkies are not 
exactly rolling in the streets.  Legal drugs do not pose much of an 
additional threat.  Many physicians consider alcohol much more dangerous 
than marijuana or ecstasy (keep in mind they're starting to believe ecstasy 
and marijuana MIGHT cause minor brain and organ damage in large amounts, 
whereas it's a know fact with alcohol).  I think it's the 'criminal' aspect 
of illicit drugs that causes the most expense to the American people.  We 
don't need gun toting dealers.  To get rid of them, get rid of their source 
of income.  We don't see Budweiser and Miller pushers in the street causing 
problems by shooting at each other over turf wars...

In addition, the legality of a drug has little affect on it's usage.  While 
I agree there would be an increase in use of marijuana, it would not be too 
significant.  During prohibition, it is estimated by many historians that 
alcohol use INCREASED, due to the youth embracing the speakeasy culture of 
open sexuality, irresponsible behavior, a romantic respect for the 
gangsters and a disdain for the religion and morality being pushed on them 
by their parents.
     
        That's just what I think. . . 
        
        +
        I respect your opinion, but not your disregard for the facts.  I find it 
        difficult to appreciate your endorsements of psylocybin mushrooms and 
        lsd when you have such a negative view towards tolerance or legalization 
        of marijuana.  I'm not asking you to smoke it, but you seem really 
        opposed to it, and I find that rather hypocritical.  I understand it's 
        not for everyone, but there are hundreds of people in jail for doing 
        some of the things you claim to have done.  Nobody belongs in jail for 
        possessing drugs, especially for the lengths of time some of these 
        people are in for.
        
        (take a look at http://www.paranoia.com/drugs/war.on.drugs/casualties/)
        
        In addition, the War on Drugs has had serious negative effects on people 
        who don't even touch drugs.  The list of unconstitutional searches and 
        seizures goes on and on.  I hope this doesn't go on forever, because the 
        longer it goes on, the more normal people will think it is.  We need to 
        understand freedom again.
     
Aryck
     
     +
     Peace,
     AndyW
     
     P.S.       Aryck, I apologize if I seem like I'm going off a little.  
     I've been doing this (arguing for reduction of mandatory minimums, and 
     the end of the war on drugs and marijuana prohibition) for a long 
     time.  If you'd like to get together to discuss this over dinner or 
     something sometime it's on me.  This will be my last post on the 
     subject (well, I'll try :)  )
     
     P.P.S.     Songs of a Dead Dreamer by DJ Spooky kicks royal ass.

In a message dated 96-11-11 20:11:06 EST, you write:

<< Where am I going with this? A lot of promoters want to gouge you at
 every angle, and it's immediately accepted by most ravers. It seems fair
 to you at the time, but when you go to an event where things like water
 and fruit are free, you know that you're getting a lot more than what
 you paid for.
  >>
I thought about giving free bottled water out at Famtasia, But it would just
cost to much. I have a budget (after paying everyone and taking care of odds
and ends) of like 100 bucks but There are some Dj's who are spinning for
free, and If I have ANY money left over I want to pay them... SO I couldn't
give out water bottles. But we are going to have Hugs coolers filled with
FREE clean-drinkable non-tap water. And Smart drinks and someone else will
sell water for a buck... So we are trying to do are part to make going to a
party as cheap and fun as possible....
One thing I don't understand is how people complain about the price of water,
yet they spend 60 bucks for E?? Now that doesn't make sense!

 Well, that's what we have these great email lists for!! To combine our
resources, and work together towards something incredible.

 Elevation is a collective of all SCR people, with SCR dj's. I simply
asked if someone from SCR could supply the water for me, and I got a
response back with a definate yes! I also asked if someone could pick up
our generator, and got a yes. We've got 20odd people working the party,
and it's all SCR.

  I'm not sure how many folks are on SFR, but we have 400+ and it's
pretty easy to get things done with that many people. This is a
community, and we all should help eachother. Isnt that what this is all
about?

     check out http://www.equinoxinternational.com/water.html.  Someone 
     mentioned that we should bring our own water to raves, which seems the 
     reasonable alternative.  it is nice to have it provided, too, but be 
     careful of what you drink.  tap water is recycled, pew! (hold your 
     nose and close your mouth and put a sour expression on your face!)

Yes Adam, the water often is overpriced.  But I think it's time to share 
a different perspective on the subject.

**The price was $1.00 for the same bottle at Gateway.  Consider:  the 
people selling the water take the time and energy to go and buy the water, 
then they carry it all over the place, up stairs, etc. then spend the night 
selling it because too many fucking ravers have yet to figure ou t that they 
need to take care of themselves!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Grow up people.  
Bring your own fucking water, pretend every party is Burning Man.

** What is it going to take, a two by four made out of X?  Not every 
venue has running water, major renegades seldom do.  I for one will not 
drink water SOMA, period.  Also, where does it say that the people who 
put on parties have to 'take care of you?" They are busting their asses 
in ways beyond most raver's comprehension to make these parties happen.  
If you smoke or take E, then be fully responsible and carry in your own 
unopened water.  If they don't allow unopened water in, find another party. 
For the latter is always a sure sign of greed.

**The ravers are ultimately responsible for whether or not a party goes 
off.  e.g. all of the free tasty water in the solar system isn't going 
too make a party positive energy happen if everyone is on speed. 
     
If the promoters sell it at too high a price, pick other parties. 
If the venue is a toxic, fire trap, don't go back and let them know why.
     
**I must consume a minimum of .5 gallon of water at every party I 
experience, just for my health.  I grow weary of having to say no to 
sharing the water I carry..also and lastly, I have no medical insurance 
and I can't afford the risk that sharing water with strangers carries. 
In 1993 I had bronchitus four times.  I was raving about three times per 
week for one year and shared my water often, any connection?
     
Please Adam, teach everyone you know to carry their own water into 
parties and recycle those bottles afterwards.   Lastly there is a 
an even greater ability too let go at a party knowing that 'you' 
have taken care of all of your needs.

Thanks to everyone who came to Sarah and Steve's wacky pre-Mad
birthday dinner bash!!! Everyone who came stuffed their faces (and
left plenty of leftovers for the host and hostess ;) after craming
themselves into our tiny little apartment :) Hopefully, we'll get to
do it again sometime!

Lost at the party was a container of medication. If you happen to have
seen it, or picked it up by accident, please contact me.

On a more RR note, does anyone remember where Vellocet is from?

Steve

I was wondering if anyone was interested in playing a little story game. I
can't remember what it's called but it goes like this.

Whoever wants to play, email me and I'll put you on a list. By 8am
Weds,which well be the cut off time to enter,  I'll send the list to
everyone who replied, that way we keep it off SFRaves. What will happen
next is I will write a sentence no less then 5 words. Then I will send it
to the next person on the list, then they will had a sentence to that. And
so on. Then the person at the bottom (which will be me) will send the final
story to everyone that's playing.

I use to do this along time ago and we came up with some really crazy
stories. I know it a little childish, but it could be fun.

So if your interested let me know. At 8am tomorrow Weds, I'll send the list
of people out to all that wants to play then I'll send off the first one to
whoever is next on the list. By only doing it one at a time, no one will
know the outcome until it's all done. On friday, I'd like to have it all
done and sent to everyone that played.

Hey, I just thought I'd offer these up here to interested folks
first...due to various money problems I have to sell my tablas :^(  I
haven't really been putting them to use so I'd rather someone else take
them who is going to enjoy them.  I'm offering them for $175 for the
pair, and if you want the case, $25extra.  I only used them about 5
times, so they're practically new.
I may have to sell my sitar too :,o( so if you're interested in that let
me know...

thanks,

Hi All,

I need to borrow a computer and modem this saturday for a very special 
project.  It is rave related, and there is no compensation other than the 
gratitude of many many people.  If you can spare your extra computer for 
one night, write to me.

Thanks

deeje

Subject: NRR:Rooms for rent in 3 Bed/2 bath house
Sender: sfraves-owner@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

Looking for housemates for a 3 BR/2 Bath house in San Carlos, which is
about 15-20 minutes south of San Fransisco.
Look at all these great features:
- About 2000 square feet.
- Nice Hillside location
- Wood deck
- Backyard
- Extra family room (music listening/computer room?)
- 2 (possibly 3) car garage
- and lotsa storage!

I am a software engineer at Apple Computer, and a budding DJ. I have used
to do radio shows on KFJC where I would spin an ambeint mix, and did live
events. I also play drums and guitar occaisonally, and would be wanting to
have parties once in a while (not too often; I'm no party animal or
anything). If there is enough interest, I may work on putting wiring in for
a shared Internet connection. Obviously, I would only do this if the costs
were split by everyone.
I would prefer professionals in the computer/technical fields of any
gender, race, age, etc. However, I would like people who also are into
alternative/experimental music: ambient/techno/dub/psychedelia/whatever.
Also, anyone with a a sampler or a pair of Technics SL-1200's gets special
brownie points!!
No flakes or drug abusers!! If you fit in this category, I do not want you.
But the bottom-line is I am looking for anyone who is responsible and easy
to get along with.

Available December 5. Hurry!

Rent will be $675/month + last + security deposit.
Contact Doug at 408-974-5913 or 408-972-9177. Or reply to this email.

is there any justification for allowing an animal to starve in the forest?
or is it a part of a natural evolutionary cycle in which some beings go

	just to play devil's advocate:
	
	human's are not *simply* animals in a forest. is not one of the
things commonly considered setting us apart from animals our capacity to
reason and move beyond mere instinct (not to say that most of us *do*
act rationally--these things only work in theory). sure, starvation is
"natural" in the animal kingdom, but no matter how much you believe we are
animals, there are some very obvious aspects of our existence that set us
apart from other species. 
	
	i do, however, think there *are* arguments to be made for not
helping *all* the poor and the hungry (how do you decide who is poor and
hungry, anyway--i could use a sandwich right now).

	glad i could stoke the fire...

>The Darwin Awards


The annual honor given to the person who did the gene pool the biggest
service by killing themselves in the most extraordinarily stupid way. 

 Last years' winner was the fellow who was killed by a Coke machine which
toppled over on top of him as  he was attempting to tip a free soda out of it.

And this year's nominee is: The Arizona Highway Patrol came upon a pile of
smoldering metal embedded into the side of a cliff rising above the road at
the apex  of a curve. The wreckage resembled the site of an airplane crash,
but it was a car. 

The type of car was unidentifiable at the scene. The lab finally figured out
what is was and what had happened. It seems that a guy had somehow gotten
hold of a JATO unit (Jet Assisted Take Off - actually a solid fuel rocket)
that is used to give heavy military transport planes an extra 'push' for
taking off  from short airfields.  He had driven his Chevy Impala out into
the  desert and found a long, straight stretch of road.

  Then he attached the JATO unit to his car, jumped in, got up some speed
and fired off the JATO! The facts, as best could be determined, are that the
operator of the  1967 Impala hit the JATO ignition at a distance of
approximately 3.0  miles from the crash site. This was established by the
prominent  scorched and melted asphalt at that location. 

The JATO, if  operating properly, would have reached maximum thrust within
five seconds, causing the Chevy to reach speeds well in excess of 350 MPH,
continuing at full power for an additional 20-25 seconds. The  driver, soon
to be pilot, most likely would have experienced G-forces usually reserved
for dog-fighting F-14 jocks under full afterburners, basically causing him
to become insignificant for the remainder of the event. 

However, the automobile remained on the straight highway for about 2.5 miles
(15-20 seconds) before the driver applied and completely melted the brakes,
blowing the tires and leaving thick rubber marks on the road!

He then became airborne for additional 1.4 miles and impacting the cliff
face at a  height of 125 feet, leaving a blackened crater 3 feet deep in the
rock.

 Most of the driver's remains were not recoverable; however, small fragments
of bone, teeth and hair were extracted from the crater, and  fingernail and
bone shards were removed from a piece of debris believed to be a portion of
the steering wheel.

I hadn't seen Baraka before and I am glad that I got the opportunity to 
at 2012.But what was up with the chick de-beaking 
scene? and the factory farm?and then the homeless Brazilian kids, 
and the natural gas burning at oil drilling?
It was suddenly very sobering and I wasn't even on drugs. Would hate to 
see that on acid! Whew! 8(
Last place I expected to see those issues appear on the big screen!
seemed like people kindof tuned it out at that point.

All this talk of Affirmative Action...I know one institution that has done
an extraordinary job of minority recruitment.  As a matter of fact, I think
America will continue to use the model for the forseeable future. I also
know that this industry will NOT be affected by either passage or rejection
of 209 by the courts.  Yep, it's called the PENAL SYSTEM.

The only truly successful Affirmative Action program!

What a great society...now back to raving, drugs, h2o complaints, parties,
who was wearing what, what to wear, and other topics of, er , interest.

After all, the more we dance, the more we make the world a better place....
(Tounge inserted firmly in cheek).

Peace out folx,

Okay, I'll go out on a limb here...  

It always helps to laugh at ourselves.  It puts things in perspective.

Thus, some humor for the cynic and self-flagellant in us all.

That particular piece have seen before, courtesy of Michael Clay.  I 
bitched at him for showing it again because it upsets me so much seeing 
animals used that way.  Bad, Bad Michael! :)  I had to turn my head when 
it came on the screen, as I didn't want to cry, or be sick.  I am glad I 
decided to become vegetarian!

Hi there.

My name is Jonathan McCleery. aka. DJ Flyte. I am a DJ from Vancouver BC
and I am currently looking for DJ work all over the world.  If you are a
promoter and would like a free demo tape, email me at jonathan@axionet.com

I've played a wide variety of music ranging from hard house to trance over
the past five years.  I've spun in all the major clubs in the Vancouver
area including, Graceland, Mars, and the Red Lounge.  I have also done a
lot of gigs on the party circut. The most recent being a party called
Spooky, and the club Graceland, for Halloween.

My new tapes "network and footwork" are also for sale at Bassix in Vancouver.

Thanks for your attention.

I hope to talk to you soon.

Have to pipe up here and say that Jon is one of the *nicest* djs I have 
ever met!  He drove down from Vancouver to spin at a party we threw in 
Eugene, it ended up getting busted in the middle of his set (which was an 
amazing set) and he was very relaxed about the whole thing.  We went and 
had a very nice lunch the next day and he and friends turned out to be 
just absolutely beautiful!

So get Jon down here, you won't regret it!

love drenalin

ps He even played stuff off of DAT that was his own music, very nice 
touch to his set.

hi.

i have recently decided it would be a very fine idea to learn how to skate.
so, i was wondering if anyone could please offer some suggestions on a good
place to start, ie. board, wheels, metal thing that goes in between the board
and wheels, store to find this stuff, or maybe a nice place to find used
skateing things. 

and im sure that once i have wheels it would be great to get some pointers on
how to steer, stop, hop, etc.... 

thank you very much,
:)
jeremy

ps: i have some rocces inline skates that are looking for a new home, 1995
LAX, not used too much. plus all the incrediblely styleing pads to keep you
safe.... 

thanx again, jeremy :)

gateway raves have been my talismanic experiences in the scene, and I knew
that this past saturday night would be another.  i noticed immediately it
was exactly eleven months after my first rave, the chrysalis at the acme
last december, and it was definitely time to reflect, and not just on rave
living -- last wednesday I received word from the boss that the recent
downsizing infection was spreading to my position (although I get paid
until the end of the year, get the full support of the office in my job
search over the next two months, and don't have to work during this time
period [really]).

i hadn't raved hard since charity, and it was time to again, although my
new love susan was unfortunately away.  i was a little worried that 2o12,
CCC & other events would keep some familiar faces away, and although that
was a little bit true, i was repeatedly amazed at who showed up, including
unexpected newbie friends.  finally carin (the woman on crutches who
introduced me to the scene last year) hobbled in at 2:30, and i could feel
the thread reaching back to my first rave, with many people who i met for
the first time 11 months ago still grooving.

this weekend reminded me again how much energy goes into this, as I was
there early to help Todd set up his amazing butterfly prints and stayed
after a bit for the clean up.  the flyer i saw didn't bill the event as
"chrysalis" (the sfr calendar did), but there was no denying the two walls
of psychedelic butterflies (if you liked Todd's 2o12 work, you shoulda seen
the ambient room).  the ambient room was breathtaking.  it was great seeing
maureen's welcoming alien again. there was a crystal suspended in the air
in the center of the room by gossamer cloths hanging from all four corners
of the room, and this thin red laser focused from the floor up to the
crystal.  there was also a beautiful effect at the chill room altar, with a
big buddha statue clutching a crystal, onto which a trippy pink light was
shining from over the buddha's shoulder in such a way that it appeared that
the crystal was glowing from within ... you had to look hard to see where
the light was coming from.  crystal-bliss at chrysalis ...  and i'm a
sucker for all the dance floor lights as well ...

oh, and the music in both rooms ... deaks going off, alex filling in for
ethan and keeping it going, minor minor & john carel turning the dancers
into sweaty mush, and I can't describe greg's closing set at all.  reza,
dave, clare, rob, joe rice & brad all filled out the beautiful ambient
space gracefully.

the momentum of the party carried me through about 2 1/2 hours of the
cleanup, and even getting stuck in that massive Bay Bridge traffic jam
didn't bum me out (i turned around at treasure island and drove the long
away through marin back to north berkeley).

regarding the latest "overdoing it":  the gateway folks have had some bad
luck recently, with the woman who passed out from her ketamine/misdosage of
GHB combination this weekend, omar's accident at burning man, and a couple
of other incidents earlier this year.  they've always reacted to these
situations professionally, with their concern for the health of the
partygoers more important than the ramifications for gateway.   i've heard
that the woman was fine, and the people who run the space are cool.
nonetheless, I hope that people who do indulge do so a bit more
intelligently.  people shouldn't want to get fucked up so much as to rely
on someone else's opinion about what (and how much) drugs they put in their
bodies.

there was a good vibe in the air saturday night, and i hope everyone else
shared some

I saw a girl tonight at the Durant food court wearing...

-a****s sneakers.
-a****s beanie.
-a****s warm-up jacket.
-a****s shorts.
-a****s backpack.
-a****s bike messenger bag.

...all at once.

I wouldn't be surprised if she had a****s underwear as well...

OUTTA HAND CORPORATE SPONSORSHIP! --I certainly hope she didn't pay for all
that shit, because that kind of brand loyalty is RIDICULOUS! I swear,
a****s should be paying HER if she's willing to be a walking billboard for
'em. Maybe a****s should get into the rave market??? I see that triple
stripe shit on everyone at almost every big party I go to... gotta love the
non-corporate sponsored sf underground!!! =) Oh, I''' agree that those
black & white a****s warmup pants everyone has are SUPER COMFY (adam?
sherry? can you second me on this? =) but some people just take it too too
far.

Dear SFRavefriends,

	This thread ties in nicely with Dave Bayer's recent post about
not letting your use of illicit drugs become a problem for others at
parties.
	It really boils down to a question of who is responsible for whom
in society.  Do we have an obligation to help each other out when we're in
trouble?  I don't have a clear answer to this one.
	I will say this however:  Humans are different from other
animals in that we (most of us, anyway) are upset by suffering, and would
like to do something to end it.  However we also (most of us, anyway)
understand that sometimes just giving a person what they are pleading for,
whether it's money, food, a smoke, a new video game system (if you have
kids) isn't necessarily going to either (a) make them happier, or (b)
solve the underlying problem -- in fact it may make it worse.
	Furthermore, as humans, we tend to have a well-developed sense of
self.  Except for sexual submissives and U.S. Marines (a little humor, ha 
ha, don't flame me), we usually resent being told what to do.  When people
try to force us to do something, we resist, or if given no choice, we
perform in less than an ideal manner.
	My conclusion from all this is that to be effective, help must
fulfill these two conditions:

	(1) It must not simply make it easy for the person(s) being helped 
	    to continue the behavior pattern that led to their needing
	    help in the first place, and
	(2) It must not be forced (either directly or by law), but must be
	    given voluntarily.
	
Hope this helps,	;)

	Maybe it's because you can't turn on your faucet at home and get
virtually unlimited amounts of E at almost zero cost? (Gads, what a
thought!)
	If people were charging many times the market rate for E at
parties, I'm sure you'd hear complaints about that too.

Neither here nor there, but as a note, I've found it interesting that the
last couple times I showed my design portfolio to suits, the one thing that
always sparks conversation is the rave flyers. They don't know a damn thing
about raving, but they always see those "crazy flyers" that rarely seem to
follow any criteria of "good design" around and they just can't figure out
how we can afford to go to such extent for "just a party."
Oh yeah, incidentally, finding one of these crazy colorful little flyers is
literally what first got me into this house we call rave.
:)

P.S. For anyone interested in the history of party flyers, check out a book
called Design After Dark by Cynthia Rose, and if you know of anything, let me
know. Lastly if anyone ever thinks of tossing their collection, or even has
just a stack, I may be glad to purchase or trade records, etc. for them.

Last I checked, the hungry animal could freely forage for food, freely
cross any land in order to get food, and not risk arrest for
trespassing or theft. Only a sick/injured animal, or a whole population
facing overgrazing/drought/ecological disaster would find itself
"starving in the forest"....

Even when you take animal territoriality into account, most animals
driven out of a territory can find somewhere to go. Unfortunately for
humans, this is not the case. Fact is "we" treat wild animals better
than a large percentage of the underclass -- where are our "wild human 
sanctuaries" ; how come you never hear of a "save the humans" campaign?

Unfortunately, given that every square inch of land is owned by
somebody, fenced by somebody, and we have police/legal structures that
strongly enforce these private property rights, one ends up with
starving people on the street. They have nowhere else to go, and no
means by which to sustain themselves. If these people had a place to
rest their heads, soil to grow their food or graze their animals, I
very much doubt they'd be starving in the street.

So the better question to ask is where does privatized land, private
property, and a system that prevents people from being able to sustain
themselves unless they're willing to rent out their bodies as
slave-labor in order to obtain food/lodging -- where the hell does that
fit into your "natural evolutionary cycle"??

I would love to see what happens to people spouting such economic
darwinism crap if they actually existed in nature, wild, and without
the police/state there to enforce their hoarding of property and means
of sustenance. If this were a "natural" system, I could just get myself
a big gun/knife/club, barge onto your property, and claim it for
myself. And unless you could better defend yourself, you'd either find
yourself dead or you'd have to retreat.

In fact, I'd venture to say that we've badly disrupted the natural
evolutionary cycle through our ability to unfairly enforce the hoarding
of private property. I find it rare that those that actually have the
state protecting their property holdings are actually more fit than 
those that are enslaved to work on that property in exchange for their
rights to exist and thrive on said "private" property.

What's the point?  I don't see how not buying anything affects anything.  If 
this was a day like "Buy Stuff Packed In Ecologically Friendly Materials 
Day" or "Buy Only From Companies That Haven't Committed Heinous Crimes 
Against Humanity Day" or something like that, I could see participating, but 
simply buying nothing?  
Yeah, right...

And what, pray tell, is "consumerism"?  The act of consuming?  And can you 
honestly say that people will cease to consume for one day?

Uh huh... right....

I don't know.  I'm not casting stones, really, but I just don't get it.  
What's the point?

Greetings fellow Elevators!

 We're almost there, and I notice tons of you adding "see ya at
Elevation" to the end of your posts. (Wow... I didn't think you guys
really cared ;?)) That's really cool. We had such a great time last
August, and the vibe was perfect.

 Anyway... We're going to be posting the directions to the site on
Friday as opposed to Thursday. There's been an influx of rumours going
around that everyone is going to be there so, I really would suggest all
SCR, SDR and SFR people to get there early, and start the vibe flowing
right! Also, if you are setting up a tent, make sure that you get there
around 9:00, and that way you won't have 400 people stepping all over
you while you're trying to do your thing.

 *The road up to the actual site is completely paved, so we wont have to
do the 4by thing that we did last August. (that was a wreck huh?) Also,
the designated parking areas will be very close to the actual rave camp,
so getting back to your car for whatever reason won't be an ordeal.

*There will be porta potties, so please use them.* 

 Also, since the onslaught of forest fires has once again risen, all
mountain areas are NOT permitted to have wood or coal bruning fires. I
know, that would've been really fuc*in cool, but we've got to follow all
rules put forth to ensure that we can have our fun out there again.
However, if you have a gas burning stove and you want to cook some food,
that is permittable.

 There will be tons of trash cans around the area with the words "Trash
Can" painted on the side in huge letters, this way making sure that we
are not "forced" to throw any garbage on the ground. Please obey all
concientous thoughts about the environment while Elevating, it really
does matter. Pack it in, Pack it out....

 Also, be prepared to experience chills. It may be a little cold out
there. Last weekend, it was in the mid 50's at night, so make sure to
dress in layers, and bring warm stuff with you. We will have some
blankets and other goods on hand, but bring warm stuff anyway. 

 Also, NO FLYERS PLEASE. This is an outdoor event, and flyers have a
tendancy to blow away in the wind, leaving unmistakable traces that a
rave was there. This makes us look really bad, and will be a definate
way of telling the rangers and the land owners that we are not
responsible and don't care about the environment. I know that I'm
preaching to the wrong crowd, and that SCRs are educated and
responsible,  but as long as we tell people that we know not to flyer
the area, everything will be ok.... if you are caught with flyers, you
shall be stripped naked, painted pink and hung upside down in front of
the dj's for all to see. ;)

 That's about it for now. So, I'll post the directions on Friday, and
you can call 714-224-9779 on saturday, and elvation@party.net on
saturday as well.

 I can't wait to see all of you there- This is going to be a great
weekend!!!! Up in the mountains with all of our SCR friends and family!
(oh yeah, and you SFRs and SDRs too!)

-Over

I called the bass number (408)998-2277, then several options down in voicemail
They said
"Live 105 presents Green Christmas Party : Beck, ButtHole Surfers, December
15th and the Cow Palace."  Uhm... that doesn't sound like orbital and
chembros to me.... besides, even if they did totally sell out and play at
such a lame event, think of the complete lack of vibe.  The people that will
go to this:
99% people who heard about beck and butthole surfers
1% diehards that read about orbital and chembros on this list.

goodluck....

Hi everyone. I am trying to find a ride to Famtasia on Friday as I'm 
supposed to be running some Intelibeam lights for Greg there. If anyone has 
some extra room in their car it would be appreciated if you could fit me in.

Peace. James :)

The point is that (in case you having noticed from the last election),
voting is completely ineffective because our system no longer even has
the slightest resemblance to a democracy. It's straight-up plutorcracy
and your vote *ALWAYS* comes in second place after corporate dollars
dictate the way things will be (c.f. propositions 211, 214, 216, 217).
This is especially so given multinational/mega-corporate control of the
mass-media that is used to shape public consensus, telling people how
to think, which values are applicable to make themselves happy, and
even defining happiness and success for us.

So given that, the average man/woman has one response to this
sick&decaying consumerist "moneyocracy" that many of us are forced to
participate in whether or not we want to -- vote with your dollars.
Especially w/ the christmas season coming up, and with the "boycott"
day being the biggest shopping day of the year, you really have a
chance to spread your message -- spread it and make it HURT!

BOYCOTT CHRISTMAS!  Go ahead and party, do something creative and fun
with your family (get toghether and cook a killer meal, decorate the
house, spend QUALITY time with your children, etc). Instead, "they"
have us worrying about giving loads of uneccessary consumer items to
our friends and families, while we sheepishly thank people for buying
us crappy gifts that we don't want, need, or even have place to put. 
Meanwhile, the media has us brainwashed into thinking we'd be horrible
antisocial creeps if we don't want to join-in a season of frenzied
waste, where we significantly fill our landfills with unrecyclable
goods, buy our children carcinogenic plasticene baubles that they grow
bored with almost instantly (Like gifts can replace the care,
friendship, love and attention that children  really need!)

And most importantly, we all go significantly into debt during the
Christmas season -- the system loves our debt as the banks can profit,
and our employers can more easily put the screws to the worker who now
needs that pointless job even more than ever. 

At least in the Jewish tradition, before Judaism got polluted with
keeping up with the joneses (Christians), Chanukah was not a holiday
filled with waste. Gifts consisted of candies and "chanukah gelt"
(money) which children could use as they need, to buy items they
wanted, even life necessities. But now Christianity-culture has made
this aspect of Jewish culture seem like this is a bad thing (usually
mouthing the usual racist crap like "oh that stingy jew" behind our
backs...) Personally, i'd rather give a family member in need money
during the holiday season and let them get something they really need.

So go ahead and party down during christmas, but ask yourself whether
the materialism they want you to participate in is really the key
to your happiness.

  OFFICE MEMO         new to the list!                      Date:  =
11/13/96

hey people,
i'm new to the list.  got on about 3 weeks ago.  mostly to just find out =
what was happening now in the rave scene and where the cool parties were. =
 but in addition to that i lurked onto some very interesting discussions =
re: raves, vibes, politics, race, etc.  the politics/race thing got =
pretty intense but some very intellegent stuff came out from many  people =
and i learned a lot from it.  i've always felt that ravers would be the =
ones to enlighten, sensatize and mellow out this uptight world we live =
in.....and show it how to dance!
actually, i haven't raved in while but was there when the scene first =
dropped in on SF about late '89-'90.  i went to just about every toon =
town, full moon, wicked, mr floppy's and everything in between for the =
next 3 or so years.  some of the greatest times of my life took place =
meeting people, dancing my ass off and sweating like crazy in the most =
content blissful daze at rave parties (a few hits of "e" always helped =
too).  the energy level at raves was something i have never experienced =
before or since but around '93 i just dropped out.  the vibe and energy =
had changed at these parties and it seemed that alot of people i knew =
where letting drugs take a really negative hold on them.  so i dropped =
out, cleaned up and moved out of the city.  i didn't want to move to far =
away though (i live in oakland).  i like being close to SF.
i tried partying at the other club scenes only to be disapointed; hip =
hop, alternative shows, gay clubs, etc.   and for the most part they were =
all just pick-up spots where the last thing anyone wanted to do was make =
a friend.  and the last thing i wanted to do was waste a good drug trip =
on a dull party.
so i was totally releived to find out through sfraves that the scene was =
still alive and kicking and that SF is still the place to be.  my only =
problem right now is transportation.  i live near lake merritt in oakland =
and don't have a car.  (violins please) it's been months since i've been =
to a good party and just let loose and danced.  hopefully there's some =
cool, friendly east bay ravers out there with car space who wouldn't mind =
sharing some of it with a dude who has no problem with gas money and =
usually has a joint on him.  if so, i'd love to hear from any of you.  my =
number is: 510-834-5305.
bye

The best thing about the commercialization of Chanukah is the fact that it's not
even one of the most important of the Jewish holidays, but "they're" attempting
to make it thus.  On the other hand, I guess it's less disgraceful to make a
mockery out of a festival of remembrance than the birth of one's Lord and
Saviour...

I remember when I was a kid, a lot of my Christian friends would bitch and envy
(and usually toss in an epithet or two) over the mistaken notion I and the other
Jewish kids got a horde of gifts every night for eight nights, eight times as
many as they themselves got.  Some actually wished that they had been born
Jewish (even though they generally didn't like our culture in most other
respects).  And a lot of the Jewish kids that celebrated Chanukah with only
the gathering of family, the lighting of candles, and the giving of small gifts,
woke up to the fact that _they_ were getting shafted.  I can only wonder what
parents must put up with this time of year.

And I  can only guess at the orgasmic waves of euphoria that passed through the
corporate world when they realized that they had an untapped segment of the
population that happened to have a gift-giving holiday that occurred near
Christmas.  It's too bad that this was the route to inclusion for us. 

I myself love to give gifts to my family and loved ones.  And yes, Chanukah (for
me) is a convenient time to do this (all the family is together).  And there
is nothing wrong in theory and in (limited) practice with holiday marketing.
But it is sickening to watch the inundation, no, the assault of marketing-
driven bullshit at this time of year (worse than Easter...)  To see all
the "BUY BUY BUY" propaganda thinly veiled as holiday spirit on TV, radio, in
schools, stores, etc. (reminds me of the movie They Live :)...  To look at the
toy departments of stores, trashed, with shit all over the floor, by shoppers
who couldn't give a shit about anybody but themselves, bitching at each other,
bitching at the store clerks, who often bitch back (while the exec's are on
vacation)...  F**k when I worked retail, I worked 60 hours the week leading
up to Christmas, at two jobs, and I have NEVER seen so many unhappy, bitter,
selfish, angry people.  (Of course to be fair I met a few of the most angelic
people at that time too..) Holiday Spirit?!?!?!?!?

Shit, oops, sorry about the rant, I think I just needed to vent a bit.

Back to topic.  I don't think a boycott day would work.  But I think everyone
should boycott the bullshit, for their own sanity and integrity,  and not buy
into the madness.

Sorry,
-mike

  The Humanities Department at San Francisco State University will be
hiring a new person whose speciality is music. One of the three finalists
is Hillegonda Rietveld, a British writer who has written extensively on
the rave scene(s). She will be presenting a talk at SFSU entitled:
 
  SPECTACULAR DISAPPEARANCES: CONSUMPTION OF HOUSE MUSIC ON THE DANCE
                FLOOR, SUBJECTIVITY AND THE GAZE

  The presentation will go from 4:30-5:30, Monday, November 25, in
HUMANITIES 213 (southwest side of campus). 
  To read one of her pieces on house music, check out:

        http://www.gold.ac.uk/difference/rietveld.html

  I'll be there. Hope that some of you/us can make it too. Bring her a
flyer, an SFR button, or anything you like (if you want to) to make her
feel welcome.

Okay, on my way to the Simpsons last night, I passed by the channel that
had the intro to Hard Copy or some such bullshit show like that and saw
they were going to do a piece about GHB.

It was the most ridiculous thing I have ever seen.  Sadly, it focused on a
young woman in Texas who went to a country line-dance club and apparently
somone slipped GHB in her drink, or so they think (the show ended by saying
that after interviewing at least 100 people that were at the club, they
still have no leads).  She went home, after complaining of a headache, and
never woke up.  Her uncle said that he was convinced "someone slipped GHB
into her drink" and that "people should be very afraid."  "You should never
leave your drink unattended.   You can't trust anyone."

They showed where she used to play volleyball in her backyard, her grave
site, her bedroom.

That's it!

Now, what's missing here?  Um, like, they never once mentioned what GHB is.
Never ever even so much as gave ANY indication of what they were talking
about.  It was ridiculous.  As close as they got was to show a vial with a
piece of tape on it, and GHB handwritten on it.  Then they showed a cap
full of a liquid being poured into a Coke or something.

Be afraid, people, be very afraid....

While renewing my membership to KALX recently (remember to support community 
radio!!), I inquired as to why I hadn't heard DJ Seth's excellent 
Thursday Night techno show ("Aurora Borealis") lately.

In true community form, it turns out KALX shows get rotated off the schedule 
after a year to make room for others who want to broadcast.

But, I was told, there is now no other show featuring techno on KALX!!  
As we all know, our music is truly underground and we cannot find the 
real stuff on commercial mainstream radio.

I think this is a sad loss... and kind of strange that an often cutting-edge 
public radio station does not play this music.  I love KALX but if they 
aren't playing techno, who will??

continually turning the dial in Berkeley,
Nancy

Dear Arthur,

Is this her "job-talk?"  

The title of this sounds very academicky.  I think this is
supposed to be where she shows her academic credentials to the whole
dept., which then will debate (formally and informally) whether or not to
offer her a job.  

Is this talk open to the public?  

I would be chicken to go  there as a "raver" just because it might somehow
influence their decision on whether to give her the job.

My own personal experience is that hiring decisions in academia are hotly
debated, and I just can't imagine that (even humanities)
professors would think much of a raving lifestyle - except a topic for
academic study.  Maybe.

I mean,...the title of this talk is really formal.  It kind of
makes me think she is under pressure to convince her
(academic) audience that her topic isn't frivolous.  Or that she herself
is going to be a serious colleague- and that she won't be out partying all
the time, having lots of fun, taking E now and then, and basically making
everyone else jealous because she's having so much fun being a professor
of raving, instead of Chaucer, or whatever.

But of course, my apologies if these worries are obnoxious to you in any
way.

  Since I'm the one who often shows Baraka I thought I might chime in here...
You are right to notice that the film has not only some wonderful spiritual
images but also shows some of the "other side of the coin".... but then it
is my belief that balance is in order... so much of our life is out of
balance... males not balanced by females... blacks not in balance with white...
rich out of balance with poor.... and so on....

Here is where people begin to disagree...

  Some people think raving is only about "happy, happy joy joy" images and
everything shown at a rave should reflect this... these people often
critize the showing of any negative images what so ever. Everything should
be fantasy or Sesame Street and reflect a child like innocense. While I don't
completely object to this view, upon reflection I think if I were to completely
support such a position it would be too much like M. Anntonette saying "let 
them eat cake.". That is, if ravers only party and totally ignore the more serious
aspects of the world - we become merely consumers of the "good life" without at
least reflecting upon the more serious aspects of the world. This is of course,
my opinion, and yours may differ. Some people have told me raving is an escape
from all that serious stuff and besides they see enough of that every day so I
should show only totally positive stuff... others actually like a bit of "grit
in their eyes" for balance....

  So on the whole I balance my images fairly carefully but do throw in some stuff
that is frightening ( Tim Curry as the Legend Devil for example ), some funny stuff,
some technology, some fantasy, some nature and so on... most feel I do achieve a
good balance and I strive to do so. Also I try to be mindful of strong drug states
and leave the Texas Chainsaw Massacre at home ;-) but then I do like to play with
images a bit... and don't shy away from images that are moving or thought provoking
even though they are not perhaps totally positive....

  Hopefully I succeed in some small way of pleasing most of the people most of the
time which really is the best that can be hoped for....

 Visually yours,

  Mike

 PS The chicks are having the part of their beaks that they fight with cauterized 
or branded so they won't peck and hurt each other. The beaks are NOT being removed.
But then those are images of how chickens are raised so we can have our chicken
dinners.... we sure have moved a long way from societies who worshiped and respected
the things they eat - we no longer even care to see the process.

 Several times I looked up at the screne and was amazed at certain things 
 that were on the Visual Screens. I ran back to Mike CLay and asked him 
 what was going on, and maybe could he change them because I didn't like 
 the mood or the emotion of them, and like you said, I was concerned for 
 someone whoo might be watching it through hallucinogenic eyes. He seemed 
 kind of disapointed in me the times that I requested this, but did it 
 anyway. It wasnt until yesterday that I started to figure out why. My 
 friend Ryan came up to me and after a monster hug that lasted about an 
 hour, he WENT OFF about how much he learned from watching the screens. 
 I guess, according to him, that the two screens were playing back and 
 forth on each other, and causing ironies to arouse involving their 
 content. Mike Clay was delivering a messadge to those of us watching the 
 screens that night. It was powerful.
 
> Last place I expected to see those issues appear on the big screen!

 Me two, but maybe that ideally shouldnt be the case. I mean, it got me to 
 thinking. The rave scene is at times escapist, and at times refuses to 
 take responsibility for life by pretending that there is no bad in life 
 and all we need to do is smile really big, and dance, and then problems 
 in life will go away and we wont have to deal with them. Yet, at a 
 gathering where consciousness and community are the main focus, maybe its 
 not such a bad idea to confront so musch of the attrocities of the world, 
 ESPECIALLY our part - America, which does so much  of the harm to other 
 countries. The argument that it was probably a bit much for those on 
 acid, etc, is very true, and that's why I told mike to turn it off, but 
 thinking back, what was going on on those screens might have been 
 unpleasant to watch, but I bet its a hell of a lot more painful to 
 experience first hand. Its a tough issue, and I agree completely with 
 your points. Im just torn, bucause I think the issues are important.  :)

Well, there's no reason to think the rave as a culture phenomenon any
less worthy of serious research than anything else.  A lot of the
popcrit stuff in adademia is really atrocious, but some of it has real
insights.  In the UK, especially, where raving and clubbing are much
more pervasive parts of the society, and have resulted in very serious
political consequences like the CJA, I'd think there is quite a bit that
would be amenable to serious academic inquiry.

There are even testable hypotheses, like Arthur's own about the progression
of audiences for musical styles from dance-oriented to stationary listening
(pardon the simplification).  

My friend Rebecca Adams, a sociologist in North Carolina, did several years
of quite serious field study in the Grateful Dead scene, including some
innovative work involving participant observation study-groups with her
students.  Yes, it was fun, but it was also serious work as the resulting
papers (and even a PBS show) indicated.  

And San Francisco, of all places in the States, would be the best place
for this kind of research to occur.  I for one am interested in the relatively
rapid pace of change in the "underground dance music" scene, and what it now
represents for participants at various levels.  

Of course, all of this can be tossed aside in the typical pomo shite that
passes for much academic research on popular culture.  But as someone whose
degree in anthropology resounds with the idea that "if there's cultural
smoke there's cultural fire," you bet I'd argue a case for some serious
academic research in "rave studies."  And it better come with an equally
serious component of participant observation, or it will end up with the
same stale and incorrect results that often occur when studies are done
only from secondary sources.

So, if Professor Rietveld gets the job, we should make sure she gets to
experience the F&F/Gateway/Sunset/etc. part of the scene as well as Cool
World :)

I took a look at Rietveld's piece noted by arthurc, it's quite good once
you get beyond the usual genuflection at the Altar of Semiotics (with the
obligatory Barthes, Foucault and Baudrillard references).  The piece
basically focuses on both the way a DJ uses records to create a set which
has meaning as a "text" (the universal Good Thing in the world of semiotics)
and the importance of active participation (and a loud enough sound system,
heh :) as the audience "interprets" that text.  Although she pays the usual
homage to the Barthian idea that the listener or reader of a text creates
its only real meaning, the paper shows the practicality of the view that
both the DJ and the listener "create" that meaning -- and indirectly,
of course, the composer of each recording used.  One of the areas I would
find interesting is how a non-producer DJ (someone such as myself) as
opposed to those using their own productions (Frankie Knuckles or
Frankie Bones, for example) deals with the contraints on their assembly
of the "text" and how that works in conjunction with the audience.

Oops there I go again, now you know why I left academia before theory
rotted my brain.  And I can just hear Frankie Bones yelling, "It ain't
about no mothafuckin TEXT!  Get up and DANCE!!!"  Such are the ironies
of Real Life vs. the world in Academe :)

Anyway, it seems that Hillegonda Rietveld has written a book called
"This Is Our House," published last year, but I could find no further
information on the Web about it.  Has anyone seen it?  I'd also be
interested in reactions to her talk . . .

Working on tenure track for Professor of DJ,

Hello Sfravers!,

        It gives me great pleasure to present the following...

                      On FRIDAY, the 13TH of December,
             come and celebrate the spirit of superstition as...

                        Harmony Productions Presents

                           <<< FREAKY PEOPLE >>>

      Dj's:   Trent - Minor Minor - Brandon - Brian Flip - Greg =)

                   (408)486-9591           (415)263-4885

        The party will be in San Francisco, at a new space (for Harmony,
that is). There are a limited amount of tickets availible for this one
-about 400... You will be able to get tickets at a map point on the night of
the party. There will be free water as well as $1 bottles. You can bring
your own water, but it has to be sealed (with it's original seal not
broken). (We are trying to avoid any and all GHB related problems. Please
respect our requests, as they will benefit you in the long run.) If your
bottle's original seal has been broken then we cannot permit it inside the
building. Thanks in advance. =)

        For this party we are asking that you come dressed in your funkiest,
craziest, scariest and freakiest costumes. Getting dressed up doesn't mean
just scary costumes, it can be anything! Just be original! But we do
encourage it... as if you come to the map point (and the party) dressed up,
you will get a discounted ticket into the party. (Originality of the
costumes are subject to promoter's judgement ;)   Anyways, the admission is
$15, or $10 with a costume. So get dressed up and have some fun! 

        There is a long running curse put on the Harmony family... Our first
Harmony party was on "Friday the 13th." With all of the bad luck in the
world, we got busted four times! Now, we are trying to break this curse with
a totally beautiful party. So it should be something!! Hope to see you there!!!

        Also, we hope to see everyone out this weekend at Omar's "A Wrinkle
in Time" party. He is totally happy the we are putting this together for
him, and wishes he could come. But he knows that he can't, so he sends all
of you his love, and thanks you for the support!

Peace, love and harmony to all!!!

Greg =)

The exodus is near, Berkalee has served well, but I must move on. So, if
anyone knows of a high spirited, low cost, blissfunk'tional family style home
that's short a member, or soon to be, or soon to form, pass it on. Here's the
specs:

Anywhere within a 15min drive of Potrero Hill

Shared homeish environment with positive, communicative, loving people, OR
3 or four looking to establish such a place

Low $,(don't laugh)like, under 450, I said dont laugh!

Artists, DJ's, Musicians, Designers, Students, Dreamers, etc. a +, I like to
think I'm a little of each.

I have some cool stuff, furn, Ttables, etc to share and I need a little space
to do art.

I'm a full time student, and a part time art director, I'm always busy, but
am always trying not to be.

Hi all!  =)


 As many of you may know, Dionysus Dreams is helping out with A Wrinkle 
In Time this Saturday (9/16/96) in San Francisco. What most of you don't 
know is that I jusy recieved news that my equipment van can not make it 
(HUGE unhappy face here!), so I'm forced to try to seek help again.
 
 Details;

1)	I need one large van or pickup or two smaller pickups/vans

2)	I need to leave Santa Cruz by no later than 1pm on 9/16/96, which 
	means meeting me in Santa Cruz NO LATER than noon on 9/16/96.
 
3)	I need to get back to Santa Cruz the next day.

4)	We can cover gas costs if neccessary. With this being a benefit 
	for Omar we are trying to save $ where ever we can.

5)	I can be reached here or at 408.427.1666


 If anyone can help that would be incredible and I'll wash your feet 
(really!). Hope to see some of you out there for Omar and Yourselves! =) 
It should be a really good time



peace y'alls,

Ran @ Dionysus Dreams

In the explanation of a joke, something is usually lost...usally the humor...

but, then again, there may be some more serious points worth considering...

...it's like: go on a diet... ya know, don't pig out for a day...you are
acting by not acting, eh???

If

>simply buying nothing?
>Yeah, right...

hmm...you gotta open your mind a little...this is not about politically
correct consumerism... I mean, are <<eco-friendly>> mass merchandizers
good? or is the notion of  "eco-friendly" massive amounts of mass
merchandized stuff kind of ironic/oxymoronic/just plain moronic...


>
>And what, pray tell, is "consumerism"?  The act of consuming?
>
>Uh huh... right....

My non_expert definition might be:

consumerism is a characteristic of advanced capitalistic society which is
created by social status <symbols> being givin to "stuff", whose possession
is deemed advantageous to attracting the attention/respect? of his/her
peers which can then be leveraged to gain social status/sexual
favors/friendship?/conversation ...etc. c0nsumerism society is marked by
the social reality of attention, and the deprication of character
development and appreciation of "non-conformist" individuals <<ie, those
without stuff>> who never receive the attention/love/friendship? of the
most socially significant individuals, and hence suffer from stunted
personal growth/social acceptance, which as it eventually becomes
intolerable, leads to the inevitable devotion of resources to the
aquisition of stuff...

individuals and peer groups certainly evolve sucessfully nevertheless-- but
even these exceptions <in a consumerism based world>> are marked by uneven
quality and certainly shunned by the consumerist majority,as they are
ignored for reasons concerning lack of common cultural values...if not
ignored due to outright philosophical disdain/ subliminal labidinal ennui
<ie lack of that lusciously shallow lascivious gloss, that emanates from
shiny new things>

that's consumerism in IMHO

 And can you
>honestly say that people will cease to consume for one day?

Now this is a good point, as the definition of consume is certifiably broad
enough that it is inevitably a characteristic of some very necessary daily
activity... but certainly this was a word which existed before the "ism"
was added, and I for one would not object to any "consuming" of resources
that takes place beyond the bounds of the "ism" outlined above!!

>
>I don't know.  I'm not casting stones, really, but I just don't get it.
>What's the point?

Consumerist pshycological profiles...hmm...probably not all that
contemplative, probaly impulse driven by superficial social relations,
trendy short attention span types, herd menatalities...

Kinda antithetical to my style,
But you all tell me, is this +++ or  very raver-like...??

point is: depth of character requires strenght of character, and the
habitualized psychological patterns of consumerism types , IMHO, is not a
strong type...the first step is to break the habit+mindless repetitivenss
... to make these actions once again choices, and to put into perspective
the role of these choices in the development o f our individual character
and the character of our societies and sub-cultures as a whole...and
hopefully to develop characters strong enough to develop depth...

so taking a day off from the culture of consumerism is probably a  +++ mind
opening day well spent, the first step toward a new realty created by you
and your peers, not by Madison avenue ...

You know, there are many people in the country today who, through no
fault of their own, are sane.  Some of them were born sane.  Some of
them became sane later in their lives.  It is up to people like you
and me who are out of our tiny little minds to try and help these
people overcome their sanity.

I recently went to a house party on Sunday here in SLO.  My friend Mike 
and Abraham were both spinning and they invited me so I thought i'd check 
it out.  My roommate and I showed up at 10 figuing there would be a bunch 
of drunk college students but great music.  

This was mostly true.  Everyone was some what unfriendly-very cliquey.  
My roommate wanted to go but the music abe was spinnin was cool so I 
wanted to stay.  No one was dancing and some people wanted to put on some 
CD's and turn the tables off.  I mingled and got bored so mike and i and 
this girl I met just started dancing and groovin around.  The keg went 
dry soon after and I figured everyone would leave as usual.  

So wrong I was.  Mike got up and started spinning some fast break and 
house and everyone started to get into it .  No one left and there was no 
beer left and suddenly there were 20 people in the living room gettin' down!
Wow.  Abe and I started cheering and people responded.  I talked to many 
who had never even danced to house before and they were loving it.  A 
nother keg rolled in but it didn't matter people were having a great 
time - asking were they could here more of this crazy phat dance music.

I stayed till 3.30 am dancing and having a great time.  One of the 
funnest nights I've had here.
And now I have a caravan of 8 people coming with me to LA this weekend.  
Some newbies and some new found raver friends.  Anyone know Porcha or 
Jordan or Claire?  neways I had a great time.

This weekend I'm plannig on going to Ron D Core and Thee-o's birthday 
party on Friday and then Oz and/or Evolution 2 on Saturday.  Hope all are 
having a supa week

          I love this music!

PLUR,

       Austin

Unfortunately, my show did expire a couple months ago, but there are
definitely other dj's to check out who play a certain amount of
techno/ambient/jungle.  Try Alice on Fridays from 3-5:30pm or Nommi on
Sunday nights from 9-midnight.  There is also a budding jungle dj
named Stareyes wandering the late night hours.  And if all goes well,
there will be a permanent techno/ambient specialty show every Sunday night
from midnight to 1am, where we will feature guest dj's weekly.  So it may
be a bit hard to find, but techno still exists at KALX.  Keep your ears
peeled, hopefully I'll have new show soon as well.

take it easy,
Seth

hmm., i called and got some person who said they don't have any adidas.  maybe 
i'll go there anyway, he may have thought i was talking about something else.  

fyi, adidas dont have skate shoes, they have basketball shoes, and i think only 
the freshest skaters use them...

FYI,
     
FTC on Shrader & Haight in SF has addidas.....mostly skate styles though....

Yeah, I have regular "buy nothing days." They generally start a couple
days after payday and extend to the next payday. ;-)

This is pretty much the only massive these days that I shall not ever

and they have **ALL** totally gone off.  Hope you make the journey to 
California for this one!

Hey everyone. . . I'd just like to thank Sho, Joe, and all those
other guys for that bad-ass party tonight (last night). I had even more fun
at this one than the last one. I met more people, talked to more people, and
danced more than before. As usual (I guess) everyone there was cool. There
were no crazy people this time, there were just people dancing, sitting, and
listening.

        I got there a bit too early (about 20-30 mins before the equipment).
I wish I could've helped out with the stuff but everyone was soooo stressed
and in a major rush cuz they were running late. I kinda felt useless just
sitting there as everyone ran back and forth setting things up.

        Once the music started, they started letting people in. Immediately
people started boogying down to those funky beats ala SHO. I have to say
though that I really didn't like the piano music too much, I liked Joe's set
the best. But that's just the type of guy I am.

        It kinda depressed me to see one really sad girl. I tried to cheer
her up, but it was like she was half dead or something. She was sober, but
she was trying to explain to me that it was just a bad time for her. Worse
yet, her friends never showed up.

        There was a pretty cool guy. I forgot his name, but I forget most
everyone's name. He was dancing with his flowers and his jackets, he was
care-free. That was cool. He was a really spiritual man, in fact, he told me
about how he is a spiritual healer. 

        I've never seen sooo many people with their tongue pierced. . . 

        It got a little crowded for about 30 mins, then it cleared pretty
good and there was room for whatever you wanted to do.

        Kinda last minute stuff, like the black lights. I know you guys are
in a hurry, but NEVER leave home without your Duct Tape. 1,000,000,000M uses.

        I really liked the party. I can't say it enough. But I was expecting
to see Leslie, and she wasn't there. But I see Joe, and Sarah, and J Wiley,
and a chick named Olivia, and another named Shugah, Mike, and a guy named
Ojo, and some others who's names have temperarily been bassed out of my
mind. Hey to all of you people I met and spoke to. 

        Can't wait till next time. My sister agreed to go with me.

Thanks!

HUGZ2ALL

Yes!  I will most likely go to the Gathering this year myself, (not
intending to shit on massives, so dont start anything) out of all the
massives this is the one I would consider going to.  Had a blast last year
(what I remember of it anway ;), and met some of my best raver friends
there!  Met Amy there too actually, and lots of other gruvy peeple too!  I
will most likely be in attendance to this one.  Amy, we should all hook up
again like we did at last year's Gathering! :)

Yeah!  It works great on my 486/133!  It sounds better than my
BassStation in many ways, but maybe not as flexible.  I have a Turtle
Beach soundcard, the problem may be your card.

Y'know, I knew there was somethn fishy (sniff sniff) about them country
folk. . .all those weird cults, and those ritual so called "Line Dances".
Yeah, you know the truth. . . They're all maniacs.

But, you would have to use a lot og GHB to kill someone, wouldn't you?
Bodybuilders used to use it, but it was pretty useless. Now idiots use it as
a drug. . . I guess you'd have to be pretty stupid to not notice that your
glass was only half full a minute ago, not it's 3/4 full and it looks a
little foggy.

a camelbak water storage thingamajigee (or something similar), and strap it
on. You can usually fit a lot of water in one, and they're pretty
concealable as a small pack under your shirt or jacket. I've been searched,

it's probably work. Just don't abuse the idea. They have tubes which can

High Crunchman!

I have a DJ Dan tape and the inside cover says to call (718) 965-9862 for
booking information. Where's this party going to happen? I'm always down to
hear Dan spin. Anyways, I hope this helps. BTW, I saw your web page and
it's pretty cool. I haven't had time to explore it fully, but I will
someday.

Bonghitter!

This isn't directed at you at all Aryck:

Isn't this ridiculous guys? The whole concept of having to sneak *WATER*
into something you are paying to attend? *WATER*, not copious amounts of
drugs, not a 40 of Maddog, but plain 'ol life sustaining water. 

It really is baffling to imagine why people put up with it.

Just before my grandmother died, I got the feeling that, if I didn't go see 
her soon, I might not get the chance.  I made the right move by making 
immediate arrangements to visit her.  A few months after my visit, she died. 
 You can't stop death, but you can enjoy life as much as possible while it 
lasts.  I'd suggest making frequent phone calls, asking him questions about 
his life, his childhood, what life was like when he was young, his views, 
his memories of his parents and grandparents, etc.  Write it all down.  Get 
a tape of him if you can.  I managed to secretly record my grandmother 
singing some old songs to me, and I cherish that tape more than you can imagine.

Much happiness and fond memories,

S

     Disclaimer:
     Read the message below the Reply Separator... mine makes no sense 
     without it.  It might not even make sense with it.  Is sharing weird 
     thoughts always like this?
     
     =)
     
     I supposed it's fair... It's my fault.  About ten years ago, I was in 
     detention staring at the graffiti on my desk and thought to myself: 
     THERE COULDN'T BE ANYTHING MORE PATHETIC THAN ETCHING THE VAN HALEN 
     LOGO INTO A PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOL DESK.
     
     I now admit to having been proven wrong by the fates and time.  
     Addidas never came out with "Eruption"... Nike doesn't even have a 
     drummer...
     
     What the fuck.
     
     Ironic that if those kids that graffiti that stuff lived in Indonesia 
     or Tibet or Malaysia, they might not have time to scratch logos on 
     desks because:
     
     Many schools lack resources like teachers, desks, etc...
     
     They'd still be at the Nike shoe factory because they didn't finish 
     their quota for the day.
     
     They are too illiterate to accurately remember the wording and logo 
     because the United States actually does benefit from keeping other 
     countries in the poorhouse by keeping them in civil wars (funded with 
     our hard earned drug dollars even), undereducated and working in 
     manual labor fields.
     
     Sorry.
     AndyW
     
     Does anybody else ever realized how spoiled we are... I'm not saying 
     stop complaining, because it can get better, but stop and marvel every 
     once in a while at how much we have.  I think I'm still in afterglow 
     from Chrysalis... did anybody else notice how good the vibe got in the 
     morning?

some incredibly cool person at my school was cool enough to write "Addidas"

I've heard rumors that "A Wrinkle in Time" is going to have
Stella Luna performing, so I'm seriously thinking about
making it there.

How about "Freaky People" on December 13th.  Any chance of
Stella Luna there?

> Dj's:   Trent - Minor Minor - Brandon - Brian Flip - Greg =)

And I can't say I'm up on the DJs these days.  What can
these folks be expect to spin?

Hardcore is a definite minus for me.  Jungle (or
tribal... anyone remember tribal?) would be a definite
plus.  

Though actually, what would be a big plus is
"stuff-I've-never-heard-of-before-and-would-have-a-
hard-time-classifying".

By the way, as for "Buy Nothing Day" and all that.  A friend
of mine has just started working at Global Exchange, a
non-profit organization that among other things sells
various "ethnic" hand crafts from around the world with the
idea of funneling more of the money to the ethnic-folks and
less of it into the profit margin.  They would be seriously
bummed if they didn't do some decent business this holiday
season.  

(They've got a few locations, one is in SF on 24th Street in
Noe Valley, another is in Berkeley, I think on College near
Claremont.  It's a good place to get some decent drums, if
you feel like joining in with Stella Luna...)

Ok here's the deal. I am driving from the east bay (dublin) to be exact to
Famtasia, now I don't know how many of you are out in the east bay or not, but
what I am thinking that I can save the air a little by picking some people up. 
If any one is interested in car pooling, or they just need a ride to the party,
either E-Mail me at eric1488@pacbell.net or call me at home 510-803-9472.  Rave

I was gone most of the week, so there might be stuff missing.  Lotsa stuff
got sent in though, so there's plenty to choose from.  Recombinant continues
for the next couple days, Basics is on Saturday, and the SFR BBQ.

I checked out Goldie's Metalheadz and James Lavelle's That's How It Is
in London at the beginning of the week.  Way good stuff - busy crowd,
lotsa beats!

	No one said anything about government control here. No one is 
proposing to "protect" anyone from "crass commericalism", or at least I 
have not gotten that feeling from any of the posts I have read. 
Commericalism has by and large convinced a hell of a lot of people that 
they need shit for some reason that they really do not need. Ok, maybe it 
was not commericalism, but somehow, people started to believe that the 
amount of pointless shite that you never use is one way of proving just 
how good a person you are. Some of us don't think that way, and not 
necessarily because we are excluded from the game, but because the game 
holds nothing for us except being shitty to other people for no reason 
that holds any importance to me, while making someone else able to smirk 
while they think "those suckers out there sure are silly...".
	Maybe those who are out there proposing BOYCOTT day are really 
super secret CIA type operatives, planting subversive thoughts so the 
real hearty Americans can look down on us who had so little brain power 
as to be lead astray from what life is really all about - things like 
progress and buying things. With everything telling everyone who watches 
TV or drives down the freeway or wanders about in public places that they 
need a new set of Sony super-improved ultra bass fluxation with a 
response of 10hz VR-7594669 headphones, I do not think one or two people 
asking people to think about why they would be giving those to their 
"loved" ones or friends is bad.

Hoo boy, gotta add a word to this one...

>BOYCOTT CHRISTMAS!  (snipped out multiple paragraphs on wasteful and
>meaningless giftgiving)....


I happen to love giving gifts, including at Christmas ... whether it costs
a nickel at a yard sale or $500 at a jeweler, if it's been chosen with
love, care, thought and individuality, a gift is a tangible way we show
people that we care about them.

I remember gifts that I've given, and gifts that I've received, and I
cherish many of those gifts years later, because they remind me of the
person who cared enough about me to give it.

Boycott crappy needless mindless stuff, sure, but planning out giftgiving
is one of the greatest pleasures I know!

Ooops, now I'm ashamed, I missed Sarah's birthday party (happy birthday
Sarah!) and MAD too .. but I started the temp job from hell this week on
Tuesday ... however, now that I know that it's totally mindless, I'll try
to make it out next Monday, ok Aryck?  Then I can meet your sister!

See everyone tomorrow at Famtasia, I hope!

I agree...
It definitely made a large impact on me; to watch it in a party setting.
It really caught me off guard. I'm not suggesting that Baraka shouldn't
have been shown at all, I just felt wrong dancing when I was watching
it, and it felt weird watching other people dance when I was watching it.

I know I will be there for sure, don't ask me what I will be wearing
because I don't know yet :-)  I am sure I will end up saying hello to
everyone there just like I did at 2012 :-)  If I come up to you and say hi,
and ask how your doing, and you can totally tell I am out on E, just go
with the positive vibe I bring out, you'll see what I mean, tomorrow :-) 
Hope to make some friends there,
Rave on,
Eric

Hello! Sorry to be so technical but..... It doesn't take that much Gib to f 
you up.  If the shit is concentrated (which most cases I've experienced it was) it only takes a cap 
full.  

2 or more and you can be sure you'll be asleep in a little while - till the 
next day.  Plus coupled with the depresent effects of alcohal this makes 
for a strong compo...one I wouldn't want to f with.  

GHB is an amino acid broken down easily by your body.  Look it up it's 
not hard to find info on and if you need some I can provide a few sources.

I can't believe people put shit in peoples' drinks for fun.  I've had 
some bad shit happen to me and an unexpected trip can be really scarry.

On the Hard Copy  tip:  I never believe any of this trash put on tv.  
This stuff is so exagerated for the sol purpose of selling ratings.  It's 
even more sad to think that most of main stream america believes the shit 
too.

     23 : Two score plus 3
     
     
     The Roman numeral 23 has much signifigance in the modern world.
     
     23 is the exact number of apostles that Jesus had (incluing Jesus 
     himself and adding 10 to allow for historical innaccuracies)
     
     If you reverse the numbers that make up the number 23 you get the 
     number 32. There are no known 32-day months in the roman calender. 
     This surely has wide reaching karmic implications which we are only 
     now beginning to comprehend.
     
     Jesus Christ was allegedly 23 when he died (allowing + or - 10 for 
     historical variation (please see 1. above))
     
     Today is the 14 of Novemeber. If we add 14 and 11 we get 25. If we 
     subtract 2 from 25 (2 being the average number of arms,legs, eyes and 
     ears attached to the average human) we get 23. Spooky, huh ?
     
     It is considered good luck in certain parts of Lithuania to wear size 
     23 plaid pants on the night of a new moon. 
     
     If we omit ABC from the popular song "Now I know my ABC" we discover 
     that there are in fact 23 letters in the alphbet and not 26 as may of 
     us have been brainwashed into beleiving by a system which places no 
     value on freedom of thought. 
     
     At the moment there is a  "real" version of a popular cartoon called 
     101 dalmations. But it is a little known fact that Walt Disney had 
     originally planned to call the cartoon "23 Dalmations" as he had a 5 
     year old grandson who would reach that very age in 18 years time. 
     
     23 is the age which I would have reached on my most recent birthday 
     had I been born a year later.
     
     Well thats all for now, I hope all 23 of you enjoy reading the above.
     I have to run to catch the 23 bus to 23 23rd avenue in time for the 
     23:23 (11:23) meeting of the 23 club.
     
     wibble, wibble

Ah, I am Max Vision, 23, neuromanic to the core.  23 is obviously my 
favorite number.  I know a perhaps too much about it.  From Illuminatus to 
cyberpunk fiction to my everyday life, I KNOW.  So greetings from all three 
points of the triangle... and have a nice day!
For those who are not enlightened by the many many many occurances of the 
number 23 and it's significance, email me or something, I may post more info.

OK, so here's the deal with famtasia tickets:

tickets are $12 at Primal Records in Berkeley (at telegraph and parker)
until 3pm tommorrow (friday). After that, primal won't have 'em anymore...
they'll also be available all day tommorrow (for $12) at Housewares, which
is in SF on Haight between Masonic and Central.

The night of the party, they'll be $15 at the map point, so get 'em early
to avoid incurring the $3 you-waited-too-long tax.

This party will be DAMN GOOD. the lineup is:
        Tony
        SFR's own dj Tom
        John Howard
        Jonathan (who's put insane amounts of work
                 into making it a great night)
        and Rob Doten

the chill room dj's are:
        Sin
        Boomerang Fidget
        Judge
        and Kraig.

call (510)559-2529 for details... map point info to be posted tommorrow
afternoon.

enjoy!

i'll vouch for the camelbak. they're awsome. i've got one, i don't wear it
all the time, but when i do it's the handiest little thing of all time.
plus, having that tube hanging into my mouth all night entertains all the

regarding sneaking it in: i took mine to a kundalini once and got in with
it, even though they were taking everyone's water bottles away. i wrapped
up the bladder and stuffed it inside the pack part; when the security guard
looked in, she said "wierd, i've never seen one like that before" - she
thought it was some crazy bong and let me in with it. =)

Neither do I. But, isn't it a chicken before the egg when we're talking
materialism v. commercialism? One feeds off of the other in a never ending
cyclical relationship.

Dear Adam,

	From the few times I've seen you and what you wear, I don't think
many people would put you in that category.  Your clothing is too weird,
and you're too friendly.  When do you ever see a "gangsta" wearin' a Dr.
Seuss-style hat??

Much love,

OK, it is not suppose to rain where the BBQ will be, only partly cloudy. So
here is what I would like everyone to do. If we all think and believe
positive thoughts and believe it will NOT rain tomorrow, it will NOT rain.
I'm a strong believer of, if you think and believe in something strong
enough it will actually happen. So if we all think positive then it will go
off great.

An example of this is when I did a BBQ for my company it was raining during
the week and was supposed to rain the day of the BBQ. Well, they didn't
want to cancel it and It could go inside with the BBQ undercover. I just
started to believe that it wasn't going to rain, as well as everyone else
hoping for no rain and low and behold it didn't rain. It was actually a
nice day.

The BBQ will be in the same place as the last 2 other ones. Believe it or
not the weather forecast is different in that area then SF and further
north like Napa Valley. Chances are, there is a slight chance of rain in
Northern CA near Napa, but at Pt. Molate (San Rafael) it is only going to
be partly cloudy.

So lets all think NO RAIN and get ready to have a great time. I will have
tarps ready in case we have some negative vibes brewing in our mist. I will
update the Voicemail after 11pm (NEWS). If the News say Yes rain then I
will postpone the BBQ, if they say Only party cloudy or SLIGHT chance of
rain, then it is still a go for the BBQ because I'd like to think Slight
means NO.

So call the Voice mail about 11:30pm tonight or before you head to the BBQ
on Saturday.

NO RAIN,

Wow the response was more than I expected! :)
I've got to tell you guys, that since I opened a new pack of underwear and
the sticker said, "Inspected by #23", my life has never been the same.  (I
swear on my existence that this really occured!!)  Basically I'm going to
echo out some of the explanations I've heard so everyone can see what other
people said, but I also want to note some things I've seen.  
Twenty Three years of life, and here is what I've learned.  There are a lot
of things that are coincidence, and there are a lot that are blatent and
intentional.  Like in FringeWare Review #2, on the cover
(http://www.fringeware.com/cgi-bin/cat), note Bruce Sterling's portrait on a
23 dollar bill.  Or in Max Headroom, Network 23.  Or countless references in
hundreds of scifi and cyberpunk works, both print and movies.  By far the
strongest single meaning that I can convey to people who wonder, is that
it's a subcultural ICON.  It's a recurring reference in cyberpunk genre,
both fiction and nonfiction.  You'll see it referenced in phrack, people's
handles (ahem, ghost23 speaking)... it's like anime is to raves.  Or more
accurately, what 420 is to the subculture.  420 raves, 23 cybertek.  Ah but
there is a reason that number evolved to be the one.  (Unlike 2600 which is
a frequency)

Here are some emails I received on the matter, most reference I knew about
but I'll just list them all here for everyone:

>i've always wondered about people different interpretations of 23, the way
>i interpret is seperate 2 to 3(to be free) then add 2+3=5, number of man,
>and take 2^3 + 3^2 =17, or one 7, a number of worldwide mystical
>significance. Too me it was of the pattern numbers like 7, that is worked
>over by many people into an image of something?
Yes, it's a thought meme.  A sort of subcultural virus that some find
enjoyable :)

>The number 23 - extremely significant.  My Grandfather, a gypsy, had a
>curse put on him that his two sons would die at fifty five (23 + 32) and
>be buried on their wives birthdays.  Sure enough, they both died at 55
>and were buried on their wives birthdays.  Sucked. 
Ack.. sorry to hear it, see there is a reason people have respect for this
number, some reason that even gypsies (probably without computers) are keen on..
(I'm assuming it was a gypsy who did the cursing also?)

>Since I was made aware of it's 'significance' it has appeared, often
>prophetically, in many different circumstances and situations.
>But then this could just be heightened awareness/perception of the number.
>i.e. If it was the number 42, would you see that everywhere,

>2+3=5 (Law of Fives)
>2/3=0.666 (numer of the beast recurring)
Yep, the Illuminatus may be a significant contributer, and at least a
provocateur.  The law of fives was my first non-cyberpunk intro to 23.

>it IS the NINTH prime number, you know.
>http://www.teleport.com/~ingebret/23.html
Thanks for the link, many of these are coincidence type occurances, but
those are fun too!

So in a nutshell, despite it's origins, 23 is a subcultural icon reoccuring
in raving, hacking, cyberpunk, and other cultures.  Hey, even Michael Jordan
knows what's up :)

hehe

Have a cool day!

Hey everyone, we are a bunch of positive people here right?  Well what it it
that we really want for the BBQ & Beats?  

We want it to be a nice sunny day so the party can go off?
or
We want it to be a beautiful day condusive to a party outside in dry weather.
or a multitude of other things that we do want rather than the posts I've
seen so far saying what we *don't* want.

Let's be positive about it, ya know?

Hail BBQ&BEATS.....in dry weather with sunny skys, good music and good food.

Hear me, mark me, learn me, throw the mind's ear open. Shut up the

On the silly side...

Does anyone remember the "urban childhood myth" that ADIDAS actually was
an acronym for "All Day I Dream About Sex"??

Oh, the life of a 7th grader!! :)

Have a great weekend, ya' all.  I'll probably see you at the BBQ and
definitely at Wrinkle in Time.  

I've found this aerobics instructor that is into the club scene and puts
on some pretty good grooves *sometimes*, of course, he also played  
"Hootchie Mama", but a little house made up for it!!

Actually, I totally agree with you!  There used to be "Blue Laws" that
prevented stores from being open on Sunday.  The idea was that there
was to be at least ONE day a week that was to used for introspection,
religious activity (albeit Christian), family time, etc without the
constant
drumbeat of worldly concerns....

I'm not advocating a return to Blue Laws but there HAS  been something
lost in our headlong rush away from all things spiritual.....

	No one said anything about government control here. No one is
proposing to "protect" anyone from "crass commericalism", or at least I
have not gotten that feeling from any of the posts I have read.
Commericalism has by and large convinced a hell of a lot of people that
they need shit for some reason that they really do not need. Ok, maybe
it
was not commericalism, but somehow, people started to believe that the
amount of pointless shite that you never use is one way of proving just
how good a person you are. Some of us don't think that way, and not
necessarily because we are excluded from the game, but because the game
holds nothing for us except being shitty to other people for no reason
that holds any importance to me, while making someone else able to smirk
while they think "those suckers out there sure are silly...".
	Maybe those who are out there proposing BOYCOTT day are really
super secret CIA type operatives, planting subversive thoughts so the
real hearty Americans can look down on us who had so little brain power
as to be lead astray from what life is really all about - things like
progress and buying things. With everything telling everyone who watches
TV or drives down the freeway or wanders about in public places that
they
need a new set of Sony super-improved ultra bass fluxation with a
response of 10hz VR-7594669 headphones, I do not think one or two people
asking people to think about why they would be giving those to their
"loved" ones or friends is bad.

What about...." T-R-A-X.......Trax the give you action the give you
traction at a low K-mart price.   -or-

K-Mart is your welfare store, where your food stamp buy you more.


And as a little kid you didn't want to be caught dead in K-mart.  After you

We'll I'll be hitting Famtasia tonight,  BBQ&BEATS III tomorrow during the
day, and "A Wrinkle in Time" tomorrow night.  If you see me sleeping then either

A) I'm trying to conserve my energy so I can make it through the whole weekend

OR 

B) I've failed in my attempt to conserve energy and must sleep.

No matter what come up and say HI.  

I'll probably head straight from Famtasia to Pt. Molate.  No reason to drive
all the way back down to San Jose.  Break out the old sleeping bag and catch
some sleep in the park before everyone else gets there for the BBQ.

Look for the white hat.

Hello,

My name is Chandra and I'm in town from the UK for the next month on 
business.  My friend is kind enough to lend me the use of her e-mail 
account, so here goes...

I tried to sort through all the info. on local raves, but I got confused 
and was side-tracked by constant phone-calls.  My question is : Since I 
can't possibly find the time to attend even close to the amount of raves I 
would like to go to :( I was wondering if anyone could get me info. on 
say, the 2 or 3 biggest (and best) raves happening here between now and 
end of December?

Thank you so much if you can help me (you can reply to the above address; 
I will get it)

love to all,
Chandra

[ to sfraves list ]

 Unfortunetly, I won't be able to make it out to anything this weekend.
I did want to mention a Pt. Molate/Friends and Family story that may
have a bearing on tomorrow's BBQ & Beats picninc party:

 Many months ago , FnF decided to do an outdoor party at Pt. Molate. 
Come the day of the party, the weather reports were very bad, but, with
all optimism, Ethan decided to go ahead with it.

 And, yes , it did rain some on us, but not as much as areas north
and south of us. Looking to the west, you could see the clouds parting 
at Mt. Tamilpias , heading either north or southward, leaving only
a little percipitation for the Richmond/Pt. Molate area. As if the weather
was giving us a special dispensation!

 So, hey, it could happen again! Especially if the wind is coming from the 
ocean (west).

 Good luck and good partying, y'all!

You know for most of the day it was nice, then started to rain a tad and
stop. The party was really great too. But I feel it will be nice all day
during the BBQ. Clear skies right about us. It may rain elsewhere, however
it will be clear about us.

a little more number theory...:-)

:2 is prime, 3 is prime, 
:2 and 3 are the third and fourth numbers in the fibbonacci sequence(see
stars below)
:2 succesive numbers in the fibonacci sequence also give the WORST running
time for the extended Euclidean algorithm
:2+3=5 which is both the prime that follows 3 and the fibonacci number
that follows 3
: 3 - 2 = 1 and 2 - 3 = -1 showing distinct dualistic properties
:the number 23 is a member of the natural numbers, the rational numbers as
well as the reals 
:lim (e-->infinity) (23 + 1/e ) = 23 relation with infinite forces

Yeah, I went to the Recombinant show last night.  The Pickles were really
interesting, I thought, really good.  Only two or three people dancing
off & on (one of them me!), way in the back, big empty space in the room's
center, all the rest of the people crowded tightly around the turntables,
looking on.  I couldn't blame 'em at all - I would have liked to get
close enough to see exactly what they were doing with their equipment!

The Pickles came on in the "small" room, my guess is around
11:00 or 11:20 ??   Played till about 12:00 or 12:15...then someone
else came on, started up some visuals on 4 big screens....I was
into it at first, but then the visuals turned horrifying (staccato
loopings & warpings of a woman's head, mouthing along with a high-pitched
vocally sound, all of it super-fast, sound-level increasing....then
the woman's head seeming to morph into a white-eyeballed, fanged
grimace....sped-up, jerking like a evil retching puppet head, repeated
across all 4 screens).

I ended up leaving - sound levels had increased to the point of actual
ear-pain, even though I was wearing thick foam earplugs....I'd
put my hands over my ears, turned away from the screens, thinking
I'd "wait it out," then I decided that was stupid & I could just
plain leave.

The visual images were startling & repulsive to me in a way that's really
hard to explain...if you go & you see it, or, if anyone else reading this
was there last night, write me back & tell me what you thought, as I'm still
not quite sure what my opinion of it is. They seem to have been shooting for
a "noise/terror" effect, and they achieved it, but to good, bad,
or indifferent ends, I can't say...

It did not seem like a night for dancing.  When I arrived around
10:30, the crowd was sparse - only a couple people were dancing in the
main room, to Cheb i Sabbah, and some other folks with tons & tons &
TONS of computers & keyboards & software.  Then everyone headed for the
small room to check out the Pickles. But then, I left at 12:30, so the
dancefloor may have improved once people got out of the habit of facing
the stage, looking for something to see.

If anyone goes tonight (it's still at King Street, same folks +/- one or
two special guests), I urge you to please, please BRING EARPLUGS !!!!
I have started to get in the habit of wearing ear plugs at raves for the
last 2 years now, and I can say that this was the loudest sound I have
encountered in those 2 years at least.

I'm kicking myself for fleeing in pain without even trying to communicate
this to someone "in charge" last night....maybe no one was on the dance
floor 'cause it was too tough to handle the volume from the speakers at
such levels??

Bonus-that-tipped-the-evening-from-neutral-to-downright-positive:
I was handed a flyer announcing a new(?) gig for DJ Charlotte!
It's going to be Wednesday nights, at the Up&Down club (I think -
can't check this, since the flyer's at home, in my jacket pocket).
If I remember right, it's called "feminine PHAT"  !!

See you there, and good luck at Recombinant!!

      BERKELEY, CALIF. - The Associated
                               Press via Individual Inc. : One week after state
                               voters approved the use of marijuana for
                               medical reasons, a group has set up an Internet
                               site with an order form for potential
                               customers. 
                                      - Web browsers can choose from ``B
                               grade imported'' to ``AA grade California
                               green'' at the new site of the Berkeley
                               Prescription Cannabis Growers and Buyers
                               Club. 
                                      - ``The victory of (Proposition 215) has
                               allowed us to come out of the closet,'' said Ted
                               Tuk, temporary director of the 10-year-old
                               group. 
                                      - ``We've always been an informal group
                               of disabled people helping each other obtain
                               marijuana, but now we can be more out front
                               about it,'' Tuk said. 
                                    - Proposition 215 legalized the cultivation,
                               possession and use of marijuana for health
                               reasons. However, it is still illegal to sell or
                               distribute marijuana, and growing it is a
                               federal crime. 
                                      - Tuk's group does not seem to care, but
                               police do. 
                                      - ``Along with supplying and selling
                               marijuana, which are felonies, I imagine you
                               could cook up something extra for using the
                               Internet,'' said Berkeley police Sgt. Michael
                               Stafstrom. 
                                     - The attorney general's office declined to
                               comment on the group's offer, saying the law
                               has left things ``murky.'' 
                                      - Tuk, who is prepared to go to jail, said
                               eventually the Web site will only be available
                               to club members, who must have a doctor's
                               permission to use marijuana. 
                                      - ``I don't want people trying to order
                               marijuana without the proper authorization,''
                               he said. ``I'm really trying to do this in keeping
                               with the proper spirit of Prop 215.''

Wow!  Thanks for the warning...I'm doing a guest sitar thing there tonight
with the ISO Orchestra, and I will pass along your message about
painful sound levels to the folx there!  That's just not cool.

Here's the rundown on tonight:
   
   Friday, November 15th - Asphodel Records presents Recombinant
   DJ Spooky that Subliminal Kid, Sub Dub, We, Byzar, Granular Synthesis
   (Austria), the Invisible Scratch Pickles, The X-Men, Naut Humon
   conducts the ISO Orchestra, guests.
   8:30pm-, 21+, $15. 174 King St., SF. 415.522.7380
   
I just talked to the Recombinant people about set times, and they said the
Pickles will prob. go on around 11:30.  They said that things will really be
kicking from 10:30-1:30...Granular Synthesis comes on last, they really are
supposed to KICK ASS!!
It should be a fun night!!

     Shameless Plug for a Product I Love (well.. not LOVE...)
     
     I wore my Camelback (I have a groovin little deluxe model with extra 
     pouches.. perfect for hiking, MTBiking, etc) all night at Freedom, and 
     people just dug it.  It keeps water really cold all night long if you 
     fill it with ice cubes, and you can dance like a freak without having 
     to put it down, because it's comfy.  I don't think of it in a 
     smuggling way, but a convenience way... plus it makes no trash and 
     sorta promotes that "SoCal Desert Raver Survivalist Just Lived Through 
     Nuclear Winter But I'm Still Happy and Dancing" look.  Look for me 
     wearing it outdoors next summer!
     
     Is anybody else getting really hyper about this weekend?  See you all 
     at uh.. um... Wrinkle in Time.  And BBQ & Beets (not my favorite veg, 
     but I do have some borsht occasionally) where it is NOT GOING TO RAIN.
     
     I know it's not going to rain, and I'm very confident of this fact.  
     So confident that I will NOT bring the top to my trusty raving 
     companion, the 87 Suzuki Samurai convertible.  Everybody say happy 
     100,000 miles... it just kicked over last night (didn't actually see 
     it though :( ).  My car is now officially Kelly Blue Book worthless... 
     or damn close at least.
     
     I think I need to get my blood sugar checked.
     
     Peace Beautiful People!

     It's 4am, do you know what rave your kids are at?

Sorry to spam the list about this... :) But it's the only way I can
reach most of the people I know.

In an effort to make contacting me as confusing as possible for my
friends, I have changed pagers. If you have my old pager number, or if
you feel that you need my current pager number, please contact me.

Also, my privacy can be invaded at any time, day or night, thanks to
the magic of email/alphanumeric paging. This address is also
obtainable upon request.

Thanks!

Steve

     Hi all,
     
     
     I finally finished reading this book (on Bart) last night and I have 
     to say Terence gets very excited in the final chapter when he 
     basically comes to the conclusion that DMT & other hallucinogens 
     represent the escape door out of the psychic and environmental mess 
     that we humans have embroiled ourselves in at the end of the of the 
     20th century. 
     
     Of particular interest to me and I suppose to readers of the list was 
     his observations on the whole DMT experience. He talks of beings akin 
     to "tykes at play" that one becomes aware of when in this state which 
     he likens to entering a parallel universe. He also makes reference to 
     an entity called "the wholly other" and...wait for it...Aliens !
     
     I'm aware that the alien thread may have come up before on the list 
     before but I find the associations very interesting and wonder does 
     anyone out there have any first or second hand experiences similar to 
     Mr McKenna's ?
     
     Or which McKenna books would you recommend I read next ?
     
     Nanu nanu,
     
     COH

I thought this might be a bit interesting...


To be in the "scene"  one has to be down with the right sayings  it
seems whatever we wish to call ourselves become out dated in 5-7 yrs and
we reinvent...

40's   Cats

50's   Beatnecks, bohemians

60's   flowerchildren, hippies

70's   Dudes, chicks

80's    Ravers, Friends

90's     Scenesters, partygoers

I stumbled upon this when I was conversing w/ a newbe and she commented,
"whoa,  you've been a scenster for a while!"
Me:  "Scenster?  Is that what they call ravers nowadays???"
Her:  "Raver?  yep you're old school all right..."


Hmm.   I guess new terms pop up everywhere, eastcost goers calls Jungle
-Drum and Bass-

I hear that jungle dancers be referred to as junglists.
Trance goers are called Trancers (or tranceheads)

Has anyone else noticed this???

keeping a finger on the pulse,

Before letting yourself get too excited about entering parallel universes
or meeting aliens through the use of psychadelics I highly recomend
reading some john lilly, check out this link...at first it may seem that
he is coming to the same conclusions, but you really gottsa get to the end
before he really draws his hypothesis together..

http://www.rain.org/~lili/DrJohnLilly/metaprog.html
if you read this let me know what you think...

Recombinant was pretty good.  I went on Wed. and WOW are the invisible 
scratch picklz PHAT or what.  Now those boys can dj........it was my first time 
seeing them and they blew my mind.  Everyone else was good too, but the 
picklz def. stand apart.
 I went home after the show and practically ruined one of my cartridges 
scratching. =P
Also it is pretty crowded and not much of a vibe, but if u wanna see good dj's 
then GO.

Hi everybody!!!  Are you ready to party tonight???  I am SO looking 
forward to this - it has been ages since my last party (the 215 
Benefit!!! - not counting the busted FnF) and baby, I am ready to 
DANCE!

I am extra super happy about tonight because I will be with a very good 
friend and newbie raver, Paul.  After hearing me rave about raves for the 
last year-and-a-half (since we met), Paul finally discovered parties on 
his own, and has gone to about SIX massives since the summer! (a new 
recruit, heh heh heh).  Tonight is his first REAL party (sorry 
massive-heads!)

Please come up and say hi and help make this an awesome one for Paul and 
his girlfriend Lara (and for me!) :)

Not sure what I will be wearing... either a 70's long gown and a feather 
boa (:P!) or just your boring regular athletic pants (no I'm not a 
"gangsta", I just like to be comfortable!), tank... glitter... smile...
... I plan to be providing a lot of fruit...  I have dark hair... I'm 
cute (or so I'm told!)... is that enough of a description??!

See you there!!

PS Only :( so far is that Ethan won't be spinning...

  YESSSSS!!!  I remember that.  Not a bad motto, huh?  In response to the
post about house music.  I, too, was introduced to techno through house
music.  The only thing that bothers me is when I travel around with mixtapes
in my walkman, and share the music with others, I am posed with the question,
"How can you dance to THAT?!?!?!"  The appropriate response is always a smile
and a, "How can you NOT dance to that?!?!?!"  Have a great weekend. =)

         Hugs,

On the silly side...

Does anyone remember the "urban childhood myth" that ADIDAS actually was
an acronym for "All Day I Dream About Sex"??

Oh, the life of a 7th grader!! :)

Have a great weekend, ya' all.  I'll probably see you at the BBQ and
definitely at Wrinkle in Time.  

I've found this aerobics instructor that is into the club scene and puts
on some pretty good grooves *sometimes*, of course, he also played  
"Hootchie Mama", but a little house made up for it!!

Let's be historically accruate here:  I was at this fabled event also, and
it took me over an hour the following day to clean the mud off my boots.  My
own conclusion...with the right participants, it can be well worthwhile
despite the conditions.  "Hoping" to make it tomorrow.  XO RHoda

     Where I grew up in Ireland there was a myth widely circulated that 
     profits from Proctor & Gamble products went to a satanist group. The 
     compamy logo (check it out on the side of products) depicts a 
     half-moon and seven star motif. Maybe they have since removed it, but 
     it did look kind of Occultish......
     
     On the silly side...
     
     Does anyone remember the "urban childhood myth" that ADIDAS actually 
     was an acronym for "All Day I Dream About Sex"??

the problem of private ownership of property is directly related to the
excessive population of the human species.  there are too many humans on
this planet and that is why we can no longer freely forage for food and
neither can the other animals with which we share this planet (being
confined to a park hardly counts as free) (and animals that violate the
park bounds are often killed, like the mountain lion in marin last month).
by the way, over-grazing is caused when the animal population becomes too
large for it's territory which is the case with humans and is why some
people should die of starvation. the reason you never hear of a "save the
humans" campaign is because we are doing fine, unfortuneately we are
killing pretty much everything else living on this planet in the process.
when i think of what we've done to this planet i'm ashamed to be human.

just another primate, jennifer

ps.  i don't own any land, but if you show up at my door with a big bazooka
and threaten to blow my head off if i don't give you all my stuff, well you
can have it!  i don't really give a shit about stuff or property.  life is
what matters.

pps. has it occured to you that agriculture enslaves plants?

every species is different, that is the point in dividing them up.  the
argument that humans are especially different and therefore better and more
worthy of this earth than other animals is a product of the christian
religion, and i believe it to be false.  it is this very reason which sets
us "apart" that has given us this erroneous belief.  there is no apart.  we
are all in this together.  if there were no other living beings but humans,
we would die, we depend on other species for our life, it's a system and we
are just a link in it.  a damn weak link too.

Hi all , greetings to the West Coast crew ,
wow...within hours of checking out the SF rave list I'm drowning in stuff...ever
thought of
compiling it into one or two daily mailouts , ( like UK dance ) , or is that too
slow for u guys ?
Good stuff anyway , good stuff ...
 Briefly to introduce myself , as well as recording as Cosmic Soup Sound System
,
Solid State Headstate and Conspiracy , I run a label called Filterless Records
and copromote
a roving event by the name of Club Alien . ( We've hosted partys from Moscow to
Amsterdam and
also done an alien compilation ) . Theres also
a drum'n bass label in the offing ...and people ( perhaps unfortunately ) call
me Freud .
 In a nutshell : I'm looking for distributors / promoters / sound systems to do
some fun stuff over
your way and help get the sounds around . Actually , while I think of it , we're
about to release
the album that has come about via the UKDance mailing list ..little aside there
! I know one or
two people in California but in all honesty not a whole bunch .
 I'm also always interested in hearing material as we are putting together comps
as well as
keeping the vinyl flag flying :)
   I'm considering coming out to the States soon to follow up on these missions
so would 
appreciate some contacts to hook up with in person ....
  Don't know how long I'll survive surfing the wave of incoming SFrave so feel
free to e-mail
me on 100711.504@compuserve.com .  Web Site in the building docks as we speak .
( Freud in the C-Serve homepages if u fancy a squint but its still a frame so to
speak ! )..
   Thanx for your time ....

   all the best
Freud

Andrew Freudenberg

Filterless Records : Home of Tribal Energy , Mobeus , Phreax , Melt and the Soup
to name a few !!
Club Alien : Compilation featuring Underworld , Tribal Energy , Eat Static ,
Pete Lazonby etc...
Nu D&B sounds coming soon .
Nu singles on Filterless : TRIBAL ENERGY " Karma Khaos "
                                                 MOBEUS " Plasm 604 "
coming early in the nu yr   PHREAX " Cut to the Chase E.P "

Hi again,

Well, the ricochet finally connected.  This has been happening a lot out 
here in livermore lately.  (Geez, can't wait to move to the city)  
Hopefully we won't have so many connect troubles tomorrow night.

images should be coming thru now.

It going to be at Pt. Molate. If you want to lend a hand be there between
10-11am.  Also, if you have any tarps please bring them. I'm hoping for at
least clear skies right above us. Which might just be according to the
weather the rain might miss us. It my rain in the city but it will be
somewhat clear and patchy at Pt Molate.   Hope to see you all out there,
and bring somethin warm we WILL rock this party.

 Well, I still say that Pt. Molate got less than the rest of the SF Bay
area that day. And, yeah, it was more than "a little" , especially with the
cold later that day.

 My standard of "rain" is conditioned by growing up in Hawaii, where what
we got at Pt. Molate qualifies as "heavy drizzle".

 Have fun and good luck you guys!!!

Well......I guess its good I didn't get those T-shirts.  The doctor tells me
all of my blood numbers are down or near anemic levels, and blood sugar is
above average.  So,
doctors orders are to take care of myself. Really. So, if you would refund
my t-shirt money I would appreciate it.  Love to you.

        What type of medical conditions warrant use of marijuana?

        Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm. I want to go to BBQ & Beats, but I'm
soooooo tired, and I'm just not in the mood to freeze my bootie off(with a
chance of icicles forming). I don't know about Famtasia either? I have
plenty of money, I'd have to get a couple people to go with me so I won't
have to leave them. But I don't think that I'd handle staying up all night
too well at the moment, so I don't know. It's still early, I hope everything
rips today. I'll most likely go to MAD monday though.

in that case, i'd say pot is pretty damn mild and benign compared to what some
doctors prescribe.  i had a friend who used to get way messed up on downers
and pain-killers, etc that she got from a doctor.  she almost died a couple 
times, mixing pills with *legal* vodka.  those doctors are evil and should
replace the pot dealers in *federal prisons*, no?

Right on!  And, you don't have to get gifts for people at Xmastime.  How
many times do you see something and think, "So-and-so would LOVE that!"?
How many Xmases do you end up getting something for that same person just
because you have to?  Well, put the two together! 

I don't even wait for Xmas to give it to them.  My friends all know that I
don't follow the same holiday schedule as everyone else, and most of them
don't, either.  It's totally fun to surprise people with "that perfect
gift."  It's even more of a surprise (and, therefore, more FUN!) if they
aren't expecting a gift.

Who needs the tension of watching someone open a gift on Xmas morning,
knowing that no matter what it is they will say, "Oh, I love it!"?  (To
which you respond with, "I'm really glad.  I like the present that you got,
me, too.  We'll be friends forever!" (Can you detect my antagonism 
toward Disney-style interactions?) ) <grin>

Anyhow, 'nuff on that.

Has anyone gone to the San Francisco Shopping Center on the day after
Thanksgiving?  It's one of my holidays.  I don't ever buy anything, but I
love to go and look at the faces of the people who are following the
routine.  The look like they are working in a morgue.  They are rude to
each other, and seem agitated.  And the best part... There are thousands of
them!  It's so FUN!

Okeedoke!
Have fun!

     Following on from my query yesterday re : which book by Terence 
     Mckenna to read next, it would seem that his book "True 
     Hallucinations" wins the much coveted "Best book to read after Food of 
     the Gods" award.
     Thanks for all the suggestions.
     
     Anyone read that new William Gibson book ? "Virtual light" (his last 
     one) was quite good, it was set in San Francisco in a future where the 
     homeless have taken over the bay bridge and it is like a suspended 
     shanty town.

Was a killer party!!!!  It went off very very VERY well.  There were some
minor sound problems but the crew fixed them A.S.A.P  It was really reall
cool.  I must have met everyone there.  I was on E for most of the night,
no ALL NIGHT.  I said hello to everyone and if you were there I was wearing
a number 17 t-shirt  =)  Anyway, I'm looking forward to a wrinkle in time
tonight, I just woke up at 2:20, so I did get a lot of sleep (well at least
for me) and I hope to see all of you happy ravers tonight!!!

        You betcha!

        I am currently thinning out my collection and have about 800-1000
pieces for sale. Nothing very recent though. Lots of 90-92 breaks and ravey
techno. Lots of '91 rare Italian 'party music' (pianos, breaks, cheesy
vocal samples). Quite a few UK progressive things from 92-93. The odd
british promo/white label and some weird and wacky one offs. There may be
more to come as I haven't finished sorting through the whole collection.
        To make it easier for people to view, they are housed at 678 haight
street (a new CD and vinyl boutique called Faster Bamboo), the # is
415.255.8973, ask for Wade.
        Good Luck

Hi. just wanted to know if anyone from Berkeley, or close to needs a 
ride to Famtasia. Sorry, though, I can only fit one person. 
Don't know what I'll be wearing, but I'll be at least a little dressed 
up in glitter and the like. See you there.

Oh my gosh! This sucks! I bought tickects for Famtasia, and I could 
swear that it was Saturday night. I was getting so excited to go and 
then I saw messages saying that they were going to Famtasia and then 
Wrinkle on Saturday. I ran and checked the tickets, they didn't say a 
date, so I cheked all the other messages to find out that I missed it!
Do you know how horrible this is? 
I haven't gone to a rave forever, and I really really needed to go to 
one this weekend, you don't know how bad. Now I don't have enough money 
to go to A wrinkle in time AND I had told my friend it was on Saturday, 
too. So now there goes her money and she's pissed. AHHHHH! 
On top of that my friend hit another car when he was driving mine and 
broke a tail light and put Huge dent in it. 
I really need to go to a rave, I'm going to try to beg it out of my 
mother to send me some.Good luck, it's not likely!
Oh well.

     The last time the Chemical brothers played here (the Trocadero) I had 
     been planning on going for ages. My friend Damien bought the tix a few 
     days b4 the show and gave me mine when we met up in the Mad dog in the 
     fog. I put it in my pocket and found it at work (In Berkeley) the next 
     day.
     
     So...I put it into a drawer in my desk so that it would be safe.
     Friday the day of the show comes around and I'm talking to folks at 
     work about this show I'm going to at the Trocadero.
     
     I get a ride home with a workmate's girlfriend and then the 
     realization hit me like a ton of bricks that said ticket was not on my 
     person but instead tucked away in a drawer in a securely locked 
     building all the way back over the bay bridge.
     
     Doh !

Hey,

I was wondering if any of you could give me feedback as to what clubs in
the Bay Area have nice video setups (ie. projection screens, light shows,
etc.) I'm particularly interested in clubs that have big screen TVs or
projection TVs that project onto the wall or large sheets.  They don't have
to be setup every night, but preferrably on a regular basis (like
Bondage-A-Go-Go Wednesdays at the Trocadero).

Thanks!

-Tal.

     Hello everybody :
     
     I posted this questionnaire a while back with the intention of 
     collecting and posting the results as soon as was possible. For a 
     number of reasons to numerous to mention (i.e. laziness) I have not 
     gathered the info together until now. The replies ranged from the 
     "exxcellent idea"  type to one who basically told me get a life. He 
     subsequently recanted (having seen the error of his ways) and sent his 
     replies to me.
     
     
     I have to say that the amount of replies was not huge. But I've always 
     felt it's quality not quantity that counts. So if any of you feel 
     misrepresented by the results don't blame me, I can only go by those 
     that forwarded their opinions to me.
     
     I received a request from the *alleged* administrator of a French 
     mailing list and record label - F communicatios - asking my permission 
     to translate and use the quesstionnaire in his/her country and of 
     course I agreed.
     
     Special thanks to Ozymandias G. Desiderata, Andre Lucerno and David 
     Lowe for their detailed replies.
     
     If you feel that your "best of.." was not represented E-mail me for 
     the questionnaire.
     
     Peace,
     
     
     Ciaran O'

This is fantastic.  While you don't get /all/ the squlchiness one gets
(like, when the cut-off frequency is set high and the modulation around
medium and high), it still makes me feel less bad about selling my 303
about 6 months ago.  And about defecting to win95, for that matter. :)

I think the system would like you to believe that overpopulation is the
problem, and that the current way of doing things is "a natural means
by which organizations/people can increase their efficiency by 
concentrating on their specialties, thereby capturing economies of
scope and scale". Unfortunately, in all this focus on efficiency and
economy, we are also setting up a system which artificially inflates
the cost and attainability of "natural resources" by hoarding them, by
creating artificial demand for them, and then limiting those that can
attain them to those that have money or excesses of other tradeable
hoarded resources.

	As a side-effect of this system, we regularly have farms that
	THROW AWAY milk, cheese, grains, and other foodstuffs simply
	because giving it  away to those in need would actually
	decrease the artificially inflated costs at which these goods
	are sold. Certainly, part of this excess food is given to
	foreign countries as foreign aid, but only if the agribusiness
	can sell their excess to the government (aka US taxpayer
	subsidies of US mega-agribusinesses). The food we produce and
	throw away could be used to feed a majority of the hungry
	people on earth, if it weren't for agribusinesses bottom lines
	(and the cost of transportation). There is enough for
	everybody, you are believing in their myth to think that in
	order for you to be happy/fed/housed, someone else needs to be
	homeless and starving.

	As a side effect of this system, restaurants in the USA
	regularly THROW AWAY enough food to to easily feed all the
	homeless people on the streets.

	As a side effect of this system, people can actually LIVE
	by scavenging the WASTEPRODUCTS of our consumer society
	(cf, dump-scavenger societies in India, Brazil, etc).

So no, I totally and completely disagree that "world hunger" and
"homelessness" are a result of overpopulation. I reject your implicit
beliefs that the human race must suffer their plight because they've
lost some "survival of the fittest" race. Their plight stems 100
percent from greed and hoarding of natural resources, which is a
pollution upon the natural order of things. Please note that the only
reason why i'm bringing "natural" up is because you bring up the
concept of starvation as natural, while not noting that we've set up a
completely unnatural system and are then expecting to use social
darwinism as an "out" to expliciate the suffering we've created as
"natural").

Finally, although I believe overpopulation *IS* a problem, you'll note
that none of the power structures that are promoting hoarding and greed
are doing a single thing to diminish overpopulation. The Catholic
Church still decrees that birth control and abortion is a sin;
Christian groups pressure governments and voters  around the world to
not promote birth control in public schools; they pressure mothers
seeking abortions to carry their babies to term (but never actually
provide the full financial/educational support for these unwanted
babies). And they apply vicious political opposition against
organizations that promote population control and sustainable growth.
(It is "natural" for a population to seek means to control it's growth
-- why then are we so hell-bent on overpopulating the planet, and why
are our governments sponsoring/protecting those that seek to hinder
population control?).

The reason for all of the above is simple -- it's the same reasoning
that goes into the hoarding mentality that creates value/wealth by
creating artificial defecits. By creating excess humans that cannot
adequately feed/sustain/educate themselves, you've automatically
created a "slave" class that you can abuse, exploit, and underpay as
subsistance workers. After all, wealth cannot be created "in a vacuum"
-- you have to have poor people to  compare your riches to, and you
have to have a desparate class of people working for the rich at
inequitable wages in order for those at the top to be able to
accumulate more than their fair share of wealth. (and by "slave" --
note that we've managed to finesse those old-fashioned shackles and
leg-irons -- it's been conveniently replaced by "clean" shackles in the
form  of $$$, loans, rent, health-insurance-payments, auto-insurance
payments, as well as government mandated IRS, child-support, and 
alimony payments (of course, you get to see the real shackles if you
happen to disobey da massa on the latter)).

Me? I'm just another house-nigga workin' on the plantation... But don't
worry about me so are you!

Let's talk rain - let's talk the night of Connection II, Berkeley Marina,
the rain starting around 5am and continuing until the end, coming down
heavy enough that Moonpup was showing folks how the needle of the record
player left waves on the standing water on the records as they played...
and a turntable-denching failure in the tarps is recorded lovingly on
the tapes of the party, too.

Hey everybody. Firstly, I would like to say  I am very impressed that 
the Harmony people stopped ticket sales when they did. Major props to 
whoever (rightly) decided that the dance studio had reached its capacity.

Business at hand: I accidently packed a Pac Man shirt into my duffle bag 
when I left the party this morning. It is blue with white sleeves, and 
smells like cigarettes. If it's yours, let me know by email,

dj radon

Greetings:

We have just finished adding another enhancement to x-radio.  Now,
visitors to the site can generate a playlist based on a particular music
genre.  The playlist will consist of (somewhat) random tracks taken from all
the titles we have in that genre.

In addition, a single RealAudio metafile is created for the entire playlist,
which means that listeners will not have to keep returning to the  site to
select the next track in the list.  Instead, all the tracks will play
through sequentially.  Listeners can use their RealAudio players to move
forwards and backwards through the playlist (try pressing PgUp and PgDn in
the RealAudio player).

Now it's easier than ever to tune in and hear the latest in underground music!

peace, love, unity, respect
pauly


p.s. this was a recommendation from one of our visitors!  please continue
making great suggestions like this one!

Hey y'all!

A friend of mine just sent me this site. nifty stuff! Not *completely*
Mayan related, but definitely doomsdayish.

http://www.2013.com/

Found some cool blurbs that we can all relate to:

Your brain is 

        PROGRAMMABLE 

  If you're not programming your own brain
 chances are someone else is doing it for you. 

the whole world has gone
                INSANE
             why shouldn't you? 

EVOLUTION
   can be frightening... but you can be brave 

EAT YOUR FEAR 

Etc. Lots of cool stuff, kinda MkzdK 'ish.

later!

wow what a GREAT weekend!
	I started out at Famtasia where I met so many beautiful people and 
heard some equally beautiful music! the party was great, even though the 
floor got a little muddy, it was ignorable compared to the wonderful 
time my friends and i had! Jonathan's set was great, kept me on my feet 
even though I'm getting over (another?) cold. the positive attitude i 
had was shared by EVERYONE to an ultimate degree (or so it seemed). :> 
this party had great potential, and it SOARED! seeing Eric walking 
around waving and smiling at everyone never ceased to make me smile :>
	I missed the BBQ, somehow I ended up rideless, but I heard it went 
off.. a little rain never hurt anyone, right? then, we went to get 
tickets for Wrinkle in Time, which was sold out by then (we arrived 
LATE), but nevertheless we hopped right back into the car and drove to 
150 folsom and joined the junglists at rhythm and sound. the music was 
loud, hectic, and fucking great. curious's set was a little too trancey 
at times for my mood, but everyone else seemed to LOVE it, and who am I 
to complain? ;> i'm glad we ended up there, jungle never ceases to make 
my body move and set my mind free.I ran into a few people who had been 
raving since Famtasia (hell yea!) we left early, exhausted and 
exhilirated of the great weekend we had. Doesn't rain feel FANTASTIC 
after a night of dancing? 
	I met a # of SFravers, it's good to finally put a face to the name :> 
*waves* ad *smiles* to Eric, Mike, Micron, Leslie, and everyone else out 
there. and MAJOR props to all of you who actually stayed up and did 
Famtasia, BBQ & Beats, and Wrinkle In Time/Rhythm and Sound. Hope you're 
all asleep right now, catching up so you don't get sick! :>
I guess next on the list of things to do for me would be Audio Impact.. 
Take care !

Well......I guess its good I didn't get those T-shirts.  The doctor tells me

above average.  So,
doctors orders are to take care of myself. Really. So, if you would refund
my t-shirt money I would appreciate it.  Love to you.

...I always thought it was weird when someone would write again to apologize
about wasting bandwith, or posting a private message to the list...or try to
"take something back..."

It's kinda like an Andy Rodney thing..."Well, if you're posting to apologize
for wasting my time before, whatya think you're doing now...?"

But, as one of my favorite characters in a play (Murry Burns) says in 1000
Clowns, "Sometimes in life all you can really expect is a good apology."

So, I'M REALLY SORRY for airing my dirty laundry (T-shirts)....onto the list.

My doctor tells me I've got to "chill" for a month and take the tests again.
This wasn't exactly the news I wanted for my 45th birthday, but, a "word to
the wise, is well advised." And considering the alternative, I'd rather be
here than not.

Dear SFWavefwends,

OK, here's another one (like there's a shortage of bumpersticker ideas!):

			     "Wavers got wa!"

("wa" being a Japanese term meaning something along the lines of ability
to get along harmoniously with others)

Th-th-th-that's probably not all folks,

Dear SFRavefriends,

	This is not quite a timely follow-up, I meant to send it off
earlier, but it got shunted into my "postponed messages" file and
overlooked...

My computer tells me that on Thu, 7 Nov 1996, leftjab shared (in part):

> even with respect to income, the u.s. now has the most uneven income
> distribution amongst the richest industrialized nations (this wasn't the
> case 20 years ago), and the highest level of child poverty.  

	This is somewhat dubious, since the government keeps redefining
the poverty level.  Also the way it is currently calculated, they do not
take into account non-monetary assistance such as food stamps, public
housing, etc.
	It is clear that many people are still poor however, including
children, and in my view it is absolutely criminal that the government be
taking any money from them *at all*, in the form of sales tax, social
security, or any other form of witholding.  When you're trying to get by,
you need every dollar.
	Instead of worrying about raising taxes on the rich, let's lower
taxes on the poor and middle class where it will do some good.  Or can't
the government get by on less than $1 trillion a year?

Much love,
				<<< Starchild >>>

Knucklehead U R nuts!!!

Who else would throw a free outdoor party in the middle of a
rainstorm???

But hey, all I have to say is, it went O-F-F!!!

Once we got the sound going and the BBQ grilling, who gave a f@!k out
the rain! 

And yeah, all you DJs there are just as nutty as Mr. Knuckle.

Highlight of the day: "How many ravers does it take to put up a
tarp!!?!?!?!?!?" Obviously longer than it take to set up sound!
hahahahahaha!!! explain this one guys... I got it on tape!! ;^)

B&B3 was the perfect appetizer for Harmony!

love beamin' north,

Terry

Well, I really don't know what to say! I let better judgement get clouded.
O'well, After we got the circus tent up the party went off, there were 200
people there having a blast. It my have rained but the giant circus tent
was big enough for the 200 people that was there and it was awesome. Then I
woke up from slipping in the mud and hitting my head on a tree and go,
"Damn where did the tent go!", Where did all those people go"  And reality
set in.


I just want to thank those hardcore people out there that came out to
B&BIII. I know I shouldn't of had it, but if the people that did showed had
an ounce of fun, then I'm happy. I also want to thank the DJs that ventured
out there and spun. All of you did a GREAT job. Alex, Thanks for dealing
with your time slot. Dan(Micron) Thanks for coming out and spinning. Loved
your set. This DJ from Switzerland came and spun for us, Dj Ramtin or
something like that. BioJeff for showing up and giving us another wonderful
set.

And to Noah Ruiz, the man that stuck by me all day and helped out with
everything as well as Chris and James that came with him. You didn't only
have a great set, but you were alot of help too. I think I'll be going out
in the SBay alittle more if you spin out here. I loved your set.

I at least hope the people that did come had an ok time. I want to thanks
all the SFRavers that helped out and came out to this wet and wild BBQ.

I do promise that the next BBQ & BEATS will go off and there WILL be a
clear sky and warm weather.

Thanks,

Tim (knucklehead)


P.S. Terry, it takes 7 ravers to put up a tarp, and only 3 to setup sound
in less then half the time it took to set up the tarp. That was tooooo
funny. I swear I'm going to put that together and mark every single pole.

Good Morning Everyone!!!!!! =)

Well, what a weekend!  I must say I had my share of water this weekend! =)

Tim, thankyou for a good time and all the food you provided.
We all did the best we could under the conditions.  I met new friends
(alex,terry,micron,leslie,branka,Ethan,all the people there tring to put up
the tarp, I forgot so many names, sorry!)  I had a blast and would do it
again in a heart beat!

While I was spinning I was looking at the rain and the bridge and water and
was just thinking how wonderful this all was, and it made me so happy no
matter the mud and rain.  I had a great time setting up, and the tearing
down was a bit messy, but James, Tim, Chris and I were all pretty happy
when it was all packed!=)

Alex,Micron and Biojeff were great!  You guys played some killer tunes!!! =)

Thanks Ethan for the sound system!  It sounded great!

To all the people whoes names I forgot I'm sorry!  But thankyou for coming
up and saying hello!

Everybody have a good day!

Noah Ruiz =)

p.s. How many ravers does it take to put up a tarp????? =)

BBQ and Beats had great people, *bomb* music, terrific foodstuffs and
a whole lot of liquid sunshine!

Actually, the trees at Pt. Molate provided quite a bit of shelter from the
rain.  I think we were lucky that the rain was falling streight down
(there was virtually no wind).

Parties are what you make of them, and everybody at BBQ+beats decided to make
it a great party, despite the elements.

Anyone call the voicemail for this party, cool sound effects. It may be
worth checking out even if it's in Sacramento, nothing else really
happening that day according to the calendar. What does everyone else
think??

Hey all!

Food Not Bombs is working on another party.  Unfortunately, the venue that
will be donating it space to us will only let us have it on a Thursday or a
Sunday.  The support we got from SFRaves last time was great, so I thought I
would leave it up to y'all.  

What day do you thing would be best to throw our non-prime night party?

Please respond to me personally.  Even a quick note just saying the day
would be great (of course, any other communcations would be greatly enjoyed
*8>)  ).

I'll post the results soon.  Many, many thankoos.

PLUR,
Kerry

Hello sfraves,

        I have not yet been able to talk to Omar about the party. I do know
that he was able to see the party through the "Wrinkle Cam." So when I talk
to him, I will see what he says about it. But I know that he will thank all
of you who came out and supported him and the rest of us (Harmony). The
party was incredible, and I know that Omar could feel our energy Saturday
night! I will post what he has to say after I see him today. Stay Tooned!

Peace, love and harmony to all!!!

Just have to say the rave scene in Santa Barbara is like a child in a
storm - trying to run out into the rain is difficult in this little
newly wed, nearly dead paradise.  Thanks to Mo & Sam of SOMA and others,
the kids are splashing in the puddles - smiles to them for gettin' it
goin'.

But damn if I can't wait to get outa'her and dance exxxstatically in the
rain of the SF scene.  Left Chi-house scene four years ago and my body
aches to move. 

Lookin' future wise to SF.

see the stone float.

OK folksies...here we go...

My company is sending me to Santa Clara for some classes December 2-6
and I was basically wanting to know if I could get some info regarding
some decent clubs and/or raves in the SF/SJ area.  

Please keep in mind...I'm a 27yr old Ohioan that has never been to a
rave or a good techno club (go figger...coming from such a cultural
Mecca).  I will be here, by myself, for a week...and I know NO ONE in
California (sob).  I know this may be asking a lot, but I would like to
hook up with some groovy folks that wouldn't mind showing me how
SFRavers party.  A friend here from work speaks ever so highly of the SF
scene, and recommended I contact you.

Thanks in advance-

Subject: "Harmony's Comeback!?!?!?"
Sender: sfraves-owner@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

Hello again,

        Well, after reading this thread, I figured I should respond...

        Over three years ago, Harmony was thought of by a few certain
people. Over the years, different people have joined our family to help, as
well as left us. This includes some of the main organizers of the "Harmony"
parties. I am the only organizer in the collective who has consistantly been
there and helped with every Party since the beginning. (except my B-Day ;) I
have worked closly with several different people organizing the parties we
have done, but when we do an "Anniversary Party," it's the only party out of
the whole year that the original organizers are all working together. This
was always something special to us, and that is what makes the anniversary
parties so interesting. There are a lot more people involved with a lot more
ideas and creativity, so we can make them a lot bigger.

        But, as we all grow up, some of us gain responcibilities and move on
to do different things. The original "Harmony Crew" is really not coming out
anymore, nor are some of them putting in the time and energy it takes to put
on a "Harmony" size event. We also feel that it is kinda funky to throw an
anniversary party for a collective like Harmony, when half the people in the
collective won't be there. It's kinda like a family reunion, with only half
of the family wanting to go. Our goal in Harmony was to put on events that
we would want to go to, and that we would be able to produce... together.
But as it seems right now it's getting harder and harder to get everyone
together. There are many reasons for this. As I said above, some of them
(organizers) are gaining responcibilities in their lives that take up their
time, some don't like the direction that Harmony Productions has gone, and
some are just plain and simple burnt out. These are all very valid reasons.
So it was voted on, and decided that the 3 year anniversary party would be
the last "Harmony" party. (maybe forever, maybe not, we'll see what road
life leads us down) 

        Now as far as this "comeback." Like Pengo said, "Don't call it a
comeback, we been here for years!" I fully intend on throwing all the
parties I can for all of you ravers. It's what drives me right now.
Although, it might not look like it, I do have a lot of fun promoting our
parties. Harmony parties are a special place for us. We can all come in good
spirits and party our asses off together. Celebrating the peace, love,
positivity, and most of all the harmony in our lives! So, now I am now
working with one of the best crews I think Harmony Productions has ever had,
and I don't see how we can stop now! (I wish I could name all of you, as you
know there are too many of you guys! But I love you anyways!) The parties to
look for from us are, (as most of you know) "Beautiful People", "Hunny", "A
Wrinkle in Time", "Free Harmony on the Beach", and the newest one "Freaky
People" (a dress-up Beautiful People party). There is much more to come in
the future from Harmony Productions, but as far as the original "Harmony",
it's debatable...

        I hope this clears some of the confusion... Smile!

Peace, love and harmony to all!!!

Greg =)

Hello again,

        I am sorry if this has been posted twice, but things are a little
funny with my computer today...

        It comes to my attention that Matt and I need a ride to S.F. from
S.J. today before 4pm. We have to return some equiptment (small stuff that
could fit in your trunk easily, so you don't need a truck) that we rented
for the "Wrinkle" party. So if anyone out there in SFR land could help us
out, I would greatly apprieciate it! We of course would pay for the gas!
Please respond privatly and thanks in advance!

Peace, love and harmony to all!!!

Greg =)

First, I am DYING to hear more about Wrinkle in Time.  Will someone PLEASE
post a descriptive review to satiate my curiousity?!!  I had planned on
going up until about 3 pm on Saturday when I made a change of plans.  Did
the virtual reality machine go off?  How were the three different rooms?
I couldn't be there, but I'm dying to hear about it.

Second, I just caught a news report about cops being able to search your
car for drugs.  The State Supreme Court or a State Judge (wasn't clear on
this) ruled that when the police stop you for whatever they may ask you if
they can search your car.  You can *voluntarily* allow this, but they
*cannot* make you.  However, they *do not* have to tell you you are free
to go.  So, you may not actually know you don't have to let them search
your car.  Supposedly, this is to allow you to *voluntarily* choose to let
them search.  I didn't catch the whole story, so if anyone knows anything
further, please elaborate.

-KaySEE


p.s.  I had a great weekend, went to a bar and was reminded just how warm
raves can be.  Man, that will teach me for *even* thinking raves have
attitude.  Just goes to show you how you can take things for granted.
People can't even try to be friendly unless they are picking up on you.
There's nothing like a reality check to make you appreciate something all
the more!! 

There was this moment when the dj put on some songs (was a
hip-hop bar) that everyone loved and started screaming about.  There was
this psuedo-semlance of a *slight* vibe.  And I grabbed my friends, who
were really enjoying this part, and told thim that this is nothing
compared to the best raves and maybe even the worst.  I was hoping
they'd actually listen to me and I could get them to go more frequently.
Yeah, right! :)

To all that responded to my first e mail about my father and his condition
thank you all so much for the positive energy that you beamed towards my
father and my family.  It must have worked cause the doctors have taken all
the tumor and cancer out.  He is under Chemo treatment right now.  As soon
as he has a couple more treatments they'll be able to put him back together
and live life.  My father wants to thank you all for supporting me, and
when he gets better I'm
going to take him to an event and have you all meet him.  I think he would
like that!  Would you all like to meet him?  He started crying when I told
him about all your support and how you all asked about him on Saturday!

I can't express how I feel right now!  I want to cry from enjoyment and
stress.  I thought that this whole situation would cramp my style spinning
at BBQ & BEATS, but I used it to my advantage.  That set I did out there in
the rain is dedicated to my father and my family.  I transferred all that
energy towards my set.  I hope you all enjoyed it!

Once again thank you all for your support!  After meeting all of you at BBQ
and Beats I feel much closer to you all.  There is one person I would like
to give a phat thank you to, and thats Branka!!!!  Thank you so much!  =)
But don't get me wrong you all were a phat part of this healing energy you
shot to my father, Thank You!!!!!  I can't say that enough times...

I love you all on this list for your support and careingness (is that a word)!

Keep it up!  You are all great people!!!!!!!

Love,   Noah Ruiz =)

I'm ready to spin again I have so much energy to share with you all!  Lets
get it on... =)

A Wrinkle in Time was fun.  At the studio, they had the same room they
usually use for dancing decorated with lotsa blacklight friendly Winnie
the Pooh and Tigger posters.  The music had a lot of energy and the whole
time I was there the dance room was a bouncing frenzy.  I especially like
the lighting in this room.  Usually I don't notice lighting effects too 
much, but in this room whoever was controlling the lights was really keeping
it interesting.  They had 3 smaller intellabeam above the dj that they
strobed onto the crowd.  Some people may have found it irritating, but
personally, I thought it was really cool.  The effect was totally hypmotizing.
Then they would stop those lights and flood the room in blacklight for
awhile.  Then they would scan their other intellabeams...  Basically,
a whole lot of eye candy.

The regular chill room was closed off and they had the other 3rd room
setup for Stella Luna, Ran's gear and Rick&co's ambient setup.  I like
these chill rooms where they pretty much just leave things open for
ravers to display their talants.  

The crowd was on the younger side, but these are definatly kids who "get
it" and extend great energy and vibes.  There is just no way you could
get the sort of energy that was brewing in the dance room without the
18-and-younger ravers.  Several of my 20-something friends who were there
commented about the giggly, "I'm on e are you let me tell you all about
because I'm *so cool*" scene... no big deal... those kids all seemed to
stay in big groups so you could avoid them if you wanted to.  I met
some kids who were truly beatiful and that seemed to offset the other
vibes.  

I think a lot of my 20-something friends wonder if these kids get raving,
or if they are just there to get trashed on drugs.  Well, there is definatly
a fine line between the two!  All I can say is this, the recreational
rave drug experience is really something that can overshadow anything else
at a party, the music, the vibe, ect.  With new people coming into the
scene all the time, you can't expect young people to immediatly identify
with the spirituality of dancing and music AND the drug experience all at
once.  Give them time... these drugs do, in fact, become boring after awhile
and those who really love the experience will strive to achieve it in
other ways besides drugs exclusively.

Anyway, I really hope this event raised some money for omar.  I am sure
the vibe alone was healthy for him, but some material compensation is always
good too.

-troy

ps:  Any of you on socal-ravers reading about their Elevation II party this
weekend?  It seems that insanely great parties are becoming the norm
all over california... hooray for net.ravers!

 What ever happened to this thread?  I thought this was one of the more 
exciting 
 ideas to cross the list (i.e., a SFR  ski/snowboard/rave weekend).  I was 
 off the list for a couple of weeks, so maybe I missed the conclusion?  Was it 
taken 
 privately, off the list? If so, I want in!!  :)  Last message I had, there was 
 a list of interested people, and a couple of potential cabins/houses up a 
 Tahoe.  Who has organized parties before, that is interested? I'll help in any 
 way possible-  email me privately or on the list.  SNOWPLUR.

well...

I'm still recovering from the best fuckin' birthday I've ever had!!!!

I can't believe how unbelievably *together* harmony's parties are!! Wrinkle
in Time was the single best rave experience of my life: so many friendly
faces, a chance to help out with setup once again, a mind-blowing chill
room (better than the one at the 3-year in my opinion, but I my opinion's
pretty biased by the good times I had the other night =) and the music...
I'm impressed!!! I had only heard two of the dj's play before, but they ALL
were unbelievable! People need to take chances with relatively unknown dj's
more, they add variety and life to a party. =)

The night before I helped Jonathan out with Famtasia... apart from two
minor sound problems (which took but minutes to fix) this party was the
shit as well. Jonathan should getting a standing "o" from everyone on this
list for the enrgy he put into famtasia and the results he got out of it!

smiles,

ok...ok here goes...the party was incredible, It was so great to get there
early help set up and see the whole thing come together...before I knew
it...five minutes till lights out!...holy lights out batmen! how did that
happen so fast...there were two rooms, the main room and the chill room,
the main room was set up spectacular...highlights are the "pyramid from
hell" black light set up, and the manequin with butterfly wings and a
disco ball spinning in her hands, I actually spent very little tim ein the
dance room this time, usually this is the ONLY place Iam at...dancing my
booty off...but this time...not sure why...maybe the mushies had something
to do with the fact that I spent most of my time int the chill room going
woooaoaaa!!
	Speaking of the chill room...DAMN!!!! that room was SET UP!!! I
cant even begin to give it justice with words...
the sights: on one whole wall one BIG wall was divided in half on one half
there was a HUGE projection of the new 64 bit nintendo with super mario
brothers...it was RAD!!!! you could go over and play on the other side of
the room and it was projected onto this huge screen. Then the other half
of the wall was a normal projection which played various animantions
throughout the night. The entire space was covered with harmony flowers
and fuzzy trees and cool glowing banners...and the black
lights...damn...there were alot!
	the sounds: As I made my way into the chill room once it had got
going...I was initially going to get some water before havoc set loose in
my mind...thinking to myself as Im on the dance floor...tony...you had
better get some water soon, cuz tyour not gonna wanna deal with it very
shortly! So im ...working... my way to the water fountain and somehow
ended up in the chill room loolking for a quiet corner FAST! and i hear
this crazy tribal deumming with guitars and stuff...I cant quite describe
it but it was very powerful, I think...(this could be distorted!) what I
saw was this guy with big sticks and about 3 or 4 bongo drums BANGING the
crap out of them! WOW!!! thump thudda thumpthump thudda thu thuda thu
thudda thu thump THUMP...things get kinda fuzzy after this, I was goin
hella deep...C-labs  played some incredible soothing sounds for my tender
mind, and pengo let me make play his VR game...which I finally got the
hang of...that thing is really cool!
	Well, that is my attempt at a verbal description of a beautiful
evening...I hope it helps! love to ya's

tony rose...:P

I was really afraid that things would go wrong with the Virtual Reality
Machine at "Wrinkle in Time". Silly me! It was a totaly awsome
expierence!! Not only for the people that used it but for me, it was an
amazingly educational expierence!!!

Early on during the party, I had 'Descent', which is a neat looking but
complex flying game. Descent was cool but because of it's complexity, it
was difficult to aproach for people. Then I put on a much simpler game
called 'Ascent', that was nothing more than the player jumping from rock
to rock over a river (lava?). This game however totaly changed the was
people used the VR machine!! Instead of just one person using it,
someone would use the helmet to look around while another person
'jumped' for them. Then people started passing it between them,
teaching  each other how to play and expierencing the "inner-world" more
as a group!! Ascent was also very cool after the whole house was high,
because myself or someone else would be able to move the person around
in the VR world while they just sat back and tripped out!

We really were fortualte to have a VR machine there at all, becuase mine
decited not to work on Saturday (doh!). But fortunatly, I was able to
barrow a friends. I still want to bring my original system to a party
because it does offer a much better experience. What I *really* hope to
do it bring 2 or more VR machines and have people interact within the VR
world!!! (Food for thought: This doesn't necessarily have to be at the
same party! Hmmmm...)

One final note: For thoes of you that really had a blast with it, send a
quick 'Thank You' note to my friend who let us use it. His email is
jeffk@tenetwork.com (And if it made your acid trip peak, thats cool but
leave that out of the letter ;)) Let's hope he lets me barrow it
again!!Thanks to thoes of you (you know who you are!) who helped me out
Sat night!! It was a blast!!!

Subject: Wrinkle in Time - a cure for rave burnout
Sender: sfraves-owner@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk


Wrinkle in Time was the beginning of something different. 

I felt not so much that I was at a "rave", but more of an underground
festival of art, sound, music, and technology. Never before have I
danced to trip-hop above a virtual reality lava pit. Or watched a
party get propagated on the Internet. Or feared the "little green men"
as Stella Luna jammed in front of Mario.

I spent a serious amount of time in the ambient room, where I finally
had a chance to hear the often talked about Stella Luna (that I missed
at the Harmony 3-year). Although I'm not a big fan of the guitar and
music that features guitar, they were doing something that was far
beyond being a "rock band". So ambient sounding, that sometimes I
thought I was hearing synthesized music.

Consciousness Lab came on afterwards, and played some really nice
ambient/IDM style music. As always, I look forward to seeing techno
being produced live; there's not enough live techno acts at parties.
Later on, some down-tempo trip-hop type sounds were spun, though a
couple of jungle tracks were mixed in. It was sort of strange hearing
jungle played quietly on a sound system, but whatever! :)

I didn't spend enough time in the the main room to hear anyone's set
straight through, but it sounded like Minor Minor was kicking ass as
always. And Trent was spinning some great sounds. Unfortunately,
though I was too occupied to hear the rest of the main room, which was
probably just as well (it was about a million degrees in there!).

Visually, the party was much different than the last few Harmony
parties I had been to, probably due to new props and banners (which
were very well done) and other things like projection screens with
computer graphics and video games (!).

I'm just really happy that there are groups like Harmony that are
doing something interesting with their parties. There have been enough
warehouse drugfests over the years; now it's the time to do something
artistic and creative with the scene. As always, thanks again to all of
the people involved with Harmony for their energy and for helping to
put together something that means so much to so many people.

Steve

This weekend while I was at my dads house and listening to the radio, something 
I haven't been doing very often, live 105 played an orbital song.  I was totally 
surprised and am not sure if live 105 playing orbital is a good thing or a bad 
thing.  As my dad was dancing around the room to it I started thinking it was 
good that orbital was getting the exposure I believe they deserve but also 
thought it was a crime they were being given exposure on such a poseur station 
as live 105.  Not to say that all live 105 listeners are poseurs because I know 
when I lived in the East Bay it was the only halfway decent radio station I 
could get, and I am not a poseur, but I don't beleive the station plays music 
just because they like but of course because they can possibly get some new 
listeners and money.  NOw I lost the point I was trying to make, but I just 
wanted to mention the orbital situation because it just makes me confused as to 
why a radio station such as live 105 would play a song totally out of its 
listeners main interests such as orbital or underworld.  Eagerly awaiting 
comment.

                                      This new one-hour ambient rave music
                               show offers a seamless late night feast of
                               unique sounds and pictures. "AMP" is a
                               showcase for new bands that have embraced

                               Sounds of London. "AMP" is like nothing
                               you've ever seen or heard before on MTV.

Be patient.  Remember, lots of people check email just once a day,
so that means it could take like, 2 weeks for the story to be finished...
but I think it will be worth the wait!

Yea,  and that party WENT OFF!!  Big time.   We arrived early at a shooting
range kind of a place.    The sound wasn't yet setup yet,   but people arriving
early,  contributing to the wonderful vibe.

The DJ's were SICK!!  Amazing set of music,  especially Andy's goa trance with
the vocals.

I just wanted to thank tim for all of his hard work and good energy that he put 
into the BBQ.  He did an amazing job of setting up and taking care of 
everyone.  He even bought most of the goodies for the BBQ.  I think everyone 
that went, including myself, owes tim a big hug and phat props.

While the weather didn't cooperate, it did'nt matter, cuz those that made it out 
seemed to have a BLAST.  Even though at one point i lost feeling in my 
fingers from being too cold.  It was..well....a very nice way to spend the 
afternoon.

And i cannot say how happy i was to meet more cool ppl from the list.  Hello to 
ALL of you.  ALL the dj's were great too.  How i wish it were warm and sunny 
cuz they would've rocked all of u! =P

Once again, thanks tim.

 Sorry. I got it on Friday and sent it away to the next participant this
morning. I only am a slave to the machine at work!!!!

 btw: There were some sfravers down here in LA that went to Elevation2.
I know Uncle Noah was one, but there were more. They totally loved it,
and grooved with us all night. They meet a lot of SCRavers, and had fun.
Then drove all the frig-a-diggin way back home afterwards...crazy man..
crazy....

And there was free water, free oatmeal, free cocoa, free coffee, free
cider, free glowsticks, free glownecklaces, free juice, free fruit, free
candles, free La Brea bakery bread, free hand and foot warmers (it was
in the mountians you know) free dustmasks with free vicks rubs, and free
gloves. Price of admission? $5.  over 600 guests.

That's a budget if I ever saw one huh?

And people charge for water at a $20 event?   Whatever.....

Hey all!

If you are into that high tech/paging/cell phone thang,
I found a great virtual secretary system......... It provides.

Nationwide 888 number

Finds me anywhere I may be, by me programming in all my phone numbers
(home, work, psyche's office....) and allows me to know who's calling
before I accept. 

i.e "Noah's on the phone if you would like to accept the call press
1, to forward him to your message center press 2"

A nationwide fax number that is read back to me over any
phone (for those important business faxes!)

$8.00/month nationwide pager

Programming capabilities to program in 100 of my closest ravers phone
numbers and deliver the same message to
everyone!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Anytime.

I don't know all of the features, but you should check it out!

E-mail me if you want to know more and I will tell you the
company's name etc.

On yet another completely unrelated topic, someone suggested a rave 
integrated with a ski/snow weekend.  Is anyone heading this up?  After 
talking about it over the weekend with Pao, I'd be interested in 
contributing time and energy to this.

peace

Completely unrelated to my most recent post, has anyone on the list read 
the celestine prophecy?  If so, I'd be interested in meeting people for 
dinner somewhere to talk about it.  Email me privately.

Hi All,

somewhat rave related:

sorry for the blatant use of bandwidth... Anyone in the bay area have a 
flatbed scanner that I can use for about an hour?  Thanks.

I wrote this a long time ago... and I never sent it.  You don't have to read it,
but I read your opinion so I figured it would be healthy...

XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

My Take...
     
Fluffy Green Buds
I've noticed it takes the unique and beautiful in a person and makes it stand 
alone.  I love what pot does for most people.  I'm not a big fan of people 
who get too stoned to walk, but in functional amounts... I'd say some of the 
most thoughtful moments of my life could be somehow attributed to pot.  
Marijuana is also a family of highs, and not just one buzz.  Most people 
claim significantly different effects between brown and green strains for 
example.
     
SHROOMS
Mushrooms had a similar effect on me as acid, plus that quivering body rush. 
 To be honest, I'm not the biggest fan.  Only did it a couple times a long 
time ago.  Too little and it just made me jittery and feel like I ate some 
bad Mexican food... too much and God is arguing with your brain and crossing 
wires.  Try mescaline.  That's the sprit trip... I've heard peyote is even 
better.
     
ACID
It's as weird as you are.  As for how clearly you think on it, you want to 
be careful in general with drug-inspired thought processes.  I recommend 
taking an approach of "anything I decide is correct tonight I will ponder 
again tomorrow".  This keeps you from rash behavior and also prompts you to 
learn more form the experience.
     
MDMA
I don't think E covers anything up unless you're doing it for that purpose.  
I think E has helped me wade through some really bizarre shit.  In 
smaller/medium doses (I know a lot of 2 and 3 hitters out there), it has 
amazing effects on your perception of emotions, both remembered and current. 
 For me it does to my heart what acid did to my mind.  Ecstacy has a certain 
regressive quality that prompts many users into exploring roles we perhaps 
should have left behind long ago.  Many people find extraordinary amounts of 
pleasure and solace in hugging teddy bears or talking like children.  It's 
healing, and I'm glad it happens.  It's as fake as you percieve it to be, 
but too many people feel the same way.  As for the girl who thought she was 
a beauty queen, she is only as bad as those guys who think they're robots or 
mackdaddies from hell (wait... I think I've been there).  I think it sucks 
that most men can't admire a woman for being just beautiful without wanting 
to "have" her.  I wouldn't blame her for wanting to feel pretty for a little 
while with no strings attached.  I've been there myself.

     I got invited by a SF-Raver to a party that didn't exist apparently... 
     THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU.
     
     Location:  Non Existent
     Time:      10pmFriday-7amSaturday
     
     Music:     Rich House, some Goa, even ambient on the floor.  The house 
     was great.  I'm not a big house maven, but good music played off a 
     good crowd never fails to put a smile on my face. The goa was good for 
     the party, but it seemed less fresh than it used to... it's probably 
     me.
     
     Chill room was luscious... music, vibe, everything in line.  Too bad 
     it was a little small considering the demand.
     
     Started out with drum circle outside, and a vibe that was soo damn 
     positive.  Chimed in for the last couple jams and for the first time 
     in a while I felt really connected to the other drummers and the 
     people sitting in the middle of the circle at the fire making slight 
     vocal noises and clapping, snapping and rubbing hands together to add 
     to the magic, wooden, driven sound.  Went inside to start the event 
     with a toning exercise.  Damn damn.  Felt sooo good to get out some of 
     that energy.  Even thought I physically felt like I'd been hit by a 
     bus (bad chemical choice earlier in the day), I couldn't help but 
     elevate to the party's level.  Managed to stay amazingly coherent, 
     bright eyed and bushytailed throughout the evening.  Met divine 
     wonderful people all night long, as well as getting a chance to sit 
     back and talk forever with some familiar faces.  Ahhhhh.  Hope they 
     have another one like this soon.  From some of the morning's neighbor 
     related events, these may be in jeopardy  Hope not.  It was really 
     amazing.
     
     Found my car marginally defaced.  Too disgusting to mention to the 
     entire list, but not exactly what I was planning on seeing.  I feel 
     bad for mentioning it now.  Suffice to say some people have done 
     things in my car I haven't done.
     
     Went back sleepy, and crashed with friends in Berkeley through the 
     morning.
     
     Saturday:
     Tim, the BBQ king, reigns supreme (or is that rains?).  BBQ and Beats 
     III was too fun.  Although I'm glad not every party has rain and a 
     vibe of *I love the freaks that would gather outside in the rain to be 
     with other freaks that would gather in the rain*, it was something I 
     almost needed.  A perfect cap to help me through another bout of 
     wondering if this is something I still love or fell into and am stuck 
     in.  I LOVE THESE PEOPLE.  Yes Yes Yes!!!  First and foremost.  
     Partied  everybody out, as well as getting partied out by everybody.  
     The spirit was all about giving, and sharing.  Really liked the view 
     through the fog and rain.  Sorta melancholy and industrial... but the 
     fact that we gathered to be together in this made it strangely 
     beautiful.  I also liked all the DJ's I heard during my short time 
     there (about two hours), and I caught all of Micron's set... which was 
     most tasty.  Good records, good intentions, and good technique.  Sorry 
     if I talked anybody's head off.
     
     Tim, stop apologizing... it was REALLY GOOD (you scared me with that 
     electric shock in the rain thing btw).  I ate well, danced freely and 
     met some new faces.  Look at the bright side... no sunburn or 
     heatstroke!
     
     And finally:
     
     Wrinkle in Time
     Got to the map point... just a little sign that said "Sold Out".  
     That's how I felt... sold out.  Whaaaaa.  Then I remembered an 
     overheard ancestral memory about the location.  Do I dare guess... 
     only other party was Basics (I'm assuming that was an east bay party), 
     and I figured I'd shoot down the street and give the imaginary Wrinkle 
     in Time location a shot.
     
     Pay dirt... I got to the location and was welcomed by Terry, who I'd 
     finally met just earlier that day.  Hello!  More nice people up the 
     stairs.  Hello!
     
     The hallway to the mainroom was clogged with people.  Usually I'm 
     somewhat pleased to be crushed by thousands, but this wasn't the case. 
      People were bumping into, stepping on, and dishing out dirty looks.  
     All without apology or a grin to let me know their intentions were 
     better than their balance.  Is the planet getting sucky?  Had I become 
     jaded after a solid weekend of supremely good will...
     
     Well, no.  As little as a half an hour later, I started to mellow out. 
      Met up with some wonderful people in the relaxo room, and zoned out 
     to Stella Luna for a while.  Greta got her hand stepped on, and that 
     jerky didn't apologize either.
     
     BE NICE YOU ALL!!!
     
     I finally start just grounding myself and realizing that I was in the 
     midst of some really good people and probably concentrating on the few 
     buttheads.  So I relaxed for about a half an hour more.  I got a 
     little hungry and atE a little something to tide me over.
     
     At about 3:00 am the somEthing came over me right about as I had made 
     peace with the notion that my perception was playing more of a part in 
     my enjoyment of the event than the actual event... *WHAT TIMING!*  
     I'll just leave it with... I was wearing a striped black and white ski 
     hat and brown overalls, really stoked and giving as much energy as I 
     could to this party.  I'm so glad for Mike, Moshe, Greta, Libby, Jay, 
     Melanie, Micron, Susan, EPaul, Wayne, Maggie, Renzo, Rick, Shawna and 
     friends (massive gratitude), Mike Migurski (happy birthday to you and 
     the girl who got B'dayd right after you in the hallway), Matt (arch 
     hug meister), SJDRS,SFR & Harmony, Tim, Burger King, Jason, Diana, 
     JohnK, Omar (hope you got the wave, stay strong) and a cast of 
     thousands coming into my life and I into theirs.
     
     I had a really good weekend (I can't seem to remember one to compare 
     it to at this point).  This means we're 2/7's of the way there.  If we 
     had days like this everyday...
     
     Peace,
     AndyW
     
     -
     Rain... I don't mind
     Shine... the weather's fine.
     -
     
     LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE YOU!!!!

	I was spell checking my message, when my Mac got a bus error %#$$#!!!!

So, here I go again....

	Big thanks to Tim and everybody else who helped out with the BBQ.
It was great, although next time we have to make sure we find better
connection at the weather department.

	My roomie Ana, boyfriend Marc and friend Sy (people in my car)
showed up around 3:30.  We were planning to leave SF earlier, but because
of the rain, we didn't leave our house on time.  I was a little bummed
because I wanted to hear Noah's set...

	When we arrived, Tim was standing over the BBQ, Micron was spinning
(that was great :), some people were dancing, some were hiding from the
rain.
I knew a lot of the people there either from the list or just friends who
came out to party and hear some DJs.  I also met couple of new people - hey
Noah =), missed meeting more (somehow I always do that - I guess I am too
busy talking to people I already know), danced a little and around 6pm some
of my friends and I were so cold that the warm BBQ grill did not help any
more....

	Thanks Tim for making all that great food, I am sure many people
enjoyed it (I know I did - couldn't stop stuffing my face :P).  Too bad
there were not more people there, but the once that came appreciated all
the effort.

Hugz,
Branka

Hi everyone!  =)

 Gads! I'm still tired! Well as most of you know the party went off BIG 
time! We actually opened the doors and had the music start on time. As I 
was coordinating the ambient room (and performing) I didn't have much of 
a chance to enjoy the main dance floor but I did get a chance to boogie 
to Deaks which is always fun.

 I gets to the party spot at about 3:30 and starts on the ambient room. 
Once again the room was put together with love from a lot of dedicated 
volunters. You folks were all tremendous!! Esoecially in my mind were, 
Tony Rose, Anthony and Mack (the knife ;), Martin, Carrie (on 
decorations:), and of course others whose names escape my tired brain.

 Huge props to Tim for the doggie bag from BBQ & Beats!! :) also to David 
from InSight Lighting who delivered the tasty morsel.

 I really am thankful to the performers in the ambient room that night. 
There was a lot of last minute changes and everyone worked hard to cope. 
I'm happy to say everyone got their alloted time and more for a few 
(including the surprise DJ at the end who got to play one song ;)

 Props to Rick Riffle from Conciousness Lab Ambient Research Group (did I 
get that right?) and their DJ who filled in at the beggining--great 
sounds!!, Bonnie and Shom (great stuff folks!), Stella Luna who once 
again were over the top and melted what was left of my brain AND huge 
thanks to Dave Baer who provided sound and to Rob from Gateway who 
helped tracked down that annoying buzz (sorry Dave ;).

 The design for the ambient room was not quite where I wanted it but 
folks seemed to enjoy it. It was very crowded but the vibe in there was 
super good all night long!! Me (and the rest of Harmony actually) owe a 
big thanks and phat hug to Rebecca Love Cardennis for providing me with 
away to get my equipment home on Sunday. Due to transportation problems I 
did not have a ride for me and all my gear (a lot of stuff!) and Rebecca 
appeared out of the blue with a friendly smile and phat van. YOU ARE 
F*CKING AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

 Thanks also to her friend Heather who brought Rebecca to her first rave 
(Harmony 3).

 Thanks to Greg for a phun party!!  =) Thanks to Pengo for the VR 
machine!! Thanks to Brandon for his smart bar. Thanks to Brendon (sp?) 
for video!!! =) Thanks for the Wrinkle Cam. I hope Omar saw me wave to him.

 However the folks who stayed to help clean up were the most awesome! 
Thank you!!

 THANKS TO ALL OF YOU WHO CAME AND HELPED TO SPREAD THE VIBE!!  =)



peace y'all,

Thanx for all the info on A Wrinkle in Time.
I really didn't have fun at Basics one bit.
Funky Techno Tribe knows how to throw a party.
But it wasn't the party that hurt me.
It was the "bad ones" agian.
Or atleast the ones I turned into bad people towards me.
I am a tragic victom of total misunderstanding.
Anyhow. It don't matter. One way or the other.
I just know for a fact that I really missed out on Harmony.
If it wasn't twice as far away as Oakland from us.
If it wasn't raining.
And if I knew the location of more than the map point.
I would of defonetly hauled my friends up to the city.

I think I need to buy a new pair of ravE shoes.

I think anyone into the Rave scene should definitely read "Brave New
World"
by Aldous Huxley (1935).  Aside from the almost Shakespearean use of
language,
the book is a description of a futuristic society where everyone stays
happy
on "soma" and goes to tribal dance/religious sex ceremonies....

	"A half gram for a half-holiday
	One gram for a week end
	Two grams for a trip to the gorgeous East
	Three for a dark eternity on the moon"

     and

	"Feel how the greater Being comes
	Rejoice and in rejoicings die
	Melt in the music of the drums
	For I am you and you are I"

	- Aldous Huxley (1935)

Before letting yourself get too excited about entering parallel
universes
or meeting aliens through the use of psychadelics I highly recomend
reading some john lilly, check out this link...at first it may seem that
he is coming to the same conclusions, but you really gottsa get to the
end
before he really draws his hypothesis together..

When I was in college - before I fell from grace and entered engineering
school -
I took an ecology course (part of the botany program) whose textbook was
entitled "The Economy of Nature".  The book made it clear that
eco-systems
and economic systems are VERY similar in their behavior.  Increases in
food supply (lowered costs of products) leads to increases in population
(demand for products, increase in business activity) leading to
subsequent
decreases in population as populations/demand outstrips supply (costs
rise,
business retrenches).

Man's intervention in eco-systems is analogous to government
intervention in economic systems.  You can increase the amount of one
crop/
product but at the expense of bio-diversity/efficiency of the system as
a whole.
Picking one crop/product to grow/protect increases the supply OF THAT
PARTICULAR crop/product but at the cost of lowering the OVERALL "wealth"
of the eco-system/economic system.

It turns out that what is most efficient  for the system as a whole is
NO
INTERVENTION AT ALL.


I realize that there can be exceptions to the general rule above (look
at goverment investments in computers, networking, etc)
(also one can argue that some interventions in eco-systems CAN increase
them - for example diverting a river that would flow into a salt flat
to instead flow into crop land) but as they say :

"Generalizations are GENERALLY true".....

Well, this is about as NON Rave Related as it gets.  But Gosh Darnit, I'm 
Damn pround of my Big Brother!!!  Thats him and his band of the cover of 
the November 15th issue of Bam Magazine!!  (my bro's the one on the 
right!).  

anyways, check it out, and if you're into the "Full-throttle, 
supermelodic punk-ska-metal hybrid" sound as Bam Mag says (ie, typical 
KOME rock stuff), then keep an eye out for their live shows.

Hi!

 I guess I'm still tired. I forgot to thank Steve for bringing his keys 
and jammin' out with us in the wee hours and for his help in cleanup. I 
also forgot to thank David Lowe for his help cleaning up. You guys are 
beautiful!!  =)  Also thanks to Libby for the company and warmth.

peas,

Its interesting to see the perspective on whats considered nu bands 
when all these guys have been hooning around for five years or so
at least . Prodigy had a succession of gimmick singles in the charts
, Chemicals used to be Dust Brothers and were around remixing
quite early on and F.O.S are into their third or fourth album courtesy
of Sony . They are all great bands , ( well U/World is , the Prodigy
nearly are , the Chemicals are not really a band and FOS is an
ambient studio project ) , but not new . These guys are the big boys
but only the tip of the iceberg .
Shut up Freud .
Ok

atb
Freud
Filterless Records
Club Alien
Red Beard Recordings

ps : thanks to all who got in touch , the positive and helpful response
has been great and I cant wait to get over and see it all for real , which
hopefully will be next month . 
  Any ideas on groovy accomodation joints around SF would be much
appreciated....
  Keep it up guys , keep it up !

 Looks like you're not as proud of your brother's band's name! :-)  I might
miss this week's BAM before it changes - what's the band name?

Good house music, a mostly "non-raver" crowd but they seemed to be having
fun despite it :-)

Ah the # 23!  2+3=5; the law of fives.  5x4x3x2x1=120.  And anything with
a vector of 120 produces more combinations then the Human mind can
contain.  Please read Illumminatus trillogy by Robert Anton Wilson and
Robert Shay for further details.

Subject: RE: the "sfr"cabin trip
Sender: sfraves-owner@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

This is to let anyone interested know what's up with the "sfr" cabin trip
III.

Some might recall, last year, about 27 sfravers went up to a big ol plush
cabin in tahoe and had a really really good time. 

This weekend, there will be another one, with some of the same people and a
lot of new people. The organization of this has gone smoothly so far, except
for the fact that the annoucement/invite never got to the list. After sending
out the first invites to last years goers, and a group of close friends, the
35 spots filled up quickly, we're actually overfilled as far as cabin
occupancy goes.

Another sfraver pointed out that perhaps it shouldn't be called the SFRaves
Cabin Trip because of this, I had to agree. Furthermore, this was never
approved by Brian or any of the others gracious souls that provide us with
this forum. Though undoubtedly, it was their initial dream of this list that
made these trips possible!

Nevertheless, I'm stil very excited about this weekend, and I would love to
see more sfravers joining us at least for snowboarding/skiing on saturday.
(we'll probably go to kirkwood, I will announce on thurs.)

Once again, the cabin trip is full as of now. If you would seriously be
interested in future cabin trips, or you would like me to take your name and
# down in case we have a few people drop out within the next couple days
(possible), send a brief email with your name and ph# to SFouRcabin@aol.com
(sorry can't change the addy name this time around).
Lots o love,
StEvEo
P.S. I would certainly love to see more of these gigs like bbq & beats, cabin
trips, (how about a houseboat trip?). It doesn't take a "production company",
or the motive of profit to throw a party. I think everyone has probably said
"Hey, this would be a great place to throw a party." Well do it! And don't
forget to put me on the invite list, and the volunteer list! :)

Loved it!
One of the top three ambient rooms I've ever been in....thus I spent 98% of
the night there.  Interactive technology being made available to the guests
of the party really has an effect I believe.  I had never experience VR, and
thought it was really fun......and I had also never played that super duper
nintendo extraspecialerific what ever it was either.  I had no idea what I
was supposed to be doing with it, but it was fun to make mario run around
and stuff and trip on the graphics.  It was too hot and crowded for me in
the dance room so I spent less than 10 minutes of the entire night in there.
Same with the halls.  I only ventured out of the amb space when I had to for
what ever reason.  Loved all the music played in the ambient room, and had
fun playing the song I wrote last week for Omar.  Eric and I had a blast
playing our set, and I got to hear a new song he just made for the first
time.  I was really stoked on it.  Sometimes it's good not to
practice....adds an element of suprise :)  The jam session with Randy and
Steve(?)  was cool as well.  The only thing the amb room was missing was
carpet or comfortable seating....which really adds to the ambience if
available.  

Thanks Harmony for the wonderful party, and the opportunity to play our
tunes.  See ya at the next one.

Rick

"Let me have silence always in the centre of the shouting, that is
essential. Let me have silence so that no pin may drop and not be
heard, and not a whisper. Escape us for all our spouting, nor the
needle scratching upon this gramophone of the circular cosmic spot.
Hear me, mark me, learn me, throw the mind's ear open. Shut up the
mind's eye, all will be music. What sculpture of sound cannot, what
cannot as a fluid token words, that nothing else cannot."

I have only received nine votes so far, far from concensus.  So I ask again,

Please, please respond.  Just a word to me is all I ask.  All you lurkers on

Many thanks.

SteveO was the organizer, same as last year.  He took it off of the list to
avoid the scheduling nightmare that occured last year.  He just posted
something about it this morning.  He had good intensions, and I know he was
planning to give an open call to the list, but he wanted to contact the
people who went last year, and those he knew would send thier checks right
away.  Once he did that, it filled up almost instantly.  There was no chance
to post openly to the list.  I'm sure there will be more of these throuout
the snow season, and I'm hoping that the next one will be strictly first
come first serve and what not.  I've been pondering the idea of looking for
a really big space that could accomodate 100 or more so we could do it big
time, but these are only thoughts at this point.  100 people with 100
different checks....needed in advance is a massive undertaking that I don't
know if I'm ready for.  If you can, meet us up on the slopes for some
snowboarding on Saturday.  Steve's going to post something to the list about
it later in the week.

"Let me have silence always in the centre of the shouting, that is
essential. Let me have silence so that no pin may drop and not be
heard, and not a whisper. Escape us for all our spouting, nor the
needle scratching upon this gramophone of the circular cosmic spot.
Hear me, mark me, learn me, throw the mind's ear open. Shut up the
mind's eye, all will be music. What sculpture of sound cannot, what
cannot as a fluid token words, that nothing else cannot."

[ to sfraves ]

 Has anyone tried the 3MU freeware emulation of the TB-303 ? It's 
described at this URL:

http://www.modeemi.cs.tut.fi/~jams/3MU/

 and the source and binaries ( for DEC Alpha, Sun Sparc, Amiga, and Linux )
are at:

http://www.modeemi.cs.tut.fi/~jams/3MU/download.html

 as are some great sounding example files ( sun .au files; mono 8-bit 8kHz 
 mu-law ).

 I downloaded and uncompressed the source , but all the comments are
in Finnish! And the developers stress that it's a beta version still.
But, like I said, the samples sound great!

Larry Ching / larryc@netcom.com

PS - Any other software synths out there that folks would recommend? I'd prefer
     something that works on a Mac, but mention PC based ones too. I've 
     already heard about PC-303 via this list.

Hello sfraves,

        Well I talked to Omar a little bit yesterday, and boy was he
emotional! He was very upset that he could not make it to the party. He
tried everything to get out of the hospital, but nope, not yet! He did get
to watch the party on the "Wrinkle Cam" and said it made him feel a lot
better to do at least that. But still he wanted to come really bad...

        He said, "thank you" to everyone that came out to support him, and
was very surprised when I told him the number of people that where there. In
the end we raised about $5000 for him. (After expenses) He is very greatful,
as are we! Omar can't wait to come to the next party. In fact, he is already
making plans! Hopefully he can come to "Freaky People."

        So, anyways, a big thank you from Harmony to you, for the continued
support you have given us as well as Omar. It really means a lot! So take
care and we'll see you next time!

Peace, love and harmony to all!!!

Greg =)

 Can someone please shed some light on this event?

 What I gathered is that it was a sort of benefit for someone, and you
had a cu-cme cam at the event as well?

 Very interesting.... would like to hear more please.

will have something to talk about for once. Hah.
And I would if I could, Go up on stage and talk about it to everyone with a
microphone. But god wouldn't that be boring @ a party. =]
I will E-Mail private on that though. Becouse I wanna try to respect the
wishes for low bandwith stuff.
I am sure most of my E-Mail gets deleted anywho'z.

But I love you all. k?
Jeff
P.S.  Anyone thats knows me from the ravE. And knows what I am talking
about. Like anyone of the guys at the ravE that think. I "Think I am so
cool" Or any of the ladies at the ravE that think. I "am a stuck up dingle
berry".. I sure would like to hear from you.
 My number is:

Nike jacket with light reflecting dots on the back, and a light reflecting
zipper in the front. Silver mirror alian sunglasses on my head.

Just got to wondering last night, for no particular reason, I wonder who the
youngest person subscribed to sfraves is?  How old are you young 'uns out
there?  I know there are people at least 16, but anybody much younger than
that?  Any outright kids?  And how bout the oldest?  I'd be curious to see
what our real age-span is.

Just wanted to tell all of you what an incredible thing the Harmony

accident after BM, and to know that all of you are doing so much for
him, is an incredible blessing. You truly all have your hearts in the

It makes sense...I myself personaly have not taken that much of it. But I do have to say that
some makes me feel as if I were happily tired (kinda like if I was high on Sugar) and some of it
makes me feel sick. I dunno ( I guess it depends on what you get doesn't it? )... 
Anyhow, I just wanted to say that personaly I don't like calling it 'pot' or 'marijuana'...

how about calling it "PIZZA" :)

I agree. 
The first time I took shrooms I was doing "Pizza" as well (I guess you would call it Pizza with Mushrooms) ;)
so I didn't really know what was what... but I do know that I felt extra hyper and was dancing to no music. 
(odly enough) the second time I did shrooms (leftovers from the week before) I didn't do too much, I was at a 
Mozart Symphony and it was sooo boring I decided to eat the shroom I had in my backpack. After that I went to
a dance club and started to trip. No hallucinations or anything but I do believe that I was thinking everyone 
was an alien and I was shooting them with my pager...and I also remember hiding under the tables at the club.
(Obviously a very ambarrasing experience ;P). I did feel like if I had eaten some bad food or something... but
the feeling went away withing a day or so.

I didn't do that much Acid...but the little I did I loved. Once again I did it at
a club (no comments please ;P) I didn't hallucinate (or I really can't say if I did)
but I do remember the place being lit up, a lot of color, a lot of lights, everyone
was happy, I was happy and hyper, I was dancing, chatting, I was having a lot of fun...
but then, it all disappeared. :o(

E ! E! I would have to say that "E" has been the most wonderful thing I've ever taken.
it made me feel like a baby (and talk like one for some odd reason) and it made me feel
really good. I did it at "Wrinkle in Time" my first 'party' and my first time on "e". I really
really enjoyed it. It was as if  it had taken a 'mask' away from me..it was just me and myself.
I was happy, nothing was wrong, I talked to everyone, it made my day completely. It was just
great... and I agree with you about the men who can't admire a woman for being pretty without wanting to have 
her. but then...I find women gorgeous withouht wanting them...the reason (nevermind it).

Anyhow, maybe I should add one more little thiny to this list...since its something I tried with some
white-trash friends of mine ;o) (just kidding guys).

MINI-THINS:
Some funky pills you can buy at the liquior store they are meant for those who have ashtma or whatever
and they open up your brochial cavity or whatever.. (I'm not a doctor guys ;P) Anyhow,
just wanted to say what I experienced with it...

I took about 6pills...(which is good enough you don't really need more) and what I felt was tingly. My
entire body felt really really tingly.. my hair felt like as if it was 'flying' you know, like 'static'.
it was a nice feeling... I also noticed that touching other people, petting things, etc felt really really 
nice. me and my friends were petting each others legs and arms all night.. and cuddling and such it felt 
very very nice... it does kinda have two effects though...if you sit and enjoy the high you feel tired as if 
you were high on 'pizza'...yet if you stand and walk around or dance you get hyper...weird effect. but nice.

here comes the bad part...
After I came down...I completely felt like SH*T for the next 2 days... it was hell. the feeling it just 
horrible. It made me feel sick..really sick kinda nauseous but not really (and that doesn't make sense does 
it) it was just not nice. I guess I would have to do 'em again to really describe it better ;) the bad feeling 
could also have been lack'o'sleep :o.

Anyhow...that was fun :)

I would definitely say Sunday cause that way people can just go to work
on Tuesday and say: I got sick over the weekend...

If it was on Thrusday on the other hand, then then people would have to
ask for Fri off so that they could re-gain energy or whaever and their
bosses would think that they just wanted a 3 day weekend ;)

	No, you don't. He was hit badly while asleep in his tent by
someone who was NOT candyflipping at Burning Man over Labor Day. He might 
tell you the rest if you ask him when he is out and about again, and after 
he asks someone because I doubt he will remember that morning.

I don't think we should let ourselves get levelled off and beaten down
by the possibility that these experiences are 'subjective,' as if this
somehow discounted them.  I always try to remember that experiences
like these are profoundly transformative and indicative of a psyche in
the process of transformation and growth...the "hero's journey" that
Joseph Campbell talks about is something that is found in all cultures
from all times and the postmodern encounter with aliens may be just our
incarnation of this universal, human-transformative process.  Often
times this process is one of learning how to reach out with love rather
than recoil in fear.  I can certainly relate to that myself.  Shamans,
poets, great thinkers, musicians, lovers-these are co-created with
experiences like those McKenna and Campbell talk about, and I'll be the
first to stand up and defend anything which creates more of these,
whether or not it stands up to the (dubious) scrutiny of 'objective
analysis.'  


What is reality?  Is it what you live, or is it what someone else tells
you it is?  I'd opt for the former.  I think what is real are the
phenomena of our existence.  Therefore, I think there was no reality
before I was born, and that there will be none after I'm gone.  Reality
is what happens in between those two portals, and that includes dreams,
visions, religious experiences or whatever phenomena I encounter as I
live.  I believe that imagination is key to transformation on personal,
tribal and societal levels, and I also believe that our age's
pre-occupation with rational empiricism is anathema to imagination. 
This world IS enchanted.  We all know it everytime we come together at
a great gathering like F&F or Harmony.  I know it when I spend time
alone in the wilderness.  And as children I think we all knew it too,
before indoctrination into consensus reality...which I see as nothing
other than the lowest common denominator among the phenomena of human
existence.  We owe ourselves more than that. 


Chaos theory (http://www.ccs.fau.edu/ccs.html) and non-Cartesian
Cognitive Science
(http://www.cogs.susx.ac.uk/users/ronaldl/noncartesian.html#exis),
especially the work of Walter Freeman (http://sulcus.berkeley.edu/)
point toward this existential-phenomenological conception of reality,
and to a non-reductionist, post-Cartesian way of doing science itself,
one which eliminates the Cartesian objective/subjective distinction and
the air of superiority which one encounters among many of its
practitioners and adherents.  Fractals surround us in nature and in the
music we rave to, in who we are as part of our culture and in art and
mathematics.  All this points to a holism, one which must be taken at
face value and one which might resist rational explanation.  I think
we're only beginning to understand the connections between art and
science, and partly because we are begining to see them I think the
future holds great hope for the re-enchantment of the world.  It's all
up to us as individual members within our communities to be true to the
phenomena of our experience and to live our lives accordingly, and to
stand up to what 'they' say and stand apart from what 'they' do when
appropriate.

I've been feeling particularly sensitive about my age recently; I was
never one of those kids who lied about their age but now I never want to
say what I am at all. This is because, well, it's my first year at school
and people always ask me, "So, is this your first year?" 
To which I am obliged to reply, "Yeah, but I took a year off." So this is
my earth shattering confession. Youth courses through my veins! WooHoo!
This is perhaps why I post so goddamn much.
But anyway, I had also been wondering about the relative age thing on this
list. Is there anyone younger than 19? Or 18? (that general period of
-flowering-).

I have never had someone close to my die.  After Charity <October 4>  I
got in touch with Omar's mom to make arrangements to give her the money
we raised for her.  As the situation were, I arranged to meet her at the
hospital and get the opportunity to see/ say hi to Omar.  I didn't know 
Omar too well before burning man.  I had talked to him on numerous
occasions, but I can't say that he was a close friend of mine.  I did,
however, after seeing him at the hospital get to talk at length with his
mom.  She and I talked and/or cried for over an hour after I had said my
good byes to Omar.

My point is this:

The whole experience of talking with Jolene (Omar's mom) and visiting
Omar was an overwhelmingly sobering experience.  You know, we all, and I
do mean EVERY one of us takes what we have for granted.  Our life, our
health, our well being.  The only way we can ever come to truly
appreciate anything is if we loose it or are threatened with loosing
it.  We all go out and party all night and take all kinds of drugs and
do all kinds of crazy things (well some of us do anywayz), and we all
think that we are immortal, but we ignore the fact that something
drastic could happen to any one of us at any time.  It might not be our
fault.  It might not be preventable.  It might not be predictable.  But
it could happen to you, and it could happen to me.  

So should we all lock ourselves up in our homes and close the blinds and
never go outside cuz we might get hurt?  No, of course not.  However:::
Take time today, to tell the people you love how you feel.  Call your
parents.  Call your grandparents.  Call your sister or your brother. 
Call your friend that you haven't talked to in a couple of years.  CAll
them all and tell them just that you love them.  Because when or if
something happens, You will be saying to yourself< "I never told them
how I really felt.  If I could only have five minutes more... etc."  


After I got back to my car at Omar's hospital, I just laid my head down
on the stearing wheel and cried.  I cried like I haven't in a very long
time.  After I had got home and told my friends how Omar was (they were
all asking)  I went to the house of an old friend I had not been close
to in a long time, but still and always will have a close place in my
heart.  I told her that I love her.   I then went to my parent's house. 
They were just finishing a late dinner.  I told them that I love them
and that I thought they did a great job of providing me with the
adequite tools for conquering the world.  I then went to my grandparents
house.  They weren't home, but I broke into their house and stuck a note
on their fridge that said: "I love you both very much... your grandson
Adam".  

Appreciate what you have... Tell those people in your life that you love
them.  Cherish every moment of your life as if it were your last.  Only
then will we begin to understand what is truly important in our lives. 
It's not the posessions, the cars, or the daily mundane stuff that fills
up 99% of our lives.  The truly important things in life are those who
love you, and those who you love.  

I've said my piece.

Peace, Love, Unity and Respect, everybody.

--Adam--

I have often wondered the same thing.  A lot of people I see at parties look 
awfully young but I just attribute that to poor lighting and youthful genes.

I tried to subscribe for six months before my 16th birthday but somehow could 
not spell subscribe right (this from a spelling bee winner, huh! it was 
frustrating) and so, consequently could not subscribe.  I finally figured out my 
spelling error a little after my 16th birthday, but that was two years ago so 
I'm sure I am no longer among the youngest.

 Pinky and the Brain need your help.  In order for them to take over the
 world, you must send this letter to at least five other people. While
 they are reading this message Pinky and the Brain will be tying their
 shoe laces to the chair, and soon the entire population will be stuck at
 their computers.  If you do this simple task for the Brain he may spare
 you after his conquest.

------->Kiss someone you love when you get this letter and make magic. With
love, all things are possible. This paper has been sent to you for good
luck. The original is in New England. It has been around the world nine
times. This luck has been sent to you.
You will recieve good luck within four days of recieving this letter and you
must, in turn, send luck. This is no joke, send NO money. Send copies to
people you think need luck. Don't send money as fate has no price. Do not
keep this letter. It must leave your hand within 96 hours. A Pan Am officer
recieved $470,000. Joel Elliot recieved $70,000 and lost his wife because he
broke the chain. While in the Philippines,Can Walch lost his wife six days
after recieving this letter, he failed to circulate the letter. However,
before her death, he recieved $7,775. Please send 20 copies and see what
happens in four days. The chain comes from Venezuela and was written by Saul
Anthony Degroup, missionary from South America. Since the copy must tour the
world you must make 20 copies and send them to friends and associates. After
a few days, you will get a suprise. This is true. Even if you are not
superstitious. Do note the following. Constantine Dias recieved the letter
in 1953. He asked his secretary to make 20 copies and send them out. A few
days later he won the lottery of $2,000,000.
Cario Banddit an office employee, recieved the letter and forgot it had to
leave his hands within 96 hours. He lost his job. Delan Fairchild recieved
the chain, and not believing, threw the letter away. Nine days later, he
died. In 1987, the letter was recieved by a young woman in California. It
was faded and barely readable. She promised herself that she would re-type
the letter and send it out, but she put it aside. She was plagued with
various problems. The letter did not leave her hands within 96 hours. She
finally re-typed the letter as promised and got a new car. Send NO money. Do
not ignore this letter. It works.

        Saint Jude<------------------


I hate these damn chain letters. And I don't believe in them at all, but for
those of you who do, this may mean something to you. I'm actually against
organized religion, and therefor I'm against this pushing of beliefs on
others, forcing them to spread the word of an idiot. 

        I'm sending this just for your enjoyment, laugh. . . funny huh???

Many thanks to those of you who sent me in your votes for the day of the FNB
benifit.

The tally at this time:  

        22 Thursday                     8 Sunday

(... and a few with mixed feelings)

You can still send me your preferences, as our general meeting is not until
Thursday, where I will inform FNB.

Thanks to those of you who offered to help.  It brings a smile to my face to
know there is support in the rave community.  I will contact each of you
individually, if I haven't yet already.  

I'll let everybody know details as things get confirmed and the planning
process starts rolling.

Peace, love, and good food,
Kerry

Hi all!

 Just wanted to let some of you kind folks out there know (especially 
those Santa Cruz ravers) that there is a new weekly starting up at 
Palookaville in Santa Cruz. It is called Ascendance and I'm NOT 
associated with these folks at all (yet ;). I just wanted to mention it 
as my pal and perhaps favorite DJ (Greg Sandler) will be spinning on 
12/5/96. Other DJs include Garth, Spun, John Howard and live, Astral Matrix.

 Unfortuantely the shows only run from 9pm to 2am, but that is better 
than what we used to get in downtown SC.

 Call 408.429.2330 for more info.

peas y'all,

know of other web authoring progs? or good places to get web page 
art/utils/ ect...

Dear SFRavefriends,

	My comments are interspersed with David's below...

My computer tells me that on Tue, 19 Nov 1996, David Ginsberg shared:

	I'm all in favor of transformative experiences, but that doesn't
mean that everything someone experiences therein should be taken with the
same sense of assurance with which one greets the news that one's car has
been towed.
	After listening to a long soliloquy by Terrence McKenna at the
Shamen concert at the Warfield in '94 (?), I realized that he makes a
great sample, but very little sense.
	I'm a poet and a lover, and I aspire to be a great thinker and
maybe a musician someday -- does this mean I should ignore the knowledge
humans have gained about reality and the way the world works over
countless generations, and my own empirical experience, in favor of
believing someone who tells me they were recently abducted by aliens?

	If Dave is right, we better all hope he has a long, long life
ahead of him.

	I guess it depends how you define reality.  That's a tricky one.
If I dream that I meet David and have a conversation with him, I believe
that the dream was real for me, but not real in the sense that actually
meeting him somewhere for a cup of coffee would have been real.  I don't
expect him to remember it the next day, because it never happened for him,
only for me.  If something happens inside my mind and is perceptible only
to me, I think we need to draw a division between this event and others
which are external to me.  Calling them both "reality" as if there were no
difference between them only serves to muddle our meaning and weaken
language as a tool for communication between people, imho.

	Tell that to someone like Isaac Asimov!

	I hate arguing against romantic ideas, because I'm a romantic
myself despite believing in a common reality.  But there's no Santa Claus
in the sense in which Virginia asked the question (there's not really a
man who spends Christmas Eve flying around in a sleigh delivering gifts)
even if he can be said to exist in the spirit of human generosity on some
level.
	We have the subjective ability to experience the world as a
magical, enchanted place, and I'm sure glad we do, or life would be rather
boring.  But acknowledging a common reality can be wonderful as well.  It
allows us to have beautiful experiences together, instead of just on our
own.  If we can't even achieve consensus on reality, how can we hope to
achieve consensus on anything else?

	This air of superiority may also be found among many people who
profess that there is no such thing as reality.  Even when you allegedly
don't believe in right and wrong, correct and incorrect, it is
surprisingly easy to talk as if there is no possibility but that you are
right, as I discovered while having a dicussion similar to this with an
ex-girlfriend.  8)

	Why must this be taken at face value?  Isn't it part of the beauty
of humanity that we are constantly curious, seeking to fully understand
and grasp the wonders with which we come into contact?
	Sometimes I get the feeling that there is a hope among many that
certain "mysteries of life" will continue to defy rational explanation.
But this is a needless hope -- individually, most of us will never
understand the workings of an internal combustion engine, let alone the
nature of the universe, so why begrudge the possibility of that knowledge
to humanity as a whole?

	Quite so.  But I maintain that one of these appropriate times is
when someone like Terrence McKenna claims that the world is ending in
2012.  But if we make the language mallable enough, of course he could be
corrrect -- just like if we say that Santa Claus exists, black is white,
night is day, there is no racism today, and driving a BMW is the key to
happiness, we could be correct too -- if we use imaginative definitions.
	The reality of having different subjective experiences of the
same reality shouldn't blind us from recognizing that that reality
exists, even if none of us see it quite the same.  
	PLUR stands for peace, love, UNITY and respect. Where's the unity
if there's nothing real to experience together?

Much love,

Dear SFRavefriends,

	I think to make this truly spooky, the number 23 would have to
play a significant part.  ;)

Subject: WKND CABIN TRIP (open invite)
Sender: sfraves-owner@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

A couple people have had to drop out on this weekend's CABIN/RAVE/SNOWBOARD
trip, so it looks like there will be 3-4 spots that have opened up afterall.
A portion of the original invite is below (sorry so long). PLEASE be sure to
read it all and make sure you will be able to go, if you're definitely up for
it, reply as shown at bottom to SFouRcabin@aol.com, asap. Since there are
only a couple spots, so I can't guarantee anything. Sorry for the confusion.
************************************************
Some might recall last spring's CABIN TRIP.  I believe it was common
consensus among the goers, that it went well, very well, very VERY well. From
Moonpup's 10 hour set in his birthday suit, to the communal dinner, to
tribalistic toning in the spa, to a wonderous performance by RE.  This was a
weekend of participation, family, and undescribeably good vibes.
Well it's an even bigger & better space, and with your help, more smiles,
more toys, more music, more love.
There is a catch.  Because this is a kind of "project", rather than a party,
It requires your participation, input and help. The bottom of this letter
tells how to get signed up, but it important to read this whole post, it
contains everything you need to know about The CABIN TRIP.
*************************************
*"What is it?": A weekend of fun, friendship, music, etc. at a massive cabin
in the mountains
*"Where is it?": So. Lake Tahoe (mountaneous, very woody, has a big big
beautiful lake, & possibly some snow. It's about 3 Hrs from the bay area)
*"When is it?": It looks like wknd of Nov. 22nd is going to work best for
most of us.  If I get a huge response that contradicts this, it might change.
 The fun will last the entire weekend.
*"Whos going?" Last Years group of 27 was incredible. Each person filled a
role essential to the whole. Most of us had never met, yet relationships
formed that remain growing today, (e.g. the one with the most special person
in my life right now).  Nevertheless, each experience should be lived in the
present for what it is. I hope to see as many new faces as familiar ones.
 1st invites go out to last years cabin goers (SFRavers), and a small list of
very special sfravers & other friendlies that are just born to be
cabin-goers. (See the "To:" field of this post) Also anyone who gets this is
of course welcome to invite your kin. After a week, if not filled, I'll send
an open invite to the list (sfraves) for remaining spots.  IMPORTANT, see
"Well sign me up" to guarantee a spot. 
*"A Cabin Eh?":  Last year we had a 2600 sq ft, 3 story home with a lakeview,
a huge living room. a rec room with a spa and a sauna, and was remodeled in a
lovely suburban nordic viking motif.  This years spot is a 5 bdm 4,000 sq
foot beauty, spa, game room (w/pinball,pool table, etc), solarium, massive
sun deck, view, intercom, yadayadayada. There will be a sunny "study room"
for your inconvenience.

*"MUSIC?":  Rick riffle is coordinator of sound/music. If you would like to
spin or have equip to bring let him know [rdriffle@ucdavis.edu]. The line-up
will be loose at best, but pleasure for your ears guaranteed.

*"YEAH BUT HOW MUCH?": It should be around $25, that includes pitching in
some $ for DAT tapes

"WHAABOUT FOOD?": Pot luck for Sat night dinner, aside from that, bring what
you need & some to share. There's a safeway nearby. 

"BUT WHAT ON EARTH WOULD WE DO FOR FUN? 
OUTDOOR: If my prayers are answered it will snow like mad and we'll be
boarding, skiing, sledding, making snow angels.
INDOOR: Duh.  Rave rave rave, hot tubbing! rave rave rave, fireside family
dinner!, rave rave rave, build bed sheet forts!, rave rave rave, twister!,
rave rave rave, and then of course there's my favorite multiple person indoor
sport...   pillow fights!;) Be sure to BRING ANYTHING you can to add to the
fun; games, toys, art, drums, synths, etc.
"WHAABOUT THE WEATHER?": It's bee raining up there, but there will be snow at
higher elevations. Having chains would be a very good idea but probably not
necc.

"WELL SIGN ME UP!"
Please try to give as definite of an answer as soon as possible. Look at your
calender, and have anyone you would like to go look at theirs.  Once you've
decided you really want to go, and can afford it, then reply (-text) to
SFouRcabin@aol.com, dont hit reply to this message. Be sure and include the
following info in the following order:

ANSWER    EMAIL (NAME)    PH#    ME+# ppl you'ld like to go(name(s) After
that, let me know if you would like to help or contribute in any department

This is a SAMPLE RESPONSE:

Well I happen to be rather new (Which could be one reason why you have
probably never seen me before and the fact that I subscribed yesterday)
But I am 17, please don't tell me I  am the youngest. There has to be
someone else out there.

...Hey....don't think that being the youngest is a problem cause I'm close
to being the oldest!!

   Although I know that Capt Crunch is older than me, and I always respect
my elders.  I just had my 45th birthday, and have been on the list since 93'.

My point was certainly not to elevate "subjective experience" above "the
knowledge humans have gained about reality," and it should be clear from
what I wrote that I wouldn't recommend you believing in (whatever that
means) someone's report of their alien abduction - my point is simply that
you shouldn't discount YOUR OWN experiences, too which I'd add I don't
think you should flat out deny those of others.  I don't deny the
usefullness of science (or I wouldn't be studying it), but at the same time
I recognize that science yields just one type of knowledge - which cuts
linear paths into something nonlinear and will always be incomplete and
contradictory (Starchild I suggest you read some Kuhn!) - and that there
are other ways of knowing which may not stand up to the requirements of
objectivity which science strives for but which may nonetheless be valuable
in their own right and in some cases (those where it involves meaning) may
even take precedence over scientific knowledge.

Of course there are distinctions between dreaming of doing something and
doing something.  This is trivial and uninteresting.  But to think that
only what is objectively verifiable is real denies the reality of colors
(there is NO objective baisis for measuring color, not wavelength, not
reflectance, not brightness, not some amalgam of them - none, and this is a
problem for your point of view Starchild).  Of course you're free to accept
that there is nothing such as color, and just think in terms of some
objectively quantifiable variable like reflectance, but the candlefeet of
the light reflecting off a sheet of white paper in the moonlight is lower
than that off a charcoal piece of paper in daylight, yet you and I would
both agree that the paper is white.  It's difficult to get beyond the
Cartesian dualism we've inherited.  We talk in terms of "inner" and
"outter" and it all makes perfect sense.  But what I'm saying is that when
you're true to the phenomena of your experience, you might find it
difficult to make such distinctions.  You see, meaning appears to be
embodied in the brain in the form of what we're now calling attractors, and
the patterns which arise when the cortices settle into basins of attraction
express relations between the organism and its milieu.  These relations are
not inner and they're not outter...they are holistic, and this is what we
are and this is what reality, most primordially, can mean.  This meaning
structure, this set of potentialities for action, is the basis of
intelligibility and as such is prior to objective knowledge.  Sure, science
is getting at something, but how we see it and what it means to us is based
upon this background of understanding which we get as we act in the world
and become enculturated.  I'd even grant that in some cases maybe science
is finding truly objective facts about the universe - "carving nature at
her joints" - but I also think we'd never know for sure.  It's difficult to
get beyond Cartesian dualistic thinking...such thinking has become embedded
in our language over the past 400 years and we use such language on an
everyday basis, but such thinking leads to all sorts of conundrums like
mind/body, realism/irrealism, inner/outter, all of which can be avoided by
sticking close to the phenomena.  When you use the term reality Starchild,
I think you have something like the universe in mind.  But ask
yourself...on the basis of what do you understand that universe and was it
there before you understood it, and if so, in what sense?  What does it
mean to say that something IS?  And can anything BE without the being for
whom it appears as a phenomenon?  Does being make sense if you use the term
this way?  And how would you propose to separate being from intelligibility?

I'm not sure why you wrote this.  I'm certainly not arguing against
consensus reality or saying that we should ignore it - far from it, as
should have been clear from my closing comment "to stand up to what 'they'
say and stand apart from it when appropriate".  I'm simply saying that as
the lowest common denominator we shouldn't make it (or anything you or I or
anyone else says) our god, that we should remain open to the possibility of
a richer, fuller existence, and most of all that we should be true to
ouselves in the sense of honoring the phenomena of our experience.

I agree completely with the first sentence and study science because I
think it does uncover something which the "new mysterians" would like to
believe will remain concealed.  As far as complete and certain knowledge, I
think it's impossible because each domain of science (or any other way of
knowing) is cutting a linear path through something with more dimensions
than that.  Each gives a perspective on the whole, but only a perspective.

I agree here too.  Of course the term 'world' in our language signifies a
cultural phenomenon.  We say the world of sports and the world of politics
and the world of art.  We talk about possible world and the world of Greek
theater and the world of the 21st century.  World means something like
domain, not the rocky wet planet we stand upon, and this is important to
keep in mind when trying to understand what McKenna is talking about.  I've
read several of his books, and I think he's certainly on the lunatric
fringe, but his stuff about the end of the world comes from Mayan culture
and the world for the Mayans is the human cultural world, just as it is for
us.  It may be that the world of these last 400 or so years is coming to an
end - every other world has - this only history will tell.  But he's
certainly not talking about armageddon or the end of everything in some
Christian sense.

And the reality which we can come to consensus on shouldn't blind one to
richness of the phenomena of one's own existence, nor should it be used to
diminish or demean those phenomena for others.  Where's the peace and love
without RESPECT?

with respect,

You know...If I never see another chain letter again, it wouldn't be soon 
enough.  Why pollute a list with such garbage?  I don't want to 
participate in that crap.  If you receive one and really feel like 
sending it to someone, just send it to people you know -- not to me!

I'm sure other people feel this, but I just had to say something.  This 
list has a high enough volume that I have a hard time keeping up with it 
(too busy).  Stuff like this has NOTHING to do with raves, but is far 
beyond an NRR label.  It really has no social or political relevance.  I 
really think it has no place on this list.

Blah, blah, blah,

        I feel kinda bad about it being my last teenage year, but that's
OK. I always thought that 19 was the birthday when "nothing happens"
(21:alcohol 20:second decade 18:tobacco & pornography =P 19:???) but boy oh
boy was I wrong, thanks to greg and matt and caryn and dan and randy and
all the rest who put together last weekends rager (I partied so hard I
actually made myself sick, but I feel MUCH BETTER NOW =)

Judging by the list members I've met, I'd say we're DEFINITELY the kids
around here, but it seems like no one cares... I mean, where else would you
find a person my age hanging out with someone like Leslie, who has CHILDREN
my age???

hope to meet you and all SFRKids one day,

Sorry - but one of the most beautiful things about the rave scene is the
ONE - we all move, love and shine together.  And hopefully help to join
together.

Since I believe this sight is dominated by like minded people, I feel it
is my best spot to do this.  

I am moving from Santa Barbara to the Bay area to start or join a
sparkin-edge multimedia development company - WEB stuff, enhanced
CDs...  Originally from the Chicago House scene.  Major business
experience, BSEECS, MBA.  I Own THE Fat daddy MAC with the shit. Looking
to do stuff similar to Mushroom Jazz (OM Records).  I am trying to avoid
the dog & pony with the human resource gatekeeper wanks and the major
corporate suit scene.

Anyone interested or know of openings?

On Mondays I tend to be 24, Tuesdays thru Thursdays I bounce around
between 21 and 35. I know most weekends Leslie and I prefer to be
somewhere between 18 and 20. It's true.

Subject: So There I Was,      <NRR>
Sender: sfraves-owner@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

So there I was, hanging out in Leicester Square, waiting on Nigel and
Beanbag to show up.  I was broke and hungry and cold, and to make matters
worse, my drawers were soaking wet from the rain.

Nigel had told me to meet him at the pub because he had some information
about a kid named Truffles who was in the tank in Holland.  Truffles was
busted for some passport problem, and he'd left 20,000 Es in a locker at
the ferry terminal in Rotterdam.

Nigel had the scoop on the locker number, and he was going to tell me how
to pop the door open and snag the Es before Truffles got out of the tank.

So it was pouring rain when Nigel and Beanbag show up, and we go inside the
pub for a warmer and to talk about the crime.

"Please don't go along with this stupid plan, Boomerang!"  Beanbag tried to
tell me.  "Truffles never did anything to hurt you.  Why should you go all
the way to Holland to pinch a bunch of Es from someone who's never done
anything to you?"

Beanbag wasn't too hip on the idea, she had all these wonderful things to
say about karma and respect and what she's learned on the rave circuit.
But me and Nigel, we're incoorigible hooligans, right nasty bastards when
you think about it.  Besides, we both know that raves aren't about nothing
but scoring money and Es and maybe a bird to bring home to the sack.

So when Beanbag started putting up a fuss, Nigel told her to cram it and
sent her up to the bar for 3 pints.  While she was gone we got down to
business:   Truffles had left Amsterdam with 20,000 Es, and stuffed them in
a locker at the ferry port in Rotterdam, just to keep it cool while he was
waiting for the boat back home.  Well, he ran into some trouble with the
coppers, and when his passport didn't check out,  they stuck him in the can
for a couple of weeks. He'd called home for help, and pretty soon word got
around about the Es in locker number 715.

Since I was broke, Nigel told me to beat it on down to the dockyards and
get to guffing with one of the sailors, see if I could swing a ride across
the channel to Rotterdam in the hold of a boat.

Nigel, nasty poof that he is, didn't have the decency to lend me 10 quid
for carfare down to the docks, so I had to nick a motorbike from Covent
Garden, which I properly rolled into the Thames when I was finished with
it.

Down at the docks, I got to chatting with a lad named Bill,  he was a
rugged old meathead, teeth all rotten from snorting too much nitrate.  The
old lunk worked on one of the boats, said he could stow me in the hold and
take me over to Rotterdam.  All he wanted in return, he said, was was a
little bit of company now and again.

Well, it wasn't until my first night in the hold that I figured out what he
meant by "company".  I'd got to thinking he wanted to guff it up about
football scores and such, but on no, my friends.  Bill showed up in the
hold that night, eyelids a-fluttering and ready for company.  I put up my
dukes and was ready to fight my way through hell and high water, but old
Bill threatened to yell for the captain and if I didn't loosen up.

Let me tell you, friends, I went through five days of hell, being tossed
about by the waves during the day, and tossed about by old Bill at night.
The man was a frightful savage, committing the most uncivilised acts
imaginable on my poor body.  I'm not much of a softy, but by my third day,
I was in tears at the very thought of my next visit from Bill.  Sometimes
got to thinking I should have listened to Beanbag when she warned me about
karma and all that happy bollocks.

My only consolation was the promise of those 20,000 Es in locker #715.
20,000 Es could last me quite a long time,  and thinking about ripping off
that poor sop Truffles made my suffering manageable.

On the fifth night in the hold of the rusty old vomit-bucket, the door
swung open and I braced myself from another onslaught from sailor Bill.
Instead, there in the door, was the Captain himself.

"Keeping company for that scalawag Bill, are ya, lad?"

"Please, sir,"  I begged.  "Don't send me back to London.  I need to get to
Holland by the end of the week.  I have important business there, and Bill
promised me a ride."

"Holland, eh?  Ahh, that old pirate!"  the captain smiled knowingly.  "I
supposed he neglected to mention that this here vessel is a charter barge
running up and down the River Thames!"

>I think we're only beginning to understand the connections between art and
>>science,

hey everyone,

 I noticed that this came up once or twice recently, so

if anyone is interested there is a very worthwhile book called "the artfull
eye" (Oxford U. Press) which is brand new and very, very good (IMO) and it
is right on this subject.

 It specifically is all about understanding art, has cool sections about
"chemical dreams", is pretty readable (at least on comparison to most books
published by universities... ).

The authors are world class cognitive scientists who are really insightful
into a wide spectrum of neat stuff <<like aesthetics/ cognitive science/
art history/episomology/psychology/psycho-pharmacology>> and teach you all
about the vision+your brain+how its wired +  how & why it does what it
does...

so, if your interested in that sort of thing, check it out...

+ tell me how you like it (and if it does anything for your CArtesian anxiety!)

I bought mine at COdy's in Berkeley (telegraph at haste/510 845 7852)


:)

qsip


PS. has anyone out there read a book called "the red queen"? I think its
about darwin + evolution

     seestone-
     
     i suggest if you really want to find the perfect job that you invest a 
     little time and effort into reading "Think and Grow Rich" by Napoleon 
     Hill.  There is a chapter specifically aimed toward people trying to 
     get the perfect job.  
     
     Don't focus on whether there's an opening or not, focus on what you 
     can GIVE.  Companies are always looking for a person who knows their 
     own personal strenghts and weaknesses, becuase there are SO FEW.  As 
     far as dress codes with blue-situs and tyedies, many big companies are 
     loosening up their dress code.  Hey, I can even wear my ADIDAS tm  to 
     work at Harris-Farinon!:)
     
     Going by Napoleon's model, which I believe includes preparing a brief 
     to present to the company, you should be able to go to ANY company, 
     big or small and get the job you want.  My advice to you is to start 
     researching companies that you want to work for to find out if you 
     really want to work for them or not.    
     
     help this hopes!

Sorry - but one of the most beautiful things about the rave scene is the 
ONE - we all move, love and shine together.  And hopefully help to join 
together.
     
Since I believe this sight is dominated by like minded people, I feel it 
is my best spot to do this.  
     
I am moving from Santa Barbara to the Bay area to start or join a 
sparkin-edge multimedia development company - WEB stuff, enhanced 
CDs...  Originally from the Chicago House scene.  Major business
experience, BSEECS, MBA.  I Own THE Fat daddy MAC with the shit. Looking 
to do stuff similar to Mushroom Jazz (OM Records).  I am trying to avoid 
the dog & pony with the human resource gatekeeper wanks and the major 
corporate suit scene.
     
Anyone interested or know of openings?

Greetings all,
Myself, and two other fine individuals (James King, who is on the list, 
and another James who is not - both are excellent, positive people) are 
seeking a 3BR house for rental in the South Bay.  We are looking for 
something in Los Gatos, Saratoga, Cupertino or Willow Glen preferably, 
and anywhere in the surrounding secluded/mountain areas would be even 
better (AKA: Santa Cruz mountains, Los Gatos hills, Cupertino hills, 
etc.)  We are all professionally employed at silicon valley computer 
companies, responsible, and open-minded.  The only factor is that our 
Dream House must be available by 1/1/97.
If you, or anyone you know has anything available, please contact me.  
Any help would be greatly appreciated!!!
Thank you!!!
Happy trails...

We could just put it outside.  I'm sure it's plenty cold enough.  I have to
say I'll be more than stoked if this happens.

"Let me have silence always in the centre of the shouting, that is
essential. Let me have silence so that no pin may drop and not be
heard, and not a whisper. Escape us for all our spouting, nor the
needle scratching upon this gramophone of the circular cosmic spot.
Hear me, mark me, learn me, throw the mind's ear open. Shut up the
mind's eye, all will be music. What sculpture of sound cannot, what
cannot as a fluid token words, that nothing else cannot."

Subject: NRR:Rooms for rent in 3 Bed/2 bath house
Sender: sfraves-owner@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

Looking for housemates for a 3 BR/2 Bath house in San Carlos, which is
about 15-20 minutes south of San Fransisco.
Look at all these great features:
- About 2000 square feet.
- Nice Hillside location
- Wood deck
- Backyard
- Extra family room (music listening/computer room?)
- 2 (possibly 3) car garage
- and lotsa storage!

I am a software engineer at Apple Computer, and a budding DJ. I have used
to do radio shows on KFJC where I would spin an ambeint mix, and did live
events. I also play drums and guitar occaisonally, and would be wanting to
have parties once in a while (not too often; I'm no party animal or
anything). If there is enough interest, I may work on putting wiring in for
a shared Internet connection. Obviously, I would only do this if the costs
were split by everyone.
I would prefer professionals in the computer/technical fields of any
gender, race, age, etc. However, I would like people who also are into
alternative/experimental music since this is what I listen to:
ambient/techno/dub/psychedelia/whatever. Also, anyone with a a sampler or a
pair of Technics SL-1200's gets special brownie points!!
No flakes or drug abusers!! If you fit in this category, I do not want you.
But the bottom-line is I am looking for anyone who is responsible and easy
to get along with.

Available December 5. Hurry!

Rent will be $675/month + last + security deposit.
Contact Doug at 408-974-5913 or 408-972-9177. Or reply to this email.

Anyone here ever hear of a European musician/artist/group
called "Bjork" (pronounced bee-YERK)?  Where can their
music be had?  Not sure if she/they can be called house
music or rave-related, but from what I have heard, it 
is possible, since it really thumped.

Thanks...

Scott

ahh, Bjork..........the love of my life!!  Formerly of the SugarCubes.  
She's got two CD's out : Debut and Post.  I think she's married (or 
engaged) to super jungle star Goldie.

Bjork is a singer from Iceland. Before her solo career
she was with the Sugarcubes. She's really big in Europe now.
If she ever makes it to the West Coast, don't miss her concert.
For me, she's one of the best on stage.
There's a lot of information on the www about her. Check out: 
http://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/music/artists/bj_rk
(a lot of links)
I don't know how to call her music style. It's a mix
of a lot of styles.

Wow, a lot of people here have heard of her!  Yes,
she has an amazing stage presense, and was pretty
awesome when she appeared on The Tonight Show a
while back with Jay Leno, singing "Oh So Quiet".

Her style is very hard to pin down, I agree.
I found one of her CD's at Tower right after I
put the question out to the group.

Thanks....Scott

This annoying Icelandic vocalist is INDEED at least engaged to Goldie (who
opened for her during her last European tour), and rumours circulated early
this summer about her being pregnant.
As far as her music goes, it's not really house or rave-related in original,
however she chose to have big names from the house/techno scene (David
Morales, Todd Terry, LFO, Towa Tei, and a few others) remix most of her back
catalogue earlier this year. Most of the mixes were released as "extremely
limited promos", but still sold in stores like Wherehouse and Virgin. Can we
say "CASH RULES EVERYTHING AROUND ME"? Anyway, LFO did a pretty good job on=
=20
Hyperballad, and if you like Bj=F6rk AND house/techno I suggest you check it=
=20
out. =3D)

Good luck. I searched long and hard for 1200s at that price; but, 
everyone seemed to want $400. I did once hear of a pair with carts and 
Gemini Scratchmaster for $650 but I didn't have any money then. 

I ended up buying new at Guitar Center. I was able to weasle them down to 
$450 after I told them that Az-Iz had quoted me that price (they did) and 
that I was going to be in LA the next week anyway (i wasn't.) Guitar 
Center gave me the old "let me check with my maneger" line, and insisted 
that $450 was below their cost; love that price matching policy. 
Surprised the hell out of me, when the poodle haired rock'n'roll guys 
came up with the best price.

I was just wondering if anyone out there could hook me up with a list of
CD's Mark Farina has put out. I bought Mushroom Jazz cause I liked the
cover and fell in love with the CD. One of my buddy's said he had one
out called Seasons, but a list would be greatly appreciated.

Hey Steve.........Mark Farina is one of my favorite Dj's.  I think this may
be his first 
cd (he has many tapes) but I'm not sure.  I've got the number to get the cd
(seasons). It's 213-644-2751  or 213-644-2753.  If anyone has it, and would
like to tape-trade for something else, let me know. I'd like to get it.

	I did not jump on your post because I felt you were making fun of 
a tradegy. Instead because it was another circulation of rumors. The 
driver was not found to be candy-flipping. I know some of what was found 
but I do not think I am suppose to say anything because I may be called 
as a witness.

	The reason I do not like hearing the story change (although that 
may be inevitable) is more because with the change in story, the facts 
get lost and people forget what happened, or those who were not there 
hear so many different stories, all of the stories are written off as 
rumors. Does anyone know why the jeep rolled off the road when Malachy 
was hurt back when Come-Unity was started? I do not know the reason, but 
I have heard stories from people I trust enough to think they wouldn't be 
talking out of their ass on the subject. Might we benefit from knowing? I 
really do not know. From my experience, issues like this do not change 
people's lives enough - they do for a short time, but over the haul, we 
easily slip back into our comfortable lives.
	Someone talked about telling people they love them now instead of
later... And I look at that and ask why that isn't done regularly, or why
people are acting in such a way that it NEEDS to be communicated. I can
understand telling one's family that because that whole growing up thing
can create a huge gap between family members. Anyway, back to my point.  I
see as temporary stress relief or the individual, but what good is it
going to do unless the underlying problems are fixed?
	Someone wrote that I (since I am part of EVERY one) take my life
for granted, that I take having people around for granted, and that at the
end of the day I must think I am immortal because of the way I act. Yet,
it is the very reason that I am mortal, that at any moment I might be
wiped out or possibly worse might come back totally different even through
no fault of my own, that I dance; it is the energy that wells up from
inside of me from those sources which makes me like the gabber I used to
spin and hopefully will again soon.

just wanted to say HI HO!  from snowy Vancouver BC as i haven't posted to 
you guys much since my life just escaped being sucked down the toilet :)

i've moved in with a DJ who spins mostly ambient which is nice after a 
frantic day at work :)  what a relief to be away from that insane loser i 
WAS living with!

Last weekend i attended an amusing little event in a mansion in Victoria 
... the organizer was this sleezy cheeseball who looked like Michael 
Bolton.  *shudder*  marvelous music, massage tables, nice visuals, fresh 
fruit, and NO VIBE AT ALL!! *sigh*  at least the music KICKED.  someone 
played a great prog. house version of Roadhouse Blues around about 4am 
... and also right about then it begane to SNOW!  so we all built a 
snowman.  it was fun.

But i still miss all of you and realllllly hope to make it back down 
there by late spring/early summer .....

I recently picked up "Seasons One" used at R******s Records on Haight
St for about $9.95. It's out on Domestic Records, distributed by
Moonshine Music, c. 1996.

this is mostly mellow 125 BPM "house" music, nothing to write the
mothership about, but generally "nice" and "pretty"... My favorite cuts
are:
	Downtime by Paper Music
	Past by RMA
	Nu Slow Dub by Tranquil Elephantizer

i don't know what you'd call this kind of music Chicago House, Nu Groove?
Something like that. Might as well make up a name for it so you can
sound all erudite dancing about architecture and talking about music.

Greetings from Tapei!

I guess in order to make this rave related, I have to relate an unusal
experience: The airline actually played Banco De Gaia which was a trip.
Also Dead can Dance.... nifty..

Tapei:

Very lush countryside, very muggy. The highways are in *much* better shape
than in Ca. The city looks like a giant Oakland, unfortunately the bad
parts... lots of ramshackled hi-rise tenaments. Very high density. 

Thousands and thousands of.... scooters. This must be the scooter capital
of the world, they are *everywhere*

I am suprised at just how "U.S. friendly" it is(lots of signs in English,
a lot of the inhabitants speak English.) I have also seen at least two Doc
Marten stores which is weird. Great food, great service, and instead of
napkins everyone gives you warm towels(with it being as muggy as it is you
need them.)

I am going to look for ravers,  anyone know the Chinese words for
"Harmony," or "Friends and Family?" ;-)

Hello,

I just came across a great article about the 1960's Psych*delic Scene
in San Francisco, which illustrates very significant parallels to the
90's SF Rave Scene - even more parallels than I had previously know
about.

The article can be found at:

http://www.rockhall.com/news/sanfran1.html

Be sure to read all four pages!


Cheers,

Ken

Hello Everyone =)
I'm back on this list 'cos I need to stay in tune with the scene and 'cos We
at Mantra need help.
If anybody out there knows of any potential space we can use for the next
Mantra (Dec 6th) then please, please let me know. We need 2 rooms if possible
and space for up to 400-500 (maybe less) people. Any ideas?? We have
connections with the usual spaces that have been severely overused, but we're
looking for something "new" that we at Mantra haven't used before. It is so
hard to get spaces in this city - unbelievable. What's up with that?
Anyway, we have some money for a space and we have back up ideas for less
desirable places with general bad vibes floating around. If necessary we'll
just have to totally transform one of these with our magickal powers =) It's
been done before that's for sure - anybody check out Mantra at Cat's Grill
(Clementina Alley) This place took some work and so did Big Heart City, a
nasty place for the most part but we managed to transform it.
We're also looking for new fluorescent black art back drops for
trade/rent/sale if anybody has any info on that.....
Thanks for any help with all of this.
Love light and trance-formation

This is true, but in many cases (at least for me), it helps quite a bit
to know that even though there may be problems in a relationship, that the
underlying love is the most important thing, and that it makes it worth
some of the crap that makes people grow apart.

It may also be a firm first step towards fixing the underlying problems.

This is true, but in many cases (at least for me), it helps quite a bit
to know that even though there may be problems in a friendship, that the
underlying love and caring feelings that you have ARE STILL THERE.

Knowing that someone loves you even though you may drive each other
apeshit once in a while can really help (at least for me) to work out
some problems.

It may also be a firm first step towards fixing the underlying problems.

Exactly - live the moment, don't vanish without sharing the love you feel.

Hope this makes sense, and sorry about the space that made me send this message
twice (well,almost).

Dear SFRavefriends,

	I'll add my voice to Andre's here -- for once, I'm in favor of
removing something from the list.  8)
	The only exception I'd make is for the truly amusing ones.
There's always enough bandwidth for levity, imho.  For the rest, if we
must endure them, could we have a new filter?  I suggest "IRR" for
"irrational."  ;)

Much love,

P.S. - If you pass on a chain letter, you are destined to be cast into
the fiery pits of hell without a toothbrush or deoderant.  Just thought
you should know.

My computer tells me that on Wed, 20 Nov 1996, Andre Lucero shared:

the real logistical difficulty, as i see it, is that you have to have
containers for all that jello to chill... the jello will be very hot when
you take it off the stove, so depending on what the wading pool is made out
of, the jello might melt it :( so we might need a _lot_ of
pots/bowls/tupperware...

love,

brian

ps      if the jello doesn't feel like chilling, we can give it E and play
it ambient music, that should get it in the mood... ;)

This annoying Icelandic vocalist is INDEED at least engaged to Goldie =

opened for her during her last European tour), and rumours circulated =
early
this summer about her being pregnant.
As far as her music goes, it's not really house or rave-related in =
original,
however she chose to have big names from the house/techno scene (David
Morales, Todd Terry, LFO, Towa Tei, and a few others) remix most of her =
back
catalogue earlier this year. Most of the mixes were released as =
"extremely
limited promos", but still sold in stores like Wherehouse and Virgin. Can =
we
say "CASH RULES EVERYTHING AROUND ME"? Anyway, LFO did a pretty good job =
on 
Hyperballad, and if you like Bj=F6rk AND house/techno I suggest you check =
it 
out. =3D)

Last I heard they were splitsville. 

Bjork was also the one that nut tried to send a parcel bomb to
which was supposed to have sprayed whoever opened it with acid.
Fortunately it was intercepted before it was delivered.

Bjork's remixes are in general excellent (IMHO), esp Hyperballad -
there are many many remix CDs out - you can find them at Tower,
Blockbuster, etc. There are also many many versions of the same song,
at least 8 of Hyperballad - the "Girl's Blouse Mix" is generally
regarded as perhaps the best, so look out for that. The remixes 
are much more interesting than the original source material from her 
2 albums ("Debut" and "Post"). She's geting ready to release a 
full-length CD of remixes from Post, called "Telegraph" in the 
New Year.

Hope this makes it out in time!

Knucklehead, Andy Wyszkowski, and I are meeting today (Thursday) at a little
past 11:00am for lunch.  We will be going to Pedro's near Great America.

Directions:
If you are going south on 101 to Great America Pkwy. turn left off the exit and
go back over the highway. 
If you are going north turn right.

Just before the 1st or 2nd light will be a Mariot.  Turn right at that light.
Turn right onto Freedom Circle.
Pedro's is down the street about 1/2 mile on the right.

I'm not planning on making reservations since this is kind of last minute.  If
you plan on going try to give me a call at work before 10:30 or 10:45.

Something came up at work....I can't go,  and I was looking forward to
it... Maybe postpone it until tomorrow (friday). If not I'll have to do it
another time. I can't get out of what I'm doing today but tomorrow is for
sure free.

Greetings and love to all of you out there! (or in there!)
I don't mean to rehash everything that's already been said about 
eLevAtion but I just had to let all you guys know how powerful it was to 
Ben, Andrew, and me.
We left the bay area at about 7 on saturday evening. Got to the campsite 
in the beautiful and generally deserted Angeles National Forest at about 
1:00. We had the supreme pleasure of meeting Jbondy (who along with the 
other organizers and volunteers did an incredible job at establishing 
the vibe and all the li'l things that make a difference!). Most of the 
people that I spoke to were surprised to know that we had driven down 
all the way from s.f.for Elevation. Hey! it was calling out to us for 
weeks via socalraves.
We walked in and found a small tent city and also Our Man In L.A. a.k.a. 
Afzal. The dj at the time was (excuse my ignorance if I'm wrong) 
Tamerlane who rocked. I do not particularly like classifying music but 
I'd be curious if anybody who was there can tell me what they think his 
set consisted of.
I also got to meet Tiffany (Hi!) The table with the free food, fruit, and 
water was sweet.
I forget the progression of dj's but the music was in the cosmic realm 
all night long. That heady mix of house, straight trance, and goa managed 
to seamlessly integrate itself into a unified whole. just the way I'd 
like my life to be. 
Saw the most divine sunrise ever. The set and setting was perfect. I 
understand exactly what Geoge Harrison is talking about in "Here Comes 
The Sun." I stood by myself watching the sun rise through the clouds and 
feeling the source working it's magic.
I was amazed at how colorfully all of you were decked out. It was 
excellent eye and mind candy. Some of you looked like you were 
ready to make the transition to pure energy right there and then.
Especially Mason and the guy with the cool bright orange pants and long
braided hair. 

Toys>>>>
Thank you for the hand warmers. Kept me going for a long time.
The silver cloth/paper that was strung from the top of the tree with the 
specks of sunlight reflecting on it was sublime.
I don't even want to start about my intense love affair with the soap 
bubble machine to the left of the d.j. Suffice it to say, we had a great 
time together.
GoodE with his camcorder provided us with some truly beautiful snapshots 
of time & space.
The goddess with the two soap bubble guns zapped us more than once with 
blasts of energy.
Speaker Kidz and Speaker Hugz>>>>>
Thank you all for your role in shaping my reality and making it a happy 
and beautiful one. I lost myself and jacked into the main matrix in a 
speaker hug with about twenty other people. T'was most powerful indeed! 
The group hug right before the group photo and the spontaneous circle 
that formed afterwards reinforced to me why we do what we do.

We'd like to thank all of you for all that you gave us. You kids know 
what's up!
Thank you Andy and Brad for spinning those rekkids and taking me to the 
moon. The last couple of records that Brad played just took me far far away.

Hi to Luciano, Jbondy, Tom, Mason, Crunch (long time no see), Tiffany, 
Audrey and all the rest of you whose names we can't remember but whose 
faces and smiles are imprinted in our heads for life and beyond!The 
portal was opened at eLevAtion 2. Keep it open, always!
LOVE, HAPPINESS, AND THE RELENTLESS QUEST FOR THE COSMIC
Bom Shanker!
Dhiren & Ben

Please excuse the somewhat random structure of the following - this is
meant as a posting to SFRaves, not a term paper!


We think in terms of language.  Without advanced language concepts
one is incapable (in general) of having advanced thoughts.  Why
do we remember so little of our childhood up until the age of
3 or 4?  It is because we do not have the language skills to
make sense of our surroundings.  We can have vague rememberances
of places or events but no strong recollections because we tend
to remember (think) in terms of language concepts.  Noam Chomsky
posits that language constructs are actually "hard-wired" into
the human brain.  That is why children have such an amazing
ability to acquire language skills.

There is a latin saying "Namen est Nomen" meaning "to name is
to know".  It has been recognized for centuries that once you
put a name to something (a concept, say) you are now "conscious"
(have knowledge) of it.  A large part of learning a new subject is
learning all the definitions ("names") that go with that subject....

Your imaginings are confined to the level of your knowledge.

To emphasize imagination and creativity over knowledge and logic
is a creative dead-end.  People like to make a big deal over
"non-linear" thinking and reality, but the concept of non-linear
systems and thinking is itself a result of advanced mathematical
concepts.  People could not "see" the patterns of nature that
are fractal in nature until the mathematical concepts of fractals,
chaos and non-linearity were invented.

To have a higher conciousness (knowledge) one must first pass
through lower stages of conciousness (knowledge).  What is
conciousness but knowledge (of one's own state or of concepts
or of reality)?

To separate conciousness and creativity from knowledge and empiricism
is quite simply impossible....

To be creative at a higher level, one must have knowledge at a higher
level.

 Tim (knucklehead) said that he can't make it to the lunch at Pedro's
today. If it's rescheduled for tomorrow, it's OK by me. Assuming that 
Andy Wyszkowski and Jay Wiley are still doing it today, here's my
description: I'll be in my work clothes - blue dress shirt, gray 
sweater vest, gray slacks, black slip-on shoes. Fourty-ish asain-american
male.

 Like I said, if it's tomorrow, that would be OK too ( maybe a little
drier too, weather-wise ). It'd be nice to have Tim there too!

We've decided to go ahead and do it today since I have already sent out the
message.  We will be doing it again in the near future.  Hopefully with a
little better planning.

wants to give a carless, cal-train ridin' raver a ride there... let me know.
I am at the end of Willow road, near the dumbarton bridge.

Now while I somewhat agree with you here, I have to point out that there
are other schools of thought that say, the more you can name things,
the more separate you are from them...what do you think about that?

> Your imaginings are confined to the level of your knowledge.

Agreed; what you're talking about seems similar to that whole
pop psychology new agey "right-brain vs left brain" thing that is so
silly :o)

>People like to make a big deal over

Ah, perception is in the "eye" of the beholder?  What happens when you
transcend your senses? ;oD
And was "chaos" really invented by humans, or is it just our "language" to
partially describe a phenomenon that existed way before we did?

> To have a higher conciousness (knowledge) one must first pass

It seems to me that there are at least two different parts to this
consciousness/knowledge.  One is more about particulars, and one about
generalities.  I.E.,  identification, and ?intuition? for lack of
a better word.  You know that instant where you have sort of grasped the
overall something-ness...but you can't name it just yet...but you still
know, intuit, something about it without its particulars being defined?
(Am I making sense, or am I just %o} ?)

To me the "creative" part of consciousness is more in line with this
"generality" knowledge.  Again, this is just my wee l'il opinion :o)

I guess I should go ahead and say goodbye so's that I don't waste
another posting...I'm going to India day after tomorrow :oD  
It's 90% probable that I won't have this job (this account ;) ) when I
get back, and I don't know if I'll have email access when I move to
Santa Cruz in January.  So, I just wanted to say goodbye, and tell y'all
how much I enjoyed being on this group...I hope to be in touch again,
and meet more of you folks, if not thru the list then at future parties!

hope you all have great holidays and lots of fun in advance ;),
love,
shamini

How many Westbay ravers are on the list?   I'm in the Menlopark / RWC
vicinity as well.  But I don't feel like friving down to SC for lunch.
How bout a middle area (Mnt View? Palo Alto?) next time.  Or a West bay
lunch???

I have a copy of one of his mixed tapes that is good and the other day I 
found his cd Seasons - ONE which cam out this year in the used CD section 
for 6.95!  I had to get it and it's got some funky/disco house on it.  
Great for sunday afternoon relaxation.  Let me know too about the 
others.  I almost bought Mushroom Jazz cux id came with a CD rom disc too.
How is it?

	Really?  I don't get this!  It seems to me that the MORE
	you can name things the more CONNECTED you are!
	For example, if I am in a field of wildflowers of types I have
	never seen before, it would appear to me to be just a
	jumble of leaves, flowers, colors, etc.  But once I know the
	names of all the different flowers, I can see each one as a
	separate entity, making me more "connected" to each one
	(more aware of each one).....

	I don't believe you can create in your mind something out
	of nothing.  Our brains work mainly by making associations
	with things we are familiar with.  The more things you are
	familiar with, the more possible associations you can make,
	 the more possible associations you can make  the more
	"creative" you can be.

	This is actually one of my "pet" interests.  Human brains
	are very poor at making "random" associations whereas
	computers are great at making (albeit pseudo) random associations
	that would not normally occur to us.  My signature is from a
	program I wrote to randomly pair 4 letter words ("fact axon"
	and "data fate" were 2 I liked!).

	I think one of the main attractions humans have to mind altering
	substances is that we believe they help us make novel
	associations.....

	I know what you're saying and agree to some extent.
	The more restrictive the conditions in which you operate
	the more restricted you are in the possible creative solutions....
	But conversely, the more "knowledge" you can bring to
	a given set of conditions, the more possible solutions you
	can create....

	You can "know" things without being able to quite put
	your finger on it.  One is not always conscious of why
	you feel something is the correct thing to do.  The problem
	with this sort of knowledge is that it is prone to error.
	You may "feel" (it's obvious, right?) that (to use a dreary
	example) raising taxes will bring in more money to the
	government.  History (and analysis) will show that this is
	not necessarily so....

"Language shapes thought."
 It's true, and I find a lot of merit in what you are saying, up to a   
point.  To name _is_ to know, that may be true, but the inverse is not.   
 In order for language and thought to progress, it _must_ be possible to   
conceive of something new, before it is named, and then name it.   
 Otherwise language and knowledge would never grow.  So the naming and   
lingual framing is an important step in cementing a new understanding,   
and may lead to further new understanding, but there is, and must be,   
that gossamer leading rim of consciousness that extends outside of   
language; it's this elusive part, I think, that one strives to focus on   
when one talks of emphasizing imagination in efforts towards creativity.

So,
>Without advanced language concepts
>one is incapable (in general) of having advanced thoughts.
Perhaps one is less able to retain and further explore advanced thoughts,   
but it seems clear that novel thoughts must be unnamed when they are   
first conceived.

>Why
>do we remember so little of our childhood up until the age of
>3 or 4?  It is because we do not have the language skills to
>make sense of our surroundings.  We can have vague rememberances
>of places or events but no strong recollections because we tend
>to remember (think) in terms of language concepts.
I'll bet you're right.

>There is a latin saying "Namen est Nomen" meaning "to name is
>to know".  It has been recognized for centuries that once you
>put a name to something (a concept, say) you are now "conscious"
>(have knowledge) of it.  A large part of learning a new subject is

So retention and solid comprehension is aided by language.

>Your imaginings are confined to the level of your knowledge.
Woah!  This is where I think you're going too far!  :)

>To emphasize imagination and creativity over knowledge and logic
>is a creative dead-end.  People like to make a big deal over
>"non-linear" thinking and reality, but the concept of non-linear
>systems and thinking is itself a result of advanced mathematical

>chaos and non-linearity were invented.
So giving a name to this kind of thinking, "non-linear thinking", helps   
in our ability to understand and retain what it is we're talking about,   
but the name is just the result of an association of the raw,   
language-free concept, and a pre-existing concept of "non-linear".

>To have a higher conciousness (knowledge) one must first pass
>through lower stages of conciousness (knowledge).  What is
>conciousness but knowledge (of one's own state or of concepts
>or of reality)?
But consciousness does not equal knowledge.  It might seem that way, but   
I think it's an oversimplification.  At the core of it, when you strip   
away knowledge, context, environment, there is still something left of   
consciousness; I find there's a faceless, nameless, slippery core of the   
essence of a person.  And getting in touch with that, experiencing being   
on that level, I think is a goal of many who study meditation.

I expect there are lots of folks out there who've gotten in touch with   
this level through various drugs, as well!  :)   Anyone?

>To separate conciousness and creativity from knowledge and empiricism
>is quite simply impossible....
>To be creative at a higher level, one must have knowledge at a higher
>level.
Again, if you had to have knowledge and naming in advance of each new   
concept, then who would ever provide those names and knowledge?  The   
concept must come first, the naming and organization into "knowledge"   
later.

>refutations gladly accepted!
.... and gladly offered!  ;)  Your thoughts on the rebuttal?

This was my second Audio Impact (I also went to the first), and, wow,
what a _major_ improvement. When I first walked in the door, I was
happy to see that the big blue Gateway cabinets had replaced the
shrill, sound system-like torture device that they had previously. :)
The sound was just incredibly clean, which actually made it rather odd
sounding, as I'm used to hearing jungle played on ratty old systems in
party chill rooms...The distortion is usually sort of charming.

The vibe was *worlds* better than last time! I noticed that the bar
factor was very low, despite being at a bar. In fact, it was roughly
about the same as a night at Mad...which is certainly tolerable. Last
time I wrote about Audio Impact, I complained about all the weird
drunk people that would stand in my way and bump into me all
night. 

Not so last night! The level of respect for personal space was very
good, and just the overall vibe was so much more positive. The
lighting also was much more pleasant, especially since that irritating
strobe light of the first Audio Impact was no longer there...:)

Musically, things were more of the "light and bouncy" than the "evil
and noisy" type of jungle, but it was still hard enough for me to
seriously get _down_. Flux ripped it up again; he has quickly become
my favorite jungle DJ by virtue of the *incredible* variety of music
he has...

I guess my only complaint was with the MC; it was a nice touch at
times, but for the most part, it was overkill. I tend to be a music
purest; I'd rather hear the song, as it was originally intended to be
heard by the original artist. So hearing a little rasta rapping over
the music was not really up my alley.....oh well.

So last night was the perfect night of sheer jungle madness! I had a
great time, and as usual, I have post-jungle party leg syndrome :) Oh
well, I'm glad it's bi-weekly, and not weekly anymore; I don't think I
could physically handle that every week, but the tempatation would be
too great to miss it!

Oh my gosh!

What a crackin' party last night. The energy was super good and the music
was banging till about 2:30. Gateway provided the sound this week, and it
made a world of difference. Bass is everything with jungle, and there
certainly was a lot of it:) Abstract was playing when we arrived, and he
was cutting it up with some nice hardstep and jump-up tracks. Later in the
night he played his own song on dubplate, and it sounded damn good. MC'ing
thought the evening was Jamalski and can this guy toast, or what! Flux and
Noel also did a bang-up job and kept the crowd goin for it on the dance
floor. Hope this club is here to stay.

fractals, chaos, and non-linearity were not invented. they were
discovered. mathematical models for observing and working with them were
invented.

i would say that conciousness is _awareness_ of one's own state. does
awareness=knowledge? i'm not sure. but i know that i don't necessarily
have to be able to think empirically about something in order to be aware
of it.
 
> > To separate conciousness and creativity from knowledge and empiricism

i find that my emotions can exist quite apart from knowledge and
empiricism, in fact, i have had emotional-intuitive experiences that were
quite impossible to translate into thought (let alone language...), and i
know that creativity can spring from emotion without rational thought,
i've done it!

> To be creative at a higher level, one must have knowledge at a higher
> level.

perhaps what i perceive as emotion sans knowledge, you would perceive as
"knowledge on a higher level"... i have an intuition (don't ask me to talk
about it, since i don't have any knowledge of it:) that this discussion is
mostly semantic.

We showed up around 11 pm and there were a handful of people standing 
around the dance floor, kinda wiggling around, a couple of em getting 
into it. my friend, who is quick to judge, almost wanted to turn around 
and leave, but since last audio impact filled up later, i assured him to 
wait about a half hour and see. Was i right or was i right? within a 
half hour, or even 20 minutes, the floor became packed with bouncy 
junglists. and YES! they were nicer this time! (i.e. people weren't 
standing in the middle of the dance floor taking up space that could 
have been DANCED in) last audio impact was full of people with attitude, 
this one was full of people who just wanted to celebrate the music.. MY 
KINDA PEOPLE!!! :>
	 i was pretty tired, so i spent alotta time sitting on the speakers 
(YES, I THINK THEY FOUND A GOOD SOUND SYSTEM THIS TIME!!) and the MC 
came up and rapped in my ear, putting a smile on my face. later on, he 
kinda sorta REALLY rewound a track that i didn't wanna hear again, but 
he made up for it by rewinding a track that i REALLY wanted to hear 
again, so it evened out. it was fun to have an MC at the party, but 
sometimes it was overkill. 
I think i got there when Abstract was playing, his set was great, as 
usual... then FLUX came on.. since the first audio impact i've noticed 
"hey he's pretty cool! and creative too!" which is a good thing.. but 
the MC's voice kinda interfered with the pure bass commin outta the 
speakers. Noel came on next, and he gets MAJOR props for dealing with 
the MC's "rewinds" an'stuff. and then flux came on again, mixed some R&B 
in with some breaks and i went "wow!" and then i was dragged home to 
face the reality of the fact that i have a midterm today. 

all in all audio impact has a better sound system, a better vibe, FREE 
water this time instead of 25 cent cups (which *is* better than $2), 
more people dancing, BETTER BETTER BETTER! i'm getting the best of my $5 
when i walk into that room to some smooth jungle and smiling faces. 
MAJOR PROPS and see ya at the next one!!

Just a reminder that a week from today is Thanksgiving, and if you
haven't already made plans with the fam (or if you need an excuse to
get away!), then plan on a night of food, celebration, and music with
saturn5!

Here's the original message; hope to see you then! :)

--------------------

Hello! This has been in the works for a while, and it's finally time
to announce it!

On Thursday, Novemember 28th 1996 AD, please join us for:
                    Thanksgiving!!!

This will be an evening to celebrate with good food and music, and
to give thanks for the wonderful people and things that we have in
our lives. :)

This party is especially dedicated to people who (like myself) are not
originally from the Bay Area, and have no family to see... or just
can't make it out to be with their families. Why have a boring night
alone, eating Ramen? Party with us instead!!! Let's make our *own*
family this Thanksgiving!

DJ's for the night:

Mystr-E (frequency 8)
John Carel (gateway systems)
Anon (look for her at mantra :)
Warren Parker (one track mind)
Jon Logan (ambiance during dinner)

Dinner will be provided by Raw, a restaurant in SF specializing in
raw, super-energizing foods, and of course will be 100% vegan :)

Dinner and ambient music will begin around 9pm-ish, with trance music
running until 6 the next morning. The party will be in San Francisco,
and due to the size of the location, we'll have room for only about
200 or so people, so come early! :)

voicemail: 415.248.1997 (saturn5)

from your favorite happy turkey, ;)

Steve

pretty funny that we're emailing about the status of their

Once again you missed Stareyes set!  She kicked things off with a really
cool set!  This is the first time I've seen her and she had a pretty cool
set!  (She's also insanely cute!)  Anyway I had a lot on my mind so you
didn't see me moving out there, but it was a cool experience.  The MC
definately overdid it, but that's the style in England, I've heard some
recordings, and over there they just go nuts with it.
I love rewinds too!
I'd like to hear more ambient/smooth jungle, mixed in with all the
hardstep, other than that, it was a perfect night.
(Lara glad to hear you could make it!)

Subject: saturn5 meeting for Thanksgiving!
Sender: sfraves-owner@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk


This Monday, November 25th will be the organizational meeting for
Thanksgiving, the first ever party to be put on by saturn5! If you are
interested in helping out (clean-up, door, etc.), providing any sort
of decoration/visuals, or anything(!!!) then please come to the
meeting :)

The theme of Thanksgiving is the notion of community and family, and
this party will be a big success if we _all_ put our creative energies
and hard work together! So if you have something to contribute, we
would love to have you as part of the crew!!!

The meeting will be at my apartment in San Francisco, which is right
off of the freeway in the beautiful South of Market area. Chai will
probably be served as well.

I haven't set the time yet, but probably later on in the evening, since I
don't get home from work until around 7:30 or so anyway...

Thanks, and hope to see you on Monday!

Steve

Actually, funny you should mention it ... Today I'm older than EVER!  43,
talk an age that, other than being a prime number, doesn't have a lot of
distinction... 'cept that since I'm really somewhere between 18 and 20 on
the weekends, I guess it isn't so bad afer all!

So, I'm accepting all openhearted, happy wonderful birthday wishes from
everyone (for those of you who think I appear pretty well-adjusted, I'm
pretty much a basket case on birthdays for some reason, gotta get over
that!)

and when you give those birthday wishes to me, send them to SDream as well
(hey Todd!!!) and it appears Mark Camp too!  As the Beatles said..

DA DA DADA DADA da da -- TODAY IS YOUR BIRTHDAY,
DA DA DADA DADA da da -- IT"S MY BIRTHDAY TOO YEAH!

I love you all, no matter how old I get ... and at least I'm not the oldest
one on SFRaves, eh?

Leslie

Well, todays little gathering was small.  Andy, Larry, Dhiren, and I were the
only ones there but there seemed to be a lot of interest so......

On Tuesday, Nov. 26 at 12:00pm we will be doing it again.  There were some 
requests to make it later so we moved it to noon.  If some people still can't
make it we'll try to see about having them a little later sometimes.

We have yet to decide on a restaurant so anyone interested in going can mail
me suggestions.  Andy, Tim, and I all work right around Trimble and Great 
America Pkwy on 101 so try and make it as close to that area as possible, at
least this time.  

If you're interested try to let me know by Monday. If there are a lot of us
I'll need to make reservations and possibly even divide us into two groups.

already 'outed' me and I had loads of wonderful messages from some of my

You know, I LOVE SFRAVES!  It is such an important part of my life, thanks

complain too much. It's not MY chain letter, I have no Idea whos it really
is? But I'm sorry I had to screw all of you beautiful people this way, but

        Does that count if I believe that there is no hell? I do believe
that there is a good and a bad in everything, but I do not believe that
there is actually a place called heaven or hell. That's just my belief and I
wouldn't push it on anyone. I just state my ideas and let whoever decide for
themself. Not like those damn people who insist on riding their little 10
speeds to my front door to talk about something I have no interest in.

        See, the past week has been full of decisions for me. Right now I'm
stuck in a decision that will effect the rest of my life. I have the
oppurtunity to have a career with a multi-billion dollar company. Also,
another man, who worked for my father, says that he can get me in with a
section (soon to be whole) of the same company. 

        It's just bothering me how I have all of these things to do, and so
little time to do it. Don't you hate when you have to make a big decision
like a lifetime career in just a few days??? 

        The company will spend over $30,000 training me in a Tech. Rep. job.
After a certain time, I will recieve several raises, promotions, and I will
end up a big part in a huge company. This company, which I'm pretty sure is
supposed to be calling themselves ICON when they move into the big building
off the freeway in Oakland that Says "Better office systems". It's supposed
to be a really hard job, I'm going to have to work hard to learn a ton, plus
I have to finish 5 more months of my college and keep my A's up. I want to
continue college and I hope this job (which I most likely will receive),
will allow me enough time to do. 

        See, I guess that it was good that I got a quick start on my career.
I started college right after high school without any break (besides a
little over a month for summer). I hope I don't get severe burn out. I'm
just doing this all sooo quickly when my friends and the majority of my
peers are still just hanging with a reg job, living their youth. WOW! I
guess that I'm happy that I'll be where they wish they could be, like ten
years before they are. It's just weird how, I'm going from not having hardly
any time for myself to having almost no time for myself.

        I guess I'll get used to it. I keep thinking that it's only
temperary until I'm done at Heald, then a good portion of stress will be off
me. I have to juggle this decision, my friends, my family, my girlfriend, my
fitness, my motocross, my snowboarding, my personal time, and my social life
all at once. I know that you'll probably say that I don't HAVE to do all
that. But if I didn't do all of that, I just wouldn't be happy, and there's
no point in doing it if it won't make me better off right???

        So far, this week, even though I get up around 7:15 in the morn, the
days seem waaaaaay to short to do everything I'd like to do. They either
need to make days longer, or they need to do something else. . . 

        I guess I just have to keep my faith in myself. No one really
understands how complicated everything is for me at the moment. I know that
it can be fairly simple, but it's a big role in my life and it's required to
succeed, and I WILL SUCCEED! Did all of those people, who have made
millions, and have had tremendous success in their lives have to go through
all this? I think they did. In a way, I'm really happy, and I'm really sad. 

        I think a good recipe for life is just to take it as it comes, don't
worry abpout tomorrow, don't worry about yesterday, don't worry at all. Just
do what you do, take it one day at a time, and before you know it, you'll be
there. 

        I guess it's a good thing that my parents support me well. Although
they really have no clue in what's going on in my life, they do what they
can to help me do whatever I'm doing. Damn life's tough. But y'know? The
harder it is, the better I like it. It would be nice if everything was easy,
but then it would get all boring and monotonous. I guess that's the point right?

        I pretty much put all of this pressure on myself. My family doesn't
pressure me on anything really. They'd just like me to get a job, some type
of job, so I can pay my car insurance. It's me that makes me so complicated.
I need a vacation or somethin. But I guess that first, I have to work.

        Damn, I know, I'll work my ass off in school right now, so I'll have
less to do in the coming weeks. Hell, I have two essays that are going to be
due in one of my classes and I've easily written enough for three or four
essays that size today. I need to just chill, relax, take a couple breaths,
and get down to teh task at hand.
As long as everyone stays off my back, I probably won't snap. Right now
school is the main thing I'm looking forward to. That's good. I'm gonna have
to get a lot of sleep on the weekends since I'll probably be working from
8am-5pm, then I'll have enough time to make my way to taco bell of something
before i have to make my way to school at 6pm-10:30pm, then home to do all
of my schoolwork, my homework from my job (which is supposed to be hell of a
lot), then go to sleep for a couple hours before work the next day. WOW. . .
I didn't think it was gonna be THAT hard. It really makes you appreciate
your days off. . . Like, I'll be living on amphetamines or somethin. . . or
at least a gallon of coffee. But at least I'll be on my way. Nothings
usually ever as hard as other people make it seem. 

        I just need some words of ENCOURAGEMENT. Please no criticism. Unless
it's nice criticism.

        Thanks for letting me let off some pressure. . . 

        You all are great people!

        If you see me at a party, please give me aphat hug and squeeze some
of my worries away.

Aryck :)

I guess some of you haven't made jello squares for your kids recently 
 ;)  I might also add that I thought y'all were joking about this but 
 since the conversation is continuing here's my $.02:    You can begin 
 the hardening of jello by adding blocks of ice to start the 
 thickening.  Clear gelatin added in the dissolution phase (rather than 
 colored jello) can continue/hasten the thickening but not the color.

Lastly, I just wanna say that y'all are really sick.  :)  I've 
 created/played in mud pits,whipped cream and other sordid environments 
 and all I gotta say is you'll need a good hose or lotsa hot water.

Gullibly yours (yes, it's in the dictionary ;),

the real logistical difficulty, as i see it, is that you have to have
containers for all that jello to chill... the jello will be very hot when
you take it off the stove, so depending on what the wading pool is made out
of, the jello might melt it :( so we might need a _lot_ of
pots/bowls/tupperware...

love,

brian

ps      if the jello doesn't feel like chilling, we can give it E and play
it ambient music, that should get it in the mood... ;)

More stuff for anyone interested in bjork....

I just checked the bjork websense web-site (http://www.bjork.co.uk/bjork/)
(a great website, btw, with very fun links to stuff like recipes,
making string figures, and even esp (wooo)) and it appears that
the new mix album "telegram" will be out nov 25!

btw, in case anyone's running out to buy the hyperballad girl's blouse
mix, be warned it's not a stomping rave-type number - it's very quiet.
Other mixes on the main hyperballad mix cd are more lively - but pretty
much any of the mix cd's are fun. (I'd especially recommend the "big time
sensuality" mix cd - make sure you get the one with the fluke mixes). 
I'd also definitely check out telegram when it comes out.

ok, here goes...

the more i grow and learn and experience, the more i find myself having
certain beliefs about "reality."

in fact, i have two distinct, apparently conflicting beliefs about reality,
both of which would be rejected by the "scientific mainstream," -- and, in
the end, they don't conflict at all.

first belief, and very much along the lines of what some have argued here
already, is that we know nothing about reality other than what we perceive.
this is not the same as saying that there is no external reality. but i
feel strongly that if there is an external reality, i have no way of being
certain of anything about it. "all you touch and all you see / is all your
life will ever be" kind of relates to this (for me, anyway)... i've always
sort of thought this way, but it was acid that convinced me. if a few
micrograms of a substance can alter my brain chemistry so as to throw me
into an entirely different conceptual world, i have no reason to believe
that my reality is the same as anyone else's. it's just one of those things
i have to accept as unknown.

the second belief, a little bit more far-out, is that "we are all one with
the cosmic vibe." this takes a little bit of explanation although i'm sure
some of you already know what i'm talking about. the idea is that each of
us is a manifestation/thread/microcosm of a some sort of abstract
"universal consciousness"... don't get me wrong, i DON'T believe in any
sort of anthropomorphic god, nor do i believe that any of this is
"supernatural"... an analogy which i think has already been mentioned would
be fractals... each part a representation of the whole...

thus in a sense i believe that we do share a reality-- or rather, that we
are all manifestations/facets of the same reality... i'm you, and you're me
(again a la acid)...

this really does fit with the idea that there's no reality outside of my
perceptions. see, if i'm you, and you're me, and we're all the cosmic vibe,
then it becomes a moot point to ask whether my reality is the same as
yours. "i'm you and you're me" can be thought of either in terms of an
objective reality (we are literally manifestations of the same real
universal consciousness), or in terms of subjective reality (you and the
cosmic consciousness are both all in my mind, so _of course_ you're me and
i'm you and we're the vibe), and when you think about it, either way
amounts to the same thing.

i know this all sounds a bit new-agey, but the events in my life over the
past few months have been really pushing me in this direction of belief.
it's been uncanny how things keep working out as if to "show me" this
philosophy (further evidence in my own mind of the whole cosmic
consciousness idea)...

plurally, (now there's a word with about four relevant definitions :)

Subject: Effects of the next cycle of solar interference 

[Source: Coming solar cycle may pose problems, AP item, 19 Nov 1996, 
PGN Stark Abstracting and Excerpting Service.]

Cycle 23 of solar interference activities is building up, and is expected to
have considerable effects on our planet around the year 2000, according to a
panel of government researchers.  (Cycle 22 was at its peak in July 1989
[see RISKS-8.38, 39 on electric currents induced in power lines, blacking
out Quebec, and RISKS-8.72 for a more detailed retrospective article]; the
strongest cycle to date was in November 1957.)  In particular, many new
industries have emerged that were not subjected to previous solar effects --
and they have not anticipated the risks to their systems and their
businesses.  Navigation and communications are considered to be particularly
vulnerable.  For information on the report, you might try contacting Air
Force Col. Jud Stailey, assistant director of the Office of Federal
Coordinator for Meteorological Services, a 13-agency panel housed in the
offices of the National Weather Service, or Ernie Hildner, director of the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Space Environment Center
in Boulder, Colo.

Potential problems to anticipate include damage to computers and other
electrical systems in satellites; expansion of the Earth's atmosphere,
slowing down satellites and pieces of space debris, making them harder to
track; induced currents in pipelines and other large arrays of metal;
disruption of signals for the inexpensive single-frequency global
positioning system satellites; interference with the newly developed
satellite cell-phone system; changes in the Earth's magnetic field,
interfering with signals used to direct oil drilling bits deep underground.

  [An obvious question for RISKS readers is which will have a more dramatic
  effect, Y2K or Cycle 23?  Perhaps we will have Murphy-slaw and each will
  reinforce the other on the same day!  PGN]

I did a quickie redesign of the calendar web page; I'm still not quite done
yet.  Send any formatting suggestions to me at dhchung@hyperreal.com.  Later
I might get to the rest of the SFR site as well.  If for any reason you 
want the old layout (it's a little better for lynx), use oldcal.cgi in 
the same directory.

I think I'm going to be at Stompy tomorrow night, and I haven't decided
if I'll do anything on Saturday.  Mad last monday was pretty nice too, 
hopefully I'll try some new stuff soon too.  Next week's calendar will be
out on Wednesday because of Thanksgiving.

I loved Mushroom Jazz I thought I was great for as you say "A sunday
afternoon relaxation" and it also was a great back drop for a night of
late studying to try and pass a test you know you are going to fail. I
just keeps you mellow. A great CD. I am going to have to go and get
Seasons now too. The CD-ROM was cool to you could use a little mixer to
mix you own lil tune witrh some premade samples.

Brian, I've dedicated most of my life to investigating these issues,
and I can safely say that virtually everything you've stated is
exactly right.

Furthermore, there is more truth to the "supernatural" than seems
likely - it's just different than what is portrayed in the supermarket
tabloids (just as true spirituality is different than what is
portrayed in Time magazine).

In our normal mental state, we are not aware of other levels of
reality, because we spend all our time focused on those things which
are in the physical world (passing finals, buying clothes, etc.).

It's similar to the way that the world of nature seems very remote
when one is South of Market, but seems obvious when one is out at the
Russian River....


Cheers,

Ken                         <*>

OK, i'm finally gonna kick myself in the butt and make a promo tape.

Problem:  where is a cheap and RELIABLE place to get them duplicated?

Someone else posted the same recently, but i didn't see any answers posted 
to the list.  If anyone knows of a good place, please e-mail me privately or 
share it with the list if u feel it's appropriate.

ALSO.....if anyone wants a free....or at cost promo tape..u can also e-mail me.
I'll give them out 4 free if they are for actual promotional purposes, otherwise u 
guys can have them at my cost..whatever that ends up being.

Hey everyone,

Thanks again for another excellent night of Drum n' Bass! 

Major props to Gateway for the sound. During the night, I felt things
hiting me on the head. I went to Rob, and asked him what was up, and he
mentioned the ceiling was falling apart (yeah, right).

So I looked up, and sure enough, was hit by a piece of falling plaster!

Talk about great sound!  :)

We'll be fine tuning the sound so we don't destroy the place (unless the
management gets outta hand - always good to have a trump card in your
back pocket ;). 

As for water, it'll be free from now on. If the bartenders get funny and
try to charge you, tell someone at the door, and we'll set them
straight...;)

The crowd was better because we did 18+. It's give and take with the age
thing. All ages means we can pay the crew better, and get more people in
the door, but then there's all that annoying bullshit (like the tags)
and occasional attitudes. We'll probably keep it 18+, and work on
promoting more to pay the bills.

As for the MC, we're still experimenting. MC's and jungle can work very
well with getting the crowd whipped into a frenzy, but last night a was
a bit much. Keep up the feedback, and we'll get things sorted.

Next Audio Impact is Wed. Dec 4th. If you have any questions or concerns
about the party, please mail flux@hunab-ku.com, or call the BASS crew #
at 415-332-5800 ext 24-7

Audios!

Ya, Ya, I know this is a very late post for something I lost at Wrinkle in
Time. I lost or had taken from me a green backpack. It is an old one from
REI that had a blue Lib Tech T-shirt, a beenie that said choclate on it, a
girls sweater and my keys. Most important is my black sketch book with a
proffesional sticker on it. Any whereabouts will be much appreciated.

thanks

Thanks to some last minute arrangements, Dionysus Dreams will be
providing visuals and lighting for saturn5 on Thanksgiving! The
DDreams crew has been seen gracing the presence of the chill rooms
in all of the most recent Harmony parties and also Mantra...

Also, since DDreams (Randy) is from Santa Cruz, transportation will be
needed for equipment and one passenger. If anyone can provide this,
please send email (off-list). Thanks!

Steve

Hi all!

 Last I was aware of there was a pile of lost stuff left at Third Wave 
Dance Studios. Unless someone from the Tigger crew picked this up (I 
don't think so as I was the last tired soul out of the building) it 
should still be there. If that is the case folks may want to call TWDS 
ASAP to claim their belongings.

hugz,

So, are any of you familiar with the Casio MX (or) MT 260. It had a sh*t
load of samples and midi in and out. I can pick it of for $50. It might be
alot of fun to play with for live music. If you know anything about this
thing please let me know.

I cannot disagree with many of your points.  As with any argument, I
was incomplete or incorrect on some points...

You are totally correct that you must be able to conceive of something
new without naming it, and you can conceive of things without using
language (spatial thinking, for example), but still, anything you can
conceive must be germinated from something else.  I cannot see
how the human brain can conceive of something out of nothing -
virtually all new thoughts are made of combinations of previously
known facts or even combinations of previously thought thoughts......


>>Your imaginings are confined to the level of your knowledge.

>Woah!  This is where I think you're going too far!  :)

This is a point I think we can agree to disagree on.  Again, I don't
see how the human brain can conceive of something that is outside
our realm of experience (including thoughts).  One can build a pyramid
of progressively more abstract thoughts built on lower bases of less
abstract
thoughts, but still, there must be some base of knowledge and experience
on which to begin your ascent.....

they're the people that do that "we dress a certain way, we walk a certain
way, we talk a certain way, we create a certain way, we paint a certain
way, we make love a certain way ..." song that's on the new Mark E Quark
tape and has been on heavy rotation in Tracy's live sets lately. they also
do the "dancing around a coffee table as a form of unconscious therapy"
track that's on the new Inhuman tape.

it's not so much coffee house psedu-intellictual beatnik spoken word that
i've heard done before, but more like something i'd expect to overhear
while waiting for the bus or while standing in line at Safeway. fly

like it to be like Mood II Swing.

But is naming the end-all to knowledge?  I disagree with this.  To name is to 
lose sight of the true nature of a thing.  A name is a representative 
association with something percieved.  Perception is forgotten when names are 
remembered.

I cannot disagree with many of your points.  As with any argument, I
was incomplete or incorrect on some points...

You are totally correct that you must be able to conceive of something
new without naming it, and you can conceive of things without using
language (spatial thinking, for example), but still, anything you can
conceive must be germinated from something else.  I cannot see
how the human brain can conceive of something out of nothing -
virtually all new thoughts are made of combinations of previously
known facts or even combinations of previously thought thoughts......


>>Your imaginings are confined to the level of your knowledge.

>Woah!  This is where I think you're going too far!  :)

This is a point I think we can agree to disagree on.  Again, I don't
see how the human brain can conceive of something that is outside
our realm of experience (including thoughts).  One can build a pyramid
of progressively more abstract thoughts built on lower bases of less
abstract
thoughts, but still, there must be some base of knowledge and experience
on which to begin your ascent.....

Actually I think that this interaction is COMPLETELY rave related!
Development of consciousness is (for a lot of people I know in the rave
"scene") the most important reason for being involved -like minded people
and all that. Even if you don't comprehend the spiritual level of the rave
movement, it is in any case equally as important as anything pertaining to
"entertainment" (a bogus concept IMO) and definitely way more relevent than
drug discussions, which actually (should) relate with spiritual and
consciousness concerns. It's all related, ya know!

FYI, Mood II Swing have been around for years, consistently putting out
solid House music. Lem Springsteen and John Ciafone are from NY, and unlike
most of their Big Apple brethren, fuse typical NY house grooves with
allsorts of other influences such as minimal techno (Maurizio etc) and
harder edged psychedelic house, making a really different sound. They are
very flexible: some of their stuff is vocal based garage (such as their
excellent mixes for Wall of Sound on Eightball -"Critical" is a classic of
the genre), some is dubby house (such as their stuff on Nitegrooves) and
some is weird and experimental (such as the record mentioned above - an EP
on NY label Groove On.) The one quoted is called "Learn to Love Yourself"
and the other tracks are excellent too. Whenever I hear people dissing on
House, Mood II Swing is one of the names I recommend them to check out.
Innovative and very modern producers worth investigating if you're into the
real stuff.

     another good band name is "Professor Smith".  The song "Remember.." i 
     don't know it's like a string of numbers like 48062 or something like 
     that.  
     
     cute song.

Continuing the strange confluence of rave culture and student housing in 
Berkeley, this Saturday Night there is a very NRR party at our largest 
co-op, Cloyne Court.

DJs Stareyes and Abstract will be spinning jungle, as an aside.

The main attraction at the party (as far as Berkeley college parties go) 
is ska bands Skankin Pickle, Save Ferris and someone else I can't remember.

If the djs are spinning in the usual space, this is a very small dance 
area!  But maybe they'll get smart and provide a larger dancefloor.

It's five bucks.  Address: 2200 Ridge Road.  Northside of campus.
  
University Ave exit off the 80, go all the way til it runs into campus.  
Take a left, the next light is Hearst, make a right.  Next light is Euclid, 
make a left, one block up (Ridge), a right, and one block to Cloyne!

Party goes 9PM to 1AM - (it WILL end on time!)
You will also need an 18+ id

And please notice that Derek Chung, our faithful calendar maintainer
and long-time list denizen is listed  as the author of the software
that lets you mix those samples in the interactive disk that comes with
the mark-farina mushroom jazz release.

Go Derek! The man is so modest he didn't even BSP us with info about
this disk. (too bad i don't have the kind of computer needed to run the
software on that disk, otherwise, i'd have bought it too -- a coworker
had it at work, and it did sound/look pretty neat).

Wouldn't that be a bad idea. . . a bunch of burnt out, look what the cat
drug in ravers trying to make their way down a mountain that may or may not

OUCH! I have a hard enough time boarding with just 4-5 hours of sleep let

Yes!
It was really cool. Andy you were the perfect host! Thank y'all for 
sharing time and space! It was real kickback and mellow! Andy's spinnig 
paid off big time in my reality and ben's. As we were driving home we were 
snickering to each other and going "we're going to be able to tell people 
that we had Andy W. spin for us at his house" when you're recoginized by 
the rest of the world for your artistic vision. Your set ruled. 't was 
mercurial yet there was a gossamer thin , almost invisible (inaudible? 
nay! intangible is the better word) connection between all the music 
played. I really like it 
when a collection of vastly different music maintains a pattern in my head 
and surprises me.  It was really cool to listen to 
music that was not limited to one genre due to a pigeonholing of art on 
the part of the artist. I loved the eclectic nature of the music. All of 
you out there , if you ever get a chance to see Andy W. spin, don't pass 
it up. I guarantee it will be well worth your time.

until next time,
love 
dhiren

 Yeah right. So I guess since I piss and shit while at raves (and hey lets 
not forget the porta-potties promoters rent) we should talk lots about 
this also.

 When this discussion started it had a relation to raves (although what I 
can't recall) but has since moved away from it. I won't bother trying to 
make my point any further.

Do what thou wilt.

     Thank you all kindly for showing.  I hope we have an opportunity to 
     gather like this on a larger scale soon (more space, more people!!!).  
     It was more than a pleasure to open my house & record collection to 
     friends.
     
     I'm looking forward to having another one soon with someone else 
     spinning, and I promise I'll post for that one.
     
     Peace,
     AndyW

hello all-

if you're actually reading this message, i'm assuming that you're a geek.

well, let me tell you: never get your filehandles confused and try to write
the contents of files straight to the directory filehandle.  i just created
a directory with 65,735 directory.  ever try to delete that (rm won't handle
it!)

well, i'm off to see if perl can fix my problem-

later-

  Hmm, I believe Tapei is also the video game piracy capital of the

  and, if they haven't read it, "1984" is a nice balance.  Two very 
different takes on the future.  Huxley's view seems more like (or maybe 
I'm just not paranoid enough), but Orwell's is more chilling.  Hmm, maybe 
reading the two works too close together will only serve to confuse.
  what else of huxley's is good?

  If symbolism is used to replace direct experience, this is a problem.  
But symbolism is necessary to expand one's understanding of the world.  I 
believe this is clearly illustrated in child development.  The more words 
you can teach a child, the more of a framework they have in which to 
place their experiences so as to build their understanding.

     I concur with my noble raver-colleague's assertation that Huxley's 
     "Brave new world" certainly paints a more hedonistic view of the 
     future in contrast to Orwell's often bleak and depressing view of a 
     future where Love itself is seen as an aberration to be wiped out by 
     the omnipresent "big brother".
     Digressing slightly, I would also recommend Terry Gilliam's movie 
     "Brazil" as a contrast to, and perhaps a superior interpretation of 
     Orwell's book than the movie "1984".

And Huxley got it from William Blake.  Less well-known than Doors of
Perception, but I think even more interesting for ravers is "Heaven and
Hell."  It's another essay of ruminations on the psychedelic experience,
relating it to the bigger class of visionary and mystical experience in
general.  He goes over a variety of the many ways people have used to
explore visionary states--music and dance, different sorts of asceticism,
chemicals, contemplation (there's a bunch of stuff about visionary art that
ought to ring a bell with anyone who's ever tripped out on a big Day-Glo
mandala shining away under black light)--comparing and connecting them.  I
don't buy all his speculations--seems generally to push his metaphors too
far--but it's interesting stuff.

I have not read the previous posts on this topic. don't mind me if i 
don't make sense for contributing at such a late time!

Both of your arguments are agreeable to a certain extent. Lucas' 
statement, " Perception is forgotten when names are remembered" is not 
all together true, in my humble opinion. Perception is not necessarily 
forgotten. I would percieve to see in my mind an apple if someone said 
"apple" in English or some other language. What color is the first apple 
you see in your mind? The apple I see may be yellow when "apple" is first 
mentioned. Your apple, however may be red. This does not change the fact 
that we are talking about edible fruits called apples. Therefore, 
each of our perception of an object is not completely forgotten. 
 This leads me on to ask is your apple truer than mine (in regards to the 
true nature of things)? 

In response to Matt's reply: I wish there was a way to communicate 
with children without words, without a framework that we instill in 
them, so that we can understand their thoughts as they are.
  I hope it isn't out of context for me to say that symbolism 
would not necessarily expand our thoughts of the 
world. It may somewhat hinder them because they reduce our many varied 
thoughts, perceptions, or ideas into one condensed thing.

  No one reads Huxley's *Island* today -- but, if you're interested in
transcendental experiences evoked by psychedelics, there is a beautiful
description of the main character's trip in chapter 15. He takes the
"moksha-medicine" and describes a trip that is surely based on one of
Huxley's own. The evocation of the paradoxes of psychedelic experiences
-- the infinite ecstasy and infinite sadness than can follow on each other
in an instant -- is wonderfully set forth. A good part of the character's
trip is spent listening to music, while watching a praying mantis!
Powerful stuff.
  Which makes me wonder: has anyone ever set down memories of their
experiences while raving under the spell of E? One fellow I talked with
told me that "E is just a superficial drug. You feel good on the surface
for a few hours, then it dies away." But that may have been only his take
on it. Has anyone ever described, in a Huxleyan fashion, the experiences,
and meditations on those experiences, catalyzed by E?

Hi there,
I'm renting a 3 BR, 2 BA house along the San Jose/Cupertino
border and have one room available for rent.  The location
is near 280 and Lawrence (by Mitty H.S. if you know where
that is.)

It's right across the street from the park.  The dimensions
of the room are 10 1/2' by 11 1/2'.

Reply via email, please, if interested.

        Hey Ravers-If I'm not mistaken it is a full moon tonight, and I was
wondering if anyone knows of any outdoor parties.  I know it was supposed
to rain, but, in a shocking surprise, the weatherman was wrong and it is a
really beautiful night.  Great for an outdoor party.  Anybody know of one?

Hey, I've got detailed information on virus hoaxes and how some of them
have reached urban legend status.  It's a bulletin put out by the Dept. of
Energy and is really informative.  I won't spam the list with it, but if
anyone would like to read it, email me privately.  Included in the hoaxes
is "Irina" which someone just recently posted about.

I hope everyone is having a great time right now!!! :)

Hi all!  =)

 I've been asked to help out the Saturn5 trance party on 11/28/96. This 
event features raw vegan food by Raw of San Francisco (YUM!). I am 
currently searching for ride help with this event. I need a decent sized 
pick-up (with shell) or van. I may have a ride up (Santa Cruz to SF) but 
would need one coming back. All inquiries answered!

smiles,

I was planning on going to the HiFi lounge shortly. There will be some
House and Techno starting at noon. No cover and it will be going until late
tonight, probally until 2am. I'm not staying there the whole time. Just
kicking back for a few hours. Is anyone interested in meeting there. I'm
going to head over there in about an hour or so. It's at 14 S 2nd @ Santa
Clara in San Jose. It is a 21+, so that's kinda a bummer for some. If you
have a better idea for the SouthBay then let's hear it. I kinda want to get
out. Didn't go out this weekend, so I'm in the mood to escape right now.

Let me know if your interested.

Hey all of ya out there!

I have to say I had sooo much fun at Wyrd last night!  It may have been hot and 
sweaty and claustrophobic but it kicked major butt!  I can't remember the last 
time I was around so many happy beautiful people!  I danced til I could dance no 
more and the veins on the back of knees hurt.  I hope everyone else had a great 
time!

That is so funny that you posted this, wayne.  I was sitting with my
friends in the chill space downstairs talking w/ them on how much that
place reminded me of the ACME.  <sigh>  nostalgia.....

yes, the new"ACME",indeed,
oversold, overcrowded, fire-trap disaster waiting to happen
but the music was great!!!
even though there really wasn't enough room to dance :(
i truly think that we deserve better spaces
i have some ideas - any body want to get together on this?

Hi-Fi lounge is pretty chill. Knucklehead and I played a little pool and 
grooved to the choons. I found the sound quite good, and even when Mark 
dropped a couple mellow jungle songs, the bass sounded warm and sticky. 
Cheers to Sessions for a nice *free* sunday afternoon.

was a totally killer party.  I am sure I saw all of you there.  I was
wearing a t-shirt with the number 12 on it and blue jeans and black shoes. 
It was a totally killer party.  I do agree with most of you that were there
that it was a little too small for the number of tickets that they were
selling.  Anyway I had soo much fun there, and smiling and laughing for
hours on end, and just walking arround and waving to everyone.  :-) 
Anyway, I am looking forward to this weekend, sounds like a totally killer
parties (ubqutious and be here now)  Can't wait until the weekend.
Rave on brothers and sisters,
Eric
P.S.
Did anyone else hear the aliens at the party????    =)

 Well, officially, the full moon is tonight! ( Sunday ). Due to certain
events in my life, I've avoided going out at night. However, things have
changed - my father-in-law, after a long decline and illness, died last
Thursday. 

 If there is an outdoor full moon event tonight, I'd like to go to it, and
dance in his memory. If anyone knows, please drop me a line before 11PM.
I'll check my email then.

Hi all, 
	I was at Wyrd last night, and though perhaps a few too many for
the space, some beautiful people showed up and danced.  Thanks for keeping
the vibe positive all through the night.  I had the idea I should go out
to a rave one night all by my lonesome, and last night was the night.  I
knew I would not really be alone.  So many friendly people were present
and happy.  One question... The man with the drum and the man in the red
outfit (including hat) said some crazy and beautiful things to me.... 

		So, you in the red hat, with the quote "I am one with the
universe and I have more than I need."  YOu showed me another quote about
love in a book.  PLEASE send me the title of the book.

		THANKS,
			-Sana

Is it going to be a regular thing?

I've been meaning to check out the Monday nighter at Hi Fi: an
ambient/experimental thing. Maybe this week...

Hey everybody,
 Hope u all enjoy my adventurous weekend at a glance...

*matter <--- chants in primal jarble to summon meandering thought patterns...*

Friday
 Missed Meat Beat Manifesto at the Vic (Chicago). Also missed the *nice*
getogetha Gage (mw-raves) had in Urbana. Shucks.

Saturday
 Connected with hion (mw-raves) and his friend Neringa (nice girl)! Left my
house en route to Urbana, IL (about 3 hours south of Chicago). Was hoping 2
have been joined by some other friends, but alas... :(
 Went pretty much every way, but the right one. Ended up in Urbana around
10:00p. Chilled 4 a bit. Called 4 info on Quaint and almost died rolling on
the floor, trying to keep up with the 568 m.p.h. voice mail. Finally,
consumed a ton of sugar and pumped it up and called back, able 2 keep up w/
the spastic voice recording. Left for Bloomington around 11:00p... Had 2
stop at the grocery store. Found more PEZ whistles! Lisa, I forgot to give u
one, next time. ;) Maybe no big deal; I think the numbers are increasing.
Also included a form to order any dispenser (and flavors) your little heart
desires! ;) No web site listed, tho. (hit me w/ private e-mail if interested
in this info) Anyhoo, bought 3 of those nifty gadgets and proceeded to the
space.
 Pulled up in front of the "Machinists Lodge" in Bloomington (anyone 4
bingo?). Simple Space. No hassle at the door, at all. ;) Simple audio (two
'lil blocks) and lighting (a couple of nifty lights). Very friendly folk in
these parts -> made my night. Surely, one of the *nicest* vibes (yeas,
that's right, there was indeed a VIBE!), I have felt. 
 DJs 4 the evening were: slip, appollo, earache. Other's were scheduled, but
never got a chance to spin the wheels. All were good (it's all good) and
appollo really cleared the air with his down and dirty ghetto-house
"fu**ing, su**ing, nasty, s**t" ! However, I am glad that we transgressed
beyond that mind set (was nice to get it out in the open and move on) into
some really great "techno" ;) schtuff. :D BTW, the whistlers were in 'da
house once again! We had it goin' at least 3 of us... *nice*!
 Then 3:00a... 'Da man shows up and decides the fate of the event 4 the
evening. Needless 2 say: that was it, music down, lights up -> arrrgh! I
have been in "busts" b4, but with a vibe like this going, it is a real shame
when it has to end like that. I now truly understand RAGE! Thanks 2 bliss,
;) if u see this. Why do these moron's do this? We have no power against
them, we are no threat... I guess there r great numbers of ppl, who simply
do not understand PeaceLoveUnityRespect... ;(
 Played with Fractint (fractal generator) 4 a while; fun schtuff...
 Checked e-mail in the wee hours of Sunday am. After getting all of the
codes into my dialer, so I could call w/out incurring major charges at my
friends' place, I connected and lo and behold: another strange ppl meeting
thing happenned. Well, I just subscribed to sfraves and met a girlie in
Chicago, offa 'da sfraves list? Stranger things have happenned, but not by
much... ;)
 After a nice breakfast, Sunday am, left Urbana for the outer reaches of the
dead-end zone, west of Chicago. Rolled in around 8:00p, after taking another
adventurous "detour" home...

 Champaign/Urbana/Bloomington/Normal -> y'all have 'da shit comin' togetha!
Keep it on the upside and PLUR 2 y'all!

 Hion,Neringa,MikeyD,Gage,Tom,Hannah,Lisa,slap-me-4-those-I-missed, u all
know who u r -> major PLUR to all of you...

Here's some pointers to keep 'da man outta our sheeot!:

1] Don't ever post directions to your event, internet or printed: unless of
course you have diplomatic immunity and you own a large property, somewhere,
in which case there's a ton of promoters who really want 2 meet u!

2] Use checkpoints, maybe many, send 'em all over 'da place: confusion is
the best form of security.

3] May have 2 start refusing tix 2 ppl who ain't got it goin' on: I hate 2
suggest this, but it may be the only way, other than the secret-ravah
handshake... ;)

4] Stay quiet outside of indoor events

5] If 'da man tells u 2 turn it down...seems only logical to comply :D

6] use really small flyers. Distant Planet in Chicago was advertised on
poster-sized flyers (duh). If u make them really small, perhaps they will go
unnoticed.

7] Offer 'da man some $ for his troubles. Make a charitable donation 2 your
local authorities. Or better yet -> Police Fund-Ravers! :D That's it, talk 2
your local government officials about promoting the vibrant energy of your
local city, town or village. Invest in America=par-tay! ;)

coming up 4 me: Fiasco Revisited in Jacksonville, FL and Red Alert,
somewhere around Tuscon, Arizona, I believe... *following guidline #1,
listed above* ;)

well i went and saw this movie this evening ... trust me, if you aren't a 
HUGE Star Trek fan, don't go ... it was a very long episode of STNG  :)  
i enjoyed it once the storyline was established, which they managed to do 
in the first ten minutes - the rest was predictably spent solving two 
problems at once.

Watching Data experiencing uhhhh pleasures was rather funny :)  the Borg 
queen is quite the cyberbabe!

Well kidies, I knew it had to happen and it did.  I just got in to my
house in SoCal and I realized that I left my pillow :(  If you happened to
find that you suddenly had an extra black pillow case with two really flat
pillows inside that you found in the hottub room, drop me a line, wouldja?
:)
Once I've had some sleep and stuff, I'll write all the happy things that
have been running through my head about this _great_ weekend!  :)  Thanks
again to everyone for making it so special!

Hi StEvEo, sorry it's taken so long to get back to you...I've been sick &
I'm only getting to the last 4 1/2 days of e-mail now.  I hope you don't
mind that this reply is to the whole group, but where one person has a
question there are probably others, and maybe someone else will find
something here interesting and keep the thread going.  My comments follow
yours...

>From my studies I'd agree that linear thinking in Western culture began
about the time writing became widespread in ancient Greece, some 2,500
years ago.  I think you begin to see it with the pre-Socratics, who
diverged from the poets about the time the technology of writing began to
become widespread - and I don't think the connection between writing and
linear thinking is accidental.  There's a great book by Walter Ong called
"Orality and Literacy" which addresses the introduction of writing in
ancient Greece.  Ong builds a strong case for a transformation of
consciousness with the shift from an orally-based culture to one which is
literal, and this is precisely what occurred some 2,500 years ago in
Greece.  I mean, here you had a culture with a rich history which had been
passed down orally by the town poet/storyteller for centuries.  In such a
culture, auditory ideals auch as harmony and unity are primary, and the
medium by which the story of our people is transmitted is the sound of
one's voice.  The poet's job is to tell the stories of his people in such a
manner that they're relevant to the situation his people face at that time.
Then, with the introduction of writing new possibilities emerge, and
different priorities begin to take center stage.  Suddenly technical
analysis is possible.  Facts are verifiable.  Truths are reified.  Unity
and harmony are replaced by clarity and distinction.  The word, which was
evanescent, dissapearing into the void as quickly as it was spoken,
reminding all of the way of things, is now written down to be returned to
later.  The word begins to transcend temporality.  The word itself becomes
an object for analysis.  Homer and Hesiod mark the beginning of this
period, and their poetry was already influenced by these new
possibilities/priorities.  This opened the world of philosophy, and this in
turn made possible, two milennia later, the opening of the world of
scientific inquiry.

IMHO what made this second period (the scientific age) different from the
flowering of the Greeks is partly that the originality of Greek thought
came from the truth of their experience.  Words as objects (written words)
were relatively new, and the Greeks still lived in a mythic world of
connectedness to the natural world (and that of the Gods).  They gave names
to the phenomena of their lived experience.  By the time of Descartes,
philosophy, which the scholastics rediscovered about 1,000 years ago, was
becoming more and more an analytic linguistic practice divorced from the
phenomena for which the Greeks coined the terms in the first place.
Descartes arrived at a major transition point in the development of the
Western psyche, with the decline of church authority and the rise of a new
merchant class which needed to see itself as free and autonomous.  Descarte
embodied the new subjectivism with "I think, therefor I am" and set the
stage for the next 400 years of dualistic thinking.  Dualistic thinking had
been around, to be sure, before Descartes, but with his articulation of the
world of his age it took center stage and has remained there until this
century.  Mind/body, spirit/matter, inner/outter, etc., these led to all
sorts of philosophical conundrums which have occupied thinkers since his
time.  It's this dualistic thinking that is usually referred to when
someone uses the term "Cartesian."  Cartesian thinking is VERY seductive,
we all use it every day.  It is the langauge with which we communcate about
ourselves and our bodies.  "My body" and  "out-of-body" express a supposed
relationship with the body, and where there is relationship you have (at
least) a dualism.  Post-Cartesian thinkers largely use the successes of
Cartesian scientific inquiry (where science is subjects measuring objects
and where the basis for mind/body dualism has largely been destroyed in
this century) to show that while dualism might be possible (i.e., I CAN
experience myself as a subject in a world of objects) this is based upon a
more primordial, holistic ground in which it isn't really possible to
separate subject and object and all is just meaningful interaction (I think
of this in terms of great parties or the magical drum circles that form in
the rain forest near Olympia, WA, and others liken it to rock climbing or
certain athletic experiences), where the sense of self just melts away to
the unitary wholeness from which language made it spring in the first
place.

My point is that this holistic way of being-in-the-world is both more
primordial (as pre-linguistic and in all likelihood shared with other
animals) and more meaningful (as mythic and based upon your own
enaction/embodiement of your culture's heritage) than the
subjective/objective way of being-in-the-world within which we dwell so
much of the time, and to which we grant authority over our experience just
as the early Christians did to the church.  And I think this granting of
authroity is as unnecessary and ungrounded today as it was for the early
Christians.  I don't think we should expect science to tell us much about
what gives a life meaning or how to live our lives any more than I think we
should expect the church or any other "rational" authority.  But at  the
same time, I wouldn't turn to a shaman to tell me about the nature of
quarks.  Science has its domain, and inasmuch as we recognize that its
domain is limited in scope and that what answers we get depends upon the
questions we ask and the paradigm through which we interpret the facts, I
think it is a highly useful way of knowing.  My concern lies with the
dimminution of meaningful existence which I almost invariably find
coincident with the belief that science=knowledge about reality, and the
related belief that myth stands in opposition to truth.  Falsity, or
untruth, stands in opposition to truth.  Myths, OTOH, are something like
the condensed truths of a peoples through time - a cultural heritage.  As
such, they are valuable ways of knowing in and of themselves and not
something that stands in opposition to scientific facts.  To me, it's one
of the tasks of the present age to explore the mythos of the Western psyche
and to rediscover existential meaning as the foundation both for scientific
knowledge and for individuation, and to restore existential truth to its
primary position at the center of humanity's search for meaning such that
more children are able to grow up without losing their individuality and
their passion and resigning themselves to a position within the herd.

You're in no way out of line, and I really appreciate your candor in giving
me this feedback.  I'd worried about this myself in the last few days.  I
think perhaps the combination of a fever and far too much recent
philosophical training (at Cal=intellectual jousting), along with an issue
about which I am passionate took their collective toll in the last
exchange.  That old Cartesian ego still flares up, apparently all the more
so when its own reality is questioned by the one it thinks it is.  And
sometimes, try as I might, I find myself believing that that's who I am,
and acting in part on this basis even as I try to undermine its very
foundations.  I apologize to anyone I offended, especially Tony (who knows
where I'm coming from) and Starchild (who doesn't yet).  To quote James P.
Carse ("Finite and Infinite Games" - I highly recommend it to anyone and
everyone but most of all to all of you!), one-upping is a finite game (one
where the intent is to win) and what I really want to play is an infinite
game (one where the intent is to continue the play).  And sometimes the
infinite game is only kept going when another player reminds us that we've
slipped into playing that nasty finite game we were taught to play in
school.  Thanks, StEvEo.  And let's all play!

I really don't think they're helping the party...it's just an
acknowledgement.

[Unzipping my mouth]

Well, here's what I know about the situation.... These people have been
throwing parties for a long time... some of their parties went off, and
some you got royally screwed at their others.

But all I know is they got a secured location in Sac in the midle of
nowhere with lots of incredible stuff.

This party seems to be free with their only revenue coming from the 21+
bar that will be provided.

Their intention is for every 5th party that they throw from now on is 
to be FREE. Don't expect their other free parties to be like this....

I suspect this to be their "coming out" party, Let's just hope this is
the start of something good.

     have fun "moo-ing" in line,

             Terry

I would have to agree. It was fun just kickin back shootin pool. The music
was nice. We have to do that again. Whether it be at the HiFi or somewhere
else. It's alot of fun to get together on a lazy Sunday. The South Bay
people need to get together more often.

I've heard from a few people and Terry, and Jake are right. This first
party will be the one to goto. The other free parties probally won't be as
good, but you never know. Sometimes you have to give someone the benifiet
of the dought.

They probally have a deal with the owners of the space. I'm sure if you
give someone enough money for 4 parties, they wouldn't complain about the
5th one being free. They are probally using this first party to show the
space owners just how many people would show up if the party goes off.

I would check it out, in fact, I am. I'm going to go, either stay at a
friends in Sac or get a hotel room. I use to live in Sacramento and know
where it is at. If anything, I'll have a nice time in Sac.

Well I'm going to venture to Sacramento on friday to Ubiquitous. Great
lineup and nice space. It seems to me the promoters have good intentions.
So I plan on going. I have several friends in Sacramento since I use to
live there and also met more people from there so I could probally stay
with one of them. However, I might just get a hotel room to get back in. If
others are wanting to go from the City, maybe we all can get a Huge room
and share it. Bring some turntables and some VERY small speakers and enjoy
some toons before and after the party at the hotel. Some Hotel prices in
Sac or cheaper then out here so if we get a few people together it would be
really cool I think.

So if any of you want to go with me or caravan up to Sac with me, I'd love
the company and we could make it a wonderful trip. Let me know if anyone is
interested.

 Well, I went to sleep at 11:45 PM with the intention of waking up
early to log on and see if anything was happening - I had a good night's
sleep instead! 8AM now....

 I just called the number, and it seems to be at th park alongside
Candlestick/3COM ballpark. With rush hour traffic and such, I don't 
know if I could get there in time - park rangers probably rousted them
anyway...

 Oh yes ... thank you to all the folks who offered their sympathy on
the death of my father-in-law. I'll pass all your kind words on to my
wife Mary. Again, thanks.

How often I think the rave community has ample resources in the talent,
equipment, and fun attenders, dept.'s but hasn't developed its property
resources, placing limitations on our ability to bring together like-minded
party-goers.  Ideally, we would obtain some few acres on not too expensive
property and dedicate it the rave community. 

A common rave ground, if you will, where we could have some installations,
inside space, a 7-11 (just kidding), gardens, bathrooms, parking with
incentives for carpooling.  There would be no landlord or permit problems
for an owned facility.  I think our rave community is short of landholders
and real estate-minded persons, or else this problem would already have been
solved.  Is this an idle fantasy?  Maybe the rave scene is inherently too
variety-loving to settle into one permanent venue.

I don't know about the feasibility of it but I like the idea of "common rave 
ground. It seems that there has been several "Charity" and "fundraiser" 
benifits held for numerous reasons lately so what if several of the 
productions got together and started a group effort of throwing parties with 
the Idea that the profits would go into a bank account for the purposes of 
saving enough money to acquire the space. I'm sure if the right parties 
could agree on some arrangement it could be done. With numbers like $5,000 
on the benifit for omar on one party How long would it take (6 mos- 1 year)? 
A truly worthy endeavor I think.

That's an interesting point. In fact, ownership is the MOST important
factor in any type of cooperative or collective. Once you own land, you are
its master and are free to explore opportunities with much less impedence.
Our founding fathers (that sounds funny) knew that land equaled power and
encorporated this concept into the fundamentals of our beliefs. I went to a
conference for members of student cooperatives 2 years ago in Santa Cruz.
There was an old-timer co-op founder there. He had  list of 20 things you
could do to start a co-op and get it off the ground. Rule #1: buy the land.

I don't know, though if our 'collective' (loosley coined) likes to be tied
down as such. We are nomadic, spontaneous, resourceful, innovative,
sporatic. Part of our being is our desire to surprise and be surprised. How
long would we dance in one spot before we became tired of it and wanted to
search for new possibilities.

I've mentioned this alooong time ago and here's what I was thinking.

We need to get enough people together and have a few fund raiser parties or
any type of fund raisers to gather money to purchase a big piece of land
and have some buildings put up on it. Here's the catch, we would have to
have some people living on the land to keep it up and what not. Which for
some of us would be a great idea. We would also need a few people to act as
the landlords of this place. If we have a big enough spread of land we can
have a few warehouse type buildings or any type of buildings for that
matter and can have 2 or 3 parties going off at the same time as long as
there not too close together.

We would need some trust worthy people to take charge of this land as well
as some people to live on the land to keep it up and watch after it. There
are a lot of people here in the SFR community with a lot of different
skills ranging from doctors, computers, food service, electricians and
construction workers. I'm sure we can do this.

Yes, I sent email to sfraves about this. I'm planning on going up on Friday
and getting a big hotel room for Friday night and Saturday. Have alittle
pre-party get together at the hotel and bring some turntables and a very
small sound system, just enough to listen to and not very loud. Goto the
party and then after the party have alittle after party thing with some
chill toons or whatever and then crash out. When people wake up we can get
some food and maybe listen to some more music and people can either leave
or kick it there and look around Sacramento and stay at the room until
Sunday morning. I think it will be alot of fun. If we get enough people we
can get acouple of rooms. Getting the room friday night and saturday will
give us somewhere to hang before the party and then a place to sleep after
the party. which means if we get the room for Sat, we don't have to be out
until Sunday at 11am.   That's my plans.

I would love to do some checking on this issue. There is a lot of land that
can be bought out here in a decent area. We should start thinking serious
about this and maybe have some kind of meeting with everyone that is
interested in doing this. If we were to start now, we could probably get
some land by summertime, or at least by this time next year. This way there
will be no more wondering if we can find a space. We would need to have a
something productive coming from this land as well during the week whether
it be computer related or organic foods related or something. I'm all up
for this idea and would be willing to support it in anyway I can. This
would definitely bring us a lot closer.

After writing some of this and then reading the note from Alex, he has a
good point. As much as everyone would love to do this, how long would it be
before people got tired of it. We can keep improving the land to make it
different, but you can only do so much. What does everyone think of this
idea as a whole.

I'll agree that language and "advanced thoughts" are intimately related,
but I'm afraid Chomsky and his cognitivist approach to the mind simply
can't account for things such as the birth of language or the background of
understanding upon which language is based.  In fact, if you read George
Lakoff (Chomsky's former student, now on the faculty at Cal) and Mark
Johnson's work (at the University of Oregon), they show rather convincingly
that our primary conceptual schemas are born out of our early embodied
experiences, and that we use metaphorical elaboration to build ever more
complex conceptual schemas.  As infants we learn about things such as
direction, force, blockage, building, tearing down, up, down, inside and
outside.  This is all learned prior to language.  In fact, recent work with
infants has shown that even an understanding of the continuity of objects
and gravity is held by infants at 3 mos.  This does  not come from
language.  Rather, it is the ground upon which language is built.

It is unsurprising that the Romans would have such a saying.  The Romans
didn't create their mature language out of the phenomena of Roman culture.
Rather, they "borrowed" it all from the Greeks without care for the
phenomena which gave the Greeks to name these words in the first place.
This is the first setting-adrift of thought, the cutting off of language
from its roots which many are trying to overcome in this "postmodern" age.
Certainly a large part of learning a new subject is learning names.  This
makes sense in a system built upon the Roman educational system as handed
down through the medieval Christian church.  But I'd submit that the great
thinkers of any age are those who are paying attention to the phenomena of
their age and articulating those phenomena in such a manner that the
language is made richer.  What is poetry or literature?  It isn't the
regurgitation of remembered words - this might be what Time magazine or the
evening news do, but literature expands the language, and allows the rest
of us to see something we might never have seen before.

Wow Jim, I have some trouble with this.  I think I see where you're coming
from, though I think this statement is much stronger than supported by the
evidence.  Cats paint, yet possess no conceptual knowledge of the cognitive
sort you are speaking of here.  And children are more creative than most of
us.   This statement is more appropriately limited to the domain of
conceptual knowledge such as theories.

And of course people could never see the patterns at all if they weren't
there as phenomena to be named.  Goedel's incompleteness theorem (see Tony
on this one!) shows that logic is necessarily incomplete.  Non-linearity is
simply a correction to a couple of millenia of linear thinking and the
recognition that linear thinking isn't enough, just as Euclidian geometry
wasn't enough.  This doesn't mean that Euclidian geometry or linear
thinking are useless, or that imagination and creativity should reign
supreme over knowledge (which still needs to be defined) and logic, but it
does suggest that these limits should be recognized and taken into account.

Knowledge is generally held to be justified true belief.  I doubt whether
we really want to restrict consciousness to justified true belief.  I think
perhaps what you mean to say here is awareness, not knowledge.  If that's
what you mean then I agree 100%, as would, I take it, most buddhist and
other contemplatives.

I just posted a long-winded suggestion to the group, but I really want 
 to address an important issue and that is the legality of a venue.  
 What happens if someone od's, dies, or gets hurt?  That's the beauty 
 of Burning Man, it was man against nature w/o specific liability but 
 they had covered all possibilities in the event of any accidents.  And 
 even now, BM is going through growing pains.

If a group were to own land and not address the possibility of these 
 issues, I could easily see the government cracking down on holding 
 events while an investigation on a wrongful death, drug use, etc. is 
 conducted.  Look at some night clubs and their owners and what they 
 have to go through.

And worst of all, in California, ravers may not be sue happy but very 
 upset parents could be and that would ruin the whole spirit of the 
 _intention_ of the venue.  There needs to be a concise mission 
 statement and understanding of risks involved in a proposal before 
 investors put their money down...hence my suggestion of a 
 community-based non-profit.  Even then, there'd be a tough road to 
 pave but I also believe that it's good that we're discussing it...a 
 seed thought or astral projection has to eliminate negative blocks 
 (thoughts) to flow more easily.

Just playing the devil's advocate,
Diane

i'm all for it. some sort of raver collective sounds like an excellent
idea, and i'm sure we could set up some sort of computer consulting / web
design business or whatever... a number of people might be able to live
and/or work there, we might even consider the possibility of making it a
"traditional" live-off-the-land collective also...

anyway, count me in.

Well hey, it feels like wensday already....

What a wonderful weekend.  Friends, family, dancing and trancing, I'm
suprised my body can accept the punishment I put it through.

Friday-  Stompy.  Talk about HOUSE!   The SF house scene is alive and
very well.  Many clubgoers were out there, not too many scenesters,
however.  I did manage to find a few friends I thought I lost in the
past years.  Gruuving to some progressive house tunes, left @ 3:30 due
to my company not being able to "hang" @ such a late of an hour.

Saturday-  Arrived @ Ameba @ 12:00.  "GASP!" Sold Out!  well, I knew
where the local was but I didn't want to crash it.  Ended up at Acme Jr.
anyways, and,  after slipping past the guard (thanks Crusty, MAR, and
Co.)  Managed to get in becuz of some way cool door people *Smooches*,
Bless ya gals.   
The location, I've been to twice.  
The first time I thought, "What a stinky, overcrowded, deathtrap."
This time around I'd have to say...
"What a nice beautiful stinky overcrowded deathtrap!!"
The people were sooo positive despite the crowded atmosphere, I ran into
sooo many faces that I haven't seen in months to years...   But, the
music was what kept me from conversing (as usual).  Dancing and dancing
through Ethans and Deaks set.  (does anyone else think that Deaks has
mixing background from the old skool hip-hop scene, that's the last time
I remember hearing that kind of transforming...).   
I lasted until 7 am or so since I had some errands to do Sunday morning.
 Finally spun out at 11:30 for a few hours and spent the remainder of
Sunday wrekkerd shopping.  
A perfect end for a fab weekend...

Jim,

As I've mentioned to many in the past, forming a collective of 
 organizers leasing/buying/renting  a legit venue on a full-time basis 
 is a viable option.  If it's a non-profit collective with a board of 
 directors, as part of the proposal/permit process the group could show 
 the city and county officials that it's supportive to the community 
 including youth and diverse cultural activities.  By being a community 
 based project, it should qualify for arts & youth grants and it could 
 actually take "raving" into a different light.  Of course, daytime 
 activities should include health, fitness, diet, and awareness of 
 alternative options of inducing trance dancing among other things and 
 perhaps art exhibits/multimedia events.

The bottom line is that to make this happen, one needs to prioritize 
 what's important for a rave/dance and emphasize these merits while 
 also acknowledging the downsides but offering solutions or alternative 
 educational activities to avoid the bad rap raves have had.  This can 
 be construed as the end of what raving represents or a sell out but 
 there will always be renegades and underground parties.  And if part 
 of the scene wants to avoid hassles, massive payoffs, etc.  then there 
 has to be a certain maturization and recognition of the need for 
 cultural "initiations" that part of the scene offers.

If one looks at some offshoots of what happened in the 60's there are 
 collectives that own land and conduct their own gigs...privately (e.g. 
 Wavy Gravy's Camp WinnaRainbow, Venture, Esalen, etc.).  If one were 
 to run a for-profit organization, then the owners would be _liable_ 
 for any mishaps or legal entanglements in a much more specific way 
 than a non-profit would, hence my suggestion for a non-profit.  Jason 
 (from ComeUnity) once told me about the Mind Gym in the UK which 
 catered to health (mental and physical) in the daytime and had parties 
 at night.  I've explored some 24-hr Nautilus-type gyms but never have 
 explored the legal aspects of running a night club.  I suspect that to 
 avoid additional hassles, one would not want an alcohol permit...but 
 one should explore the possibilities of allowing potential renters to 
 serve alcohol like many do at community centers (usually a one-day 
 liability insurance policy is required).

Lastly, I just want to add, that as part of my vision a while back, I 
 thought particular organizers would want to make up the collective and 
 each one would have XX amount of Friday nights and XX amount of 
 Saturday nights per year so there wouldn't be any question of one 
 group having too much influence in the collective.

So, yeah, if you explore this idea further, I'm interested if it were 
 run as a non-profit.  I, personally, wouldn't invest in a for-profit 
 organization that would set itself up for potential legal risks.

Thank you everyone for such a wonderful weekend and such a great party.
Special thanks goes out to following for bringing thier records and gear and
creating the sounds for the weekend: SteveO, Mei-Lwun Yee, Marcus, Andy,
Toby Egan, Joseph Brown, Uncle Noah, Derek, Jonathan Mark Logan, My partner
Eric in RE:, Mark Camp from Astronout, and Troy Sheets from Artage.  These
people all gave outstanding performances, and I for one was quite pleasantly
suprised at the talent from all the dj's.  All of them are totally worth
hearing so check them out if you get a chance.  In scheduling the time slots
I only looked at the style of music they played and tried to create some
sort of continuity from that.  The whole party went smoothly, with excellent
communication among the dj's so that I never had to tell anyone to play or
stop playing.  I actually lost the list on Friday, and didn't remember who
was supposed to play when.  It was all good though cuz the dj's all knew
thier part and played it well.  Perfect perfect perfect.

Thank you sooooo much to all of the people who helped with the decorating.
The cabin was completely transformed, and completely ravable.  If only the
owners could have seen what you did to thier cabin :)   The disco ball was a
nice touch.

Thank you eveyone who donated gear: Toby, Eric, and Mark Camp. (I hope I got
everyone in there).  With out you, well it just couldn't have happened.

Thanks to Annon and Shawna for singing and reading poetry during our
set...it was beautiful.

Thank you Troy Sheets for reminding me what true minimal ambient was, and
how really cool it could be.  One analogue synth and an effects box...it was
beautiful folks.

Thank you everyone who stayed to help clean on Sunday.  

Extra super specialicious thanks to all those who helped carry gear up and
down the 500 feet of stairs and walk way.  May you all attain full
enlightenment in this lifetime.

Dinner was great as well, with everyone fixing what ever they were at
various times and just putting it on the table for everyone.

And ofcourse thank you SteveO for all your time and effort in putting this
whole thing together and coordinating the money stuff.  You da'Man.

I believe everyone had a wonderful time....especially that small group in
the upstairs bedroom ;)  That door should have had a warning sign on it.
Make a note for the next one.

This was my kinda party.

This idea was discussed some time ago on sfraves...so you might want to
search the archives as to what was discussed, problems encountered etc.

If I remember correctly the problems were who owns the land, who is
responsible for it (liability etc.), who throws parties (if one group wants
to throw a party on this date and this other group of people do to, who
gets the site).

how about making a corporation so that liability is not an issue and
ownership can be passed on.  Shares can be given to those that contribute
the money?

I am an accounting student about to graduate (spring, 97) and I work for a
CPA so I can research any issues that come up nad will attempt to help in
any way I can.

Sounds like an exciting venture!

Ok, here's the scoop.

I've got 14-1/2 hours of music from the Cabin.  I started recording at 
approx. 5pm on Saturday all the way till around 7am on sunday morning.  
It would take me for EVER to dub all those tapes.  So what I thought I'd 
do is take them to a Tape Duplicating place to get copies made.

Before I can figure out a price for a set of tapes, I need to know how 
many people would like copies.  The more people that order tapes, the 
cheeper it will be.

so, if you'd like the music from the cabin, please send me an Email.

thanxs!

-M

ps - anyone know of a good inexpensive tape duplicating house? :)

     ********************************************* 
     Some Theories on the Sacramento Free Party... 
     *********************************************
     
     THEORY 1
     The Great Gods of Big Mudda Parties... Cool World, have come back to 
     try to lure us into thinking they're vibe enough to spend $20 bucks on 
     for their New Years shindig...
     
     THEORY 2
     Sacramento is a great untapped Mecca of raving.  Cool World is working 
     with local Adidas, Nike and Fila vendors is a benign takeover of the 
     youth of our fair state's capital city.  At $50 for a pair of three 
     stripe pants... wow.
     
     THEORY 3
     Pete Wilson discovered some spare money floating around the finances 
     at that big domed building, and he's giving it back to the people by 
     throwing a good ol' hootenanny.
     
     THEORY 4
     Television just isn't having the same impact it used to anymore.  
     There's just so much crap going on subliminally that people are now 
     numb to sublim TV messages.  So they have to increase the ambient 
     volume to be able to increase the volume of the messages... hmmmm.
     
     THEORY 5
     Some lightbeings have gotten together and in an effort to let people 
     know that we can be good to each other without alterior motives, are 
     organizing a gathering so boys and girls of strong minds and honest 
     hearts can meet one another.  Elevate yourselves to the purity of your 
     birth, and then add your collected wisdom from the day you died...(*) 
     
     THEORY 6
     The heat will be 125 Farenheit, and the Lower Hades water booth will 
     be open all night with $15 water.
     
     THEORY 7
     This is the rave that the Road Rules people end up in... look out for 
     the MTV camera crew!
     
     THEORY 8
     Brought to you by Budweiser (There's Two E's in every BudwEisEr), 
     Pepsi (The OG smart drink), Coke (For Washing Shrooms Down, Coke is 
     it!), Sprite (Image is Nothing, But Don't We Look Cool?), Tommy 
     Pullmyfinger for the Exclusive (I spent so much money on clothes, now 
     I go to free parties exclusively), Blow Pops (Suck on this), and 
     Evian (Evian is Naive spelled backwards and that's okay).
     
     THEORY 9
     Somebody has to get rid of an awful lot of bunk E...
     
     THEORY 10
     Don't say okay if a girl asks you if you want a lapdance.  Just 
     cherish well your thoughts and keep a tight grip on your booze.
     
     THEORY 11
     The aliens keep getting their guidance systems fucked up when they try 
     to abduct near the SF area due to a highly potent "vibe" energy field. 
      So they figured Sacramento wouldn't have that problem (I live in San 
     Jose... I can joke about this , no?).
     
     THEORY 12
     Maybe sometimes those big promoters figure they can get more people into 
     the scene by throwing an occasional free party.  This probably isn't bad 
     for anybody, and it's this type of thing that makes parties work.  Go, 
     you've earned it.
     
     Honestly, if money is a factor, and there's nowhere else you'd kick 
     yourself for not going to (which it currently appears is the case), it 
     sounds like a great idea.  And I hear in a recent survey of DJ's named 
     Ghost, Ghost was picked as the number one DJ.  I'll probably end up 
     going to check out DRC and Dutch if nothing else is going on.  And 
     that communal hotel thing doesn't sound like a bad time...
     
     *****************
     Weekend in Review
     *****************
     
     Friday Night...
     Goa Goa Goa at the Ceiba Records Lunarseed party thingy.  Listened to 
     uh... Goa!.  Really burnt out from partying Thursday.  Venue was same 
     as the venue used for Wyrd, just one night earlier (I love how time so 
     often keeps two different chunks of mass from occupying the same 
     space).  Sweaty, hot, humid.  Danced for a little while.  Spoke with 
     some HELLA special people.  Yoko, you jam eternal.  Met Chin and a 
     couple other listers... Plotted with Mic*doh*.. Dan.  Finally felt 
     like my plug was unplugged... And stand back... this is GROSSSSSSS.
     
     I laid down on the phunk sweat soaked floor and slept.
     
     Caban (Kaban?  uh... the guy with the big fro from CCC) was mental.  
     Well motivated, driven, epic, beautiful, hard, scary, trippy, 
     inspiring psychadelic trance.  And I heard him play something new to 
     me... a glimpse of a brighter future... breakbeat goa (Yeah!!!!!).  A 
     lot of goa DJ's tend to play it really safe, and it was nice to hear 
     someone who had their technical shit together, and also had a 
     statement and a journey in mind.
     
     The CD was cool, despite the "known" blemish.  Way better than 
     throwing it away.
     
     Went back to the SanJosean zone with Ben and Dhiren and Loren (and the 
     other people who are regrettably in the "I really liked those nameless 
     folk" category, especially the guy with the light box)... too much killer 
     conversation.
     
     With our love, we could save the world if they only knew...
     
     Saturday:
     Slept during raving hours despite will to go to Wyrd (hella tired).  
     After spending and exhausting Friday in the Stevenson alley Acme 
     (that's a really epic observation whoever you were), didn't really 
     want to go.  And thats also where they threw CHI, the last ProSoy 
     party I went to.  Glad to hear everybody had a good time though... was 
     there a space where people could chill?  As I fell asleep around 
     2:00am I smiled thinking about you all...
     
     Sunday:
     Bought bizarre crap in back room at Ameoba after sleeping all day.
     
     This weekend, I will fill the batteries before I go out.  I have no 
     intention of having a quiet weekend.  It's time to give thanks for the 
     last year... and it's been a damn good year.
     
     Peace,
     AndyW
     
     P.S.       To those of you who think it's funny to just throw out gum 
     at a party when it's tasting stale... I sat in your gum on Friday, and 
     I think you suck and live your life without regard for others while 
     preaching love and unity.  Please fold it up in some stiff paper (like 
     those groovy flyers all over the  floor), or put it inside a spent 
     water bottle or *egads* throw it away in a trash can.
     
     
     It's so weird explaining to my roommates that I MEANT to put my cords 
     in the freezer.

Hello! The organizational meeting tonight for saturn5 is still
happening, and as promised, I have scheduled a time for it. The
meeting will be held in San Francisco, starting between 8 and 8:30.

The meeting will be at my apartment at 11th and Mission. For the exact
address and directions, you can call 415-215-8269 (voicemail).

Please note that unlike the last gathering at our apartment, this one
won't be a dinner party. However, Diana's Monday Night Dinner is still
going on as usual if you're looking for food with a fun social
atmosphere.

Hopefully the meeting should not take too long, and since we are a
couple of blocks from the Bahia, you could easily walk over to Mad
afterwards. 

So I hope to see you all tonight! This will be the best Thanksgiving
holiday that the Bay Area has ever seen, and your help and energy
will only make it better! :)

Steve

Subject: saturn5 meeting for Thanksgiving!


This Monday, November 25th will be the organizational meeting for
Thanksgiving, the first ever party to be put on by saturn5! If you are
interested in helping out (clean-up, door, etc.), providing any sort
of decoration/visuals, or anything(!!!) then please come to the
meeting :)

The theme of Thanksgiving is the notion of community and family, and
this party will be a big success if we _all_ put our creative energies
and hard work together! So if you have something to contribute, we
would love to have you as part of the crew!!!

The meeting will be at my apartment in San Francisco, which is right
off of the freeway in the beautiful South of Market area. Chai will
probably be served as well.

I haven't set the time yet, but probably later on in the evening, since I
don't get home from work until around 7:30 or so anyway...

Thanks, and hope to see you on Monday!

Steve

  It was at this lady's place in Stevenson's alley.....one *hell* of a
spot!! There were suppose to be 500 tickets sold for this, but it started
filling up in the downstairs chill room pretty damn fast, so I think they

     i am from the 24th century.  i was born in 2371 in New San Franscisco. 
      (for those of you who don't know what New San Francisco is, well, it

  Well, I'm 17 also, as is my girlfriend.
  It seems there are lots of young folks at parties, but most of them 
don't seem particularly interested in the scene.  Of course, I may be

I would think and hope this is the real reason. From what I've heard, the
people putting this on are good people. They are NOT you typical massive
bad vibe promoters. They have good intentions. So I'll give them that.
Besides if it doesn't go off we can all go back to the hotel and party
there. Have turntables and mixer and small little sound system, plenty of
records and if someone wants to bring a CD player that would be cool.

DRC and Dutch are two I'm going to check out and Simon, Spun and Rick

" Friday-  Stompy.  Talk about HOUSE!  "
---------

It's really funny how you say this.
 My friend Dave Chapman (Top Ace ravEr, 5 years) went to this party. He
said that the HOUSE music gotta little bit out of hand for awhile. He said
it was "Glammor house" in his words there..
 Did you have fun though?  I wanted to go, but then I didn't, then I did.

 <<I want to go,,, but I don't feel like going>>

Subject: and this is what happened to me on saturday night <nrr>
Sender: sfraves-owner@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

So it's Saturday night, and me and the boys are hanging out in this club
down in North Beach, acting like fools.  Me, I'm out on the dance floor
mackin on the ladies, cause I know that's what they like.

My boy Slider is over there in the corner swiggin whiskey straight out the
bottle, trying to keep it all low-key so the bouncers don't start trippin.
And then my man Duke, he's over there gettin goofy on the dj, cussin at him
and telling him to scratch the record.  Duke likes getting all stupid like
that on the dj's, like going up to Jeno and pronouncing his name
fonetically just to get him all riled up. Like, "Hey, ain't you dj Gino?"
That's the kind of punks we are when we go out catting on a Saturday night.


So right now Duke's hanging over by the dj booth, pushing the dj around,
callin him a softy and telling him to play something you can freak the
ladies to.  Except I'm not even paying attention to that, 'cause I'm the
kind of guy who can freak the ladies to just about anything.  I got talents
like that.  Hip-hop, trip-hop, be-bop and blues, you name it.  Which is
exactly what I'm doing where this story begins.  Course, the ladies gotta
play all coy when I start with the hip grinds; they make faces and move
away on the dance floor, but I know that's the kind of catNmouse game they
like to play when I start pulling the boomerang tricks out my sleeve.

So later on I'm in the can, and Slider slid in after me.   That's how come
we call him Slider, cause he's always sliding around like his sneakers were
made out of greased moose poop. Foaming at the mouth, eyes wild, Slider
burst in saying, "Boomerang, we gotta ship on out!  Everyone's talking
about how you've been getting fresh with this girl, and her boyfriend's a
judo expert, looking to use you as a punching bag!"

"Eep!" said I.  "Time to make like a bakery truck and haul buns outta here!"

 Duke was still dancing on top of the speakers in the main room, and Slider
dragged him down, cussin and fussin about how he wasn't ready to go yet.
Then the three of us, slick like we are, made a move toward the bar, and
ducked out the fire exit before anyone saw us.

Well, wouldn't you know it, the door slammed shut behind us, and standing
there in the rain are these three cats, these three big, nasty looking
jacks,  ready to brawl.

"Aw, shucks, fellas,"  said I with dignity.  "Looky here:  I'm a lover, not
a fighter.  Now me and the boys were just having fun in there--"

"This is between you and me, kid,"  said the big guy, the judo expert.

I remembered old Grandpa Fidget once told me that if you're gonna get
whupped,  you might as well make the first punch, because that might be the
only one you get.  And so I swung at the kid, which was pretty dumb,
because he ducked, and then kicked me in the mouth.

"Ouch!"  thought I, and the kid jumped on me.  Then he got me in one of
these super judo half charley pretzel nelson double chicken wing leg-bender
holds, the kind where there's legs and arms all over the place and you
don't know your arse from jupiter.  So we rolled around in the mud puddle,
arms and legs all twisted and wrapped up like we were in a lovers' embrace,
except I don't think this guy wanted a kiss, if you catch my drift.

So just when I was fixing to die, me and the judo guy flipped over, and I
saw this crotch in my face.   I thought, "Man, I know going for the groin
is kinda cheatin, but I don't have a choice!"

Problem was, my arms and legs were tied up all over God's creation--one leg
behind my back, the other wrapped twice around my own neck, one arm going
north and the other going south --I looked like a knot tied by a sailor on
belladonna.

So I just closed my eyes and pretended like I was sitting down to a chicken
dinner at Mama Fidget's house, and chomped my teeth down on that crotch as
hard as I could.

And then, wouldn't you know it, within a matter of seconds, I was up on my
feet, and all you heard was  Whap! Pocka-Crunch-Packa-Poof!  That's why
they call me Boomerang--I always come back atcha.  So my nemesis was
starry-eyed on the pavement, body succumbed to gravity, but mind heading
out into orbit.

Now his buddies,  I guess they saw what this old boy was made of, so they
politely stepped aside, and allowed Slider and Duke and me to exit the
alley.

Out there in the street, the boys were drop-jawed in amazement, hooting and
hollering about my victory.   "Gaw-jeez, Boomerang,"  said Duke.  "How'ja
do it?"

"Well,"  said I, a tad sheepishly.  "I guess I never realized how much
strength I had until I bit my own dinkle."

That was me. I was walking around all night Friday and Saturday night
welcoming everyone to "The New ACME" and having a good old time at it, too!
Then I came home Sunday AM and posted it to SFR where I was met with much
agreement.

Hey, I've got an idea -- maybe we can cram 1200+ people in there for New
Year's? No?! :-)

Subject: Raising $$ 4 raving
Sender: sfraves-owner@hyperreal.com

Hello sfraves,

        I have thought about how to raise some $ to either buy land or a
warehouse before. I have come to the conclusion that although it seems like
a cool idea, I feel it would not be all that benifitial to the raving
community. The land/space would get played out, and that is a big risk to take. 
        
        Right now it is so hard to throw parties. We can't get permits in
most cities, and in the cities that we can, it costs to much. I think a
better goal to raise money towards is the changing of the laws
(dancing/entertainment) in S.F. In '93 the mayor and the police chief began
to reinforce "2am" law for people under 21. This basically states that if
you are under 21 you cannot dance after 2am. This is still in effect. For
instance, who many of you went to the Chem. Bros/ Meat Beat show? I did. And
I got booted out onto the streets of S.F. at 2am. (I am only 20 yrs old)
This really pisses me off! I don't understand why if I can vote, if I can
(have to) pay taxes, and if I can have all of the responcibilities that a
21+ person can have, why I can't dance after 2am?!?!?! This idea seems absord!

        I know that at the "Unity" party mettings, a fund was discussed,
which would go towards getting the laws changed. I think this would be a
better venture than buying land or a warehouse. By buying land, all we are
doing is avoiding the current laws that are practiced. Laws are made to be
changed. We don't live in a fixed system. We need to change things, not
avoid them. If we raise enough $ together, we can change any law in the
book! All it takes is $, it's a sick thought, but it is true. We need $ and
signatures, that's all. Hmmm. If any of you, want to help with this
situation, we should have a metting, seriously! Please respond privatly.

Peace, love and harmony to all!!!

Hello,

I'd like concur with Dave Chapman's sentiment regarding Stompy Stomp.  I
too attended (as I've been doing so regularly) and was disappointed not
so much in the party as a whole but in the music.  The DJ was Victor
Simonelli and as I recall, he spoiled another Stompy party for me a
couple months back with his incessant mix of glammy, gospelly, diva-ish,
light, vocal, commercialized house.  Some of his records, I felt,
weren't even good enough to receive commercial radio airplay.  I kept
wondering throughout the night, 'Doesn't this guy know the meaning of
DEEP?'  I mean, at Stompy parties I'm used to heavy, slammin' bass and
deep often jazzy grooves unlike at any other SF parties, which, for a
true House fanatic really pleased me. Unfortunetly, Markie Mark (who
ended the evening) followed with similar programming so my hopes for
good get-down boogeying to the real House music that I know and love
were never realized...
Oh well, but in defense of Stompy the party, I'd like to say that most
people I spoke to were not very satisfied with the sounds either but
were insistent on keeping up the good vibe and partying well anyway. 
I've always liked Stompy Stomp for the brand of sounds that these
parties bring to SF, not so much progressive as is the popular house
genre.  I recall reading in XLR8R something that I completely agreed
with when describing Stompy Stomp.  "Get ready to be educated in the
realm of HOUSE".  Too bad I wasn't further educated this past Friday. Oh
well, but I haven't given up hope!!  I'd still check out Stompy and
would continue to recommend to other Househeads.

Cheers,

G

Because dancing is pagan, and it's immoral towards our god-fearing society.  It might lead you to drinking beer 
and smoking cigarettes and possibly even fornication out of wedlock!  It also might even make you enjoy life 
more and keep you in shape! can't have that. 

count me in on the fight for my younger friends to dance whenever the hell they want.

I appreciate everyone's suggestions on this topic.  Here are a few more.

If there was a cooperative, we could "sell" memberships which entitle one to
admission. Admission ticket sales to non-members could be split between
event organizers and the co-op (to support expenses such as utilities, and a
mortgage).  I think an office and resident manager would be appropriate to
facilitate maintenance and scheduling.

If there was a cooperative agreement, a legal contract, it would best to
keep rave out of the name (Dance Parties Unlimited?).  Let's buy the former
site of the Ken Keysey retreat on the Peninsula, should be some good vibes
there!   

Also, you are correct in saying we have a lot of resources in terms of
people who could put it together.  Let me mention a couple of professions
which would be crutial in starting up: a lawyer and real estate type. 

More ideas, anyone?  Anyone know someone who might DONATE property (perhaps
to avoid a capital gains tax upon sale or as a charitable write-off against
other tax liabilities)

Has anyone come down with mono lately?  My roommate is currently
succumbing to it, and we were wondering if we could trace its origin to
some party in the recent past.

Given the activities that transpire at raves, I wouldn't be surprised if
mono could explode in the scene if we weren't careful. 

Be warned!

I find Orbital's "In Sides" very political.

indeed!

actually it's not the kissing that puts us at risk -- the mono bug is in
the air everywhere -- but the drugs and the sleep deprivation both depress
your immune system, which is the most important factor leading to mono.

i've never had mono, but find myself getting colds more often since i've
been raving.

take care of yourselves!

i might add, for those who may not know, it's like a mat that you sleep on,

Hey everyone, 

Audio Impact is on the run....

>From greed and excessive bullshit.

Turns out the management at the Cocodrie got greedy and wanted us to PAY
for 3 (cout 'em, 3!) security Goons, in addition to an outrageous bar
guarantee.

Sorry. No dice.

What's up with these bar owners? Do they go to school to be assholes, or
what?

Audio Impact will be renegade until we can get a secured venue. That is,
we'll be shifting locations as we get 'em. Dec. 4th might happen or
might not. We're working on it. Stay in touch and we'll try and let
everyone know as soon as possible what's going on.

If anyone would like to call the Cocodrie and "inform" them they've made
a mistake, feel free to give them a ring at 415-905-4447.

In the mean time, call the BASS Kru Voice mail for daily reports from
the field...  :)

See ya at MAD!

J-

So, have any of you received that big ol' 8 page flyer for Coolworld in the
mail yet?  

Yikes!

This is indeed the very biggest flyer I've ever seen!  Broadcast live on the
internet all over the world from the Henry J. Kaiser Convention Center.  

Yikes!

Live 105 dj's, a secret sex room, tickets $35 at Bass Tickets, 15,000
people, tickets on sale all over the state, directions to the party from
Southern California.  They even have a Travel Line to arrange hotel
accommodations if you're traveling from afar!  They even have an 800 number
to dial if you're coming in from outside California!  There's even a VIP
lounge for the really hip & with-it folks.  And a rooftop spacecraft landing
site for aliens.  

Ack.

If I could get in for free somehow, and I wouldn't be wasting New Year's Eve
to do it, and there wasn't anything better to do that night, I would
probably actually go & check this out just to see what the hell goes on.
It'd have to be a regular fucking three ring circus in there!  

Anybody here going?  If so, they tell you to bring your compass in case you
get lost!

Love,
Shawna

I'm still a little tired, but I slept a little more last night, so I think
I can write a fairly coherent post here... :)

First off, I forgot to tell Troy that Dennis Barton says hello.  :)

Okay, I said this to Joe when we were driving home and it's the 100%
truth.  We walked into a house full of folks we didn't know and walked out
of a house full fo friends.  The vibe was so thick in that place that you
could almost hold it in your hands like a piece of Jell-o from a
childrens' wading pool.
I really didn't know what to expect, to tell you the truth.  I missed the
other cabin parties and I have been away from the list for so long, I
didn't even know if anyone would remember who I am.  When I found out I
was slotted for 12-2 I got really scared and decided to re-work the set...
Pretty much, I packed up and held on tight.
Saturday afternoon was so much fun, spinning random 80's electro stuff
(anyone else like the Art of Noise?) and getting to know the folks that
were around.  I didn't realize the game room was out there, or I would've
been playing air hockey... oh well...
By the time evening started setting in, I was already feeling the vibey
bonds growing stronger and stronger.  The decorations were awesome and
everyone seemd to really be in the mood for a good time.  I was really
getting into the groove with the evening sets and I had tons of fun
talking to everyone, playing games (Like Abalone and Sets!) and being
freaky in general (and sometimes getting photographed in the process...
;)....)
By about 11.40 I was totally stressed out and I didn't know if I could
make it through the set.  When the first crossfade went poorly, I really
got rattled (I apologize for that one, but the crossfade on the tape is
good :P)

So I took a deep breath and reflected, remembered a few Taoist meditations
and went back at it.  Then I noticed Joe starting to have fun ;)  That did
it for me right there.  Everyone dancing with me seemed really into the
stuff, even when I went to the new school electro, folks seemed to be
understanding my vibe.. I was really really happy.  :)
When I brought the tapes around, I was a little worried because so many
folks were over on the couches and blankets, but to my surprise, they were
almost all awake and grooving to the vibe from over there!  I was blown
away!
The rest of the evening was just amazing.  I was dead tired, and the
grooves kept my in a happy place.  The IDM set was especially interesting
to me, since I hadn't heard that stuff very much.. I liked it!  The live
stuff really got me going... I found myself awake with my eyes closed and
in a strange REM/alpha wave state where I was actively dreaming with the
music, but I wasn't actually asleep... really really fun stuff, folks.  :)

Sunday came a little too quickly, and I had to bug out to catch my plane
from Sacramento back to Orange County.  All day I have been at work
reflecting on the experience and have had this happy smile and warm spot
in my heart.  I feel bad that I won't be raving with you folks again for a
little while, but I promise that the next time I come up I will let you
know!  

Thanks to all of you who helped keep my personal vibe up, and thanks for
those who helped pamper my buddie, Joe!!!  He told me that he feels so
loved and welcome in the scene now!!  Look for him at parties in the
future!!!

Okay, lastly it's the BSP:
I'll have my new mixtape "Beyond the Process" ready in a few weeks...
sadly it won't be free, but I promise it will be fun!!!  If anyone thinks
they might be interested, let me know :)

Thanks again everybody!!!  You are all superstars to me!!!

I completely agree with you... and I've come to the conclusion that
Hipocrasy is the thing 
this country is based on (meaning as in Politicians and all). :( 
Where I come from, (and most of the rest of the world) its legal to drink at
16, dance at 16 etc..
most countries you are a COMPLETE adult at 18... :(

I'm 19 myself...and i hate feeling like a kid when I hang out with me 21+
friends... [*sigh*]

>count me in on the fight for my younger friends to dance whenever the hell
they want.

Same here...

BTW.. If I sound like an asshole don't mind me.. I'm not really..I'm just
not good with emails. or
 I say things that I don't mean.. I dunno.

It was pretty cool.
Johnothan Franks(or whatever) is a pretty good director.  But it is easy to
tell by the movie that he would be better off directing T.V. stuff.
I liked the movie though. And I think that a non trekker kinna weirdoe
might like it too.
But any true trekker geek knows that; first contact was before the warp
ship flight.

Anybody remember the secret sex room at GAiA?
I swear to you. This room was pitch black. You couldn't even see the flames
on your lighter it was so dark!

 No problems my friend! I know that more than once I've tasted shoe 
leather on this list.  ;)  It is part of the learning process in 
communnicating (IMO). Fortunately most folks on this list understand 
that. Not only do most people try to be understanding but many are honest 
enough to let you know what they think. Invaluable feedback.


peace,

Vince and Marcy and I may go to go see our friend Steve Masters spin there
on NYE.

But that's not our real plans for the evening -- we're going to a
soon-to-be-announced underground party for most of the night.

I immediately read this purchase as the launch of "Superstar DJ Wayne."

Hand in there!!!

Yes, club and bar owners are collectively a pretty lowly bunch.  I always
expect them to screw me over.

At any rate, you got a good thing going.  I wish you the best of luck and
relatively low stress in finding a new home for Audio Impact.  Especially
for my own selfish reasons.  Me and about five friends had already made
plans for the December 4th night!  Well, we'll be there to support ya when
and wherever you find a new home.

psitive thoughts and fingers crossed

The only reason language exists is so we can communicate with others (imo).
Language is our primary source of communication for the most part.  One does
not need language to think their thoughts, to know what I'm thinking does
not necessarily require English words. The specific need for a spoken
language only really arises when attempting to communicate those thoughts to
other people, if there was no reason to communicate with other people,
specific spoken words would not be necessary.  And I think children learn
language so quickly because they *have* to in order to survive in our world,
because they must communicate with others.  Also because there is nothing to
"unlearn" in learning your first language, unlike learning a 2nd language
after your first.  When learning spanish, I had to stop myself from thinking
english, & then start thinking in spanish, a two step process going from
translating to actual understanding.  New children have no such problem.
Anybody ever tried to learn to snow-board *after* knowing how to ski?  More
difficult than simply learning to snow-board without having skiing
experience, nothing to unlearn.

Again, we only name things in order to communicate with others.  If I know a
tree produces edible fruit, I only need to understand that conceptually to
myself, I dont need to invent words to tell myself this.  I only need to
know the words for these things if I want to tell somebody else that the
fruit on the tree is edible.  I certainly understand plenty of things
conceptually, but sure as hell couldn't describe what I know using language.
Shit, even on the topic of words themselves, I understand definitions of
words correctly, but couldn't use words to describe what they meant in a
dictionary sense!


>Your imaginings are confined to the level of your knowledge.


I find the opposite to be quite true!  Aside from technical finite logical
deductions that require a certain base of factual knowledge for you start
with (how ya gonna figure out why your client's not seeing the server if you
don't even know what a mouse is, right? Gotta know something), I say
Balderdash! Foolishness! :)  Saying that my imaginings are limited to my
knowledge is pretty much the same as saying that I have no imagination at
all, that I know only facts that have been presented to me.  And I dare say
that from time to time, I've been known to have a rather vivid imagination,
much to the chagrin of my co-workers! ;)  I think creative thinking people
possibly have a broader spectrum of learning ability (more ways to intake &
assimilate information) than perhaps some of our more stodgy unimaginative
friends! :)


>To emphasize imagination and creativity over knowledge and logic
>is a creative dead-end.  


To emphasize knowledge & logic over imagination and creativity is a creative
dead-end, not the other way around.  Just look at Spock on Star Trek!  Not a
very imaginative fellow, in spite of being half-human.  And really, to
emphasize either one of these over the other is to limit your brain's
potential.  Emphasize them both!  People tend to think of these qualities as
being opposites, incompatible (left-brained people versus right-brained
people etc), but they actually complement each other, and when put to good
use together can produce phenomenal results, from whence come the true
geniuses imho.

I have to agree with Brian here, these things were discovered, not invented.
We came up with these terms to describe what it was we were experiencing, we
discovered these equations in order to better understand what it was we were
seeing.  I consider non-linear thought to be a simple fact (for me, anyway,
can't answer for the rest of you's).  My thoughts are non-linear, whether or
not we have a word or an equation for it.  I very often struggle with the
fact that I just don't have a vocabulary sufficient to describe the things I
think, experience, feel; linear strings of words to describe non-3rd
dimensional fractal expansions of thought, very inadequate.  If we didn't
think non-linearly, I don't think the concept of non-linear thought would
have been "invented" anyway, we wouldn't have been capable of it.  Just like
all other words, they were simply created to describe something we were
already seeing or experiencing, to other people.  "Oog find tree with good
fruit! Good fruit!"  "Oh yeah?  Moog find way to change subjective reality
by altering moog's perception! *grunt*"  Or whatever you want to describe.


>To have a higher conciousness (knowledge) one must first pass

>or of reality)?


Consciousness and knowledge are not necessarily the same thing.  I think
that consciousness is simply awareness.  Awareness doesn't necessarily
require that you learn something, where I think that actual knowledge does.
But that's pretty debatable I guess, a semantics thingy; people will always
have different ideas of what constitutes their own consciousness.


>To separate conciousness and creativity from knowledge and empiricism
>is quite simply impossible....


This makes sense with regards to what I was saying before, the two sides of
the brain must be in balance.  Never will I try to separate them, wouldn't
be logical! ;)

  Hi :)
      My name is Dailey and I've been on SFRaves' discussion list for four
days.I'm actually in my freshman year of college down in LA but San Jose
is my home town and I've spent enough time in San Francisco to be a
resident tourist.  I love to rave.  Since I'll be in San Francisco for
Thanksgiving, most of December and January, and all Summer months, I
thought it would make sense to sign on and say hi....but now I should
probably go study (or at least pretend to).
               
                        ...in love and light ...
                                                    --Dailey

PS:  I'm a girl (some people can't tell by the name)

over the place.  Anyway I am wondering if there are any other parties going
on this friday that anyone knows of.  If you know of any parties on friday,
drop me a line!!!  
Rave on brothers and sisters,

In the search for good music in Tapei....

Someone on the list mentioned a club called KISS, although they forwarned 
me that the club was kinda on the cheesy side. But I figured what the
hell, so off I was to KISS on a Fri night. Absolutely beautiful club.
Marble, wooden dance floor, the B.S. roped off VIP areas, a killer
sound system and about $17. There was indeed a cheesy, Bobby
Brown-sounding group performing. I watched for a while, drank the beer
that was included with the price of admission, and they took a break. When
they took their break, the D.J.'s started spinning some fairly mediocre
house. But hey, it was something. Just to bother them, I went and asked if
they had any trance or techno(even though I party in S.F. I can never get
enough of it.) The told me that they were scared to play trance because
the crowd they played to wouldn't get it. I asked them if they knew of any
place in Tapei that did play trance. They gave me an address, and off I
went to club #2.

Club #2 turned out to be a place called Queens. $350 NT dollars to get
in(about $13 or $14 American), one drink included(which was an odd, but
welcome concept to me.) The setup was reminisent of 1015 Folsom. Two
floors, good lighting system, good sound, and a couple of bars. The
people were dressed up a bit(but not overly so,) which was a plesant
change of pace. 

I walked in, and was floored. The were playing some great sounding techno.
And the next song was good too. The next song was even better. They
continued to play great, wonderful, absofuckinglutely *FABULOUS* techno
and trance till 6 a.m. I could not for the life of me stop dancing, and I
rarely dance. The people were fairly friendly, looking like they were
having a good time. To say I was impressed is an understatement. 

I also hooked up with a British rave promoter who throws parties over
there and got the score of the night: The Taiwanese Rave flyer! I chatted
with him a bit about the scene over there. Parties are about $15, there
are only a couple of promoters, and even though drug-trafficking can
result in a death sentence, there are all the amEnities one would find at
home. All in all I got the impression that the scene was fairly new
over there(but the D.J.'s sure know what's up.) A very pleasant
experience. I give it two glowsticks up.

Thus concludes the international rave report for Tapei, Mon. Nov 25 1996.       

The next installment will be coming live from Seoul, Korea.

I still haven't decided myself wether I should go or not...
and I agree with you... lets see:

1) 150,000 sqr feet: meaning it would be a pretty huge party (15,000+=
 people)
2) Being it a huge party would mean that it would bring attention (cops,
paramedics, etc).
   -I remember 2nd Chakra, I did not like it much too many cops scared me
and the vibe was not
    very friendly..specially the gangsters and rappers (or whatever) -don't
mean to put=20
    labels on people but sometimes its nescesary for descriptive purposes.
3) There would be sooo many people that the Vibe would probably become=
 spoiled.
4) THe Bar upstairs can bring out obnoxious drunk people that would not help
at all.
5) The drug+Alcohol mix in the same party doesn't sound like fun.

Yes, lots of DJs, Music and all...but is it really worth it? I dunno...
CAn someone please help us decide!?! Is Ubitiquious (sp?) really worth the=

what's wrong with cops being all over the place?
i have no problem with cops (until they start beating people up). until
then, they're just doing they job. i don't hate them for doing what they
beleive in.
besides, who cares if cops are at a party? i _like_ it when i see the cops
show up, verify that the party is safe, smile at everyone, and leave. were
it up to most cops, they wouldn't bust parties. decisions come down from
above.

maybe the cops make the e dealers by the front entrance clam up for a
while. or maybe the fool taking e in front of a cop gets busted. gee, that
would be too bad. i guess that puts a damper on all the over drug users and
pushy drug dealers out there. i don't think it will put a damper on any fun
i might have.

ok. maybe i'm a little cranky right now because i have a headache. or maybe
i'm all twitchy because i just finished a marathon 3 hour netquake session.
but anyway..
i've seen a lot of new ravers lately, and i thought it's probably time to
point out again that:

you don't need e to have a good time.

???!! yes. it's true. you can have fun at a rave without drugs. 
do you need to take e every single weekend? no. unless you are trying to
seek out some higher meaning to your life through the use of mdma, taking
it every single weekend to "have a good time" makes you no different than
the guy who goes out and gets drunk every weekend. sure, e is probably
safer than alcohol (certainly in the short term, possibly in the long term
as well), but you are doing it for the exact same purpose: to get messed up
and have fun. wow. how idyllic.

of course, you don't even have to pay attention to me. maybe i just made
myself grow up too fast. or maybe i'm trying to spare you some of the shit
i went through. my advice: go help out at a party. be a part of something
you help create. believe me, the feeling you get from that will last long
after any e hangover will. instant gratification is all fine and good, but
it's just that - don't mistake it for anything else.

maybe what i'm trying to get across is be responsible to yourself. be
responsible to your body, be responsible to your mind. do e if you enjoy
it, but don't go crazy and put a huge stress on your body. no doctor alive
would have the gall to suggest that you do e more that once every ten or
fourteen days. don't burn out your body, and don't do it to your mind, either.

raving shouldn't be about how many drugs you can stuff down your throat
(that's what adolescence is about!), it should be about discovering
yourself; finding a direction for your life, and using that knowledge to
make it better. no chemical is substitute for self-knowledge and
introspection.

oh well. i'm not writing so well tonight. i'll stop before i make some huge
blunder.

happy thanksgiving (even though REAL thanksgiving is in october)
play safe.

	So seeing a friend of yours get hauled off to jail in front of you
wouldn't spoil your fun, Brendan?  Or do you not have any "fool" friends
who might accidentally do something where they could be witnessed by a
cop?
	Maybe cops take orders from above, and are "just doing their job";
so were Hitler's SS troops when they loaded the ovens.  That's not a 
stretch -- take someone who believes that if you break the law you are a
criminal who deserves whatever punishment the law dictates you should
receive, and gives little or no thought to the morality of the law in
question, and you have an SS trooper waiting to happen.  
	I've talked to many cops who think this way, and I think it is a
mindset encouraged by the institutions they belong to.
	I do not hate the police as individuals.  I'd love to see a cop
grooving to the music at a rave (people on this list have mentioned seeing
this, so I know it happens, although in my five years of semi-regular
raving I don't recall ever seeing it).  However when cops are at a party,
it usually means either the party is about to be busted, or it is a large
and often low-vibe event that is overpriced in part because the promoters
had to hire cops for security in order not to get busted.
	Given these circumstances Brendan, can you blame me or Pablo 
or anyone else for not being thrilled to see cops all over the place at a
party?

Question authority before it questions you,

while i am a huge fan of E, i must second some of brendan's sentiments
here.

now, i have to say, i don't agree that E is about "instant
gratification"... i have used it a number of times in ways that it has
helped me gain self-knowledge, aided introspection, and facilitated some
very real lasting friendships.

but i have noticed that with frequent use, all of these effects diminish
rapidly, leaving just the "high" (often followed by a low).

it's sometimes hard to be moderate with such a special substance, but
believe me, it will get a lot less special if you overuse it.

E is not physically addictive, but it can be psychologically addictive. if
you haven't found this out yet, consider yourself lucky-- but unless
you're very conscientious about moderation, you will someday experience
psychological withdrawal after an Experience (which will most likely seem
empty in retrospect), and you will know exactly what i'm talking about.

of course, going through that can be a learning/growing experience too, if
you deal with it in a responsible and self-aware fashion...

just my 125 milligrams--

love,

brian

I was thinking about going to that New Years thing by CW, until i saw 
the price tag. i mean, i like big raves, but no way in hell will i pay 
that ammount of cash no matter who is doing it and what its for, even if 
there is a space craft landing zone on top. i do recall a time when CW 
raves pre-sell tickets were like $20 or $15 or something, but call me 
cheap, $25 [i think] for pre-sell is way too much. and $35 at the door is 
insane.

Luuuuuuvleee!

Haven't checked mail to see if everyone else had a good time, but I sure did!
Big thanks to all who participated, and extra big thanks to Sound System
Wonder Workers Rick Riffle, Eric D(?) & Mark Camp, Chowmasters Kerry L, Tom
Clark & Ahnon Cross , Decor-Divas Melissa Wong, Laura Parker & Robin G, and
everyone who contributed, moved equipment, and stuck around for clean up.

As for the artists... uhh...  hmm... MARK! WHEN ARE THE TAPES GONNA BE
READY!?!? Rarely has my appetite for the funk been so satisfied as it was by
Toby Egan's, Derek's, & Mei-Lwun's Sets. Did everyone hear Mei-Lwun's band's
(Soulstice(sp?) tape on sunday? Just coincidence that one of their records
was played by another D.J. at the cabin trip last year?... I think not. And
can someone tell me where the hell Noah and his magic crate get all those
wonderful samples?!

Right down to the last drop of coffee and the last buttered nugget at Sunday
eve's Buttercup Pantry experience, twas alllllll goooood!.... well... 99.999
goood%. I kinda feel I need to say something about having liked to see more
faces involved in the clean-up on Sunday. It would've made things go much
faster and given us all time to relax & reflect. But that's about all I can
say seeing as how I ended up with a year's supply of leftover groceries.

There is a lost and found box: Day Glo Blanky, Vuarnets, Green Ski Jacket,
Army Jacket Liner, Brown Girl's Shirt, Blue Shirt, Black Ski Pants, Winery
Shirt, D.Q. Shirt, Black Makeup Bag, Letterman's Tool, Purple Flashlight
(Jon's), Contact Cleaner, BM Laminate, Bottle of Equinox, 3 C.D.s (Krishnas?)
and a Bar of Soap. Oh yeah, Pengo's missing his pipe and Dianna's missing her
toothpaste. Any clues?

As for the finances, I'm glad to say it worked out close to square (+/- $50,
depending on deposit) Minimal damages and no major injuries known.

Last year some cabin folks had a very special reunion dinner the next week,
if anyone was interested in doing that, I could certainly contribute some
groceries!

Love & Reflections,
-StEvEo

I agree, $35.00 is a little steep in some pocketbooks for a night of 
partying, and who knows, maybe the next year they have a New Years Eve 
party it might cost $50 at the door.  Yikes!!!!!!!!!

				My $.02 worth- Peace!

The only reason language exists is so we can communicate with others
(imo).
Language is our primary source of communication for the most part.  One
does
not need language to think their thoughts, to know what I'm thinking
does
not necessarily require English words. The specific need for a spoken
language only really arises when attempting to communicate those
thoughts to
other people, if there was no reason to communicate with other people,
specific spoken words would not be necessary.  And I think children
learn
language so quickly because they *have* to in order to survive in our
world,
because they must communicate with others.  Also because there is
nothing to
"unlearn" in learning your first language, unlike learning a 2nd
language
after your first.  When learning spanish, I had to stop myself from
thinking
english, & then start thinking in spanish, a two step process going from
translating to actual understanding.  New children have no such problem.
Anybody ever tried to learn to snow-board *after* knowing how to ski?
More
difficult than simply learning to snow-board without having skiing
experience, nothing to unlearn.

Again, we only name things in order to communicate with others.  If I
know a
tree produces edible fruit, I only need to understand that conceptually
to
myself, I dont need to invent words to tell myself this.  I only need to
know the words for these things if I want to tell somebody else that the
fruit on the tree is edible.  I certainly understand plenty of things
conceptually, but sure as hell couldn't describe what I know using
language.
Shit, even on the topic of words themselves, I understand definitions of
words correctly, but couldn't use words to describe what they meant in a
dictionary sense!


>Your imaginings are confined to the level of your knowledge.


I find the opposite to be quite true!  Aside from technical finite
logical
deductions that require a certain base of factual knowledge for you
start
with (how ya gonna figure out why your client's not seeing the server if
you
don't even know what a mouse is, right? Gotta know something), I say
Balderdash! Foolishness! :)  Saying that my imaginings are limited to my
knowledge is pretty much the same as saying that I have no imagination
at
all, that I know only facts that have been presented to me.  And I dare
say
that from time to time, I've been known to have a rather vivid
imagination,
much to the chagrin of my co-workers! ;)  I think creative thinking
people
possibly have a broader spectrum of learning ability (more ways to
intake &
assimilate information) than perhaps some of our more stodgy
unimaginative
friends! :)


>To emphasize imagination and creativity over knowledge and logic
>is a creative dead-end.


To emphasize knowledge & logic over imagination and creativity is a
creative
dead-end, not the other way around.  Just look at Spock on Star Trek!
Not a
very imaginative fellow, in spite of being half-human.  And really, to
emphasize either one of these over the other is to limit your brain's
potential.  Emphasize them both!  People tend to think of these
qualities as
being opposites, incompatible (left-brained people versus right-brained
people etc), but they actually complement each other, and when put to
good
use together can produce phenomenal results, from whence come the true
geniuses imho.

I have to agree with Brian here, these things were discovered, not
invented.
We came up with these terms to describe what it was we were
experiencing, we
discovered these equations in order to better understand what it was we
were
seeing.  I consider non-linear thought to be a simple fact (for me,
anyway,
can't answer for the rest of you's).  My thoughts are non-linear,
whether or
not we have a word or an equation for it.  I very often struggle with
the
fact that I just don't have a vocabulary sufficient to describe the
things I
think, experience, feel; linear strings of words to describe non-3rd
dimensional fractal expansions of thought, very inadequate.  If we
didn't
think non-linearly, I don't think the concept of non-linear thought
would
have been "invented" anyway, we wouldn't have been capable of it.  Just
like
all other words, they were simply created to describe something we were
already seeing or experiencing, to other people.  "Oog find tree with
good
fruit! Good fruit!"  "Oh yeah?  Moog find way to change subjective
reality
by altering moog's perception! *grunt*"  Or whatever you want to
describe.

>or of reality)?


Consciousness and knowledge are not necessarily the same thing.  I think
that consciousness is simply awareness.  Awareness doesn't necessarily
require that you learn something, where I think that actual knowledge
does.
But that's pretty debatable I guess, a semantics thingy; people will
always
have different ideas of what constitutes their own consciousness.


>To separate conciousness and creativity from knowledge and empiricism
>is quite simply impossible....


This makes sense with regards to what I was saying before, the two sides
of
the brain must be in balance.  Never will I try to separate them,
wouldn't
be logical! ;)

     oh, i guess i have a whole theory on money...i believe someday money 
     will not exist...so why be scared?  you can always make more money.  
     what people SHOULD be scared of is all the time that people spend 
     (which can never be replaced) working to make more money, people are 
     not working smart these days, they are only working hard.  It's a 
     ******* joke, and everyone seems to buy into it.  40 years, get a 
     timex is a joke.  too often it keeps people from doing what they were

As you read, Audio Impact has lost its space, but maybe this is a blessing
is disguise. Though the club had a good vibe last week, the management was
a real downer. The bartenders and security were big dicks. I can't remember
the last club I went to that had big goons like that doing THOROUGH
body searches. I saw a few people get bumped around by them, and got tired
of seeing them shine flashlights onto people's faces to make sure they
weren't up to no good. Chill out, already. It'll be a good club no matter
where it's moved to, and I know we can do better than that.

I have difficulty with such anthropocentric langauge.  "Man is the
highest", "the center", "has dominion over the beasts", etc.  Reminds me of
Sunday school.  What have the cognitive changes in the human psyche wrought
over the past 5 millenia?  High tech wars which require the courage to puch
a button while safely out of range, television, coca-cola and breast
implants.  Human history is filled with cases of genocide and forgive me if
I'm just unaware but I don't recall hearing of such mass slaughterings
among "primitive" animals.  IMHO many of the greatest advances in the human
condition are the result of getting back in tune with such "primitive" and
"lower" functions as compassion, love, and other emotions.  My cat feels
love, feels like it belongs, and loves me.  What "advances" could be more
important than that?

Really? Well, I just took nearly two years off from my work to go out
raving, etc. and let me tell you, I know the "stupid people working their
lives away" concept better than anyone. That's why I basically didn't do it
for a couple years. So now that I am working again, I bought my turntables
as a little treat.

Ok, just a check to see who all wants to go.  I'm planning on going to
Sacramento to goto Ubiquitous with some other sfravers. We are leaving
Friday sometime and getting a hotel for friday and Saturday. I will be
bringing a small little sound system. Nothing fancy or loud, just some
turntables and speakers and a reciever. No need for an amp because it won't
be loud. That why we don't get kicked out. The receiver will be fine. We
can party before Ubiquitous and then have alittle after-party as well. For
some of us we can party all day Sat. since we will have the room until
Sunday morning. If there is enough people interested we could get 2 room
that are adjacent.

I think if we get enough people we can make this a fun trip. All are
welcome to come. I would like to leave sometime between 12noon-3pm. For
those that have to work on friday I can get someone to post the location of
the hotel and the room number we will be at. It will be close to the
location of the party though.

Hi Everyone!

I'm forwarding this for my Housemate.  I guess everything you need to 
know is in the message below.  If you were at the cabin this past 
weekend, you might remember some groooooovey music coming from the 
speakers Sunday Morning/Afternoon.  Well, that was Soulstice, and I 
HIGHLY recomend you check you their live shows.  I think their next show 
is scheduled for Dec 5th at Bimbo's.

Now I'm confused - are there TWO bands in the bay area called Soulstice,
or is it the same band playing a wide range of music? The Soulstice I
know doesn't play what I would describe as trip-hop (as far as I know!). 
They're a 3-piece (I think) with a Russian woman vocalist and they play 
music I think of as more ambient, though they do get kinda funky from 
time to time! 

Duh....

If one looks at all the horrors of the 20th century one thing stands in
common - government power.   Whether the powerful government
is left or right the body counts are the same:

	Russian Communists        10 - 20 million dead (starvation of Kulaks,
Gulag)
	German Fascists	            10 - 20 million dead (concentration camps,
war )
	Chinese Communists       20 - 30 million dead (starvation, work camps)
	Kmer Rouge	            1- 2  million (killing fields, work camps)
	Etc, Etc, Etc	            millions and millions......


The above counts aren't even considering (well, only partially) the
deaths
in this century due to (government led) armed conflicts.  The amount of
damage we humans as INDIVIDUALS can do is considerable, as organized
groups collected into governmental bodies, it is astronomical.....

	So seeing a friend of yours get hauled off to jail in front of you
wouldn't spoil your fun, Brendan?  Or do you not have any "fool" friends
who might accidentally do something where they could be witnessed by a
cop?
	Maybe cops take orders from above, and are "just doing their job";
so were Hitler's SS troops when they loaded the ovens.  That's not a
stretch -- take someone who believes that if you break the law you are a
criminal who deserves whatever punishment the law dictates you should
receive, and gives little or no thought to the morality of the law in
question, and you have an SS trooper waiting to happen.
	I've talked to many cops who think this way, and I think it is a
mindset encouraged by the institutions they belong to.
	I do not hate the police as individuals.  I'd love to see a cop
grooving to the music at a rave (people on this list have mentioned
seeing
this, so I know it happens, although in my five years of semi-regular
raving I don't recall ever seeing it).  However when cops are at a
party,
it usually means either the party is about to be busted, or it is a
large
and often low-vibe event that is overpriced in part because the
promoters
had to hire cops for security in order not to get busted.
	Given these circumstances Brendan, can you blame me or Pablo
or anyone else for not being thrilled to see cops all over the place at
a
party?

Question authority before it questions you,

Yeah, the security goons were walking through the crowd with flashlights the
entire night and it was enough to ruin a vibe.  I was down and out already
so it didn't affect me, but I saw it bother other people.  I was going to
say something to the promoters, but I started to get the picture it was out
of their hands.  Well guys, since it's in your hands now, make a good choice
for the next venue, don't settle!  There are a lot of resources available
for us, and there are spaces to be found - several people on this list have
already volunteered to help people find spaces...

  A couple of folks asked me to take notes and report on Dr. Rietveld's
lecture, so here's a selection of ideas and topics that she covered:

1) House music began in Chicago in venues for gay Latinos and
African-Americans
2) Techno began in the mid-80s in Detroit
3) Raves started in England
4) All the above, plus other influences and confluences, make it difficult
to trace the evolution of dance music today. The process is more like a
web than a linear development.
5) The purpose of house music is TO DISAPPEAR -- disappear from the
critical gaze of conventional society, and to take a "vacation" from your
ordinary self, to lose yourself in the music and dance.
6) "In house, you don't dance to the music you like: you like the music
you dance to."
7) House music is "interactive consumption."
8) A rave is a temporary cult, where the DJs/shamen can shape the
emotional
terrain of their dancer/congregation.
9) At a rave, the crowds are as much responsible as the djs and
technicians for what happens.
10) Every good rave should end with an "anthem" rather than just come to
an abrupt halt.
11) A rave is a festival, not a spectacle. 
    spectacle = regimented and choreographed
    festival = spontaneous and interactive
12) Susie K brought up the significance of raves taking place in old
warehouses. Dr. Rietveld commented on the McLuhanesque fitness of a
digital, postmodern phenomenon (raves) taking place in the shell of an
abandoned modern institution (the warehouse and factory).

  All in all, a very good talk. Whether you agree or disagree with any
point, the whole presentation was very thoughtful and serious.

Hello 
I heard from a friend in Las Vegas ( I'm all the way in shitty Tampa Bay,
FL but, I am planning to move to San Francisco in August '97) well anyway I
heard that Aphex Twin is going to be in California.  That Richard James is
going to actually perform!! not just dj.  My boyfriend is flying to New
York for the big Warp gala & i'm missing out because of a time conflict.
If Aphex is going to be in California, I can fly out & stay with my
sister to hear  him. It would probably beat the time I saw Autechre in
Miami and is soooo worth the plane trip. So if any one has heard anything,
Please contact me!! 

thanx
melissa

I will probably get flamed for this, but what the hell:

I would add marijuana to this statement. It is rather interesting just how
socially acceptable it is within the scene. I am by no means against it
in any way shape or form, but I question the need to be constantly using
it to have a good time. I can't count the number of times I have asked
someone what they have been doing and heard "Smoking lots of ganja."
Really, if you walked up to someone and asked them what they had been 
doing lately and they said "Getting drunk every night," or "Doing lots of
speed," I think many people would feel that they had a problem. But for
some odd reason, this view does not seem to extend to pot. Just a random
thought I had.....

Hi All,
I'm new to this list....just signed up today. I grew up in SF and loved
the rave scene, the people, the love and support, etc in the Bay
Area.....I have been living in Boulder, CO for the last 5 years but am
moving back to SF soon and joined to get an idea of what was up these
days. I'm sure the scene has progressed alot but I am curious in what
ways. Are there so many events that the crowds are thin and the talent
is hard to book? Are the venues crawling with cops? Music?  I'm just
curious. If anyone out there feels like starting a thread on this
subject it would be cool. Last thing from SF I remember is going to
UNITY in Richmond at the Civic Center(i think thats right)  and having
the ultimate raving experience. (this was YEARS ago) anyway....thanks

I don't know..

   My lanquage skills are not all that great.  I blame it mostly on the
fact that; I don't remember everything I read.
   But I remember everything I hear WAY to often.
   One skill I am not lacking is; the art of music.
   And I think I have heard somewhere before that; more can be said with
music than  with words.

  And what about Steven Hawkings?  He can barely think basic words these
days. But he figured out how time travel would be possible.

I see use of substances as ok - if you can apply it towards something 
(art, music, general creation, etc..) 

As far as marijuana - it is a very natural substance, nothing artificial, 
been with us for thousands of years (so has alchohol, but the behaviral 
effects are quite different, not to mention the buzz from alchohol is 
aquired when your brain is getting poisoned).  True - too much marijuana 
can be bad for you (and expensive!) but the side effects are slim - 
usually limited to a scratchy throat and a severe case of the munchies 
and the need to go to sleep. :)  Some studies say that it can be cancer 
causing but the method of research seemed a bit invalid to me... no 
cancer cases have been documented as being caused by gettin' irie too 
often.

I see those as valid uses. I also see using substances just to have a
great time as valid, *in moderation*. I make no excuses for my activities,
and feel no need to ascribe my uses to "intellectual stimulation"(although
at times they have been.)

I am not speaking from a physiological standpoint, but rather from a
psychological one. Alcohol, pot, E, LSD, etc. all alter your perception of
reality to varying degrees. I just question why it seems to be acceptable
to use one certain type of mind-altering substance in great quantity,
whereas if you to use some of the others, you would be labeled an
alcoholic or an addict. I am not trying to condemn anyone at all, just
musing on the disparity in how certain substance are viewed.

Thanks for the notes. The above struck me as very amusing, as it
obfusicates a very simple reality: Warehouses are used because they are
big, usually empty, and cheap. I don't think this needs to be viewed from
an anything-esque perspective to get to the root of it.... ;-)

I agree, $35.00 is a little steep in some pocketbooks for a night of 
partying, and who knows, maybe the next year they have a New Years Eve 
party it might cost $50 at the door.  Yikes!!!!!!!!!
     
                                My $.02 worth- Peace!

Really? Well, I just took nearly two years off from my work to go out 
raving, etc. and let me tell you, I know the "stupid people working their 
lives away" concept better than anyone. That's why I basically didn't do it 
for a couple years. So now that I am working again, I bought my turntables 
as a little treat.

You know...I would be one of the last people to diss pot as a huge societal
evil. Anyone who knows me can attest to that fact. But please, let's be
real, ok? We didn't need a scientific study to know that cigarettes get
people hooked and that these people happen to develop bad coughs and many
of them died prematurely. right? I'm not comparing the ill effects of
smokes to pot, I'm saying that these things were evident before the
president classified nicotine as an addictive substance.

Among the side effects of pot that I or friends have expereinced are: panic
attacks, double vision, depression, lethargy, and the beforementioned
scratchy throats (and tattered lungs). I don't understand how cigarettes
could cause lung cancer, but that pot smoke, which is harsher, somehow
would not. *shrug*

 I have also had many many special experiences... with friends and
alone. It can be very theraputic on several different levels. 

But to ignore the obvious: That is can be damaging to certain individuals,
and to believe that 'the lack of scientific studies' somehow makes these
side effects invalid is silly.

ps- I've noticed a lot of responses copying the entire thread. It's a real
pain sometimes, not to mention a waste of space, so let's be more careful:)

having had a disastrous NY Eve last year (trying to get me and two friends
to that megarave in Oakland, actually being stuck inside a subway tunnel
when someone set off an M-80 right next to us, etc), I've learned to
appreciate the "smaller is better" approach.  Burning Man (with all the tiny
burns mixed in over the weekend) gave me an appreciation for this as well.
Jungle/ambient/trance on the beach?  I'll pay $$ and will bring plenty of
burnable material.  Count me in!

Well, let do it. We as a group can pull off a great free/donation beach
party. We have the resources to do it so why not. It doesn't have to be
Stinson beach, it could be any beach we've had nighttime parties at before.
I'm all up for helping in anyway I can. Now that Wayne has tables and
mixer, he has exactly 35 days to practice and he can spin at the beach
party. If we want to do something we have to stand up and do it. There are
probably alot of people here that would love to do this. Right????

CoolWorld will have 40W lasers, Mega Watt sound systems, and more.  Lots
more.  Sure, it won't have the same look and feel of a little F8 party.
And there will be people from LA, gangster types, drunks, narcs, and
everything else.  So what.

Hide what you don't want taken away in your pants (like high school) at
the entrance.

Use some discretion when smoking.  

Don't EVER look into the eyes of a gangster type.  You can spot them
easily, just don't look at them, especially up close.  They will leave
you alone, they are looking for a fight, not a dance.  You know the
clothes, the hat, the look, even the 'tuff' expression on the face.
They will mostly grow up to go to jail or be killed by another.  Leave
them alone.  

Life is full of dangers:  Ski within boundaries.  Avoid jelly fish.
Don't look into a laser.

If you know how to avoid problems, you can have a good time.  15,000
people.  I intend to go, and I believe I will have a good, safe,  time.

My friends have a tradition of going to the beach on New Year's Day!
This

scotch,
good cigar!

Ummm...you sound a bit like Philip Morris.  Tobacco companies are
*still* claiming the research doesn't prove anything.  Do you actually 
believe that??  Just because the research
isn't there does NOT mean it doesn't cause cancer.  What about that black
tar shit that coats your pipe and almost the entire length of your bong.
If that shit coats your bong, don't you just wonder what it does to your
lungs?? I personally don't want to be the first statistic.

Oh yeah, and I'm really sick of the "marijuana is natural" bullshit.  A
drug is a drug.  Whether or not it is synthesized in a lab or grown from a
plant.  THC is a secondary plant chemical that helps the plant fight
herbivores such as insects. (btw, there are studies about caterpillar
"addiction" to THC as a way of making the larvae continue feeding--thereby
a more effective pesticide--ask me about it sometime)  Strychnine is also
a natural occuring compound that comes from plants of the genus
_Strychnus_, and it will kill you.  Other compounds are tannins from oaks,
solanine from potatoes--these will also do very bad things to you.  AND
they are natural.  Many, if not most, of our drugs hail from plants.  I
just don't buy the "it's more natural" agenda.  It's seeing things through
rose-tinted glasses.

BTW, I am not down on using drugs, I'm down on abusing drugs.
Personally, I support full legalization of all drugs.  I dislike
categorizing drugs as "good" and "bad" and "good" and "better."  Drug use
is a very multi-faceted topic and I encourage everyone to understand *all*
implications of drug use.  We are a drug culture and there is no
getting away from that.  Denial and hypocrisy are very strong human
characteristics and often thwart the most informed people.

Enough of my public service message here...

If that's what you like then cool, I hope you have a great time and I'm not
knocking you for that. It's just that some of us what a more personal and
underground vibe to spend NYE at.

Damn, back when I was in High School, we never got searched and hell, kids
hardly even brought a pocket knife to school let alone a gun like now a
days. There was never a need to search. Too bad kids now make it so you
have to search them when entering school.

Sorry for poking fun, I'm just in a good mood for some reason. I honestly
hope you have a great time. Hell, I'm going to Ubiquitous and you can't
tell me that is not a Massive. Just most of the times, in fact, almost all
the time, I like the smaller parties better. That's just me.

Hello!!!  Hope everyone is having a groovey day.

So far, I've recieved 21 orders for tapes.  I plan on calling around next 
week to see what kind of pricing I can get.  Please let me know by Monday 
if you'd like a copy of the tapes.  

I've had a couple of suggestion for Art Work, etc...  What I thought 
might me cool, is to have anyone who feels like it do some cool art work 
and send it to me.  And rather than have a 'contest' for the best 
artwork, I thought I'd use everything that is submitted.  So that every 
tape is different (or at least a good portion of them).  Does this sound 
cool with everyone???  If you wanna do this, please send it to me as a 
Mac pict. file.

I've also had a couple of requests for individual DJ sets.  This may be 
kind of hard as I was not really paying attention to who was playing 
when.  I'm not even sure if there was a set DJ schedule.  Anyways, if 
there are enough people who want individual DJ sets, I can probably go in 
and try to figure it out.  DJ'S!!!! - Do you all remember what time your 
were playing on Saturday eve/Sunday Morn??   If you do, please send me 
the aprox. times of your sets.

um...ok, I think thats it.  I listened to portions of the tapes last 
night and they all sound GREAT!!!!  Especially the Poetry and Vocals from 
Shawna and Ahnon during the Re: and Astronout sets.  Wow!!!  You two have 
brought new meaning to our music!!!  It sounds absolutly wonderfull!!!!!

to your lungs?? I personally don't want to be the first statistic.

My brother and I are heading to LA this weekend, and because I might not 
see you then, let me just say this:  Have a safe and happy Thanksgiving.  
May we all take a moment to appreciate the good things in our lives, 
surrounded by good friends, family, and loved ones...

peace and love,

Ahem. I did not say that too much marijuana was not bad for you. I was just trying to explain why marijuana is 
seen as separate from other substances. Sorry if I offended you.

I agree. And natural can be just as deadly as artificial. I guess the point that I meant to bring up is that 
when you buy a bag of ganja, you can see what your getting, you can smell it, you can hold it and find out how 
good it is, meaning less chance of buying something poisonus or bunk like other manufactured substances.

Sounds interesting. I would like to know more. Marijuana farmers in the country surround the base of their 
plants with dogshit to keep deer away (deer are major stoners) - the carnivourous smell of the dogshit keeps a 
deer away as good as an electric fence would.

The small amounts of alkaloids such as strychnine in plants, etc have to be taken in immense quantities in 
order to kill you though.  Otherwise we would all drop dead from eating an apple.

HEY! I'm not trying to start a fight with anyone here!!! A person was curious as to why marijuana was not 
considered to be in the same family as something like MDMA or speed and I simply came up with my own possible 
explanations.  Geez...

It's hardly NEW.

A device working on the same principle was for sale and advertised in
HighTimes.  In 1975.  Use to call it a 'Tilted' (tilt er), users were
said to 'get tilted'.

And they called it new then too.

I have an ex-MIT friend that designed something to do this. It's
microprocessor controlled and looks totally sci-fi. The one he designed is
hand-built sells for hundreds of dollars -- but it's supposed to be
excellent. I haven't tried it myself. If anybody wants to get in touch w/
him write me and I'll forward the email to him.

But they are usually empty and cheap because they are no longer in major use.
They have become "obsolete", If EDI and just in time manufacturing comes into
full swing then you will see even more empty wharehouses.

the following comments are anecdotal! =)  )

you can build a vaporizor (similar to a vaportron) with a glass jar, tin
lid, sautering iron, and tin foil.  i'll leave it to the imagination how to
build such a thing, but i've HEARD that it costs close to nothing!

love to you all-

	4 of us (Jay, Andy W., Eric P. and myself) met today for lunch in
PA.  Too bad people from Norther parts that requested lunch to happen
closer to them were not present, because all of us were from Sunnyvale and
farther South.  Oh, well - next time we'll just make it little closer to us.

	Lunch was fun - although I would not recommend going to "Il
Fornaio" for lunch - it does take way too long, and parking in downtown PA,
as well as traffic sucks.  It was fun escaping work for couple hours and
meeting couple people I haven't met before.  I hope next time there will be
more SFRs there :).

	Also, I volunteered organizing the SB lunch in 2 weeks, so all of
you interested please keep your eyes open for my e-mail.

See some of you out this weekend - I am pretty sure I will be at
Thanksgiving and Tribal Funk.

Hugz,
Branka

the idea being to increase the temperature enough to vaporize the thc, but
not high enough to ignite the rest of the plant. as has been pointed out,
it's not a new idea.
i've seen plans for the DIYer in ascii format on bbs's over the years. i'm
sure they've made their way onto the net by now.

Well, let do it. We as a group can pull off a great free/donation beach 
party. We have the resources to do it so why not. It doesn't have to be 
Stinson beach, it could be any beach we've had nighttime parties at before. 
I'm all up for helping in anyway I can. Now that Wayne has tables and 
mixer, he has exactly 35 days to practice and he can spin at the beach 
party. If we want to do something we have to stand up and do it. There are 
probably alot of people here that would love to do this. Right????

Cheapest vaporizer: A glass blender body and a frying pan; that's it! Check

Hi all!

Well despite the fact that I had 2 midterms on friday and worked 20 hours 
this weekend I had a lot of fun.  
  Friday I set up for the reagge concert the Itals and Andrew Bees.  And 
then stayed to watch them.  WOW.  These guys were great.  If you love 
reagge check them out.  They played a few Black Uhura songs and a ziggy 
Marley song I noticed too.  The vibe at this show was comparable to a 
rave.  Everyone dancing to the music rather than to each other, friendly 
smiles everywere and the Itals had some bomb -lemme tell ya!
   There was also an intermission show = Raks al Beledi - dance of the 
people.  A very beautiful show of traditional "belly dancing"(is ther 
another name for it?) in not so traditional clothing (I mean they weren't 
clothed from head to toe with only thier eyes showing, but they were 
wereing indinan dress).  

Saturday mi amigo Mike decided to throw a party(about a week and a half 
of planning) on Saturday.  It just so happend to be a Full Moon gig on 
the beach.  It was great! Perfect weather -wasn't cold at all.  Great 
people and great music.  This was only the second party I had ever stayed 
at till the last trash was picked up, the last cord rapped and the last 
person to leave.  It takes alot out of ya haulin' 4 boxes and a generator 
up a beach.  I'm sure some of you have had this pleasure and I definately
 have a greater respect for all the work that goes into a good party.
   I met this girl at the party - very smart- who designes lighting boards
 and light racks.  Well she's still beginning but she says she's working on a 
project to design lighting controled by hand movement.  She will be 
moving up to SF this June to sell and promot here equipment and hopefully 
make some contacts to improve her work.

Happy Turkey Day and I might see some of ya at Ubiquatious!

PLUR,

       Austin

HI all,

I had a few questions for the list and was hoping some of you could respond.

I love the art work I see at many of the parties like Harmony, The Goa 
Gill party, Gateway etc. and was wondering who are the artists who design 
and do all this beautiful work.  Are they affiliated with the party or is 
the work recycled between crews?  Are the artists paid for there work or 
is done in the spirit of rave and for the community?
   The reason I was asking is because I'm getting together with a few 
people in SLo to throw a party and I would love to get some great 
decor for the space.  I'm not a very good artist but I can do technical 
design.  I know a few artists but they don't do the style of art I am 
interested in displaying.  I also am looking for ideas I 
have a few of my own and the rest come from experience in the scene.  
	Aside from that, I would like your Opinion.  I know that the 
party we throw will be small but i'm contemplating on using a legal venue 
till which can only be utilized till 4am or confirming a warehouse 
(hopefully with permits) till when ever - 6 or 7.We all have alot of 
support from the local djs and those that want to go - it's just a matter 
of putting forth the enrgy to create the party we want to create.

I've helped with parties and concerts before but have never been involved 
with all aspects of the creation.  It's very exciting and I hope it all 
pays of.
Any advice is welcome, Thanks.

PLUR,

       Austin

well ... that's true ... but i must admit that i felt FAR better with the 
cops doing security at Dynasty here in BC, than i have with any other 
security so far.  And there were people wandering around smoking joints 
all over the place, and they weren't doing anything about it.  I don't 
know if they nailed any people TAKING e.  i do know that they nabbed some 
dealers ...

And at Orbital here, we had the RCMP for security ... i don't know ... i 
prefer cops in a way :)  at least, when they're being reasonable!

Maybe this doesn't _have_ to be viewed with an anything-esque perspective 
to understand _why_ ravers choose to hold raves in warehouses (on the 
micro level), but I think it's really fun and satisfying all the same... 

The re-appropriation of physical artifacts by the scene  for 
purposes other than they were originally intended is really fascinating. 
What was originally intended as a high-end stereo component 
(technics 1200s) becomes a musical and percussive instrument extraordinaire 
in the hands of talented djs. What was originally intended as a cheap 
bass-synthesizer/minikeyborad (tb303)  becomes the progenitor of the 
acid-bass-line. Cold medicine (vicks vaporub) becomes instrument of 
pleasure. Kids stuff (pixie sticks, glowsticks, glitter, etc.) become major 
social signifiers for a generation of young adults. Link in chain of 
capitalist distribution of commercial goods (warehouses) becomes locale 
for underground, subversive (?) counter-culture.

I'm sure there are plenty more that y'all could come up with. Point is, 
it's a very worthwhile pursuit for people (like the SFSU prof) to think 
about why things like this happen and what the implications are on 
"culture" and "society".

Okay folks, this is a serious situation and a calling to arms!!!

All of you that know Greg know when he says something he's not blowing
shit!

The proposition of buying land has been considered and executed in
southern California. A large plot of land was purchased in the Santa Ana 
hills for the purpose of throwing raves. A road was even built leading
to the space. To the best of my knowledge this effort was unsuccessful.
(anyone with details please fill us in.)

The concept of raising money to change the 2am dance curfew law does not
seem to me to be a completely unattainable goal. Any law on the books
can be changed with enough support, signatures, and donated time and
effort. Take Prop. 215 for example, sure it's a stretch. But I'm sure
all of you at least once were approached by someone at a supermarket to
sign the 215 ballot many months ago.

We have the technology to make change...we have the incentive to make
change...DO WE HAVE THE SPIRIT TO MAKE CHANGE????!???

Sometimes I wonder, Shit gets thrown around the list. People say stuff
but many times nothing happens. I'm not blaming anyone, but if something
*obviously* needs attention should we continue to ignore it?????

This is our scene....this is our time......this is our life...Let's make
it the best we can!

We have made a difference already! Proof postive...Friends and Family,
Harmony, Famtasia, BBQ 'n' Beats, ODP, Elevation, and many other
net-related parties are on the horizon. The CA underground rave scene is
about to explode! Let's give it the resources to prosper.

We have a small group willing to make a difference. We have so many
successful business-minded people on list. Let yourself be known! Let's
not let such an important movement fade away into the abyss of the list.

Anyone interested in this crazy notion please respond and let yourself
be known. Hopefully with enough of us we'll be able to actually make
things happen for a change. 

Crazy thoughts invading my mind,

Terry

Dear SFRavefriends,

	I found this amusing, but also saddening.  Why?  Because the level
of communication between these two presumeably fictional lovers is so much
higher than what I've found from most of the people who I've tried to
engage in cybersex with!

Much love,

*YAWN* Time for a nap. 

Do the above overly verbose statements aid in a deeper understanding of

matter runs over to his mini storage bins and grabs his "North Sonic II" hearing 
protectors and ties them around his neck!

Thanks, Dave! ;) I keep forgetting to bring these and seriously regretting it.

Everybody else, these ear plugs are about $15.00 and taper off the high-mid and hi 
frequencies still allowing u 2 hear w/out frying your ears! A worthwhile investement, 
you can pick up at any good music store! :D

[ Humorously Rave-Related : Do not take too seriously! ]

 Well, the doctor at Kaiser told me that the ache in my heel is due to
something called plantar fasciatis (sic). I don't know if anyone else
here in SFRaves has had this - it feels like there's a pebble between
my heel and my shoe. It's cut down on my dancefloor endurance for sure.

 Anyway, the doctor told me that it takes time and care, and it'll heal
itself. He perscribed ice packs, regular doses of ibuprofen,
and to get the weight off the back of my foot and more onto the front
pads - ie, heels!
 
 So, if anyone can recommend any places that sell 9-1/2 long E-width 
shoes w/high heels that can be danced in, just drop me a line...I'm 
short of the rest of the ensemble too, so any recommendations along those 
lines would be appreciated...

  Larry "I have a perscription for this baby-T !!!" Ching

 Oh...if anyone actually has any advice they want to give me about curing
this plantar faciatis thing, please send it along.

PS - Have a great Thanksgiving, y'all!

hello all-

just wanted to say happy thanksgiving to all of you.  regardless of your
political persuasion, thoughts on the validity of thanksgiving, i hope it's
a fun day for you!!!

i will be at saturn5 (and you will, too, if you're cool!), so i hope to see
many of you there dancing, eating, celebrating this wonderful city of ours,
and generally sharing love, for many of us don't have family around with
which to share it.

i love you all!

Ok, I think I've said this before but...

The scene is what you perceive it to be... We all create our own scene.
Some consider the scene a babe market, figuring out how-to and how many
babes, or dolls (i.e. guys) they can "bag and tag"...  I know several of
these type people from both gender sides.
Some see the scene as a profitability market to sell drugs.  Some see
the scene to buy "stuff"(I've heard people discuss about how "dry" blah
blah blah's party was, Or sooo many people would be whispering "E, E, E"
that I thought it was part of the song.).
Some go out to escape reality, some are running away from something (and
still running), some go out to have a good time, Dance, trance,
excersise, whatever. Some are looking for family, and found it here.
All I can say is from my own experiences, and from those that wish to
share their experiences with me.  I was attracted to the promoter aspect
at one time, and at another I was allured to the controlled substances
that were readily available. 
There are some that will never "get it" in this cycle.  So yes, the
scene will always be sex, drugs, defiance against the MAN. Whatever... 

Now I feel that it's the acceptance of oneness that pulls me to the
scene. The ability to see all these perspectives at once and at the same
time keep my agenda and "spread that vibe".  Im in the scene for love,
no, not physical, but real love.  I choose techno, and I choose dancing
as a medium.  Others have chosen dance music, blues, rap, art, writing
to convey a message.  This is my choice.  This is my message.  And soon,
hopefully when I get away from the binds of this corporate society, I'll
be able to spread my message thru better medium, be it DJing, making
music. Something. It is on the horizon.

	MTV Changes Its Tune to Boost Ratings
	-----------------------------------------------------------

	(photo of album covers)  (text:) Prodigy, Spice Girls and Chemical
		Brothers will be featured in MTV's new mix of music

	(article text)

	MTV is struggling to stay [stay?] cool.

	Amid flat ratings and persistant criticism that it has strayed
	too far from its music video roots, MTV is shifting its schedule
	to play more music during the key weekend hours and is
	moving away from rap and grunge music, the two biggest
	musical genres of the 1990s, toward a more eclectic mix.

	etc

	MTV music programmers also are planning to change the
	type of music the network features - a move that could have
	a big impact on the $12 Billion recording industry.  After four
	years of heavy emphasis on alternative rock and rap music,
	MTV is preparing to put its hit-making machinery behind a
	far more eclectic mix of music, ranging from pulsating electronic
	dance music to more traditional pop music.

	etc.

	One new MTV show called "Amp" will feature the electronic
	music that is a staple of urban dance clubs and raves, or
	all-night parties.

	etc...

wayne- ( and others silly enough to be on sfraves when they should be
traveling to their thanksgiving destinations, or else planning for saturn 5)

[note bene - i'm not sure if this should be addressed to wayne, or if he is
just playing devil's advocate.  i'll address it to him, cause that's more
fun =p  )

>"Too bad there are people in our scene that try to coveniently replace
>alcohol with e and then try to get with everybody."

throughout my meager 21 years of existence, i have noticed that, in every
scene with which i have been involved, there have been people who "try to
get with everybody."  i have noticed this in the rave scene, in the small
facets of the industrial scene with which i have had acquantence, in the san
francisco music choral scene (in which i am very involved), in various
occupational scenes (both large and small companies), and in the academic scene.

throughout these various scenes, there are very few commonalities; in fact,
the only commonalities that i can see is that they are comprised of humans
who desire intimate contact with other humans and who are looking to their
environment for that contact.

different people choose to express their sexuality in different ways,
influences by a whole host of factors that i shall not try to discuss over
e-mail.  suffice it to say, to cut with a rather dull philosophical knife,
there are many people who choose to express their sexuality openly, and
there are those who choose to not express their sexuality openly.  these two
groups of people reside within every scene with which i have had
involvement, and they have used various means for that expression.

wayne, the people who you see "replacing alcohol with e and getting on
everybody" are the same people who would be doing that in any other scene in
which they are involved.  it is not unique to the rave scene.  they are
doing it because they are human, and humans have this wonderful tendency of
loving each other and trying to be intimate with each other.  we can be
idealistic about the rave scene and try to make it this pan/asexual mecca,
but we would be denying the sexual nature of our humanity at the same time.

i have no problem with people getting on each other in the rave scene.  if
they want to do that, that's great for them!  sometimes i want to do that,
sometimes i don't.  here's the question i think we SHOULD be addressing:

"how do we handle individuals under the influence of chemically induced love
who try to impose that love upon others who may not want to receive it?
i.e., how do we handle the influx of e-heads who feel love while under the
influence, but act like jerks the rest of the time? (i find those two groups
of people to be the same!)"

DISCUSS!

love to you all-

Okay folks, If you want or plan to goto Ubiquitous and want to meet up at
the hotel with us but have to work on friday then call 415-974-4357 some
time after 5-6pm and I will put info up on that number as far as what hotel
and room numbers we will be at. If you call at that time and there is no
info, then that means we are not there yet or got a room yet and try a
little later. If you plan on coming to the hotel after the party, then call
the info line and find out what hotel and room, you can leave a note on the
door of the room or with the front desk for me... Tim McDonnell.... I'll
check it every so often. I plan on heading to the party from the hotel
about 11pm-12 midnight.  The hotel with be about 10 minutes or so away from
the party, so it won't be that far away.

For those that have friday off and wish to caravan with me and a few others
please let me know now. That way we can all meet up on Friday somewhere and
head on up.  I'll most likely be at Thanksgiving thursday night so if you
want to talk then let me know.

Wow! This is something!  Its really not a bad thing all together.  I don't
watch to much tv, but at least I'll be able to see a video here and there
and it will be something I'd be interested in, hopefully.  I know mtv is
not everyones favorite medium, but it'll be better than some of the videos
they play now!

We can't keep our scene and music underground for ever, but we can
certainly be a part of keeping that underground vibe, and intimate events.
So no matter what the media portrays about our scene we are the ones to
keep it true.

Just my thoughts!

Noah Ruiz =)

Matt, what Wayne was, I think, getting at was this.... Certain individuals
use 'E'  to take advantage of the cituation. They know what it does and
fully use that in there favor just to get alittle action. They may or may
not take it themselves, but are aware of the females that are on it and go
in for the kill. Play on them and get them aroused just to have sex with
them for there own pleasure. Then when they find someone new the do it all
over again.

they pretend to understand everything and use the scene for there own
personal pleasures (ie..sex). this is not cool at all.  The kissey, touchey
things that goes on at "raves" while on 'E' are one thing, but using it to
ones own advantage is another. They try to use others to get into the scene
deeper just to meet more people for them to use and abuse. These types of
people should be pointed out and hopefully they will leave. I've seen it
happen and have actually tried to tell some women that they should be
careful if I see them with these types of people, there actually pretty
easy to spot even if you yourself are on 'E'. Whether they take that advice
to heart or not is up to them, but at least I have warned them.


I hope I made myself clear on what I was tring to say. I think faster then
I type and sometime get ahead of myself and type something in a way in my
not sound the way I wanted it to.

Yeah, I wish. We would no longer have problems finding locations to have
parties that's for sure.

As far as Earl Grey tea...doesn't it taste or smell alittle like Fruit

indeed, too bad. too bad there are people in the club scene, or the
business world, who do not respect other peoples boundaries, or use
intoxicants, power, or any other form of leverage to take advantage of
others.

i guess i would say that, if the rave scene is not about sex, neither is
your discussion topic. respect seems to be a more relevant idea.

but since you mentioned it ;)

as far as sex and E-- well, apparently it's different for everybody, but
most of the people i've talked to wouldn't want to actually have sex on
E... but the same people (including myself) have on occasion had positive
experiences with getting naked and exploring the sensual aspects of the
drug in a somewhat sexual way.

a question which really had me boggled for a while was, "what is the
difference between sensuality and sexuality." i started wondering this when
i had an experience with a good friend at a party in which she and i got
pretty intimate-- a sober observer would have said we were "making out"--
but neither of us felt that it was a sexual experience.

the question was answered for me when i had a similar experience a couple
months later with someone else, in which our hypothetical sober observer
would have noticed little difference, but we both felt a degree of sexual
energy there that usually isn't present in e-kisses.

so i guess the answer to "what is the difference between sexuality and
sensuality" for me is simply intuitive. i know it when i feel it.


and once again, there's a difference-- a BIG difference-- between having
mutual physical experiences with people and trying to push your sexuality
onto people who don't care to receive it.

finally, to answer the original discussion topic, yes, it's a shame there
are people like that in our scene. i had an experience a few weeks ago at a
rave, where i put my arm around somebody i was talking with, and she
thought i was trying to pick up on her (i was on e, and meant nothing by it
other than innocent affection)... that is the first time anyone has _ever_
thought i was trying to pick up on them, and the first time i have ever
crossed someone's physical boundaries. it was a sobering experience, and i
have to think that if there weren't so many disrespectful people in the
world, maybe she wouldn't have misinterpreted my intent. who knows.

love,

brian

This is even closer to that which makes me upset.

or, as Tim said, people who maybe are not on E but know how to use and
abuse people who are?

ok, lets start by dividing this into two categories: (1) situations in
which Guy tries to get physical with Girl and Girl is aware of it and
doesn't like it, and (2) situations in which Guy uses his "smoothness" and
knowledge of E in order to make Girl think he's acting innocently when in
fact he has ulterior designs.

situation 1 happens a lot, i've seen it many times. i've had female friends
come to me and say "so-and-so was getting a little closer to me than i felt
comfortable with...", and the question i always want to ask is, "did you
tell him to go away?" of course, when you're feeling all lovEy, the last
thing you want to do is hurt someone's feelings, but i really feel that if
someone is a jerk they should be treated accordingly.

situation 2, in which Guy is being really sneaky and manipulative, is
somewhat more difficult to handle. Tim noted that he can try to warn Girl,
but Girl is not always receptive to such warnings.

if i am a friend of Girl, i might try inviting her to spend some time
talking with me, thus distracting her from Guy. not always effective.

or i might try confronting Guy directly, risking open animosity between us.
this gets pretty touchy if Guy and i share a circle of friends...


hmm... no answers, but some thoughts.

love,

brian

     Yeah!!!  There's always room for more glamorous divas on the list...
     
     Go Larry, go Larry...
     
     I had something like that myself for a while, and I noticed that 
     wearing harder soled shoes made it better (like Docs), whereas softer 
     shoes (like modern running/basketball shoes) made it hurt more in the 
     long run.
     
     Peace you divine thing you,

     So, if anyone can recommend any places that sell 9-1/2 long E-width 
     shoes w/high heels that can be danced in, just drop me a line...I'm 
     short of the rest of the ensemble too, so any recommendations along 
     those lines would be appreciated...

YES MONO IS AROUND!!!  My SO is just getting over the worst of it, and as 
far as we can figure out, I gave it to him, unknowingly- it seems that 
you can carry it and never get sick from it, or only get a very mild 
case- according to the doctor you can carry it and pass it around for as 
long as 18 months....

I'm pretty sure I got it at a party....all those 
water bottles you share in those sweaty moments when you just don't 
care....I'm super careful now, and won't share a bottle- for everybody 
else's health, not just mine....

be careful you guys- mono is a nasty little disease, and I've heard from 
a number of people that the virus that causes it (EBV) is also suspected 
in chronic fatigue syndrome....It strikes when you are worn down and 
super tired from too much partying, studying working, whatever...ravers 
are a perfect target.

there are women who have used e to get a guy, also.  let's be a little more
careful about our use of pronouns.  i think some of the unspoken assumptions
like this can be just as dangerous.

raves are a wonderful place to appreciate people for what and when they are.
if you connect with someone for a period of time, that's when you connected
with them - not before, not after.  appreciate it for exactly what it was -
a connection.

i've been in that situation before, on both sides.  don't stress about it -
you may bump into him again, and you may not. and you know what?  both are cool!

love to you all-

Also, there are people (men and women, but I would say mainly women) who
use their "charm" and flirting to get drugs from opposite sex - sometimes
when the "drug providing side" gets too close they back off.  Think about
that....

hey all
I never posted anything to SFRaves about this thread previously but I
thought I'd take a second to say that I agree with all of you (esp
Brian)and have experienced/witnessed the same thing.  My girlfriend
raves and does E with me, and although we do spend +some+ time being
touchey and somewhat intimate while dancing...we usually dance in our
own worlds-to the music and enjoy our own space.  She knows alot more
people in the scene than I do, seems like they are mostly guys too. It
never bothers me and I always dig meeting other guys...but it is very
clear to me when her personal space becomes compromised by someone who
thinks that an ekiss or a hug means they have a green light to put the
moves on.  Some people just don't get it.  The positive vibe and good,
warm fuzzy feelings are about love and respect, not about horniness. 
oh, Happy Turkey Day.....

Hey, I stopped sharing bottles too. I feel bad refusing people, and
sometimes people can get a bit pushy (yes, even "ravers"). But it's MY
saliva, and I have the RIGHT to keep it to myself! :) And the right
not to have anyone else's.

I've been sick since the Harmony 3 year (I'm _finally_ getting
better), and I blame (among other things) being unconcerned about
other people's sicknesses entering my body.  Not everyone is as
careful with their health as I am...and sometimes all it takes is
sharing a little warm, murky water to get what they have.

So I have officially stopped sharing water bottles. If you ask me, and
I say 'no', it's not because I don't love you. On the contrary, it's
because I love us both. :)

health and happiness,
Steve

maybe girl should take a little responsibility for herself...she cant be

this can work...but if not effective...responsibility for yourself and

I would consider this dangerous and would re-consider my motives for not
wanting guy with girl...maybe of the purest concern but, 
	once again I will
pull out personal responsibility...if girl is big enough to go to raves
and take e then she should be big enough to handle herself with a
persistent, possibly "smooth" male (within reasonable limits of
persistence of course)
just my 2 sense...peace

Cool world has been doing this for years. . . I know many jocks, and
gangsters, and wannabees who made the New Years Eve Party their "RAVE".
Kinda sucks how soething that "we" kinda have for us, can be all jacked by a
bunch of people who aren't in the know.

        Actually, I was going to tell ya'll about somethin, but I'm not
going to tell you about the new years eve exotic erotic sex fest that they
usually have on halloween and new years eve. Too bad you probably don't want
to know that the halloween one was cool, and that it's an interesting little
experience for those not afraid of sex, or naked people, or any strange
parts of someones grandfathers anatomy gently brushing you as you make your
way through the crowd. So I'm not gonna tell ya that you might like it, I
guess it's just your loss. . .

Great topic.  Thanks for bringing it up, Wayne!

I'm glad Tony made the point about girls not being helpless.  I think that
is a good point.  Although women can be put in really sticky situations
out of their control, there is such a thing as free will.  Women do, can,
and should make their own decisions.  However, there is some concern when
these decisions are faulty.  Many women have a hard time asserting
themselves because they are taught that come-ons are flattering.  My own
mother always told me to say thank you to flattery, not really
discriminating between wanted and unwanted.  Of course I don't think that
way today, but totally overcoming your baggage is difficult.  It's hard
to say "go away", when saying so means that you are then a bitch.  I don't
really feel that way nowadays and have no problem telling someone that I'm
not interested.  And I don't really care anymore if someone thinks I'm a
bitch for chrissake.  I really frown upon unwelcome come-ons and actually
feel a bit sorry for the individual involved because I can't believe
that's the only way he can relate to a woman.  My way of dealing with it
is sheer avoidance.  I really try to avoid scenes that are high in the
meat market factor. And I am really careful about how I dress, which
pisses me off on one hand because i am changing my appearance based on
another's opinions.  But, at the same time I know certain clothes have
certain connotations and I need to be careful at times about that.  I'm
still trying to figure this dichotomy out and find some middle ground.
That's why raves are so special to me because it is like this little piece
of utopia (sometimes).

I really feel like I can dress in a certain way and not worry about it too
much.  And, my MOST favorite thing, I can talk to a guy, actually be
friendly and not worry that he is interested or thinks the same of me.  We
can actually talk as two human beings.  I can feel attractive or attracted
to individuals *without* being either predator or prey.  It's lovely.

Once at a party, albeit a bit shady (in my early days of raving where I
didn't know any better), I was sitting in the chill room with two female
friends.  We were talking, hugging, and having a wonderful time.  Guys
kept coming up to us and trying to "chat" with us, so to speak.  We really
were not into this and made sure our body language indicated that.  Most
of the guys got the hint, but this one dude just didn't have a clue.  He
came back THREE times to see if we had softened up sufficiently to let him
into our little circle.  We bluntly said "GO AWAY" and various other
sundry comments.  But, he kept coming back.  I just could not believe it.  
This guy had audacity.  I've encountered other men like that, but it
really is obvious and I'm getting pretty good at saying go away.  I
try to rely on myself to judge this and that's where I think free-will
comes in.  It's nice if you have a male friend there to help you out, but
women really should learn how to take care of themselves.

One more thing, women, in their own way, can certainly take advantage of
a situation.  It must feel pretty lame to have some cute girl get all
friEndly with you while high and then dis you when not.  
Girls have their own agendas and it's certainly not specifically guys who
take advantage of a situation.  I just think it's in a different way and
for slightly different reasons.

        You are soooooooooooo f***** cool I just can't believe it.
FINALLY!!!! Someone who's not into that E is good for you shit. Damn, it's
about time. Go get'em man, kick some sense into their happy little butts. So
many people are stuck into believing that E is the greatest creation in the
universe. . . anyone ever think that maybe being on E, makes you think that
E is good, you think everything else is better, why wouldn't you think that
the drug that made you this way was good too? I think that E can mask the
idea that you've actually taken a drug, and the peak n all from the E make
you love E. Isn't that why so many people are protective of it? If you like
it, you think that it's harmless, if you don't like it, you realize how
harmful it can actually be. Those who haven't tried it, only know the facts.
. . maybe we should find one of them and listen to what they have to say. . . 

But don't talk to the person about how good or bad it is before they make
their own decision.

Yeah, I wish. We would no longer have problems finding locations to have

As far as Earl Grey tea...doesn't it taste or smell alittle like Fruit

Also, there are people (men and women, but I would say mainly women) who 
use their "charm" and flirting to get drugs from opposite sex - sometimes 
when the "drug providing side" gets too close they back off.  Think about 
that....

Yes yes yes! Speaking as someone to whom this has happened a number of
times, this is my biggest complaint about the negative factors
concerning Ecstasy. Sober people have feelings too.

        Y'know, I'm not afraid of police unless I'm doing something I
believe is wrong. They're there to serve and protect. I've seen a lot of
police at raves, I've never been to a busted party. My girlfriends friend's
boyfriend was an officer at GAIA (or wherever). Everyone was cool, and you
could talk to the cops if you wanted because they knew what to expect at
raves, and it wasn't much of a big deal to see stoned or fucked or wired
teens dancing to death. They were there to protect us from violence, or
getting hurt, and that's all. Sure they may arrest a drug dealer, but only
if you really should be arrested. It's just another kid to them. It's not
like that kid selling E will fess up to all the E dealers in the city and
lead a state-wide drug bust or anything. Shit, sooo many police are used to
seeing kids on drugs that they rarely do much at all anymore unless you're
doing something ELSE wrong. If they busted one guy, they'd have to bust a
thousand others.

        Starchild and Pablo are like those hippies that "Didn't trust anyone
over 30".
Not all authority is bad. . . I mean, they're main purpose in life is to
make sure that the good people in the world are safe and comfortable, and
the bad people are where they should be. Times are changing. . .

Hi kids,

My friends and I are throwing a party in mid January, and I'm looking to
book dj's..talented novices encouraged.  This is not a rave.  It will be a
collective bunch of folks at a house in SF...Burning Man people, artists,
weirdos.

I'm looking for new talents to melt the wax.  Not necessarily techno,
though I will book at least one techno dj.  (to my dismay, I've recently
found that some "normal" people get wigged out by techno) I'm looking for
dj's who spin house, flam house,  hip hop, trip-hop, funk, reggae,  etc.
Enough to keep everybody happy.

We're not necessarily looking for Jeno/Garth style perfect beatmatching.
I'm more interested in finding unique & innovative dj's who've been hanging
out in their bedrooms for too long.

There will be alcohol at the party, so expect an eclectic bunch.  But don't
worry, Slider and Duke won't be there drinking whiskey and freaking on the
speakers.  (mainly because Slider & Duke don't exist.)

There will be no money involved, but it's a great chance for you to show
off in front of your friends and mine.  Depending on the number of
responses, sets will be probably 45 min to an hour.

Send tapes to:

Boomerang Fidget
Elevator Pop Gallery

or call eves 510-845-3566.

If you send a tape, please email me when you do and let me know so I can
keep an eye out for it.  And if the tape isn't perfect, don't freak out,
we're not performance nazis.  Just send your best.

Thanks.

Hi Aryck,

	I have NEVER taken E and have NO history of chemical abuse (however I do
	like a bevvy now & again). I've only been to a couple of raves in SF and
	have only recently seen for myself what E seems to do for people as a
	(passive) observer of others and friends. Apart from the physiological
	effects such as pupils like saucers (no wonder this list has many references
	to aliens) and innane grins [which I have constantly - the original smilee :) ]
	I wonder how much E actually contributes to individual and mass enjoyment. I'm still
	trying to determine whether the vibe at an event has anything to do with E or
	just the fact that most people there are just cool and would set the same vibe E or
	no E.

	I really have no problem with people on E, everybody has their poison, mine just
	happens to be the more old-fashioned beer & scotch!

	As for having somebody "offer" sexual favours for your drugs, just make sure you
	get yours first!

     Aryck,
     
     I think we're both alright people... it was a pleasure to meet you.
     
     But I have a slightly different viewpoint on the "responsible 
     officer..."
     
     Police are currently under too much stress with too little supervision 
     and not enough checks and balances to keep things safe for everybody.  
     I have heard too many racist slurs, and too many rushed justifications 
     from members of law enforcement to make them the catch all end all 
     cure for crime.
     
     My friend and I were crossing a bridge at night when I was fifteen.  
     We'd had a couple beers, and we were walking home.  My friend had 
     found a fire extinguisher on a lawn in front of some apartment 
     buildings, and put it in his coat.
     
     As we crossed this overpass (over the 405 in Irvine), we were stopped 
     by two police officers in a marked car.  They shined the car lights on 
     us and asked us to put our hands up.  Frank put one hand up, I put 
     both up.  The cop yell's "Fatso, put your hands up".  Frank looks at 
     me nervously and indicated towards the fire extinguisher which is 
     being held in his jacket by the other hand.  The cop yells again, and 
     he raises the other hand.  The fire extinguisher drops to the ground 
     and I suddenly realize that the police officers have their weapons 
     drawn.
     
     They inform us to turn around, while keeping our hands up in the air.
     
     I turn around, as does Frank.  They then tell us to step against the 
     barrier (about two-three feet high at the edge of the overpass...).  I 
     am somewhat afraid of heights, and not exactly excited about this, so 
     I announce that I'm not going anywhere, if that's okay with them.
     
     One of the officers runs up and pushes me towards the barrier, which 
     has trucks and cars and a 40 foot drop on the other side... I step 
     back, at which point I feels my knees get blown out.
     
     The cop had taken my knees out with his baton.  I yelled that I am 
     afraid of heights, and that I'm not out cause problems.  He asks me if 
     I'm a smart ass with my parents too.  They then ask for my id.  I 
     slowly remove it, and they review it.
     
     "Is that a Polish last name?"
     
     yes.
     
     "Well that makes sense"
     
     Huh?
     
     "Shut up"
     
     ....
     
     "I see you're under 18 here"
     
     Yes.  I'm 15.
     
     "Little late to be out... Stand up".
     
     I stand up and face them.  As I stand, I lose my balance a little bit, 
     and feel myself falling backwards (toward the barricade).  I lurch 
     forward a couple inches.  The police push me on the ground and both 
     officers (I think) hit me several times across the body and legs.  I 
     am in severe pain, but not reacting out of fear short of a few yelps.  
     I estimate I was hit some 10-15 times while in the fetal position on 
     the ground.
     
     As the second unit pulls up a couple minutes later, the first unit 
     tells them they had just broken up a fight, that they are almost done 
     with the report, and that the situation is contained.
     
     I am taken into custody, and released to my parents.  My mother never 
     believed me about that night.  I got two broken ribs and a black eye 
     in the incident.  I couldn't file a complaint without my mother.
     
     The police have never taken my cat out of a tree, never caught the 
     person who stole my first guitar and amplifier, never caught the 
     person who stole my car, have forced a girl to give them each a kiss 
     to avoid being taken in for under age drinking, have cost me $1300 in 
     warrants over a car parked for over a year with expired registration 
     on my father's property, have called me a faggot, a pussy, a rich 
     white piece of shit, and have broken up small private parties where 
     people of voting age quietly gather and enjoy films and music.  They 
     have never saved me while I was being beaten up, they didn't keep my 
     sister from being assaulted, and they gladly accepted money from a 
     shopowner who was about to be looted for taking the possible offenders 
     away after the LA quake.  They didn't even fingerprint my house after 
     it was broken into (with about $500 worth of stuff missing) and I even 
     told them what house the perp ran into.
     
     Cops have caused me more grief than good that I can see from here.  I 
     am very uncomfortable around police officers sometimes.
     
     I don't mind a point of view, but based on my life experience, I don't 
     want to pay into the cop monopoly to have my party stay "safe".  
     Offering to keep a party secure and unbustable by off hours police 
     officers and only off hours police officers is extortion/bribery of 
     the lowest calibre.
     
     The Officer Mike is a Good Man point doesn't really hit me as valid 
     100% of the time.
     
     Have I met good cops? Of course.  Do we need law enforcement?  Of 
     course.  Do I want to explore alternatives to having cops twist my arm 
     into paying them money to keep my party going?  Definitely.
     
     But nobody should be above the law, and currently, it seems they often 
     are.
     
     Peace,
     AndyW
     
     P.S.       I'm glad you know what kind of hippies Pablo and Starchild 
     are... but I'm going to wait until I meet them to determine what 
     they're like.
     
     P.P.S.     After talking about this, I probably do need a hug Ran...

ok, i'm sorry... no, i'm not sorry.

i did not mean to imply that men are always the manipulative ones or
anything like that... nor did i mean to be heterosexist...

i use him/her/Guy/Girl in stereotypical ways out of _convenience_.

i am certainly not trying to say that that's the only way things happen.

i'm the last person to promote the stereotyping of individuals, especially
on basis of sexuality, since i consider myself neither 100% straight nor
100% male.
:)

all clear?

Subject: Re: Why the boys in blue make us black n' blue

I'm glad that Andy wrote about the Irvine Police. I was another
pre-adolescent and adolescent victim of that greenbelt-lined police state,
and I am absolutely positive that my experiences, interactions and
observations with that city's police force have forever instilled in me a
deeply anarchistic establishment resentment for that fucked up place and
the people that run it.

Irvine has a special stigma placed upon it by "people who know." When you
tell then you're from Irvine, most people just nervously reply "oh." If you
then immediately explain that you'd ba happy if the place were burned to
the ground, they under stand that *you* get it. Get it? Let's just say that
it's a place you are very glad "you *used* to live if you are any kind of
free-thinker who no longer (or never did) find salvation by participation
in mindless neighbor-neighbor competitions to see who could buy the latest
3-series BMW first.

The Irvine PD, as a group (yea, group!) were the most arrogant,
boundary-overstepping piece of fucking shit organization I have ever dealt
with. They are are collectively all corrupt bastards with badges.

The story Andy told is just one of many, many stories to tell.

Andy and I both grew up there in the brown-shirt and black arm-band wearing
"kkkommunity of Irvine", and it sucked. Irvine is a special "artifical
reality" community where everybody's supposed to be at home when they roll
up the streets when the street lights go on. If you aren't, or if you are
any minority (asian doesn't count!) inside the city limits, you *will* be
stopped by the police and interrogated as to what you are doing inside city
limits. This is *no joke*.

Here's a very, very small glimpse into the Irvine Police:

The Irvine police were expecially good as "busting" skateboarders and
bicyclists and sending them to "bicycle school". I think that this was
their "most positive" (read: least oppressive) contribution to the
community as most of their other hijinks went downhill from there.

There was an officer named S.M. Soto, this chubby little hispanic guy that
looked like he could have been straight out of the movie "The Good, The Bad
and the Ugly". The problem was, he wasn't dressed like a bandito. He was a
cop. And he -personally- had ticketed each and every person I knew at least
once. He prided himself in setting traffic ticketing records every month
and every year he was an officer there, and many, many of those tickets
were bad ones -- i.e. "Tell it to the judge! I'll be there -- I get
overtime for court pay!"

He even got me once.

Everybody that I new in Irvine had their own "Soto" story to tell. Repeated
complaints to the IPD resulted in nothing more than a later promotion of
him to a motorcycle officer. I won't even get into all the stories that I
have been told about this officer -from the people it happened to-, but
there are two in particular that were amazing boundary-overstepping tales
I'll save for a party since my fingers would tire if I wrote them all.

Then there was the "Captain" of the Irvine Police Explorers. He was quite a
guy. The kind of mid-thirties type that you would see running a "boys
club", except he was a senior officer on the IPD, and, of course, had a
badge. And guns, and cop cars and cool radio equipment. All the stuff to
impress the boys.

This was probably my freshman year of high school... Well, I had a couple
friends that were explorers, and they told me they were having a good time
doing that, so I approached the explorers about helping with a couple 5k or
10r runs or something. The first thing I noticed is that this captain guy
kinda gave me the creeps. Then he tells me "Your father's not a cop, he's
nothing more than a glorified tow truck driver with a gun and a badge. I'm
a real cop." -- Well, that kinda put me (and my father, who was still an
active CHP officer at the time) off, so I quit the explorers before I even
really had a chance to join and forgot all about it.

Well, wouldn't you know, that bastard was secretly taking all the explorer
boys up to his ranch in Riverside and sodomizing them in his spare time --
and he finally got caught! I don't think he was ever prosecuted for those
awful crimes but they did ask him for his gun and his badge before they
played down the case. Oh well, how will he pick up all those unsuspecting
boys without the cool cop car and guns to impress em?! I'm sure he figured
it out since he surely got another chance.

We once had a locker inspection for 100% of the lockers in our school
because *one* student was caught with a joint. The IPD personally searched
all of our belongings and our lockers as a result of it. I don't know if
this was a violation of civil liberties, but in Irvine, this kind of
frenzied harrassment was quite the norm.

We had a really nice guy at my high school that got pulled over one day in
his VW bug for an unspecified reason. (i.e. a typical "he's young, let's
randomly detain and search him" opportunity.) He was one of those really
positive, really together student-council type people -- liked by all,
accomplished, etc... Well, he had one of those Wink mirrors in his car (one
frame that comprises many small rear-view mirrors angled to give you really
good visibility.) Well, one of the mirrors had fallen out of his Wink
mirror, and was on his seat or in his glove box or something, and the cop
noticed it. So, of course, the cop decided that this guy must be a coke
fiend, having this loose small mirror and all, and immediately arrested him
and searched his car for "more evidence of wrongdoing" I suppose.

Well, this guy happened to be a martial arts student and had his dojo bag
in his car with a pair of nun-chaku (spelling?) in the bag. Well, posession
of those as a weapon (i.e. non martial arts training and use) is a FELONY
-- and even though this guy was a martial arts student the cop didn't care
so he was immediatly handcuffed, thrown on the ground face down with a
cop's boot holding him to the ground by his throat, then taken to jail, car
towed, etc. Our student friend later remarked it was too bad he wasn't
carring a gun in his car since that's only a misdemeanor.

Another person at my high school was stopped for "a traffic violation." The
police officer decided that since he was young, he probably didn't
legitimately own the nice stereo in the dash of his car. So the police
officer detained him and insisted that he disassemble and remove the stereo
receiver "so that he could run a serial number check." Well, he did remove
it under the threat of arrest if he didn't comply and, of course, the cop
found "nothing comes up in our database." So there this guy is on the side
of the road with his dash totally disassembled, etc. You get the point.

Another friend was pulled over *twice* in one day for simply driving around
town in a late 70's Checy 4x4. Typical IPD harassment.

Oh, and to top things off, our mayor, a Viet Nam vet, watched Apocalypse
Now one night on cable TV and decided to shoot his wife in the head with
his .45 auto. He was politely asked to step down from the office of the
mayor but on the next elections he quickly won a city council seat after
that and, of course, was never charged with a crime. He later ran again for
Mayor but I was so disinterested in the "superficially beautiful utopia"
that was Irvine that I merely reduced my exposure to that community to just
sleeping there until I finally moved out of the city when I was 19.

Basically the rule was: If you were young (i.e. under 25) expect to be
pulled over somewhere between once a week and once a month, just to be
interrogated and/or intimadated. If you were of any age but not driving a
late model car, expect to be pulled over - period. If you "look bad" expect
to be arrested for some trumped up reason "to be sent a message". The
fundamantal principals of Irvine and it's willing participants are that
everybody strives for Nuvo riche, upper middle class working professional
keep-up-with-the-Jones'-sameness. If you don't fit in that mold and you
don't aspire to be that, and the "community" realizes, expect to be
stopped, harrassed, and ticketed/arrested until you leave their beautiful
greenbelt-lined utopian world.

I did enjoy some "revenge" though. When I was watching Independence Day, I
was much amused when they went to "El Toro Marine Base" (in Irvine) only to
find the whole fucking town leveled to the ground. There is justice.

Even to this day when I go back inside city limits (less than once a year,
thank god) I feel like somebody is choking me. The police oppression there
is really that chilling.

Mmmm..the comment about hearing the Jaws theme was funny ...
I think u prolly only got to check the European charts to see what'll
happen , the good stuff remains underground and the cheesy
versions sell to the massives proving very little indeed . I mean ,
we already had " I wanna be a hippy " at number 1 , a dutch
happy gabba tune with " Maroo Marooana...wanna be a hippy
, i wanna get stoned " as the lyrics...altho they just sang
maroo maroo maroo on tv , so I'm kind of unmoved by the 
possibility of main stream stuff . Right now , the underground
scene globally just survives , vinyl is largely bought only
by dj's / bedroom dj's and its hard to promote instrumental music .
If this exposure can , ( god forbid ) , get some decent music
into the ears of the MTV crowd , then it could be a good thing .
I say could , cos there is the beer boy rave crowd in Europe too ,
but really , those with taste stick together and altho u;d see more
events , switched on folk like the SFRavers would know whats
cool and whats not . It'll be interested to see if the big labels take
the bait and start signing up some REAL acid bands .

yours rambling on ,

I am going to get yelled at for this by one of a few people but that's ok, 
we will sort it out....

> another's opinions.  But, at the same time I know certain clothes have
> certain connotations and I need to be careful at times about that.  I'm

	My question here is why do things that are dangerous to wear make
people want to wear them. I am not defending anyone in this case, I do not
mean to, male people types need to keep their hormones and power trips at
bay. But I have wondered this - what is the reason women what to wear
certain clothes which from the outside look ridiculously uncomfortable.
There seems to be this thing that "pretty" clothes make women feel good,
but I cannot see where that feel good is coming from...  Except from
either a pre-programmed baggage of these clothes = feel good or (and this
is where people will jump on me) from the flaunting of sexuality with a
release from responsiblity that may come from it. Ok, let's get one thing
striaght here, I have no experience as a woman dressing up in "clothes
that one might avoid" (I assume these to be alluring or something like
that) so I am in the dark on why women like wearing them.  I understand
how some clothes can be feel really nice, but then there are clothes that
just look fucking uncomfortable and do nothing but accentuate those 
things that are supposed to be sexy by boosting and cramming and creating 
more and tucking here or whatever other ways clothes are suppose to make 
the female human body more attractive...
	So maybe I am way off base and all alluring clothes have a silky
caressing feel and that is why people like them - I just do not understand
where the these alluring clothes make me feel good comes from, and the
only conclusions I can see are either women being duped into wearing them
through advertising and societial pressures (and if that is the case, then
why do women expect to be treated any differently then how they behave? I
do not see how women can expect men to break their societial conditions
that women must be possessed and that body type A is the only attractive
body type, when those same women cannot decide for themselves what they
want to buy and wear. Fuck, it isn't easy but it is what has to be done.)
or because they want the attention or maybe the power of being alluring
(is there something else I am missing here). In either case, the attention
has its responsibilities associated with it and the power trip will
hopefully be met with an equal power trip to balance things out... 
	Now does this make women evil? What about guys who think they are
just being friendly when in fact they are pestering some girl or passing
her boundaries under the guise of showing affection (well, as a guise to
the guy himself) such as a tight warm hug. Do that make guys evil too?
	My response to both is - without the realization of what they are
really doing, or what the underlying motive is, there is something missing
to be really evil because with the knowledge of an evil intent they are
trampling over other people's feelings or bouindaries (without that
knowledge they are ignorant creatures which will hopefully one day stop
troding on other peoples experinces). I believe that such a trampling will
be repaid at some point with an equal or greater trampling (another ramble
for later maybe) unless people start paying attention to what they are
doing while they are doing it. Because after the fact, you can send a
million years analyzing the situation and see it through millions of
perspectives. At the end of the day, one is most likely to use some other
perspective than the one that applied at the moment the action was
happening... Is this what people mean by living in the moment? I suppose
that is a topic for another ramble...

Well, after a long absence due to a lot of things not worth going into
here, I've got time again to get back on the list.  Hello and a virtual
hug to everyone, especially those who have given me rides when my car
was dead (and you know who you are).

The following statement kind of struck me, especially after my
experience at Wyrd, which was bouncy, sweaty, energetic, and a great
deal of fun except for one niggly detail that bugged me (and no, it
wasn't the line for the bathroom >%^)

> >you don't need e to have a good time.
> >
> >???!! yes. it's true. you can have fun at a rave without drugs.

The *ONLY* person who I didn't already sort of know who said anything to
me all night said, and I quote, "Do you have any E?"  Now I admit to
giving and receiving my fair share of grins and goofy looks all night,
but the fact that this was the _only_ thing anyone decided to actually
ask me was kind of disheartening.

Oh, you know Michele?    =]:..
  Actually I admire some of the women that use charm to get free E.
  I have sercomed to this type of seduction a few times. Even when I am
sober, it is strange how I willingly give away 15 bucks to a total
stranger.
  But I feel good doing it. So it don't bother me one bit.
  I wouldn't give a youngin free E though. Only someone in control of them
selves 100%..

    While on this subject about sex feinded ravErs, I would like to point
out another side of it. (Brief)
  I know for a fact, there are alot of women / men in the scene that are,
spoiled bye these blunt men / women that go only to pull the one timer.
  I've noticed that when some women find me attractive, they will actually
just stroll on by, and expect me to do the talking. And they actually get
offended when I don't.

 I could really go into it but.  I am working on other E-Mails right now.
And I am working on going out tonight and, having a ravEr four day weekend!

The new Wired (spare me, I know, but I do read it) has an interesting
article about how Federal Express represents the dissolving of the
traditional manufacturing-distribution-retail three layer system into
direct manufacturer-customer commerce.  

Warehouse and light industrial space doesn't stay empty for long --
a decade at most.  Then it's converted into offices and lofts.  What
happened next door to 1015 Folsom is indicative of the future of SOMA.
I expect the number of venues there suitable for loud all-night events
to diminish quickly in the next few years as the old spaces are 
reoccupied by long-term office and residential tenants.  Those of you
who work in high tech/net stuff there are already part of that.  This
isn't necessarily bad, but the lesson it teaches is that our scene,
when it's healthy, thrives at the margins, picking up the detritus of

	When "should" someone be arrested for the nonviolent act of
selling a drug?  Never, in my opinion.  Even if you disagree Aryck, what
makes you think cops only arrest those who deserve it?  How the hell can
they tell the difference?  Like you say below, isn't it often just another
kid to them, or just another juvenile delinquent?

It's just another kid to them. It's not

	No, unfortunately the way the game is played now, they don't.
They can pick and choose. They are under no obligation to enforce the laws
fairly.  They can bust you for driving 70 in a 65 zone, and ignore the guy
that goes speeding by at 80, and there's not a damn thing you can do about
it.
	Furthermore, many laws are *meant* to be arbitrarily enforced;
they are written with the expectation that cops will routinely look the
other way when they are broken -- unless they don't like the way you look
or something.  Where do you think we get the term "throwing the book" at
someone?  It means to charge someone with all the infractions that are
normally ignored.  This kind of power in the hands of the police leads
naturally to corruption of the type seen in many countries where bribery
is a way of life.

	I'm not sure that slogan was ever meant to be taken literally,
however in any case I believe that mistrust of government power is a bit
more well-earned.

	... and so are laws, thousands are passed by our elected and
unelected leaders every year.  Do you know what they all say?  Do you know
that you're not breaking the law right now, that you haven't become,
unbeknownst to you, one of the "bad people"?

Rotten to the core,   ;)

warning: this post not for the meek or those with short attention spans!

hrmf. adam deleted the original message, but the subject line caught my
attention, being something i've pondered heavily in the past few
weeks...

the sex-hippies-raves-capitalism-society connection is complex
relationship that could easily be a 10 pound book if put into print.
seems that most of the people in RaverLand (as is the case with most of
the U.S. population) have a nagging aversion to sexual expression.
what's going on here?

this summer, I finally made it to the Burning Man festival. one of the
greatest things about Burning Man was the lack of "lifestyle police."
Left to their own devices, most of the participants let loose, but kept
to the one rule that was as much a part of the festival as the Man
itself: Do whatever you want, however you want, as long as it doesn't
infringe upon the enjoyment of the festival by someone else. This seemed
like such a simple, enjoyable way to live. Though far from being Utopia,
the festival really inspired me, and made me look at the society i live
in from a completely different point of view.

At the dawning of the Age of Aquarius, sex was viewed in a very
uncomfortable light by the american public. Ricky and Lucy Ricardo slept
in different beds! IT (read: sex) was something that everyone knew was
around, but nobody talked about. The hippies saw how it was, and
countered with their own view of sexuality. Free Love! This went against
what was "normal" at the time, but again, the emphasis was on freedom of
expression, so long as your means of expression didn't harm others.

but, you see, Capitalism has a funny way of taking its worst enemies and
using them to its advantage. I mean, you can BUY a piece of the Berlin
Wall! jeez! And those advertising agents on Madison Ave...they know and
realize now that SEX SELLS.

...which brings us back to the ravers.

Raves are meant to be a sanctuary in a world gone mad. People come to
have fun and express themselves in a setting that was created for that
very purpose. But what if (consenting) people wanted to express their
sexuality in that setting? It would evoke extreme criticism from most
Ravers. But why?

Well, sexuality seems to be viewed by Ravers, who for the most part,
were raised in the American Consumer Culture, as a tool of Domination
and Sales. The natural reaction to that view would be an abandonment
(supression?) of sexual expression. Ever notice the unofficial "uniform"
of the scene seems to be overalls? -- practical, non gender-specific
clothing.

But all this supression of sexuality seems rather artificial to many. It
looks as though after the dust from the rebellion against (or secession
from) American Consumer Society settles, Ravers are going to realize
that they've abandoned, or maybe just forgot, a major part of the human
experience. Sexuality doesn't have to be used to sell commercial time on
daytime talk shows! It can be a powerful ally and friend, and a
wonderful way to express love for another person. Don't let anyone take
it away or tell you that it's wrong or dirty.

Now, many people seem to think that Raves and the Rave Culture will
point western civilization in a new direction, away from the cold,
social Darwinist Cult of the Consumer, and towards a more open,
accepting, and compassionate future existance. Possibly, but the
Lifestyle Police are in the Rave Culture too. There are those who
haven't learned to accept their own nature, and attempt to impose their
values (and insecurities) upon others. This runs contrary to the nature
of our Scene, and only serves to hinder the progress of our Culture.

To the Lifestyle Police:
Try to have some faith! Let people decide how to express themselves. As
long as the underlying "don't ruin someone else's enjoyment" rule is
adhered to, i don't see how this could be a problem. I realize that most
people aren't comfortable with the images this might invoke, but
remember: if you don't agree with what you see, you can always go (or
look) elsewhere.

No. I guess the Rave Scene ISN'T about sex.
But should it be completely DEVOID of it?

  I've been doing research on SOMA, and agree completely with Fred's
observations. The derelict warehouse spaces are being snapped up at a
dizzying rate and converted into lofts and offices, or else torn down
completely and made over into high-revenue spaces (condos, upscale
corporate satellites, etc.). 
  The president of one company in the 600 block of 3rd Street said that
the rates in his building had gone from 45 cents a foot a year ago, to 80
cents a foot when he signed his lease 6 months ago, to $1.05 now --
expensive, but still a bargain compared to the $2 a square foot in Silicon
Valley.
  I looked at some lofts on Tehama Street last week that were pretty raw,
but still going for $240,000-$280,000 -- and they are selling.
  According to USA Today (if Phred can read Wired, I can confess to USA
Today), there are around 400 multimedia companies in SOMA right now, and
the numbers are on the way up -- as are the numbers of services that
support the folks who work there (copy shops, cafes, etc.).
  So... if the nighttime warehouse rave scene is going to stay alive in
SF, it looks to me like it will have to migrate further south into China
basin, and come up against Portrero Hill and Hunter's Point.
  Anyone with other ideas on this movement?

Unfortunately, i think the death knoll for raves in that part of the
city including China Basin were rung with the passage of the measure to
build the Giant's Ball park but China Basin is the best way to go
for now.

One thing that I observe in many people who use drugs and/or alcohol ... is
that they are using them as a tool to alter their behavior....

I often see people who are drunk or high allowing themselves to do the
things they wish they could do all the time (albeit often more sloppily)
... you know, the drunk who is more outgoing and friendly, or is saying the
things they were too chicken to say when they were sober, or the e-head who
is hugging and touching and expressing their sexuality, or telling people
their real feelings when they'd never do that in a sober state (one of my
boyfriends calls e the "truth serum").

If you are someone whose behavior changes a lot when in an altered state,
take a look at it.  Why?  What is it that you aren't expressing in your
daily unaltered state that is trying to be let out? What are you
repressing?

If you wait until you're high on e to express your sensual/sexual side, you
MUST find a way to learn to express that part of yourself when you're
sober.  If you need a few beers to get out on a dancefloor and dance, or to
talk to people you want to talk to ... you MUST learn to do that without
the chemical assistance.

This is all a learning experience ... and if you take a look at what you do
when you're inhibitions have been lessened by chemicals, you'll see the
part of you that needs expressing ... learn to do it!

Every time you alter your state, look back later and ask, how did I behave
differently than I would have if I were sober?  Think about why.

And once you learn to express yourself more consistently in your life, you
won't have those ridiculous "I can't believe I did that!" blowouts that
result from what you've been holding back exploding when you finally lift
the cover on it!

  The issue isn't to what ends man has applied its knowledge.  The fact
that the advances we have made, and we _have_ made advances, required
language is the point.
  Animals, like the _domesticated_ house cat, are not the best example,
I'm sure you'd agree.  Some animals live brutal lives based on those
"lower functions."  

  And language skills are essential to _avoid_ the problems you
mentioned.
Here is a Hawkings quote which I think is right on target...

For millions of years, mankind livd just like animals.
Then something happened which unleashed the power of our imagination.
We learned too talk.
And we learned to listen.
Speech has allowed the cuhmunication of ideas, enabling human beings to
   work together.
To build the impossible.
Mankind's greatest achievements have come about by talking.
And it's greatest failures by NOT talking.
IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE LIKE THIS!
Our greatest hopes could become reality in the future.
With the technology at our disposal, the possibilities are unbounded.
All we need to do is ...
  make sure ...
    we keep...
      talking .

  and pretty quick.  I mailed out a check on thursday and had them on
wednesday.
  BTW, I seem to remember someone posting other information on getting
glowsticks some time in July or August but I can't find it.  I would
check the archived mailing list on the webpage, but those files are
pretty damn big.
  Anyone remember?  The post was mainly describing the benefits of blue
sticks I believe.

  Well, my copier is made in Tapei, some other companies make theirs
there as well.  TONS of piracy is based in China, but it doesn't seem to
be as specifically based in a small location as with Tapei.
  I dunno.

let's not forget that e was originally used as a psychotheraputic drug to
help people realize that expressing their emotions and desires is okay...
Some people (even some ravers) use E in a constructive way to try to get
in touch (no pun intended) with parts of themselves that they are scared
to explore otherwise...

just thoughts...

I think you're right on with this assertion.  I do feel though that if
parties (at least undergrounds), were throwm in Hunters Point you would
have a better chance at success.  The REAL problem with hunters point and
"ravers" is turf respect.  You have GOT to have buy-in from the locals,
otherwise you are nothing more than an interloper and trespasser.

Equinox & Vortex parties were thrown in HP with great success.  The real
issue however is getting protection from, er, break-in that WILL OCCUR IF
YOU DON'T PAY THE PROPER RESPECT TO THE NEIGHBORHOOD!  It can be done, you
just have got to know who to go to and who to trust.  Even the cops in HP
can be cool (an undercover cop came into a Vortex, checked it out, wished
us good luck, then left.  It as all good.)  No problem from the locals from
what I recall.

But then again, nothing is supposed to last forever.  The rave/dance
community is so fractured, and is such a loose collection of people ,
everyone with different goals, that establishing a presence is next to
impossible.  As I have said in the past, if people were to present a
unified front, we wouldn't have to scramble for places, permits could be
obtained much easier, and there could be more frequent events.  If there
weren't the animosity between promoters, DJ's, and other elements, and if
people acted in concert for the common good of dance culture, the scene
would be a bit more viable.  Since no such coalition exists, we, like other
fringe movements, will always be pushed farther and farther to the
edges...always near the brink of becoming obsolete (the numbers in
attendance are proof.  It is about 1/3 of what it was in '92).  Compare
this to the clout the gay community has in SF.  Cops DARE NOT bust up a gay
event, or come down to hard on them (do you think the Townsend security are
as hard on the gay patrons using drugs as they are on the straight patrons?
No, the treatment is much, much heavier with 'straight' parties...I don't
even think they try to search the gay bros & sistahs).  Why?  Becuase gays
in this city are organized, have political and economic clout, and have a
definitive presence in the community....unlike 'ravers' who generally party
during the weekend exclusively. I am not sure whether 'dance culture' is
really viable, even after 6 years I have a tendency to think all of this is
a phase, and will be replaced.  Sex clubs have lasted despite AIDS, I do
not think dance culture has such resilience.  Especially with all the
forces against it:  'legit' club owners, promoters underhanded tactics,
'legit' owners in cohoots with the cops in payola schemes, 'legit' club
owners making sure UG's don't happen and employing the cops as their droogs
to shut down UG's, and suspicious fire-marshall activity.  Nope, since the
dance community (i.e. ravers) are not organized, I am afraid that it will
always have to deal with the push and pull of other forces who have a
vested interest in the culture not thriving, or thriving in a more profit
alcohol driven dynamic that involves the govt. & the police.

nonviolent? i suppose so in a phsyical sense. but there are certain kinds
of drug dealers who _should_ be busted.  the ones who cut their shit and
don't tell you, the ones who have no idea what exactly they are selling you
or lie when they tell you their mdoh is mdma, the ones who don't really
give a fuck about you past your $20. those are drug dealers who should be
busted.

use common sense. you wouldn't walk down a dark street in a high crime area
wearing an expensive coat and carrying $1000, why would you smoke a joint

Well, after a long absence due to a lot of things not worth going into 
here, I've got time again to get back on the list.  Hello and a virtual 
hug to everyone, especially those who have given me rides when my car 
was dead (and you know who you are).
     
The following statement kind of struck me, especially after my 
experience at Wyrd, which was bouncy, sweaty, energetic, and a great 
deal of fun except for one niggly detail that bugged me (and no, it 
wasn't the line for the bathroom >%^)
     
> >you don't need e to have a good time. 
> >
> >???!! yes. it's true. you can have fun at a rave without drugs.
     
The *ONLY* person who I didn't already sort of know who said anything to 
me all night said, and I quote, "Do you have any E?"  Now I admit to 
giving and receiving my fair share of grins and goofy looks all night, 
but the fact that this was the _only_ thing anyone decided to actually 
ask me was kind of disheartening.

Well, just called the infoline for Ubiquitous, and apparently "they
weren't welcome in Sacramento" but have still managed to find a new
venue that's "the bomb". And I guess the location is somewhere else
than Sactown, 'cause the message said "if you're going from Sacramento,
you must leave early". If you're thinking about calling the line,
wait until after 5pm tomorrow, the directions won't be in place until
then. Oh wait, what am I saying? Like anyone on this list could=20
actually go to a MASSIVE... *grin*

Dear SFRavers,

My computer tells me that on Thu, 28 Nov 1996, Argon 99 shared:

	I guess I was a bit too general in saying no drug dealer should
ever be busted.  What I meant was, no honest drug dealer should have to
worry about it.  Any merchant intentionally misrepresenting their product
or telling you something about it they don't know to be true should face
legal repercussions.
	If your drug dealer doesn't love you as a person, on the other
hand, I agree that this is too bad, but do they deserve to go to jail for
it?

> "no brain, no pain"
> use common sense. you wouldn't walk down a dark street in a high crime area

> or shoot up in front of a cop?
> -brendan

	Isn't this called blaming the victim?  We already know that not
everyone exhibits common sense all the time, and common sense tells us
that people who don't use it are already going to have a tough time in
many situations.  
	It's easy to say "tough shit, shoulda known better" to people
lacking street smarts, but shouldn't we as a society strive for a
higher standard than that?  Shouldn't we have a goal of a world free from
crime, both the kind committed by hoodlums in dark alleys who feel no need
to justify their actions and the kind committed by hoodlums with badges
who use the law as their justification?

For liberty,

Hey everybody! ;)

I just found this book in the bathroom at my mom and dad's house outside of Detroit... 

I am such a sap! I must have cried through reading pretty much the whole thing and a 
good few minutes afterwards. I suggest picking this book up if you are into what it's 
talking about (as if it really makes a difference what I think, :D). There are some 
very nice illustrations. :D

This goes out to all of you, like it or not! ;)


About Friendship
Thoughts, Hopes, Reflections

Written (and illustrated) by Lynne Gerard
published by C.R. Gibson Company

-
Dedicated to friends who come & friends who go... wherever the winds may take us, fond 
memories of times shared will forever remain.
-

There is something exceptional about friendship, which is life-giving to the soul.

Without, or from within, a divine destiny shapes our lives and impresses upon us the 
importance of good friendships.

The people we meet, especially the friends we keep, are sent to us... and we are sent 
to them, for the mutual purpose of support and discovery.

This means that our friendship is not a chance occurrence...

....our paths have crossed for a special reason.

You and I have been given the oppurtunity to consider life through each other's 
personal perceptions.

I take notice of things you feel are important...

...and you are aware of things I hold dear.

Friendship helps us develop greater sensitivity and empathy,

as we learn to respect a different point of view.

The bond of friendship gives us a better understanding of ourselves and our place in 
the circle of life.

Each of us is an important part of all that is.

You are unique and I am unique...

...each of us possess special God-given apptitudes.

Friendship is like the rain that nourishes, and the sun that encourages growth.

Through friendship we help each other recognize and develop our inner potentials.

We share each other's sorrows and joys.

We uplift each other when apprehension tries to overcome hope.

We give each other the courage to use the strength within to preserve and triumph.

Like the chickadee sings a song of praise, like the tides embrace the shore, my spirit 
rejoices in the magic of you and me.

Life is much more than what is seems, and much more than what we know...

...for each day is a new discovery, and we cannot say what tommorrow's wind may bring.

Yet, of this I am certain; knowing you has made me a better person,

and I will forever hold a part of you within me.

Friendships help develop awareness and understanding.

I don't think it made the calendar, so I'll post it in case anyone's
hunting for something to do tonight (Thursday nite/Friday morn):  There a
great party going on at 150 Folsom!  Wayne and I ran home to get a needed
piece of equipment, but things are definitely hopping!  This is the first
event hosted by Steve Simitzis; come on out!  Things should be happening
until at least 6am.

The DJ lineup is:

 Mystr-E (frequency 8)
 John Carel (gateway systems)
 Anon (look for her at mantra :)
 Warren Parker (one track mind)
 Jon Logan (ambiance during dinner)

 voicemail: 415.248.1997 (saturn5)

Happy Turkey Day,

Hi agin! ;)
 Following is another little dittee from yours truly...

Wednesday, Outside Chicago: missed connecting with hion, he must have had to do some 
laundry or something. his friend Ericka and I hooked up and went down to the funky 
little ticket place and picked up our $10 (oops, forgot our canned goods!) tix to this 
vibeonauts/mushgroove par-tay "Blessings"... Followed the direx to the Maywood Civic 
Center. hmmm, party in a public space, interesting. Once, inside (12:30a) found a very 
happy and friendly crowd, some familiar faces (Alex and Eric), but more than anything a 
DAMN vibe, waiting to blow! [matter side steps here, to inflate the 'frisco scene; some
fellow par-tayers have informed me that the par-tay I am describing here ain't nuthin' 
compared to 'frisco -> I can't wait!] After phantom 45 ended his set (nice junglism 
[has a small place in my heart]), not sure who was up next, but that's when it started 
to happen... MINGLING! That's right! Phuckin' mingling at a CHICAGO par-tay. I didn't 
believe it! Now, granted, there were still a handfull (5% or less) of ppl who were just 
not with it, but that's kewl, whatever. Everybody else made up for it, WOOOOOO! I gave 
some very *nice"* folk some goodies (PEZ whistle, cassette of me/my bro) and got some 
great stuff back (kewl x-mas pencil and KERMIT PEZ container), but more than the stuff, 
I met some really great folk at this one! I know, you're prolly thinking, oh that 
matter, he's always happy and saize every par-tay is the best yet, etc. BUT REALLY, 
this was the best yet! I love you all and I hope it jus' keeps gettin' better, forever! 
;)

Finally, I am going to get to sleep! Get this: I drove to Detroit immediately after 
takin' Ericka home (left nw-chicago burbs at 8:00a), arrived in Detroit around 3:00p. 
Always a joy driving by the world' largest trash incinerator (ackkkk, cough!) I must 
admit, I got a few hours of zzzz's b4 going out with a friend to the Grosse Pointe 
hangout "Tap Room", where they were playing Underworld! ;)

The only problem is rave is nota religion, and there is no sacred texts
regarding rave/dance culture.

As for what is important, I think if you ask 100 participants of dance
culture what is important, you would have 1,000,000 different answers.
Mathwise:  You know how ravers/partyers go on and on about the unity, the
love, the so on and so forth ad infinitum.  So I have averaged it out to
1000 things a person could find or babble on about.

Given my expertise in the subject, I *am* the undisputed expert in all of
this (if you dare not believe me, just ask me), I have reduced it to the
ultimate denominator:  "It's just a party."

Now if that is what is important, then so be it.  But why do we have to
remind ourselves of it every so often. I have an answer to that too; it is
because we go on an on about the other tired ass subjects that are a part
of the community.  Hmmm cyclical?  Perhaps.  Rambling?  Always. ;)

I'm out,
John

P.S.  Happy Holidays and many ;)

The one in "Sac" is really in SF tonite. But based on where it's happening,
I doubt it will go all night, so get there early if you want to party.

Or go to Saturday night's Spacechildren's "Be Here Now" and Tribal Funk's
combined party. It's gonna be BIG.

I'm in Vancouver, BC for the weekend visiting my sister. I think there are 
some Vancouver people on the list-- do you know of any parties this 
weekend? (I feel the need to bust out...)

and that's an excellent metaphor, and i hope that was part of the idea that

drugs are just that: training wheels. they can be used as a tool in aiding
you to find your "inner self" or whatever you may be seeking, but there
comes a point where you can have the same insight, without drugs. when you
can do that, then you don't need to use drugs all the time to explore
yourself.

not that drugs are the only path to that spot, but it is an option there
for people to *choose*. with that choice there is greater responsibility,
never forget that.

take care. hope everyone had a good time gutting the bird.

I just wanted to drop a line to let my friends and family on both ends of
the state know how thankful I am for all of you!  Thanks to you all, I
have had the best two weeks in recent memory!  It seems like I have
finally gotten out of a big psychological slump that had me down and now
things are just getting better and better!  For example, today, I received
my diploma from UCD registered mail!!!  Now I have that bad boy to remind
me how much money I spent over the last 4 years! :)
I'm thinking about going to Out-A-Sight (LA) tomorrow... my buddy
Joe is down in the southland visiting his folks for the weekend, and 
being newly inducted into the scene, he is anxious to go have some
fun with Uncle Noah and this seems like a pretty good party for a
Saturday night... anyone have any suggestions?

And again, a big hug to all of you for being such a great group of people!
We are all one big family.  We don't have strangers around us, just
friends we have yet to meet!  I love you all!  :)

Hey all,
I'd like to ask a favor of my fellow ravers.....
I'm doing a paper on raving and E. Why people rave, why they take e, and
why there is such a close connection between taking e and raving. 
Although I have textbook sources and enough personal experience to write
this paper, I am interested in hearing/reading other people's personal
insights also.  Everyone out there articulates their feelings
differently and I'd like to see what a few different perspectives are. 
Of course, total anonimity can be garanteed if so requested.  I'd be
willing to send anyone a copy of my paper when I'm done if so
interested. Cheers!

I rave for a variety of reasons.  First of all, it's just a total relief
from the everyday world for me.  When i'm at school or working, there are
like so many obligations and duties to fufill and when i'm out raving and
just dancing away, it's like i'm in my own world with all my fellow
ravers.  We are just like one big family.  I, personally don't do E
because i would so fucken messed up that i don't think that i'd be able
to function normally again.  I did E once or twice a while ago, i felt so
unlike me, that it was just such a bad experience.  And besides when
you're with a whole bunch of people on E, its like one big orgy.

I also rave because it's fun.  and i love meeting new people.  I'm really
friendly and when i go to raves i just try to make new friends all the
time.  And i  also love the music.  I just in a total state of trance
when i'm dancing for like 6 hours straight.

About your paper on raving: 
For the record, I am extrememly new to the scene (but maybe that means
I'll have a fresh perspective; who knows?), but there seem to be two major
influences drawing me more and more into rave settings:  first is the
music.  I love (and write) electronic music, and it's nice to hear so
many people doing *sooo much* with it!  Also, (for me, at least), my first
Exceptionally altered state induced a new appreciation and realization for
certain aspects of the music (i.e. the builds that disassemble the
beat suddenly, then gradually reassemble it to the rhythm of a building
acid bassline) that  I've been able to hang onto and recognize even in
complete sobriety.  I wish I could explain this better, but I fear I
would only talk in circles on this, or get overly technical with music
theory (which I'd be happy to discuss ad nauseum, if I thought you
might be interested; alas, I drift off-topic already...).  The second,
undoubtedly, is the caliber of open-minded people one can find in the
environment.  I know it's been said before, but I can't emphasize
enough what a massive relief it is to have the socially oppressive
norms of the outside world slowly evaporate in such a positive
environment.  Even with my limited exposure to date, I can already see
that I am not alone in this belief.  A great many folk also seem to share
the common goal of the enjoyment of life, even if for no other the purpose
of creating happiness itself.  Anyways, that's my $.02, let me know if I
can help you out any more than that.
(BTW, please send me a copy of the paper when you're done; I'd be very
interested in reading it; thanx!)

Enjoy life-

I have been told that the manufacture of "E" creates toxic waste on par 
with the manufacture of speed.  I don't know any hard facts about this 
but wondered why this was never a discussion topic among ravers (being so 
Eco-conscience and such [pun intended]).  Where is all of this waste 
going?  Do we care?  Does anyone know the facts about the 
destructiveness/potency of such waste?

I'm interested.

Hi All,

just had to tell ya about our friday night.  Started out with our 
mother's great turkey dinner (yum!) but the night quickly went wacky...

Started things out at a friends house waiting for the entire group to 
collect.

Drove all the way from simi valley to fullerton for the F.A.M.I.L.Y. 
party, straight thru the door, started a little entertainment and groovin 
into the funky breakbeats blaring from the wall of the speakers, when 
suddenly...

the lights come up!   The party is busted!  DOH!  So OK, not the best 
time to be on the move, but we head up to LA proper.  Apparently the 
promoter is going to get all 1000 of us into another party for free :-)

So we get up there, park, chill for a bit, then hit the door.  Sorry, 
gotta pay (again), AND we hear that the FAMILY party has started up 
again!  Aaaarrrrrggg!

So we chill out at Jerry's Famous Deli for a bit, hoping for the late 
night crowd, but surprisingly, few people were there.  Then finally made 
our way back to the folks house.

So, all in all, I am missing you all, wishing I could be at a San Jose 
shindig instead of partying at zero decibels in my old room at the folks 
house :-)

peace

deeje

was a hella bum party.  Welcome to Club X is what the name should have
been.  The ravers were out numbered to the clubbies.  It was overly packed,
you had to pay $5 to go, and worst of all the party stopped at 2:00a.m. and
the promoters knew this was going to happen (from what I have heard)  There
were total non-raver vibes in the place, not all of the DJ's spun last
night, and if you didn't go YOU DIDN'T MISS ANYTHING!!! They continued to
sell tickets for the party it seemed for a long time, and most of the
people who showed up late had to stay outside and not go in.  So they paid
for their ticket to stand outside and do nothing.  They played a lot of
house club crap. And it was a very disappointing party (club would be more
of the word here)  Anyway I think you all get the point that the promoters
just need to be shot or something.  Hope to see all of the true ravers
tonight at Be Here Now/Tribal Funk!!!!!  Peace, love, and harmony,
Eric

Did anyone go to the Phish concert last night? It was amazing!!! They
have the ability to jam for hours and make out of control rifs connect.

I agree w/eric, I dont think it was fair to tell everyone the party was
free, then charge five bucks!!!  even though thats not much.  If the
party had gone all night it would have been cooler.  They should have
closed the map point at around 11:00, then it wouldn't have been soooo
packed!  I feel personally riped off, cause they threw our logo on their
flyer, and I told them we would lend 'em some of our props, then they
told me they were charging, and that they were at 444 DeHaro!!!!  NOT
COOL! 
Any way Ghostribe did not throw that party, I wish promoters wouldn't
screw-up like that.  It just makes it harded for the rest of us.   Keep
Smilin',

I rave because rave is the first thing in YEARS that has made me feel 
truly part of a community.  I love almost everything about raving - the 
music, the lights, the strangers, the scents, the clothes, the toys, and 
the amazing friends i have made through this scene.  Nearly everyone i 
have met through raving has been cool in their own weird, funky way.  
(there have been a few REALLY FUCKING ODD exceptions - but i don't dwell 
on them much. *grin*)

As for e ... i enjoy that sensation of light floaty vibrating sensual 
pounding energy that seems to fill my heart and body all night long :)  
but i save it for special occasions.  once a month or less.  I enjoy it 
too much to want the feeling to get stale, besides the fact that taking 
it often is hard on your system and wallet.

But most of my closest rave friends were NOT first encountered in an 
e-induced stupor ... if that's significant :) as a matter of fact, 80% of 
my buddies i owe to the Internet!

Hey guys I'm glad to hear your feedback... me and my friends drove ALL OVER
until maybe 2 or 3am looking for the space - never did find it (we heard 444
deboce or something so we were on the wrong street!)  Anyway it's good to
know we didn't miss anything...  can't wait for tonight though - see you there!
Driving around with cool friends can be as fun as raving...

Just about everything you say Eric.



















   IS TRUE!

But I had a real good time. 
And the ravers that were there, seemed to be bumping out enough happy
thoughts to keep my reality just were it belongs.
The place was really small to. But on the message it said: (We have a
secure location in the city, still large enough to fit our needs) There
needs? That front lobby we were in wasn't even 5,000sq ft.
And it sure was convenient how the BayArea location was equipped with a 21
and over bar, just like the 150,000sq ft. warehouse was suppost to of had.
So I would have to agree with the romurs. I think the promoters new what
they were doing.

Hi all!  =)

 Sorry for the spamming, but I thought there may be people scattered 
throughout these three lists who would like to read this.

 Saturn5 was the first party thrown by Steve S. I think he did a damn 
fine job of it!! We had the amazing Gateway sound system (and equally 
amazing crew!!), Greg Sandler (of Harmony) provided the brain numbing 
robotic lighting, Nub Chai provided the ever needed and delicious chai 
that only THEY can provide!
 
 The DJ's were wonderful also. Jon Logan (of ambience at dinner  ;) 
provided some tasty tunes at dinner/snacking time. Jon Carel (of Gateway) 
was next. Jon had to overcome some big bellys that were keeping some 
folks off the dance floor but by the time he was done the floor was 
equally full.

 Mystr-E (Frequency 8) was next and he really started to get the place 
rockin'. Then the cops showed up! NNNNNNNNNNNNN!!!!!!

      !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Huge Props To Thomas Trouble!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

 Tom got us a back-up site in no time. The sound system was moved over 
to the Berkley location and we were off!

 Mystr-E continued onward with a great sounding set despite some 
technical flubs.

 The ever wonderful Anon was next. Her set was REALLY good but was very 
short. Wanh!

 The surprise of the evening was the last set by Warren Logan (of one 
track mind). This guy was GOOD!!! He had some really tasty songs and 
technically he sounded super! I can't wait to hear more from this guy!!

 I felt that (back at the original site) we had a good visual show going. 
It was a blend of Greg's robot lights, Dimension 7's video work and my 
slides/lights/decorations. I think we all blended well together and 
really produced a fine looking party.

 Thanks to all the super wonderful volunteers, without whom we never 
would have had such a good time; David Lowe, Terry (of CT Design), Matt 
Lanier, Andy W., Sarah, and a ton of other people whose names I missed or 
forgotten. Thanks also to the Dimension 7 crew!  :)

 Again; Thanks to Steve for an amazing party and for going way beyond 
what most promoters will do for their partys. With people like Steve in 
the scene, things can only get better.


   !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!STEVE ROCKS!!!!SATURN5 RULES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!


Happy Holidaze to everyone!

Hi all :)


 I needs to ask some favors again. Sorry for taking up banwidth and your 
time.

 Dionysus Dreams needs to get from Santa Cruz to San Francisco for two shows;
Mantra on Dec. 6th and Freaky People on Dec. 13th. For both shows I need 
a good sized covered pu or van and need a return back to Santa Cruz. If 
you can only go one way but want to help please contact me anyway. 

 I'm also looking for volunteer crew type folks for both events. All 
interested parties should email me privately.

wonderfullness and joy,

        Just so everyone knows, it is at Homebase wherehouse, or at least, I
don't know of any home depot off hegenburger. And $25 is waaaaaaaay too much
to spend for a sweaty ass funky, greasy, smelly, humid, barely able to
breathe (or walk without slipping) gangster party which it will be. That
wherehouse sucks, and with the amount of people it will suck even more. 
        You can only make a party as big as the space it's taking place in,
and the space isn't too big. Every room will be overcrowded, someone will
probably slip and fall on their butt. And you will go home feeling like crap. 

        My advise is, if you have E, get lots more, eat most of it a half
hour before you get to homebase, and keep it comin as it wears off. To me,
that's the only way you could see the place as cool. If you're sober, you'll
be hatin life.

        Last time I was there, half of the gangsters were walkin around with
40's, the other half were hitting on my friends. 

Decide for yourself. I live here, and I know the dumbasses who'll go there
and get all drunk. . . (there not my friends though).

SMILE:)

Hey everyone. In case you don't know by now. Space Children and Tribal
Funk are combining parties at the Home Base Warehouse. (usual place,
boring, unimaginative).Yet anything is better than what happend
yesterday. I give props to any raver that survived the horro at
Ubiquitous. The so called FREE party that with a cost of $5 per ticket.
Thats incredibly cheap, but many of us didn't bring money because it was
a ahh,err, FREE party. Right?
If you called the voicemail, it said, "we as a people have been banished
from Sacramento." blah blah blah.
I wonder why they were banished?
So they decide to have it at some bunk ity bity place. If you got to F8
early in time to receive directions (before midnight) since the place was
over max occupancy?
What is this max occupancy? I've been to parties where they cram as many
people in as possible.
Not only did they refuse to stop giving directions. They didn't even
announce it on the voice mail. I feel sorry for all the people driving
from the farthest reaches from the gallexy to go to this to find out they
only that they need to go back because they decided to not let anymore
people in. Super Cool? Hu?
And Then there was some rumor of it being on the street Duboce. This is a
residential area. I highly doubt it was there.
This might have been almost enough to tick people off. So then it is time
to annoy all the people lucky enough to get in.The party was incredibly
clubbby. More like Planet X. The music was like listening to the radio
with Jose Melendez's mix on Wild 107.7  It got broken up at around 2:00
am. Not really since they had decided to kick evreyone out at that time
and they had planned on it in advance.
Then there was the talk about an after party in Fremont. Yeah as soon as
you got there they told you to leave. Some party hu?

I don't understand these people. If you say its a free rave than its
free. if you say its in Sac, its in sac. Don't misadvertise a rave its
not cool.
I hope to see everyone at Space Children Tribal Funk.
PLUR
Paul

Undoubtably many illicit amphetamine manufacturers just pour their
solvents down the drain. (Someone with a bit more knowledge can describe
what they are - presumably chlorocarbons and other nasties.) Others
may be more careful about disposal, but legal disposal may be tricky
due to licensing requirements.

This "amphetamines are bad for the environment" line strikes me as a cheap
attempt by the powers that be to co-opt environmentalists' support for
their propaganda. If the powers that be were really that concerned about
the environmental effects of illicit drug manufacture, they could easily fix
the problem: legalise and regulate the manufacture of the drugs. But
somehow it seems they're crying crocadile tears over this one.

As for the destructiveness: at a guess, the solvent for a few hundred Es
is comparable to the vinyl in a car, for example.
