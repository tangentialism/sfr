Oh geez, what a strange night. Gateway and Pacific threw an *amazing*
party, but (of course) it was busted by Officer Not-so-friendly and
had to be shut down at 1am. 

Fuck that! It's New Year's, for god's sake... Can they just let a
bunch of people be happy for once? I find it so sick that the
government considers a permit (which is just a piece of paper) to be
so much important than the happiness of their citizens. Our government
is Pathetic. To make matters worse, it was clearly a dangerous hour to
be driving home. Drunk drivers, wind and rain, etc.

Freedom of assembly? Oh yes, that's right, the law in the City of
Oakland takes precendence over the Constitution. Silly me, as always,
I've forgetten to read the fine print.

CCC unfortunately was full to capacity. It really sucked after walking
there in the pouring rain only to get turned away, but it happens, and
I can certainly understand. So we're just going to hang out at
Natoma-on-the-Lake until the Hunab-Ku after party. Thanks, Jonas, for
having that party. :)

I've spoken to some of you about this before, and it is definitely
time to change the cabaret laws in the city of San Francisco (I rave,
and I vote!).  Seriously, way too many parties have been busted
lately, and it's time for this to change. Instead of fighting and cursing
at the Law, *we* can change it through ballot propositions. 

Well? Anyone else up for this? I propose a meeting sometime this
month. With some research, a lawyer or two, a petition, and some
financial backing, we can have a ballot prop for 1998 to decriminalize
dancing. I'm sick of complaining. It's time for *change*.

I hope all of you in Montery are having a great time, and I wish I
could have been there to share it with you. :( Happy New Year
everyone!!! :)

Steve

ok, our party got shut down before our very eyes almost at exactly
midnight, new years eve.
Ok, police got a little crazier than they needed to.
ok, we hung out in the rain for 2 hours waiting for both parties to 
    out.
ok, sticking around does pay off.  There was a teeny party after almost
everyone left.
ok, we had to wade out to our jeep, in at least 12" of flooded street.
ok, we almost got into two accidents on the way home.
ok, we got lost in Oakland.
now we're home and everything's ok now.
<sigh> it's just another night.  Bad things happen, but write it off and
have a Happy New Year! :)

OK, we get there about 6:45, tons of security, noone knows 
anything. I'm trying to get in because I was supposed to be 
on laser crew (the only reason I spent my night at cool 
world), and I keep getting sent from one person to the next. 
7:30 rolls around, the doors are open, and I'm still 
standing outside waiting for god knows who to finally figure 
out why they should let me in. By this time, one of the 
staff security guys offers me two comp. tickets, just so I 
can get in and get to work. 8:00, finally I am in. I realize 
this night is going to be an unorganized nightmare.

OK, things go relatively smoothly, we get the first laser 
system up and running in the theater, and all that. 

10:00 and it's time to start up the laser in the main room. 
On stage, on the runway, the crowd was being entertained by 
teeny-boppers, with the DJ way far from the front of the 
stage. Then comes the live performances.. o boy. They we're 
pretty good at that lip-syncing thing, besides that, they 
sucked. 

11:30ish, they're done performing (yay!), and Dj Ghost is 
on. I've only heard ghost a couple of times, and both times 
he's started his set with my oh-so-(un)favorite phone sex 
record. After that record had been playing for about a 
minute, I notice 3 new people on the runway, giving the 
crowd their own live (clothed) sex show.... lovely. After 
this, the stage becomes packed full of scantily-clad 
teeny-booppers, strutin their stuff all over the stage (some 
of them earned a few bucks, too, probally for showing the 
crowd their g-strings). H

Happy New Year! Balloons fall, someone rambles on the mic 
about the new year, and a bunch of other unintelligable 
stuff.

1:30a, the theater is packed full of people, and some fool 
decides it's time for fun with the fire alarms! Managment 
gets mad, closes the theater, and the chill room soon after.

Main floor is now packed. People are hot and pissed, but the 
night goes on.

Somewhere between 3:30 and 4, the lights start coming on. 
Guess what! An early night! At the time, I was very excited. 
So the all the lights are on, but the music keeps going. I'm 
walking around asking security whats going on, and noone 
knows... big suprise. Finally one of the staff security 
dudes starts telling Garth it's time to stop, party's over. 
It took a bit of yelling for Garth to stop. I asked one of 
the management people why the party was shutting down, and 
find out Cool World broke their contract with HJK, because 
they didn't have any medical teams on duty. That's not the 
story the crowd heard, however... they we're all told it 
was because people had kept pulling the fire alarms. 

Now the fun begins. 

Incoming! The first bottle hits the stage... the next thing 
you know, they're coming at us from all angles. I rush to 
protect the equipment, while ducking behind road cases, to 
avoid the next juice bomb. Over the speakers, we keep 
hearing the words "patience" and "peace" over and over. Too 
bad noone cared. The bottles kept flying in for the next 
20-30 minutes, weird purple juice stuff and glass flying 
everywhere. We keep wondering where the cops are. Finally 
two cops are backstage, and I find out there's a lot more 
officers in the front of the building (great place for them 
to be, while we're all getting attacked). Well, finally 
20-30 cops come in backstage, dressed in full riot gear, and 
get almost everyone out.

We clean the weird purple juice stuff off the gear, pack it 
up, and leave.

Definatly the most interesting New Years I've ever had.

The End.

   Well I must say that if it was not for CCC allocating so much time
prior to the actual event, distributing tickets via BASS. Then finding
out that tickets are selling for $35 at the door, I really was expecting
something along the lines of Disneyland and Eden combined in large
"well  staffed", check every last item so there will be no chance of
tangling the vibe, once it started building up. Unfortunately I have to
comment about the medical staff statement. If I were to rent, say a
large sports arena for
holding a CPR training class for 15,000 people. Security services are
included "hello" in the contract. That means that the Convention center
provides the security and any other emergency service which might be
needed to deal with the type event you "plan" to have.
   Fire Alarms, Fire Trucks, or not enought band-aids, new microphone
volume knob, items like these should be collected and recorded to
something like a "check-list" maybe? I have learned one valuable lesson
from all the chaos. Don't piss alot of people of when they are dancing!

The recap of my experience first:

Last night, I was going to stay home, but decided to go to the
Gateway/Pacific party with some of my closest friends.  We arrived at the
location around 11:30 to find a several cop cars and a long, unmoving line
up the alley.  The music was coming out of the warehouse on the left-- the
Origin party-- and the warehouse on the right -- the Gateway/Pacific party
(cool-looking 2-floor brick warehouses).

There are cops in the street and one (the nice young Asian one in case you
were out there) tells the crowd that the party is being shut down.  We
wait, not wanting to believe, but it's true.  At about 10 'til 12, they
begin asking people to leave.

As I walked the crowd, looking for missing friends, I had the great
pleasure of handing out the New Year's fortunes that I had made.  The Asian
cop took one and thanked me, said it was perfect for him (it said "in 1997,
pay attention to spending more time alone"!) and he'd put it on his
refrigerator.

He told me he appreciated my presence there (I guess because I wasn't just
yelling at him and was trying to remind people that we need to behave with
respect even when our party's being busted, because it will reflect on us
in the long run) .... and I told him that that street was FILLED with
wonderful positive people who only wanted to go in and dance with their
friends, there was little bad about it, except now, they were being put on
the highways at midnight on New Years, and I hope all of them made it
safely where they were going.

And so the new year came as I milled around such a wonderful and
interesting crowd, it was pretty intense, the combination of the positive
potential and the disappointing reality.

The cops also assured me they were shutting down the Origin party next.  I
assume the whole process took a long time because they then aggressively
cleared the street, and Steve said the inside party didn't shut down until
1 am, an hour later.  I wish I could have been inside with everyone.

(And hearing about the Cool World event, I suspect that  "bust" was just
one in this whole series of crackdowns on raving.)

Now my concerns about responsibility:

The nice cop told me that the problem was lack of permits, which would have
required certain security provisions.  We hear this over and over, and we
also hear horror stories of trying to get the proper permits.

I see both sides, and I value the underground scene, but it seems to me
that there's no way a large party, especially next to another large party,
on New Year's Eve, can possibly expect not to be "noticed" by the
authorities.  This would seem to me to clearly show that ALL permit
processes must be observed so that the party is LEGAL.  Not taking care of
business is ignoring responsibility.

That responsibility is to the rave community, and to the people who paid
$20 for a ticket, and who committed this special evening to share with
their friends in that place.

Promoters are providing an environment for a positive experience, and part
of that environment is a sense of security, that, as much as humanly
possible, that party is not going to be busted.  Yes, sometimes of course
we choose to take chances, but in my opinion, New  Years Eve in that
location is not one of those times.

I believe that it was the responsibility of those throwing the party to
either follow the rules or to accept that it just wasn't possible to do a
New Year's event this year (which is sad, but to me, not sadder than how I
and many others ended up spending their New Years).

Galen apologized on his voicemail, saying "it was unavoidable."  I'm not
trying in any way to single out anyone (especially since both Gateway and
Pacific give SO MUCH to our community) but I am saying maybe it's time that
we wake up and find a new way to play the game, because it's clear our
current "close-your-eyes and hope-they-don't-see-you" way isn't working.

I'm tired of being so consistently busted, and I think we need to
strategize how we can keep this from happening.  "Unavoidable" doesn't cut
it with me .. we need to learn how to avoid busts, even if it means fewer
parties.  Busts are bad for everyone, and do NOT forward our cause in any
way.

Maybe this means we work with the authorities in a new way, maybe it means
we only can have small small parties, maybe it means .... something else.
I don't know, but I'm happy to be a part of the solution in any way that I
can.  If anyone has suggestions of who we should be working with and
talking to, who we can write to, or has things that I may be overlooking
about this and other recent bust scenarios, I'd like to hear.

Maybe a "committee" of representatives of the rave community can present
our case to the authorities to try to work out a solution with them,
because, like it or not, we need to understand them and they; need to
understand us.

Working with authorities doesn't mean not being underground - - underground
is about how parties are publicized, it doesn't have to mean illegal.

Bottom line, we have no rave scene if we are constantly busted, and the
more busts there are, the more busts there will be.  I want to party,
please!

Love and hopes that 1997 brings safe and joyous dancing to us all,
Leslie

(p.s.  to those who kept asking about "getting their money back" I'd like
to again remind you that Pacific brings your FREE Sunsets almost weekly for
8 months a year)

  Knowing how ultimately crowded the cities would be, I avoided everything
and went to a few smaller parties with my friends.  (No, this had nothing to
do with my age.)  We wandered around meeting people and finally settled at
someone's house to count down to 1997.  As soon as the count-down was over we
ditched our champagne glasses and headed back out to another house.  Partied
there for a while, caught up with a surprisingly large amount of people I
knew.  Travelling with my own music and as many black lights, strobe lights,
and portable systems we could cram into the car definately made the party
wherever we were.  (At least I thought so.  But who cares when you're having
fun?)  At some point during the morning I decided to bless my parents with my
prescence, and headed home.  Their party, that I had so carefully avoided,
was still in progress.  Mingling with adults isn't my thing, but everyone was
so punchy the jokes kept me smiling.  I waited for everyone to leave, and
once again left my champagne for another activity... sleep.  It wasn't a very
eventful or riot-filled night, but considering how sick I am, I think I did
pretty well.  Happy New Year everyone!!!

           hugs,
            'trice                     <<<<RAVEON>>>>

 P.S.  This is a question for Ran... your closing signature reads, "Namaste."
 Would that be the word meaning "I recognize the god in you" from Budhism?  I
can't remember which religion it comes from.  It's a perfect closing for a
letter on this list.

..After reading about Cool World and Pacific...imagine that the party was
held in a warehouse that houses a rockclimbing school.  No need to ransform
the space, it's already surreal looking inside, with 18 tons of cut up
rubber tires for the dance floor..lots of bouncy fun, and paths everywhere
else, with twinkling lights. Great computer light show on the walls...

the cloudfactory dj's played in pairs on 4 turntables...pounding,terrific,
crazy all night...deaks/tim, drenalin/sabin, scott/swoops....k-go/and
?....cool idea....worked great, someone else will probably write more about
the sets...I'm a little too tired right now......

A cop comes inside, over by me at the computer table, to look at the
equipment..he says.."great party..looks like you guys are having a lot of
fun..."  That tells you something about what the vibe was like. I talk to
the owner of the business, and thank him for letting these kids have such a
great party. He says he was a little worried...but everything was cool. He
touches one of the rockclimbing walls and says that with the bass pounding
it was kinda like having an earthquake indoors and wonders what it would
feel like to be scaling the walls while the music was playing. Heavenly.

I'm gonna go to bed now, but I know the cloudfactory boys even impressed
themselves with this party. Great space,great music, great people, etc.,
doin it right, and all for $10.00!!!! They deserve all the credit and
another feather in their cap for putting on "raves," not ripp-off parties
for $35.00.

 I met Micron and wanted to have him introduce me to a lot of sfr people I
haven't met...but, next time.

Happy New Years all!!!

	Still haven't slept yet, had to let everyone know C.F. was really 
the place to be this year. And I guess what happened w/ Gateway getting 
busted around MIDNIGHT (yuk) really sealed it.

High Points-

-A very unique space. An indoor rock-climbing facility. Wow! A nice 
change of pace from some of the dirtier places to party around the Bay 
Area.

-The shredded-up rubber material on the floor inside the place. (Like 
someone threw some CLEAN old tires in a giant blender?). A very 
refreshing surface to dance on -- footing not TOTALLY solid, but my 
normally concrete-weary knees were in heaven from the nice cushy effect. 
The stuff was great to just chill in, too. And it's a good thing, too. 
Spent a great deal of the night just sitting w/ my fiance, who was 
feelin' ill all night :(

-*Perfect* capacity. Especially for a New Years event. (no way was I 
personally ready to deal w/ a Cool World-size crowd!!) About 350 or so is 
the number someone @ the map point told me. Plenty of elbow room, and 
actually being able to RECOGNIZE people!!!

-The beats were intense! It was cool to hear some hardcore, some drum n' 
bass. The set immediately following the countdown was very eclectic, very 
cool. But Cloud and whoever was spinning w/ him between 2 and 4 really 
tore it up!!

-The crowd was awesome, very vibe-oriented it seemed. Kept reminding 
myself that this is why I went w/ a relatively underground party this 
NYE. Four Twenty really stretched out until shortly before five, and I 
got the chance to smoke and talk w/ some very cool people (Hey Uncle 
Noah, Chris (Pac Bowl shirt) and Sean (Shawn?) from Santa Cruz!!!)

Some Low points :(

-getting HEAVILY disrepected from two people who I guess actually ran the 
business during it's "Normal Person Hours". Both insisted that they had 
told us numerous times to not smoke where we were (the rubber was highly 
flammable). All that had been done was a pipe was packed (in preparation 
for the windy outdoors) and someone flashed a lighter to find something 
in their backpack. Straight up being called a liar when I told the guy 
that "NO ONE had approached me or my friends all night and told us not to 
smoke" and "Sorry" and "We weren't even planning on it". They still 
took some convincing after all that. Still a mystery to me how they got 
confused.

-The outdoor area was being blown about pretty heavily, a little too much 
to be enjoyable -- the tent raising off the ground, only shelter being 
the "Chill Trailer". Only reason this was dissappointing was I built up 
the idea of a spacious outdoor/patio area too much. Nobody can help the 
weather, though.

Nothing much more to bitch about. All in all, one of the most enjoyable 
parties I have been to this fall/winter. Cloud Factory, give yourselves a 
BIG hug for this one.

						Hugs :)
						DAVE


-Swear to god there were multiple narcs there. Did anyone else sense that

Even though the floors were way to slippery, I had a pretty good New Years.

  I don't blame the people for there behavior when the party stopped.
Everyone was pretty bummed when they said "parties over" on the stage but.
People didn't really get pissed off, tell after that stupid lady on the
microphone started "laughing" and telling everyone they had to go home. She
didn't have to be like that. "Hahaha, nee ner nee ner. You all gotta take
off. suckers"
  Much thanx to all the idiot taggers that attended. There was more
graphitti in that place than on all the walls down 880, from San Jose to
Oakland. Thats one way to bring our community together, or whatever it is
ravEs are suppost to do. It's funny seeing people in the parking lot,
stashing there markers down there pants. Must be hard, only having a talent
for scribbling..
  I like the tiny bopper dancers on stage though. Thats fun. Ever been to a
Brasilian party? But the Wild107.7 materialistick hoochie momma's on stage
freaking each other... Bla bla..... Save it girls.   =]
  
  Anyone get a hold of them Blue Cats Eyes last night? Can anyone say
rollercoaster to hell? Damn that shit was intence..!  For about an hour I
had to be babysitted while E'ing my ass off on the balcony... Much PLUR
goes out to Jessie for sticking with me through that.

  I like Dj Ghost but. You sure he played last night? Couldn't see the
turntables. It sounded like they were just playing his tape.

  I get a kick out of how the Security and Bar tenders start dancing after
awhile..

  I had fun damnit!    I saw Adam too..  Kind of.. My vision was blurry....

Now that I've heard the bottom line-- Cool World Lies-- 
Cool World is out of my rave schedule for good.
$35 and they couldn't hire security with half a brain, nor could they 
hire the contracted medical help, ultimately causing the shutdown..

I've been ripped off.

I made the best of the evening, had a good time being with friends and 
there was positive energy present I just had to filter it from the rest..

To the idiots tagging the walls and pulling the fire alarms of the beautiful 
facility I give the big finger.

PEACE
HAPPY NEW YEAR!!

well!  i'm glad i stayed home and ate chocolate and indulged in luxury
bath products and smokeables instead of forking out $40 or so to go to any
of these gatherings that got BUSTED immediately ... not that i'm surprised
... the cops seem to be on a very harsh WE MUST STOP THE RAVE SCENE AT ALL
COSTS! trip lately, both up here in the Northwest and down there in SF.
Sad, isn't it.  *sigh*

peace to all and let's hope '97 is a LOT better than '96!

Okay its 9 o'clock, im on my way to New years Eden to hear Dj sin tear shit
up... I arrive at the location and I quickly notice that im in the
ghetto.....part of the ghetto! Anyway, i go inside and I see pools of water
on the floor, a couple of guitar amps and junked cars... I talk to Sin , he
wants to bail cause this is really scary, nobody is even there  so we all get
in our cars and decide to search for the Pacific party! 

We get to the map point and i buy my ticket... The whole time im calling
people telling them what the situation was like( Sorry Sweatie!!!)
Everythings cool, really nice production, every room had sick visuals... Come
to think of it this was one of the best productions I think i have ever
seen.. so much effort!! anyway.. im dancing my booty off, when i see the fuzz
the music stops... then 10 minutes before NY's it starts back up... everyone
screams!!! But alas poor yorick we were just being teased....the music was
shot off at 1 am and all those really violent drunk ravers where sent home! I
hope everyone I know, and don't know for that matter, made it home safely... 

I don't think the cops even care who they are sending out into the crazy
weather and scary highways n stuff...:( It was trippy have the parties so
close to each other....
Couple of things I don't understand though... Why did origin make people go
all the way to Sf if the party was in Oakland???? It would have been cool if
everyone got togeather and people could just go from party to party...Oh
well, I saw a lot of really cool people, I raved into the new year and I
think it is time to make a change... 


THE RESPONSIBLE RAVER COMMISSION... Lets make a change, lets make it easier
to get permits... lets cause commotion.. lets not just sit back and say Ok,
Mr. officer, what ever you tell me! FUck, we pay there salaries, you think
they could be a little more respectful, but they where just doing there job..
Anyway... i hope everyone had a safe and happy new years...

Sorry for the rambling, I am being kept awake by my parents and their guests
enjoying the new year... singing on top of spaghetti!!! LOL = )

skip mine. i just wanna
say that it was the best nite ever. i went to the party with anthony and
two of my other friends, who 
didn't seem to have the felt the vibe. maybe bcuz they didn't have any e
(not to say ,of course,
that u need e to feel it-but it sure does help =D) the feeling was so
intense!

oh man, i'm so tired, i can't hardly write...but i still can't wipe that
smile i got from the 
party off my face =). 

thanx to anthony,both noahs who were there (uncle noah , thanx for that
potato head massage -hee hee),
aaron,derek,heather (raspberrie),joe,matt,josh...and everyone else i met
(sorry if i forgot to mention).
oh, and did anyone leave behind a mossimo baseball cap? i found it on the
floor, and i'll bring it
to all the other events i goto until someone claims it.

sorry 'bout the cool world party guys, wish u coulda shared the vibe that
was at the cF party. next time will

...was spent at Mel's house - my best friend in the whole world.  We 
decided we couldn't afford to make a 1.5 hour trek in the windy stormy 
weather for a rave. From the reviews I've read, I'm glad I stayed home in 
Sac.  We watched videos we recorded from the 80's and I showed her my 
Duran Duran video "Arena" and we marveled at how much we have grown up 
over the years.  I thought it was a good way to spend NYE.

Anyway, I am in full agreement with Steve S. and Leslie.  As soon and Mel 
and I get settled in SF, we will both be more than willing to help in 
anyway we can to simply have the freedom to dance.

happy new year;)

anyone actually see that movie?  I haven't, but my understanding is that
it's about this little city where it's illegal to dance.  I think we
need a modern day documentation style film about our problems raving.

I've now heard that our parties got shut down because of a lack of
permits.  A cool cop told us very politely that, "Everyone knows ravers
aren't out to cause any problems.  What we all need to understand is
that it's our job to enforce fire code.  If you don't have your permits,
there's fire hazards to consider, and if something went wrong and people
got hurt, everyone would be looking at us (the police) and asking why it
happened."...or something really close to that.

To counter that, I also heard last night that some promoters have such a
hard time getting the permits that they take chances and pray to not get
busted.  

maybe throwing out the legitimate problems out into the open can help us
decide the best course of action to take..

All I have to say, was I had a great time on New Years 95-96 at Gateway,
but this New Years DEFINITELY took the cake for an all out KICK ASS
time.
Among the amazing music (Sabin ROCKED, the lady outside who's name I
don't know was AMAZING, I loved the Sesame Street Dance!), the people
there made the night what it was, in my eyes.  I met some WONDERFUL
people (Uncle Noah, Orson, Derek, Joe, and MANY others..) and I saw
SO MANY people that I love and missed!  And seeing Omar for the first
time in I don't know how long was just amazing, he can still, even in
freezing cold wind and rain, make you warm with his smile.  Thank you to
EVERYBODY who was there for making it as incredible of a night as it
was, and a great big hug and thank you to all the Cloud Factory people
for being so good to us and providing us with an explosive start to the
new year. =)

Love you all!
  --Noah

P.S. Thank you for the necklace, Melanie! =)

This message is aimed mostly toward Pao... but actually, this is to
anyone interested.

Deeje and I have a program that he wrote called Virtual Turntable!  It
simulates a turntable using Quicktime technology on a PowerPC MacOS
machine.  

It works, I can beatmatch with it.  Anyone want to take a look, and
maybe form a beta testing team?

email me and I'll send you a copy.

Well, looks like I picked a good time to get outta SoCal... I'll have to
watch the news and stuff to see how the media is depicting that whole 7th
Heaven situation... My heart goes out to all those who were hurt and
scared on such a wonderful night.

BUT I went northward with my buddy Joe (It is beginning to seem like I
don't leave the house without this boy!  But the ravers dig him, so he
keeps on comin' back!  But watch out ladies, I think someone has staked a
claim...)

So me and Joey are happily riding the Amtrak Coast Starlight train (a
really fun ride, BTW) when we get to Santa Barbara.  The cunductor and
porters tell us this is the 'smoking stop' and we should feel welcome to
'stretch your legs' and such.  They say we'll be there for about 10
minutes.  Sounded good.  So we strolled over next to the station and kind
of looked around.  Then we looked back to the train just in time to see it
pull away from the stop.  We ran like madmen to try to catch up, only to
have passengers and porters laugh at us throug the windows.  :(
So there we were with _nothing_ -- all of our stuff was onboard, including
our tickets home! (AND all our raver goodies!).  So I go inside to rap
with the Amtrak representative only to be told that, "Smoking stops are
five minute stops only and you are supposed to stay right next to the car
and if you didn't follow the rules, that's your own fault."  Luckily a
kind cap driver heard our sad plight and rushed us post haste to the SLO
train station and we got back on the train.  YES!

We go to our destination and shortly found our good friend Heather adn we
off for a wonderful evening!

I don't think there's anything I could write about CF that could
communicate how much fun it was or what a good job everyone did putting it
on!  The music was fun (I put on my white gloves and danced at the speaker
during the hardcore stuff -- see, I'm learning things in So Cal...), the
people were _great_, the visuals kept us all going al night (The Muppet
Show rocked!) and even with some rain and wind, everyone seemd to have a
fun time!

But alas, I seem to have lost one item!  I had a small black and brown
case for my camera... if you happened to find it, could you let me know?

Alrighty folks, as always it was wonderful partying with all of you!  I
hope to be having fun in the north sometime soon!

I have been thinking about organizing around the permit thing as well.  The
"scene" represents a lot of people, a lot of jobs and a lot of money.  I
know this is not what the scene is about to most of us, but #1 that is a
reality and #2 that is the only talk that politicians/bureaucrats
understand.

ANyway, with all the brains, creativity, and energy that this list alone
represents, I am sure we could go a long way.  So I'm in for meeting with
people and getting something organized, brainstorming, etc.  There, we
already have one of our "one or two lawyers".

Excited about 1997 already.  Think of the fundraisers we can have!

peace.....Rob

Sorry.  I just posted a message about a product called "Virtual
Turntable"  I was wrong about the title.  It's not Virtual Turntable.  I
just got a message already from someone thinking it's a port of the
Mixman product.  I did not realize they were using that actual name for
their product.  My oppologies to Mixman.  I meant no harm.

The ACTUAL name of our program is called QT Turntable.  Anyone who'd
like to see a copy is welcome to mail me and I'll send it over to you.

Okay, so I _just_ finished unpacking everything and putting everything in
its place and I realized that I did not return home with vibrating Mr
Potatohead!  :'(  Though it is not a difficult product to obtain, if you
happened to find mine sitting around, let me know.  
Then again, if you found it and you're reading this and thinking: 
"Hey, no way, Uncle Noah, this thing kicks bootie and I'm not giving it up
for nothin'!" then hey, what can I do... just have fun with it and maybe
send me an EMAIL saying thanks! :)

Great New Years Everyone!

Hello. Hope everyone had fun. This is a story about 4 ravers on a quest
to rave on the last day of 1996.

Paul - Thats me.
Victoria- My best Friend.
Jeremey- Cool Friend.
Amber- Another cool friend.

It must have been 6:30 at my home in San Jose. Victoria and Jeremey come
over to discuss what we are going to go to, because Erik(1,000 blow pop
man)'s car is making weird noises or something or other and now we can't
go to Cloud Factory. Sucks for us. Then Amber comes over.

Well, Jeremey has to get the car back to his grandparent's house back in
CONCORD, so we decide we will take BART from Concord to Frisco and then
go to whatever Rave in Frisco.
Okay so that's cool.  So we get to the BART station in Concord and
decide, that while we are waiting for the BART we will call some
voicemails and finf out where what is and when and how much. Okay, there
was a map point for Origin on Haight. Metamorphosis was in Oakland. COOL
WORLD was a no, no. So obviously we are gonna go to  Origin.

We get on BART and we are all putting on glitter and stickers on the BART
adn people are lookign at us like we were psycho, but who cares.

We get off BART on 16th and Market in Frisco. Its drizzling. I didnt
bring a jacket, I am so cold. It took us a good ass 10 minutes to get a
cab to stop. We get in and it takes us to Haight, it was only about $6.00
or so so we're cool, thinking Origin will be like $20 at the most.

Yeah right!!! It was $25. So now all of us are definetly sober tonight.
We then get the directions and find out that its in OAKLAND!!!!! We
barely have enough money to spend.

Luckily some terrrrrrific Ravers gave us a ride. Much PLUR to them, too
bad they are not on SFRaves list and are knew to our scene. From LA area.
First, they only have a spot for two people. So Amber and I decide to go
with them and Victoria and Jeremey will get a ride with some other
people.

Well, first of all we need to go to the house of one of the girls who
gave us a ride.
No problem we are cool. They change, we put on more glitter. Its all
good. Then we need to go pick up thier friend, Todd.  And he has given us
some wrong  ass directions to bumb fucked Egypt! ( Actually to his work)

We needed to make a right on Vanness and go down Oak and turn onto Marke
and stuff, I swear this guy, must work for some people's voicemail
because his directions where right of a voicemail. We ended up allmost
dying.

We were on some street, we roll down the window and ask the cab driver
where Vaness is and he points right. So when the light turned Green, we
went right.  We are in the middle of the block, when some bumb on a bike
(I LOVE THIS BUM!) yells, "Hey you're on a ONE WAY street!!!" We all look
at each other with a what did he say look, just then we see four lanes of
cars rushing at us. We spin aroudn and drive like crazy. 

Okay, fuck Todd and his bootsy ass directions! We are going to the rave.
So we get on the freeway and go to Berkely, because we need to stop at
some other guys house for a minute to get something or other. We get to
his house fine. We leave and go to the rave.

Parking was just wonderful!!

We park at exactly 11:30.We get to the "RED BUILDING" just as someone
yell's their shutting us down!!! 
So we like mad rush into Origin. We finally meet up wiht our friends and
are so happy.
While, we are all hugging, we hear. Happy New Year!!
That was the highlight of the night.

Well, after that, he music sucked. I didn't hear almost any good House at
all. It was tiny, too many small passages. And that visual of the naked
South American indiand dude with an erection, was sending out bad vibes.
All in all it was a piece of shit!!!
It was not worth $25 at all.
So it tursn out that the rave they were talking about that was shut down
was either Metamorphosis or something else.

Turns out they shut us down at 1:45 or so. I was there for almost 2
hours. I didn'r really mind that much since it was a piece of shit!!!

Well we gather our friends together and decide to go back to Todd's house
in Berkely. Victoria and Jeremey go with Todd and we go with our knew
foudn raver friends, who are Eing their asses off. Amber is Frying and I
am so scared.
This was the stragnes ride in a car.

We get to Todd's and we're fine and we kick it their till 10:30 or so in
the morning and leave for BART. We take the BART back to Jeremey's house
in Concord.
We sleep until 8:30, then we take the car all the way back to San Jose
and that's what happened. 

Great New Year's ? I don't know about that, but it sure was interesting.

PLUR,
Paul

P.S. Welcome to 1997 everyone!
P.P.S I heard Cool World was busted up at  2:30 too. This was a shitty
New Year's for any raver no at Cloud Factory!

Hey glad to hear you kids had a good time, I hadn't kept in touch, and I'm
glad to hear you got to at least got out to one for the night!

My group of eight took the BART from SF to Oakland for Planet...  I had a
really cool night!  The party itself was mostly ok until it was busted,
but Cool World truly does suck every bit as much as everyone said.  But, I
am _glad_ I went.  I had a kick ass time!  But there is so much that is
sh*tty about cool world that I won't even get started.  (maybe a future
post, or if you want details ask me :) Let me just say though, that it's
the PEOPLE who make the party, and there was so much good vibe that I
could hardly believe it, because I almost didn't expect it... even as riot
police were ushering people down the steps in the front of the convention
center, hordes of us were smiling under trees, listening to cool tunes on
portables, dancing in the rain... and there were plenty of smiles to go
around even at 4 to 5 to 6 to 7 ..all the way until 8am waiting around
oakland for the BART to open again...  I'm really glad I went, and met the
beautiful people I wouldn't have met had I not come.  Whereever you go,
there you are, and there is always going to be something to experience
whereever that is. 

I heard about busts from NYC to LA to Seattle and Vancouver....  SF was no
exception to this modern rule...  As long as you enjoyed yourself and came
away with something positive, don't regret your life experiences!

Now, positivity aside, promoters need to be more responsible!!

Wow time to try to catch up on all this lost sleep...
peace all, and welcome to 97!

=)
Max

yes, there was a nasty riot at 7th heaven.  somebody passed around free
vials of a drug called "fx" and a lot of people overdosed.  as i understand
it, about 40 people were hospitalized and then, of course, the police came
with their riot gear.  

lots of people got nightstick sandwiches and rubber bullets, police car
windows got smashed, the party was broken up and everybody was sent into the
night wishing for a better start to the new year.

thankfully, it looks like socal-raves is avoiding the finger pointing, but
it looks like a VERY BIG setback to the california rave community, our own
included.

(you better believe sfpd has heard about it already)

I'd love to be as optimistic as you, Leslie, but I have a different
view on the possibility of resolving all conflicts between ravers and
authorities.  Surely spitting in their face is not the type of thing
to do, they'll just come after us with more vengeance.  And I hate
to be prejudiced.. but cops are cops.  They chose to live their lives
as a police officer most likely because they found a passion in
policing things.  I dare not generalize and say all cops are pigs;
there must be some with a (twisted?) sense of virtue that made them
want to go into the proffession with "altruistic" motives.  But
being a police officer entails much more than "to serve and protect"
the people.. I think it's more of "to serve and protect" bureaucracy,
often against the will of the people.  It would seem to me that to
be a cop you had to either be blind to this, or in support of it.

I came very close to also having a disastrous New Year's.. I had
wanted to volunteer work for someone at the Goa party, but we (or I)
never found a ride.  I took a bus down to Monterey with hopes of going
to the Cloud Factory party, but it was sold out.  So I went to
First Night in Santa Cruz in hopes of enjoying some music and meeting
some drummers.. and I did.  There was Arican drumming and dancing on the
sidewalk, and there were happy listeners gathered around on the street,
and it was better music than that of any of the "organized" events.
Then comes along Mr. Police Officer, steps right up to us and makes
a throat-slitting sign at one of the drummers.  Not giving the music
five seconds to die down, the puts his hands on one of the drums
and says with a cold, stern face, "You stop now or you're all going
to jail."  I guess he had expected us to mumble under our breaths
and whimper off, for he was taken completely by surprise when the
drummer shouted out to the crowd protesting the injustice and asking
for their support.  Mr. Police Officer tried getting in the drummer's
face, then thought better after a few people took flash pictures of
them.  Then he said something between his teeth about us violating
a city ordinance, another jail threat, and walked off.

There is some city law about No Drumming Downtown Past 5 PM, because
the people anal enough to dislike the music are the same ones that
get those laws passed.  So I support the cause of legal organization
in an effort to make a change.  But the law is almost ultimately in
Mr. Police Officer's hands.  Maybe that ordinance has some reason to
it if drumming on Pacific Av. every night keeps some people from
having a good night's sleep (laugh), but for crying out loud.. it
was New Year's Eve, there was music up and down the street, all of
downtown was up and partying, and there must have been over 100 people
enjoying that drumming.  Some might say the cop could have wanted
to stop the drumming because the city wasn't making any money off
of it.. my personal opinion is that the guy has something against
hippies, African drumming & dancing, and/or anything that "rubs him
the wrong way."  Also, he's the type of person that loves to play tough
guy... and so many of us know that's how the vast majority of cops
are.  I asked him who was really "disturbing the peace," and he
was deaf to me.  Then, as if it was karma at work, it rained.

Thankfully, the spirit of Peace, Love, Unity, and Respect prevailed.
After five minutes we began drumming again under the shelter of the
Rhythm Fusion store.  When more and more people came and danced under the 
rain, the cops did not dare to even throw us a dirty look.  With
much life, music, and celebration, I smiled as the new year came
to be.


Much love to you all,

Leonardo

there's a report on the event at:

notice how cnn reported it as a "rock concert" for the band "seventh heaven"

of course, we all know that the media covers our events with very accurate,
objective, and fair reporting...

NOT!

It must have been AP or UPI that reported it as such, because the
news coverage tonight said the same thing.

This along with the Boston rioting.

Directly quoted from the news wire:

"Top Story Wed - 2 young people still remain in critical condition after
attending a New Year's Eve party in Los Angeles where hundreds of vials of
a possible drug were given out.  An estimated 10,000 people attended the
"In Seventh Heaven" party; the revelers became unruly after the party was
cancelled, & after police were called in, a melee ensued. {END OF REPORT}
20:20 01/01/97"

I wasn't there I don't know anything about it, but since people were asking
this is what I saw.

hi all:

more info from the socal-raves list...

pauly

-- begin forwarded message --

We have been told by a close friend and supporter of Dr. Freecloud's Mixing
Lab that one of their crew was stricken last night by ingesting the contents
of three of the "fX" vials, and was taken to the hospital after feeling
seriously ill and had their stomach pumped for five hours last night.  We
only hope that this person is well today and now back home safe and sound.

We were also told that the contents of his stomach were tested and traces of
LSD (?), GHB, Cocaine, and Heroin were found.  The person who was stricken
swears that they have never ingested any of the above illegal substances,
and knowing his nature, I believe them.  It may hint to an explaination as
to why people were getting so sick and passing out and stuff. Kava Kava has
always seemed fairly harmless when I have used the ground root in a cup of
strong tea several times in the past when I was suffering from insomnia and
I didn't feel the slightest nausea.  I have heard of only one case where
someone got a little queezy.  In fact, the color of my tea was a darker
brown than what was in the vial.  What really was in those vials seems like
the biggest mystery now.

One thing that I did note this year was that there were more outside
vendors, whereas a last year's Circa 1996 I only recall Ken's booth being
the only outside vendor and being told that all of the other booths were run
by CPU 101. That was different.

As for who's responsible, everyone is and no one is.  It was just frickin
chaos out there and it seemed like so many factors brought the evening down.
You try to cover all the bases but sometimes shit happens.  It's over.  As
long as everyone is okay is the most important thing and that no one died.
Let their lawyers deal with the legal shit now.  Whether you personally will
continue to support the promoters, or not, is up to you.

Hi all!  ]=)


 Whoosh! I'm still a bit beat but here goes...

 First my personal situation leading up to the party;

 I had been working on a fluro-banner for this party. This meant 6, 12 
to 14 hour days in a row before the party with the last three days 
seeing only about 8 hours of sleep. The banner did not get completly  
finished but looked good anyway.
 Then my ride flaked on me the morning of the 31st so I had to try to get 
a ride for me and my equipment. CJay was kind enough to come from Palo 
Alto to pick up me and my equipment.
 Get to the warehouse about 7 pm and discover that there is about three 
circuits of AC for two sound systems, a lot of black lights and my 
slide/light show. Needless to say my slides/lights didn't play but as I 
was tired I really didn't care.
 I had also brought a fellow student (Bob) to the party. He was crewing 
for me and researching for his senior thesis (part 2) on the evolution of 
public gatherings. His part two had to do with raves.
 My apologies to eveyone who had to deal with my grumpiness and loud 
voice. The grumpiness was due too exhaution and my voice has always been 
loud. People are always welcome to tell me I'm too loud since I usually 
don't think I am.


 The Party;

 Well it was fun!! We had a beautiful meditation with toning chants that 
segued into drumming and dige playing into the first DJ. Anon was up at 
midnight and we ushered in the new year with a female DJ at the helm. 
YEA!! Anon was suberb and maintained her cool throught the power problems 
that shut down the audio several times. Props to the sound crew for 
getting the system up and running quickly. Due to my exhaution I didn't 
dance a whole lot. Also there was woefully inadequte ventilation and 
things were hot and sopping wet in no time. I didn't dance for 4 hours 
and my shirt was still wringing wet. The chill room downstairs was 
playing some great stuff but it was a little bit small and clausterphobic 
for me. Kode IV was awesome!! And the very last DJ was playing the most 
enjoyable stuff!!

Great stuff;

 Without a doubt the people there were it for me! Such a good bunch of 
people. The music (psi-trance) was super-duper!!!! Seeing my first 
fluro-banner hung and being enjoyed was wonderful. There was a bountiful 
supply of great fluro art there. The free bottled water didn't hurt 
either. :)

Less than great;

 Most importantly the lack of planning for power. At one point the 
circuit breaker for one set of outlets was not only shutting off but had 
jumped off the power rails. Scary!!! The lack of ventiation really 
sucked! Due to the power problems not all the fans could be used.

 Overall a wonderful time. I'm sorry that the folks from the Origin and 
Chrysalis parties could not all get in. We were solidly packed!

 Hi to Liza (smooch), Ericka (thanks for the help), Kristen (double 
smooch), KC and Nancy (phat fems!), Russ the amazing doorman, Tom, Loran, 
Ben, Dhiren (sp?), everyone at CCC and Hunab Ku and to everyone else whom 
I may be forgetting.

 Double big thanks and hugs to Cjay for getting me and my equipment there 
and to Brandon and Anne who helped get me, Bob and the equipment back too 
sant Cruz.

 This party was truley underground as we had no flyering/word of mouth 
only. And it really showed in the quality people who came. Thanks 
everyone and happy '97.


smiles,


Ran D.Dreams

Hi all!

 I had heard there was a party in Santa Cruz called Trance-Formation 
(sp?). I was wondering if anyone would like to report on it.

Thanks!!

hi,
I know I'll get flamed for this post, but, IMHO some peoples "signature
files", e.g. attachments on their posts, are extremely long, and it can
be a drag to dig thru all of the posts on here, as it is, then you hit
someones posts with 2 or 3 screenfulls of ascii graphics and so forth. :]

Here we are, another year together.  I usually make some type of prediction
about the upcoming year, but won't this year.  Too busy making sure MY i's
are dotted and t's are crossed.  I will say this much, since I have some
control over these aspects of my life.

- Flava, will happen in '97, and that will be the capacity that I'll
continue to participate in dance culture.  I will try to make it a browner
dance culture, if possible, with inclusion in mind.

- Crackerjackin' is over for me.  No white powder substances, nor liquid
pleasures.  My motto for '97 if it grows in the ground, then I'm down.  And
even then, if it's mind expansion then I need to be in the expanse of the
great outdoors.  A boom box, my woman, and a tape (my own), will be all
that is needed for a real rave...in the woods.

I'm happy that I stayed with friends.  For the first time in years, I
attended no party (i.e. "partay") to bring in the New Year.  I brought it
in with new friends, a new attitude, and a new woman in my life.  This has
been the BEST New Years I've had in ages.  And I brought in in right this
time.  Was slightly buzzed from the booze and smoke, and didn't need no
hokey-doke.  Very little house music, lotsa conversation and smiles.  Now
that's how we do it in '97!

I will also try to make it to other types of events, hip/hop & jungle/drums
& bass is it.  Since I buy house music, and am very, very, picky about who
I will allow to assualt my ears, it's time to listen to some other stuff
that ain't so 4/4.  time to listen to something else for a real change.

Sorry to hear about all the busted parties, but what else do you expect?
This city and the surrounding areas hate raves.  The cops aren't being paid
off like they used to, along with the club owners playing an ACTIVE ROLE in
GETTING EVERY NON-CLUB  (i.e. SoMA Niteclub) BUSTED, and the general
political apathy of a disjointed rave community, I have grave doubts about
this year being any better than the previous.  As a matter of fact, I
expect things to get alot hotter since 215 passed, permits or no.  Oh yeah,
Presshard is BACK! "You know how difficult it is to prosecute a cop?" <-
Dirty Harry, Magnum Force.  Good luck, since this guy has never given a
rat's ass about permits.

SF Politics 101 bka my .02 worth:
So, now you wanna get politically active, in the city that is now OWNED by
one Willie Brown?  I gotta laugh.  Ok, first, you have GOT to get every
promoter behind your efforts, since these are the people who would actually
apply for permits anyway.  You will also need to rally the legit club
owners in SoMA to sign on, or else they will act against you (they are way
more powerful than you could know people, since they have CASH!). Next you
will have to be a presence at as many parties as possible, getting
registered voters of SF to sign some type of petition.  This may have to be
done more than once.  You will have to know the current permit process, and
have a proposal ready that EVERYONE has bought into.  The hardest part has
yet to come.  You will have to get Willie's ear, and there better be
something in it for him.  It would be good if you talked to one of his
relatives (I know a couple of them), or better yet a paid lobbyist/attroney
who is in tight with Willie.

Can it be done?  Sure.  Does the dance community have what it takes to get
this done?  I think there is potential in everything, although to date, the
dance community has been rather limp-dicked bouthewhoe thig. It

 Can anyone give me any hints as to rave info phone numbers for any
of the Hawaiian islands, or other rave info for Hawaii? I will try
the Funk Pistol store in Honolulu, if it's still in business; and
will look into some of the record stores too.

 I'd be interested in any nightclub information too.

 Thanks!

i wholeheartedly agree with you Leslie, but in the instance of this past NYE,
I think there's more at work here.  As we now know, even permitted parties in
established venues like Spundae were even busted.  Why? In addition to that,
it's my understanding that the Pacific/gateway crew inquired about permits
for their party, but they were told by the City that there was not enough
staffing to administer one.  The catch 22 therein is obvious. Not enough
staff to issue a permit, from which the City makes money off of, but enough
staff(i.e. police) to bust THREE parties in one night, consequently costing
the City of Oakland a substantial amount of money in salaries, and overtime
hours, etc.

I think the Cloud Factory had the right idea, maybe it's a good idea to just
stay away from SF & Oakland for a while...

The recap of my experience first:

Last night, I was going to stay home, but decided to go to the
Gateway/Pacific party with some of my closest friends.  We arrived at the
location around 11:30 to find a several cop cars and a long, unmoving line
up the alley.  The music was coming out of the warehouse on the left-- the
Origin party-- and the warehouse on the right -- the Gateway/Pacific party
(cool-looking 2-floor brick warehouses).

There are cops in the street and one (the nice young Asian one in case you
were out there) tells the crowd that the party is being shut down.  We
wait, not wanting to believe, but it's true.  At about 10 'til 12, they
begin asking people to leave.

As I walked the crowd, looking for missing friends, I had the great
pleasure of handing out the New Year's fortunes that I had made.  The Asian
cop took one and thanked me, said it was perfect for him (it said "in 1997,
pay attention to spending more time alone"!) and he'd put it on his
refrigerator.

He told me he appreciated my presence there (I guess because I wasn't just
yelling at him and was trying to remind people that we need to behave with
respect even when our party's being busted, because it will reflect on us
in the long run) .... and I told him that that street was FILLED with
wonderful positive people who only wanted to go in and dance with their
friends, there was little bad about it, except now, they were being put on
the highways at midnight on New Years, and I hope all of them made it
safely where they were going.

And so the new year came as I milled around such a wonderful and
interesting crowd, it was pretty intense, the combination of the positive
potential and the disappointing reality.

The cops also assured me they were shutting down the Origin party next.  I
assume the whole process took a long time because they then aggressively
cleared the street, and Steve said the inside party didn't shut down until
1 am, an hour later.  I wish I could have been inside with everyone.

(And hearing about the Cool World event, I suspect that  "bust" was just
one in this whole series of crackdowns on raving.)

Now my concerns about responsibility:

The nice cop told me that the problem was lack of permits, which would have
required certain security provisions.  We hear this over and over, and we
also hear horror stories of trying to get the proper permits.

I see both sides, and I value the underground scene, but it seems to me
that there's no way a large party, especially next to another large party,
on New Year's Eve, can possibly expect not to be "noticed" by the
authorities.  This would seem to me to clearly show that ALL permit
processes must be observed so that the party is LEGAL.  Not taking care of
business is ignoring responsibility.

That responsibility is to the rave community, and to the people who paid
$20 for a ticket, and who committed this special evening to share with
their friends in that place.

Promoters are providing an environment for a positive experience, and part
of that environment is a sense of security, that, as much as humanly
possible, that party is not going to be busted.  Yes, sometimes of course
we choose to take chances, but in my opinion, New  Years Eve in that
location is not one of those times.

I believe that it was the responsibility of those throwing the party to
either follow the rules or to accept that it just wasn't possible to do a
New Year's event this year (which is sad, but to me, not sadder than how I
and many others ended up spending their New Years).

Galen apologized on his voicemail, saying "it was unavoidable."  I'm not
trying in any way to single out anyone (especially since both Gateway and
Pacific give SO MUCH to our community) but I am saying maybe it's time that
we wake up and find a new way to play the game, because it's clear our
current "close-your-eyes and hope-they-don't-see-you" way isn't working.

I'm tired of being so consistently busted, and I think we need to
strategize how we can keep this from happening.  "Unavoidable" doesn't cut
it with me .. we need to learn how to avoid busts, even if it means fewer
parties.  Busts are bad for everyone, and do NOT forward our cause in any
way.

Maybe this means we work with the authorities in a new way, maybe it means
we only can have small small parties, maybe it means .... something else.
I don't know, but I'm happy to be a part of the solution in any way that I
can.  If anyone has suggestions of who we should be working with and
talking to, who we can write to, or has things that I may be overlooking
about this and other recent bust scenarios, I'd like to hear.

Maybe a "committee" of representatives of the rave community can present
our case to the authorities to try to work out a solution with them,
because, like it or not, we need to understand them and they; need to
understand us.

Working with authorities doesn't mean not being underground - - underground
is about how parties are publicized, it doesn't have to mean illegal.

Bottom line, we have no rave scene if we are constantly busted, and the
more busts there are, the more busts there will be.  I want to party,
please!

Love and hopes that 1997 brings safe and joyous dancing to us all,
Leslie

(p.s.  to those who kept asking about "getting their money back" I'd like
to again remind you that Pacific brings your FREE Sunsets almost weekly for
8 months a year)

Got a call from my partner Brad from C-Lab around 1 pm the day of the party.
Turns out they want C-Lab to do some live stuff.  My other partner Eric who
usually plays live with me can't make it so the plan is to mix live to
record to live to record between Brad and I.  Sounds fun to me.  Pack up the
gear and head down.  We get there before it starts and watch it all come
together.  Three rooms, all totally beautiful.  The Gateway room was just
incredible with full intellibeams.  Their soundsystem is just the best IMO.
The Pacific room reminded me of Sunset parties with scenery projected on the
back walls, and a dolphin hanging over head.  The ambient room was totally
beautiful with carpet, couches and two beautiful altars.  There was a huge
crystal handing from the ceiling in the center and they were shining a laser
through it producing a really cool effect.  I get all my gear set up and
sound check with a new drum and bass thingy I'm working on.  Turns out to be
the only sound I make all night.  Oh well, it was fun to hear it on a big
system.  11:45, I'm dancing in the Gateway room and Sutekh is getting ready
to go on.  He's one of C-Lab, and we are stoked that he is getting some main
room action.  He goes on and just then I find out that the party will be
ending at 1:00.  Bummer.  Then I think you better have some fun now, cuz
it's gonna be over in an hour.  So I dance my ass off.  Seth does great.
Had a couple of moments while dancing catching small glimpses of the never
ending nowness of it all.  I head down to the ambient space just before one
and just after getting there someone from Pacific walks in and shuts off the
sound announcing there will be a free make-up party in the near future.  As
if they havn't all ready thrown enough free parties for SF'ers, but it was a
good gesture.  The place clears of everyone except for crew and people
riding with them.  About 100 or so I'd imagine.  I put my stuff away and
soon the music in the ambient space comes back on.  From what I understand,
the promotors talked with the cops for well over an hour, and finally
convinced them to let us continue the party for those left at the event.  So
everyone is in the ambient space dancing to triphop by Brad and (sorry I
forgot your name).  Then Solar comes on starting with an old Craftwerk song
that gets everyone on thier feet, then house and what not.  Then the someone
from Pacific convinces Freaky Chakra and Single Cell to go ahead and play
for those left at the part.  By this point, both had....well....indulged.
Daum is totally into playing, but Miguel(sp) kept saying "I don't know if I
can, I don't know man."  We encouraged him and told him we'd all move the
equipment so he didn't need to worry about it.  We get everything moved and
reconnected and Solar plays for another hour or so.  Then Daum and Miguel.
They rocked.  First some techno, then some electro that was really cool,
then ended with some drum and bass which made the night for me.  Some time
during thier set, NUB Chai comes in with free hot chai for everyone.  That
stuff is so good.  Took me back to Burning Man.  A little earlier while
Solar was playing, I went up to the Gateway system and Minor was spinning
some easy listening techno.  It was great.  There were about 20-30 people up
there, and they had the system turned way down.  It was really cool to hear
techno on a huge system with the volume turned way down.  Quite relaxing
actually.  I wish they had some couches up there.  Later when I went back up
to check things out, John Carol was spinning and the system was at full
volume again.  Maybe I'm getting old, but I just can't take loud music for
that many hours straight anymore.  I was wishing for the low volume again.
Soon I carried the gear out to the car and in the 30 seconds it took I got
completely soaked.  It was pouring and the streets were rivers.  My
berkinstocks got..well...wet.  The gear was fine though due to cases for
everything.  

All in all I had a great time.  I'm sorry for all of those made to leave,
and all those who never even got in.  I hope you all made the best of it.
One of the highlights for me was a converstation with Andrew (AstralMatrix)
when he enlightened me as to the only real lasting archival medium for
music.  Rekids :)  When you think about it, all other mediums break down
well before 50 years.  But the "lacker" (I think that's what it's called)
that makes the plates which stamp the records is made from metal, and will
last several thousand years.  Cool.  

Happy new year.

Rick

Ok, so how was your New Years?!?!?!

No long review here,  Just snippets of the event higlights.

Gateway: - I must say that when 12:00 rang in that "it's time" jam made
me GO OFF!!!!  

              -Enjoyed seeing the SFR bunchies dance and dance till the
Oak PO ushered us away.

              -That crazy jungle making me move like never before.

              -Seeing Steve S.'s shirt with the quote "Are you
Connected?  Yes we are." (Or someting like that)...

Other events:  -Thomas T.  Running around in his skivies trying to get
the sound running.  
                     -Maxin' with a bunch of newfound "pals" in the very
dark chill room.

                     -Socalizing with this one girl from Estonia about
life, energies and the Vibe...

                     -Running around w/Wonka, tryin' to set up a fan to
help happy scensters stay cool.

Wish:           -Dancing on the floor while everyone is "spun" and
chilling out.

                   -Trying to tell one guy that it's the VIBE that's
keeping me up while he's insistent that I was on something.

Afta:          - Getting home @ 11PM thinkin that I WILL MAKE IT to work
today...


So what's up for Friday?

Keep me apprised of when you plan to meet.  I hope I can attend.   I 
 think a "venting/assessment" mtg is the best way to start to keep 
 track of ongoing problematic themes and put one-time-only cases to 
 rest.  I think we need to approach this diplomatically and rationally 
 because politicians can make promises, laws can be passed, people can 
 understand  concepts...but law enforcers won't necessarily apply these 
 liberties if they feel it's an "unsafe" situation.

I, too, was disturbed to hear how many parties had been busted 
 throughout Alameda and SF counties and would like to keep track of the 
 reasons so we have some basis to work with.  So aside from Gateway and 
 1015 being busted, what else was shut down earlier than planned?  
 Also, what was the reason?  If memory serves me right (don't comment 
 ;) someone told me that Vanilla Fudge got busted too.  And didn't Cool 
 World get closed down early?

 I don't think it's just a rave issue our even a youth issue but an 
 overall understanding of responsible rituals and rites in modern day 
 society.  There's an attorney for human rights in HMB that might be 
 interested in helping us out and Tony ?? in SF/Marin who's renown for 
 taking some underdog cases.  Tony might have a representative that 
 could attend and provide some info on the innerworkings of our local 
 government but I don't think we should include them until we've got a 
 platform/defined agenda.  Also, is there any such thing as a youth 
 council that advises local governments in SF and Alameda counties to 
 have a representative attend to give us their slant or at least 
 educate them to the issues at hand.

And lastly, IMHO, this discussion/meeting should also include promoters 
 who aren't necessarily in aligmment with "rave culture" but put on 
 parties that can be construed as a representative of part of our scene 
 because this contributes to the identity that the general public views 
 as a liability (raves=irresponsible drug use).

But irregardless of the constrictive laws that suppressed us, we still 
 know how to get off...Did you catch some of that spirited groove at 
 Stompy?  Props to Preston & crew!

Can it be done?  Sure.  Does the dance community have what it takes to get
this done?  I think there is potential in everything, although to date, the
dance community has been rather limp-dicked about the whole thing.  It
would be like trying to get 10 people from the Stompy Party yesterday to
commit to political action (uh-huh...)...I think it can start as an SFRave
initiative, but must embrace dance culture in it's entirety if it's gonna
work.  My best wishes to those brave enough to press forward.

(I prefer back room dealing method myself, and it works just fine).

Peace & Happy New Year.  May it be a prosperous and rewarding year for all!,

     this is kind of an interesting discussion line.  you'd think we want a 
     whole bunch of parties going on that can maybe disperse the scene a 
     little bit and make them smaller, so there's not so many problems...
     
     
     guess someone's going to have to build their own club somewhere away 
     from all the city lights.

 Well, I'm a day late to complement this one!!  I've been sick, & resting.
All I have to say        is SNOOOCHIE BOOOCHIE NOOCHIIIEEEEES!!!!.   Just
kidding, I had a gggrrrreeaaaaat evening.
I was smiling from ear to ear the whole time,(wasn't even on e, never need
to be) even though I was sick as a dog, and had lost my voice. I felt the
most absolute positive vibe there.  Nothing felt better than dancing in the
rain after being drenched in sweat from dancing inside.  It was funny
watching the others cram under the tent outside cuz they didn't wanna get
soaked.  I met people there that had never been to a rave before,(they were
in awe) and so was I, for it the was first time in a long time, I heard any
of the harder edged stuff.=).  I remember Ernie in his primary spinning
days, and man, has he progressed!!!!!.  Hats off to you honey, you rocked
my world.  You all did.  Thank you, I needed that. Thank you Scott for
everything, It was so nice to meet you, finally. It's so refreshing to
finally meet some compassionate people.  It was definately family oriented,
I met some wonderful people.  All the hugs, all the people, all the
music----You filled my cup with utter elation. Thanks everyone.(CF)  This
party was beyond all my expectations.  My girlfriend was happy cuz she saw
all these people wearing clothes from her mom's store in Mty, Devaz.  I'll
be looking forward to the next event. Good Vibes all over, and then some.
Next time I'll try not to be sick, that was the ONLY thing that sucked.
I've been to alot of parties, and not may leave such an afterglow of energy
like this one. Sorry for the long post, I'm still excited thinking about
it.
Peace and Huggs,  Elina                                .

Hey check out the new MSNBC special on trip-hop!!!! 
http://www.msnbc.com.  Yet another blinding flash of the obvious, but...

notice the article title?

"trip hop: music for the milleneum"

sounds like our own byline "music for the evolution"
i should sue.

i am sorry to hear that so many of you had to deal with parties breaking up
on new years.

my friends and i went to the minna street gallery to hear soulstice ring in
the new year!!!
the crowd was a perfect size for the space, there was enough room to groove
and not bump anyone!  the vibe was great.  everyone was in such a great mood
and just into having a great time ringing in the new year.

soulstice went on just 10 minues before the new year showed up, and
immediatly got a great show going.  there was the countdown, streamer poper
things all around, the confetti flying, everyone yelling, hugging and
kissing!!!!  
when the band took a break to switch to a dj, jamalski jumped up to the
microphone and did a jam with the band.  it was superb, he was rapping about
1997 with soulstice and jamalski.
we were dancing with strangers and old friends, everyone was there together. 
(not to mention some great art and visuals on the walls)

when soulstice finished for the night and dj's felix the dog and laron took
over.  everyone was just grooving!
i hope you all saw mark camp's post listing soulstice's show dates and you
get a chance to check out one of their shows.  they were worth the $10.00 i
paid.

funniest part: walking to the car with whipping winds, felt like i could fly!

i hope this is a good sign for more great parties to come in the new year. 

peace
shannon

To the brothers and sisters that know how to tap into the inner grooves 
 of the rhythmic heart.
Wrote this last night so the sentiments still linger some...hope you 
 can groove off it, too.
---

I'm still resonating with the infectious vibe
that our governments' finest tried to quell
around the many Bay Area gatherings
this NYE.

This vibrating spirit of joyous energies
sing high and low frequencies
  awakening our etheric fields
    pulsing a common rhythm
      of inner drives...
   all in the house of Jack                <--this is for Geoff
and JSL was nowhere to testify.   <--and this is for the Man! ;)

It was a glorious reflective gray day
  filled with curious wonderment and awe
of what we can still put together
  if we desire to share
    --openly and unconditionally--
  with all of it's nuances (good and bad)
embracing it fully as a common rhythm of life.

Simple enough as each breath we take
inhaling deep,
  expanding our bouyant cells of light/energy
and exhaling sharply from the lower diaphram
  releasing any impurities from our hearts.
---
I think I hit a moment of bliss  at this point and drifted into slumberland
'cause that's all I wrote. The running theme among many old timers 
 yesterday was:
"Make it happen!"  So what's keeping you?...

Love and much light,
Diane

this was my 5th consecutive new years in sf and the first time i was definitly
not in the mood for any kind of rave-like experience, i think it had something
to do with nye falling on a tuesday this year. instead, cami and I chilled at
home with some thai take out and a little wine, it was refreshingly mellow. and it 
was fun watching the silly people down at the ferry building gettin loose (ha ha) 
to the sounds of chris isaak and los lobos on the toob, i'm sure it was well worth 
the $85.  "amatuer night" indeed.

we made it over to stompy the next afternoon for awhile, it was a happy older-skool
crowd and the music was decent (if a little uninspired at times). one of the dj's
(johnny? from la?) played a 4-5 track herbert medly that was awesome.  overall, a nice 
way to ring in the new year on a rainy sf afternoon...

this recent wave of nye busts (nationwide) is unfortunate, '97 is going to be
"interesting" to say the least. my prediction is that i'll be going out less
frequently in general, but i'm going to try and check out more weeklies...

happy new year everybody,

andy

Hey,

 I just caught word on the radio (Via Emergency Broadcast) that a few
pennesular (San Mateo, Santa Clara and Alameda) Counties are in Flood
Crisis stages.  Plus, the National Weather people posted another storm
front is expected to hit the bay by 5:30 - 6PM tonight...

So kiddies, Please, PLEASE be safe when driving home from the 9 - 5's
tonight.  I'd hate for any of us to get negatively affected by Momma
Nature's excessive show of force.

Can someone tell me which event was in some huge industrial building in 
Oakland?  There was the first room, the big room and the chill space 
upstairs.  The first room had awesome very trippy visuals projected onto 
a wall, there was this swing in there too!  the DJ in that room 
shredded!  It was peaking when it got shut down...
It was fun while it lasted.

>> Sorry to hear about all the busted parties, but what else do you expect?
>> This city and the surrounding areas hate raves.

	Maybe it's true that "the authorities" hate raves in particular, 
but I don't see that it's necessary to believe that to explain what 
happened NYE.


	There's wisdom that comes under the general category of
"don't follow the herd" which can be stated thusly: "those nites when
everybody else wants to go out & party are very good nites to stay home" 
& "those nites when everybody else throws massive parties are really
excellent nites to stay small & underground". 


	If you're going to throw a permitted massive on New Years eve, 
*expect* to have to jump through at least three extra hoops that wouldn't 
be there on a random Saturday nite. Apply months in advance. And maybe 
you still won't be able to get a permit at all. After all, you're competing 
with Willie Brown's Embarcadero bash & a thousand other huge parties thrown 
by people with serious political muscle. No city can handle more than a 
certain number of events on any given nite.


	As far as the police presence goes, pretty much every beat cop on 
every force in every city is on duty NYE. It's just routine. It has as much 
to do with the fact that your parents are going to be drinking cocktails & 
driving as it has with the fact that you want to go out & dance & maybe do 
some E. And yes, some of those cops are going to be in a *bad* mood. 
Some of them would rather be out partying themselves. Some of them have 
girlfriends or boyfriends that just don't understand why they can't get
off work to take them out on NYE. They're only people, after all. And some
of them aren't above taking out their bad mood on whoever's vulnerable. 
They're only people. 


	My friend Vince is a 39-year-old retired Oakland cop. He served 20
years on the force. Do the math - that'll tell you how old a lot of these 
cops are. Many of them are kids who played football in high school & went
thru a year or two of training & then went straight out onto the streets
(or maybe got some ink & piercings & got "enrolled" in SFSU or SCU or UCB 
and waited to be brought into some drug scene or other, but that's another 
story altogether.)

...and party on Clementina!

All dressed up, lookin' more like disco queens than ravechicks, K, Ivana, 
me and (non-disco queen) Josh rushed to Oakland in a haze of glitter, 
feather boas, and excitement, so ready for our first party in 
oh-so-long.  We arrived at 11:30, but the police were faster.  I took one 
look at the police cars, the long unmoving lines, and the two parties 
sandwiched together, and I knew that this was _not_ happening.  After a 
wrong turn into Origin, and about 10 clueless minutes outside Gateway, I 
announced that Plan B was in effect.  We were racing over to SF before  
the mappoint for CCC closed at 1!

So many details had to fall into place with split-second accuracy - 
locating an errant car, finding friends at a drunken party, getting home 
and then over to the city - all in the space of 60 short minutes.  
Midnight found us during a desperate trek by desolate Oakland Army Base, 
searching for a fast way to the freeway.  Wild 107 yelling, "'97, what's 
up, y'all!" and the four of us answering with a weak and despairing, "yay."
But somehow, someway, all these impossible tasks worked out perfectly.  
We hit the mappoint at one on the dot - zero hour.  Our friends found the 
party an hour later and we managed to get them in.  And finally, at two, 
our New Year's celebration at a killer party had begun!!

And what a party!  The music was amazing, ruthless goa trance.  The 
people were wonderful.  And the vibe was thick on the dancefloor.  Oh, 
there were limitations - the space was unbelievably hot and muggy, and 
crowded (no doubt swelled by all the busted parties).  The sound cut on 
and off.  And you couldn't sit without becoming covered with a wet black 
ooze.  But we were ecstatic at our luck to be at a real party with the 
greatest music and all our brothers and sisters.  We danced and celebrated 
and suddenly it was eight in the morning.  You know - "where did the 
night go??"

Thanks to that crew for providing a lovely NYE party for just $10.  Our 
Nightmare on Linden Street turned into a wonderful night - and we 
properly celebrated _our_ "Happy New Year" with the first rays of light 
of the new year.  :)

Count me in as attorney number two, although my professional experience
doesn't exactly give me any great knowledge of permits, zoning, and the
constitutional right to dance (in unsafe warehouses, all night long, for an
admission fee).  I think the key to any meeting of this sort is to have
some of the organizers share their war stories so we can get a better grip
on what needs to be done to stop having parties busted.

Having said that, this isn't really a legal issue, but a political one
which differs from city to city.  Cops in SF have shut down parties, but we
seem more likely to get away with an underground in the City than in the
East Bay or South Bay.  In Oakland, they seem to find out about the
parties, and after Fnf in July, they busted the Fnf in October and the NYE
events which weren't permitted.  Monty's point about the hypocrisy of
Oakland is even more telling when you know at midnight there was gunfire
all over the City -- a newbie friend who almost came with me to
Gateway/Pacific was awoken out of a brownie-induced nap at midnight in East
Oakland to ten deafening minutes of unbustable "celebrations."

But if there is a bright side, it may be this -- Oakland needs $$
desperately, due to their Raiders fiasco, and hopefully Officer Friendly's
comments about ravers to Steve Cooley, and observations that the Gateway
crowd peacefully dispersed (in marked contrast to Cool World), can lead to
successful dealings with Oakland officials in the future.

Lawyers ain't gonna save the asses of incredibly sloppy massive promoters.
Raves encompass many different types of people, locations, sizes, music,
etc., and the risks go up exponentially when you have thousands of people.
Keeping things small, and more underground (invite only/tix only in
advance, whether or not seeking permits is necessary), will only help the
odds in the near future.

You're probably talking about Tony Serra, whose personal life reveals he
would be sympathetic to our cause -- I have seen him getting down seriously
during Drums at Grateful Dead shows.  But it's a different matter getting
someone with a name to commit to the rave cause.  We do need to get our
shit together before seeking outside help, which might not be needed if we
can cope ourselves.

Cloud Factory was truly the gem of New Year's Eve! 

Space: A Rock Climbing gym, naturally surreal and absolutely 
       beautiful, was set-up to its greatest potential. I loved 
       dancing on top of shredded rubber! Plus it was also nice to
       get away from the city on such a crazy night.

Police: I have never seen authorities so cooperative with an event 
        like this. They seemed optimistic, and even drove past the 
        front door with their lights on and waving at midnight to 
        ring in the new year!

Music: Phat-ass beats outta four turntables almost all night long
       and into the morning! There was a great diversity in music  
       throughout the night, which insured booty shakin' for ravers
       with discriminating tastes.

Chill space: A 40' truck insured that CF guests would have
            a chill space regardless of the unpredictable weather. As
            it turns out, the rain wasn't bad so we got an
            outside dance area and a chill area. 

Visuals: Two giant screens and and a multitude of video sources
         produced some absolutely spectacular effects.

Free water *and* Chai: An unexpected and surprising double bonus. 

Cloud Factory was one of the most impressive productions I've seen in a
while. Their foresight, organization, attention to detail, and
importantly, their passion, really shone throught at this event. And
with an admission price of $10, I think those nutty kids really spoiled
us.

love, energy, and viberations,

Terry

	One more thing I want to throw out to the list before
I hear more whining about how the cops hate us and want to shut
us down. Remember that huge storm that was predicted to hit on NYE,
yet another "storm of the century"? Well, it didn't quite hit that
hard, at least as far as the wind was concerned, but imagine for a
second that it had. And imagine that we got the same kind of massive
power outages we saw last year. 

	Now imagine you're in Origin, or Gateway, or Cool World,
and the power goes out & stays out - all the power for miles around.

	Well, what do you do?

	And what does everyone around you do?

Having an attorney available simply means having someone who can do
proper legal procedures and interpret (the often confusing) law and
legal language. Much research probably needs to be done, however, into
cabaret laws.

Yes, very good idea. It would also be nice to contrast how things are
being handled now by rave promoters with what is expected by the law,
and the roadblocks that arise. Then we can get a better understanding
of what laws need to be changed, what laws cannot be changed, and what
are the workarounds or compromises that we need to make.

I'd like to organize a mailing list on my server for people interested
in participating in this movement. As interesting as it may be, I'm
not sure how much of this SFRaves as a whole would need to hear about,
and it may be useful for organizing people for a meeting, etc. to have
a separate mailing list.

Please send me email (privately!) if you'd like to see a mailing list
about this. If there's enough interest, expect it to appear sometime
this week. 

It's time to show the community that we're not just a bunch of "kids
on drugs". Ranging from struggling to wealthy, high school to
retirement, we're no different than any other cross section of
society; we just happen to enjoy electronic music and dancing.

heh. "Footloose" unfortunately does come to mind. :)

Rob, the issue isn't about New Year's Eve, it has to do with the
Police hating the rave scene in general. They *do* want to shut us
down, and much of it has to do with money, and even more with the
perception that raves are "evil drug parties". A police officer
herding people at Gateway/Pacific was overheard as calling us a bunch
of "fucked up fairies". So, yes, they hate us.

The Police weren't out there because they care about us. If they were,
they would not have sent us home at 1am on rainy, windy freeways with
drunk drivers. We were safe and dry in our respective warehouses.  Had
the power gone out, we would have lit candles and been happy sharing
New Year's with friends.

Of course, there are the usual ones: Eat Healthy, Quit 
Smoking.....Actually, I've been doing pretty good with the eating healthy 
part.  But I'm just not ready to give up my American Spirit Lights just 
yet :)

I've had a strange past couple of weeks.  Christmas sucked.  It was the 
first Christmas I did not spend with my family.  I guess to really 
understand how I was feeling, you'd have to know and understand my past 
and my family...but I dont want to get into that.  The hollidays really 
made me think about my life and where it is going and where I want it to 
go and how the hell to get there.  I'm not saying I'm unhappy with my 
life.  I'm...well, Kinda doing what I want with my life.  I have a good 
job, I have good friends, I'm healthy, I have a kick ass music studio 
that I dont spend half as much time in as I'd like to because of said 
'good job'.  hmm...maybe its not such a good job afterall....

Anyways, I've always had a problem with expressing my feelings...well, I 
wouldnt actually call it a problem...its just how I am.  Partly because I 
am usually a really quite person.  Its not that I am shy or anything.  I 
could care less what people think about me.  Its just that I am quite.  
nough said.  but the problem with this is I dont express my feelings, my 
thoughts, my emotions, my desires, as much as I should.  or maybe I 
should say, as much as I want to.  

so, Major Resolution Number One:

Express and deal with my feelings and thoughts more.  I think dealing and 
understaning my feelings is going to be much harder than expressing them.

Now, on to Major Resolution Number Two.

I've been attending raves for about 6 years now.  I'd say at least 90% of 
the parties I've attended I've taken E or LSD.  Ectasy is an amazing 
drug.  If you take it inteligently.  Its my belief that if all the 
leaders of the world were thrown in a room each with a hit of E and a 
glass of water, all of our world problems would be solved.  Let 'em duke 
it out on E.  Everyone's would realize that we are all one person.  As 
Dub Tribe would Say "This Planet is Mine, This Planet is Ours, and we 
have GOT to live together."

I know that I have taken E way too many times.  I am not learning 
anything from it anymore.  When I am on E at a party, I'm consentrating 
on how *I* feel.  I'm not consentrating on the music or the global vibe 
and on my surroundings.  Its a *Me* thing now.  I'm beginning to attended 
more parties sober.  And I've realized that when I'm sober, I'm more 
aware of the party and my surroundings.  The music and people have much 
more impact on me, and it is actually easier to talk to people more 
intelegently.  On E, the conversation is usually 'Hows your E, Do you 
want a back rub'....etc... When sober, for me at least, conversations are 
a little bit more genuine.  Maybe its because I know its not a drug 
talking, it is one's true self that is talking.  

I'm not saying I will never take E again.  I just need to take a very 
extended brake from it.

ok, I think thats it.  Damn, it feels good.  I am very much looking 
forward to the year ahead!

See you all in life,

Mark

I guess that's where I feel we need to start and begin to understand 
 exactly what we are "fighting" for.  In my mind (very vast and full 
 this daydreamy afternoon ;) our issues can be defined but worthless if 
 it's not presented in a respectful and empathic manner to the key 
 people who oversee and influence the process to make things "legit" 
 (shudder!).

I tend to like the safety in numbers route and go with as much gusto 
 and influence on/to/in the system to let our needs be heard and met 
 (squeaky wheel syndrome) but "coping ourselves" is appealing if we 
 take the concerned member of the community & educational route which 
 might be the first logical and less rebellious approach.  By forming a 
 committee to interview and work with each city evaluating how to best 
 "support" our desire to dance all night.  Interviews with police, 
 fire, electrical, & other official reps can provide us with an outline 
 of their concerns and needs to legally appease the law.  Take that 
 info and create a check-list/forms and contact list to provide to 
 promoters showing what is required to throw a legit party.  It'll be 
 up to them to adhere to it.  And yeah...it takes away some of the fun 
 in "raving" but I know there'll still be renegades and smaller gigs to 
 keep some things sacred.

We must also acknowledge our weaknesses and perhaps create an 
 educational outreach table/flyer info made available at each party re: 
  resources on abuses, alternative legal ways of expanding 
 consciousness, safe practices, etc.  (Look at the gay community's aids 
 awareness and safe sex campaign.)  By taking away the stigma of 
 unknown fear that the general public and the law associates with 
 raving, it can become more palattable as we have already seen in 
 fashion and music overlaps.  (What the eyes don't see, the belly won't heave!)

We've seen, heard, and rumoured what promoters and club owners do to 
 handle things...very differently and competitively.  Individual 
 motivations can often get in the way of unifying them to openly 
 discuss their war stories and _agree_ (easier said and hardly 
 imagined) what's acceptable and what isn't.  So that path may be left 
 to a later time when other alternatives have been exhausted.

And hey, I'm impressed!  Two attorneys on this list.  And I thought we 
 were a bunch of geeks! ;)

Warm embraces,
Diane

I'm a licensed therapist with an office space and I'm thinking 
about starting a support group for anyone who feels that 
raving is part of their lives.

This group will provide people with the opportunity to explore 
how raving effects your relationships to others and yourself.
An opportunity to talk about whats going on in your life, how its
effecting you, and a chance to get support and gain insight from 
other members of the group.

This group will be limited to 10 people,
if interested please email me privately.

:)

Isn't raving sort of a support group in itself?  :)  Love everyone. :)

Hawaii---
Oahu
first of all funk pistol closed about a year ago. you may want to check
out the Radio Free Hawaii page at
http://www.lava.net/radio-free/
but you should check out this page first...ward industries..they throw
most of the larger parties in hawaii....
http://members.aol.com/wardindus/wardindus.html
you can get some phone numbers here...

as for clubs, there's formula 45(or forty sumptin, I don't remember)
which is the place to be on the weekends. and Kids Klub on the first
sunday of every month... 

as for the other islands, I've never really partied there.
-- 
<you sent this>
--------------------------
Can anyone give me any hints as to rave info phone numbers for any
of the Hawaiian islands, or other rave info for Hawaii? I will try
the Funk Pistol store in Honolulu, if it's still in business; and
will look into some of the record stores too.

 I'd be interested in any nightclub information too.

 Thanks!

i wasn't able to get my ticket...the police man said i had to
leave...then i said. but hey i have to get my bag(i was lying) and he
said "no" you have to leave....so I waited outside of the party, and I
even got to meet the nice asian cop...the one that girl was talking
about, and he was a nice asain cop. but he said I couldn't go back in,
until like an hour later... and I had to go... so I didn't get my
ticket. :0(
do you think gateway will be nice and let me go to the party...if not I
think I'll live though, but I'll be sad. because that metamorphasis
party was going off!!!!!!!oh my god, I'm gonna have dreams about it..

 (you wrote this)
Does anyone know about the party that Gateway is going to throw in place
of the
one that they threw on New Years??? When they gave us our tickets back
they said
that they would be good for another party. If anyone has any info could
you

In a message dated 97-01-02 19:36:46 EST, you write:

<< of "fucked up fairies". So, yes, they hate us. >>
If you got your ass beat by a black kid really bad when you where younger,
would you say all black people are violent. If you got your ass kicked by
some white kid, would you be afraid of every other white kid? If someone from
a large group of people says something, does that mean the whole group
agrees? Does this make sense?

heya people!

ya know, it wasn't only raves that got busted on NYE, like, the only
parties that i heard of that made it thru to the new year was the cF
party and this one formal party that my bro went to that was on a ship
sailin around SF bay. (well, of course the party thrown by the city of SF
and such don't count...)

hmmmmm do raves havta be outside of the big cities or on a ship to avoid
being busted?(hey, would that work? a rave on a boat....)=8-P

anyways, i think all the promoters...of clubs,raves,other "non-rave"
parties, high skool dances <---heh heh, just kiddin... should get
together and ....ummmm...errrrr....uhhhhh...well, do something...wouldn't
that be a big enuff force? i mean don't clubs and the people who rent out
warehouses pay taxes?

have one event for this weekend.  I picked up some other flyers

Break out the glowsticks, flashlights, and candles?  Have a nice,
mellow, ambient time until everyone who's fucked up is good enough to go
home?  And if you're lucky there are a few people with drums, or at
least some good hollow stuff to beat on (I got a crowd dancing with a
city trashcan and a newspaper box)...

Seriously, what does this have to do with cops breaking up peaceful,
consensual gatherings for no reason other than blind prejudice or the
greed of city bureaucrats?  And how does forcing people (possibly
altered, legally or otherwise) out on the street "serve and protect"
anything but their own egos?

In my long history of going to gatherings small and large, I have
_never_ been endangered, or felt endangered, by other revelers.  This
history includes rock concerts, street festivals, punk clubs, Burning
Man, street demonstrations, and much more.  I have been physically
endangered at such events, and harassed and intimidated many times, by
police officers.

Thus my opinion.

 Associated Press Writer
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The government warned consumers not to ingest synthetic
designer drugs with names like "Cherry fX Bomb" that violently sickened dozens
in a crowd of young partygoers at a New Year's Eve "rave" concert.
   The U.S. Food and Drug Administration warned people Wednesday not to consume
colored liquid products named "Orange fX Rush," "Lemon fX Drop," and "Cherry fX
Bomb." The liquids are stored in glass vials.
   "These products have been implicated in severe adverse reactions including
dizziness, nausea, severe shortness of breath and respiratory arrests that
affected approximately 50 people -- some of whom were hospitalized," said FDA
spokesman Jim O'Hara in Washington, D.C.
   O'Hara said confiscated vials of the "fX" products will be tested by the
FDA.
The vials were handed out at the concert, attended by about 10,000 people. Six
people have been arrested for investigation of selling and distributing drugs.
   A 17-year-old boy who suffered a heart attack and an 18-year-old woman were
upgraded from critical to stable condition today. Another boy remained in
critical condition after being struck by a car during the melee that erupted
when the concert was canceled.
   Concertgoer Charlie Bambrook had to be treated for four hours after he drank
an "fX" product and fell to the ground writhing in pain, vomiting.
   "Then they had an announcement: `Do not take this fX, whatever it is, do not
take it,'" the 18-year-old Bambrook told KCAL-TV on Wednesday.
   The rave, an advertised, all-night party known for loud, techno-music was
shut down early, angering youths who paid about $25 to attend. The concert
ended
in a bottle- and stone-hurling melee on downtown streets. A city bus was
violently rocked.
   One young man was hit in the head by an object and a policeman suffered
minor
injuries when he was hit by a bottle, Officer Mike Partain said.
   Officers in riot gear dispersed the crowd by firing rubber pellets.
Order was
restored about 1:30 a.m. Wednesday, officials said. Four people were arrested
for resisting arrest and failing to disperse.
   Dr. Robert Splawn of California Hospital Medical Center said patients
admitted at the center had symptoms from a mix of a variety of drugs.
   "Apparently several drugs were being abused," he said. "We've heard
everything from X (Ecstasy), to LSD to the new one, GHB (Gamma hydroxybutyrate
also known as Liquid X). Some participants told me people were using a
combination of them." GHB is a legal substance.
   The drugs cause euphoria, convulsions and comas, the doctor said.
   A concert promoter described the drink as a legal, herbal stimulant, but
police said they were unsure what the substance was.

	You know, you probably would. And maybe the rest of the people 
at Origin & Gateway would too. From the descriptions of what happened
at Cool World, it sure doesn't sound like *that* crowd would be as cool
as what you've described, but hell, maybe they would too.

	But do you think that the city officials who call the shots for 
large scale organized police activity on NYE *believe* you're cool enough 
to pull that off? Isn't it possible that some of them had nightmare scenarios
involving large scale power outages on NYE running through their minds?
And maybe even they were more concerned about people getting hurt than 
about money or control - or your personal fun time? (Hell, maybe even
a few of them were worried about people getting hurt because of general
humanness, as opposed to the "it will make *me* look bad" thing.)

	Nah, you're probably right. I'm sorry, I forgot that the rave 
community has a monopoly on all things righteous & true. For everyone 
else it's all about money and control and they're all BAD, very very 
BAD. And out to get us, too. Scuse me, I think someone's bugged my 
toilet.

	Well, I've been billy clubbed once by a sadistic asshole cop, 
but I've been physically harmed in various ways by fellow revelers 
at various gatherings much more often than that. I've also met
very decent cops, and thank god, very decent fellow revelers. 
Thus my opinion.

Hi all!  ]=)


 Well due to circumstances WAY beyond my control, I will not be going out 
to any parties during the months of Jan. or Feb. Either as just a dancer 
or as Dionysus Dreams.  =(

 I think a break will be good for me so I'm kinda looking foward to my 
_enforced_ vacation.

 I will try to go to Karma 4 for my birthday and last party for a while. 
There is a small chance I may be able to make the small weeklys here in 
Santa Cruz as they are on weekdays.

 Know that I will miss seeing you folks in reality land but will still be 
in touch via this medium. I _love_ the internet!!!  =)


peace,


Ran D.Dreams

Good Morning

I am running out the door to work, but I would like to keep the momentum
going forward on getting a group together to talk about how we can change
this tide..

Steve, Jonathan, Diane, and all of those who are serious about putting
their time and energy into a positive, problem-solving mode, please contact
me by email with your phone numbers.

Open communication is a key, both with authorities and with the community,
and Tom and Stacy have the idea of doing some sort of newsletter to spread
information through the community (btw, they're working on a makeup party
now)...

I have lots to say, and no time right now, but I'll be back with more..
Count me in in every possible way.

Leslie

High Adam!

Sounds cool...  What city do you live in? How many people can you fit into
your house? Can I bring my huka for a little 420?

Hey Everyone!

First up, massive thanks to everyone for their support at the NYE Trance
party, as well as the Afterparty the next day. Turns out Johhny Law showed
up at both events, but left us alone. We had things well under control, so
they didn't have a reason to give us a hard time. Nice!  :)

I've found that there is a certain amount of gray area in which you can
operate and not get hassled. Deviate outside of the gray, and your bound to
attrach attention to yourself. Low key is the place to be.  :)

Next. My perception on the authorities "crack down" with "Rave"

- There's been so much bad publicity with "rave" that They feel it shouldn't
happen. As Gobbels (Hitler's propaganda minister) once said: "A lie told
often enough becomes the truth." Bad media = negative perception = bias',
judgements = negative reactions. I've spoken with the local authoroties on
this, and as long as the event doesn't have any connection with the word
"Rave", they're much more willing to work with you. 

- The city governments don't make any money of the profits, so it's in their
interest to minimize the "popularity" of such events, so as to keep control
over who's makin' money. Why allow a bunch of kids to make money if the city
ain't gettin it's "fair" share?

- it's NYE. Johnny's gets paid overtime to work if he has the excuse.
Busting "illegal" parties is a good excuse to work NYE, so why not clock
some extra hours at the cities (ie taxpayers) expense. Hell, we actually
PAID the police to bust our parties with our tax dollars! What a racket!


I spoke with Steve on Wednesday about his working to mobilize the community
to change to laws here in town (BTW, thanks for the support, Steve!). Having
a group of people petition the city is a great idea. Unfortunately, city
government (esp. Willie Brown's) usual gives a rat's ass about people. The
bottom line is: Is the city making money? If so, then your argument has some
validity. If not, well talk all you want, but unless it get's national press
coverage, your wasting time. I've spoken with some people in Scaramento, as
well as city offices, about this, and that's the general consensus.

The city's trying to get money by raising the permit fees. Once they were
$500, then $750 now their $1300. Yikes! 

So it seems that in order to approach the city, you have to convince them
that they're making money by allowing us to dance. How so?

Get support from local businesses. The more people here the music, the more
music they want to buy, which means more sales from the stores, which means
more tax dollars for the city.  If local businesses are involved, and the
city's getting revenue from their business, then they're gonna be much more
receptive to your arguement. 

Lump in the "community" aspect on top of your argument, and your bound to
convince a few.

But that still leaves the negative perceptions. Sure, the city is making
money, but what about all these drugs and everything?

Change the perceptions. We at Space Station Russ have been talking of
getting a media campaing together to helps dispell a few myths about our
culture. We got to find a new name for what we do, and *bonk* the public on
the head with it until their perceptions change.

After all, the truth told often enough becomes...well...the truth!  ;)

As a music distributor, I can help rally the support of local businesses,
but I'll need help. Steve, line up some meetings so we can delegate some
responsibilities and get this thing rolling.

Oh yeah... the afterparty  on NYD went so well, that we'll be turning it
into a weekly thing. Keep your eyes and ears open for the new place to be
Sunday mornings!

later!

Jonas
 
P.S. Sorry I haven't had a chance to write everyone back personally, but
I've been EXTREMELY busy. End of year inventory SUCKS!!!!!

Allright everone I don't watch TV or listen to radio so could someone confirm or
deny (hopefully deny) that this happened? I was told by a friend that on NYE in
LA at some massive that a new drug showed up. I'm told that all my friend heard
was that it was liquid, came in a vial, and it was orange and apparently within
the first few hours of the party 30 people had passed out on it (sort of like
GHB). The promoters of the event called in ambulences and when they arrived so
did a number of police officers. after a short while they decided that this
LEGAL, PERMITTED, PAID FOR, TAXED, LISCENSED, AND SECURITIED party was to be
shut down at like 11:00 PM. I'm told that severeal people were imploring the
police to let the party go it wasn't there fault that these people had passed
out and the party was legal after all. When they still said shut it down some
name calling and insults were shouted at the police and the police decided that
they needed to "take control of the situation" which apparently ,so I'm told,
involved the police opening fire on the crowd with rubber bullets, tear gas and
started hittin folks with battons. My friend also stated that he'd seen an
article where one of the injured (like some 17 year old kid with stitches on
his head) stated that all he knew was that police were telling everone to leave
when they were still dancing to music from cars in a parking lot that he just
said fuck it and started to leave and thats when police started fuckin people
up. he stated that " It was looking bad and I just wanted out and thats when
the cop hit me" 

Well folks this scares the hell out of me for several reasons. First what is
this orange liquid substance that knocks people out like that (was it in fact
GHB,although I doubt it)and is it here (I assume that it probably is since I
was also told that police found 10,000 doses of the stuff at the party). If
this stuff is here and really is that bad then were looking at a promoters
fuckin nightmare. And also with all the parties in SF that go shut down on NYE
and the fact that there seems to have been more busted parties lately are the
police finaly "taking a stand" aginst the rave comunity at large as they stated
about a year ago. And if so What can we do about it?

As I previously stated this was something I heard from a friend and I hope he
heard incorrectly. could someone clarify this "tragedy" or explain what really
happened or if this is just some rumor. (although it's pretty detailed for a
rumor) 

Peace out everyone, hope YOU had a pleasant NYE, I did, two words Cloud
Factory!

People were dying.
 Sometimes police kind of concider fatalities at parties pretty good reason
to shut down I guess.
 Some dood decided to jump off the balcony while on some heavy drugs. True
story. 
 Rumor (more than likely a true one) Cool World bailed out of HJK and left
the managing up to the Employees. If someone bailed out on me, people were
dying and going nuts with my fire alarms...  I don't man. I might want to
stop shit too.

What a New Years though. Wow!

Evidently not.  People pass out from alcohol, even get hospitalized for
alcohol poisoning all the time, and no one considers it unusual.  But
someone passes out from something else and everyone gets all wound up.

And this decision prevented further pain and suffering how?

(Aside from the minor detail of there not being any fatalities.)

Seems like all they did was hurt a bunch _more_ people, _after_ everyone
had already been told to stay away from the stuff that was knocking
people out.

I'm not pointing fingers at anyone here; there's plenty of blame to go
around and, in the end, it really doesn't matter who's fault it was. 
The point is, bad stuff happened, and some people reacted wrongly to it
-- police, promoters, and partygoers too.

What can we learn from this?  I have a few tentative conclusions:
1) Don't ingest something if you don't know what it is.
2) Don't taunt people who are in a shitty mood anyway.
3) If you're going to throw a party, be prepared for the worst, and have
a sound approach planned out to deal with it (to avoid things like 2,
above)
4) If you're going to attend a party, be prepared for the worst, and
have an approach planned out.  It's good to think beforehand about what
throwing bottles around will accomplish.

For instance: I went to a Crash Worship show once with a friend.  We
agreed to get the hell out of there if the cops showed up, because he
had been busted in the infamous New Year's raid (this was a couple of
years ago) and didn't want to risk being recognized.  So when the
promoters called the cops, we got the hell out of there, even though the
dancing in the street afterwards evidently was quite cool, and no one
got arrested.  The risk wasn't worth it.  I've engaged in CD before, but
that wasn't the time.

What you wrote is pretty much the truth, as far as I know.  Almost exactly
what you wrote was on the front page of the SF Chronicle yesterday.  They
were doing tests on the drug, as no one knew what it was.  Although, it
was called FX.  I'd keep reading newspapers, especially the California
sections to find out what was the mixture that got so many people
seriously sick.  

"RAVE" does appear to be a dirty word these days and it's certainly
showing in the media.  I hesitate to use the word with my non-raver
friends because of the negative connotation.  I'm thinking about writing
to the editorials of the Chronicle about how the media portrays raving.
It's easy.  They publish most everything.  And, it's a simple way to get
the word out.  A few reasonable letters about the positive aspects of
raving might go a long way to counterbalancing all the negative stuff.  To
me, when you are dealing with the mainstream, it might be a good idea to
work within those limits.

But, it's just an idea!

     ok, sfravers here's your chance...
     
     i'm leaving here to move on to other more independent ventures (mostly 
     makeing muzik n stuff) and they're looking for someone else to help 
     out full time in the Harris-Farinon Spare Products Support Center for 
     both Domestic and International.  Harris-Farinon Division makes 
     microwave radios that run our cellphones and stuff.  They are located 
     in Redwood Shores.  
     
     Some experience with computers like IBM and Excel and that stuff along 
     with knowing some database stuff would be helpful.  It's not a 
     horribly complicated job, but it will take a bit of training.  You'll 
     be doing quotations and entering orders into the mainframe computer 
     system as well as directly contacting customers by phone and fax.  It 
     is full time from 7:30 am to 4:30 pm mon-fri and they are looking for 
     someone who wants something long term (well, at least a year or so).  
     
     email me privately if you think you're interested.  
     
     thanx

Hey kids -

I think we have no choice but to work with the proper authorities.  We 
cannot seem to throw too many events (except the very smallest) without 
being swooped on; it remains up to the generosity of the cop in question 
whether we get to party or not.  Even CCC was visited on NYE - a small 
party of about 300 people.  So, the idea of having renegade parties that 
escape the notice of police seems like a fantasy, or exceptional luck.  

I don't know if cops are out to get us, just for fun.  I see them more as 
doing their jobs - 
enforcing the fire code when they shut down parties (in most cases), 
generating revenue for the city (permits),  though also being too quick to 
use force when people don't follow their orders immediately (crowd 
dispersal).  If we were able to throw parties within 
the legal limitations, I doubt there would be much harassment from the 
cops.  After all, permit fees would have been paid.  

Honestly, I don't see the fire code as a great oppressor to us.  I 
personally am hesitant about spending all night in old brick warehouses, 
with one tiny entrance, narrow stairways and floors that threaten to fold 
with the weight of the crowd.  The reason such a location is not legal is because it is 
DANGEROUS.  

Personally, I'm tired of dirty dangerous places.  I think we deserve 
better - the right to dance all night in a safe and comfortable place.  
It's a dream, anyway.  Could organizing our community help lead to its 
creation?

Is it even possible for us to have a legal event?  Will we be 
granted permits at all?  Is the fee reasonable?  Will cover charges 
have to rise astronomically?  Will our hours of dancing be restricted?  
May we rent out a legal location (small club) all-night for all-ages if 
no alcohol is served?

I don't know if all this ground has been trod before by the many 
wonderful partythrowers in the Bay Area.  Advance apologies if this is 
all old news.  And I can see complications like political pressure from 
powerful legit clubs, cops/city officials unwilling to aid "raves" 
(perception of teens on dangerous drugs, ultimate accountability to 
taxpayer parents), and huge, extortionary permit fees.

But let's at least find out what we "officially" need to do to throw our 
events.  A show of respect and willingness to learn how we can play by 
the rules may go far to improve our image with authorities.  Coupled with 
a public relations campaign and even a ballot initiative, perhaps we can 
turn the tide that runs against all-night dance events.

What exactly is illegal about a private individual renting their own 
property to a group of people to have a party?  Especially in an 
industrial area with no residents around to be bothered?  And considering 
that the crowd is peaceful, safe, and causes no problems?? 

_I_ haven't been able to understand the problem, but there obviously are 
some.  Let's try to address the authorities' concerns, if possible, 
because eluding the authorities seems unlikely.  Although with 
_some_ of their concerns - unsafe buildings, young teens on dangerous 
drug combinations - I have to say I utterly concur!

Being legit is not selling out.  It means we are taking care of - and 
building - our community.  

With hope,
Nancy

I'd have to say that anyone who takes any sort of drugs without at least a
pretty good indication of what it is, and what it does, and of the source,
isn't behaving very wisely.  Would you go into the woods and just eat any
pretty plant or mushroom without knowing what it is?  
I think not.
The key to being and staying free and healthy is knowledge.  Use any substance
wisely and knowingly, and you're not likely to have a bad trip.
much love,
Bruce.

The only good thing on the news was that the media didn't say "rave", they
said rock concert.
I was pretty upset awhile back when Hard Copy did their major exploitation
of raves. Now people in this conservative country town I live in, frown
upon hearing the word "rave", because they automatically think drugs and
Satan.  Ha, ha, pretty funny huh! So I'm kinda glad this time they said
concert.  I saw the story on CNN. elina

Some points to make with authorities:

FINANCIAL
1) The electronic dance subculture has spawned a thriving economy, 
including many small businesses, providing employment, tax revenue and 
creating successful local entrepreneurs
2) Partygoers support this economy and travel into cities for specialty 
shops, spending money in these shops and other establishments
3) Partygoers spend money in cities that host events, such as on public 
transportation, gas stations, restaurants 
4) Tourism.  The dance subculture is a global phenomenon, with many people 
traveling to other cities/even countries partly to attend events. 
5) As events cause few problems other than permit violations, precious 
police resources are wasted during otherwise dangerous weekend nights

THE ATTENDEES
1) the crowd that attends is overwhelmingly peaceful and safe
2) as opposed to clubbers and bar-goers, attendees at all-night events 
often leave in the morning.  They are not driving on the streets at 2AM, 
which is safer for them and others.
3) all-ages events are a recreational outlet for teens, who have few 
other possibilities
4) all-ages events provide a safe place where a large amount of young people 
peacefully converge, as opposed to looking for excitement on city 
streets or in drunken parties
5) there is no alcohol served at all-night dance events

THE COMMUNITY
1) The dance subculture is renowned for a strong sense of community, 
based on positive values
2) Violence at dance events is remarkably rare
3) Police visits to dance events are overwhelmingly for lack of legal 
permits, NOT because of violence or any other emergency
4) Many dance events contribute proceeds to charity causes, such as toy 
drives at Christmas, Food Not Bombs, etc.
5) Being a global phenomenon, the dance subculture is forging positive 
links between cities domestically and internationally 

and this is just off the top of my head

     Excerpt from "Chicken Soup for the Soul".  A raver type of story....

     I was in New York the other day and rode with a friend in a taxi.  When
we got out, my friend said to the driver, "Thank you for the ride.  you did a
superb job of driving."  
     The taxi driver was stunned for a second.  Then he said, "Are you a wise
guy or something?" 
     "No, my dear man, and I'm not putting you on.  I admire the way you keep
cool in heavy traffic." 
     "Yeah," the driver said and drove off.
     "What was that all about?" I asked.
     "I am trying to bring love back to New York," he said.  "I believe it's
the only thing that can save the city."
     "How can one man save New York?"
     "It's not one man.  I believe I have made that taxi driver's day.
 Suppose he has 20 fares.  He's going to be nice 20 fares because someone was
nice to him.  Those fares in turn will be kinder to their employees or
shopkeepers or waiters or even their own families.  Eventually the goodwill
could spread to at least 1,000 people.  Now that isn't bad, is it?"
     "But you're depending on that taxi driver to pass your goodwill to
others."
     "I'm not depending on it," my friend said.  "I'm aware that the system
isn't foolproof so I might deal with ten different people today.  If out of
ten I can make three happy, then eventually I can indirectly influence the
attitudes of 3,000 more."
     "It sounds good on paper," I admitted, "but I'm not sure it works in
practice."
     "Nothing is lost if it doesn't.  It didn't take any of my time to tell
that man he was doing a good job.  He neither received a larger tip nor a
smaller tip.  If it fell on deaf ears, so what?  Tomorrow there will be
another taxi driver I can try to make happy."
     "You're some kind of nut," I said.
     "That shows how cynical you have become.  I have made a study of this.
 The thing that seems to be lacking, besides money of course, for our postal
employees, is that no one tells people who work for the post office what a
good job they're doing."
     "But they're not doing a good job."
     "They're not doing a good job because they feel no one cares if they do
or not.  Why shouldn't someone say a kind word to them.
     We were walking past a structure in the process of being built and
passed five workmen eating their lunch.  My friend stopped.  "That's a
magnificent job you men have done.  It must be difficult and dangerous work."
     The workmen eyed my friend suspiciously.
     "When will it be finished?"
     "June," a man grunted.
     "Ah.  That really is impressive.  You must all be very proud."
     We walked away.  I said to him, "I haven't seen anyone like you since
The Man From LaMancha."
     "When those men digest my words, they will feel better for it.  Somehow
the city will benefit from their happiness."
     "But you can't do this all alone!" I protested.  "You're just one man."
     "The most important thing is not to get discouraged.  Making people in
the 
city become kind again is not an easy job, but if I can enlist other people
in m campaign....."
     "You just winked at a very plain-looking woman," I said.
      "Yes, I know," he replied. "And if she's a school-teacher, her class
will be in for a fantastic day."
                                   --Art Buchwald

<<Greetings Earthlings>>

	We here at Lepidoptera Global Headquarters are gearing up for our 
next event, and are toying w/ tentative lineups for this and future 
parties. One thing I personally am aiming for is to showcase 
up-and-coming DJ's. It seems like there is a lot of undiscovered talent 
out there. So, we would like to hear from you. If you have a tape you can 
send us, please email us privately or leave a message on our voicemail @ 
408.535.0432. Either way, please give us your name, the style or styles 
your music encompasses, and any other info you deem relevant.

	Those of you who are vinyl-deficient, please feel free to contact 
us concerning anything else (you can lend a hand, you want to be on the 
mailing list, etc). We LOVE to hear from you.

						Hugs :)

The Short Revue:

Best party of '96. Props -> DBN, Mushgroove, Incredibeets, Placebo, UPS :)

The Long Version (in my aimlessly meandering style):

Advance apologies 2 the sfraves folk who don't care... I thought some of u might be 
interested. I know u'all get a ton o mail, 'cause I'm on the list. Get this mw-raves; 
the sfraves list brings in twice as much e-mail as the mw-raves list and it's just Bay 
area! ;) I can't wait 2 get out there, tho I will miss u mw-ravers tons!

Before I start, does anyone know what was happenning with the passed out (I assume) 
person by the right speakers (facing the djs, in the main room)? I was kinda concerned 
about this person, who was laying on the floor (with friends trying 2 care 4 her/him) 
for about a half hour until the paramedics showed up. Maybe the DBN krew know 
something? Just curious...

Another thing, does anyone out there know how 2 contact this girl who goes by "jewel" 
(it's not her real name), from Milwaukee? I met her near the end of the evening and she 
is supra-kewl, but we got disconnected and she left before we could do the number 
thing. Any help would be wonderful and greatly appreciated. Please, reply private, TIA.

Okay, hope I don't ramble 2 much, if so jus' click <delete> :) So, here goes...

Rode up 2 'Waukee with Randy, it was a nice ride. Thanks Randy! :) Got 2 the space 
around 10:00p or so. Bumped into MikeyD at the entrance passing out flyers 4 RELEASE 
(UTC). Kewl, "kickin' kiwi-lime" Kool-Aid packet stickered flyer! :) Then bumped into 
Marc on the way up the stairs. Hi!

Wait a minute... I didn't get searched, what? I always have a slight concern about 
weapons and stuff when there's no search, but there is always a yang 4 the yin (it's 
really nice jus' walkin into a party) and I did not notice any violence/troubles all 
night long. There was some guy walking around clenching his fists, don't think that 
counts as violence, tho there was some bad vibes at times. :) I sure am glad I wasn't 
at that mega-rave in L.A. (sorry, Gage).

I had a wonderful time. I loved it. Met a buncha nice ppl (sound familiar?) and saw a 
buncha others, I can never get enough of! ;) A little too much hardcore 4 most people, 
I think. Tho, I totally dug it. Randy was unable 2 protect his soul from the evil 
hardcore and ended up spiritually depleted around 3:00a. Randy, I sure hope Satan 
has returned your soul unscathed. :) If u change your mind about the big parties and u 
decide 2 start going again, u might consider investing in a soul protection cloak. I 
think they run about 3000 gold pieces at the magic shop. :)

I, too, thought the emmcee shoulda "shut the fuck up" half of the time he was talking. 
The other half of the time, I was laughing my ass off at what I thought he was saying. 
;)

The loudest dam midnite countdown I have ever heard! Does the DBN krew have a final 
head count? My guess is 5,000 ppl. Randy and I were standing around at the countdown 
and just after midnite, saw J-Sun (who we were half-assed looking 4 since we got 
there). We ran over...big hugs! Shit, J-Sun, the 2 of us and bear hugs are a lethal 
combination! *crack* :)

Alec Empire: as I expected, my brain totally exploded! It was extremely difficult 
trying 2 gather up all of the pieces and super-glueing them back into my head... I 
totally loved his set! Yeah, it was hard as hell and u really couldn't dance 2 it, but 
it was a great trip. Just stood there 4 a while holding my white cellophane NYE hat on 
my head and jumping up and down like a maniac with J-Sun (Randy was running 4 cover, I 
think). ;) Later in his set he did some really kewl stuff with some really spatial 
droning audio. That was my favorite part. :)

Total Output: I really liked the music. BUT, the girl (singing?) was sending scary 
chills down my spine. I ended up having nitemares of her screaming all of this 
fucked-up shit at me... Eeeks! :o

P909: I ended up entering another dimension during their set. I remember hearing some 
nice stuff going on, but 4 some reason. It really didn't grab me. Which is wierd 'cause 
I love their studio work. Might have just been that time of the evening 4 me. ;)

Net Meet: Ooops. Was there supposed 2 be a net meet? ;) Sorry I missed out, It would 
have been nice 2 meet those of u I haven't met yet.

Phantom 45: Jungle has a small place in my heart and the man like Brian always 
reinforces it. Tho, I didn't catch alot of the set, what I heard was quite nice.

Around 3:00a or so, I was trying 2 find Amy and Scott 2 juggle my ride home. I don't 
get it with u 2... There is somewhere another dimension which these 2 go into, when 
they're at parties. I don't know where it is, but is certainly not within the realm of 
my perception. :|

4:40a, in the dark and scary room, stopped by with MikeyD looking 4 Amy. Wait, I know 
this song. Shit, it's Delta9! At 4:40a? Eh? "What kinda krazy party is this? Putting 
Delta9 at 4:40a?" That was pretty wild. Jumped aronud 4 a little while, didn't stay for 
the whole set. Had had enough hardcore 4 the night, but I love Dave's stuff and the 
system in that 2nd room wasn't doing it justice. So...

I looked 4 Amy until like 5:00a when I gave up and decided 2 leave with Randy and give 
J-Sun directions 2 my place 4 his krew and Amy's krew 2 crash. At that very moment 
(writing directions 4 J-Sun), the girl shows up and says "r u leaving?". I was soo 
happy 2 see her my head almost exploded (again) and I got 2 stay! :)

The Christmas Light room was very nice. At one point, I walked by the room and there 
was some booty house playing and everybody was crammed in there together squirming and 
dancing. I thought it looked like something from the remake of "The Thing", like all of 
these ppl had been morphed together. Wooo, scary dance-orgy stuff! I wanted 2 join 
in... but I ain't got the guts. ;)

I'm not sure how I feel about the strippy girls dancing on the stage. On one hand I 
thought it was kinda crude and such (especially near the end of the night when they 
were getting all nasty). On the other hand, I got a chance 2 talk a little with a few 
of them and they were really nice and all, so I don't know? There were times when a 
buncha guys were standing in front of them, just like drooling and such. That was 
pretty sad...

I think I feel the same confused yin/yang way about the video from Demon Puppet. The 
sex and bondage and such is okay (especially during the hardcore) 4 a while, but what 
about some nice fractals, colored-oil, computer animation types of stuff? After all, 
we've got live flesh on stage (smells better than video, tho the video did look better 
than the girls, at times). :)

Went up 2 the bar and this girl asks me if I have fifty cents... I just started 
laughing, 'cause I didn't think I had any money at all (ended up with $2 in quarters in 
my pocket). I couldn't stop laughing. I finally settled down and explained that I was 
pretty broke and she came across her cash and offered 2 buy me a drink. :) This turns 
out 2 be the girl like "jewel". We went and sat down and talked 4 a bit and then danced 
for a while. What a sweetheart! I love meeting nice ppl! :) I went adventuring for a 
bit alone, went downstairs, came back up and no more "jewel". Oh well, we'll see what 
fate has in store... I am sure we'll connect again, someday. :)

BTW, I was previously pretty much against alcohol at parties, but I had 2 drinks NYE 
and really enjoyed 'em. As others on the list have said, it's all good, moderation is 
the key. Anyway, I still think it's a problem 'cause of laws which can close down a 
party with alcohol.

The space was great, like others have said. I agree that it would be nice 2 see people 
use trashcans 4 a change. AND alla those flyers ain't cheap, so why are there always so 
many that end up trashed on the floor? I must again reflect on the yin and yang here; 
It sure is fun kicking all of that trash around in the morning before the party ends. 
:)

Danced mostly on the main floor until around 9:15a or so. I think it was Bernard Badies 
or Reese (or both) who kept me moving. Nice, innovative house. I would try to stop 
dancing, but it jus' wouldn't work. It's wierd, but I think I am starting to appreciate 
house music (scary). :) What a bash! ;)
Kickin' trash. :)

Never really noticed the lights 'cept the ones beaming right into your face at the 
front of the stage. ouch. Props 2 The People's Republic of China 4 kewl purple 
sunglasses! :)

Went 2 breakfast at McD's w/ Amy and krew. Amy, thanks 4 the ride back! :) Saw some 
cops hassling some ravers outside, who just came from the (tiny room) afterhours. I 
guess they looked like ravers... u know. The cops intended on shutting down the 
afterhours, I guess...

MikeyD offered me a backup ride. Thanks 4 looking out 4 me... :)

Hope all of u enjoyed a wonderful, peaceful and loving holiday season! :)

You know, it's interesting that never before in my life have I met two
Noahs at the same time in the same room!  Wow; I guess that makes CF's
Rockclimbing warehouse space our ark, huh?  In the midst of madness,
we found a shelter to protect us -- from the storms of both nature and
society.
Just some food for thought; maybe I just had one too many pixie stix...
;)  Love you all!

Right on, Bruce.  I am always amazed by users' willingness to be ignorant
of what they ingest.  Please, folks, look into what you use before you
just gulp it down, or you don't know what could happen to you.  I mean,
what if it was orange, red, or purple-colored turpentine?  Trust is good
and all, but absolute blind trust can be a bit dangerous...  Okay, enough
of my  preachy-stuff.  Take care, all; stay healthy; love ya'!/\/\/\/

This may be a little late but I'll give ya the low down anyhow...

In netscape, go to the "Options" menu and choose "Mail and News
Preferences".  In here you'll need to enter the address of your news
server.  Click on the "Server" tab and at the bottom fill in the info for
your News server.  Your ISP should have given your the address...for
example mine is "news.isp.net".  Your's may be similiar but could be
different.

THen you can click ok to exit the preferences and then click on the
"Window" menu and choose "Netscape News"  This will bring up a new window.
Go to the "File" menu and choose "Add Newsgroup"  then type in "alt.raves"
and after downloading the articles it should display the group in the left
upper frame, the articles in the upper right frame and if you click on an
article the bottom frame will contain the actual text.  Downloading the
newsgroup may take a while so be patient.

To post an article click on the "To: News" button and your set to go.

Good luck,
G

If you run into any probs just let me know!

Sorry for disturbing everyone...but I am looking for someone familiar with
Digital Equipment Corporation.

I must interview someone from DEC or one of their suppliers, vendors,
customers or competitors.  If you qualify as one of the above or know of
someone who does I would be eternally greatful if you got a hold of me.
This is for a strategic management class I am taking...

A recent addition to our fair city and a soon-to-be beautiful addition to
the SF rave community needs to find a place to hang her hat. She's looking
to share housing, a room for rent, and/or just some housing info. If you
all could e-mail me any info you have, I'm sure she would appreciate it a
bunch. Thanks in advance for any help you can give!!

Some stats: She's 21, great energy, fun, thoughtful, and employed!

Hi all!  ]=)


 I'm a long time fan of the old skool YES (from start in 1969 to 1980) 
and in fact YES is the reason for me being a multi-media live production 
artist.

 Anyway, I was listening to some of their stuff the other day and heard 
some lyrics that really resonated with me and my relationships to raving. 
I thought I would share that bit of lyrics with you.

 I hope you all can enjoy;


	"From the moment I reached out to hold, I felt a sound.
	 And what touches our soul, slowly moves as touch rebounds.
	 And to know that tempo will continue, lost in trance of dances.
	 As rhythm takes another turn.
	 As is my want, I only reach, to look in your eyes."

Lyrics credited to YES (probably Jon Anderson) 1974.
>From the song "Sound Chaser" off the album "Relayer"



cheers!  =)

------------------------

Three mice were sitting in a bar talking about how tough they were.

The first mouse slams a shot and says, "I play with mouse traps for fun.
  I'll run into one on purpose and as it is closing on me, I grab the
bar and bench press it twenty or thirty times."  And with that he slams
another shot.

The second mouse slams a shot and says, "That's nothing.  I take those
Decon tablets, cut them up and snort them just for the fun of it."   And
with that he slams another shot.

The third mouse slams a shot, gets up and walks away.  The first two
mice look at each other, and then turn to the third mouse and ask,
"Where the hell are you going?"

The third mouse stops and replies, "I'm going home to fuck the cat."

I think that if people are going to push for this permit thing, they might
want to drop RAVE from any mention altogether. You have enough fighting
ahead of you, so why make it more difficult by associating the thing you're
doing with rave?  Rave, despite all attempts, has a very negative
connotation with law enforcement and many civic authorities.  Just because
1 good cop says it's all good, does not mean the the strcuture he is a part
of sees it his way (I have talked to a NUMBER of cops about pot, they think
the laws are stupid, but they have a job, and the substance is illegal
so...). I think that Nancy's point should be taken as methods by which you
make your goal a win-win for the community and clubbers.  Always mention
the dollars, but don't mention the money that is part of the dance
community (all of which is cash, and cannot be traced through the IRS),
instead talk about the financial benefits to the surrounding community from
partyers spending their money in late nite cafes & restaurants.  You will
obviously need to form alliances with vendors & businesses that could
benefit from the nite crawlers.  You would also benefit from community
leaders who have direct connects to Brown.  Like I said, it will be more
than just signing a petition, getting attorneys, and corssing your fingers.
It is an all out effort, that will cost alot of time effort and money to
get organized and stay as an organized effort.

One more item, if you're going to talk about how peaceful we supposedly
are, there should be some stats to back it up.  That goes for everything,
hard numbers are the way to win any political game.  Vagueness will lose
the game.  Get as many allies from as many quarters as you can, get your
numbers ready, get ahold of the supes rally them, then present.  Oh yeah,
press, press, press.  Get as much press as you can.  SF Weekly and the Bay
Guardian are good and acessible starts.

And as always, good luck to the warriors.

PEace,
John

P.S.  All of this is IMO, take what is useful, or junk it alltogether.
Just wanted to chime in with suggestions for those who may want to take
this thing up.

UG don't need no permits so.

BUSTED.  Hasn't been busted, and WON'T be busted.
-Do you know that it is completely word of mouth?  There are NO flyers.
Basically if you know who is doing things, you can find out.  It has been
in effect for YEARS, even before the rave scene.

Yeah, in a way I'm teasing, since some things should never be brought near
the surface, suffice it to say it does exist.  I have only attended one of
the events to date, some time ago.  But it recently came to my attention
that it is still alive well and thriving.

Things can be done in the city, it all depends on how slick you really want
to be.

UG never needs permits, and if done right, doesn't need greedy cops and
authorities either.

Just a thought,
John

James,

	I haven't forgotten your interest in FnF photos (from the party
several months ago).  I'm working on 'em, and will send them to you as
e-mail attachments ASAP :)
Peace,

UPDATE on DIGITAL BE-IN #9

This digest of Be-In 9 material forwarded by Brian Zisk, San FranZiskGo!  . . .

    * Thursday January 9. 7:00 p.m.

      Digital Be-In

      Thirty years ago, S.F. was host to The Human Be-In, a now-historic
      counter-culture gathering of hippies and other assorted "freaks" who
      converged on Golden Gate Park to express their commitment to forging a
      new future together. The Digital Be-In's 9th annual event is a tribute
      to the spirit of that day, and to the ever-increasing diversity of the
      wired world. Show highlights include musical performances by
      post-modern world music ensemble Beyond Race, African cultural rap by
      Hoopla Thang, Brazilian drummers and dancers Loco Bloco. Dancers
      include the traditional Aztec dance troupe Danza Teokalli, Panjaya
      Collective's "Angels in Cyberspace" performance piece, and the Burning
      Man fire dancers. Strategically held during the Macworld Expo, Verbum's
      ever-evolving Be-In is a multimedia concert, exhibition and gathering.
      The realtime event will be netcast with several video streams, virtual
      photography, and on-the-fly photojournalism, and can be accessed at
      www.be-in.com. SOMAR Gallery, 934 Brannan St. Tickets $15.00, available
      through Ticketweb, through BASS, and at the Micro Publishing News Booth
      at MacWorld - No 2348.

Response for tickets to this hot Macworld week event has been overwhelming.
We are no longer able to handle ticket orders via the Verbum hotline. To
get yours, please order from Ticketweb (www.Ticketweb.com), Bass Tickets,
or buy them at The MicroPublishing News booth at the Macworld Expo (No
2348).  Looks like this one will sell out.

Any orbital fans out there?

For those in the know, seeing orbital live is probably one of the greatest
delicacies fer technoheads...

...Well, for all of you that have indelible impressions of Orbital Live
(remember hearing SATAN, the first time?)...and for all of you who may be
interested in getting some....

 ...

if you are in the Market Street SF area this weekend...

check out VIRGIN megastore>>

sound whack? well, i was there of friday...and they have Three (3...count
'em) import singles of <SATAN,live> which include 3 different versions of
the namesake tune, plus other live versions of early orbital classics like
LUSH, IMPact, CHIme, and more....as the bonus tracks...

They are kinda pricey at $8.99, each, but I have not seen these before
anywhere else...

oh, and the good news?>>>

you can listen to all three <de gratis, that is FREE> on the CD listening
stations!

=)

enjoy,

g.

You wouldn't think the fire code would be too tough to deal with from
looking at qualified places like 1015 and DV8...imagine being upstairs at
Nikita or way down in that back room at Spundae when some sort of panic
breaks out and you all have to leave, NOW.  It doesn't sound much nicer
than it would in a lot of warehouses I've been to.  Of course fire and
building codes have lots of other reasonable concerns, like safe wiring,
structural integrity, that sort of thing, but you never hear about
them--it's always, "What if there were a fire/earthquake/tidal wave/meteor
strike and all these people were TRAPPED INSIDE?"  Which is a good
question, but if a place like 1015 can answer it satisfactorily, a promoter
with a decent warehouse should be able to as well.  Maybe the clubs have a
bunch of secret emergency exits, or something...still, I'm sure there are
other spaces that can meet those standards.

Hello Sfraves!


	Well, we hope everyone had a safe new years. We send our love and
support to all of the production crews of the bay area that had, well,
not so good luck with the police on new years. But as always, something
really good will come of it! So keep your eyes peeled!


	As for the Harmony crew, our first event in the year of '97 is coming
just around the corner. We would like to start this year by thanking
everyone who has ever participated, helped, and supported us. This event
will be a small party, devoted to our family. You guys have helped create
some of the most positive, energetic, love-filled parties that we could
ever dream of. What Harmony is today, is exactly what we dreamed it to be
over three years ago! And for this, we are eternally greatful...


<center>So, on Saturday, January 18th '97, come join us for a night
of...


<bigger><bigger>FAMILY

</bigger></bigger></center><bigger>

With dj's : Ethan - Mystr-e - Cloud - James - Greg - Matt Schmitt -
(guest)


	This party has an extremly limited capacity, so call our voice mails for
more info. The space is in the east bay somewhere and there is a strong
possibilty of all the tickets only being availible through presold ticket
locations. (like BASS, j/k) Anyways, stay tooned and keep your ears open
for where we will be with the tickets. Tickets will be $10 (if you
<underline>promise</underline> to come <underline>dressed up</underline>
in your funkiest clothes) We can't really hold you to that, so try to be honest. Anyways, until then we will see you around and happy new year!

Hello!

Request:
Does anyone have a copy of the movie or the book "The Deep"  I need to 
copy the cover of it.

BSP:
My sister is selling off about nine of her Nakamichi cassette decks.  
They have been used a total of about twenty hours each. She said their 
MSRP is about $900.00.  She's selling them for $500.00.  They are in LA 
and can be shipped to you at her cost.  They are BADASS!  I have one if 
you would like to see how they sound.

If you need to get in touch with me about this, please page me @ 
415.245.0646 or respond privately by e-mail.

Thanks!

Orbital changed my life.  I don't know if it's just because it's what
I was listening to most when my love for music surfaced, but it was
something I loved so much it helped me consider music a career/life plan.
It also opened me up musically.. took me out of a Nine Inch Nails
fetish and let me realize there was so much out there I had never even 
been exposed to.  I moved on to many different types of music, but to
me Orbital will always be awsome.

Just thought I'd mention, since you asked.    8)

Peace,

I don't think I am alone to believe that as far as raves are concerned,
California started off 1997 pretty fukked up.


I myself usually avoid larger parties in SF as they tend to draw somewhat
of a not-so-friendly crowd....=20

But this is New Year's Eve, and I have quite a few friends visiting from
out of state, and they wanted to see a SHOW. So we went to Planet New
Year, put on by Coolworld. When we first got there, it was a zoo! The
line went around the block, and instead of being helpful, the security
did their best to get people to be confused, and it worked. Finally
inside, the party was a lot of fun. After midnight we decided to
re-explore some of the back rooms... It was 12:30 and security was
already blocking off rooms and pushing people towards the front. Then at
around 2am, the lights came on in the main room. Another half hour goes
by, and a shrieky voice <underline>yells </underline>over the pa, "OKAY,
PARTIES OVER!!!, TIME TO GO HOME!!!, LEAVE NOW<< BU-BYE," going on for
about three or four minutes. I am very opposed to violence, but the way
she was starting everyone's New Year, I wouldn't have minded someone get
up there and- nevermind.=20


Anyways, coolworld made up a semi-bullshit story about fire alarms
getting pulled, and having to shut down. I say semi bullshit because I
did see firepeople there, but they were closing down rooms much earlier.
To top it off, they were still selling tickets 20 minutes before this
happened.


I did not see more than most of the booked DJs not only on stage but
anywhere at the party. I believe Coolworld ran out of the DJs they had
actually booked, and scammed the rest of the tickets.


Coolworld is not out to help the "global dance scene," Just to profit
from it.

I just wanted to say a belated thanks to all the people who responded to 
my plea for New Years party information.  Although I never managed to get 
inside, I bought tickets for Metamorphosis . . . !  (Ended up at 1015 and 
then, when that was closed, at the Endup).  Had a great time (even though 
I ended up spending half the money I've been saving to get my wisdom 
teeth out . . . :(

Anyway, I just wanted to say thanks to everyone who tried to help me and 
also to say that the nicest thing I noticed about New Years was that no 
matter how much we were all fucked with, no one seemed to let it dampen 
their spitits.  It was wonderful to see.

Thanks again.

Here is a summary of replies I got to my questions about modern DJ dance 
music and raves in Hawaii:

CLUB RECOMMENDATIONS:

"One club called Rendezvous, sometimes has after hours."

"...as for clubs, there's formula 660, which is the place to be on the 
weekends. and Kids Klub on the first sunday of every month..."

"A couple clubs you should check out are The Jungle and Wave 
Waikiki (both in Waikiki).  Also look up The Groove (located off of 
Nimitz Hwy. in Honolulu) in the phonebook to find out what events 
are happening there!"

RAVE INFORMATION:

"... funk pistol ( clothes and spray can culture store ) closed about a year 
ago. you may want to check out the Radio Free Hawaii page at
http://www.lava.net/radio-free/ "

" (Try calling) RADIO FREE HAWAII (KDEO 102.7FM) at 808-296-1027 they 
can tell you if anything is coming up on the island of Oahu.  Daniel J. 
Ward, the biggest promoter on the island is one of the DJs at the radio 
station so they always have info on his events and most others in the 
studio."

"You can also check out his homepage at:
     http://members.aol.com/wardindus/wardindus.html"

[ to sfraves ]

 As you know or have guessed, my wife Mary and I will be in Hawaii for
a delayed and much anticipated honeymoon! If we happen to go to any
dance clubs or ( may I be so lucky ) an actual "local" rave, I make
a report when we get back. 

 We intend to go without a PowerBook or any other such portable 
computing device w/modem - a REAL vacation!!! I may check in via some
"Internet Cafe" in Honolulu, but I'm not going to get jittery about
not logging in. I guess I'm not geek enough...

 Going to unsub so's my SFRaves email doesn't fill up my mailbox
while I'm gone - so if you guys want to start a flamewar or three or
four - go right ahead! 

 aloha -

This is my belated NYE review.  I've finally had time to digest everything
that occured in order to put it in some sort of literary form!  Actually
this is a really good excuse to once more procrastinate on writing a
Statement of Purpose for graduate school.  My new found ease at
procrastination has become an amazing power!! :P

Like many others, I had tickets to Gateway/Pacific.  I got mine as soon as
I found out about it and could get to the Haight.  Ended up getting
tickets numbered 2,3,4,and 5.  Hmmm....maybe I'm a BIT over-zealous.
Nah!!

I flew home from Tahoe in time to miss the wash out of Reno airport thank
gawd and landed in Oakland on NYE.  I was SOO excited.  Ran a few errands
and bought some stuff for the party, but from then on EVERYTHING fell
apart.  I tried to coordinate five ppl. and it didn't work very well
because everyone had a different idea of what to do.  I ended up hurting
more than one person's feelings and felt pretty damn shitty.  At that
point I decided I hated NYE..  There's too much pressure to have an amazing
time.  But, after shedding some tears at my predicament, we organized a
workable plan.  God only knows how!

Arrived at Gateway at 11:45 only to see it shut down.  I was with Nancy,
and our friends Ivana and Josh.  We were supposed to meet my boyfriend and
another friend later on.  As we were standing in line, we refused to
succumb to that gut feeling of disappointment.  Nancy urged us to try and
make it to the CCC party.  At this point of everything having gone wrong,
the planets aligned for us, and for the rest of the night everything went
PERFECT.  It was amazing.  We made it to the map point RIGHT on time.
Some premonition had made me bring a shit-load of money, so I was able to
foot the bill for everyone.  AND I got paid back. YAY!  Ivana had
impeccable directions and oriented us perfectly in the mired downtown area
of the city.  And Nancy had the brilliant back-up plan and the foresight 
to move on it quickly!  We were so determined to make this happen. I
WANTED it so badly.

We arrived at the smallish space which was covered with black lights and
really amazing flourescent art.  Kudos to the artists, their time and
energy really showed.  There was basically three areas: the stairs (where
it was cooler and you could cool off), the main dance room that was like a
long tunnel with speakers at many different points (where all of the
paintings were), and this darker chill room that had an amazing vibe and
upbeat music.  This room was incredibly packed most of the night, and we
never made it all the way in.  The volume was perfect.  The music was
good, and you could talk.  I don't like chill rooms where the music is so
overwhelmingly loud you can't hear anyone.

The people were really nice.  The crowd was on the older side, but with a
good age distribution.  The people were really colorful and into the
music.  I met a lot of foreigners, reminding me of the international
quality of our scene.  I met one woman from Romania and two from Israel.
One of the women from Israel was visiting and I gave here my phone number
in case she wanted to be shown around the East Bay.  I remember how people
used to do that for me when I was in South America and it felt good to
finally reciprocate the favor!

The most important thing for me at this party was the people who I was
with.  My boyfriend and I have always had a certain strain between us
concerning raving.  It was always me who was interested and not him.  He
never liked it for the longest time and resented the fact that I would do
something like that without him.  Well, our progression with the scene has
been nothing short of amazing.  He made an effort to go over the past
year, and in the process has come to enjoy it.  It has been really fun
watching another person experience a love and confidence with dancing.  I
remember the initial hesitation and embarrassment that turns into sheer
bliss after awhile.  Anyway, every now and then people post stuff about
what to do when your S.O. has a hard time with you raving.  Sometimes it
does have a happy ending :)

Two of the people that were with me are sort of newbies.  They are two of
my friends that somehow "got it."  Isn't that strange?  I've taken a bunch
of people and after that initial time you can tell if they like it or
don't.  It's a strange experience.  But, when they do like it, all of a
sudden they see you differently and you have this new-found understanding
with them.  Bizarre.

In the past six months my partying has severely curtailed for various
reasons.  But, I've already noticed a change in that small amount of time.
It's hard to explain, but I wonder if other people notice it too?  At my
first party (Basics) I remember lots of ppl. giving stuff away.  I
remember really liking that generosity.  At NYE Nancy brought a bunch of
oranges to give away and I brought some suckers and some flourescent
bracelets.  At one point when Nancy was giving oranges away, a young girl
looked at her and said, "Wow. You're old-school aren't you?"  Now I ask
you sfravers what does this mean?  Are people not giving stuff away
anymore?  Is it a fad that has passed?  Was it just the party?  To me
giving stuff away was a part of the community.  You shared what you had in
an effort to bring someone some happiness.  I ended up giving stuff away
and had different reactions.  One guy thought I was picking up on him.
Others were baffled at why I was giving stuff away.  Mostly, people were
grateful and enjoyed it, though.  Has this changed about raving?  Or was
it just this party?  This party had a great vibe, too, so I don't have an
explanation. 

Anyway, sorry for the length of this post.  It has been awhile since I
posted a review!  I did meet Randy and saw the painting he did which was
really nice.  I have to give him props for his humility.  We were talking
about the Harmony 3-Year party and complimented him on his efforts at that
amazing chill room, by far the best one I've ever encountered.  He said,
very humbly, that he owed it all to the space.  I seem to meet a number of
people like this, and I must say that a lack of arrogance is really a
special trait.

to my knowledge the "vs." thing originated in the uk jungle / ragga
scenes (possibly hip-hop too) where dj's would "soundclash"... they
would set up two soundsytems at either end of the room and the dj's
would play in a very literal versus situation... trying to sway the
"crowd" over to their side of the room... the best sound clashes would
obviously be beat mixed to both sides, rather than one massive train
wreck... often this was a competition of sound systems as well as
dj's... i've only seen one soundclash with jungle dj's in london and the
dj that "won" got the most hype from the crowd... as a judge of
technical skill, the guy who won had less technical merit and only won
with his "visual" element through scratching and showboating... tricks
often hide that true lack of technical skill... tag-teaming promotes a
competitiveness that motivates the dj's to show the other one up...
often giving half-assed dj's the gumption to become deck wizards where
they would otherwise simply play tracks with brief windows of mixing
here and there...

First of all, I'd just like to send a big hug out to the list..  I
re-subscribed while I am here for the holidays, and it is great seeing
familiar names, and meeting familiar faces out at parties!

Karma went off last night!  Lots of people, almost too many at one
point...  I loved Ethan's set.. cause he sure knows how to work those
frequencies... he was playing nice melodic stuff too..  Dutch's set was
exactly what I wanted to hear last night (good solid psi trance)..  

The chill room was especially fun.. Who was spinning in there during most
of the evening? Good vibe, though I did see quite a few people bustin out
with large baloons.. Is N2O making a comeback here in SF?

If you were there, I was the tall guy with mid-back length brown hair,
red bikelight, black shirt and pants.  I saw Randy (Happy Birthday!) and a
few other people with SFraves badges on (heya).  

Lots of PLUR,
Aaron.

living in toronto, where there are some mighty big virgin offices
happening, i see a clearer picture of what the "music industry" is doing
to the techno scene...

PLUS 8 records is now being distributed by Virgin, and many of their
artists (plastikman, speedy j, legion of green men) are signed to virgin
with some pretty impressive contracts...

Virgin is now allotting funds for promotion and bought out a prime time
saturday night radio slot on the local commercial dance station Energy
108... we now see huge posters adorning the streets, next to posters
announcing Evita and the next Alanis Morrisette or Green Day concerts
advertising the Transmissions radio show... with dj's such as John
Acquaviva, Terry Mullen, Stacy Pullen, etc, etc...

The show is hosted by MC Flipside... who has no credentials as an MC of
dance music, other than the fact that he graduated from Ryerson
Polytechnic University in the radio broadcasting program...

This raises an interesting point...

what gives a techno producer / promoter / MC / DJ credentials?

being an underground scene, it is hard to develop credible references in
the eyes of the "established"... there are dj's in toronto who sound
like a pair of old army boots in a clothes dryer, but they have the
frequency of public appearance (schmoozing is a disease up here) and
frequency of exposure that would convince record executives that they
have what it takes... FLIPSIDE never MC'd a rave in his life, he's fresh
out of college- and probably makes a nice five digit salary to sample
his voice going t-t-t-t-t-t-t-transmissions! every saturday night...
now he mc's all the commercial parties because he's a radio
personality...

if the underground becomes an industry... because it is established
already in a completely different business format (sort of like how
business is dealt in silicon valleys), it must be made clear to those
intending to boost us into the spotlight for the sake of profit, that
what gets the props is at least GOOD... i think this is why PLUS 8
jumped on the bandwagon when they did... otherwise you might see some
Keoki type cheeseball misrepresenting what techno is all about...
Keoki's rise to fame is within the old rock'n'roll framework... give
yourself an image, big up your ego to "superstar" status and then
promote yourself until you burn out... be the one thing that you can
sell... true techno artists are simply themselves...  i've always seen
this as a revenge of the nerds sort of movement... we who were laughed
at for being individuals in high school, are now producing some of the
best parties and music in the world...

Hi,
I'm wondering where I might find some mixtapes/CDs of Carl Cox.  I understand
that he is a really good DJ from Europe somewhere who mixes several styles
of music in his sets.  I have a hard time listening to 90+minutes of just
house or trance, and am looking for something more eclectic or varied.
Thanks,
Bruce

this whole alcohol versus LSD thing is ridiculous... when you're on
acid, you still have the capacity to be "drunk as a lord"...

i threw a party called bacchus for the autumn equinox 1995... we
advertised it as a wine and cheese event and had a live jazz band
jamming with an acid jazz / trip-hop dj... it was held at a club, and
there were many who ate strange fungus and smoked herb to enjoy the
event... the bar had the HIGHEST alcohol sales EVER in its 20 year
history... and the vibe was amazing... i think the fact that we served
pita with tziki and hummous and trays with 50+ types of cheese and
breads helped soak up what usually turns sour... but alcohol was being
used in its original context... for drinking... not to get drunk... we
even made the bar serve micro-brewery beer and rare import wine...

it is the promotion of alcohol by the mega-breweries to be used in a
consumative manner... drink piss, get pissed... this would disgust most
true alcohol connesseurs...

if you think about hard alcohol, and how it is often referred to as
spirits, we can gain a bit of perspective on this...

much as tequila will make you hallucinate if consumed properly... or
jagermeister with it's 56 herbs (including the opium poppy and elk's
blood)... alcohol can at times appear like the witches brews that are
hunted down by the authorities... of course, jagermeister, as it passes
through canadian border has the elk's blood removed...

although the effects of alcohol are far less subtle, what makes
fermenting barley and hops much different than the fermenting ergot on
rye...

different plants produce different spirits...

be it aminita muscaria, mushrooms, peyote, agave, grapes, potatoes, pot,
tobacco, cloves...

obviously overdosing on any of these does not produce a healthy
experience... if you were to take 20 hits of acid, i don't think you'd
be in any better shape than the drunk under a case of budweiser... not
in the context of a party anyways...

i, in my high school years, was an alcoholic.

when i first tried lsd, alcoholics bothered me...

when i discovered it was because i was one, it took a few trips to
reimprint the alcoholic condition, carefully, so i wouldn't simply
replace one vice with another...

i stopped drinking altogether for 3 years, to make sure... and found my
pious attitude that psychedelics were the end all and be all of mind
altering substances was indicative that i still had a problem i was
clinging to...

alcohol itself is not a problem... it is the lack of awareness in how to
use it that is... much of a psychedelic experience can be meaningful to
the user, and it definitely has its uses in psychotherapy (ie.
overcoming addictions)... but used in a purely recreational experience,
the only difference between the two is that alcohol, when overdone
inflates the ego... lsd dissolves it completely... i personally would
rather risk getting a black eye from speaking out of the pecking order
than imprint my subconscious with a bad mix, gansta punks with attitude
or a police raid... of course, i'd rather not have either... which is
why i limit my lsd use to private sessions or moontribe parties and
stick with my buddy herb and elaine at raves...


drugs are tools. nothing else. use them as such. consciously.

Hi all!  =)

 Well, to help celebrate my B-day (actually on Jan. 3rd) I went out to 
Karma. The party was radically different than the NYE party in the same 
space.

Good points;

 Music was really awesome (dudes). David(?), Ethan, T. Trouble, Dutch and 
Graeme all tore it up and it was _really_ difficult not to dance at 
times! Likewise the chill room had some incredible sounds happening 
thanks primarily to Boomerang Fidget (a wonderfully nice person!) and 
Maya who played two looong sets that had a little bit of everything in 
there all mixed perfectly. 

 The crowd (for the most part) was very friendly. It was _overpacked_ for 
a while but by 2 am or so things thinned out appreciably. Big thanks to 
everyone who wished me a happy B-day! Both there and on this list!!

 Going out to breakfast with Julie, Peter and Graeme at the Bahgdad Cafe. 
These are just some incredible people that I feel very fortunate to have 
met.

 Hi to Julie, Peter, Graeme, Bonnie (from Germany), Leslie, Aaron, Pablo, 
Brendon (?) (thanks for the lift!!), Wayne, Marcy, Martin (and son!) and 
all the other wonderful folks I bumped into!

Not so good points;

 Mr. Trouble has some organizational skills to acquire yet. He didn't 
show at his own party until 10 pm (we were supposed to start at 9:30). He 
also yelled at Leslie when he should not have (very BAD!), and apparently 
didn't pay Maya who played really hard AND brought in his coffin for the 
chill room.

 The bottled water was being sold at $1.50 (once Mr. Trouble took charge) 
and later someone was selling water for $2 a bottle. Ya know those small 
ones.
 
 Hearing that Leslie had her wallet(?) stolen.

 Having the amps shut down as they became overheated (from the large crowd).

 Decorations were essientially non-existant. We were in a dirty warehouse 
and it looked like it.

 Then there were the street toughs trying to peddle their wares along the 
staircase. Really pathetic in it's own little sick way.

 The real heartache (for me) came when I discovered that my banner had 
been tagged. Not once but in three different spots. Luckily the #@%^^& 
punk choose to do it on the painted black areas and will not be hard to 
cover up.




 Despite the drawbacks of the evening I had a great time! The crowd and 
the music were exceptional (for the most part) and I was feeling just 
fine. Brendon was excellent company and I met some very cool people.


Have a great year!!

I just ran across a strange coincidence to what occured
at 7th Heaven on NYE; just saw an announcement about an html
editor named LiquidFX.  Now wasn't that the name of the
orange liquid that got everyone sick at 7th Heaven?

I wonder if the author of the html Editor is aware of the
connection.

having observed mckenna's novelty mailing list over the past month, i've
found much of what psychedelics do is make people fanatical over their
"mystical" experiences...

i've had several "mystical" experiences on psychedelics, many of them
changing the direction i've taken in my life, but mystical experiences
cannot be quantified, hence making them difficult to prove and hence
making them difficult to bring into this plane of reality... we're here
on this "plane" for a reason, and that's not to go somewhere else...
it's to bring several "somewhere elses" together here (i'm starting to
sound like the picard)...

it seems the difference between the trippers and the drinkers (how's
that for quaint little categories?) is that trippers have a tendency to
take each others ideas and push them forward by combining them with and
using them to catalyze their own...

when it comes down to it though, the new age / extraterrestrial-coming-
of-age trip is no more relevant than some drunken assoul spewing forth
existentialist Bukowski kibble in some rat's hole pub...

it's the "Lite" version of metaphysics... it's all just a bunch of
wurds...

timothy leary, who was a Harvard PhD, was thrown out on his ass, because
for all his research and most excellent codification of the psychedelic
experience in the english language, could still not quantify what goes
on...

to fully understand the impact psychedelics could have, and to begin
quantifying their effects, will require the combining of magick (true
empirical occultism, not the mamby-pamby James Redfields), quantum
science, the entire body of Jung's work, and several schools of eastern
meditation / philosophy...

i saw McKenna speak at The Whole Life Expo in Austin Texas, and for the
most part his drug rhetoric went over the heads of the new Age Tammy Fae
Baker Look-Alikes... if we can't describe the experience in words that
the drug-free virgin would understand... how close to the Truth are we?

Don't get me wrong, i wouldn't want to be interpreted as some soul-less
nihilistic materialist... i've explored eastern spiritual paths... i've
noticed the similarities between the Tarot, the i ching and the way DNA
is charted... i can appreciate why shiva has long legs that curl around
like a DNA helix... how the OHM symbol encompasses the original 
 < +  -  mu > of the original symbol of the TAO... and the curved line
and dot above this symbol could be interpreted as being symbolic of wave
and particle theory...

it's taken western science in all it's logic thousands of years to
appreciate what the east knew poetically... but since we have caught up,
we shouldn't let ouselves get lost in the poetics and semantics of it
all...

it comes back to the old psychedelic maxim

   the goal is not to get high... it's to be high!

and in being high, we shouldn't need the drug to produce the affect
anymore... for the effect to truly stick, and not just be a memory of
the original effect, we need to develop a language to bring forth the
new consciousness, if our vocabularies and grammars are limited in this
regard... which is why the DMT entities teach what was once known as
enochian, or to some who feel threatened by it "speaking in tongues"...
techno music (in a purist sense) is the crown acheivement of mankind
because of it's departure from the musical staff and scale... it is an
amorphous manipulation of sound itself, never repeating itself in its
analogue form...  the language we are seeking however, seems to lie
within the mind itself... and all the references to illumination and
being of a "light vibration" seems to point towards to communication
through light... our minds receive it... we haven't developed our
capabilities of sending it...

i don't think we'll reach any state of permanence simply tripping on
this realization.

In toronto, at the Guerilla Gatherings party i played at (w/ Dan
Curtain, Peacefrog Recs.), the DJ at New Year's played Steve Miller's
"Fly Like An Eagle" everyone was too busy hugging, etc to notice and
when they did it was like this big joke... here we are... progressive
minded folk... celebrating this inane holiday based in the gregorian
calendar (with all it's xtian flaws) and listening classic rock...
 oh yeah!


the big commercial party (our equivalent to cool world) lost their space
the week before and kept their semi-legal roller rink space (rammed to
the rafters) quiet until just the last minute, when they released the
info, packed the place in just enough to make their money and when the
cops showed up and told them they could let any more people in
(including those still outside in the multi-hundred person line-up who
had advance tickets) they just smiled smugly and told people "hey what
can we do?" and dipped into the back room to count the door receipts...
since it was a one room roller rink (with an ambient room in the some
out of the way back room) the four rooms as promised on the flyer shrunk
down to three sound systems in the one room... this makes absolutely no
sense... the Destiny Utopia Dose Syrous party didn't have it's shit
together... i guess that's why everyone was calling it D.U.D.S. for
short...

The Guerilla Gathering went off really well... 300 people max... free
vegan buffet... free champange... comfy couches in a lounge... wicked
vibe... well worth the $20 at the door (compared to $45 @ DUDS)
...

can't say much more other than, the UG is alive and well in toronto...

hope it is out there for '97 as well...

it seems police crack downs are immanent everywhere...

toronto just experienced its first big bust in ages...

since, the police have hassled us every weekend...

i was in austin, texas and there were some pretty intense cop politics
happening... including infrared cameras and 20 uniformed officers at a
party!

i heard tales from Goa DJ smiling Bhudda about a party he threw in
Isreal where 4000 ravers showed up in the desert (1% of the Isreali
population om acid!) and the military surrounded the entire area and
busted everyone... they took Smiling Bhudda aside and showed him
pictures of himself at parties, even small UG ones, over the past four
years and basically said "we know who you are... we know what you;ve
done... we know what you do..." and let him go...

in vancouver, there was a major bust of a lab where E, LSD and DMT (most
of the supply for Canada and a good chunk of the US)...

perhaps a mailing list should be started to begin observing the trends
in police infiltration and interference... start our own intelligence
agency... sort of like that Beastie Boys video... "we knew they were
watching us, so we started watching them"... i would bet there are some
interesting patterns that might arise... i don't know what happened in
austin, but there was some really pure E in the area at the time... and
the heat came down the same week that the vancouver lab went down...
double sting?... who backs the cops... is it the concerned moral
majority... or is it the same mob creeps that seek to profit on the E
market by cutting it with additive substances (crystal meth, synthetic
heroin, cocaine) or just plain crap (ketamine, GHB, PCP)... did this
same shit not happen in the late 60's early 70's... Cherry Bomb FX, Red
Rockets, Reds, Blues, Ludes, Barbs, Yellow Jackets... get the picture...
most of our "E" isn't even called "E" anymore, let alone MDMA... we have
no clue of what type of intelligence is being gathered on us... why
shouldn't we generate some awareness into this issue...
    just a thought... it might be a fun hobby for those not involved in
the drug trade... i don't care if i'm being watched... i haven't
possessed drugs with the exception of them being ingested for over two
years... i'm on the McKenna mailing list anyways, so it's too late for
that!
     it's time we take control... support free markets... vote with your
dollars... don't vote for crap!

in Paris, there was a t one time rave's in the storm sewers of the
city... they would go into the older sectors and set up systems and
generators... 

sort of like, the teenage mutant ninja turtle...

watch out for flash floods...

i guess that could be a faux pas considering what's going on out west
right now...

when cops from both sides came in running and TACKLED some 'innocent' guy 
simply watching....

beating this poor guy that "IT WASN'T HIM"  and they didn't stop<-----

	swing of the baton to the last kick and cuffing.

I know this probably won't help, but here goes...

I'm moving to SF next weekend (yeah!!!) and I need to get out of my lease 
in (gulp) Livermore.  If you happen to know someone who's situation is 
complimentary to mine, send me mail.  Thanks!

We have a very special Mad this week, with Mark Broom from Pure Plastic
records in the UK spinning his only SF gig along with a set from Mixmaster
Morris as well. Alas, due to the extra expense we're forced to suspend our
$2 before 11pm policy just for this week - it'll be $3 all night, which is
still a pretty good deal.

Thanks for your support in '96 - we're looking forward to bringing you even
more madness in '97!

1/6

DJs:

Mark Broom (UK)
Mixmaster Morris (UK)
Sho

at Bahia Cabana - 1600 Market @ Franklin

18+ w/ID $3

Coming up:

2/17: DJ T-1000 (Generator/Pure Sonik, Detroit)

Liquid,

How come you are not looking for the a**h*** who threw the bottle in the 
first place.... ??

The cops might have been wrong in what they did but on the other hand 
put yourself in their place. How would you enjoy having bottles thrown 
at you for doing your job ?

I am not saying what they did is right ... all I am saying is that this 
was brought about by one of "us" (and I am using this term in a very 
broad sense) ... they didnt just start beating up a guy cause they felt 
like it - they did in response to what somebody in the crowd did.

Some cops are corrupt but not all of them should be placed in that 
category, because what some of them do. I specially do NOT like the use 
of the term "pig" when refering to them. most of them are just doing 
what they have been ordered to do and they have to face more pressure in 
their jobs than most of us face in life. and sometimes they get carried 
away ... shit happens. 

Flame away ...

Rudi

Yes, I agree, they were just doing their jobs, *BUT*, if I were a riot
cop and had a bottle thrown at me, I'd make sure that I had the RIGHT
PERSON first.  Plus, as every job sucks in one way or another, it's
wrong to beat the hell out of him.  Arrest him, restrain him ONLY as
much as they'd need to, but to take out personal anger on him via
violence is just purely wrong.  That's my opinion, anyway.

     please take this with an open mind...
     
     you guys don't have to  be so afraid of the cops.  fear is negative 
     energy.  when we pay attention to it too much, we attract it.  i'm not 
     saying ignore what they did, let's just make sure when we do handle it 
     it is in a positive manner so we can start attracting positive energy, 
     and the positve people (cops) too.  
     
     come on SFravers.  i know you can do it.  i have total trust and faith 
     in you.  i know who you are, and you do too. step up.  =+)

it seems police crack downs are immanent everywhere...
     
toronto just experienced its first big bust in ages...
     
since, the police have hassled us every weekend...
     
i was in austin, texas and there were some pretty intense cop politics 
happening... including infrared cameras and 20 uniformed officers at a 
party!
     
i heard tales from Goa DJ smiling Bhudda about a party he threw in 
Isreal where 4000 ravers showed up in the desert (1% of the Isreali 
population om acid!) and the military surrounded the entire area and 
busted everyone... they took Smiling Bhudda aside and showed him 
pictures of himself at parties, even small UG ones, over the past four 
years and basically said "we know who you are... we know what you;ve 
done... we know what you do..." and let him go...
     
in vancouver, there was a major bust of a lab where E, LSD and DMT (most 
of the supply for Canada and a good chunk of the US)...
     
perhaps a mailing list should be started to begin observing the trends in 
police infiltration and interference... start our own intelligence 
agency... sort of like that Beastie Boys video... "we knew they were 
watching us, so we started watching them"... i would bet there are some 
interesting patterns that might arise... i don't know what happened in 
austin, but there was some really pure E in the area at the time... and 
the heat came down the same week that the vancouver lab went down... 
double sting?... who backs the cops... is it the concerned moral 
majority... or is it the same mob creeps that seek to profit on the E 
market by cutting it with additive substances (crystal meth, synthetic 
heroin, cocaine) or just plain crap (ketamine, GHB, PCP)... did this same 
shit not happen in the late 60's early 70's... Cherry Bomb FX, Red 
Rockets, Reds, Blues, Ludes, Barbs, Yellow Jackets... get the picture... 
most of our "E" isn't even called "E" anymore, let alone MDMA... we have 
no clue of what type of intelligence is being gathered on us... why 
shouldn't we generate some awareness into this issue...
    just a thought... it might be a fun hobby for those not involved in
the drug trade... i don't care if i'm being watched... i haven't 
possessed drugs with the exception of them being ingested for over two 
years... i'm on the McKenna mailing list anyways, so it's too late for 
that!
     it's time we take control... support free markets... vote with your
dollars... don't vote for crap!

Hi,
	just my opinion, but it sounds like your shoes are causing static
build up on your body. the only two ways to deal with this ( that I can   think of right now) is to use leather soled shoes or anti static traps    that i use at my job. any other suggestions out there?

this sounds weird, but it actually works!! Get a bottle of Downey, the 
fabric softner.  Put it in a spray bottle and spray it all over the 
floor.

Forum Highlights:
 ----------------

The art/technology relationship is one that emerged with photography,
and
burst out with electronic imaging.

*Mary Steiglitz* will present a survey, "The Camera is not a Mirror," of
the history of visual imaging. It will question the notion of 'realism'
connected with photographic images. She will show the links of
photography
to art, and the current transformation of visual imaging by the
computer.
Steiglitz is professor of art at the University of Idaho, and is an
artist/photographer who has exhibited and published widely.

_Cacophony Drive-In Movie Short Film/Video Festival._ excerpts. *Dave
Krzysik,* is the festival's impresario and editor of this video sampler.
He
will chat about the project as well as Cacophony's next event, the
Brainwash Movie Festival.

*Helen Golden* has worked in photography, drawing and sculpture, always
with the same goals in mind: to create art that would in its ambiguous
reality, engage, provoke and cause the viewer to reflect and wonder.
She is captivated with new technologies and will describe things she
could
not even have dreamed of doing before that are now possible, making this
the most exciting time in her life as an artist.

*Alex and Martha Nicoloff* fabricate their own plastic prisms, and
record
them as they dance in a focussed ray of pure sunlight. Using solar
spectrum illumination, they produce myriad effects synchronized with
unusual music. Their videos have won NEA awards. We will see _The Eye of
the Deity._ Alex describes its themes: "For the reason that it is rarely
attempted, we have chosen to show an interpretative documentary of an
artistic tradition in two Asian cultures. One is the masked identity of
Rangda, a wicked witch often seen in Balinese dances. The other is the
meditative image of a Khmer Boddhisatva dating to the 12th century."

Hello and welcome to your life...


Friday:  
Since nothing was happenin' this Friday I thought "screw it" and tried
to throw together a get together so we could all be together...  A lot
of interest was in the air, but the location was nil until Foster sent
me a message about an east bay local.  Unfortunatlley I lost his VM#
(Duhh..).  So I was about to start my own party (consisting of me, me,
and me) in my garage, that's when I gota page from some fellow SFR's and
off to SJ to have a party...
Set up, 420'ed, and spun for a while (oh, about 4hrs or so). Didn't do
too much chatting, since being faded and mixing can be quite a challenge
(sorry for the misbeats everyone).. @ max I think there was
fifteen-or-so people. Which, wasn't too bad for a last minute notice,
and promising for whatever future events there may me.   Deepfog dropped
by around 4'ish and spun some decent house jams intill six and I came
back on till about 7:30 and then CDin it till 9ish...

Saturday:  _Karma 'n' GT_

Got there about 11ish. Place was PACKED (I guess this is what happens
when there's only one event in town...) .  A little dark for my tastes
but chatting w/Thomas I found he lent Galen some lights which he was
waiting for to set up, guess they never got here.  Vibe was allright but
somewhat hot'n'muggy.  Danced HARD to Ethans set, missed Thomas T's (had
to chill in the ambient area).  Helped some poor gal down the very
crowded stairwell (looks like she combined something with something
else, tsk).  Chatted w/a few in the chill room.  The sound went out @
3or so due to the heat... But came back on with a more Goa-type flavour.
 Really Didn't like the high visibility drug scene (Nitrous, E, Acid,
GHB offered to me all within 30mins.).  Esp. when most of the peddeling
was in the stairwell (I think I spent 20min. just trying to get up the
stairs).   But despite thoese minor peeves, it was a very nice event.
Nice enough for them to throw it again next week, at least...

Hello everyone,

	I am not sure if the last post got posted cause I have been moving, so
here it is. If you want a Family ticket, I will be at MAD tonight. Tickets
are $10 and the party is on the 18th of Jan. If there are still some left
after tonight, we will arrange the next ticket location. But try to come
tonight cause there aren't that many of them. Hope to see you soon!

Peace and love,

Greg =)

Hi Everbody,

Hope you are all having a happy safe day? Me im at work :-( but that is ok It
pays the bills. :-) im just writing to let you all know that there will be a
small party put on by US eternal ent. the party is called ODYSSEY this will be
our first event in hopefully a series of small partys that we would like to
bring to all of you. A little about us we all started out as party goers and
continue to do just that. We just wanted to do something and give back to the
scene what we have learned and experienced. This will be a small event with a
limited capacity of 500. We are trying to keep it small and simple a lot of
people assume that the scene is dead and say "we need to take back our scene"
the scene was never gone just more "under ground" we want to continue with that
by keeping it small and simple. The DJ line up is Donald Glaude, Charlotte,
Alika (hawaii) DJ kexa (eternal ent.) moshe (meridian\2chakra) and others TBA.
we would like to create a specialized mail list for persons so if you would
like to get on the list please E-mail me personally so I can contact you myself
to confirm the info. oh yea I almost forgot the date DUH.. it is Saturday Feb
1.
There will not be that many flyers put out we would like to keep this word of
mouth and internet only.

PLUR :-)  *hugz and kisses* to all..

They should call it 'The Church of Taj'

    Taj spun some really deep house for like two and a half hours. Must
hear.
    Great vibes all night. There were only three drunk fools gallaping
around, left before anyone new it.
  E-Mail is the shit. If you know what I am talking about. Get some.
  I danced all night long. 
 Everybody better go next 1st Friday or I will be pissed!

Ok?
Thanx
Jeff

FYI - this is a review of the physical space, not the party that was in the
space. I have a feeling that the following comments will unfortunately
apply to any party held at that location.

First, it reminds me of all the dangerous parts of ACME on Howard Street
but without the any of ACME's "old brick warehouse" charm.

there were way too many people

there was *no* air flow detected (actually there was, but it was not adequate)

it was humid beyond belief

it felt like the floor was going to cave in at the chill room level with
even a few people dancing in there. This is no joke -- it was sagging to
the dancers dancing to the beat. I left that room because I honestly feared
death was approaching

there is exposed electrical wiring

and there's only one exit down the only *and always* crowded stairwell

in summary: this 'death trap' scares me more than ACME ever did.

yes they 'were' doing thier job, but they were beating the wrong guy.  
that guy could have been me, i was right there too.  there is little or 
no way of catching the person who DID throw the bottle, but there might 
be a way of reaching the victim.

youre dam right it WASN'T RIGHT, the cops as well as the security were 
sick of the people throwing shit at them and their equipment (id be too) 
and were looking for someone to take the blow for it.

exactly

i agree, there are many police officers who are out there to serve the 
people, and 'help' us, BUT
there are many out there that DO take the law further than it needs to be 
taken.

> most of them are just doing what they have been ordered to do and they 

this is true, but their superior did not ORDER them to take down one 
person for the misbehavior of many.   no one TOLD them (all four of them) 
to take that 'one' guy down with EXECESSIVE violence.  

> Flame away ...

dont look at this like a flame, or a hate message.  thats the ONE thing i 
absolutely hate about this list, people ALWAYS ready to pick a fight...

thankx for your post, i'd really like to catch the guy who got the other 
victim's face busted up, but id rather help the guy hurt than go pick 
another fight.

        Cool World being what it is, it's entirely possible that the
person who got beaten has little or no connection to the rave
community. I strongly reccomend that you get this tape out to
the news media if you don't find this person through other means
fairly quickly.

	One of the main reasons cops often act this way is because
they usually have no problem getting away with it. The prevalence
of video equipment may change that. I think you owe it to the
larger community to get this out somehow, regardless. Please don't
just sit on it.

hi all:

as we struggle to get more publicity for our small but growing site, we look
to our friends for support...

we'd like to have the connections and the money to get articles written in
the major on-line publications, but unfortunately, we don't.  instead, we're
asking you to go vote for our site at Starting Point.  the url is:

http://www.stpt.com/entrtain/entrtainNEW.html

hopefully, this will be the start of some positive media energy...

thanks much!
pauly

p.s., i've added some more jungle and dub titles -- look for the entire LTJ
Bukem cd, His Majesty's Dub, Orbital Diversions, and a few more titles that
i can't quite remember.  remember, we've got entire CD's on-line, not just a
sample...

Well I got there right when the party started.  It wasn't crowed, at first,
then by 12:00 or so, I was like where did all of these people come from??? 
Yeah they oversold tix, which wasn't supposed to happen.  It was an ok
party not great not bad just ok.  I didn't get to dance much because I
ended up getting too involved with people passing out and then the pepper
spray innocident.  I met a lot of new people as usual, and saw some people
from the list.  But over all it was a good party.  I'm looking forward to
the weekend as usual, but I may or may not have blow pops =(  I know most
of you will be upset, but I have way too many bills to pay, so I am going
to parties still, but I may not have blow pops.  Again I am sorry for that.
 Hope to see most of you this weekend.
Eric
(250 blow pop boy)

P.S.
Happy Jonathon?????   =)

In a message dated 97-01-06 17:10:42 EST, you write:

<< 
 FYI - this is a review of the physical space, not the party that was in the
 space. I have a feeling that the following comments will unfortunately
 apply to any party held at that location.
 
 First, it reminds me of all the dangerous parts of ACME on Howard Street
 but without the any of ACME's "old brick warehouse" charm.
 
 there were way too many people
 
 there was *no* air flow detected (actually there was, but it was not
adequate)
 
 it was humid beyond belief
 
 it felt like the floor was going to cave in at the chill room level with
 even a few people dancing in there. This is no joke -- it was sagging to
 the dancers dancing to the beat. I left that room because I honestly feared
 death was approaching
 
 there is exposed electrical wiring
 
 and there's only one exit down the only *and always* crowded stairwell
 
 in summary: this 'death trap' scares me more than ACME ever did.
  >>
I fully agree with Wayne... I was there before the party started and I stood
in the stairwell giving flyers... Slowly, the place started to fill up..
people just kept coming and coming and coming.... It was soo packed I didn't
even go into the large room... I decided to actually exit the building when
you could barely stand in the stairwell... I was outside when i noticed that
the actual building was shaking! The shadows of the bars moved back in forth!
it was amazing and SCARY! I told people as they entered... remember where
this door is, cause if something happens, its the only way out!! That party
was NOT cool... Thomas came out a few times and yelled at the guys, saying no
more people, its insane! They closed the map point early but people where
still coming! The security dude, was letting people in without tickets...He
didn't seem to bright..... Anyway.. that location is a severe deathtrap! BTW
people are lucky their cars didn't get towed! That was a federal building
across the street, and you can't park within 100 hundred feet of it!! This
location needs to be boycotted..

Hold on there, who is to say the news media will persent it as such?
Beatings by Cops is kinda old hat as far a ratings goes. But what about
beatings at a rave? I wouldn't recomend sending this tape to the news
media for fear of what they may turn it into. "Cops clash with youth at
a Rave party. News at 11"

I have to concur with the sentiments regarding this location.  I tried my 
best to put it out of my mind on NYE, but I definitely felt unsafe.  I 
couldn't even stay in the chill room (even though I really wanted to) 
because the way the floor kept sagging under the crowd was too frightening.

I dislike complaining about locations because I know how difficult it is 
for promoters to find them... But, as I wrote before, here's an instance 
where the fire and safety code is right on.  It is too fucking dangerous 
to have a party there.

Also, considering how packed it was NYE and on Saturday night (two 
relatively "small" events), I think our scene may have outgrown this 
space.  It accomodates maybe 300 people (and how many safely?), and 
obviously our family is WAY bigger than that!  _Maybe_ this location 
would be allright for the smallest parties, with truly limited (pre-sale 
only?) tix.

Because there's nothing they can do about it, whereas there is something
they _can_ do for the other guy?

 I remember one night in HighSchool. I was at a party which (ofcourse) got
out of hand. People were running up and down the streets trying to figure
out why everybody was running up and down the streets.
 Us being the rebels n all, were walking in the middle of the street.
 I see a cop walking on the sidewalk, and I say "cop" because my friend Jay
had a beer in his hand. Not knowing where the cop was, Jay quickly hucks
his beer. But he throws it right at the cops feet.  It was pretty
halarious.


Guess you had to be there.

Liquid,

I must say your response seemed more level headed than the original post 
you put up... :-) I'm glad some of us on here are not totally brain dead 
... I also agree that you should try to get the tape out as Rob Rayle 
suggested.

But then it might not do anybody any good because the media might not 
even give it a second look... still it wont cost you anything to try...

I was being sarcastic when i suggested flame away ... i do that 
sometimes ;-)

My humble US$0.02 ...

Rudi

Sorry for my second nrr post but I received no responses from the last
request...

I need to do an interview (short and can even be done over e-mail) with
someone in the computer industry preferably in the client-server niche in a
management position but its not a requirement...Anyway I will gladly buy
lunch or dinner or whatever for someone who helps me out with this school
project.  Below are a couple example questions:

What are the key success factors in the industry?  Something that any
competitor must do well to succeed in this industry?  Why are they
important?  What are some examples?

How should a company best address these key success factors and move
forward in the industry?


Theres a total of 15 questions so it wouldn't take long to answer.

Thanks much,

First, I just want to say I hope everyones holidays were a good one and
everyone is safe and sound.

Well, I've been talking about it, so now is the time to start taking
action. BBQ & BEATS Campout. The 1 Year Anniversary is coming up and I
would like to plan a campout for June 6th and 7th. I'm planning on it to
start on Saturday June 6th around Noonish and run until late afternoon on
Sunday June 7th. I'm trying to have this be a $5-$10 party just to cover
cost. I'd like to get as much as I can  donated and volunteered as I can to
keep the price down and the vibe up. So if your interested in helping out
and want to help plan for this, please let me know privately.

Nothing is set in stone at this time, I just thought it would be good to
get this all planned out early to avoid any hassles later.

A also want to thank everyone that has came out as well as helped in the
past and supported these events. There are very special to me and I have
had a blast throwing them for you. So let's make this one the best ever.

As far as DJs go, if your interested and would like to be considered and
don't mind volunteering your time spinning your favorite toons and have a
demo tape you can get to me to checkout that would be great. If I've heard
you spin before, then the demo tape would not be needed unless you just
want to give me one anyways.

Just want to say to everyone, Thanks for all your support and lets make
this a camping trip we all will never forget.

Tim (knucklehead)


P.S.  For all those that keep asking, YES, I will spin at this one. 8)

Call me cynical, nay even jaded, but I can't help feeling that the people
who went to this one, and probably the Oragin one as well, were all 
victims of one of the biggest scams in recent Bay Area rave history.
Here's how it works: You do get the permits, and then take them along to
an inssurance company and insure the rave (to cover you for loss/damage of
equipment, contracted dj's not showing up, etc, etc); but this also covers
you for the termination of the party.  So at 8.00 when the fire marshall
comes to inspect the venue it is legal but by 12.00 they have removed a
fire exit and they are no longer legal.  One quick call later from a
"complaining neighour" and the cops are shutting it down because of fire
exit issue.  The organizers then clean up twice: firstly from pre-sale and
early evening ticket sales; and secondily, when they got inssurance they
estimated there toal capacity and mutiplyed that with the price for one
ticket ($30) and inssured themselves against falling below capcity.
Because the rave was officially caceled, they officially got inssurance
money back to live up to there legal responsibility to refund the
customers money.  But they did not directly sell the tickets to the
public, record shops did, and they are under no legal obligation to refund
anybody anything.  Thus, the promoters sell-out and get an additional 50%
(aprox) back from the inssurance factor.  After slipping a few scheckels
to helful parties, they then laugh all the way to the bank with a HUGE
sum of money.
Maybe I am going a bit over the top but one fact does remain: no-one is
stupid enough to organize a rave like cool world to have it shut down by
1.00am.  if this had been in England the ravers would have faught with the
riot cops and the promoters would be found and all given chelsea smiles
(which is where one takes a knife and slits a persons face from mouth to
ear) so that for the rest of the life they would all be seen to be liars
and thieves.  These people committed one of the worse crimes going: that
of profiting out of others good-will and for that they should be run out
of town.
I, myself spent new years eve at several large illegal parties that were
all free and not one of them got busted.
Have a happy 97!
Tristan.

We were really treated to some of the best music last
night.... Mixmaster Morris was incredible! He spun jungle that I had
never heard before in my life (some of it even approached really good
experimental jazz), and created a set that I can only describe as an
intricate collage of music. Mark Broom came on afterwards and proceded
to play techno (I suppose it was UK techno) that *killed*
me... Between the two of them, I was fully destroyed by the end of the
night.

I hate to say it, but anyone who missed Mad last night missed some of
the best music and dancing that I've experience in a _long_ time... Even
my grump old raver friends were buggin' out. :)

This Thursday Night
join a group of new friends
for booze and beats... :)

Boozin' Ravers
the Socially Conscious first edition!

This Thursday Night is the benefit party ($5) for Food Not Bombs 
at Caeser's Palace at 26th/Mission (DRC and Pollywog!! plus others!)
I would love for us to support this worthy cause... and hopefully 
contribute a large crowd!!

So, I thought we could get together early-ish at a bar in the Mission, 
then migrate over to the party around 10 (it's scheduled for 7PM-3AM).  
Only thing is, I'm not too familiar with bars in the Mission so send me 
some suggestions!   The Makeout Room is a comfortable place to hangout... 
I think it's on 22nd/Valencia.

Please drop me a line if you think you'll stop by.  Also, I'll be 
driving from Berkeley and would really appreciate giving someone a 
ride... parking and walking by myself at night is not too appealing!

Looking forward to
meeting more of you!!

Love,
Nancy

     you ravers have ABSOLUTELY no idea what I have in store for you in the 
     next 5 years...but all i can tell you is there will be an alternative 
     to the current raving situation.  Can you imagine not having to worry 
     about renting spaces?  hang in there, folx.  by the way, my hats off 
     to pacific/gateway and others that meant well on new years.  i've

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

The "One Tribe" benefit concert to save the rainforest involves more than 
just music from some incredible local talents. Organizers are employing 
the innovative new-media techniques to bring the tropics to life during 
the performances.

There is irony in using technology to slow the trampling  foot of the 
progress. Yet, what better to communicate the urgent need to save the 
world's rainforests than through the use of multimedia tools and the 
World Wide Web? Technology brings people closer together to find common 
solutions for the environment. 

"One Tribe" will be held Jan. 26th at the Maritime Hall in San Francisco. 
Music, dancing and multimedia shows will go from 8 p.m. to 1 a.m. The 
concert features well-known Bay Area bands Soulstice, Jamalski and 
Neomythic. Terra Deva will serve as emcee; and Mei-Lwun (BCE) will deejay.

The benefit will include an Academy Award-nominated film short on the 
rainforest. CCSI-Entersol Inc., an Internet company, will provide some 
stunning high-tech visuals; featuring a new digital art form of 
expression called "Xfrasis" visual poetry. (Samples of the event Xfrasis 
can be downloaded from www.entresol.com.)

The purpose of the concert is to raise awareness and money for a 
rainforest tribe known as the Ashuar people, an indigenous nation of 3000 
who live on 1.5 million acres of the world's most ecologically diverse 
regions. The area in the Amazon basin of southeastern Ecuador can only be 
accessed by small planes landing on dirt runways cleared out of the 
jungle. This remoteness has been a blessing in that no mining, lumber or 
mineral interests have encroached on the Achuar ancestral land, But that 
is changing.

Your support can help in preserving the Achuar traditional land and their 
way of life.
Human/Nature International, a U.S. non-profit group, is working to first 
to help the Achuar maintain their land. Second Human/Nature is developing 
a long-term plan to halt the destruction  of the Earth's rainforest,  to 
find ways in which ancient indigenous cultures can co-exist with the 
modern world.

Tickets for the concert are $10 and may be purchased at the Maritime 
Hall, 450 Harrison St. For ticket information please contact Maritime 
Hall (4150 974-0634 or 974-0633. For more information for the event, 
please call Danah at (415) 648-8219, fax: (415) 386-0588 or email: 
haidai@ccsource-inc.com. If you would like more information about the 
cause, please contact Bill Twist at (415) 616-7353 or email to:

wats up!


My friend and I will be getting together wednesday evening at about 6 pm.
I have brought my equipment down to PACHECO ( next to Martinez and
Concord). If you live in that area  and are interested in getting together,
e-mail me and maybe we can get together and listen to each other's music,
and maybe later on in the month throw a party or something. Bring your drum
machine, records and some good crack!

Late!

Pete

 If some English barbarian gave me one of these chelsea's. I would cut his
stinking hands off. Just kidding. Actually, I would probably just start
wearing some kinna mask to cover up my uglyness and gallup around England
saving all the liers and theives from you vandalizing demons.
 Only my God in heaven has the right to change my apperance.
 I would like to think that us ravErs here in the USofA have a more
advanced way of getting back at cheaters and theives. "No more support"
 I would bet cha, that Tristan has lied. Cheated. And probably even stolen
something from one of her own flesh and blood relatives somewhere in her
past. And for that. She should of spent all of her life growing up, looking
like the Joker on Batman.
  I myself, do not lie or cheat. But I do remember back in the seventh
grade or so. I spent fifth period, drawing a picture of the teacher
attached to a fat naked body. The teacher found it and suspended me for the
rest of the week. When my Dad saw the picture, he laughed. But when he
asked me if I did it, I said NO. Which I feel really stupid for doing, he
probably would of been proud of me. But hey... I still got my good looks.

Hey. A while back I mentioned that anyone who is interested can come work 
at KZSU and get a radio show. Once a quarter, we have an organizational 
meeting where people can come find out about the station, meet the 
department heads, apply for the dj training class, and get involved.

The meeting for this quarter is tomorrow (Wednesday) at 7:30. It's being 
held on the Stanford Campus in the main quad building. Specifically, 
we're meeting in History Corner, room 2 (downstairs). For anyone who has 
access to a web browser, here's the map URL:

	http://www-pcd.stanford.edu/cgi-bin/map/map.html?history

If you're interested in becoming a dj, learning a lot about music, or 
getting your own radio show, come check us out.

The three places I shop in SF, based on selection and price are...

Zebra Records on Haight St
Leo's Pro Audio on Van Ness (there's also one in Oakland)
Guitar Center on Mission

There are plenty of other places, I have found these places to be the most
reliable and/or to give the best prices.

  I think preying on the good faith of thousands of happy raving people 
does irreperable damage to our scene.  It doesn't take too many experiences
 like that to cause people to build psychological walls, and distrust of 
others, and so on.  And especially on acid or e.  A lot of those people
were probably at their first rave.  While I don't know the whole story,
it is a fact that Cool (Cruel) World lied about some of the acts, as documented
in previous posts.  And as a zen master would say, the big truths are reflected
in the small details.  Those promoters obviously didn't have any integrity,
and I think it's probably true that they were out for a quick buck, fuck
everyone else.  They probably won't get chelseas but the karma sown will make
for a life (several perhaps) that I wouldn't care to live.   :))

It is important to remember this when in a couple of months, all the
people say "Cool World isn't so bad let them throw their party, leave them
alone." Face it people who buy into this, you are *suckers* 

I wish I could say that I don't believe people could be so stupid or
ignorant as to let themselves get fucked over and over by these
sheisters, but the gullability of the human race has never suprised me.

*wake up people*

Tristan, I work in the insurance business. There is no such thing as a policy
that insures a promoter for loss of revenue due to the situations that you
mentioned. If such a policy does exist, it would cost the promoter well over
$125,000.00 to activate one. I've never seen a "party protection" clause in a
"one off" policy. =) MODA

Hi All,

Just wanted to let you know that Soapbox Dec 1996 is posted, featuring 
music by Steve Cooley and James Furey (and, of course, the "OrbiLamp").  
This is definitely a high-bandwidth issue, so take a few slacker moments 
at work to check it out :-)

peace

deeje


P.S. Got a song or two that you'd like to share with the wired community? 
 I'd be happy to host it for you in an upcoming issue.  I hear RealAudio 
in my future, too.

Unless, of course, we're asking them to change their dirty socks, then we
are doing them a favor...

that's all that is is a quote, as opposed to the truth.  Is parroting learned
behaviour (for example: Child abuse) the same as living true to yourself
(like Dancing for the love of it, or climbing Mt. Everest)??  Asking someone
to change learned behaviour, is just asking them to learn new behaviour to 
replace it (like recycling instead of littering, that sort of thing).
my 2cents.

Subject: Cannabis Buyers Club Injunction Lifted

[Cool. From KPIX Newswire -R]

A San Francisco Superior Court judge told a packed courtroom today
that he was giving state voters the benefit of the doubt on medical
marijuana.

Judge David A. Garcia, in modifying a temporary injunction that
shut down the San Francisco Cannabis Buyers Club last year, said, "I
don't think you or I are going to say that the people of California
were totally ineffectual in trying to pass a medical marijuana law."
Garcia was declining to go along with the attorney general's
request to rule that the club could not re-open because it was not a
primary caregiver as required by the law.

State voters passed Proposition 215 in November, authorizing the
cultivation and distribution of marijuana for medicinal purposes.
But Garcia warned that the club had to operate without making a
profit or it would be in violation of the law.

How many ravers does it take to put up a tarp?



No help from the peanut gallery either. You know who you are!

  I understand that this is a delicate situation, but I would like to offer
the concept that people can change. I have done some kinda screwed up stuff
in my time and I would never indicate to anyone that it was okay. However,
I have paid my karmic debts and changed my evil ways into a positive
energy, which I really try to share with others. It's not easy to do here
in the midwest (I can't wait to get out there to the bay area!), but
none-the-less, I smile at people, treat them courteously and try to take
the negatives and turn them into something good. So, they look at me wierd
and think that there must be something wrong with me to be so happy. That's
their problem. ;)
  I know credibility and trust are hard to regain when someone loses them,
but it's only fair to consider that people can make a difference and
improve upon themselves, wherever they stand. Consider the following
scenario: Here in Chicago, just a few weeks ago. "ascii" who has always
thrown reliable and fun partys, was throwing "elemental2". Due to no fault
of theirs, Chicago's finest showed up and closed the thing down around
1:30a. Now, they have a bad reputation with a bunch of folks and they
didn't even do anything wrong. It's hard enough to maintain a positive
image without being damned for an eternity, because you slipped up. I guess
what I'm trying to say is that we can't support "evil" promoters (agreed),
but there should be a point in time, IMO, when you give somebody another
chance. :)
  Maybe I don't know enough about the situation and should not have made
this post?  Oh well...it was made with good intentions, anyhoo...

This is not original, nor is it new, nor is this the only place you can
find it, but it IS a raver light bulb joke... Hmmm, I think I'll just post
the first part and see if anyone else (I'm sure) knows the punch line. If
not, I'll post it l8r. ;) This just came across mw-raves and the poster got
slightly flamed for putting it up. Sooo, I am trying to avoid that. :P

How many ravers does it take to screw in a light bulb?

Hmmm, I just made up a different punchline for the rave mail lists (hope
it's funny):

1001, 100 to preview and speculate about it, 800 to wait in-line and then
stand around and watch, 1 person who actually does it (must be the dj), and
100 more to review it when it's over and comment on the vibe.

P.S. Yes, all of u sfraves peeps will be seeing more posts from me, I will
try to keep it under 5 a week :)

HeyThere kexa! ;)
  hyperreal.com was unavilable for a few hours today, about the time of
your post, hmmm. I have not tried again, so I don't know if it's back up,
but I tried the generic telnet port as well as "7283" and neither brought
about a response. So, it wasn't your imagination. I have a sneaky suspicion
that naas had something to do with it. ;)

P.S. Have u gotten any word from the hive mind guys about INFINITE in
Arkansas? (please reply private, if so)


I'm smiling because I don't understand myself. :)

Can anyone give me a little insight on what Hormony is planning next?  I 
heard something about a party on the 18 but I have been out of town for a 
while and am a bit disconnected.  Any info is grandly appretiated.

Q: How many ravers does it take to screw in a lightbulb?
A: Probably only a couple of hundred, but Hard Copy will say thousands...

Q: How many raves does it take to screw in a lightbulb?
A: None!  Screwing has not place in the scene!  You have no PLUR if you're
screwing, lightbulb or not!

"OrbiLamp" (a brilliant idea!), please keep in mind to twist open the
bottle and leave the cap at least partly unscrewed.  Otherwise your
poor-man's lava lamp will become a poor man's super soaker -- the heat
from the lights in the cup will eventually heat up the drink, increasing
the pressure in the bottle to the point of explosion.  At best the cap
will blow off, the liquid will jet out, and you'll have an electrical
hazard as well as little gummy things on your ceiling...

Hi All,

I accidently deleted the (full) description of the Digital Be-In that 
Wayne posted here a few days earlier. If there's someone out there who 
still has it, could you please forward a copy to me?

Many thanks,
Kathryn

Come-Unity was last week as far as I know. The first Wed. of the month,
which was 1/1. I didn't go, but I talked to people that did, so I think it
happened then.

TT keeps saying this (limited, keep the crowd down, can't overdo it) but
for the last few parties it just hasn't seemed to take effect...hence the
Galatic Sweatlodge.  I'll probably go anyway (gotta hear Theta), but
frankly I haven't much faith in the limit.

Hi all!  ]=)

 I'm just so happy and I need to share this vibe with someone!

 For those who don't know I'm a student at the University of California 
in Santa Cruz (USA). Our quarter just started here. I've been shopping 
for classes and one class I signed up for was a class called "What Is 
Dance". I thought this would be good for me as a multi-media design 
artist; you know learn some basic things about dance, what it looks like, 
what you can do with it. I also expected it to be mostly lecture.

WRONG!!! This class (taught by Tandy Beal) is about MOVING! Not only do 
we see videos and get (minimal) lectures on dance but we MOVE! We DANCE! 
And oh my goodness have I been getting high on the stuff! YIKES!!!!

 Tonight I saw two videos on art and dance and I was literally crying 
with joy. I'm so happy that I've taken this class! The funny thing was 
that I had planned on dropping this class first! But thanks to the 
mysterious universe, what I thought would be a required class is no more 
and now I can continue with the dance class!  =)  Not only does this dance 
class fulfill a basic education requirment for me to graduate but I'm 
one of 4 men in a class of about 40. Oh joy!!

 Seriously though, I am really going over the edge with glee. This is 
just fantastic!!! It is the perfect answer to my _enforced_ break. Not 
only that, but when i get back in the scene I should be able to bust a 
move or two to put JSL to shame. Sissors kick my ass! Watch these feet boy!!


smiles!  =)

To anyone who checks out Deeje's page (http://www.deeje.com), sees the
"OrbiLamp" (a brilliant idea!), please keep in mind to twist open the
bottle and leave the cap at least partly unscrewed.  Otherwise your
poor-man's lava lamp will become a poor man's super soaker -- the heat
from the lights in the cup will eventually heat up the drink, increasing
the pressure in the bottle to the point of explosion.  At best the cap
will blow off, the liquid will jet out, and you'll have an electrical
hazard as well as little gummy things on your ceiling...

It looks like we'll have a nice little crowd for our get-together 
tomorrow night!  We lost a few honorary boozehounds who will be attending 
the Be-In tomorrow, which looks really cool and almost made me want to 
change our final destination, but it's $15 bux to get in!  And we all know 
how much drinkie-poos cost.  So, the original plan stands:

9-ish to 11?   Makeout Room  on 22nd, cross street Mission
11 or so -->   Food Not Bombs benefit jungle/trance party
               Caesar's Palace  26th/Mission

Times are approximate.  We may want to stumble into other bars... but 
it should all be within staggering distance of Caesar's.  No 
driving til long after we sober up!

Kirsten and I will be there early, by 9.  Descriptions: both 5'4" humans 
of the female persuasion, with dark hair.  I'll have a star on my cheek! :)

see you there!!

Hello happy sunshine folks,


Well looks as though FNB will be the place to be tonight.  Won't be
doing the drinkie thang (Not partial to the barfly buzz). So I'll C-U @
3140 Mission...

Looks like Happy Kids for Friday may be my haunt.   Saturday: hmm,
possibly Resolution ( I really don't think I'll be doing Club Karma,
it's begining to feel like home... And I can't stand staying home on
weekends...).

In any case,

C-U in the Void,

---_Adam

UPDATE on DIGITAL BE-IN #9

This digest of Be-In 9 material forwarded by Brian Zisk, San FranZiskGo!  . . .

    * Thursday January 9. 7:00 p.m.

      Digital Be-In

      Thirty years ago, S.F. was host to The Human Be-In, a now-historic
      counter-culture gathering of hippies and other assorted "freaks" who
      converged on Golden Gate Park to express their commitment to forging a
      new future together. The Digital Be-In's 9th annual event is a tribute
      to the spirit of that day, and to the ever-increasing diversity of the
      wired world. Show highlights include musical performances by
      post-modern world music ensemble Beyond Race, African cultural rap by
      Hoopla Thang, Brazilian drummers and dancers Loco Bloco. Dancers
      include the traditional Aztec dance troupe Danza Teokalli, Panjaya
      Collective's "Angels in Cyberspace" performance piece, and the Burning
      Man fire dancers. Strategically held during the Macworld Expo, Verbum's
      ever-evolving Be-In is a multimedia concert, exhibition and gathering.
      The realtime event will be netcast with several video streams, virtual
      photography, and on-the-fly photojournalism, and can be accessed at
      www.be-in.com. SOMAR Gallery, 934 Brannan St. Tickets $15.00, available
      through Ticketweb, through BASS, and at the Micro Publishing News Booth
      at MacWorld - No 2348.

Hearing is a subject that comes up from time to time on this list.  I just
found a web page sponsored by H.E.A.R (Hearing Education and Awareness for
Rockers).  It is really informative about what kind of damage loud music
can do to you, and what to do about it (i.e. ear plugs).  I think someone
has mentioned this group before, but I thought I'd pass on the web page in
case anyone is interested.  It is an organization partly founded by one of
the founders of the Haight Ashbury Free Clinic.  Check it out.  Raves
definitely do damage to your ears.

...Was the shit last night!!!

That was some phat ass jungle being sprung through my ears.

It took me 1hr 1/2 to find the place, but once I did my nerves settled and
I was relaxed with a little salad and some good music. =)

If you people like jungle then I suggest you check this shindig out!

Siphon!

Hi to Lara who I met last night!  Sorry, I was baked and tired... =)

Folks, I am elated!  For the past 2+ years that I have been on SFRaves, I 
have bemoaned the fact that I didn't live in Rave Central, aka San 
Francisco.  I have longed to live there since 1993 and after 4 years of 
sacrifice (by living with parents! :) I've finally graduated from CSUS and 
last week my best friend, Melanie, and I found an apartment to share in North 
Bernal Heights!!!!  We move this coming Saturday the 11th!  Anyway, I 
just wanted to share with you in my joy, and I won't be unsubbed long, 
just til I get a new ISP situated in my new home.  Now I can finally 
contribute to the scene in the ways I have always wanted to! :):):):)

love & joy,
Amy

My info is limited, but I just was informed that Adrian (a really good sacto
jungle dj) will be spinning at Ricci's on 7th and J Streets in Down Town
Sacramento, tonight at about 10:30.  That's all I know, but I'll be there.

Don't know if it cost's, don't know if there will be other dj's.

Hi, thanks so much for your support on this. At this point, there is
no planned party affiliation... It's an interesting idea, but for the
most part, though I tend to lean towards the "non-partisan" thing.

BTW, to all those who have expressed interest in this mailing list and
getting a movement together, thanks! Sorry I haven't had to time to
respond this week, but I received more than enough interest to warrent
getting this started. I'll make another announcement this weekend with
about the new mailing list.

(and Leslie, email me! I accidently deleted the voicemail with your
phone number. doh!)

Steve

...sleep on your couch and raid the icebox at all hours of the night?


Just kidding.

But I am looking for a place to live in Berkeley,  Oakland, Albany or El
Cerrito area.
I'm 26 yrs old, have a solid job and I pay the bills on time.   I like to
party but don't want to live in a place were there are tweaqy  chemicals
being used morning, noon & night.

I'm a writer, dj, college grad, hugger, storyteller, goofball, and I loathe
slackers.

Can you help me?

I'd prefer to live in a place where there's a lot of creativity swirling
around,  but it's not necessary.

If you're looking for a roomie  or know of someone who is, please pass this
along.
And thanks for not flaming me for the nrr.  :o)
love,

Last night 115 minna was KICKIN with the best jungle i've heard in 
awhile.
the much-anticipated return of jason mouse with his east coast flava 
was SPECTACULAR, as well as Flux's.. and noel... and sean andrews...
FUCK!  everytime i went to go sit down, 
another phat bassline popped me back up on my feet.. hurt my knee, 
but it didnt matter! to take a rest i went outside, but that did no 
good, as the bassline was pumpin out there as well *great sound 
system* :)
:) last night was the way jungle should be 
played ALL the time! completely insane, but making sense all night 
long. and of course, 2 steps ahead of your mind :))
	hope to see more of you SFRavers out there! hi to Noah (i 
found you a cig but you were gone by then). steve and da5id !! :) great 
meeting u there... 
	also they handed out a mixtape.. flux, dance of the testes.. 
if any of you got it out there, it's WONDERFUL! massive big props to 
jonas and the b.a.s.s. kru for all the smiles and love they give all 
the junglists out there! 
take care all, and see you at Karma5!
hugs and love,
(: LAra :)

Hey, didn't someone mention, a while back, that there was 303/808
emulation software for the PC?  Something similar to this ReBirth 338? 
If so, could you please let me know where I can get it?

Yes, yes! I am completly smashed how fuckin cool this is!! You can make
your favorite acid/trance/techno tunes in about 2 minutes. Plenty o' knobs
and buttons to twiddle. If you have a Mac, you MUST get this!!!

I can now see how the original techno/rave types glommed onto this box. It
allows you to create some completely whacked tunes with almost NO musical
ability of any kind. Just create. Really the way to create a movement.

Another two thumbs up, way up, for this masterpiece!

Welcome to your first flame: PLEASE DON'T SHOUT! (ok, it is really lame as
far as flames go, but you sound like a nice guy....)

Posting in all caps is considered shouting and is unecessary unless you
really do mean to shout.

I kinda doubt this is the same Raindance who did the big Raindance festivals
in the UK which held 15-20K+ nutters...

or would it?

what will the next 303 be?

How can more and more of our brothers, sisters, children, and parents 
make music, find harmony with others, find themselves?

This list has seen countless posts about what raving is, but I finally 
understand what it means to me.  It's about the increasingly periodic 
renneasaunce (sp?) that is rising once again, in our time.  I get to 
contribute to a positive part of history.

And I get to share it with all of you.


peace

Dear Steve,

        This is an excellent idea, one that gets tossed around from time to
time, but our community never seems to really pick it up and run with it.
Promoters usually get the blame for busts which properly rests with the
police and the authorities, perhaps because we don't take the concept
signified by the "U" in PLUR seriously.
        But if you're serious, and it sounds like you are, I can find out
the names of some people in the Libertarian Party who have experience
writing initiative measures and getting them on the ballot.  I am 100%
behind you on this, and I can almost guarantee that we will have the
support of the Libertarian Party as well, and if we show a lot of support
for this from our community, we should be able to attract serious interest
from the party and other political groups in the broader libertarian
movement..
        Right now the rave community is not visible on the radar screen of
libertarians because ravers have not been politically active in alerting
potential allies to the civil liberties violations we witness on a regular
basis as have groups like gun owners, tax protesters, and opponents of the
war on drugs.  (I should add that libertarians have also been negligent in
doing outreach to youth in general and certainly to the rave community as a
subset of youth culture.)
        But again I think that the party would be more than receptive to
our concerns if we present evidence of what has been going on and
demonstrate that we are committed to ending the repression.
        I think we also need to increase the beat of the internal drum
circle (if you'll accept the metaphor!) on this issue if we're going to be
effective in producing lasting change.  Politicians are experts at divide
and conquer -- placating special interest groups and diluting their energy.
If ravers are not sufficiently determined in demanding real rather than
just token reform, they'll dissuade many of us from our original purpose
without giving anything significant in return.
        If we actually make enough of a stir to get the attention of the
establishment, these are some of the tactics we should be prepared for:



        * The cops to calm the waters by cleaning up their act a bit --
until the issue dies down.

        * Politicians and officials who say they are on our side, but urge
us to go slow or hold off while they study the issue, refer it to
committee, try to craft a compromise, or whatever, counting on us meanwhile
losing our momentum.  If we go along, we'll find when the issue inevitably
dies down that nothing's really changed.

        * Offers to work with the largest and best organized groups of rave
promoters to make it easier for them to get through the permit process and
not get busted, in effect buying their silence while the smaller parties
have just as bad a time of it as ever.

        * Members of our community to be appointed to various committees or
otherwise involved in the political process, so that they will have a
personal investment in the glacial nature of this process and provide a
counterweight to rabble rousers like myself. ;)

        * A crackdown, perhaps accompanied by the scapegoating of
underground raves as the source of various marginally related or unrelated
problems, such as drugs, gang activity, etc.  Politicians have found that
raising public fears about the safety and welfare of children (read: anyone
under 18) is an especially effective way to get people to go along with
increases in government control, so don't be surprised to see a particular
focus on the age of rave attendees as an excuse for perpetrating fascism.

        * The licensing of rave operators.  Again this would have the
effect of dividing us by giving licenseholders a stake in the process and
pitting them against unlicensed promoters who "didn't have to go through
what I went through" to throw a party.  Or recognized operators (with or
without licensing) might be given more leeway, with a few strings attached,
such as having to police their own parties for drugs, underage attendance,
hiring off-duty cops for security, etc., under the threat of having their
recognition revoked if they are found in violation.  Nothing keeps master's
hands clean and the slaves in line like giving a few willing slaves little
whips to hold over the others.

        Besides all this, something we have to be very careful of, imho, is
buying into premises which go contrary to what our scene is about.  At the
S.F. City Hall hearings three years ago, I remember rave promoters getting
up and testifying to things that just weren't true, such as denying the
prevalence of drug use or teenagers at parties.
        Whenever we do that, we validate the point of view that says there
is something wrong with using psychedelics, or pot, that there is something
wrong with a 16-year-old being at a fun, all-night dance event.  Our line
should be that these are matters of individual choice and parental concern,
not a concern of the government at any level or in any form.  Every time we
deviate from this outlook, we undermine our own position, and give the
authorities the moral justification for busting raves.
        Similarly, we must never agree that they have the right to make us
obtain a license or permit of any kind to throw a rave.  As long as the
consent of the property owner has been obtained, we are within our rights
of free speech, free assembly, and free expression.

To reiterate, A buddy of mine at the Good Guys in SJ is guaranteeing
all sfravers SL1200s for $449 and at least a 25% discount on all
needles. Anyone interested please respond to the email address below and
I will promptly send you all the info.

btw, I'm not involved nor making any money on this, I just want you
crazy DJ kiddees to be able to wake up at 3:00am and spin to your hearts
content.

love, energy, and viberations,

This was a very fun event. Good munchies all nite long, all one can devour.
There were two live acts that I didn't know but were good. 
There wasn't much seperation of the sound systems though, therefore the main
system was heard throughout the space. 
The space was a huge theatre of some sort, nice spacious room.

The music was a fun mix with a strong showing of female DJ's Pollywog, DRC,
and Jen(?) 
Jungle, Trance and some downtempo type stuff kept everyone intetested and happy.
For me though, DRC brought on the rain for the last DJ to play and Flux
played some nice earth shaking bass. 
Bummed I missed Jon Carel's set though.
 I saw kind people all nite long.

Oh well, sleep now

Ahh,  the smell of a Friday....

Too bad I wasn't able to witness DRC set. Ya know, had to get to the
good 'ole 9-5 and all (Ok, 8-5 with an hr lunch).  But I'd have to say
that missing DRC's set was possibly the only lowpoint I could think of @
this event.  The place was OK,  I think it was one building away from
the last FNB benefit.  I really didn't catch what was goin' on in the
upstairs room, just gruuvin to the beats on the main floor...
Got there during Tomcat's set.  And that live mic to the jungle set was
pretty on as well.  I guess everybody was moving during Jack Acid's set
(the live set?)...  A really great cross-section of people were there
too: college folk, goths, skaters... U name it. It is nice to see people
come together for a common cause.
I really didn't eat too much food'n'all but it did wet my appetitte for
the weekend events.

Got to meet some of ya's as well (hello Nancy, KaySEE and Micron).  And
I THINK I saw someone else (shy??).  Oh well, hopefully I'll see some
more of ya'lls out @ _Happy Kids_ or _Resoultion_.

Till Then. Dare to be Different,

Went to a new club in Sacto last night.  It's at Ricci's, downtown on 7th
and J.  I never go out during the week, but dj Adrian was spinning, and he's
spins jungle.  There haven't been any flyers put out, so the turn out was
pretty minimal.  But I wasn't there to see people....I wanted to hear some
d&b.  Adrian rocked as usual, and the music fucked with my head and sent me
into hysterics several times.  Jungle is just so weird....I love it.  

I get the impression that this club, which I still don't know the name of
will be mostly house, but the resident dj (Mike Moss) who also does all the
booking told me he wants to give all the Sacto dj's a chance regardless of
style.  I thought that was pretty cool.  He even asked if we (RE:) wanted to
come out and do a live ambient/idm set.  I'm into it, so I'll post something
if it happens.  

So I stayed up hours past my bed time, and now I'm paying sitting here at
work trying to be functional.  I think I'll go home sick and sleep.

My only beef is that it costs $5, and it's really small.  But in this case
it was worth it to hear Adrian's d&b.

Hey all-

Can anyone tell me how I can get my party posted to the SFR calendar that is on
the web? I posted it on here but I would like to get it posted to the calendar.
I have posted it to the GRID but that does not connect to the calendar per se.
So if anyone can help me that would be great. :-)

Thank you and you ALL have a great and sage day,

*hugz and kisses*

Macadio G.

Boozin' Ravers was tons of fun last night!  Though only 3 listers showed 
(the other 15 who told me they were going can start feeling guilty 
right...NOW!), plus a coupla friends and me and K, we made a happy little 
group of superfriendly ravelings.  We'll definitely have to do it 
again... though probably on an occasional basis.  Weekly is too much for a 
9-to-5'er like me.  Though I don't feel as awful as you would think 
right now, at work with a hang-over and not enough sleep!

Now, the review:

Makeout Room
I originally picked it in part because last Saturday night it was 
practically empty, lots of room in a nice bar.  But last night it was 
packed!  Must be a local SF thang.  Thumbs up for the bartenders, serving 
up well-made drinks.

Food Not Bombs 
A nice party for an even nicer cause... and still providing
us a quality party for just $5.  Good work!  An awesome food buffet, live
acts, dj's, fire dancers, and an interesting mix of people.  We were there
around 11:30-1, and there was some experimental/jungle/trance-ish music
for the dancefloor, and a live band ruminating over some dark sounds
upstairs.  Don't know who the djs/artists were, but I do know we missed
DRC and Jon Carel!  :(   Ah well, there's always another party! 

Cesar's was the site of my first real party, Kundalini two years ago, and 
I hadn't been back since.  Returning last night (as an organizer of a 
raver get-together!) was a wonderful closing of a circle... of parties 
and personal growth and experience over the last two years, both because 
of the scene and of my own path... I remember wandering through Cesar's 
that first time, so overwhelmed by all the sights and sounds, how 
everything seemed so odd and alien at first... and wandering through last 
night, but this time knowing that I belonged to the scene and it to me and 
more importantly, that I had learned how to come home to myself... that I 
could dance and talk and laugh last night so easily, without the 
trepidation and uncertainty of the me of a few years ago...

:)

In my review I neglected to mention who my happy co-boozers were... I 
have rarely named people in reviews, thinking that somehow invaded their 
privacy, but I have decided fuck that!  Everyone likes a little fame and 
adulation, right?

SO, shout-outs and thank you for a fun night to Branka, Micron, AMancias 
and of course KaySEE!  And also Adam and Jonas at FNB.

A whole bunch of other people have expressed interest, so stay tooned for 
Boozers #2...

Just wanted to say thanks for posting this.  What a beautiful idea!  I 
hadn't thought of raving in those terms, as a renaissance of creativity 
and art bubbling up from the masses... but yes, I guess it is!

I had a blast last night :). Too bad I couldn't stay longer, but in a way I
am glad, because I feel just fine now :P.

It was really nice to hang out with cool people, have a drink or two, and
BS.  I am totally up for this becoming a bi-weekly get together.

Thanks Nancy for organizing this!!!

See you guys soon,

The 9th Digital Be-in was the best ever, in my opinion.  (It was actually
the fourth...but who's counting?)

The first one I attended was three years ago at the Fashion Center.
It was great, but the one held last night at the SOMAR gallery topped it.

Why?  Because of the diverse groups that helped out last night.

First off:  Clair (of Gateway) coordinated the "altar room."  The Goa Gals
of CCC (and friends) brought their stunning black light banners and set up
(2?) altars.  The centerpiece of one was a day-glo Buddha statue painted
with fluorescent paints.  There was also an altar called "False Profits"
featuring prints of Tammy-Faye and Jim Baker, flanked by pictures of Jesus
and Mary.  Creepy.

Clair built an altar, too.  The part I liked best on this one was the
beautiful fountain she placed on the floor in front of it.  Maureen set up
her altar next to Claire's- Mo's altar featured a department store dummy
from outer space.  Mo is a champion marbler and decorated her altar with
some fluorescent marbled prints.  (Don't know what marbles are?  check
out:  http://nature.berkeley.edu/~loraine/Marbles for some samples..)

The New Moon was last night, so we were psyched when Clair invited us to
build an altar at the Be-in.  As alwasy, it was a collaboration-between
Gregg, Vanessa (the Minx!), Mona (yes..she's back!) and myself.
Peter-Rachel came with Minx in a stunning outfit.  (Androgeny rules!)
Ronan- the only member of the New Moon group who spins- got to play
the first set in the altar room.   We also had help from Miko, Java
Evangelist.  I asked him to be the New Moon Evangelist for the night, and
so he went around explaining that since the Be-In was (close) to the New
Moon, the Be-In was actually one huge New Moon rave.  Cool.

There were lots of computer folks showing their wares, mingling with many,
many raver-types:  the CCC trance-tribe, some Mad/FnF kids, and also
Gateway.  Jon Carel brought those big blue speakers of his for the main
room's sound system.  And Joe Rice brought his smaller system for the
altar room.

CCC also set up an ambient tent in an open space beside the gallery, and I
spent a while listening to Justin spin some groovy, mellow ambient tunes.
When he started playing Portishead I felt like I had come home.

Suzy and friends manned (womanned) the computer altar in the altar room.
I had loads of fun with the digital camera she loaned me...got to take 16
pictures of altars.  Hope I get to see the pictures soon!

I also met Matt, who managed the web site for the party.  

The organization for this one was impeccable...our New Moon crew got in
for free and was astonished to find lots of yummy food in a back room to
keep us staff-people well-nourished through the night.

Thanks so much to Clair for inviting us to participate!!!!  And for
coordinating so many people.  It's so good to have you back in SF,
sweetie!

Love,

Ann

						DJ HARDWARE:)
					A&R Director - Adrenalin Records


P.S. : Some people in the past have said that I make royalities of these
CD's, well, I don't. I just make money to mix them and thats all. Also I'm
not tring to SPAM the NET, I'm just using the NET as a resource to find
booking outside florida and to play to different types of ravers. If
you don't like to read this just delete it... This is part of the rave
culture.... PLUR........


				Thanks Again!!

Hi everyone, sorry I'm doing this... but I finally got my Keyboard to work
again!!!
(I bought a new one) I had not been checking my mail/posting since NYE! so
I figured I should make up for that time ;)

12/31/96
New Years Eve 

Eric (250blowpopguy) and I are at work and *we* decide that we are going to
"ORIGIN"... anyhow, I get to "ORIGIN" after driving all the way to SF to
buy a
ticket and come back to note that the party was 'busted'. at 12:00. isn't
that fun?
Anyhow...since Eric was already at the party I figured I should wait for
him since the party got busted... after  1.5 hours, he comes out of
METAMORPHOSIS (the party down the street) and he and his friends decide to
go to another party. Me, all alone and sober on now NY. get to go home and
sleep at 1:00am.  (I asked them if I could go, but they said: "Its not our
house" as 20 other people followed them in their cars....which I took
personally. but then, I got over it... [*sigh*]

Anyhow,
two days went by and I went to Karma III on Fri night... once again, Eric
had decided to go to Karma also..but he ended  up at ALL IN THE FAMILY. 

Karma was cool, there was a weird vibe going on but I was fairly happy
(considering I was sober) there I got to see Lara, Leslie, Aryck,
April...wait a sec. Was KarmaIII before or after NY??? oops!
nevermind....wrong review [*blush*]...

KARMA IV!
Ok..this is the right one...a week after KarmaIV, I went to KARMA V. This
time 
Eric drove me! :-) hehehe...(he didn't get away) basically I made up for
what happened on NYE, I was very happy ( ;o) ) and I got to meet reallly
cool people!
The music was rad! I recognized this song that I have on a CD that was
played
around 4 or so (whoever was DJing around that time rules :P) now I play it
all day...but anyhow, it was nice seeing Leslie, Randy, Rebecca[?], and a
bunch of other SFRavers. I would also like to say thanks to Antonio and
Hope for being so rad and I send hugs to Anthony, Nicole and Kristen (very
rad people I met, that I hope to see at Harmony -if I can get a ticket :P)
and kisses and love to "Mr. Celsius and Ms. Farenheit"...they where really
cool! Also a hug goes to Jonathan and extra love goes
to Becca and Eric even though they dis me often ;o)

Anyhow...I just needed to get that off my system! 
Thank you so much to everyone and sorry for taking up badwidth :o)
I hope to see alot of you at EMINENCE tomorrow night (I was thinking of
Karma5 but I feel like going to a Massive for a change :o)) besides, I want
a free tape! :P

I don't know what I'll be wearing...but I'll probably have my SFraves badge
with me!
so come and say hi and I'll do the same ;o) I have LifeSavers and Stickers
for everyone...

Luv
Pabs

this is just a rumor...  I heard that sometime in the near future, MTV will
change their music format from the crap that's on right now to a more dance
oriented flavor.

can anyone out there confirm or verify this rumor....

what may have fueled this speculation is a show called AMP that's on late
at night on Fridays and Saturdays (about 12-2am).  the show consists of
techno videos mixed both musically and visually.  some highlights are
Prodigy's Firestarter, Chemical Brothers' Setting Sun, and Orbital's The
Box....

I'll be going to EMINCENC '97 tomarrow.  If anyone needs a ride from the
SAC area I'll be passing through on my way to S. F.  Just e-mail me with
directions to your place or we can meet somewhere(tacobell, McDonalds,
etc...) If you don't need a ride then I'll hope to see everyone there!

Hmmm.  I don't know.  I absolutely NEVER watch MTV.  The only time I ever see
it is when I get home and my fiancee is watching it (at which point she changes
the channel), or when she flips to it and won't change the channel (at which
point I meander into another room - I'm not exactly sure why it is, but I 
REALLY detest MTV).

Anyway, the point is, I am never in MTV's presence for more than 2 minutes or
so at a time, and that the last two times it has been on, the video being shown
was.......... The Chemical Bros!! (Don't know the name of the song) The first
time was in the evening, the second today, after lunch, so I think it airs
regularly. Maybe some of you (less-fortunate) MTV watchers could confirm this ;)

Thinking about how when it first went on the air, I was one of the loudest
proclaiming how it would shape music for the better,

It's not just MTV that is changing their format to shift away from
alternative/rap (although the two still get the lion's share of
airtime). But the music industry in general is lagging. The big labels
and mainstream retailers are looking for a new musical genere(sp?). I've
read one article about this in TIME, one in the Wall Street Journal
(what, don't YOU read it? :P) and a few others that don't come to mind.
All of the articles mentioned Trip-Hop and Jungle as the early
contenders.

Maybe I just haven't been reading enough SFR postings, and this has
already been disussed, but to me, this sounds like a BIG DEAL! What
these indicators are pointing at is the very real posibilty that some
types of Electronic Dance Music may go MAINSTREAM! I have no idea.
however, what I should think of this. Is this a good thing? Or will the
music become generic and watered down and played out? Anyone have
thoughts on this?

Just a thought, but some of the "crap" that is on now, came from some
really good underground scenes 5 or 10 years ago. Do you really think mass
exposure of the music via MTV is really a good thing?

i believe this to be an interesting question.  
--does the MTV projection of musical format and culture to the mainstream 
make our country an overall better place to be?

recently, i heard a discussion somewhere about how the major labels have 
a love-hate relationship with MTV because as they do need MTV's 
international delivery, it also pushes the envelope to quickly.  the 
labels can't sign the bands before they become stale and overplayed.  
and, as late night video appearances by aphex twin and chemical brothers 
suggest, MTV is poised to lead our youth to the latest scene,  what they 
don't get is that our musical youth are two steps ahead of even the djs , 
and mega corporations like MTV are always gonna be playin' catch up.  the 
lines between madison avenue and mtv seem to be blurring anyways.  and 
its the advertisers that are required to stay superfresh.  whatever the 
marketing department wants seems to be key factor determining airplay.  
yet, MTV serves our societal function of communicating the collective 
unconscience of today's youth demographic to mainstream.  and, these 
switches are inevitable if not double-edged.

thanx for the bandwidth.

i believe this to be an interesting question.  
--does the MTV projection of musical format and culture to the mainstream 
make our country an overall better place to be?

recently, i heard a discussion somewhere about how the major labels have 
a love-hate relationship with MTV because as they do need MTV's 
international delivery, it also pushes the envelope to quickly.  the 
labels can't sign the bands before they become stale and overplayed.  
and, as late night video appearances by aphex twin and chemical brothers 
suggest, MTV is poised to lead our youth to the latest scene,  what they 
don't get is that our musical youth are two steps ahead of even the djs , 
and mega corporations like MTV are always gonna be playin' catch up.  the 
lines between madison avenue and mtv seem to be blurring anyways.  and 
its the advertisers that are required to stay superfresh.  whatever the 
marketing department wants seems to be key factor determining airplay.  
yet, MTV serves our societal function of communicating the collective 
unconscience of today's youth demographic to mainstream.  and, these 
switches are inevitable if not double-edged.

thanx for the bandwidth.

I new to SFR having just moved from DC, so I also haven't seen any postings. 
But if it has been discussed I would be interested in seeing this thread if
anyone has it archived.


I certainly don't see mainstreaming as being a good thing. The more
people who just want to make money are involved the worse things can get.

Of course this is assuming dance music can become as mainstream as alternative did:
ENIT didn't do as well as LOLLAPOLOOZA.

An opinion.

There will always be a mainstream.

There will always be an underground of purer artistic expression.

I look forward to a time when the mainstrean is as demanding of honest 
artistic integrity as the underground is.  When the emphasis is not on 
who's the biggest star, but does everyone learn to shine.

peace

	Yeah, either tragically or happily, depending on your point
of view, techno's about to explode and go mainstream here in the states,
as it's already done in Europe/the UK.  MTV is going to start showing
such 'techno-inflected' (their word, not mine) videos as those by Orbital,
Prodigy, Underworld, et al.  Apparently, no one's really into Seattle
grunge much any more, gangsta rap has seen its day, 'alternative' music
is no longer such, and, as pop music has always looked for something new,
now it's looking for the energy of rave, techno, and jungle.  U2's new
record, for instance, is heavily influenced by techno, and they've brought
a DJ on board, and their new video for 'Discotheque' is totally ravey.
And have you seen those Microsoft commercials w/ the techno soundtrack?
The 'this way to the internet' ones?  Really strange.  I know what 95
percent of us ravers will say to all this--"OH MY GOD! NO WAY!
CORPORATIONS CASHING IN ON OUR VIBE!  KEEP IT UNDERGROUND!" and I'm
inclined to agree.  MTV techno won't be half as cool as what we're lucky
enough to know, I know, but at the same time, how many of us have said, "I
wish the rest of the world could understand the beauty and magic of our
music and scene"?  
Now, I know that when most of us think that, we're not thinking along the
lines of MTV videos and television commercials, but this *is* the
proverbial mainstream we're talking about; there has to be some
give-and-take, I guess. 

best,
Timothy

Hello.  Welcome to the Psychiatric Hotline.
     
If you are obsessive-compulsive, please press 1 repeatedly.
     
If you are codependent, please ask someone to press 2.
     
If you have multiple personalities, please press 3,4,5, and 6.
     
If you are paranoid-delusional, we know who you are and we know what you 
want; just stay on the line so we can trace the call.
     
If you are schizophrenic - listen carefully - and a little voice will 
tell you which number to press.
     
If you are manic-depressive, it doesn?t matter which number you press, no 
one will answer.
     
If this is an emergency and you require the care and guidance of a 
highly-skilled, trained professional, you are out of luck because they were 
all cut back or forced out.  However, if you are willing to hold, one of 
our cross-trained, multi-skilled, team members will be happy to serve you 
as best as they can after he or she gets finished scrubbing the floor.

	-- C A P R I C O R N --

the santa cruz weekly, was absolutely PATHETIC & sucked imesnsly... why?

	1)  somebody was ripping off people's stuff (there were in/outs galor)
	    and madame mercury's down jacket was stolen right before us
	
	2)  we later approached 'eric' (lead promoter) about da obvious problem
	    and totally yelled & disrespected me about responsiblity!!!
	    i was only offering some constructive criticism and was completely
	    belittled as an idiot.  i could not believe his nerve and didnt
	    apreciate it ONE bit. 

  	3)  two black lights & a radioshack strobe for lighting (whatever)
	    my dorm room has better lighting

	4)  dj up on stage away from the dance floor, no watching da gods
	
	5)  the building's heating ducts were on full blast & windows closed
	    and the promoters refused to do anyting, that was rediculous.

	6)  and finally the "party" ended at 1am, what the hell? 

____BOTTOM LINE______
	chargin $5 bucks for 3 & half hours of crappy Retro Bouncy club 
	    house music, to get our stuff stolen my some santa cruz wannabe
	gangster, to sweat standing still in the poorly lit room, and to
	    be totally bitched & yelled at for NO reason ....

	has led me to NEVER RETURN... i haven't had such a SHITTY night 
"raving" in a L O N G time.   i've never "anti-promoted" before but going 
to "CRAP-ricorn" on any upcoming friday night  WOULD NOT BE A RECOMENDATION
							OF MINE.

        What a great party that was...

        It wasn't *just* a rave, it was a lot of different things
        happening at once, but after midnite it became the best
        rave I've been to yet ...

        Chill room with 4 altars (2 by Raven) and an ET sculpture...

        Beyond Race Live ...

        Naked dancers juggling fire (I'm sorry folks, there
        just isn't anything in the world that raises the
        energy level of a party like *naked dancers juggling 
	fire*) ...

        Willie Brown & Jerry Brown were both there ...

        It didn't get busted (surprise) ...

I've been reading all the posts about how techno music will become
mainstream and raves won't be as fun as they were before. What all the
people that are dedicated to the cause need to do is to dig deeper to find
new artists, new horizons, the sell out is unavoidable, but we have to
remember that the people who decide what music we have to listen to and
what videos we watch are after the almighty dollar, to them techno music is
nothing more than a fad, but we have to remember that WE have a big role in
how things will end up because WE have the power, WE have money in our
pockets and if we don't like what thay are stuffing down our throats we can
say "fuck-off" the money stays in my pocket. Let them find a new way to
make cash. Of course there is a positive side that many people will find a
new type of  music that will soothe their soul and help them find the
person on the inside they really are.

LOL!  That cracked me up!

Way back when, I put out a message to the effect that what we needed to
do was cater to Willie Brown's ego if we wanted to stop the rave busts. 
Now I suggest we start a rave series called  "Willie For Mayor" or
"Willie's Ravers" or "Heya come Da Mayor!", something to that effect.  A
very small portion of the proceeds would go towards Willie's reelection
campaign fund.

For those of you that thought having a gleefully corrupt politician as
the mayor was a good thing, I'm sure you'll agree that playing the
politics game and "greasing the political machine" (I seem to recall
those as being John S. Lee's words) is the best way to ensure that raves
stop getting busted.

Comments?

g-day all!!!

*hugs* to everyone =8-)

i think that MTV going in that direction is a good thing, as a lotta MTV
viewers will explore the scene because it'll be the "in" thing to do. i
believe that because of this exposure, many people will get the chance to
see what this scene is REALLY about, and they will understand it, and
become a true part of it. And when this scene is not the "fad" anymore,
those who explored it just to be "in" will leave it, but those who truly
became a part of it, will remain.

then we can get more hugs ;-) 

my 2 sense, well, maybe worth only 1....

hello,

well, being new to the bay area, the be-in was my first taste of what
this
new place is like. i must say, it was great!

the computer exposwere kinda cool, too bad they didnt have any extra
silicon
graphics hats left. :(

the main room with the lasers was really setup well. i really liked the
color wheels. i have to get
one of those, does anyone know of any stores that sell them? i was
thinking of making one, it doesnt look that hard.

the chill out room was cool too. i dont know the name of the dj that was
spinning, but the set was good. the decorations were excellent, and the
"altars" reminded me of my friend from india's house.

by far, the best were the live performances.  the first group of live
performers with the one man
playing the aboriginal instrument was really good. the fire dancers
added a really good flair to the whole experience. what is their name? i
need to get their cd if they have any.

i love this place :)

Hello everyonee,

I'm back on the list and it's nice to see it has settled.  NYE was ok.  I 
lost my ID in Reno so spundea's was out and after frolicing in Union 
Square and Embarcadero I cruzed over to Oakland only to find all the 
parties busted.  :(

To my request:

   I'm helping out a few new friends with a party comming up on January 
31st, here in San Luis Obispo.  WE are looking for a dj or two that 
spins ambient/dub.  If you spin ambient/dub or know someone who does 
could you please contact me.  I'm sure we could cover expenses to come 
down but I'm not the man dealing with the money so If your interested 
I'll get you in touch with the person who is(I can't spell his name or 
else it would be entered here..hehee).  

I'll post details of dj's and such later when everything is allittle more 
solid.

Thanks

Peace,

       Austin

Hey all 

I wanted to post this cuz I got alot of new music over the break and I 
thought I would share.  

MODA posted about his new mixed tape a while back and I just got it last 
week but i haven't stopped listening to it.  Great progressive house/trance 
for 
chillin or doing homework or even getting your late night groove on.  
Thanks Moda for the tape I love it!

I also got StarEyes Ruffage in the mail.  I haven't listend to it to much 
cuz my roommate hates jungle and makes me turn it off when ever he comes 
home.  I just started listening to Jungle alot more and I like this 
tape.  It's got the fugee's mix on it...

I also got a DeiselBoy and Corbin tape which is more goood jungle but not 
as hard as the Ruffage tape.  There are more ambient/jungel tracks in 
this one.

Scott Hardkiss - i think it's called YES.  It's a copy of a copy. More 
good progressive.  Strange, delitful, and soothing house and progressive.

Doc Martain.  I got several of his tapes over the break.  "Flamable 
Liquid", "Unlock the House Part 2  12/5/95", and "Unlock the House 3/26/96".
The "ULH 3-26-96" is phat!  I love absolutly every song in this mix.  All 
of Doc's favorits are on this.  Sorry i'm bad with track names but I know 
all of you will recognize 80% of the tracks on this tape.  Too bad my 
copy is so shitty.  If anyone has a good copy of this mixed tape (Unlock 
the House 3-26-96) please let me know I would like to get a better copy.

Also I got a deep house tape called INHUMAN - "Return to the Deep City"
Good house grooves, disco type riffs with some waling diva choons.. I 
haven't listen to it all but I got it on sale for 5 bucks and it was 
worth it. 

I also got Dj Dan's new cd Loose Caboose.  My aunt gave me a Warehouse 
gift certificate so I got this and the WIPEOUT XL compelation.  The Dan 
disc is very good but on a few mixes they sound too perfect.  Ya know?  
Like you could tell they were studio mixed.  I prefer the live tapes but 
this is a good mix for the mainstream america.  Not as hard as I would 
like Dan to be.  

The WIPEOUT XL compelation has tracks by Chemical Brothers, FSOL, 
Leftfield, Underworld, Prodigy, umm and more.  Many jungle tracks.  i 
like Leftfield's Afro Ride and the Chemical Brothers.  Some crazy jungle 
tracks on this one too -  It's good to piss off your roommate some times 
hheee hee.  :)

Hmm I got some other cool records and tapes too but I havne't had a 
chance to get into them much enough. I've said enough anyways...

PLUR,

       Austin

  Yeah!! I wholeheartedly agree--I mean c'mon, sure, Willie Brown has his
faults, as do all human beings, but on a very practical level, he's pretty
cool, and he's about as supportive of the underground scene as a
politician can publicly be w/out running the risk of alienating his
mainstream consituency.  His son is a DJ, I've been told, and he
understands what the scene is about, and, well, he is in a position to
enact positive change in terms of the civic perception of our community. 

  I dont know if campaign contributions are something I agree with, but
perhaps more raves for political causes, where a portion of the proceeds
is donated to a political organization?  Like what food not bombs is
doing, for instance.  I think it'd be great to go to a political rave: 
Imagine the energy level that would produce!  Everyone dancing away in the
spirit of bringing about social change.  *And* it would give ravers more
credibility when we tell our skeptics that we rave to bring about a better
world.  That's what San Francisco is known for, and we ravers could be the
catalyst/flashpoint for the fusion between the political and technological
changes that this country is undergoing right now!  

  Look at the facts: More free-thinking liberals are in power than ever
  before in American history--Clinton's got *12* Berkeley professors
  working for him, for goodness' sake!  That's incredible!

  Techno/Dance/Rave/Our Music is about to blow up globally.  It's gonna
  be huge, like it or not.  That time is now--look around, the music's
  all over the place!

  The San Francisco Bay Area is the epicenter of the digital renaissance:
  it's ground zero, it's where everything's coming from.  This is the 
  petri dish for life in the 21st century; everything's getting tested
  right here and now.  Nowhere else do people swap email addresses like
  phone numbers, or carry pagers as they do wallets. We're so far ahead of
  everything else, it's dizzying. And the rest of the world is watching
  SF, seeing what will happen here.  The spotlight is on us--so we should
  dance harder!  And whio understands all this technology?  *Young* 
  people--us.  Advancements in technology are finally bringing about the
  idea of a global community, and we're the torchbearers.

So, I know there will be a tendency by a lot of us in the coming months to
dismiss the mainstream, but in one respect, we should be flattered.  I 
mean, it's sort of cute--all these big, stumbling companies and
politicians, trying to figure out what the heck is going on out here, and
they're all scratching their heads.  The mainstream is knocking on our
door, and the big question will be, are we going to turn our backs on them
or are we going to lead and show them all that we know?  

I think we should be proud, and make ourselves heard. This is the time,
more so than ever before.  We've got the mic!  And the turntables! 

It's just been frustrating for me recently, when I keep noticing/thinking
that we really are on the verge of an enormous cultural breakthrough, and
that we have so much power, but no one seems to notice or be very
interested in it.  I mean come on!  Throughout history, for good
or bad, different points on the globe have had the spotlight--Rome had it,
England had it, China had it, Germany had it, etc. etc., and now, in 1997,
there is no place on earth which will have more significance in
determining what life will be like in the next 25 years than San
Francisco does.  How cool is that?! 

"Change the world!!  Change the world!!  Change the world!!"  

best,
Timothy

	Call me a starry eyed dreamer, but I think it might not
even be necessary to give anybody any money. Let's just register
some young voters & *maybe* do a little lefty political consciousness
raising, and let the powers that be know we're doing it. Then see what
happens.

And you must remember too that you can say "fuck-off" to THIS industry
that treats it simply as a fad, to which they suck off as much money
as they can; i.e. the major record labels.  The problem being that
all the majors own sub-labels and sub-labels of sub-labels, that it
can become hard to know who's who.  So if this is a concern, simply
ask your friendly music proprietor and they should be able to help.
I guess then you can help keep the integrity in making music at it's
maximum.

David Bowie's jungle seems outcast already... i respect the music he's
made and all, but fuck !   he's just too old!  it'd be nice to see him
retire with some dignity...

While I appreciate the sentiment, I totally disagree. All one need do is
look about 25-35 years into the past. The parallels are there.

No, people are going to welcome them with open arms, they will come in
to the house, rummage around a bit, walk out with the T.V. and go down to
the local pawn shop and sell it. They will then come back for the
computer, the V.C.R., and every other thing of value, until they have
played your house *out*. Then they will move on to the next house. Why,
given the repeated history of this occuring is it so hard to believe? You
are dealing with people that operate in a totally seperate paridigm:
"Peace, Love, Unity, Respect, uh, yeah how much is all that stuff worth,
and how can I use it to sell tee-shirts?"

It has all been done before. If people really hope to suceed this time, a
different approach is required.

Again, try getting out more. The scene is already old-hat in England and
most of Europe, along with the playing of Techno on MTV. These people are
not behind us. It is we that are playing catch-up in many regards.

With all the discussions on the future of music floating around,
I really felt like reaching out...

To me, the beauty of music is the combined enjoyment of those who make 
the music and those who dance/trance/smile/cry to the music.  They're not 
two different sides.. everyone indulges in listening to the magical 
sounds that we call music.. everyone has their own trips, their own 
passions and desires that shape who they are how they interact with
the music.

When I began embracing new types of music and new cultures, I felt
that the greatest role of music was to provide a medium through which
people could share their passions, at least at the subconscious level.
For the first time in my life, I saw the conscious purpose of making music
to be *expression*, not impressing others.  The idea seemed so
fulfilling to me, that I decided to let music shape my life more than
ever before.  I gave up my computer science career/studies/future at
MIT because it had nothing to offer in comparison with following my
passions.  Money, fame, admiration.. it all seemed horribly empty
compared with the lust I had found for music.

Coming back to Santa Cruz, I rediscovered the other half of music I
had felt at age ten while drumming with others on the beach:  *listening*.
I saw (actually, I heard) how in drum circles, the more I listened to
the music, the more the music seemed to listen to me.  Euphoric.. that's
how I felt when I stopped thinking of music, and of the world as a whole,
as input vs. output, me vs. them, playing vs. listening.. not that I had
seen these as opposing sides, yet at best they had always been two
different sides working together.  Now they are one and the same to me..
unified manifestations of a bigger picture.  Not just a "collective
unconscious".. more like a collective conscious, a collective BEING.

Integration in every form is divine (too bad I didn't think that way
in Calculus class).. wouldn't it be awesome if cops and ravers, kids
and adults, tradition and technology, anger and peace..  all came
together to work in harmony?  Maybe it's best not set them apart
from the beginning..

Hi everyone, this is Paul. I feel sad.
Well, hope everyone is having fun tonight at whatever rave they are going
to. I know I am having such a great time at home. I have exactly $105
which means that I could probably get 3 people in to a $25 rave tonight,
not including me. I wish I was at a rave right now, but my dad wont let
me leave at all and I am not going to sneak out, no matter how much I
want to. I can't sneak out, I did it once the night of Nation and got
caught. I don't want that to happen again. I feel so sad and wish I was
at any rave right now, I haven't been at any rave since Origin and
wouldn't care what rave I was at. Even a shitty one right now.

See I was sick on Mon & Tues and went back to school on Wed. I felt
awfull on Wed. I stayed home on Thursday and felt good enough to almost
go back to school on Friday. But I wanted to be completly better so I
stayed home Friday too. My dad excused all the abscences and all so, i
didn't cut. i feel fine now and am sick of not going anywhere at all now.
I have bank, and i can take CalTrain/BART/Taxi or whatever to go to a
rave tonight.

I am sooo bored and hope everyone has fun at whatever you are going to
tonight. I love all you people and hope that everyone cherishes the fact
that they have the freedome to go to a rave tonight. Have fun.

Bye,
Paul

Hi, this is Libby.  I've only posted once before.  For those of you who I
don't know yet, I'm about 5'3.  I have long, dirty-blonde hair.  I can
usually be found bouncing around parties wearing a big smile and lots of
glitter.  Hmmm, sounds like a lot of the ravers out there.  Anyway...

My mother and I have a really good friendship, but I've always felt like
we could be closer.  I moved out in October, because she said as long as
I lived with her I wasn't allowed to go to parties.  (I'm 19, by the way,
so I though she was being a little unreasonable.)  Ever since then, I've
been trying to convince my mom to go to a party with me.  I really want
to share myself and my experiences with her.  It took a lot of
convincing, but she finally said yes!  She's even going to bring a
"date".

Now, here's the problem.  I know my mom has an idea about what goes on at
raves, but I don't think she knows the full extent of it.  I'm really
excited that she's agreed to go to a party with me.  I just don't want
her to die of shock as soon as she gets there!  She's a musician, so
nothing can shock her (so she says).  Still, I want to make she she and
her friend are properly prepared for what they're going to experience.

So, what should I do to prepare my mom?  Can anybody out there offer me
some advice on how to handle this situation?  How about all you
parents/grown adults out there who go to parties?  Also, how about all
you "kids" who have taken your parents to parties with you?

I do plan to have a talk about raving with my mom and her friend, prior
to the party.  I do plan to tell her that I take drugs at these parties. 
I do not plan on taking drugs at the party.  My mom tried drugs when she
was younger, but she's totally against them, now.  When she found out all
the drugs I'd "tried", she flipped out!  She gets upset if she thinks I
smoked pot.  She would never try e.  A lot of people who have never done
e say that people who are xing look really scary.  I don't want to scar
my mom for life.  I just want to have fun with her and show her a world
where people are geniunely friendly and people are united by music and
love.  She's had a tough life, and I want her to see that there is hope. 
I think the rave scene could really open her up.

I would really appreciate any advice anyone can offer.

Also, what would be a good party for my mom's first time?  PLEASE TELL ME
THERE'S A LEPIDOPTERA COMING UP!  My mom knows the kids who throw it, so
that would be really cool!  Besides, anyone who goes to Lepidoptera for
their first party is spoiled, spoiled, spoiled ;)

What exactly is an "e"? And why are people taking
drugs to have a good time? I don't feel that drugs
are what really make a rave or party fun. I think
it is, in fact, the unity and love between each
person there. I don't understand why people use
drugs, but hey, people have their own opinions on
things. Peace.

Drugs are NOT necessary in order to have fun.  I'll admit that I have fun
when I'm on drugs, but I also have a lot of fun when I'm sober.  Drugs
can open up new worlds for people.  They can help people open up to
themselves and others.

I know a guy who used to be so painfully shy that he had almost no
friends, because he couldn't open up to people.  One night, he tried e
(ecstacy) and it helped him get rid of his inhibitions.  That night, he
opened up to himself.  Then he had this revelation: if he could open up
like that while he was on e, why couldn't he do it when he was sober?

Now that guy, a good friend of mine, has friends, a girlfriend, and a lot
of confidence.  He is finally happy.  Ecstacy helped him open up to the
world.  Some people don't need drugs to do that for them.  I fully
respect that.  I just hope non-drug-users can respect the choices that I
make for myself.

drugs are not at parties to make it fun. of course you 

will find drug use anywhere, and anywhere you find drug use,

you find drug abuse. the most prominent drugs found at parties

hold properties that can enhance spiritual, emotional, and

inter-personal connections/relationships. of course, whether

or not they are used for this purpose and not just to get fucked

up or to have fun is completely up to the person who decides to 

take the drugs in the first place. drugs are not for everyone.

just as some people don't understand why others go to church, or 

why some people like pepsi while they like coca-cola, i agree...

everyone *is* entitled to their own opinion. just don't look down 

on those people whose opinion contradicts yours.

Libby, keep in mind that the impressions she will form will depend
upon where you take her. For example, there are certain parties that
people will more likely to be on all sorts of drugs than other
parties. For example, Harmony parties (as much as I love them), are
filled with tons more E than something like a Frequency 8 event. The
kind of music and the kind of event typically dictates the type and
the quantity of drugs people will use.

Jungle and Goa parties seem to have the least amount of (noticeable!)
drug use. Not that it doesn't go on; it's just not as noticeable
as people on E.

Maybe a weekly like Mad or Audio Impact would be a good place to break
your mom in. Typically people do significantly less drugs during the
week (I would hope! :); yet the music is still really good, and many
of your friends will be there.

Paul (and anyone else wishing they were elsewhere),

Cheer up.. there can be much more to life than being at raves.  Thing of
the greatest things a rave ever brought you, and think of other ways to
get it.  That way, when you're home, or somewhere else.. instead of
wishing you were at a rave you can find something else to do and enjoy
it in the same way.  The next time you're at a rave, you'll love it even
more.. paying more attention to what it is you really like.

Heck.. earlier I was wishing I had gone out tonight.. and it turned into
one of the greatest nights I've ever had.. playing with sound with much
love and philosophy.

I think it's great that you're tying to share another part of you with
your mother.  I think a good way to do if you're seeing it as a bridge
being crossed by people on opposite sides.. it's not horribly important
who goes how far how fast, or whether or not they end up in the middle..
as long as when they meet the bridge isn't there anymore.  So instead of
struggling with trying to see things the way she would see them, or
having her try to see things the way you would... just think of the rave
as something that you and your mother are both exploring and indulging
in, both in your own ways.

It's great to find something that unites you with her, be it the music,
the people, the dancing.. something you will both enjoy at the initial
plane.  Then branch out knowing that you're both enjoying different
things in the same way, and the same things in different ways.. and
although you are each following your own passions, you have found one
more thing to enjoy together.. to live together.. you've added it to the
list of facets of your life (and facets of you in life) that you and
your mother can go through together.  Wasn't that, after all, the
intention?  Besides.. that's a big part of what the rave culture is

Taking "E" is not recommended for all shy people.

	You must be referring to MDMA, also known as ecstasy or "e."  Some
people use it as a catalyst to unlock the doors that society or personal
situations have constructed within them to prevent them from pouring out
their light and love, and from sharing their hearts, minds, and souls with
others.  After all, this is the land of the almighty $$, and that sort of
behavior isn't in the spirit thereof; it may even discourage people from
the mind-set of greed and encourage goodwill and charity (heaven forbid!).
	No, "drugs" aren't necessary to self-exploration and awareness, but
sometimes they help where other catalysts cannot.  It all depends on the
person.  To paraphrase Shakespear, "The party's the thing."  It's just
natural that, within a social event such as a party, people will do things
they want to do that they can't do just about anywhere else.  Hope this
helps!
Peace,
Eric

	This is a pretty classic example of using a drug in a positive
way. It can show you a side of yourself you maybe didn't know was there.
If you like what you see, then you *do the work* to get to that same 
space *without the drug*. 

	One of the many traps associated with drug use, though, is to
decide, "Well, it's too hard, and besides, I'm not sure I want to
be like that all the time, so I'll just keep using the drug to get there
when I want to."  Trouble ahead for you if you're doing this ...
remember ...

	By the way, drugs can also show you sides of yourself that you 
didn't know were there and that you won't like at all. And you can also 
do work on these things *when you're not using* if you can *be honest 
about it*.

matthew!  i've been so amazed at the awesome people i meet and how darn =
friendly everyone is...it's good to know that there are others like me.  =
i'm one of those people that walks through the grocery store and when =
people look at me, i smile, and then i get no reaction back...anyway i'm =
just thrilled that i do get something back at parties.  enough about =
me....
  so i went to the Janus Project last night with my darlin' Anthony and =
a great friend (Jeremy)...mainly to check out the sac scene and when we =
finally got inside i was impressed.  but it didn't start out that way.  =
we found the mapint....price club parking lot..EEK!  and there were 3 or =
4 cop cars parked by a single car in the lot.  GREAT!  but we finally =
got where the location was (they were now selling tix at the door) and =
went inside.  the first thing i noticed was how NICE AND COOL it was =
inside.  major props for that!  the housey toonage was T-riffic.  the =
2nd dj? whose name i have no idea about was great... a little scratchin =
on the turntable and i'm impressed.  i was getting seriously tired but =
then john howard came on and bam! i hopped up to the front of the dj =
"altar" (shame shame) and got my groove again. =20
  anyway i was surprised but glad to see a cool party like that in =
sac...ohh, i met the guy who threw the party, but forgot his name if =
anyone could direct me toward him i'd be much obliged. =20
  sorry for the drawn out not so technically correct reveiw, but just =

"E" stands for EDUCATION!!!! People who want to have a *really* good time at
raves bring BOOKS to parties! The classics mostly...G.W.T.W., or M.D., or
P.T.M.D. (Gone with the wind, Moby Dick, and Puff the Magic Dragon
respectively for those of you not up with the "Ravers high on E-ducation"
club)...I don't know how it all started but now it's totally out of
control!! Maybe it's the laser lighting that helps people absorb more....or
just the right amount of smiles to stimulate ideal amounts of vasopressin
release in the brain creating lasting memory, or...it could be just the
quiet, relaxing, easy to concentrate in atmosphere. I'm not really sure. One
really cool thing did happen to me a few weeks back tho, I met a
fellow-bookworm-raver that knew all the words to my favorite book, well, ok
fine... it's actually a booklet ok....you know that consumer's free
information guide from Pueblo, Colorado...that sh!t is dope! The ending is
the best part tho....you know the part when the leading male gets into it
with that one Tony Montana sounding dude from the DMV 'cause he's
confused...... "Firs, ju get de permit, den, ju take de test, den, ju getta

...down on Bourbon Street
set up like a bowling pin
knocked down, it gets to wearing thin
they just won't let you be ...

ok, sorry (again) about the grateful dead tie-in, although it always seems
to me there's an appropriate quote for everything (if you get confused,
just listen to the music play)

last night, another west oakland "rave" was shut down by the cops at about
1 am, even though it was at someone's house, there was little if any
publicity (just a word-of-mouth phone #), there was no one else in the
neighborhood to be bothered by the not-so-loud noise, the place wasn't that
crowded or unsafe, and the cops didn't seem to find anything wrong in their
flashlight walk-through -- although someone did say the cops said something
about underage drinking.  I saw one youngish person at about midnight
walking through the party with a 6-pack of Red Nectar Ale, and a couple of
older folk sipping some beer, but very sparse -- indeed, the party was
somewhat lacking in all substances.

I asked one policeman why the party was being shut down and he said
"couldn't tell you," which to me sums up the problem.

We've gone on and on about this, and it's time to figure out what to do
(suggestion # 1 -- no more UG Oakland raves until we get some
clarification). I really want to know what went on last night, and what
justification cops have for shutting down a party in someone's HOUSE, no
matter how warehouse-y the place and rave-y the party.  Don't they need a
warrant to enter a private residence, or is volume and a party enough of an
excuse (or did they get informed consent from the owner)?   Would the cops
have busted my parents growing up because they let me have alcohol with
dinner before I was of age and listen to music loud with friends over?
What if I asked my friends for "donations"?

Enough talking about talking about doing something.

hello all-

[if you don't like nrr posts, go away, because this one is full of the
happines, joy, and utterly rave related material that most consider nrr - mdpkl]

after a rather intense period of dating, my girlfriend and i were talking
about getting married.  why am i so happy?  because on our last
conversation, we really solidified that promise to each other, that we do
want to stay together for the rest of our lives.

no rings yet, we still need to get through grad school together before we
set a date, and that's a while.

anyone ever have that feeling when you know you have met a complete
soulmate?  not just a good friend, a close friend, a person you can a lot of
things about yourself, but a complete soulmate?  well, i have, and suddenly
the world just seems a bit nicer.

some of you have met her, and those who have know that she is perfect for me.

well, now that i have such joy, if you need some, take some of it because i
have much to spare!!!!!

love to you all, and a wonderfully cloudy sunday-

Libby, I am not sure if this is the right Libby or not, but I am not sure
if you know me, but If this is the Libby that was with Anny Ting then I
know who you are and you probably met me before because I am Anny's
friend and Victoria's Friend Paul. I was wearing those blue fuzzy pants
at Freaky People and I made Anny's pink ones she wore to Lepidoptera and
all.


Well, i am gonna go to a rave soon and have lots of fun so i can dance
and listen to cool music.

as far as planning the trip using BART and Cal Train and printing out
maps from the internet and packing my bags and even wrote a I WENT TO A
FRIEND'S HOUSE DONT CALL THE COPS letter to my dad. Then I said never
mind, no rave (except Lepidoptera) is worth this much hassle. Esp. a
massive. 

So I stayed home and dug out all my rave flyers that where everywhere in
my room and put them up on the wall and now I have tons of flyers on my
wall. About 3 yards by 1.5 yards of space on my wall are flyers. And I am
still finding flyers everywhere.

Well, I am going to go to Vallco with my firend Victoria and put some of
that money to good use. SHOPPIN!

Oh, and I bought these bomb ass old skool shell toed adidas, except
they're black and canvas on the sides the stripes are white and rubber
and near the front and the shell toe is white rubber and it has two
tounges on the shoe and white laces.

I also got some cool shirts and stuff...
Talk with everyone later.

If so, please post a review - I'm curious!  Karma 5, Eminence, and 
did anyone go to Resolution, the $5 trance party with Minor Minor and Seth...
wondering if that was the small West Oak party that got shut down that 
Jonathan wrote about...

I was a very non-raver and got ridiculously drunk at that favorite Berkeley 
hang-out, Blake's.  Good band (Dizzybam) playing the ska-funk-rock-rap 
fusion which seems to be a requirement if you want to be an East Bay 
band.  :P

Friday night was spent with housemates in front of a roaring fire. :)

last night, i let myself get talked into going to a rave that i knew was
going to suck.  i can't remember what it was called, but it was in a "home
base" warehouse in oakland, near the airport.

the music was good, but there was no energy there.  the people were there
because they knew that raves were cool, and this was a good alternative to
the palladium.

so here's why i knew it was going to suck:

1.  price over $15.

2.  capacity over 400.

3.  expensive flyers.

4.  celebrity djs.

5.  info-lines in more than one area code.

can anyone add to this list?

raves have become very mainstream and so have all the problems and lameness
of any mainstream club like the palladium.  i find that if i'm not very
selective about which rave i go to, it's really bad.

whaaaatttt??? no energy??? eminence was the bomb... there was so much 
love (especially when keoki was on)... i don't know what you're 
thinking guy, except that maybe you went in there with negative vibes 
because it was going to be a massive.. i loved every second, and never 
wanted it to end.. it wasn't the very best one i've been to, but it 
came pretty close... except that people were getting way too sexual in 
the chill room... i was kissing my boy when some guy put his hands down 
my pants, and i didn't think that was cool... it was supposed to be 
sensual, not sexual like that...

                 much love, hope to see you all at all together now...

>So, what should I do to prepare my mom?  Can anybody out there offer me
>some advice on how to handle this situation?  How about all you
>parents/grown adults out there who go to parties?  Also, how about all
>you "kids" who have taken your parents to parties with you?

	Well, I am one of those "kids". I think you and many others out
there may remember this incident... I know some of you were even frightened
by this, those of you that know them that is. But I took the old parental
units to the Harmony 3 year. I was in much the same situation as you for a
long time until it finally got to the point where I was sick of sneaking
around and worrying that I couldn't get out to do a party... and to say the
least, keeping giant fuzzy flowers and painting banners at home was really
hard to explain. So, I showed them my millions of pictures from parties
I've been to for the past several years, but tryied to focus more on the
ones I've been involved with. They didn't get it at first and thought we
were just throwing parties, not huge "business" like productions with
*real* budgets, contracts, permits, etc. They didn't understand what goes
into it until I took them to one.
	Anyhow, I think I lucked out because I was able to introduce them
to a party that I was involved with. This way they understood that I wasn't
just out to party all night. I was trying to do something and create
something that was important to me. They were totally amazed, to say the
least, that us "kids" could put on a production like that.  You should
consider taking her to a party that you are involved with... like the one
on the 25th... you're still involved right? Just have her there during set
up and the first few hours of the night. Let her see all the planning,
effort and love that goes into it. Just remember to warn your friends
involved to be discreet with "things" the may want to do. This way the
won't see too much of the drug use, if that's what most scares you. Just be
completely open and give them the tour of their lives!!!
	If this is still too sketchy even... I agree with Steve. Just
choose your party wisely. There are a lot of parties out there that seem to
be notorious for drug usage. I think a great place to start her off would
be Mad. It's a club, but it still has the key elements of a really good
"rave" except it lacks a lot of drug usage (well, obviuos usage anyway) and
it ends at 2. There's a few other options out there for fairly
parental-friendly parties. Just find something that you know is low key,
but has all the elements that you want her to see.
	As for prepping her on it, just tell her the truth. Be as open and
honest as you can. Communication is the key here, believe me, I learned my
lesson on this one, it only took me like 6 years!!! I have been working on
my parental units for almost a year now, finally trying to explain what I
have been up to for the past several years and why. Unfortunately, it's not
something that they are gonna grasp any time soon, but with honesty and
openness, (except for that whole drug thing, even though I have slowed down
to the point of like 98% sobriety, I ain't tellin' yet, cuz I know they
couldn't handle it, even if it is in the past) they may soon start to get
it. I know they are trying, but sometimes I don't think they'll ever even
slightly understand... which is fine. But having them know what I do and
respect it, is what's most important. They doesn't need to buy into the
meaning behind it all... though I wish they could.

good luck,
jenn

	p.s. I found that having my parents at a party was one of the
coolest things ever... kind of like that your favorite rave toy. =) My
parents are very old fashioned and straight edged, but seeing them get down
and dirty on the dance floor was really a treat. Well, okay I exaggerate,
but they did groove a little to the music and I thought that was cool. I
just think next time I'll warn everyone that my parents will be around...
maybe out it on the back of the flyer somewhere... "***WARNING*** Jenn's
parental units will be at this event. If you know her and them, be on the
lookout. Don't get caught offguard" (hehehe) Sorry to those of you who got
caught offguard and frightened... those of you who did your drugs early
anyway... Come on! It wasn't my fault... none of you *ever* take your drugs
before midnight, especially at 9 o'clock!!! How was I supposed to know! =)
	I actually want to bring them to another one... hmmm... I think
I'll take them to the next CF! How about it guys? Are you little CFers down
to set up and party  with my parents? =)

Hi to everyone reading,
Since i subscribed a few weeks ago i've been checking my mail constantly,
following the flow of conversations, reviews, and recognizing familiar
names. I checked my mail this afternoon and my great friend mac (like the
truck without the "k") had her introduction to all,  so it seemed time that
i get my name out. 
I'm Matt Davison, occasionaly Matthew (it cutts down on the
confussion when half your guy friends share the name). Over the past year
I've emersed myself in dance culture, grooved to awsome music, and meet
people who make the scene the community that it is. I try to hit a party
every weekend with my friends so say hi if you ever
spot me. Hmm.. i'm tall with short bleached hair...well i'll be wearing my
sfraves badge so that my narrow it down. Hugs to all who can figure out
which smiley face in the crowd is me, hopefully i'll see some of you. Bye
for now, i'll post some reviews in the future (partiless this weekend). 

love to all    -Matt Davison-

	I think maybe you need to focus less on the drugs and more on the
vibe and the family orientation behind it. It just sounds to me like that
is your big focus. I'm sure it's not completely your focus, but maybe part
of the problem is you have been talking too much about it and hoping too
much that your mom will cave and "pop the pills." So much talk about drugs
in the rave seen can definitely sway the misunderstanding parent in the
wrong direction. I also know generally, with parents, they tend to think
that raves are drug fests anyway (thank you 20/20... wait a minute while I
bust out my crack pipe...), but try to let her know the real meaning behind
it all. While it could be cool to x with mom, the focus right now, should
be getting her to understand the scene and how it works and what it means
to you and everyone. Try to explain that not all "ravers" do drugs and most
of them are in it for the community and love that it creates. Your mom may
have changed some of her views, but things like that, especially the rave
scene, being such a touchy subject, is going to take a lot of time and
discussion. Don't expect her to change her views or fully understand you
over night. It may be frusterating, but keep patient and I'm sure things
will work out for the best in the end. Just don't push it too hard.

>I asked my mom if she would go to Mad with me, tomorrow night.  I said I
>wanted her to try to get used to the music.  She won't do it.  She hates
>techno more than anything.  It makes her really nervous, or something.
>This kinda worries me...

	Something else I don't understand... she wants to go to a party
with you, but she doesn't? And because of the music? I'm confused... didn't
you say in your last post that she liked the music? Why the sudden change?
Is it just because she associates it with drugs now? If that's the case,
then she has a lot to learn and only you can help. Maybe you could find a
few "brave" friends to also talk with her about it. Let some others tell
their experiences and try to let her know what it is all about. Or at least
have them write their experiences out for you to show her. I think really,
she has a fear of the drugs and your involvement with them. Which, coming
from a parents point of view and if not educated on, can be a scary thing,
I'm sure. Just try to explain to her that Mad is really low key and mellow.
That the people are not all high and running around going crazy and having
sex on the ceiling. Just don't forget to get her some ear plugs. =)

>Does anyone know of a good, mellow album I could start her out on?  I
>guess I'll try to gradually get her into the music.  I hope it works!

	My parents tend to prefer the Orb, Orbital and Underworld, stuff
like that. My advice is to try to find an album that isn't too repetitive.
Generally people who aren't into it, don't like it because they think it's
too repetative and monotonous. Try something that has a little more
structure to it... some songs with maybe a little more vocals to it and
that changes it's sound a little more than just the same old sample through
the whole song. Something really upbeat and happy.

>When I mentioned that the predominant drug at parties was e, she said,
>"Gee, great.  I can watch a bunch of people having sex."  Augh!  I
>couldn't believe what I was hearing!  I told her that e was not a sex
>drug.  She answered, "That's not what I heard!"  So, I told her

"Harmony... no penetration." (hehehe)
	In reference to your mom thinking that e is a sex drug, all I can
say is try to educate her on it. Not just with your personal experience
because she'll just think your backing it up because you do it and like it.
But back it up with some hard core facts. There's a lot of books out there
and information on the net even, about e and all the other drugs out there.
Read up on it yourself so you know what you are talking about and then go
over it with her... don't just tell her what you read either, show her some
of the material you have been exploring. Just be sure to be able to back up
what you say so you don't sound like you just memorized section 2,
paragraph seven of page 428 in chapter 15, if you know what I mean. Make
sure you know what you are talking about. The key to the universe is
education!!! =)

It is what it is.

Much out there IS commercial.

Some is mindless drivel.

Some is genuine and from the heart.

Even more is there to make someone rich or famous.

True techno isn't just about music.  It's about freeing the preprogrammed
minds of those raised to believe the commercial media is always right and
represents "what people want".  What it really breaks down to for them is
the mighty dollar.  If it will make money they will be your best friend.  If
you too worship the mighty dollar then you too can let them control all you
see and hear.  If you are of free spirit and mind then you will CHOOSE your
input.

In the end, it doesn't matter what the commercial programmers do.  If peices
of the underground are adopted for commercial means then those behind the
underground will push even deeper to escape the mold trying to be enforced
upon them.

Those who know and CARE will remain true to the sound.

Speaking of mainstreaming, stay tuned to Wild 107 for the dance remix 
version of Madonna's "Don't Cry for Me, Argentina."  !

Will EVERY song released now have an obligatory dance version?  And in 
this case, of a song from a Broadway musical!  

I haven't heard it, but someone told me that it is basically the same 
song set to a pounding bassline.  Which (speaking again of the effects of 
mainstreaming!) reminds me of the derivative nature of most pop (or 
"cheez") house of the Wild 107 variety... Originality is practically 
non-existant; every song has a predictable bassline, some echo-y "ping" 
noises, and the ever-present drum roll.  Dance-by-the-numbers.  
Stultifying corporatism.

Interesting that in order to create a new subgenre that will sell, the 
powers-that-be must generate a single sound, easily identifiable and 
packaged as "dance music" (or worse yet, passed off as "techno").  As 
others have pointed out, it is simply the tired old process of mainstream 
corporatizing of the music.  Just like rap originated as a vital and 
creative art form in the underground, its mainstream incarnation quickly 
became an extremely-generic "gansta rap" sound.  Rap in all its 
multifaceted expression was reduced to that proven seller, gangsta rap.

Big labels want proven success, they don't want to take a chance on 
profits.  So, just as any rap group signed was basically forced to adhere 
to a strict gangsta rap formula, Wild 107-type dance music has a 
rigid format which cannot be varied.  And artists are not even required 
to mastermind this format - its rote simplicity allows almost any 
quasi-producer with a drum machine to toss off another carbon-copy dance 
"hit."

The motivation behind all this?  What else, big money.  The music industry
is just another capitalist industry, and dance is but another product to
be sold.  The bizarre thing to me is the hordes of people willing to
consume such generic products, and for years on end.  I was once a 
passionate fan of rap, but I tired many years ago of the slop on the 
radio.  Every new song sounds just like something I was bored of five 
years ago!  Yet others remain faithful consumers...millions of them.  

So cheez dance is here to stay, at least for as long as these subgenres 
can last.  Techno "Evita?"  Not such a surprise!

I'm looking for any ravers that go to Santa Cruz High.
Karma 4 was the first rave I'd ever gone to. It was the funnest
thing I have ever done in my entire life!!! I was the 14 year old
with a Rudimentary Peni shirt and hooded black sweatshirt. I
met a bunch of really cool people there:Nicole, Renee, Leslie,
Mac, and Ran D. Anyway, I sat behind this girl in the chill room
for an hour and a half. The first impression I got of her was
that she looked like a younger Bjork. Long black hair, and lots
of glitter. She was with another boy and a girl. She said that
she was from Santa Cruz and I think I saw her at my school. So
if your out there e-mail me. See ya. Plur,
Dan

Remember "Swingin' to the Eighties"?

It was this collection of songs from the 50's, but with 80's style drums 
and basslines (ie, Rock and Roll).

Hi all  ]=)


 I hope you all had a chance to see the moon tonight (Sunday). It looked 
really beautiful (from Santa Cruz anyway).

 I've just been going through the Hyperreal archives, doing some research 
for a play I'm writing, and I was just really struck by the idealism that 
runs through raves like a backbone or perhaps more appropriately (sp?) 
like a spirit.

 I like to thank those who have letters there in the archives and 
especially I would like to thank the folks at Hyperreal (again) for 
Hyperreal itself. Hyperreal has more than once refreshed my spirit in oh 
so needful ways.

hugz,

Ran D.Dreams

	Dunno if this group can help me much, but if you have any information...
pleeeeze help... Yes, i'm humble enough to beg. =3Do)
	I moved to San Francisco this pat summer to attend Academy of Art. It's a
pretty expensive school, which scared me... I myself am not a very
expensive person. Well, halfway through this past term, I had to drop a
class due to the materials/supplies for that class *alone* costing upwards
of $100-$300 a week - which having dropped it late in the term yielded a
final grade as F - prompting the school to grant me a dismissal. I fought
it to no avail and am unable to attend the Academy this term. Which kind of
sucks because the financial aid from that school was help in my living in
San Francisco.
	Here's where I need help... In order to continue living in San Francisco,
I desperately need to get a decent job (i.e. *NOT* Tenderloin's Carl's Jr.
graveyard shift), and i've applied as many places as I can think of on my
own...

	Does anybody out there in sfraveland know of any job openings????

	I am a phun person who gets along with 99.9% of the world, and if I don't
know how to do something... I learn quickly. My web site is at
http://www.chosen.org ... my email address is iam@chosen.org

	Please help me if at all possible as I really love living in San
Francisco, and would hate to have to move away so soon after moving here...

Hey there everyone...

I've got a question for anyone who was at Eminence--  was it just me or =
was there a bad vibe going around?  I mean, you know how you can just =
walk into a room and sense a bad vibe?  Especially right at the entrance =
as you first walk into the warehouse...  Maybe it's just me, but I have =
noticed that there are more and more "thug" types hanging out at parties =
as the weeks go by...  (perhaps because of the "commercializtion" that =
the scene is slowly falling into?)

I remember back in the day when you could accidentally bump into someone =
and not be worried that they might take a swing at you...  just a =
friendly "sorry!" and a smile would be sufficient....

To me it appears that raves nowadays are becoming more "commercialized"; =
and that more people are showing up not to dance or show unity, but =
instead to "pick up on chicks"... like it was a club or a bar or =
something...=20

Now, I'm not trying to pick on any lifestyle or any particular group, =
it's just that when I try to be friendly to someone by offering candy or =
a blow pop or some water, I expect to at least be greeted with a smile =
or something... not be told, "What the hell???  Get away..."

Other than that, I must say I did have fun at Eminence--  sure, Keoki =
rocked the house, but real props go out to DJ Ghost; who just =
intensified my high just a little bit more with all his killer beats...  =

 Yeah, I recieved the same shit. But I just wrote him back saying I'm not 
a promoter. While his approach is a little tactless (OK a lot) getting 
upset by something this insignificant is just a waste of my time and 
energy. 

 Of course we all know the BA just LOVES to respond to people like this!;)
If it wasn't for morons like DJ Bizz what would BA have to do with 
himself? ;)

Look at the facts: Bill Clinton signed into law the Salvage Rider,
allowing even more irreplaceable old-growth forests to be destroyed, and
refuses to reform the 18-something Mining Act, which continues to give
away billions of dollars worth of precious metals on public land for
literally pennies; Clinton signs the "Defense of Marriage" act, denying
homosexuals the right to be treated the same as "straight" people;
Clinton continues to advocate censorship for the Internet (the CDA) and
the country; the defense budget continues at Cold War levels despite the
lack of a cold war; Clinton continues to fire or muzzle anyone who calls
for the long-overdue legalization of hemp (including Joycelyn Elders,
possibly the best Surgeon General we've had); how long a list do you
want?

Politicians are very good at making you _feel_ like they are serving
your interests, via carefully crafted speeches and platitudes. 
Meanwhile, they serve their own interests and the interests of those who
helped them to power.

Words don't matter.  Actions do.

Well Resolution was in West Oaktown and did get shut down. Bummer it was 
a good party. I had a good time seeing old friends and meeting new people 
for one and a half hours befor OPD rolled up. I hate to say this; 'cuz I 
used to be in a motorcyle gang with the guy whose space it was, but what 
a death trap. One exit; one fucked up, skinny stairway to the ambient 
room; folowed by another skinny door to the chill room. The PA was good, 
the music was OK, the vibe/people were great, lights were minimal ($5 
whadayu want?) I was having a great time until OPD showed up. The cops 
were smilling and friendly, so I tried to give one a tootsie pop, but he 
wouldn't take it. I would happily go to Resolution again if it was in a 
safe, relatively bust free space.

well, i checked out the emminence massive. it wasn't as bad as i thought 
it might be after hearing the cool world horror stories. the hardcore 
acid mix in the laserium part of home base was awesome. the main stage 
was happening but a bit sedate at times, with throngs crashed on the 
sidelines. my only negative experience was when my backpack loaded with 
bubbles, glow paraphernalia, and unfortunately my pet trible and marmot 
jacket disappeared suddenly. so goes life in the big city.

I'm having trouble with my EMAIL account and I think it may shut down
within the next 2 days.  I'm sad to say that at that time I will lose
connectivity to these lists.  But not to fear, I'm seeking out a new
ISP...
if anyone has advice on a good ISP that I can use with my Mac SE (yeah
yeah, enough already), I'd be glad to hear about it!
Also, if anybody needs to get ahold of me, you'll have to use those old
traditional pre-internet methods.  So, if you need me or if I owe you a
tape or something, you can write or call. 
:)  PLUR!  I'll see you all soon, I promise :)

Emminence was a cool world party...?!? 


Fuck! The only way that Wa*** (the cool world promoter) is going to
fucking learn is when people stop going to his parties!!! Keep supporting
his robbery habit, and he'll keep ripping off innocent people that just
want to party! Wa*** has been at it for about five years, as I've heard
from my friends that have lived here that long...


It really sucks too, 'cause if he would get all the DJ's he books... even
if he doesnt, he can put together a pretty kick ass party! Except for the
love that keeps a party going until 11am, anyways...


BOY-COTT COOL-WORLD!!!

Remember this statement when you are forced to wade through a morass of
crap to get to your *real* mail, because a bunch of folks see you as a
market to be exploited....

I do not love to respond to this crap. I wish it would not enter my
mailbox in the first place. In posting publicly, I hope to let people know
that this sort of unsolicited advertising is not appreciated. YMMV....

  Well, basically, all I've got to say is that that is what the clubby 
sound is - UNORIGINALITY!!!  Take some vibe - speed it up - crank some 
bass etc. into it, and hey... guess what?  If you play it - they will 
dance (usually b/c many ppl @ the clubs are drunk and don't appreciate a 
really original vibe).

Sounds like a completion bond in the movies. Pays off the cost of the
producing the film if it can't be completed for any variety of reasons.

Dear Steve & SFRavefriends,

        Somehow I seem to have not been receiving email from the list for
the past week or so, so if there has been discussion of this issue during
that time (and I assume there has!) I have missed it.  Indeed if anyone has
saved posts on this thread since January 4 and can forward them to me, you
have my gratitude.
        Regarding support from the Libertarian Party, I was not suggesting
that this project take on any partisan affiliation, only that we look for
help from those who share our concerns.  Libertarian party support for the
anti-CDA (Communications Decency Act) movement opposing censorship of the
Internet has not resulted in this movement taking on a partisan aspect; I
think parties are usually savvy enough to realize that co-opting a movement
like this will not serve anyone's interests.  If the Democrats,
Republicans, or anyone else wants to help reform the laws that lead to
busted parties, we should welcome their support too, imho.  Frankly I doubt
you'll find as much sympathy from any other party, but hey, I could be
wrong.  I mentioned the Libertarians because I'm involved with them and
familiar enough with the party's positions to know how they would likely
feel about the issue.
        As a matter of fact, I brought it up at the San Francisco
Libertarian Party meeting last Wednesday, and they agreed to put the topic
on the agenda for next month's meeting on Weds. Feb 12th.  This will be
held at Freedom's Forum bookstore, 1800 Market Street at Octavia, at 730pm.
I hope that a lot of SFRavers will show up and demonstrate our concerns on
this issue.
        The fear voiced by those present on Wednesday was that ravers might
be all talk and no dice, so I hope to prove them wrong and show that we do
care about our freedom to dance enough to actually do something about it.
        One constructive suggestion that came out of the meeting was that
we need to go to a law library and do some research on the state or local
penal codes that may apply to our problem.  This would be a necessary step
in the drafting of any ballot proposal to revise the law, as our proposal
would have to address the wording of current applicable law.
        In any event, we have our work cut out for us, and I think we
should welcome the involvement of outside allies.

May the bass be with you,
                                        <<< Starchild >>>

Agreed!  Even in spite of the negative attitudes I felt among some of the
staff, a couple of less-than-friendly (uh-oh, here comes that word
again!) "gangsta's," and the occasional lull in vibe, I thought the tunes
from the "laser room" **rocked**!  I spent practiacally the whole night 
in or near there, since I haven't heard any thick, syrupy melodic bass
like that in ages!!  All I can say is WOW!  And I managed perfectly well
to have a *blast* dancing like mad!  (Please note, though, that I'm also a
sucker for bright, shiny objects, and _nothing_ beats a 1500W laser in
that dept.!  Except maybe TWO 1500W lasers!  Yeah!)  ;)

For me, the key to having fun lies in the heart of the individual, in the
feet of the dancer, the mind of the philosopher, and the ears of the
audiophile, not in the "hard" glares of those who choose pretense over
genuine emotion.  Together, many individuals can share this common bond of
simply having fun, and thus, we have "the vibe."  :)  And I thought that
there were enough positive people there, just having fun, to keep up a
nice vibe in spite of any of the negativity lurking.
Kudos also to the breakdancers (helmets and all!); I totally miss seeing
that stuff!  Man, that *really* brought back some 80's memories!  And
kudos to those of you out there who *did* help set the vibe there!  I love
you guys!

Not bad, overall; I personally had a whole lot of fun, and amazingly
enough, it didn't get broken up (at least, until after 4am or so, when my
ride had to leave, I'm not too sure about after that...)  Okay, well,
enough ranting for now; much pLur-

What a great weekend!
	Karma was at "the space" on stevenson again, and yet, they 
did as promised and sold limited tix. Even though there were half the 
people this time, it still was sweltering in the main room, hot 
enough to.. say.. fuck up the sound system around 3 am? oops that 
kinda pissed off thomas trouble right in the middle of his set. the 
people though, either hung around, or someone with drums sat around 
playing them while people clapped and danced :) it was a great party, 
less negative vibes than usual, and the chill room was *gasp* 
DECORATED! boomerang played a great set in there, as well as some 
russian guy from galactic tunnel who spun near the end and was 
playing (sorry) better than the stuff up on the main room (the music 
was kinda slow for awhile up there, kinda hard to dance to around 4 
am) and that meant people dancing in the chill room. oh my god i 
thought i was going to die! either that or fall through the floor... 
earlier they cleared about 15 people out of the room cuz of the 
safety hazard.. i just think they should close that room altogether, 
as much fun as it is to hang out in there, and make the front part (past 
the bathrooms) the chill room. i went outside and went on a walk with 
eric and understood how the building was movign to the beat. tons of 
people working the party kept telling the dancers in the chill room 
to stop because it was dangerous but they didnt stop. :(( scared the 
shit out of quite a few people! anyway, i would have to say big-ups 
to Mars for an incredibly PHAT set, and to the last dj (sorry didnt 
know you) for the last song played of the night, it was BEAUTIFUL and 
the BEST way i've heard a party end in a long time :)
	WAIT im not DONE YET! sorry this is so long. i went to 
jonas's afterparty, wondering "TREES?! is this OUTSIDE?!" and well it 
was INSIDE and so were some trees.. and candles.. and a huge rug on 
the dancefloor.. Well yay! I love this spot! i loved the party so 
much,ambient jungle and whatnot being spun all day, really very 
relaxing to hang out at especially after a party :) they had fruit, 
fruit juice, muffins, chai, and later on lunch for sale, and it was 
really great. I can't wait to go again, I want to thank Jonas and 
everyone else who worked on it for the great idea, and for the place 
to hang when home/bed just didnt' sound like the thing to do quite 
yet... Everyone DEFINITELY should check it out come sunday, whether 
you're coming from harmony or another party, or if you're just bored 
on sunday and want to hang ... cuz it goes 9-4 :) i'll be there! 
	So thus ends another great weekend... Peace and Love, and 
HUGS to all! :)

Ha ha!  That's great!  Turning the vibe around, one cop at a time.  But
maybe he thought it was laced with some evil psychedelic drug?  You know
what drugfests all raves are.

Yes it would be a "catastrophe" to lose contact with SFR, even just for a 
few days, right?  This is probably the most addictive drug in the rave 
scene, IMHO.  ;)

I just finished writing several reviews on the weekend events, as well
as a few personal voices and my experiances in general on my weekend...
Just to see *Blip* power surge, and All of my reviews are now just a
memory... 

Uhh, yea. 
 That pretty much sums up my weekend.  Well, some weekends are just like
that ( i guess). I've never been looking so foward to a Monday just so I
can finish this Saturday and Sunday of hell.

I need to get out and start on a high note for this week.  

C - U - @ - MAD...

Since I received a response from this person calling me a "bitch" I can
only assume that he is not going to stop this kind of activity. Sendmail
8.8.4 has some great new filtering capabilites that allow you to block
people from our mail servers altogether. 

<Sys Admin mode>

I don't like spammers. Our customers don't like spammers. I add filters to
prevent spammers from bothering myself or our customers, which is what I
have done in this case. So now there are 3000+ people less that this
person can pester from his current account.

hello all sfravers-

tonight, monday night dinner is at a San Francisco classic restaurant,

Kan Zaman, on haight street, south side of the street, just near the
intersection of haight and shrader.  

prices:  i have been there millions of times, and each time, without fail,
i have paid $10 / person which includes food, drinks, and a possible huka
for those who care (what's a huka, you ask?  come and find out!)

dinner will be at 8:30 pm, but i need to make reservations.  so please call
me at 753-2978 and leave a voice message detailing your name, how many
people are coming with you (just yourself is fine, but guests are welcome
and encouraged) and the date of your last doctor's appointment.  (sorry,
wrong mailing list, cancel that last one)

please call me by 4 pm, and i will gladly make reservations.  also, call
for any further details.

love to you all, and i hope to see you soon!

love-

matt lanier, official sfraves cheesemeister

if anyone went to our party, happy kids, on friday, in w. oakland, i'd 
like to hear some feedback and opinions. it was our first party (we're 
keeping "happy kids" as our name) and i'd like to hear how anyone who 
went liked it. i just joined sfraves last night (sunday) so i might not 
have seen anything that was posted regarding happy kids prior to 
midnight sunday. anyway, thanks for coming out, whoever you are, and 
keep spreading love everyone. come be happy kids next time!

much love, ian

IMO, human beings and other life forms, are constantly using chemicals. In
some cases, people choose to intake or abstain from certain chemicals,
because of their reactions to them. They all have different aspects and
affects. Some people might consider alcohol, tobacco, nicotine, caffiene
and even chocolate to be substances which people abstain from, use or abuse
to be drugs. You might even consider hot spices, which have obvious
metabolistic affects on humans to be a drug. Simply because these chemicals
are recognized by our law enforcement officals as being legal, is not to
say that they are good or bad for you at any level of consumption, persay.

There is a good book on these topics, for those of you who are interested:
Food of the Gods. I can't seem to locate the book right now and can't
remember the author... oopsie. ;)

Ok I guess we can call this take #2.


"Action"


Hello dear raver,  let me tell you about my weekend...  If not, then
just press the delete key.  I really won't mind.  Actually I really
wouldn't know (so there)...
(Wow, sass on a Monday)

Ahem, pardon him... Ok, take my hand and let us drift back to....


                                                 Friday  
After work (6'ish) I boogied down to a small pub (City Pub - Redwood
City, off Brodway @ El Camino) for a lil birthday celebration between a
co-worker and some friends.  Nice little gear up for the nights
festivites, dispite my abstension (sp?) of alcohol... Round seven or so,
Mr Pager started telling me the natives (i.e. raver friends) became
restless, asking "which party Im going to be at" and, "can I get a ride"
and "who's spinning at where" and blah blah blah.  So I make my exit and
arrive in Fremont to change my dud's and finalize the eve's plans...
Off to The City @ 10 or so when disaster strikes.. In order to avoid a
possible accident, I run my car up a curve and not only manage to blow
out BOTH driver-side tires, but I also tweak out one of my rims enuff so
that I'll need a replacement.  (uugh).  So here I am 10:40PM.  Dead car.
 Friends expecting me in SF.  A party starting up in OAK.  Bills are
calculating in my head very very fast.   hmmm....   
I say "Sod it, I AM going to a Fuc*ing party!"  And start playing "pager
tag" until I manage to get a set of wheels and an amped crew to go
dancing...

__Happy Kids__  Got there @ 3am and headed straight to the dance floor
Thomas T was on the wheels spinning some hard trance, then to goa, and
then to some kind of music that I was totally unfamillar with.  I would
really like to take the time to say "sorry" to anyone that might of
caught any negative vibe from me.  Despite the party being in a great
place (looked TOTALLY UG, fresh warehouse and all), the crowd had no bad
vibes at all (I remember @ one point all of us dancers forming a circle
and just acting like kids, happy kids), I was in a different frame of
mind...  Only stayed till about 5:30 but had a great time while I was
there.


Saturday:

Spent all of my daylight hours trying to get the car fixed.  I will not
go into detail (I don't want to relive it all)...

Night-  Hooked up with some friends and began our journey to
_Resoultion_.  But a page kept us from getting there.  It was Deepfog
informing us of a 420 Party in San Jose.  After convincing my pals that
allthough it's a house party it'll be cool we head down to the place.
Arriving @ 9:30 or so We meet up with a few SFR'ers (hey EZE, ect al.).
Our numbers total a bit over a dozen.  Some decks are up but we're all
generally 420ing it (hence, a 420 party) and chatting.  Talk to one of
the _koinonea_ DJ's about the eurotrance and goatrance scenes in SF and
the underground in general. A few other promoters are there and
conversation turns to more specific party type details and other stuff
that makes sense on other states of consusness.  However, my friends are
more on a phyiscal plane and want to dance, so we bail and make it
to....

_Resoultion_  @ 11:30.  I remember this mappoint, thinking it would be
cool to throw a party here.  I guess I wasn't the only one.  The main
room (downstairs) was what caught me and tossed me into that abysmal
abstract world of music.  Dancing hard till the end (i.e. bust) I really
didn't look around but noticed an upstairs lounge (chill area?) where a
bunch of people were looking down to us crazy dancers.  The lights were
nice. The house, comfy. Not too hot, not too crowded. All in all a very
well kept secret. When Oakland's finest came to visit I honestly though
they might just let us rave in peace.

hah.
ha ha.
yea right.

But they were nice in shooing us away...  My friend and I lost our ride
in the  process (actually the driver bailed once he saw the police and
then managed to get lost in Oakland for a few hours).  Allthough several
of you offered rides to _Eminence '97_, I figured that I'll try to get a
hold of the driver that skated on me.  So we (my friend and I) paged the
driver, with directions, back to the site and motored to one of my
secret hidey holes until 5:30 or so chilling out.

Site Bustabillty Table for Oakland fisical year 97':  2 for 3 so far.

Sunday:  I don't wanna remember (But I did get my car fixed! ---For a
not-so-slight denominal fee which I won't disclose, to myself even).

So all in all I pretty much had a hellofa rollercoaster ride...  I love
being a raver!

Hope to see some of you @ MAD tonight....

HI SFRavers!!!
I will lurk NO MORE (couldn't resist jumping into this one):]
The infamous author of Food of the Gods is Terence McKenna... I might also
highly recommend Pihkal: a Chemical Love Story by the Shulgins and thE bible
E is for Ecstacy by Nicholas Saunders! Just hop onto Hyperreal to check out
sections of both books and their extensive collection of chemical info and
links!
PLUR, LunarLiza

P.S. I moved here in September and the fist thing I did after getting off
the plane from Boston was to go to a CCC beach party...SFRaves and the Goa
Community- YOU are my San Francisco and I'm never leaving! 
(((|)))

It's 4am...do you know where your kids are raving???

WARNING!  THIS IS VERY NON-RAVE RELATED!!

The reason I'm sending it to you is because I consider SFRaves to be my
extended family, and sometimes you share something with your family
because you're utterly outraged and you want them to share in your
outrage.

I have a web page that, along with a slightly out of date rave diary,
contains some of my personal views.  Among those views are my opinions
and beliefs, right or wrong, on racism, gun control, and pedophilia. 
Occasionally I get comments on these, but the other day I got a message
from someone that just blew me away.  I was stunned.  According to his
letter, he's an Uzi-toting, racist, pedophile that believes...

Well, rather than try to describe it, just hit the following page.  It
doesn't contain the full text of the messages -- if you want those, let
me know and I'll forward them to you.

And do me a favor: if you feel as strongly about this as I did, send
CSmith a note telling him how you feel.  I got way too pissed off and
found I couldn't keep from really getting vulgar when replying to this
guy.  Hopefully you guys can help me out here.

Thanks and sorry if I wasted your time.

	Or, jungle and goa parties, since they are somewhat more 
specialized, attract a crowd that is a little more discrete about it, a 
little more mature, a crowd that is basicly the same whether on something 
or not? Some parties draw a crowd that changes when they ingest or inhale 
psychoactive substances and then people go back to "normal" in the 
morning, other parties draw a crowd that take things but don't change 
much... Draw your own conclusions on why this happens, I have mine...

OK, I'm a semi-lurker, so here goes!

My first rave was a Friends and Family back in 1994 or so.  Since then I've
been raving infrequently at best.  When I do rave I like to help with setup
since I was a stage crew nerd in high school and never recovered.  There's
a good energy that goes with creating the space.

1996 was a very quiet year for me ravewise; most of my life energy was
consumed with matters of the heart.  That all went through big changes at
the end of '96, and I'm still reassembling myself, but '97 looks to be much
more open energetically.  I'm looking forward to helping throw more parties
this year!

I'm deeply into high-energy thickly-layered music.  I'm developing a mighty
taste for jungle.  Here's a question for you all:  I have a CD named
"Deep Into Jungle Territory: A Jungle-Bhangra Fusion" that in my opinion
kicks ass (some tracks off it, at least).  Anyone recognize it and have any
other recommendations of DJs or CDs with a similar sound?

Raves, for me, are one of the best ways to party... the Dionysian energy is
mightily addictive, and the holistic consciousness is terribly copacetic,
compared to a more standard beer-and-cigarettes type scene.  I'm also quite
into the local sex-positive community, which throws my _other_ favorite kind
of parties, but enough about that.  Why would any free spirit want to live
anywhere other than San Francisco?  (And what a paradox:  shouldn't a free
spirit be free to live anywhere?  Am I just a herd-mentality follower, and
not a free spirit at all?  Yet humans are social animals, and we groove on
those who groove like us....)

I'm good at hacking software, and I like designing software an awful lot--
it's an avocation and a vocation.  Ideally I'd like to build systems that
many people worldwide wind up using to communicate and relate in ways that
help them grow.  That's the fundamental goal of life as the Buddha saw it:
to save all sentient beings.  Can I truly translate that into a career?
I'm going to keep trying....  (See http://www.unreal.com/robj/xancurs.htm
for one early such story, and www.communities.com for the latest version,
should you care :-)

Looking forward to doing many wonderful things in 1997, and anticipating
raves as part of the rich pageant!

Just a reminder, I'm still on the hunt for a used pair of 1200s, or at this

You should put the full text up on your page.  If you really want to invite
the entire sfraves community to participate in your flame war with this guy,
you should go whole hog.  Otherwise you're asking people to flame him based
on _two lines_ of actual text from him, plus a lot of agitated commentary
from you.  Not very fair to him.  (And if you feel he doesn't deserve fair
treatment, well, what does that say?)

>And do me a favor: if you feel as strongly about this as I did, send
>CSmith a note telling him how you feel.  I got way too pissed off and
>found I couldn't keep from really getting vulgar when replying to this
>guy.  Hopefully you guys can help me out here.

How can we help you out when we don't even know what you're replying to?

And more basically, what kind of help are you _really_ asking for?  You
don't need anyone's help to tell him what you think.  If your problem is
that you don't want to be vulgar in responding to him, that's a problem
you really don't need anyone else's help to solve.

I think that you're feeling pretty upset and that you want us to help you
flame this guy because... well... because what?  How, exactly, will many
sfravers flaming him help anyone?  How would you feel if this guy posted
your emails to a white-supremacist email list inviting hundreds of them
to send _you_ flame mail?  I wouldn't be surprised at all if he does just
that in response to the many emails you're encouraging us to send him.  
Then perhaps it'll escalate and we'll have a full-on flame war
between sfraves and the white-supremacist list!  And wouldn't _that_ be
productive?

If you want to flame people like this, why not just go to the Usenet group
alt.politics.white-power and have at it?  Why involve all of sfraves?  If
any folks from here do decide to join SDream in flaming this bozo (and
please don't think that I don't agree that he is an evil bozo--I do think
him fully bozotic), make it clear that you're a personal friend of SDream's,
and that you're not doing this "on behalf of the SFRaves community."  This
will help avoid making sfraves the target of a white supremacist mailbombing
campaign.

(SDream, are you really shocked there are people like this out there?
Haven't you gone surfing for white power pages, or for child sex pages?
They're there for the finding....)

>Thanks and sorry if I wasted your time.

Just be careful you don't invoke more hassle than you really want.

I spent a couple of years wholeheartedly flaming the shit out of gaybashers
on alt.politics.homosexuality (and this during a time when I was pretty much
completely straight).  It was great!  It was cathartic!  I got lots of kudos
from people who liked what I was saying!  And I made no impression whatever
on the gaybashers--or at least on the gaybashers who were doing all the
posting.

Flame wars generally don't make much difference to the participants.  If
one piece of email could change your whole worldview, it's likely that
your worldview is barely settled enough for you to flame about it.  And if
you're ready to flame your ass off, it's likely that your beliefs are
settled enough that mere words on a screen won't make much difference.

Communication and education can do a lot of people a lot of good... but
flame wars generally involve neither true communication nor true education.
They tend to be more useful for developing rhetorical skills and for getting
some aggression out.  But for me, I lately prefer to spend my life energy
on and with my friends, working on projects that'll make a difference for
all the people whose lives _aren't_ yet driven by a particular dogma.  Flame
wars are like banging your head against a brick wall... eventually your head
starts to hurt a lot, and you've only broken a few chips loose.

IMHO, anyway....

Wow!  It must be that time of year or something -- my girlfriend and I

  Thanks for the formal welcome, Eric. *hug* :) I appreciate the invitation
for introductions, it's a welcome I never received on mw-raves (unless it
got lost in the heaps of e-mail) and it makes this list seem a whole lot
more friendly. ;) I think I already, briefly, introduced myself. BUT, never
being at a lack for words (or an excuse to ramble), I will go into more
detail... :)

  I go by matter, my birth name is Matt. My brother and sister have been
living around the Oakland area for a few years now. I grew up in Harper
Woods, MI (east of Detroit) and lived there for 23 years. The past 6 years
I have been living in the Chicago area. Yes, your abacus is functioning
properly, I am 29. ;) I plan on moving out to s/f to take over the world
with my brother, Ed. I should be moving out there in the next few months.
Of course, you all will have a little time to prepare while we put our
plans in motion. I would imagine the world will be safe for another six
months, or so. ;)
  I have been going to partys for about three years and prefer hard techno,
hard trance and acidic goa over all over music. I am (I think) very
open-minded and enjoy listening and dancing to just about everything. I
have a habit of having way too much fun and frequently giggling
uncontrollably. I am also somewhat of a dichotomy and enjoy philosophy at
great lengths. I spent alot of time in the Detroit club scene between the
ages of 16 and 23, which explains my fondness of the harder techno and
acidic music styles.
  I am currently working at an insurance company in Chicago. I work in the
I/T department and roughly 400 of us support 30,000 systems at 250 sites. I
have worked in the slave, uhm, I mean systems, industry for about 11 years.
I am hoping that I will not have to keep a corporate-type job, after I
move. :)
 I spend my time with partying, marital arts and working on my original
music. I play keyboards and guitar mainly, but also dabble in bass, drums
and various percussion. My music and some nifty pictures are available from
my web site below. I also have some experience spinning CDs.

Here's to san fran! (psyched) :D

Hi all,

I spent New Year's Eve at the Cloud Factory bash, my first rave ever.  What
a great party!  One of the things that made it so special was this lovely
woman that I hit it off with.  I gave her my email address ("I'll mail you
tomorrow") but haven't heard from her :( so I'd like to make an effort to get
in touch.

Her name was "Jenna" (not sure about spelling).  She was down from SF,
originally from Iowa, said she was a physics student.  Brown hair, brown
eyes, she was wearing a cute blue or purple dress with a black leather
jacket and red Docs.  She had come with a guy who had something to do
with the visuals crew.

Ring a bell with anyone?  Any assistance is greatly appreciated!

Rob,

Good advice all of it, but to answer one of your points:

> I think that you're feeling pretty upset and that you want us to help you
> flame this guy because... well... because what?  How, exactly, will many
> sfravers flaming him help anyone?

During that time that you were bashing the gay-bashers (good for you,
BTW!)
Didn't you *once* feel that you were showing them that there were some 
intelligent and articulate people out there completely disagreed with 
them and could present well thought-out arguments as to why?  Do you 
really think that not even *one* of them stopped for a moment to review 
what it was that they were standing for?  To rethink their position?

>  How would you feel if this guy posted
> your emails to a white-supremacist email list inviting hundreds of them
> to send _you_ flame mail?

Bring'em on.  Yeah, that may be asking for trouble, but hell, if I was
worried about that I wouldn't have posted my views in the first place.
I admittedly post things that I know won't be met with wide approval.
I sometimes cringe when I think of the responses I'll get, but it's 
how I feel, and I felt strongly enough to say something, even if it's
just an emotional regurgitation, like my feelings on parking tickets or
the "3 Strikes" law.

> If you want to flame people like this, why not just go to the Usenet group
> alt.politics.white-power and have at it?

Good idea.

  Why involve all of sfraves?  If
> any folks from here do decide to join SDream in flaming this bozo (and

A true bozisimo.  8)

> and that you're not doing this "on behalf of the SFRaves community."  This

Folks, that is a very good point.  Please, if you decide to flame this
guy,
please don't do so because I said you should or as a representative of
SFRaves.  It's just that I know there are people in our family that feel
as
I do, that you sometimes have to fire right back with enough support to
make
the bozos of the world stop and reflect for a moment on what it is they
stand for.

> (SDream, are you really shocked there are people like this out there?
> Haven't you gone surfing for white power pages, or for child sex pages?
> They're there for the finding....)

I guess I just don't go looking for them.  Yeah, I know they're out
there,
but when one walks through your front door, it's always a bit of a
shock.
I guess I expect them to stay under their rock and leave the more
intelligent 
people of the world alone.

> But for me, I lately prefer to spend my life energy

A very wonderful approach.

Oh, I don't know, it's not so bad when I bang it to the beat...  ;)

Also, about your comment that I should put the full text of  the
messages
on that page -- point taken.  I'll update that page.  By censoring the
messages, I do a disservice to those that read it.

ok....fine...I guess I have satisfied my voyeurism on this list by now...
So here comes a lengthy introduction of myself...I suggest the easily bored
press "delete"...


Let's see...my name is Kevin....I am 23, I moved here last September to
start work doing multimedia stuff...
I grew up in Dallas, TX...lived there until I was 18 and then moved to
Austin....
By that time I had started going to a lot of clubs and getting into the DJ
culture....
But once I was in Austin I really got into it...myself and a group of
friends started throwing some great raves....that was a really fun
time....The atmosphere was a lot different back in '89-'93(not that it is
bad now...).

Well, after too many late nights and to many drugs, I slowly moved away
from that scene and more into the indie-rock scene, which I had also been
into for a long time...
I started a band ( we were into the My Bloody Valentine/Slowdivey/spacey
British style stuff) that lasted for over a year...but then we broke up, I
graduated from film school in '94, and was off to London.  I spent a good
year working for a film production co. in London before I decided to stop
being an illegal alien and move back to Austin.  Well, after HTML coding in
Austin for a few months, I got offered this job...doing digital audio and
video for CNET: The Computer Network....
Anyway, I am stoked to be here in SF...it's a great city....
UNfortunately, I moved out here alone, have been working quite a bit since
i moved, and of the few friends I have had time to make, not many are into
this scene...
Hence, I have not made it too many parties....But I want to badly!
Also...although many have expressed opposition, I think that the Thursday
Noght Booze-fest sounds like a lot of fun....I'm definately gonna try to
make the next one...
I would like to check out the Harmony party, but do not have much info. on
it or tix...
SO hopefully I will be able to meet some of you guys soon....
Well...I guess I will stop babbling now and let you get back to your life...

Thanks for reading...hope to see you guys soon.....

Did you ever read that letter from the people of the ill fated Nation
party? According to the letter. Willie didn't allow them to have their
party at the original spot because he felt that scence his son was a DJ
he would be best to 'distance' himself  so he wasn't playing favorites
(or something like that, you'll have to look it up).  But from what I'v
heard he hasn't been too suportive.

Well Andrew,

   It's pretty simple really... 
           MTV is mostly music oriented.
         Although they do not use musical instruments, they do use
instruments for making music. Which in our society classifies us as being
musicians.
        So....  Bla, bla bla, bla, bla bla bla, bla..  Bla bla, bla,,, bla,
bla bla.




Just kidding..

 Actually...  You got to remember.. MTV right now    has this vision. They
think that Techno music is going to be the biggest explosion in music
since.... since... Since them damn Englanders got credit for creating rock
-n- roll...    And there vision is probabaly 20/20.
 I am sure that MTV is forking out alot of cash to promote this electronic
break through. And thoughs Chemical Brothers have every right to make as
much money off there career, as do any of us.
 And it is becoming a career four shore. In my opinion, as little as 1,000
fans is a career. The more fans you have, the less time you will have. Now
you are dedicated to your fans. Theres no time to become a lawyer now.
Might as well sign on with MTV right?


What yea think?
Jeff

THIS IS STILL NRR, AND THIS WILL BE MY LAST POST TO SFRAVES IN THIS THREAD.
Sorry for shouting, but I know that continuing this thread here is already
pushing it, NRR disclaimer notwithstanding.

The guys I was flaming?  No, I don't think any of them rethought anything
whatsoever.  If that had been my goal I would have gotten pretty depressed
at my profound lack of progress.  None of them, to my recollection, ever
changed their points in any significant way.  Flame wars are not rational
debates; they're shouting matches.

And you're comfortable including sfraves in that dynamic?  I'm not.

I agree with this in general; if you feel moved to flame a racist bozo,
go for it.  But don't think that you will succeed in making them stop
and reflect.  I've seldom seen a flaming e-bozo whose mind worked like
that.

>I guess I expect them to stay under their rock and leave the more intelligent

Rest assured they feel the same way about you :-O

Sorry I got sick of hearing about MTV.  MTV will never change there
format.  they will just keep following a mainstream change.  MTV andf
the rest of the yahoos are about 3 to 5 years behind what there tarket
audience is into.  Unless you live in Kansas, MTV is played out.

	Let's see. Some of us had a lengthy discussion with a couple of 
them. One of them was the bad boy cop who "likes to things just like this", 
the other was the duty officer. Please note that both like to "party".

	The main reason that they sited for busting us was money was taken
at the door. Because money was taken at the door, it was a business and
businesses need permits. There were no permits so the "business" was shut
down. So we argued that these were donations and things should then be
able to continue right? First, they thought any type of donation system
was basicly a pile of shit - if money is taken at the door, it cannot be
called donation, you have to have a basket or, I guess it was termed if we
"passed the hat around", money would not have been an issue.
	Item number 1, if money is exchanging hands, the local governments
want some. Fair enough, I will make a personal contribution. More than
half of the budget for the party?! How do we pay for things like rent for
the space and space prep (something like $3000 will put sheet rock in the
place so we are not getting covered in insulation), sound maintance (I
have this little container I put all my money into which goes to things
like drivers that get blown up at Burning Man because certain jungle DJs
from the Bay Area think red lights are pretty and then refuse to help pay
for woofers that get fried in the process - sorry, I do not flame people
often but I still kinda sore on that one, or work on cabinents as the wood
gets pounded into flakey bits, or new equipment to get more sound out of
the same system, or fix amps as capicators and transformers degrade from
heat), power bills, and lighting? 

	So then the second thing that came up was alcohol. The promoters 
should have been checking ID so no minors could have gotten alcohol, a 
system of hand stamping or the like needed to be in place.... Promoters 
were not serving alcohol, no one was "serving" alcohol. This had no 
impact, there was at least 2 six packs of alcoholic beverages found at 
the site (which was someone's home, their stuff was neatly tucked away 
for the party). So even everyone should have been marked to make sure 
that no minors recieved a sip of those 2 six packs...
	So then we have a lengthy exchange about obtaining permits. First 
the place is not up to fire codes, first real peice of "law" that we can 
be busted for I guess. Then we talk about permits more, about difficulty 
in obtaining, about run around, about how stupid it is to need permits to 
have more than 50 people come into your house (now how do coops and the 
like have 100+ person parties with money taken at the door? Nancy?). Then 
one of the cops says something about "maybe they are trying to discourage 
you from doing these" in this snickering tone of voice... Is that their 
place someone asks and we get no answer...

	Here we deal with the a thread that has been touched on and 
confronted quite often - how does one deal with the spread of something that 
has meaning to them which will most likely lose its meaning in the method 
that will be employed to spread it (radio stations, MTV, what's the 
difference?)... Whenever a message is spread without the experience that 
allows that message to be understood, how do people expect to have people 
take that message into their lives if those people were to choose to do 
so? But that right there should send light bulbs up over everyones head's 
because MTV is not trying to spread any message except buy the stuff in 
the commericals between the videos.
	So who cares what MTV shows? What is all this worry about about 
MTV screwing up raves? How is it going to make it any different than it 
is currently? Raves attract a great range of people to all kinds of 
events. There is a range of promoters out there as well, from greedy to 
people who pay out of their own pocket to make parties go off. How is 
that going to change?
	I guess more people could find out about some smaller parties. So 
people might have to be a little more careful about where they drop 
flyers and people who go out might have to be a little more careful about 
causing a scence but these are skills that most people hopefully already 
have if they are going to renegade type parties, or any illegal parties 
really (my judgement sorry).
	My judgements aside, what are people really worried about? A 
message not getting across because the people who "get it" out number 
those who "don't"? Possibly a valid point depending on what your 
definition of "getting it is", and how the party is promoted. Are people 
worried that they just cannot here someone listening to house or techno 
and assume they must be cool? If so, I think MTV is a great thing because 
it will force raver types to learn to take their plurry concepts and test 
them out (ok, sorry, that is another judgement on my part)... Back to the 
question. Are people worried that more artists will be selling out? Look 
at labels/artists like Network 23, look at the FNB party at Ceasar's. 
Those guys don't have tons of money, there are not million dollar 
contract bearing label people breaking down their doors, but they made 
people dance, and the people danced to 165+ bpm for over an hour. That is 
unheard of in SF....
	I don't have a TV let alone cable to get MTV so I could care less
what MTV plays. I will keep doing what I do, and hope there are some 
other people doing the same types of things at the same times... If the 
cops keep pushing me further away, I will keep setting up a system behind 
Travis Air force base and hopefully people will still be willing to drive 
that far...

	Hi all --

	I'm Jason, but all my friends call me Zza.
	This has to do with the frequency and quantity of pizza I eat.
	I've actually beat a larger opponent in a pizza eating contest,
	but we both agreed it was the dumbest thing we had ever done and
	will never do it again: so no challenges!!  Chicago is my Mecca.
	Well I guess we all have fetishes...

	I've just moved to SF from DC (actually Centreville VA) and have
	added to my truths of life -- 

	The grass _IS_ greener on the other side of the Sierras.
	(I've been told this actually holds multiple meanings)

	My other truth is --

	Everything is better with techno.
	(Probably won't get too much disagreement here, but I was able to 
	persuade my buddies in DC when after too many hours of Olympic
	figure skating and gymnastics I hit mute and played some jungle)

	

	Anyway...
	I always seem to be wearing some horizontal stripe surf T-shirt, 
	comfy airwalks, and some sorta pants. So say hi!


	PLUR

	Zza

Perhaps the fear is as you have answered it: that things will be a little bit harder.
After all it is nice to have things easy in your life.

Hmmm.  This talk of protecting parties from busts becomes increasingly
difficult with further growth of the scene.  Although, what about falling
under the protection of religous rights and the freedom to assemble?  A
true rave very much resembles or some might say _is_ a religion.  The same
people attending week after week and contriubting their "tithe" to support
the "church."   There certainly are leaders -  the dj's, who in other
religions would be considered as shamans or priests administering the power
of togetherness to celebrate life through musik.   An very familiar
attribute given to dj's...especially if he/she knows what they are doing.
Many more analogies can be made, I'm sure.   Stretching the truth?
Perhaps.   It seems fairly close to me.   Convincing authourities is an
entirely different matter.   Heathens, we would be called.  These busts
sound a lot like the stories we were told as children of the "communists"
shutting down churches in Russia.  Call me crazy.  It's been done before.
:)


BTW, someone extended an invitation of introduction.  I've been mostly
lurking for the past few weeks but I recently moved with my girlfriend to
the Bay Area from Greensboro, NC.  (no, not everything you've heard about
NC is true <g>)  So a belated hello to the list...I look forward to meeting
many of you.  The stories of F&F parties and Sunsets have been told around
many a early morning afterparty even 3000 miles away.

Hi all!  ]=)

 I finally got around digging my tape deck out of storage where it was 
sitting with the rest of my equipment. So the first things I doz is check 
out the fresh DJ Moda tape I recieved from Sir Moda.

 Phat, fresh and clean!  =) An immaculant (sp?) tape (no rude noises) 
with some _tasty_ tracks on it. An interesting progressive house blend 
that manages to be happy AND intelligant. NOT an easy trick!

 I was really swimming during some of the tracks; wish I knew the names 
so I could tell you more. Side two at about 5 minutes into it is _really_ 
fun. I highly recommend this tape if you like progressive house!! the 
opening of side one has some _nice_ ambience to gently lift you off.

 I would like to hear some of this kinda stuff at a 
Harmony/Tigger/Beautiful People party sometime! Are you listening Greg 
and Matt?

 Nice cover on the case also. I'm sure DJ Moda has some more tapes. If 
you send him a blank you could probably sweet talk him into running off a 
copy for you at no charge.  =)


peas,

Check this out from the SOCAL rave mailing list:

<<I was at Shell last night, and they had this brand new female attendant.
She FUCKING ROCKED!!! The whole gas station was jumpin.. Whistles goin off,
people goin nuts! But, someone brought out the air hose tank and started
passing out balloons. All you could hear was that annoying hissss all night.
It got
busted around 8:00 pm.

Fuck those owners!!! They're not true to the gas-station scene. They're just
there to take your money, and get you away from the island as quick as
possible. They didn't even pay their mechanics. Beware of these shady
stations, it's hurting us more than you know...

Next time you have a party and the police come, go outside and shut the
door behind you and ask them what they need from you. When they give you
shit, tell them this is a private party in somebody's residence and you are
willing to observe noise rules, etc. but you are not ending the party AND
THEY ARE NOT INVITED INSIDE.

With regard to liquor, it is perfectly legal for a minor to consume liquor
inside a private residence, so that excuse it right out.

If they give you any trouble, go back inside and lock the door behind you.

If they break down the door, teach them the meaning of "direct
representation style democracy" and pop a few caps into them! As G. Gordon
Liddy says, "Aim for the head in case they're wearing body armor."

And lastly, make sure that they fall *inside* the doorway so that you can
make the claim that you were defending your residence from attack from
intruders.

Fucking police.

Hi all!  ]=)


 Well, I'm just about ready to flip. It might be that the news that I'm 
about to share with you all may come to naught but oh to have the chance...

 Some of you out there may have heard of Richard Sun from the Ambient 
Temple of I*Magi*Nation, Mystery School. Richard was a big developer of 
the ambient scene in the chill rooms of SF's bigger parties during the 
heydays of, say, 1990 to about '94? He has a few CD's out. I have his 
first (Mystery School) which I often use in chill rooms.

 Richard and crew were performing at The Gathering just a little while 
back (with yours truely putting in a guest prformance).

 Anyway, Richard has asked me to represent ATOI here in the SF Bay area 
while he is living in Portland Oregon. I'll be popping over at GaiaMind 
to help out there. Richard has also mentioned that he _may_ be touring 
Europe this summer and if he does he would like me to go with him and 
perform also. (!!!!!!!!!!!!!!) wow.

 Anyway, it seems the seeds I've been sowing with Dionysus Dreams may be 
finally coming to fruit! If I do get a chance to go I'm certainly going 
to want to check out the psi-trance scene there. I would especially like 
to get over to Israel but that may be out of our way.

I'm soooooo fucking excited!!!

smiles,


Ran D.Dreams

	Oh right! Sure, I'll do that at my house. <sarcasm alert!>

	And when the cops gets pissed off, and come in anyway on some
plausible pretext, and find some of the illegal things that some of
the people are holding, I'm sure you'll be the first say "Fucking police."
as you slink away as unobtrusively as possible.

	As long as it's a drug scene, the PLUR-balls are going to cave
in every single time they're confronted by the cops. 

	If those who will trade freedom for security deserve neither, 
what do those who'll trade their civil rights for a hit of E on Saturday 
night deserve?

You want to work security at the next party? =)

Enquiries were actually made to the OPD about having a "private party" and
their line is that if there are more than 50 people it requires a permit,
private or not. I still think what we need to do is work on a long term
plan of getting ravers to become police officers and work in other
positions in city governments...infiltrate and coopt.

I don't know about Wayne or anyone else, and I may not be a PLUR-ball (this
probably proves it), but I'm happy to say "fucking police," and I've said
it before and I'll say it again, to their very faces.  And yeah, it'll get
you beat.  I've been beat, fined, jailed, probated, and fucked with by
every instrument The Law can command.  But I'll keep on fucking with them
just the same.  Because I don't care about The Law.  I don't care about the
law, I don't care about legality, I don't care about government, I don't
even care about morality, good and evil, right and wrong...that's nothing
to me.  I live my life the best I can.  Hagbard Celine (someone here knows
who I'm talking about, right?) said that true freedom is the ability to
say, "No."  What happens doesn't matter-- consequences are external.  If
you can say no, if you can accept the consequences, all of them, all the
way up to and including your own death, then you are truly free.

Lucky for me, the way my society is arranged hasn't required me to face
death, yet (no, I don't know if I could face it and maintain...please don't
bother asking).  I live as hard as I can for my own ideals within my own
situation, which probably makes zero difference to humanity-- but I would
stand up to police for a party.  I maybe wouldn't write so stridently, but
this message happens to come at a time when I've been dreaming (or
fantasizing is maybe the better word) about a party that really would stand
up to authority and make the case for its own independence.  I'm not a
promoter, I don't know anything about what's involved, but that's what I'd
like to see.  Fundamentally, I want to see people, individually or as
groups, not just claiming but *demanding* responsibility for themselves.  A
rave is a perfect (but far from the only) example of a situation in which a
group of people have insulated themselves from the rest of society/humanity
in order to live as they see fit-- that's one of the things I like about
raving, in fact one of the things I think is essential to raving.  That's
the spirit I'd like to see spreading.

I guess the question now becomes, can they site a law to this effect? Is
there something on the books that says >50 people = permit, or is this
something our benevolant enforcement branch has taken upon themselves to
decide?

     well, this is useful information.  i've kinda always had an inversion

hello everyone,

wellll, i went to see parents for the holiday/new year thing and was starved
for a jolly friendly party. and, ick ick ick, was i misssing everyone here!!!
i would read about all the super events happening and only be able to imagine
all of you wiggleing and grooving to the funky beat. 

SOOOO-> when i was not completely wiped out after taking the red eye from
D.C. and then working the next day i ran real quick to my  most favorite
monday night spot, MAD! (well, actually i was getting ready for sleeping when
i checked my mail and Ms. Sarah had sent me a note "come to mad!!!" how could
i disobey?)

anyhow, mad was especially wonderful and filled with smiles! thank you
everyone for still being here and making my return sooooo grand!! 

and, this friday is F8. the post/flier says tickets available the day of the
event. does that mean the day, as in 9-5, or in the evening? if it is 9-5
could some nifty spiffy person who does not work then pick me up a few
tickets? thanks!! eme if you can...

well, okay, see you all soon, jumping shaking squirming grooving wiggleing
and pounding to the hilariously fine vibe!!

*hugs n hugs*

IMO, this is kinda taken to the extreme, on both Rob and wayne's parts. Not
a flame, jus' trying to find the balance. Isn't there a balance somewhere
in the middle? My rambling version would go something like this:

  The pigs show up and they are pissed. They are banging the crap outta
your door. You go to the door with at least two of your friends
(witnesses). Go outside and close the door (good thinking, wayne) No matter
how much of jerks the cops are, the three (or more) of you are totally
cooperative and friendly. They will calm down if you remain calm. If they
insist on entering or busting the party, kindly remind them of the points
wayne has already mentioned and tell them your not interested in having
them join your party. I'd say "ya know, I think most officers are a lot of
fun, but we already have a few inside". ;) There is really no "plausible
pretext" for them to enter your house. Defending your civil liberties
doesn't mean you have to kill them.   You could simply pick up the phone
and call the ACLU or your lawyer. ;) Actually, I have found that calling
the police in advance is a good idea. You can ask them about some parking
regulations or something and then mention you are having a little party and
give them your name and phone number, "in case there are any noise
complaint". The lazy cops will love you for it. Now they can sit in their
office, eating donuts and drinking coffee. When they get a complaint, all
they hafta do is pickup the phone, easy. ;) Little work for them to do at all.
  If they bust the door down and you have witnesses, the city or somebody
is going to have to pay for it, eventually. AND, if u have enough money you
could prolly take 'em to the supreme court and make some difference in some
way. BUT, IMO, if u r cooperative and kewl with them, they will leave you
alone. I usually find a mix of respect and complete lack of fear work best.
  I guess, that I think: once they are in there and everyone is freakin'
they have you by the nads, but if you don't fear them, they have no power
over you. Most cops enjoy the power trip that they attempt to exhibit. If
you don't feed their power trip, they get no satisfaction. Offer them some
candy or something nifty and spread the love. That will really blow their
minds. Pigs need love too. :)

Don't believe the hype. I think what we all need to do is pony up some
cash for a consultation with a civil-rights attorney to find out what our
sometimes seemingly non-existant rights are on these issues. The police
will walk all over them if we are ignorant of them. 

Please offer any suggestions of questions that should be asked, and if you
know the name of a good civil-rights attorney, let me know. I am willing
to put up $100 towards answering some of these questions. Any donations
towards the consultation gladly accepted. All questions that are
posed/answered will be posted here for the benifit of us all. If others
are interested in attending, please let me know.

I for one am tired of being ignorant.

  Sorry, Pengo. I checked the site and I have to comment. It was well put
together. However, I completely disagree with the statement that is is
intelligent. I can think of only one intelligent or positive thing about
gang membership or the screwed up things that happen because of them. The
only positive I can come up with is graffiti. I do like graffiti. BUT, to
consider that I may be shot because of my warddrobe or a handshake I
share with a friend, is an indication of exactly how stupid gangs are.
This is one site, which will not be appearing on my link list, ever.

  Why don't these kids just telnet into vrave or find something REALLY 
constructive to do? ;)

Mailing list annoucement: SFR-legal (sfr-legal@saturn5.com)

A couple of weeks ago, I proposed a new mailing list to organize some
action in the city of San Francisco to end the criminalization of our
rave scene... Well, I received quite a bit of response, so it's clear
that there's a strong need to get this going.

With that, I present the new mailing list:

sfr-legal@saturn5.com

(an offshoot of SFRaves) This list will serve the role of providing a
forum for discussing what is legal or not and what sorts of changes
can be made in the effort of saving our scene. In addition, it will
serve as a way of organizing meetings and generating some political
action in the city of San Francisco.

To join the list, please send email to:

sfr-legal-request@saturn5.com
with a single line that says "subscribe"

(the standard majordomo commands will work)

Or, alternately, send mail to majordomo@saturn5.com with the line:
subscribe sfr-legal <email address>

Note that all messages will have the tag SFRL: in the subject line
(great for you filter folks). Please also note that you if sent a
message previously asking to be added to the list, you will still need
to subscribe through majordomo. Also, all messages are archived. I
will eventually create something on my web server for downloading
these archives.

I hope to see many of you loudmouths ;) on this list subscribe. I'm
not looking for high volume, just a group of highly outspoken and
motivated individuals who care enough about the rave scene in San
Francisco to help generate some change and clarify many of the issues
with respect to the legality of throwing parties.

Finally, this is not a "down with the Man!" sort of thing. It's time
that we start to acknowledge how important it is to act responsibly in
accordance to existing laws, while remembering at the same time that
we have the right as citizens to actually change the laws that govern
us.

Thanks!

Steve

Okay Joe, show us the way....I'll give you a hand, here's the Oakland
Police Cadet web page:

http://acorn.ci.oakland.ca.us/Oakweb/police/cadet.htm

Better dust off those old Chcuk Taylors though:

Physical Agility Test. The physical agility test, which is pass/fail,
 measures coordination, agility, balance and strength. The test consists of
 eight events performed in an "obstacle course" fashion which must be
 completed in two and one-half minutes. Candidates in reasonable physical
 condition usually are successful in this portion of the examination.

Excuse me, but Probably Cause of-or-for what?

Do the presence of turntables == the presence of underage kids drinking? I
have turntables and a mixer in my home, and I am 30. There are never
underage kids drinking at my home (and it's *still* none of the police's
business if there *are*) although there is often loud thumping beats coming
from my place.

rule #1. No matter what, do not ever, ever invite the police inside any
place, -any- until they tell you exactly what their probable cause is to
require entry. They are required to tell you. And once you let them in, you
have effectively waived your rights to privacy. That means if they wander
around your house and see something else that is suspicious, that is
admissable because you invited them inside. The same goes for your
automobile.

I really think that we need to talk to the ACLU about this before assuming
much more else.

This description of a way to manage the police is a little more what I was
hoping for when I went 'postal' back there in my earlier message. I don't
actually advocate violence toward police, but I was trying to emphasize in
a very extreme way that we do have certain rights to gather in private in
our own homes. In this case, I think someone should have at least kept the
police outside of the residence. Once you allow them in to look around, you
have effectively consented to a search of your place (or car, etc.) that
you are not necessarily compelled to do. Because the police hears music,
they don't have the right to see if you are charging (or accpeting
donations, for instance) or if there are minors present, although it seems
that younger people are more easily intimidated to let the police infringe
on their rights more quickly than adults seem to allow.

I have had parties in my place before, and even with my place slamming and
bursting at the seams, I met them *outside my unit, outside my building* to
discuss their concerns, and for the most part, it worked. In one case I did
have to tell about half or more of the people to leave due to crowding but
the party did not have to end "just because they said so."

I think it would be a really good idea to find a civil rights attorney that
could either do some pro-bono or reduced rate work to find out just what
are rights are in say, San Francisco and Oakland so we're not simply hoping
or guessing what are fate is or should be next time we're visited by the
police. With specific rights info in hand we'd have a much better time
"managing" the police next time they show up at one of our homes with a
party-in-progress or one of our underground events.

I work for a nonprofit specializing in civil liberties issues, so I am
going to try to find out if there's an easier way to have a party if you
are say, a legitimate non-profit corporation. I would not mind throwing
parties that benefit one or more of that type of organization. Would you?

oops, i've been posting on this list for a few weeks but i haven't
introduced myself...my bad
Hi I'm Kawai Petrie Carvalho. I've lived all my life(18 yrs) in hawaii.
I was a fat kid in junior high, had bad hair, and was really white for
being part hawaiian. but time passed and I got over that, and met this
girl kim-ann foxman...she was a raver, i mean is a raver. so she took me
to a rave in hawaii, but i couldn't dance,(especially near her, becuase
she was one of the best dancer in hawaii at that time. oh my god she
went off), but well to make a long story short, she moved to sf for
school, we broke up, I needed direction in life, and so i came here.
(it's cold today) 
so well I learned how to touch the music(or the music touched me, and it
told me what to do. now I've found jungle and I'm doomed.............
love,
petrie

All right, time to get out of the woodwork, I guess. I'm Ed, and I just
moved up to the City from Los Angeles, where I've been for the last five
years or so. I work at Sony Interactive down in Foster City, where they
make games for the Sony Playstation.

Love the City, love the raves, first one I went to was about four years ago
around Thanksgiving held in the Design Center which was great. And I've
been to some here and there, every time I come up to visit. Recently, went
to the FTT one in Oakland at the Home Base, which I dug, and the Planet New
Year, which I didn't. Oh well.

Love music, love dancing, used to be a radio dj back at the University of
Michigan, but haven't done much since. Oh well.

organized crime units. generally but not exclusively made up of members

somewhat and are moving into the "corporation" phase.  Most real gang

Yeah, okay, so I got way too emotional about it. I should have taken a
chill before I wrote... oopsie, next time. ;) I just never was in and
will never support gangs. As you might have guessed, I have very strong
feelings about it. I am also not interested in changing my habits or my
apparel, because of a potential mistaken association with some gang. I
already have a hard enough time deciding what to wear and how to act, in
general. ;) Furthermore, it is not now, nor will it ever be an interest
of mine to be able to tell which gangs are which or who hangs with who...
So, I prolly shoulda jus' kept mah big mouth shut... ;)


On the upside, I can appreciate the positive impact that this site is
trying to provide. AND I got some good information about graffiti.
Thanks, Geoff! :D

Just wanted to put in my $.02

this is in reply to the "busted" string

Partying...well "party's".....are very important to me and like hell if i'm gonna let the cops strong 
arm and intimidate us into throwing less of them.  I believe that they are probably thinking 
somewhere along the lines of "if we hassle them enough they'll just give up.  They're just a 
buch of punk kids without any motivation or intelligence."

I just think we have to persevere-sp? and not let them win.  If it means going more 
underground, then let it be so.  Or we really need to learn the laws that govern us so that we 
are not taken advantage of.  If we are educated and know that we have a right to assemble, 
and are following all city ordinances or laws, then there is little that they can do to stop us.

I REALLY love the scene and all of those involved in it, and would like to see it flourish.  ( in a 
non-commercial way of course).  I have put 5 yrs of my life into it and am willing to put another 
5. (well, in some capacity).

Thanks for listening,
Micron

Yes, yes,  I strongly encourage all those that are going to go, to
arrive early and buy thier tickets...  

Reason: Once it sells out I can rush to the party since I'll be doing
mappoint till whenever (and I wanna DANCE on Fridays).

Seriously, drop by and say 'Hi" so I can match more names to faces (this
is cool, it's like a real-life version of MEMORY. I know you remember
that game: when you flip over all these cards with faces and try to
remember the location of the matching faces and blah blah blah...).

>I've got a question for anyone who was at Eminence--  was it just me or
was there a >bad vibe going around?  I mean, you know how you can just walk

is slowly falling into?)

Totally!!!! the vibe at Eminence was VERY scary. I did not enjoy it at all
(the vibe that is) I kept walking all over the place trying to find
somewhere with 'good vibes' but it was sooooo hard to do so. The Chill out
room was a scary place to be in, it was
dark and unfriendly. everyone was in their own selfish world and that I did
not like.
I enjoy going to parties where everyone can be in community and where
everyone
shares the best of themselves to everyone. Eminence was definitely not it.

>I remember back in the day when you could accidentally bump into someone
and >not be worried that they might take a swing at you...  just a friendly
"sorry!" and a >smile would be sufficient....

Totally...It is scary when you bump into someone and they say either "what
the fuck?!" really loud or they look at you as in a weird manner. Talk
about having
a bad trip!!... I even say "I'm so sorry," and they basically either ignore
me or
they mumble something rude. :(

>To me it appears that raves nowadays are becoming more "commercialized";
and >that more people are showing up not to dance or show unity, but
instead to "pick up >on chicks"... like it was a club or a bar or
something... 

YUP!..my friend Becca got 'cruised' a lot at Eminence. They wouldn't leave 
her alone. :( I mean..its OK to meet people at a party, but its not ok to
go
there for that only reason. To *meet* people as in a 'bad intentions'...A
lot of
people now a days go to parties for the drugs and the 'chicks' (as you 
mentioned above) that is the wrong reasons to go. 

I go to raves so that I can meet new friends, have new experiences, and
share
the best in me with everyone and make everyone happy, and listen to music,
and dance all night long (or socialize all night long). Drugs I take
because I choose to. I don't need them to survive nor do I need them to
have fun :). its kinda like
when you go to a bar, some people choose to drink, some people don't....

>Now, I'm not trying to pick on any lifestyle or any particular group, it's
just that when >I try to be friendly to someone by offering candy or a blow
pop or some water, I >expect to at least be greeted with a smile or
something... not be told, "What the >hell???  Get away..."

Totally!!! That is why I didn't give out candy at Eminence unless the
people I talked
to (no very many that night) greeted me in a good way. I mean, when I tried
to say
hi to people most of the time I got a reply in a rrruuudee tone of voice
like: 'go away' but they enver said it. kinda like 'leave us alone'. and
that disappointed me :(

>Other than that, I must say I did have fun at Eminence--  sure, Keoki
rocked the >house, but real props go out to DJ Ghost; who just intensified
my high just a little >bit more with all his killer beats...  

I did have fun also :o) Keoki did indeed have a good set... why did he stop
the
music though? he totally stopped it for like 15mins... 

Peace and Love to all!

Hello beautiful raver peoples,

I apologize for posting without introducing myself first, but I'm at a new
job so's I need to keep this short....ish.

  A much younger, non-raver me used to have a job that required working with
the police on a daily basis, not just any police, the Oakland Police.  For a
time an extremely naive me was going to be a cop. Ugghh!

  There are certain realities associated with  trying to stand up to the
fuzz that little to do with our civil rights.  Probable Cause is defined
very loosely in Alameda Co. especially in Oakland.  This is ostensibly
because of the "crack scourge"....damn those plumbers.  If, in the course of
my previous job, I needed a car or even a residence searched, all I needed
to do was tell an OPD (Oakland Police Dept.) officer that I believed
contraband to be in that car, or on those premises. Now this was usually at
the end of an investigation, so I had my facts straight, but still, on the
word of an ordinary citizen they will break down your door or pull you from
your car. 

 If they don't have a PR's (person reporting) complaint to manufacture
probable cause, all they have to do is say that the odor of pot is present
(whether it is or not) and they have all the probable cause they want.  I
know of several officers who would use this as an excuse they wanted to
enter a premise with out obtaining a warrant. 

Obviously, not every cop bends the rules like this, and I quit my former job
about 3 years ago, so things could have changed. 3 years ago the night shift
was so busy (under staffed) that "expediting" due process was almost a
necessity keep on top of the huge volume of calls on a weekend.  Not an
excuse, but a reality.  If a certain kind of cop wants to bust an unpermited
party, or enter a residence where he thinks something illegal is going on,
he will just do it and make up a good reason later.

Just my two cents, I got more, but I type REAL slow.

                Chris

I think this is a wonderful concept. WE are a secret society, in some
sense, and many ancient "secret socities" have realized the benefit of
diversification. Each individual's talents are available to the group for
the benefit and advancement of the whole. I know there's some folks out
there who can help with all kinds of things... This could be something big.
A union of the cooperatives and of the rave scene world-wide may be the
first beginnings of true world peace. :D Hmmmm, I have an idea. A www site
with a skillset matrix index by locations for members-only access to
ravers. :)

        A number of people have mentioned more formally determining what
our rights are, and I am willing to research this issue and/or help out
whatever civil rights attorney who might agree to assist us (in case you
just joined us, I formally "came out" to sfr as an attorney a week or two
ago).  I'm not a civil rights attorney myself, but I'm confident I can at
least determine the municipal and possibly state laws that are relevant.
I'm in a weird period of my life right now -- I'm going away this weekend
for a week to visit my parents and have to prepare for the trip, and
meanwhile I have a job interview this week, one when I get back, and I have
to clean out my current office (my job ends this week).  I'm pretty sure
that I'll be hired when I return and have to hit the ground running.  In
other words, don't expect the Bay Area Raver Legal Guide for at least a
couple of weeks  ;)

        I intend on initially focusing my research on SF and Oakland, and
relevant California laws; Berkeley, San Jose, and other locales will come
soon enough.  I've gained a little more insight into the excuses the police
use to bust parties the last couple of days, and I thank Dave Bayer for
giving a good account of the Resolution 5 closing.  The following seems to
me to be a good list of issues:

        Business permits -- what constitutes a "business;" how can a party
that wants to charge people get away with it if cops arrive (invitations,
pre-sale tix only, donations?)

[As an aside about Resolution 5, my sense is that because the entry door
was open and it was probably visible that the people were taking money just
inside, the cops do have the right to then demand a permit from the owner,
and then shut down the party if one isn't provided.  There is a "plain
view" exception to the warrant requirement for a search of a house (i.e.,
if a cop sees you breaking a law inside a house, he doesn't need a warrant
for a search).  But just hearing music loudly shouldn't rise to the level
of that exception.]

        Fire codes -- how many people per square foot, numbers of exits, etc.

        Noise restrictions -- what decibel level at how many feet outside
the party; reasonable neighbor complaints.  Wouldn't it be great if there
were a noise complaint, and then you could go x feet from the house with a
decibel meter and prove to the cop it wasn't too loud (or, wouldn't it suck
if there's no legal way to have a party with even a little volume unless
there was enough soundproofing to silence an airplane)?

        Other Health & Safety -- need for insurance and security, "social
host" laws (what happens if your guests take drugs at your party and then
crash into someone while driving home under the influence)

        Dealing with the Authorities -- what to do when the cops show up.
Wayne's advice is exactly what I've heard -- speak with the cops outside
the space, with the doors shut, and in a calm, civil and reasoned tone,
explain everthing you need to make them understand there's nothing to worry
about (private party, only x people, we'll keep it down for any noise
complaints, no sarcastic humor if the cop asks about drugs).  If memory
serves, Tony Rotundo posted last month about how he successfully dealt with
cops outside the WOMO party, and it was pretty much along those lines.  One
other possibility, if the cops are patently unreasonable, and there are
plenty of willing, non-drug-carrying volunteers who plan to do this in
advance if needed, is passive civil disobedience -- sit down, refuse to
move, and let them carry you out and arrest you for disobeying their
illegal orders to leave. This category should also cover when search
warrants are necessary.

        If anyone else can come up with more topics, I'll try to explore
them as well.  Please please please send me any information you might have
on the above topics -- if anyone knows ANYTHING about, say, SF business
permits, even if it's just the number of a statute, it will make things
easier.

        The obvious caveat is that knowing your rights isn't always enough.
If the jerk cop Dave posted about was frustrated by succesful people at
the door giving him answers that wouldn't allow him to legally enter, who
knows whether he would have found a way to enter the house and shut the
party down, illegal or not.  I want to be proactive, so we can be legal and
avoid confrontations, but often rights are protected only after they are
violated.  Rogue cops can really hurt our scene, because it takes a lot of
money and energy to redress illegal activity upon the part of the police.
The police know this -- and yes, it's exacerbated by the drug use in the
scene, which makes people willing to forfeit their right to party in order
not to have to confront the police.  The more we know, though, the more
likely we are to avoid this scenario.

p.s.  my web access and knowledge of hyperreal archives is lame, but I
wonder if there has been any general work on (to paraphrase a bad 80's
song) "the Politics of Dancing."  If so, this would be a good start to my
research, and I'd love to know.

p.p.s. just saw chris porter's post about the OPD ... a cop still should
need a search warrant or an exception to search a residence, although
someone's statement that he believes there to be contraband in a residence
could convince a judge to issue the warrant (it shouldn't be an exception
to the warrant requirement, like seeing a crime in plain view). But the
point is, the cop breaks the rules, busts a party and arrests people, and
then those people's lawyers have to explain that the search was illegal and
none of the evidence can be used against those charged.  By then, it costs
us money, energy, and time, let alone parties.

We (the JL) did a party a couple years back where there were neighbor
complaints regarding noise levels and the SFPD came to check it out. They
were very friendly and we turned the sound down to a level acceptable to
them (and I assume legally acceptable). However, they remarked that even
though they were ok with the noise level if they were to receive a second
complaint they'd be required to shut down the party nonetheless.

Thanks LJ!  Here's my limited experience.  I'm pretty much one for one with
the long arm.  They are really good at putting words into your mouth, and
talking in circles.  (Like the:  "So what drugs are inside...")  The
absolute best things I think you can do are these:

1)  Have no money what-so-ever near the door, or even a price on the ticket.

2)  Get your story straight in your head and everyone elses head.  If you
say it's a free party, make sure someone else doesn't say it cost a dollar
(trust me!  =).  If you say it's donations, make sure everyone says it's
donations.  Mixed messages=lying, and that blows your pitch out the window.

3)  Have a clear-headed representative, and that person should come right
out, introduce themself and ask how they can help.

4)  Cooperate.

5)  When cooperating fails, beg.  =)

6)  Have as much of the truth on your side as possible.  That is, for WOMO,
my friend WAS moving his software company into the new space, and it WAS
his moving in party.  That helped.  I could look Tim (the officer) in the
eye and say, "This is a FREE party for our software company that is moving
in."  Looking left and right at the crowd of people from a busted party
nearby that were swarming the door as he approached Tim replied, "These
people don't look like software types to me." I just shrugged and said,
"They all came from a party that was broken up down the street, and they
think there's a party here."  He asked the address, we shook hands and he
split.  Never to be seen again.  [Actually, I was certain a swarm of cops
was on its way, but they never came.  In that event, we were going to keep
the door closed and just not open it..."Okay everyone, you are not allowed
to leave!  Everyone parties until dawn!  Wo-who!"]

One other point, the whole, "I'm gonna be a tough guy and not open the door
to them, etc," is very, very difficult to pull off.  I tell you, when they
come walking up and you know the balance of the party is in your every word
and action, it's a fast fucking lesson in nerve control, ya dig.

Here's an important point:   You need to make a fast judgement as to
whether you fight or fully cooperate.  If you make a stand at the door,
then right there you are saying that you are going to make it difficult.
You don't want to throw that trump too early.  You don't want to be all
brazen and surly right up front.  Feel the cop out, and then decide if
he/she should do a walk through or not...

If you know you're breaking the law (600 people), be nice and as
cooperative as possible.  If you're at a small house party, then I'd be
more apt to take a stand.

Out!

Legit neighbor complaints are one thing -- they always will be heeded by
the police.  But having the police on their own accord shut down a party
without neighbor complaints because they think it's too loud is another
(not that I know that this HAS happened).  I'm also thinking about the
potential excuses that rival parties might use to bust other parties --
someone finds out about a party they want to bust, and then they could
complain to the cops about noise even if they aren't in the neighborhood.
It would be great in the latter two circumstances to have a legal defense
on the spot, if possible --  my example was more wishful thinking.  I threw
this in because I'm pretty sure that official local noice restrictions are
based on decibel measurements in addition to complaints -- but I'll find
out for sure, won't I, now that I've publicly committed to doing this ...

Hi folks!  =)

 First off I would like to congratulate Steve, Jonathen and all the others 
who are involved in this project. It really warms the subversive cockles 
of my heart. (you figure out what that meant! ;)

 Talking to whats-his-nose from Acme, he was saying something to the 
effect on Art Galleries or Art Shows have some sort of special waiver or 
conditions concerning public gatherings. I really don't have any details 
(sorry!) but I also seem to recall the fire marshall as stating as long 
as there were less than 33 people he didn't care at all what was going 
on. (this was during an Acme bust)

 I realise this info may be of no use but on the chance it might I wanted 
to pass it on. Please keep up the good work gang!!

 Oh yeah! I know as certain DJ out there is a laywer. I highly encourage 
him to get involved in this project if he hasn't already. You KNOW who 
you are buddy! Thanks for the tape!


hugz,

</bigger></bigger></bold></center><bold><bigger><bigger>Welcome to the
Realm of Natural VLF Radio (0.2 - 11 kHz)</bigger></bigger></bold>


 =20

 VLF listening site in the Black Rock Desert, Nevada, 22 September
1996.  WR-4B VLF vertical whip antenna is attached to van on its rear
door.  This is the VLF receiving system and expedition "accomodation" I
have used for the past 4 years.<bold><bigger>

Q: What Is Natural Radio? </bigger></bold>


 <bold>A: Natural VLF Radio - also called "Natural Radio" - are
audio-frequency radio signals of Earth in the approximately 200 Hz to
beyond 10,000 Hz (10 kHz) spectrum which are not man-made but occur
naturally in nature. Most of the best phenomena are heard between 400
Hz and 5 kHz.</bold> =20

 <bold>Many people who are not really "radio nuts" or "techies" but who
love nature have listened to Natural Radio either live or recorded and
have called it the "music of Earth itself." To listen and enjoy Natural
Radio, the audio-frequency radio waves must be converted directly to
sound via a receiver like the commercially available
<<http://www.triax.com/vlfradio/natradio.htmwr3e.htm> WR-3E.</bold> =20

 <bold>Lightning storms, Earth's magnetic-field (the Magnetosphere),
and the Aurora Borealis and Australis (Northern & Southern Lights) all
produce an amazing variety of electromagnetic "sounds," such as
<italic>sferics</italic> (lightning-stroke static), tweeks,
<italic>Whistlers</italic> of countless variety, the incredible
<italic>"Chorus</italic>" chirping, barking and squawking sounds
produced by the the Sun's solar-wind hitting Earth's magnetic-field,
various kinds of <italic>"Hiss,"</italic> and other endless variety of
fascinating radio emissions.</bold>

 <bold>Natural VLF radio signals tell a great deal of what is happening
with Earth's "near-space weather," that is, what is going on between
the Sun and Earth. Invisible weather to our eyes but just as wild and
stormy at times as the weather "down here!"</bold> =20

[No, not DJ Liquid]

DJ Rich gave me the ok to mention this:

LIQUID, 2925 16th St. at So. Van Ness Ave., 431-8889

Grand Opening Jan. 15

DJ Rich (A.R.M.) spinning drum & bass, dub, trip hop
DJ Wallace [Brad] spinning down beat, trance


The flyer says 7 p.m., Wed. - Sun. -- but Rich is hoping to do this as a
weekly on Wednesdays & Fridays, and the DJs will start spinning later than
7 (8:30 or 9 seems a better bet).  There are $2 well drinks until 10:00 pm,
a lounge & pool tables.

As Rich would say (sort of), he'd love his peeps to represent.

Hi all!  ]=)


 Sorry to spam the lists but I desprately need to get in touch with 
Galena (sp?) or some other in charge person from Gaiamind, happening on 
Jan. 23rd.
 I can be reached here or at the phone # below in the sig file.

 This is a party to help raise money to purchase the Headwaters Forest, 
one of the last (if not the last) large old growth stands in the United 
States. The DJ lineup is _incredible_ (Goa) with some amazing live acts 
as well. I'll post more info later.


hugz,

Anyone saw this episode? (Just aired 1/15/97 at 12:35am)  Some person 
from San Jose called and asked about ecstasy in raves.  The reply 
somewhat bothered me.  Another false statement from our friends at MTV that 
they can't back up with facts?

THIS FUCKING RUMOR IS STILL GOING AROUND!?!?!?!
=20
don't you get it...?
this has been circulating as long as e-mail has been being sent!
E-mail CANNOT, I REPEAT, CANNOT contain a virus that will do snything to
your computer... unless you happen to be executing your e-mails with a c
interpreter... which i dont believe has ever been done!

Randy C. Cone... the message you sent is the virus itself... it will not do
anything to your computer... just the fact that it is being sent is the
virus...=20

-oh well... you probably didn't read this message anyways, due to the
subject name...

if you're propagating this email because you think it's a funny joke, well
it isn't and you better FUCKING STOP, because virus hoaxes are NOT FUNNY.
even if it is clearly obvious that the virus is a hoax, somebody doesn't get
it and then forwards the note to somebody else, etc. and then we've all got
to deal with it again (and again, and again) and frankly, i'm tired of it!

if you really think it is a virus, then let me apologize for being rude.

the good times virus is a hoax.

Hey all :)
My friend from LA sent me this from the so-calraves list and asked me to 
pass it on.. Hope you enjoy it! Have a great rest of the week and (if 
tix are left) see you at Harmony! If not, see you at F8! And the 
afterparty on Sunday of course :)
Love and hugs,
LAra


LOVE

Love is one of the most powerful forces of nature, yet it cannot be 
completely described or explained by humankind and "modern" science.

To understand love, you must feel it.

With love being such a special thing, why does the world neglect it so 
much? Imageine if a stranger were to approach you in a store to tell you 
that he or she loved you?  How would you react?

Guess What?  That person really isn't a stranger!  That person is your 
brother or sister! Don't be afraid to open your heart!

One thing this world needs is more LOVE!

We must learn to stop questioning people's intentions.  This is a 
"programmed" habit that will only lead to a dangerous circle of negativity.

Love remains one of the only things that cannot be bought or sold in this 
world.  Love is something that cannot be taken, Love must be given.  Love 
must be shared.

Love is thinking of others before you think of yourself.  To love is to 
be selfless.  To love is to make the welfare of others more important 
than your own.

Love can save this planet. At our celebrations, the amount of love in the 
air is overwhelming and intoxicating.  We must not let the love stop when 
the music stops.

Let love thrive! Carry it into the world.  Share it with the world!

Love is something that can't even be explained by words!

Love -- Feel it, share it, give it.

So now it's time to go, and live LOVE!

Uhm, just wanted to point something out.
If you had kept reading the "virus warning" post like I did, you would
have found that it was a joke, and each paragraph just got sillier and
sillier. :>
Take the time to go back and read it, I got a chuckle or two. =)

 And you obviously didn't read the message dipshit. This was a test and 
you failed. If you had read it then you would have noticed (maybe not) 
that this is a JOKE!!! It takes the ol' Good Times virus prank and sets 
it on it's head.

 No duh. Why don't you reread the post. It's obvious you need a good laugh.

Randy, I think it's fine to screw with your close friends and co-workers
with this thread, however I think most agree with me, when I say I am tired
of reading about this, thinking it might be a valid virus warning.
Something real could come along, and like the boy who cried wolf, none of
us would believe it. I don't manage this list, but IMO this stuff doesn't
belong here.

My advance apologies for those of you who are receiving this e-mail
twice... I tried to omit everyone from mw-raves on my distribution...
Seemed like a good cause to me. If they ever get all of this info together,
I would be interested in seeing how big the "final" list is. :)

hi all:

this is the last i have to say on the matter.  yes, i did read the entire
joke, and yes, i knew the note was a joke before i sent out my nastygram.
my inbox is full of people telling me how they thought the virus alert thing
was funny.  yes, i thought it was funny, the first time i saw it, then i saw
it a dozen more times.  

and then somebody on a [different] mailing list to whom this joke was
propagated DIDN'T read the entire message -- just the first paragraph -- and
forwarded it onto one of their friends, informing them of a new virus, etc. etc.

the long and short of it is that sooner or later, somebody thinks it's a
real virus -- YES, YES, i KNOW it's obvious that it's not, but somebody
always does, and it's a pain in the butt to have to explain over and over
and over again that it isn't.

spreading a virus hoax (even an obvious one) should be like discussing
airplane hijackings in an airport.  if nothing else, it's bad karma.

p.

     yeah, i hear there's another virus going around.  
     
     it's the organo-vibramatic virus.  
     
     only this doesn't effect system 7.5, windows 95, windows 3.11 or 
     windows 2012 (coming soon to an asteroid belt near you).  No, this 
     virus is much more on an organic and suborganic level.  
     
     It will cause uncontrollable and seemingly random fits of laughter.  
     
     Watch out for it.  
     
     You might even feel like paying some of your enemies a compliment!  
     eeggh!?  
     
     The only cure for this virus is to immerse yourself in the day to day 
     routine and forget why you came to the planet earth in the firs 
     place...
     
     be vewwy careful!

The Good Times virus is indeed a hoax.

However, it's sadly no longer entirely true that e-mail can't carry =

viruses.  For example, if you have a mailer on the PC configured to =

could be at risk from Word macro visuses.

Apologies accepted.  But do you REALLY think that someone is going to be
MORE likely to go to your site if you stuff it with 20 or so emails instead
of just one?!?  Have you ever heard of SPAMMING?  That's just what you did,
and if you haven't figured it out yet, its considered poor use of the net.

I have a better suggestion -- instead of just posting 20+ messages with
"visit my site, visit my site, visit my site" why not tell more about your
site in the first message -- like some of the different cool things, etc.?
That's what I do when we update our junglism site (www.cyberzen.com/jungle)
every week.

It got pretty annoying after the first ten or so :(

Words are powerful.  Use them judiciously and their impact will be far
greater :)

Subject: introductions and NYE pictures...
Sender: sfraves-owner@hyperreal.com

Hello all,

I thought I'd introduce myself since there was a call for lurkers to come
forward.  I'm a South Peninsula boy, born and raised (well actually born in
SJ Hospital but raised in Mtn. View/Cupertino/Los Altos).  That makes me a
suburban freak but that's okay the way I see it.  At least I had hills and
orchards to play in when I was younger.

Anyway, I'm currently a Computer Science student at UC San Diego and I very
much miss partying with all the wonderful people up in SF.  I guess you
could call me an old-timer since I have been around for so long.  I went to
the first Toon Town (It was for Preston's B-Day if I remember correctly). I
went to the first Full Moon Massive on Baker Beach (practically the DAY Jeno
came to town).  I heard Garth spin out for the first time EVER!  I remember
when the ONLY place to hear decent dance music was Osmosis at the top floor
of DV8 and Watch It Wiggle, See It Jiggle by SF's own Doc Martin (did you
know he was originally from SF?).  I even remember when Townsend opened for
the first time and Doc Martin (who played Hip-Hop at the time) and Pete
Avila started playing there (YIKES!)  I remember when Wicked was an after
2am basement acid house party at Big Heart City Cafe and Toon Town was every
Saturday night at 650 Howard St.  I actually did a bit of DJing in the South
Bay with Spun, Rick Preston and others.  I played at the Destiny Parties
which formed with Community and Eklypz to become the first Gathering (which
reminds me that I ALSO went to Martin's first parties, Eklypz and Peices).

Ah well, that was long ago and things have GREATLY changed.  The Wicked boys
no longer play techno and acid (it's all house now).  The Hardkisses barely
get booked in SF (rember Sunny Side up?).  The Flop House is no more and Goa
Gill is worshipped by little Goa heads all over the world.  The only thing
that HASN'T changed is that Martin STILL throws the only bust-free parties
in the Bay Area.  Please don't feel as though I'm trying to brag, I just
wanted to share a bit of old memories with others on the list I KNOW where
there too (Andy...).

As you can probably figure out, I'm a little older than the average raver
but I can still loose my head as I did on NYE at the Pacific/Gateway party.
I swear I haven't become soft and sunk into the house disease I think many
other old-timers have.  I'm mad about techno and my posts will probably
reflect my deep love for it.  I don't spin anymore as it's a game better
played by those with more dedication than I can give (props out to folks
like MAD, Pacific, Gateway and others who are behind bringing the techno
back to SF).  I do dabble a bit with music making but haven't released
anything (I'm pretty anal about my own material and I'm waiting until I'm
good enough to be heard).  My latest bit of fun is building my own analog
synths which I am now fully prepared to go out and accomplish as I've
repaired some of my own gear and built some kit projects.

So that's it about myself for now.  As a warning, I can come off pretty
stong but it's just my passion for the music coming out.  I'll try and not
stir up too much trouble as I did on socal-raves when I was subscribed.

Here's a little New Years photo spread from the Gateway/Pacific Party and
Stompy Cafe on New Years Day.

http://icse1.ucsd.edu/~rcurlee/new-years/

I hope you enjoy!

Oi! Oi!

People that can take one joke and get uptight about the next...?

I don't get it...?

I don't believe very many people took these posts as the jokes they were...

If I came off sounding uptight... 

sorry... i just know that these types of posts 

        *as you can see from the previous ten or twenty posts... 

Generate A LOT of commosion... and can be handled differently...

I actually DID recieve the Good times virus...

A completely spammed mailbox full of Good times posts.

Dosen't suprise me. I gotta say this: I fucking HATE that TV/Radio show! You got one guy who talks 80% of the time cracking jokes about peoples problems with love/sex and the other guy who talks 20% is the one who actually has some useful info for the callers.

Seems to me that humor on this list is like playing Gin
while waiting for the call to action.  We entertain ourselves,
keeping the contacts alive and the feeling of family
warm while waiting for the next rave to begin...

Hello!

Sorry, I have been busy as of late, but here is my intro:

I moved to SF last week from Ft. Lauderdale, Florida. I just graduated
college
and got a job doing development of web applications.

I am really into music.  I play guitar in my spare time, and most of my
influences are
those that use a lot of distortion and fast drum machines (Ministry,
KMFDM, Filter, NIN)
Industrial is my favorite type of music, mostly because I like having it
on in the background
to make me work faster and it gets me pumped up.

I started getting into the rave scene a few years ago to open my mind to
new types of music.
I really like techno, and music with fast beats and lots of tempo.  Most
of the places I have
been to on the East coast have been techno oriented.

I have started exploring the scene here and I love it.  Its more new
music to check out, which
is exciting. I saw dubtribe which totally got me grooving. I also went
to Eminence 97 which
was good and bad at the same time.  The one room with the big green
laser and the fast
tempo music was were I danced most of the time.

So thats the quick version, I really look forward to meeting you all.
I have been trying to make the monday night dinners, but i have been
stuck at the office.  I am going to try next week to
make it.

if anyone doesnt mind letting a newbie to the bay area tag along with
them, gimme a call
or send off some email! :)

peace out,

hi! my name is Jon, and like Ed at zot@netcom.com, i work at Sony
Interactive in Foster City, 3rd Party Quality Assurance division where we
"test" games for the Sony PlayStation from companies such as Capcom, Namco,
and Konami. (hey ed, drop me a line if you read this and come down and say
"what up" so i can put a face to "zot")...

i'm 26 and have been involved with the rave scene for about 5 years(i
hooked up with the fellas who did the Curious George parties way back when,
but recently i have been involved with the guys at neXus who bring out the
2nd Chakra parties).  i haven't been going out to any parties lately, but
hopefully i can come back into the "fold" in the near future.  i'm a 5'8",
filipino who was born in the Philippines.  i have been living in the bay
area (i live in alameda at the present time) for about 16 years.

i'm currently into Jungle/drum&bass and if any of you out there know of any
new releases, please drop me line....

well, that's my $0.02.  hope to see some of you sfravers at some of the
parties in the near future...

Peace Love Unity Respect

J;)

Hi,
        I've been subscribing to this list for a while but I've only posted
twice. I guess I just got on to recieve the weekly calender and for rave
reviews.  I also felt intrusive about writing since a lot of people on the
list seem to know eachother and I am a mere newbie.
        I'm 19 and I'm a sophomore at Berkeley majoring in
I-don't-know-what-yet. I live in a nice, big, old house with six of my
friends and we have lots of X-parties.
        I went to X-parties before I discovered raves. I started going to
raves because a lot of my friends were ravers and it was unavoidable. I
loved it because its such a positive scene and its done so much good for so
many people I know.  Some of my friends started organizing parties
(Lepidoptera).
        I'd like to get to know people on this list --so write.

Maly

Hey-

My name is Geordie and I just moved to SF from San Deigo. I moved up here 
to get a job in the graphics field, somewhere there is one for me.
I've been going to raves for a few years...since 1992 in SD. It was 
really fun and most of the parties where actually free.
My favorite one were the ones that were held on an closed off bridge over 
163 in SD.  
Unfortunately my first rave hee was the one in Oakland which got busted 
around 1:00, that was a bad scene!  I was really surprised on how calmly 
the people were taking it.  It was very cool!
I'm new to this list, but I have been lurking for about 3 weeks.  That's 
a little about me.

HEY.  Sorry, but this is completly un-rave related.  So Delete it NOW!!

ok, if you're still with me, I've got a stupid WEB question to ask.

We are in the process of creating a web page, and Ideally, we would like 
to use www.eac.com.  But unfortunatly, that domain is taken by some 
Network Integrator company of some sort.  But I noticed that www.eac.org 
is not taken by anyone.

What is the difference between a .com and .org URL???

Thanxs!!!

Hello Sfraves,

	I have finally moved and got my computer running again, so I can finally
give you guys the whole scoop. 

	Well, we planned to do this party in a small yet really cool space in
Oakland. The goal... to have a small party, where all of the Harmony crew
could just kick it and party with everyone, instead of slaving away for
days on end, and working the entire party. But according to the Oakland
Police Dept., we cannot do something like this. Appearently, the only way
that all of us can party and dance together after 2am is if we PAY OFF the
police. Our little world here has become so f**king currupt!!! I hate it!!!
Something has to give... soon. But I could go off on that forever, so I
won't. 

	To make a long story short, the space that we were going to use has been
busted and the Police warned that if we were to try it again, our party
too, would get busted, no matter how large or small. So basically, that
space was out. I looked for other spaces that would be suitable, but came
up with nothing, and in this short amount of time, I could not find any new
spaces either. So it was decided, that instead of giving you guys a half
ass party, in a space that we are not prepared to use, we are going to
postpone this party indefinatly. But when the time is right and the bad
emotions have been settled, we will all come together, and while dancing
all night, we will throw a f**king kick ass party, as one family!

	As far as the people who have already purchased their "Family" tickets. We
will honor our word. You can either mail the actual ticket with your full
return mailing address to the Harmony po box, or you can hold onto them
until the next party and use it as your ticket for that party. Whatever you
want to do is fine by us. If you mail your ticket to use, I personlly will
see to it that you get your money! We have not spent any of the money that
has come from the presold ticket sales, so everything is cool. Until next
time, keep smiling, and always, always keep the faith in our scene!!!

Peace, love and harmony to you,

Greg =)

.com is for a company and .org is for an organization...
i think it's supposed to be a non-profit organization.

 when i wanted to put my site up as http://www.chosen.com , i found out=20
 that it was taken by some gimme money religious organization. I was kind
 of pissed. After a couple weeks of trying to figure out a different domain,
 I decided to apply for http://www.chosen.org ... and i havent had any
 problems... just when you apply, say your'e going to supply free
 information services for some subject. there won't be any problem.=20

in my case i dont know what the .org stands for...
organ? orgy? im from oregon, so maybe thats it? organic? i dunno. =3Do)

.com signifies a Commerical organization, one that is in business to
make money

.org signifies a Non-Profit Organization, one that is in business to
provide a service and
    does not make money, other than to cover costs

ideally, if you are going to sell things over the net, or display what
your company can sell to
others, .com is needed. otherwise, .org is perfectly fine.

of course, i doubt anyone would be banging on your door if you were .org
and you were
selling products over the web. :)

I wanto to give a shout out to Pengo for this web site:

http://gangid.ucdavis.edu/

For all you ravers who continue to use the term gangstah to identify, er,
attitidue, you might want to check this site out.  It pretty much says it
all about gangs and gangstahs.  It only re-affirms my belief that the term,
as used here, is not only out of context, but has racial overtones (I've
said it before, and since people continue to use it I'll say it again).

Anyway check out the site.  Even *I* learned some things.

Check it and once again, thanks Pengo for the valuable information.

Now back to conversations in progress.

well I have never given a formal hello to everyone out there in sfrave
land.  My name is Eric, and I have been going to parties (underground) ever
scene 2012.  Yes that, in my eyes, was my first party.  I loved everything
about it, and that one party and everyone after it is what has grabbed me
into this scene of ours.  I go to parties almost every friday and saturday,
and almost always have at least 250 blow pops to give out to everyone.  In
my 3 months or so of going to parties I have met soo many wonderful people,
and continue to do so.  And I hope eventually I will meet each and everyone
of you.

	If building a community means paying for permits so we can water 
town hall's lawn, I kind of start cocking my eyebrows. If being legit 
means paying into the business we call government so I can play my sound 
system with people in a house that the occupants allow it, I my 
disenchantment with the line of "we are doing this to protect you from 
yourselves" grows. When the police tell me that I am responsible for all 
the people who come to a party, not the people themselves, I am just 
about ready to throw my hands up into the air in frustation - how are 
people supposed to take responsiblity for themselves if someone else is 
always having to do it.
	Selling out? I do not know where that comes into the picture
unless the promoter starts treating parties like a business (which one
would have to do really to go legit, I guess so maybe there is a link). I
just don't want throwing parties to HAVE to be a full time job because of
bullshit, plain and simple. I also do not want to have parties stop
because no one has the necessary finanical means to drop $4000 to rent a
club out in SF. That's a lot of money to drop for just about anyone I 
think. And then are you going to make any of it back?
	If people want to go legit, the space that Resolution happened in
is probably going to be coming up for rent soon and even for sale. It is a
good site and with $3000 dollars of sheet rock and lumber, a little more
fire permits, and a HELL of a lot of work, it could be a legal venue.
Anyone interested to put a fight together to maybe get a legal space
together? I have two arms to hang sheet rock with, carpentary skills to
build a deck and additional exits, anyone want to help Pascal buy the
place?

Yes, they are different since they use different root servers which are 
known as the coo root domain and the org root domain.

.com's are usually used by individuals or businesses for commercial 
purposes such as aol.com, microsoft.com, etc....  .orgs are normally used by 
non-profit organizations or groups such as cloudfactory.org, etc...  
Check out http://internic.net for more information about this.

Has anyone ever considered throwing more parties somewhere not near the 
city?  What are the policies/laws in other cities?  This idea came to my 
mind after NYE when the only party that wasn't busted was the Cloud 
Factory party at Monterey.  Maybe we should start having parties 
somewhere other than Oakland or San Francisco.... A long drive is well 
worth it if we could stay and party till morning.

Speaking of the Cloud Factory party I would like to thank the promoters 
for throwing such an awesome party and also to everyone I met (you know 
who you are.... ).  I know it's kinda late but... it's always better late 
than never.

much love with hugz,
Anthony E

Well, since someone got someone started with these formal introductions I 
would like to formally introduce myself to the list.  I'm Anthony E, I'm 
Filipino with shaved head, about 5'4" tall.  I've been lurking in this 
list (well not really... i just really don't have time to post)  for 
about 6 months now.  I started going to raves about a year ago and my 
very first rave was at Los Angeles which was sorta like a massive and Ron 
D. Core was spinnin' an d everyone was shouting "HARDCORE!"  Anyway ever 
since that experience I started going to raves at least once every two 
weeks  (altho i've been going to raves every week lately).  I prefer 
small parties with a solid positive vibe where I can have fun and meet 
people.  

More about myself,  I am 19 years old and I run my own computer company 
and I am also a UNIX Security Administrator (yes kids, it's my 
responsibility to drive out those wily crackers off my site.)   In my 
part time during those boring weekdays I hang out on IRC and talk about 
anything that doesn't make sense on those "hacker" channels like #hack and 
#2600.   When I'm at raves I spend a lot of time walking around, meeting 
new people, and giving out candy (if some small filipino dude offers you 
starburst at a party it's probably me).  

There!  Now that that's off my back I hope to see you all at the 
Frequency-8 party this friday!  I have a bag full of starburst for everyone!
PLUR =]

Much PLUR,
Anthony E

PLUR = "Please Let Us Rave" (tell that to our friends in blue.)

I am not sure I was very clear in this message... Let me expand...

	It would be a clever ploy to take a community that is trying to 
deviate from capitalistic ways and convert it into a nice business which 
separates those throwing the party (the business people) from the people 
coming out to the party (the customers). By forcing promoters to obtain 
expensive permits, use "legal" sanctioned spaces, they provide much 
needed work and money for the local area. In a way, the system of 
approvals makes sure people keep adding to the economy in a nice way, by 
overlaying a customer/provider relationship on those coming out to the 
party (people will except more if you charge $15 to cover permit costs 
and so parties will take on a more commerical feel - why is there a 
difference between Martin's smaller Basics party and small UGs?). Now it 
could be argued that, in fact, the smaller parties are cheating the 
system, and greedy promoters are making millions or something along those 
lines, but look at the "greedy" promoters like Gateway, like the people 
who put Resolution on, like the guy who throw all his money into the 
space Resolution was held in, (those are the only promoters whose 
lifestyles I kind of know), are they greedy?
	What I see is a system which works a service provider/customer
overtone into every relationship when groups of people want to gather.  If
some people decide to go legit, they will be forced into charging more or
having to pay out of their pocket to pay for permits, for legal spaces (or
maintaining legal spaces). If they charge more, people feel like customers
which was one of the things that raves used to lack (some semblence of
trust between promoter and partygoer that most money was going toward keep
things going or free parties and not into promoters pockets for living a
lavish lifestyle, maybe that was always bullshit and people were getting
rich and living lavish lifestyles, I dunno). It will take work by all of
the "community" to override this pressure from the "state". That line
about the permit issuing type trying to tell us that they don't want
people getting together in a nonbusiness environment kind of top of this
drivel that had been going through my head before...

Good Day SF Raves!!
So good to see that there is still posativeity, loveliness, and good 
people out there.  This is my intro, my short history, and my phylosophy.

First off -I am a product of the word proccessing generation so please 
don't hold my atrocious spelling against me.

I am Spencer K., the last name is Knowles but I like to think of myself 
as an individual all my own with ideals, beliefs, and a life seperate 
from the Knowles clan.  Its not than I am ashmed or anything of my clan 
just that Spencer is me, who I am, I can develope and mold Spencer into 
what I want, Knowles is a preconcieved ideal that shatters my 
individuality and anchors me to one clan, one group, one family.  I like 
to think of everyone as members of one family, and so I like to think of 
myself as Spencer, ya know, just one of the family.
     I hark from accross the great devide of the california/Oregon 
boarder.  A small ski town known as Bend, Oregon was my stating point for 
the adventure of life. After high school and the endless dramas therin I 
moved to LA to seek my fortune in FILM.  I ended up working on streight 
to videao masterpieces such as "Capt'n Nuke and The Bomber Boys" and 
"Carniusour III", as  tempting as this life was I left it for college.  
After three years and a few bumps, ruts, storms, and joys, I had attened 4 
colleges and lived in three states, this period of Spencer's history is 
extremely complex but interesting and I would be thrilled to discuss it 
with you sometime at a party but this is not the place.  Anyway, I grew 
confused, angry, negative, and hopeless with the tormenteing human 
race.  So with a sleeping back under my arm and c-note in the bank I 
moved to Maui to 
clear my mind and meditate on life.  Long story sort- Boy gives up on 
society, boy moves to Island paradise, boy clears mind, finds purpose and 
falls in love with a kitten with a wip, namely LIFE. I decided to 
fill my 
head with something rather than cocconuts and salt water so I am now 
attending UC Santa Cruz, ya know, getting smart like.  My first rave was 
at the Dance Studio, I met the most posative, enlighteded, and grounded 
people I have ever known there and have been hooked ever since.  I am 
attracted to the sociality, community, love, and just plain fuzzy feeling 
I get with the rave community, you guys are the best. 
     I am looking forward to putting on my own parties and spreading this 
beautiful vibe!  if anyone ever needs a hand just ask me.  /so I suppose 
I should finish this crazyt thing so here goes.  I am 20 years since 
birth,  
white (caucasion for the politicaly correct),  6' 3" and have very 
large, blong, curly hair, its more like a thicket than hair.  Just look 
for someone who might have had the nick name "Fro Daddy Jones".
     I accaisionally sell glow necklaces and other beautifully charged 
play toys at parties but I am not good at charging money for fun stuff so 
sometimes I sell but most of the times I give them away, it all depends on if I 
have food in the pantry or not.  
     So there I am in a nutshel, a very small, low capasity nut shell.  
There is so much more, guess you'll just have to meet me to find out.  I 
can't wait to meet all of you and hear your stories.  So with a hug and a 
smile I say good day and hello.

Spencer K.
  
P.S. - Massives are ussually not my dish-de-light but I'll be going 
bonkers at Acid Breaks on saturday so look for my green neon backpack, my 
hughe hair, and the guy with a couple hundred glow necklacs about him, 
that's me, I'll reply with a hug and a good day!! see ya soon SF Raves!!

P.P.S- Mail me back,  Conversation is the medium of growth - Love is the 
medium of life.

The issue to me is more than "How far do I have to drive tonight?". It
has to do with perserving an important aspect of the culture in San
Francisco. What will happen when the Law finally drives out all of
the artists and musicians in the city?

We can move to another city, but remember that "rave" is a dirty word
as far as the media is concerned. It's only a matter of time before we
would be forced out of the next town.

Well lets see.
	I'm from eureka ca. 270 miles north of SF, I am 15 (7/11/81), I am 6-0,
I have always liked techno, rave, and rap musik. I know rap is totally
seperate.
Hip hop and disco are also some related favorites.
	I haven't been to a rave yet, but I've been to a few parties that played
plain old cd's, but the parties were alright. I hate drugs and alcohol,
even thought
I've had plenty of offers. I recently went on a cruz to the carribbs, and
met a few 22 year old
women that I wish to meet again. Maybe Fort Lauderdale dude can help me
with this.
	Her name is Eileen. She is korean, and just graduated from m.i.t. She is-
22 and
now lives in miami. She likes Ministry and goes to raves all the time. 
	That's about it for me. I plan to go to a rave next time I'm in SF. I'll
let ya know
what I look like when I do. L8r

 I really don't see why anyone would worry/care about some little virus
floating around on the internet.
  You have total control over what you do w/ your computer.
 If you want to risk having to reformat your HDD by downloading an
executable file and double clicking on it. You can do that.. No problem.
 If you want make your computer the perfect virus fighting android and gate
master to your chunk of the super highway. Go for it!   Whats stopping you?

   I am sure though..  That we will all be very amazed w/ the future of
computer viruses.    With all this artifitial intelligence n all.  
Programs that adapt, learn from mistakes.  
   What about them programs that reproduce. Actually, spread like bacteria,
chowing down on files to make copies of them selves. How would you like
that? Your hard drive just filled /w a bunch of combinded possitive and
negetive electrons looking for more food....

 With this terrible reality infront of us. I think it is ok to send funny
(totally harmless according to most of the laws of phisics) E-mail to your
friends! Damnit!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

The main thing that I will always remember about this list is the way
people rush to help when there is a question :-)  Many thanks to those
that have recommended events for the weekend... It looks like Freq-8 and
All Together Now are the most popular...  If anyone has anything more 
to contribute I luv to hear it.

I just wish they werent pre-sale tix.  Makes me all nervous about getting
in!

Subject: Hello, Sf Raves...(Intro)
Sender: sfraves-owner@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

Hello to SF Raves from the both of us.  Yes, there are two of us sharing
the same e-mail address so when we post you'll see the message either from
danielv or from elina.  We are a happy but broke most of the time, couple
that live here in the ugly, miserable, stinky Salinas Valley.  Where the
word "rave" is almost oblique.  Daniel is 25 and DJ's wherever he can, and
is very loyal and dedicated to the scene.  He makes me happy with the vibe
he trancends with his music, and I'm sure he'd make you happy too, if you
SFr's ever gave him a chance. Someday, people...someday.  He's pretty
experienced, he's been spinning since he was thirteen years old.  He makes
his living working full time at a TV station (KCBA/KCCN) as an AVID editor.
He has alot of experience producing, shooting, and editing.  So if anyone
ever needs anything, hit him up, he's good!  He is a very kindhearted man,
he's a gentle bear, my bear (mush).  As for me, I'm 23, and a full time
student at the community college here in Salinas.  I am studying Computer
Science/Multimedia. We both love going to good raves, with good vibes, and
hardcore music that just raptures your body. Cloud Factory definately gave
our New Year a sweet start!  We try to stay very connected with fellow
ravers and those who share like interests because we need that fulfillment
living here in such a desolate, deprived town.  So we try to get fed as
much as we can, and Daniel keeps current with his record buying.  I have to
admit, I love supporting his habit, and backing him up 100%, because he
backs my education up 100%.  I guess we make a very good team as soulmates,
but also as a family, because life for us is not all about ravin', work and
school, but it's also about our #1 priority, our pride and joy....Our three
year old sun, Andrew.  I spell son, s-u-n, because he is like the sunshine
in our life.  He is beautiful, he is so full of love and happiness, because
he has both of us.  We are bringing him up in rave culture, and have lots
of future hopes for him to contribute to this secondary culture.  Hopefully
in music, but whatever he wants is fine.  Last but not least, we snowboard.
We just got back actually from an amazing adventure in Tahoe, and we're
not satisfied with just a weekend.  We are planning to go back, because we
had so much fun this weekend, and Tahoe got fresh powder....Yum!!! So as
you can see, we have a very full life, with lots of responsibilities.  But
what it's all about people, is having a balance of all things, that makes
life worth living.  Sorry so long, but it's from both of us.  Thanks
everyone, for just being there, and hopefully we'll move out of this
shithole and closer to you. Peace and Hugs, Daniel and Elina :)

Well, hi!
  My first rave was in September of 96, but I've only recently grown really
addicted to the scene. =)  Unluckily for me, I made a recent move back to
Kentucky for family & education and so I suffer through bouts of GoodVibe
Withdrawl...  But, I do visit the bay area at least once or twice a month. (In
fact, my car stays there permanently.)
 Basically my story goes: Lil'Berrie grew up shy & conservative in a very
constructed atmosphere in the bay area, 16 y/o Berrie & family moved away to
rural Kentucky, 18 y/o Berrie moved OUT and back to the bay-consequently going
somewhat crazy, then 1997 brought me a little insight into priorities.  And
now, I have plans to move back somewhere between one half a year to two years.
(smarter, prepared-er, richer)

Patience is a virtue. =D    <:wait:>


 *plur* & <:HUGS:>!!!

For any of you confused about the GaiaMind postings, I wanted to 
 clarify that there's two events in San Francisco posted to sfraves.  
 Acutally, there are five events just in SF alone, but two that 
 integrates house/trance/tribal music, dance, and the arts.  
 Celebrating unity consciousness in conjunction with a particular 
 planetary alignment that last occured around the renaissance period, 
 GaiaMind is a grassroots opportunity for personal and planetary 
 healing.  If you're interested in the concept, the related campaign, 
 and links to this event, I suggest you look at the web page: 
 http://www.gaiamind.com.  Their e-mail addy is: info@gaiamind.com, 
 415,436.0123.

The Evolution Collective is doing a meditation/prayer/dance/interactive 
 arts event from 9am-1pm on Thursday, 1/23/97 at St. John's in the 
 Mission (see address and info below).  And
Ran and another sfraver posted the evening event which will be pretty 
 incredible in it's own right as a benefit for Headwaters Forest.  I've 
 listed both events below since they complement each other and we're 
 supporting/sharing some resources in the spirit of 
 cooperation...something I'd like to see more of in this scene ;}

Hope to see some of you there!

Hugs,
Diane

EVOLUTION: A Celebration of Life
Thursday January 23, 1997
Dreamspell Calendar: Yellow Electric Sun

9 am - 1 pm @ St. John the Evangelist Episcopal Church
1661-15th St. @ Julian Ave between Guerrero and Valencia

The Evolution Collective in association with the GaiaMind Project presents
a free San Francisco gathering for the GaiaMind Global Meditation and Prayer.
Evolution gatherings are a forum for relation, creation, and manifestation
integrating ritual, music, and movement.

Opening our doors at 9 am, the actual group meditation will start at 9:30am.
Afterwards, we'll move into a ceremony and dancing with DJ Dante and Marcus
Hawkins on electric violin.  There will be a microphone hooked into the 
 mix board
 if you'd like to alternate w/Marcus and others contributing to the mix 
 w/the dj.
The celebration ends with a closing meditation at 12:56pm as the astrological
conjunction perfects over San Francisco.  Several other art/dance/house
communities in the United States will synchronize with us in this 
 closing meditation
building an even stronger vibe often shared in the common groove found 
 through music
and dance.

Bring musical instruments, drums, food, contributions to the collective
altar, and anything else you would like to share.

If you would like to contribute to the realization of this goal or need
more info, call the Evolution Info line:  415.908.6717

Dear All;

	Wow, your priorities in life suddenly change from getting back
on-line, to recovering your $13k baby from the evil and dreaded; by every
car owning Californian; City Tow. Yes folks; the evil bastards; & bitches
to be fair illegally impounded my car. Why you ask; I happened to have
rolled a flashing light; a right turn at that; @ 3am, and got Darth Vader
and Attilla the hun for peace officers. In addition to the lame red light
charge, I didn't happen to have my legal & valid out of state license on
me, and since it's up to the discretion of the officer they decided to
impound my vehicle. Just goes to show ya misery loves
company/companionship. On top of that to find out that the evil overload; 
City Tow, will sell your car for a fraction of it's worth just to cover
the bogus towing and storage charges giving the rightful owner a return
investment of; shall we say $0.00, was the main determining factor in my
delay to return to all my brothers and sisters on-line. 

	But the good news folks is that the DarknEs^2 has got the big guns
out on dis one(legal council from Frank Rosen Esq,/LA), and provided that
the evil & dreaded even still methaphedamine monster does resurface, god
willing(no I haven't gotten religious in my absents; god = good old
druggies) I will recover said vehicle after shelling out lots o $$$ by the
latest 2/3/97, if not sooner, and cheaper. 

	But the real news here folks is that dis raver is 11 painfully,
yet glorious days sober, not even weed. Let's just say, and very seriously
at that, that dis raver decided yet one more time to do battle with the
dreaded meth monster, and it almost took my mind (then some of you already
think I'm crazy; HA HA you should have seen me at Alta Bates Psych
Hospital, ask Peter Fogel, who I give permission to state his professional
& clinical observations of myself while I was at Alta Bates in an effort
to help bring awareness to you all about the dangers of methaphedamine
addiction). A mind that has stuff on the Discovery Space Shuttle, not to
mentioned assisting in putting Rapid Transist systems like BART, on-line
in over 5 major US cites including my project NYC, NY Metro-North, LIRR
rebuild/retrofit.

	But the even greater news is what I've discovered when I came back
from being so far out there, and how I feel now after just 11 days of zero
substance intake, less caffiene. Empowered, confident, driven, impassioned
about life on life's terms, emotional, vibrant, powerful, tactile, aware,
creative, expressive, spiritual, let's just say RESONANT. I feel my
spirit, not your spirit or thee spirit; MY SPIRIT more so now than at any
other point in my life, and it's wonderful, beyond words and feelings.

	You can see it in the way I walk(@ 5mph), when you look into my
eyes(not red, just clear white & emeral green) or so they tell me. That
there's a purpose, a clarity, & a calmness where there was chaos and
intolerable nervous energy before.

	Reality, has a feel to it, it's like I'm swimming in ether; and
it's wonderful, exciting and a worth-wild pursuit just on it's own merits;
without all the additives. I guess it took being out there for so long to
become aware of what's really there, or at least what I sense is there.

	Don't get me wrong, there are nights I struggle and cry myself to
sleep over an insane desire to do that chemical(which I can say to you is
better than sex, but not real), despite the way I feel now as I'm
communicating this to you; despite all my intelligence and all the self
knowledge I have about it and what it will do to me; despite everything
that's at stake(my car, my body & mind, and everyone that I love), that
there are times that I would give it all up in a second for a shot of
glass. 

	I'm so lucky to be a live and I know it, I'm so lucky not to have
HIV, or the other awful diseases associated with the use of IV drug use. 

	Ya know I'm hopelessly liberal, and believe down to my core that
everyone should try each and every substance there is and make a decision
for THEMSELVES; it so moved to. But when it comes to this substance, I as
a live & let live liberal, am so torn that it makes me question what I
believe in and advocate, to the point of almost saying that it's every
person's job on our scene to end production of and destory this chemical
forever. One not one person I have ever spoken to, who has done it, and
been through it, has said to me; Brian I really benefited from the use of
illegally produced methaphedamine; NOT ONE. 

	Well, you know how I feel and how I'm doing, and I will be back
soon. I'd like to thank Kevin Keiper for letting me use his account to
rant, rave, and express my joys, feelings, & concerns, Please do not send
him hate mail, if you need to respond to me, call 800-590-4993, and you
will find instructions there on how to send me internet e-mail via my
alpha pager;  please keep'em short I only have a 4x4 LCD display. 

Love 
Brian 
xoxoxxoxoxxoxoxo

ps I'll be with you soon, if you have a burning desire to give me a hug,
you will find me at 362 Capp Street, in the Mission every night at 10pm in
the NA meeting there.

pss I will personally hunt down the little shit who subscribes my alpha
pager to sfraves, and after I'm through torturing them I will force them
to show me how they did it, : )

	
	to feel so much
	to let somebody touch you
	so hot 
	so cold
	so far so outta control
	were hard to come by
	even harder to hold

Hey sfraves peeps, my friend J-Sun on mw-raves posted this... I think it's
a nifty idea. :) We also listed our three favorite mw parties of '96. Of
course, I won't know any of the sf parties for '96, but theres always '97!
*psyched*

My favorite flyer of '96 is this black and white laminate I got 4 a
Columbus party called Dynamica from E.R. Productions and fluid. Nice simple
b&w psychedelic patterns. Didn't attend the event, but I finally got one
flyer that didn't end up all bent and wrinkled. :)

 I have to disagree here as the facts are not supportive of your claim. 
The NYE trance party (in The City) was not busted either. AND it was 
visited at one point early on by a police officer. I'm not sure of 
eaxctly what transpired to keep the party going but I'm sure glad it did!!

The key is ridesharing.  Just like a family we should have a big convoy to a
party wherever it is.  Each car having its maximum capacity of PLUR
practicing ravers.  I'm getting a car by mid February and I'll definately
give _FREE_ rides to anyone who wants to go to the party I am going to...
it's a way to show my appreciation for the love and the warmth that everyone
in this family has shared to me.  In the meantime people can post to this
list and ask for a ride.  I'm pretty sure someone will respond if you ask
ahead of time.  I have tried this technique a few times and I've also made
new friends as a result.....

Hang on there,  if we stick together as the family we're supposed to be
nothing can take us down.

Much PLUR,
Anthony E

 It's dude (as if it mattered). What is the lack of PLUR in posting 
humor? And what _exactly_ do you define as my aggro-ness? I assume you 
are now the self-appointed PLUR police? Why don't you take your inability

I didn't know that... my apologies.  I do want some information on whose
party this was. They might have the key to save the scene in the city and I
will personally contact them and perhaps discuss what tactics they used so
the party didn't get shut down by our friends in blue.  Maybe it was
ladyluck.....  stand by...

 Gee, that's interesting. I've been emailing for over a year now and I 
have yet to see the Good Times Virus hoax (which I've seen 3 or 4 times 
in circulation) treated in a satirical way. And I get folks who foward 
humor to me all the time. (sigh) Guess I'm just not with it.

 I don't see your support for this claim AT ALL BUDDY.

 REPEAT: This is NOT the Good Times Virus hoax. It is HUMOR and a 
satirical poke at said hoax.

 I really can't believe the amount of people (well 3 or 4 maybe) that 
think I was fowarding the Good Times hoax when I was actually fowarding 
some humor based upon said hoax. Please read your email before just 
firing off a response. It saves a lot of bandwidth.

 Just as an aside; I have been guilty of fowarding hoax virus's until I was 
clued in to them. I was also guilty of "reactionary" emailing (and 
unfortunately sometimes still do) to people trolling (like JSL) for 
responses. It has taken me a while to learn not to go into auto-respond 
mode when sent email I don't like. I'm still not perfect at this but I do 
feel like I'm getting better at it.

 The point here is to learn from your (our) experiences. I have fired off 
a few hasty mails in relation to this post, to people whom I felt were 
attacking me for this post. I especially didn't like the folks who 
attacked me publicly. If I post something you don't like, it is more 
polite (IMO) to do a private email to discuss the issue.

 I am open to discussion on these issues but this thread should probably 
go off-list at this point.


Peace,

 However it is not anyone's fault you saw it a dozen times. I've only 
seen it once and I'm on three mailing lists with over a hundred letters a

 If it is a pain then don't do it. Don't like abortions? Don't have one.

 Again (for the clueless) my fowarded post was not a hoax. It was humor 
as most folks understood. You try to censor me because some people are 
reading their mail too hastyily to understand it and I will come out 
fighting. 

 And trying playing Karma police somewhere else please. I'm quite sure 
you are not without sin.

 I would like to help you but I'm not at liberty to discuss who threw the

Well, this thing has been around ever since e-mail existed.  There is a
paper on this at CIAC (a computer security advisory).  Check our the page at
http://ciac.llnl.gov  I think CERT also has something on this.  Obviously
this is a hoax.  The only way to transmit a virus is by running a binary
executable which has been infected on your local site along with the new MS
Office line of viruses which basically transported thru a document file and
when this is opened by a program like MS Word it will attach hidden
metacharacters to MS Word and every MS Word document you create or open from
then on will be infected sometimes causing really weird things to happen
like general protection faults etc...  Enough geektalk for now.

One example of how flame wars get started.  If it meant nothing to you,
then you didn't have to say anything.  What value do your comments have?
Are you fostering conversation, as I think the web page does, or are you
just being antagonistic?

Benn done by better.

Can someone tell me where this, er , person came from?  Other than a womb
of course.

Dude, lighten up. NRR means NRR...we understand that.  So why not NOT read
NRR posts and leave others alone.

My god, the people who have gone online these days.  There goes the

Uh, okay... I really dislike getting into these flame wars. I guess I might
have came off too serious (agin), but yanno, that's life. Maybe we are just
out of sync? Our feeble attempts at humor are not making it across the
wire, for some reason? ;) *HUG* Some of what you say in here, is getting a
little personal. I don't remember making any judgements on you as an
individual, Randy. Maybe I'm reading this wrong, but some of this hurts. I
have already met a buncha nice folks on this list and I was really starting
to enjoy it. I hope this isn't going to be a problem, my friend. *HUG*

As a somewhat related post, I am going to be following this up with
something interesting "about friendship"...

Hrmph... Is this really any different than a virus hoax, Randy? THINK about
it... As far as I'm concerned it is no different, but it was okay for you
to post the virus-hoax "joke". Okay, I see how it's going to be. I guess
you didn't find my "j/k" in there (did u read that? :D). It was "supposed"
to be humorous, but I guess that goes to prove that humor is subjective.
Should we all just avoid posting anything we think might even be remotely
funny? NOT. Whatever...

Fine. U R RIGHT. It was funny. I finally read it after smoking a bunch of
k-rack and I got it! :D ...I will completely and freely admit myself to
Viewpoint: the Center for Rehabilition of Opinionated and Outspoken
Posters. ;) Okay, so everybody liked it? Let's wait a couple of weeks and
if nobody else, complains then I'll, uh, well I'll eat my e-mail. :) I'm
the only one who's seen this too much? come on...

Ouch. That really hurts. ;( Was that a P, L, U or a R? Isn't there a
gentler way of getting your point (whatever it is, across)? Randy, I do
know what I'm talking about. :) I refrain from discussions on topics I
don't know about, trust me, if u can.

I did read my e-mail, which doesn't deliver tone of voice or a lot of the
subtle nuances of communication, which make for effective humor. So, I
didn't find it funny. It's my opinion, and DAMMIT, I have the right to it,
whatever it is. :D

That's kewl, I have also been too hasty in e-mailing or not fully described
that, which I was *trying* to get across. It's an attempt at communcation
and when it doesn't work, we get these flames and reply hell going on. I'm
all good with it, it ain't no thing. :)

Good thinking, Randy. Only, my reply was partly in fun, it wasn't really
that I didn't like it, it's obvious you haven't had to read this good times
crap as much as I have. I think it was pauly who was really getting upset,
don't u have a gripe with him? ;) Whatever, I (made the mistake) and
THOUGHT, others might share my opinion. So, by posting to the list, one
invites the opinions of others...

>go off-list at this point.

I think we should just kill this. I have said all I wanted to say in my
first reply. It seems that several people including Randy, pauly and I made
the mistake of taking list posts too seriously. I will surely maintain a
sense of humor while reading. I am very rarely serious while posting. This
is an exception.

I missed Sharif's post entirely.  Since there's so much mail that comes 
through my mailbox, I have to be rather selective.  I must have deleted
it
without reading it.  Which is EXACTLY what Mr. Torpis should have done
if he didn't want to read an NRR message.

It's been said before more eloquently, but: This is more than a rave
hotline, it's a rave family communication medium.  If that's not what
you
expected.... start your own mail list.  Cool?  This is not an uninformed
opinion, it's a simple observation.

OK.  I've been listening to this one for a while without saying 
anything, and now I've got a comment to make.  I checked out that
web page, meaning I actuallyl *read* it with an *open* mind.
I found it educational as it separated fashion from gangsta
affiliation.

I think I know where John's going with his feelings on "gangsta", 
and while I'm quite sure none of us intends a racial spin on the 
word, that seems to be the way it is construed by a handful of 
people on this list.  So, how about this:

"Toughguy".  As in, "the rave sucked because there were too many
toughguys hanging out, creating a negative vibe with their 'don't
even look at me, punk' attitudes."  

I suggest this because that's what I mean when I refer to the 
gangstas.  Folks in clothing that makes them look like their 
ideal of "hard" and "mean", assuming the "this is my space" 
pose and facial expressions, etc.  

We all know the type, and it isn't governed by color lines.  I've
seen plenty of every shade of brown hitting the 
down-with-my-homies stance and glaring at the more colorful
rave kiddies.

So since we're a family, and since some members of our family
are offended by the term, I myself will voluntarily try to 
reform my vocabulary.  

It's not a defeat, it's a loving compromise.

peace out from the Tally wigga,

S

Not me!  I'll use whatever words I feel like, and everyone else
can just deal ;)
But seriously, I find it interesting that whenever I hear/use the
word "gangsta," I think of a "caucasian" kid trying to be tough!
Toughguy sounds like a good, more generic term.  I encourage
people to sub it for the term gangsta/gangstah/gang-banger.
Peace & colorblindness,

Yeah I saw this.  I couldn't go to sleep that night so I figured TV would 
be a cure.  I never saw the show before but when I heard this I was 
really disappointed.  The caller asked of the effects of e and DR. Drew 
responded with-  ooohhh that stuff is dangerous and really scarry.  We 
are learning more and more about it everydday.  (paraphrased) It can 
cause paranoia, schitzophrenia and serios mood and social disorders.  
People die frome that stuff...-  That's all I can remember but It was not 
an accurate responce but looked like a blatent anti-drug statement "You 
take drugs - You will f@#k up your life for good" type of thing.  

One guy spends most of the time making fun of people's questions and 
problems while Drew comes out with an acctuall responce. Also according 
to the show and DR. Drew when ever people like to have sex alot these 
"nymphos"  always have a hidden past of abuse or sexual frustration.  
What's with that.  sheit I love sex cuz it's part of my nature, It's 
society that has a problem....
 

PLUR,

       Austin

Yes, it is time for Chai to break more into the mainstream.  

We have been serving NUB Chai for many months at small underground 
parties.  Many requests have come in from party-goers and promoters 
wanting us to brew the elixir at their massives (a term I take to mean 
larger, more mainstream, "raves").

The time is a upon us; a NUB team has been recruited and selected, more 
percolators and inventory have been stocked.  We originally planned to 
do this as a regular weekly, or even 3 nights a week, endeavor beginning 
in early February.  The preparations have already been made and we see 
no reason to wait any longer.  

The person spearheading this project has been looking at either the 
Origin or AcidBreaks parties for this weekend... but I do not know too 
much about either.  How large are these parties, what is the vibe/ 
histories of the promoters, and how would I go about making contact so 
that the NUB sattelite crew could make it somewhere worthwhile this 
weekend!

Feedback and comments welcomed...

Just wanted to let y'all know that I had a great time in your city while I
was at Macworld. Hugs to all the cool folks who emailed suggestions for
parties and clubs, and to everyone who stopped by the Alien Skin booth to
say hey. We ended up seeing MixMaster Morris one night (amazing drum 'n'
bass mixing), Dubtribe one night (met lotsa cool people), and popped our
heads into a couple of other clubs on other nights. And the record stores!
Wow. I'm trying to convince my boss to move the company out there from NC.
Anyway, I'm gonna have to sign off again, so thanks to everyone who made
our visit more fun. I'll be thinking of you when I'm dancing to your boy
Carlos tomorrow night in Durham... :)

Glad to see, btw, that there's smart talk about dealing with cops on this
list. I'm on the dcraves and seraves lists, too, and similar things are
happening in Atlanta and Baltimore, with cops hassling legal parties at
clubs, and ravers not knowing just what their rights really are. Maybe
there should be a central place for sharing strategies, like Hyperreal
(although lately hyperreal's seemed kind of a static site). I do know that
the folks who run Buzz, a regular party in Baltimore, wrote about some
success in going to the city council with their complaints about the cops.
I don't know those folks, but if anyone wants contact info for them, just
email me and I'll dig it up.

A friend of mine in Chapel Hill calls them "evil ravers". We laugh all the
time about it; the evil ravers can be nice people, but get them at a party
and they're all sneer. I don't get it.

todd we usually leave them alone and go find the happy ones morman

tim raises his hand in sfr class and curiously asks:

Okay, assume these premises are correct:

	1) Raves are a good thing which generally have a positive effect 
	   on people who attend them.
	2) If more people in this world raved, then the world would
	   be a better place.
	3) There is no one singular message to be 'gotten' from raves,
	   because everyone sees things differently; therefore, you
	   cannot ever say snobbily about someone, they don't 'get' raves.

Okay, if you accept these (and you may not), then is it a net positive 
for there to be more raves in our society; i.e., raves go mainstream?

Are we ravers in any position to always rail against 'the man' and 
lament the mainstream's inability to to be as open to new ideas as 
ravers tend to be, but then not teach the mainstrea about all the 
beautiful things that we've learned, when, after all this time, they're
finally knocking on our door?
And, if we want to teach others about what raves are all about,
will we be patient enough to put up with their extreme level of
newbie-ness, or do we say, oh, they're all money-grubbers, blah 
blah blah, keep it underground and all that?

I'm not trying to be belligerent here or anything, I just keep
thinking about this all the time.  Rave culture, however that's
defined, is oozing onto radio airwaves and television stations
and websites (certainly in a heavily-formatted kind of way, yes)
but the influence is undeniably there.   

Sorry to stretch this mainstream thread a little further, but I 
can't help it!  It's *so* weird--SF was the epicenter for the
political revolution of the late 1960's, and now it looks as if
it's going to be home to a major cultural shift.
Cool, huh? 

(please discuss)

PLUR,
Timothy

SDream walks over and raps Mr. McIntyre across the knuckles with a
ruler:

Tim, that's a beautiful sentiment, but that's not what's happening.
Rave music is going mainstream, not the rave mentality or the rave
vibe.  It's the difference between a cheetah, alive, beautiful, prowling 
the African plains, rippling power and speed, one of nature's most
refined predators, and a mangey, moth-eaten, dead cheetah head 
stuffed and mounted on a board and hanging in someone's den.

Knowhatahmean?

But, and this is just me speaking, the rave culture in part lives for
it's music, and you just know that once that music has been captured
by a major fashion vendor like MTV, skinned, cleaned, stuffed, and
mounted in a publicly consumable pose, it will be a far cry from 
the wild, powerful, rippling, thunder-clap of raw energy that you
see in it's natural habitat.  And, to me at least, that's a rather 
repulsive thought.

I just wanted to say that, in retrospect, I have lost my kewl about two
issues on the list already. If u read this stuff, u know what I'm talking
about. Sorry if my intensity (or stupidity) has been a negative. I try to
keep it on the up and up, but it doesn't always work. I hope you all
understand. :D I sent a private mail to Randy to apologize for going off as
well. I can't promise it won't happen again, but I can say that I always
mean to do what I think is for the best. Finally after chilling a bit, I
actually found that virus hoax to be a little funny. I never took the time
to consider that the person who wrote it was prolly as annoyed with the
whole good times hoax as I was. :)

I agree with your point, but I like to think that "rave" music will always
be on the cutting edge and "underground"... I am doing my part to try to
make it so. :)

Tim's pretty optimistic -- and I hope that he's right.  But I fear he's
not.  The people at MTV, etc, who are pushing rave music / clothing are
pushing "Product".  They are salesmen and they don't care if you pick up
any values about tolerance along the way.  They would just as soon be
selling grunge or coca-cola or levis.

You can't make a buck off of selling spirituality (at least to young
people :)

Are you suggesting getting a bunch of people pitching in to buy/run the place??
This sorta reminds me of a place at MSU where a very popular after hours
eatery shut down and some students pitched in to buy the place and open
it back up.

I think they may have been into for more purly business reasons tho...

   Well, I don't want to turn this into an aesthetic judgment debate,
because those don't ever go anywhere, but, well, I'm not entirely 
convinced that the stuff on MTV right now is crap.  I watched a pretty
kick-ass Orbital song/video as well as something from Underworld,
and it didn't strike me as watered-down at all.  People really *like*
the "wild, rippling, powerful, thunder-clap" stuff, and I think 
(well, more like hope, perhaps) that mass media won't dilute the stuff
very much at all.
Of course, it'll never match the feel of being 8 feet in front of an
Ethan or John Carel, sweat pouring down your face, feet stamping the floor
as hard as they can go, but maybe it's at least one little step in the
right direction?
naively optimistic, perhaps, but optimistic nonetheless,
Timothy

Hi all!  ]=)


 ummmm, I guess I'm being "forced" to perform at Gaiamind on Thursday, 
Jan. 23rd in the City. For my own health I would rather not but I'm 
currently managing the affairs of Richard Sun's Ambient Temple of 
I*Magi*Nation, Mystery School in the Bay Area in his abscence and this 
event came upon us rather suddenly.

 At this time I would like to thank Graeme (sp?) for assisting in the 
interface!!  :)

 So in the future youse folks can expect to see Dionysus Dreams and ATOI 
together in the Bay area.

 This party is a benefit for the Headwaters purchase plan. It will be 
heavily Psi-Trance with a lot of live bands. Should be 3 to 4 rooms. I am 
looking for transportation help but I'm trying to avoid using SFraves as 
much as I have been for that.

	I wonder if the people at MTV would agree with you. As far as some
of them, they were ground breaking people bringing all types of music to
more people than ever before, giving airtime to the "under-represented"
artists on Liquid TV. And now, they are giving air time to the next
under-represented form of music out there (in their opinion?)... How is
this different than say local "rave" mags purportedly reporting on
something like Burning Man, or even, on what is going on in the rave
community? Is it any different? It still seems to be trying to take 
certain events, >remove them from their context<, and dump them on a page 
for your eyes to feast on... Ok, that's a little harsh, but I just wanted 
to point out the parallels...
	MTV is spreading music. Are they claiming to spread rave? Are 
they saying this is what is playing at those ultra-hip (or whatever the 
latest cool word actually is) rave parties or are they saying, here is 
some ambient, neat huh? Like I have said, I do not have access to MTV 
(although I do watch star trek on a friends TV I will admit) so I do not 
know how it is being presented...
	I do have a question. In everyone who yells that everything is 
horrible now that techno is being picked up by mainstream media types, 
how much energy are each of us putting into making sure the kind of party 
that we are interested in still exists? How many people are now on the 
sfr-legal list? How many were yelling about New Year's busts?

My connection to Hyperreal was hyper-slow this week, so I didn't get to
update the calendar much during the week.  Sorry about that.  I might
not have gotten through all my mail either, so hopefully I didn't miss
anything.

Looks like a good weekend though...

Can anybody tell me where the good weeklies are? I've been up to S.F. 
(from San Jose) 3 times in a row, looking for six (6) different parties 
that had all posted to the SFRaves Calendar. They were all playing 
different (NON-techno/trance/house/etc) styles of music, such as country, 
ballroom dancing, Sinatra/Martin/Torme-shit...

I would be very grateful for the Names and Numbers for a good Wednesday 
weeklie. I favor trance, but would not be picky. As long as I can find a 
cool party to shake my booty at, I'm good to go.

Hey all-

The reason that the CCC party did not get busted on NYE was cause when the cops
came there was no money being taken at the door and the WHOLE party was
medatating at the time there was NO music playing so how can you bust a
"medation" party there were confused on what to do so they left. Plus Dutch
keep his composure through the whole thing.

sorry but that was my $0.02

MTV, or any 'business', exists to make money.  Any entertainment or
value you may get out of it is ancillary; programming is chosen to
attract the maximum number of viewers possible so that they can sell the
advertising for more money.  (In fact, the ONLY function of any
television program is to anesthetize you so deeply that you won't change
the channel when a commercial comes on.  They'd show nothing BUT
commercials if they thought you'd watch it...Home Shopping Channel,
anyone?)

A UG crew needs to take in some money in order to survive, but money
isn't the _reason_ you throw a UG.  You do it 'cause you like it and
hope you don't come out too far behind.

This is a large part of the 'change in vibe' that can be felt when going
between a UG and a regular concert you bought tickets for through BASS. 
If all people care about is the money, they won't get all the details
right, because their energy will go towards ensuring maximum $ intake
(shutting off the sinks and selling water, for instance, or not
permitting anyone to bring in food or water).  If people care about
throwing a good party, they will take care of themselves by making sure
they don't lose their shirts (at least, if they expect to do it more
than once), but most of the energy will still go towards making sure
everyone has the POTENTIAL to have a good time.  Of course, this is no
guarantee, but it's a good start.

on wed: Roots at 1015 Folsom.  Jeno and Garth are the main djs, two of the
best (and oldest) of the SF djs.  They don't get boring, these guys.  And
upstairs, some hella PHAT trip-hop style grooves.
this isn't the most lovey-dovey party in the world, but the music cannot be
beat and it goes to around 5am.  get ready to get sweaty.

I think you found the answer! Just don't play any music, and the cops won't
bust you.  It's as simple as that...  :^)

hi everyone,

ive been subscribed to the list for four or five months now and know a few of
you but still dont know many of you, so i thought it would be good to say,
"howdy."

im a part time graduate student at mills college in oakland doing premedical
science stuff. i was a social science/psychology major as an undergrad at a
really small obscure school that no one has ever heard of in western mass.
(simon's rock college) but then decided i wanted to be a medical doctor, so
im catching up.

i also work at children's hospital oakland research institute trying to
figure out ways to help sick kids get better. and one night a week i
volunteer at the berkeley free clinic (a super duper clinic!) as a lab tech.
sooo, when you come in and have to pee in a cup, get your blood sucked, or
have a q-tip stuck in an orifice i get to play with it!!! wohhhh!!! it is
fun!! :-o  i love love love it!

rave type things first bit me this past summer in D.C. i was taken to Buzz by
a friend and, boom!! then i moved to berkeley in august and now i have found
my way into the rave rave rave scene here. yay!!!!! sooooo sooooo very
fine!!!  <:-)  thank you all for making the parties slick and such... 

i hope to see and meet you folks soon, maybe at f8 on friday? im a short
quiet white boy with bleached hair and glasses (sooo unique! ;-)  ) so if you
see me or someone who looks like me go up and say "oooooggggaaaaboooogaaa!".
im sure i, or the person who is not me, would enjoy it tremendously =)  yup.

okay, well, i hope that was not too long and boring.

bye bye, *hug*

jeremy

ps: i used to have the email name thing of:  MarsMyRat and FlyingEggs. so
maybe you might recognize one of those names, but maybe not.

THe folks at MTV could go only so far.  They could package the music, the
clothing style, and proibably some parties (imagine an MTV promoted "rave"
in a sports arena near you.... *GAWK*) but they can NEVER, EVER, EVER
package the vibe, the energy, and the family-like unity of our SFR
community.  Yeah,  they might make a clone of me that's programmed to pass
out starbursts and give hugs to everyone.... "I am tymat of borg, you will
be assimilated, care for a starburst?"   My point being that MTV's plan to
package our "culture" for profit will have very little success as long as
YOU, the consumer, do not patronize it.  

Much love,

Why doesn't it work the other way? If it is NRR *and* the f***ing author
knows that enough to label it as such, why does the author send it here?

Would you send a NBWR (non-basket-weaving related) to the basketweavers
mailing list? If you feel u just have to share with somebody, start
a list called nrr@hyperreal.com. Seriously.

Who said anything about prohibiting rave family communications? The key here
is "rave". NRR are not rave related. Don't send them here. The onus should be
on *you* not to send it, not on me to delete it.

For every time I post here about this issue, I'd say 1000 NRR messages go. So
I can bitch every 1000 after being quiet for every 1000.

I do UNIX security stuff more than ever.  I read code and debug a lot of the
most common UNIX programs.  As far as systems administration there are good
pointers and papers about UNIX sys. admin and UNIX in general at
http://www.bsd.org.  If you've outgrown that kind of stuff you might wanna
get Secrets of the Magic Garden: UNIX System V Internals, a very good book
that can teach you how to find program holes such as buffer overflow or race
conditions that are security hazards in all UNIX systems.  Network wise, I
can suggest TCP/IP Illustrated vols. 1, 2, and 3.  

I will be at the F8 party this friday,  where will you be?  It's really nice
to know that some people appreciate what I do at raves.  As long as people
appreciate it I will continue to do it.  I'm not just trying to help the
vibe I'm also trying to set an example to everyone.  

Hope to meet ya soon!

much love, 
Anthony E

hello all-

haven't we been through this before?


i, matthew d. p. k. lanier, will help anyone who asks me how to filter
their messages, either using a commercial package like eudora, or on their
unix shell account.

if you don't like the e-mail that you get, you have 3 choices:

1)leave

2)filter out offending people/topics (or, be cool like neils and post your
filtering list to sfraves for more people to enjoy!)

3)shut up and deal with your laziness.

i am sick and tired of people constantly critizing the fact that there is
so much nrr mail on sfraves.  first, they enjoy the vibe and good nature
that exists on sfraves, the sense of community, and all that goes with it.
then, they complain about the nrr mail that is, in fact, and significant
contributor to the vibe and good nature that they enjoy.  i am shouting
here, hence my capitals: EITHER TAKE SFRAVES, OR LEAVE SFRAVES, BUT SHUT
UP, DO SOMETHING, AND QUIT YOUR BITCHING!!!

i totally respect those that filter out nrr messages: that's their choice,
and i've made it onto my share of kill files (4 that i'm aware of).  i
totally respect those that decide to read the nrr posts, and enjoy them.
what i don't respect are those who incessantly post about how sfraves isn't
what they like.  unfortunately, sfraves is a living, breathing organism
that has developed a life of it's own.  either accept that life and enjoy
it, (my strategy) or leave it and start your own list.  both are fine.


thank you.  for once, i aggree with john s lee.  i thought the day would
never come ;)

love to you all-

The purpose of NRR, as has been pointed out many times, is to allow a
sense of "online" community among people of similar interests (namely
electronic music and raving).

I understand that the philosophy of "if you don't like it, delete" can
be inconvenient. But thankfully, the "NRR" marking in the subject
provides a way for filters to do the work for you. Filters are a very
non-intrusive addition to anyone's mailing list experience.

Just filter out anything with "NRR" in the Subject, and everyone will
be happy. :)

Yup, I heard the rumor from various people as well. I heard Keoki has

Geez man, you have a point and all. i agree about cops, but are we
slightly throwing out PLUR. You don't wanna kill them. Its the promoters
fault for not having a permit and fucking up. Not the cops. Cops give us
a hassle no matter what, but its the promoters fault if they dont have a
permit.
Just like Origin. Cops just doing their duty (even though they were jerks
about it)
Nomad didn't have a permit. Now I know, no more Origins.
PLUR,
Paul

Yeah, thats me. But I didn't go to Eminence at all. I stayed home and
looked for all the flyers around my room and put them up on my wall.

I would make the pants for you for sure, but you would need to buy the
material and stuff. Yeah, Anny told me about her knew girl friend, I was
all, what happened to Libby? I don't know but all I know is that she is
turning totally les or something because she is complaining about guys
being jerks and all. 

Of course you guys are still friends though. We are all fam. Remember we
went to Lepidoptera. Nothing can hurt that fact ever.

You know, that store on El Camino and Lawrence on the side near the Taco 
Bell and K-Mart called Fabric Warehouse or something. They have tons of

Yep, I think that the scene is deteriorating. And right about the time I
came into it May of last year. It really sucks, but I think It will
really get a whole lot bigger, before it gets really smaller. Hopefully
It will get big enough to turn into something where you can tell that it
is commercial and everyone knows about it, then the real good raves will
start completly underground and no one will know about them not even
flyers or anything. And we can call them something else or something
instead of raves and all the real ravers who are there for the vibe will
go to them and we can leave the bad scene to the mean people. 
The other option is too try to ignore them, or even better yet, I think
If nothing but ravers storm a massive, there will be no room for mean
people. If every raver show up supper early for one massive and we all
get in before any meanies get in and the line is miles long and for the
first half has nothing but ravers and good vibes in it then we might be
three times over capacity and they wont have any room to squeeze any
meanies in.

Well, somethign big will definetly happen to our scene in 97. If not then
98. 
But raving is the biggest thing of the 90's even though it started way
back in the 70's and such, we will be telling our grand children about
raves. ANd they will be doing theire new underground thing.

PLUR,
Paul

To whom it may concern ---

I wish to strongly disagree with a message forwarded to me by
lycos@cybertribe.com, an anonymous cyberspace entity that shreds
radical tunes while lamo suits like yourselves sit around in  dark
offices one-upping each other in puerile competition involving how
tight your ties and collars can get before all traces of normal brain
functioning is cut off.

Here is the contents of a particularly quetionable message that has
come to my attention, probably written during an incredible display of
hypoxic jurisprudence.

>Lycos believes that you have been using the Lycos name including,
>without limitation, in the designations "Sub Commander Lycos" and
>"lycos@cybertribe.com".  Lycos is concerned that this activity
>constitutes, among other things, trademark infringement, trademark
>dilution, and unfair competition under the Lanham Act and/or the common
>law.  This activity may also constitute an unfair or deceptive act or
>practice.

>Boston, MA  02110

I distinctly recall seeing the name "Sub Commander Lycos" as a DJ
and/or rave promoter name from various underground "rave" parties as
far back as maybe '92 or '93. I have a few tapes of "Sub Commander
Lycos" performances from around this timeframe as well. This would
indicate prior use of this name prior to the incorporation of Lycos
Inc, which certainly happened after 1994.

I will be happy to testify to the fact that the word Lycos has 
significant prior use before your supposed trademark. My evidence
includes DAT backup tapes created in 1993/1994 that include internet
mentions of this name prior to the existance of Lycos as a body
corporate (or even as a lamo research project at CMU). Sounds like you
lawyer-folk haven't done a proper prior use search for this word.
(Meanwhile, whois seems to indicate that the record for "lycos.com" was
created on 13-Apr-95.) Perhaps sub commander lycos should be suing you?

Oh, by the way, your search engine lists a few thousand hits of words 
that are trademarked to "Niels P. Mayer" or "Niels Mayer" (feel free to
search for my name on your site). Please note that the implicit use of 
words trademarked to me implicitly binds any for-profit corporate use
of this word to payment of $1.00 (US) for each unauthorized commercial
use of words trademarked by me.  Each user search-hit on the lycos site
for words trademarked by me consistutes a "use." Please pay up
immediately or cease and desist listing any web pages with my name
and/or trademarked words on your site. I wouldn't want my words
appearing on a site run by lawyer-plagued assholes such as yourselves.

Sincerely,
	Niels Mayer.

PS: As a result of your stupid and pointless letter, I am going to send
a suggestion to all the rave lists across the country, e.g. sfraves,
socal-raves, mw-raves, ne-raves, and USENET alt.rave the WE ALL BOYCOTT
WWW.LYCOS.COM. Each of these mailing lists ranges from 100-1000 users,
so you will hopefully get fewer hits from your scum-sucking
advertizers. I am also going to post my opinion that Alta Vista,
Excite, Yahoo, HotBot and any other sites other than Lycos contain far
better and more accurate search engines. My dog could write a better
search engine than Lycos, and I don't even have a dog.

PPPS: I am in no way affiliated with "Sub Commander Lycos", just a
satisfied fan of this excellent rave/house DJ and promoter.

Yeh, but if the values are strong enough, they can't help but be picked up
along the way. Use "the salesmen's" energy to move your product at the same
time he moves his.

Do you not think that if "rave" music becomes popular, that no one will be
affected in a positive way. Imagine all the people who have never been
exposed to the music who will hear it and like it, and then be curious and
go to a party...

And if you think that the mainstream muzic biz endorsement of your music
will kill it, you're wrong. When they endorsed "alternative rock", many
smaller, true alternative labels were able to get more distribution; many
smaller underground bands were able to be heard.

And the more mainstream "raves" there are just leave room for more
underground parties.

So there. :->

Wrong. Total oversimplification. (like: all raves are just big drug parties.)

Programming is chosen to attract a select demographic - a certian type of
viewer that specific ads can be presented to, be it an ad for a similar
type of music, a fashion popular with that demographic group, or even
political messages targetted and customized for that demographic group.

Narrowcasting is in, and has been for quite a while. You now go after a
specifically targetted demographic and do the best job of providing that
demographic what they need to be satisfied (so they won't go anywhere
else). Brand Loyalty!

>(In fact, the ONLY function of any

So you're so anesthetized that you can't even buy the product???

The function of a program is to hook you into the story or whatever so that
you don't want to miss any of it. In fact, if it is such a good story or
program, you'll want to know who the people are who sponsor it.

>They'd show nothing BUT

If the commercials were compelling enough, yes. But they're not going to
endanger their audience at the risk of a little fast cash. TV station
economics are much more long term than short term. MTV existed many years
while losing money because they knew they were building audience loyalty
that would pay off later (and it has).

Undergrounds are like "hobby businesses". They are usually great for the
consumer, as minimal thoughts were given to the economics of sustaining the
business long term.

However, you don't see many "hobby TV networks" (although some would argue
that Fox was Rupert Murdoch's hobby) because the scale of the economics are
just too high. MTV pays millions of dollars for their satellite
transponders. Of course they need to make a lot of money, of course they
are going to go after the mainstream. But they are going to go after the
fringes of the mainstream. Otherwise they'd be broadcasting soap operas all
day long.

>If all people care about is the money, they won't get all the details
>right, because their energy will go towards ensuring maximum $ intake
>(shutting off the sinks and selling water, for instance, or not
>permitting anyone to bring in food or water).

Many places are rented with the promoter guaranteeing a certian take at the
bar. If no one is drinking, and no one is buying water, then the promoter
has to come up with the difference. (Not to mention annoying the bartenders
who aren't getting tips. And they survive off tips.)

Ask yourself: would you pay an extra $4-5 for a party with free water?

WAY TO GO!

Everyone should know this is what we need more of.  The law is such a
messed up concept.. some people who have built up twisted egos with
money- and power-wielding ideals take it upon their own hands to hire or
become those "lawyer types", and intimidate anyone they please.  The
supposed purpose of the law is to keep order and fairness.. and we
should all do our best to keep it that way.  For a long time I thought
it best to ignore the law, refuse to acknowledge its authority.  But
when taken to extremes, I can see how much better it is to throw the
same shit back at them.. two can play at that game.. there's no reason
to let corporations be the ones wielding power with the law.  What the
law MEANS is whatever we make of it.. we can refuse its existence, we
can see it as an enemy....  or we can use it as a tool.  It's good to be
able to use it as a resource without having to hold it up as an ideal..

Sending great energy to all of you in sfr-legal, and those who will not
go down silently...

I think promoters should consider using short range communications devices
such as a pair of walkie talkies at raves.  Assign one person to work as a
lookout and when a police car is present that lookout would send a message
to the other person that there are law enforcers present and signal the DJ
to "turn down" the music for a while until the coast is clear again.  Maybe
think about using a hand scanner to listen in the police frequency to find
out if there are any noise complaints.  this sounds like a weird idea but it
seems like this is the only way we could prevent our parties from being shut
down.  Any ideas?

Dear ass,

That was private mail.  You are obviously very, very, green to this list,
or very, very stupid. You current flurry of e-mails does not give a clear
picture as to either, although there are many indications that both
conditions may be true.

Please do not post private mail to the list.  It is , er, impolite at best.

Now, let's please take this to thisisstupid@nowhere.com.

Who left the door open? ;)

Out w/o value like a pissclam,
John

Friday, thank god it's fridaaaay,


Hello all of you happy scenesters and, what?  Yet another glorious
weekend is upon us...  I do hope to see all your happy cheery
cherry-cheeked faces around the town in the next 48.  So where will I
be...

Friday:  F-8  Dancing'n'Trancing...  F-8 are notoriuos for thier dark
and hard sets...  Let's hope they don't miss the point and dissapoint...

Saturday: Space Children sound Kewl, but I think I might  _Focus_ in on
a south bay party this night...  Too bad about Harmony, but that's the
way the disco biscut crumbles...  Also, there's not enuff south bay
parties IMO,  
cmon' promoters:
          -There must be a way 
                           for us to play 
                              in the south bay...  
(I guess that rhyme is pretty 'played out')
Anyways, wherever you may be, be safe and remember: you're never alone
when the vibe is right....

C-U in the void,

First of all, may I buy you a clue?

This subject is _very_ rave related, maaybe the most relevant 
topic that one could have.  JSL (as many of us who have been partying for
5+ years) is concerned by cavalier statements that seem to characterize
particular cultural or ethnic groups. We started raving particularly to
combat that type of behavior and to show folks that it was better to be
open and accepting, they fearfully and cliquish. If one goes to a party
say, in Concord
or Pittsburg (Ca), You will see a lot of attendees in tight jeans, with
marlboro t-shirts, tattoos, etc.  I never hear people talking about
rednecks or the like at parties. Last month, I helped throw a party in
Chico, a "rural" city towards the middle of california, my mind filled up
with images of beer drinking, meth snortin, cowboy hat wearing, rednecks
who would not like the looks of me:), some of my friends helped to fuel the
images :), suffice it to say that I and my possee (who was very racially
mixed), were received with open arms, appreciation, love and respect, more
"PLUR" then I have seen in many a day at some of the SF parties, and we
were there to play HOUSE music :) 
The kids there, on the visual surface, were more towards the the stereotypes
that my mind had made up, but there behavior DID NOT FIT MY PICTURES!
We all have latent racism, it is unavoidable because our society
is latently racist. The cues to respond to people by the color of their skin
HAS BEEN DRILLED INTO US FOR THE LAST 400 YEARS.  Confront the fact that
whether you are black or white or chinese you will react to this conditioning.
I find myself wanting to check my car door locks as I drive through a
neighborhood where the complexion of the population deepens, and I grew up
in Bedford Stuyvensant, Brooklyn which, is one of the hardest places on the
planet. I've observed my reactions and noticed how conditioned we all are to
react along racial lines and to call it something else.  RAVING IS PART OF THE
CURE FOR THIS BEHAVIOR! When you feel that reaction in your gut, you have
some choices to make, it takes courage but also common sense, I must admit
that it is a bit easier for me to come up to some "gangsta" looking kids
and say
"Hey, what's up! You havin a good time? Good to see you here!", I'm 6'5" and
280 lbs. So the confidence that goes with the body type can be an asset.
But I've also seen 100 lb "Rave Goddesses" melt the frontin attitude of
some of the
toughest gangsters, without them disrespecting her as well.  It's all in
the Vibe and the attitude that you portray, that is why some of us rave. If
raving is about changing the world through the Vibe (which is what it is
for me) then the Vibe starts with you and spreads out from there.
"Gangstas", cops, rednecks, soldiers, ( I was actually at a party once
where National Guard MPs told the cops to back off cuz they had no
jurisdiction here, props to Martin O!) it's all the same, the goal is to
have them all "get it".

The fact that this keeps coming up again and again indicates that it is
something that this community needs to deal with and can't (or shouldn't)
be swept under the rug.  Just as we all have residual racism that has been
ingrained into us by way of our parents, teachers, televisions, magazines,
and yes, language, years of that can be washed away on the dance floor,
I've seen it happen time and time again,and it's truly amazing, but, guess
what?  In order for it to happen you gotta have _EVERBODY_ at your party,
rednecks, cholos, homeboys, gangstas, etc. Fight the attitude not the style.

The key is that the people who know how to generate the Vibe have to be
present in large numbers, they have to be strong and capable of radiating
that love vibe energy.  What I'm talking about is not teddy-bear hugging,
and you don't need E to get there.  You can still be a Macho/a (if that's
your thing) and radiate this energy.  It's where your coming from not how
you act or what you take, or who you are that counts. There is a critical
mass that is reached at
parties, if you have more attitude then Vibe the party will suck.  If you
have 
folks that an old mate of mine referred to as "Ambiance Engineers" come to
your
party they can transform the space.  I'm not talking about cliques or
"A-lists" or anything like that, I'm talking about VIBE.

Oh, they have done just that. There is now a 24 infomercial channel. We
don't get the Comedy channel but the cable company just added the f*#&ing
infomercial channel. What joy....

What you are missing in this equation is the fact that MTV and anyone else
who wants to ride on this potential gravy-train is going to introduce a
whole lot of consumers to this market that don't get "it", and have no
desire to get "it" unless it is the coolest, hippest, MTVest thing around.

Since I'm the author of the "NRR" post that has caused this discussion I
shall put in my $0.02!

I don't think one person out of hundreds justifies that anybody who is an
author of an "NRR" post should stop.

First of all the people on this list are my "SFRAVER" friends...

Second of all since they are my "SFRAVER" friends and we all are under one
domain then it makes perfect common sense to post it to the list for I sure
would not like to write hundreds of email addys.

I'd rather read or delete an "NRR" post then read a bunch of whining post
about an 'NRR" post that someone didn't like. (did that make sense) =)

Its all very simple.  When I feel that I can touch hundreds of people with
something funny or interesting then I'm going to continue posting "NRR"
messages.  There are people on this list that never post and maybe they are
having a bad day and I don't know that, right.  But then they receive this
silly message that makes them smile or laugh or just plain and simple makes
them forget about whatever it is bothering them for a moment.

Would you want to take that away from someone?  No!  I should hope not.

So lets look at this as a way of communicating with all our friends on the
list as opposed to governing it.

Thanks for your time,



Siphon!

The mainstream is knocking on the door because this is a market to
exploited, not out of the search for some greater truth.

We've used police scanners before to find out whats going on. Fortunately,
the party continued interupted, but if an officer had been called to bust
it up or investigate, we would have known. Because we throw parties in a
small town and don't do anything blatantly illegal, we don't use scanners anymore... it sucks to be on scanner duty when you should be out dancing.

I think the goal for promoters should be to reach a peace with the law enforcemnet officers...that's what we've been able to do, and its nice... no worries :)

First I would like to thank those of you that have responded to me about
seeing a lawyer to find out what our rights are. Here are the
questions that I have come up with:

1) Does shutting the doors and meeting the police outside have any legal
   advantage?

2) Can the "person in charge" refuse the police entry, or does(can?) the
   property owner/renter have to?

3) What constitutes "probable cause" with respect to entering a building
   without the permission of the person in charge(or owner/renter)?

4) When is it legally necessary to have a permit for an event? I have been
   told in Oakland for instance, if there are more than 50 people in a
   building, a permit is necessary. Is this true, or is it at police 
   discretion?

5) How do questions 1-4 apply to a private residence as opposed to a 
   warehouse or other location?

6) Do the police have any right to force us to hire off-duty police
   officers in order to be granted a permit? If so, under what law? 

7) What benefits/liabilities would forming a non-profit organization to
   throw parties(with profits going to charity of course) have? 

8) We have been told in the past by police that if we are taking
   *any* money at the door, our event is a business and needs to be
   permitted. However, people can take donations at a church and they do
   not appear to need special permits to do so. Is this because they are
   a non-profit, or do they have special standing for being a church,
   or ?????


Well that is all I can think of at the moment. I am a little disappointed 
that I have not heard from any promoter on this issue. I know at least a
few of you are out on the list, and it is really in all of our best
interest to know the answers to some of these questions.  
 
I am posting this to sfraves and sfr-legal seperately. Cross-posting to
both lists makes having seperate lists silly....

If anyone has anything else to contribute, whether it be additonal
questions that should be asked, money, or the name of a good civil rights
attorney, please let me know. Also anyone interested in attending the
consultation is welcome.

I wouldn't use Lycos, even if my life depended on it. Get this:

lycos search for "lycos" yields 6955 hits
AltaVista search for "lycos" yields about 400,000

Hmmm, which one would you use?

OK, I'm planning a snowboarding day trip this comming up Wednesday.  Wednesday
is the only day my friend can go (and he's driving me).  So if you want to go
with us and you have a way to get to the snow, we would love to have you along.
I don't know where we are going yet (I'll know on Monday) but Bear Valley
has a weekday rate that was either 2 for 1 or half off a single lift ticket,
I can't remember.  Anyways I should be a little more organized by Monday.  
Mail me if you think you might want to go.

Does anyone realize the irony of using a quote from the head man from
the band Whitehouse?

Ameba has a link to the Whitehouse home page.

-- 
"The trouble with avant garde music is that it has lost its original
meaning and now has as many rules and clichs as
country or rock & roll. If in 50 years time they will look back at the
early 1980s, or whenever, and say that was the
new avant garde era, that event must be avoided if we are to remain
true." - William Bennett

You can't really blame them if they don't know what "it" is.  None of us were
born knowing.   We found it anyway, one way or another.  The music itself has
great power.  If you get a lot more people dancing to it, many of them will
find
"it" sooner or later.

But it IS. More so than MTV itself ever can be.

   Well, I could care less if they market it or not!  MTV can sandwich as 
many commercials as they want for bottled water or neon backpacks between
the videos, which I happen to find interesting, as far as I'm concerned.
People will always trade goods--that will never change--and so advertising
will always exist.  I'm over it.

   The thing that really interests me is the fact that the videos, which
are the real attraction to viewers, are now from DJ's.  And instead of the
tired old '80's-style videos--you know, big hair, gratuitous guitar solos,
silly shots of band members running around on stage while fireworks
explode, etc.--we've finally got raytracing, computer-generated trippy 
graphics, and hard trance all coming together.  As far as aesthetic
experiences go, I don't really find music videos *that* interesting,
personally, and the medium is of course still the same, but the content
is changing, which I think is really cool.
   As far as marketing and the whole "TV is run by the man" vibe, well, 
I dunno.  Here's how I see it: commercials make TV free.  They're what pay
for it, so I tolerate them.  Because I'm aware that commercials are trying 
to manipulate me, I can filter them out, and still get the cool programs I
like for free.

Well, those who will patronize this will soon find themselves not really
getting what they expect (provided they really know what our scene is all
about).  They will be sent to the massive "raves" full of gangstas (no pun
intended, I use the term loosely) and people who don't know how to use
substances properly.  That is what the underground really has,  we have
unity, we try our best to practice PLUR, and we try to be a family and share
our experiences with everyone openly.  If MTV wants to commercialize raves,
fear not, we still have the underground to turn to and those who have been
around will know how to reach it. There is something similar happening with
the Internet... but I'm not going to discuss Internet politics here.

I remember about a year ago when MTV featured Herbal X: the E substitute...
which in my opinion was also full of shit.  The only thing I watch on MTV
thses days Beavis & Butthead... huh huh huh ... MTV sucks... huhu huhu... 

PLUR,
Anthony E

Glad I could give you a god laugh, but indeed it is silly to think
that somene would _be_ a certain way just because of dress.  The truth is
that most "rednecks" would not go to a rave, if they did then maybe they would
dress in "rave" clothes maybe not, the main thing is to beware of
gangstas/rednecks/cops/etc in raver's clothing :)

Hey there folks ...

My housemate and I are planning a road trip down to LA in late February and
we were wanting to know about good record stores (trance, techno etc) and
if any good parties are happening out near LA? Like does anyone know about
the Moontribe full moon parties and if they are still happening (and if
there is a phone number) ?

I would much appreciate any info any of you can supply.

PS... thanks to all who supplied me with raver/lightbulb jokes - these gave
me much faith in the ability of ravers to laugh at themselves...things sure
do get quite serious out here sometimes....

But TV *isn't* free. I get a cable bill every month. There is nothing free

Hey everyone.

My show "Underbrush" has a new time slot this quarter. I'm on Friday 
nights from midnight to 3am. keep me in mind if youre not out partying, 
or if your party gets busted (perish the thought) and you still want to 
dance or listen to music.

As always, my focus is on intelligent dance music, ambient stuff, and 
especially that nice jungle sound. Which reminds me, if any of you 
talented djs out there would be interested in guest-spinning on my show, 
let me know. I would love to have a guest dj every week.

First show of the new quarter is tonight, so give it a listen,

dj radon

I like the bit about Goa trance tearing up the underground (Nucleus is a
huge event featuring, among much else, Total Eclipse live, Dutch (go SF!),
Christopher Lawrence).  I can just imagine the big FXed voiceover, like the
old days... "MeTALLiCAAaaa..aa"

What is your experience working for, working with, or talking to owners
or directors of large (multi-million) dollar businesses?

And this is the way they get maximum viewership.  There are already lots
of stations out there that try to be all things to everyone (the
'superstations' like TBS) and MTV decided that instead of settling for a
tiny slice of a big pie, they could get ALL of a smaller pie.

Thus the 'diversity' of MTV, where they air all the different specialty
shows like Headbangers Ball, 120 Minutes (and I'm probably way out of
date here but I don't own a TV), exists in an attempt to get maximum
viewership.  Narrowcasting, whatever you want to call it, is an effort
to get maximum viewership *given the resources available*.  Just because
someone knows they *can't* be ESPN doesn't mean they don't *want* to be.

Big business owners think completely in terms of dollars, and exceptions
are very rare, because if you don't you will be surpassed by someone who
does.  This has been driven home to me many times in my dealings within
and with business.

Eventually you have to sleep so you can go to work, and you'll probably
have to shop on the way back.

And the reason for this is to show commercials.  TV stations *spend*
money to make shows, buy FCC licenses, operate transmitters...they spend
*lots* of money.  The only reason they can is because they *make* money
off of commercials, and they will air as many as they think you can
stand.  The more you want to watch the show, the more commercials they
can air, and the more they will charge.

I remember when I was a kid <cue Grampa toothless voice> and they would
show a whole Looney Tunes short before cutting.  Now they only show
minute-long slices of them out of context before cutting to the
commercial, because they figured out kids will watch anything
entertaining, even a commercial.

Your words, not mine.  "Pay off."  All that matters.

I rarely go to bars (maybe twice a year, friends drag me) because I
don't drink.  I usually avoid raves at bars for this, among other
reasons (I think 21+ is discriminatory, I dislike the bar atmosphere,
etc.)

> Ask yourself: would you pay an extra $4-5 for a party with free water?

I am willing to pay whatever's reasonable given the circumstances.  Most
bars or bar events have a lower cover than warehouse one-offs, but I pay
the higher admission when I go out because the enjoyment is worth it.

For example, I have no problem paying a buck or two for a coat check.  I
wish more parties would have one, so I could wear my nice waterproof
mountaineering jacket instead of my heavy old green water-sponge army
coat, and could bring a backpack full of goodies without worrying about
it getting stolen.  Many ski areas have these, and with all the messages
on the list saying "Someone stole my backpack", ...

I am psyched cause its been so long since Ive been able to get to an event
out here!  (well, maybe a couple of months :-)

Keep an eye out for me and show much PLUR to my guests cause they are all
first-timers and are probably not sure what they are getting in to!  I
will be carrying my way cool Sailor Moon backpack (I luv it!) and
possibly dispensing something sweet if I can get to shopping 1st.

YES YES YES!!! FINALLY - a real dance music radio show on a weekend

Good luck to DJ Radon!

Everyone needs to send a copy of this back to the original owner.
Non-Rave related material of this type should not be permitted.
Waste of bandwidth. I get enough messages a day to read to have this bomb

I have said this before: large commerical events that are being called
"raves" are going to destroy the scene in exactly the way it was destroyed
in 93. This is the beginning of a 97 that will promote and suck dry in the
name of business and capitalism that which is our passion.

Keep your parties small, keep the parties you go to small. That's all you
can do. When the shit hits the fan, just duck and go underground as far as
you can.

Your are correct: lumbricoid, mainstream, corporate money grubbers will 
not kill the true UG. Despite all the corporate Punk Rock, 924 Gilman, a 
DIY punk clud in B-town are still going srong. 924 Gilman are still the 
same filthy, anarcho-sydincous colective they always were. The true punk 
ethic remains untouched.

So what if more ordinary people are, like so many magpies, fooled by the 
sparkle of a die cut, four colour flyer. What difference does it make if 
thousands more pod people flock to duff massives. I know, and have known 
for some time, how to avoid shite parties. All the extra mainstream 
pondscum won't have much effect on me.

The NRR debate continues... I'll leave off on that for now (itching to 
get out of work!!) but I just have to say about this particular instance-

IMO, Todd is a great asset to our community, often seen (until recently) 
at every party with his Dr. Seuss hat and many toys - and contributing 
RR and NRR wisdom to this list.  Here he is sharing his joy with his 
extended family (in his particular Todd-sense-of-humor way) about a very 
major life event that's happening for him.   NRR maybe, but hardly 
trivial for Todd and shared in a way entertaining for us.  I think it's 
great.

We're a community of living people - of friends - not just rave automatons.

Even so, the filter "NRR" is a pretty good resolution to the debate 
(which he did use, BTW).

	This is one of those things that I can see cops having a valid 
point that raves are evil because not everybody figures out that most 
smaller parties are breaking laws just by happening. Raves turn the 
average person into a law breaking criminal...
	Now having said that, I am going to turn around and say a few 
things about permits. Permits are nice ploy to keep certain things from 
happening and are issued by good God loving people who think their way is 
the only way (note, not all god loving or other loving people are this 
way). I do not like having to obtain a permit to allow people to come and 
dance at outdoor parties. I do not like having to pay for permits for a 
free outdoor party. I used to think that permits were a necessary evil to 
prevent overlap of people wanting to use the same spot, but the thing is, 
most of the time, no one is allowed to use the spot either because of 
lack of funds or the fact that their use voilates the amplified music 
laws.
	Now, taking this a astep further. Some parties out there hope that
in bringing people out that they will realize that the individual is
responsible for oneself and that this governmental bullshit that mandates
that everyone else must take responsiblity for everyone else is bullshit,
at least to the degree which it is heading. You do something, you must
deal with the consquences. That is not to say that no one will help you
deal with it, but it is the individual itself (ok, that sounds horrible
being all gender neutral but this applies to both females and males so
please try to absorb the weight of it anyway) who must deal with shit.
	Now, I pull a sound system out, the police come and bust it, it is
my responsiblity to deal with it. If I do not tell people that this a
break in party, and we get busted, it is my shit to bear because I did not
give everyone enough information to make an informed decision to act on. 
But here is one thing you can pretty much count on which will not be
reiterated (usually because it is a well know fact and people usuall don't
care and it would probably be looked down on even more if the voicemail
were to say, this party is not permitted), if it is a small underground
party, it probably does not have permits. That is the current state of 
things.

	Now some really strong personal beliefs start here, be prepared
for my opinionated rant mode. I do not like the separation between party
goer and "promoter" especially which was implied earlier in the original
post. Raves are not so much a busniess to me (though I will grant that
they provide for maintaining my sound system which is the only things that
use it), and so I really do not like pushing this kind of shit on the
promoters unless they are saying it will be a permitted party and then do
not produce the permits. If you don't like unpermitted parties, do not go
to them.
	I do not like the attitude of "we paid some money for this, so you
better produce" for underground low cost parties - it is orthogonal to
just about everything that rave represents to me (but granted, everyone
has different defintions of what rave is to them, and thus, there are lots
of different kinds of raves). That kind of shit belongs in the realm of
big commerical parties. If you want to be entertained, go somewhere else
that is about entertaining you. Do I have attitude problem? Possibly, but
as I watch raves go from open spaces where people can do what they want to
enforced 12 step workgroups where I can no longer bite my lower lip (which
is what happens when I dance) because it might look like a scowl to
someone, or blowing fire on the beach scares people, I find my kind of
rave is dying in favor of raveLite put on by WeKnowBest.
	Come on, promoters are people like everyone else. There are
promoters organizing parties cuz they love parties, there are promoters
who look at raves as a business and then there promoters who are in
between - some who throw legit parties, but it takes all their time, so it
also has to be their business, others who deliver a legit party but are
only doing it cuz it is a decnt way to make money in some parts of the
world.  People complain about setting the dj on some platform, but many of
the same people would not want to move speakers or be involved in projects
to support their supposed "community" which falls unto the shoulders of
some of these "promoter" types. 

end long long long rant

---> Even "virtual" MTV could never replace the unique love and positive 
energy that each one of us possess within our Rave "culture." 
At the first rave each of us went to, (whether it be five years ago;three years 
ago; or just last month), the experience was phenomenal in one aspect or 
another. New, invigorating, and inviting. The music blazed its way 
through our ears, and the many beautiful, happy, and unique people who 
decorated the floor -- danced and danced to the many beats of electronic 
music. Wow, what an experience! And it called us back, time and time 
again. Sucking us up into its vacuum, where we could expel our energy -- 
and open up our hearts and minds to a whole new world. 
The music, the dance, the people -- The Rave -- are all unique, and each 
compliment the experience that we share.

---> All music, from classical to jazz to hard rock to techno, has 
its strength among various individuals. Music is universal. Music is 
eternal. And the music we share as ravers is beautiful. 
When big business wants to exploit the land to extract money, is the land 
any less beautiful or sacred?
Hence, if MTV wants to exploit the music for financial gain, should the 
music become any less beautiful or sacred within us?

Hola Beautiful People!

Ponder this:

(1)  I work with a very, how shall we say, conservative group. Some of these 
folks are so boring, life is nothing more than running models and writing 
reports. Fun is watching TV on a Friday night. I view them as somewhat 
lifeless; i.e., they have no spunk or zest for life or vibrant aura around 
them.  Even when others of us go out and go drinking (do not start a thread) 
and get a little crazy, they avoid such situations at all cost. Human shells, 
no twinkle in the eye. Robots.

So anywho, I was thinking to myself while chopping garlic, what would happen if 
I got one of these persons to go to a super vibey rave, and _gasp_ take X? 
Would the freedom and love, with the help of the synthetic, open up the 
internal eye and allow him/her to take a step out of his/her persona, and see 
his/her life as it is-- plain and dull, without spark? Or would this only occur 
if that person was, consciously or not, seeking something? If that person were 
not seeking, would the power of vibe be unable to overcome? And if not, how 
would that person react? Would they see the lights, hear the beat, feel the 
funk and get panicky---or, perhaps worse, they do see themselves, and not like 
what they see, yet become depressed as they realize they are somewhat stuck in 
the situation theyre in? 

(2) I guess I wonder this as sometimes it seems that people need to become one 
of these work-centric robots in order to succeed. Countless friends have 
stopped going out and experiencing new things, citing a lack of energy or being 
to busy with work.  Like it or not, we are typically graded (and rewarded) 
against a jury of our peers. How does one stay  true to oneself (for lack of a 
better term), yet succeed, especially if that success comes in a more 
traditional industry? Essentially, is some level of selling out necessary to 
excel? Except for a very few chosen: artists, musicians, super-programmers, or 
the independently wealthy-- it seems that few people are able to truly excel 
without altering who they are to a certain extent. Keep in mind, in this defini
tion, success doesnt necessarily mean money, status, fame or power.  It means 
being or doing the best at what it is you choose to do. 

WELL, these thoughts may be too heavy for a Friday night, so lets talk BEATS!! 
Origin sounds good tonight. Beyond race is always a good call. Say hi if you 
get a chance: white dude, black hair, garlic breath. OUT!

Nathan

1) You need a hug.
2) If you don't like it leave.
3) Get a mail filter
4) Learn to use your delete key. It's _really_ easy. I'm sure even you 
   can do it.

 I like it when people post humor regardless if it is rave related or 
not. Telling me what to do (send mail back to the originator) is fucked 
up and infantile. What should be permitted on this list is not for you to 
determine. If you don't like the openness and acceptance of diversity on 
this list, start your own. I'm sure you'll be very happy talking to 
yourself.

How can you consciously write such blatant contradictions in the same
sentence?  Members of this list have just as much right to be negative as
they do to be positive.

Positivity lulls you to sleep.  Dissent keeps you on your toes ;)

And it's off... Ravers with Homepages is up and running.

the page doesn't have everything I had originally intended, but I linked it today anyways. You can add a link from your homepage directly to this one, if you please... It will be updated regularly, and sites can be added at the page.

the URL is

http://www.chosen.org/chosen/sites/ravers/ 

if you want to add a link from your site, I'll make it easy.

<<XMP>

<<a href="http://www.chosen.org/chosen/sites/ravers/">Ravers with Homepages<</a>

<</XMP>

If the XMP tags show, do not include those.


Thank you for your contributions so far...

lets come together and make the web belong to the ravers, like it should. =o)

hello all...yes, i was temporarily deleted from the internet, but now I 
am hooked!  (.net, that is...).  some of you know me as 
TGARCI02@FARINON.HARRIS.COM AT ccstmp, however today was my last day, as 
i was a temp by choice.  =]  however, diehards diehard, so i am back as 
deepfog.  which i always was, but my friends call me Tony.  no, i am not 
dj tony.  nor am i the tony garcia from new york.  

well i decided to do a little self-intro, cause i never really did one, 
you see i just kindo blatantly moved into this list and got "keyboard 
happy" (wasting bandwidth) (like a hog.  just call me deep-hog).  

anyway, on to the intro!

my first pahty was in oct 1991.  it was a rave called sharon.  i remember 
that cause it was even more cutting edge to me than live 105 
was...remember back when they were a unique station?  my friend rob took 
me for the first time, then he like hounded me to go every weekend and i 
thought he had joined a cult or one of those pyramid schemes or some 
leftwing guerilla movement the way he was going about it, so i didn['t go 
for about another year.  

in between the times i ran off to another state with "someone" (i'll post 
it on my future webpage!)

when i came back, i decided i needed a little uplifting.  so i went to 
something out at um, you know over by candlestick.  in some little court 
in the industrial section over by JIB (jack) and had a great time.  took 
e for the first time in a while.  

then i went bonkers raving and just like raved every weekend.  but i've 
never been the type that can go out the whole weekend and stay all night 
at every party.  i noticed others did that, however that did not seem to 
fit with me.  

then i met "someone else"  (they'll REALLY be on my page.  right up 
front. =] )  

then we parted ways.  

oh, yeah in between bonkers raving and meeting someone i started 
spinning.  i decided on my way home this evening that i specialize in all 
forms and subroutines of deep house.  specially the watery stuff.  

3 years later...

still spinning in my closet i mean bedroom.  i try to go out once a week, 
now i have just released my first professionally glued house tape, 
entitled "The Deep" (on sale at a Solid Grooves near you!  oh, wait 
there's only one.  harry, come on man!  open another)

i went to the first batch of sunset parties, used to go to the mohter 
earth parties, and i even got to spin at Harmony wwwwaaaaaaaaayyyy back 
couple years ago at an outdoor event.  it was the first time ever for me, 
and it was exhilerating but really fun.  i knew then that being a dj was 
going to be one of my life's major purposes.  

i've spun a few parties up at UCSC, with about 150 kids going "faster!  
faster!  can you play run.dmc?"  that was numberous amounts of fun, too.  

so you see, i like #1  helping people (over the years, i've learned only to 
help the people that want to be helped) and i like #2  having fun.  Money is 
secondary to me, but now i have come to a realization that if you want to 
have the time and resources to live some of my life's dreams and satisfy 
#1 and #2, i must have lots of money.  therefore, i've decided to make 
lots of money and build clubs on top of hills that are like futuristic 
and have lots of antennas and telescopes so we can talk to our friends on 
Mars, and have satellite uplinks with other ravers in other cities.  

I hope to meet some more of you in the near future...

love and peace out 97,

deepfog

NAME              : Peter Tews
JOB               :Mounting & laminating specialist, graphic designer
                    music composer,awesome dj,slacker.lover...

FIRST RAVE:        : XYZ , three years back, I was the one with the quarter

pound of buds smoking everyone out, I had a line of
people
                     following me!
PHYLOSOPHY:        : music is the most wonderful thing next to love...
                     Be good towards everyone, eternal life awaits, God can
see
                     your true intensions!  (spelling?)
TURNING POINT:     :At raves, I found the music I've been looking for all my
                    life, I found the artist inside me... I found a
wonderful
                    woman I love.
LOOKING FOR:        : A new scene, perhaps more invisible, where people can
be
                     themselves and through the use of good drugs (NOT
crank or
                     coke or other shit you sniff)can help themselves to
find
                     the artist inside them, Drugs are a tool, weak people
abuse
                     them, strong people learn from them.
QUOTE:               You must believe first then see, rather than see first
than
                     believe!

encouragement to everyone! ITS ALL GOOD! have a good and fun life so you
can treasure it in the new life, don't help the evil force!!! smile and
love! I like all kind of music and always have my ears open , I plan on
making a couple of records, ( when I get more $ for more eqipment) I am
willing to help anyone out, like bringing my 1200's or playing my tunes, or
sharing my crack! (just kiddin'!) I would like to get to know many of the
REAL people out there, and open my hands, not the "I want to be hella cool"
people. It's a good day when we make a cool friend, and I need more of
dhose days, since I haven't been going to raves in a while due to decline
in quality. I have many seeds in my head... help me grow them!!!

PEACE---love each other even though we all have loose bolts in our heads
LOVE----The magic that makes our universe go round
UNITY---One ant is weak, but a million can fuck up your kitchen
RESPECT-We are all diffrent,imagine music with only one sound, together, we all
         make music!


Pete

P.S. If anyone would be willing to help me throw my birthday party,(feb 8),
such as space, sound system, etc, I would be very thankful!!!!

Okay this is the deal with moon tribe. ( I Read this is the last copy of
XLR8R)
They are starting to get really concerned about the scene and about cops
and stuff and legalites so they are gonng hold of on the moontribes for a
while, but they will resume them later. If you wanna know about LA. I
recomend you go to a rave thrown by United Raver Productions (Smurfy
-coming up in April) or Good Vibe Crew (I don't know what they are
throwing, but I went to OZ and it was the best rave ever)
Thats all I know.

Please do not start all this bad vibed lfaming at each other for NRR
posts or getting into the symantecs of MTV,Keoki,AIDS,Underground etc.
Lets not fight over what we all want and are working for the one goal of
PLUR for the world. It defeats our own purpose if we fight about who is
more PLURish and correct about the scene and blah blah blah. Lets discuss
about what we are going to coming up and the new rave toys we got and
what happened with you today and about what you like to do in spare time
and what talkshows you like and what you hade for breakfast or who you
kicked it with after work/school, what games you got for the computer. If
you are a raver and it has to do with you it is never non rave related.
If it asociates with you and you rave there is a connection somewhere.
Nobody know for sure about Keoki and if he has AIDS or not, its okay for
someone or nayone to put up a post questioning a rumor they heard and
asking people's own opinions. If MTV is gonna do something about raves
then lets hope that it shows the good side of raving
Music/People/Fun/PLUR and doesn't focus on the bad things of it. If you
are a lurker type and you say hi then cool for you and all I am glad you
said you were there. We all know some promoters are fucked up, we learn
from experience. We all are so differnt yet have two things in common no
matter what. Raves & PLUR. Just everyone remember that and that we all
have been through hell and back and taken shit for being a raver and
everyone is supporting everyone and we all love each other and are there
to help any raver in need.

I bet you someone will reply to this negativly. I guarntee you it. I bet
one of you right now is just itching on the mouse button with the pointer
dangling over the reply ready to outpour some mean nasty thoughts that
the person probably wouldn't ever say to another raver at a rave.

PLUR,
Paul

 To state one's feelings truely is to sometimes state contradictions. It 
also helps to present differing perspectives and alternatives.

 They sure do. Thanks for stating the rights of ALL posters (myself 
included).

 Interesting perspective but it does seem like a generalization that is 
not always true. And I believe then that my statement (in essence a voice 
of dissension towards those who can't handle NRR humor) should be valued 
under your above generalization.

if keoki is well enough by the end of the six months, he's coming back 
to make his final tour stop in the bay... so hopefully all will go well 
with that one.... i know a lot of people said they got a bad vibe from 
eminence, but i had the most positive time.. i was just looking at the 
pictures and getting chills! =)

Thanks for the positive negativity... although I really don't see the
negative.  PLUR really means something, and it is very important and
special.  Let's just love one-another, tell stories about our personal
experiences, give and receive advice, and etc.  So much of life is
about the negative - I like being a "raver" because of the postive
mental, spiritual, psychic and social aspects... let's share this with
each other and leave the crap for others to sling at each other.

PLUR and hugz,

Hey all you beautiful people! 
Just wanted to say hi to all of those who aren't out and partying 
tonight, and for those who are, I'm hoping you're ravin'safe :) I was 
playing around on the net and went to www.cyberzen.com/jungle and for 
those who haven't checked it out, go to the Real Audio Tracks and 
check out the Brown Sugar remix DJ Noel does on there, it's supaphat! :)

Oh for those of you who don't know me, i guess now is a good time to 
officially intro. myself (kinda late, i know but better late than 
never huh).. I've been on the list since oh i don't know when, and 
i've posted many a review.. I started raving about a year ago, 
massives were my thing up until hmm september.. when I started going 
to ugs and weeklies more and more often.. I've recently started 
looking at life in a whole new perspective that I can't even explain 
to myself.. I've always thought life is a wonderful thing, but I 
don't think I ever fully realized the beauty of it and exactly how 
grandiose some things in life are.. Ever stop to watch the sunset, 
and believe it is so beautiful that you start to cry? Ever hear a 
song that makes you so happy you can't help but grab the person next 
to you and start dancing? :) That'show I seem to feel all the time 
now.. It's kinda weird.. 
	Anyway, I'm a junglist through and through (how do ya feel 
when tha bassline moves ya? gets control of ya mind and moves ya!) 
but I'm also into goatrance, hard trance, hardcore, anything fast. 
ambient is fun to chill to of course :) you'll find me at any jungle 
party, audio impact of course.. and here and there.. i'm always 
willing to help out a fellow SFRaver/person in general because my 
theory in life is to make the world a better place, and if i can put a 
smile on someone's face or make their life easier for them in one way 
or another, then shit i'll do it! :) 
	I want to thank all you SFRavers who have been 
supa-phat-sweet to me out there at parties, and to all you SFRavers 
who've been helpful to me on-line as well.. And to those who I 
haven't met either way, much love and respect to you too! I love the 
SFRave community, what a family! I hope to meet more and more of you :)
So go back to your friday nights/saturday mornings and I'll see you 
at the next party.. 
Take care of yourselves!
Much love and hugs,
LAra

Hi to everyone in the world!  ]=)

		

			This is long. You have been warned.

Dilemma;

 I have been involved in the UG for quite a while know (about 5 years) 
and before that I was very involved in band parties and the carnival and 
other "notable" scenarios.

 As many of you know, I am a sound engineer, light tech., multi-media 
live production artist and all around stress monkey.

 My goal is to provide enviroments and shows for folks that are conducive 
to transcendent experiences. Why I do this will be explained below for 
those that are interested.

 The problem is that I seem close to making the jump from amatuer to 
professional in my choosen area of expertise (multi-media production). 
I'm concerned that I'll lose the artistic edge the UG has given me as 
well as the sense of comradarie (sp?) you can only get from a few close 
friends humping amp racks and cabinets after 12 to 20 hours of 
partying/working to bring about a large event. I'm also very concerned 
I'll turn into a snob at the first chance I get (like when I have my own 
truck and don't have to beg for rides). My big hope is to become 
professional (designing massives and other large events in addition to 
starting a multi-media company) while still donating time to the UG (if 
possible). I'm afraid that my standards of professionalism may keep me 
wanting to work with the UG though.

 Of course I may never be a success and my worries may be groundless. ;)

 So why am I wasting bandwidth on three lists? I am hoping to get 
insights and perspectives from folks on how these issue could be 
addressed. I'm also hoping to show others this perspective in order for 
some to understand the conflict many of us have who are trying to build 
careers (all three of us ;) from things like raving. The UG has given me 
a place to develop my skills. Not only in show production but in learning 
how to communicate and work with others. And perhaps most importantly, in 
seeing with other perspectives, especially in the areas of human 
experience and beliefs. Skills and gifts I'll always carry with me. I 
can only hope that my gifts given to the UG can match 
these gifts bequethed to me.



			Reasons for Doing this.

 I came from a fairly messed up, white trash childhood. By the time I was 
a teenaged youth and living in California, I really didn't care much 
about anything. I had disconnected most of my emotional senses and this 
caused me (I believe) not to care about anything. Including myself.

 I went to a YES concert in 1978 and was transformed. I left that concert 
deeply caring. I was so blown away by the experience that I wanted to do 
the same for others. I wanted to design light and sound shows. I wanted 
to be a multi-media artist (long before the term was coined).

 I have devoted my life to that goal but have been side tracked along the 
way by needing to take care of my messed up head. It's still needing a 
little work (a lot maybe?) but at least I'm still firmly committed to my 
path. This is the whole reason why I'm in school. To put on better parties!

 So this is very important to me. These issues I'm dealing with. My 
apologies again for the bandwidth absorbtion.


may you know peace,


Ran D.Dreams

...oh, and a word on the original bit...to whoever was why-ning in the
first place...

 SDream;s post was actually a very logical and IMO funny continuation to
some-thing he posted recently...either somebody didn't pay attention or
someone is just being a rude asshole to suggest we send the dude hate mail
... It was my understanding that sdream...just proposed to his girlie.  The
dude has a heart. He;s happy. he writes funny self depricating top ten
list... ha ha ... if you don;t like it, fine...if you don;t/can't respect
that...then i suggest that that is your problem, not SFraves... this is a
bunch of people who are cool and intelligent and not a bunch of pedantic
wankers <except on special occasions, such as in debates over certain words
such as PLUR and GanSTah> we are humans, but what separtes/brings us
together is the fact that we share things with each other...

well, nothing kills the vibe of openess/generosity/sharing/gift giving any
quiker than an atmosphere of non=caring and disrepect...especially the
misguided,  and unjustified  posts coming from  people complaining about
"Nrr: humor" posts...

if its truly not *raver* rellated, speak up...

but this was about a n SFRAvers engagement . . . something deserving
respect from us if not attention from you...<ie, hit DEL or get a filter>

*you are now returned to scheduled programming*

that.... oh wait one more thing. it was at ihop and i was upstairs. and
on the railing thing, the bottom half was all glass so you can see thru
to the dance floor, so when I sat down and put my face to the glass, it
looked like "The Grind"...that's all
tommorrow,(which i guess is today) i'm on a search for new jungle...i

Paul, 
I think I understand where you are coming from and I must admit that the part
of my life that I have been a raver has been filled with so much fun and
love and positivity that it is really tempting to just focus on that. But
you know
even ravers die. As a dear friend of mine did a few months ago, he didn't
die of AIDS, he died of cancer, he was amazing in that he kept showing love
right up to the end, he loved us while his body started to rebel and to
contort in
grotesques ways, (when some would not hug him anymore because he looked funny)
he kept going to parties as much as he could (he loved the music and people
so much).  This person showed so much love and respect and VIBE! I miss him
tremendously, is it wrong to want to talk about fighting diseases that take
our loved ones away from the Music? 

Some of us have friends that will never dance again, people that we danced
with, made love to, stood up to the police to, do we just forget about them
because their lives are not fluffy and joyful as ours still are?

hi kids my name is marc jameson, i live in a shack in
downtown SJ, where its 6am and my body still thinks its
1. im a musician, java developer, & brandspankin new to
sfr, (although i was on it for a week once till my work
unsubbed me:)  first rave was in a park outdoors (as most
parks are) in Sacto in 91 near the american river,
they had slip 'n slides! ive always been a
music lover and have been making electronic music
for a few years.  I kind of lean toward the darker,
harder side of things.  For the past year ive been
getting especially into jungle/drum&bass.

i am insearch of some visuals/projections/etc.
i have a band, we combine elements of techno/jungle/
breakbeat, soundtrack, punk.  Multiple drummers at
times, live and electronic, intense in your face music.
i would really like to incorporate visuals into our
set. Im open to different media and vibes. i want to
tie something in with the music to create an overall
mood.  I know there are people on sfr who do this,
so if you're out there and you think you might be
interested, please let me know!!  Next show is Feb 8,
which is kinda short notice i guess, yikes...

i look fwd to talking to you,
hope you all have a great weekend!
-Marc

i came to the conclusion a while ago that it's not within my rights to
make that decesion for other people. it's been said before, but not nearly
often ehough, the e and raves and whatever *are not* some magic cure-all
disco discut remedy and sometimes do more harm than good.

it's really easy to fall into a rut. i think that a lot of my co-workers
use work as a crutch to fill whatever holes they have in themselves, or
holes that they percieve having in themselves. i think that they're
mistaking boredom for exhaustion. "you will be assimilated..."

Read it again.  I made no claim to stating the rights of all posters.  I
did state one right of which I am certain we have.

If that's the case, then why aren't the original poster's comments valued,
as well?

There is a difference between dissension/disagreement/negativity and
outright hypocracy.  Preaching openness and telling someone to start their
own list because you don't like what they have to say amounts to
hypocracy.  Forget the nonsense about "stating one's feelings truly is to
sometimes state contradictions".  That is not what this is about.  This is
about someone using cherished values *against* someone else and
simultaneously violating those values -- which is exactly what you did. 
How much more Religious Right can you get? 

	Sami

Btw, any further comments I make on this topic will made in private email.
I however felt it was important to bring into question the intolerant
positivity which must scare as many people away from this list as does
malicious negativity.

Hey all you beautiful people! 
Just wanted to say hi to all of those who aren't out and partying 
tonight, and for those who are, I'm hoping you're ravin'safe :) I was 
playing around on the net and went to www.cyberzen.com/jungle and for 
those who haven't checked it out, go to the Real Audio Tracks and 
check out the Brown Sugar remix DJ Noel does on there, it's supaphat! :)

Oh for those of you who don't know me, i guess now is a good time to 
officially intro. myself (kinda late, i know but better late than 
never huh).. I've been on the list since oh i don't know when, and 
i've posted many a review.. I started raving about a year ago, 
massives were my thing up until hmm september.. when I started going 
to ugs and weeklies more and more often.. I've recently started 
looking at life in a whole new perspective that I can't even explain 
to myself.. I've always thought life is a wonderful thing, but I 
don't think I ever fully realized the beauty of it and exactly how 
grandiose some things in life are.. Ever stop to watch the sunset, 
and believe it is so beautiful that you start to cry? Ever hear a 
song that makes you so happy you can't help but grab the person next 
to you and start dancing? :) That'show I seem to feel all the time 
now.. It's kinda weird.. 
	Anyway, I'm a junglist through and through (how do ya feel 
when tha bassline moves ya? gets control of ya mind and moves ya!) 
but I'm also into goatrance, hard trance, hardcore, anything fast. 
ambient is fun to chill to of course :) you'll find me at any jungle 
party, audio impact of course.. and here and there.. i'm always 
willing to help out a fellow SFRaver/person in general because my 
theory in life is to make the world a better place, and if i can put a 
smile on someone's face or make their life easier for them in one way 
or another, then shit i'll do it! :) 
	I want to thank all you SFRavers who have been 
supa-phat-sweet to me out there at parties, and to all you SFRavers 
who've been helpful to me on-line as well.. And to those who I 
haven't met either way, much love and respect to you too! I love the 
SFRave community, what a family! I hope to meet more and more of you :)
So go back to your friday nights/saturday mornings and I'll see you 
at the next party.. 
Take care of yourselves!
Much love and hugs,
LAra

Not to slam you Ran, but I hate the use of the term "white Trash' as much
as I do the 'N' word.  Since you used it as a personal reference, then it
is certainly within your perrogative to use it, no problem.

I do not think that ANYONE is trash.  No person in this society is
disposable, useless, or anything less than human.  I hate it when people,
due to economic cirumstances, are labled useless or worse yet, trash.  It
just shows me how really fucked up Amerikkka really is (I am not lost on
the fact that this country regularly pits 'white tr**h' against Africans.
In fact the two groups, from an economic and opportunity standpoint are in
the same place.  But the people in power have both groups folled and pitted
against each other for the SAME resources....this kkkountry needs a
decapitation).  To see an intelligent person as yourself buy into the hype
is even more disheartening.  I may call myself the "niggah you love to
hate", but I am not a 'niggah' and never have been.  Never knew any and
haven't met one yet.  Same for the, er , trash.  I've been fortunate to run
into a multitude of human beings.  Some with lotsa faults, some with few,
but all human nonetheless.

As Roger Mudd said in a CBS editorial moment "I've met alot of people in
trailer parks who we're really nice decent Americans, and I've met alot of
rich people in big houses who were nothing but trash."

Peace out, and as Tupac said "Keep your head up!".

Good luck with your choice.  The only way to know how it'll be is to do it!
<- my .02 worth.

Peace,
John

Insead of doing one review/letter on the Frequency-8 party, were having
everyone at the house here that im at add their own little note to SFR
land. 

Pengo: You know the night has gone well when your chilling at a friends
house all morning. Mulling over the fantastic events of the night.
Frequency-8, Mars & Mystr-E once solidly blowing away the crowd and
generating the kind of responses from the crowd that only good hard
trance can. Mystr-E kept the crowd peaked constantly while Mars unleased
his own melodic hard sounds.

{Well ya see, HERES the part where people like Goeff and Eric (150
BLowpop one) are SUPPOSED to be like cool and write but they have
'writers block'. nya nya well fine then poo on you guys too. :p.}

	I'm hardly a lurker, but I haven't posted an intro since I joined 
the list about a month & a half ago, so ... 

	Hi! I'm Rob. I'm a computer programmer by trade. I'm also an 
electronic musician, a music producer. I'm a newbie sfraver. I'm 38.
My first intentional rave was the last Mantra, and I went right into 
trance focusing on that damn heavy sacred Buddha of Raven's while this 
loud weird music blew all the thoughts right out of my head ... 

	Before that I had been exposed to the music a bit at Burning Man.
And I had walked into a couple Sundowners by accident while walking my
dogs out at Point Isobel. I'm sorry folks, but if you're coming to *my*
hangouts, I'm coming to yours, too ...
 
	I'm into long-term hedonism. I seek pleasure by looking for 
things that will make me feel better & better over long periods of 
time. Some of these are well-regulated diet (ovo-lacto-pesco-vegetarian), 
prayer and medititation, exercise, not smoking anything, avoiding quick 
fixes like drugs and alcohol that bring you up for awhile then leave you 
lower than you started off ... I've been on this path for many years now, 
and I can say from experience that it's better than drugs (for me, anyway).

	Hope to see you soon. I'm different in real life than I sound 
on electric paper ...

	Love, 


		Rob

I am an attorney in California and have been made aware of your threat of
legal action against a DJ out here for using the name Lycos.

I was made aware of this threat by an e-mail from Niels P. Mayer, who, in
my opinion, though dramatic, was extremely perceptive in his analysis of
the situation.  I have worked for various corporations out here in
California and understand the concept of doing what is best for your
client, even though that may be unpopular in the eyes of most people.
However, when you take the letter of the law to the ludicrous level that
you have, you are not only doing a disservice to our profession, you are
doing potential harm to your client.  Stopping true trademark infringement
is serious business.  Suing "mom and pop" operations who were using your
corporation's name before the corporation existed is purely evil.  You are
using your money and power to hurt someone who is doing no harm to you.  It
can only backfire in the end.

You have decided to attack a community that has a lot of power.  These may
seem like "crazy kids" to the unkowing, but this is a tight community,
heavily involved in the entertainment and media industries, with lots of
energy and many connections.  I, for one, would not hesitate to provide pro
bono legal assistance to one SubCommander Lycos should he become embroiled
in a patently unnecessary legal action.

The law should be used to help, Mr. Robins, not to hurt.

Sincerely,

Robert A. Kahn, Attorney at Law

Anthony E:  F-8 really went off!  This is a party with good music that made
me dance all nite, good E, solid vibe, and really friendly crowd.  I was
giving out starburst as usual and met new people both on this list and not.
For those of you who forgot I'm the filipino with the blue and white dockers
vest with white t-shirt under.  For those of you who met me we definately
need to keep in touch and hook up for the next party  (I will be at Meridian
next week.)

PLUR =],

p.s.- i lost my wallet in the main chill room.  if anyone has it please give
it back.  you can keep the money in there but i need my driver's license and
other i.d. stuff.. no questions will be asked.

A few days ago I put out a message inviting people to write a certain
racist individual and express their opinions of some of his comments.  I
got a bit of negative feedback to that, with the general opinion being
that, flaming someone usually does no good whatsoever.

Ok.  But I'm not ready to let this lie.  I want to suggest something,
and you folks tell me what you think.  If the feedback is positive, I'll
go for it, although I doubt it will be.

It strikes me that this list is warm and spiritual, without color lines,
without (many) prejudices, a truly friendly place where extremely
diverse people are brought together with a common interest.  I don't
think there's anyone here who would argue that the world would be a
better place if there was more tolerance, more love, more acceptance,
qualities you find more often than not in the population of this list.

What if we led by example?  What if we invited some of the folks from
these racist groups to check out our list?  Need we be isolationist? 
Are we afraid to open up and bring these people in and, possibly, heal a
few of them?

I choose the word "heal" because I really feel racism is a mental
disease, an inability to see logically that all people are the same, and
that it's a far better thing to love your fellow man than to hate them
if there's no logical reason for that hate.

Now, I know some of you are reading this in abject horror, ready to
respond vehemently that this is a terrible idea, that we love our
SFRaves and we don't want it corrupted by such horrible people.  But
what are we saying then?  The last couple of days have seen several
messages on this list about how everyone is good deep down inside, how
there's no such thing as trash, no person so evil that they can't be
rehabilitated.

If you really believe that, and the responses I get reflect that, I'll
drop a few messages on some of the racist newsgroups, something to the
effect of:
----------------------

Hi,

I'd like to invite you all to check out a special mailing list, one that
was formed through unity in a single interest, raving.  Raving is so
much to so many people, and the people that have flocked to this list
come from all ages and all walks of life.  We have formed an extended
spiritual family.  If you love to party, if you love to dance, if you
love music, if you love good friends and good times, stop by and check
us out.

-----------------------

Ok, so that's a first draft.  Suggestions are welcome.

Now, I'm not so shortsighted that I can't see I'm inviting a certain
amount of trouble.  Some very nasty individuals will likely show up. 
What I'm asking is not a trivial thing.  But I'm willing to bet that
some of the folks that show up would first find a group of people that
they admire for their intellects and their energy, only to later find
that the very people they've made v-friends with are of different skin
color, religious beliefs, sexual preferences, etc.  

Email is a wonderful equalizer.  One is forced to recognize the mind
first.  All the barriers that we put up in our minds when we meet
someone face to face don't exist here.  The shock could force open some
very closed, dank, and dark little minds.

Just a suggestion.

Top 10 reasons for gold ring bullsh*t is contributing to the vibe? That's

Hi Randy,

I felt compelled to share with you my current dilema.

I have been in the commercial software biz for about 8 years now, and 
have reached a peak of sorts.  I've been getting into more 
multi-dimensional forms of expression (the rave scene, my web site, my 
prophecy, etc.) and have recently come to the conclusion that I need to 
make a major career change, from programming word processors, to creating 
digital art.

But how to transition from one form of programming to another?

Well, just last friday, I got a dream opportunity from a small company to 
do all the latest cool digital technology (java, macromedia, cgi stuff, 
web sites, etc) for some of the biggest studios in entertainment today.

I'm afraid of accepting the offer.

Why?  Fear of the unknown.  With my most recent job, I walked in the door 
KNOWING I could do the job, and I have.  That feels good.  Now I'm facing 
a big unknown.

So how does all this help you?  If you were in my position, I'd tell you 
to take the job.  And if I was in your position, I'd take the leap.  Its 
evident to anyone who's chilled in one of your rooms that you really pour 
yourself into what you do :-)  I know you'll stay true to that, even when 
you're doing it full time.

peace and confidence

deeje

Hi All,

Like to spin rekkeds, but only have one turntable?  No problem.  Turn 
your powermac into a second, virtual turntable, with QT Turntable.

A new version is available at <http://www.deeje.com/>  Phat props to 
everyone who has expressed interest in the program and the concept.  Bug 
fixes coming soon...

I do believe this.  I also believe that text email is the worst possible 
human-to-human interface, because SOOooooo much is lost in the 
compression.  (You never see flame wars as your walk down the street.)

If you really want to 'rehab' some of these people, invite them to an UG. 
 Let them see and feel a tribal gathering.

'nuff said.

Alright, alright...this has starting to go too far; no one is going to sue
anyone.  I'll be so brazen as to guarantee that right now. This is silly
pseudo-legal posturing, and if you must sue someone, please do it away
from this list.

well, i guess we disagree on fundamentals, and thus can't argue anymore.
LOVE HAS EVERYTHING TO DO WITH IT.  when sfraves is no longer a loving
community of ravers, i have no problem packing up my bags and finding
another community.  fortunately, for me, that's not the case, and love has
a lot to do with what goes on on this list.

btw, flaming someone for publically announcing their engagement is a mean
thing to do.  a community is more than the topic that it explicitly
discusses:  it is the lives of those who discuss it, and for sdream, his
recent ingagement (go sdream!!!) is a big part of his life.

love has everything to do with it-

Hi

I'm wondering if anyone out there knows where/how I could get a copy of a
record called "Ballistic" by an artist also called Ballistic (not the
BallisticBros) that came out on the UK label Smitten in Oct/NOv 96. This is
an insane acid track that got a great review in Mixmag but I've had trouble
(understatement) finding it..

Thanks  :)

Hello again SF raves...
I thought I would re-introduce myself as I have been away from SF raves (and
SF) since April.
I spent April-Oct in London (also made it to Germany for a couple of
parties). Been back in SF but just got back on-line....glad to be back in
touch with SF raves!

I have one fairly obscure question...is anyone out there obsessive/compulsive
enough to know who exactly were the DJs at Spundaes on Jan29,95 (day 49ers
won superbowl) and what order they played?  I plan on asking the promoters
but I thought someone else might have the info.

Also, wondering what people out there think of AMP (MTV Sunday 1-2AM)? Sorry
if this is a tired topic...I've only been back on-line a couple of weeks.

See ya out there!

juliet   :)

I got a nice response to Ravers with Homepages, and 
continue to recieve new links daily. I'm going to fly
with the idea, so I changed the name to Raver Whitepages 
(even though they're black). I will probably be spending 
the next year adding the links. =o) 
I also moved the site. The new URL is:

	http://www.chosen.org/ravers/

Who knows? Maybe this site will become the Raver Yahoo?
hehe

For those of you that did not recieve or see the first post,
here it is again...
ATTENTION ALL RAVERS WITH HOMEPAGES!!!!!!!!

I have just set up a new site called "Raver Whitepages"
It is located at http://www.chosen.org/ravers/
If you have a homepage that you would like added, Please
either add it via the form located at the site or send me
an e-mail containing the following:

	*Name you would like listed
	*URL
	*Your e-mail address
	*URL of homepage
	*Information about homepage (i.e. is it a business, personal, etc.)

mailto:ravers@chosen.org

You may add a link directly to this page if you like.
I hope to see this site grow quickly and help bond and
unite ravers on the internet. As time progresses, and
the list of links grow, it will be sorted, alphabetized
and searchable. Thank you for your contributions.

have you tried special ordering it from say solid grooves?  they can 
usually work wonders, unless it can't be got anymore. there's also this 
place in england called something like "hard to find records"...this is 
where you go when you want to find stuff like coco steel and lovebombs 
"feelit" i don't know how to find them, but maybe someone on this list 
does...

good luck!

Now *that* is a cool way of putting unity in perspective!  I believe that 
if everyone kept this in mind, no one (political figures, media, police or
otherwise) can destroy the scene, no matter how hard they try. :)

Frequency 8 was incredible!  I liked what they did with the place 
(trash-bags and tarps covering the walls to protect the place and lots of 
black-lights everywhere so that wherever I went, my white T-shirt looked
like a *light-bulb*!).  The atmosphere was so relaxed!  After the mild
sort of tension lurking occasionally at Emminence, this was a *wonderful*
change of pace. (But don't get me wrong, I still had a blast at
Emminence!)  And yes, the chEmicals were damn nice...  a friend of mine
provided me with an expression for his state of mind at the time:
tripping bawlls!  Oh, and I thought Darcy's (sp.?) spinning was *sweet*!!
Every time I walked into the main dancefloor area, I couldn't help but
dance maniacally!  The people were so raad!!  
Want to say cheers again to Anthony  (starburst dude), Orson, Mat
Lanier(sp?) (<---BTW, cool idea to bring the free-writing rave-book!),
"Kiwi-punch" :), Robert, Maya, and every1 else I met there (sorry I'm bad
with names)!!  I love you all!

BTW, I just sorta' realized I don't think I ever formally introduced
myself, so basically, in a nutshell:  yes, I'm a newbie.  I'm just an
electronic musician/Biology student at UC Davis (soon-to-be graduate,
hopefully), who really developed my taste for techno only about a year
ago, and only recently (about 3 months ago) discovered the wonderful scene
we all know and love (thanx to Uncle Noah)!  I usually wear that silly "I
<heart-symbol> Five Hours of Flowers" T-shirt if I can, because it makes
me feel sooo good, and my "raver-pet" blue-jay velour(?) hand-puppet.  I
also now try to bring a whole bunch of Pixie Stix for all you wonderful
people (also because I luv 'em too)! (...and Apple-O's for those of you
who find me early!) There's more, but I can't think of anything else to
write right now, so...
Hope to see all you folks again really soon!
Much, much happiness and love-

Hi Everyone!  Aren't three day weekends the BEST!!  A great excuse to go 
dance on a Sunday night...which is what I plan to do!  Heading out to 
<gasp> a club - Spundae's special parties are usually purty good.  I had 
to move this weekend, and was unable to go to F8, so tonight I am ready 
to GET DOWN.  Look for me with another SFRaver, KRok, and KaySEE's man, 
if you know who he is!  I'll have a star on my cheek, but the rest of the 
wardrobe isn't planned yet...

I hope the groovers come out to in force to mitigate the club factor.  
I'm counting on you, SFR! ;)

 Maybe I'm just a sic pup but what I dream about are massive's that have 
the small party UG feel. (sigh) Maybe someday my prince(ess) (party) will 
come.


 Thanks for the kind words and encouragement. Support of this sort has 
always been deeply appreciated by me. It helps me in my focus and intent 
and keeps bringing back to that moment when i decided to care.

Hugz,

 If this is too off subject for any of these list's, just say so and I'll 
take it off what ever list that finds it objectionable.

 Thanks for the gentleness in your stating of your opinion John. I know 
how strongly you feel about theses issues  :). I think than the "N" word 
is used on a overall racial basis more than white trash. WT (at least by 
me) is used to label a sub-catagory of certain "white" folks.

 Well, I didn't use WT to imply someone was disposable. I used it because of 
certain lifestyle choices these people had made. My uncle's house was 
always "trashed" There was always trash in the yard, Animal(sp?) feces in 
the yard from way too many, improperly cared for pets, a house that made 
me gag when I walked in, etc.. None of my relatives have been to college. 
let alone a university (I'm the first). My Dad had never been to High 
School and displayed an open contempt for "educated idiots" (a few of 
which I've encountered ;). I'm in school because I've worked my way to 
school (after overcoming many problems from childhood) mostly because 
I've made the choice to do so. I really don't think I'm all that much 
smarter than most of my relatives. I just made a choice to improve my lot.

 Thanks for the left handed compliment. ;) I don't buy into it. It is a 
conscious decision on labeling that I've choosen.

"Food of the God's is by Terrence Mackenna and it is certainly the
difinative book on the subject of mushrroms and, possibly, LSD.  It does
not, however, contain any info what-so-ever on Extacy.  There are two
books on this subject and they are the E takers bible: the first one is
called "Extacy: the MDMA story" by Bruce McCulloch (I think that that is
his mane) and is available at a number of shops on the Haight including
Ameba; the second one, which is more difficult to get a hold of and
contains information on all drugs, is called "Love affair with chemical
substances" by A and A Shulkin.  Everything that one could possibly ever
find useful information on E will be contained with-in these pages.
happy reading!
Tristan.

 Thanks for your kind and supportive words!  :) I certainly am going to 
go professional if I have the oppertunity. I'm just trying like mad to 
get input on how to do it without losing my edge. You folks in SFrave 
land (both virtual and beyond) have been very supportive and helpful in 
reaffirming for me what really counts (vibe!). I'll always carry that 
with me and I hope I can show it to others.

 I know there are a few people I've worked with who are probably shaking 
their heads (is this Ran talking, the stress monstor from H3?), but yes I 
have learned a lot. Between balancing PLUR with artistic vision and 
intent. You folks did that for me. Thank you.

hi, 

sorry to blast this post to everyone.  

but, for the last several months people have come up to me saying something
like, "Kc, it is sooooo good to see you!!" and this would be great if i was
kc, but im just not. :-( 

and, soooo at f8 a very nice man came up to me and said something like this,
"hi jeremy, im kc, and for the past several months people have been coming up
to me saying, 'hi jeremy!! it is good to see you again.' so i just wanted to
meet you"

but, i never got to talk to kc after that, and would like to just let you/him
know that it was grand to finally meet you/him. 

sooo, sorry to waste everyonee elses time.

hugs and such,

jeremy

**GOOD**			**BAD**
1)PHAT breakbeat all night!     1)crappy location;Marina Skate
2)sold TONS of glow-apparel!    2)waited in line for 2+ hours
3)free h20 & real toilets	3)PSYCO security w/ pepper spray
4)great vibe once inside ;)	4)1000 ravers OVER capacity= HOT
5)met/brought Newbie ravers	5)see below...

			((IMPORTANT SYNOPSIS))
Upon arriving some ASSH*LE security comes directly to us with 3 other 
'buddies' pointing their lights in our faces..."chewing already?" he 
said...  "whatcha got?"   Im totally SOBER and dont do/deal/promote drugs 
and have a completly EMPTY backpack on me (for our jackets)  and this 
jerk off comes to ME! sheesh.... so he felt stoopid after that and walked 
off in a huff...  SO

later while in line we hear yelling and stuff, and see the same security 
screaming at some guy in a red truck who'd just pulled up.  soon he had 
gotten thru the window and was punching the dood in the face, then with 
the help of another 4 securtiy, pulled the guy of of the truck as he was 
trying to drive away  and started kicking him and then beating his head 
on the side of the vehicle... once in a bloody heap they dragged him off 
somewhere and some guy took off with his truck!  WHAT THE HELL HAPPEND? 
ANYBODY KNOW?  DAMB...

even later about 10 feet from the entrance some dork in line is mouthing off 
to still the same original security guy... he hears it and looks up 
directly at me pointing his light ONCE again!  this jerkoff now is 
yelling at me "thats it, YOU LEAVE!"  i tell him in all honesty "i didnt 
say that, i swear"  and responds "GO THE F*CK HOME, LEAVE, if you DONT, 
NOBODY IS COMING IN UNTIL I *MAKE* YOU LEAVE!!"   
	so what am i supposed to do???  this nuttcase is gonna kick my 
ass if i dont leave right now... so i go take off my jacket and hat and 
slick down my hair and prayed id get searched by the other guard (there 
were 2)  and i got lucky... i got in.. once inside  YEAHHH!!!!! 
	GREAT PARTY!!!!   wierd crowd, but EVERYONE was dancing!! so it 
didnt matter at all...  i did have a blast...

	*NOTE*
if anybody knows GHOSTRIBE or their connections to their security...  
I WANT TO KNOW WHO THE 6'5" WHITE JACK*SS WITH THE GOATEE & SHORT BROWN 
HAIR IS...    that guy was SO out of line the whole night.

	Ghostribe should really be pretty ashamed for what that guy did, 
and how it reflects upon them and their parties.

im out now! ;)
pees, LiQuiD

Hi!  ]=)

 Sorry to hear about the asshole security guy. It is amazing what jerks 
those people can be. A tip; next time find the promoters in the party 
(I'm sure you can do it-it's not hard if you talk to the right people) 
and tell them what is going on. That way they can go watch the creeps in 
action (hopefully). Believe me, these asswipes have lying down to an art 
and can twist your story all around. These problems need to be witnessed 
by the working crew (Ghost Tribe in this case) and/or have LOTS of 
witnesses. 

 Sorry I missed the Madame's B-day party! HAPPY BIRTHDAY SHERRY!!  =)) 
I was very sick with a flu/viral thing (still am a tiny bit) and have 
been laying low all weekend.


peas,

Ran D.Dreams

this article would be good as a pro of keeping these small underground

Look, I'm not trying to get down on you or anything for your opinion, but 
yours is the first complaint about the number of NRR messages that I've ever 
seen on the list.  The rest of us seem to either enjoy the NRR messages, or 
don't mind filtering them out.  This isn't a big issue, it's quite simple to 
delete NRR messages.  I often do when I have very little time free.   
 
We are a community of ravers here.  I believe that the community is what makes 
this list interesting, not the raving.  The raving *creates* the community, 
which we all can enjoy and be a part of, and also choose to have nothing to do 
with if we so desire.  Anyhow, that's my 2 cents worth.

Top 10 reasons for gold ring bullsh*t is contributing to the vibe? That's

DJ Tracy and I want to organize a FMR for the upcoming Full Moon.
We feel that the FMRs are important and that someone needs to once again play
funky house beats under the moon and stars.   Markie of the Wicked crew is
down for playing as well as Tracy and myself, Garth hasn't verified yet
whether he is down or not. However this can only happen if we have HELP.
We need folks to lend us energy, maybe a (small) working sound system and most
of all, be around in the morning to help carry it out (or off) the beach.
The FMR at their peak were a focalizing point, they brough people out into
nature, instead of stinky smelly clubs, they let brought younger ravers and
older ravers together and they were the best place to introduce newbies to
what it was all about.  We need help if we are to get these started again
and to keep them positive and not just be a vector for nitrous proffiteers,
and drug dealers.
Any volunteers can e-mail me here or leave a message at 541-5632

What's up SFR?

Well, considering all of the things that could have made this party bad,
I'd have to say that I had a good time until Santa Clara Po Poes showed up.
When I first arrived, the place was empty. The space was pretty nice, but
it turned out to be too small. By around midnight, there was barely room to
walk. The music was good all night long. The sound system was pretty rad
too. This party had potential, but it got busted at around 1:15 am. I was
really impressed with the turn out. I've never been to a rave in the San
Jose area, so I thought it would be pretty dead, but I was wrong. Anyways,
thanks to the promoters of Focus for thinking of us down here in the South
Bay, and I hope you can pull off another party soon.

Rave On!
Ivan

Yea, Your right.. It was afat azz party!  Great vibe inside.

 I heard a mix from Carlos that night, I swear.. He must have an invisible
hand or something. It was the fattest ass mix I have ever heard.. I don't
even know where to biggin duplicating such a sound w/ only two turn tables.
 About the guy in the red truck.  I don't know any facts but. I heard a few
things..
 I heard (for one) that it was Dj Dreamer. And I also heard (for two) that
he owed hella people money. People were saying that it was a gay bashing
(bull shit) ...  But who knows.  Maybe it was Dj Dreamer. Maybe he ripped
someone off..  Who knows..    But I did also hear another ravE related
story the night before that might be connected. I will mention no names and
no locations. But... (I heard) A group of people heald up a fellow ravEr
with a 45 and stoled ALOT of E off him.
  I don't know but...  The way thoughs securities beat that boy down.. It
wouldn't surprize ME if this had something to do with it.
  But I wouldn't trip.. Becouse I am sure that it had to be something
pretty serious! Not just some random gay bashing, bulling pushing, attitude
adjustment.  I really couldn't amagine a security guard beating down
someone, becouse he just didn't like him..   Damn rumors..  I swear..   AND
REMEMBER!  This is just shit I heard.. I wasn't there or nothing.. This is
just grape vine shit..  So don't quote me.

  But damn.. That was the best Marina Skate ravE to date!   I did do
alittle dancing of my own...   There were alot of things I regretted NOT
doing but.. Oh well..  I have to stop dwelling on my acts of pure
stupidity!  =]:..

11:45  Saturday:

So here we are, we being six dudes ranging in age and raver expieriance,
in two cars headingtowards SJ.  My car is blasting jungle, thanks to
DJ's Hannabal Selecta and Simulacra, while my friends' Fourrunner is
playing an imported Chemical Bros. CD.  We swerve, we turn, we get lost
because Bascom turns into Washington before Layfette St. 
"Ehh, hey guys lets go to that 7-11 and check these directions"
Phoning the 411, Im verifing the details while everyone else go into
this redicilous routine on how many ways one can say 420.  Which is fun,
I admit, but they're screaming names to each other between cars:

	Raver A(My car): "Yo, you got any BOMB!!" 
	Raver B (thiers): "What? Are you speaking about the dank!!??"
	Raver C(Mine): Im looking for some Purple Haze, you got's the purple
	haze??"
	Raver D (Thiers): "Hey, do you guys smell some skunk around??"
Ten minutes and a lot of original and well known names later, we are
heading in the rigth direction, the anticipation is lingering in the
air...
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-==-=-
So I get to the F-8 mappoint @ 4PM and spend most of the time chatting
with poeples and talking to goa-trance DJ IVO.  We're discussing the
state of goa trance (in which I will correctly refer to as psyedellic
trance from now on) and where it seems to be progressing.  He shares
with me his experiences of being brought into the scene and how he
chooses to contribute in expressing his message through music via DJing
and possibly making, in the future...
Max Factor joins us and a few of my friends (former SFR, DJ Sahid 'n' a
few more) chill till about 8PM, kick everyone out and I grab a bit to
eat.  
Mappoints are funny, from street philosiphers, the guys that's sooo
stecked that he cant figure out which is the 10$ bill, to that dude who
really REALLY needs a ride there. 
Im trying to get amped off of everyone else's vibe and finally, @ 12:45,
we sellout.  Flying down 101 @ oh, 90 or so MPH (hey, mycar wasn't built
for 65...). I arrive, give my ticket to the doorguys (like I said, I'm
just another raver) I walk in....
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
to a pretty nice warehouse in the industrial section of SJ. Visuals are
displaied across the walls and some breakbeatish-house is going through
the speakers.  I ask the time and it's about 12ish. I wander and feel
the crowd.  A large hispanic and asian mix but no additiudes whatsoever.
 I get to the front and see Mr. DJ (im sooo unfamillar w/south bay
techno DJ's) working three turntables.  Nice set, no choo-choo's, I get
to gruuving... Sliding into that housey vibe I begin my journey into the
funked triipy would of down breaks, backward bass thumps and watery
wicka-wicka sounds of breakbeat...
I lose my friends to the crowd, and im pretty much a stranger in this
scene, but the coolest thing is that through dancing, I start "making
friends"... A grin here, a wink there, someone shows me thier 'move' I
show mine.  No competitiveness, at least im not trying to show any, Im
just likning my body/mind/spirit to the song at hand...
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
And what a fu*#!ng HARD song that is!!!  I head straight to the dance
floor.  Surrounded by my"family", I see soo many faces I can't list them
all...  Grins galore Im getting way into the trance that Mystr-E is now
spinning.  I must admit the jams he thru went way back to the red rock
days of 95'.  I guess you could call this set, "the history of Mystr-E"
or, "Mystr-E's Anthologies".  Dancing non-stop at a very furious beat,
I'm brought to a state where every cell of my being is resonating with
this powerful vibe.  I've gone, "c-u soon Adam" now it's just rush.  A
high without any substance.  A sense of knowing, an apex it only lasts
the duriation of a song and then mixed down to this state where my body
is somewhat complaining because its 2:30AM and Mr. body has been running
sice 6 friday morning.
I walk off to get some water in a seculded hidey hole only I seem to
know (he, he).  And when I come back I hear MARS starting off his set.
I fast-step it back to the turntables and start gruuving to a lil build
up into a dark (allthough, I've heard darker) set.  I must admit I was
floored by one jam, shookup so much I had to stop dancing alltogheter
and gather what sense was knocke outta me from that particular track...
I stop to rest by a speaker and my stomach is going through motion
sickness.  Improvement is needed. I smile.
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
at this one girl and offer her a puff of my pipe, she accepts and we
chat a bit.  She gives me this lil' panda clapper (that now dangles on
my car visor), then suddenly without any warning, the music fades down
the doors close, and a "no ins and outs" sign is tossed on the door.  I
sense the impending doom of "the bust" I ask for the time.  1 O'clock.
By one-ten we're out in the street trying to fig. what to do next...

1:30  Milpitas:
Several of us are high, some tripping. Me sober (and cold, my shirts are
very, very sweaty) sowe drop off two of our friends and drive endlessly
through backroads and county streets.  One of my friends is trying very
hard to verbalize his shroom' trip and we are all laughing at the
result.  I might be a bit high, but, with my friends, I feel a happines
that only friendship can bring.  We park off the road and wander about
some regional park @ 4:30 in the morning. We all head out in different
directions, me doing a bit of soul searching. Im happy, eventhough the
party was busted. Im content dispite the coldness around me.  Im in
love, with life in general.  Nothing coud of made this night more
perfect.  Only if you choose to can you be brought down by situations.
But we do have a friend who is wandering in the woods so I search...
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
For my shirt that I took off arounf 2:30. It's now 6 and my body is
crying, "bed,bed, pillow,pillow"  I still have enough energy to give a
few gal-pal's of mine a ride back to the city and say my thnks to the
DJ's. The clean up crew is moving trash, JK is moving the speakers and
im moving out the door...
Many many things happend that night.  I resoved some personal issues,
said some private goodbyes to persons in my life, said hello to some new
ones as well...   All in all, very fine.  I see my path musically.  I
know my niche.  Hello to all those I saw and howdy to the promoters I
spoke with as well (yeah,yeah, I might go to GT just too see all the
rooms open @ this event).  
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
So we return to society, the sun is up.  Im at my car.  I look to the
sky.  But I see myself.  A raver isn't just one who goes to parties,
I've learned, but one who tryies to keep improving themselves while
trying to spread positivity not just you yours, but the lives of others
as well...

But hey, that's just my interpetation.

-reading back, it seems a bit long, sorry.  If so I'll trimm it down
next week...

"Stay Connected"

The police and local governments in the south bay systematically
criminalized any dancing past 2:00am back in the earliy 1990's to combat
the first wave of the rave scene. This is any dancing at any age, no matter
where.

That's probably the biggest reason you never see raves happen in the San
Jose area. That's also why there are no clubs open after 2:00am.

San Jose claims it's a big city and "The Capitol of Silicon Valley" but
it's a bunch of crap since they steadfastly refuse their taxpaying
residents the right to live a "big city life" in their town.

"The streetlights are on, so go home and pay your taxes!"

     If you ask me GT's security wasn't out of line on saturday, in fact,
what went down was pretty on par with every other Ghostribe party I've
seen! Due to the location change with space childeren, I ended up at acid
breaks. this weekend I also took three first time ravers, and I have to say
it was a F**KING EMBARASSMENT to this entire scene. Good DJ's or not, GT
has to get there shit together, and people should stop going their parties
until they can learn to have a little respect for the people who pay their
bills....US!

Bad news, folks. 

Some dorks took a couple of keyboards belonging to the owner of the space we
used for the Sunday afterparty. The owner's cool, but he's a pretty
depressed, and doesn't want to do anything for a while, unless he get his
gear back.

Which leads us to Wed. and Audio Impact.

Since we use the same space, we're in a bit of a bind. Ideally, we'd like to
use the same location. So we're asking for a little help.

The suspect is female, dark hair, brown eyes, blue jacket. We're pretty sure
she told her freinds where the gear was, as two keyboards area lot for one
person to carry.

 Funny thing is that there were a lot of other expensive stuff where the
keyboards were. So it seems the suspects got stupid and took what they
thought was cool, and left the REALLY good stuff behind.  Whatever.

If anyone hears of sees anything that might lead us back to the goods, we'd
be forever grateful. A choice space is in jepoardy because a couple of kids
decided they want to try and become musicians. 

This week for Audio Imapct, we got DJ Snuggles from Chicago coming to town,
that is, if we can land a location. We're still sniffing around.

Any info on the keyboards can be sent to my email, or call me at Hunab Ku:
415-431-0950

Obviously, the Sunday gig is on hold for a while. Anyone know of any
warehouses for cheap?

Audios!

Jonas

Hey Everyone,

Im somewhat new to this list.  Im actually wondering if anyone on this list
knows if moonpup is back from England, and if so can you drop me a line as to
how to get a hold of him. 
I actually met him at a party last March in Tahoe, it was the weekend cabin
thing.  Maybe somebody who went will know.  I havent really been out to any
functions lately....  So any info would be totally apprieated.  


Thanks......

hi, just a brief musing:

While running through my day i nearly slipped through without pondering its
significance. today is not only a special time to honor a man who selflessly
gave his life so those who came after him would be able to live slightly
closer to the ideal of freedom. 

we so often quickly tap out PLUR on our keyboards, today is certainly a day
when i will think carefully about what Peace Love Unity and Respect mean to
me, and how i spread this sense of equality to all i contact. 

with big smiles for all!!!

love, jeremy

Dear All;

	Hi I have a confession to make; there really is no Kevin Keiper,
Brian DarknEs^2 or Tristian, they are all part of me George and my MPD
(multiple personallity disorder) the four faces of George. + >, no just
kidding folks it's that silly Brian DarknEs^2 personallity pulling your
virtual chains via the real Kevin Keipers account via
trash.net(value.net sorry pat but this is like my fourth retype; even
after I intentionally post-pon).

	Anyway, I just wanted to say that I had the wonderful pleasure of
meeting & sharing champage with DJ Keoki. He is a very powerfully soft
man, who also charmed the pants off this confused questioning hetro(I hate
labels)sexual. But lass, I didn't wanted to have my first bi-sexual
experience with someone who would have been leaving in 2 - 3 days, though
I do requet it a little. However I was and am still very flattered. He
wasn't at all like i would have imaged him, quiet, but confident
without it filling the converstaion.

	I'm sad to hear that he is going to stop touring, but glad for him
that he is. The club sacene lifestyle is hard enough doing it locally i
wouldn't want to image multiple cites, airports, ...etc with non-stop
offers of sex & drugs, sex & drugs, and more sex & drugs from beautiful
men & womyn, though it does have it's appeal doesn't it folks!!!!

	It's like the end of an era, but the House, and the Trance will
continue for the best will be replaced by the better & the newer; such is
life. 

	As for dis sfraver another message so soon, is a sign no doubt
that my priorites in life are getting corrected and coming back on-line as
I have time to do the more important things in life. Still doing battle
with the evil giant city tow, but victory WILL BE MINE!!!! 

	Hope to see ya's soon, hey if anyone wants to donate a free time
limited free account it will get me back sooner, if not see ya's in about
30 days or so. Please let Kevin know who's got good connect speeds,
service, phone lines and unlimited access; yeah I want everythang.

Peace & Love
Brian DarknEs^2

*SIGH*

People, if you are going to make attacks about where I work(or have worked
in this case)

1) Please do so privately, because:

   a) Unless you are correct in your statements I will flame the hell out
      of you. 

   b) I will do so publicly, as your original attack was.

   c) I will not shut up until I am done.

That said:

Brian, have you ever stopped to consider, that Value Net has *0* control
over the phone lines which you are connecting to us with? Have you
ever thought "Hey, maybe the problem is with this shitty $15 garage sale
modem?" Or "Gee, the wiring in my house is only 50 years old, I wonder if 
that might be a problem?" 

Here is what is on the other end of your call:

Your call is routed via a bay area FDDI ring to an office in Oakland via
channelized  T-1 directly into a Portmaster-3. No additional analog
conversion. No call-forwarding kludges. No bandwidth destroying Bell
SLC's. It is a digital path all the way.    

Are you so sure that your own house is in order that you can talk shit?

Point of order: Does talking shit give you bad breath?

Ok, I'm in a goofy mood...  It's 8pm, I'm at work, and I'll be here for
another 2 hours minimum...  Just thought I'd drop a line...

Rave Related: Much love to everyone.  I miss you guys terribly, and I
wish I could go to the FMR!!!!!!  If anyone ever suspected that dancing
was a drug, let me tell you, it is 'cause I'm going through withdrawals.

BTW: Is Leslie Ayres still on this list?

hello and thank you for reading this. i am wondering, what rights does a
person have when having a party at your house, and the police come. what
do you say? what can they do/not do, legally?
what can you tell them, legally, so that they cannot just walk in?
any advice/past experiences would be most appreciated...
are there any other resources that i could consult?
thanx in advance...

Subject: Introducing Myself....
Sender: sfraves-owner@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

Hello, my fellow ravers!!!!  Let me introduce myself....  My name is Julie
Mae and I have been a part of the SF scene since 1992.   I didn't have a
computer all that time, so I didn't know a thing about this...  Anyways, now
that I have caught up (at least a little) with the "information age," I want
to put my 2 cents in on raves and their related topics every once in a while.
 I have not had a chance to read every bit of sfraves mail that was here when
I signed on a little earlier (so many, too little time), but I did notice a
few things that I will try to avoid in order to make things easier for you
guys.   So, if you guys will excuse me for a moment, I must get something off
my chest.                                                              

First off, I will try not to copy and include the other mails that I respond
to in the body of my letters.   I have faith that you guys will most likely
have already read the other letters and will know what I'm talking about and
don't need a cut-and-paste reminder.  If not, you can always scroll through
your mails and look up the subject (that I will tell you).   Secondly, I will
respond to all of the letters I feel like responding to all in one letter.  I
only have room in my mailbox for so many e-mails, and then things start
getting bumped off (I believe).  Because some of you may have the same
problem, I am trying to help ease the load off in at least some small way.  I
don't know about you guys, but having 10 different e-mails written by the
same exact person can get a bit annoying.  (For those of you that do this,
please don't get offended.  I'm just getting out my personal opinion, and
would hope that what I have to say makes sense and will be taken into
consideration in the future.)  People, it can all be written in one
place.....
     Okay, I feel better now.   On to other things...  I only briefly
introduced myself earlier, so I will elaborate a little more now.   As I said
earlier, I've been in the scene since 1992.  My first party was the very
first Funky Tekno Tribe, held at the S.F. Galleria.  That was also my first
experience doing E, or any other drug, for that matter.  What a way to be
introduced!!!  I spent the night trying on people's hats (that I thought were
so cool), singing to random people, going into the men's bathroom to find my
female friends that were in there, and taking E that was being fed to me by a
cute guy that I met in line.   I liked the experience so much that I went to
several parties in the weeks following, including the New Year's Eve
Gathering at the Vallejo fairgrounds.  I took 10 of my friends that had never
been to a party before, got them all E'd out, and had an absolute blast
(despite the rain)!  For those of you who were partying back in those days,
you may remember seeing me around.  I had see-through shoes with
glow-in-the-dark soles and I used to pass out glow-in-the-dark star and moon
stickers for people to wear.  At all the parties I went to, I learned new
tricks and found out about new trip toys.  Before long, I had a backpack full
of these goodies, which earned me the nickname of Felix, because I always
have my bag of tricks!!!   I was part of the original Recycle family that met
every Wed. at The Stone and then partied the next morning at Charter Oaks.
  We lost a dear friend (I won't mention his name) of ours back then... may
he rest in peace.  We miss you!  

Yep!  Those were back in the days when there were killer parties at The Stone
(anyone remember the Vibe or Pull my Finger?), Cesar's Latin Palace (A Rave
called Sharon-Esta a Loco), The Tracadero (Tiptoe thru the Tulips,
Tilt-a-Whirl), 16th and Harrison (Green X & Ham, Vision Quest, Get Down! Get
Down! Get Down! before they fucked up... notice I didn't mention Sin and
Wally World?), and the Richmond Convention Center (Come Unity, The
Gathering).  And then there were the various random parties at other
locations that were happening too (Deep Faith benefit for Malachy, Elmo's
Magical Playhouse, Foundation, etc.)  And last but not least, the Full Moon,
Rave in the Park, and Happy Happy Joy Joy parties were always a great
experience back then.  






















































                                                                             
I miss those days... Unfortunately as 1993 progressed, the E that was going
around got bad and everyone started doing speed heavily (including myself)
and the scene started to change.  There were other reasons (besides the
speed) for the change.  One is that there was an increase in the heavily
commercialized raves that attracted a lot of people with bad attitudes.  You
know exactly what I'm talking about.... so I won't say anything further on
that.  Since the end of 1993, when I became pregnant, I have not been in the
scene nearly as much and I don't do near the variety of drugs that I was
doing then.  My week is no longer parties from Wednesday 'til Monday with no
break.  I only go maybe once a month now.  

My life has changed a lot since those days when I was sort-of a mother hen to
all my young friends from Marin County (I never understood why there were so
many 14-year-olds running around doing large amounts of Crystal Meth 5 days a
week).  I have continued to go to raves because of the music, my friends, and
to dance, among other things, but there is something missing...

I can never get back what it used to be.   I keep going, hoping that I'll
find a warehouse full of revelers that has that same euphoric aura that
embodied so many of the parties a few years back when it seemed that more
people were race-blind, style-blind, etc.   We all felt that we were part of
something truly special and there was nothing going to stand in the way of
that search for a united happiness.   Back then, the optimistic attitude of PL
UR seemed a real possibility for the world and our generation, or at least
our own "little world" within it.  Don't get me wrong... I still believe in
it, as many of you do.   It's just that we have taken a few steps back in our
quest the last couple of years.  Someone mentioned in their letter (Paul, I
think) that the scene is deteriorating.  It's been deteriorating for some
time now.  This is not a new concern for us.  We need to take hold of our
scene NOW and make it what we want.  Get the people who throw the parties to
truly take it underground again.  If not, throw your own.  That's what many
of my friends have done.  You don't need a huge warehouse, etc., to have fun.
 Some of the best parties I've been to have been in cozy little nooks or
hole-in-the-wall spaces and were free or cost next to nothing.  And best of
all, they weren't advertised at malls, high schools (please don't take this
the wrong way), etc.  For the most part, they were advertised by
word-of-mouth.  There were awesome vibes and fun was had by all.   

I'm not trying to stand on any soapbox, guys, so please don't get mad at me.
 I'm just telling you a little about how I have viewed our scene.  I love the
Bay Area.  I think we have the best scene in the world.  But most of all, I
love all of you.  
                    
Peace and Love,
JULIE MAE

P.S.  Does anyone know how to get ahold of some TMA?  Hardly anyone knows
what it is.  A friend of mine gave me a hit of it a long time ago and I've
only seen it sold at a party once.  I want to do it again.  It was truly the
best trip I've EVER had, let me tell you....

P.S.S.  Through the years, I've kept a rave journal full of cool quotes,
poems, and sayings that I've either made up, seen in books, or come across on
rave flyers or notes people have passed out at parties.  Every time I write a
letter to you guys, I'll include one of them as my Quote-For-The-Day.  I'm
not taking credit for all of them, just spreading the word...  To start out,
I actually have two that are appropriate.  The first is a good philosophy for
what the scene needs more of.  The second is a large reason for my choosing
the screen name SmileGrl1.  I hold it dear to my heart.

We pass through this world, this life only once.  If along the way, I may
touch a person, perform a kind deed, or be a friend to anyone in need, let me
do so.  We are all here for each other and we only get one chance.  Let's
make it a good trip for all.   Peace.

A smile costs nothing, but gives much.  It enriches those who receive,
without making poorer those who give.  It takes but a moment, but the memory
of it sometimes lasts forever.  None is so rich or mighty that he can get
along without it, and none is so poor but that he can be made rich by it.  A
smile creates happiness in the home, fosters good will in business, and is
the countersign of friendship.  It brings rest to the weary, cheer to the
discouraged, sunshine to the sad, and it is nature's best antidote for
trouble.  Yet it cannot be bought, begged, borrowed, or stolen, for it is of
no value to anyone until it is given away.  Some people are too tired to give
you a smile.  Give them one of yours, as none needs a smile so much as he who
has no more to give.  ;-)


Sorry, guys, about the book I seem to have just written.  Once I got started
with my thoughts, I had a hard time stopping!

Hello all...

I guess it's time to come out of the shadows and introduce myself.  My name is Omar (no, NOT 
Omar Sharif, or Omar kadafi; actually I'm central american, chapin to be exact--any other 
chapines on this list?) and my first rave was also one of Funky Tekno Tribe's Halloween Tribal 
massives.  I believe it was their second one in 1993 and also took place at the Galleria (so we 
might have bumped into each other Julie).  I grew up in Santa Barbara and went several times to 
NYC when Doc Martin dj'd there for a while.

I spent the last five years going to school in SLO town (Cal Poly), and it's club (or rave) 
scene lives up to the towns initials.  Although, the parties being thrown there have gotten alot 
better in the last couple of years.  Luckily, I was able to get a job near a place I always 
wanted to live (San FranDisco!:)  Although I don't live right in the city, I'm about 45 minutes 
south (sunnyvale to be exact), which is alot better than 4 1/2 hours.  Anyhow, now that I live 
closer to where the action is, I'm going to parties or clubs about once a week (Nikita on 
fridays, and any good parties on sat.)  So far I love being here!  Anyways, enough of my 
blabbing and I hope to actually meet some of you at a party sometime.

PLUR......................Live, Love, Laugh................

Omar

Subject:	World Meditation Day

Dear Friends,

While there have been many announcements floating around
the internet about World Meditation Day, this one stands out
to me for its clarity in explaining why and how each of us
might want to participate in our own way.-Kurt Wright
-----------------------------------------

World Meditation Day
Thursday, January 23rd, 1997
Between 12:00 and 1:30 Local Time
Dr. John Miles Evans
JohnMEvans@aol.com
11 January 1997

On 23 January 1997 a group of eight planets will form a variant of an 
unusual pattern-a six-pointed star.  Sometimes known as a Grand 
Sextile or Star of David, this pattern is an integration of various 
diverse energies into a harmonious whole.
This variant is the more unusual in that it is actually a five-pointed 
star, but aligned so that the Ascendent-the point on the horizon -- 
 makes the sixth "point".  As a result, meditation or other 
intentional activity at this time may serve to trigger the latent 
energies in the overall planetary pattern -- completing the circuit, 
as it were, through the efforts we make at this time.
The exact time when this occurs varies with locality.  For most 
locations in the northern hemisphere the time is between 12 noon and 
1:00 pm, but there are some locations where the time may be as late as 
1:30 pm; Miami, Florida is one such location.(1)
For those who are not students of astrology, a brief introduction may 
be appropriate.
One can understand any pattern of the planets as a symbolic 
representation describing the nature and qualities of a particular 
moment of time-operating through the principle CG Jung termed 
"synchronicity."(2)
While written language is linear-one word following another-the 
"language" of astrology is a complex pattern, which cannot be 
adequately translated into a linear form.  But some sense of the 
meaning of this pattern may be gleaned through studying the individual 
planets involved, and their location by "sign" and "house" (two 
indicators of qualities expressed by planets in the pattern).
In the planetary pattern for World Meditation Day, the Sun, Jupiter, 
and Uranus are all "conjunct" (together) at the beginning of Aquarius, 
in the Ninth House, along with Neptune in late Capricorn in the Ninth 
House.  These planets are harmoniously related to Saturn in Aries in 
the 11th, Pluto in Sagittarius in the 7th, and Mars in Libra conjunct 
the North Node in the 5th House.  The fifth "point" is the Moon in Leo 
in the 3rd House.
Aquarius is the sign most connected with humanity as a whole, and is 
particularly activated by group efforts.  That three 
planets-representing Being and Identity (Sun), Expansion and Wisdom 
(Jupiter), and Sudden Awakening (Uranus) -- are all concentrated in 
Aquarius is quite significant.
Mars, the planet of activity, conjuncting the North Node of the Moon, 
an indicator of spiritual integration and development, in the 5th 
house, that of creativity and personal expression, indicates that 
those who take action to participate in the pattern may further their 
own spiritual awareness.
Pluto, the planet of purification and regeneration, is located in 
Sagittarius in the 7th House, symbolizing a transformation of our 
belief systems through forming committed relationship with those 
aspects of ourselves which we may have ignored or taken for granted 
previously.  In this case "ourselves" may represent our common 
humanity, and the need to understand all human beings as being equally 
valuable and important.
The Moon, located in Leo in the 3rd house is opposing the planets in 
Aquarius.  This gives added dynamic tension to the overall pattern. 
 The Moon is symbolic of our deepest feelings, Leo has a great deal to 
do with our sense of identity, and the Third House is the area of 
mental concepts.  This implies that there may be a tendency to oppose 
the movement toward a broader understanding and a new orientation 
toward ourselves because of our emotional attachment to old ideas 
about life, and old beliefs about our sense of who we are.
Neptune, located in the Ninth House in Capricorn, indicates the 
possibility of dissolving old belief systems to make way for the new. 
 This idea is presented in different ways in several areas of the 
overall "chart" for the day.
The sixth "point" is the Ascendent in early Gemini.  Gemini is 
strongly associated with the conscious mind.  By actively engaging in 
meditation or other focused mental activity at this particular time, 
one has the opportunity both to expand one's own awareness, and also 
to further the expansion of humanity as a whole-breaking down the 
barriers separating each of us as individuals, and becoming 
participants in a type of "world mind", in which we recognize our 
common humanity as the most important component.
This is emphasized by the presence of Saturn, the planet symbolizing 
traditional structure and limits, in Aries, the sign of new beginnings 
(where Saturn's power is weakest) and in the 11th or (Aquarian) House 
where that structure which can be developed is focused on the birth of 
a "group mind".
Finally, Mercury, the planet most associated with Gemini, is in 
Capricorn in the 8th House, indicated the possibility of purification 
and transformation of our conceptual picture of life through focused 
effort, with the need to let go of old emotional ties to past concepts 
about how life is.
Astrologers will see much more in this pattern than presented here. 
 But for those who are not astrologers, I hope this overview will give 
you some sense of the significance of this opportunity for both 
individual and group development, and the importance of taking time on 
23 January between 12 noon and 1:00 pm to participate quietly in this 
important event-in whatever way seems best to you.
One last point-"intent" is all important with this pattern.  For those 
who wish to make maximum use of this unusual opportunity, a period of 
preparation in which you look at your own deepest beliefs and desires 
for change may be useful.  And practice meditations, in which you work 
on focusing your intent for what you wish to achieve on 23 January, 
may also be helpful.
My blessings to you in however you choose to participate.

Hi all!  ]=)


 I have a lovely friend in need who is ofline for a bit. Her name is 
Rebecca (she says hi Libby!) and she is a SFSU student. She is WAY cool. 
Very strong, self-determined woman with a heart of gold. She is _very_ 
responsible with bills, has her own vehicle, _loves_ to rave and is damn 
cute too!

 She is looking for a home in SF, hopefully nearby to SFSU but is 
flexible. She is looking as she just flew in from Colorado and was living 
the dorm life last semester.

 You can reach her @ 408.238.0794 or you can send any info here to me and 
I'll happily foward it along to her and have her contact you.

 Thanks for every one's indulgence!!!  =)

TMA is trimethoxyamphetamine, the amphetamine analogue of mescaline
(trimethoxyphenethylamine).  Reports generally suggest a stimulating but
less substantial effect for TMA (which could be good, of course...de
gustibus and all).  Couldn't tell you myself, I'm afraid, but thought
people might be interested.

Well I had a rather interesting night at Acid Breaks this Sat. It was a,
how should i say it, a differnt vibe all together. When we got there
around 11:00 the line was miles long. We didn't have pre-sale or anything
so we had to wait in the one in front. All our friends were in the very
front with  a huge mess of people and it would have been impossible to
get in with them. So we got in the way back. We were pretty pissed about
that too. 

Then some fight broke out right ahead of us between two Gs. (Go figure)
The whole line went to look at the fight. We seized the oportunity and
moved way far ahead, but still there was this huge massive clump of
people up ahead.

Oh, Yeah. Before that there was the whole security officer thing or
whatever with the guy in a truck. After that was over I went over to this
girl I know and asked her what happend. She said "Dreamer needed to get
his ass beat." No you guys this girl is not a very nice raver at all. So,
I also heardd it was DJ Dreamer. I later heard that night that he owed
Ghostribe and people a whole lot of money as well. I heard too from
someone who heard (and this is definetly a rumor and need to get this
clarafied) That the scurity were supposed to be looking for him and get
the money or kick his ass or something like that. ( I don't know abouot
all that?)

Well, the line was miles long and everything. And me and ome of my
friends decided to go and take a walk. We walked up the side of the line
saying hi to people talking to other ravers we knew. Then we went to the
pre-sale line and talked to more ravers and met some knew ones and stuff.


Then at the very end of the pre-sale line, by the back of Marina Skate,
some security guard was yelling."Tickets! Tickets!" Some we were like,
Okay. We went up and talked to him and he told us o follow him and he
brought us behind Marina Skate and he told us he would let me and him
bothe in the backdoor for $30 right now. We told him we had a group of
like seven people. He thought about it a minute. He said "Be back in
three minutes with all of them and $90 and i will let you guys in" We
literaly ran back to  the line and told our friends and another raver
friend so he could tell all the ravers (and anyone with a smile) that
were in line to do the same. We brought ten of us and $90 and went in. 

When we got in, there was just about no one inside. The vibe wasn't that
great at all, but I made my own and picked up the goodvibe somewho from
all the cool people there (ravers/goodvibes). So i saww all of my friends
in the Jungle room, where all the best vibes were. Even though we had to
listen to jungle. That room had the best vibes. Then later when Weaver
went on, he started playing some House. He played my favorite song in the
world. It goes "Yes, Yes, Y'all don't stop. Yes, Yes, Y'all don't stop" I
love that song. 

Then Carlos went on and I saw some raver girls that i met back in line
dancing on the  skating barrier wall type platform behind carlos. I
thought it was cool because for once ravers were dancing on a platform
instead of some hoey go go dancers acting all sexual. So I went and
joined them. Then it was us dancing. Later i looked over and there were
at least  five other ravers up there. It was hellza cool. 

I had a lot of fun dancing and meeting new friends and talking to my rave
family and stuff. I think it was good once you got inside and made the
best of it. I feel sorry for you Jaime (Paula's brother) because it was
your first massive and first time sober. This is was a really bad example
of a massive rave. The Gathering was a million times better.

Well, thats pretty much it and stuff. Love all you people out there.

Oh and I was sober too.

Also, Jake from Ghost Tribe, could you please tell us what happend with
DJ Dreamer and such? Also please get new security, these people really
ruin the vibe for everyone outside.

PLUR,
Paul

I've worked for four radio stations in the last 15 years, and have worked
for CBS/Westinghouse quite a bit in the last two years. I've spend a lot of
time consulting the top executives at KPIX. So I think I'm qualified to
make this statement.

Just read _Broadcasting and Cable_ and you can see this same attitude. For
example, VH-1 and E! do extremely low in the ratings (VH-1 is regularly
watched by only 90,000 homes TOTAL each week), yet the networks continue to
deliver programming to a loyal audience.

I guess you could say that any business only exists to generate pleasure
for the owners of that business; be it indirectly through money (used to
buy pleasure) or through more direct means.

The underground scene exists because it generates pleasure for the people
who create that scene. It just bypasses the money middleman.

well, being a film/tv major in college, and having the oppty to hang out 
with the right people, i have to agree with the notion that television, 
EVEN public television nowadays, exists to make money.  there might be 
some compassionate tv owners out there (and lots of independent 
filmmakers), but usually the first people that will get out and build an 
industry are motivated by money and the challenge of achieving 
something.

the same could be said for the film industry.  look at some of the 
actors/actresses that get movies all the time.  sons and daughters of 
actors usully get a good chance.  that's the way the world works.  it's 
not impossible to get on the big screen, just like it's not impossible to 
get a gig spinning at Basics/Gathering.  You just have to pay your dues, 
just like everywhere else.

Its that time again.  The time I dread.  The time to look for a new place 
to live.  My roommate met a girl and fell in love and has decided to move 
to San Francisco to become a rock star.  So I'm stuck high and dry in San 
Jose looking for a new house and a new roommate.   The house I'm in now 
is nice, but its just too small. 

The good news is, I have untill the end of March to find a new house.  So 
I'm starting to look early to find the perfect place.  Ideally, I'd like 
to find a house somewhere in the Race St/The Alameda/Cafe Lavidacus 
(SP?)/Town Theater area of San Jose.  If that doesnt work out, maybe the 
Los Gatos area or some parts of Down Town, like the Taylor and 2nd street 
area.  I'm looking for 1 or 2 other roommates.  I think 4 people in a 
house is getting a little too crowded, unless its a big house.  I 
absolutly do not want to live in an apartment or duplex or condo or town 
house or anything with another living quarter attached to it.      

I work at Apple in the MIQ department.  I work alot.  I'm looking for a 
quit responsible person.  DJ's are fine as long as you dont spin at 3 am 
on a tuesday night.  I have this pet peeve with dirty dishes left in the 
sink.  I used to be really bad with doing dishes.  But then I started to 
hate having to wash a dish everytime I wanted to eat.  Plus, dirty dishes 
start to smell after a while and its really hard to get that dried 
spaghetti sauce off.  So please, no non dish washers.  I am a smoker, but 
I dont smoke inside the house unless what I'm smoking is very green.  I 
have a really cool cat named Midi.  He's my bud.  He sits on the fence in 
front of my house and waits for me to come home everday.  He greets me 
with a simple meow.  He's the most loving cat I have ever met.  He loves 
to curl up on anyones lap.  And he gets along well with others in the 
feline community.  When I'm not working I try to spend as much time at my 
studio doing what I really love, Makin' Music.   So I dont spend too much 
time at home.  Only to eat and sleep.  I'm really not into TV.  I own 
one, but its only to catch the Simpsons and the news on occation.  I dont 
like Cable.  With cable, instead of having 3 channels with nothing on, 
you have 60 channels with nothing on and you get charged 40 bucks a month 
for that.  Although I do kinda miss the Discovery channel!  I dont go to 
Raves as much as I used to.  Maybe one every other month or so.  But I do 
go out to weeklies every now and then.

Well, thats about it.  Please give me a call or email me if you are 
interested in living with a peacefull, easy-goin' guy.  I can pay up to 
about $500 a month.  Any thing more than that is pushing my budget to the 
limit.

Peace,

Mark

That was really beautiful. I am so passionate about the underground because
it's changed my life forever.

Please keep posting about your past experiences, both good and bad. There
is something to be learned from our past since we are doomed to repeat it,
we at least can improve a bit each time!

I believe that more now than ever, we really need some fresh (even if old)
thoughts to help us find our way to a positive future. Rave used to be a
new kind of creature with exciting new energy. It needs to be that again.
We can do it as long as we are 'doing' with intent.

Your letter inspired me to write this:

Lately I have been telling everyone I know that they should create new
energy by having a party in their living room, learn to be a DJ, learn to
make music, be an artist, be beautiful, and to spread inspiration at any
cost. Try to make parties cost nothing but deliver something that can never
be purchased. Change peoples' lives by doing nothing more than express from
your heart. Inspire and lead.

That's what makes a real UG, and as 1997 quickly becomes 1993 again -- it's
going to happen, I sadly promise -- we, the UG, will still exist in our
unoppressible passionate and truth filled expressions that can only come
from real love for what we do. And that most beautiful and truthful
outpouring of energy can never ever really be copied, bottled up and sold
as the product known as rave. It can only be given and shared, because when
it's that real, it is priceless.

Don't be interested, be committed.

I have three folders my sf raves mail may be routed to.

1. into my sfraves folder.
	most things go here.
	(I read most of it)

2. into my sfraves/nrr folder
	everything w/ nrr in the title
	anything posted from certain people
	(I read the contents of this folder when I have insomnia)

3. into my trash folder.
	anything from some other people goes here.
	anything posted my anyone that promotes wearing a d i d a s.
	anything that has the word a d i d a s in it.
	(And I never even see it)

This distillation system works pretty well, although it's not going to stop
a 50 message long thread about e or some other dead horse that is routinely
beaten here.

And that's not even using procmail!

ps: the / character was used in the title to ensure this message got past
Steve Simitzis' NRR procmail filters. Hi Steve! :-)

Hi everyone! I had a great time in Poland, but I feel WAY OUT OF TOUCH. I
heard a bunch of rumors about goings-on in SF during my dissappearance...


did cool world really get busted? was it really because of some funky
herbal drink they were passing out that put a bunch of people in the
hospital?

did Harmony not happen last weekend? Have a lot of parties been
cancelled/busted/etc. lately? I've been told that almost every rave that
was supposed to go off on NYE got busted. That REALLY SUCKS.

How many bitchin' parties did I miss? How was the Gathering? Everyone I
know who went tells me it was the SHIT. How was Acid Breaks? I opted not to
use my "guest list" status on account of some leftover jet lag I was
enjoying, but I've been told it had a really nice, mixed crowd with a drum
n bass room. (whee!)

anything else BIG happen that I'm unaware of?

smiles and such,
-m.

OK SO while all of you are having your wonderful moments with your 
significant others, there are some of us who are pleasantly or 
otherwise single.. SO my question posed is this (perhaps a little 
early, but hey it's posed):
	What's up for Valentine's day WEEKEND other than Love A-Fair? 
While I'd LOVE to spread my love and good vibes, I'm not so sure I 
want to go to a Feel Good Ent. party to do so. Are there any UG 
parties planned for the weekend in question, and if so, why not? It's 
the perfect time for us all to express our love for each other as a 
family, and our love for the music! Who said Valentine's day is only 
for couples? Anyway, just my thoughts on Valentine's day.. :)
Take care all, have a great Tuesday!
Love and hugs,
LAra

Friends:

You asked for it, you got it!!  Due to popular demand (but not my best 
judgement - only 'cuz I gotta work in the AM!), this Thursday is the 
return of the boozin' ravers!  And once again, I'm happy to announce, we 
can party afterwards for a good cause - the benefit party for Headwaters 
Forest and of course, mother earth.

Thursday Night
Drinkin' and Socializin' at a Bar in SOMA  (--> please send suggestions!)
Dancing at GaiaMind ($7 benefit party with a great line-up of dj's and 
                     live acts)

The bar will be located within reasonable distance to the party, so 
(again) no drunk driving!  

Hope to see many of you!  Please RSVP.  Thank you!! -- Nancy

Can anyone recommend some artists/labels/tunes similar to _20 minutes 
of Disco Glory_ by dj garth ? That is a fresh sound and I have been 
digging through many a record store crate looking for similar stuff 
with mixed success.

Had an absolute blast at this party!  A far cry from the usual suburban 
hell of Nikita, the only club I frequent on a semi-regular basis (I won't 
throw MAD into this category!).  I was expecting a cheese pick-up scene 
with great music, and instead was happy to find a pure dance scene with 
great music.  

Only $5 to get in, which we thought was a deal until we started buying 
drinks.  Almost $5 a pop, so a night out at da clubz rivals "expensive" 
raves...but that's no surprise.  This time Spundae stayed at DV8 for 
their special party, and it was PACKED.  The family was out in full 
force - somehow seeing people with glowsticks fills me with a warm gushy 
feeling...

The music rocked all night - the most difficult part of the night was 
deciding which of three rooms to dance in!!  We got down to Carlos' set, 
lotsa breaks and scratches, which sounded great to my tranced-out ears.  
We migrated upstairs during Donald Glaude's set and stayed there the rest 
of the night.  He was bouncing around as usual, getting the crowd into 
it.  Dan came on after and spun a totally trancey set!  Last I heard a 
set of his it was pure house, but that was ages ago.  Then Jerry Bonham, 
who completely rocked the house with trancey techno.  I gazed around and 
saw that EVERYONE was getting down - the people on the dancefloor, on the 
"stage", even the stairs and the balcony!  Not a still pair of feet in 
the house and the energy was palpable.  

After Jerry Bonham came a dj I didn't recognize, but his set of 
unrelenting trance was absolutely addictive.  My body wanted to stop and 
couldn't!  Finally I was on the verge of collapse, and asked someone the 
time - 5:30!!  What happened to the night?  We realized it was hours past 
when our bodies should have shut down, and straggled out, covered in 
sweat, hair frizzed into rave-fros, and smiling.  All I know is that 
after that I fell into the deepest sleep, awakening more than 12 hours 
later!

If anyone knows who that dj was, I'd love to know.  He was a white guy 
with short dark hair and a t-shirt that said "Acid Rules."  

DV8 is _nice_ after dirty warehouses.  Sculptures and fountains?  Wrought 
iron balconies?  Artsy bathrooms?  Pure luxury.

I think I have new faith in the club scene.

:)

well ... i finally understand what it must be like for all you kids when
you hit a F&F party.  We here in the northwest just had our first nw-raves
mailing list party,called PLUR, in seattle.  the love and vibe were
untterly astonishing.  no "big name" djs but we didn't need em .. the
talent we had dropping rekkids was JUST FINE! 

The space was The Lish House in Sea., which was the first theater built in
that city apparently ... and it was once used as a jam space by Jimi
Hendrix, so the atmosphere was jussst right!  :)  we had a turnout of
about 200 ppl.  i can't even believe how amazing it all was!  Free water
and tons of fruit and candy and small toys, a table with lots and lots of
paper and pens to draw with, and a professional photographer taking
portraits for free ... copies will cost the amount of the film!  woohoo!

Went from 9pm to 8am and every moment utterly KICKED  and we're gonna have
MORE of em :) i can't wait!  now i know what i've been missing all this
time!

Although, I strongly disagree with this "concept" of meditation, I will
attempt to be gentile expressing my opinion here... :)

Some of you who are unfamiliar with meditation techniques may want to
experiment with different ones before the alignment... I practice a
technique known as tan tien meditation: simply sit with your butt on your
heels, toes flat on the floor (keeping your back straight) and relax,
breathing deeply through your nose and into your abdomen. you visualize the
energy in your breath flowing through your body, around your head, down
your back and back up the front of your body and out your mouth. this all
happens while breathing. This energy also flows all throughout your body in
a very specific pattern. you focus your energy on a point 3 inches below
your belly button and 3 inches inside of your body, which is your tan tien.
you visualize it as a green (the color of life) sphere, radiating limitless
energy and light... if you concentrate on the tan tien (and ignore any
distractions) you will achieve "one thought". after practicing for a long
while, you may achieve "no thought", where you truly become one with all
that exists. I haven't reached that point, myself, but sometimes I feel
like I have... ;)

I mention this because, I believe that trying to "get something" from
meditation (purposefully) simply will not work. The point of meditation,
IMO, is to unify with all which exists... the universe will have an
oppurtunity to tell you what to do, as your most sublime and "important"
dreams will be communicated to everything that is.

By the way, I'm a Cancer (July 13th), not an Aries.  I agree about people's
posts.  People should donate whatever energy they want to the list.  I learn
so many new things that way, even if it is considered "NRR."  I get so many
perspectives on life, love, community, etc., and I wouldn't trade it for the
world.  It is stuff like that that has been filling up my little groovy rave
book all these years, and these philosophies, thoughts, etc. are related to
us in a very REAL way.  If one little "thought" brings a smile to someone's
face, it is worth it.  Talk to you later!
                           Much peace and love,
                                                  Julie Mae

P.S. Here's my thought for the day:
THE PLEASURE YOU GET FROM LIFE IS EQUAL TO THE ATTITUDE YOU PUT INTO IT.

I don't know if word of this has leaked out yet, but there was a
party in Seattle on Saturday night sponsored by nw-raves that was
just totally da bomb.  Held in an old movie theatre/converted loft
space where Jimi Hendrix used to play back when he was just a local
cat playing in bar bands.  Decorations, video portraits, two rooms
of excellent music, total smiles all around.  DIY all the way, and
it works.

The answer to the current woes of the 'scene', encumbered by aimless
music, profiteering, corruption and incipient commercialization:
go deeper, and never ever ever give up.

After much arguing with my friend about whether to go to Acid Breaks or =
All Together Now, we decided to go hit the city; and damn did we have a =
blast!  Space Children put together a great party-- no bad vibes, no =
harsh looks from anyone, just a whole lotta love...

... and a whole lotta tight beats too!  Props go out to Ceasar, who =
just totally rocked the house with his spinnin, and the next DJ (sorry I =
didn't get a name-- "Rainbow Bridge" or something???) was phat! Good =
work mixing the CDs with the turntables...  did anyone who was there =
catch his name?  He was the one with the long hair with the shirt that =
said "city of angels" on it...

Were there any sfravers that went to this party??? I have yet to meet =
someone from here-- if you were there, I was the big guy wearing the San =
Jose Sharks jersey and smokin' the cloves; walking around with the girl =
wearing the latex top that showed much too much cleavage...   =3DP

Great party, great vibe... =20

Hugs to all...
Doughboy

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

Dear fellow tree huggers,

With the Headwaters rave benefit coming, I thought I would mention (for anyone not 
already in the know) that there are scoping hearings taking place. In fact, there was 
one last week in Oakland and one upcoming in Sacramento. If you make it to a meeting 
you'll be impressed by how people of all kinds have come together to try to save the 
forest. If you can't make it to a hearing, please take a minute and send a letter to 
USFWS. The address is given below. If you want to know more check out 
http://www.igc.apc.org:80/headwaters/hwhome.html or email baaction@igc.apc.org to get 
their updates. The main talking points, at least the ones I used, are to ask the USFWS 
to re-scope the deal to save all 60,000 acres (as opposed to just 7,500 acres), work a 
debt-for-nature swap (as opposed to a nature-for-nature swap which threatens other 
ancient forest and allows the taking of endangered species), ensure that there is 
public oversight of the deal making this time (an end to backroom corporate controlled 
dealmaking which doesn't take biology and sustainability into account), and reinstate a 
moratorium on logging during negotiations. What it boils down to is respecting the 
earth.

Peace, love, and tree hugs.

******************************************************************************

hello?
THE Raver Whitepages haz moved.
The new address is
http://www.chosen.org/ravers/

I NEED HELP!!!
The Raver Whitepages is a non-profit effort to offer the rave scene
something it has lacked previously, a search engine/database consisting of
homepages belonging to ravers, rave related business' (i.e. record stores,
promoters, etc.), and other sites belonging to the rave scene (or the
people in it). I started this on a whim, and flew with the idea - probably
a little too fast. =o)

I am using space on my personal shell account, and spending a lot of my
time checking the sites and entering the data manually after it is e-mailed
to me.

I know there are some brainy sfravers out there...? maybe?
If anyone knows cgi and perl, I would greatly appreciate a script that
would ease the addition/maintenance of the Raver White Pages. I will work
out some kind of a deal, I cant offer money, as I don't have a job
currently, and am spending what little money I get on my internet
access/shell account, but I'm sure that I work out a satisfying deal (if
doing it for a couple Karma Coupons isn't enough). =o)

Any suggestions, help, info, is greatly appreciated. Even if it has nothing
to do with cgi.
If you are offering help, please do not respond to this e-mail using
reply... rather - use this link: mailto:ravers@chosen.org 

-thank you all... much love
-justin

Hello and good morning...

Hope the rain isn't spoiling your daze.  And allthough it's only
Wensday, I feel that it's time to ask who's going to be where this
weekend.

Im trying to muster up some energy to get ta Gaiamind Thurs.
(Drum'n'Bass AND Psychedellic Trance?? hmmm..) and I'm itching to see
GT's "more open space" Friday.  Did I hear that Deaks is spinning @ an
event on Saturday???

I know where I'll be.

C-U
    in the...
          Void.

Uh, yeah I did!  Dan came before Jerry - I wrote about how last time I 
heard him it was straight house and he's moved on (or just expanded) to 
trance.  But I still want to track down the anonymous dj... he started 
spinning around 5AM - Dan was on around 1-3 (the prime hours!)

the road, on the job, in class, etc... but i find myself using it solely 
at home!  its about 6 months old, ive upped the ram on it and have loaded 
it full of software...   i really want to just get a desktop, that's what 
i 'need' more than a laptop...

any raver would hella dig my computer, its 'ravered' out ;)  it looks way 
cool, black with reflective 'racing' stripes!

20/20 is doing a segment on raves this Friday at 10pm on ABC.

I have only seen DJ Dan once, and I don't remember him being any better or
worse than any other club DJ I'd seen before. But if you say so. You and
Madame BigSig  seem to have some kind of unhealthy infatuation for him. I'd
have to recommend counseling.

You mean Smile records out of NYC? Have they ever put anything out that
didn't suck? I mean, Mr. Kirk's 96? What the hell? I just figured that they
were releasing all that crap cute 10" vinyl to make their stuff more
consumeable. I mean if the record sucks it at least looks unique. That will
at least attract the attention of the bubblegum chewing dayglo
teeth-grinding girls out there, but I don't know a single DJ that owns any
of that stuff. :-)

As far as MTV goes, well, what-ever.

Breakbeat? Isn't that for 15 year olds that wear a lot of sportwear and
bring guns to raves?

:-)

Hey, I know there's a whole bunch of San Francisco hipsters out there, so 
please share your local secrets ;)

I'm looking for a cool bar on Mission in SOMA for Boozy Night.

Special plea to my rave sisters: so far, Booze Night is me and five guys 
- which is great odds for me, but gender balance _is_ a beautiful thing.  
Though of course, this list is predominantly male, so I guess 5 to 1 
pretty much mirrors the discrepancy on the list!  (warning: future topic!)

Thanks everyone!  I'll post the location as soon as I have one!

I am *absolutely positive* that it's going to be bad.

	A B S O L U T E L Y

Why, and who's fault is this?

There are a few guilty parties:

#1	Large party promoters that *are* creating huge drug fests for 15
	year olds. They do exist, and if you don't think that's the reason,
you
	are simply in denial.

	There is definitely a category of shitty, drug filled kiddy raves that
	only exist as a manufactured channel created for the purpose of
selling
	drugs. I dare you to dig deep and find out where these pimped-out 15
	year olds are getting the $$$ backing to have these parties.

	Do the math:
	$20-$30  for entry    	x 3000  =  $60,000 - $ 90,000
	$20-$100 for drugs	x 3000  =  $60,000 - $300,000
					= $120,000 - $390,000

	Now would *you* produce an drug-fest event with multi-thousands of
	high 15 year old's if you could earn $100,000-$400,000+ in *one* night?

Now go look at the SF Raves calendar for 1996/1997 and look for all those
parties you know fit this mold. Compare that with the number of HUGE
parties in 1992 or 1993. There were probably quite a few of them then, too.

Now move forward to 1994 and notice that there probably aren't that many
parties like this at that time. Well, that's because parties like those,
with that intent, is what caused the entire community to cave in on itself.

Did those huge party promoters care that they were shitting on your
community or your passion? I really doubt it. They were at home "taking a
break" during 1993/4/5, counting the hundreds of thousands of dollars they
made while selling you out in 1992/3 and waiting for their next big chance.
Well, 1997's here.

Well, if you were still really interested in the 'church of rave', you were
probably going to small parties in people's houses and to small, unpromoted
renegades in 1994-1995... but then what happened?

Okay, fast forward to 1996/7. The HUGE parties came back again..... to cash
in -- again.



#2	The media salivates to run a "do you know where your teenager is --
	at an all night drug fest having sex with strange people in a secret
	location. (thanks, sLeeza!)

	Based on this "yellow journalism" style of  reporting, why would the
	media *want* to know anything more than #1 exists.

	Thousands of 15 year olds on designer drugs are *news*.

	Dozens achieving personal transformation are *human interest*.



There you have it. Next question! (said in a John Maclaughlin tone) :-)



PS: *I *DO NOT* put the Gathering/Freedom in this category.

Flame me or thank me, I don't care.
I'd be happy to hear your comments either way.

I've enjoyed Dan's spinning clear back to days he did No Doz in LA with
Ron D. Core.  (Yes, beleive it or not!)  Don't see anything unhealthy
about having a favorite dj.

Wayne.  <shaking head> wayne wayne wayne.  I love breakbeat... always have...
It has a lot of funk and groove to it.  A little breakbeat infusion
could really spice up the music scene up here.  Suggested listening:
Eric Davenport, Simply Jeff, ect.

Are you *absolutely positive*?

Maybe you should wait and see it.  20/20 is not hard copy.  I suspect
20/20 will present both sides of the story, to varying degree.

Even the "Fox undercover!" segment that dealt with the LA desert rave
scene about a year ago had some positivity to it, like saying that these
kids just want the freedom to have fun, compared the vibe to Woodstock,
ect.

I was lying. I have Air Liquide 10" double pack, too.

One time I saw DJ Dan in the basement of 1015 (a long long time ago)
and basically couldn't help but place myself infront of the DJ booth
and watch this superhuman DJ mix record after record after record
seamlessly with an average of about 1 mix every minute or two (this
might be somewhat shocking to those used to Goa Trance or whatever one
calls the trendoid psychedelic trance enjoyed by twitchingly unfunky
WASP/EuroTrash types worldwide where they mix the same boring crap for
hours on end unrelentingly while everybody is off pretending they're
stars in some lame step aerobics video on fast-forward :-) :-). Anyways
IMHO, DJ Dan is way awesome. Check out his CD "loose caboose" -- one of
the better mix CD's i've heard in a long time, though i'd rather see
him live.

> Breakbeat? Isn't that for 15 year olds that wear a lot of sportwear and

I don't think I'd call Dan's style "breakbeat", though he gets good n'
funky, hard n' acidic, or just nicely prog-housy. And quite frankly,
i'd rather listen to breakbeat than all this psychedelic/goa trance
shite that's plaguing the scene lately. Maybe I'm just too old but I
just can't wrap my head around that "music" -- seems designed for the
post-acid-casualty-lost-all-sense-of-rhythm-after-snorting-too-
much-crank-just-got-abducted-by-aliens-they-stuck-cold-metallic-probes-up-
my-bunghole-so-now-i-hop-around-like-the-energizer-bunny set :-) :-) :-)

<look who this is from...  ;)   -troy>

-----

Last week a pop star called Brian Harvey, lead singer of E17, stirred the
shit when he gave an interview saying that Ecstasy can make you a better
person. Unfortunately, he also said that he'd taken 12 at a go without any
problem and driven home on E. Brian looks like a sexless sweetie who
appeals to teeny boppers and who is very high in the charts but of course
despised by ravers.

There was the most amazing response. The Prime Minister even mentioned it
in parliament. The MP who is proposing a new bill that will make club
owners liable to lose their licenses if drugs are found also mentioned it
in parliament, and asked a minister to have Brian arrested on the charge of
incitement to break the law; really over the top!
As one of my readers wrote to me:

" Now Brian Harvey went on the record yesterday as saying what he sees as
the truth about ecstasy. I've never been able to stand Brian Harvey either
as an artist or as what I've seen of him as a person. I think he looks
ridiculous and his 'music' is shit. However, yesterday I thought he
actually made a bit of sense.
"He is the the first person I've ever heard reported as saying that ecstasy
can help to make you a better person - a sentiment that I whole-heartedly
agree with and know to be true for myself and several friends. But look
what happens! He gets kicked out of his band, their new single is
practically banned, suddenly every club in the country is in imminent
danger of being shut down, and the name of Leah Betts is once again
plastered across our headlines. Harvey has to be an absolute dickhead to
take 12 E's in a night (if it's true!) and even more so to say so, but all
credit to him for 'coming out'."

There followed a 5 page spread in the Daily Mirror (Britains biggest
selling paper) all about the horrors of Ecstasy and with spreads ringed by
oval-framed portraits of innocent young people who were victims of the
killer drug. 17 radio stations announced an immediate ban of E17 records. I
was invited to go on TV twice with the Betts which I refused, but I
accepted Newsnight who edited me (fairly) saying that Brian's remarks and
hysteria were just what the government needed to push through its new bill.

The serious papers said very little. The Guardian had a funny piece headed
"Pop star trips up over E",
but the popular morning radio programme interviewed clubbers who all made
positive comments like: "Yes, its true Ecstasy does make you a better
person".

	20/20 still has that, this is different and therefore somewhat
evil aspect to it. I cannot see Barbara Walters saying, "You know (guy who
has brown hair), these things are neat." What I can see is her asking so
what are the authorities doing to try and stop these things. My parents
watch this everytime I visit them and Barbara Waters never seems to like
anything, everything is always an outrage. I cannot see their
investigative report actually finding out about one that I would consider
decent. How does someone who does not know anything about raves, does not 
know people who go to raves, get into raving and do an accurate report on 
what's going on? I guess we'll see.

  I was wondering if the disc could live up to the excitement it 
generated (for me) from such an interesting and provacative title.  I 
instantly thought, "wow, this must be the disc for me.  cd's *are* cool 
after all."

AHH yes I can see it now..
Good thing I have a VCR, this thing'll be taped!

<Walters looks into the camera shaking her head sadly with eyes watering>

<Walters> This, my friends, is a story about teenagers, looking for 
an answer in life, and falling victim to an underground circuit of 
mindless music, drug abuse and sex orgies.

<insert negative long excerpt from a CoolWorld-type rave>
<insert sad story of a mother "losing her child" to the rave scene 
and drugs>
<insert story of FX-type dealie in LA>
<insert 100 generalizations>

<Walters, again, looking sadly into the camera with eyes watering>

<Walters> These so-called "raves" are supposed to be fun, but they 
are tearing our children from their families and forcing drugs down 
their throats. Back to you Hugh.

<Hugh> Sad.. Sad.. <shaking head> those poor children... Next time, 
on 20/20, the evils of the Gerber food company..  

HAHA! :) Have a great weekend everyone! :)
Love and Hugs,

(1) The only reasons us human monkeys do anything at all other than
scratch our butts is cuz we're showing off. Unless you're a solipsist
or a pathological masturbator, a creative pleasure enjoyed alone is not
equal to a creative pleasure shared, IMHO.

(1.5) DJ Dan, IMHO, doesn't grandstand. He doesn't backspin records
with his hands behind his back. He just DJ's, slickly, smoothly,
professionally and very, very well. Why should the audience be ashamed
of appreciating quality and talent? Why should the performer not use
the skills he has to increase our enjoyment? Yeah, "rock star syndrome"
is a sickening thing when people get all Beatlemania about their fave
performers. But that doesn't change the fact that someone like Paul
McCartney had a great genius for writing catchy songs.

(2) perhaps Dan has so many records he likes that he wants to play them
all within his limited DJ slot and within the confines of our short
attention spans. I personally get bored when a DJ plays a dance music
track for more than 3 minutes (unless the track itself puts forward a
changing soundscape that isn't monotonous from beginning to end).

True, but according to XLR8R, the Fox show was responisble for a number
of party crack downs that happened shortly after Fox aired the show.

  Far be it for me to post something negative, but every so often I deserve
one unhappy post.  The topic of love made me think of writing.  I broke up
with a wonderful boyfriend a week ago, due to circumstances that were ruining
our relationship.  While we are still friends, I miss the closeness we used
to have.  My birthday is two days before Valentine's Day, and I feel I
deserve a reason to cellebrate.  I will probably get a hotel room and spend
the weekend in the city.  So what's worth going to?  I'm in desperate need of
a party.

  So this weekend my best friend and I decide to cheer up our boyfriendless
selves and go blow our entire paychecks.  (or at the very least a good chunk
of them)  We headed down towards a mall somewhere in the east bay... looking
for some everyday clothes to suit our mood.  I got to the mall when Lo and
Behold... that famous comercialized gothic store Hot Topic lay before us.
 Never one to pass up a new opportunity, I cruised in and had a looksee.  Oh
sure, dressing in black,maroon,and purple velvet, vinyl and chains can get
boring; but why not just pick a few items to mix and match.  After all,
 variety is the spice of life.  Never mind the morbid thread labels on every
item, or the fact that if a group of gothics saw people in all black talking
about being spirtual and giving out hugs they'd slit their wrists, I needed a
change.  And then I saw it... my one true weakness in life-- VINYL.  Just to
try them on, I thought and carried them into the black dressing room.  Once
they hit my skin I knew I had to by them.... black vinyl hip huggers with
three silver stripes (no not addidas) running down each leg.  As much as I
wanted to resist, I couldn't help myself.  Of course I had to wear the brand
new pants, so I headed to school on Tuesday with my matching vinyl sneakers

the F8 party i would not doubt that you saw me or i saw you because i =
think i smiled and offered peppermint candies or lifesavers to =
all....and a HUGE smile along with the treats.  i went with my honey =
anthony (wearing a white fat albert t-shirt)..(i was in a white tank top =
with rainbow stripes across the front and a tigger backpack)...anyway we =
got in there pretty early and did a little groovin' and just got our =
minds and bodies ready for the awesome night ahead.  DRC was greaaat!  i =
love chick music makers...so cool.  she just got me stompin' and =
smilin'.....then mystr-e!!! yikes my cheeks were so sore from smilin and =
groovin'...at this point i began my rounds on the smile patrol....i made =
it my duty (one which i thoroughly enjoyed) to talk to everyone i could. =
 i met so many people and of course can't really remember any names, but =
i do remember erin the bongo guy...he went off on those things...a guy =
who was relly tall with bleached short hair and these awesome Wicked =
pants...and the girl with the buzzed orabge hair who rooms with rob? and =
the other guy with the awesome english accent, but alas...i'm taking way =
too long here.  point being i had a GREAT!!!! time and if you saw me let =
me know.  i hope anyone who might have gone had as good a time as i =
did...and if you didn't go....go next time.  one stellar party! =20

peace, love, and hugs to all:
                                                                         =
                      mac: a girl ;)
                                                                         =
 like the truck without a "k"
                                                                         =
 like the make-up M.A.C.
                                                                         =

all door profits at the big new years party plus "control of all the
drugs", whatever that means... apparently, when they found the owner of
X-static (toronto's "rave headquarters" clothing + mix-tape shop) hung
in the shop, those who were close to him were saying it wasn't
suicide... and apparently the employees of x-static were threatened at
the new year's party... when it get's so big that people have to die
over money, then the whole thing collapses... we have the big shitty
commericial parties at clubs and concert venues now, and small UG things
are forced into smaller clubs... the police are everywhere... and no one
really cares to throw a party anymore... too much hassle...

all i can say to the scene of san francisco is... don't let mob elements
into the underground, or even the scene at large if it isn't too late...
don't buy drugs that have addictive substances... they ALL come from mob
sources who want return business...  heroin (synthetic and organic),
crystal meth, cocaine and any other addictive narcotic (go for
psychedelic, not narcotic) guarantee return business... you vote with
your dollars, and should not put up with crap... i've gone without e at
parties for two years now, because 95% of it was mob shit...


 Hopefully

in toronto, because there was such a massive influx of people who
couldn't tell, the commercial parties became what was "in" and the
underground drowned out in commercialism... 

 then the real good raves will

the bad people have their glorified rave/club scene, and the UG can't
throw parties in warehouses because new bi-laws and zoning shit has gone
down that prevents raves in anything but a club... now who has vested
interest, and investment capital to get into purchasing a club... well,
the mobsters with money... and the establishment who want people
contained in the proper vice medium... the bar... keep 'em loaded... as
long as nothing "mind-manifesting" happens we'll let it slide...

there have been successful, peaceful good-vibe massives (alien
visitation and transcendance) in toronto, but most people feel this is
because more out-of-towners came (they had really big international
line-ups) and joined the UG to make them big, because you just didn't
see your average toughguy/raver redneck at these parties... the ones who
were there were certainly 'tamed' by the good vibe, though...


 If every raver show up supper early for one massive and we all

one can only hope...

i really hope what happened in toronto doesn't happen in frisco... be
careful... the people i have interacted with and observed lurking on
this list have a sense of family that is seriously lacking in the
east... i am really impressed with the "call to arms" that seems to
occur when shit goes down... the main thing is to maintain a positive
outlook on where your headed, but be fully conscious and make sure that
you are headed away from the bullshit money ethic... true wealth can not
be counted... negativity always exists, balance is the key...

be aware, not weary...

good luck...

 I must humbly take issue with this sentiment. No disrespects to the auther.

 When I was growing up I couldn't draw. My art instructors would try but 
I wouldn't draw. I honestly felt like I couldn't draw.

 I get into junior college for the first time (studying laser technology) 
and decide to take a drawing class to fulfill a GE. Reminder; I had never 
drawn up tp this point, not even to doodle.

 Because of the beautiful, gentle and nuturing vibe of the instructor I 
started drawing. By the time I was out of that class I had changed my 
major to the arts. I'm still there.

 Drawing (for me) was not about showing my pictures (and later poems) to 
others and going "hey, check out my cool drawing." Very few people saw my 
early work. I drew and wrote because I had to or go insane. The 
incredible mental pressure of my life was healed and the tension resolved 
through my art. In my drawings and writings my sub-concious, soul, 
spirit, forces from beyond were communicating with me and helping me. I 
recieved so much from my art that I desprately needed and could not get 
anywhere else.

 I think that Neils statement above may be true for some but certainly 
not for all.

i have heard of a study done on E and AIDS, and ironically (because E
apparently has a massive toll on your immune system, although i've never
experienced it) E has reversed the process of HIV infection... in most
cases reduced the count, but in some cases actually eradicated HIV from
the bloodstream... being a practitioner of eastern schools of medicine,
i am well aware of the connection of mind, body and spirit... i think
AIDS is more of a psychological virus, and E- in boosting the inner
self, has potential to boost the true bodhi-temple self so to speak...
it would of course have to be used more therapeutically...

is there anyone out there with a suspicion that AIDS has been
"created"...?

how about the term "pinks" which the church of the subgenius borrowed
from (the black panthers?) in reference to "suburban white man".... and
the "glorp" is someone who is consciously such...

this is all in reference to degraded genetics, and degraded upbringings
which produce degraded human beings... one can, of course, constantly
re-create their DNA at all times, so if you're conscious enough, you can
choose not to be a "pink"... "glorps" on the other hand...

let's not get into the new world order...

Ummm...as a believer in eastern thought and having done both research
towards a cure for HIV-1 infection and amphetamine pharmacology, I don't
think that AIDS (HIV-1 actually) could be considered a psychological virus.
It is very real.  I do however tend to agree with you that the body - if
balanced - can be very effective in defending itself from such an assault.
Herbs, accupuncture are very natural and are established ways of healing
that are diametrically opposed to the practice of western medicine which
merely prescribes a drug that has a specific and singular pharmacological
action that treats a single problem.  Proper chi flow and balance are
important elements.  MDMA, however, is a synthetic.  While I am _very_ far
from condemning the use of E on occasion, I can't see it being used as
balancing agent.  There are far better ways.


>is there anyone out there with a suspicion that AIDS has been
>"created"...?
>alchemist

It is, IMHO, with the right technology entirely possible to create a deadly
virus.  However, this virus has been around for quite awhile (reported as
far back as 1951)...before the advent of the age of PCR and supercomputers
used for sequencing (no not that kind, you MIDI-heads :)  )

<< MHO, DJ Dan is way awesome. Check out his CD "loose caboose" -- one of
 the better mix CD's i've heard in a long time, though i'd rather see
 him live. >>

i would have to agree with niels on this one. dan is one of the baddest

on two turntables. for those of you who think that dan is less than stellar,
make sure that sarvi doesn't know who you are. she doesn't take kindly to

I propose having Monday Night Dinner once per month rather than every
week. I think more people would go because people would actually look
forward to it as an event.

Suggestions?

Steve

Did you happen to snap a picture of DJ Ghost holding a sign saying

"I voted myself the bay area's #1 DJ on my flyer! Aren't I k00l!!1!"


(Ok, you may now returns to your meth, markers, spraycans and circle dancing.)

ps: I have to apologize for being in such a foul mood lately. I think I
have started drinking from the same water supply Neils does. :-)

I *love* women in vinyl and even better - latex. In fact there's nearly
nothing else that equals those materials for fetish clothing. :-)

So, when do we get to have the first San Francisco hardcore music + fetish
clothes rave? :-)

For a quasi-corperate enviorment.  The stanards are a bit formal (i.e.
clean clothes, must be able to pass a drug test, technical experiance
ect).  The only reason im posting this is because my worklife is
begining to infringe on my "other" (I.E. this) lifestyle, and if it
imposes too much, i'll have ta drop one or the other...  

So if you have the know how in working with the insides of computers (A+
experience perferred) and you're tired of sitting on yer lazy butt,
staring @ this damn screen and wanna make some dough (ya know) give me a
buzz cuz.


(P.s. sorry for the bandwith waste)

please email me responses and I'll see what I can do to score an
interview...

Yes, natural indeed.  No unnatural substance enters the body.   The needles
induce the body to release natural pain killers (endorphins.)  Once the
needles are removed, nothing foreign is left.  Again, I'm not condemning
the use of synthetics; merely the use of E as a balancing agent:

"MDMA, however, is a synthetic.  While I am _very_ far
from condemning the use of E on occasion, I can't see it being used as
balancing agent.  There are far better ways."

Sure can.  My stacks of research are in storage, so I can't provide you
with an immediate reference (I'll look it up on the Medline if you want)
but cases were indeed reported in the '50's.   The authenticity of this has
been debated.  Confirmed cases were not seen until the late '70's early
'80's.

Hope to see some of you at Gaiamind today.

According to my mathamatical computations (hey, who said math had
anything to do with spelling) The alignment of the stars dosn't occur in
1996, but the year 1699 instead, so we're a tad bit late (well in cosmic
time im sure a few hundered years is late).

Actually, im writing because through some cosmic twist of fate everyone
has been flooding the voicemailbox of some poor office clerk by the name
of Adrianna instead of the Gaiamind voice mail.  The number (correct
number) of the Gaiamind VM is 415.789.7673.  C-U tonite.

I'm a bit torn over which event to attend tonight: Gaiamind or Jungle Love.
Does anyone have anything to say about the previous Jungle Love event? I'm

completely converted. Any opinions as to which may provide the most

Ack!  Thank you to all the kind people who sent suggestions, but it seems 
I may have misled people.  I need a bar on the street Mission in SOMA 
(maybe I just don't know my neighborhoods) - but think anywhere below 
approx. 9th Street.

I do now have a great list of bars _in_ the Mission.  Will use them for a 
future Boozers!

Well good. Small dinner gatherings of 2 to 6 people are something I do
every day of the week anyway. It's nice to have a small dinner with a
few friends, but there's no need to make an "event" out of it and put
it up on the calendar...

If it were monthly, it would be something that people looked _forward_
to, because it would be something special and fun. 

So what do you say?! Everyone go to Matt's birthday dinner this coming
Monday, then after that, the last Monday of every month will be the
big gathering of hungry ravers... :)

...and when *I* hear someone mixing in and out of tracks
quickly, it reminds me of being in a dirty warehouse in
Detroit, listening to Jeff Mills, Claude Young, and Stacey
Pullen. 

Mixing quickly can be a problem if it impedes the flow, but
in the hands of someone skilled, a quick mix, a long ride,
and a little bit of style during the mix can turn two
records into something completely new. There's nothing like
listening to a good DJ ripping songs apart and putting them
back together all night, only to realize that the melodic
chunk you've been hearing is a snippet of "Strings of Life,"
which is just starting to come in for real.

I almost hate to say this because it doesn't seem to be a
very popular sentiment in San Francisco, but when I go out,
I am there to enjoy the mixes between the songs just as much
as I am there for the music. When a DJ leaves a song in for
five or seven minutes, only to do a smooth fade (which
takes, oh, thirty seconds) to another seven minute track, I
end up feeling bored and deprived. For me, the tension,
energy, and ephemeral nature of a live performance is only
captured while the DJ is actually working the records
together. When Robert Armani spins, he breaks up the
structure of songs and always leaves you guessing. When
Bileebob and Paris tag team, you always end up hearing
something unexpected. When Derrick May has a good night, you
leave the party shaking your head and smiling, with a new
understanding of what is possible with two turntables.

Quick mixing is not an end in itself, but it's essential for
a style of mixing in which songs are taken apart and
reassembled in new and interesting ways.

Now, those who know me know that I'm not into the whole spirituality/human
potential movement thing, but I still spent a good twenty minutes on my
roof with a few close friends in deep meditation and it felt SO HEALTHY.

I think I need that kind of peace every morning before class...

take care,

hello all-

i'm annoyed.

i must say, changing the monday night dinner to once a month is not a good
idea.  give people the chance to come when they want.  if you want to come
once a month, do so!  if you want to come once a week, do so.  don't
require that others want abide by your own schedule.

i have met some fantastic people over the past couple weeks at small,
imtimate monday night dinners.  i've also met some people at large dinners,
and you know what?  they're all good.

saying that you might come once a month but not once a week does not make
sense.  you come when you want to, and don't require that others fit your
schedule.

i will continue to have and promote them once a week, and anyone that
wishes to come once a week, please continue!  anyone that wishes to come
once a month, please do so!  if you wish to organize a larger, more
attended one, please do so!  i've arranged my schedule around keeping this
time free each week, and changing that now would be unfair to the person
who started the whole thing.

yes, i do take this personally.  live by your own schedule, just don't
require that others live by it, also.

love and annoyance-

The 20/20 report on raves is already posted at:

http://www.abc.com/primetime1/twenty/012497.html

And don't miss the hard hitting expose on sexual addiction!

Anyone want to hit them with another fraud lawsuit?  Or at least some
angry letters.

well I just got a look at the 20/20 report on the web, and lemmee tell 
you it aint so pretty.

here's the lowdown (according to Babs)


raves are "a haven for drug taking with a dance beat"

-over 70% of ravers are on drugs and if you aren't, well then you just 
stick out (according to an unnamed quoted "raver")

-there was a whole bit on the girl who died in Florida because of X and 
how her mother put the X dealer in jail for manslaughter

-and a last bit of advice from 20/20? - if your kids want to go to a rave 
then you better go with them


hell, i agree- I've tried to get my mom to come and check it all out- I'd 
rather have her see for herself what it's all about.  But she doesn't 
ever actually seem to want to.  Oh well- And I'm going home on Saturday - 
No doubt the parents will have watched the whole thing - I can just hear 
it now...

mom:  jess, are you still going to those rave things?

me:  sometimes

mom:  wait a minute here,  you're always telling us how broke you 
are- that money we give you is for groceries.  NOT Drugs.  

me:  I don't spend my grocery money on drugs mom.

mom:  yeah when I was your age I got them for free too.  :)

Here's what I had to respond about ABC's web report on raves:

---_Adam
"Stay Connected"

*************************************************

I, for one, am utterly disgusted in the so-called' "report" on raves for
your Friday night slot. 

       Myself being in the "Scene" for 7+ years am sick of such
misrepresentation that these reporters convey.  News is news, non-biased
reports on facts.  Through the years I have gone to "parties" (Ie on a
weekend basis).  I have seen no fatalites.  Yes, there is a drug element
with the underground, but please crossection this with say, a rock
concert, garlic festival, and other events which have a crowd of people
converging to relax and be merry.  I believe the statictis will prove a
drug percentage of at least 60% if not more.  Bear in mind that the term
"drug use" is not connitated to illegal drugs, but any substance used
for the purpose to derive a feeling of euphoria.  Your report stated,
"Over seventy percent of the kids said they were on drugs,".  I would
like to know which drugs are being referenced.  Alchol?  Cannabis? Only
"hard drugs" (I.e. LSD, Ketamaine, MDMA) have been mentioned.  This
further skews the perception that is being conveied to the public.  I
would also like to see the documentation that colaberates how MDMA (or
any of its deritatives: MDA, MDMO) produces a rise in body temperature.
None of the scientific essays I have read has ever mentioned this. 
 
          Reflecting on this snippet from your 20/20 website, no mention
of the age difference was convayed whatsoever.  I understand concern for
childrens sake.  However, there is the illusion that raves are only
frequented by minors.  The crossection of ravers that I have seen range
from 16 to 45 yrs or older with the median age of 21 +/- three years.
Tradtionaly 18 is the come-of-age year in many states many parties also
have an 18 or over rule as well (due to the nationwide "crackdown" of
our scene). So I believe we're talking about more of a "generation X"
age range that frequents these events and not the Youth of America.  

America as a whole is changing. Both CA and AZ, propisitions have been
passed that were supported by the underground comunity.  Many more want
to see change.  We, the future of america see these parties as escapes
from the ritual bar scene, or monotimy of the monday - friday 9-5 grind.
 I work on a corperate envorment. I DJ and party on weekends.  I will
protect my scene from such shoddy journalistic witch hunts.  Please
understand that we on the inside are aware of our deficencies.  Are you
aware of yours?

Thank you for your time,
                                        Anakin

Hmm, perhaps somebody should start a parents who support the rave scene
type group. Mine came to the first rave I threw and thought it was great.

The 20/20 report is obviously a gross misrepresentation and is the type of
thing I'd expect from a tabloid show. From the online transcript it would
appear they didn't talk to any reputable promoters and carefully selected
their quotes for maximum sensationalism. The way they describe parties
brings to mind a vision of preschool on a day all the teachers are gone.
I'd also like see the methodology by which they obtained the hypothesis
that 70% of ravers are on drugs at any given party.

What's most troubling is that this is a national prime-time show and is no
doubt watched and believed by much of america.

I think it would be wise to contact the producer of the segment as well as
the reporter. The producer should be credited on the actual show - I'm
going to make sure and tape it.

Joe

And Mon Nite Massive Dinners with flyers and such!!

Well, that's nice and all, but I've become bored with the prospect of
meeting every week. Others have too, and many people I've spoken to
both on and off-line have seemed interested in the idea of a monthly
dinner thing instead.

Notice how small the attendance has been. Notice how people will come
once to dinner and _never_ come back. The first few dinners were cool,
when the idea was still new and fresh. But going out to restaurants
every week can be draining on even those of us who are well
employed. Speaking for only myself, if I'm going to spend $15 or so
for a dinner, there had better be a really cool occasion to do so.

Continue having it every week, if you'd like. But I like looking
forward to things that don't happen very often. I like variety; I
don't like redundancy. Those are my personal preferences, hence my
suggestions for improving something which (all IMHO, of course) is
flawed.

> yes, i do take this personally.

That's a shame. Now if I were to call you a flaming asshole, then you
should take _that_ personally. ;)

Well? If this Monday's dinner kicks ass, then I'll reconsider....:)

I can see how there are benefits and drawbacks to both weekly dinners and
monthly dinners. Some people may prefer frequency others may prefer size.
Perhaps a workable middle ground would be holding one every other week, or
maybe have one "Big Dinner" every month.

I've enjoyed the dinners I've attended, but I haven't been able to make
every one. I'll keep on going to as many as I can.

Terrence.

since when?

news is gibbel inbetween commercials like any other tv program... it has
to stay as much in line with "the program" and should never radically
interfere with the agendas of the sponsors... read Noam Chomsky's
"Manufacturing Consent" or rent the movie of the same title for more

Hi...

   I'm back on the list,  with a new Email address.    My WELL.COM Email
address is totally hosed, thanx to more attempts to sabatage my business.

   Glad to see the list admin people put in confirmation,   although it
makes it harder to get on ths list,   at lease it prevents spamming.

   Since I've been gone from the list for a long time,    how are things?
How is Omar?     Any reports?     Haven't heard much news from down here
in SD area.

   I'm no longer afiliated with the Loft,  after learning it was controlled
by a "Cult"....    Soon,  I'm going to write a very long piece on the LOft,
and all the things that happened there.    As soon as it's up on my WEB site,
I'll post a short announcement on the list.    It's rave related.

   We're doing a weekly thing down here in Pacific Beach at the Stella Bella
Coffee shop called "SideShow",   bringing in big name local DJ's....   It's a
small space,   but the music will be excellent and varied,  with trip hop,
jungle,  trance (Goa and Cybertrance),  breaks,  and other music Genre's.

  Anyway,  glad to be back on the list,  and now I won't be mail-bombed anymore
with my new address.

  Down here,  the pigs are shutting down raves much more frequently,  due to the
problems at "7th heaven" Newyears.    How is it up there?

  While up there,   I attended Karma at the so called new Acme,   now managed
by some really cool Russians,   specializing in Goa trance.    I'm jelious,  now
there are 3 possee's of Goa trance....   F-8,  CCC,  and Karma...   Way to go,
and lets continue to promote and have more Trance parties.     Yay!!

  Anyway,   it was really great to get up there and party with you,  although I
only attended the Digital Be-in (Thanx Wayne),  and Karma,   it was really great
to dance with you all again.

Jungle Love is fun.  Sure, the Troc is not the ideal venue, with fascist
security gaurds marching around like they are the sole entities preventing
the whole club from erupting into total anarchy and chaos...

But, the sound system certinaly delivers the bass, there will be plenty
of people groovin' out on the dance floor, ect.

Its still a club and not an UG like Audio Impact... but it is a very good
club.

Well, what did you expect?  Honestly?  I forget who it was that did the
rather funny but frighteningly believable spoof on Barbara Walters and
her watering eyes, but they pegged it.  The media has boiled raving down
to three elements:

1. Drugs
2. Lack of parental or police supervision
3. Deaths due to various elements found in rave environment

They even occasionally harp on the idea of staying up all hours of night
dancing (a la "Hard Copy"), but these are the main three elements they
always hit on.

And we all know what an evil drug Ecstacy is, right? .........  ;)

The problem is, they're not totally off base.  These things *do*
happen.  Kids take WAY too much of whatever is available.  Moderation
and self control are not part of the culture.  This is a "burn the
candle at both ends AND the middle" scene for the younger set.  They are
busy partying harder than any generation before them, or so they think.

The point is, to the majority of parents out there, this is exactly what
they fear most, so the press is going to grab them on the back of the
neck, push their collective noses in it and scream in their ear, "DO YOU
KNOW WHERE *YOUR* CHILDREN ARE?"  It sells, they're selling it.

And I'll be honest with you, in the short time I was raving with any
frequency, I saw it go from a more spiritual coming together to a bunch
of young kids blowing their brains out with as much drugs as they could
stuff in their bodies at one time without bursting into flames.

I'm not talking about all raves, but the mid-size to massives usually
fit this stereotype fairly closely.  Nowadays, if you try to present the
spiritual, giving, loving, PLUR side at a party, you're labelled as
"old-skool".

MY POINT IS: Don't look too harshly at the media.  Yeah, they don't ever
report the whole story, but the elements they do hold up to the light,
exaggerated as they may be, are truthful in themselves.  There are bad
elements in the rave scene.  If you don't want them exposed, leave
nothing to expose.

"They're all mad cause they think I'm giving them hell.  I'm not giving
them hell, I'm just telling the truth on them."

Is everybody ready for the wild and scary prospect of actually meeting 
the people behind these anonymous computer screens?!  Tonight's your chance!

The Official Booze Plan:

9ish - Cadillac Bar
	between 4th/5th and Howard/Mission
	(behind Chevy's Restaurant in an alley, next to huge parking lot)

11ish - off to Gaiamind 
	(the $7 benefit party for Headwaters Forest - check the calendar 
	for the amazing line-up!)

So far we have about 8 people joining the festivities, so it should be a 
nice little (or maybe big!) group.  Special thanks to the ravechicks who 
came to my rescue (so to speak)!

Cadillac isn't the hippest place in the world, but last time I was there 
they had a GREAT bartender, great guac and chips, and it's right next to 
a parking lot and is close to our final destination.

Also, dancing afterwards isn't a requirement.  I may even have to flake out 
because of work.  But it's an option if ya want to dance!

I'm gettin' excited!  See ya tonight!  I'll have a star on my cheek and 
probably a faux fur coat (warm!).  Dark hair.

Too many thanks to the many folks of this list that recommended the way
cool F8 party last week... now I need you to do it again!  Y'see, you
did such a great job with the last time that now Ive got tons of newbies
begging me to find them a good party!  Last time I had 3... this time
probably even more.  So if ya dont mind, lemme know where you think
the vibe will be this and next weekend...  cause I will probably be there
too!  (It would be cool if the event had something other than trance...
like the breakbeat at F8... and maybe an ambient room! :-)

(For those who dont recall, I am the Sailor-suited Fighter For Justice -
Sailor Moon).

Now, for a little ranting off-subject :

The 20/20 story is more trouble than you might think.  My experience in
Pgh was that, every time one of these stories runs, newbies flock to find
some 'cool underground' so that they can get high and laid.  Its not
too disasterous, but the people who want to irritate their parents latch
on immediately (and dump it once they get sick of spreading around the
nasty vibe).  In other words, I for one will be adopting the hard shell
approach when it comes to people who are cold at these things for a while.
Normally, I keep talking (I know how it can be to get people out of a
shell... I live there myself all-too-often).

But, on a lighter note, the people I will be escorting couldnt be
friendlier so there will be some happy new faces.

Njoi,
- David

No.

no! no! no!

The damage caused by this 20/20 segment goes far beyond making parents
and authorities paranoid about raves.

The real sad thing is that millions of kids will watch this and they will
indeed beleive that this what raves are about.

***The main reason raves are becoming more like teeny drug fests is becuase the
media is telling all these kids that is what they are***

If actual ravers were in control of the media, like, for example, SFRAVES,
kids would learn that raves were about spirituality... about grooving
down to funky beats... and yes, becoming more aware through mind expansion,
in whatever form.

I look with incredible harshness to the media.  They are creating a scene
that never was.  Their lies are permiating and what stories they make up 
becomes reality for all those hooked in to them.

                ABC NEWS "20/20" REPORTS ON "RAVES," UNSUPERVISED
                ALL-NIGHT DANCE PARTIES WHICH HAVE BECOME POPULAR,
                                FRIDAY, JAN. 24=20

     "Raves," an underground movement which gathers large numbers of
     young people at secret locations for all-night dance parties, have
     become popular in recent years. But beneath the laser lights and loud
     music, are America's youth rebelling in a new and dangerous way,
     including the widespread use of drugs? Lynn Sherr reports on ABC
     News "20/20," FRIDAY, JAN. 24 (10:00-11:00 p.m., ET), on the ABC
     Television Network.

     Raves, which are not supervised by adults, take place throughout the
     country, including large cities and small towns, in farm fields and
     abandoned warehouses or in after-hour bars or clubs. Young people
     find out about the events through a network of secret passwords and
     Internet communications. Because raves have become a haven for
     drug-taking with a dance beat, organizers are determined to keep them
     underground, far from the prying eyes of police and parents.

     "If you go to a rave and you're not on Ecstasy or some other kind of
     drug," a former "raver" explains, "then you kind of stick out like a=
 sore
     thumb. You're.... you're an endangered species."

     In addition to Ecstasy, an amphetamine-like drug which helps
     party-goers stay up all night and dance, ravers take LSD or acid, an
     hallucinogenic drug, and Special K (ketamine), an animal anesthetic
     which is snorted by users. Dr. David McDowell, a psychiatrist who has
     studied ravers=ED drug use at the scene, says that not only are an=
 alarming
     number of participants using them but they are often taking several at
     the same time.=20

     "Over seventy percent of the kids said they were on drugs," Dr.
     McDowell said. "The peer pressure to take these drugs in this
     environment is just profoundly strong. Many of these drugs are
     addicting and many of them have terrible side effects and can lead to
     tremendous devastation, both personally and biologically down the
     road."=20

     For college student Sandy Montesi, who attended a 1992 rave in
     Orlando, Florida, the results were fatal and devastating to her family.
     The previously healthy young woman suffered a massive heart attack
     from a temperature which soared to 107 degrees before her death. Her
     mother was told that the temperature was brought on by the drug
     Ecstasy.=20

     After her daughter died, Marsha Montesi learned that the
     establishment which held the rave Sandy attended had been visited by
     police 500 times in the two previous years, often to deal with drug
     activity. Through her grief, she helped enact a local ordinance to=
 close
     such places down and had the dealer who supplied the Ecstasy which
     killed her daughter put in prison for manslaughter.=20

     "We need to stop the raves," Mrs. Montesi says. "It's not a dance,
     it's not a safe place for your kids. Do anything. If your child=
 insists, go
     with them and then you'll find out. Your child doesn't want you there
     because they know what is really going on."=20



                          Also This Week On "20/20":

        Dr. Timothy Johnson reports on the strange and often lonely=20
        world of sexual addiction.=20

        And Deborah Roberts reports on a new movement among overweight=
 people
        which emphasizes fitness and good health over weight loss.=20

Lynn Sherr was the correspodant from 20/20 that did the report.

I could find no e-mail address for any of the Anchor Men/Women or the
Corespondants. I wonder why? ;-\

But if you want, you can go to their "Viewers Voice" section.

http://www.abc.com/vvoice/talk.html

They even have two check boxes. One for 'Rant' one for 'Rave'. Which one
do I pick? :-p

Wow, that was an interesting webpage to read. 
I didn't know that when I went to parties sober, I stuck out like a 
sore thumb! Silly me! I should go do some drugs! 
While I agree that the report had some truths to it, they are only 
half-truths. And the story seems to be laced with misconceptions.

	I think what the problem is, is that 20/20 did not even cover a 
single positive aspect of the scene. They focused on the negativity 
of the scene, which can be avoidable if you're one smart cat. 
However, as a somewhat-aspiring journalist, I know that any good 
reporter would cover all aspects of a story. POOR journalism is what 
it's called when a reporter fails to see other aspects. YELLOW 
journalism is what it's called when some aspects are ignored 
purposefully in order to make a juicy story. This is a disrespectable 
thing (supposedly) in journalism of any type. What we see in this 
20/20 report of raves is either POOR or YELLOW journalism. DID they 
actually see the vibe? We don't know that. Although it would be 
refreshing to say "damn them, they ignored all the good aspects," 
what if the rave they went to really WAS a drugfest (sad, but true, 
that's what SOME raves have become for many kids). 
	I agree with SDream that if we don't want to be exposed, then 
we shouldn't have anything to hide. But, I also agree that the 
exposing of the rave scene in the light of the media is entirely 
negative, and they ignore any positivity that comes out of the 
scene. ALSO, they DO (as one other pointed out) attract kids -- if 
you remember the Leeza way back, they were talking about how it's the 
new way kids rebel, and it's the place anyone can do whatever they 
want, etc. Kids are gonna go "woah! drugfest 97! I'M THERE!" and it's 
already begun to happen, and it's going to KEEP happening as long as 
shows like 20/20 and Leeza keep pumping out this yellow journalism.
	As someone I forget once said, "if you tell the same lie over 
and over again and long enough, the lie often ends up the truth."
	So the way I see it, the more the media portrays the rave 
scene as a drug-scene full of kids lacking responsibility, self 
respect and angst, that's how it's going to end up. Just go to a 
massive one of these days, you'll see that it's happening already. 

Well, aside from the wonderful show we all get to tape/watch tomorrow 
night, I hope you all have a wonderful weekend and hope to see some 
of you at Galactic Tunnel ! :)
Love and Hugs,
LAra

I want to send in my 2 cents to 20/20.  I want to let them know how much 
they are misrepresenting what I think a rave is all about.  

Maybe if enough of us say something they will listen?

(yeah right, but it's worth a try- besides then our anger and frustration 
can at least be directed positively....)

so somebody serf the net and figure out where we could send some 
letters..(I'd do it myself but I'm kind of illiterate when it comes to 
the web.)

Gaiamind will have several excellent jungle dj's in addition to numerous
live acts - but on top of that, it's an event for two very good causes --
a benefit to save the old-growth Headwaters Forest, and a celebration of
today's global meditation for Mother Earth.  All that for $7.

[TRR] - Totally Rave Related

I have already sent 2 letters to 20/20 thru their website.  Everyone should
visit
http://www.abc.com/vvoice/talk.html and give them your opinions about this
topic.  Hopefully they will read it and get our side of the story.  If you
are really involved in our scene and want to contribute something for its
well-being now is the time!  Make sure you give them both the positive and
the negative aspects.  

This 20/20 feature will definately affect our scene.  Parents and law
enforcement people will watch this show and if we miss this oportunity to
tell them what we think they will pursue on shutting us down.  

For those of you on other raver mailing lists please forward this message to
them. And also ell your friends who have web access to do too.  Let's get
the word out.  For our sake........

PLUR,

> I'd also like see the methodology by which they obtained the hypothesis
> that 70% of ravers are on drugs at any given party.

I have plenty to say on this topic and no time here at work, so I'll keep 
my comments to this:

Would they take their cameras to a bar and exclaim in shock, "70% of 
people in the bar admitted to drinking alcohol?!"  Ridiculous, right?  OF 
COURSE people are partying at a bar - that's its purpose.

Yes, a lot of people at a rave are in a non-sober state - just like any
other partiers, teenage or otherwise.  People (it seems naturally) seek to
alter their consciousness periodically, for play (ain't it great?!). 
Every weekend, most people who are at a party, a bar, a club, even
restaurants and their own homes are ingesting something - usually the 
notoriously dangerous drug, alcohol. 

At rave parties, there are simply different types of intoxicants than in
other party scenes.  So what's the difference?  Well, one is that the
entire purpose of a rave does not revolve around the intoxicant, unlike
most college parties and bars/clubs. 

Oh, the other difference: the drug alcohol is legal, other drugs are not. 
And therefore, by some specious logic, other drugs - and raves -
categorically evil.  (A very simple mindset - what is illegal is BAD, what
is legal is GOOD, no independent or rational thought will be tolerated). 

Yes, I usually do drugs at parties.  But you know what?  Tonight I'm 
going to a bar and I'm going to drink alcohol.  Why is one so wrong 
the other considered "normal" behavior??  ESPECIALLY when alcohol is so 
much more dangerous than any of these other drugs??  Is our culture 
at all capable of rationality??!

And the topic of drug prohibition, mainstream hysteria and straight-out 
alcohol hypocrisy to be continued later,

Nancy

OH MY GOD.  Worse than I had imagined.

I can't believe the lies they're perpetrating.  All in the name of 
ratings?  It's really disgusting.  Yes, E is a horribly addictive drug 
that leads either to death or personal ruination.  Oh yeah, raving is not 
about dancing or music, it is simply a haven for strung-out little kids 
to compulsively ingest these drugs until they die.  

Call in the army.  This plague must be stopped!  For the children!

But I agree that perhaps the worst direct effect on our scene are all the 
people who see 20/20 and go "COOL!  Just what I was looking for."  How 
are the new ravers to KNOW about what we are trying to create?  There are 
no handbooks, and a lot of old-skoolers have disappeared...

I have wanted to write of this for a while, and don't have the time to do 
it justice now.  But how are the newbies to learn that this is more than 
a party/dance scene?  The problem is, it's cool just on those merits, and 
people are happy to do some speed and dance all night, but it could be so 
much more...

later,
N

Forget rumors about somebody owing somebody money.

What happened here is a CRIME - it's called ASSAULT!! And Liquid and 
anyone else who saw it is a WITNESS.  

It sounds like a very vicious attack.  No-one deserves mob justice like 
this.  

This is violent and disgusting and should not be excused as "oh well, he 
owed some money."

>From the sound of it, these security guys are violent assholes and should 
have nothing to do with our scene (but that's up to Ghostribe 
Productions, isn't it).  In fact, for assault, they should be in jail.

	I just gave them a piece of my mind...  about how they're ruining a 
beautiful thing, and creating the evil they're depicting, and how disappointed I 
am in BabaWawa (just senility I guess).

	And I got to thinking...  since the show hasn't aired yet, and they have 
over 24hrs to read the responses to their blurb...  it could actually have an 
effect by airtime!  Like, a minute to say there might be another side to the 
story.  If they can fit OJ's little ride into the evening, they can fit one 
minute for fairness...

	I don't seriously expect this to happen tomorrow, but maybe within the 
year that kind of advance interaction with the broadcast media will be real...

Andrew

PS Then again, if the response is *really* overwhelming...

 [TRR] - Totally Rave Related
 
 I have already sent 2 letters to 20/20 thru their website.  Everyone should
 visit
 http://www.abc.com/vvoice/talk.html and give them your opinions about this
 topic.  Hopefully they will read it and get our side of the story.  If you
 are really involved in our scene and want to contribute something for its
 well-being now is the time!  Make sure you give them both the positive and
 the negative aspects.  
 
 This 20/20 feature will definately affect our scene.  Parents and law
 enforcement people will watch this show and if we miss this oportunity to
 tell them what we think they will pursue on shutting us down.  
 
 For those of you on other raver mailing lists please forward this message to
 them. And also ell your friends who have web access to do too.  Let's get
 the word out.  For our sake........
 
 PLUR,
 Anthony E >>
    
      i agree with anthony. if we want people to understand our scene, then
it is up to us to educate them about it. we can no longer sit by while the
media represents us a a bunch of tweaked out dancing little kids. 
     now is the time for us to forget all of our quarrels in regards to
underground parties vs. massives and do what is right for the whole scene.
the negative backlash from this report is going to affect all of us.   
     sitting around complaining about ignorance in regards to our scene won't
help our cause. get involved and make sure that abc and anyone else who is
uninformed about our culture hears your voice. 

PLUR,
dorena

hello, everyone.  i just opened my email after not checking it cause the 
storm had us trying to log in from any available terminal, but to no 
avail.  

i had 173 messages from you guys.  approximately 40% of them were about 
this 20/20 thing.  

i think a lot of us ravers seem to understand that TV is an addictive 
drug perhaps far worse than substances we shoot and otherwise insert into 
our bodies.  did you KNOW that the average American watches 8 1/2 hours 
of television a DAY?  that means someone is watching 16, because i don't 
watch very much at all.  it is hard to get me away from a good star trek 
episode, but that's about it.  NOW TO THE 20/20 EXPOSE...

some of you may know that i work with equinox, a network company that 
sells environmentally conscious products.  some of you may have worked 
for this company.  i don't know.  but what i do know is 20/20 did a story 
on them, and chose to show only the negative light just like this!  i 
thought some of you might be interested in knowing this.  however, the 
founder of the company, mr. gouldd did his own TV show...and he 
broadcasted it on his own private satellite network.  i throw this out 
there, because hopefully if i can reach one or two ravers out there that 
happen to be financially well off, this is a perfect kind of thing to do 
about raves, as well!  Can you imagine, systematically taking apart John 
Stosle, Hugh Downs, and Barbara Wawa (or whatever the hell her name is) 
and somehow distributing it?  this is good incentive for more people to 
find a way to get the money issue out of their lives so we can tackle 
issues like this in the most powerful way.  find out what your dream is 
and how you can accomplish it and do it so you can be the best possible 
contribution to the scene.  

i urge you.  

we need more promoters.  we need more promoters.  we need more promoters.
love, deepfog

hey everyone,

     i just finished reading that bullshit 20/20 report and i am livid. i
shouldn't be too surprised, because our scene is never portrayed in a
positive light. 
     i didn't realize that by staying sober at a party that "i stick out like
a sore thumb". silly me, my drug addled brain had me believing that i party
because i love the music, i love to dance, and i love the people. i didn't
realize that i've been raving all this time because i like to get f*cked up
on drugs and have sex with a lot of guys.
       i also find it really funny that the same media that is portraying us
as tweaked out little kids were the same people who attended the first
woodstock. IMHO ex-hippies are hypocrites, that's what hippie means. back in
their day they were out doing acid that is 20 times stronger than the acid we
have today, they were in the habit of practicing unprotected "free love", and
they were rebelling against everything. all they wanted was for people to
understand that times were changing. today, they are treating us the same way
that the authority figures treated them.
     instead of busting criminals, cops are out on the streets busting up
parties where kids are having a good time. we can't even meet in a place to
dance without being hassled. it's time for us to do something about it.
     hopefully a lot of you feel the same way i do. it's time for us to start
educating people on the power of music and the power of our scene. express
your opinions to ABC and 20/20 and get involved in anything that will help
our movement.

PLUR,
dorena

I came up with this after reading 20/20 report at:
http://www.abc.com/primetime1/twenty/012497.html

Q. How many ravers does it take to screw in a lightbulb?

A. Probably only 100, but 20/20 will say thousands of pre-teens were
smokin' out    of it.

I was talking to a few friends and here are a few ideas we came up with:

1) Inform all our party-going friends about the 20/20 show and 
encourage them to watch it and spread the word, and write to 20/20 in response.

2) get on all the other rave-related lists (try the regional 
hyperreal lists) and tell them to do the same

3) start a petition (this is what we're doing) that demands that 
20/20 do a segment on the positive aspects of parties and spread the 
petitions around.

4) do what deepfog said and make a tv show and somehow get it on tv 
showing the positive aspects of raves.

	. . . anyone else agree/ up for it?:))
Peace, Love and Hugs,
LAra

Have To Say It ~

We saw the explosion of the Rave scene coming, now do something
constructive about it:

email 20/20 right now!  
http://www.abc.com/vvoice/talk.html
Let them know how wrong they are and do it in an intelligent manner - I
know it's hard to keep in but don't get all crazed on them.  

My .02c commented on how raves, similar to the Internet, are positively
bringing together people of various cultural backgrounds (raving IS
worldwide) (Oh that's right, I forgot how evil the Internet is with all
this freedom of speech ;) )

Hopefully if enough people comment prior to the airing, they may make a
follow-up statment (although we all know how doubtful those are - they
wouldn't want to make themselves look like they didn't do a professional
job).  If they don't, there are alot of people connnected through the
rave community - boycott?

On the otherhand, another reason why I think UGs are gonna kick in '97 -
to quote what I said back in '96 - "...THATS WHY CORPORATE RAVES SUCK.
Corporates are the death of raves." Sorry.

The problem I find with the quick-mix and long-overlay-mix styles both
is that they're both good hammers, and the people who learn to use them
think every record is thereby like a nail.  As a *dance* music DJ who
started in that cradle of the house groove, the SF warehouse rave, 
I naturally tend toward the long-overlay type of mix.  But I too have
done the rounds and seen what can be done otherwise.  

If anything, I think every style suffers now from DJs trying to either
suffocate their records in extra-long mixes, or trying (and often failing)
to impress with various mixer tricks.  

If you watch those who really know what to do with the mixer tricks,
you'll notice how little is actually done, but when it happens it's
aligned with the *music*.  Mark Farina gives consistent clinics in how
to do mixing tricks without overdoing it.  Even then, you can see that
hours and hours of practice go into figuring out what works and making
it dead-on-solid.

Rather than be mad about the misrepresentation of a scene that means
no harm, I decided to write abc televison.

This is what I wrote.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

	This Friday, a 20/20 episode "about" raves will air. I have 
read the commentary on what the show is about, and am very
displeased with the intense lack of professionalism in the
reporting of what goes on that these celebrations of life,
some call raves.
	A rave in itself is a gathering of like-minded people who -
in an age of destruction and war - decide to dispense their 
energies in a much more positive way. There are no restrictions
as to who can enter these parties, you may be 15 and you may be
85- as I have seen ages anywhere in between, you may be black,
white, indian, hispanic - ALL races, nationalities, and creeds are
accepted here. Discrimination is  very real, very destructive, and
very opressing. We as ravers through out any prejudices that may
exist outside of the gates of our raves. There are many languages 
in the world, none of us know them all. There is one language
that comes from vibrations, rather than sounds. We gather as a collective 
to listen to this language that transcends all barriers, called "music". 
	With a language that is understood by all, a language that
spans many meanings, and can be more artistic and beautiful than any 
otherlanguage yet to be heard,  begins the unification of everyone
attending a rave. 
Music is a pure source of energy, unifying all, and is a key step into the
breaking down of walls that many people learn to build as a "shield" to 
protect them from all of the violence, the hurt, and the evils of our world.
	As in any aspect of life, whether it be the slum in the city,	
 the Doctors that perform surgeries, the families in the churches, anywhere
that there is a collective of people, there will be those that
are not there for the right reasons. Drug use / abuse exists in every culture
since near the dawn of civilization. The rave scene in itself is a
civilization,
a collective of people who are not immune to self destructive behaviour, 
including drug use / abuse. Although we do not condone drugs  at raves, 
we do not look down on those who use them (once again, discrimination is  a
barrier we are attempting to destroy). Rather than demote and outcast these
people, we choose an attempt to educate them, in hopes that they will choose 
to do what is best for their health, and their mentality.
	Raves are a place that "ravers" go to celebrate their
differences from the world we live in, where we gather to release our energies
as a positive vibe that will uplift the human spirit, and in turn, our lives 
outside of the raves become more enjoyable. Many people in the world,
especially
youth, have an immense supply of energy. A lot of people know not of a way
to release
this energy, which is bottled until it blows (i.e. FIGHTS!). This is why we
can have a 
gathering of 2000-3000 people, and not a single fight, but you will see
people meeting 
for the first time with a smile and a hug, a peace offering in the form of
candy, 
and a lot of other happenings that can only make you smile,  feel warm and
loved.
A rave is proof that this world is NOT entirely composed of wicked and evil
people, 
but that there is a collective  that promote Peace, Love, Unity, and Respect.

ON A FINAL NOTE:
	Contrary to the 20/20 report, raves are not in any way meant to
be a "drug-fest", or to allow children to run rampant. Many teens do not 
understand the true meaning of a rave, but only hear of what a rave is like
from uneducated, biased television programs, which prompt parents into 
the words "NO RAVES! If I ever find out..."  which we all know (after all,
we were 
once children too) is a red flag stating "want to do something bad? go to a
rave!"
And the curiosity will send the child there, with no facts on what a rave is, 
prompting even more trouble. Parents have custody of children under the 
age of 18, and should watch over them. The fact that they are at raves is not 
the fault of the raves, but of the parents, who should be knowledgable of
where 
their children are. 

-sending you all much love
-Justin Gillard

well, all i can say about GaiaMind last night was that IT WENT OFF.
the jungle/drum'n'bass in the dance area was some of the hardest jungle
i've heard in a long time.  mad props go out to DJ Flux and StarEyes whose
set (11:30-12:30?) sent the whole place into a mad, frenetic euphoria.  the
place was filled with different types of people coming together for a good
cause -- to save the Headwaters Forest.  there was also some live acts in
the main room and tons of artwork on the walls (since this was held at an
art gallery).  i apologize if this review seems a bit one-sided but i only
stayed 'til 1:30 because i had to go work early the next day...maybe
someone out there can give a more definitive review of GaiaMind than me.

also, xtra mad props goes out to nancy for organizing Boozers II last
night.  thanx for the brew Colin.  i'll have to get you back on the next
Boozers.  hope everyone had a GREAT time last night...

I had been monitoring the long range weather forcast for several days. It
seemed like there was a chance, a small chance, that the rain would let up
and it would clear for one night, maybe just a few hours. But this time
yesterday morning, it didn't look like it. As the day progresses, it
continued to drisle, rain and mist.  It doesn't look good I started telling
people.  Then around 5 p.m. the weather broke, by 7 p.m. the concrete was
dry and there was a PHAT Moon up in the sky, beconing us to come out into
the moon light. All of the sound systems that I called didn't want to risk
the rain.  Finally around 8:30 Carlos called, he found a sound system, but
it was in San Jose, 50 miles south, but they'll bring it up!?  OK IT'S ON!
Don't forget to bring your records!
This time everything worked right, tune into GaiaMind and you can't go
wrong on this most auspicious day of days. When I got to The Stick around
12:30, everything was set up and carlos was spinning, It was small and
cozy, about 20 people, a fire and a small but nice sound system.  We
exchanged hugs and smiles. The spot was right nexttto the water,  The
ground was too wet to sit on but there were picknic tables and milk crates,
and besides, we're here to dance! Carlos spun latin house, techno, salsa
techno. He told me I wold go on at 3:30. Wow the circle is complete, from
stumbling into my first FMR almost
6 years ago, to dancing madly infront of the speaker, to parking cars, now
getting behind the decks and playing, even if it is only for 25 people, it
is still an honor.  It doesn't matter how many people come to the FMR, what
matters is that it happens, it is an offering to before the altar of Mother
Earth. An acknowledgement of our connection with her. And we give the thing
that is so precious to many of us, the gift of House Music, a unifying
force that is understood by all. And the mother accepted our gift last
night, she held back her tears, and allowed her children to dance
underneath her sister's shimmering light.  And dance we did. Playing under
the moon is not like playing in a club or in your bedroom.  You can draw
down the energy from above...
if you know how.  last night was magical in many ways, it was the first FMR
of this year. The first FMR in many months that follows in the tradition of
the Wicked FMR of years past.  Indeed two brothers from Poland were there,
they had attended the very first FMR at baker beach 6 years ago, here they
were again, a good omen.  The six pointed do-hicky in the sky blazed above
us, as I rocked tribal beats below.  Tracy shows up at 4 am to rock the
place. People shared coffee, candy, cigaretts and shrooms, weed and a
little wine, family once again.  For some it was their first and there were
some old skoolers in the house as well. Hats off to all who helped to make
it happen. It's our intention to continue the tradition, it seems the torch
has passed to us, may we share in the carrying of the torch and may it
shile bright for a long time.


				Pray to the Moon
				When She is Rounde
				Luck with you
				Shall then abounde
				What ever you seek for
				Shall be founde
				In Sea, or Sky, or Solid Grounde

See you on the dancefloor.

I must say, I can't get enough of Jungle...  (I'm sure everyone who knows
me is mumbling something under their breath right now =))

Whatever you all did last night I hope it was good...

Rich tore the place up at "Jungle Love".  That guy had me moving on 3hrs of
sleep, and I think I hurt myself.  But thats Jungle for you.  He played
some really good dark/hard step'n jungle.  He is definitely one of my
fav's.  If you all get a chance, and jungle is your thang, check him out!!!

SiFu kicked some butt.

Madame was good, lots of swirly breaks between transitions, but good.

Jenn and I left about 12:30ish right when they started getting crazy with
the fog machine. **choke**  So I didn't see Jamal-Ski or Flux.  I'm sure
Flux tore the shit up though.

The Troc is the Troc so I won't say nothing.  Except for the two "HUGE"
stamps I had to steel wool off my hand and wrist.  What up wit dat!  But
you can't argue with paying only $5.

Just thought I would let you all know.  Especially the ones that didn't go,
you missed out... =p

Siphon!

Boozers 2, the Review (hey, that rhymes!)

Quite a crowd turned out, compared to last time!  What's up to: Black 
Adder, Branka, Micron, Zza, Rob J, Jonathan, Eric (*not* Eric Peterson, 
*not* Eric Dunkelberger, *not* 250 BlowPop Eric, "just Eric")`, Paulie, 
Kolin, and the famous Derek Chung (who's half-responsible for this monster 
called SFR).  Thanks for coming!!

The Cadillac Bar turned out to be a cheesy choice, but at least our crowd 
of SFRavers stuck out like a sore thumb (much like a sober person at a 
rave!).  A private corporate party took over the large front room (!), 
so we were shunted to the back "for dinner."  So we took over a big 
table, munched on free salsa and chips, and ordered nothin' but drinks.  
Our rather sedate table was completely overshadowed, though, by a rowdy 
crowd of middle-age partiers next to us, downing tequila shooters and 
howling and screaming.  (*Jeez*, and I thought strung-out teens at 
all-night drugfests were bad!)

We parted ways at 11 to drive to Gaiamind in our separate cars, and I got 
in mine only to find my tempermental starter decided to conk out again!  
After a visit from Mr. Tow Guy, it was apparent I was driving nowhere but 
straight home.  I had been REALLY excited about Gaiamind, and had just 
convinced the whole Boozers crowd to go, so the night ended on a 
disappointing note for me.  I consoled myself by dancing to a mixtape at 
home, but it just ain't the same...

All-in-all, a nice time meeting new people.  And to all the other 
boozehounds out there, see ya next time!

It being a Thursday, and having to be at work bright and shiny everyday at 
7:30, I knew from the start that the night  wasn't going to be a long one.  But 
after meditating for awhile, with the global alignment occuring "up there"  and 
then after awhile reading about the significance of the event on Gaiamind's 
webiste, I knew I had to make it to this. The karma was right.

Got there around 10:30 after stopping off at 11 (restaurant) for a bit. That's 
an unusual scene - suave rapsters and hip-hopsters, decked out to the max. 
Anywho, the place was very easy to find, and except for the muddy road to 
devotion, was refreshingly open and airy with huge ceilings, an art gallery 
portion, a stage with theatre seats at the opposite end of the dance floor, 
slides of Burning Man and the Headwaters Forest crew, several intricate 
shrines, and really friendly, cool, concerned staff.   

The crowd was just what I love to see: a little bit of everything.  We had the 
older, original  hippies, the new generation of deadheads/phishheads, a lot of 
funksters, many technobabies, several scenesters, various junglists, etc. ,  
The band that played was interesting,and it was great to sit in the theatre 
seats and 420 it while listening. The middle chill room had some great black 
light stuff.  But the real action was to be found in the far back room.  Here, 
massive jungle/drum&bass attacks were felt for hours. The sound system was 
superb, with nice, fuzzy basswaves giving me a massage. This is what makes me 
love jungle!

Anywho, had to skedaddle around 2:30 or so so today wouldn't be hell.  For 
those people I met, I was the white dude with black hair with silver vinyl 
pants and a blue velour shirt (just had to wear the vinyl after reading the 
posts yesterday. My accomplice in crime chose latex.  We were ready for the  
wet weather!)

Adios,
Nathan

Good Morning SF,

Gaiamind- Well, I went to it.  Saw people I knew.  Couldn't get away
from the speakers in the drum'n'bass room. Danced a bunch.  Caught good
vibes.  Review due on Monday... 

Only thing I have to say is, allthough the chill room made an excellent
buffer btwn the two dance floors, it sounded like an Amtrack railway
station....  All I could hear was the beats bleeding through from the
other rooms...  

C-U @ GT tonite....

(Ugh, & I have to go to WORK tomorrow  >=P )

The blossoming of consciousness is in some ways a recognition of the 
group/
individual consciousness that tribes all over the world have been feeling
for the past several years. the age of Aquarius which we started to
transition into last year is for the first time getting felt by the global
population. in the next few weeks, expect things to keep on clicking as
more Grand alignments occur.  it's going to be a magical, bumpy, ride...

Heyyy,

So I'm mistaken...  The 20/20 report is on college Frat parties, not
raves.  I get it now....

Yes, it's true - Jungle Love went OFF last night!!!  Turntable madness from
a.r.m. assassins Sifu and Rich: Sifu tore it up despite having to replace a
faulty turntable mid-set... Rich played a amazing long set of the darkest,
hardest jungle I have yet to hear in SF, taking us all on a rollercoaster
ride through Hades and back again.  Stareyes made a surprise appearance,
for all the heads who were so eagerly anticipating the dubplates she
brought back from London... she spun a smooth set of way new jump-up with
loads of wobbly basslines, just the way I like it.  Flux took the tables
next, to show all SF junglists how it should be done.  Props to Flux for
kicking a fever to make it out and spin.  Unfortunately, I missed Madame's
set, but I hear she threw down as well.

Special thanks to Ed, the lighting guy, who took my recommendation and
chilled out on those annoying flashing strobe-like thingies... and also
thanks to all the heads who turned out to make this a great club!  The
energy surrounding this scene is so thick you could cut it with a knife!

If you're not in the mood to travel elsewhere tonight in the rain, there's a 
basic college party happening at my house.


Castro Co-op
70's/funk/hip-hop/house dj
lotta kegs
9PM - 1AM

I think we have the distinction of being the first big party of the 
semester in B-Town!

Hopefully see some of you there :)

I guess I can see that, but I don't view raves as a chance to "open my mind
to the inner universal galactic consciousness" or anything like that, (I'm
not trying to be snotty, just a little skeptical) I go because they're bomb
parties and I like to be surrounded by... uh...... "ravers."

yeah.

It's hard to explain... I suppose raving gives you whatever you put into
it. "Garbage in Garbage out" applies here as well as the usual happy-vibe
stuff. I don't try to put any kind of spiritual spin on the parties I
attend so I don't get any back.

Patrick said you were at GaiaMind last night, but I didn't see you there.

take care,

What ever happened to that Rave Documentry that was being made? I
haven't hear much about when it's gonig to be released, or who is making
it.

Something like that would be great material to point at. Provied it's
done in a positive context.

I know I'm making a bold request for San Francisco, but... 

Are there any hardcore/gabber DJ's out there in SFR land? Some friends
(from the midwest, no less!) and I were talking about the idea of
having a hardcore party, so if you know anyone who fits the bill, drop
me a line...

hardcore. grrr. >:)

Hah!!   Just what I did,  when Steve Knopper whote that shitty article
on me in Internet Underground.  First off,  I agreed to be interviewed if
he published my URL..   He did,  and now after getting tons of Email on
how poorly he represented me,  I published a rebuttal.   I fugured at
least 80% who read that article also read my rebuttal I published on my
WEB pages,  blowing apart Steve's article,   pointing out the many things
he skipped over and did NOT mention,   explaining to people that he
was careless in transcribing the interview which was put on tape,   making
him the fool he is.

I say,  that if any self respecting raver ever goes on camera for ANY
reason,   get the producer to agree to publish your or our web site as
a condition for going on camera.   Most media mongers would agree to this.

Then,   if anything is said to mis-represent our scene,   we can put up
a rebuttal on our web page.    Just a thought...   Score one for the WWW
and it's amazing ability for self publishing.    Just make sure the server
is capable of handling all the hits....    :-)

  Geekonics
  By John Woestendiek
  Philadelphia Inquirer
  Wed., January 8, 1997

  NEWS BULLETIN: Saying it will improve the education of children who
  have grown up immersed in computer lingo, the school board in San
  Jose, Calif., has officially designated computer English, or
  "Geekonics", as a second language.

  The historic vote on Geekonics -- a combination of the word "geek"
  and the word "phonics" -- came just weeks after the Oakland school
  board recognized black English, or Ebonics, as a distinct language.

  "This entirely reconfigures our parameters," Milton 'Floppy'
  Macintosh, chairman of Geekonics Unlimited, said after the school
  board became the first in the nation to recognize Geekonics.

  "No longer are we preformatted for failure," Macintosh said during a
  celebration that saw many Geekonics backers come dangerously close
  to smiling. "Today, we are rebooting, implementing a program to
  process the data we need to interface with all units of humanity."

  Controversial and widely misunderstood, the Geekonics movement was
  spawned in California's Silicon Valley, where many children have
  grown up in households headed by computer technicians, programmers,
  engineers and scientists who have lost ability to speak plain
  English and have inadvertently passed on their high-tech vernacular
  to their children.

  HELPING THE TRANSITION

  While schools will not teach the language, increased teacher
  awareness of Geekonics, proponents say, will help children make the
  transition to standard English. Those students, in turn, could
  possibly help their parents learn to speak in a manner that would
  lead listeners to believe that they have actual blood coursing
  through their veins.

  "Bit by bit, byte by byte, with the proper system development, with
  nonpreemptive multitasking, I see no reason why we can't download
  the data we need to modulate our oral output," Macintosh said.

  The designation of Ebonics and Geekonics as languages reflects a
  growing awareness of our nation's lingual diversity, experts say.

  Other groups pushing for their own languages and/or vernaculars to
  be declared official viewed the Geekonics vote as a step in the
  right direction.

  "This is just, like, OK, you know, the most totally kewl thing,
  like, ever," said Jennifer Notat-Albright, chairwoman of the
  Committee for the Advancement of Valleyonics, headquartered in
  Southern California. "I mean, like, you know?" she added.

  THEY'RE HAPPY IN DIXIE

  "Yeee-hah," said Buford "Kudzu" Davis, president of the Dixionics
  Coalition. "Y'all gotta know I'm as happy as a tick on a sleeping
  bloodhound about this."

  Spokesmen for several subchapters of Dixionics -- including
  Alabonics, Tennesonics and Louisionics -- also said they approved of
  the decision.

  Bill Flack, public information officer for the Blue Ribbon Task
  Force on Bureaucratonics said that his organization would not
  comment on the San Jose vote until it convened a summit meeting,
  studied the impact, assessed the feasibility, finalized a report and
  drafted a comprehensive action plan, which, once it clears the
  appropriate subcommittees and is voted on, will be made public to
  those who submit the proper information-request forms.

  Proponents of Ebonics heartily endorsed the designation of Geekonics
  as an official language.

  Those involved in the lingual diversity movement believe that only
  by enacting many different English languages, in addition to all the
  foreign ones practiced here, can we all end up happily speaking the
  same boring one, becoming a nation that is both unified in its
  diversity, and diversified in its unity.

  Others say that makes no sense at all. In any language.

  But wait,  there's more!:

              Irish-American Speak -- Leprechaunics

              Native-American Speak -- Kimosabics

              Italo-American Speak -- Spumonics (or Rigatonics)

              Chinese-American Speak -- Won-tonics

              Japanese-American Speak -- Mama-san-ics

              Polish-American Speak -- Kielbasanics

              Jewish-American Speak -- Zionics

              Russian-American Speak -- Rasputonics

              Spanish-American Speak -- Flan-ics

              Scottish-American Speak -- Tartan-ics

              Eskimo-American Speak -- Harpoonics

              German-American Speak -- Autobaunics (or Teutonics)

              French-American Speak -- Cornichonics (or Escargonics)

              Oakland-School-Board Speak -- Moronics

One good DJ (Demigod) who origionally is in SF, but he always spins in LA,
because hardcore raves are rare as hens teeth in SF.    They (hardcore raves)
always take place in the Southland.    So if you want Hardcore,    see
Ron D Core and Demigod....

I'm also a hardcore fan....   get plenty of it down here....   :-)

So much energy for a Thurs! LOTS of fun people.  My analysis: astrologers
and nature freaks and dance cravers were prevalent.  People weren't all too
high to communicate. Really liked the spacious, friendly, uncrowded feeling
there. 

Surprise: great music, seeing some old friends with new dance moves.  In the
smaller room, excellent DJ "tag team" which really built and delivered solid
dance rythm with variety.  Good that you could see everywhere, it wasn't too
dark.  

Ok, so you get the idea...this was a good time for me and about 100 friends
and another 200 aquaintences.  just too bad about that parking tkt.(as
usual).  What!  You expect me to actually read the signs!

See ya at the next one.   XO  Rhoda

Absoutely....  It kees the press on their toes,   forces them to report
truthfully,  because if they don't,   you can put up a rebuttal and
further explain and put things in perspective.

I've got an amazing amount of good positive mail from those people who've
read my IU rebuttal on my site.    Some have resulted in jobs...    And
once I put that up,   I was getting real positive mail....    IN fact,
the Internet Underground actually Published my rebuttal....    :-)
Primarily,  because I asked each person who mailed me to write to the
magazine,  expresseing their dislike and bias that Steve reported in
the article.   So there *IS* a way to fight back against the media mongers.

Hey there!
  Anyone reading this probably already has a good intention of helping me
out.  So, I'll cut right to it.  I live within walking distance of SJSU and
would really, very much like to do some hard dancing tonight with some
brilliant smiling faces.  If San Jose is on your way, please come pick me
up.  I'm alone, and although I'm tall and take up a lot of space in most
cars, I do come with gum and a can of Kerns fruit juice ("Pear Nectar") :) .
Terms and conditions of transport naturally are yours, but I can be ready at
any time tonight and come back whenever is convenient to you.  If possible,
please call Eric at 408.998.0581.  Thank you.  ;)

Dear all,
The new Richard.H.Kirk CD is now out entitlted "Step White Run-Alphaphone
Vol.1."  Side one is contains some absoloutly blinding ambient techno
while side two is a bit more harder.  Quite simply the best new music you
are likely to hear bar none.  Alex Patterson eat your heart out is what I
say.
See ya!
Tristan.

can return to sf to witness his amazing abilities in person once again.
the man is a god at those turntables, imho. but hey, that's just what i
think. and i can't wait to hear my bitch put out again =].  

and as for what raf said earlier...i fully agree! dan is the man. he's the
baddest motherfucker on 2 turntables. but carl cox on 3...and psychobitch
and miss thing on 6 are not to be missed.  those women can hold their own.

Subject: What to do???? ???????
Sender: sfraves-owner@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

         Hey kids. . . I'll most likely go boogie down this weekend cuz I'm
not gonna go boarding unless someone ELSE drives, and it seems as though
racing or even practicing is waaaaaaay out of the question.  I kinda wanna
go today & tomorrow, but I'll see what my buds feel like. Just in case, what
parties will be the coolest. . . I don't mean the fattest, and I don't want
some teenie tinie  greasy funky sweatbox either (but I'm sure that'll
probably be the only option left). 

        Also. . .what do you guys usually do when you're not dancing or at
someone's house? Seems like Camelot park was fairly interesting for a little
while, but only if you had a lot of friends and a couple of them were
reeeeeaaaaallly drunk. (That was pretty funny:). Mostr of my paycheck's gone
to bills last week and I only have like an ok amount left.

        So any ideas??? 


Thanks. . . you're all such good little kids. . . 

SMILE:)

PS:     Works going pretty well, it really effects your life when your
entire day is taken up and you're basically only home to sleep and shower.
But it makes the weekends that much more important.

time to consult the anarchist's cookbook...
let our new york operatives take care of the biz...


actually, aside from voicing intelligent complaints on their web site,
clogging their phone lines and sending legal mail pranks to their
offices, there's not much to be done... silence usually works the
best... when the temple of psychick youth had allegations of satanic
child abuse thrown at them from a right wing program with an agenda to
bring down rave gatherings and other "psychick rallies", they did
absolutely nothing... laid low, no comments... the press wound up
feeding back on itself... the first day saw right wingers expressing
their horror at it all...  the second and third days saw left wing
outsiders coment on the harshness of it all... how the video footage in
question was simply a short film by prominent film director Derek Jarman
including footage of performance art (a little more extreme than the jim
rose circus side show, but consensual and legal between adults
nine-the-less)... all this information came to light without any
official word from the TOPY camps at all... within a week there were
media critics and all sorts of people of both persuasions coming down on
the news program...  unfortunately for us, because there is such a
saturation of companies, it is difficult to cancel events so we can lay
low... the average rave has at least $10,000 rapped up in it...

> Artists Profiles (in order of appearance):
> 
> Maggi Payne is co-director of the Mills College Center for Contemporary
> Music, where she teaches.  Her music tends to focus with incredible
> attention on sound design and environment, and is often presented with her
> video work. Maggi has performed throughout the US and Europe and has
> released music on Lovely Music, Music and Arts, and Centaur.
> 
> Frank Henriksen is a composer from Norway, whose work exploits the fine
> degree of detail and control available within computer synthesis.  His
> work involves movement and sonic transformation and always takes advantage
> of the possibilities of dispersing sound in space.
> 
> Kent Jollys work brings ideas of composition from the visual arts into the
> audio realm in unprecedented ways.  Using synthesis, especially in
> conjunction with neural networks, Kent presents an elaborate and
> fully-formed vision of sound in ways completely separate from the expected
> in music. 
> 
> A.L. Dentel, aside from being a cornerstone of the 2779 collective, is
> presenting one of her series of 365 Daily Pieces.  While this piece
> involves field recorded sound in both original and transformed states, her
> series has music for a variety of traditional and non-traditional
> instruments.
> 
> Detergent (Chris Palmatier) is a painter and rock guitarist (Jobys
> Opinion) as well as a recording engineer.  A recent Chapel Hill
> ex-patriate, this marks his Bay Area debut.  His sense of rhythm and form
> comes from dance music, his sense of sound design from the studio, and his
> vision from free jazz.
> 
> Michael Berry "spends his time building real-time audio processors on
> computers and then playing with them."   
> 
> Citizen Band "is a collection of three composers (Thomas Day, Xopher

> Conceptual Musik Union (Floyd Diebel) arrives as a representative of the

> 
> dj Cheb i Sabbah is a long-time participant in the Bay Area club scene, an

Well, you may not all know this, but sfraves' own Dave Bayer has been
affectionately given the title "Gabber Dave", and has an infamous reputation
for making people pogo up and down madly at 7am in the ambient room of
several Friends and Family's.  He is very humble about dj-identity, but I'm
sure he would gladly accept the offer to spin at a hardcore party...

His email address is dlb@ocf.berkeley.edu.  (All other hardcore fans take note!)

Dave, are you listening?

it just occurred to me that this show only helps the rave scene grow.  
but it's going to keep growing with unaware people and more unaware 
promoters.  yes, there will also be great dj's, promoters, and parties 
springing up.  but the struggle to find unbustable spaces is going to get 
harder and harder...keep going!  

we need to not focus on this 20/20 thing too long and now spend time 
promoting the positive aspects of raving to the people that hold spaces 
and give permits and such...

after all, ms. wawa tonight said that "15 or 20 deaths in England" from 
raves.  i'd be willing to bet some of those people would have died sooner 
or later with all the drugs some people take.

I just watched the 20/20 show on raves with my mom and one of her
friends.  Afterwards, I started going off on how I wanted to bombard
20/20 with nasty letters.  My mom's friend made the point that journalism
will always be sensational; it's a business.  We couldn't really sue them
for fraud, or anything like that.  He did have a really good suggestion
on how to get heard.

He said that it's not the tv show, nor the producer that we should write
to, but the ADVERTISERS.  We should write to all the companies who
endorsed this show (I know a lot of us taped this episode) and threaten
to boycot their products.  We should tell them we have no respect for
20/20's biased and overly-sensationalized spin on the rave scene.

So, I suggest that we write to all these advertisers and make a point to
explain our scene's positivity.  We've been slandered by the media
(again).  It's time we make an honest effort to bring our side of the
story to light.  We need to let the advertisers know that we don't agree
with 20/20's views, nor will we patronize any company that chooses to
support them.

Is anyone with me on this?

Just finished watching Moment Utopia.  Pretty cool short (30 min) video. Lots 
of nature scenes, a couple good interviews with Native Americans and ravers.  
Some good video work at a Moontribe desert rave. Nothing too inspiring, but 
overall interesting. BTW, does anyone know if Moontribe desert raves still 
exist? Or the history/status of the group? Thanks  Nathan

Hey there all, I for one am for any kind of letter writing effort
against 20/20, because my mom, watched the show tonight, and now because
of it, said never to ask her to go to a rave again! (although, she still
thinks I've been to two...) But still, I had planned on asking her
again. So, I say we do it, and get every raver we know who is on SFraves
or not, to write, fax, or e-mail, them. Um, that's all I have to say
about that.
PLUR,

1)  20/20 sucks.
1.5) some fun soundbytes out of this report though... <Uncle Noah hooks up
the DJ-70 to the VCR...>
2)
Here are some tips if you ever become a subject in one of these rotten TV
shows:
- if someone with a TV camera walks up to you at a party and asks what you
are on, turn and walk away.
- if you are invited to sit with your peers and discuss the scene and the
subject of drugs happens to come up, _DO NOT_ say _anything_ about
'spiking' the beverages of _any_ public official, even a school principal
- if you are asked what illegal drugs are cut with, _do not_ say "Heroin!"
unless you have some kind of proof.  AND if you _do_ have proof that some
stuff is being cut with Heroin, don't take it
- if you look in the mirror and see Hugh Downs, go to a rave and find out
for yorself, okay old timer?
 okay enough of that.

I've been to many 'commercial' 'above ground' concert and dance events.
And you know what?  A lot of them _depend_ on vendors selling alcoholic
beverages to make a good profit.  I've seen drunk folks falling over
chairs, getting into fistfights and (I think this is worst of all)
staggering into their cars and DUI-ing it home.  These events are havens
for drunken violence and sex.  I think that a bunch of raver folks should
do a video 'news report' about these horrible events.  I can see it now,
"Do you know where your parents are?!  They may be at local Karaoke
clubs!"  We could show people drunk and slobbering over a microphone, old
messed up men picking up on someone's mom... it would be a real hoot!

Now, one other thing.  I'd like to know how much that one woman knows
about MDMA toxicology.  I too have looked at quite a bit of data on the
substance and have not seen evidence that it causes people to heat up to
107+ degrees F.  I'd also like to know what motivated the doctor/coroner
to declare MDMA as the cause of death.

i just watched the 20/20 program and it was hilarious...

it seems they must've found a good party with cars from 8 different
states!

the group, obviously handpicked for inarticulation, talking about raves
were classic...  what other gimps would sell their scene out for their
15 minutes of fame...



the most interesting note would of course be the calculated "and they
get their rave information over THE INTERNET"


not only do they want a crack down in the deardrum reality but in
cyberspace as well... am i glad babawawa doesn't have teenagers!


i'd feel sorry for them.


see you when the stormtrooper clear out...

You don't realize it, but 20/20 did all of us a HUGE favor!

Consider them a part of our ecosystem. Now consider the notion of an
ecosystem in balance.

In that balance there are many factors, all pulling at each other, and once
stabilized, the ecosystem finds harmony.

Some of the components that exist our ecosystem could be: Cool new types of
music, fresh attitudes, exciting teachers (i.e. drugs), new places to
celebrate, and new faces to meet. Those are all attractors. Now other
components of our ecosystem could be: negative media coverage, law
enforcement attention, city council resolutions, bad people flooding the
scene, and exploitive greed. Those are detractors. These two sides push and
pull against each other, and, at some point, a balance occurs.

Did any of you out there feel like things have been getting just a little
bit out of control lately? Have parties been just a little too big and out
of control? Are there more and more on the SFR calendar you just couldn't
stomach going to? I sure have been noticing this!

Part of what makes our community great is vibe. Part of what makes the vibe
is dedication. Dedication proves itself when the going gets tough. When the
party's not promoted. When there are wild goose chases to find phone
numbers for elusive info lines. When we're scrambling in the middle of the
night to find the secret map point. To actually find the party and the end
of a long windy road! (I specifically site the Harmony party in the
Milpitas hills a perfect example of that!)

That difficulity in "consuming" parties, in turn, filters out exactly
what's causing the critical stress on our ecosystem! Too many of these "new
school" events are just too accessible. Accessible by anyone that picks up
any number of huge, fold-out multi-page flyers from any one of 10,000
stores, schools, shopping centers, grocery stores, malls, gas stations,
etc. in a multi-hundred mile areas where they have been dumped!

You get my point -- it's just too easy! It's the process of turning a party
from a group of friends around the camp fire into a rock concert!

The simple accessibility of these parties are exactly the thing causes
people-in-mass to jump headfirst into what can be dangerous territory.
These are the parties attracting thousands of people who don't have or know
"rave ideals". Too many of these people being attracted to these parties
are just wanting to go out to find a place to get "fucked up on a Friday
night," and there are too many of them to lead by example!

That kind of mass-adoption for the wrong reason will ultimately dilute the
collective experience, and the magic that is raving. That will dilute our
gene pool!

Parties are not meant to be huge, expensive affairs! For my first six
months of raving, I never even went to a party that had a flyer. These were
parties being planned by friends for their friends. They actually called
and invited each other to the party. It was PURE! It was REAL! I was
adopted into a group of cells, a living organism, that was inspiring. That
was a teacher, that was beautiful. I was able to learn by the example of
the many, and at some point I became one with the cell.

With that in mind, I have to say "Thanks, 20/20 -- thanks for a job well done!"

You have acted as a governor in our ecosystem which, in turn, could be just
the component that enables the longevity of our species.

You've unknowingly helped us with that which we could not do on our own.

You've helped us keep our gene pool true and pure. You've turned the clock
back to where *we* get to choose who and when people should be brought into
our beautiful world, and at what rate, to ensure that the real message of
raving will not be lost on new members. To ensure that people understand
that a rave is not something you pay to attend to be entertained. To ensure
that people trickle in at a rate that they feel involved as a participant,
not as a consumer! You've helped us to hopefully create and sustain an
ecosystem where the boundaries between "promoter", "DJ" and "raver" will
become fuzzy or dissolve, which will allow all of us to hopefully be all
three and more!

Thanks again!

i can't speak for the west coast, but 20/20 will likely do the rave
scene in the east a huge favour by shutting down all the profiteering
shitty big companies who don't give a shit about their clientele...

afterall, if it's underground, they'll never find it... and if they do,
there will be no mindless trendies in sight ruining things for
themselves and others...

	While E itself wouldn't cause that kind of heat, there is
pretty good evidence which suggests that E does screw up your ability 
to notice that you are overheating, if you happen to overheat for some 
other reason. If it was hot in your environment, you might get up to 104 
or so & not feel it if you're E-ing. So you may not take the normal actions 
to cool down that you would without the drug. Check out the E page on 
hyperreal.com for more on this. Anyway, if you're going to do E, please 
stay conscious of your body temperature, especially if you're raving in 
Galactic Sweatlodges or in Florida during the hot humid summer.

I think those people on 20/20 need to smoke a bowl !!!
everybody's young once, except that hag on the show,
next 20/20 topic: "tabloid show hosts born with chastitiy belts"

Trying to stop people from haveing fun is like outlawing sex, there will
always be people doing it, as for drugs, I'm sure if E was as popular back
in 50's or 60's as it is today, these shows would be about unfair treatment
of party goers by police!

You don't realize it, but 20/20 did all of us a HUGE favor!

Consider them a part of our ecosystem. Now consider the notion of an
ecosystem in balance.

In that balance there are many factors, all pulling at each other, and once
stabilized, the ecosystem finds harmony.

Some of the components that exist our ecosystem could be: Cool new types of
music, fresh attitudes, exciting teachers (i.e. drugs), new places to
celebrate, and new faces to meet. Those are all attractors. Now other
components of our ecosystem could be: negative media coverage, law
enforcement attention, city council resolutions, bad people flooding the
scene, and exploitive greed. Those are detractors. These two sides push and
pull against each other, and, at some point, a balance occurs.

Did any of you out there feel like things have been getting just a little
bit out of control lately? Have parties been just a little too big and out
of control? Are there more and more on the SFR calendar you just couldn't
stomach going to? I sure have been noticing this!

Part of what makes our community great is vibe. Part of what makes the vibe
is dedication. Dedication proves itself when the going gets tough. When the
party's not promoted. When there are wild goose chases to find phone
numbers for elusive info lines. When we're scrambling in the middle of the
night to find the secret map point. To actually find the party and the end
of a long windy road! (I specifically site the Harmony party in the
Milpitas hills a perfect example of that!)

That difficulity in "consuming" parties, in turn, filters out exactly
what's causing the critical stress on our ecosystem! Too many of these "new
school" events are just too accessible. Accessible by anyone that picks up
any number of huge, fold-out multi-page flyers from any one of 10,000
stores, schools, shopping centers, grocery stores, malls, gas stations,
etc. in a multi-hundred mile areas where they have been dumped!

You get my point -- it's just too easy! It's the process of turning a party
from a group of friends around the camp fire into a rock concert!

The simple accessibility of these parties are exactly the thing causes
people-in-mass to jump headfirst into what can be dangerous territory.
These are the parties attracting thousands of people who don't have or know
"rave ideals". Too many of these people being attracted to these parties
are just wanting to go out to find a place to get "fucked up on a Friday
night," and there are too many of them to lead by example!

That kind of mass-adoption for the wrong reason will ultimately dilute the
collective experience, and the magic that is raving. That will dilute our
gene pool!

Parties are not meant to be huge, expensive affairs! For my first six
months of raving, I never even went to a party that had a flyer. These were
parties being planned by friends for their friends. They actually called
and invited each other to the party. It was PURE! It was REAL! I was
adopted into a group of cells, a living organism, that was inspiring. That
was a teacher, that was beautiful. I was able to learn by the example of
the many, and at some point I became one with the cell.

With that in mind, I have to say "Thanks, 20/20 -- thanks for a job well done!"

You have acted as a governor in our ecosystem which, in turn, could be just
the component that enables the longevity of our species.

You've unknowingly helped us with that which we could not do on our own.

You've helped us keep our gene pool true and pure. You've turned the clock
back to where *we* get to choose who and when people should be brought into
our beautiful world, and at what rate, to ensure that the real message of
raving will not be lost on new members. To ensure that people understand
that a rave is not something you pay to attend to be entertained. To ensure
that people trickle in at a rate that they feel involved as a participant,
not as a consumer! You've helped us to hopefully create and sustain an
ecosystem where the boundaries between "promoter", "DJ" and "raver" will
become fuzzy or dissolve, which will allow all of us to hopefully be all
three and more!

Thanks again!

the underground

This is definately a good idea!  I do encourage everyone to take their
parents to a party at least one time.  We need the support of these people
to save our scene.

(raises hand)  Yeh,  this sound like a really good idea.  The best way to
get to thesee advertisers is thru the web (as we all know, everyone and
their dog has a webpage).  I only taped the rave part of the show and I
didn't include the commercials.  Can anyone make a list of these
advertisers?  I would like to go off on them as soon as possible.

I can state several occasions where they had false statements. 

1) E solely caused the girl to overheat.  It was the girl's ignorance that
got her there.  If you know how to use E properly you would make sure that
you will have enough liquids and enough rest every once in a while while you
are high.  

2) E is rarely laced with heroin since heroin is already expensive as it is.
The addictive effects of this opiate can only be gained thru intravenous
injection or if you have taken too much of it at one time.  I doubt that
that kind of dose would be present in that kind of preparation.

3) I rarely see Ketamine being used in the dance scene since K will often
immobilize you while you trip on it.  

4) Being sober at a rave doesn't make you stick out like a sore thumb....  I
have raved soberr a lot of times and I don't think I stuck out like a sore
thumb and I do admire people who can enjoy the vibe sober. 

5) 20/20 featured a dance concert not a rave!  There is no such thing as an
underground party being attended by kids from 8 different states.

6) They said that we don't want to take our parents to a rave.  Not true,  I
have friends who have taken their parents to a rave so that both parents and
children could enjoy the vibe.  

>Don't live in denial!

We are not.  The media is pushing on enforcing a ban on raves.  Don't you
see it coming?

I have to agree with you here.  We need to live up to the definition of a
rave.  From the PLUR to being small and underground we need to get back to
the basics, boycott the big party promoters.

E was only around during the late 70's and the popular use of it in the
dance scene was in the 80's.  I really believe that alcohol is far worse of
a substance than MDMA.  According to http://ecstasy.org horseback riding has
a higher death ratio than MDMA use and that the reports of MDMA deaths were
really inconclusive.

Hi,

I agree there were errors in specifics, but don't even bother arguing
specifics. They are communicating with generalizations and you are arguing
specifics.

Yes, they said E caused a body to overheat, etc.

That's not the point. Either are any of the other details, i.e. laced w/
heroin.

What is true is:

	Raves exist.

	They are "secret" places that lots of kids go to do drugs.

	They often last all night.

Your personal experience may vary, as mine does, but the *general*
communication from 20/20 was correct.

Repeat: I am *not* defending yellow journalism, I am merely pointing out
that we have very little to gain by debating what drugs may be used to cut
what drugs and whether the drugs caused a death or not or whatever. Once
20/20 has extablished that you are doing something wrong, you are simply
arguing how much wrong or how little wrong you are doing. You will never
not be wrong. Get it?

The principal but not-quite-actually-spoken issue here is that America is
concerned about a bunch of their future taxpayers are out getting high when
they are supposed to be home in bed so they can get up early and go to
school to learn how to be good worker bees in society when they grow up.
Loved up free thinkers (or dead thinkers, in the case of an OD'ed raver)
are not necessarily good for society. Too many artists and not enough
factory workers, ditch diggers, soldiers and CPAs could damage the status
quo, and, of course, that's not good for the good old U S of A. That's not
my opinion, that's America's opinion.

With that established, for you to then try to deconstruct their concern
with "I am sure there's no heroin in my illegal drugs" you are not even
having the same debate.

That doesn't give them the reason to shut our parties down.

We can do the same way to them but in a different way.

If I wasn't a hardworking member of the society where would I get my money
to go to parties?  I work hard during the weekdays and I pay my taxes and
guess what?  I run my own business and I'm only 19 years old.  It's not even
the federal government that's involved in this, it's the city government
which includes the city council and your local law enforcement agency that
is concerned.  I can't picture Bubba Clinton pushing to fight against raves
the same way they are fighting against narcotics.

I was just proving my point that 20/20 did have a lot of false statements on
their show. 

I've already had it with the media.  They have done the same thing to the
Internet underground and the media greatly influences our government.

Respectfully yours,

  I think that the idea of writing numerous letters, e-mail, etc. etc. is
 a great way to: get your anger out. But, as pointed out to me the only
way to handle all this shit that we have seen and will continue to see
about our beloved rave scene is *to just ignore it!!!!* These people
that you are writing to* do not care*. They will only find someway to
exploit what you have put alot of time into saying to gain more ratings!
You can't change someone's point of view who does not want to change or
make another person understand if they don't want to understand. Just
please ignore it all;what you see on t.v., in magazines. We know what the
truth is, why do we have to prove it to those who are ignorant?!
                            love-

well, i have no idea.  i'm not a chemist, but it doesn't take a wizard to 
add up the number of parites that have happened in England and the number 
of people that have died from ingesting...stuff.  nstuff.  hi jeff!  
anyway, the percentage would be pretty darn low.  

and that's what i was getting at.  

don't worry you guyz.  this thing'll pass, and the most people will 
remember is "hey those rave things were on tv!  heuuhhh!  "

it's a great idea libby rose, but why waste the energy on trying to 
convince people that have no vision and don't listen to reason?  why not 
take that time to teach the people that do listen, and teach them well.  
like your parents, or whoever it was watching the show with you.  K?  =]  

if you spend your life trying to convince ignorant people not to be 
ignorant, you're going to wind up ignorant.  be careful who you hang 
around with and who you take advice from, because we become who we hang 
around.  

thanx!  love, deepfog

If the News-team at abc chose 20/20 to describe their vision, I think they
need another eye exam.

Hello. I am new to the bay area. I am originally from Indiana. I would 
like to know if anyone could tell me the names of DJs that spin the kind 
of music I like. I am only familiar or have heard DJ Dan, Ron D. Core, 
and UFO. One of my favorite labels is Drop Bass Network. I like hard 
acid house and hard trance. If you could suggest some djs in the bay 
area that I would like I would greatly appreciate it. Thanks.

What a great idea!  Anyone who got it taped could export a stillframe of
that woman who said that to a computer, touch it up a bit, posterize it,
and cover the walls at the site with it, along with a few B.W. shots!  The
whole thing could be a 20/20 spoof!  We could call E by a new letter, "D"
(for "Death"), and the D.J. could have a whole bunch of robed people with
tattooed heads and torches surrounding the decks, so it looked like an
old-fashioned religious-zealot cult!  (That would actually look pretty
damn cool!)  Yeah!  And we could all chant "Day of the Rope!!" like the
evil folks we all are!  :)   (It's a line from a cheezy old 80's flick.)
I could see it all now! 
Now if only I was a promoter...  :)

I thought the funniest part was when they were presenting drug
paraphernalia and they showed a GLOWSTICK! =20

I hope they'll do a report on deaths at Disneyland... Oh wait, ABC is

Well, well, well, you know how sooner or later everyone has one of thoes
nights that was just plain wrong? The oh-why-the-hell-aren't-I-in-bed
kind of night? 

I think I just had my first.

Galctic Tunnel started out innocently enough: your kosher F-8 map point.
'The spot' on Stevenson (Whats this about it being the 'new Acme'??).
Cought all of Minor-Minor's set (mail me man!), then while chilling
downstairs in the basment, everything gets real quiet. Whats going on?
The poliece are upstaris and the organizers locked the door to dowstairs
to hide that half of the party from being searched. Everyones
whispering, wondering what the heck is going on. Then about 10 min
later, everyone downstaris is given the word to start going out the
back, through the furniture(sp) store. But ofcource my jacket is
upstairs still which is being picked to the bone by the boys in blue. It
was disgusting, they tore apart backpacks tossing the contents around
the room, and a few people were cought with chemicals on hand. Hope had
a few things missing after her stuff was 'inspected'. Myself and about 4
other people make our way to the 24hr Carls Jr. through the POURING rain
and ofcource most everyone from the party is there, giving the midnight
shift crew more work then the they can handle. At first we hear the cops
aren't leaving untill 6am. Not! They're out by 3. Most people come back
and the music goes back up. My jacket is nowhere in sight and neither
are my keys. Not cool. Then the landlord, who I guess also ran the
furniture store and wasn't too keen on having about 20 ravers going
through their place. Comes up and kills the music. The remaining people
plop in one room and try to make the most of 420. I go back to my car.
The ticket I see on it doesn't disturb me. At this point, why the hell
not?

[Warning] Heartfelt ramble below...proceed with caution....

Yes the media makes me sick. They have taken a culture in which I find
enlightenment, peace, and security and have exposed it to the public as a
sick, drug-infested cult.

In the last year Hard Copy bashed LA desert raves, Leeza showed us off as a
bunch of clowns, and 7th Heaven was portrayed on the news as a riot waiting
to happen......

I have heard nothing but negative comments about raves from those "normal"
people that I associate with. These people get their info from the
mainstream media. I have gotten into numerous discussions with them, but
have not been able to instill in them an ounce of decency about the rave
scene.

When I think back to the Leeza show. I think how silly we must have come
off to the public. A good half of the audience was fully decked out in the
most socially-obnoxious apparell you could find. It angers me that when I
spoke to the producer beforehand he assured me that both sides of the issue
would be presented and discussed. Uhhh...yeah...right.

I'm not criticizing anyone. It is just obvious to me that nobody in the
mainstream public will take us seriously with the image we project.

And when I think about what's really going on from my "conservative" side,
I become afraid.

 Yes:

   "raves" allow young kids to stay up all night and take drugs.
   "raves" on many occasions make kids lie to their parents
   "raves" often require these kids to drive long
           distances to secluded locations.
   "raves" can seriously tax your mind, body, and pocketbook

I know the media tends to focus in on these issues, but if you were a
conservative parent wouldn't you rather be warned of the dangers these
"raves" introduce to your children. Shit who cares about spirituality if
I'm slaving away at a 9-5 job just so I can put food on the table and send
my kids to school where I hope they're getting an education and not doing
drugs.

Think about it....none of us pays their salaries. There are a few of us who
have the ability to function in Corporate America, but that's not much of a
voice. I believe that by associating with the rave movement we must also
accept the fact that we will probably never be understood, and we will
continue to be put up on public display as a bunch of freaks. There is only
so much we can do...SFR-legal has the right idea. We can make the system
work for us, but we will never get Joe "necktie" Smith to think that
"raves" are a good thing.

Let the media go. Let's concentrate on taking care of ourselves and getting
our scene more underground where it belongs.

Enough babble....and yes Terry is becoming much more cynical......I guess
age and experience can sometimes do that you ya.

love, energy, and viberations,

Terry

From:    Dorena B
To:      2020@abc.com

Dear 2020,
     My name is Dorena C. Bernabe and I am from San Jose, California. I'm 21
yrs old and I go to school and work full-time. I am also a full-time raver
     I started raving 3 yrs ago, because of my love of house music and of
people. I was tired of going to clubs that were like meat markets. I was also
tired of the violence that could errupt at anytime in clubs because of mass
alcohol consumption. In the rave scene, I found a place where i could just
have a good time. I was able to dance all night without being hassled by
drunken men or anyone else. I raved because of the positive vibe that was
present. 
     I won't deny that there are drugs in the scene. But, i will say that
true ravers don't need drugs to have a good time. We have fun whether we are
sober or we are on Ecstasy or any other drug. you don't stick out like a sore
thumb if you are not on drugs ar a rave. The only way you stick out, is if
you have a negative attitude. If you rave just for the drugs, then you are
raving for the wrong reasons. Raving is all about PLUR. PLUR stands for
Peace, Love, Unity, and Respect.  
     I won't deny that I do drugs on occasion, but that isn't the reason why
I rave. If I were in it just for the drugs, I would have burned out a long
time ago. Drugs get old fast. I rave because I love house music and I love to
dance. When I have been grooving for close to 6 hours to some good house
beats, I feel uplifted. House music is like the gospel to me. When I listen
and dance to it, it's tremendously religious. i experience inner peace when I
am raving. I know that a lot of kids that rave feel the exact same way I do.
We rave because we love the music and we love our scene. 
    I am livid that your report is going to cast raving in a very negative
light. You never look for the positivity that makes raving what it is. Your
report is misinforming the general public about our scene. The drugs don't
factor into the experience. If you wanted to know about raving, then you
should have gone to some real raves and looked for real ravers. They would
tell you what it is all about. It's about PLUR.  
     If you decide to do a follow up piece to your report, I would be more
than happy to participate in it. Here is my addres and my phone number:

i stayed out all night and took drugs before there were raves.  what 
makes anyone think they wouldn't do it anyway?  why not make a safe 
environment and educate people about substances and astral and physical 
side-effects?
>    "raves" on many occasions make kids lie to their parents
true.  but a lot of parents lie to their kids, too.  whoever started that 
rumor that people don't lie, well, they lied!

>    "raves" often require these kids to drive long
>            distances to secluded locations.
in the mountains of peru, people come from all over the area to take part 
in shamanistic rituals where they ingest psychedelic plants to touch the 
gods.  when i used to go to full moons, i would drive long distances, but 
it placed a value on the whole experience.  

>    "raves" can seriously tax your mind, body, and pocketbook

yes.  that is true.  but $40 or $50 in one night is average to spend, in 
fact even cheap compared to other people that go to weekend outings.

well, that's an important thing to remember.  most people don't care 
about the end result.  they are people who have an "instant breakfast" 
mentality and only look at the first layer of an issue.

 Hi all!  ]=)

 Turbulent is a word that comes to mind for me on this event. The 
location was moved to the Somar Art Gallery at the last minute. Luckily 
Galena (from Galactic Dreamspell) was still at the old location to inform us 
and give us directions.

 And by the by; HUGE THANKS to Rebbeca for the lift to and from the 
event. This girl is the most special person! Her heart is so big!

 The party was supposed to be at the galactic sweatlodge but was moved. 
This was both good and bad. Good as I learned that the police have been 
notified that there are illegal parties happening there. Apparently they 
were notified by Thomas Trouble who did it in retaliation for the russian 
boys, who ran the place, stealing money at the door and the mappoint.

 It was bad as there is no sound seperation in the Somar. The back room 
has a wall, but it only goes about 10 feet up and then there is nothing 
but a black curtain between it and the backstage area (where I had set up 
shop for the chill room). Between the main stage and the chill room there 
was only a curtain.

 I think that Adam's observation that the chill room sounded like an 
Amtrack railstation was very conservative. It was, without a doubt, the 
noisest chill room I have ever been in. (that is why Im calling it a 
chill room instead of an ambient room.

 I got to play with Seofon and Daniel from the Ambient Temple of 
I*Madgi*Nation. Great fun!

 On the mainstage I caught Andiamo (sp?), a tight, well rehearsed three 
piece band. Sort of like Primus meets Phish. They were fun and I enjoyed 
dancing to them.

 Galactic Dreamspell was kinda like a pagan sideshow. They wern't bad but 
not that interesting to me. Watching the firedancers was fun; I could 
smell the scoarched hair on one girls body as she allowed the flames to 
continously carress her. It seemed silly that they were wearing bra's and 
not naked.

 The sound system in the main stage area was pretty wimpy. One speaker 
was crackling all night and the sound just wasn't strong enough to fill 
the room well. I didn't catch the psi-trance DJ's all that much.  :(

 The jungle room was well equipped for sound thanks to Gateway (although 
as the bass waves from there rolled through the chill room, I was starting 
to hate Gateway's four 18 inch drivers), but it was too bright in there. 
Lots of floor lamps in a white room. Ugh. Big thanks to Rob for helping 
us get some decent speakers in the chill room.

 I have only two really serious complaints about the party. One obviously 
was the space for the chill room. I was given the choice of that or 
outside near the freeway in a trash filled patio, where it might rain. No 
tarp was forthcoming and it was a bit cool so I opted for the noisy but 
warm experience.

 The other was that a 100 foot extension cord of mine disappeared. 
Throughout the night various people wanted to (as usual) borrow equipment 
from me. I don't like to do this as I don't feel like trying to collect 
my equipment from tired, burnt out ravers in the early am. I'm usually 
too tired and burnt to remember what all I leant out and usually to busy 
to make a list.

 Well a certain girl, who was caught taking fluro-banners that didn't 
belong to her (from the Samhain party near Yosomite), was given my cord by 
the person who borrowed it. And gee she just seemed to have forgotten 
where it went to. Not only that but she didn't try to find or even say 
she was sorry (fucking bitch!). This slacker only goes to parties (early) 
to hang out and take advantage. Apparently she is stealing to support 
herself (she has no home or job). Most folks in the trance community in 
SF know who she is. I can give her name to any who wish it. Just email me.

 Also I leant out equipment to Gateway and had to locate it, claim it, 
roll up my cables and strip the duct tape off of them.

 So thanks to the irresponsible nature of most ravers I am no longer 
lending anything to anybody.

 On the plus side the event was good for drawing attention and raising 
funds for the Headwaters purchase plan. There was also a nice diverse 
crowd there.

Yeah...like what Seth says-- see if Dave Bayer would be interested in
spinning--he creates some fantastic and intense energy.

peace out

Hehehe --good idea !  And wouldn't it be cool to start off a rave 
with a sound collage of dorky little soundbytes from 20/20, and then
have that all give way to some truly massive beats?  :)
Anyone have a videotape of the segment that they'd be willing to share?
unity through diversity,

hey =)
im seriously curious to hear about some reasons behind this inscident, 
especially since they searched everyone, but didnt bust the party... 
strange... is my info clear, BTW ? its just what ive been reading from 
posts...

im wondering if this is another inscident brought on by conflict within 
the scene... ie. promoters calling the cops on other promoters as a means 
of revenge or competition, or if this is a foreshadowing of things to 
come.. ie. initiative taken by the cops to 'stop the raves' ????

discuss

I'm thinking of heading out to Meridian tonight...the clubhouse mixes the dj 
spun at my house last night just teased me, I kept wishing for it to get 
deeper and more real...but of course not.  And a hometown boy is spinning 
at Meridian, Sati of Berkeley.  Wanna dance!!

But all the negativity swirling around our scene (from outside sources, 
of course) is filling me with a bad omen about tonight.  Media hysteria, 
cops swooping on every party in Oakland, and even SF clamping down on 
Stevenson Alley, after a couple of months of parties there...

I still don't get it...WHAT exactly is the problem with a crowd of 
peaceful people wanting to dance all night in a private location?  

Hope to see some of you out there tonight - and a hopeful wish that our 
parties will be allowed to go on...(and I know wishing is not enough).

For one, its a death trap. Two, if something happened there and people got
hurt or even killed... We would really see a clamp down! Its tough to get a
location as many of you know, but putting people's lives in danger to "share
the love and vibe" is a bunch of bull.

Moshe changed the VM around 6pm. Now it says call back after 8pm. I can't 
wait; Meridian is gonna go off.

If anyone needs a lift to Meridian from Berkeley; ring me on 
510-525-FILM. I think I'm working the door so I'll probably head up there 
early.

how about opium dens, speak-easy's, beatnik pads, hippies, disco,
post-punk and so on... not to mention the esoteric "mystery" schools
involved in who knows what... raves are the closest thing to a TAZ en

     ABC NEWS "20/20" REPORTS ON "RAVES," UNSUPERVISED ALL-NIGHT DANCE
               PARTIES WHICH HAVE BECOME POPULAR, FRIDAY, JAN. 24 

     "Raves," an underground movement which gathers large numbers of young
people at secret locations for all-night dance parties, have become
popular in recent years. But beneath the laser lights and loud music, are
America's youth rebelling in a new and dangerous way, including the
widespread use of drugs? Lynn Sherr reports on ABC News "20/20," FRIDAY,
JAN. 24 (10:00-11:00 p.m., ET), on the ABC Television Network. 

     Raves, which are not supervised by adults, take place throughout the
country, including large cities and small towns, in farm fields and
abandoned warehouses or in after-hour bars or clubs. Young people find out
about the events through a network of secret passwords and Internet
communications. Because raves have become a haven for drug-taking with a
dance beat, organizers are determined to keep them underground, far from
the prying eyes of police and parents. 

     "If you go to a rave and you're not on Ecstasy or some other kind of
drug," a former "raver" explains, "then you kind of stick out like a sore 
thumb. You're.... you're an endangered species."

     In addition to Ecstasy, an amphetamine-like drug which helps 
party-goers stay up all night and dance, ravers take LSD or acid, an 
hallucinogenic drug, and Special K (ketamine), an animal anesthetic which 
is snorted by users. Dr. David McDowell, a psychiatrist who has studied 
ravers drug use at the scene, says that not only are an alarming number 
of participants using them but they are often taking several at the same 
time. 

     "Over seventy percent of the kids said they were on drugs," Dr. 
McDowell said. "The peer pressure to take these drugs in this environment 
is just profoundly strong. Many of these drugs are addicting and many of 
them have terrible side effects and can lead to tremendous devastation, 
both personally and biologically down the road." 

     For college student Sandy Montesi, who attended a 1992 rave in 
Orlando, Florida, the results were fatal and devastating to her family. 
The previously healthy young woman suffered a massive heart attack from a 
temperature which soared to 107 degrees before her death. Her mother was 
told that the temperature was brought on by the drug Ecstasy. 

     After her daughter died, Marsha Montesi learned that the 
establishment which held the rave Sandy attended had been visited by 
police 500 times in the two previous years, often to deal with drug 
activity. Through her grief, she helped enact a local ordinance to close 
such places down and had the dealer who supplied the Ecstasy which killed 
her daughter put in prison for manslaughter. 

     "We need to stop the raves," Mrs. Montesi says. "It's not a dance, 
it's not a safe place for your kids. Do anything. If your child insists, 
go with them and then you'll find out. Your child doesn't want you there 
because they know what is really going on."

people in the inner cities at least have a clue usually or know someone
who does as to what's going on in "the scene" - not necessarily the
"rave scene" - but drugs and crime... suburbanites are somewhat isolated
in their nice, cozy pocket communities and rely on shows like 20/20 to
tell them about how it's ok to have a chunky body, it doesn't mean
you're unfit...

...or that some people have sex addictions, it's ok to talk about
it...with a professional "expert" of course...

...or "stop the raves!"

... or look at those expiration dates on canned goods

...or if you cut your hand while cutting fish you should wash it or it
will get infected...

...or you should wash your hands after you wipe your bum before eating



-sorry, a bit side tracked... these "suburban" kids are "higher class
citizens", so its more effective propoganda in  going for the jugular of
the concerned ignorant portions of our society...


media sucks.

He has *another* new CD out called "Agents with False Memories", which is
much more mellow and is basically one long freaky distortion-laden hip hop
track with hundreds of vocal samples laid on top.  One of them I
recognized as a distant friend, actually, both from the voice and the
situation being described.  Quite good, though hard to find.  Dave Stein
at Ear-Rational can get it.

Okay, you have to admit that the whole Rave scene is a middle-class
suburban based movement.  It has it's roots (in the USofA) in teh House
music of Chicago mixing with the breakdace styles and then culminating in
the inner city in Detroit, but the Rave scene has been a middle class
suburban movement for a long time now.  I think this is part of the reason
why many inner city kids feel alienated by the Rave scene and do not
participate in it.  Much like the jazz scene, techno has changed a great
deal and become more distanced from the people it started with.  So,
talking with suburbanites is not wrong.  Did anyone notice that none of
the people on that panel were African American?  I think this kind of lack
of representation is more of an issue...

In Southern California, cops are constantly searching people without
warrants, good cause, etc..  It was part of growing up, if you were at
all adventurous or a partier.  It sucks.  Let's not give them too many 
reasons to bust us.  If it's true that Thomas Trouble had this party busted
that's basically a betrayal of our scene, in my opinion.  I mean to fuck
over a bunch of happy ravers because of some personal revenge motives.
I really hope it's not true.  I hope he reads this and responds.

Yeah, cops are dickheads, that's just a given...  But every week at least 2 or
3 smaller underground type parties go off without a hitch.  If "they" were
really out to get us, they just could go to Housewares and pick up flyers,
or subscribe to sf-raves, and bust every single party.  Obviously someone
had to call "them".

What we may have here is (in programming terms)  !(PLUR)
! is a c++ symbol for NOT or Negation or Opposite.  But I digress...

I will *strongly* double that sentiment.  Noam Chomsky for president.
Actually a Noam Chomsky/James Burke (that guy from the PBS series
"Connections") ticket would be so cool.

although many of my friends are from the suburbs as so am i, out east
the rave scene is from within as much as it is from without... i am not
as distanced from the people that started it (i live 2 hrs from detroit,
6 or so from chicago)... the influence is inherent...

may i reiterate the repeating patterns of psychedelic corruption... 

the sixties ended with the speed freaks, and then came the reds, blues,
barbs, yellow jackets.... so on and so forth...

rave started with mdma, then it became exstacy and now we have "E"'s
that sound like comic book superheroes... red rockets, white lightnings,
cherry bomb FX... out east we had a meth (speed) wave of abuse followed
by the downer of heroin cut e's... it's the same cycle repeating... and
hey, with the level of commercialism, we might as well be disco at this
point... keep in mind that the underground will always remain
formless...

as if Chomsky would ever become president... that's almost as absurd as
an "anarchist's party"... however, with the state of things as they are
it would likely take a decade or so to ease in a state of anarchy, so
there would need to be a party around in the meantime, however... this
party in the remaining years of government could fall prey to
corruption...

 Just to clear things up a bit; from what I heard, T. Trouble did NOT 
call the cops on this party or any party in particular. What he is 
supposed to have done is to call the police and let them know that the 
warehouse and it's operators are having parties there. He is supposed to 
have done this in retaliation for the russians, who operate the place, 
ripping him off at the door and at the map point.

 I can understand Thomas's being upset (hey, we all love being ripped 
off) but it seems a little harsh calling the police. On the other hand 
another death trap bites the dust.

 As a person who realises that our 3-dimensional minds only seem to be 
able to comprehend 3-dimensions, I always take a grain of salt with 
advice like this. Most people can't remember what they had for dinner 
three nights ago, let alone know extra-dimensional realities. However I 
do accept the possibility of your beliefs and appreciate the compassion 
within them.



>  I sense that you aren't really
> understanding the lesson but rather reacting to the experience.

 Well there is a lot to learn and a lot to react to. Usually when someone 
hurts me that way it takes a few days for me to learn/gain something from 
it. 


>  As for
> the young lady

 She ain't no lady.



> that you are accusing/condemning,

 She was caught stealing banners. She refused to help me find a cord she 
had been entrusted with. She didn't apologise. Those arn't accusations, 
they are facts. I'm not condemning her. I'm warning people she can not be 
trusted. I'm not the only person to make this observation.


> I hope you might possibly
> realize that she is as much part of the Isness as you are.

 Maybe we are, maybe we are not. Maintaing ANY spiritual belief as true 
is as arroagant (sp?) as anyone who doesn't believe in a spiritual 
reality. We just don't know for certain either way.



>  And as you
> condemn her, you condemn youself.

 Perhaps.


>  It is a lesson I still struggle with
> myself...  Put out only that which you wish to receive.

 Tell that to the Jews who died in Nazi death camps. Or the natives in SO 
many countries who have been butchered by invading armies and settlers.



>  Karma is a real thing that
> functions outside the realm of personal retribution...   

 I have no intrest in retribution. I only want people like her to stop 
hurting the scene. I can't afford to be ripped off. I don't make enough 
money at these parties to replace stolen/lost equipment.

 While I appreciate the compassion in your message Manoj, the attitude 
that everything is okay/it's just a lesson is lame. If you take it far 
enough then what I did/am doing is okay also. It's just a lesson.

No, the FUNNIEST part of it was when they interviewed all those K-snortin'
East Coast "wavers" and the woman asked them about Ecstacy and one of the
kids replied "If we gave you a hit of Ecstasy right now I GUARANTEE you'd
want another!" 
Humor. Straight up Humor.
Wayne is right.  20/20 got the gist of what goes on at parties without
distorting the truth too much.  It was probably the most acurate report I've
ever seen a news organization do on parties....The REAL problem is the
irresponsible people like the promoter/drug dealer in the parking lot and the
two girls showing off the acid tabs on their tongues. We need to take more
responsibility for what we do.  The majority of the reactions to the segment
that I've seen here on SFR don't echo this sentiment unfortunately.
Don't worry people. We needed this, I'm positive of it. We need to take it
back to the essence because I think we started getting too big for our own
britches....anyways, the collective American memory span is exceedingly short
so I wouldnt expect any negative fallout to last long.

Hey, any of you local bayarea dj's out there have any mix tapes that you
would like to put on the net as a real audio stream? I've pretty much got a
way to do it that is free....big fun :)  I've noticed that the streams are
only really sounding good when the person listening to the stream has a
28.8 connection, and a machine with a pentium/powerpc cpu....but, when it
sounds good...it sounds killer...so let me know all...the streams will be
going up on the new revision of bassline.org which will be up in a week or
so..

I'd love to hear comments on how the current stream are sounding if any of
you heds want ta give me some feedback...thanks!

(old mail day)

If someone attempts to send a message to SFRaves and yet are not
subscribers to the sfraves list, the majordomo software bounces it to me
personally, and then I make a decision as to whether to forward it along
or not.  There have been lots and lots of make-money-fast spams and Hey-
I'll-post-to-every-rave-mailing-list nonsense which I have not forwarded. 
Sometimes it gets caught if someone's email address has changed slightly,
in which case I'll add their address to an "exceptions" file and redirect
it back to the list instead of straight forwarding.  So,
CRYSTLMTHD@aol.com isn't a subscriber to the list, so I had to forward it. 

Sometimes I don't get around to going through bounced messages for two
weeks at a time....

      Hey there, everyone!   I was just curious if any of you were going to
try to go to The Jamaican Experience in Montego Bay in April.  It sounds like
one hell of a weekend of partying in the Carribean, so if anyone wants to go,
let me know and we can make arrangements together.....  Also, if anyone needs
any information on it, I have a little bit, so just ask.  It's pretty cheap
to go....
                             Much PLUR,

Hmmm....
Even more truth comes out of the Planet New Year event.
That explains why I didn't see 3/4 of the booked DJ's even roaming the
party, let alone spinning any music.

The name of the song is "Blue".  Don't recall the artist, though...

Well, from what I know, TT did let the cops know about the parties we were
having.
He did that because of his personal revenge. He was getting half of our
money, just him, for letting us borrow his shitty sound system, which would
overheat in the middle of the party and all the ravers would have to wait for
an hour for it to cool off.
He wasn't helping us at all, and he was using us to sell his fucking E at our
parties. Our parties are not about drugs we just wanted to present our music
to people. TT was using us and we broke up with him because of that. He got
mad because he couldn't use us anymore., so he threatened to kill us all
(bunch of bullshit).
he spread a bad word about us, so people wouldn't go to our parties anymore.
Thomas Trouble is not about music, he is all about money and drugs, and
people like that shouldn't have anymore parties, which he won't have for a
long time.......

 Hi all!  ]=)


 First off I would like to thank all those who have taken the time to 
respond to my post, in particular witht the regards to the missing cable. 
I feel I need to explain a bit what I was doing with my post.

 Most of us are familiar with the saying, "the squeaky wheel gets the 
grease", and what that refers to. In my post I was "squeaking" so that 
one, I could expell some bad feelings, warn some people about this person 
and hopefully force something to happen that would cause this person to 
at least acknowledge if not return my cable.

 Well something worked. I recieved a call that told me that the person 
involved had apparently "found" the "lost" cable. Not only am I glad to 
get the cable back, but more importantly that the person responsible for 
"losing" it returned it. This is a person that I poured a lot of love into 
just after she got out of an abusive relationship. We had started to 
drift apart prior to the holiday season, yet I made an effort to give her 
a holiday gift (that I made) so that she would know we (hopefully) were 
still friends.

 I was very hurt by her treatment of me at GaiaMind and I am very happy 
that the situation has resolved itself in the way it has.

 On a very happy note I have learned that we raised about a thousand 
dollars at that party for the Headwaters purchase. Considering that only 
$7 was charged at the door, I feel that is a considerable amount of 
money. In addition there was many connections made and consciousness 
raised on the issue.

 Biggest thanks to those that came out to support the cause! =) I would 
like to personally thank the folks who helped me; Rebecca, Martin, 
Leonardo, Graham, and the Gateway crew with audio support. Thanks to N8 
for trying!!

peas,

  Tomorrow being my little sister's birthday, we had the relatives over for
dinner.  Somehow the topic of flyer/house parties came into the conversation,
and that led to raves.  My grandmother had seen the 20/20 special and put
 her absolute faith in Barbara Walters.  Much to my dismay, she had her mind
set that raves are the stereotypical sex and drug fests.  After two hours of
arguing, I have enlightened her a little more on the subject of all night
parties, but have failed to sway her opinion.  This is what news shows are
doing to our scene.  I have very little effect on older people about this
topic due to my age.  I hate to bring up my age so much, but it's true.  Now
what do I do?  <sigh>  Oh well, it turns out I might go to Love-a-fair after
all. 

       hugs,

 Added note.... if anyone happens to be near Market and Castro on the first,
stop into the gauntlet and watch me get my tounge pierced.

I suggested that my parents watch the 20/10 special report
and they thought that it looked like "a shitload of fun" and
they encouraged me to go to more and to take them sometime.
They look down upon the drug usage in raves, but they like
the fact that it is about multi-racial groups sharing a common
interest in music, dancing and all out partying. They thought
that a few of the raves show must have taken alot of effort
to put together and saw it as a big accomplishment for teens
to achieve something like this. They got a big bang out of
how 20/10 always puts things way out of proportion.

hi
went to by the people last night.  pretty good space, decent crowd (a little
clubby feeling though), but the music was just ok.  i liked the Pure Science
dude doing the live stuff, but the djs couldn't keep it together for very
long, and the crowd never quite went off, although it could have.  they 
seemed to keep losing the momentum.  you know how when every stops dancing
and looks confused??  that kept happening.  great visuals.

I don't think most people are (quite) as dumb as the TV networks like to
think.  Things are changing fast, and people are losing trust in the establish-
ment.  It is true, though, that the suburbs erect a lot of walls between
people and keep them seperated(a bone-old tactic known as divide and conquer)
but at the same time there are a lot factors undoing this too, like raves.
And the 'Net, and the Simpsons ( :) ).  It all comes down to Yin and Yang
truths, really, so let's not worry too much.
Peace

This site blew my mind. 2)303's and 1)808 at your finger tips.  I know 
that I am getting their software after seeing this! If you have the 
specifications required for running their demo, you have instance acid 
tracks! It is my personal opinion that this software is the reason why 
people are selling their 303s. If I had just one 303 I think I would 
sleep with it every night. Considering that they are going for around 
$1200 bucks, a 303 is not an option for me right now. What is an option 
though is to buy the software. I hope anyone who reads this enjoys the 
site as much as I did!

I taped it all.

I should digitize the audio and take some good "out takes" and make them
into individual tracks. Then I could burn a CD with all this stuff on it.
That would make it quite accessible for DJ'ing, etc.

When I was taping it, the second I heard "Stop the Raves" I planned to make
a really cheezed out trendy rave anthem type song with the "Stop The Raves"
sample in it (a-la Mr. Kirk's Nightmare) -- that will be a hoot.

Babawawa, we love you! :-)

Just a though here, but should we actually have the SFR Calendar online. If
you do a basic net search on RAVES, the first thing that will come up is
Hyperreal, then by clicking here and there you can get to the SFR Calendar.
It has loads of phone numbers and party info. Does this actually have to be
on the net.

I think it's great having it available like that. We all know we at some
point delete the emailed version and often have to goto SFR website to see
the calendar. But do we really need it up there.

It might be better if it was just emailed out.


Just a thought, what does everyone else think.

	Yes, my parents are very supportive of my interest the rave
	scene.  They used to be hippies and they see how it is the
	"hippism" of the 90's:  peace, love, good music, vibe...

	I tell them every time I go to a rave.  Where it is, who's
	spinning.  I've told them all about DJ DAN and how great I
	think HOMEBASE is.  I even brought them to the last SFRaves
	BBQ...they went even though it was raining. That was just their
	intro. into the rave scene.  Next I plan to take them to Love
	Afair.
					RaVe On....MHg :)

What I was trying to get at was that by having a Calendar of events on the
web, it's easier for people such as cops and others we don't want to have
the info. They can get the list of events and then call the info line and
find out where it is and then go bust them.

With the current things happening in the scene, maybe having public
postings of info numbers and party info right on the web might not be a
good thing right now.

I know this would limit who get's the info, but it's better then giving up
info to people that are looking just to bust up a party.

I like having the calendar on the web too, but if not having it via the web
and only via email. What it slow down the bust. It's just too easy to get
the info and then go bust a party.

If they want to bust us, let make it a little harder to do it. We are
handing them the info if it's on the web. I'm not saying that we should
take it all off, just party locations, info numbers and names..etc..


Those are just thoughts.

	I TOTALLY AGREE!  I myself use it a lot but I did always think it
	was a bit strange for all that info. to be so public.  I think having
	RAVE LIST mailed out is a better idea.

THE FRIGGIN' WALL STREET JOURNAL?

 Will Pulsing Techno Sound                Rev Up the Music Business?
               By PATRICK M. REILLY                 Staff Reporter of
THE WALL STREET JOURNAL

               When Tommy Tunes, Frankie Bones and Adam X
took                the stage recently at the Asbury Park, N.J.,
Convention                Hall, it didn't look like any ordinary rock
concert.
               Instead of guitars, the performers jammed on
computer                gear and sound machines. One performer wowed
the                crowd with a PC, his fingers flying over the
keyboard                and unleashing brief snippets of recorded music
and                sounds from the machine's hard drive. They filled
the                arena with an entrancing sound known as "techno"
--                electronic dance music with a driving beat,
psychedelic                sound distortion and occasional lyrics that
consist largely                of hypnotically repeated phrases.
               Long played in the underground culture of
"raves,"                all-night dance parties fueled by the
euphoria-inducing                drug Ecstasy, techno music is breaking
into the                mainstream. And record companies -- desperate
for the                Next Big Thing amid two years of flat music sales
and a                sense that "alternative" rock is flagging -- are
starting to                place their bets on the growing genre.
               Its stars include the influential Chemical Brothers, on
the                Astralwerks label of EMI Group PLC; the
powerful                U.K. band Prodigy, on the independent label
Mute                Records; Orbital, a duo on the Ffrr label of
PolyGram                NV; and Goldie, another Ffrr artist who features
a                "techno/jungle" sound that mixes soul, hip-hop,
reggae                and pulsating beats of 160 per minute or higher.
               EMI's Caroline Records, known as an
alternative-rock                launching pad, is trimming its rock
roster to make a big                push for techno. Influential radio
stations are now                playing more techno music; KROQ in Los
Angeles has                had Orbital and Prodigy on its closely
watched playlist,                and have played the Chemical Brothers.
"Music for the                Jilted Generation," a two-year-old record
by Prodigy,                has seen sales shoot up in the past six
months, and now                Time Warner Inc. is trying to snap it up.
               "Until the sales of Chemical Brothers and Prodigy
made                noises, there was no point in the majors investing,"
says                Mark Fotiadis, general manager of Prodigy's U.S.
label                Mute Records. "But they like to say sales can
cure                cancer."
               But the selling of techno poses some
significant                marketing problems for the music industry.
The genre                has few recognizable performers who look good
on                videos and album covers. Its stars are as
much                producers, engineers and DJs as they are
performers.                Furthermore, turning atmospheric electronic
tracks into                hit singles will be tricky, since they
usually don't fit the                three- to four-minute format of
most radio hits and                rarely have lyrics. (Chemical
Brothers' breakout hit                "Setting Sun," has a spacey,
mantra-like refrain: "I tell                you that it's just too
bad.")
               "The challenge is to establish clear-cut artists in
the                dance techno market. Club people love it, but how
do                you spread it to a wider demographic?" says
Gary                Arnold, vice president of marketing of Best Buy Co.,
a                major music retailer. Mr. Arnold says
techno's                popularity mystifies him. "As a consumer I don't
get it --                but my 18-year-old daughter loves it."
               Mystifying as it may be to an older generation,
the                techno sound is starting to creep into American
pop                culture. The Gap plays the electronic artist Goldie
on its                in-store music tapes. TV ads for the Microsoft
Network                use a techno-like sound from the Los
Angeles                producers known as Dust Brothers. MTV,
bellwether                of virtually every music trend of the past 15
years, cut its                hours of rock and rap videos and added a
new techno                show called "Amp." U2, whose brooding
alternative                rock made it one of the world's most popular
bands, is                shifting gears on its March release with
several songs its                label executives describe as "more
electronic, techno,                more experimental."
               The U2 record will open "a lot of pop and
rock                people's minds to new sounds," says Jim Welch,
a                former director of artists and repertoire at Sony
Corp.'s                Sony Music's Columbia Records. "It will be a new
kind                of crossover."
               Record executives say the techno trend also heralds
a                turn in American youth culture. They say young
concert                goers and CD buyers are burned out on the anxiety
and                grit of alternative rock and rap, the last two genres
that                ignited blockbuster music sales. Last year,
anticipated                releases from alternative rock groups like
Pearl Jam had                disappointing sales, while the number of
radio stations                with rap formats declined.
               Perhaps in reaction to rock's intensity, there's a
market                today for a more upbeat, unconfrontational sound.
An                executive at a major U.S. record label sensed the
signs                of a new market when he caught a recent New
York                show by the Chemical Brothers, "The dancing
never                stopped and there wasn't a bad vibe in the room,"
he                says.
               The rave scene still carries with it an association
with                drugs, the kind needed to stay up all night and
dance.                But as raves and techno music go mainstream,
safer                alternatives are appearing. To counter the
stereotype of                drugs at raves, Robb Hart, a co-head of the
Watermark                label, runs a sister company called Pure
Children, which                puts on squeaky-clean raves -- complete
with security                battalions to check for weapons and drugs.
"The rave                scene gets a bad rap," says Mr. Hart. "Most
kids are                there to hold hands. They are lost and need to
hold                somebody ... It's very communal."
               At the New Year's Eve rave at Asbury Park,
where                teenagers danced from 11 p.m. to 9 a.m. to the beat
of                techno music, 20-year-old Andrew Deming was
on                hand for more than just the music. "What I like
about                raving is it's a place you can go for 12 hours and
be                warm and listen to music with friends," he says.
"You                can do what you want and be yourself. There
aren't                many places like that any more."
               What about alternative rock and grunge? "Pearl
Jam                and Soundgarden are all sold out and cheesy
and                played out on the radio. Everybody sounds like
them,"                says Mr. Deming.

Hello.

Wow, sooo much has happened in 72 hrs. It just makes my head spin....

Ok here's the 411.

Thursday-  _Gaiamind_
I pesonally don't about you but I see the scene for any reason to throw
a party, to throw a party.  Plain and simple.  (heh, I even remember one
time some pepole were disscussing to throw a going away party for an
Iguana, of all things.  And remember that Willie Brown partie???).
Anyways, a friend and I arrived fairly early to GM, round ninish (not to
be confused with Finnish) and one of the most memorable events of the
night happened...  I piaed my way in and headed straight to the first
doorway.  Which happend to be a stage where a live band was performing.
So I stood there, waved @ the audience and sneaked back out (I guess I
was a specal guest).  Like I stated in my last post I really felt for
the chill room, 'cos once both dj rooms went up that chill room sounded
like a kid with his first pair of Gemini's, train wreck city.  I will
fonly remember the chill romm as Amtrack Station.  The main room was
nice, it looked very CCC'ish.  The jungle room wis a bit too bright for
my tastes. What frigtened me was the pictures on the wall,  if someone
were to slip an hit one of thoesepieces it wiold turn from art to art
history, know what I'm sayin' ???
The crowd was nice,rainging from young to ol..., er, uh, not so young.
And I spent nearly all my time in the jungle room gruuvin' out to some
tight tunes.  Had to bail @ 1:30 to get to work tho.  All in all: 7 out
of 10 smiles. well done.

Friday: 
	Afta work, chilling with a few of my work supervisors @ a bar (yea, I
don't like bars, but I was invited, by my bosses no less).  Mr. Pager
started vibrating like a vibra... eh, hmm, well it started vibrating a
lot.  So I made my exit and headed to Oakland.  Picking up some folks
from Sweden, Finland and a good friend from Oak we headed to Castro
Valley to send regards to DJ Sahid ( techno DJ from Germ.) who was out
with the flu.  His envy was a little apperant ("we're going to a
PARRRTTTY nyah, nyah" =P ). And finnaly arriving @ _GT_ (possibly the
last party there) around 11ish.  Went straight upstairs and started
dancing...  Funny vibe that night.  My knee brace was 'swiped' within
fifteen minutes of me arriving there (not cool), but whatever.  
	I made my way down stairs to the psychidellec Trance room and very
ambient room (all thoses comfy matresses), waived hi to da DJ, (I don't
remember your name dude...).  Danced like a lil fool for a while and
went upstairs to check out what was happening.  The crowd was pretty
sparse, which isn't too much of a bad thing but nevertheless I know how
much people put into productions and if you don't at least break even,
it get's harder to throw future parties... 
	I hate to say it but it seemed the most popular place wasn't either of
the three rooms, but the stair well (ugh!) which make it increasingly
difficult to manuver up and down the stairs.  C'mon peoples, if you
gotta "Do your thang", do it in the chill room where it's traditionly
supposed to be done..  The stairs in themselves were a chore, walking
up, walking down, walking up  No need for a Stairmaster here.  Saw a few
of you, dear ravers, and said hi in my own special way.  And I know you
saw me (ya, just don't know it yet...).  
	Id say by 1:30 I setteled into the main room where (at last!) a crowd
of dancers was forming, I jumped infornt of a speaker and started,
"getting there" a few other dancers were bouncing about, but they we're
mostly set dancers, concentrating mostly on thier movements and totally
ignoring the music @ times...  Eh, experience brings skill and time
comes w/experiance. Ramptin fininshed off with a meduim size crowd
appreicating his tunes (Very technically 'On' IMO).  Then Mystr-E
stepped in...
	Talk about a 'HARD' set!!!  From the deep bass bumpin' beats to the
tweaky highs and funked midranges I completely lost "it", immersing
myself in the audio world of sound ([thump, thump] sound,[thump, thump]
sound)...  It's not that I enjoy making a spectical of myself, but when
I totally drop all my inhibitions, I jump up and doawn like a fool (a
rather cool fool, if i say so myself...).  I was thinking, "this is how
I want to play, 'On' like Ramptin yet 'Hard' like Mystr-E,  But I think
if I use the name DJ Hard-On, not too many people will understand it's
actual meaning...
	Only 20min. into Mystr-e's set one of the promoters rushes up to the DJ
booth informing the Dj (and my prying ears) that he just locked out the
cops.  I try not to laugh too hard, but it seems immensly comical
visulizing police walking around the enterance, knocking on the door,
trying to get in...
To my knowlage some one either drunk, or high (possibly both) walks out
of the front door and the SF Polo walk in...  Almost immediatly one
person is arrested for possesion of meth.  The sound is shut down and
everyone is ushered into the streets.  I find my party of three and we
pile into my car, we settle on staying in the city, rent a room and
order pizza (can someone say "munchies", I was dissapointed not to have
any cable, allthough I don't watch TV ...  I tried tuning the radio to a
decent station but the volume on the radio went to inaudable to VERY
LOUD.  So I meditated and listend to the party goin' on in my mind...

Saturday:  
	I really didnt get to sleep till 4:30PM Saturday but I was up at 8,
buzzing about and calling a different "crew" to find out who wanted to
brave the weather and get to _Meridian_.  Afta doing what hook-ups I
needed and after making too many wrong turns, stopping @ several
payphones along the way, and looking @ maps @ various gasstations only
1/2 our party makes it to the local. 
	And what a nice space it is!  Three rooms: one doing the Drumm and Bass
thang, one going off in the Trance genere and the third room spinning
I-don't-know-what.  I finally settle in the main room @ about midnite
just as Ethan starts.  I like Ethans sets. Plain and simple.  His choice
of music is very pleasent to the ear raingin from stompy stuff, to
relaxing minimal trance.  He knows how to bring a much needed slow trak
when the crowd needs it. I kept dancing, in the front of the DJ booth,
till about 1:45 and then decieded to "chill" somewheres.  I boogie over
to the Jungle room and relax on the floor and later on a couch.  Before
I left the main room I ask Deaks when he is up @ bat. 2 o'clock. Im
there.  
	I wave and say hi to the other folk I see @ this party.  A different
tribe from the GT bunch. Which is nice as well...  I've noticed that
thru my pursiuts of attaining oneness through music that I do indeed
"drift" between the tribes of techno.  Some peoples I only see once a
month, at house events, some I see every two weeks, at Psi-trance (ie
Goa) parties.  Some are only seen at Massives (once or twice a year).
But I try to make an effort to see my 'friends' every week... 
	Ding! the mental clock starts sounding and I 'know' that Deaks is about
to start, I manuver thru the crowds and get back to the main dance floor
one song before Deaks, I shed my shirt and start moving... 
	Now I must say, Deaks is one of those that, after only hearing a few
times, I know is going to help me mold my own mixing style.  He seems
also to be one of those that dosen't sit 'outside' mixing music in, but
rather, is 'in' the music blending it like a fine painter merges colours
into a work of art...  I only get to have fifteen minutes of pleasure
before the sound is shut off and we're told to disperse from the boys in
blue... Oh well, I've had my share of sooooo many busted partys i'm not
even dissapointed anymore. We are indeed the Underground Alliance ever
prused by the Evil Blue Empire. The Empire has struck again and us
Rebels are scrambeling like eggs.  Gosh I'm glad I was totally sober,
cos it seemed that nature herself was against some of us this night.  We
made a game of driving down the freeways (@ about 70Mph)  Counting all
the auto accidents for the remainder of the night...

Can't wait till friday (STAR WARS)...

P.s.es

Hey for all those that asked me to dupe a copy of 20/20 I allready have
some blank tapes, I just need to get an address or something to send it
to.  I think postage for the tape is 3$, first class I'll send out out
one granted that I get put on yor guest list when you throw a party...  

Micron, yea, that sounds cool.  I'm still waiting for these rains to let
up before actually planning events.  I allready have  6 sites lined up
(3 nitetime and 3 daytime locations). Send me a tape And I'll getcha one
of mine...  

Tim, so when is the planning commite starting for your june event- still
interested.

To who you are...  _Karma_ works both ways.  I keep trying to hope we,
as promoters can live peacefully.  Bad thoughts create threats, threats
caused ill actions.  Keep pure for the scenes sake.  We are fragmented
enough allready.  I allways try to think that parties are thrown for the
peoples sake.  Not to just make a buck, chuck. Too bad politics are
allways involved.  Such a shame.

I had a conversation with my dad about Wrinkle in Time (11/16/96) and all
the multimedia/decorations in the chill room and we got into a great
discussion about technology, some fascinating projects going on at MIT and
technology-obsessed kids getting together and throwing BITCHIN' parties in
general...

my dad can be a pretty cool guy sometimes. (sometimes =)

He knows about the drugs and the e and all (i've told him about the drug
culture) and he seems to not mind; I suppose he trusts that I won't do
anything stupid. (like getting whacked out on 2 hits of e on my birthday,
FOR EXAMPLE =) I guess a *smart* parent's main concern should be that their
kid can be having fun and partying and doing their thing, but that the
parties don't interfere too much with what's realy important to mom & dad,
i.e. school and work and such. Media emphasis on the drug culture unfairly
cons parents into thinking that there's nothing else that goes on at our
parties, and that the drugs are so pervasive that kids can't help but get
totally sucked in. I really wish Baba Wawa (or whoever actually did the
investigating) was able to look *more* than two feet in front of his/her
own nose and seen past the fucked up club-kiddies and saw all the work that
went into producing parties.

take care,

just remember that there's a delicate balance between advertising and
"keeping it real." Do you honestly think *anyone* would be able to fill up
your beloved HomeBase without massive advertising? And once the massive
advertising is going on the cops are going to get wind of it, and the
Oakland PD is pretty well known for getting huge kickdowns from promoters
for the use of that space. Not that that's a bad thing in and of itself,
but big parties at places like HB tend to attract a helluva lotta media
attention (from, say, ABC) and the resulting hoopla makes it harder for
smaller organizations to throw parties.

I find it UNBELIEVABLY hard to accept BIG PARTIES when I know that their
"bigness" is partly responsible for many of the problems experienced by
smaller crews. I understand that lots of people like huge parties and big
name dj's and $25 tickets and hard ass security apes, but I also think that
all those big events are causing some pretty serious problems for the
smaller parties.

What if we stopped calling them "raves?" What if we stopped sticking events
like Acid Breaks and FnF under the same umbrella to avoid some of the
confusion that results? My friend Sam, an avid Dj Dan/Homebase fan once
said to told me that he doesn't consider the parties he attends to be
"raves." He said that "Harmony, FnF and other small crews throw RAVES. I
just go to parties. They're just parties." I tend to agree.

my two cents,
-m.

Channel 23 live tonight at Cat's Alley, on 8th and Folsom. (Midnight)
Congas, Didg, Djembes, Dumbeks, Lute, Toms, Flutes, Sax's, Tablas,
Breakbeats, Rap, Fire Dancers, you get the picture.
Members of Galactic Dreamspell, (played at Gaiamind)
DJ Pollywog, and all the DJ's in the House spinning amazing stuff for a
SF nightspot.

It's not a rave in the sense that it's in a nightclub, and the cops cant
bust it (Does that make it less exciting?)  But the music is on the
level, and the tribe will be there, you know, all the people you see
when at the underground parties. And, it's open 'till 3:30!

Peace,

Well, this is alittle story about 25 of us on SFRaves put together since
Thanksgiving. We each added aline onto it and passed it along the list
until now. It is finally done. So I thought I'd post it here. The spacing
kinda sucks..just letting you know now.



           <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<   Little Johnny    >>>>>>>>>>>

    One day little johnny was walking home from school and he
came across a rather large tentacle monster. The monster's slippery
appendages were waving in the air and...he laughed and snapped his fingers
as the creature
rematerialized inside johnny's thermos. the creature, trying to break free,
violently rocked
the thermos, and ...johnny, always up for a challenge, busted out his
funkiest gangsta g-moved
showin' that the monster what time it was...Stepping back, the monster
laughed at johnny, knowing
how his superior strength could obviously overcome Johnny's limp-wristed
girly dance. The monster snapped a tentacle  at johnny. wrapping it around
his pink freakled nose. Johnny almost forgot what
was going on because only one tentacle could get out of the thermos, and
it was so hilarious to watch
his own plastic yellow Ninga Turtles thermos do the lambada forbidden dance
with the tentacle, this freaked the monster out, bursting with passion the
monster managed to escape from the thermos.
Thinking fast Little Johnny grabbed both his earrings, he threw them down
on the floor and upon
impact they exploded into huge clouds of thick pink smoke with glitter and
flames. Giving little johnny cover, he took that chance to make a costume
change. The smoked cleared and the croud applauded the
 new outfit. And what an outfit!  Johnny was completely nude!!!   "Oh, no,"
he shouted - just before he woke up, at home in bed.  It was another one of
those oh-no-I-am-outside-naked-in-public dreams, but worse, since in this
one, his THERMOS  was involved. This was his seventeenth strange dream this
week.
It was time to get some help.... and Johnny knew that God helps those who
help themselves, so
he jumped out of bed, put on his adidas sweatsuit, and went  down to the
basement where his elaborate chemistry set was waiting. "Surely I can mix
up something to stop my crazy dreams," thought the oh-so-clever tyke.

      Remembering what his father had told him about bad dreams,  Little
Johnny knew exactly what he needed for his secret "dreams-be-gone" potion.
So he ran back up to his room to retrieve his trusty
Ninja Turtles Thermos, which still contained some leftover  Tomatoe soup
his mother had made him for the bus ride home.  The soup was, of course,
cold by now. And all he needed was a.........
 little 3,4 Methylene-dioxy-N-methylamphetamine to give the  cold soup that
Mmmm, Mmmmm, Good taste.  So back down to the  basement he went to start
mixing up a batch. In a wink the vials were bubbling, the solutions
percolating, the tubes sweating, and strange-tasting crystals kept forming
in the back of johhny's mouth.  "aha!" he cried, strapping down the family
cat to the air hockey table and connecting the jumper cables to paws, ears,
and tail. "This is just what the doctor ordered - and now to apply the
...special life energy transfer helmet" which he had purchased  from an
obscure infomercial.  You see, by tranferring some of the cats feline
qualities into him, he could become more like them... nine lives, look
respectable naked, cool facial hair, and no bad dreams.  But as he was
about to flip the switch
that would render him virtually superhuman, an overwhelming sensation
swelled out in waves from his stomach and up his spine, eventually washing
over his brilliant yet troubled mind as he utterred ...
" Gadzooks!  There are no limits to what I can do!" He jubiliantly yelled"
one = infinity, nothingness = oneness, thank you Dr.Hoffman." His hand
spasmed and the switch was thrown!  His chemically
massaged neurons sizzled as his mind merged with his cat's!  Lightning flew
from his forehead and slammed into his 808, causing a thunderous rip of
bass to shatter all the glass in the basement!  Just before his brain
burned up completely, the power breaker tripped (his mother chose that
moment to
start the washing machine, which just happened to  contain Johnny's thermos).

  As the ozone drifted away, the cat sat up and said..."Poor Johnny, I kind
of feel sorry for that little chap.   I didn't mean for him to die.  I only
used my telepathic powers to give him that horrid dream and the idea to rig
us up to Brainswitcheroo, so that I could take over the world.   I didn't
mean to kill him. Oh well. Things to do, people to enslave." and she hopped
on to the computer to begin her evil plan.  Under the rubbage that was once
his studio, Johnny twitched and started to come to.  He looked down at his
battered and bruised body and saw....  that his arms and legs had been
transformed by the bass wave overload into rather large and slippery
tentacles. "oh my..." said Johnny, somewhat disturbed.  "It seems I have
turned into the horrific tentacled monster from my dream," and besides
being able to do the wave from his breakdancing past with a new and
profound grace, johnny didn't really see  much good in being a terrifying
tentacled monster.  But such is  life,  plum wackiness, and Johnny got up
and thought about chasing down that evil cat, whose fault it seemed all
this was. He jumped up, tentacles flailing, and slithered out the door.
Only to his greatest suprise did he suddenly...realized that it was a
powerful hallucination brought on by the energy transformation. As a matter
of fact, his tenticles then morphed into bat's wings, which then oozed into
dog's  legs, and then transformed into scaly lizard legs.  Johnny was in a
panic, seeing his body changing constantly.  He rubbed  his eyes and shook
his head.  When he opened his eyes, he saw  his human form again.  "Holy
shit, what a TRIP! Now I need to find my evil cat before it destroys the
earth!" Since  he now had part of his cat's instinct in his brain, he could
sense where it was headed, and what he saw frightend him to  the core of
his being....the cat was planning to unite all the consciousnesses of
earth in order to establish contact with the extra terrestrials of its home
planet, millions of miles away. Only with this combined energy could a
force powerful enough be conjured to tap into the minds of its
brothers/sisters at home, But first it was time for a short trip to...7-11,
where he could always rely on a good slurpee to fix all  his
intergalactic/consciousness problems.  he got his slurpee,  carefully mixed
the flavors to his liking, and, to his horror, looked into his cup and
saw....a terifying image of the cat!!!! Johnny shook his head and thought
to himself, "I must be trippin' or something!?!?...tentacles, dog legs,
world domination, a cat..........THE CAT!!!!". He looked again but the cat
was gone. Johnny had to do something fast if he were stop that nutty
feline. So he bolted to the nearest computer with a T-1 link and proceded
to... do a web search for something, anything, that would effectively
neuter the cat, clean up the broken glass and the slurpee stain now soaking
into the carpet, finish his homework, teach him to do the lambada properly
with or without tentacles, and help the new U.N. Secretary General achieve
world peace on a reduced budget, all before the Simpsons came  on at eight.
Since the boy had eaten his spinach the previous evening  (Thanks, mom!) he
knew this would be a piece of cake  (no cavities intended).

      Standing naked on his Twister board, two legs, one arm and three
tentacles contorted at various positions around his torso and each other,
Johnny held his mouse before him like a Samurai warrior as he clenched the
keyboard in his teeth and  proceeded to log in by typing with his tongue.
But Johnny's third-grade public school education hadn't adequately prepared
him for ownership of a megalomaniacal pet  with a predilection for
attacking things attached to the ends of long strings and cords.  Before he
could say the magical words of "Frammin' on the jim jam, frippen' at the
krotz, schleppin' and a fleppin' with an alakazotz!", a virtual image of
the Cat lunged out of the computer screen and grabbed his mouse in its
greedy paws! As Tweeker (the cat) toyed with the mouse, Johnny realized
frantically that only one thing could save him now  with lightning speed,
Johnny reached to the keyboard and launched three instances of Microsoft
Word.  Instantly, the unbridled processing power of his quad-heptium 500
MHz  Hypercharged PC was brought to its knees as system resources were
lapped up by the hungry application.   With a scream, the virtual cat
creaked to a frozen standstill,  hanging out of the monitor, unable to get
a timeslice.  "I  have you now!" yelled Johnny, gleefully opening documents
until the cat's fate was sealed with the inevitable GP Fault and subsequent
aptly-named Blue Screen of Death.The virtual cat was dead, but what of the
cat's physical body? Johnny bolted past the astonished patrons of the
Starbytes
Cafe ( " 30 Quad-Heptium PCs, Powered By 100% Pure Kona Coffee !!! " ) and
rushed home to confront the alien cat.

         Meanwhile, Johnny's mom Leslie had opened the washing machine  to
find a broken thermos, and all the clothes stained pink. Angry at first,
her annoyance turned to shock when a tentacle reached out from the soggy
mess! Slowly, a horrible creature  pulled itself out onto the floor. As it
shuffled past her to
the basement, the thing whispered " If it makes you feel any better, just
call me a hallucination - everyone else does " . Johnny burst into the
washroom and dashed to the basement door! Seeing Leslie frantically trying
to simultaneously phone 911 and search through the hardware drawer for a
weapon, Johnny said .. WOW!! look at all the pretty colors.. and then all
of a suddena door opened and the lights came on and there were cops at the
door yelling "Ok folks, the parties over, everyone has to go home now." As
Johnny was  gathering his things, all he could say was, "Damn, what a trip"
as he looked at the huge day-glo and neon painting on the wall with
flowers, and cats on it on his way out of the warehouse.

Hi, Everyone :)
I'm sorta new to the rave/clubbing scene, and I'd love to meet new people
to party/rave with.  Even though I've been going out full force since last
August, I have yet to make friends associated with the "scene."  My
problems are two-fold:  1) I'm pretty shy, and I have yet to walk up to any
strangers and just say, "Hi," and 2) all of my friends are either too young
or too burned out to go out anymore!!!
Will anyone please help this poor boy break out of his shell and push me
headfirst into weekend-long fits of dancing mayhem??? ;)  Thanks!
-Thomas
P.S.  For anyone who went to We The People (Loveworks) this weekend, I was
the guy with the blinking red lights in each hand.

Do wall st. Journal!

I was actually impressed with their angle and view on the whole
subject.  They simply reported the facts and left it up to us to
interpret them.  While it did connect raves and drugs, it kinda
downplayed the issue.

HMM.......

Oh, that was you! (duh, that's like saying "I was the guy with the
platforms," I must have seen ten people with blinking lights this week)

You are right about your problems.  You need to go up to people and say
Hi. You shouldn't put down your friends.
The only way to meet people is to talk to people.  Sounds like you are
already going out full force, so if you haven't met any people you can
hang with, you mustn't be talking to anybody.  The best way to meet
people who like to party is at parties, I.Y.K.W.I.M.

I'm not being sarcastic, I am just helpin', bro. :)  At least you are
saying hi on the internet, try it in real life.

Why are most of you appalled at the mainstreaming of techno?
Techno is not ours, and it is not the only music of the scene.
As I had read in someone elses mailing,
"The scene will come and go many times, and so will the people in it."
That is not exactlt paraphrased, but it is close.
The mainstreaming of "techno," excites me, and this is a very short
explanation of why...
For the past few years, techno has begun to be somewhat the same, if 
the techno that has been out is what is mainstreaming, we in the UG
scenes will always have new styles of music, and I believe this will push
the progression of music styles even faster. I heard techno for the first
time in the late 80's / early 90's. "What next," I thought... then acid,
breakbeat, hardcore... what could posssibly be next? 
Then Jungle... OH MY GAWD!!!!!!!
I cannot wait to hear what could possibly please every one of my senses more 
than jungle...?

Check this (and yes it is related) ~

"time to consult the anarchist's cookbook...
let our new york operatives take care of the biz..."

The newsgroup for the interactive multimedia assoc of New York recently
kicked this woman out for "too long of a post".  Now this woman did what
I think is a perfect little fuck-you that can't be traced ~ like
something to do to 20/20.

It is believed that this woman is responsible for redirecting all of the
messages from some cat group to the multimedia group.  The multimedia
group is now being bombarded with hundreds of cat messages a day, and
it's growing uncontrollably(over 300 on Saturday!).  And these messages
can't be easily filtered out.  

Here is a group of some the supposed most talented and they are having a
serious difficult time trying to correct the situation. In the meantime,
it's become quite a bothersome drag. But I have to admit, its a nice
little slam by that woman.

Does anybody know how to redirect email?

Just getting my evil thoughts out.

BTW: This story is actually going on as we speak - the email bombing. 
The woman who is being occused actually is an employee of Microsft.

responded to the accusations.

I would just like to say, that I have also done a lot of reading on MDMA,
and I have not run across evidence that it does bad things to your body.
Which doesn't necessarily mean that nothing bad can happen to you.  It just
means that there is not enough research done on it.

I was unfortunate to have one of my best friends in 2 pretty critical
situations.  Both times she had seizures and she was taking E at the time.
Both times she was lucky that it was just a seizure and she was functioning
in reasonable time (30min or so).  But it could have turned out a different
way.  My friend does not have epileptic history and her doctor's educated
guess was that it was E that caused the seizures (one doctor said it was
low sodium because of too much water, but when it happened the second time
- just 1/2 hit followed by 1/2 hit of E, not too much water etc. I am more
in favor of blaming E).

I have posted this in a past, and I just want some of you who think that E
is a wonderful thing that can't cause problems to think about it, and not
just shut down possibilities that something bad will happen.

As I was watching 20/20 they showed doctors report why that girl died, and
although they didn't say it (they emphasized on body tem.), she have had
seizures that probably pushed her over the edge.  Maybe it was the
combination of the 2, maybe it was more stuff we don't know about.  But I
have to tell all of you that it hit me, that my friend could have been in
the place of that girl, and I was so happy she wasn't.

So, please when you do take your drugs be careful, and don't just accept
facts that you want to hear as the truth.  There is more to it.  If you
want to take drugs, it's your choice, but be aware that there might be some
truth in what doctors say - not all of them are out there to get us.  And
the bad thing about E is that it's pretty new, and nobody really know all
the side-effects and possible problems it can cause.

I know that I have seen some of this type of information on sfraves before
but I cant seem to find it again...I am investigating making some type of
after e packet to give/sell AT COST to people at parties. Something that
contains all of the stuff that your body needs after taking e and dancing
all night...can I get some leads on where to look for this or if some
informed knowledgeable people can help me out that would be really cool,
the compiled knowledge will be made available publically and will
hopefully be making it into your scene...

Though their editorial stance is almost laughably "right" -- pro-business,
pro-capital, socially reactionary, Republican partisan -- journalistically
the WSJ is excellent.  It's the best reported and produced paper of its
scope that I know of.

Thanks for bringing that up. I wanted to say something like that, but since
I am part of F&F, I was afraid that it would have come off too smug if I
(or any other F&F person) said it.

Just because F&F exists it doesn't mean anyone out there should be shy away
from trying it themselves.

Other people on SFR should be getting together and having their own "list"
parties, too. BBQ & Beats was SFR-inspired and those parties are totally
cool. Adam Guevara just put something together in a living room recently
and he spun at it, too. That's what it's all about, people! :-)

That's the beauty of DIY. (do it yourself)

What??  Okay, i'm confused on this.

I thought it was pretty much assumed that MDMA raises the body's temperature.  

Everything i have read about MDMA has talked about the fact
that it is easy to die of hyperthermia and/or dehydration
because of this fact.

This is usually heavily mentioned in talks about MDMA and Raves
because Ravers tend to wear hats and lots of clothing
and dance in places with poor ventilation and a lack of free water,
AND because most of the MDMA related deaths have been attributed to this.

I don't know about 107 degrees, but everone's body is different
and we don't know what she was wearing or where she was at the time.

Other than hyperthermia, on hyperreal.com, there is also mention of:

high pulse or blood pressure, faintness, muscle cramping, or panic attacks,
dryness of mouth, jaw clenching, teeth grinding, nystagmus (eye wiggles), 
sweating, or nausea, fast or pounding heartbeat, dizziness, restlessnes

(from the MDMA FAQ) 

This is all not to mention the neurotoxicity theories
about MDMA depleting seratonin levels in the brain.

There are also three articles on Hyperreal talking about "Ecstacy"
use leading to death.

I'm not sure what people are reading, but i would highly reccommend:

http://www.hyperreal.com/drugs/mdma
http://www.ecstacy.org/

Hey Folks...

I don't usually do party reviews but I had such a great time at First
Contact that I can't help myself. The gorgeous Lightseed folks out-did
themselves completely. The music in all 3 rooms kept changing and evolving
- creating a constantly changing atmosphere, I found myself wandering
happily around all three rooms - everytime finding something new, something
weird, something totally different.

My favorite was the goa/psychedelic trance in the main room which kind of
became like a 2nd home to me after awhile. Cimino & Caban & Brad destroyed
the place and then built it back up again - kind of like the Hindu god
Shiva - who destroys and creates at the same time. Brad at 6 am came out
with sounds I've never heard before. Brilliant.

The back room was also a weird place - everytime I went out there something
different was happening. My friend loved the digerdoo performance (which I
missed), describing it as "an hour of beautiful nothingness".

All night I kept spying the fire marshall standing on the stairs above the
entrance. At first I thought, oh oh he's going to bust us... but he stayed
there hanging out with a vaguely bemused look on his face. He actually
ended up staying until 6.30 am or thereabouts. Wandering around, chilling
out in his tight black uniform. I saw alot of people talking to him,
smiling at him, and I came to the realization that he was INTO it.. This
got me thinking ... WE CAN TURN THE FIRE MARSHALL INTO A RAVER ... I could
see it in his eyes, he's ready to convert... he he he... this would be
changing the system from within.... so next time you see him at a party,
smile at him, give him a hug.

Enough rambling, thankyou for indulging me...

... thanks and hugs to all the Lightseed crew (I miss your smiling faces in
my loungeroom every Wednesday) and to those associated with them....just a
few names (pls forgive any exclusions)... Dagny, Brett, Melaniefish (you GO
girl!), Chin, Mark and Philip.

Pleasantly surprised last night to turn on the radio and find a brand-new 
weekly show dj'ed by the jungle queen, Stareyes.  

"Shortwave" is on midnight-1AM Sunday nights (or Monday mornings, I guess!)
on the mighty KALX (90.7 FM).

Last night she did an interesting retrospective of artists from various 
points of their careers...and with quite a smooth, silky voice 
(especially for a 19-year-old!), I think she has a future as a radio dj!

My favorite station just got a little better :)

	I TOTALLY disagree.  Just because they are bigger doesn't mean it
	isn't a rave.  Sure it may be on a much larger scale all around, but
	it is still a rave...of course I suppose it depends on YOUR definition
	of a RAVE.  
	
	Mine : friends, vibe, great techno, mixed group of people

Actually, the show is hosted by a different dj each week.  "Shortwave" was
created to showcase all genres of electronic music, so you never know what
you might hear.  I'll be hosting it Feb. 9th, with mostly minimal techno and
a bit of ambient.  Hope some of you guys can listen in!

SHORTWAVE
Sunday nights
midnight-1am

This is actually a weekly electronica show with rotating guest DJ's,
including SFR's own Sutekh.

For the record, I wasn't trying to say that there are no dangers in using
E (or any other drug).  Pills/capusules and the like are especially
dangerous since you never really know what you're getting.  
The bottom line is if you choose to buy and take _any_ drug, you are
taking a _big_ risk.  I worked in a pharmacy for a couple of years and you
wouldn't believe the interactions and 'side' effects that even legal,
regulated 'healing' drugs can cause.  
So, be smart.  
I feel for all those who have related E-related horror stories to me.
Sadly, there _is_ a down side to _any_ drug use, kids.

Hey Dana... I liked and agreed with your post except for one thing - and
we should not lose perspective on this - it is not 'easy' to die from
taking MDMA. In England where at least (these are rough figures) a
half-million people take E every weekend there have been only about 10-20
deaths in the last 5 years or so (again these are rough figures). I have a
visitor who is an english dj and he tells me that statistically more people
die from EATING PEANUTS than from MDMA. These people have allergic
reactions to certain chemicals in peanuts and the same is true for the
majority of e-deaths - people react allergically to the drug. It doesn't
suit everyone - neither do peanuts. I think he even said that riding in a
car is a much riskier activity statistics-wise than taking e.

And while i agree that you need to drink water and be very careful to rest
during dancing - its also important to remember that Leah Betts - the
english girl who died and was splashed all over the media as an E death
actually died from drinking TOO MUCH water. She drink 10 glasses of water
one after the other.

Lastly, I think we have to be careful not to get caught up in our fears
about mind-altering substances so that we can make well-informed choices.

SOMAR...  that space is incredible.

Do you know why the fire marshal looked so happy?  Becuase he was probably
making well over a hundred dollars an hour to supervise the rave.

But, you certianly can't complain, becuase when the cops show up and there
is another City Official there watching over things, the likelyhood that
they bust the party goes to near zero.

This is actually a pretty old concept. go to any live music venue in
SF, check out the "hall capacity" sign, then do a rough headcount of
the number of people in the venue. From practical experience (from
knowing people in the biz back in the late 80's) I know that music
venues in SF regularly go to 1.5 to double the capacity of the venue.

How do they do it?

Simple -- they bribe the fire department with free tickets, free drinks
for certain employees, and LOTS OF CUTE YOUNG GIRLZ :-)... I know for a
fact that Slim's has been doing this for years. It's just good business
ya know!

Now that techno has become mainstream (c.f. the W.S.J. article recently
posted, playing Robert Miles' "Children" as the segue music during the
recently televised pro ice skating championships, the use of housy
techno as background music during a recent televised basketball
game...) ... anyways, now that techno has become mainstream, maybe the
fire dept will become interested in attending techno/rave events --
they will be willing to bestow their "blessing" to such an event for a
kickback. So who wants to be the sacrificial rave hoochie-girl (or boy)
for the lonely men (and women) of the SFFD?? :-)

That's all good! In addition...

There is always the tracker software for PCs with soundblaster
soundcards... I am not sure about Macintosh support, but there are a huge
amount of mods and samples out on the net for this sound tool. Do a web
search (no using Lycos, :D) for it210.exe. I think there's a newer more
advanced software package out there, though I can't recall the name to
suggest it. If I come across it, I'll post it. Also...

If you are interested in a fully MIDI implemented 303 klone (which I
actually perfer over the TB303) check out the Syntecno TeeBee (made in
Holland). It sounds just like the real thing (much better than the
BassStation) and is full MIDI, so you can program it directly with you
sequencer. No messing with sync and backup of the TB303 internal sequence
memories... not sure of their url, but you can link from the "gear" section
of my www, listed below... tell 'em I sent you, there all good over there
(I like them to know how much I love and refer people to their unit, NO I
don't get any kick backs for the referral) ;) The guy who designed and
builds them is a great guy who is fully involved with the scene in
Amsterdam. Perhaps you have heard of Robbie 303?

plur y'all,

Eudora Pro (and other packages) can forward e-mail on receipt... would that
meet your needs? Imagine 20-30 people auto-forwarding the sfraves list to
20/20. Can you say massive junk mail? I thought you could. :) Well, hey, if

This is all good info and extremely valid. In addition, some people may
overlook the other aspects of health and drug experiences. EVERYTHING you
eat and EVERYTHING you do and EVERYTHING you are plays a role in your heath
and life experiences in general... I am truly sorry to hear about *B*'s

a bad hot dog or lack of sleep or anything, who knows... I guess my point
is: I see us all commenting on how 20/20 twisted the incomplete facts they
had for their report (as expected). I hope that all of us realize that
without the complete and accurate story on *B*'s friend, it's all just
speculation (as read in *B*'s email, the professionals weren't even clear
as to exactly what the problem was). We wouldn't fill in the blanks like
20/20 did? Would we?

Mailbombing ABC would probably be counterproductive, don't you
think?  Sending a flood of well-thought out mail, on the other hand,
is an excellent idea.  Very different things, those two.

    This is in response to the above posting.  We hope to clarify the
presence of the fire inspector at First Contact last Saturday.  In order
to throw First Contact, we needed to go through legal permiting in order
to have a public assembly.  That meant that we needed to talk to the
SFFD.  They told us that they would permit us but that because there
were over 100 people expected that a Fire Inspector needed to be there
the whole time.  That meant that we had to pay the Fire Inspector
through The City some outlandish rate like $56.75 an hour to inspect.
That cost us a lot of money that could have been donated to our
charities.  The police came three times throughout the night but partly
with help from the Inspector they left us alone.  We went til' 7:00.
The Inspector was very nice and danced for part of the evening.  As for
sacrificial "hoochies" there were none.  Upon leaving our event he told
us he had enjoyed his evening.  The only thing that anyone gave him all
night long was a cup of Chai tea from Nub Chai.

    Thanks to all of you who came out last Saturday, we hope you enjoyed
yourselves.
    We had an awesome time.  The crowd makes the party.  Thank YOU.

Re: Wall Street Journal article:


Oh, this is bad, this is very very bad.  I wasn't so concerned when raves were 
slandered on Sleeza or even 20/20;  I wasn't even that worried that MTV would 
pollute the scene with goofy trendies.   But this article, in what is perhaps 
the most studied and trusted newspapers, worries me.  It firmly attaches the 
statements "emerging" and  "potential profits" to the techno scene. It lays out 
record companies' plans to push into the market.  This article was really the 
first wake-up call that woke me up. 


It's time to go deeper...
  
  much deeper...

   underground. 












Just don't go so far down that I can't find youz!  ;-)

Also, I agree that the SFRaves calendar on the Hypperreal site, although 
convenient, is probably too readily accessible. How about a password protected 
one? The password could be some little bit of trivia or something that most 
people on the  list would remember.

I read one review of First Contact that was held at the somar 
gallries on sat. the 25th. Any one else on the list make it 
to this one? There was 3 or4 other parties that night
but quite a few people made it despite other events and the skechy 
weather.
This party was a benifit for the cbc and the headwaters.There were
alot of new faces there and every one of them seemed to be having a 
great time. If you went, let me and the other readers know what you
liked/disliked.This way we can keep striving to have great parties
that support a great cause.
Hats off to everyone involved, this was one of the better parties
Ive played in quite a while.Great music,great space,cool fire
inspector:) what elese could you ask for! 
 
                Thanx and keep smilin...sean...

Hi!  ]=)

 Your post really resonated with me so i felt I had to respond.

 Interesting connection there. I used to work with QSO. The 2nd rave I 
ever went to (and my first ExpEriencE) was a show called LightHouse 2. It 
was on Halloween at the Old Jose's Cantina in Santa Cruz (which when 
closed down in 95 I threw a LOT of UG parties there for free). I was in 
charge of sound (three rooms running off of the DJ's coffin and mixing 
the house equipment with what we could scrape together) and had to pick 
up an emergency sound system at the last minute when the ambient sound 
system truck broke down in SF. QSO played that night.

 That was Claire from Gateway Sound Systems.

 Well thanks. "Some" cross noise?  ;)

 Well some of that music is available.

 There was essientially two of us. Me (Dionysus Dreams) and Seofon from 
Ambient Temple of I*Magi*Nation. ATOI has three CD's on silent records. 
They are quite good. Seofon was on the wing portion of the tables and I 
was in the center. (under the mandela)

 I'm so sorry. That must have really hurt. (((((hug)))))

 Well, thanking her would just be too spiritualy smug for my tastes, but 
I think you are right in that she is showing us (me) some important 
stuff. I used to not be very different then her in some ways.

 Sorry. We beat ya all to the punch. The fire marshall was at GaiaMind 
also. I told him that I had a 1st aid kit and a fire extinguisher by my 
table and that I was trained in 1st aid and CPR. He replied that I was 
all set then (grinning the whole time). I replied that he must not be 
doing to bad as he was making overtime (he had told a friend of mine this 
earlier). He smiles even more and says "It's all good." YIPPEE!

 We poured so much love and good vibe into him. He was practically 
floating that night

 Let's keep up the good work!  =)

You need to think of a really kewl ice-breaker.  Perhaps offer candy to
everyone in the chill room circle?  How about lotion?  There are lots of
kewl things that you can consider an ice-breaker at a rave.  Perhaps you
have some glitters, or toys, or even glow in the dark pendants.  Be creative.

Exchanging phone numbers among people you have met at the party usually
helps.  Bring an organizer or even a notebook (my friend Matt brings this
raver autograph book where everyone can write or doodle something)   This
helps you remember names too!   

Also, being involved in ridesharing to a rave is a good way to meet friends.

Hope this helps.....

	Actually, the cops came barging in, where interspetted and 
brought outside. The party was fully permitted (even the public assembly 
if I heard things right) so the cops could not lawfully even enter the 
SOMAR. Instead, they drove around outside all night writing tickets to 
any car they could find a potential problem with.
	I don't know how Lightseed got the public assembly permit as that 
is reported to be the most difficult to get...

	Think for a minute. A cop gets an account on some ISP. Subscribes 
to sfraves or sfraves-calendar and gets it delivered once a week free of 
charge. To take it off the web, would be pointless unless we take it out 
of the mailing lists. And why should the calendar be hidden?

That's where we had the Digital Be-In, including the very successful
midnight seminar, which was a great rave event. We went until 7:00+ AM with
no issues.

It sounds like the best profession for a raver to go into is Fire Marshall.
You then get paid to hang out at raves. I don't think there's anything that
says a F.M. can't dance...

This is a smile note. It means you should smile. Upon receiving
this note, it is customary to...


1.) Smile, someone loves you.

2.) Turn and smile at the person next to you.

3.) Smile at at least one cute and fuzzy little animal. (they might

    not smile back, but know that they appreciate it)

4.) The next time you see them, smile at the person who sent this

    to you.

5.) Send this along to anyone you know who needs a smile. (no, this

    isn't a chain letter, it's just a smile)

in all my bitching and cynicism out here on the east coast, someone
pointed out to me the other day that a "scene" is not a tangible thing,
so how could one ever place any sort of expectations on it... our music
is a product of our scene... the scene is the sum total of anyone
involved in it actively or passively at any given instant... with the
mainstreaming of techno, many artists, usually the ones with most
commercial appeal, will be spoonfed upon the consuming masses... this
will of course make many strive harder to push the envelope, but it will
also result in a more passive audience and the appearance of passive
musicians (like existing commercial dance music where only 10% new
succeeds)... i think the reason much of techno has begun to sound the
same, is because of the new found passivity in the collective... in some
respects, i have found that i can not play experimental "new" mu-sick at
large scale parties because people have an adversion to it... it doesn't
fit the norm (which in Toronto consists of snare drum builds and
progressive hard-house) so i am relegated to the "ambient room" and
yesteryear's folklore... meanwhile, the elements that "work" within the
mainstream are ripped off by dj's that attended their first parties
hosted by yours truly... i am not the only UG DJ to experience this...
ALGOrhythm and Jarkko have also had their share of frustration... and i
suspect this may be the case all over north america... we perservere
however, in the hope that someday down the road, innovation will be the
key to success, true originality within sound production (as a live
artist and a dj) will become the factor with which the mainstream
decides, rather than the displaced respons-abilty currently upon the
shoulders of marketing executives who continually give us musical pablum
in the guise of the next big product...

pipe dream or pied piper?

I'm kind of disappointed in all the rumors going around about this guy.  
I really don't know him that well but have spoke to him once and my 
sister sees him a lot.  I trust my sister's judgement and she says his 
intentions are good.  He may be making money off his parties but from 
what I understand he is doing it to open up a record store with 
accesories.  He is throwing parties because he loves the music and wants 
to provied it to people.  If he has shitty equipment, then let him know 
and when he has the funds he can buy better shit.  I know he got f#*ked 
by the russians who own the stevenson space.  You know the "new acme".  
Well I say ____ them and bouycott the place.  i just got a phone call to 
day and TT is/was in the hospital.  He is ok but is definatly scard for 
life.  

I am to say no more but just know this.  The people that own the 
stevenson death trap, do not deserve ANY support from our rave scene ANY 
MORE!  Please don't use that space again and please tell others not to 
either.

If you know Tomas send him your support, if not at least wish him a well 
recovery.

 PLUR,

       Austin

i've also heard of a prank by the church of the SubGenius out of Dallas
which involved an investigation of the US postal system and timing the
delivery of some 10,000 or so letters to the SPAM company requesting
free product for several quasi-religions that utilized it as a
sacrament... they had to hire a temp to sort it all out... if every rave
mailing list member decided to send some mail, one could create quite a
backlog in their public relations department... they do have to read
every single letter... what if someone saw their long lost son on the
"addicted to sex" article and wanted to track them down... or what if
someone actually had something positive to say... they'd need that for
reading over the air...

i ran mind-machines at raves in toronto for about 2 years and we had a
trend towards people on E being more susceptible to seizure type
reactions while on the machines...

mind-machines, in case you don't know, are devices that flash
full-spectrum light at specific frequecies that entrain the mind into
various states of consciousness... obviously not a toy for epileptics...

the reactions we'd commonly see with people on large quantities of E at
the peak of their experience ranged from eyelid blinking to facial
twitching to (and i only had one of these) a grand mal seizure... all
with people having no epileptic history...  we hypothesized that E
generates electrical activity in the brain that at times could become
the same as a seizure... i don't know if this is attirubutable to MDMA
or if it is because of impurities ala unsterile clandestine labs or cuts
in the E...  but there was a trend towards epileptic-like reactions to
the mind-machines... fortunately 98% of them were not uncomortable to
the user...

everyone who takes E should invest in the following ingredients for this
fabulous come-down rice-milk-shake:


blend


one quart of Rice Dream Rice Milk (Carob is best)
two bananas
three tablespoons cashew butter
two tablespoons powdered ginseng
one teaspoon spirulina
one half teaspoon liquid gingko biloba 
one half teaspoon liquid echinacea & goldenseal
one half to one teaspoon powdered ascorbic acid
ice if desired...


ginseng and gingko biloba act as excellent cleaning 
agents for the blood-brain barrier

vitamin c, spirulina and echinacheal & goldenseal boost
 the immune system

bananas and cashews help the body replenish lost seratonin

the rice milk is good for digestion

always consume some vitamin c from an organic source (if not a real
orange, than "not from concentrate" juice).

vitamin c evaporates into the atmosphere when exposed to air... so try
to stay away from concentrated juices... keep a lid on your OJ... or use
a juicer...

to buy all the ingredients (in Canadian $$$) runs around $50 to start
and then you should have enough for a couple months solid buying rice
milk and bananas thereon in...  beleive me, it's well worth it, and the
combination of banana, cashew butter and carob rice dream tastes great.

The Declaration of Evolution

When in the course of organic evolution it becomes obvious that a
mutational process is inevitably dissolving the physical and
neurological bonds which connect the members of one generation to the
past and inevitably directing them to assume among the species of Earth
the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and Nature's
God entitle them, a decent concern for the harmony of species requires
that the causes of the mutation should be declared. 

We hold these truths to be self evident: 

That all species are created different but equal; 
That they are endowed, each one, with certain inalienable rights; 
That among them are Freedom to Live, Freedom to Grow, and Freedom to
pursue Happiness in their own style; 

That to protect these God-given rights, social structures naturally
emerge, basing their authority on the principles of love of God
andrespect for all forms of life; 

That whenever any form of government becomes destructive of life,
liberty, and harmony, it is the organic duty of the young members of
that species to mutate, to drop out, to initiate a new social structure,
laying its foundations on such principles and organizing its power in
such form as seems likely to produce the safety, happiness, and harmony
of all sentient beings. 

Genetic wisdom, indeed, suggests that social structures long
established should not be discarded for frivolous reasons and transient
causes. The ecstasy of mutation is equally balanced by the pain.
Accordingly all experience shows that members of a species are more
disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, rather than to discard
the forms to which they are accustomed. 

But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, all pursuing
invariably the same destructive goals, threaten the very fabric of
organic life and the serene harmony of the planet, it is the right, it
is the organic duty to drop out of such morbid covenants and to evolve
new loving social structures.

Such has been the patient sufferance of the freedom-loving peoples of
this earth, and such is now the necessity which constrains us to form
new systems of government. 

The history of the white, menopausal, mendacious men now ruling the
planet earth is a history of repeated violation of the harmonious laws
of nature, all having the direct object of establishing a tyranny of the
materialistic aging over the gentle, the peace-loving, the young, the
colored.
To prove this, let Facts be submitted to the judgement of generations
to come. 

These old, white rulers have maintained a continuous war against other
species of life, enslaving and destroying at whim fowl, fish, animals
and spreading a lethal carpet of concrete and metal over the soft body
of earth. 
They have maintained as well a continual state of war among themselves
and against the colored races, the freedom-loving, the gentle, theyoung.
Genocide is their habit. 
They have instituted artificial scarcities, denying peaceful folk the
natural inheritance of earth's abundance and God's endowment. 
They have glorified material values and degraded the spiritual. 
They have claimed private, personal ownership of God'd land, driving by
force of arms the gentle from passage on the earth. 
In their greed they have erected artificial immigration and customs
barriers, preventing the free movement of people. 
In their lust for control they have set up systems of compulsory
education to coerce the minds of the children and to destroy the wisdom
and innocence of the playful young. 
In their lust for power they have controlled all means of communication
to prevent the free flow of ideas and to block loving exchanges among
the gentle. 
In their fear they have instituted great armies of secret police to spy
upon the privacy of the pacific. 
In their anger they have coerced the peaceful young against their will
to join their armies and to wage murderous wars against the young and
gentle of other countries. 
In their greed they have made the manufacture and selling of weapons
the basis of their economies. 
For profit they have polluted the air, the rivers, the seas. 
In their impotence they have glorified murder, violence, and unnatural
sex in their mass media. 
In their aging greed they have set up an economic system which favors
age over youth. 
They have in every way attempted to impose a robot uniformity and to
crush variety, individuality, and independence of thought. 
In their greed, they have instituted political systems which perpetuate
rule by the aging and force youth to choose between plasticconformity or
despairing alienation. 
They have invaded privacy by illegal search, unwarranted arrest, and
contemptuous harassment. 
They have enlisted an army of informers. 
In their greed they sponsor the consumption of deadly tars and sugars
and employ cruel and unusual punishment of the possession of life-giving
alkaloids and acids. 
They never admit a mistake. They unceasingly trumpet the virtue of
greed and war. In their advertising and in their manipulation of
information they make a fetish out of blatant falsity and pious
self-enhancement. Their obvious errors only stimulate them to greater
error and noisier self-approval. 
              
They are bores. 
They hate beauty. 
They hate sex. 
They hate life. 

       We have warned them from time to time to their inequities and
blindness. We have addressed every available appeal to their withered
sense of righteousness. We have tried to make them laugh. We have
prophesied in detail the terror they are perpetuating. But they have
been deaf to the weeping of the poor, the anguish of the colored, the
rocking mockery of the young, the warnings of their poets. Worshipping
only force and money,they listen only to force and money. But we shall
no longer talk in these grim tongues. 

       We must therefore acquiesce to genetic necessity, detach
ourselves from their uncaring madness and hold them henceforth as we
hold the rest of God's creatures - in harmony, life brothers, in their
excess, menaces to life. 

       We, therefore, God-loving, peace-loving, life-loving, fun-loving
men and women, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the Universe for the
rectitude of our intentions, do, in the name and by the Authority of all
sentient beings who seek gently to evolve on this planet, solemnly
publish and declare that we are free and independent, and that we are
absolved from all Allegiance to the United States Government and all
governments controlled by the menopausal, and that grouping ourselves
into tribes of like-minded fellows, we claim full power to live and move
on the land, obtain sustenance with our own hands and minds in the style
which seems sacred and holy to us, and to do all Acts and Things which
independent Freemen and Freewomen may of right do without infringing on
the same rights of other species and groups to do their own thing. 

And for the support of this Declaration of Evolution with a firm
reliance on the protection of Divine Providence, and serenely confident
of theapproval of generations to come, in whose name we speak, do we now
mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes, and our Sacred
Honor.

But the 20/20 producers saw that as "all that work that goes into
developing a captive drug distribution network." (Read: RAVE.)

You remember on 20/20 where the promoter was offering to sell "x and k"
"you know I got that, don't you?" to the people as he handed out flyers?

Damn, that reminded me of being at a party about two or three months ago
when these pimped out 16 year old kids from the "6 in da' mornin" crew
walking around the party pushing their flyers and esctacy on nearly
everyone there. It was so visible that I would have to say that they were
"lacking tact" to say the least.

First Contact was honestly one of the best parties that I've been to in 
quite a while.  The vibe was simply incredible!!!  Cimino tore it up.  
That was the first time I had ever seen him spin and I was impressed 
big time.  Tracy was amazing as usual.  I think one of the best things 
about this party is that towards the end of the night, I realized that 
not one person at this party approached me or any of my friends 
attempting to sell E or what not.  Don't get me wrong, I love E, but 
for some reason I honestly had no desire to put any drug into my system 
at this party because I was simply having A LOT of fun without it.  
The location was incredible.  Three good sized rooms, one of which had 
jungle going for a lot of the night which is a bonus for me.  There was 
a lot of room to dance.  In the main room, towards the back, Lightseed 
provided a movie theatre with trippy films and cartoons going the 
entire night.  
Basically, First Contact was an awesome party.  With a can of food the 
party was only $10 and I probably would have payed more.  The best 
thing about this party is that it benifitted the Headwaters, the 
C.B.C., and Food Not Bombs.  Kudos Lightseed, First Contact was the 
bomb!!!

Peace,

Matt

this seems to be my occassional Timothy Leary posting craze...

it is relevent however to observe the eight stages of consciousness as
Leary set out in his works "Neuropolitique", "Info-Psychology" and "The
Game of Life" as well as being echoed throughout the work of Robert
Anton Wilson ("Quantum Psychology") and Antero Alli ("Angel Tech: A
Modern Shaman's Guide To Reality Selection")... all these books are
available at most independent alternative thinking (occult, new age)
book shops and they are all published by New Falcon Press... 
"Neuropolitique" gives you basics... "Info-Psych." is very technical...
"The Game of Life" is very occult orientated... and the Alli and Wilson
books are set up sort of like text books with excercises (they're the
easiest reads for the initiate and the excercises can be fun in
groups)... I highly recommend checking them all out, and pick the one
that most suits you...



the eight stages have also been divided up into 24 stages where each
stage has an reception, integration, transmission phase... and Leary has
paralled this system (in the Game of Life) to most of the other occult
systems such as Qabbalah, The Tarot, I Ching and the Zodiac...


to the best of my recollection, i will review the 8 stages and apply
them to why psychedelic experience should be a right of passage into
adulthood... now there are exceptions to every rule, and the world being
a relative place could see the age of adulthood being 13 for some and 30
for others... it all depends on the development of the first four
stages...


CICUIT ONE: the bio-survival circuit>>>  this circuit is the infant who
is attracted / repulsed by things that nurture / threaten... this
circuit can be activated in later life in instances of life-or-death...
since our offspring are an extension of our consciousness through DNA,
this circuit has also been activated in instances of mothers lifting
volkswagons from pinned children...

CIRCUIT TWO:  although i forget the specific name of this circuit, it is
developed around "the terrible twos" as the infant/toddler attempts to
figure out what he/she can get away with... it is the ego figuring out
its status within the tribe... undeveloped second stage circuitry can
result in bullies in older years...
	 "Reality is what you can get away with" - R.A.W.

CIRCUIT THREE:  symbol/ dexterity circuitry>>> this is where the mind
develops language capacities and tool using skills... the capability of
navigating within this reality...

CIRCUIT FOUR:  the Socio-Sexual Circuit>>> this is where the adolescent
becomes the adult... it is figuring out the social patterns and sexual
imprinting that will carry the string of consciousness into its next
generation ultimately... our "first" experiences imprint, which is why
those who have a first experience with the same sex often become
homosexual... and which also explains the homophobia in many north
american males as they are subjected to moral dogma which dictates same
sex experience as being wrong... many people accidentaly imprint in very
casual circumstances like "playing doctor"... the conflict of experience
to imposed morality often causes the male to repress the experiences and
LOUDLY voice and reinforce the dogma...

CIRCUIT FIVE:  the somatic circuitry>>> this is the mind totally aware
of the body... marijuanna accesses this state... as do many forms of
meditation and martial arts...

CIRCUIT SIX:  this circuit is the brain aware of the hardware of the
brain...  in this stage one can reimprint any of the previous stages...
LSD accesses this stage which is why minds that have not fully imprinted
their previous stages risk becoming an acid casualty as they can
re-imprint their developing cicuitry every time, even though they don't
realize it... it would not be healthy to re-imprint while police raid a
party, or the power goes out and there is a lot of confusion... one can
see how delicate this imprinting time frame is, and it usually is a
window of about one second (to my experience, unless one consciously
maintains the window at its most open state)... you have this dilation
of reality into chaos... and then there's a moment where it all clicks
and comes together... and it seems to be downhill from there...

CIRCUIT SEVEN:  this is genetic consciousness which can be accessed
through large doses of psychedelics combined with the right diet...
this is the brain becoming aware of the language which programmed it in
the first place...

CIRCUIT EIGHT:  quantum consciousness>>> this is where you leave the
scale of consciousness and fuse with all around you... i wouldn't even
begin to attempt to describe it outside of a fractal equation... chaos.


i probably haven't done any of this justice, so please go and check out
the books, they're definitely worth the read...  everyone has a little
bit of a different slant on the 8 stages, which makes it a real existing
school of thought that is very relevent to psychedelic culture...

happy trails


timothy in your bandwidth...

well, i don't know...when we fax-bombed 20/20, they got the message 
REAL good.  They not only couldn't receive anything else for 3 days, they 
had to change their fax number twice.  Of course, we found out what the new 
one was.  

that's the advantage of a big network of friends working together in the 
spirit of purrfect harmony.

	I say boycott it unless you want to be in some place that is just
completely unsafe and horribly dangerous. I was there for the first time
ever this weekend and I am surely not going back. I had the wonderful
pleasure of getting a serious electrical burn from some of the faulty
wiring there and all I was doing was sitting on the floor up against the
wall groovin' to some phat jungle. ;) Maybe it was my fault for not
examining the entire place for a safe spot to sit, I don't know.
	I don't really blame anyone for it, but I am choosing to take
myself out of a situation that I know to be a bad one. Just a warning to
those of you out there who don't already know the space... if you go there,
I suggest that you be as careful and aware of your surroundings as you
possibly can, you always should be, but in this place, definiteley be
careful.

jenn

	p.s. To those of you out there who were involved with the party
this weekend, sorry about it getting busted and all the other crap that
came along. My support is with you guys.

I don't know where TT is at nowadays, but he seemed like a nice enough
guy the many times i've chatted with him (Sunsets, two years of burning
man rave camps, etc). (Of course, I've been duped before by seemingly
well-intentioned PLUR-spouting ravers who really were just wolves in
sheep-clothing). However, I did get the impression that TT is sincere.

> If he has shitty equipment, then let him know 
> and when he has the funds he can buy better shit.

When I saw him at Burning Man, he had a nice new soundsystem out there.
It sounded pretty good back then. Of course, if you overload
soundsystem speakers for many hours on end, they will end up sounding
like crap. I did notice that TT didn't seem to mind occasionally
clipping his amps, which is pretty much the kiss-of-death for speakers
if done for long periods of time. SO maybe he fried his speakers??

Now you've truly piqued my interest. Please don't just leave us
hanging. What exactly happened? When you say "russians", do you mean
"Russian mafia" or just "Russian immigrants" -- there's a big
difference and it's not really fair to disparage a whole national group
simply because there's a lot of organized criminals that have snuck in
along with the last few years batch of Russian emigre's.

Ok, Call me stupid... But I KNOW I have commited myself to help out a
sound crew to setup @ a party this Saturday...  I forgot who you are.
If you don't get in touch w/me by today (1/28/97) via email or pgr
(510.218.7494), I will be possibly getting pre-sale tix for the cloud
factory event via mail...  I hate breaking engagements, but if I don't
know who you are, how can I help out???

Could Lightseed's legal status have something to do with it being a 
charitable event?

I don't think cops have to search the net for a party to bust on a 
Saturday night.

Cops have beat areas that are relatively small.  A large gathering of cars
in an industrial area is suspicious.  A crowd, of course, is suspicious.
Even if they didn't notice the party already, cops also must respond to any
complaints from "neighbors" or anyone else.  And I'm sure they become
familiar very quickly with often-used locales like Stevenacme Alley, and
know to drive by on the weekend. 

Cops "own" their area of patrol.  A party going on - or a well-known party
locale - is pretty difficult to hide.  And we all know the economic forces
driving the crackdowns.  Cops must enfore permit fees and "legal" business
interests.

The Happy Fire Marshall story reminded me of a funny thing I saw at 
Spundae... A big, beefy security dude stood at the edge of the dancefloor 
all night, headphones and perpetual tough-look on.  But the dancefloor 
was going OFF, and I knew the energy had to be contagious.  So I 
concentrated on him, willing him to feel the music and abandon the 
security attitude...I danced harder and harder, c'mon, security guy, 
dance dance!  And finally the music got the best of him, and he suddenly 
broke out of his rigid stance and went crazy right in front of the dj!

The music'll get them all, every time. :)

ALL,
	I believe making people happy is rave related, but some people.....


The top 18 signs you've hired the wrong clown for your child's party

18. By the end of the party, he's got every damn kid doing the "pull my
finger" trick.

17. Clown car must be started with breathalizer device.

16. Keeps screaming, "My name's not BO-zo, it's bo-ZO!"

15. References to Kierkegaard and Nietzsche are lost on most 5 year olds.

14. Props for his "disappearing" trick: a moving van and your wide-screen TV.

13. Scares the holy hell outta the kids during the "Severed Limb" trick.

12. Tells the kids he killed Barney in a blood match in Newark

11. Didn't bring balloons but managed to twist your dachshund into other
animal shapes.

10. Prefaces each trick with, "Here's a little number I learned in the      joint."

9. NOt exactly the Peewee Herman impression you were expecting.

8. Wears a t-shirt that says, "Drug-free since March!"

7. More interested in squirting seltzer into his Scotch than in his pants.

6. Those huge ears look too darn life-like, and the entire act consists of
showing charts and complaining about the deficit.

5. A sad clown is one thing - a clown who spends the entire party with a gunto his temple is another thing entirely.

4. Only balloon animals he can make are a snake and a "snake on acid."

3. Business cards include the phrase, "From the mind of Stephen King."    

2. Price list includes "lap dance" and "around the world."
and the number 1 sign you've hired the wrong clown for your child's party
.. . 
1. All the balloon animals are ribbed and lubricated.

Yes, I noticed the firemarshall at GaiaMind and decided that the best
thing to do would be to make him welcome, so I ended up chatting with
him for probably about an hour! He was a really nice guy, just doing
his job and making sure people were safe. I asked him what he was looking
for (enough exits and correctly placed fire extinguishers), I also asked
about the permit process from his point of view, and in general we had
a very pleasant chat (I even took his photo! He struck a very "official"
pose and said he didn't want it to appear that he was condoning anything!).
Sounds like the fire department and police department have very different
agendas - he didn't know too much about the legal side of things vis-a-vis
underage kids or whatever - all he was concerned about was safety. And he
was having a great time! He said the last event he had inspected at SOMAR
was a "devil worshipping party" (!), so this by comparison was a very 
healthy crowd! 

I definitely agree that the presence of a happy fire-marshall will do a lot
to discourage overzealous cops from busting an event. If people go out of
their way to welcome fire-marshalls, it'll certainly help defuse the 
likelihood of a bust, and maybe even make for a better overall relationship
with the authorities. If First Contact got Fire-Marshall Bill again, he
was already on our side! Glad to hear it went off so well!

[enter Tim, face flushed with excitement]

U2! U2! U2!  Given the trend of their last three albums, I should've
noticed sooner that they'd be the torchbearers for bringing techno
outside!  
"We were born from the underground, and that's where U2 is going back to.
And the underground music is infinitely more interesting than what you
hear over the radiowaves, and we're trying to alert the world to this!
It's revolutionary but not necessarily evolutionary, though--you can
find the roots of techno all the way back in the mud of the delta blues,
and the hip-shaking of R&B.  It's just taking on a whole new form.."
						-U2's Bono

POP can be purchased from your local evil and capitalistic record store
on March 4.  Because advertisers want to brainwash you, they will put
the record in a highly visible place, probably near the fron of the store,
so it'll be easy to spot. ;)

Their most shameless fan,
Timothy

	Oooh, that must have been the Digital Be-In. Those
silly Burning Man types are still into their "hell" theme.
What a great party that was, though.

	Did I mention Satan's head on a stick?

	He was there at Gaiamind and was probably talking about the 
psuedopagan type band thing with their fire eaters and all. A very showy 
band that needed a sound engineer or maybe a better mixing board.

	I will say this again. From what I heard, all the permits were
obtained for the lightseed event. The fire permit, the public assembly
permit, and insurance. I kind of doubt that it was billed as a rave when
it was presented to whoever doles out permits, but since I was not
involved with the party I can do no more than speculate in awe and
wonder... I do know that the cops looked REALLY pissed off when they were 
moved outside with the fire marshall...

	These are the two reasons parties get busted. People drawing 
attention to themselves between the time they park and getting into the 
party, and parking lots popping up where there have not been cars for the 
last three years. Please be consscious of the ways we draw attention to 
ourselves....

Sorry, my last mail should have said that the two reasons Nancy sited for 
parties getting busted, i.e. cars in industrial area which are normally 
deserted or people in the parking area being loud or obvious, are 
probably the two greatest reasons parties get busted besides for noise 
complaints. They are also things that each of us can take some part in 
toward helping parties, especially renagades, go all night...

hi. my name is philip. i am a graphic designer and architecture student
and "the fuken bomb" according to meri. i have no job. i used to have
one, but i moved to san francisco last week and figured the commute to
san jose would be hell. i was right. i took CalTrain to san jose this
morning. eek. loooooooong, leisurely roll down the peninsula... fine
every so often, but not something i'd want to do on a daily basis.
ANYWAY, i digress. i'm basically posting this hoping that it will save
me a bunch of searching, but i'm not counting on it. sooo...if anyone
knows of any design/production artist positions (especially in the
advertising or architecture fields), please let me know! i once read
that something like 70% of jobs are filled by word-of-mouth
(word-of-email?) references. fishing through the classifieds sucks,
although that's how i found my last job/internment. part time or full
time welcome, although i think that another 40 hr/wk job will just make
me go kookoo. freelance? sure!

thanks for your time. :)

Yeah, swallow your pride, folks!  The media loves to pigeonhole special
interest groups, ethnic groups, etc.  There are some really important
things that we've done such as support Headwaters, CBC, the Rainforest,
Food not Bombs, just by showing up to these parties. So many wonderful
people I see in this city, smilin', whenever people seem to have a grip
on a way of life that really works, others who are not "tapped in" have
a need to blame it on the drugs.  It's just way that the U.S. media
distracting us from our real problems.  It's like were starting a new
Counter Culture like in the 60's, so it's bound to be misunderstood by
the ignorant.

One thing I've learned is that no press is bad press.  Any soundbyte or
quote for empty minds to chew on, keeps 'em busy.  The 20/20 segment is
a trite issue when a every second the rainforest is being cut at the
rate of a foot a second, or when there are Feds saying that Prop 215 is
invalid.  

Keep on dancin', mixin', playing, recording, recycling, supporting good
causes, and quit worrying about our image!  We know we're right and it's
obvious.

(Galactic Dreamspell)-- Yeah, the sound really sucked that night, but we
tried our hardest to put on a good show.  We couldn't hear anything on
stage and we've definitely had better shows.  Pseudopagan???  At least
you are half right. The common misconception of New Age dogmas is that
Paganism and New Age Spirituality, and even Astrology, is Satanism. 
Fire is one of the four Earth "elements" and Christianity associated it
with Satan. 
The whole backbone of throwing Gaiamind (on Jan 23 specifically) was the
planetary alignment, (Won't happen for another 26,000 years the way it
did on Thurs!!) the dawning of the Age of Aquarius, which is the end of
the age of Pisces, which dawned when Jesus was born and the religous
symbol was the Fish, --and of course, the benefit for Headwaters.  
Thanks for coming, though.  Promise next time we'll sound better.

Well, harmony with eachother anyway.  Sounds like you're essentially
waging a war against the staff of 20/20.  You can never truly
win a fight if your values are peace and acceptance;  You defeat
yourself.

But then, if they were mendacious, perhaps they were lying about

"Unnatural sex?"  Would Mr. Leary have been a homophobe?  I wouldn't

mass media?

"Life-giving alkaloids and acids."  I don't think there's any mystery
here that Mr. Leary is referring to LSD and other psychoactive drugs.
I would hardly call those "life-giving."

That's hardly a crime.

I'm not so sure.  Buddhism certainly did well in the 'war' against Hinduism, 
yet The Way To Enlightenment is certainly a passive and no-confrontational 
one.  Peace and Acceptance can be useful tools when they are used against 
those who would like to be thought of as peaceful and accepting.  =)

HAHAHA...
This is exactly what I have been thinking all along...
With comments like,

"I'm gonna call 20/20 and say, 'I'm a raver, wanna buy some doses?'"
"We should fax 20/20 a bunch of flyers."
"I wish 20/20 interviewed me, I wanna be fucked up on tv!"

on and on and on and on...

I attempted to send an intelligent reply to 20/20, which probably is lost
amongst the onslaught of mundane faxes they recieved.

Oh, Well.

BTW...

The people at 20/20 have the right to believe that the reason they are
recieving all of this childish "spam" is that ravers are mad about their
exposing the truth about raves!!!!!!!
Is this what we are trying to tell them?
Do you really think that mail-bombing 20/20 is going to help our cause?
That's a lot of fucking energy you would be wasting on mundane revenge that
could be used to get out the message of what a rave really means to you.

	This is typical for the east coast. People gather from about half 
way up and down the coast. They drive 4+ hours to go out without finding 
it a pain in the ass (it's half of the adventure from what I got when I 
was on ne-raves).

	Not all people want their parents to go to a rave. I wouldn't 
want to bring my parents to a Harmony, but I would take them to a full 
moon or a party I am involved with...

	Some raves are pretty much exactly what 20/20 reported on, but
there are other types and that is where 20/20 lacked integrity. They
reported solely on one side of the "rave" phenoneum and didn't even seem
to be looking into what it encompasses in other places than Flordia and
parts of New York. They reported on an evil scruge maybe, but portrayed
that evil scruge as encompassing far more than it really does. 20/20 heard
about something that even a lot of people in the SF scence would probably
be shocked by if it was true (10 years olds strung out on e in Flordia? 
If that's true, that certainly isn't the same scence I am part of.. But 
the thing is I couldn't tell how much of that report was sensationalism 
and how much was accurate). But they didn't report on any of the aspects 
that we have come to know as raves, especially the underground raves that 
they were supposedly talking about... So 20/20 did a real good job at 
alientating those who go to raves and parents. They drew a division in a 
segment of the population of ravers and their parents for who raves are one 
thing and what 20/20 portrayed is another. In trying to "protect" teenagers 
(or maybe protect parents feelings?), 20/20 increased the division 
between parents and teenagers though providing parents with a view of 
"reality" that was not the same reality that the teens experienced. The 
parents assume the teen is lying because the 20/20 report made raves out 
to be, as I think Wayne said, drug distribution networks.

There's been a problem with ants lately in the office building I work
at  in Redwood Shores.  Seems with all the rain, they've been taking
refuge in the offices.  The building management has tried spraying, but
to no avail, so they sent out a memo to ask us all to not leave food or
empty soda cans laying out.

The line I found funny was:

"...Above all, don't leave goodies such as lefover birthday cake sitting
around overnight.  Our ants then send party invitations to their friends
at Oracle and they have a rave at our expense!"

This leads me to ask a few questions:

1.  Do the ants advertise on SFRaves?  I think Derek has been remiss in
listing these events on the calendar.

2.  Who is spinning for them?  DJ Logcat? 

3.  Are they having problems with tough guy aardvarks showing up and
ruining the vibe?

4.  When someone yells "Raid", are they talking about the cops or the
spray?

5.  When ants say the party is "underground" does that mean it's a
secret or that it's in someone's private anthill?

6.  Do ants wear baggies?

7.  Don't they have to be really careful with the lasers so they don't
burn themselves up?

8.  Now that we know ants rave, shouldn't we be inviting them?  Think
how much easier clean up would be...

As I grow wiser (so I like to think ;)  I'm beginning to understand a 
 friend's comment about picking your fights (or causes) wisely.  So 
 many times I've reacted to situations rather than being proactive.  
 And in the end, did I change anything, or anyone's opinion?  Living by 
 example is probably the best remedy here.

Rather than giving 20/20 cause to react to any negative actions of 
 their judgement  (e.g., mailbombing), why not put some energy into 
 positive enhancements for the rave community?  And then 20/20 and 
 others will pass a new judgement on how creative and affirming raves 
 can be.  Acknowledging our downsides and doing something about it is 
 much more effective.  Proactive examples are:  Geoff White's 
 suggestion of creating a RaveMed team a while back,  Tony Rose's E 
 pamphlet, health & drug education referral tables, setting up benefits 
 that support an aids project or youth center, etc.

Just MHO...

Love and light,
Diane

Justin sez:

The people at 20/20 have the right to believe that the reason they are
recieving all of this childish "spam" is that ravers are mad about their
exposing the truth about raves!!!!!!!
Is this what we are trying to tell them?
Do you really think that mail-bombing 20/20 is going to help our cause?
That's a lot of fucking energy you would be wasting on mundane revenge that
could be used to get out the message of what a rave really means to you.

Isn't that what you call special K?  If so, that's what you give horses
when you need to tranquilize them!!!  And, it is common out east, but
I've only known few people to actually go there.

Special K, or ketamine, is a tranquilizer used for both HUMANS and
ANIMALS...

I agree, it is not a very good drug for a party or to dance on, but the
trip you go on is absolutely amazing! Some people dislike it (mostly
because of what they have heard about it), but I personally thoroughly
enjoyed it, not as a drug to be used often, but it was a very spiritual
journey. I was <underline>completely removed</underline> from my
surroundings, left only with my thoughts, and my God.


Read up on it at hyperreal, there should be a whole bunch of information
there.


-much love

 Well, I hear no denials that TT called the police about the galactic 
sweat lounge. Regardless of what has occured between him and the 
russians, if he did call the police he hurt a lot of innocent ravers. I 
count myself lucky I wasn't there with my equipment while the police were 
ripping through personal belongings.

What does the city hall have to do with bad media??  I dunno, the last
time I did a protest or sit-in outside an official building, it had
something to do with a person who actually had an office inside the
place who was about to make or break an important issue.....

It would be better to do it outside a Media building.

A different Rave angle in a more respected media... </troy>

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Hey, what do you know??  A mainstream article about techno and its actually
positive???

In Yesterday's Wall Street Journal (who knew?) on the front page of the
Marketplace section is an article titled "Will Pulsing 'Techno' Sound Rev Up
Music Business?"

It goes on to talk about sagging record sales of alternative rock last year and
how many major labels are now looking to artists like The Chem. Bros, Prodigy
and Goldie as "the next big thing."  It also discusses the difficulty of
marketing faceless music to the mainstream.  

Sure, people can yell and scream to keep it underground, but at least this WSJ
writer seems to get the fact that the scene is something important and seems to
treat the scene with some respect in the piece.  (sorry i can't type the whole
article for ya)

-Brad   


Here's a couple of excerpts:

"An executive at a major U.S. label sensed the signs of a new market when he
caught a recent New York show by the Chemical Bros, 'The dancing never stopped
and there wasn't a bad vibe in the room"

On the subject or raves and drugs:

"The rave scene still carries with it an association with drugs, the kind needed
to stay up all night and dance.  But as raves and techno music go mainstream,
safer alternatives are appearing.  To counter the stereotype of drugs at raves,
Robb Hart, a co-head of the Watermark label, runs a sister company called Pure
Children, which puts on squeaky-clean raves - complete with security battalions
to check for weapons and drugs.  'The rave scene gets a bad rap,' says Mr. Hart.
'Most kids are there to hold hands.  They are lost and need toold
somebody...It's very communal.'  At the New Year's Eve rave at Ashbury Park,
where teenagers danced from 11-9am to the beat of techno music, 20-year-old
Andrew Deming was on hand for more than just the music.  'What I like about
raving is it's a place you can go for 12 hours and be warm and listen to music
with your friends,' he says. 'You can do what you want and be yourself.  There
aren't many places like that any more."

What about alternative rock and grunge? "Pearl Jam and Soundgarden are all sould
out and cheesy and played out on the radio.  Everybody sounds like them," says
Mr. Deming.

Subject: Spiritual Health

  While reading an article in some book on overall health and well being, I
noticed a section on why it is vital to your health to have some spiritual
aspects to you life.  Without some sense of higher purpose you cannot be
truly healthy.  Part of it read as follows....

          Spiritual health involves your relationship to other living things
and the role of spiritual direction in your life.  This description means
various things to people.  For some people, spiritual health is defined by a
religion.  For others, it involves understanding your individual purpose in
life.  Being spiritually healthy means you are working to achieve your
spiritual potential, to find harmony in living.  You are at peace with
yourself and those around you.

      I suppose this means raving is a valid form of a healthy lifestyle.
 Should this be included in our list of reasons as to why raving is necessary
to people?  The headlines should read something like, "Raving Found to Save
Lives" or "Need to be Healthier?  Go to a Rave".  Not to mention all the
exercise you are getting from dancing all night.   Have a good day.

         hugs,

Did you also know that.

  Ketamine is used for keeping you alive when your dead?
  Yea.. Something like that..  They use it when trying to accomplish the
near death experiance. Yea. When you die.. Some chemical floods the brain
causing brain death..  Well Ketamine slows down the production of that
chemical...

	My take on this is that God/dess manifests any way He/She/It
wants to. Don't put your limits on the forms God can or can't take. 
He/She/It will surprise you every single time. This belief works for
me. Take it if you like, or ignore it if you don't.

	But the story of Ganesh is really beautiful. Did you know 
that He has an elephant's head because His own father, who was also
God, killed Him by cutting His original human head off? Really, you
should understand the myth behind the form before dismissing the form
as silly...

well, scott, i understand where you are coming from, and i actually agree 
with it, but i don't think this really was a war.  and this was a 
different show than the rave show.  but the same idea.  i actually, looking back on this now 
can see that the fax bombing was to sort of egg them on to do a show on 
this company. they (the company owners) i believe wanted them to do the 
show, because 1. it would weed out all the people that are not really 
committed to changing the way "things" are (degrading society, 
environment...etc)   2.  they had john stosle on camera in their 
interview (eq. had their own cameras as well as 20/20) saying "well, if 
what you're saying is true, then there really is no show."  

if anyone doesn't believe me, i have a videotape of john stosle saying 
that.  these were the outtakes that weren't televised to make their story 
the one-sided reporting that they and most of commercial television 
(especially these fancy-looking datelines and 20/20's) like to partake in 
to get the attention of the viewers in an increasingly competitive 
television market.  

true.  it might be a wasted effort individually if people send hate mail 
to 20/20, because they are acting out of revenge, and everyone loses 
there.  but that is no reason to sit back and let them go unchallenged!  
keep them busy answering intellegently directed email and faxes and 
letters from intellegent folx like you sfravers.  thanks!  

thanks for your time scott.  oh, but if you are going to spell my e-mail 
address "deepfrog@hooked.net", could you please change the "Deepfog 
wrote" to "Deepfrog wrote?"  i won't receive the mail, but at least it is 
consistently funny!  

Thanks and hugz to all---peace out 97, deepfog

Dear 2020,
     My name is Dorena C. Bernabe and I am from San Jose, California. I'm 21
yrs old and I go to school and work full-time. I am also a full-time raver
     I started raving 3 yrs ago, because of my love of house music and of
people. I was tired of going to clubs that were like meat markets. I was 
also
tired of the violence that could errupt at anytime in clubs because of mass
alcohol consumption. In the rave scene, I found a place where i could just
have a good time. I was able to dance all night without being hassled by
drunken men or anyone else. I raved because of the positive vibe that was
present.
     I won't deny that there are drugs in the scene. But, i will say that
true ravers don't need drugs to have a good time. We have fun whether we are
sober or we are on Ecstasy or any other drug. you don't stick out like a 
sore
thumb if you are not on drugs ar a rave. The only way you stick out, is if
you have a negative attitude. If you rave just for the drugs, then you are
raving for the wrong reasons. Raving is all about PLUR. PLUR stands for
Peace, Love, Unity, and Respect.
     I won't deny that I do drugs on occasion, but that isn't the reason why
I rave. If I were in it just for the drugs, I would have burned out a long
time ago. Drugs get old fast. I rave because I love house music and I love 
to
dance. When I have been grooving for close to 6 hours to some good house
beats, I feel uplifted. House music is like the gospel to me. When I listen
and dance to it, it's tremendously religious. i experience inner peace when 
I
am raving. I know that a lot of kids that rave feel the exact same way I do.
We rave because we love the music and we love our scene.
    I am livid that your report is going to cast raving in a very negative
light. You never look for the positivity that makes raving what it is. Your
report is misinforming the general public about our scene. The drugs don't
factor into the experience. If you wanted to know about raving, then you
should have gone to some real raves and looked for real ravers. They would
tell you what it is all about. It's about PLUR.
     If you decide to do a follow up piece to your report, I would be more
than happy to participate in it. Here is my addres and my phone number:
Dorena C. Bernabe

   i agree with diane on this, we should be spreading a positive message.
that is what raving is all about...positivity. if we don't want to be
misrepresented by the media, then we need to educate them in a mature manner.
that's just MHO.

And I'll tell ya what: More influental people read the WSJ and take it
to heart. Unlike 20/20.

It's alllll good.

Now it's time to take this bull by the horns and be active in this
comming era of CCCapitalism. We slaved to helpe create the emerging
sound, now it's time to get some of that back. You all deserve to make a
living doing something you love (Like me). Now is the time.

If Wall Street is calling, awnser it.

Okay i have to give my $2 (hey, it's in canadian funds) on this whole 
thing.  A friend and i were discussing the raves/bad media/drugs issue 
etc. and the fact is, that a very large proportion of people who go to 
raves take illegal drugs.  There are NOT many people who go sXe.  This is 
a fact you must accept, and the media jumps on it because it's very 
true.  Also, many of the younger kids who are out at these events are 
taking substances which they have no information about, and they don't 
even know the ppl they're purchasing from.  I'm sure you will also admit 
that this is true.  

The whole angle of the media reports that i have seen have been aimed
straight at the "normal" parents, who are a HUGE majority in this country. 
If you had a child, regardless of your view on the scene, would you like
to be told that your ten-year-old was out somewhere without your knowledge
ingesting something that could be anything?  Even i shudder when i 
visualize this scenario, and i'm a fairly regular drug-user.

The fact is, having raves is no more a "right" than having a giant 
unauthorized alcohol festival.  Cops would shut that down just as fast, 
for pretty much the same reasons, and the press would cover them in the 
same way.

I too wish that we could all party undisturbed and that everyone who went 
raving was intelligent and responsible abou;the drugs they choose to 
ingest, if any.  But this just ain't gonna happen in today's 
instant-gratification let's-do-it-NOW-who-cares-about-the-consequences 
society.  What all the negative mdeia WILL do, however, is to help keep 
the giant money-sucking huge 4,000+ gigs down and help the smaller, 
undergroubd scene to blossom and grow.  That's not so bad, IMHO.

 Vaguely. I was really busy!! I mostly remember the guy dressed as a VERY 
realistic looking Klingon. One of the security people (the tall coked out 
one) had him tucked under his arm and was carrying him out the door. The 
"Klingon" had his arms poised like Superman flying as he was being carried. 
Too funny!

 No fry for me that night.

 That must have been Seofon. His hair is cropped very short in certain

 I'm so happy! Thank you to for helping me to remeber the event that 
really kicked off my raving. Interesting side note; The person who hired 
me for Lighthouse 2 was at GaiaMind. I havn't seen him in about two years. 
It was a powerful night in many ways. I am still glad I was a part of it.

peace ya all,

To the Cloud Factory People:
Is it possible for you guyz to send some tickets to Solid Grooves
because, I know of many ravers here in the South Bay that can't drive all
the way up to Oakland to purchase tickets.

Also, I have a question about the tickets. Some people are telling me
that it is pre-sale only and some people say that pre-sale is just
cheaper and that you can buy tickets at the map. Can anyone clarify it
for me please?

PLUR,
Paul

 Hi Regina!  ]=)


 First off let me say that I appreciate your response as well as all the 
others. Each has shown me something and taught me something. And more 
than a little healing has occured.  :)

 I would just like to respond to a few things you mention;



 On Tue, 28 Jan 1997, Regina Flores wrote:

 True, but as any other group there is a mix. Some good, some bad, most 
pretty middle of the road. Of course this is all relative within each 
group. One groups good may not make that same label in another group.


>  If someone
> stole a cord that's too bad.

 I'm sorry if I'm misinterperting your intention here but that sounds 
pretty callous. Cables are not cheap (typically from $20 up to a $100 or 
more). I am really poor. Each cable has been carefully considered for 
it's need and worth in my equipment reality. When the cable enters my 
reality it is cared for in a very tender fashion (much to the dismay of 
those that work with me  :). There is a whole cable-zen philosophy I 
have adopted with cables. And what I do with my equipment is as close to 
a religious ceromony as I come to in public. (most of my personal 
religious stuff I tend to in private)

 Not to mention _who_ stole it. A person who insisted I was her friend. 
Someone I helped right after she left an abusive boyfriend. Someone I was 
very attracted to but never asked out or made a pass at her BECAUSE 
she had just left an abusive relationship.


>  There are many other beautiful deeds that
> have been done at raves.

 True. A lot of it done with my equipment. I have worked a lot of free 
parties, benefits, supplied a back-up spot for a birthday girl I didn't 
know. I'm probably much more aware of beautiful deeds done at raves then 
you are by virtue of how long I've been doing it and my level of 
commitment to the scene.


>  Look, we do not need to dwell in the past, because
> life is too short.

 So who is dwelling?

>  Let the natural world of Karma take care of the
> punishing.

 I am part of that natural world of Karma. Why is it if the world does 
something out of Karma it is okay, but not if a person does something as 
an agent of Karma?


>  In the mean time don't lend things out that are too expensive or
> valuable that will ruin your expieriance at the rave if they get lost.

 Sure. Then people start headtripping me on how I'm not supporting the 
scene and such. As I stated; due to certain fuckups I am not lending my 
equipment out. I never wanted to in the first place but I always want to 
help a party go off. I guess I'm just stupid that way.


> Remember the whole purpose behind raves and why we put so much time and
> energy into making them happen.

 I think that is different for everyone. I know I have more than one 
reason why I put up with so many jerks and problems. Sure. Take the easy 
way out and say "Randy, it's just a reflection of you." or "If you don't 
like it don't do it". Except for every thief, jerk and idiot there are a 
hundred shinying people who love what I'm doing. I'm there for them. And 
the challenges of the problem people and problems are like a mountain to 
climb for me. I want to make it work despite the problems.  :) Just the 
capricorn in me I guess.

 Exactly. That is why I'm calling an alert on this individual. So the 
rest of us who are working so hard at providing revolutionary change in 
society _have_ a chance to do it. Whenever we get hit by these kind of 
people it slows down the process. Although I'm starting to believe that 
this situation is another aspect of the evolution of society.

 Well Dionysus Dreams is allways accepting donations for new equipment (I 
could really use a van!!  :) 

 The cord was returned two days later by the person who "misplaced" it. 
And the person who originally borrowed it had already agreed to replace 
it if neccessary. Which is MUCH more than what the individual entrusted 
with it offered (not even an apology).

 I'm not distracted. I'm far to busy working two jobs and being a full 
time university student AND raving, to be caught up in such a petty thing 
as a missing cable. Again it's not so much the cable but how I was 
treated by someone who called me her friend. My way of shedding light was 
to reveal what occured;     "and the truth shall set you free"

 Thank you!  =) Despite the fact I may not agree with you (and others) on 
certain issues, I deeply appreciate the effort and time people have taken 
to talk about this situation.

in Love and humility,

special K is a SCARY drug.  it's almost like being on 3 bottles of 
robitussin DM.

leary did claim LSD to be a "cure" for homosexuality in an mid 60's
issue of Playboy, but i think this was more of a plug to get your
average straight up college boy to try it out...  look what happened
over the next several years...  in other books by Leary, he seems pretty
pro-gay rights...

fucking, fucking and more fucking... clueless in regards to your partner
as potential genetic collaborator... this has nothing to do with race or
creed... it's about timing and chemistry... if you're going to link up
your astral bodhies, you have to be fully conscious about what you are
going to cross fertilize with... this is based in Leary's adoption of
tantrist principles...

And why not?  especially in comparison to the vices that menopausal
middle aged white men condone...

It is when boredom as a way of life is imposed on free-spirited

if you were a menopausal middle age white man, you might feel
differently...
this is past their prime... it basically is a statement against the
elderly, or dying generation which is trying to control the chaos that
makes up the learning experience of the new youth...  as if they know
what's really going on in the world...

Leary had a thing about the generation born before the atomic bomb being
dropped on Hiroshima... that was when the quantum leap occurred...  i
haven't quite figured it out yet, so if anyone else might have any
inclination towards why he felt this way i welcome any suggestions...

It is a SCARY but enjoyable trip.  I've tried almost every psychidelic drug
available and K has some profound effects to the mind, body, and soul.
Imagine being separated from your body, you're only a soul, alone.... Then
you see yourself lying down on the floor not breathing.... you try to make
yourself breathe and your body responds even tho you're 2 feet away from it.
On other times i would be able to channel my senses to a single part of my
body, like being able to concentrate my soul on that part.  It is an amazing
trip but it often scares me, like acid.    If you plan on doing any kind of
drug please read up on it before you do anything, specially K.  Make sure
you are prepared for the kind of journey that i have described and make sure
you are physically, emotionally, spiritually, and mentally fit and remember
the powers of positive thinking.

	Shortly after receiving all my E-mail from,
	    (Tuesday, January 28, 1997 7:16 PM)
			    to
		  (Tuesday, January 28, 1997 11:33 PM)

	Before I even read the first new message, my screen turns
	all blue nStuff.. Zapp, Pow! 
	And there was some weird writing on the screen to.  Words
	like; 000:111111 and C-0112 .. 

	Unfortunetly this failed attempt at communication,
	from what I beleive to be some kind of computer
	bug, actually living inside my system. He was able
	to execute his second objective, to gather information.
	That bug took four hours worth of my E-Mail. Yankt
	it right from my virtual memory banks before Mr. Pentium
	even had a chance to write it down on old faithfull HDD!

	Could my dear ole friends re-send them lost E-Mails please?

	Thanx
	Jeff

Heh ;)  Glad you have a sense of humour about it.

Sounds like I jumped in without really knowing the background.  Sorry
about that.  On the other hand, I do believe in "taking the high road"
whenever possible, although like most, I struggle to practice what I
preach.

Something that your response made me realize, is that taking the high
road doesn't mean never doing anything annoying or even possibly illegal.
There are probably laws against fax-bombing someone, but that doesn't
_make_ it inherently injurious to do so (what a revelation that is),
and if it can help you acheive your goals, so be it.  But, watch
yer karma-meter =)

This discussion is probably stretching the bounds of rave-relatedness,
I hoped to provide some moderation for the brewing mod mentality
("bomb 'em, yeah, we'll show 'em").

Peace,

 Gee. Threats. What a swell bunch of guys. From what I hear TT is in the 
hospital. Thanks to you folks? You sure make it sound that way. Due to 
that AND the threat you made publicly, I will not attend any of your 
parties and I will encourage others to boycott you also.

There *is* a protest party like this, or may be, coming up in March,
scheduled I think for the SF Federal Building.  The protest focus is
actually the Ward Valley radioactive waste dump, following a similar event
last year in LA.  But it would be a good opportunity for any other sort of
raver protest you might want to make.

This is a little different from the original suggestion, which was more
like a civil disobedience thing--deliberately and overtly breaking the
rules you're protesting against--but they might complement each well.
Sit-in/public communication all day, then barricade the doors and rage all
night...

yo scott, wassup?  good discussion here.  actually seems like we BOTH 
learned some stuff nstuff (yo jeff!) and you're right!  the best thing we 
can do is make sure we're not acting these things out of vengeance.  
why?  it'll bring negative energy in yer life.  like there's not enough 
of that floating around already.  it's funny cause i was just thinking 
about that 20/20 tape i have, and it opens up with the 20/20 theme...you 
know, da-da-dada...this is 20/20.  i still strongly believe we are going 
to be dancing under the stars LONG after 20/20 is in syndicated reruns.  

but like the subject line says, this is about all i can offer to the sfr 
community.  i have a business to run and spinning to do and people to 
enbalm, so if any of you want to discuss this with the deepfog, well, 
maybe you wanna email me direct cause there's a lot of threads poppin up 
and im not cool yet with like eudora or nothin...so i get tired of 
pressing delete!  

anyway, it's been good.  was it as good for me as it was for you?  
[scorpio humor]

later spot!  hey say hi to tom z.  for me ok?

i can see how this would be somewhat true.  theres' so many straight and 
gay boyz and girlz that have trouble stepping out of their tunnel reality 
(whaddya mean, tunnel vision?)  and LSD is a valid way of getting those

This account is entirely personal.


Special K and Nitrous Oxide are very looked down upon by many people -
such as though speed is. I have tried many drugs, including the three I
had just mentioned. Now speed has never done anything outstanding for me
(besides keeping me awake when my body NEEDS sleep) =oP , and I had told
you in an earlier message that I really enjoyed the Special K trips I
have had. Here are my thoughts on Nitrous Oxide.


Nitrous Oxide is (like many drugs) safe, if you are being careful. This
drug, like K, is not a great drug for doing at parties. I hate Whip-its
(the little whip cream compressor carteidges), but medical grade nitrous
oxide has had a profound effect on my life. 


Most people I know like taking in a breath of nitrous and getting that
WA-WA-WA-WA sound, and maybe getting a little dizzy. I know that the
psychedelic effects happen during the disorienting awakening after you
have passed out.


This may disgust some of you, but it is my personal likening, and I am
not reccomending it for anyone. 


Unlike other psychedelics, every time I pass out on nitrous, I awakening
to an amazing discovery, and all of a sudden I start to see how/why
everything is the way it is. After I pass out the second time, it is like
an extension of the first, and I get another piece of the puzzle. This
happens in subsequent times, each an extension of those before it. It
takes very few times for the whole picture to come together. 


The last time I did nitrous (in early 1996) I put together the puzzle
that is everything, yes EVERYTHING. I had passed out twice, when I
realized someone, something, trying to tell me something... and every
time I passed out I learned more. After passing out four times I got very
excited, yet very scared. I knew that the next time I passed out I was to
learn something very exciting, <italic> </italic>I was to know the thread
that is to hold everything together.


Yes, I found out. 


STAY TUNED.


hence the name,

i was talking with an esteemed colleague raver friend of mine the other 
night and it reminded me that someday i will have a few little deepfogs 
(or deepfoguettes) ribbit  running around my house, here's a little poem 
from an anonymous source i picked up in my travels, and i want to share 
this with you guys...

=====================
PLEASE, MOM AND DAD...
 
My hands are small
I don't mean to spill my milk
 
My legs are short
Please slow down so I can keep up with you
 
Don't slap my hands
When I touch something bright and pretty
I don't understand
 
Please look at me when I talk
It lets me know you are really listening
 
My feelings are tender, don't nag me all day
Let me make mistakes without feeling stupid
 
Don't expect the bed I make 
Or the picture I draw to be perfect
Just love me for trying
 
Remember I am a child, not a small adult
Sometimes I don't understand 
What you are saying
 
I love you so much, 
Please love me for being me
Not just for things I can or cannot do

Hi SFR!

Well, a sit-in sounds like it would get lots of attention, but I think in
order to get what we want, we've gotta do what we do best.... party! I
think what we need to do is make a major statement that focuses our
positivity into the community. Something like Food not Bombs, but bigger!
If the public sees us consistently trying to make a difference in the
community, they'll be more likely to support our party habit.

Ivan

okay, so i think i want to go to this party if i decide that going to 
san louis obisbo is too much of a hassle... but i have a slight problem 
that i'm hoping one of the promoters can help me out with.. or maybe 
one of the dj's.. big hint macadio!!! =)  please, i really need to get 
to this party if i don't go to slo.. write me as soon as possible, 
okay??? =)  thanks everyone!

                               much love,
                                anissa..

oh, and about this whole 20/20 thing ( i know, it's getting old! ).. i 
wrote this sort of essay type thing about my experience with the scene, 
and my creative writing teacher thinks i should send it to them because 
it would probably open up their eyes a little bit.. so maybe i'll fax 
it to them.. does anyone have the number? and are they just going to 
ignore it, or will they really read it? thanks...

annissa

20/70's fax number is 212-456-2969.  and will they listen to you?  it 
depends on what you mean by listening.  you'll get a form letter, but 
most people haven't been properly trained to actually sit, watch, listen 
and understand someone else's point of view.  but i would send it.  hey 
send it to me privately, and i will read, listen...blah blah blah.  no 
really please send it to me privately.  would love to see it.  

thanks,
fog

I only know what I have read, and read as much as I can on subjects that
interest me. I have been under the impression that nitrous oxide is not
toxic (prompting doctors/dentists to use it). I have never studied these
subjects scholastically, so i am forwarding this reply to my message...

To my rudementry knowlage...

N2(subscript)O displaces the oxygen to the brain at an alarming rate.
O2(subscript) 'sits' at the bottom of the lungs allowing minimal oxygen
to enter the brain... (hence the feeling of going
away-way-way-ay-ay-ay....).  Yes without O2(subscript) braincells die,
this is a fact, but at the same time braincells die, say, smoking
tobacco (or other leafy substances), consuming alcohol ect al.  When the
person, "passes out" then the body does what it is used to doing,
breathing... bringing the person back.  N2O is dangerious if one were to
pass out sucking on a tube. =20

but then again, we all figure ways to validate our desires...

Hm.  Back when homosexuality was still considered a "condition" that
could be remedied.  I'll cut him some slack, I suppose. ;)

To quote another person on this list out of context: "It's allllll
good!"
What's natural and what's man-modified or strictured are two different
things.  "Astral bodies", "tantrist principles", these are all concepts.
What's *natural* is, as you put it, fucking, fucking, and more fucking.  
The problem with sex in media is you rarely see any protrayal of the 
emotion that belongs with sex.  As for genetics, fucking and reproducing 
are two separate issues.  Humans are not the only species that use sex 
the way we do, for fun, manipulation, and reproduction.  Look at the
Bonobo
chimps.  There are many studies on their social interactions and the
part
sex plays therein.

Geez, I *hate* those menopausal middle aged white men!  ;)
But my point is, I don't think anyone of any intelligence would take
MMAWM's vices or LSD and call any of them "life-giving".

That assumes that boredom can be imposed.  I'm a free person and so are
you.  It's been noted many times, not the least of which in the 
Declaration of Independence, that power is derived from the consent of
the governed.  In other words, they only have power over you if you
give it to them.  To quote Will Rogers, "People are about as happy as
they make up their minds to be."  Your life is as boring as you make 
it.

When you are a MMAWM, maybe you'll look at the youth and think, "Damn,
I was just like that, and ya know what?  I could find my ass with
both hands and a road map!"  We are, each of us, thinking intelligent
beings (well, most of us anyway), and we can make our own choices, but
we should not be guilty of the very crime of which we accuse our 
elders, that of having a closed mind.  We should draw on the 
experience of those that came before us.  That's not to say that we
shouldn't periodically stand up and say, "Uh, Grandpa, the [Escape]
key will let prisoners escape from prison.  Honest."  But we also
shouldn't ignore facts just because we want to have one kind of fun.

Just my $1.25....

ROTFL! One summer years back..."friends" had access to the georgetown
hospital medical grade 6 lb tanks...many a time did I "figure everything
out" to forget it the moment the wawas were gone...although I didnt really
notice a lasting effect on my consciousness like some psychadelics...

Actually, it's funny you said that...

One time I was acting stupid with nitrous, I woke up with people everywhere
standing, looking at me, thinking I was dead there were sirens, and I saw
flashing lights off of the ambulence. I had to jump to my feet so that I
could prove I was not dead. After about two seconds, and a little more
reality settled in, I found that the people around me weren't looking, they
were dancing. The sirens were coming from the music that the DJ was
spinning, and the lights were, well, a sunflower and an i-beam.

Hello every  body,
	I wanted to ask some of you for an interpretation of an article
about the influx of "musica electronica". I can't tell if it is pro or 
con. Do you suppose some of the liberal periodicals could enlighten us
with legal advice? All thoughts are well-come.

I'm not going to debate whether nitrous gives you cancer or whether it will
make you give birth to Jesus. As I stated in my first mailing I am not
reccomending the use of this drug to anyone, I like it, it has had more a
profound effect on my beliefs, loves, and character than any other drug. I
have had no desire to use it since that experience, such was the same with
acid (unless i find l-25 again), but that's not saying I will not do it again.

He was probably referring to the "Hell No!" Burning Man party, which
featured the opportunity to sell one's soul to Hellco among other

You are welcome to have your opinions on LSD, But...

Please don't assume your views on LSD are the same as everybody else's.

They are not.

In fact, the above blanket statement seems to indicate a lack of intelligence 
on your part.  How do you know what other intelligent people think about
something so complex as LSD?

People always say..
 They understand life more after taking drugs or what not...
But if you really think about it. It's all stuff you already realized long
ago.

    I think...
    But they shore did bring out my extra sensitive awareness skills
though.

And Nitrous. Safe is hardly the word to discribe something that pops
thousands of brain cells in just one puff.

Jeff
I remember back in the days.. There used to be house parties w/ 4ft tall
canasters full of compressed Nitro.. Two bucks at the door.. Thoughs were
the days..  =]

If nitrous is a neurotoxin, then why does the government permit dentists
to administer it to children?

Here's the real story:  nitrous will indirectly result in the death
of brain cells if you asphyxiate yourself with it (i.e. recycle the gas
through a balloon for a minute or more).
It is also a heavy gas, which means it sinks to the bottom of your lungs
and can reside there for quite a while.=20

But no, nitrous is not neurotoxic.

We have reggae in the park, why not have raves in the park and donate
the proceeds to good causes? The rave community can help itself and all
the other oppressed communities at once, hey, even extend the sense of
community and maybe even help save the planet.  Kudos to those who threw
Gaiamind and One Tribe this past week.

I know that music can do a lot of things, but somebody please help me here...


I have heard in years past that there are vibrational frequencies that can
induce euphoria, and even orgasms. If there are, where can I buy the record?

Now you've heard it direct from a chemist.  Nitrous is toxic.  You get
high 
because it deadens brain cells.  If you experience hallucinations, it's
due 
to the toxic effect.  What more do you need?

I voyaged all the way to Fortuna (near Eureka) to be-in at Tu b'Shevat
seder for Headwaters Forest on Sunday. 

The level of spirituality was incredible. An activist group of "redwood
rabbis" prayed and called for Hurwitz to live by the principles of his
religion and, to not just stop the clearcutting, but to begin restoring
the forest. The seder was staged in a beautiful ancient grove. The sense
of community and spirituality peaked as we told tree stories to each
other (thanks for sharing your story, Dawn) and later, as we ventured
out alone into the grove, to hug trees and reflect. All the best people
were there, some even glittered out, including some new friends from
S.F., my friend Adam and his friends from Santa Cruz, Darryl Cherney and
other Earth First!ers, and other children of the earth visiting from
Seattle. Our act of civil disobedience, to plant redwood saplings on
Pacific Lumber property and begin the restoration, resulted in no
arrests or police presence, in spite of the company's refusal to grant
permission to do so and the history of strict enforcement of trespassing
laws.

If not for the absence of driving beats, although there was some joyful
dancing nevertheless, I'd say I'd just been to a rave. 

plur,

You're absolutely right, Troy.  What I should have said, rather than
assuming that all intelligent people would consistently think
intelligent
thoughts, was that the concept that LSD was "life-giving" was ludicrous.
There are no "life-giving" aspects to hallucinogenics.  It's a fun
ride, but then so is a roller-coaster, and there's no "life-giving"
properties there.  Could roller-coaster change your views, give you a 
new and healthy respect for life?  Yeah, I'm sure a really scarey one
could.  But "life-giving"?  Absolutely not.  Thanks for straightening 
me out.

re-lig-ion... from the latin root word "lig" as in "ligament" meaning
something that binds or ties. A one (wo)man religion is by definition a
contradiction in terms, because the very word "religion" implies that it is
a set of shared beliefs and traditions that bring a group of participants
together, allowing them to share a common discourse which facilitates more
effective communication and allows for stronger interpersonal bonds.

I think that guy meant "spirituality." One of the eight central
"commandments" of buddhism is "right speech," meaning be damn careful of
what you say so your thoughts are not misunderstood or misinterpreted and
your mind not polluted by your own imprecise use of language. Many people
(including myself) believe that the human mind/consciousness is DEFINED by
language and grammar, meaning that fundamentally, english speakers THINK
differently than speakers of other languages. (e.g.: all those inuit words
for "snow" or the existence of "proper" forms of address in languages like
french)

Just being a total nitpicky bastard,

Great Idea!!!

But it would really be hard to charge people, you could take donations.
People already play drums in the park on Hippie hill on Sat and Sunday
afternoons.  Hippie hill and Chrissy field would be a good place...I see
alot of the same people at parties and at the park drumming....it would
work, except if it rains.  You may need permission from the park people,
whatever it's called.

 ummm, from what I have heard the frequency that is needed to resonate 
with the body in such a way as to cause orgasms is somewhere between 7 
and 8 Hz. Which is far lower than the human ear can percieve (the lowest 
frequency being about 20 Hz. but usually a little higher around 25 to 30 Hz. 
Everybody hears a little differently so some variations exist) and lower 
than most sound systems can reproduce.

 This frequency can be "faked" with audio trickery. 7 Hz. just means the 
cycle repeats 7 times a secound. If you make something go "ping" once a 
secound and then speed it up to 7 times a secound you should (in theory) 
be able to reproduce the resonating frequency sought after.

 WARNING! The resonate frequency for the human bowels (again allowing for 
individual differences) is in the same area (7 Hz. to 8 Hz.). Be careful! 
In any case have a towel handy.  ;)

 Devo supposedly did an experimental concert where they pumped enough 
bowl-resonating frequencys to have an effect on the whole audience. They 
handed out diapers at the door and made shower facilities available.

As per request there will be 25 tickets at Solid Grooves by this 
afternoon...they are $5 each.

Tickets are $5 dollars all around, no price increases or anything like 
that, although you do have to bring a can of food to the party to donate.
Everyone will have to go the map point but it is possible (maybe even 
likely ?  =) that the tickets will all sell so we just encourage early 
purchase, plus we'd like to avoid money handling as much as possible the 
day of the party, due to the recent string of busts.

Sounds like a drug commercial with a slightly different spin:

Yeah, I heard somethin' about that on Hard Copy....I guess one of the

trip". (Rave version of show and tell).... In had a funky glow-stick handle
so everyone was checking it When the hardcore breaks came down and laser
lights were shootin' all around the main room and surrounding the
colony.....well, let's just say.....after the sizzling stopped and the smoke
cleared....there were *no* survivors.

 Essentially, the dangers are from prolonged exposure (dentists in poorly 
ventilated offices) and lack of oxygen.


A PRIMER OF DRUG ACTION: Robert M. Julien:
"Occasionally, certain anesthetic agents become misused drugs. Nitrous
oxide is an example. A gas of low anesthetic potency, it is incapable of
inducing deep levels of anesthesia if an adequate oxygen concentration
is maintained. Nitrous oxide induces a state of behavioral
disinhibition, analgesia, and euphoria. One of the problems occasionally
encountered when nitrous oxide is used for recreational purposes is
that, unless the compound is administered with at least 20 percent
oxygen, hypoxia (decreased oxygen content of the blood) can be induced.
But in order to achieve high enough concentrations of nitrous oxide to
get a good behavioral effect, concentrations of 50 percent or greater
must be inhaled. If such concentrations are mixed with room air, inhaled
oxygen concentartions drop to low levels and the hypoxia may result in
irreversible brain damage."


Weil & Rosen:
"Physicians and dentists have long considered nitrous oxide to be a safe 
pharmacological agent. Nevertheless, there is some evidence that 
excessive or prolonged use of it can damage the bone marrow and nervous 
system by interfering with the action of vitamin B-12. Moreover its use 
in nonmedical settings presents several hazards that users should keep in 
mind. Breathing it directly from pressurized tanks is dangerous for two 
reasons. First, gas flowing from such tanks is very cold -- cold enough 
to cause frostbite of noses, lips and (most serious) vocal cords. Being 
anesthetized, a user may be unaware of such injuries until too late. 
Second, because nitrous oxide does not support life, it should be mixed 
with oxygen if it is to be breathed for more than a few minutes. At 
private parties, oxygen tanks are rarely supplied, and people have died 
of asphyxiation by breathing straight nitrous oxide through face masks. 
One way to avoid these dangers is to fill balloons from tanks and breathe 
from the balloons. 

'Further, nitrous oxide rapidly leads to complete loss of motor control, 
and anyone who breathes it while standing will soon reel about and fall 
down. Therefore, it is unwise to try the gas unless one is in a 
comfortable sitting or lying position. Serious injuries have resulted 
from people inhaling laughing gas while standing in front of open 
windows, when driving cars or when operating machinery. Others have been 
badly hurt by accidentally pulling heavy tanks of nitrous oxide over onto 
themselves while intoxicated. 

'People who breathe nitrous oxide for more than a few minutes at a time 
may experience nausea, especially if they have just eaten. They may also 
feel hung over for some time after. Addiction to nitrous oxide is a real 
possibility. Addicts may suffer serious mood and personality changes in 
addition to the bone marrow and nervous system damage already mentioned."

>it has been called one of the most psychedelic experiences around

  you are right to question that - ketamine's not a psychedelic, it's a 
disassociative.

Ding!  Thank you, Randy, for pointing this out.  Saying "Karma will take
care of it" often means that you are dodging responsibility for dealing
with an uncomfortable problem, by letting the person get away with
crummy behavior, and hoping the next person who gets screwed somewhere
down the line will punish the offender.

It's just a nice way of saying "Well, someone's going to punish them
eventually, and they deserve it, but I'm not willing to do the
punishing."  Shit!  Take some responsibility, people!

So you see a 16 year old take your ticket at the door.
You see tons of younger people ingesting way too many of the drugs 
they know nothing about. 
This upsets you. 
However, instead of quitting your scene, or trying to shove these 
kids out the door, why not help educate them?
I know that *I* Have read enough about my MDMA LSD and whatnot but it always 
surprises me when someone goes "MDMA? whats THAT? " and they're Eing 
their asses off. It also upsets me as well, because it's a friend of 
mine that is ingesting something without even caring what it does to their body.
	SO instead of saying "HEY you are UNINFORMED GET OUT!" why 
don't we say, "HEY you are UNINFORMED< here is some information!"
If these people don't have access to hyperreal for all the drug 
archives, or don't know about books regarding drugs, why not create a 
pamphlet called "what E/LSD does to you" and pass it out at parties? I 
know that *I* have spent many an hour sitting in a chill room 
explaining the affects of E and acid on your brain and what's the 
best after-vitamins etc.. And the post about not being down with a 
scene of uneducated kids made me realize it worrys me too. So hey, 
I'm up for creating a pamphlet mlike this to hand out.. and to leave 
in parts of the party... The only drawbacks I see of a pamphlet of 
thse sorts is 1) if cops bust the party and these flyers are scattered on the
ground and 2) giving the flyer to someone and they get REALLY 
offended or something (the second i should hope wouldnt happen). 
	So, I guess a pamphlet mi9ght be part of the solution.. if 
anyone's down, let me know, i'd be more than happy to make it and copy 
it and distribute it..
Otherwise, hope you'rea ll having a great week!
love and hugs,
LAra

  Yes, these cellebrations tend to be very spirtiual.  Try a Havdalah
ceremony in the woods, or Rosh Chodesh, which is coming up on the 30th of
Shevat.  Have an enlightening day.

I voyaged all the way to Fortuna (near Eureka) to be-in at Tu b'Shevat
seder for Headwaters Forest on Sunday. 

The level of spirituality was incredible. An activist group of "redwood
rabbis" prayed and called for Hurwitz to live by the principles of his
religion and, to not just stop the clearcutting, but to begin restoring
the forest. The seder was staged in a beautiful ancient grove. The sense
of community and spirituality peaked as we told tree stories to each
other (thanks for sharing your story, Dawn) and later, as we ventured
out alone into the grove, to hug trees and reflect. All the best people
were there, some even glittered out, including some new friends from
S.F., my friend Adam and his friends from Santa Cruz, Darryl Cherney and
other Earth First!ers, and other children of the earth visiting from
Seattle. Our act of civil disobedience, to plant redwood saplings on
Pacific Lumber property and begin the restoration, resulted in no
arrests or police presence, in spite of the company's refusal to grant
permission to do so and the history of strict enforcement of trespassing
laws.

If not for the absence of driving beats, although there was some joyful
dancing nevertheless, I'd say I'd just been to a rave. 

plur,

I didn't know parties needed to have a public assembly permit.  Alright,
let's see how ignorant I really am:  can someone please give me a list of
 all the permits needed to throw a legal party?

So, Lightseed kids, if the public assembly thing is so hard to get a hold
of, what's you're secret?  By the way, you guys are my inspiration!  That
was One of the most beautiful parties I've ever been to!

I think the term we all need to be thinking about here is "Tikkun", the
hebrew word for "Restoration".  It is a deeply spiritual word, one that we
should keep in mind in our daily lives and when we dance.  Isn't it nice to
know that we can actually learn something from the Judeo-Christian
tradition?

We could make it an even better cause!  My friends Leila had this idea
long ago:  have a protest party that is also a potluck/food drive for the
homeless.  Let's show people that 1) we're serious about our parties and
2) our goal is to promote love.  Leila wanted to make a sign that says,
"Raves are not drugfests, they're lovefests".

Dear All;

	I've personally tried in a couple of times, thanks to a Blip. It's
a comfortable bent reality; where speed when smoked is just bent. I felt
mentally connected to everyone in the room that was doing it, and really
needed to do heavy mental processing regarding my profound experience
afterword; but people didn't seem to be into it.

	I changed form; I felt like I became a liquid, then a gas, and
then a solid; like every molcule of my body was broken down into it's
smallest components; then suddenly sent across the universe, back, and
then reassembled. Time; though only 15 minutes of real-time passed, this
experienced seemed to take hours. 

	During the experience there were times that I couldn't comprehend
what was happening to me and almost quietly freaked out; like I had
completely forgotten what it was like to be solid, a human in the material
world. Just remember and say to yourself before you do it, that you will
be fine in a few minutes and that nothing bad is going to happened to you,
even if it seems like hours. 

	Try it, experience it, with people you trust, people who will be
interested in hearing your feelings afterwords, without judgement; BUT
READ MY LIPS PEOPLE; I STRONGLY SUGGEST NOT MAKING A HABIT OUT OF IT!!!!!
I've met a few heavy long term users of this drug, and they appear to have
a disease/symptomology similar to narc-co-leps-c(uncontrolable sleep),
that they feel was caused by their frequent and repeated use of this drug. 

	So have fun peoples, and use your head; don't lose it; and when it
stops being fun, I'll be waiting in NA for you; ready with a big smile & a 
hug.

Peace & Love
Brian

Music silenced in Net copyright war  -
http://www.australian.aust.com/computer/fulltext/c0129a.htm


           By RICHARD JINMAN 

           JANUARY 29: Song lyrics and music files have been removed from Web
           sites at two Australian universities in the first round of a
crackdown on
           copyright infringement on the Internet.

           Solicitors acting for the Australasian Mechanical Copyright Owners
           Society (AMCOS) and the Australian Music Publishers Association
           Limited (AMPAL) wrote to vice-chancellors at Monash University and
           the University of Western Sydney demanding the removal of material
           from four Web sites.

           AMCOS believes such copyright infringement is widespread and claims
           the action will be the first of many.

           The campaign has outraged sections of the Internet community who
           believe the sites promote music as well as satisfying fans. For
           universities it raises new questions about the policing of Web
sites.

           Professor Peter Darvall, a deputy vice-chancellor at Monash, said
           copyright infringement was a "distributed responsibility" and
students
           and staff were issued with "clear copyright instructions".

           "This is a huge community and there will be cases of
transgressions of
           this kind," he said. "When it does happen we act properly."

           Mr Shane Simpson, the principal of the Sydney law firm representing
           AMCOS and AMPAL, said the four sites were targeted because they
           were accessed via the universities' official Web sites.

           The four sites contained lyrics to popular songs and MIDI (musical
           instrument digital interface) files allowing computers to reproduce
           instrumental versions of popular songs. All the offending
material has
           been removed and both universities have undertaken to review
material
           made available through the sites, Mr Simpson said.

           He emphasised the AMCOS campaign would be extended and
           university sites carefully monitored. "This is absolutely the
opening
           shot," he said. "Quite clearly if the universities had not
responded they
           would now be in the Federal Court."

           He said one Web site at the University of Western Sydney had
           contained "literally thousands" of files allowing the playback
of hit
           songs. Another site at Monash University had the lyrics to many
of the
           most popular songs in Australia since 1989.

           The webmistress of the Australian Music World Wide Web Site, Ms
           Eva Zsigri, is one of many veteran Net users who question the
           AMCOS campaign.

           "For someone like me who has been on the Net for years, it's all
about
           freedom of information," she said.

weird things happen in that state between consciousness and sleep...
especially if you can induce it in yourself while remaining
consciousness... i have done this via mind machines, and not nitrous
though...  it's called theta... if you hit 7.83 Hertz, you enter the
Schumann Resonance, which is a morphic resonance that surrounds the
planet... when psychics and healers do their thing, their brain
frequencies are usually around 7.83....


gettin into the gaia matrix via technology... chemical and electronic...

there are two types of nitrous oxide, medical and industrial... since
industrial nitrous (which contains impurities) is easier to access, it
is likely more common than medical nitrous at parties...  industrial
nitrous is used for race cars...

it's about resonant frequencies which activate the chakras (which are
also activated during orgasm)...

 Michael, Michael... expand that brilliant brain you have.

 Binds or ties; how MANY ways can that be applied? Just because there is 
a system of shared beliefs does that mean people MUST be together? Are we 
not together when we agree to be apart. On a spiritual plain, when are we 
really alone. Can communication be facillitated and strong bonds formed 
when we are apart?

 Also; religion or spirituality (or the states of) perchance existed 
before we labled them. Human labels are human constructs and susceptible 
to human error and failure (or at least possibly not being accurate and 
not evolving with what they intially described)

 The thing is and exists independent of speech. We have mearly created a 
refrence system to relate to and communicate and store data. I am me, not 
the label you give me.

nothing wrong with a little bit of enforced karma (somewhere between
karma and retirbution)... just make sure you do something nice for
someone else afterwards to balance it out...

	Not to minimize Randy's hurt feelings or anything, but I
just don't believe the amount of bandwidth taken up on this list 
over the karma of a $20.00 cable. 

	I mean there is some *real* ugly stuff going down, 
folks. I've read about promoters acting like Mafia loan sharks, 
using their security people to beat someone to a pulp in order 
to collect a debt (the "DJ Shadow" incident). I've read about one 
promoter calling the cops on somebody over a ripoff, then getting 
beaten & put in the hospital by the folks he called the cops on 
(the Thomas Trouble vs. the Russians thing). Shit like this makes 
me question whether this scene is really something I want to be 
part of. This part of it looks like a typical drug scene.

	Can we get a little perspective here?

	It's real easy to ostracize someone who's so far down
they're just helpless, and maybe that makes some people feel
powerful. But I think that if we want to worry about doing
some kind of Karmic enforcment, maybe we should pick a worthy
challenge, like getting the fucking sharks out of the scene.

Electronicool is the weekly event at 111 Minna that Spesh from Trip'n'Spin
Records has been putting together for the last few months.  He describes
it as "house music for people who work 9 to 5," but actually the music
ranges across house, techno and jungle, but in relaxed fashion.  If you
haven't been to 111 Minna, it's a gallery at the edge of the financial
district, very pleasant, has a permanent wine and beer bar.  

I've been graciously offered a DJ slot this week, along with Spesh, Gil
and Kimon, so I hope some of y'all can come check it out.  

Electronicool - Thursday, January 30 - 5 to 9 pm - 111 Minna - free

The event moves to Wednesdays starting on February 5...

Hello...is this thing on?  There *is* a protest party on the way, though
not for a month or two.  It's a public, outdoor, daylong event at the San
Francisco Federal Building being put on by Moontribe, from LA, in
association with Inner Eye and some other SF folks.  The focus is
environmental protest, in particular Ward Valley, but it would be an
excellent venue for public demonstrations about anything to do with raves,
ravers, or raving.  If you want to know more or get involved (I'm not, and
this is all I really know) you should probably try to get in touch with
Inner Eye (646-0751).

The food drive thing is a fine idea, of course, and already being pursued
to some extent by all the parties that are collecting food at the door in
exchange for cheaper admission.

here's some info pertinent to this discussion i dredged up from a program
called cooledit (an excellent sound editing shareware,btw, that can generate
these patterns encoded in "pink noise")
:
The major brainwave patterns are:

Beta	> 13 hz	Normal state of alertness, stress and anxiety.
Alpha	8-12 hz	Light relaxation, "superlearning", positive thinking.
Theta	4-7 hz	Deep relaxation, meditation, increased memory and focus.
Delta	1-3 hz	Deep sleep, lucid dreaming, increased immune functions.
Gamma	200+ hz	Not sure exactly what these do...

i've tried the theta (for 20 minutes) with questionable results
and the delta (:20) with trippy results.  i felt like i was still asleep
for the next few hours as i walked around the lower haight at like 4am.
fun, but i havent done it again either...

>From some of the conversations i've had with sfravers in the past 90 
days, the goa-trance heads would understand this the best:

The last time i did acid, this saying came rolling right off my tongue as 
i was talking to a goa-trance dj:

"Music is just simply encoded bits of information given to us by the 
higher intellegence"  (the higher intellegence being god to some)

So it occurred to me as I was reading a raver's story...if this is true, 
and I take no credit for making the phrase up, just passing it on, it is 
no wonder there are so many misconceptions about raving, music, etc.  
most people are not aware that music is information that is so 
sophisticated that the information could never be written down in a book 
in the english, spanish, or cardassian languages!  

i don't know, i don't really have anything more to say about this.  maybe 
someone else does.

Good Morning and Happy Thurdaze....


Well pickins are slim once again this Friday.  But I guess it being a
national holiday and all (Star Wars 97') I guess parties are going to be
pretty slim. 

I guess it's a choice btwn Nikita & _GT_ (maybe).  Well, to some I'll
assume there is no choice.  Myself,  well if nothing's going on Friday
night it looks high time to motor to a beach and look @ the stars w/some
hard Jungle tunes bumpin' from my car...

Saturday- _Kinonoea_ is what I be leaning towards, with _Odyssey_ as a
second bet...  I think I'll be checking out one of these After parties
on Sunday too (finally).  

In any case,

C-U in the Void.

if anyone wants to go to the cloud house party this weekend, i recommend
that they get their tickets early, cuz it's probably gonna sell out
quick, especially at $5.00.  I'm pretty sure that they have tickets
available at drop beat in oakland.  And everyone else....HAVE A GREAT
DAY!  it's supposed to be sunny today. :)

                        THE 100-YARD DASH

10 runners are at the starting blocks,
Poised on knuckles, legs taught, leaning forward,
Ready to run the 100-yard dash.
The starting gun fires:  they're off in a flash
But one runner stumbles and falls to the ground.
Peristent dream and sustained training for naught,
His hopes are destroyed in that accidental instant.
First one, then the next and the next...
All of the other nine stop,
Turn, trot back to the fallen one, and
Extend hands and arms to help him rise,
Brush cinders from his scraped elbows and knees.
Then all of them, hand-in-hand,
WALK together to the finish line,
Crossing it as a single unit.
10 gold medals are awarded.
This is a true story.
It happened in Northern California
Not long ago at the Special Olympics.

Yes, I can agree with this statement.....or "music is reality".....or "we
are the music".....  I believe music speaks to us.  When I create music, it
is my intention to transmit a picture or message from God/the
Goddess/Jesus/Buddha (insert name of your particular Deity here) in the form
of art....in this case sound.  I say this because my first realizations
about things spiritual were transmitted to me through music.  Since then I
have aspired to do the same for others.

Hey Tony.... hummmm .... I like your idea about music being sophisticated
bits of information....this makes me think of how every genre of electronic
music (house, d&b, trance etc) grapples within itself to label itself. We
humans have a love for labelling things and attaching names to things and
categorizing things into boxes. I know people who write for music magazines
and they continually baffle me with the ever-evolving labels for music that
they use. I ask them what they mean and they can't really make it clear to
me at all. And also, I've noticed how one person's "hard trance" can be
another person's "progressive house". These labels are becoming
meaningless. The point I'm getting to is that it seems like music lately
seems to be slipping away from the rational mind - we are increasingly
finding it difficult to use language to describe it. This makes me very
happy, because I believe that music exists in the realms of non-language,
non-rationality and non-intellectualism - and this to me is where all that
great mysterious stuff is. I tried to write a mix-tape review once, it was
~really~ hard. Music can be seen as the 'gateway' to the 'other' realms of
ourselves that pesky rational mind has no dominion over.

....I think this is one of the things I like about goa - my rational,
intellectual brain can't grip onto it, so it kind of gives up and starts to
dance....or something like that.....

Ciao.....Meri

All,
	This thread really hits a spot on my polka-dot brain. 
	To myself, music are two things:
	1) Music is Life: 
		 Music is the steady heart beat of our mothers heart which
keeps us content, reminds us that we are alive and part of the universe.
	2) Music tells a story:
		I believe the dance music we listen (dance) to is
comparable the the music of the classical (expressanist (sp?),
nationalist, etc.) eras. These musics tell us a story and take us on
a mental ride to another reality. 
	
	I have never expressed these thoughts to but a few and hope
they are well received by this list.

				Respect,
					VERTIGO

called Dance Nightmare Pt. 2.  The author talks about how dance music is
starting to get bigger.  He finds that silly and reflects back on the
Disco Movement.  I don't think he trashes the scene at all, but rather
says it is too amorphous to really be greeted with a lot of success in the
U.S.  He says:

"Today's dance acts are invisible for a reason. Techno, house, jungle and
trip-hop are heard in tandem with a sub-culture, not as the vanguard of
it. The music is only part of the experience. It's not the
impetus or the scene's reason to be. One might argue that the drug
Ecstasy, or the secret rites that go along with the rave culture are more
important than the interchangeable soundtrack."

This is an interesting "outisider's" point of view, and somewhat valid,
IMO.  I would disagree with the importance he places on music, but I can
understand where someone who isn't into the "scene" would come up with
this.

My favorite part is the following because it is exactly what I think.  I
just can't imagine dance music becoming super huge in the U.S. for the
same reasons.  He says,"

"But no matter what MTV or the business juggernauts do in the States, this
music is likely to do even less business than the altie rock craze of the
last five years. It's producer-driven, not musician-made. It's anonymous
rather than glamorous. These are the qualities that Americans have
found unattractive for decades. Americans like their stars with faces and
personalities. They like music that is reflective of someone we can
identify with. And all the hype in the world won't change that. No way. "

However, I do sense a little bit of bitterness from the author as an
outsider.  "Raving" is maybe more "alternative" than "alternative music".
For music critics who pride themselves on knowing EVERYTHING about all
music, especially the most alternative groups, they DO NOT know a thing
about "techno."  So the get techno-envy, I guess!! :)  hehehe

                                A Pattern

A seagull skims the ocean at dawn--
Youth.
The flutter of wings, the dust of feathers;
a raven in the churchyard caws.

Timelessness.
The earth will spin evermore.
/What has been will be again./
Time is but a game.
You've been,
                You've seen,
                                You've thought,
You've twisted this spiral before.

10:18 a.m.
A fetus settles in the vacuum.
A pause in creation--
it will be born again.

God's fingers trip mathematics
on the humble scales of time--
and hereness
and nowness
in human weight
makes  no sense to the stars.

The churchyard at dusk--
poets and politicians and junkies sleep.
A raven picks the frozen ground.
The earth buckles with frost.
A fencepost twists in timelessness.

An ancient oak by the graveyard's edge:
naked branches break skyward
again and again
                again and again
                                in random patterns--
heavenward.

Springtime.
The children dance until dawn.
A synthetic heartbeat pounds
between womb and earth,
reality and non-reality:
                boom boom boom boom
                boom boom boom boom
One hundred and twenty beats per minute.

/"Meaningless!  Meaningless!"/
cries the child to the ancient stars.
/"Utterly meaningless!
Everything is meaningless!"/

The planets line in soldier's stance:
                Hup, two, three, four.
                Hup, two, three, four.
A pattern.
        A pattern.
                A pattern.
/What has been done will be done again./

A baby is born.
A heartbeat tapers.
Gravestones mold and crumble.
A seagull skims the ocean at dawn.

/There is nothing new under the sun./

Saturday has some stuff going on, but I didn't get much for Friday.  I'm 
not sure who's at Galactic Tunnel, and then there's Reese at Nikita, I
believe.  Cloud House and Odyssey look good on Saturday, but both could
sell out...

My connection to Hyperreal was slow again, so let me know if I missed 
anything in my email...

	So how you we "do" something about it? I do not know how to 
remove influences such as these from the scence I am a part of. well, 
except by not going and if people ask me, point to what has happened and 
let people make choices for themselves... And maybe this is the shit that 
prompts 20/20 to do their reports. How can we have an open environment 
and still weed out the "typical drug scene", especially when that typical 
drug scene does not always merge with our own except by staying out of it 
and knowing where things come from. Hint, if you don't know who you are 
buying things from, can you trust them? Probably not all the time...

the only way to keep it an "open" environment, but free from the problems of
the typical drug scene, is to have big, expensive, commercial raves, with
lots and lots of security.

the alternative is to make it a "closed" environment, with smaller, more
private parties, with a more selected group of people.

anyway, buying drugs at a rave seems like a very unwise thing to do.

I wasn't talking about the cable anymore, I was talking about attitudes
in general.  Even so, keep in mind that U2 losing a cable is a different
perspective from Randy losing a cable.  For that matter,
me-as-poor-student losing an extension cable (happened) versus
me-as-employed-engineer losing an extension cable (also happened).

Everyone needs to do what they can, on whatever level they can do it. 
If you believe your own argument, you ought to drop what you're doing
right now and go do something about genocide in Latin/South America, the
AIDS plague devastating Africa and SE Asia, political prisoners all over
the world, global CO2 levels rising, destruction of the biosphere
everywhere...shit, you name it.

But there are some things that can be done in the course of one's daily
life, which is different from individual to individual.  Excoriating
someone from doing so because there are bigger causes is pointless. 
There is always a bigger cause.

Maybe the world would be a better place if everyone stopped worrying
about Big Causes like Bosnia or Chile or the drug war or whatever and
started taking care of their own freedoms and responsibilities.

All of you internet nerds should check out the IRC channel #SFRaves on
EFNet.  There you could discuss about anything without having to say it's
NRR.  It's just a place for everyone to chit-chat.

If you are not familiar with IRC here are a few URLs to check out:

ftp://cs-ftp.bu.edu/irc/support/IRCprimer1.1.txt
ftp://cs-ftp.bu.edu/irc/support/alt-irc-faq

Kwiq Start

Download an IRC client for your computer.  If you are on a UNIX shell you
probably already have an IRC client installed.  For Windows 3.11 or Windows
95 users check out the program mIRC.  You can get it from
http://www.mirc.co.uk  it has all the nice features for an IRC client.  I'm
not sure about Macintosh but someone told me that htere is an IRC client for
the Mac called IRCLE.  Do a websearch on it.

EFnet IRC Servers

Here are a few servers that are currently linked to the EFNet IRC Network
where #SFRaves is:

irc.cs.rpi.edu <- personal favorite
irc.blackened.com
irc2.phoenix.net
irc.frontiernet.net
irc2.phoenix.net
IRC.VoyagerOnline.net
piglet.cc.utexas.edu
irc.nwlink.com 
anarchy.tamu.edu
irc.sintercom.org
irc.best.net 
irc.ionet.net
irc.digex.net
irc.cdc.net
irc.vianet.on.ca
irc.law.emory.edu
irc.eng.yale.edu 
irc.mindspring.com 
irc.idt.net 
irc.voicenet.com
irc.lightning.net
irc.sprynet.com 
irc.visi.com 

NOTE: All of these servers are connected to the EFNet IRC Network unless a
netsplit occurs.  If you find that #sfraves is empty on a given server try
out other servers.

If you are an AOL user use:

irc02.irc.aol.com 

Once you get on IRC just type /join #sfraves 


hope to I R See everyone......

This sort of thing reminds me of the argument between the First
Amendment and perventing Klu Klux Klan ralies or flag burning. And the
awnser is the same: Having personal freedom over ones actions carries
with it the responsibility to be able to tolorate the sometimes unwanted
actions of others. (I'm shure there is a better way to word what I'm
trying to say. Excuse me I'm quite stoned right now thankyouverymuch.)
Raves after all _are_ TAZs. Open enviorments bring with them many other
activites that we might not nessesaraly want. And if it's underground
you want then its underground you get. 

And people wonder why there isn't ever a cop around when you need one.

 Interesting stuff here (which has been snipped all to hell by me). I 
think one reason my situation generated so much discussion and commentary 
was because it is a local situation (for some anyway) and is a situation 
where one could feel their influence upon. So often we engage in courses 
of action to help without seeing even a ripple of our efforts.

 From what I have been told (by knowledgeable folks) The QSC's in general 
are not so good for low frequency drivers and bins as they don't respond 
well to large (relativly) variations in impedence. You tend to get this 
situation in bass bins much more than in mids or highs. Another thing to 
consider is; what is the lowest impedence this amp can safely drive? If 
you can only go to 8 ohms and your driving two 16 ohm cabinets in 
parallel, than that is the only cabinets you can _safely_ drive with that 
amp.

 For more info on impedance, amps, calculating impedance's and (way) 
more, see the Yamaha Sound Reinforcement Handbook. It is filled with a 
LOT of information and anyone thinking of owning or operating a sound 
system for public enjoyment should have one. It will save you money and 
stress related headaches.

Technical difficulties.  Hyperreal had some reboots Thurs,
which sometimes causes majordomo to lose track of where
it was and restart sending stuff.

Thus, duplicates appear.

Hope that clears up the confusion!

well, there Q i hadn't thougth about it in quite that way, but it was 
quite a fog-fest, let me tell you...

i had to drive down to King City today to go to court...man is it slow 
down there!  i mean even the bees flap their little wings slower!  i got 
pulled over for 80 in a 70 on the way down to my pyramid convention 
(yeah, you know ivan...hot filtered water!) and he ended up not citing 
me, cause i played the bumbling idiot "wwwwmmmppphmf i can't find my 
proof of insurance" so he cited me for that and no registration instead...

...oh, it gets even better!  since i don't watch very much television AT 
ALL, i didn't hear about the big ass fine you get for not having 
insurance...i shouldn't be fined for it but the system doesn't know that 
they assume i didn't have insurance so i get this bill for $1652 (USD) 
WITH proof of insurance and $1300 (USD) without!  when i called about the 
fine to the court lady she said something like "what oh you mean you 
didn't watch it on TV?"  like i'm some kind of programmed drone or 
something...WE ALL ARE THE COLLECTIVE WE WATCH TV WE ALL DO WHAT WE ARE 
TOLD WE DO NOT QUESTION AUTHORITY EHH EE 505 420 420 909 808 69

anyway, i had to plead not guilty...so i go back to the radish factory 
(it smells like radishes down there, and pesticides :( )...so i go back 
may 8th.  we'll see...

thanx for askin--->fog

what?  you don't know what goa-trance is?  it's gonna engulf the scene, 
everyone's gonna throw out their house records (melt them so they can't 
listen to them anymore (i'm being fesicious don't take it personally you 
goa-hedz))

goa gil, in my eyes, looks eXACTLY like Jerry Garcia, in fact, i 
understand they are about the same age.  

goa-trance is very very psychedelic music, someitmes mixed on dat, 
sometimes on turtables.  160-200 bpm?  usually like 160.  very friggin 
loud.  nice people.  i'd go check out one if i was u, nstuff, jeff!

this stuff again really made me stop and think.  The live tracks were
amazing.  The studio stuff was great.....

Hiya!
Though you won't be able to hear it all the way up there, your Uncle Noah
will be spinning on a great show on 91X radio in San Diego on Saturday
night!  So, don't start crying about missing the program -- I'm going to
tape it!  If anyone is interested in a tape of more of my usual craziness
at minimal cost (postage, blank tape) then let me know!  
The program will also feature DJ Vitamin D, I do believe...
:)

160!!!  try 130-150 tops... i've collected goa for four years and have
only found maybe 10 records over 160...  160 is verging upon 3 beats per
second... i don't associate goa with speed...  you'd lose all the
texture...  the only goa i own over 160 is the few goa-jungle records i
have...

	Don't go to their parties, don't buy their drugs -

	I'm not real fond of the external control type solutions.

	When I was a poor student, I would much rather have lost an

	type of person... or got into some weird competition with

	This type of argument is called "reductio ad absurdum", 
	or, in English, reduction to absurdity. Exagerrating 
	something reasonable into the unreasonable. 

	The problems in our local scene are more personal, 
	immediate, and solvable than the examples you give. 
	The jump from flakiness/petty theft in the local 
	scene to violent gangstERism in the local scene is 
	staying on topic - local rave-scene related. Jumping 
	from there to Bosnia (for example) is a total change 
	of subject.

I like what Michal wrote about religion and language.. 
I do think, however, that our written/spoken/thought
language is not the only thing that defines consciousness.  It is
possible to articulate, to interpret and apply, through other mediums as
well.  Body language, movement (athletics/dance), music, art,
spirituality.. are all ways in which we can express ourselves,
frequencies at which we can "think" or be conscious.

Subject: A Raver Needs Help!!  2 Problems, actually...
Sender: sfraves-owner@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

Hey there, everybody!  This is Julie Mae (SmileGrl1@aol.com) and I'm
currently using my friend's account to send this letter, so if you are going
to respond, please don't click on "reply to sender."  Please address it to my
actual e-mail address... Thanks in advance...  Also, if neither of the two
problems that I (my friends, actually) need help with can be addressed by
yourself, please at least scroll down to the bottom of this letter to read
the "Quote for the Day."  I really love this one in particular!

FIRST OFF, since I'm not at home to get my new SFRaves calendar, I don't have
some information that a friend of mine needs to be able to make arrangements
to go out this weekend.  If anyone could please forward her (GOrelly@aol.com)
a copy of the calendar as soon as possible, we both would greatly appreciate
it.  I believe that she is particularly interested in information (DJs, etc.)
pertaining to a party that is supposedly going on Friday (Evolution?).

SECONDLY, another friend of mine (my best friend, actually), Jessica Adams,
who is an Old Skool Raver like myself (she's been raving since like 1991), is
having problems with transportation for Saturday.  She moved to the
Sacramento area from Mountain View last month and doesn't know which ravers
live in the Sacramento area that usually rave in the Bay Area.  This being
the case, she doesn't know who to call to find a ride down to the Bay Area
for parties.  I would go pick her up except for the fact that between driving
to Sac and back before the party and driving to Sac and back after the party
(when I'd be very tired and sometimes coming down from E) constitutes a lot
of driving for me, especially when my car hasn't been running so well
lately...  I love her dearly, but I can't put my car, nor myself, through all
that driving...
So, if any of you live in the Sacramento area or know someone who lives there
that comes down here for parties every once in awhile, PLEASE let me know...
I haven't been able to really see her in a long time, so it would truly make
our day if one of you lovely people could possible help us out on this one
anytime in the future, but ESPECIALLY THIS SATURDAY.  She or I can help out
with gas money and I thought I'd let you also know that Jessica is one of
coolest ravers around and she's fun to travel to parties with and adventure
with!  She's one of the POSITIVE and TRUE ravers that we all value so much in
our scene.  It would be a shame if our scene lost one of these wonderful
ravers because of transportation problems!  Also, FYI, that little groovy
rave book that I keep my treasured quotes, poems, and sayings in is actually
a collaboration of the energies of Jessica and myself.  We share that book
that contains all those beautiful thoughts that I have been sharing with all
of you.....our family.  So, if that doesn't truly convince you that she is
worthy of the help of a ride to a party, I don't know what will.  PLEASE
HELP!!!!  If you can help in any way with info. or a ride for this
Saturday/Sunday (or any weekend, for that matter), please voice-mail/page me
at (415) 253-2568.  Thank you so much!  We'd appreciate it more than you
could possibly imagine!

For everyone else who took the time to read this, thank you for caring...  I
love you all.   Much PLUR to everyone!

                                    Peace and Love,
                                                    Julie Mae

Is it called Numbers?  It's not by Kraftwerk, is it?

Ummm.. I've watched the show several times and have yet to see them play a
single jungle tune.  Maybe they'll get daring and play an Everything But
the Girl Drum 'n' Bass remix.  Or dig deep and play a two-year old Goldie
song from 'Timeless'.

Oooohh.... cutting edge.  I'm quakin' at the thought of too much 'new' music!

On the flip side, consider the 1am programming alternatives...

Regular MTV
Saturday Night Live
Nick at Nite
USA Network
SciFi Channel

The last one is the only thing that could keep me up, unless there was
something trippy on Bravo. Just my 2 cents worth.

And I do recommend checking AMP out once (hell, I taped two three episodes
until I realized they were replaying a lot of stuff over and over).  And is
one hour really enough for all those songs?  And why do the AMP intros take
up almost as much time as the songs themselves?  Lastly, haven't seen any
actual ambient stuff.  Just Chem Bros', Prodigy "accessible" techno.  Are
you an MTV employee?

And my last comment:  You can also discuss this in XLR8R's new Chill Room, at:

I'm not sure how I feel about this; however, Keoki may just prove that 
the rave scene can support over hyped star types.

Thanks!

These guys were so innovative -- it would be cool for XLR8R or some other
techno music magazine to interview them (i.e., "Where are they today, what
do they think of what they started", etc.).  It couldn't be that hard, right?

The last album I bought of theirs was Electric Cafe (87?  89?).  Another
good album at the same time / similar impact on my as Cabaret Voltaire's
"CODE" (I was an old school industrial DJ at "Poseurs" in DC years and
years ago).  I wonder what Alex Patterson was doing way back then besides
working on Killing Joke albums (so I've heard)?

Comments?

Of course techno also owes P-Funk, disco, house source credits as well.

pause
8. He's constantly yelling, "Take that, Red Baron!"
7. Shuttle from New York to Boston includes stopover in Colombia
6. His co-pilot: Robert Downey Jr.
5. For the last hour, he's been riding the beverage cart like a rodeo
cowboy
4. Keeps coming on the P.A. to point out clouds that look like his old
high school teachers
3. His wings are pinned to his bare chest
2. When you fly over international date line, he yells, "Dude! We're,
like, time traveling!"
1. When he exhales, the oxygen masks drop

i listen to a great deal of free improv music.  Basically plug in your
instrument and play.  I also make this type of music.  Although the pieces
created for dance music aren't improv per se, when a good Dj spins them and
plays with the sund it is an improv experience.  Again and again i hear
from some of the great musical creators such as John Coltrane, mathew
bauer, etc, that they do not strictly create the music but rather "channel"
the sounds from somewhere.  I too have experienced this, where me and my
bandmate will be making sounds and this cool sound emerges and neither of
us is sure who is really making it.  To me these moments are like riding on
a wave, whihc i can direct very slightly, but it has a force and a
direction of its own at any one moment.  I am not really sure what is being
channeled.  Is it the "one" cosmic sound.  Is it alien communication?  Is
it communication with elves?  How much control does the performer really
have over the sound, so is it a mix of yourself with the "one" cosmic
sound?  There is something here, but I am not really sure that anyone
really knows.  And as one Jazz guy said," if i could say what it is in
words then I would not need to make the music."  To roughly paraphrase.
        Well enough on this for now.  I have lots more to say on this
subject though.  It's kinda a main interest of mine.
peace,
Dennis

obviously there are not still together....

they were and still are a definate influence...

All I know about their current activities is that the main guy from
Kraftwerk(I think his name is Klaus?) is working with Electronic(the
Bernard Sumner/Johnny Marr thing)...he co-wrote and plays on a few songs
from their latest album...

What i see happening with the underground music/dance scene is this:

Techno/house etc. IS becoming mainstream and it won't falter like they
are predicting.  The producer driven, faceless star bit isn't what is
going to happen.  As i see it, the well established mainstream groups
are going to "jump on the bandwagon".  Some examples, smashing pumpkins'
next album is supposed to be all electronic music, U2's new album is
heavily influenced by it, NIN is starting to use drum and bass in their
music,....etc. etc. i have some more examples, but can't recall them
right now.  DOH!

I think the music is going to get pirated and then spit back out to the
masses.

my thoughts for today.

[ to sfraves list ]

 I was just on Bascom Ave earlier this week ( this being a street in
the South Bay, 1/2 mile east and parallel to HW 880 in San Jose ).
I was surprised at the new Rasputin's Records store that has opened
up just 1/2 block north of Tower Records! I actually parked in the
Tower Records parking lot and checked out both stores.

 Seems that Rasputin's has got Tower Records beat as far as 
"Alternative" music is concerned - Rasputin's has clearly marked
sections for Techno, Experimental, and Industrial. They also
have used CDs and vinyl. A good complement to the Tower store
down the street.

 Two miles up the street are two more music stores - Streetlight 
Records ( 980 S. Bascom Ave., south of HW 280 and the hospital )
and Solid Grooves ( 368 S. Bascom Ave. (408) 999-0259 , north
of HW 280 and near West San Carlos street ). Streetlight has
new and used music , and also used videos. Solid Grooves is
a "DJ" store with the latest house, techno/trance, jungle, etc.
releases on vinyl, and turntables for previewing the music
before purchasing.

 I must watch out ... I averaged one CD purchase per store that day!

The song is "Uno Dos Tres" by Swabe, it's a recent 12" on Dope Dragon.

Hey eric,

That pioneer kicks ass!! are you going to get the CD one or the one that
hooksup to turntables? I have a friend in SJ that owns a shop near eastridge
mall that might be able to give you a little better deal probably not to much
better but less than a grand. I can't remember his store name but I have his
number I will give him a call. Also call dynamic sound in SJ and ask for
"oscar" that guy can probably give you a good deal as well. I would say mention
my name but I have not talked to oscar since we were in grade school so he
might not remember me. Try those two and if that does not work let me know I
might have a few more connections I can check out.


peace & hugz and stuff

You want to hear 160 - 200 I can show you it, but it ain't goa... Those 
16th notes would sound like a low powered automatic weapon (try spinning 
goa at 45 when its suppose to be 33)

There's also a great Prong techno remix album; an even more unlikely
combination: Prong with 303 tracks and dance-oriented song structures.

I can't remember the name of it, though. I think Brendan had a copy.

Noah-
I know you may think its funny, but this is the kind of shit that really
really upsets me.  You dont know what Ebonics is. That's obvious from this
tired ass mail you posted to this list. Nor do you care about the subject,
probably because you have no idea what you are talking about. But that's OK,
beacuse most Black people dont even know what Ebonics really is. Seeing as
though tomorrow, February 1st marks the beginning of Black History Month,
consider the following your first official lesson for the month....

 The vast majority of examples that Noah was so gracious to fwd to us WERE
NOT examples of Ebonics.  They are exmples of Slang. Make no mistake: Ebonics
is language that is structured and patterned and has rules similar to widely
accepted forms of language such as Standard English, Japanese, French, etc.
Slang is random and colloquial, and has nothing to do with syntax,
grammatical usage, etc. For example:  it's Monday night at the Bahia and Joe
Rice and I are there. During the course of the night, Monty snubs him for
some reason and is generally being a contentious jerk. After the club. Sho
says to Joe: "What's up with that fool Monty?" Joe replies, "I don't know,
but he be trippin'." 

In Joe's response, "he be" is the ebonical phrase meaning "he is" and
"trippin'" is slang for "acting strangely."

If that Ebonics article that was sent was featured on 20/20 last week
immediately following the piece they did on raves, would any of you cared?  I
doubt it.

I have to agree with you on this.  I see an awful lot of racist, non-PC
behaviour being masked by the currently PC line of joking about
"Ebonics".  I even wrote a letter to the SF Chron to that effect.

But this I have a problem with.  Ebonics is a dialect, not a language.
Case in point: 
	What language do Mexicans speak?  Spanish.
	What language do Spaniards speak?  Spanish.

But anyone that speaks Spanish knows that Mexican Spanish and the
Spanish
commonly spoken in Spain are very different dialects of the same
language.

"Ebonics" is *at most* a dialect, not a separate language.

That aside, though, I think the Oakland teachers that created this
label for a dialect have given too many closet racists an opening for
making jokes in poor taste at an American subculture's expense.

 Again, I knew Noah had it wrong, but I, as an Asian-American male who
grew up in Hawaii with less than 1% African-American representation
at my high school, did not feel qualified to say exactly how and why
Noah was off.

 Still and all, Noah's been a nice guy to me...

dear sfrave Mac Users:

I have been informed that I cannot load MacComCenter, because my computer 
doesn't have enough memory.  

They informed me i can use QUICK LINK...but they don't have it anymore, i 
guess the world is just moving too darn fast for the fog.  if anyone has 
that, could they please mail me back or call me?  i'll trade lollipops, 
or something of value in return for that favour!

The four Russian guys who run the Space on Stevenson  (Galactic Tunnel)
are violent judging from the stab wounds on Thomas Trouble. This space
should be avoided.

I also recall hearing a reasonably long sample used in another
recent song, although I can't for the life of me remember any
specifics.

Even so, I'm sure this wasn't the first time it was reused and it
won't be the last.

I've stayed silent as various bits of this disturbing story have  
unfolded...unsure what is rumor...but the story is pretty consistent.
Several people have asserted that the Stevenson Alley people have put 
Thomas Trouble in the hospital as retribution for calling the cops on them.

If this is true, we as a community have to take serious action against 
these thugs.  They do not deserve our patronage or money.  They do not 
deserve to have any association with the rave scene.  They, actually, 
deserve much worse.

I agree: Stay away from the Stevenson space.  Stay away from any 
"parties" these people are associated with (can somebody provide the 
names of the parties?)

Someone beaten to a pulp for supposedly owing promotors money.  Thomas 
_stabbed_ for trying to get back at unscrupulous people for allegedly 
stealing money.  There is a VERY ugly element in our scene.  The rave 
scene is about PROFITS to many people, and there is a LOT of MONEY to be 
made here, not just at the door but by controlling the drug trade.  

Because our scene is also a site of drug distribution (plus admission fees
for customers to even get into the "drug store"), underworld 
characters (and just generally bad people) associated with the black market 
will try to exploit it.  They just see ravers as dollars signs, and are 
obviously willing to use violence to secure their niche in it.

WE HAVE TO BE SERIOUSLY VIGILANT ABOUT KEEPING OUR SCENE SAFE!!!

Stay away from Stevenson.  Share information like this (DO NOT SPREAD 
RUMOR).  Buy from your friends.  Know who the promoters are.   And let's 
look out for each other and protect our scene.

Thank you.
Nancy

We're probably not really arguing.  It's just hard to tell, over e-mail,
when someone is really exercised over a certain thing or whether it's
just a jumping off point for more discussion.

 From the sounds of it (who is to know) TT called it upon himself. But as 
I already stated I can not and will not support violence of any kind. 
Especially organised gang violence.

 Some of you may remember how TexHuk (sp?) from Galactic Tunnel used names 
of friends of mine (obtained from my mail header)to send them (without 
asking) mail concerning, I beleive, their first party. While it may have 
been an accident (HA!) I immediately didn't like that and felt it was 
very inconsiderate.

 Again; I will not knowingly EVER go to one of their parties. I 
hope everyone else will do the same. If only for the survival of our scene.

I was just wondering exactly where this space is that we should stay away 
from?  I have been to a Pro-soy party on Stevenson alley but I'm pretty 
sure it's an entirely different space.

Hi.

 The GT partys were at a warehouse that is halfway between 7th and 6th. 
When you take 7th to Stevenson and then turn right, the warehouse is 
almost exactly half way down the alley on the left. It has (had?) a gray 
door.

 There is a very narrow set of stairs that led from the entrance up to a 
_long_ tunnel-like warehouse.

 Remind me not to call a party Karma. Talk about playing with fire!

Hi all!   ]=)

 I must very strongly apologise for wasted bandwidth here, but this is 
very important to me or else I wouldn't be bothering you all.

 Concerning THE CABLE (thunder crackles omniously);

 I had stated that the person who needed it and was entrusted with it (by 
the person wh borrowed it from me) returned it a couple of days later to 
the person who had borrowed it. I was informed yesterday that I had my 
information scrambled and that the cable was actually returned before 
everyone had left Somar. (by the person who had misplaced it) This was 
sometime after I had packed and left.

 I personally feel like this whole issue should be done and over, however 
I relayed some inaccurate info on the situation and I felt responsible 
for spreading inaccurate info and thus this message.

 Thanks for your patience!

Prong has been heading this way for a while.  You don't hear too much of it
on Cleansing, their last album but one, from which this remix stuff came
("Snap your Fingers, Snap your Neck," like we heard), but it's quite clear
on their latest (forgot the name).  Most people would probably think
"industrial," but the techno influence is obvious if you know.  Kind of a
third-wave industrial, maybe, in the camp of groups like White Zombie.
Along with electronica, Prong has been blending guitar processing and other
weird, noisy sounds in a Helios Creed/NIN/Sonic Youth kind of vein into
their older thrash-metal groove, which I think is a pretty interesting
combination.

Hey, maybe you should have just stabbed them, huh? I mean they must have

Ok, I'm a lame channel surfer sometimes (but I'll be out tomorrow night)

and I see a familiar smiling face ... and a voice saying "Ethan Miller will
be telling us all about the rave scene"

9:30 - 10:00 tonight, ch. 60 (cable 11 in Berkeley, 22 in Oakland)

the context is internet communities ... sound familiar?

	Is anyone watching Millenium???
	
	They are showing something that looks like a rave...i.e. black
	lights, lazers, people dancing with glow toys, Adidas gear...except
	it almost looks like they dubbed over with some shittier more clubby
	music.  
	
	AND THEN the story line is some guy giving women E, which
	he started off by selling @ the "rave" and then later to women else
	where, just to watch them have sex with their "boyfriends" and then
	kills them with SPECIAL K so as to keep the fantasy he had of
	them alive only in his mind. 

	WHAT THE HELL??????????

 	What a stupid and fucked up episode?  It seems FOX has joined the
	rave bashing along with 20/20.  I mean, there is NO POINT to the
	episode except showing the rave, the E, the special K, and how
	it kills...like raves will kill.

	What is going on?????????

I apologized for something I didn't do!
What's up with that?!

Be more clear on what Noah your yellin at! :D
Noah R:  Stop making me feel upset! :D

So anyway, let me post the question to SFRAVES since the topic is
breached:

WHY is the techno/rave scene as we know it today so exclusionary toward
African Americans, especially in the inner-city?  True, the junglists are
starting to bridge the gap and break and opening to the scene, but that
does not really answer the question.  
Here's what got me thinking about this originally:
I have a friend who works in South Central LA promoting culture and such
and incorporating technology and multi-media stuff.  Anyway, he got a
really big grant this year and is planning a big celebration for the
'rebirth' of his organization.  I offered to spin, only to find him
respond that the 'techno' scene does not appeal to most of the kids he
works with.  In fact, he said, they feel alienated and excluded.  The
scene, he continued, appealed to Chicanos/Latinos, but not the African
Americans.  
Now all this happened about a week after URB released its issue with the
'history' of techno.  If you missed it, URB pretty much stated that techno
is an African American art form, produced for and by a community
interested in communicating the toils of inner city life (Hello Goldie?
j/k)
So what are we doing wrong??
Obviously, posting racists jokes could be one thing, but it doesn't
explain why you go to a party with a couple of hundred people and find the
limited demographics you do...

thoughts?

 My, aren't we the touchy, verbally violent type.  ;)

 TT had it coming because he threatened to kill somone. Regardless of the 
feelings anyone has towards violence it seems to me to be a pretty safe 
rule that one shouldn't threaten to kill someone unless one is ready to 
accept the consequences.

 And I write peas (sometimes peace) as that is what I wish someone before 
I depart (sometimes) and it is certainly what I would wish anyone reading 
my posts. Even those stupid enough to invite violence into their lives.

 Back to your regular gripes;

smiles,

I'm sorry I must be confused, I thought that you were the moron stating
that someone brought a stabbing upon themselves. 

I much rather be considered immature than to hold such a fucked up
attitude.

When I see such utter bullshit coming from someone, you are *damn* right.

You are repeating rumors, and making judgements based on those rumors. A
person, a *human being*, is lying in the hospital. *THAT* is fact. *THAT*
is what matters. 

There is no excuse for this. Period.

Save your hypocrisy. Your lack of compassion and valuation of human life
is pretty damn clear.

Now back to your inane ramblings about your stupid $20 cable, the thing
that is really important, right?

 Well, you seem to be quite capable of making imfalmatory statements 
without backing them up. Care to explain why you think I'm a moron?

 I fail to see what you consider a fucked up attitude. TT claimed he was 
going to kill someone. He already knew he was dealing with some sketched 
people.

 I think you may be confused a bit. The grammer and spelling would 
indicate that you have been firing these posts off quickly (especially 
your first one). I am not condoning the behavior of the people who hurt 
TT. As you may recall (if you had bothered to read some earlier posts on 
this situation OR asked me to explain myself) I was one of, if not _the_ 
first person to publicly say (on the net) that I was boycotting the 
russians not only for what may have happened to TT (at the time it was 
still an unconfirmed rumor) but also for their threatening him (TT) on 
SFraves.

 However; if you point a gun at yourself and pull the trigger (assuming 
of course you know what a gun can do) you have no one to blame but 
yourself for being shot. You walk into the wrong neighborhood and start 
shouting slanderous euphimisms you should expect to run into trouble.

 Thomas called this upon himself. Period. He threatened people with 
death. I'm not saying he deserved what he got (although karmically...?) 
but he is responsible for putting himself in a stupid and dangerous place.

 It would be really nice BA if we could engage in a discussion about this 
rather than you yelling and screaming and calling me names. But then you 
must be so insecure that you can't, or your side of this issue is so weak 
that you need verbal violence to give it any weight. It's amazing how 
folks think that if they are loud enough then they are right. I guess 
that is because a lot of folks believe the loudest person.
