You go Kim!  I used to hate all electronic music sooooooooooooooooooooooooo
much.  I have recently gotten very much into it.  I listen to the music all
the time, and I love going to raves.  And, being a musician, I have changed
my mind from wanting to be in a band to wanting to make electronic music
(probably trance, progressive house, and maybe techno).  So does this mean
that I'm "fucking shite" and that I shouldn't be in the scene?  hak1 gets
the big WHATEVER!

Of course we ALL go to raves to hear the DJs.  But the drummers are great,
too.  In fact, the ones I have heard have all been pretty good--although, I
DO admit that I haven't heard that many.  And whistles are _okay_, as long
as they're doin' it right!

I have to say the home base thing was the best massive I went to....  My
question...  who was the girl who sang,  very cool, very moving.  I've never
seen a situation where one person can get everyone in a wherehouse sized room
to turn around, look at the front of the room, and dance!  She's my next
godess, after I figure out who she is..

  Thanksgiving Day was...... thanksgiving day... 'nuff of that ;)

Friday night my friend hooked up some tickets to see
 Goldie and Janes Addication  
play at the Universal ampitheater. We had like 5th row seats but we 
couldn't go into the pit :(
that was my first time seeing goldie... he's pretty hardcore.. i dig it 
:)
Janes Addiction was BAD ASS...they played all their all skool songs 
well....flea seemed a lot more mellow compared to his chili peppers days 
:)  the crazy dancers were gettin freaky too....
all in all.. it was dope

Saturday night i went to a hardcore/jungle party in downtown LA.
2 rooms...
Hardcore in one 
Jungle in tha other..
i REALLY liked this party.... it was called  Sideshow
i got groovy in the break circles in the ungle room, and stomped sround 
in the hardcore room...
then chilled in the big big chill room downstairs..
I really liked seeing all my so-cal raver firends and didnt realize how 
many people i knew, yet how many i didnt know.. and had just met...
things change quickly, but yet slowly at the same time...
I probably wont be able to go to another party up here until next year.. 
( that sounds weird, next year))
so when winter break is over, ill see you all at a party or gathering or 
in the streets getting funky to a toon as you wait at the busstop listen 
to the beat in your mind that does not stop even when the power is cut 
off........
peace everyone

That does put things into perspective, I've never been at a party where
someone died.  I always know the danger is there, but because I've never had
any trouble with drugs, I've never worried about it.  I guess I've been
lucky.  Makes me wonder if I walked pass that girl, passed out in the dark,
when I was looking for my friend.  Or maybe if my friend had fallen asleep
near her...  Makes me wish I had looked a little harder at all of the passed
out people.  Also makes me wonder what the people running that party think
about it...  I don't see it as their fault, in fact I saw more drugs
confiscated in that party than I have ever before by the security, so they
weren't condoning the drugs at their party, but I hate to think of the guilt
they are probably feeling.  How do you think this will drastically change the
raving scene?  Haven't there been drug related deaths at these parties
before?

Hi folks - Larry Ching here ...
 
 I've been unsubb'd from SFRaves for awhile, in order to reduce the
amount of temptation to go out dancing versus other stuff that needs
to get done in my life.
 
 Anyway, I've still kept my sub to the calendar, and I noticed
this party called _Playground_ ,
 
 "This will be an epic underground event, dedicated to the SFRaves
   family experience."
 
"This party will be in an indoor centralized SF location. Tix on sale
   December 1st. SF."
 
 There's no phone number or information about where the tickets will
be sold. Can anyone help? 

 Also - I suspect that if this is really an SFRaves planned and
executed event, that there's been tons of conversation about it on 
the list, all of which I've missed. I'd be so grateful if someone
could clue me in on what the SFRaves connections are with this
party.

 As one of the old SFRAves subscrib*rs from 1992, it'd be great to
meet and dance with the "new wave" of SFRavers! Looking forward
to meeting you folks and hearing you mix ...

okay, in light of the 'what have you done for the scene lately', and in
light of the article I just read in the Metro about how there's shit to do
down here, and because I still haven't met that many new people since I've
moved out here, and because I fucking love the music...

...I just want to let anybody/everybody know that I'd like to help out
with anything/everything involved with starting/fostering/resussitating a
scene down here in the south bay.

the handful of people I've met have all told me that the SJ area sucks, go
up to SF.  and I'm sick of it.  I've heard enough people (on this list, in
person, and in the papers) mention that there's nothing to do down
here, that I know that the potential exists to do something cool. let's
start a jungle/d'n'b night at some loser club in SJ!

comments?

	As a former south bay resident, I have to agree. 
	I have been to a few parties in the South Bay that were quite
small because no one would venture out from s.f. that we knew and also
the impression was no one would come to party in south bay but which had
a great vibe.  The opportunites for great parties, furthermore, are only
increasing  as the area continues to change and its residents are
increasingly aware of the music.  A lot of people on here I suspect are
in South Bay but can't make the parties becuse they are "car"-less.
Being more open minded about throwing parties in this area I would
suspect might take some of the competition off spaces in San Francisco
and East Bay.  Hmmm...on that note, i ask the question, is one of the
reasons more parties are not thrown in South Bay is the area is more
intolerant of parties police wise?  Have people tried before and it
wasn't successful?  

	And now that I said my word, I wouldn't mind helping you Jimg
and drumming up some old contacts of mine in South bay and seeing if
something could happen.

well, actually for me personally (better for my schedule), I was thinking
more along the lines of a weekly club night or something.  Something
regular that would draw people...not draw peeps FROM SF, but FOR peeps who
live down here (lots of them it would seem).

if I had the money and the knowledge, I guess I'd open up my own club.  :)

btw, wazzup with kismet?  is it closed for good?  I never got to go...

Okay,

WHEREAS, it appeared beforehand that nearly everyone on this list was
attending SPIRIT last Friday (or, at least, that's how it appeared from
the posts I was reading before going home on Wed); and

WHEREAS, 98% of the people actually in attendance at SPIRIT were under
18, and average age around 15 (or so it seemed); therefore,

AM I correct in drawing the conclusion that most of the folks on this
list are under 18???  Not that it's that big a deal, I just assumed 
that the average SFRave-er was in their 20's.


My short review of SPIRIT:

Have you ever known anyone who fell asleep during a rave while under
the influence of 2 (two) hits of e?  My . . . er . . . friend did.

PLUR, all,
Steve.

Why is it that everytime there is an accident at a party relating to
drugs, everyone goes into the traditional, Black-n-White view that
"Drugs are bad and thats that"?

I've taken E at two parties this month after waiting about 9 months, so
I know sober raving and I also know raving on E. And it is true that
abuse and addiction do happen with Methanpedimines. A friend of mine at
Spirit was pulling his hair out, asking me and everyone else to barrow
$20 for another hit, too blinded by his lust for that fEEling to see
what was happening to him. 

But it is ALSO true that an experience at a Rave sober can NOT compare
with being under the influence. Dancing, kissing, walking, talking all
feel better on E. I don't believe you can just as much fun sober. You
can have fun, shure. But it's not the same Kick-ass "I can see God!"
kind of fun.

Does this justify taking drugs consistently? I don't think so. My E at
Spirit wasn't as good as the one two weeks ago. Why? Because my brains
fluids that cause me to be "high" was reduced, so it wasn't as good.
This is why it's important to WAIT untill your brain has FULLY recovered
from the last time you took E. What is "Fully recovered"? Personally, my
rule of thumb is to wait about 6 months between each hit. This way,
every time you take it, it feels like the first time you took it. And
isn't that what we all want?

** Sorry, I didn't mean to imply that we should be the
only ones to use that space. It's just that when a good place
is found, and starts to get used every weekend, then it
is vulnerable ... to the police, to uncaring promoters, and
to party goers that might not care so much about what some
people are trying to do.
**There were some wonderful groups that used this space,
and I don't mind saying that I appreciate Macadio and the
Mantis group for doing it right and showing respect and
enthusiasm for that place. I felt more than happy to have
helped out in some way.
***You're right, the police is what I'm worried about.
When one person involved in parties, or who goes to parties,
harms one promoter or party, the effect is far greater. It
hurts everybody. I just want to keep things from getting
shut down. I don't have solutions, I'm just upset about it.

***We're very excited about our party on the 12th,
so we're gonna keep looking!

sure.  this is at least the third or fourth time they've played around
here since i got here in may.  the first time i saw them in the bay
area was at satori this summer, same warehouse in oakland, but the gig
was pretty much a rave with crash worship repacing the dj in one of
the rooms.

i heard about a socal desertconcert they played at, it was an all
weekend affair with a rave area and a band area, the band area was
more or less deserted so cw just skipped getting on stage, grabbed
their drums, fireworks and fruit and dived into the masses of
candykids, doing their tribal bachanailian thing, exept in time with
the dj, apparently the ravers loved it...

OK.. I talked to the doctor in the ICU unit last night, and she is doing fine.
They were able to bring her back, and the prognoses looks positive.  She was in
very bad shape, and almost died.  her life will never be the same.

I hope that maybe this will serve as a lesson and a learning experince that drugs
are NOT save.

keep it real... Vlad

This is a good theory.  Taking E will never again feel like the first
time.  It will feel good, but your brain conditions you for each
subsequent dosage after the first.  It has to do with the response effect
and the conditioned incentive effect controlled by the basolateral
amygdala(BLA) area of the brain.  But you are right, waiting six months
will increase the feeling, but never reach the first time where you did
not know what to expect and your body was new to the introduction of the
foriegn material.

Well I hope everyone had a safe and happy holiday? I
sure did I hope some of us took a little time to
reflect on life, the scene, future plans etc?? Well I
have to give it up to the Feel Good Family for
putting on a good party. It was on a smaller scale
then the normal events they do. It was nice plenty of
room to dance and trance etc.. Always good loud sound
and good visuals and lasers etc.. However I was not
pleased with Paucus's setup I used his equipment. I
am not sure if it was the sound guy or Paucus that
set it up but it sucked. I was a little disapointed
cause I have played for Vlad many times and the sound
has been but the utmost best. So I guess someone
other then a sound guy set up it was really low and
as a result I had a real shitty set. Well some people
said it was nice but I did not like it personally.
That is not Vlad's fault however it is the person
that hooked it up. Word of advice for DJ's out there.
DON'T buy the MOJO rane it is a piece of shit. Well I
better not be so biased it was not good for me I
should say. But the Aphex by intimadation that I
picked up a couple of weeeks ago rocks!!!. I have to
say that all the DJ's I Heard that night rocked the
house!!! My boy Vertigo was on the one. We was
ripping it up on the trancey shit. Slim was good
Moshe was playing some dope downtempo and then busted
out the Jungle stylie. I caught the end of Josh's set
and it was nice acid groovy house. Tripnotix and
paucus played some nice acid breaks. O and I scored a
new rekkid by EFX personally.. Thankx EFX even though
he is not on the list that was way dope. All and all
it was a nice party with good people. Sorry my
performance was not up to par.. 

Peace,
Macadio

My only comment on all of this is 
that I still say that Plur is lacking as a phiosiphy for life in that
without Acceptance of what IS you can't truly reach the other 4

So with peace love unity respect and acceptance within life 

I say that there is more then one thus

PLURAL

James

yeah I know I could be wrong 

but that's what makes life so much fun

Hello everyone,

Just a reminder that tonight from 9pm-2am at the Bahia Cabana is Inhabit
the Machines with special guests from Scotland: Neil Landstrumm and Tobias
Schmidt LIVE (Scandinavia, Tresor, Mosquito Records) along with Dave
Tarrida of Sativae Records.

The abrupt ending of the Space Children party at 3:55am cut Neil and Toby's
set to just 25 minutes, so this will be their only true live set in San
Francisco.  If you're into techno, I urge you all to come and check it out,
because these guys are some of the most creative minds in the genre.

The lineup will be as follows:
9-10pm sutekh
10-11:30: jon williams
11:30-12:30: neil landstrumm and tobias schmidt LIVE
12:30-2: dave tarrida

Cover charge will be $5, the Bahia is located at 1600 Market at Franklin in
SF.  It will be an 18+ event.

Hope to see you there!

Seth

E.S.W.H./E.S.D.S./H.O.B.M./H.O.M.E./E.S.J.M./HB-J, Jo, G, L
Stood for.  HOME was the Healing of our Mother Earth etc.  
And I tried the www page... didn't work for me.  

Peace! And thanks...

Does anyone have negative opinions of Space Children Rave, I do.  But this
weekend they did have great music.  Eat Static and Micheal Dog stole the
show, I came to see them and once they put me on their guest list those
Space Children ***** finaly let us in.  but in general I have found Space
Children raves to be much like Oakland raves:  Too crowded, angry people
just out to get money, and too many drug dealers just ready to fight in
another invades their territory.  Smaller SF raves are always the way to
go.  Sounds like SPIRIT was more fun.

I don't know about your friend
but I slept at spirit on one
just because of a general body tiredness
It was just a 2 hour nap and then I was gruven
it might not be bad e but just a general need for the body to rest
ask him how his sleep was
maybe he dreamed the wonderus dream

though thinking about it I can't really say I was asleep but more of a
very deep meditative state

If any of you really love ambient music go see  Ambient Temple of
Imagination (ATOI)
this extremely diverse group can make you melt, I swear! .  They recently
put out  a new CD which is mostly the live  performance form last years
The Gathering, which I missed.  Yipeee, this will definitely get me to a
massive.

I was pretty pissed that it ended at 4am...take about a gip for your
money.  Eat Static did rock the house, and so did Micheal Dog.  Barry
Weaver also played some nice tecno.  The DJ after Eat Static was horrible,
IMHO.  If you are going to charge $20 for a party it had better go until
6am at least!!

By doing a bit of research *this* is what I found out about this whole thing:

haK works @ solid grooves (hi Thad).  Used to be with a drum & bass crew
but is now solo.  Why I dunno.

Solar was in the store.  When Solar buys jungle it is usually because there
aren't good hosue tracks out, but Solar *does* buy jungle.

Solar was put into the jungle room @ stompy.  This was his *first official*
jungle gig (officail = being put on a flyer).

Now you can draw whatever conclusions you will from this information, but
on the surface it seems like there may, and I repeat may, be some
professional jealousy (I mean after all, I see Solar's name on all kinds of
flyers, while I rarely if ever have seen haK's name on flyers in recent
history).  I cannot guess people's motiviations for being so mean
spiritied.  Since haK works at Solid Grooves it would have been appropriate
for him to take it directly to Solar, after all, he will have more than one
opportunity to take it to his face.  Why haK chose NOT to take it direct
and do it so publicly where Solar can't defend himself is the mystery of
the ages.

The worse thing however is how this reflects upon Harry Who and Brandon who
jointly own Solid Grooves.  I do wonder if they like their employees
talking noise about a well respected figure in the house community, who
happens to be one of the people who helps keep Solid Grooves in business by
purchasing lots of records.

IMO, hak has done Solid Grooves a grave disservice, and has misrepresented
the spirit and the vibe that solid grooves is all about.  Hey if you're a
house DJ who has expanded your horizons shouldn;t you be able to flex some
of that muscle in your favorite south bay store?  I dunno.  I will ask
Harry & Brandon personally if they agree with haK's position and his
attitude.

This story has gone far outside of SFRaves.  Alot of people I know are
talking about it.  I'll let Harry & Brandon decide if they like how their
store is being represented.  If I know anything about these men after these
years, I can only guess that they will not be pleased.

If haK would've taken it to Solar's face all these unpleasantries would
have been avoided.  Cowardice never pays off.

Peace,
John

 I think I know what you're saying. But I would word it differently.
After all, I am a part of society and I obviously think differently. I
would say that members of our society today find comfort in not feeling
responsible for negative events in their life.

This is true. Methamphetamines are often combined with MDMA as "filler",
however, and I'm shure sometimes people will sell straight speed as "E".
And unless you whipped up the batch yourself or got a lab report you
can't tell before hand. I think it's pretty common to get
Methamphetamines when some one "takes E" at a party. Heck, you could
even say this is advantagous for dealers because the addiction hooks the
customer. Even more reason to sell Methamphetamines as E with or without
combining MDMA. Ecstacy is just a word. MDMA is expensive.

Because Pengo, in today's society we are taught that one is never
responsible for the negative results of your own actions, but rather that
is always the fault of some external source. 

If someone gets shot, it is obviously the gun manufacturers fault for
making a the gun. If someone falls through a roof while comitting a
robbery it is obviously the owners fault, and if someone od's rather it be
accidentally or disrespect of their own body and limits, it is obviously
the dealers fault.

1) What are "Methandpedimines?" :-)
2) If you mean methamphetamines, yes abuse and addiction do happen with
   them. However MDMA while related to methamphetamines is not a 
   methamphetamine.

OH MY!!! was BiGFLOOR a good party. I have never been to a MASSIVE
before but I was definitley pleased with MR DJ DAN and Gould. Just when
you think the music cannot make you ORGASM anymore it does again...
and then it builds and you come again...and then when you are about to
die from pleasure and happiness the music builds and builds and you
come into heaven. I was sober at this rave (Bet you can't tell) ,but
i believe in sober raving now. Everything has a place. I had heard a lot
of bad things about HOMEBASE raves, but i had never been to one. I have
always gone to Outdoor UG's, but this was not to Shabby. 
Love you Lovers...

wow that's odd.
to be honest, i always thought that SFR'rs aren't around age 15. (hi
patrice hunny!)
the majority of SFR'rs i know are in their 20's, 30's, even some of them
in their 40's. only a few do i know that are under the age of 18.
in fact, only like.. 4 of you i think.

hardly any massive can represent the true nature/spirit of SFR. yanno?
:)

i've seen people fall asleep on E before. see, that means that they're
eitehr really tired, really bored, and/or their E has little/no speed in
it, prolly pure.
sweet dreams to your friend~~

Here are my little penny's of thoughts about Spirit ....

1 cent.  ATMOSPHERE:  Vlad really does a great job making a space for a
party.... I don't remember any lasers at all (were there any?) but every
room had cool visuals (I esp liked the wall-sized projections in the
hip-hop funky room, very cool).... and the chill room (which I never really
went in to) looked supercomfortable... and I like that it had no music...
the  better to hear you with, my dear!  Really well setup.

2 cents.  FRIENDS:  Some great people were there.  Plus I got to meet some
sfravers i've never met before (hi doreen!) and see lots of old friends....
it's always a pleasure to put faces with names, and to see how open and
friendly and unique so many of the sfravers are...  you guys rock.

3 cents.  MUSIC & DANCING:  The lineup was great, lots of variety.... and
Vlad, that projection of the lineup schedule on the wall was perfect, it
made it so easy to see who was where and when! I didn't stay late, but
every set I heard was great and got the crowd going (but i'm bummed I only
heard Moshe's triphop, I missed his jungle)...

I heard many dj's, who are notoriously hard to please, talking about some
of the sets they heard that night, and that's saying something.... Carlos'
set really blew away a lot of people especially.

4 cents.  ATTITUDES:  On the down side, and maybe it was just me and that i
was tired in the first place, but the attitude of many of the kids who were
there both annoys and depresses me!  They stand at the wall and stare as
you walk by, just pulsing out a cold street vibe... what is up with that?
Does their life require such insulation to protect them that they can
*never* just relax and have fun?

And the circles.... I'm not completely down on circles... I love to watch
people dance... probably *more* than the next person... but I just think it
really sucks to have circles that take up most of a room, where 40 guys
wearing versions of the same outfit are watching one person at a time
dance... i guess to me, dancing just isn't a spectator sport ... especially
when they start the circle by walking in a widening spiral with street
attitude, pushing people away and then turning their back on you, now that
they've seized the territory where you were dancing just moments before.
Ever notice these guys aren't smiling?  That's because, underneath, I don't
think it's about having fun to them.   It's about territory and staking a
claim, and excluding people outside your group, and that's against the
fundamental spirit of raving to me.

5 cents.  BUNK:  Nasty dealers hawking their wares, which kids then find
out were $20 aspirins, make me sick.  Want a little tip?  Never buy
anything from a someone you'd be afraid to meet in a dark alley.... in life
in general, do business with your friends... and if you can't find a
friend, maybe you should just wait for another time.  Because thugs who
stand at doors chanting "x" and "k" and "doses" aren't really going to be
looking out for you, now, are they?  Nope, so you have to look after
yourself, and never put yourself at the mercy of creeps like this.  Because
$20 aspirin would be the *least* of your worries with some of these
guys.... remember, this is your life you're talking about here, who do you
want to trust with it?

Overall, this was a good little (big) party, with a great setup and lots of
great music.... and maybe if i weren't so tired (wish i could get rid of
this danged cold!), I would have been able to get through the attitude
factor.... but even with such a strong contingent of cool ravers there, the
numbers of thugs with attitude affects my comfort level, unfortunately.
Even if boomerang *was* wearing a dress and all.  But my poinsettia
headpiece did get to make its seasonal debut, which is a good thing, and I
did get to dance a bit, and that's good too!

love, leslie

I love it when people do this type of thing.  Somebody has a knowledge of
someone and quantifies it.  Ok I'll do the same.  I knew Harry when he was
throwing parties before there was a Solid Grooves.  I remeber when Harry
first opened his store.  I've known Mr. Who for a very long time (I even
know his *real* last name).  Whether he knows Harry or not, I doubt he
spoke to Harry before sending out his missive.  It is further problematoc
because haK is an associate of Solid Grooves and when he makes statements
such as "don;t ever come to solid grooves
you fool, never support the schemers........"  is a de facto banning from a
record store.  One can only ask under whose authority?  Since I *know* that
haK doesn't own one square foot of the store, and since he is acting as a
representative of the store, is he doing the store justice by his vitriol
and missives?  Furthermore is this how Hary & Brandon want their store
represented?

Lastly, knowledge of a person does not necessarily allow one to represent a
person.  Especially in the negative as haK has done.

 the handful of people I've met have all told me that the SJ area sucks, go
 up to SF.  and I'm sick of it.  I've heard enough people (on this list, in
 person, and in the papers) mention that there's nothing to do down
 here, that I know that the potential exists to do something cool. let's

Highlights:

Macadio and Micron's tag team set, with all the sfr people in front of the
decks going crazy! Ooooh the vibe was thick thick thick during their set!
That was the best part of the night!

Meeting sfr people that I haven't met yet...

Hearing that Goldie with KRS One track in the rilly stuffy room! I liked
that!

The fact that it was at Home Base and I have NEVER been there! I finnally saw
what all the fuss was about!

I have to agree with whoever said that the vibe was spotty throughout the
night. The chill room was hardly a comfy place to chill, more like a sauna to
me!

Overall, I had a pretty good time....I hope that everyone else who went did
too...

Till then...
Spread some v!be...

hmmm... i have to disagree here.....
i am one of those people that stand around the circle and watch guys 
show off their moves and I even participate once in a while ;)
BUT.....i dont think everyone in the circle especially myself are all 
about territory and staking a claim...
I agree some guys are, but they usually aren't ravers......
if the circle gets too crowded..... i go next next to the speakers where 
veryone is hugging and dancing and sweating and jumping up and down..
i guess what im trying to say is.. please dont generalize that the break 
circles do more harm than good... cause it makes me feel bad...
ok..thats all....im not one to flame much..

Is there any kind of a goa/trance/psytrance/etc scene anywhere south of SF?
I'm moving SOMEWHERE in the valley in January (probably within 1 hour of
Burlingame, my company is opening a branch office and we're probably hiring
two guys outta there) and I've wanted to get a non-pretentious scene going
here (in NJ) for a bit, but haven't done it.  I dunno, maybe the time is
coming up...

I dunno - I wouldn't generalize to that extent. It seems like 
Space Children have been throwing some very big parties recently,
but I was at the Space Children Return to the Source party at the
Troc earlier this year and had a great time! It wasn't a huge party -
I guess they do some big events and some smaller ones - maybe you
should look out for the smaller ones. DRC and Dutch blew me away!

                CHECK OUT  www.partnercomm.com/~raveinfo/ 	


                  The RAVEDATA project needs your help!
 

 Some of you have seen our messages on the list, some can tell you how
they like using our "North American Rave Promoter Index" also known as the
"fonebook" to get connected, and still others might say how they have
enjoyed trading mixtapes and flyers with us...

 That's just the beginning!  We're making a last attempt to compile
some missing data that we would like to add before our site goes "live"
on February 1, 1998.  We're just about ready to present the result: the
world's largest rave-oriented database -- tracking all KINDS of
information,worldwide!  Why?  

	1 - To bring more talent and energy together (unity)
	2 - To recognize those in the scene who have done so much
             (respect)
	3 - To factually "set the record straight" after a lot of bad 
             news media (peace)
	4 - To bring alive those memories of our favorite events gone-by
             and our friends who were there to share them with us (love)


If that's RAVE D-A-T-A, What's this RAVE I-N-F-O stuff??
--------------------------------------------------------
 Raveinfo is what we call our attempt to ask YOU for those missing
bits and pieces of information we've missed along the way.  We can't do it 
alone... So, check out the site and e-mail us with *ANY* info you may
have!!  We've recently re-organized some things to make it even easier to
get around.

Think of this as RAVE trivial pursuit!!  Test your rave knowledge.  Many
of you have helped us before and we need you again!  This is our LAST
chance to add new information and we would like to make it as thorough as
possible to make it easier and better for you guys and gals! We have lists 
of dj's without cities, events without attendance, cost, city, promoter's
without phone numbers, phone numbers without promoters...and most of all
we have LOTS of dj's without birthdays (MM/DD/YY)!!  

Thanks!!

Love and Lollipops-

yeah... yeah... another review:

just want to add a little to all that's already been said...

maybe i'm being nit-picky... BUT --->

-KEEP OUR RAVES CLEAN-
as a graphic designer, i DO understand the need for really snazzy looking
flyers to advertise all of the exciting upcoming events... but do we need
hand millions out to everyone 5 times over?  what a pain it must have been
for all the people who had to clean up after that mess!  and what a waste
of paper- those poor trees!  wouldn't it work better in all aspects to
leave these flyers in piles by the door? ...grab em' on the way out- IF we
choose to?
OK- so it wouldn't make the floors completely litter free... but it would
help.  it just amazes me- i thought that everyone there, is there to dance
and have fun at 'our' party- why doesn't anyone respect the place and use
the garbage cans? (they weren't even full!)
the floors were disgusting and dangerous to dance, sit, and even walk on
due to the flyers, water bottles, bottle caps, cigarette butts, gum...
blah, blah, blah...
doesn't anyone else notice or care? 
*
-X, doses, K, X, doses, K, X, doses, K, X, doses, K, X, doses, K, X, doses,
K,-
enough already! 
5am and still dealing!  i can't imagine why anyone would need any more mind
altering substances at that hour... but then again as said in every other
post-- no logic w/ dealers... it just got really annoying, scary, and
pathetic...  p-leeeeease be careful!
*
-VIBE?-
what vibe? not much there at first... admitting it got better towards then
end... (think it was due to the incredible music- thanks!!!) a definite mix
of people- nice to see all shapes, colors, sizes, styles... although i
prefer one kind of attitude- don't we go to parties to have... fun?
at least i found PLUR on all the walls!  all was good!  
nice decor! not left unappreciated!  :)
*
-MU-SICK!-
the line up was amazing! i have to admit i had a hard time figuring out
which room was which- don't know what most of the dj's look like and the
style changes from dj ~> dj  (didn't always match up w/ room names...) but
i'm not complaining! great mix! at one point, i went from room to room...
couldn't decide where to settle- ALL AMAZING! 
wish i could have met some more sfravers... (missed e-mails verifying
meeting spot) 
... always next party! :)
-DJ's-
great to finally hear a lot of you spin! 
VERY IMPRESSIVE!
keep up the great music~~> completely changed the vibe!

yeah, um, well, i know where he's coming from.  sometimes you just
gotta remind yourself why it's better to wait.  and a two-week break
is better than two days, i always say.  but the killer highs you get
after a nice long break from _whatever_ is always worth the wait, imho.

things you can do while you're waiting: ghb, 2cb (still lookin!),
royal jelly, thc, ketamine, ephedrine, complete absolute 100% sobriety
(takes about a month for that amazing drug-free high to kick in,
unfortunately, but it's SO cool when it does), more thc, lsd, shrooms,
peyote, fasting, caffine, cocaine (well if someone offers anyways),
adrinelin, n2o, orange/banana/spirulina smoothies, alcohol, opium,
ammyl nitrate, valium, vicodin, maybe a little more thc...  not all at
once, of course...

things i personally can't recommend doing while you're waitng: 
heroin, crystal meth, crack, robotussin...

what i'm tryin to say here is, i sorta feel like taking a wide variety
of drugs one (or maybe two) at a time, in some sort of moderation,
with a chill-out period thrown in every once in a while, is sooo much
healthier than taking any one of them over and over and over again. 
not that there aren't bad sides to taking drugs period, but lets face
it, pretty much everyone does anyway (alcohol is a drug, caffine is a
drug).  when you start doing any one of them on a regular basis you
become much more likely to get addicted, which leads you to take more
and more and feel less and less with greater frequency as time goes
by, often resulting in lost friends, lost jobs, lost s.o.'s, and
occasionally some subtle (or not-so-subtle) irreparable brain damage. 
this is bad.  so anyway, that's my
old-guy-who-still-gets-high-and-also-has-a-life advice (since you
wouldn't listen to me if i told you all to just say no, not that i
would anyway ;)  variety is the spice of life, i always say.

Awwwwww yeah,

Went visiting to south lake again this past weekend and I must say.

1. Heavenly has the best view I have seen but the boarding was fer shit.
   Too many people (lots of accidents and injuries) for  not even half the
   mountain being open oh well, I was meeting friends.

2. Kirkwood is the bomb.  I am not sure if its the angle or what but there   
   was still some fresh powder to be found just off the beaten track 3 days
   since the last snow.  Lots of friendly people out there.  Also ran into 
   chris and randy very kool, They hadn't slept since bigfloor the night
   before I felt their pain =)

All and all I had a great weekend but Kirkwood is great and really close.

hope to see all of you up on the slopes sooner or later

Messiah's post got me thinking about what stuff I've found myself 
enjoying during periods of sobriety (mostly due to the fact that I drive 
myself to almost everything I go to down here).  So here are some of 
Uncle Noah's reccomendation of things to entertain yourself with while 
raving sober:

-smoothies.  yes.  I read this one and thought of many a happy night 
listening to the big beats and sipping a yummy beverage.  I think fruit 
drinks in general are good, not just smoothies. :)

-Gummi Life Savers and naturally sparkling water.  Fun sober, **VERY** 
fun on E...

-Those irritating puzzles where you have to like remove a ring from a 
string that's tied to a block of wood.  These give you something to do 
with your hands and brain and are quite fun.  Someday you figure them 
out, but then you just go buy another one.

-Mr. Potatohead.  'nuff said.

-Vibrating Mr. Potatohead.  fun for releaving those sore muscles after 
dancing for four or five hours, and really fun to put on your friends who 
are not presently abstaining.

:)

i have a few suggestions for those of you who find it hard to make a fun
night of sobriety.

-- power bars. with lots of water. they have tons of carbos, and they can
dehydrate you. but, you'll have no problem dancing your booty off. or, as
i used to, dart across a pool back and forth a few times :)

-- pacifiers. candyraver i am not, but i am also not a big fan of
cavities. i really love gum, but if i don't have sugarless gum i'd rather
suck on my pacy, which doesn't give my mouth a sticky feel OR my teeth a
sugar coating. i swear to god.

-- invest in a blank book. i did a year ago and some people have written
some incredibly rad things in it. it's fun to sit down and read it
sometimes if i'm getting a bit tired. some of the poetry in it can inspire
me to jump right back up and start groovin again.

-- take a nap. swear to god again! get a friend to wake you up, you'll
feel revived. missing a couple hours at a party won't kill you.

-- slap on a smile. people will smile right back. 

-- strike up a conversation.

-- dance your god damn ass off! then pass out in front of a speaker for
the rest of the night (ahh a whole half hour of dancing!) ;)

-- start talking and thinking in rhymes... i.e.
..."those wicked phat beats just make me think
I wonder if it's ME that stinks."
(or)
"hey boy
be my toy!"
(JUST AN EXAMPLE OK? i can't rhyme creatively on demand)
ok ok i'll stop, i'm beginning to pull things outta my ass.
anyway, hope that helped.
xo

i have a flyer here for a weekly at "the usual" in san jose.  the number
is 888 882 21XL

the party is called 21XL and is thrown by legend entertainment.  it was
supposed to start on nov 15th, so it's a pretty recent event i'd
guess.... haven't been myself though... i have a car and usually go to
the city or the east bay... as they say, if you're not part of the
solution, you're part of the problem!

Well well....I am sure you have all read the otehr revies about
Spirit, but I figured I'd throw in one more quick one!
  Highlight of my night was Micron+Macadio...mad props to you two! 
Especially when Micron spun TWO Commander Tom Records in a
row...<sigh>  Noom 13, and the *NEW* Mars nad Commander Tom one!  I
think i had about a 10 mintue floorgasm!  (For anyone that saw me,
they'll agree!)
Next up on my best o' the night list has to be Moshe spinning PHAT ass
Jungle, Vertigo spinning the "eXtacy" song, (damm...I LuV that one
live!), and everything about DRC, but I have to give the girl mad
props, for the 2nd time that night, I heard the NEW Commander Tom/Mars
Record...everytime I hear it, I seem to like it more!  Other than
that...met two KEWL KEWL kand*E* kidZ from LA, they LikEd the part*E*
too!  Hope evryone I saw ther had a great time, and those I didn't see
there btu were...LOOK FOR ME NEXT TIME!  ;^*  This massive definately
brought back my faith in the Massive scene up here
HugZ, LuV, and PLUR-y thoughts...sNIKers

"Sometimes when i stay awake I close my eyes and make believe you
are...where?  By my side..oh yeah."

Hiya gang,

been busy so I haven't had a chance to get in the fray lately...

Recommendation:

I just bought Pete Tong's Essential Selection (from his Radio 1 show) and it's
completely solid.

In fact, I love it.

Great selection of house, some speed garage, and the programming is tight. 

It's an import so it'll set you back 30 bucks, but it's a two CD set, so it'd
be like buying two domestic CDs.

Maybe I should give a disclaimer to this as well: I was in england for a month
back in '93 and Pete's radio show on Friday nights was one of the best things
I ran into there (bsides the clubbing, of course). Taped the shows and still
have them. (Memories all alone in the moonlight... >>>> first time I heard
Sabres of Paradise's SmokeBelch II, one of my favorite all time tracks.....)

Secondly, I'll be sending a detailed review of the Metalheadz II album. Gotta
listen to it during the day today at work, first though...

Everybody, have a great day!

I did a while back but it was really kind of weird.  I usually cant
sleep at all, but at this one rave I was a dancin' and a groovin' and
then I got the feeling that I was overexerting myself because it was
soooo hot inside so I went outside to cool off, but then I started
peeking and it was too cold outside and I was cooling off waay too fast
so I found a spot inside but near the door and sat down to cool off.
While sitting there I noticed that if I closed my eyes for longer than
it takes to just blink I would instantly go into REM sleep and it was
like I would pop up inside a dream that was already in progress.  I
would do this for about 10 seconds at a time and it was pretty neat
actually because I was sitting there for about 20 minutes and when I got
back up to go dance I felt like I had just woken up from a good nights
sleep, which is something I almost never feel.  Then I danced my butt
off till they stopped playing music.

Hello everyone, I'd just like to add a couple more things to Mr. Noah's 
list of "what to do while partying sober", well actually it would be 
*my* little list of fun things to do while partying sober and taking 
advantage Of Noah's creative idea that I couldn't think of by myself.. 
:)

Whatever...

1)any food whatsoever, it makes me feel "happy"
2)if I go to a party by myself and I can't find any friends, I make sure 
that I bring my little ivy plant, it makes me feel not alone and he 
always listens when I have to talk.
3)Candy/gum/cigarretes for all those who are feeling left out and have a 
"notsohappy" happy face on, plus it makes you feel good. (Cigarettes are 
a false happiness though)
4)$ for water, for other people who need it more than yourself (if you 
are sure it is for water)
5)My lips are nice to bring for pecking my secure friends on the cheeck, 
or somethin' :P
6) Mad Libs are great.  Especially on the way home,  Nobody wants to 
play except for those people who are still going on whatever energy that 
their body can find (hi Jeremy! :P) Plus you can think about gross, 
nasty things without feeling guilty...  "I need a verb"
I always have to reply with "wait, what's a verb?"  So I'm usually not 
the best person to play with.
7) last, but not least, there is always my Slinky.  You can let people 
put in in their teeth and drop it on the floor for that "trippy" effect.  
You can also throw it at people who sell aspirin to your friends as 'e'  
and if anyone causes you any shit, you can strangle them and go to jail 
and meet new, and improved boyfriends...EEEWWWW!
And you can also set a slinky on a friends head who is screwed up on 
something and really confuse them...

Sorry, boredom is evil and so is evil and so are the "freaks" that were 
just on the Jenny Jones Show...

Peace,
Danny

Uncle Noah thought of this...

Interesting to one may not be to another. We are no longer "arguing"
over the same thing. The debate now seems to be on  age, age limits and the
proper ages to do various things.

You said "I signed onto this list to here people talk about raving and to
get different
>opinions and perspectives on different things. " Well, that's what you are
getting =)
But some of the "different things"  might be boring to you....but might be
interesting
to someone else.

I like Sober Raving =) *grin* but I don't think that is what we are talking
about any more....

I LIKE this list a lot :) I like how people have a lot to say about most
every topic and I think it's pretty interesting.

actually the "thing" is what is bad ... the thought couldn't hurt a fly ...
think of it this way, as an example, cigarettes are known to cause cancer,
whatever thoughts you may have about them ...

use, don't abuse ... moderation my friend

Well, I got to the party at like 11:30 or so and it was pouring down rain and
that sucked. There were so many people dancing. When DAN and DONALD GLAUDE
went on the party went off!!!!! They were so fucking tight. I haven't seen a
better set in a long time. Even my boyfriend, who usually doesn't really care
for the music said it was really good! The rave was soooo incredibaly HOT!!
Iwas dripping sweat from dancing so much!! I really had a good time. It was
kinda like an old-skool party!!! HOPe all of you had as much fun as I did!!
See you at PLANET ROCK in January!!
                      PEACE, <3 , and lots of :)    BECCA

    I, for one, Don't see anything wrong with Break Circles.  They may take
up room, but when you average it out, the large amount of room taken up by
the dancer + the small amount of room taken up by the cramped up crowd of
spectators = the same a mount of room if they were all (spectators & dancer)
were dancing separately.  And In addition... It's their Way of Expressing
themselves.   And really no different than other peoples unique form of
personal expression.
    I'm always happy to see Break Circles at one of my parties, as much as I
am to see a Coddle Puddle of Candy Ravers crowded on a bunch of backpacks,
camped out in the middle of the dance floor... Or a Trainspotting entourage
congregate in front of the DJ... or anything else that's adds its own
diversity to the mixed up flavor of an underground party.  It's this
diversity of people that gives raving its unique appeal.

Keep it Real.... Vlad

I totally Agree with you about the mess.  You guys should have seen the amount
of trash after the party... its astonishing!   As far as promotion is
concerned, I have always been a very liberal about letting promoters promote
any way they want at a party.  But its usually not the promoters that are at
fault in this situation.  The problem is with the Dope Dealers.  They will go
up to a promoter an ask if they can hand out flyers for them at the party, and
most promoters are way to eager to give them a fat stack of flyers.  This
allows the Dealer to have a means of approaching people and asking them if they
want to buy *&^% while giving them a flyer.  This is why so many flyers get
thrown on the ground, and why you are handed one at every doorway, and it seems
like there are 20 people promoting the same party.    If you keep your eyes
open, you will notice that there are rarely as many FGE flyers on the ground as
other flyers.. Why.. its simple.  Firstly.. we promote hand to hand.. not stack
by stack, and I ask all our promoters to pick up our flyers of the ground if
they see them and either recycle the ones they can or throw them into a garbage
can.  I feel that it does not compliment a party if everyone walks all over
your flyers as if they were garbage... it says little about the event.  Also we
have too much pride in our parties to let our flyers get stepped all over.  And
lastly, We do not allow drug dealers to pass out our flyers.  If anyone has
ever been offered one of our flyers with drugs, then they are not an official
FGE promoter, and If they are, I would appreciate it if anyone could e-mail me
privately and tell me so we can stop using that person as a promoter, because
we do not feel that it is a proper association, nor is it the image that we
want someone to pick up as a first impression when receiving one of our flyers.

It's called Market Share...  And yes it is pathetic, but to some people.. it's
their life... as well as a life style.   I don't know as many drug dealer as i
used to, and If I do then they are keeping it well hidden from me, so I'm at a
loss as to why there are so many of them mow days.  I was not particularly
happy with the amount of dealers at this last party.  Normally, we throw them
out, but we figured that this was a more underground party for us, and we would
let it ride out, but judging from peoples replies, we made a bad call on not
booting most of them out the front door.    FGE version of the Karma Patrol is
The P6 : Proactive Parasite Prevention and Pacification Patrol Program.  6
guards that do nothing but walk around kicking out drug dealers.  I did not
have them at Spirit, cause I did not think that there would be as big of a
problem with this at an underground party that was barley promoted, but I was
mistaken, cause there were even more drug dealers at our underground then we
have at our massives... HMMM.. Go Figure???  Next time I am not making that
mistake again.  Our P6 Unit, threw out 65 drug dealers at Megga Buzz Mania, and
there were 6000 people there.  I think that record could have been broken if I
had them at Spirit, which only had 1500 people.   I think that most of the
people on this list know my position when it comes to drugs and the lowlife
scum that sell them.

    The vibe was a bit on and off, but i would say more on then off depending
on were you were, and your attitude.  I would give it an overall 9/10 on the
vibe scale...  But this was by far the most fun i have ever had at one of my
own parties... It Rocked, and I saw nothing but SMILES all night long.  I think
it was just too cold outside that took away from the vibe.

I totally agree that having a lineup to look at helps you match music 
you like (or don't ) to the face and name...and also makes you notice 
how *fast* time flies when you're having F*U*N !!!
I personally think it's so annoying when you hear great tunes, don't

HEY!!!
Sorry its been awhile and i havn't been able to keep all of you posted, i
only have 2 more weeks of this semester and schools got the best of me! So
because of this ive been thinking more than doing on this party, i figured
that somehow it will all work out, i want it to happen soooo bad, so the
other day i was thinking that if this party was really ment to be it will
sort of come together for me and yesterday as i sat in one of the big purple
chairs at my work, my apron still on, a man approached me and asked if we had
a place where he could post a flyer, i told him i  was sorry and we didn't
have such a thing and he asked me to hold onto the flyer incase anybody asked
if any cabins in the area were for rent, without thinking of the
possiablities i told him surre and wished him a good day. As i sat there i
started reading about this cabin he had for rent...5bedroom, indoor spa,
greatroom, 2bath, spacious kitchen....So now we have a location kids!!!
*YAY* Im gunna call him up this afternoon and get the rest of the info, i
guess there also HUGE garage at this house, so thats always nice!! Im still
aiming fer febuary and, well, i went snowboarding the past 4 daze and its not
lookin too good, i wish all the rain you guys have been gettin would move on
up here! Make sure you lemme know if anyones plannin on comin up fer the day
or anythin, maybe we could meet up :o)
if you have any questions or anything lemme know, i'll be able to work on
this party more once school is out...till then much love take care!!!

You know what I hate?  I hate finding a nice spot by the speaker, getting
a nice groove on, and then being forced to move by somebody trying a
start a circle or by a circle that is getting larger.  And then repeating
this process throughout the night.  It is totally disrespectful.

You know what I also hate?  Trying to find a decent place to dance when
the dance floor is littered with backpacks and sitting bodies.  People
can get hurt!

I thought dancing all night with a large group of people to killer music
was what gave raving its unique appeal.  A dance floor is for dancing,
not sitting, showing off or spectating.

I wholeheartedly agree- I wish there were more
non-dancing things to do at a rave.
When we were at burning man the messiah and I and our
friends found this giant book at the black-dog cafe
and we had a blast doing group art in the book.  Ok
so we weren't anywhere neat sober- but I have seen
the book again at NOTV and they were as fun to do
sober.

I think part of the problem is that so most of the
time people feel like they have to be on drugs to be
allowed to participate in things:
a backrub from a sober person? unthinkable
someone straight making wacky art? 
what's wrong with that person.
or it me that thinks that drug use is the price of
admission for certain rave activities.

SPIRIT!

i walked in and was quite impressed with the set-up (FAR better than
the space children party the next night.  and it was $25.  i will
NEVER go to one of their parties again, i was very disappointed with
the set-up, dj's etc.  Eat static was OK) sorry i digress......

Anyways despite some serious technical problems i had great fun
spinning and i think mack-daddio did too regardless of his post.  =) 
It was cool to see so many SFR and UG dj's playing at a party that
size.  Good going vlad. 

everyone i met and talked to seemed to be happy and having a good
time.  A special thanks to those that were dancing during our set...u
guys don't know how happy it makes a dj to see people dancing.  YAY!!!!

Thanks to everyone that came.

again, I want to make it clear that I'm not *completely* down on circles...
I really like the fact that in a circle, people are watching each other, so
it not only lets people show their moves, but the attention of others also
inspires them to dance full-power, all-out for bursts at a time...  and
anything that makes you dance harder and better is a great thing... for the
person who is dancing.

But there was a point on Friday where in a room with about 200 people in
it, when you factored out the 10 trainspotters, and the 25 boys with
attitude hugging the wall, staring at the 25 people who were walking
through, then you were left with about 89 people standing in a huge circle,
watching *1* person dance.

Maybe it takes up the same amount of room, but it isn't the same... first,
only one person is dancing, and i'm sorry, but watching someone else dance
is *not* a form of personal expression, it's being a spectator.  second, a
circle is not a fluid thing... you can walk (or dance) through a crowded
dance floor (patiently and slowly of course) ... but you cannot cut through
a circle (i was virtually trapped for a chunk of time last week because i
couldn't cut through the wall of people's backs facing the center of a
circle, and had to wait 10 mins or so until it broke up before I could
leave the room)...

all i ask is that people who dance in these kinds of circles .... which are
different than smaller circles that form spontaneously and morph in and out
of existence... realize that rather than a vibe-maker, it can be a
vibe-killer... and that if you're watchin', you're not dancing, and if your
back is to the rest of the party, then you're missing a lot.

of course... i have a feeling that many of the dancers (or maybe i should
say watchers) in these big circles aren't on sfraves, because they're not
really ravers...  and maybe a lot of them just need to experience the true
power of a room of hundreds or thousands of people, all dancing at the same
time to the same beat, with the same vibe, and the same smile.... because
*that* is the power of the beat!!!

*and* lest we ever forget this one... i want to point out my most favorite
circle ever, which was last year at a feelgood party, was when lara and her
whole crew made a crazy super-raver circle outside at home base (lots of
space, lots of air), and i stood at the rail enjoying their moves for a
good long time!

love, leslie

I don't know how many times somebody came up to us at spirit and
went into a long schpiel about how great Bigfloor was going to be and
tried to get us to take a flier.  I got one weeks ago on Haight, looked
at another at Nikita, and at Phunkatek.  Anyone who was at spirit who
DIDN'T know about Bigfloor before showing up learned about it within
10 seconds of arrival.  Not to pick on Bigfloor or its promoters, but
this is symptomatic of most promotions that go on.  Leave your flier
by the door.  I will go through the stacks there and pick up the ones
that interest me.  Plus, if someone hands you a flier that you already
have, or don't want, etc, DON'T TAKE IT!!! So many people who are 
handing the things out have a veritable sea of the same flier about
their feet -- which, as has been pointed out, dosen't make the event
look good at all, plus the glossy ones are slippery!

I (I mean . . . my friend) have had good and bad luck purchasing "party
favors" at raves/clubs/on the street (fortunately none of the bad luck
has been TOO bad), but the best course is to deal with people you know
and trust.  Most of the time, though, people who have real problems
simply take too much, or too many combinations, or don't drink enough
water, etc.  Be extremely careful, puhleeeeeze!

My only problem with break circles is, like at spirit, I was grooving
one of the rooms to the trippy visuals on the screen instead of the
people inside the circle.  But then the trippy visuals disappeared, and
they showed the circle on the screen!  What a buzzkill!  Watching other
people dance inside a circle dosen't interest me, so I don't watch, but
on the screen?  Sorry.  Not my cup of darjeeling.

Just my 1/50th of a dollar.

I'd be very interested in anything that you find here in SJ. There are  a
few weeklies for people that are 21 or older (Velvet Shop, Rhythm, Nice),
but I know all kinds of people under 21 that would support a SJ scene. I
know some DJs that live down here that would love to spin if there was
only a "safe" venue that we could use. Maybe we should get in touch with
DJ Spun or somebody and get it all together.

First, thanks to everyone who came out last night for Inhabit the Machines
at the Bahia.  I know I had a great time, and I think Neil and Toby blew
more than one mind...

And if you didn't get enough of the boys from Scotland last night, they'll
be at Static tonight playing records (Neil Landstrumm and Dave Tarrida).
Toby Schmidt will be venturing out from the Oakland dungeons to provide
moral support.

Okay fellow SFRavers!  Like I have said before, I am new on the scene.
Being a very poor college student who's trying as hard as he can to afford
Christmas presents for his loved ones, I can only afford to go to one more
party before returning to San Diego for the holidays on December 21st.  I
want to go to one on the 20th (Saturday), and the only thing I have heard
about so far is CANDYLAND.  Is this going to be a good party?  Or should I
go to another one?  And if so, what whould I go to?  Your help in this is
greatly appreciated!  Thanks sooooo much in advance!
					Love,
					VespaRaver

Any event at the Maritime Hall WILL only go until 4 am, because that is the
latest latest time that place can have a party until...I discovered this over
the summer when I went to a couple of parties there, (Transcend, Power
Crystal, etc...none of which were any special parties or anything...) when I
payed $20 and expected the party to go all nite...to my disappointment, they
would kick us all out at the early hour of 4 am. Then, when people wanted to
linger outside for a little while to talk about afterparties or anything, the
staff would yell at us to leave >=\

So people,when there is any party at Maritime Hall, it will end at 4 am, if
not earlier! Remember this when you fork your money in! ;*)~

        The only reason that promoters get away with lying to you about their
parties is because they always get away with it.  If you all want this Bull Shit
to end, then YOU need to start to police your own Scene.  Many promoters have
very little integrity or self respect, and play the odds that people will either
forgive and forget, OR that the average 6 month turnaround in the scene will work
in their favor, cause after a year no one will be around to remember, and the new
people won't care.   Some promoters believe that because this is an underground
scene, then lying is accepted.  And many will say or do whatever it takes to get
the people to the parties.   These type of promoters <names suppressed> really
sicken me, cause they have no self respect and are only out for your money.   But
hay, this is the underground... If there were any sort of guarantees, then it
wouldn't be underground :)

Right on Vlad. By the way, what percentage of the profits from your
last party that you billed as a "benefit" went to the cause of the less
fortunate?

I totally Agree with you about the mess.  You guys should have seen the amount
of trash after the party... its astonishing!   As far as promotion is
concerned, I have always been a very liberal about letting promoters promote
any way they want at a party.  But its usually not the promoters that are at
fault in this situation.  The problem is with the Dope Dealers.  They will go
up to a promoter an ask if they can hand out flyers for them at the party, and
most promoters are way to eager to give them a fat stack of flyers.  This
allows the Dealer to have a means of approaching people and asking them if they
want to buy *&^% while giving them a flyer.  This is why so many flyers get
thrown on the ground, and why you are handed one at every doorway, and it seems
like there are 20 people promoting the same party.    If you keep your eyes
open, you will notice that there are rarely as many FGE flyers on the ground as
other flyers.. Why.. its simple.  Firstly.. we promote hand to hand.. not stack
by stack, and I ask all our promoters to pick up our flyers of the ground if
they see them and either recycle the ones they can or throw them into a garbage
can.  I feel that it does not compliment a party if everyone walks all over
your flyers as if they were garbage... it says little about the event.  Also we
have too much pride in our parties to let our flyers get stepped all over.  And
lastly, We do not allow drug dealers to pass out our flyers.  If anyone has
ever been offered one of our flyers with drugs, then they are not an official
FGE promoter, and If they are, I would appreciate it if anyone could e-mail me
privately and tell me so we can stop using that person as a promoter, because
we do not feel that it is a proper association, nor is it the image that we
want someone to pick up as a first impression when receiving one of our flyers.

It's called Market Share...  And yes it is pathetic, but to some people.. it's
their life... as well as a life style.   I don't know as many drug dealer as i
used to, and If I do then they are keeping it well hidden from me, so I'm at a
loss as to why there are so many of them mow days.  I was not particularly
happy with the amount of dealers at this last party.  Normally, we throw them
out, but we figured that this was a more underground party for us, and we would
let it ride out, but judging from peoples replies, we made a bad call on not
booting most of them out the front door.    FGE version of the Karma Patrol is
The P6 : Proactive Parasite Prevention and Pacification Patrol Program.  6
guards that do nothing but walk around kicking out drug dealers.  I did not
have them at Spirit, cause I did not think that there would be as big of a
problem with this at an underground party that was barley promoted, but I was
mistaken, cause there were even more drug dealers at our underground then we
have at our massives... HMMM.. Go Figure???  Next time I am not making that
mistake again.  Our P6 Unit, threw out 65 drug dealers at Megga Buzz Mania, and
there were 6000 people there.  I think that record could have been broken if I
had them at Spirit, which only had 1500 people.   I think that most of the
people on this list know my position when it comes to drugs and the lowlife
scum that sell them.

    The vibe was a bit on and off, but i would say more on then off depending
on were you were, and your attitude.  I would give it an overall 9/10 on the
vibe scale...  But this was by far the most fun i have ever had at one of my
own parties... It Rocked, and I saw nothing but SMILES all night long.  I think
it was just too cold outside that took away from the vibe.

Indeed... when there are over a thousand folks.. showing up... there is
really NO need to charge $20-30 a person... and not even give ANY breaks
at the door.. as for ending early... well... that is just lame... 

Folks.. look at the promoters... for the parties you go to... see
who/what you are supporting... 

We are the only ones who really care bout this.... We need to take some
responsibility...

Someone over on the Analogue Heaven mailing list just posted this...

This is EXACTLY the kind of thing *I'd* like to be involved in....
I'm hoping that this 'glad hand' thing (WHEN is the next one, anyways)
is at least a little like this...

Subject: Portland live elektronix/dj'ing


In defend our backwards (but progressing) city:  For the past two months,
I have been involved in organizing an electronic music weekly show (Thurs
9pm-2am) at the Jasmine Tree Lounge downtown in Portland.  The restuarant
owners are in no way against electronic instrumentation (they are somewhat
clueless-- as long as some people buy a few drinks).  Attendance has been
relatively HIGH (40-60 people peak) so this is a great opportunity for
local electronic music performers to play in the area.  Handmade (screen
printed, non-square, color) flyers are made weekly and the format is
loosely/ideally three acts a night:


1 'experimental' dj (lounge, non-electronic, any history of electronic
(pop, academic, experimental) ...incorporation of other synths/beatboxes
is encouraged and anything brought to dj'ing that is not found at raves
(scratching or dumb costumes) 

&

1 'expermental' performer (non-rhythmic and/or textural electronic music
performance) (ie. theremin, fx-based noise, modular madness,
ring-modulated violin would fit this) 

& 

1 'rhythm-based' electronic music performer (this is not exclusively
dance-music related, ie. syncopated or pattern-based electronics fits
here as well as sequencer-based modular work)

Also, we bring DAT and tape decks and have an open "local programmers play
their tracks" hour in which you can bring tracks (less than ten minutes
total) and play them for people.  but we try to make you sit on stage...

We're just going off senselessly...

I equate Thad's post to the Honeymooner's "well I otta" line.  Yes, it
said what you think it said, but I don't think he meant it quite the way
everybody is interpreting it, which is very literally.

It IS frustrating when you are interested in something that people seem to
attack for a long time, and then suddenly accept and ultimately
participate in, and I know Thad is a mellow cat, a good person, and very
much in a long term loving relationship with music, people and the scene.

I'd think it better if we all sorta blew it off.  The whole "how dare he
say something like that, especially about Solar" feel of this thread makes
me wonder how differently we would have treated the issue if it was
somebody else talking about somebody else...

This thread has been too much about who knows who and credentials, and not
addressing the basic issue, which I believe is Thad could have said that
in person and had everybody in the room understand that he feels a little
slighted, and is just blowing off a little steam and making light of the
whole thing by going off... but this is E mail, where everything is
admissible as evidence, before the court of SFRaves. 

Peace,
AndyW

First off, thanks Seth and the rest of the gang who put this together...

It was off to the Bahia for a night I knew I would regret, seeing as I had
to be at work the next day... but worth it.

When we got there, Seth was spinning some good blocky, scratchy funky
shit.  Not too minimal, not too noisy, all of it with a really good
groove. Yum. Drank Guiness. Met Catweasel (who should be on some flyers
soon if promoters know what's good, judgin gfrom his tape)& Jen (time
seems so crappy when you meet nice people and there's good music and a
dancefloor nearby, sorry to both if I seemed distant). I thought I'd heard
Sutekh before, but his set last night really struck me as very tasteful,
reminiscent of well...  Mad (most of whom showed up to check it out
anyway), which used to be a similar style of music with the same sound
system at the same location. 

John Williams came up next with a really banging, confident, housey
flowing techno sound that progressed towards the head shrinking style I so
love about him.  It may have been early evening but it was definitely a
little before half past four inside my head.  I probably enjoyed this part
of the evening most, even though John wasn't getting too brave, it's
always a pleasure to hear him. 

Well, I heard a record spin down and perked up my ears.  A tone starts
coming out of the sound system, just screaming for a beat, and stays that
way for a minute or so until people are just dying for a beat... they got
one (big and ridiculously bassy too :)... and then a second of another in
what seemed an almost obnoxious break that had nothing to do with the
first beat, and then it would go back into it.  They used a lot of very
strange breaks through out the set, and also kept referring back to themes
from earlier in their set.  By the end of their set, they started dropping
a couple of those weird stutter beats again as breaks, and had people just
screaming for more.  Very funky, very buzzy and scratchy sounding, very
experimental (some weird samples in there too, including DBX's I'm Losing
Control which I thought I'd imagined until someone else asked me if I'd
heard it)... I wasn't into all of it, but the parts that were "on" were
really...ON.  I would recommend the Toby and Neal show for anybody who
likes to be challenged with a lot of funky ass slower techno... I can't
guarantee you'll love all of it, but it was so sweet seeing different
people going off to different parts of the performance (like parts I felt
were just noise were getting this one girl to scream and fully go off
*yes!*).

Finally, Dave Tarrida closed with a very quirky set, playing some bent
stuff with lots of theremin and drone sound in it... sounds like he wasn't
mixing in tip-top form, but the records were bold, even in light of the
live act that had just left the booth... 

I didn't stay for all of his set, but I had a really great night, and the 
music was a lot more flowing and cohesive than I thought it might be
judging from the records I'd heard from the artists on vinyl.  All in all,
a pleasant surprise, and a nice weeknight journey.

The visuals started with network television (boo) and went to some really
cool, very primitive techno-looking clips of gas burners, out of focus
digital clocks, slinkys (yes Danny, they had slinkys, okay?), and all
kinds of weird closeups of everyday phenomenon from weird angles... a nice
change from the usual visual theme of "too much is just enough".

I dug the DJs all spinning very artsy, very warped stuff, and a lot of
folks that have a real passion for music in attendance.

A fun night...

Peace,
AndyW

i feel that thad had every right to express himself on sfr.  if he feels 
that a particular dj is hypocritical he should be able to say so here in 
a public venue.  there's nothing wrong with that.  it's just like people 
who write in saying that so-n-so crew says they love the scene but 
they're actually in it for the money.  people should be able to 
criticize whoever they want.

as for the whole "people have the right to change their minds (and music 
tastes)" topic, people should be open minded.  yes, everyone should be 
able to dislike a certain music at one point in time and then start 
liking it.  that is fine.  it is a different thing when people go aggro 
dissing something.  when i first started raving, lots of people would 
say that i was totally lame and only for losers and drug addicts and 
that ravers are stupid.  Now that i see some of those people raving, it 
pisses me off even more that they used to be so anti.  if they had just 
disliked raving b4 instead of talkin lotsa shit, then i wouldn't care if 
they changed their mind.

lastly, about the whole representing solid grooves thing. i think it 
really doesn't matter because people either: 1)didn't know who hak is 
and therefore wouldn't think that he is representing Solid; or 2) knew 
thad well enough to know that he works there in which case they would 
realize that the statements were thad's opinion's and not solid grooves 
new store rules.
anyways, it just seems like his statements are being made into a way 
bigger deal than they are.

we need to think of some creative solution to flyer trash

maybe promoters can offer somekind of prize to the person
who comes up with the most creative solution... something
like a yearlong free pass for two. How about it promoters?

I personally love these beautiful flyers that have been created
over the years...i collect them for the art. But i do
hate to see thousands of them laying in the trash...wasted.
(dang even the flyers get wasted at these drug parties =)

Perhaps small things can make a differnce until we find a solution.
How about some psychedlic no littering signs. We could create
a litter program...we could have a mascot
like smokey the bear or the cat in the hat or perhaps an alien.

maybe we could turn the trash into some kind of art project.
Perhaps a huge ball made entirely out of flyers that was taken from party
to party and everyone could stick there unwanted flyers on it
instead of the floor.

then when it got about ten feet in diameter we could get each 
promoter to bring their balls to the beach and we could
have a "burning balls" party...sort of a spin off of burning man.

A SMILE
         A SMILE costs nothing, but it creates much.
                It enriches those who receive
            without impoverishing those who give.
                   It happens in a flash,
        and the memory of it sometimes lasts forever.
    None are so rich that they can get along without it,
      and none are so poor but are richer for a smile.
              It creates happiness in the home,
               fosters goodwill in a business,
             and is the countersign of friends.
                  It is rest to the weary,
                daylight to the discouraged,
                    sunshine to the sad,
           and nature's best antidote for trouble.
      It cannot be bought, begged, borrowed or stolen,
   for it is something that is no earthly good to anybody
                   till it is given away.
                   And if it ever happens
  that some people should be too tired to give you a SMILE,
                 why not leave one of yours?
              For nobody needs a SMILE so much
            as those who have none left to give.

yeah, beleieve me, you do not know HOW distraught i was to learn when 
I was at Transcend with my roomate yuko that the party would be ending 
at 4:00 am.  we had taken a bus to the city, kicked it on haight for 
like 4 hours, then bussed it to the party...and there were NO busses 
coming back up to the santa rosa area unil 5:00am which left us on the 
streets of downtown san fran with an hour to kill.  MAN that sucked.  
luckily some guy let us kick it in his car for about a half hour...
then we got out, walked to the bus station a few blocks down and got 
followed by some frEak in a red truck playing loud salsa music.  it 
was sCARY kids!  i seriously feared my safety.  all i can say, is 
thank god i wasn't alone, i was watching yuko's back, and she was 
watching mine...and never agian will i go to a party unless i know i 
am able to get in to a car and drive away to safety somewhere.

Howzabout offering a discount at the door if you bring a flyer, any flyer.
If that got to be a common practice, I bet the flyers would get cleaned up
quick.

On the other hand, the effect of dancing itself seems to increase the more
I do it, to the extent that it now swamps the effect of any substance.
Surely others must have noticed this!

I wouldn't call it "sober" raving because dancing makes me feel anything
but sober
(I must not _look_ particularly sober either, given how often people ask me
for
some of whatever they think I'm on).

Dance is the Real Drug!

Ya, that's apparently how he's going to defend himself, but guys... I'm not
in this, and I don't want to be... but if I was getting flamed the way that
this guy is, I would probably be calling you clueless fucks too.  :)
 Especially because some people were convinced that he had noting to do with
Solid Grooves and were attacking him about it until yesterday, when you found
out that he was actually affiliated with the store.... and this string has
been going on for a long time.  oh boy.. Guess i'm in it now...  anyways..
 You were kind of careless for a while.  I don't condone what he said, I
think he was angry and maybe jealous, but the people that have been yelling
at him forever over it should at least figure out where he's coming from
before they comment.  I didn't say anything about teh original post, even
though I thought it was a pretty shitty thing to say, because I don't know
him.  So you guys get to say whatever you want, and there are some really
good points coming out of this string, but maybe you could stick to the topic
in a more general sense and take his name out of it.  Legal Disclaimer:
 That's just what I think...  please don't hurt me!  :-)

YES YES YES YES!!!  Some one has it!  LuV the Music, not the durgs!

heheheh...SoBeR RaVinG...have you tried it yet?  Scary as it sounds, I
talk to people, (and am somtimes guilty of it myself), that say things
like this..."yeah, and its jsut as much fun SOBER!"  Like that's a
suprise or something!  I party sober almost all the time, but for some
reason, always get that "what are YOU on?" look...<sigh> I know how
you feel Andrew!  Raving sober is every bit, if not more fun, because
you remember more names, (but never them all, its against the rulZ),
and know that everything you do is fun...plus cheaper!  Who wouldn't
LuV it?  Well, I think that's enough ranting and RaVinG!
HugZ!  sNIKers ;^)

Just a slight reminder to you all to think about AIDS tonight before you
go to bed. It's World AIDS Day, whatever that's supposed to mean. Someone
told me today "happy World AIDS Day" and i just about said "fuck off,"
because it sounded almost as if it were a damn HOLIDAY we are supposed to
CELEBRATE. Anyway... Losing a relative to AIDS, and a friend, and having
another uncle living with AIDS, I take the subject VERY seriously. World
AIDS Day has been a reflective one for me.

To me, it means remembering those who have suffered, and respecting those
who ARE suffering of AIDS.

It means remembering that all the new drugs on the market that suppress
AIDS and HIV do not necessarily STOP the virus. AIDS still kills.

It means remembering that AIDS is an EPIDEMIC. It is the leading cause of
death.. LEADING CAUSE PEOPLE for people ages 22-44 in the US of A.

It means remembering to put a condom on,being monogamous, or saying now.

It means asking your partner about their sexual background no matter HOW
awkward it is.

It means acknowledging the fact that we are all mortal, and an invisible
thing could clutch onto us and suck our life away from us, just because we
are careless at one moment in our life.

It means realizing that approximately 30 million people world-wide and 1
in 300 Americans are infected with HIV and you probably work with/go to
school with/know quite a few of them. 

It means realizing that nobody... not even YOU.. is immune.

It means reminding those who you love to be careful.

It means celebrating the life you have.

It means remembering Ryan White and that in ignorance, a little boy's life
was crushed as he was refused schooling. But he stood strong.

It means respecting life.

take care of yourselves.
be aware. 
in ignorance, this disease thrived. The president of the US (Reagan) did
not acknowledge the AIDS virus to the public until 25,000 americans had
already died of it. 
in ignorance, hate thrives.
in ignorance.. lies the death of humanity.

peace.

Um....who cares what's on 90210? I don't even watch TV.

I heard there was already an episode (though I did not see it)
where Brandon took Herbal Ecstasy and got it on with some girl.

When I first read this post I thought it was a joke. (sarcasm) but
if it is serious, you guys should all throw a huge free party somewhere
else. *grin*

Is this supposed to be filmed on new years? If so, i'm sure there
are already better parties to go to. Speaking of which, I am going
to be going down to San Francisco for new years =) What parties
do you guys recommend? I was thinking about cloud factory?

I just gotta say that Space Children always rocks my boat hard!!!
Sat night I walked in and one of my favorite DJ's on the table : TWERK.
He just knows how to hit that hard bass beat that i
love so much. Then Cesar but I seemed to get confused for a bit and but
the music still rocked hard and then Barry Weaver.....Eat Static rocked
it!!!!!  yeah!!! Then I went downstairs to listen to Galen who totally
kept my groove on. I kicked it for a while and had such a wonderful time.
Space Children always has my favorite DJ's-- always.  :) I know they
always try hard to give people a good party. Remember they had two bad run
inns and then threw a FREE party.  And also I can quote Cos when asked
if he broke even for a party that was dope but not many people were there,
"Well it's not so important to make money as it is for people to have
fun," with a grin on his face. They always fill my gut full of beautiful
rythmns....

FYI:  Did you know that 999 out of every 1000 raves do things other
than rave?  

  We all know this...and should be PROUD of it!!!  I LuV you all, and
want to chill with ya all, but maybe we should consider each other
outside of raving.  Something that my friend Alex said to Cricket will
forever stick in my mind, "You know, we both have lives outside of
raving, and one day I want to get together and talk about everything
that's NOT rave related."  I think that has to be one of the sweetest
things I have ever heard!  My proposition...with the disintegration of
City E, (WAAAAAAAA!!!! =*****(, we need a new place to chill/hang
out/have Orgys...whatever!  I know you are all LOVELY people, and
think it would be dandy for all of us to explore the other facets of
our fellow Ravers.  If there are any ideas...I would LOVE to hear
them...Hmm.....perhaps another movie night...I see a prime oppertunity
coming up after the the Party in Peoples park on the 7th.  Or anything
at all...just something for us to enjoy each others company, and have
FUN!

well its like size ...some say it doesnt matter but we all know
better.

But on second thought maybe age is not whats important ...but
rather what you do with it.

Word. It's important to be careful with each + every partner no
matter what your preference. I have all too many friends who
learned this the hard way.

I definitely think this relates to raving because i unfortunately
know several friends who've been e'ing and getting their
groove on and later went home with someone to uh...get their
groove on and deeply regretted it later.

at a party i went to awhile ago in vancouver bc they were giving
out condoms...does anything like that happen in SF?

i know none of us are kids in need of sex ed - but yet i still
see people acting as if they are! in my opinion plur includes
not just respect for others, but respect for yourself......it seems
so unimportant until it happens to someone you know or to you!

As a frequent sober party-goer
who loves to dance and swing
I often find to keep awake
It helps to take ginsing.
A natural herb 
it doesn't cost much cash
and helps me stay awake
to flip and dash =)
I also heard spirulina
(a form of seaweed)
is a healthy pick-me-up
for folks in need.
one thing about waiting
that makes it much neater
more money to party!
it is so much cheaper =)

love kim

Okay Okay, yea I took one last week and one two weeks ago. The
temptation to take Ecstacy again is powerful. I justified it in my mind
because I hadn't had any in nine months instead of six. Which means I'll
have to wait eight and a half months now (mid August, mmmm, camping
trips). But youre right, I wasn't exactly pacticing what I preached. :-)
Ofcource, like Messiah said, plenty of kinder(hint) things to do till
then.

saw a whole bunch of moving writings from fish, lara, ...  maybe it
has to do with the holidays.. 

my friend mike was particular big strong and tall
and inside he was soft gentle kind and much more
a poet composer writer anything he wanted to be
but above all he loved people and made them happy
the last valentine i found him crying along the wall
wished i were a woman whom he was looking for
he brought me on journeys to many a wonderous place
like the twin peak beach we named along the bay
on that fine spontaneous day i didn't have any gears
he carried me across the watery creek flowing for years
his footsteps across that creek had since faded away
but the ones he left in my heart remained to this days


hugssss...

 Age DOES matter in some situations. Sex for instance.  ;)

Hello,
	I don't know any of you, but I already feel like I do because I've
been reading your lively discussions regarding sex, drugs, and of course,
raving. My name is Humberto Macias, and I am new in the area. I'm
originally from So Cal, Chino (ten minutes from  Ontario Airport) Souther 
California to be exact. I could go on for hours about myself, but I won't.
I'll spare you the boredom, but I just wanted to introduce myself.
					Humberto Macias

But you have to be cautious, as you could break from yoga, no? ;-)

i hate to make fun of such a serious subject, BUT...


while reading your post lara, i found this kind of ironic:


<paraindent><param>left</param>>It means remembering to put a condom
on,being monogamous, or saying now.

</paraindent>

i've tried saying now... but it doesn't seem to help with protection,
just makes things go a little quicker! hee! hee!


it's funny how one little typo can change EVERYTHING!

Up & Down is becoming a fairly reliable Sunday night
spot. Demilo and Norman both spun great sets and
started the evening off right.

Got to Spundae at about 2:15 and Terry Mullen popped
in 
for a suprise set. He played harder stuff than I
remember him playing, I liked the switch. Some kid
trainspotting asked him the name of this rekkid that
he really liked just as he was putting it in the sleeve
so he handed him the rekkid and said, "Do you spin?" 
The kid repplied, "Yes!" so he said keep it! The kid
looked at him puzzled, so Terry said, "If you really
like it I will give it to you?" So the kid bout' jumped
out of his skin with delight. Now that is what this
scene is all about.

I would first like to start by extending a huge thanks to everyone that
supported and experienced 'The Spirit of Giving".  I hope you all had a
great time.

The following is a list of specifics regarding the party and the
donation.

>From the 2000 person expected attendance, there was an actual attendance
of 1200 paid attendees (1400 total attendees).   With an average ticket
price of $17.50... generating a total gross of 20K.  The event came to a
final budget of only $17K ... leaving a net profit of $3K.  Of which FGE
will Donate $2K to the Bay Area Homeless Alliance / Coalition.  The
remainder of the proceeds will go towards The Cost of Living Fund.   In
addition there was over 2000 pounds of caned food collected, as well as
several large Glad Bags full of clothing and blankets, which will be
donated to project Open Hand.

We are very happy with the outcome of this party.  It was a Solid event,
with great production and excellent music, and a Very Pleasant Vibe.
There were absolutely NO drug overdoses, no Emergency Service calls, No
Arrests, No Citations, An No Vehicle Break-ins.

However there was some Tags and Graffiti in the Porto potties and
hallway.  And the worst experience of the party was the Theft of 8
banners from our hallway.  This type of disrespectful shit really made
me loose my cool.  For someone to steal.. not one, but 8 banners, that
were hung out of reach in the hallway, was definitely premeditated and
planned out.  This added to the 6 Banners stolen at Megga Buzz Mania, to
a total of 14 banners in 2 parties.  If anyone knows were they are, or
saw anyone taking them down... Please e-mail me privately.

Everything else went very smooth.  Thanks again for your support, and
belief.

Yours in the bond of PLUR.... Vlad aka Ray Vonie.... Keep it Real! :)

How about...
	At a party have a projector set up to show slides of flyers onto a wall
or screen...people wishing to promote their stuff at the party bring a
slide for the projector and stack of flyers for near the door.  People
could clearly see the promotion (it's often hard or impossible to read a
flyer while on the dancefloor anyway which is why so many get chucked of
stuffed into a pocket to be read later or accidentally go through the
wash) and if interested they could pick up a flyer on the way out.  Plus
you could make creative promotions that could incorporate a couple of
slides an be very visually pleasing.
	And/Or...return all the leftover/dropped/wasted flyers to the promoter
of origin so that they can more accurately judge how many flyers to
produce in the future to lessen future waste.  Plus it will be useful to
the promoter because if they look at the flyers they can judge...
	# of leftover clean flyers = interest in design of the flyer from
partygoers.
	# of leftover flyers with footprints on them = how effective
distribution of the flyers was.
To accomplish this perhaps promoters, when leaving the stacks of flyers
at the door could leave them in an appropriately sized box with the
flyers inside and the promoters mailing address on the outside so that
after a party the leftovers could be sent back to them.

Just some quick Ideas...What do ya think?

Here's a novel idea:  How about if the promoters kept their damned
websites up to date!!!  Almost every flier I get has a URL on it,
but 95% of the sites I've seen are WAY out of date (like the 
SpaceChildren site talks about Oct 4, fcol!)  If anyone out there
is a promoter with a website, I can help!!!

WaHoo,
Steve.

Yo, if Thad or Hak or whomever he is today wants to play at Stompy, then he
should give the Stompy people a tape or something. But dont come out and
threaten anyone and talk inane "How dare he!?" "I own this genre!" type BS on
a list of 400+ people. Solar isnt on this list, so he has no opportunity to
address this issue directly.  So, the people who know him who are on this list
are speaking their mind on it. 

On a similar note, the 'fucking asshole' himself, Solar will be playing this
Thursday night at The Kitchen Sink @ Blakes in Berkeley. I'm not a big drum
and bass fan, but he may very well play some. So what? Come out and see him
rock multiple styles unlike 98% of the DJ's in this scene.......

People Park in Berkeley this Sunday (only a few blocks from ym house,
YAY!)  There's going to be a Moontribe Dj and some other kewl
stuff...this isn't a BSP so I won't go into details..but if you have
never been to a park part*E*, they are fun....kinda neat to see all of
your Lil' budd*E*s in the daylight!
  But anyway....afterwards..I was thinking (amazing..I actually do
sometimes!)  that we could all get together!  Dinner somewhere,
unfortunately there aren't any Denny's around that are too
close....but I am sure we could work SOMETHING out.  Here's the
kicker..Spike and Mikes Sick and Twisted Festival of Animation is
playing!!!!  THIS IS A MUST SEE!!!  A NEW EPISODE OF SOUTH PARK
THAT"LL NEVER BE RELEASED..along with the usual Spike and Mike's
tomfoolery!  These two guys are the kings of Underground
Animation..but kinda Gross and sometimes outright disgusting.  BUt
anyway...dinner and a movie after???  Sound tasty?  Only catch is that
the show is SUPPOSED to be 18+, btu I don't know if they check ID's or
not..soooOOooooOooo....I hope I get some sort of response to this long
asss piece of SPAM..adn Hope to see you all there!

I must admit that is kinda heavy.  A lot has happened with snowboards in the 
last 4 years.  I gots a 152 rossi rooster and with bindings weighs in about 7.
But you know I saw a lot of krusty boards on the mountain like some old burton's
and those kempers with the hot pink/day glo logo on the bottom that you can
see for miles.  Some people prefer them to the new fandangled models they
got out there today.  You can always demo a board (kinda expensive but worth it
if you are serious about puchasing a new board) and see if you like the new ones
are if you want to remain krusty. Even igf you decide to keep your Board at 
least check into replacing your bindings.  YOu usually can pick up a nice
set for 80-100$

Have fun and hope I see you out there,

Herb

Ohh-weeee, I totally agree with you on this one Andrew!  Dancing is so 
powerful-just by how you move with out the use of voice one can achieve his goal of 
FEEL GOOD-FEEL GREATNESS to everyone around him/her.  The music puts a smile on my 
face so B I G that I could just < < < < b   u   r   s   t > > > >! ! !  To hear the 
cheers of the crowd, to hear my inner voice scream out for more is the best feeling 
every.  

I remember at Fantasy Island a few months ago at Jack London Square Jon Bishop had 
the crowd screaming.  I could literally feel the energy /\/\/\P uL Sa Tin G/\/\/ 
from person to person.  It was like we were all in a blender and the feelings that 
one felt was what the next one felt.  People came out of the walls to get on the 
dance floor.  It was so packed, and hot-hot like *98 & hot like sweet, like never 
before had I felt so good.  Too dance and be sober all at once it was the best and 
that is how it shall stay for me.

yes you are correct...i wasnt thinking again.
I wonder how many are really interested in this?
If there were enough support then it shouldnt be too
hard to find a struggling cafe or restraunt that would
love to have 30-40 regulars hanging out once a week.

We could get them to play our cds or mixtapes for us
and maybe bring things that we are all interested in,
i could do astrology...we could  have sketch books, games,
photo alblums or videos of sfrave events etc. Perhaps
start a sfraves documentary.

So anyone interested?
Any suggestions for possible cafes to check out?
any suggestions for activities?

I often eat at smart alex's...its acouple of blocks
from the park and have nice (and cheap) food or there
is blondies pizza across the street if you are really poor.

I will probably be at the park @4pm and smart alex afterwards for 
a vegie burger and smoothie. Then off to the used cd and book stores.

Not by Olive, it's "It's a Fine Day" by Opus 3, remixed into a wonderful
melody by Orbital on "Halcyon".

It's amazing that Static can seem so different on different nights... and
last night was really great!

I got there around 10:30, it was already crowded, ordered my usual martini
(one's the limit!), and started making the social rounds of people i rarely
get to see enough of....

that's one of the things I really like at Static, that there is a whole
crew of people I can count on seeing there....

Seth/Sutekh was spinning some weird experimental stuff that, after that
martini kicked in, I decided was what you would here if you were at a
party, and an alien took over the decks.  it was cool, for a minute i felt
like i was at the star wars bar...  esp. with the mix of people that come
there... quite a trip

then one of the scottish djs came on (sorry, i lost the post that had the
names of these guys on it) .....  and it was time to dance....  very
interesting stuff, it was like funky dark house filtered through a techno
soundbox, so you had the techno flavor, but the groovier beat that i
love.... what a pleasure to really find a groove at a weekly in a bar...

then it got crowded.  really crowded.  so i stopped dancing, looked over
and saw a white gilligan's hat ... and finally met messiah wannabe (whose
real name is.... duh, i forget!).. someone i've really wanted to get to
meet face to face (though of course, conversation, as always is minimal on
a dance floor!)

then, shortly before i turned into a pumpkin, i slowly made my way through
a *very* crowded bar, said my goodbyes to those i encountered, and on home
....

if you haven't made it to static, and you're over 21 and can deal with
weeknight shenanigans, get on over there, it's fully worth the lost sleep!

and ray's martinis rock, but you have to remember, only the *first* martini
is your friend, the subsequent ones are wicked stepsisters who are out to
get you!

Ok.. so I'm sitting in class.. bored and drifting off... when I'm thinking
about different words that have snuck into my vocabulary since I started
raving.  Aside from knowing 100 different terms for different street drugs, I
find myself saying DRAMA an awful lot. (hmm.. why could this be ;) ??)  A few
other words I can think of are also now a part of my everyday conversations
that never used to be.  Does anyone else notice this??  IS is possible that
ravers have their own jargon?? Or have I just picked up a few words here and
there over the course of this year?? 

       Also.. I have decided that from now on.. when questioned on my religion
I will definitely have to reply, Technoshaminism.  THis was from thinking
about how people were talking about other things to do at raves, and something
someone wrote in my rave book about chanting.  Then, last night I was having a
conversation with someone about chanting, and it just all pieced together.  So
from now on, when i rave, I'm going to have a goal of reaching a higher level
of spirituality.  I think I do this already, but now that I'm focusing on it,
I"m sure it will be a lot greater.  What do you get out of raving?  And does
the spirituality not seem an appealing aspect to you?  

      hugs n'stuff,

Could anyone put together a quick list of some of these terms?  I've heard a
lot of 'em, but I'm curious to see if anyone else speaks a different lingo

Well, I feel like I should chime in for a minute here.  I have personally
never enjoyed a Space Children party.  I find their sound systems too loud,
their visuals tacky, and their lineups jumbled and unorganized.  I know
more than a few people who will not go to their parties, even if their
favorite dj/performer is here for one night only from overseas.  It's just
not worth it.  Saturday night was a perfect example.  A Guy Called Gerald,
one of the headliners, cancelled several weeks in advance and no effort was
made to replace him with someone else or to reduce the ticket price.  Even
with his absense, the lineups got pushed way back somehow.  Neil Landstrumm
and Tobias Schmidt gave their debut live performance in the western half of
the US, and their set was forcefully ended after just 25 minutes.  The
flier did not mention ANYWHERE that the party would be ending at 3:55am,
the performers themselves were not even aware of this, though it was known
by the promoters all along.  

Obviously, I have a lot of opinions on the subject, but I can state for a
fact that the Space Children promoters have more than once lied to their
guests from overseas about how much they would be paying them, and I
personally have been lied to and threatened by them over the phone for
trying to organize small weeknight clubs/parties with "their" artists,
thereby "stealing" some of their crowd and $$$.  

So, if you've had fun at their parties, then all the more power to you, but
there's more to it than meets the eye, or the E as it may be...

anyone is interested in getting the homegrown phat mix, send me some email and
I'll send it out when done...On CD, OF COURSE!

Well I know that Harmony is throwing a party on that night but I also
think that the Gathering is going to throw one aswell. They will both be
up on the rave calendar though.

hehehe yeah.. it tends to be painful sometimes.. but as they say, no 
pain, no gain.. i personally find satisfaction in being able to 
accomplish a move ive been working on or if i think up a new combo to 
try.... Breakdancing is just like any ohter dance except is requires, at 
times, more physical body strength and lots of practice :)
but it is worth it :)
also i just toook a capoirea class. its a great workout.....
thats it for now :)

[Etter, Darrel] 

jimg/skoop,

I missed the glad hand thing too. Please, whoever is involved, let us
know if it happens again, and any reviews are welcome.

There was a weekly that happened a few times at Bahia Cabana that had
three live electronic acts on Wednesday nights. This was about a year
ago. I think it was called Electro something, can't remember. Liquid
Acrabat (Darrin Fossilla of sfraves) played a couple of times, Freaky
Chakra played there. One guy played there almost every time who I can't
remember the name of. He had Kawai K5, an old ensoniq sampler, and a
Cooper MIDI patch bay that he would re-route MIDI channels to different
modules to create variation in tracks. I'm sure they had at least 20
acts over their short span. I liked it!

I totally love this kind of thing, and appriciated your notes on Mouse
on Mars last week; wish I saw it. You are totally on the right track.
Here are a couple of my opinions on the subject. 

Electronic music fits into many more environments that rock music ever
did. Try Ice Cream parlors, roller rinks, fashion stores (DJ at the
Deisel store), coffee shops, skyrise lobbies, bart stations, my dreams,
etc. It's very adaptable. Acts on stage might actually be less
interesting than acts in environments. Besides, it fits the DJ as a
facilitator of the community rather than performer on a pedistal" model
held in high regard by many guru ravers. Besides, it seems harder to get
people to go see live electronic acts, but they might be more likely to
go a place for some other activities that has electronic acts as a added
bonus. 

Another critical point, in my opinion, is that you should (we, all, any)
attack this from a point of view of a group of musicians/artists,
instead of the point of view of a venue that offers entertainment. The
venues are much less dedicated and more fickle than even musicians can
be. Your heart is in the right place. A bar owners heart is pickled. 

Don't you want to perform yourself? I've heard your stuff off the web.
You're ready. I've done some tracks, and once wanted to do live
performances. I've thought long and hard about how to make my tracks
adaptable, so I could alter the music in sync with the mood of the
environment and the audience. It's a very difficult thing to do. Much
more difficult that playing a guitar chord progression.

There are other electronic artists in the area. E.A.C. (Mark Camp of
sfraves) just released two vinyls with seven tracks of excellent, very
tasty alternative techno/house, and they want to play live. ProtoLab
moved from Mountain View to SF about a year ago and have played live at
a few raves. There's some electronic group living in Sunnyvale I heard
on the radio that is really good. I'll bet there are others here on
sfraves that would like to perform. There are so many techies around,
I'm sure there are many electronic music groups and individuals. Maybe
you could ask Mr Goodwrench of KFJC what artist he knows from the area.
He's a great radio DJ, and extremely informed.

Subject: [NRR] piercing/tatoo places
Sender: sfraves-owner@hyperreal.org
Precedence: bulk

  Does anybody have any specific recommendations for piercing/tatoo places
in San Francisco? I want to get a tongue pierce and a tatoo. The tongue
pierce is pretty straghtforward - I basically just need a place that I know
has a good reputation for doing things properly and hygenically - but I
really want the tatoo to be perfect. It's going to be a Decepticon logo
(from the Transformers) on my left arm, maybe 4" to half a foot, and I
really want all the lines to be clean and the angles to be sharp.
  If anybody's gotten a similar tatoo or piercing locally (I don't have a
car), and you want to recommend a place, I'd be super grateful. Gracias!

I personally have great faith and adimiration in Primal Urges for tattoos.
I have had most of my work done there and have been quite happy with the
results.

I knew they were loosing money the first minute I entered the place, and I
wasn't too sad about it either. No one was there.  There were 3 people on
the first floor and maybe 50 on the 2nd, but that is nowhere near enough
to fly all those DJs out from the UK.  Sorry to be so negative though,
I've just seen so much better recently with smalller tribes that it was a
little dissapointing.

hehehe yeah.. it tends to be painful sometimes.. but as they say, no 
pain, no gain.. i personally find satisfaction in being able to 
accomplish a move ive been working on or if i think up a new combo to 
try.... Breakdancing is just like any ohter dance except is requires, at 
times, more physical body strength and lots of practice :)
but it is worth it :)
also i just toook a capoirea class. its a great workout.....
thats it for now :)

I love watching the circles when I get tired of dancing.. I think it's really
cool, and having done a lot of martial arts in the past, I have a lot of
respect for what they can do.. And I don;t think they take up any more space
then the rest of us dancing.  I think the problem people have with them is
that there's a ghetto-type stereotype associated with the circles.  Well... I
kinda like the ghetto. :)_

on that note, I'm sure no one would have a problem with someone putting out a
bunch of condoms with the fliers.  Maybe if anyone knows how to get mass free
condoms, the could do it and just drop some round the water or something at
the parties they go to.. Might save some lives...  People on drugs aren't
remembering 4th grade sex ed... maybe if we remind them.. :)

ehmmm yeah but

i'd have a little problem doing this for one reason: it'd give kids the
idea that they can have SEX at the party.

believe me, i've been approached when i'm kickin it with a friend (hi
macadio ;)) at a party and asked "hey do either of you have a condom?"
boy was FUCKED UP!

i'd think in an ideal society, everyone would believe the condoms with a
pamphlet would be educational and all.. but guess what?
imho, it'd just encourage sexual intercourse at parties, even attached to
a pmphlet.

good idea tho. maybe not even have pamphlets that preach, but ahnd out
little business card size dealies that say "1 in 300 americans are
infected iwth HIV"
or 
"the person you're about to kiss and do possibly more with might have
HIV. can't tell by lookin at em."

yanno?

one liners often hit harder than sermons.

how excellent of you to make public these numbers. if only all large-scale

tidings sfravers,

I bring you joyful news from the messiah.  
An lo' it came to pass there there in the club liquid
did several angels play beautific music- and the
people danced and were happy.

And verily did the messiah get smacked in the head by
a cane and was offered a kiss as compensation.  And
there was much joy.

I think its aliens...but not the mean kind. They just dont know any
better. They just think its a nice pretty  souveneer for the little
gray kids at home. Like when you are out walking in the forest
and you see a pretty leaf or feather...you pick it up and take 
it home. Well you just might have walked off with a prized
family heirloom decoration that had been in the family of the 
blue jays for generations. All the birds had gathered for a little
party and had hung their feathers up and here comes mr human and takes
it away....

Well General..last time I checked, the  Hyperreal Archives contain a 
quite comprehensive list of these terms! 

As far as Technoshamanism goes...I agree! (Biased...I think not! right 
Trice? ;^) 
Dance has always been considered a form of or used as means of 
spiritual wellbeing. I question the term used to describe it, because
it is not 
necessarily the DJ that is taking through the spiritual journey of 
enlightenment, but your own soul searching for an answer to its 
questions, pains, and misguiudences. Dance can take you away from all
the 
impurities that litter the world, or lift you to a plane of
consciousness
beyond that you could ever achieve any other way. An 
earlier issue of Lotus has an excellent article on Trance and Dance, 
(I'm not sure which issue, but I think its between 6 and 8, but don't 
quote me), and anyone interested should check that out. 
PLUR, sm:)es, HugZ, and most importantly...KEEP DANCING!!! 
sNIKers ;^* 

(I am stealing a quote from Trice that works PERFECTLY here)

 Oboy! It's bash Space Children time! (rubbing hands gleefully)

My only complaint with Space Children is that at Burning Man '97, myself 
and Rob Rayle put together (along with support from kind friends) the 
best dance spot on the playa (excepting of course the main stage which 
had a Trance party the night of the burn), and at some time while we were 
there, a Space Children promoter left a stack of flyers on our table.

 I have several problems with this; one- we were not asked if someone 
could dump their trash on our table (which we had to throw out for them), 
two- Burning Man is an arts festival where one is supposed to be able to 
avoid things like crass advertisment. If we wanted that we would have 
Budweised underwriting the event so the organisers wouldn't be going 
broke trying to throw this art party. Third- we didn't set up our sound 
and lights to attract customers for Space Children. Their prescence was 
highly unwanted and I will never attend one of their events. I would like 
to urge others to boycott their parties also until they learn the meaning 
of the word "respect".

hugz,

Where were you at Burning Man?  Were you the Uhaul near the mud pits?
Also I believe that Trance thing on the night of the burn was none other
that Goa Gil spinning all night long till 8am, he was great.  

Bashing Space Children again, you don't leave trash anywhere at BM.  What
you bring in you haul out, it's only common respect to everyone else.
Those who don't know about BM just don't know how rude that is.  Space
Children need a clue!  I hope they are reading this...I don't doubt.

Actually, age does matter because of sooooo many venues being 21+.  But
other than that, age does not matter.  For me, it's a lot more about
maturity.  I'm 18 (19 in January).  I have many friends that are far
younger, but very mature for their age.  Then there are 24 year-olds I know
that I really don't care to hang around with because of their maturity
level.  You notice this much more in college than in High School.  In High
School, you know what grade everyone is in, so you have a pretty good idea
of their age.  In college, you don't really know unless you ask.  One of my
friends was insulted by the fact that I thought he was a freshman (and
guessed he was 18 or 19) when I met him, and he's really a junior and 20.
I know another guy that's 24 that I thought was 19 or 20.  So you see, it's
all about maturity level.  And as far as youndg people on this list go,
they seem to be pretty mature for their age.  I would have never guessed
that 'trice was that young.

Ok well then guess what.....I think that the only solution is that if there is
a water booth or anything that resembles a booth there could be a bowl of
condoms or something....honestly I think if people are going to be having sex
in public it shouldnt be at a rave. I dont want to see it....in my opinion it
is making sex seem cheap and gross (lying on a dirty floor ewww) sex is
supposed to beautiful.....wow, ok, anyways but if people are going to be
"grossly having sex in an unsanitary spot, then I think condoms should be
available...blah blah and so forth!!!!  <3 *MushyB!

I use ginseng a lot at raves.  you can get it at most oriental,
especially korean stores.  or look me up at a rave, i usually carry a
few packets in my pockets or car, and i'll give you some.  it's like
caffeine, but without the jitters.  especially great for those of us
allergic to coffee....

Okay...as far as the tongue piercing goes...if there is any chance that you
will be in San Diego soon, your best bet is to do it there.  It is FAR
cheaper and just as clean and professional as the Gauntlet!  You would want
to go to Hip Hair in Pacific Beach...it's on Garnet!  Otherwise, I agree
that Gauntlet would probably be the best!

I use ginseng a lot at raves.  you can get it at most oriental,
especially korean stores.  or look me up at a rave, i usually carry a
few packets in my pockets or car, and i'll give you some.  it's like
caffeine, but without the jitters.  especially great for those of us
allergic to coffee....

Hey Gang,

Got some questions for everyone. If you have the time, please take a little
bit and answer them. (Those that give me really good answers - I'll kick down
my hometown mix groove to you. ;) )

Thanks! 

O.k., here goes:

1) What would be your ultimate mix tape/CD? (like a general description..)

2) What genre? 

3) Would you love something that rocked several different styles or one
consistent throughout the whole tape?

4) Should the mix try to replicate the sound of a club/party or be made to
"bedroom listening" standards/energy level? (Maybe a better way of putting
this: Should mix tapes be more introspective/intricate or more obvious (as
live mixing usually is)?).

4) WHat are the specific tracks that would be on it (artist, title)? Why?

5) What are your all time classics that should be included in your ultimate mix?

6) Do you think that DJ mixes should be from vinyl or CD? Is one more real
than the other?

7) Do you prefer tapes for your collection or are CDs better?

8) What's more important to you: The music or who's spinning it? (If it's who,
then who are they?)

9) What would be a fair price for this mix if you had to buy it?

10) And finally: What do you think of DJs that make mixes on tape or CD that
don't get clearance/approval from labels or artists to use their music on
these tapes/CDs that are sold? 

Thanks for your input on this,

rob.

 Did someone already mention Guaran?   Gives me energy but no jitters!
You can find it in powder form and health food stores.  I found pills
at Trader Joes last week. A lot of Latin stores carry a Guarana drink,
NOT the Josta stuff pepsi is pushing.

It's supposed to be an Aphrodisiac  too, but I wouldn't know anything
about that :)!

I kinda agree with Lara, but you know... That's the same argument conservatives used in the 80's to keep condoms out of high school health offices.

Subject: Re: [NRR] piercing/tatoo places
Sender: sfraves-owner@hyperreal.org
Precedence: bulk

I replied privately to the person asking for suggestions... but since there
are other responses to the list, I want to add my input..

It is VERY important to go to experienced and responsible piercers... I
have heard tales that you would not believe about some of the places on
Haight and Telegraph that are not really professional... some don't have
trained piercers working, some don't even check id's (a responsible piercer
requires id that you are 18, or have your parents with you).... some don't
even have an autoclave to sterilize their equipment... some sell cheap
jewelry that will break or interact with your body in a bad way....

my rule of thumb is that, if they do anything OTHER than piercing there,
then you're better off finding a place where piercing is what they
specialize in...

so....  here are the shops I recommend that you can count on...

these are places I have gone to, and have taken my daughter to....

1.  Gottsi in Berkeley on Telegraph out near 65th street.... Alan makes
most of his jewelry inhouse, and has experience with quality piercing, with
a tribal and ethnic focus...  for stretched pierces (like my ears, etc.),
you must go to someone who understands that aspect of piercing....  (tell
him Leslie sent you)

2.  Nomad in SF (moved to share space with Primal Urge tattoo, I
believe)... again, a tribal focus, and Kristian has been doing piercing for
many years... (again, tell them Leslie sent you)

3.  Body Manipulations on 16th near Guerrero... not as tribal in their
focus, but excellent quality....  (you can tell them I sent you, but
they'll have no idea who i am! ;^)

some people like the Gauntlet, I find it too crowded and big and
commercial, and their focus is not the tribal-style piercing...

Remember, piercing is NOT permanent like tattooing, but you must take care
of your pierces properly, and if you have any problems or think anything's
wrong, go have the piercer help you figure out how to fix it...  they are
happy to help you keep your piercings healthy.

and NEVEr put plastic or Fimo or cheap safety pins or silver in your
piercings, please... only put inert things in your body... i.e., surgical
steel, surgical implant-grade plastics, glass, buffalo horn, amber, stone,
bone, etc...  if in doubt, any of these shops will be happy to tell you if
a material should be stable...

As far as tattooing (I've said this before on here).... it's SOOO important
to choose your design carefully so it REALLY means something to you
FOREVER... and NEVEr put cost in your criteria for choosing a piece or an
artist... if you can't afford what you really want, start saving for it
now....  you'll never regret waiting and doing it right..

now, back to work!

love, leslie

Beauty is making love on a stack of throbbing loudspeakers. As your 
thought's stray from the...errr..."matters at hand", you realize that 
right below you is 200 to 10,000 people partying-carrying on. The 
combined throb of the speakers and crowd vibe spurs you on to new 
heights.

HEALTH NOTE!!!  speaking of dirty floors! If you hands are not clean 
they should not come near your womens warmmoisteez. There are nasty 
supergerms crawling around public places(esp. sweaty public places).

I realize this is a bit of a long shot, but here goes:

In a recent edition of XLR8R there was an ad for a various artists
compilation which included tracks by PFM and Seba & Lotek (of
Logical Progression fame), among others.  However, my moron roommate
threw out a pile of my stuff, that issue of XLR8R included, and
now I can't remember what the disc was called.  Any jungleists
out there know what this is?  It was in the XLR8R that had the sort
of half skeleton/half face on the cover.

Little help?

Steve.

Thanks for that! Can you say "get a room!" None of
asked to watch you do anything sexually and its
damn disrespectful to be "tappin ass" around folks
that don't want to see it. At least not at a rave K'.

Thanks again, for that one. I can see cuddling and
such, but if you want to get your fu*k on don't do it
at a rave, spare us all your private lives. Thanks
for the sex-ed teach. Do you honestly think women
don't know this?

BU-BYE

Hello!

Question:

If the party was underground (illicit, whatever..) and those that wanted to
express themselves in that manner ("doin' tha do"), it does seem appropriate
that to hand out the protection would seem to be a good idea (if indeed
handing them out promoted the idea that you could have sex at the party...) I
agree w/ Chris.

Lord knows I wouldn't put my nekkid butt anywhere near some stank nasty
warehouse floor... (grease stains on the booty!)

But anyway, is there something truly wrong with having SEX at a party? Seems
like it is one of those real basic human expression type things that should
have a place somewhere. (I don't think I could get au natural, but for those
that want to...well, I say, drop those skivies... ;)  ).
I think there is a club overseas (U.K. or something) that I was reading about
that has this sort of thing. Manumission I think its called....

Yeah, in a perfect world, but... Most people I party with wouldn't want to see it, they would find it intrusive. (Had this conversation before.)  Also, people on E, especially newbies, are so vulnerable.  Adding sex to that equation doesn't seem like a good idea.  Boy, don't I sound like a grumpy old man?

Someone else made a similar remark about lying on a dirty floor...  I thought ravers were good f*&kers?  Who says you have to lie down!  Yer booty doesn't have to touch the ground... Come on now, standing is fun too!

>p.s. sorry if I'm beating a dead horse...

That's OK, its so much better than beating a live one, you don't have to chase it!

Have you ever had one of those days where things go right, although 
nothing happened.  Well so far at ten am today that is my day.  I come 
home-locked out of the house.  Okay so I take the screen off the 
window push the panes apart and crawl,(rathere jump up through) through 
the window, then go to the front door to pick up my stuff only to find 
that it was left unlocked!

Patrice can feel for me she knows what its like to crawl through my 
window.

Juan Atkins vs. Kari Lekebush

Music should always be flirting with the notion of being hard to define.
Mix it up, but tastefully.

Both.  Think about it, you want to be throttled by long clean sinous
mixes, you also want to hear some harder cuts when the mix calls for it.
I trust a good artist to use both tastefully in a mixtape.

I purchase mixtapes because I trust the DJ to put what they need to say on
there.

None.  Anthems/Classics have no place on a mixtape in my opinion, unless
it happens to be something that was played during a live set.

Depends on what the DJ spins...

There should not be mix CD's, they come a little too close to being able
to be pushed as a for demostration purposes only product, and ultimately
will cost the scene both tape and CDs.

The entire thing, both, ....

12.99 TOPS or so... no more than a usual tape.

Cool if it's a cheap tape in small runs for purposes of promoting a DJs
mixing skills as a promotional tool.

Let's put it this way... there's a CD that came out from some friends of
mine, which I think is fuckin low.  It's got very few mixes, playing
almost entire tracks out.  I don't really consider that a mix, it's a
beatmatchd complilation.  A compilation should be licensed from the labels
and artists.

CD = "perfect media"  I think 'artist approved' mixes are cool, but I
don't think bootleg mixes should be put on CD its just plain fucked up.

Tape = in small runs, it's a boutique business, any DJ should be able to
make a tape and hand it out or sell it... prefereably for cheaper than the
15 bucks stopres are asking.  I've been trying to put a tape in stores,
and only one store will let me mark my price down below everyone elses...
and that's money out of "my share" of the tape so to speak.

It's a weird issue...

Gee.. I am glad I didn't like show any charactoristics of a two faced
asshole. Just being myself. This was some kind of trick. I "replied" to an
anonmous e-mail. And here it comes hitting me back in the face.

=]:...
I am a stud huh?
The anonomous e-mail came from someone acting pretty permisquous. Me and a
few friends at work here are entertaining our selves using MY account! It
bypasses mostly all of Mr admins anal security monitors... Carry on people.
I need a bag of ice now, my face is burning up.

If you have the opportunity to make love in close proximity to a party you will never 
forget it. I myself dont like people watching me, but the thrill of possibly being 
caught excites me. Behind a curtain inside a broom closet, next to the sound guy 
sleeping on the amp racks. I have to say under the stage is THE SPOT. You can fall 
asleep there in the spoons position(my second favorite positon).

Layne I love your posts but I dont believe you can say "Wash Your Hands" enough. Sorta 
like establishing a limit on how many times you can say "wear a condom".

p.s.	It is interesting to see what people think about this... mixtapes
come very close to using other people's music for the monetary gain of the
DJ's... so, eh, where to draw the line?

I was busy composing my 'canned' response, when I read Leslie's post.
Listen to Leslie.

I get a lot of questions at parties, as the piercings and tats I have
are noticeable - if you go to trance parties, chances are you've seen my
pretty titties >;-) and arms...

I got the hood done at Gauntlet by some guy named Striker - not the Jeff
we all know and love...  I don't know if he's there anymore, but my
friend who did my breasts and now lives in Portland, Keith, always
recommended Body Manipulations.

I was at Bod Man the other day, and they're doing scarring and brandings
as well, so if you're new, these seem to be people who really know their
stuff.

As for tats - once you have a design, the best thing to do, I think, is
to ask peple who have work you like.  Because tattoos are permanent, we
have a tendency to remember very well each one, and will recommend
people with full conviction, once we find someone we like.  Bee is
fantastic, but he's splitting time between SF, LA and Europe, so he's
hard to find.  I have a number for him, though, if you want it.

Peace,

K

And if you could, add that it's from a Peter Garbiel song (Rythym of the
Heat - from Security), inspired by the field work of a Carl Gustav Jung. 
It's in reference to some tribal rite he observed, which he noted had
significant effects - even on those who were not "conditioned" to react to
the ritual... that it tied to something deeper within the human psyche,
which ironically ties back to raving and where I see it fit in modern
culture using a concept from an actual quote from the psychologist... 

"No psychic value can disappear without being replaced by another of
equivalent intensity." C.G. Jung

It means we had to figure something to replace dancing around a fire in
loincloths... see you this weekend, kids.

     At this site you can find some basic things everyone should know 
     BEFORE piercing their tongues

I replied privately to the person asking for suggestions... but since there
are other responses to the list, I want to add my input..

It is VERY important to go to experienced and responsible piercers... I
have heard tales that you would not believe about some of the places on
Haight and Telegraph that are not really professional... some don't have
trained piercers working, some don't even check id's (a responsible piercer
requires id that you are 18, or have your parents with you).... some don't
even have an autoclave to sterilize their equipment... some sell cheap
jewelry that will break or interact with your body in a bad way....

my rule of thumb is that, if they do anything OTHER than piercing there,
then you're better off finding a place where piercing is what they
specialize in...

so....  here are the shops I recommend that you can count on...

these are places I have gone to, and have taken my daughter to....

1.  Gottsi in Berkeley on Telegraph out near 65th street.... Alan makes
most of his jewelry inhouse, and has experience with quality piercing, with
a tribal and ethnic focus...  for stretched pierces (like my ears, etc.),
you must go to someone who understands that aspect of piercing....  (tell
him Leslie sent you)

2.  Nomad in SF (moved to share space with Primal Urge tattoo, I
believe)... again, a tribal focus, and Kristian has been doing piercing for
many years... (again, tell them Leslie sent you)

3.  Body Manipulations on 16th near Guerrero... not as tribal in their
focus, but excellent quality....  (you can tell them I sent you, but
they'll have no idea who i am! ;^)

some people like the Gauntlet, I find it too crowded and big and
commercial, and their focus is not the tribal-style piercing...

Remember, piercing is NOT permanent like tattooing, but you must take care
of your pierces properly, and if you have any problems or think anything's
wrong, go have the piercer help you figure out how to fix it...  they are
happy to help you keep your piercings healthy.

and NEVEr put plastic or Fimo or cheap safety pins or silver in your
piercings, please... only put inert things in your body... i.e., surgical
steel, surgical implant-grade plastics, glass, buffalo horn, amber, stone,
bone, etc...  if in doubt, any of these shops will be happy to tell you if
a material should be stable...

As far as tattooing (I've said this before on here).... it's SOOO important
to choose your design carefully so it REALLY means something to you
FOREVER... and NEVEr put cost in your criteria for choosing a piece or an
artist... if you can't afford what you really want, start saving for it
now....  you'll never regret waiting and doing it right..

now, back to work!

love, leslie

I would think that if you wanted to have sex with someone you met at a 
party, you'd find a spot where you wouldn't really be disturbing anyone 
to do it...  I think that there is probably a lot of sex going on that no 
one really knows about because folks are discreet :/

And if you're goign to have sex (at a rave or not) use latex condoms!  
Hey, I should put condoms in with my next mixtape... maybe I could get 
Lifestyles to partially fun the venture... hmmm...

Discression is the key in many things, I think thats 
the case with sex at parties as well. Just be ninja
when your looking for that "ass for the tappins'"
Thats the point I was trying to make, I think - shit
is it Friday yet???

I checked out this website and agree with much of what is said... however,
this dentist groups tongue piercing with lip piercing and cheek piercing...
and these are entirely different types of tissues and processes...

tongue piercing is not that painful compared to other piercings... and yes,
the healing can be a bitch, because this is a body part you use all the
time, and when it's swollen, you can't eat or talk very well... i hated my
healing process and almost gave up because it took 14 days before i could
"size down" to a shorter and more comfortable barbell (if your jewelry
isn't comfortable, it doesn't fit, so go have a piercer take a look at
it... a too-tight piece of jewelry will do damage to your tongue, or lip or
other soft tissues in your mouth, and a too-loose one will get in your
way)...

and it is very important to rinse with sea salt water consistently during
the entire healing process or whenever it feels tender (as in any pierce,
sea salt water will help pull toxins out and promote faster healing)...
diluted listerine is a good germ-killer too...

one reason it is important to go to an experienced piercer is that the
placement of a tongue pierce is very VERY important... too far forward or
badly angled, and you will bite on it, and it WILL damage your teeth... i
have friends who have cracked their teeth, and that's definitely not worth
it... if you have a pierce that you easily bite on, consider taking it
out....  and possibly having it repierced...

the other thing i don't agree with is the recommendation to remove your
jewelry to clean it.... my experience is that every time you screw off the
ball on a barbell, you are wearing the threads... and are more likely to
end up with a loose ball...  which will fall off and create problems..

my preference is to have my barbell long enough to be able to push it in
each direction so that I can brush it with a toothbrush...  i have never
removed it in over 2 years, and don't see any reason to unless something
happens to the jewelry...

also, please don't be tempted to get clear plastic balls for your pierce to
make it less conspicuous at work or whatever... it is not good to have
plastic in your mouth, because it will break down from your digestive
acids...  Alan at Gottsi has some red high-quality plastic pieces if it's
that important to you... but again, that means changing the balls, and when
you do that a lot, you wear out the threads....

and one more thing .... (nag, nag, nag, after all, I'm a mom!).... you
e-head kids who get all tweaky and play with your tongue pierce constantly
are doing harm to it... you are risking stretching your pierce, as well as
nicking of chipping your teeth... you can unlearn that nervous habit....  i
swear...  (oh yeah, now that makes it rave-related, right?)

I am inviting you to come have dinner at my home tomorrow nite. It 
probably won't be the Big Partay I had planned last week, but food 
poisoning is not easily recovered from. Please RSVP me at this addy to 
let me know if you'd like to come. I don't know what kind of musical 
entertainment I can wrangle up, but I do have a cd player & it is kinda 
short notice to get a dj (that is unless anyone would like to volunteer. 
It'll be like a buffet type of thing sine we are all, for the most part, 
physical strangers and I don't want anyone to feel uncomfortable sitting 
at a large table. I will prepare a few things, but if each person can 
bring a dish that serves 6-8 people, I think we'll all be fat & happy! I 
think 6 pm will be a good time to begin, but feel free to come by a bit 
earlier if you'd like so we can get to know each other. I don't bite...
hard.

Hello everyone,

there is a correction here...

Harmony will be happening on the 27th of Dec. (look for BSP coming soon) We
didn't want to go on the same night as the Gathering so we moved it. We
hope to see lots of you at Harmony... It is a sort of reunion for some of
us. We have not thrown a Harmony in a long time. It's going to be amazing!
We also want to see all of you at the Gathering (the week before), so be
there or be square ; ) 

Peace and love,

Greg = )

     Hello all,
     
     1st off, tomorrow's friday... Yippie!
     
     (Sorry for a reHASH subject)
     
     2nd, a pal of mind is in need of a clean urine test within a couple 
     weeks, and he smoked some pot. Well, I've heard of golden seal, and 
     done numerous web searches on the subject, and there is no definite 
     way to clear your system apparently. Has anyone personally used 
     something, that worked 100%. Any advice would be fantastic!
     
     ;) - To our local authorities, my friend has since then quit! He 
     watched a afterschool DARE special, where little bobby OD'd on 2nd 
     hand pot smoke, and ate too much and then went on a diet. Thanks Uncle 
     Sam!

Yep... and they lie about telling you "Yeah, we need someone to do the web
page. We'll be sending you the graphics shortly."... then I get a call
from an aquaintence who says, "Hey, I'm almost done with the Space
Children site.... they said you were interested in *helping... do you want
to help maintain the HTML??".... Shhhhhhaaaaaa......   Man, I reached out
my hand to those guys and they were cool for a bit.. even envited me to
their place to kick it....   but the whole web page thing gave me a true
understanding of what they're about....   I didn't have to offer my FREE
services to them... I told them, "I just wanna help you guys out and be
part of the family"... Ha!..... 

I'm going to KEEP IT REAL......... and go to parties thrown by people who
KEEP IT REAL.

Okay everyone, even though I already posted that I DO NOT think that having
sex at partiesis okay, I guess I would have to agree that it IS going to
happen whether I/we like it or not.  So, I guess maybe condoms SHOULD be
available.  Also, I know a lot of people have sex right AFTER parties
before going to sleep, so it would be great to have condoms at the door for
these people, too.

You know, it's kind of like how the government has programs to provide
IV-drug users with clean needles.  The users are going to use the drugs
whether the government likes it or not.  So, the government might as well
do SOMETHING (even though they do VERY LITTLE) to stop the spread of HIV.

Thoughts?

In a message dated 97-12-04 03:50:15 EST, you write:

<< We could get them to play our cds or mixtapes for us

OH!! I am definitely interested!!  (Well.. yah..> I mean I started the post
and everything)  OK... let's see.. the only thing is (and this is something
that someone pointed out to me)  We never really buy coffee.  But aside from
that I think we should have another coffee shop to go to.  Perhaps whoever
wanted to start that club in the South Bay would be interested in starting a
DJ Coffee house instead??  There's all these possibilities... we just have to
make them work.

Since March, I have been developing the worlds most perfect way to honor the scene
and give others a better understanding of why we love it.  It's finally here:
CHOREOGRAPHER'S GALLERY    December 4 (8PM) & 5 (7&9PM)
This show is a collection of dances.  Mine, titled "Earthlings", is a tribute to
all of the experiences and people that have come my way thanks to raving.  Tickets
are ONLY $5!!  You can call 408-554-4015 to order or get directions.  Or you can
get tickets before the show.  However, it is general seating so come early.  The
theater is on the Santa Clara University campus.  
This is a professional show with lights, sound and all the other effects we know
and love.  I genuinely think the whole show is great and any of you would have a
fantastic time.  Make a night of it and be sure to say "hi" after the show.  Thanks
for reading this far!!

in many places, like seattle, the AIDS-prevention groups give out free
condoms in all the clubs ... in bowls by the door, in bowls in the
bathroom.... with cool little match-book-like covers... i actually have a
little collection just because they're so clever and interesting, and also
have good info on them....

you all know that i don't think people should have sex in *public* at
parties... though even some of my, um, best friends, have been known to
sneak away occasionally.... which is why I *always* carry condoms with
me.... because one never knows when one will need one, do one?

better to have it and not need it than to need it and not have it, that's
what i say..

(though a few years ago on a similar thread, moonpup said he thought it was
bad luck to be prepared... but *I* think it's bad luck to need it and not
have it... and decide to do without....)

so, put 'em in your backpacks and pipebags and whatever, kiddies.... and
share 'em with your friends, because that's all good...

i just don't wanna have to watch you use it in the chill space at a party, ok?

love, leslie

(p.s.  in a pinch, ask me, too, ok?)

To cool down from being so irritated by ungrateful party corporations
(whether they are or not I'm not siding)... I would highly recommend a
bout of
 "On" by Aphex Twin

ah yes...
now if only it would rain...

Yep... and they lie about telling you "Yeah, we need someone to do the web
page. We'll be sending you the graphics shortly."... then I get a call
from an aquaintence who says, "Hey, I'm almost done with the Space
Children site.... they said you were interested in *helping... do you want
to help maintain the HTML??".... Shhhhhhaaaaaa......   Man, I reached out
my hand to those guys and they were cool for a bit.. even envited me to
their place to kick it....   but the whole web page thing gave me a true
understanding of what they're about....   I didn't have to offer my FREE
services to them... I told them, "I just wanna help you guys out and be
part of the family"... Ha!..... 

I'm going to KEEP IT REAL......... and go to parties thrown by people who
KEEP IT REAL.

This is a great quote from one of my buddies here in SoCal, a talented DJ 
named JBondy:

"In general, sex at a rave is not condoned.  Sex in the rave's parking 
lot however... that is a different story."

You might want to try Herbal Flush... I know they sold that stuff at
headshops couple years back. You mix the stuff with a jug of water and down
it before you take your piss test.  Supposed to work with a "double money
back guarantee". I bought it back then. I don't really smoke bud anymore
(unless someone passes the joint around)... usually do the candyflip thing.
Hope this stuff is useful

Hey, I was at static too. Didn't manage to meet any of the huge sfraves posse there, though. I was the one on the podium like thing at the side with long blonde hair and a goatee, dancing like a complete loon. That crazy darkside track with the dark voice talking about a couple of girls going to new york, just for the night, and ending up going clubbing, then the voice goes "Slipped her some ecstasy, and I FUCKED HER ALL NIGHT" and hits the break - that was just so completely insane. N.B. It wasn't indicative of the rest of the set, which was just good old jackin tekkno madshit mixed in with a bit of oldskool electro for measure.
And I thought SF would just be deep house and cheesy trance - how wrong was I (Or was this week just a lucky techo week?)
I shall be frequenting static often after that performance - have to meet up next time.

  I'm not going near San Diego anytime soon, but thanx. Seems like
Gauntlet, Nomad, and Body Manipulations are the places to check out for the
pierce in San Francisco.

An alternative that you might want to consider for the piercing is the Fakir
Musapher body intensive workshop. Each month they hold a workshop and need
"models" to be pierced. The piercing is free you pay only for the Jewlrey(5-15
dollars). Plus you get the opportunity to meet Fakir, who's name you may or may
not recognize from the Modern Primitives book that spurned this modern interest
in ritual activities like piercing ant tattooing. The contact number is (650)
324-0543. Just call and let them know you would be interested in being a model.

As far as tattooing goes stay away from Erno's on Fillmore and Haight. I never
had a bad experience with them but have had several friends that were less than
satisfied.
My tattoo artist of choice lives in Seattle.

I appaud Vlad for posting the monetary outcome of Spirit last Thanksgiving
Weekend!

I was almost there...well, almost.

However, I spank spank your little raver booties whoever is taking their props!

Bad raver! Bad! Bad!

Props, Banners, insignificant little day-glo items..whatever, were likely
provided at the expense of hours of hard work, dedication, and pocket money
for all of us to share.

Please don't take them...a small little day-glo trinket to you might mean
hours of hard work and love to another...

Shit!!....we'll spare you some canvas and some paint if you need it that bad...

It's all about respect fellas...RESPECT!

much love and energy,

Terry

Hee...   that was a record by Oliver Chessler from NYC, who used to do
hardcore for Industrial Strength records.  Believe it or not, that track
was from a brand new record, though it has elements of old school techno
and industrial.  Every track has some kind of monologue, ranging from silly
to downright perverted (like the one Neil Landstrumm played).  His tracks
certainly work on the dancefloor, that's for sure...

Well, Static varies quite a bit from week to week, our resident djs play
everything from the kind of "jackin tekkno" you heard on tuesday to dark
techstep drum and bass to abstract funk and electro.  We try to keep people
on their toes...

This tuesday was certainly a treat having Neil Landstrumm and Dave Tarrida
in from Scotland.  It's not often we get to hear talent from overseas at
our $2 club, but they were much more interested in spreading their love of
music than in money (a rare occurence).  If you were at Static and liked
the music, hunt down some records on Scandinavia, Sativae, Drought, or
Mosquito (all closely related to these artists).

Thanks again everyone for coming out!

Hello all you ravers!

As some of you may know The San Francisco Harmony Family will be coming
together once again this year. We are putting together one more party for
the year of '97. It has been a rather surprising year for many of us...
"Harmonics Clothing" (our store) has opened up in Santa Rosa Ca, we threw a
"massive" (by our standards... the Harmony Spring Massive), and some of us
moved away. All of these things together contributed to the lack of Harmony
parties this year. We only had 2 events this year. Hmmm... kinda wierd, but
anyways...

The S.F. Harmony Family has gone through a lot of changes in this last
year, but we are still here, and still ready to party our asses off!!! For
over four years we have partied together, and we are inviting all of you to
join us once again to have a slammin Harmony Party!!!

It gives us great pleasure to present the following...

****BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE****

Saturday night, December the 27th, 1997

Bringing us together with the slammin beats...

        *BRIAN & BRAD*                                    *LI*   -   *TRENT*
            (L.A.'s Moontribe 2X4)                 *GREG SANDLER*
						(old school Harmony techno freaks)
               **URN**
                      (The Santa Rosa Family)

Taking us for a ride...

              *J-BIRD*                                     *MAIZ*     -
*ANDY W*
                  (Pacific Sound Sys)                       (Down tempo/
ambient)

                          *RE-ACH*   -   *SCIENCE*
                                (drum n' bass maddness)

                                                  (408)486-9591

We have a huge variety of music for this party, so it is going to be a full
night of bomb ass tunes! Since this is a "Beautiful People" party, we
encourage you to dress up in costume for this party to share and spread
your beautiful positive vibes! There will be be free water and fruit
availible as well as cheap bottled water. *Look for the first ever
Harmonics Clothing booth... We will have tapes of some of the djs playing
as well as select shirts and accessories.*

The location is only 15 min away from S.F. and is a beautiful two room
facility. There will only be 400-500 presale tickets availible for this
party. Call the voice mail to get info on wher to get the tickets. The
price is $20. The reason for this high price on admission is due to the
permits. We have made sure that this party is fully permited and ready to
go off! (that just means we have to pay more $ to get in) But we are
cleared to go all the way until 6am.

Ok, so here's the scoop from us to you on this party... We are trying our
hardest to make this the most collective conscious positive atmosphere ever
at a Harmony party. We want the vibe to be so intense and so amazing, that
we can all wallk away from this party feeling and knowing that we are all a
part of a beautiful, positive, underground family. This takes all of our
energy combined, so let's make this an unforgettable night for all of us!!!
Bring your positive vibes and spread your love!!!

Hope to see ya there!!! Call (408) 486-9591

Peace, love and harmony to all,

Harmony = )

It varies from 3-7% as opposed to approx. 1% in most coffee.

hey, who was trying to sell off their theatrical curtains?  is (are)
it (they) still for sale?  i'm afraid i lost the post.  i mean, at
first i figured "curtains?  what the hell do i need curtains for? 
TRASH!"  but then i got to thinkin' - a big theatrical curtain is just
the thing i need for the all-ages strip club i'm putting in next to
the meditation chamber in my church.  just kidding.

but really, i'm interested in the curtains if they are still for sale.

Oops, my ISP seems to have changed their version of Lynx, which I use
to generate the calendar.  Thus the footnoted links, and maybe other
formatting changes.  Anyway, Deep and One World look pretty good for
Friday, then there's a buncha stuff on Saturday - check them all out;
then finally there's a freebie on Sunday in Berkeley.

ok i'm gonna go out on a limb here.  but heck, i spend so much time on
this here limb i probably oughta go ahead and build myself a
treehouse...

so, what i want to know is, what's so bad about watching people having
sex?  i kinda like it.  i mean, don't get me wrong, i don't sneak
around peeping in peoples windows or anything.  nor am i a lifetime
member of the royal dyonesian swingers club or anything like that. 
and certainly everybody is entitled to their own tastes, preferences
and opinions.  but as for myself, i don't really see why people would
get all worked up about a little hanky panky goin down in some
secluded corner of the chill room.  as far as i'm concerned it just
adds to the vibe.  hell, to be completely honest, if were to look up
and see some fine raver couple buck naked goin' at it on top of the
speaker stack, i'd probably just think "damn, this is one helluva
party..."

Does anyone know of any raves near Yale?  I have to go to my preceptorships
to watch open heart surgery!! Yippee. ...Not  Just kidding it's actually
quite awesome.  Well I am going to be out there for a bit then I will be
going to Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia.  Then I fly out to Florida
Keys somewhere for a week and I want to party a bit.... Any suggestions???
If there are any parties within a driving distance I will take a limo, if
you know of anything near flying distance not to exceed 4 hours I would be
up to that also!!!  Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Even though I wouldn't choose to, I can understand the desire to have
sex with someone you meet at a party right then and there. But because
most raves are all ages, I would have to say that I wouldn't condone it
at a party that I was throwing/crewing. Now ofcource there I go again
with another Age/Rave issue.

I think it was Tony at the last Gathering that played the track that
went: "Man these girls are Jail Bait! Man these girls are Jail Bait! Man
these girls are Jail Bait!" over 'n over. I thought it was cute.

i think ravers definitely have their own language, or jargon at least.
 my impression is that ravespeak, around here anyway, is a mixture of
west coast hip hop slang and present day valley girl/boy (ie. "hella"
as opposed to "gag me with a spoon"), much like beatnik jive was
californian hipsters' take on black jazzspeak.

here's an idea: i think us sfravers should come up with our own
jargon.  i mean, the first people on the block to use that new hip
slang word always get cool points right?  but if you try to make up
your own words, people just think you're dumb.  until, that is, they
start hearing everyone else using them, and realize you're just way
more ahead of the curve than they are.  so if we all agree to start
using the same words at the same time, maybe other ravers will pick
them up.  and we'll all be guaranteed to be the first one's droppin 'em.

here's one suggestion:

blowin' speakers - extreme drug experience ("try the tabs that guy
painted silver is selling.  shits blowin my speakers.")


-messiah w


ps did i just make that up, or did i overhear it, and then
subconciously dredge it up from my foggy memory and claim to have
thought of it myself?

To re-emphasize a point however, by offering condoms at the door, not only
are you giving them a chance to save their lives, but hopefully it will
also send a message to the most vunerable people there, E virgins.  It
might help them remember to be responsible, at a time when they are
thinking about everything but responsibility.

I completely agree.  I clearly remember the positive impression I got when
I saw a bowl of condoms at a table at a medium size massive I went to (san
jose, armory)..  It's responsible, helps encourage others to think and/or
be responsible, and for party-throwing groups - it's cheap.

I don't think a situation where one or more of the parties involved are
potentially capable of momentarily poor judgement having sex in public
adds to the vibe whatsoever, and to be honest, I've seen so many people 
already feel bad about kissing someone they later thought was a
deceitful troll, etc... I don't think we should do anything to help
that progression along.

Well, I split on Thursday...met up with my Dad, little sisters [22,10], and
my  ex-step-mother for morning bagel, multiple-espressos and a valium.  I
had been a crab-ass most of the morning, but my step-mom's valium  put me
in check.  The plane left at 12:05..and we were off.  

My sister [22] and I were the last two on the plane[96,97], we sat all the
way in the back next to the attendant's little cubicle.  Our attendant,
Tim, was a crackup... hitting on a blonde midway in his section during the
saftey brief by clicking the seatbelt together with a wink and a smile...

After making my sister a One Eyed Mary instead of a Gin Mary, and spilling
said Gin Mary on my pants [after my littlest sister had spilled mocha on
them], he set us up with multiples throughout the hour and 45 min ride...
needless to say, we were bombed by the time we arrived.

Our friend, Danielle Montrose [5'1" and a bundle of raver energy], met us
at the airport, and we began our trek back to the place she was
house-sitting... the home of two strippers who were away in Las Vegas to
make money for rent.  One had an georgeous female pitbull named Raven...
she was a sweet-but-pushy little bitch.

My sister is from Reno [attending UNR], as well as two other house guests,
Becky, and Shawn... who were both from Reno, and were both Dj's.  Shawn was
a promoter as well...  Friday we all went out vintage clothes shopping, all
finding *something* to spend money on.  Our tour guide, Vanessa [Danielle
had only been there 3 months], was a promoter, and [with some other close
friends] had just opened up Club FX... So, she put us on the list, and we
had a phat fun filled night dancing there. Caught Little T [haven't I read
a couple mails about her?].. The E was KILLER! Phat section downstairs, as
well as upstairs... coat check... they haven't even started setting that
place up either... soooo much  potential.

Saturday, we woke up late... that eve, we went out to Vinylized, danced
there most of the night.. there was a fight downstairs that kept me up with
the housey stuff upstairs... breaker circles suck in close quarters, I need
some *room*, but there was this one girl who was goin' OFF! The vibe was a
bit off for most of the eve there, I imagine it had something to do with
the fight... on our way out to Area 51 pretty early in the morning, there
was som PHAT jungle in the downstairs... we had to stop and shake it for a
bit... the floor was empty, and the vibe was shite in the rest of the room,
so we split.

Over to Area 51, where, ohmigosh, there was Vanessa! Right up front givin'
a little shake to a Dj that was on a lineup for a Valentine's party she and
her crew were putting on... [cant remember his name.... Mike?MAD props
though] another METHED-OUT english/scottish Dj, who was tweakin' the vinyl
like he was tweakin' his face..., phat groove though, just before.. um,
mike.. there was another kickin' set... needless to say, I kept it up as
long as I could, my right leg was DEAD, my feet were numb, but still
managed to get funky a couple of times towards the end... we were so
cracked, we decided *not* to go to the CatWalk, which opened up at 10am or
so...

Sunday, we headed up to Vancouver.. wanted to get  in some of the night
life, but wasn't sure if I could hang after the last two nights... Spent
the late afternoon cruising around, just checking the sights.. met a little
girl named Kili in a foriegn country, on the corner of downtown Vancouver
[4 of us huddled around a map], she asked.. "um, can I help you find
something...?" my sister responded.. "yea, we're..." I interupted, "you
could really help us out by telling us what we *should* find, and where we
*should* go."  She then proceeded to tell us just about every tourist
attraction we should hit on our short trip.. including where the Spagetti
Factory was on Water St so we could get a reasonably priced dinner... She
was an angel.

Missed our 9:50 flight... so we went to a mall, and I got my hair cut/done
at a spanish-french salon... [for those of you who have seen my
long-hairedness.., you're in for a shocker when next we meet]. Caught the
3:00, last two again [122,123] we got a  bit of a buzz on [oh, crater lake
as pretty as a picture on the way up... Mt. Everest, Rainier, and St.
Helens on the way  back... oh, man... what can I say... beautiful] during
the ride back... a bit more crowded...

Bit of rain.. overcast.. wet, windy, and cold.. I LOVED IT! Can't wait to
go back late  this month or latest, January. Kim, I love your city.

Peace,
-SolR

There is a product called "stuff" put out by naturally clean herbal 
tea that claims a 99% success rate and a money back guarantee.
I never tried it or heard anything about it. Im just passing
along the info .  1-800-687-3499 for more info
or try any variety or health food store. Also lots of water to flush
out any chemicals and dilute any that remain. Plus diuretics
like cranberry juice or vinegar will also help.

  oooh! Scary!






Forwarded for your amusement:

The real name of Bill Gates is William Henry Gates III.

Nowadays he is known as Bill Gates.

By converting the letters of his current name to the ASCII-values and
adding his "3" (III), you get the following:

                            B       66

Some might ask, "How did Bill Gates get so powerful?" Coincidence? Or
just the beginning of mankind's  ultimate and total enslavement???

Before you decide, consider the following:

M  S  -  D  O  S     6  .  2  1

77+83+45+68+79+83+32+54+46+50+49= 666

W  I  N  D  O  W  S  9  5

87+73+78+68+79+87+83+57+53+1 =  666

Coincidence?  You decide.

As far as I know there is no Lepidoptera party. There _was_ going to be
one in December but it's been pushed back (Jan?)

If you want call the info line 408-535-0432. Pretty funny too!

===========================
the following contains sexually explicit language so if you dont want
to read it push delete now.

===========================
Online computer users often engage in what is affectionately known as
"cybersex."  Often the fantasies typed into keyboards and shared
through Internet phone lines get pretty raunchy.  However, as you'll
see below, one of the two cyber-surfers in the following transcript of
an online chat doesn't seem to quite get the point of cybersex.
Then again, maybe he does...

Wellhung: Hello, Sweetheart. What do you look like?

Sweetheart: I am wearing a red silk blouse, a miniskirt and high heels. I
work out every day, I'm toned and perfect.  My measurements are 36-24-36.
What do you look like?

Wellhung: I'm 6'3" and about 250 pounds. I wear glasses and I have on a 
pair
of blue sweat pants I just bought from Walmart. I'm also wearing a T-shirt
with a few spots of barbecue sauce on it from dinner...it smells funny.

Sweetheart: I want you. Would you like to screw me?

Wellhung: OK

Sweetheart: We're in my bedroom. There's soft music playing on the stereo 
and
candles on my dresser and night table. I'm looking up into your eyes,
smiling.  My hand works its way down to your crotch and begins to fondle 
your
huge, swelling bulge.

Wellhung: I'm gulping, I'm beginning to sweat.

Sweetheart: I'm pulling up your shirt and kissing your chest.

Wellhung: Now I'm unbuttoning your blouse. My hands are trembling.

Sweetheart: I'm moaning softly.

Wellhung: I'm taking hold of your blouse and sliding it off slowly.

Sweetheart: I'm throwing my head back in pleasure. The cool silk slides off
my warm skin.I'm rubbing your bulge faster, pulling and rubbing.

Wellhung: My hand suddenly jerks spastically and accidentally rips a hole 
in
your blouse. I'm sorry.

Sweetheart: That's OK, it wasn't really too expensive.

Wellhung: I'll pay for it.

Sweetheart: Don't worry about it. I'm wearing a lacy black bra. My soft
breasts are rising and falling, as I breath harder and harder.

Wellhung: I'm fumbling with the clasp on your bra. I think it's stuck. Do 
you
have any scissors?

Sweetheart: I take your hand and kiss it softly. I'm reaching back
undoing the clasp. The bra slides off my body. The air caresses my breasts.
My nipples are erect for you.

Wellhung: How did you do that? I'm picking up the bra and inspecting the
clasp.

Sweetheart: I'm arching my back. Oh baby. I just want to feel your tongue
all over me.

Wellhung: I'm dropping the bra. Now I'm licking your, you know,  breasts.
They're neat!

Sweetheart: I'm running my fingers through your hair. Now I'm nibbling your
ear.

Wellhung: I suddenly sneeze. Your breasts are covered with spit and phlegm.

Sweetheart: What?

Wellhung: I'm so sorry. Really.

Sweetheart: I'm wiping your phlegm off my breasts with the remains of my
blouse.

Wellhung: I'm taking the sopping wet blouse from you. I drop it with a 
plop.

Sweetheart: OK. I'm pulling your sweat pants down and rubbing you.

Wellhung: I'm screaming like a woman. Your hands are cold! Yeeee!

Sweetheart: I'm pulling up my miniskirt. Take off my panties.

Wellhung: I'm pulling off your panties. My tongue is going all over, in and
out nibbling on you... umm... wait a minute.

Sweetheart: What's the matter?

Wellhung: I've got a pubic hair caught in my throat. I'm choking.

Sweetheart: Are you OK?

Wellhung: I'm having a coughing fit. I'm turning all red.

Sweetheart: Can I help?

Wellhung: I'm running to the kitchen, choking wildly. I'm fumbling through
the cabinets, looking for a cup. Where do you keep your cups?

Sweetheart: In the cabinet to the right of the sink.

Wellhung: I'm drinking a cup of water. There, that's better.

Sweetheart: Come back to me, lover.

Wellhung: I'm washing the cup now.

Sweetheart: I'm on the bed arching for you.

Wellhung: I'm drying the cup. Now I'm putting it back in the cabinet. And 
now
I'm walking back to the bedroom. Wait, it's dark, I'm lost. Where's the
bedroom?

Sweetheart: Last door on the left at the end of the hall.

Wellhung: I found it.

Sweetheart: I'm tuggin' off your pants. I'm moaning. I want you so badly.

Wellhung: Me too.

Sweetheart: Your pants are off. I kiss you passionately-our naked bodies
pressing each other.

Wellhung: Your face is pushing my glasses into my face. It hurts.

Sweetheart: Why don't you take off your glasses?

Wellhung: OK, but I can't see very well without them. I place the glasses
on the night table.

Sweetheart: I'm bending over the bed. Give it to me, baby!

Wellhung: I have to pee. I'm fumbling my way blindly across the room and
toward the bathroom.

Sweetheart: Hurry back, lover.

Wellhung: I find the bathroom and it's dark. I'm feeling around for the
toilet. I lift the lid.

Sweetheart: I'm waiting eagerly for your return.

Wellhung: I'm done going. I'm feeling around for the flush handle, but  I
can't find it. Uh-oh!

Sweetheart: What's the matter now?

Wellhung: I've realized that I've peed into your laundry hamper. Sorry 
again.
I'm walking back to the bedroom now, blindly feeling my way.

Sweetheart: Mmm, yes. Come on.

Wellhung: OK, now I'm going to put my...you know ...thing...in your...you
know...woman's thing.

Sweetheart: Yes! Do it, baby! Do it!

Wellhung: I'm touching your smooth butt. It feels so nice. I kiss your 
neck.
Umm, I'm having a little trouble here.

Sweetheart: I'm moving my ass back and forth, moaning. I can't stand it
another second! Slide in!  Screw me now!

Wellhung: I'm flaccid.

Sweetheart: What?

Wellhung: I'm limp. I can't sustain an erection.

Sweetheart: I'm standing up and turning around; an incredulous look on my
face.

Wellhung: I'm shrugging with a sad look on my face, my weiner all floppy. 
I'm
going to get my glasses and see what's wrong.

Sweetheart: No, never mind. I'm getting dressed. I'm putting on my 
underwear.
Now I'm putting on my wet nasty blouse.

Wellhung: No wait! Now I'm squinting, trying to find the night table. I'm
feeling along the dresser, knocking over cans of hair spray, picture frames
and your candles.

Sweetheart: I'm buttoning my blouse. Now I'm putting on my shoes.

Wellhung: I've found my glasses. I'm putting them on. My God! One of our
candles fell on the curtain. The curtain is on fire! I'm pointing at it, a
shocked look on my face.

Sweetheart: Go to hell. I'm logging off, you loser!

Wellhung: Now the carpet is on fire! Oh noooo!

Sweetheart: <logged off>

Hi all!  ]=}

 THC (the active ingredient tested for in urine tests) builds up in the 
fatty tisues over time. A personal amount in the urine would depend 
on *overall* use over the past mounth or so and how much body fat the 
person averaged (ectomorphs get off easy as they have almost no fat).

 Typically what one wants to do is to drink lots of fluids (water, 
cranberry juice--at least a gallon a day), especially 24 hours prior to 
testing. Take a B-complex vitamin two hours before  testing to yellow up 
your urine and possibly contaminate the test. I've also used Golden Seal 
powder in capsules. Passed the test after getting stoney for the first 
time in a while at Freaky People.

 Keep in mind this is very unprofessional advice and you use it at your 
own risk.  ;)

Help!!
This is my last resort.  Can anybody out there either tell me or recomend
to me something that would depict the charkras in a sybolic form.  I am
looking for meanin ful symbolism, characters, something like what Alex
Grey uses in some of his painting (which I haven't been able to find
either)  I am working on a painting and I am trying to incorperate
aspects of the chakras to emphasise a more spiritual point in my work.
I know alot of you are into astrology and different aspects of
spirtuality, I am hoping some one will have ideas to help.  I want a
universal symbol that would be recongnized by those that know and thought
provoking to those that don't.

Thanks 

Rlove

Something to do while in line for my next party...
assuming someone (hmm, who could I be talking about) is using pure caffene in
his research project.... :)  how much is like a deadly dose, how much would
he find very interesting, and how much is ther in a coke?  Think about the
possibilities.. acess to pure, legal white powders...:)  funny thing is I'm
using nicotine too and that shit is nasty... I will never even think about
smoking again. Nicotine is used as an insecticide, causes muscle
contractions... and get this... one or 2 drops of pure nicotine on your skin
will kill you.  It has to be stored as a hazardous substance.....uugh. Should
we start to filter out this thread..  NRR?

hmmm.... a party near me.. I love it when this happens... + I have a cal
parking permit!!  haha... rest of you are going to have to.... park!  :)  by
the way, parking can be a pain in the butt on the weekends in berkeley,
especially around the campus..  You might just park in a cal lot and pay the
$3 or whatever.  but you have to have your car out by 2am.  Maybe if we end
up going to a movie and it is 18+, there wil be enoughtof us that are 18 that
the rest of us can get away with not being 18.. :)  I see the logic here,
anyone else?

I can just put you on the list of people who want to go for sure and will
researve a ticket for you if you would like. Just let me know. Are there
any other parties that night? you could probably get in as early as 8 if
you wanted but probably start around 9 or 10.  :)

Surgeons are now experimenting with injecting caffene after surgery.
It seems to prevent the headaches that often result from surgery.
I swear i am not making this up.

and nicotine pills are being used as a pain killer/sedative.

whoever was saying rude comments on my post about the age thing: CHILL. I was
merely stating that I dont know many other 15 year olds on this list, and that
age doesnt matter. whether you were joking or not, i took it seriously. I dont
think that the age of a person can be determined by a number, but rather the
experience that he/she has lived in his or her own life. I've gone through so
much shit in my 16 years of living that judging me on a number would be kind
of dumb. Just because some 16 year olds are immature, doesnt mean that ALL 16
year olds are immature. I know people well into their 20 who act WAY younger
than I do. So should I judge all 25 year olds by those 2 people? No. 
 
if you dont agree with what i'm saying and think its totally stupid, thank you
for at least taking the time to read it.

Roland Digital Group - 3D Machines


 Roland Digital Group adds to its line-up of CAMM-3
 machines a new concept in rapid prototyping or hobby
building. The PICZA 3D Scanner and the MODELA 3D
                    Plotter.

  

                                              



        

  
     The PICZA 3D
     Scanner
                   
                              The MODELA 3D
                              Plotter


          The PICZA 3D Scanner is an automatic
  piezo-electric scanning device used to capture any
 3-dimensional object from glass bottles to small ribbon
bows or even clay mock-ups. Once the object has been
 scanned, it can be scaled and reproduced in a variety of
 modeling materials with the MODELA 3D Plotter. The
PICZA and MODELA can be sold separately, but when
used as companion products they enable model builders,
    jewelry designers, woodworkers, toy and game
 designers, decorative craft artists, and home hobbyists
 to enter a virtual or real 3D world by exporting scanned
 files into VRML web page designs or producing actual
  physical prototypes of their customized designs. Both
   machines provide their own Windows95 software
  program. The PICZA ships with Dr. PICZA software
  and the MODELA ships with MODELA Player, 3D
  Design, and 3D Text software. The PICZA MSRP is
     $1495USD and the MODELA is $1195USD. 
                          

                         

  With PICZA, details are captured. With MODELA,
            concepts become reality.   
      If you want to bring your models to the real world,
 PICZA scans interface with the MODELA 3D Plotter
 seamlessly. The MODELA Player program is accessed
 directly through the Dr. PICZA software by the click of
   an icon. Convert your wireframe images to real 3D
 conceptual prototypes with the MODELA 3D Plotter in
  a variety of modeling materials including balsa wood,
 Styrofoam, foamboard, soft plastics, and modeling wax,
               just to name a few. 
                         
       The PICZA connects to your laptop or desktop
computer system through a serial (com port) connection
 while the MODELA connects to the computer through
   a parallel connection (lpt port). This allows for both
    machines to be connected to the same computer
simultaneously without the need for any switch boxes or
 continual reconnecting of one machine or the other. You
   can be scanning one project on the PICZA while
 producing a physical prototype of another project with
  the MODELA - - at the same time. All this can be
  accomplished completely unattended!   PICZA and
    MODELA. They take your designs into the next
                   dimension.

Would somebody who needs a project for school or just would like to 
benefit mankind conduct a thourough test on these differant products?
I dont think it would be hard to find 'subjects' , well maybe getting 
them to drink a gallon of juice a day....

I would vote for Nomads but they moved recently and for the life of me I
can't exactly remember where (call information or something).  Get
Christian to do it if you can, he is the owner.  You can't miss him, he
is the one with the tribal tatoos on his face.  It cost $60 when I got my
tongue pierced there  about six months ago.  All the guys that work there
have really great tats also, they could probably recommend a reputable
place in the city for you.  I got my tat in Colorado, they are way to
expensive in this part of town.  I am getting my next one when I go back
sometime mid January maybe. Good luck and start thinking of getting a
blender if you don't have one because it is going to be hard to eat for
awhile.  Tats are way less uncomfortable in my book, the tongue is the
worse.

Actually the best way is to drink a lot of water and a diuretic of some
sort (beer, coffee, cranberry juice) the night before, to flush out
your system.  Then the day of the test, drink lots again, pee a few
times before the test, and take a B-complex vitamin, so your urine 
isn't all clear.  And if you can help it, don't give them the first
or last bit out of your bladder.  My . . . uh . . . friend did this
and passed a piss test the day after smoking down.

Might check the NORML site, too, as they may have some advice.

Cheers,
Steve.

Confessions ' makes me want to get naked and watch Bullitt at 6am with a
tall boy of ice cold Coors and Hunter S. Thompson at my side..."  The
effect will be different for some, but the groove is universal.

*Astral Matrix-#6                SR9718               out now          12"
label: Silent / O.O.B.E.
Straight outta San Francisco's underground, Astral Matrix's sixth 12" adds
another thumpin' chapter to the OOBE catalog.  A solid four tracker, '
Number Six ' covers a lot of territory.  From the lush technological cut '
Bass Faerie ' to the darkly percussive and minimal track ' Triangles ',
this EP is yet another achievement for this excellent local artist.

*Jondi & Spesh-We Are Connected  SR9722                out now          12"
Inspired by the Sweet! parties and ' Live at Half moon Bay ' show, this is
the second EP in the collaboration between Trip 'N Spin and Silent.  Floor
rocking trancey house with a left-coast feel.  Remixes by NovaBass.

Hi there everyone!

Just wanted to drop a quick note about an event that was intentionally
left off the calender.  From what I've seen, the only stuff that's
listed is 21+ so I figured I pass the word to the sfravers who still
check the mail... : )

So the party is in celebration of Dan, Jeff and Ashley's birthdays.  It
will be in the EastBay at a small intimate place in a nice part of
Oakland.  The capicity of this event is limited to about 180 people so
if you want to come out I'd get there early!  dj's: Jason Peacock, Sean
Murray, Jeff Taisch, John Howard, and Galen.  This event will be held at
our friends warehouse so please respect the space.  The party is only $4
but when we can't handle any more people we're going to shut the doors.  
So there it is.  If you think you'll have great time we'd love to see
you there...

	Respectfully,
		Jeff, Dan and Ashley
		(the birthday people)

        Super herbal clean tea has worked for all of my friends who have used 
it.  I beleive its one of the oldest remedies.  Friends of mine also smoked the 
night before the test and they passed.

Two easy instructions
1 start drinking lots of water now.
2 follow the instructions for the tea exactly..
Thats it.!
it can be purchased at paramount Imports off of Meridian
Peace

Actually the best way is to drink a lot of water and a diuretic of some
sort (beer, coffee, cranberry juice) the night before, to flush out
your system.  Then the day of the test, drink lots again, pee a few
times before the test, and take a B-complex vitamin, so your urine 
isn't all clear.  And if you can help it, don't give them the first
or last bit out of your bladder.  My . . . uh . . . friend did this
and passed a piss test the day after smoking down.

Might check the NORML site, too, as they may have some advice.

Cheers,
Steve.

hahha... kinda funny but i thought the same thing too... and there is
only so much ''experience'' that one can obtain at the tender age of
15...

now being much older... i know that my elders know a whole lot more than
me... even though i thought i knew it all at 16... funny how that works
eh... 

And as far as the hard drugz go.. i only can wish that i had waited
until my mind was more prepared to deal with the realizations that drug
use forced upon me... 

all i am trying to say i suppose is.. Enjoy.. being young.. .enjoy not
having to go to work every darn day... enjoy the innocence that your age
still allows you.....

I'm going out on a limb and posting my number so people can call me for

Persian Chicken Stew & Pasta with Tomato Basil Sauce to prepare. I 
bought lots of fresh bread and fruit so please come and eat. I live in

well, movie wise, if you wnat the pants scared off you and to be totally
grossed out i recomend Alien Resurection.  it was so scary it made me
cry, but then im kinda a wimp :)  so if you're into that, i recomend
it.  i also thought it was a pretty good story, although very familiar
to the past alien movies, but then, how much can you do with it huh? ;)

Also, spike and mikes festival of animation is going on, but for some
reason i think it may be 18+ so check it out before you commit yourself
:)

or you could do my standby bored activity: IRC :) :) come join us fun
people in #sfraves :)

if you can make it to oakland early fri nite there's tracy's
<aurora8@earthlink.net> dinner party and afterwards a rave/birthday
party also in oakland - sounds like a small, privately run warehousey
gig so i bet its all ages - ask <aminita@linex.com> to make sure, you
can also reserve yourself a ticket or two.  then on saturday nite is
byroni's birthday party, not sure how big/where it is or if someone's
spinning but since they are aspiring rave promoters maybe they'll be
trying to build their rep with this party - mail byroni for info
<byroni@ccnet.com>...  then on sunday in berkely is the free rave in
people's park, apparantly a bunch of sfravers are gonna be there and
maybe get dinner afterwards.  also there's the spike & mike animation
fest nearby, supposedly 18+ but maybe the over 18's can sneak you in
through the exit ;)

personally i'm thinking of making it an sfraves weekend and attending
all these functions, so all youse guys look for me - i'll be wearing a
round white gilligan hat hanging over my eyes, and by saturday i'll
have definately made my moire-patterned sfraves laminate.  so feel
free to introduce yourselves, it's about time i met some of you folx...

Here we thought that Bill was the anti-christ.  I give you this postulate:



Exercise in Logic Applied
 -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

  Given:      Barney is a cute purple dinosaur

  Prove:      Barney is Satan
  1) Start with the given:
     C U T E   P U R P L E   D I N O S A U R

  2) Change all U's to V's (which is proper Latin anyway):
     CVTE PVRPLE DINOSAVR

  3) Extract all Roman Numerals:

   C  V  V  L  D  I  V

  4) Convert into Arabic values:

  100  5  5  50  500  1  5

  5) Add all the numbers:

  666

  Coincidence?  I think NOT!

Hello all...

Wow -- I was actually off sfr for a month and a half!!  Whoa.  How time flies
when you're working hard!  Anyways...  I'm back and *jonesing* to boogie!

Oh, and one other thing...  I want to send out B-day greetings to one of the
coolest guys in the SF scene that I've had the pleasure of meeting.  That's
right - Terry Estioko [of Viberation fame] is having a birthday tomorrow.
 Viberation's Wavelength back in April was what *really* solidified in my head
that raving was for me and I thank Terry and the whole Vibe crew [esp. Li -
I'll never forget that set...] for putting on such a PHAT party.  You guys
ROCK!!

Have a great weekend everyone.  I'm going to be scarce this month as it's
boarding season [!] but I hope to make it out soon to see y'all lovely people -
you haven't gotten ugly in the past month have you guys? =)

Beth

Does anyone have access to a high-res color printer that I may use to
print and image?

I'll happily pay for the color toner, the time, etc - via money, imagery,
or other digital favors.

Amen...  I was totally offended by some people comments on this list.  The
thing is the pople that seem to make offensive comments are those that I
never actually see at the parties that we're supposed to be discussing.
 Everyone has the right to say whatever he or she chooses on this list, but
the only thing we have to judge people's character by on this list is what
they write.  You write mean shit... I think you're mean shit.  I guess that's
my 2 cents added to marq's.... that makes 5 cents, last I checked. :)

I don't know if any of you care, but I was really sick last weekend and
didn't feel like I had a lot to be thankful for.

I thought I was going to have to call 911, because I was so congested a
couple times I realized breathing was becoming a very difficult thing.

I thought about music a lot, and about dancing, and how beautiful it is to
feel that feeling, when you forget about whether or not your shoes are
tied, or breathing right, or who's watching, and just do a beautiful
dance.  Not because somebody else thinks it's amazing, but because you
know it's how to feel best for each part of the beat, for the track, for
the room and the people you are connecting to around you.  I never danced
as a child, my father thought it stupid, and I was raised with celebration
and frivilousness as a part of reality a good man rejected in order to
stay true to the "important" things.

I always get kinda loopy around the end of the year, because as some of
you may know, I don't live near any of my childhood (or high school or
college) friends or family. I basically have two little worlds that I live
in, the work world and the play world.  In case you're wondering, most of
you would qualify as people who I have met in my play world.

So I felt like I had no friends, and I ran into some tough moments this
week, but I wanted to thank all the really supportive words of everybody
around that kept me sane for the last year or so.

I have a few people I can really call my friends, and most of them know
who they are.  I also got a real wake up call when a couple people I had
never really spent time with just sent me these beautiful messages over
the past couple days (Leslie, Jen, Amanda, John, Alex, Herb; special
thanks to you for helping me through *one of those weeks*).

There is a lot of drama, a lot of addiction, a lot of confusion, a lot of
lies, a lot of greed and grandstanding, and a lot of stuff perhaps less
desirable than any of those going on in the scene, but at a fundamental
level the love is real. 

I started spinning out just earlier this year.  I don't know if I'm "up
there" or ever will be with a lot of the home town secrets that we have
here on the list, but I wanted to thank all the people who went out of
their way to share what music is with me (especially the long talks about
stuff from that weird perspective).

Thank you especially to the Harmony family for opening their arms and
hearts to me, and to the other families that have allowed me to grow and
learn about this magic.  The Cloud Factory, BBQ & Beats, Viberation, I do
not know how I can thank you enough for putting up with the real me... I'm
a quirky bastard, but the reward is that everything that comes back is
real.  There are other families I have been on the periphery of that have
invited me to come join with them in their celebrations of life, and to
them I owe much gratitude as well.

There are parts of the scene that are propelled by money, and there are
parts of the scene that are propelled by love and fascination.  In the
next couple months, I get the feeling it's going to be harder to tell them
apart, but I wanted to make a long clear shout out to those that still
feel the love.

I didn't sit with a family this year and count my blessings, but with this
year in particular, I wanted to come back to the people that met me with
open arms in the last year and a half or so and say thank you.

I don't think in the coming year I will be able to try quite so hard... 
and drag sound from party to party, or play out much, or stay till the
morning comes with people who deserve the world (and will get it if they
stay with an honest path and a true heart).  I am going to make sure my
play life is important, but not so important as to jeapordize what I have
spent most of my life building (which is, oddly enough, my life). 

I have learned much about forgiveness, and politics, and understanding.
I've come to have a lot of respect for people I often disagree with from
this list, and learned to give credit to people who often sell themselves
short out of confidence that they are growing in their own as I grow in
mine.

To the weirdos, the visionaries, the djs, the promoters, the happy kids
and the grumpy folk, to the people who extended amazingly with nothing but
trust in an idea, to the people I sold short, to the people who sometimes
wonder why they sweat for free, to the people who put it on the line to
show others a beautiful moment, and most of all to those who dance without
prejudice...

I love who you are collectively and in many cases individually, and I'm so
glad we live in a time when this can come into our lives in just the way
it does.  Please take care of the scene.  Stay honest, loving, open,
respectful, true, hardcore, cheap, accessible and beautiful.

I'm not leaving the list, I'm not leaving the scene, I might be mellowing
out a little and somewhere in all this I wanted to appreciate everything
we were, are and are yet to become.

Peace,
AndyW

p.s.	Todd, thanks for making me go to that second party after I swore
to never go to another after the first.

Hello and peace be with you.
I don't suppose anyone from the south bay will be leaving for the city
after midnight tonight  will they??
If so I'd be very much appreciative of a ride and will willingly pay for
gas.
I don't need a ride back

Spring.

Stay good, and look for us in April/May.

whoa.  since you're like the third (fourth?) person to say something
(including a private email) i figure maybe i oughtta speak up.  i
don't know if you're referring to my post in particular, but since i
made an "age joke" i'll assume this was directed at me, among others. 
i really gotta say, the last thing i meant was to be mean - i was
trying to be funny.  i admit i'm sorta proud to be where i am today
(good job + interesting life outside of work, of which raving is a big
part) at my rather advanced age (i'm 29).  and i place a high value on
all the crazy experiences i've had over the years.  but i don't think
i'm, like, ageist or anything.

i know that some people may have problems with a younger generation
coming along and "taking" their subculture - it seems like i've heard
comments along those lines on sfraves occasionally.  but as for
myself, honestly, i have nothing against people younger than me, quite
the contrary.  i mean, what the hell would i be doing still raving if
i did?  i like raves and i like ravers, and i've never really minded
that i've grown a decade older than a lot of the people i see now at
parties. certainly i appreciate the amount of acceptance i've found in
the community despite that age difference.

i still say there are advantages to being older, but dont worry,
you'll find out for yourself.  in the meantime just enjoy the ride.

peace,
messiah

ps we've seen each other at parties, we just didn't know it.

CHILL.
I was
merely stating that I dont know many other 15 year olds on this list,
and that
age doesnt matter. whether you were joking or not, i took it seriously.
I dont
think that the age of a person can be determined by a number, but
rather the
experience that he/she has lived in his or her own life. I've gone
through so
much shit in my 16 years of living that judging me on a number would be
kind
of dumb. Just because some 16 year olds are immature, doesnt mean that
ALL 16
year olds are immature. I know people well into their 20 who act WAY
younger
than I do. So should I judge all 25 year olds by those 2 people? No. 
 
if you dont agree with what i'm saying and think its totally stupid,
thank you
for at least taking the time to read it.

All in good fun...  =)

Love,
Forest

The "How Sexy Are Your Sounds" article by Sara Finlayson reads:

Music Style--HOUSE
Audience:  Platinum American Express cocaine crowd.
Attire: Sophisticated gals in tight-fitting black lycra and open-shirted
fellows sporting gold medallions. Also big among the gay community where
shirts are usually off.
Motions:  Bumping and grinding. Always sweaty.
Sex Status:  Everyone likes to "do it" here. A veritable meat market.
Get Laid?: 10 outta 10

Music Style--JUNGLE/D&B
Audience:  Fed-up ex-ravers and hyperactive Hip-Hop heads. Relatively young,
more popular with girls than most forms of electronic music.
Attire:  Hip-Hop meets rave goes for a skate and then joins the Army.
Motions:  Flipper-like motions of the hands with a few moves collected from
watching Beat Street.  Circle dancer meets MC Hammer.
Sex Status:  Jungle, like other forms of bass-heavy music, is very sexy.
Get Laid?:  6 outta 10

Music Style--TECHNO
Audience: Dudes who've been in the rave scene way too long.
Attire:  What I came in.
Motions:  Leaning against the wall discussing why Techno is superior to every
other form of music on the planet.
Sex Status:  Too busy talking about Techno to notice.
Get Laid?:  3 otta 10

Music Style--HARDCORE/GABBER
Audience:  Tweeked out teens.  Predominantly frustrated males.  Also popular
with serial killers.
Attire:  Multiple piercings, wife-beater shirts, baggy trousers, and short
hair.
Motions:  Vigorous jumping up and down, pogo'ing, and speaker fucking.
Sex Staus:  Stuck midway through adolescent masturbatory phase.  Anxious and
feverish dance style suggests an urgent need to get laid.
Get Laid?:  0 outta 10 (only a mother could love these guys)

Music Style--GOA/PSYCH TRANCE
Audience:  Crusties and anti-establishment trust fund babies
Attire:  Matted dreadlocks, tie dye, and sandals remain popular.  A faint
whiff of Nag Champa is usually evident.
Motions:  Hippie dance style reminiscent of '60s exploitation movies. Crazy
arms motions and rubbery legs usually point to excessive LSD intake.
Sex Status:  Attractive to each other. Hose down before use.
Get Laid?:  Depends on the phase of the Moon.

Music Style--PROGRESSIVE HOUSE/TRANCE
Audience:  University students and candy ravers.
Attire:  'E' friendly apparel, including fluffy backpacks, glitter,
pacifiers, and anything resembling a Dr.Suess character.
Motions:  Hands in the air.  Eyes rolling back.  Occasionally slumped against
the wall.
Sex Status:  No thanks...we're in it for the music. Hugs welcome.
Get Laid?: Males: 2 outta 10 (too busy trainspotting), Females: 6 outta 10
(they look great...to dirty old men)

hey its just water with a few heavy metals and other assorted
pollutants.

I say we just get a few umbrellas and dance around in the
mud like aboriginies or somethin..

And we can do the indian rain dance...the one where you 
dance in a circle and create a vortex that blows a hole 
in the rain clouds above the circle and keeps everything inside
the circle dry. Then after we are covered with mud we can 
stomp on down thru town to phat slice for a bit of pizza.

Subject: VSF  & Stompy...hesitant review (LONG!).
Sender: sfraves-owner@hyperreal.org
Precedence: bulk

Hello All,

I have been hesitating to write this letter in order to take some time to
gather my thoughts.  After some time, and after seeing nzinga's post (hello
sistah), I wanted to briefly talk about what happened to me at my favorite
party, Stompy Stomp.

This past Sunday (December 1, 1997) I decided to take advantage of the fact
that I had some free time so my SO (Megan), Michele, and I decided to do
the Stompy Stomp.  we got there at around 4 p.m., and settlted right into
the madness.

I started drinking immediately! :)  Got to talk to a few friends (Solar,
Rawno bka Andrew Rawnsley, DJ Danni (bka 'girl' Danni), Andy, Vince,
Preston, Geoff W, and various assorted friends of friends. I sat outdie
chatting up Danni for quite a while, talked to Lon of Pure for quite a few
as well.

After all of my chattiness, and 4 beers later (for a grand total of 5...I
had done no drugs during stompy, I had taken no hallucinogens mind you) and
at about 8 p.m. I get a tap on my shoulder from this short security guard
named Ali.  At this time I had interrupted my conversation with Rawno to
talk to Mr. Security.  He asked me "Sir, can you come with me please?", I
immediately turned around and said "Sure!"  as we were walking he kept
directing me toward the front entrance (which I was not far from anyway), I
then knew something was really , really wrong.  I then asked him "Is there
a problem?", "can you please step outside sir.  You're drunk and you need
to exit the club.".  I was shocked. I had a sinking feeling that I would
not be able to get back into the club, talk to my SO, or leave in a
dignified manner.  I then asked him "Why are you asking me to leave?" (note
my tone was one of shock, not beligerance, I kept my voice low so that only
he could hear, and I was paying proper respect), "we have gotten three
complaints about you, you can't even stand up!  You bumped into three
people...", "Who were the people, I didn;t bump into anyone this evening,
I've been standing in front of the bar talking to my girl, her friend, and
my other friends...what are you talking about?  What did I do?".  "Sir,
you'll have to step outside for a while and sober up!", I said "hey man, I
didn't do anything.  As for being drunk, I am not.  I am tipsy, but I've
been standing right here having conversations with peoiple...I have done
nothing and you're throwing me out!".  At this point my voice was getting
louder and was drawing some attention.  I was going to be put out in the
cold, w/o a jacket, because, er, I was drunk?  Huh?  Well *fuck* this place
I thought.  I got some attention of my various friends, Geoof W got my
girlfriend and I told security that "Hey listen, I am not going outside.
Instead I'll leave.  You can follow me as I get my things and get my
girlfriend and her friend.  I can;t beleive this, I'm going to tell
Preston!".  At this point there are now tree security guards trying to
figure out what to do.  Ali responded "Hey Preston is just the promoter,
were security!", "Fine!", I replied "fuck this club, I'm outta here, I'm
going to stand here until my girl and jacket arrive and we're out of
security's club!".

Megan brought me my jacket (she was in worse shape than me btw), Michele
got her things (she was stumbling), and we left.  Geoff W frantically asked
me if I wanted to get Preston.  I said "Hey man, fuck this place!  Preston
is playing, don't disturb him.  These secutiy pricks are fucks, and I'm
outta here!"  By this time there is a definite commotion, Maddy tries to
talk to security but instead compliments them on the fine job they were
doing (heresey, this was tolf to me by security...I couldn't hear what
Maddy was saying. although I saw her pat security on the back).  We left
the club, and I cursed them in Arabic.  Man they were really mad.  I then
called security a bunch of pricks, to thier face, one of them threatened to
step outside the ropes, at which time I told him if he touched me it would
be battery and he would lose his balls.  By this time I am out of the club,
and losing it.  Right before I began my second series of Arab curses, I
told them all that they were a bunch of pricks, and left.  I then got in
the car, pissed, and buzzed.  I sat there for a second and stewed.  I
couldn;t beleive it, *ejected* from a stompy.  There was *nobody else*
ejected from that club, just me, for various vague reasons, by various
vague people. Hmmm...I got in my car and drove around the block.  I hadn't
had enough, so I went back around, got out of the car, got back into the
club (can you beleive this, they let me back in...), one of the security
stopped me, and I said, I just want to talk to Maddy.  I had some words ,
then left cursing again.  Got threatened again, but this time laughed and
kept walking.

Went home, and crashed.

Left messages for Preston to call me on his home and vox mail line.  We
were scheduled to have dinner on Wednesday and I informed him this would be
at the top of the agenda before anything else.

Preston and I had our meeting (as we do every month, we're very old friends
and hook up to impress each other with dinner at various great restaurants
in the city) and we laughed about what happened and talked.

At this time I told him that I thought that it was peculiar that *I* was
ejected when I was actually on top form behaviour.  I wasn't loud, I did no
controlled substances at his club, I bought drinks for friends and myself ,
tipped well, and talked with many people.  I wasn't stumbling, and I wasn't
bumping or grabbing people, I was just *talking*!  So I told him that I've
seen this kind of behaviour before in So. Cal. and in Florida (where I'm
from).  The Red Onion in So. Cal. for a long tiem had a policy of making
sure the club didn;t get, er too dark.  Or if brothers were chatty with
white women they were, er, *ejected*, for various other reasons "You're out
of dress code", or "Complaints from other patrons", or worse, not even let
in at all.  At this Stompy it felt just like that.  Vague reasons, and
vague accusers, with me merely talking to people (now at one time I was
talking to my girl, her friend, and another girl...joking around and
talking noise...basically having a good time!).  But, as in the south and
other places in this country, if they're women of another race, especially
white, this can cause some problems.  Now I have *no proof* that this was
the motive, and since there were other black males in the place who weren;t
ejected, Preston figured it was just another incident of the security at
VSF getting out of control.

I don't doubt Preston, or his expertise.  I also don't doubt people's
predjudices, and problems, nor my experiences in life.  I also cannot
discount the fact that:
-There were people who were actually stumbling and falling, even sleeping
on the dance floor. They were not ejected (I was the *only* one that
evening).
-There was someone who got some contraband confiscated.  They were not ejected.
-There were people smoking substances. They were not ejected.

The only difference between myself and the people who were not ejected was
the most obvious artifact.  I was the only person of color who was not
doing any of that stuff.  All I did was drink and chat and I was ejected.

Anyone who knows me for any period of time knows this:  I will look for
every other reason before I cry "race".  Now I do love to discuss racial
issues, and race in general, I think it is important.  But I do not live my
life thinking that there is a grand conspiracy, or that everyone has a
racial problem.  On the contrary, I think everyone has problems, race *may*
or equally *may not* be one of them.  Sometimes a cigar is a cigar and race
has little to do with someone's firing, hiring, etc.  Then  on occasion
(for some more occasion than others) there is the "race" thing that rears
it's ugly sick head.  I think my ejection was one of those times.

Preston, as wel talked, didn;t know how to approach the issue of security
with VSF.  To him, I was just another incident in a long line of incidents
with security that has happened at VSF, none of them in sequence, none of
them easily related:
-The club goes from 12-10p.m., and security decides to close the doors at
9:30 and shut down the party at roughly the same time?
-DJ's, even Preston, gettin harassed by security.  One of them even
threatened Preston while playing.
-Not allowing people in's & out's when it's raining and cold outside
(basically allowing people to leave w/o telling them they can't get back
in).

And the list goes on.

During the dinner Preston said he would talk with security, but didn't know
how he would apprach this problem or the littany of others, since they are
not related.  I insisted that something was particualrly weird about my
ejection versus people who were really off their rocker.  In the end, he
was puzzled to.

I am no longer puzzled.  VSF has a very serious problem with their
security, and their security has problems with people of color at raves.

I did happen to talk to Ali, and when I mentioned to him that it might be a
racial thing he said "Hey man, we have many African-American's at our club.
We host a party on Wednesday that is primarily African-American.  We have
no problem with African-Americans", I replied "Yes, but you do have a
problem when there is a minority of Af-Am's & majority of whites mixing!".
Silence, then a restatement of his facts and views.

Now the data can be intepreted many ways:
-I was drunk and had to go. (Ok for arguments sake given, then why was this
not applied to all the patrons equally?).
-VSF Security doesn't have a problem with Af. Am's because they do host a
Wednesday Hip-Hop thang.  (Ok for arguments sake given,  but that does not
answer the question of do they have a problem when Af ams are in the
minority?  *OR* do they have a problem with af-am's being ravers instead of
hip-hopper's?  Hmmm....).
-I just got caught in the trap. (Ok given, why was I the only one?).


I have no beef with Stompy.  I love Stompy and the crew of Stompy.  I love
Preston, he's my man.  However, I have serious reservations about VSF and
it's prejudiced security.  I know of one other brother who got shit that
night, and I'll leave it to him to discuss his problems if he wishes.  But
the fact that I was singled out, in the midst of everything else, and
wasn't doing anything leaves me suspect.  All things given, and everything
equal, I was singled out.  From my view, because I am black and was
chatting up with too may ladies of the opposite race.  That is the only
disinction between me and others in the club who were not ejected.

Yes, times have changed.  But there are vortices of the past everywhere.
there is obviously one at VSF.

I called VSF twice, talked to todd and he hasn;t called me back.  Tristan
is the  manager and I've not heard from him.  So their silence is
acceptance.

Brothers and sisters be warned.  If you are a person of color at that club,
be very careful of what you do and who you do it with.  Security is
watching, and they've got a job to do! ;(

(NOTE:  VSF security is *looking* for you to be doing something wrong.  You
probalby won't be ejected, but they will use thier brute force to take what
you have, pocket it, use it, and let you alone.  You have been warned.  Be
careful).

I won't be going to any more events @ VSF until I get some satisfaction
that this problem has been solved.

I'm done with VSF,
John

P.S.  I wonder does VSF know that if I got into a car accident because I
was to drunk to drive that *they* are held *totally* responsible
(precedence for this is california law!).  Hmmm...maybe it's time for me to
join the litiginous frey.  I'm consdering my options.

P.S.S.  Also note, I took this to all parties concerned before talking
about it publicly.  I gave this issue alot of thought.  I would be saddened
if this hurt my friends party, but *I* was hurt, and this could have caused
irreperable harm to me my family, and of course the club (i.e. if they come
to the conclusion someones drunk, cut them off, don't send them out into
the streets).  Draw your own conclusions and act in accordance with your
concience.

Peace! And I'm sorry this post was so long, but reality happens! :)

I myself had some "strange" interactions at the last Stompy with the
security force at the club. I'm not sure about these guys, I personally
have worked with, a lease 70% of the guys who do club security in San
Francisco. I myself have done (and will do) security at underground parties
and other events, most of these guys know me, they know where I'm coming
from, and that I treat them with the utmost respect.  This bunch at VSF
seems to be "green" at least. They have been accused of doing the standard
immature thing of watching people, cornering them, confiscating their
stashes AND DISTRIBUTING THE WARES AMONGST THMESELVES. I had an incident
with one where I was following a promoter out to her car to get more flyers
for an upcoming party to be held AT THAT VENUE!! I asked the security guard
(sensing the foolishness that had been going on all night) whether I could
go out with the person, escort her to her car and get the flyers, he said
no If I go out I gotta pay again, I said I didn't pay in the first place :)
and I'm just going to flyers to promote an upcoming party AT THIS VENUE,
the guy then gets a little belligerent (which to me was kinda funny cuz I
have a good 1 foot of height on him :) pushes his chest into me like saying
hey don't give me any shit, the promoter I was with sensed an altercation
brewing and diffused it by quickly going into her backpack and giving me
what flyers she had left :) I didn't think much of this incident, (except
that the security seemed on roids or crank, a condition that I have come in
contact with before) but then John was ejected for doing absolutely 
NOTHING! ( I was with him off and on for most of the night and he seemed
very well behaved, in a party where the bottom line is to get a good crack on.
I saw many people in a more extreme state of inebriation then John was in
yet they were not ejected. I myself had one glass of cider the entire
night, and got weird shit from the security, could it be the fact that I
was holding hands with a beautiful Caucasian woman and these guys got
pissed off? I don't know, my mind generally doesn't go there, the promoter
and I are friends, as with most of my friends we hug sometimes kiss and
hold hands as many raver's do.  I myself came with 4 women one arabic, one
African and two europeans. I flirted with many more :) There were not a lot
of African American males in the club so I don't know what this means, I'd
like to think that it just is security on 'roids and not racially motivated
because if it is it will put a very bad damper on one of the most diverse
and interesting parties that San Francisco has to offer, I hope Preston get
his house in order cuz "we don't need this Fascist groove thang!"

Yea. Some said it surpassed all expectations. Any lack at BM was due to 
commercial, spectator inducing scum like Space Children (oooh, was that 
nasty enough?  [teehee])

Somehow I don't think your description of your shape matches with reality,

I had a feeling this was coming, and lo and behold, there it is, right on
my screen.

Yup, since you have *no proof* I would drop it right now. I don't think you
should have even brought it up w/o proof. I think (1) your version of the
story is completely bogus and you were ripped or (2) VSF bullies w/o necks
were out of hand or (3) a combination of the (1) & (2).

But as Andy Rooney says, that's just my opinion based on reading your one
post.

How do you know this? Did you get a tally from security? Just cause you didn't
see it doesn't mean it didn't happen.

There is another difference buddy ... maybe the contraband dudes did not
"bump into people" or "stumble around drunk" as you were claimed to have done?
it is not as obvious as you claim

> it's ugly sick head.  I think my ejection was one of those times.

Maybe you pissed off the wrong guy and this was retribution. This should have
been just a molehill.

I thought you said you had no proof ... and now this statement?

I have this much to say about any of Sharif's comments:  First of all I
don't know who knows you or really who you are.  Other than an irritant, I
find you tedious, annoying, a net cop, and most of all boring.

Secondly, since Sharif was not there at all, and since Sharif doesn't know
the principles in this matter, I see little need in dignifying or arguing
with him.  A lesson to us all, if Sharif is ignored, eventually he will go
away.

I was basically giving my account of how I perceived things.  But anyone
with half a brain would know my perceptions have little do do with the
overall implications of what happened (as I expected Sharif sees the
obvious, ignorant of the larger issue).

Sharif, if you don't like it, rock it.  Better yet, just go away.

That's pretty much it, since I feel no need to dignify him further with retort.

If you ever have a problem with htis, er, person, just go and take a dump.
It acts as the perfect catharsis! ;)

Out,
John

<snip> sharif's ignorant commentary on an event he wasn't even there to
witness.

One thing more:
It is obvious that your commentary is of little value to me and as usual is
lined with malice.  The only thing that doesn't match reality is you, and
the only thing you really tend to do is piss people off.  Go and troll for
someone who cares.  I am not one of those people.

Bye now, you've been dismissed.

Oh, why pray tell? Do you know John Lee? Have you met him personally?

Well as I have said I've been going out a long time and the incident is
suspicious at best. Also due to the experiences that I myself had at the club.

Yes as a matter of fact a tally was taken John was the only one ejected
that evening.

Well you were obviously not there. I was there and I was observing John for
most of the night. As he or anyone else who knows me can tell you, I won't
slant things just because my friends did them. John was tipsy but so was
about 25% of the people in that party. Stompy crowd is known for "having a
good bar" It's one of the reason's Preston can get venues so easily. Was
John out of control? Emphantically not, I did not see any belligerent
behavior on his part, in fact some people ran to get me when it happened
because they thought it was uncalled for.

Yeah, but what did he do that pissed off the wrong guy? All I saw JSL do
was hug on a bunch of girls (Including his own) what is the crime in that?

VSF DOES have a problem with their security, whether they are racist or
just doing too many 'roids or the substances that they are confiscating is
unclear but other people sense that something is wrong as well.


Maybe you should do a little investigation before you speak about things
that you do not know.

And why is that?  Just becasue *I* had (admitedly) had too much too drink
does not mean that John had.  I was there and John was not as messed up as
MANY others in attendance.  Ever been to a Stompy?  The attendees generally
tend to take things to record levels of intoxication.  John, unlike many
others, was in control of himself.

In the 3+ years I have know John, I have heard and participated in many
discussions with him regarding race.  (It is an important topic which
people shy away from for any number of reasons.)  But regardless of how
much John *talks about* race, this is the one and only time I have ever
known him to accuse anyone of having racially charged motives.  It is not
something he takes lightly and would not falsely accuse it if he did not
have VERY good reason.  Having been present at the time, I must agree that
there *was* VERY good reason.  And don't try to say that I was drunk and my
opinion should be dismissed.  Just casue I was swaying doesn't mean I was
blind.

John WAS NOT ripped.  You can ask any of the 100+ of our closest friends
who were there (one of which, you are not) and saw him NOT being ripped or
doing any of the things he was accussed of.  Thanks anyway for the opinion,
Andy.  Next time keep it to yourself unless you know what you're talking
about.

By the way, sometimes proof is not necessary to feel that something is
true.  People can say all kinds of things to deflect from their true
motives, especially when that motive is not socially acceptable.  And even
if their motive was not racial, it does not change the fact that John was
ejected from the club for things he DID NOT DO.

Actually, he spoke with Preston about it who DID get a tally from security.
Nuff said.

Even if John had been stumbling & bumping (which, again, he WAS NOT) it
doesn't excuse the fact that he was singled out.  Last time I checked,
dealing drugs was illegal.  But I guess its not when security has something
to gain from the dealers being there, like coming up on some treats, maybe?

See my comments above about proof.  Not all things are proven.  Doesn't
mean they cease to be true.

Hello beautiful people!

Just wanted to warn y'all ;) that I'm back on the list, and
somewhat back in the scene!  My first party since the
Harmony Massive was a Viberation party in Berkeley,
where Greg Sandler did some rather bizarre things on
the turntables (hehe!), and AndyW really outdid himself,
in this man's opinion (where's the mix tape, Andy?)...

Love and peace to all, and I hope to see ya at a party soon!!!

OKEE...time to add a few more pennies to the pot...

Age is really just a nember...how many people do you know that ACT
their age?  Is the number of years you've been on this planet a true
measure of maturity, ability, intelligence, and matters of legal
convenience?  For some, their time to enjoy life could very well be
limited...and who is to say they cannot be as mature as one who is 20
or 30 at the age of 16?  I agree that in MOST cases, age does play an
important role in determining how OLD someone is, but one that I have
learned from the scene is the elimination of our stereotypes and
preconcieved notions.  For every rule there is always an exception. 
Just LuV each other...even if it is against the law!  ;^)
Take care...sNIKers ;^)

I was at a really wild party on 9th and folsom last
night throwrn at the Salon-anon.  The Djs were
spinning some really fresh (sorry that was only word
I could come up with) music.  One cut sounded like it
had a Greedo sample.

Any sf ravers there? if so did you hear the cut I was
talking about.

The only downside was that the system put out a
painful high-end- other than that it was a blast.

well kids,my faith in the scene has returned...slightly. Last nite i had
the best time at a party in such a long time. Great music great
people...perfect. Sean murray went off as always and the tag team set
between reach and jeff taisch was devine. Green velvets track awnsering
machine was played by jeff and i nearly lost my mind. Fuckin great track...
Ne ways i have an overwhelming desire to start throwing parties again after
last nite and i think i just might so be on the look out...also if  anyof u
just dont want to go to the gathering on the 20th of december there is a
party called revival where i will be making my debut on the main floor
playing house. I think this will be a small intamite gathering and it
should be fun. Also i need all the support i can get. The party is 10 bucks
and i would love to see all yall there umm peas out,moshe

Hello everyone,

My vinyl archiving on to CD days are still in continuation. 
I'm unshaven, tired, gnarly, but dedicated to finishing. It's funny how much
longer songs seem to be when I have to let them play all the way through. I've
had some of these songs for almost 8 years and never heard the whole song!
(I'm like, "wow, that was pretty cool, shoulda let that one play through,
man..." :)   

Anyway, does anyone know what type of music "Handbag House" is?
What typifies this genre? Been reading about it in some of these U.K. mags,
but I don't have a frame reference. Is it an attitude or a style of music like
Speed Garage?

Thanks,

rob.

Nope. Wasn't there. My earlier msg did state that it was based solely on
JSL's post. If you post something here, expect followups.

Absolutely! Suspicious at best. It should have left at that.

My apologies. I guess JSL was the only one. The whole thing is more suspicious
now.

Why is everybody focusing on JSL and the women? I'm sure he was not hugging
them constantly while he was there. I'm sure he was doing many more things.
There are three sides to every story. We have heard one here.

Yeah, I was talking about the problem VSF sec allegedly has w/ people of
color.

If you post here, expect a response. Don't expect to agree with it.

As we were driving to Oakland last night to Byroni's
b-day (which I hope he enjoyed thoroughly)  my friend
was relaying a story about a party that she was at
where this guy kept starring at her.  Finally, she
went over to him and said "look, do I know you?"
his response was "no, but I wish I did."

The point of the story was that this was the worst
pickup line that she had ever heard.  Of course I'm
thinking- god I could seem myself saying something
like that.

So I was wondering br you boy or girl straight or gay.

A. have you ever been hit on at a party(rave).
B. What was your favorite pickup line, the best or
worst one that you ever heard.

indulge my craving for gossip.

My my my...where do I start?  Well, as I said, this was my first
Sacramento part*E*, and I was pleased with the scene they have uo
there.  We got to the part*E* relatively late, (around 2), but it
didn't matter because the part*E* went till 8 in da morn!  Plus, it
was free with a Toy Donation, (I personally gave one of those cute
lil' doggies from teh 101 Damations..heheh...his name was Dipstick!),
and all of the toys went to Charity, so kidZ could have a good
Christmas.  I don't think I have ever felt more satisfied going to a
part*E*, because we KNEW that a child would get what we gave
them...kind of a nice, happy feeling, actually benifitting a good
cause directly.
  ON to the part*E*.  THe music was progressive house, and of decent
quality, although a bit slow for my taste.  There were a good amount
in that one roomed warehouse, and not many were dancing, and there
were circles...to my slight dipleasure.  As the night progressed, many
flocked out while the hardKore kidZ stayed and danced the night
away...the music seemed to intensify as the night went on, by the 2nd
to the last DJ, they actually spun a trance record! (YAY!)  We danced
and danced and danced...met quite a few of those "valley" kidZ, (they
are pretty darn kewl, if ya just talk to them!), and danced somemore. 
Leaving the part*E* well spent, and with visions of a kidZ Christmas
being jsut a little bit brighter because of us left us with warm
fuzzies.
  Overall, the scene, (for those of you that haven't experienced it),
is sort of a cross between a SF Underground and an Oakland   One Room
wonder.  Maybe because we arrived late, but I didn't get any of those
pushy people tryiing to sell me Vitamins and materials for a chemistry
lab.  The *few* kand*E* kidZ i met were ULTRA kewl, and jsut about
everyone had a decent vibe emitting from them.  I can't say that I am
going to flock to Sacramento for every part*E* they throw in the
future, but I sure wouldn't mind going to a part*E* or two every once
in a whiel!

For all you SACRAMENTO KIDZ....THANX for making me feel welcome!

PLUR, HugZ, and LuV,
sNIKers ;^*

Well, I was hit on at a party one time by someone who I will not mention by
name since some of you probably know him.  It was really weird.  While I
was dancing (had been for hours, in the same spot) I noticed that someone
was sitting up on a speaker above me.  It didn't occur to me that he was
watching me or anything but I guess he had been because right when the
music stopped he jumped down and made a bee line towards me.  He proceeded
to get down on his knees and then  asked me to send him my prayers and all
this stuff.  He, at the time, didn't want to tell me his name and said I
could make up a name for him cause he had made up a anme for me: Bubble
Girl.  Okaaaaay...  I thought the guy was just on some good shit that
night, so I humored him, ended the conversation and went home.  Didn't
think too much about it again.

That is until I saw him at again @ Home Base a couple of weeks later.  He
was lurking around me and staring at me where ever I was.  I mean, how esay
is it to keep track of someone @ Home Base?  He had to have been following
me around the entire time.  Dude was persistant and it was starting to
freak me out.  He finally cought me off gaurd and said some weird shit to
me and I just told him that he was making me feel uncomfortable and I
wanted him to leave me alone.  I was still a bit shaken when I left the
party but kind of thought this was the end of it.

That is until I got a call from my friend Tim who told me that this guy had
come to his house.  (Tim doesn't even know the guy but he had obviously
been doing his homework and knew that Tim was close to me.  Getting
weirder, huh?)  He gave Tim a letter to give to me.  Tim gets the letter
over to me and I read it.  Okay - this is going too far.  He felt the need
to go into all this personal shit, telling me about his social and personal
problems and inability to express himself to girls who he has crushes on.
As much as the letter made me uncomfortable, I felt bad for the guy.  I
didn't know what to do so I did nothing.  Hoped he would leave me alone and
this would be over.

It pretty much ended there until I, shortly there after, I hooked up with
my beloved John S. Lee.  John thought I was being too soft on the guy by
not taking any action.  The more I talked to John about it, I had to admit
that he was right.  I didn't want to admit that the situation was really
sketchy.  I was naieve in beliving that this guy's affections were
innocent.  I should have gone with my instincs and been more aggressive in
my effort to get this monkey off my back.

My point?  Don't underestimate people who make you feel uncomfortable.
Follow your instincts and make yourslef clear if you don't wish to be
cantacted further.  Just because someone is a raver, does not mean that
they are incapable of doing something that could really hurt another
person.

Secondly, I DO NOT advise use of these tactics if you want to meet someone
at a party.  Just go up and say hello.  Or better yet, just dance by them
and see if there is any connection.  the worst that can happen is you make
a new dance floor friend!  It you can't get it together enough to do that
in a saine manner, you're better off leaving the person alone.

Sorry for the rambling story, but hey... you asked. ;)

No don't be sorry this exactly the kinds of anecdotes
that I wanted. :)
Sorry to hear about the stalker-that is definitely
beyond the scope of mere flirting.

I agree.  
but you have to admit some people do outrageously
silly stuff to meet people

Hiya,

Cool. I kinda thought that it would be a reference to outrageously commercial
house that was over the top in attitude (in music and attire).
I couldn't be sure though. You know what assumptions do... ;)
I'm making a mix CD of stuff and some of it is really fun (but kinda hard)
house, so I wasn't sure if I should name it with a reference to handbag.

hmmmmm, I guess I'll think about it for awhile longer....

Thanks,

rob.

Hi everybody!!  Just a little "what's up?" from little ol george who's
been snowboarding the past week in heaven.  nothing like waking up in
the morning and listening to the snow falling.  shhh....   :)

So I'm teaching kids how to ride at heavenly, and maybe even some of you
sfravers, if you like :).  Spending the winter up there, I won't be doing
much ravin'.  I'm keeping my ears and eyes open for parties and what not,
and if any of you have any recommendations or contacts let me know.  i'm
also lookin' for some Err, connections, rr.  ;o)  

As for the sfraves snowfeverfest, there are several members up there who
i'll be contacting. (hi JiL, laksmi ;), theresa)

And to all of you other wonderful peeps that I've met through the course
of my ravin days in the south bay, here's a BIG hug to you; mw, byroni,
fish, sol, maya, doreen, lara, lisa, blzo, jer, slinky boy, amber, jacup,
paul, hai, mike, harald, noah, phil and all the rests of you, I'll be
thinking of you when i'm floating on freshie.  Singing out until I find a
new ISP in Tahoe... peace love and all that jovial stuff.  you guys can
still email at gchan@best.com.

hibernating monkey,
george

Gang (Posse, Crew, Pack, Troop, Party, Mob, etc.),

I just picked up the new MixMag (U.K. Version) and it comes with a free Mix
CD. It's called "House Puts the Breaks On".

I popped it in to hear what kinda commercial stuff they were trying to
promote, but ohhhhhh, how I was mistaken in labeling it unfairly. (still
promotion, buuutttt....)

It is an amazing collection of complex house grooves with a disco root, some
well-used old skool electro drops, exciting sexy downtempo grooves (later
half), and phenomenal mixing. 

Here are some of the groups:

Assassins of Sound
Genetica
Superstars of Rock
OST
Palefield Mountain
Manitou
Desert
Innerself
Almighty Beatfreakz

That Brit pack, DAMN! =:0

I recommend it highly due to it only costing about 6 bucks (w/ cheesy magazine
if you can stomach it!).

rob.
http://www.citizenmag.com

p.s. I recommend this depressingly though only because I'm in the middle of my
mix creation and I'm kinda wowed by their stuff....NO MATTER THOUGH! I WILL
CONTINUE DESPITE .... HOW ....GREAT ....THE ...... ODDS ....SEEM!

I've never been to a Happy Kids rave that wasn't the bomb.  Marty and
Jason know what they are doing and know how to have fun.

I know a person who smoked out and a week later after just drinking a ton
of cranberry juice passed a piss test.

Nothing to be sorry about James; it needed to be said. I'm sorry Lara, but
that was an incredibly sexist remark. It takes two to tango (or fuck.) A
women's actions in initiating, and engaging in sex (or anything else) are
just as important as a man's. Not mentioning women's participation is
equivalent to dismissing women as unimportant. Regardless of what the
dominant culture would have us believe, nice girls get horny, like to fuck,
and seek out people to fuck.

The 4th annual 24 Hour Solstice Music Marathon will be held at Internet
Alfredo
(7th and Brannan). On December the 21st. It will actually take place
Starting at
12:01 AM and go till 11:59 PM Sunday night. This year the event will be
cybercast in RealAudio so folks all over the world should be able to hear
it.  In addition Internet Alfredo will be open for the entire event, a $6
day pass will let you come down. hang out and surf on their T1 while the
event is going on. Internet Alfredo is small, it holds about 100 people so
this isn't a full on party, there will be a small dance floor and the
espresso bar will be open for business, we'll probably have some holiday
snacks as well. The DJ Line up is as follows:

Astral Matrix			Matty B.	
Carlos				Markie Mark		
Ethan				Preston
Felix the Dogg			Spun
Galen				Sub-Cmdr. Lycos
Jeno					Tracy
Jerry Bonham			Troy TranceHall
La Ron				UnKnown

This list is not in Order and is subject to change. For further information
set your browsers to  

				http://www.cybertribe.com
				voice mail (415)541-5632
What you should bring:

			Good Vibes
			Your old Luv Phaser (for reconditioning and reattunement)
			Holiday goodies to share (We will provide free wather,fruit, and
			Punch)
			Interesting objects to place on the Yule Altar

P.S. If anyone has a leed on where we can get an FM transmitter so that we
can broadcast the event in SF so folks with radios can hear it let us know.
We intend to have two feeds, a 28.8 feed for folks who just have computers
in their homes and a 88k stereo high quality feed for folks who have ISDN
or have access to DS1 or above. The 88k feed will be suitable for recording.

If you want to help in any way:

*We need a small sound system amp,PA, (we have turntables and mixers)
*FM transmitter
*Security/crowd control
*Net geeks to help with the cybercast

About 4 years ago I was a club in downtown LA, a benefit party for Malachy
attended by and thrown by folks from SF.  Around 5am I'm in the upstairs
dance room, absolutely parched (no drinking fountains, no water being
sold), and I see a guy standing at the bar pouring a glass of water for
himself from the bar's tap.  He motions to me, I say, sure!  I pour myself
a glass and a security guard freaks and throws me out of the club, without
giving me a chance to tell the various folks I came with about the
situation.  There were at least two others who had also done it, it was
WATER, and the guard refused to stop when I demanded to speak to the
promoters and club owner (by name).  Whether he was black or white or
purple I can't recall.  Lesson?  Most security is spotty when it comes to
enforcement of any particular law (save for checking ID's at the door),
once they've decided to do something there's really nothing that will stop
them, and trying to point to an incident and calling it a trend is a, well,
stretch.  Not to say your allegations aren't true, not to say there isn't a
racial bias on the part of security there, but it's just a stretch.  Know
of any non-white security guards at VSF?  If so, what would they say,
confidentially?  If not, that's significant itself.

I eventually got back in and spend the rest of the night out of plain sight. 

	Brian

Agreed, I was not calling it a trend however, I was calling it an incident.
However if others corroborate, then it is definitely a trend.

To my knowledge there are none.

I am currently trying to find out as much as I can about VSF.  What I do
know, to date, is that there are no security guards of color.  I know they
do a hip-hop thang on Wednesdays (the patrons would not like to hear of the
"choosiness" of some of the security @ VSF).

>  If not, that's significant itself.

Perhaps.  All options are open at this point.

>

Unfortunately I did not have that option.  Suffice it to say it was not the
fun ride home, and could have been far worse. ;(

(VSF IMO SUX)

Much peace and thanks for the comments and sharing the experiences.

Security sux at plenty of places.  Funny though that in the 7+ years of
raving, this was the first time I was ejected from a club.  Weird.  Also of
note, I've been way loopy , far more so in the past (8-10 beers, and plenty
of mind altering stuff making my head float).  This time, except for the
booze (5 beers), I was straight.  THAT is what is bugging me so.

Oh well, as Ice Cube said, this ain't over.  It has just begun.

Yea, the nerve of some ravErs.
=]:..

 I have never had any girls come up to me once at a ravE and tell me I look
hot. Maybe I need to start working out at the tanning salon, I don't know.
 I always see homie G's puting on the moves. I remember long ago at an
Oak50 ravE. This homie goes up to this break dancing chick and says
something like, "Hey baby, want me to show you a real good time?" She looks
at him and says, "You best go check yourself" And the look on his face, it
was like he wanted to put a cap in her ass or something.
 We ended up having to leave early. Luciana smoked weed for the first time
that night and wasn't feeling so hot. It was funny, every guy with pot that
night tryed to get up on Lucy, so she was really stoned. My friend Tim
earlier that night said, "I'm kicking it with Luciana for now on. Doods are
coming up left and right wanting to get us high".

 Alright. That memory has passed.
 I need to wake up now.

Hey bro, where have you been, in the stone ages?  You should stop smoking
that pot and take some real stuff... then get on the dance floor and show
your stuff... then maybe you'll have better luck

I just got to reply to this really quick..

 It's funny you say that. Cause when I first started raving, you know...When no
one noticed me.. I DID NOT smoke weed. The first time my dance turned heads at
FUSION, was the first time I smoked pot at a ravE! And damnit to hell if THAT
ain't enough to make you go back to your pot head ways.
 Before, I never smoked weed at social gathering because it made me too shy. But
that night, I just felt like "what the hay" and I fired it up. And thoughs
phycho bitches and miss thing DJ's were tearing it up that night! And I didn't
stop dancing for 4 hours, and when I stopped, it was like everyone was looking
at me funny. =]:..
 I swear to GOD, thoughs four hours I was in a black out or something.

Asfar as my luck goes. I gave up on a cure for it long before I gave up on the
ravE scene.

 Peace in your hood homie G.
Jeff

No, I have no clue where to get an FM transmitter, that's why I'm writing
this. I have no clue at all where to start looking for one of these or how
to learn, I am asking anyone who knows anything about this to help me out a
bit? I think that Napa needs a good pirate radio station, and I think I
would have a blast doing it. So, if anyone could help me out PULEEZ let me
know, thanks.

san francisco's original TOONTOWN has returned with veteran producers of
COME-UNITY & BASICS (of The Gathering), also in the same house: BY THE PEOPLE,
SUNSET/PACIFIC SOUNDSYSTEM, OTHER RECORDS UK, STEP 2K, & LOVEWORKS. gathering
top talent from around the world, along with it support from WIRED magazine,

on the underground scene in the bay area.  we hope to re-create a space that
inspires participants to be creative and implement that creativity into new
ways of social thinking.  through the combination of fierce house music,
technology, interactive environments and diverse media we believe these goals
can be achieved, both on the night of the event and in the long term.

while creating a whopping, walloping, wailing, wacking, slaping, lolloping,
thumping, thundering, throbbing, bumping dance environment.

One thing that really annoyed me last week at Stompy...I was upstairs 
hangin out and the secrurity were totally hawkin everyone like prison guards.
One of them walked up to a dude who had no shirt on and made him put it 
back on!  It really bugged me, Stompy is one of the best parties left at 
a time when good parties are few indeed. It's a sad thing to happen at a 
very special party. It would be nice to be able to 
experss yourself as long as your not hurting someone, without being 
afraid of security. Is not having a shirt on a fuckin crime?  Did anyone 
see last New Years day when they kicked that English dude(Ramo?) out?
I dont think the people who throw Stopmy are to blame, I guess for some 
economic reason(insurance) the **Owner** thinks hardcore security is needed.

One last thing..Does anyone REALLY think security at Stompy is needed?  
I dont.

Storpis-

Conversely, you have no proof either. I think John made it clear that he is
trying to make sense of what happened that evening by exploring all the
possible explanations for his ejection. Have you ever been to a Stompy? I
mean, 8 out of 10 people at those parties are usually gurning their asses off,
bumping into and tripping onto one another, having sex with each other, you
name it, I've 
witnessed it at Stompy. 

 I don't know what happened. John doesnt even really know, but it happened to
him. I have no real idea if the issue of race is a factor here, but we
shouldnt ignore it either. In addition to "Roid Rage."

i got home kinda early this morning, about 3:00 in the morning
and i turned on the radio to live 105 to hear live from the maritime
hall  No U-Turn - Nico Fierce .
it was pretty dope.  it really tripped me out because i totally wasn't 
expecting to hear that..it was pretty good, nice and dark...made me 
kind of wish i was there...but it was even better because i was in the 
comfort of my own couch. ;)
was anybody there?  how was the rest of it?

ok ok ok jeez for fuck's sake i'm so sorry.

for you super-sensitive types, let me rephrase my one-liner so that i do
not offend anyone..


one can also keep their thoughts off of sex.
they can keep their legs closed, or their penis in their pants.

satisfed?
i wasn't lashing out against men.
you people are so damn picky.

haha yea! how about the guys who have no pickup line at all and just
automatically assume you want them?

they just come up and throw you up against a wall and try to slobber all
over you.
but they think  it's kissing.
haha a nice swift kick in the head should suffice ;)
no but seriously. some people don't even USE words. assholes.

I noticed something interesting this weekend having to do with this
subject.

 I went out with my friend for 10 years, Brian. He hasn't gotten out much
the last three year's, but he is now single again and going out. Hmmm,
single = going out? New concept.
 Anyways. He is not what someone might call shy. But I beg to differ now
after actually observing his technical charm strategies. I have come to
find out, he is pretty much as shy as,, well,, me for instance.
 When a girl looks at him, all he can do is talk about it, not act on it.
Yea, what I noticed is, he actually only goes up to the ladies when their
NOT looking at him. Every girl he talked to Friday night, he had to tap
them on their shoulder to get their attention. He will not approach a girl
if their "checking him out"
 I need to still confront him on it, I wonder if he knows that's what he
does. Hmm.

Anyways. I thought that might be enlightening to some people.
 Awareness sure can be a hold up..

Night,

sunday night finds me putting together the J-card for my first tape mixed
by my secret alter ego, DJ 725 (oh well, not so secret anymore).  suddenly,
i realize that one of the tracks on the tape bears no identifying marks.  i
want to give credit to all the artists on the tape if possible--not to
mention i need to re-purchase the track 'cause the record has gone missing :(

so.

if any of you know the title, artist, label, whatever of a track that

--begins as a trance track with lush melodic synth lines

--starts getting more electro and adds a sped-up vocal sample that sounds
like "gimme, gimme support"

--music stops and a vocal sample of "gimme a motherfuckin' breakbeat" kicks
in the music again

--drumline changes to breakbeat and the same lush synth lines come back in

--then i would love to know what it's called.

ANYONE WHO wants a tape can send me their snailmail address and expect to
receive one shortly.  your conception of "shortly" and mine may vary, of
course.

To answer Mark Piercy's question last: let's get the real downtown low down
from Geoff White (hi Geoff :) because this is a point he has made often
in the past: there is a very tight relationship between clubs and police
in SOMA.  The relationship bleeds green, in some instances, but even more,
it is a matter of information flow and people control.  Bouncers behave
as they do because, beyond the usual correct observations about what
a tough job it is, they are *allowed* and *encouraged* to do so.

Your Honor, may the People present three exhibits well known to the
assembled jury:

1.  Trocadero.
2.  Sound Factory.
3.  174 King Street.

I want to mention the third specifically, since I among others was
subject to random harassment there over the years by "security," who
were *not* the same as those at the adjoining 177 Townsend (who are
tough but fair -- they let you know they are there, they are in charge,
and then they stay out of the way).  King Street, at certain times in
the past, epitomized what the rave scene in SF was all about -- when
we were good, we were very very good, and when we were bad, we got
down with the cosmic funk.  But as the years went on, the security
presence put a severe damper on the scene there.  Not that people were
out of hand or anything, it was a pure rent-a-cop trip.  It got to
the point where Wicked had the Hon. Geoff White presiding at the door
in order to keep things on an even keel.  

I have no doubt that John's report from the VSF is, on the whole,
accurate.  I even detect a certain embarassment at losing it a bit,
the kind of embarassment we've all felt I think.  But beyond that,
given the corroborating evidence and the personal experience I have
with VSF (my last Stompy was New Year's Day, where at least half the
crowd was probably not in any shape to drive :-), this is a very serious
matter.  What it may reflect is that even the relatively low-key places
like VSF are being stressed somehow.  Running a club is no picnic, but
you have to know that the owners are well aware of their responsibility
*and* their control, and if the bouncers behave a certain way, whatever
that way may be, you can be sure it reflects the true desire of the
management because, in fact, if you don't like one bouncer there are
others waiting in line for the gig.  Consider Ira's record at 1015.
In the many years I've gone there and heard about events there, I can't
recall one single untoward incident at the door other than fools being
shown the way out if they were being exceptionally foolish.  For all
the issues we have over how Ira runs his show, this much is clear: the
customer is important enough to management that the customer gets
respect, and that includes the door presence.

I have my issues about how Preston runs his show, too, but spaces are
scarce and there have been some really good Stompys at VSF.  All the
same, knowing the man as I do, jsl's story will become an important
data point in dealing with VSF now and in the future.  And furthermore,
now that we have been alerted, it will be quite clear that if this
incident is indicative of a real pattern, Stompy at VSF will be history.

peace out 
phred

The People's Park People (R. + F.S.) want to thank everyone for their
good intentions on making it to the  park on Sunday.  Unfortunately,
Miss Rain, she done us wrong.
This only gets us more excited for the Spring, and we are very excited
at our next attempt at blending our world from Down South with
everyone up here.
We are thinking maybe April/May!?!

Let us know what you think, if you have any ideas, suggestions,
comments, etc.

Until then,

 you all soo good,
 

                     R. + F.S.

-->	Okay, in case you didn't know, I am most definitely back and will
be around for the next few months :)
	First off, my maiden return party was at Byroni's yesterday and I
had a wonderful time and met all you peeps:

*hugs*
Elisabeth & Jandreas (J'n'da'B hashed browns ;)
Jake Loco
Guy
Rusty (Jungle & Reno; what else is there?)
Baby Huey (I've met you before....)
Messiah
Mister E
Natasha (aka CalChemist)
Rob
Zoe's SO (forgot your name, but thanx for the tour)
Pengo
Drekster (so toasted you should've been an appliance)
Byron (smashin' pahty luv)

...and all the others I've forgotten and hey Rubilicous, I liked your
moves but was too shy to say hi--maybe next time :) I know y'all have real
names, but it takes me awhile to relearn them all after the list
identities have gotten into my head.

	Okay, now for the NRR ocean thing...since September I was with a
class in Tahiti and only got back last Sunday.  I was doing scientific
research with a marine alga, gastropods, and succession; talk about
exciting fun (for Cal students it's cross listed as IB 158, Geog. 142,
and IDS somethin'). I have one week to prepare my research paper for
ridicule and hopeful publication, but no matter what, I get semester
credit for the class :)  I had a brilliant time (and pics) on the islands
and even managed to survive cyclone Osea in a Bora-Boran warehouse. The
downside was having to live with some very non PLURy ppls in close
quarters for months and not having adequate rave access during the
weekends.  Polynesians are wonderful (as people and as eye candy) and
_definitely_ know how to have a good time. Lesse, rats and cockroaches
will rule the world, and when on Tahiti do not assume that all women were
born that way. If any of you are heading that way, I can give some more
info--there is an occassional techno night at a place I know. Well, all
and all, this city BuddahFlye is glad to be out of hibernation and back to
civilization.

:)

  Not even close to being rave-related, but twisted and funny. Flash

they're pretty big downloads, tho I'm not sure, and 2) make sure you find
the episode with the dancing dog shits. :-)

not all ravers are heterosexual =) *grin*

However, I think she was making a joke, and I did laugh!

Are you serious? Girls get horny? I thought that was just in the movies.

shit.   one time i was at a party and my man Jeff was tearing it up so
hard, he started glowing  like the time machine in "Contact", so I said
"Damn!"  and jumped into the big glowing
ball of light.

I got sucked into a wormhole and ended up on the other side of the
universe, where an alien dressed like my Dad told me he basically had no
more information about Existence than we do,  even though he (the alien)
was one of the wiseguys who drew the blueprints for this Dancing Time
Machine that is called Jeff Nstuff.

You know, I have in the past, been over sensitive, and quick to take
offense, but this ain't one of those times. NEways calling someone
sensitive is a cop out. I don't buy it here anymore than I would in a far
more extreme case, where for example a man might say "Sorry babe, all I
said was 'nice tits' it's a compliment, don't be so sensitive."

>one can also keep their thoughts off of sex.

Yeah right like that's possible, or desirable. ROTFL.

>
>satisfed?

With the rewrite yeah, but...

>i wasn't lashing out against men.

Um????? You're confusing me. I don't recall anyone saying anything about
your lashing out against men. All I mentioned was your ignoring women. Not
mentioning women, and the importance of the things that women do, is one
the most common, and insidious forms of sexism. We've all read those old
(and not so old) history books that talk about "mankind" and stuff like
"when man discovered fire." By not mentioning women's participation in sex
you belittle women's sexuality. Thank the deities that we in our culture,
do not as some other cultures do, stifle our girls sexuality by surgical
means. However, little by little mainstream US culture sends girls message
after message throughout their youth, and on in to womanhood. Over time
these messages manifest themselves as internalized oppression. Internalized
oppression is when an oppressed group, in this case girls and women,
through years of conditioning begins to believe, and live the lies of the
oppressors, often to the point of helping to perpetuate those lies.

OK this is getting way to NRR. Damn, where's a "Your Sister's House"
discussion group when you need one?

>you people are so damn picky.

If it was just you and me talking, I wouldn't trip. But when someone drops
sexism, subtly or overtly, deliberately or accidentally, on a list that's
read by many girls, some of whom I know and love, yeah you're damn right
I'm picky.

I suggest this, rather than the latter.

I will be dancing with my lady and I will take a break
and sit down, not two seconds later there will be the
hoovering idiots dancing next to her staring at her
and it freaks her out. I am sure other ladies will
agree this gets annoying. Its like because your dancing
alone you are automatically available to be gawked at.


Your points are deffinately important Megan, don't be
naive folks it could cost you more than embarrassment.

Subject: VSF & Stompy, my lawyer speaks.
Sender: sfraves-owner@hyperreal.org
Precedence: bulk

Oh boy, geez.

I hope that I've given people something to think about.  However my battel
with VSF will have to be on the public relations tip as it certainly will
not end up in court.

After talking to my attorney about this matter there is little I can do
*legally* to hurt VSF.  As far as the law in concerned, VSF is a private
club.  They made a determinitaion that I was drunk, and they ejected me for
said reason.  Since this is not a civic establishment (i.e. a public park,
courthouse, etc.), they can pretty much do whatever they wish.  They can
exclude or expel people for whatever reason they choose.  Ouch.  If they
have a "hard on" for you for *whatever* reason, it can be grounds for
dismissal.

Since I was not harmed physically, just emotionally (which btw must
manifest itself in the physical realm), there is nothing I can do.  Case
closed (not really).

I am going to write my experiences in a popular magazine and warn others of
my plight.  But for all intents and purposes, this fight, a fight about
principles won;t be done in the courts.  At least it saves me and the
taxpayers some money.  Besides I can suffer a little embarassment (hey, it
wasn't like Stompy 1996! ;)
).

I just want to give these closing words and thoughts on VSF & Stompy.

Stompy Stomp, as long as it is held @ VSF, has a serious problem with
security.  They are confiscating drugs and using them, they are throwing
out black patrons (male) who mingle with females who are not black, they
are looking for people to use substances.  this means that if you're
passing something from one person to another, even a paper, they can eject
you.  VSF is unfriendly to the rave community, and the only reason that
anyone would continue to have a party there is because they don't care
about their patrons and only care about the $$$'s made in a city where good
events are becoming increasingly difficult to find.
The only real solace I have is that I was guest listed and didn;t have to
pay.  Maybe the next person who is ejected won't be so lucky and after
having paid $15 (I beleive the new years price), you too could find
yourself ejected from the party @ VSF for trumped up and vague reasons.

For my brothers and sisters of color, beware.  If you have drink one, or
bump into anyone you might as well count the minutes before they toss you
out.

I am a man of integrity if nothing else.  If I was throwing a party and one
of my friends was mistreated, I would do everything in my power to right
the wrong.  It is obvious, and I am not naieve to this, that this is not
how others live their lives.  I do.  I will not step foot one, or encourage
people to step foot one into any event @ VSF.  They do not want people of
color at their club and I don't wish to be in a place where I am not
wanted.  I hope other people of color feel the same (one must wonder since
Preston has been made aware of this, what effect this will have on a party
that he himself has called "too vanilla".  I wonder now if he was sincere
at all...I think not).

To Stompy & Preston:  Good luck, but remember one is judged by the company
one keeps.  The $ is a strong device and only those who master it can rule
it, less it rule them as in the case here.  If you're all about diversity,
and all about *people* having a good time, one can only wonder *why* you
chose a club that practices racial exclusion to achieve your goal.  I can
only hope that entire crew wakes up and smells the coffee.  I do think
however that they would rather be lulled into a deep house sleep with the
$'s their making at that venue.  I don't go to klan rallies, and I will
never set foot at any party that has its event at VSF.  Now go on and keep
making that money.  After all, that is what this is all about, right?

VSF:  You suck.  I'll never set foot in your prejudiced club again.  You
and your high school security guards with severly handicapped commmand of
the King's English can take your former sex club and stuff it.  Flava '98.

SFRAVES:  Thank you all for your kinds words and support since I've come
out about this.  I am still gathering data to hand to P-dog (as if he'll
care) when I see him next (whenever that is).  You guys rule and you all
rock!  Much love and peace during a small tumult!  After all the words back
and forth it is good to know that I have made a few friends here on the
list.  Much love and much respect to you all.  It certainly seems that this
place has, at least, kept the last part of the spirit once found at raves
everywhere.  Keep it alive and keep it real!  Thanks again!  Much love! :)

PEACE,
John

P.S.  The fight remains, but I'm onto better things.  I guess that means my
clubbing is now restricted to: "Abstract Soul" & "Wicked". :)  Hey, at
least I still have two parties on my list! :)

Hi there SFRavers,
		  I'm going to be in the Bay area around Xmas/New Years.
I would like to get in contact with some party people to give me the low
down on the place and recommend where to go. The SFRaves calendar is not
that useful because I'm not sure what styles the DJs spin, what vibe to
expect at the different venues etc. Down here we've only heard of Mark
Farina and Jeno(whose CD is wicked!). I'm sure there's much more worth
checking out (like the Jungle and Ambient parties?). I'll be staying in
Rohnert Park, which I'm told is a fair distance from the city.
PLUR,

Aaron

Are you serious?  I have tried to follow this thread (although I admit to
only briefing through a few of these posts) and it seems to me that you
have nothing to back up your claims here.  I don't know how much you had to
drink, but  just because the security decided that you appeared out of
control, is that reason to make it your mission to circulate rumors and
misrepresentations about the club? A claim of throwing out black patrons?
This didn't happen, at least from what I have read... and there are black
men on the security at VSF... there was at least one at that Stompy.  The
security may get over anxious in confiscating pipes, but at a Stompy three
months ago they took one from my friend and at the end of the night they
gave all the pipes back to people who came and asked for them.   
It seems as though this has hurt your pride and you are now looking for
some sort of revenge.  Just make sure that this is justified and based on

Yup...

The best line I've been handed wasn't even verbal.  A few weeks ago at Love, I was walking around upstairs, (it was at Big Heart City) looking for my friends, and I made eye contact with a cutie as I searched the corners... The next time I came through the hallway she stood up in front of me, with an evil grin on her face.  I side stepped to the left, she side stepped in front of me, I stepped back to the right, she matched me again.  Then she stepped right up to me and kissed me... not one of those little hi how are you pecks either... Talk about the direct approach.

Now for the serious part of this thread... Whenever I see some creep trying to push himself on a helplessly intoXicated girl, it makes me wonder about the validity of our scene.  Maybe it's because I'm not the kind of person who can walk away and ignore that kind of situation, but that should not be tolerated.  

Pointing out the obvious...

I'm with you all the way John. Damn, I was just thinking that I should
start going to Stompy, in hopes of meeting some grown up ravers, but there
is no way that I'm setting foot in VSF. My folks were involed in SNCC and
Core back in the day, and they sure as hell didn't raise me to suport
racist assholes.

If anyone would like to make some extra $, I need a bartender for a 
party I'm catering on Saturday. It's beer, wine & mixed drinks (nothing 
too fancy) and I will pay hourly as well as keeping your tips. It's from 
6 pm until about 11 pm or so, so there's still time to party afterwards. 
I need someone with an engaging and friendly personality as well as 
someone who is honest. Please e me @ 
aurora8@earthlink.net
Also, I want to thank Byroni for the invite. I got to meet many SFRavers 
and I want to say Hi to y'all! Unfortunately time got away from me & I 
realized that I had to go home & work and get a bit of sleep & wake up @ 
8 am and finish. I missed the JUNGLE : (   but I did dance quite a bit 
regardless. 
-TRACY
Byroni... I hope you enjoyed the crunchies!

John,

None of us that were not in attendance are qualified to make a judgement
on what actually occured. I won't even attempt to. 

However, given your own explanation of the story, I find your reasoning
specious, and the jump of "logic" that labels the security racists equally
so. Have you shown that they were assholes? Possibly. That's life. I have
had negative experiences with asshole security at clubs myself. Like you I
have chosen to not attend events at those clubs. 

At no time did you state that the security made *any* derogatory
remarks regarding your race, the race of those around you or your
"inter-mingling" with those of other races. 

I fail to see how this illustrates that action of VSF security was
racially motivated.

About the bartending offer.... YOU can keep the tips. When I read it, it 
sounded like I meant I would be mugging you and confiscating the tips.
I am not a VSF security guard.

Naughty Santa's Biarre Bazaar
Dec. 21st 
3pm till 11pm

I devised Naughty Santa's to be cheap venue for all of our artists friends to be able 
to sell thier goods to US, thier friends. It got out of hand last year, we hosted more 
than 30 artists and over 500 shoppers. This year we expect more than 50 artists to be 
able to fill ALL of your shopping requirements.

We also have wall to wall entertainment. A spectacular Drag Queen show is being 
produced with some of the finest drag queens in the bizness. It is at times like this 
whenn I wish I didnt hype things up so much, because Fennel Skellyman has assembled a 
truly unique cast of Mwomen.

As you all may know we have ripped off the whole Crash Worship shtick complete with 
gallons of chocolate pudding 30 gallons of wine 2 bubble macines, rotten fruit, rotting 
vegetables, choclate syrup. 

Ohhh and Music! we will be covering thier music dressed in Santa drag.

Tiki Times' Otto will be spinning christmas tiki music, Chicken John begged for a 
spot-DJing but oh gosh we seemed to have run out of DJ slots.

 TOPH1 (red wine-XLR8R-Liquid on thursdays) is running a very special FUNK SIDE. 
A  dance culture crafts ghetto. Buy mix tapes, local clothing designers clothes, peruse 
dance zines. 

Scott Beale is doing some video screening. You will be able to sit in theatre seating 
to watch premier underground videos.   You can buy the videos to take home, or give as 
gifts.

Behind that will be a 'quiet' video lounge run by Jose of 'Museo Contempo'

There is more and as I remember it I will remind you.

If you live out of town and you always wanted to attend a list party than this would be 
 one of the biggest you could attend. Plan to fly in for this one.


For those of you who live here, save your gift buying money. Spend it here. Buy stuff 
from your favorite BM artists

ok, so i haven't been going to burning man every year since 87.  in
fact, this year was my first.  it won't be my last.  i don't have any
other burning man's to compare bm97 to, but i know this one blew my
mind.  i thought it was too cool for words, and i didn't notice any of
this commercialism everybody keeps talking about.  probably about the
least commercial event i've ever experienced in my life, actually. 
granted no one died this year - some people seem to regret that fact,
understandably.  i could see where the element of danger might make it
more exiting.  but...

maybe it's like taking a new drug - the second or third time is never
as good as the first.  although i've had this conversation more than
once - "i didn't go to burning man this year, it's gotten too
commercial."  "oh, so you've been before?"  "well, actually, no..."  

summer of 96 a friend in nc convinced me to drive out with him for the
festival, i was completely willing.  then he convinced me not to go
after all - "it's gonna be too commercial this year, i wouldn't
bother" - how he knew that is beyond me, and i wished i hadn't
listened to him. i think he out-cooled himself, and me in the process.
 don't let anyone tell you "it's not gonna be any good this year." 
find out for yourself...

heroooow!!!!!!!!!! *huggles and kisses for everyone* Lovely monday morning
here in downtwon sf! hehe..i spent yesterday recuperating from the party on
saturday night that i feel sooooooo refreshed!!! =)
Anyway, on saturday night, a couple of us were wondering what to do..we had
no ride to Oakland to go to Byroni's b-day bash, and we didn't want to
spend $25 to go to the FTT party at maritime hall..so we were stressing (
for those of you who know me, I haven't gone partying in a loooooong
time...hehe..lack of funds )We finally found this lil ug at 11th and
howard.  I cant remember the name of the party but it was prolly one of the

I would love to see the adresses that others have contributed.
I will send mine to anyone interested. 

As some of you know i make eye candy and always love to see
what others have done. I know where you might be able to display
your work (to ravers) also if you are interested.

Maybe we can set up a small eye candy mailing list...anyone know
where or how we can do that cheap?

	In support of raves vs. clubs, I'd have to say that I
get macked on like crazy at clubs and really not at all 
at raves...has anyone else experienced this?  Hey, maybe
I'm not too pretty in the darkness of the ravin' underground,
but clubs *are* a bit of a meatmarket.....& just so I don't get
any flames, I've worked in a few clubs and totally have
*nothing* against them...clubbing is kewl every now and
then......it's just my personal experience as of late that 
 at massives and small UG's I can thoroughly enjoy
the *musical experience*, be with and make friends & 
not have to worry about keeping as escape route open... :)

have a happy happy...

luv n hugs,
natasha

ps anyone else stressin about finals??!@?

Subject: Monday Thoughts...
Sender: sfraves-owner@hyperreal.org
Precedence: bulk

Here are a few random Monday thoughts I wanted to share....

Deep:

THe first Deep, which will be a monthly, was last Friday at Il Pirata on
16th near Potrero...  allow me to say DO NOT MISS this party next month!
Sweet little neighborhood bar space with easy easy parking, a
super-comfortable feeling, a perfect layout with the bar separate from the
dance room, so you could hang out and talk, then go dance, then talk....
really great groovy tunes being spun by Forest then Biojeff (then I left,
who was next?) .... perfect.  Great job, Tony, Jeff/Ann and crew!

Age:

As one of the elders on this list, I'm usually amused at the occasional
threads about age ... often triggered by a young person feeling excluded
simply because of their chronological age... and often accompanied by a
statement that argues that age is not an issue at all....

But age *is* an important factor in who we are .... because the longer you
live, the more experiences you will have.... and the more you can learn
about the ways of the world.  See, it's not the *number* of your age....
it's the amount of *learning* you've had the time to do that makes the
older ones (usually) have it more together than the younger ones (usually).

Exceptions to the rule? But of course... some people just have a sense of
confidence and an ability to learn by observing others that gives them a
natural foundation of wisdom... and they may be far more mature at 20 than
others might be by 40...  and some people live their whole life in a
selfish and unaware state, so they never move beyond the petty childish
perceptions of the world around them (hey, just turn on Jerry Springer to
see exactly what I mean)...

But for those of you who are 15, 16, 17 years old...  no matter how much
you feel that you are an adult and have a lot of maturity... relax, enjoy
where you are now, don't be in such a rush to be old, because it's going to
happen fast enough anyway.... and if you're under 21 and can't go to a bar
yet, just chill, please, because it will happen soon enough, and wishing it
would be sooner... well, that's really just wishing some of your best and
most enjoyable years would hurry up and be done with, and that is wishing
your life away.


Security Thugs:

John's story of what happened at Stompy sucks...  Since I wasn't there, I
can't say whether any of the actions were in any way justified (I was a
bartender for years, and I know that sometimes situations escalate in a way
that was never intended)...  but I have a hard time imagining John creating
such a ruckus at a wild and crazy Stompy party that he'd have to be 86'd.
And the stories of security confiscating stuff from patrons and sharing it
among themselves is, to me, the scummiest of behaviors...

We must speak up as promoters and as patrons at clubs, and let the
management know that we will not allow our friends and guests to be treated
this way! And promoters must step forward and speak up to the owners of a
space about how their guests are treated....  because we go to a promoter's
event, not to a space.. John wouldn't have been there if it wasn't Stompy,
and so Preston and his crew, I believe, have a responsibility to make sure
that John and their other guests are treated appropriately, by the Stompy
crew, as well as the people who work at the venue.

Using licensed spaces is a reality of our world, because we don't have a
lot to choose from... but that doesn't mean that we can't demand to be
treated respectfully...  Security is a fact of life in clubs, but there are
plenty of clubs (like 1015) where the security people show that it's not
about a power trip to them.  Speak up, tell management when you feel poorly
treated by their staff, and let's insist that we are treated with the
respect we deserve.  By putting up with this, we are silently accepting it.


Pickup Lines:

Call me dense,or romantic, or naive, but I loved that story of the guy
staring, and the girl saying "have we met" and him saying "no, but I'd like
to know you" or whatever...  I think if more of us were a little more
direct in expressing our true attraction to others we encounter, life would
be a lot less neurotic, with fewer cat and mouse games going on.

First, though, as in most situations, you want to try to put yourself in
the other person's shoes for a minute.... and try to see if this person is
truly love-struck (yep, it can happen) and hoping you feel the same (so you
might say, "wow, that's so sweet, sorry but i have a boyfriend")...  or
maybe you sense that they're just on some automatic pilot cruise control
with canned lines and no real attention to the person they're talking to
(when you might say "excuse me, you're making me uncomfortable, can you try
that line on someone else maybe?")...

Just be careful to remember that it really is a compliment when someone is
attracted to you, so don't just turn and flee when they get the nerve to
tell you so!  After all, you never know who you might meet if you keep an
open mind and have the courage not to run away from every encounter with a
stranger (some of my very favorite people used to be strangers ;^)  ...
thank god for the ones who had the balls to say what they were thinking so
I'd know!

sorry for this disconnected ramble.... just wanted to add some things to
these threads... happy monday, all!

love, leslie

Hey everybody, and hey everyone else.
I'm just a sittin' here enjoying the colors from our sun pass rays 
through the trees and watching the bugs and birds start to move again 
and of course eating some M&M's :)
   I will be unsubbing from the list for a while to try to pay attention 
to all the advice that I've been giving to my friends and using some of 
it for myself.  
   Everything is good, well not everything, but most of it anyways.  I 
just got done erasing 700 emails or so and being busy, it's just 
difficult to keep caught up (my computer's wanked so it wont delete all 
of them at once without it yelling at me)
But anyhoo, I'll still be around and around and around...
   Byroni,  I really had a good time at your party, seeing you, Derek, 
MihnQlee, Dodger, and meeting some others, Tracy, Ms. Ruby.  It was nice 
to be able to dance to what you love the most :)
  I'll be at the Harmony party on the 27th with the five people in the 
world that I love more than the sun...I'm really stoked they're all 
coming home :)
  
Till then, I hope you all enjoy yourselves and your elves for it is that 
time of year.  
  And AndyW, I'm one of those guys that gets weirded out at the end of 
the year too, 
  Too many great memories, too many memories, and so many more are 
heading towards us (thanks El nino) :P

I actually *do* call it my secret weapon. :) My mom got it for me for my
bday.... after being out of the stuff for like 2 years I thought it was
time to be cleansed in it's power. I love the smell of the stuff... But it
has yet to work as a secret weapon..... so it's still being tested... :)

Hey, I have no conclusive evidence.  I have come to that conclusion
because, given my experiences, and now the documented experiences of others
(there has been at least 3 of these ejections to people of color at Stompy
@ VSF), I cannot rule it out.  I am still trying to figure it out, and go
over, and over in my mind *what* I did that could have cuased someone not
to like me.  I am always respectful of people, and I didn;t vibe security.
When all other options are eliminated, seek the outrageous.  Racism is such
a thing, and it is the only thing left, all things considered.  I am still
grappling with this, however, I am sticking by my conclusion given the
expereiences I have gathered.

Nope because they did not, and that in itself is no proof either of racist
intent, although a strong argument can be made.  I looked at all teh
variables and it comes down to two things:
_security @ vsf has a problem overall.
_security @ vsf has ejected brothers for highly suspect reasons.

I have been the victim of real racism before.  Often times it never hits
you face on.  The N word is never spoken, other issues are brought up.
Whether it is perfromance, attendance, or vague complaints from unnamed
people, I've seen it all.  And I do not draw these conclusions lightly.

I was listening to a radio program the other day and they were talking
about sports.  The question was brought up as to why there are so many
blacks that participate in sports, and excel.  One reason is that the rules
are very plain and very universal and applied to everyone equally.  Sports
is a 100% merit based activity.  either you're good or bad.  Same can be
said of the military to a lesser extent (for politics and favors are the
key elements as well).  But in sports everything is laid out and defined.
Now compare that to companies, where knowledge is just one small element of
the overall picture.  Politics plays a great role, association as well, and
other metrics that are difficult to quantify.  The rules , on the surface,
apply to everyone, but certainly not equally.  You can be the best
programmer in the world, but hey, you don;t bathe as often as I do.  I'm
going to apply my metric and hold you back.  This is why there are 43
million dollar players in sports, and 43,000 players in the tech field.
That is one reason why CEO's are mostly male and white, while some of the
most brillinat people who make it possible to make these salaries are
Asian, East Indian, women, etc.  The rules vary at different levels, and
the games played vary as well.  The metric in companies shifts and changes
with the administration and whose on top.  Whereas in sports the rules are
written, defined, and administered equally.  It changes the higher you rise
in sports organizations, one reason why you see fewer people of color at
the top.  But that is changing as well, thank goodness.

Nope there is not a klansman everywhere I look, there certainly isn't one
under my bed.  However, sometimes you just know that something *is* w/o it
ever being said.  You can see it in people's eyes, and you can sense it.

Funny things about senses.  I asked my attorney today while talking about
this VSF incident *how* they could tell I was drunk.  He responded "visual
cues".  Talk about subjective.  In any case, I know wassup, and that club
has alot of problems, mine is just one of them.

I'll never attend another party at VSF until they get thier house in order.
I don't care whose playing or whose party it is.

You know Adder, sometimes you just *feel* it.  Question though for you to
think about:  Does someone have to say that they don;t like you for you to
know that they don;t like you?

Food for thought old friend.

Much peace and thanks for the feedback!

Peace :),

	Yep there is definatly a "meat market" aspect to all clubs (some are 
much worse than others) it seems to be an inherent part of the club 
scene. I find that have no problem staying away from this aspect of 
it though, and when I do encounter it I can usually easily deal with 
it..   That said, I also realize that this is not necessarily true 
for women dealing with men (not meant to be sexist for those of you 
that don't know me.. it's just based on my observations) and 
unfortunatly, it seems that sometimes the only way for you to deal 
with this is to stay away. 
	My reason for posting this to the list is that I was curious if any 
of you have found a club where this is not the case, or at least 
where the "meat market effect" seems to be less pronunced. Please let 
me know if you have, I would be interested in checking these places 
out. Thanks in adavnce.

(BTW the reumors you mention are quite true, I've done my research, you are
quite free to do yours).

Misrepresentations?  Huh?  I am openly talking about my assertions and they
certainly haven't denied it.  Silence is capitulation.  As for my other
assertions, every one of them can be backed up.

As for the racil motivation, how many blacks does it take to prove racism,
1,2,100, 1000.  I can give you at this point 5 examples of vague reasons
given to black ment for ejection from Stompy @ VSF.  But I figure that will
never be enough for anyone.  Suffice it to say I beleive it, and until it
happens to you you will probably not beleive me.

Oh well, I'm moving on and never going to that VSF again.  Stompy is
poisoned by having a club there.  Watch out come new years.  If security is
even half as bad as it is now, this scenario , along with others will be
repeated.

> A claim of throwing out black patrons?

this has happened on at least three other occasions @ VSF during Stompy's.
Preston has been alerted and hopefully he will take action against an
arbitrary security.

Funny how people want to not beleive someone, no matter how much proof is
offered.  or worse yet, how someone feels.  Take from my post what you
will, bottom line however is that security has a serious problem at VSF.


>This didn't happen, at least from what I have read... and there are black
>men on the security at VSF... there was at least one at that Stompy.

You are correct there is one black security guard, he was NOT at the door
at the time of my ejection.  As a matter of fact there are 4 black security
guards.  I have found out more but the point is moot.  Just becuase there
are blacks working security at VSf doesn't mean that security doesn't
practice some form of exlcusion.  may I remind you Texaco had alot of
blacks working for it too.  But they were not the owners.  They were
jellybeans. ;)

Good!

>It seems as though this has hurt your pride and you are now looking for
>some sort of revenge.

Nope, I am looking for an explanation so that I may enjoy the venue again
w/o fear of being ejected over nefarious conditions.  Let me clue you in,
I've knows preston for about 6-7 years, dig.  I have done things far more
embarassing than getting ejected.  Shit, I laugh with people about it
during the day and crack jokes about myself.  That however, doesn't mean
that I don;t take it personally because I do.  As for revenge, what could
that be?  Pointing out that a club has problems is a public service not
revenge.  You are making unkind characterizations and I would warn you to
do otherwise.  My ego is very large, and my life is large and complex, I
rarely go out enough for this to hinder the other fun activities in my
life, and my ego has taken worse bruisings and I've come out on top
(something about Year of The Dragon.  this is just one of those instances
where I feel I was wronged and spoke up about it.  I have not called for a
boycott.  Instead I have warned others to pay special attention.  The
*CLUB* even acknowledges that there is a problem, I cannot go into details
but there is plenty that is going on behind the scenes.  In any case, I am
not seeking revenge, get it.  I am seeking the truth so that this doesn;t
happen to someone who pays to go into a club only to find themselves
ejected for basically nothing.

People see what they want to see.

>  Just make sure that this is justified and based on
>something real before you shoot down the venue of one of the best parties
>happening these days.

Thanks for that sage advice.  It is obvious that I feel am clear and
justified, and that is all *I* need.  tacit approval is not what I'm
seeking, I am sharing an experience, my experience with *you* and others.
The party may be all good, but it is only as good as the venue.  Preston
knows this very well, and if these problems persist, that party will cease
being anything but a pain.  If people can't relax then what's the point of
going out.

Please don't take my word for it, read about others experiences at Stompy @
VSF.

BTW, thanks for defending my friend's party.  He'll appreciate it.  I don;t
blame Preston, but I do call into question the wisdom of keeping it there
if these problems cannot be solved.  Good party or no, there are greater
issues more important than a good crack on.

Thanks,
John


P.S.  Did I mention I don;t like VSF and that their security has a problem.
Don't slip up!

i think that most clubs have that pick-up element to them, but in
degrees.  1015 is pretty much a full on meat market (though different
rooms have slightly different vibes) where you see a lot of couples
dirty dancing, and if people aren't dancing together they're scoping
unabashedly.  lots of couples leave together.

on the other end of the clubbing spectrum, i got a very different vibe
@ ultra in the currently infamous vsf.  not only were people not
dancing with each other, the nights i went i really didn't seem to see
much  pick-up action going on.  well, a little, but less than at some
raves.  people seemed to be actually dancing in their own space, not
just pretending to.  but that was my perception, i only went twice,
and the scene is quite different on different nights.

liquid, in my opinion, is a really nice sort of in between.  you see
lotsa guys n gals looking sorta spiffed up, possibly out for some sort
of action.  but you don't really see people grinding on the dance
floor, nor have i heard many complaints about groping or pestering. 
especially at static on tuesday - you don't have all these people
migrating into town to get laid.  more like people exchanging numbers
to call before the weekend.  plus there are definitely some who go
there just to dance - there are a few people i see regularly who come
in dressed super casually, dance for hours without hardly speaking a
word to anyone, then leave alone, every time.

i'm still trying to figure out the end-up, especially sunday morning. 
lots of spun clubkidz, obviously, but i can't quite figure the sexual
vibe there, though i see/feel it.  maybe i'd understand if i was a
meth head...

finally, generally speaking, any club scene on a weekday night is
bound to be less overtly sexual, and probably aimed more at an
audience interested in the music.  liquid can get pretty randy on a
friday (though it's still not as bad as 1015 on a wed, much less a
weekend nite), same with vsf.

this thread reminds me of the "how sexy is your music" post, which i
thought was hilarious and quite accurate (and reflected in the music
played at these clubs).

-messiah wannabe

ps. i think i just realized a big difference between the pickup scene
at raves and clubs.  besides sex not being the main (or at least not
the only) point at raves, the thing is that girls are much more likely
to approach you, whereas in a club usually it's the guy who makes the
approach. and by the girls reversing the normal rules, they are less
likely to get pestered alladamntime, cause the norm is more to back
off till a girl really lets you know she's interested by introducing
herself, or offering you some gum, or just walking up and kissing you
square on the puss.  hmmm, whadaya think, does this sound right?

your good!

no wonder they call you the -Messiah-...
did you study human behavior 101 or something?
;)

i prefer to make the first move myself... or at least let them know that i
AM interested; eye contact, a smile... whatever works...  that way _I_ get
to do the choosin'!  
it's hard though... i know how annoying some guys can be- starring you
down, following you around, dancing on top of you... the last thing i want
to do is put someone off like that... so it's a very challenging thing to
'pick' someone up.  
i feel most comfortable when you're past a certain point and realize that
the guy is just being friendly with no intentions or expectations.  THEN...
and only then, will i let my guard down. (unless of course my eyes were on
him before he even approached!  then he's mine!  ok- so i'm getting a
little carried away here...)  it's sad that i even have to put a 'guard
up... but after experience as a women, you have to! there are a lot of
slimey men  (and i'm sure women too!)  that are out to pick anything and
everything up... if you get my drift!  
better to be safe than sorry!

worst pick-up line- 
"you look so familiar... were you at (name any place with the same
clientele as the place you're at...) last weekend?"
duh... "no habla espanol..."

just on my way home now! 
nice post, messiah... just wanted to say hi.

Its intereting to look at how a species sexual atitudes change over time.
There was one a time when sex was considered a sacred act.

It was done in the tantric temples as a way to celebrate and practice our
spirituality.

Today it has degenerated into a physical act alone...often lacking
in any spiritual aspect at all. That is why we feel shame about
it....because we have forgotten how sacred it is.

Many feel it is time we remember those sacred ways of celebrating life.

perhaps raving is an early experiment in finding new ways to 
revive that.

or maybe not...what do you think?

i love the rain. 
baby huey misses you all (danny) and is going thru SFR withdrawal, so drop
him a line :)
he's poobear@hotmail.com and i predict his return soopa soon!
wrote this when i couldn't sleep last night because of how loud the rain
was when it hit my roof... ahh :)


i love it when the sound of rain
drowns you out
"i can't hear you," i say
as you scream and shout
your lips are moving
but i don't hear your words
i smile blankly and laugh
as this occurs

thank god for the sound of the rain
when it falls
i don't have to listen to
your brutal calls
when nature is silent 
my mind can't block you out
i hear your every word
your whisper, your shout
they pierce my heart 
allowing it to bleed
your hateful words
i do not need

so i love it when the sound of rain 
drowns you out
i can't hear you.. 
not your whisper..
not your hate..
not your shout..

Do any of you think we need to have a few el nino raves to ward
off the evil spirits of el nino?  Shouldnt we be out there 
stompimg in the rain and splashing in the mud instead of in here
tapping on these plastic keyboards? And then a big fire and 
feast at the beach afterwards?

necessary control programs.
ENGINEERING
     The disassembled parts of a high-powered rifle have been placed

preventing these effects. Criticize this method from all possible
points of view. Point out the deficiencies in your point of view, as
demonstrated in your answer to the last question.

I have a question for you women. 

Do you really want to be treated as my equal...now think about that.
Do you really want me to treat you like you are some half crazy old
man that is losing his hair and his mind? Do you really want that?

I have heard that women that want to be equal to men have 
no real ambition.

Hey peeps...

I just wanted to send you some shit that happened to me on saturday.  I
went to a party in oakland near homebase...don't remember the name, and
i'll tell you why!  I bought some X from this chickie at the door...
unknowingly there was something wrong w/ it.
Finally after dancing for about an hour or so... is started feeling all
fuck up, and it wasn't the usual X feelings.  I started trippin out, and
seeing wierd shit.  The music was so intense that I started going crazy,
and I had to leave... by then I figured out I was candyflipping(x/acid)
I have never done acid befor, and I was at this party by myself(dumb
idea) well any ways I left the party and walked over to tacobell where I
saw some other people leaveing... I walked up to them and told them my
situation... I was so scared... These nice party goers lived in hayward
and they drove me all the way back to SF from oakland... I don't really
remember who they were, but I will never forget what they did for me...
that is why i love this scene so much... even though we could all be
complete stranger... we are never able to turn any one down for help, as
if we are all best-friends. That night was to be an unforgettable
night... that i will always take into consideration before buying drugs
again... I'm not going to stop, but I am going to be alot more
caucious.  Please feel free to reply to this post.  I will try to go
more indepth w/ you if you write back... But I just want to thank those
people who helped me out... and I want to thank the sfrave scene for
being there when i needed you most...

Andrew

-->PS  You also mentioned the military as an equal opportunity employer in

exploiter in using any possible human fodder that might come its way, 
think about it; who runs the show?  That's right, it's an old WASP men's
country club and any form of advancement in the country club corps is
mutually exclusive to women, gays, and all token minorities that are not
useful for PR purposes.

that top athletes and fashion models get paid more than neurosurgeons or

top university education without a sports scholarship, or how many times
have you heard the old adage of the pretty girl next door leavin
everything to go to LA or NYC to make it big but end up as a junkie
prostitute? Life is neutral, the world doesn't care, only humanity has the

I would have to agree with you, Andrew.  When I went to that little tiny
underground on Friday night, I was especially timid since there were sooooo
few people there and everyone seemed to already know each other.  But to my
surprise, everyone wanted to be my friend.  I didn't even approach anyone
to introduce myself...they all approached me.  I loved it!

-->  I don't like attaching the term "sacred" to things; sacredness is
purely subjective and smacks too much of religion--whether mine or yours.
Some people like empty fast emergency love; I personally don't care for it
too much, but it is sometimes fun :)  For me sex is much more significant
(and better) when I care for my partner, but who am I to reject the
occassional vagaries of karma...there have been instances when random
trysts have been...er...exceptional.  Okay, let's get one thing clear,
I am not a loose person, nor am I a walking hormone ready to jump any
passing hoochie; after examining the laws of probability as related to me,
I know what to expect under certain circumstances.  If only I was lucky or
regimented enough to only have mind boggingly soul satisfyingly epiphanous
encounters all the time, how would I be able to differentiate the good
from the mediocre?  When you make sex (a basic biological instinct) sacred
there is always the risk of taboos and personally, I feel that the US is
too Puritanical with hang-ups as it is.  The reason sex has lost its
meaning for some is because they have lost themselves along the way and
are not able or willing to see the relationship between sex and love.  Sex
does not equal love and love does not equal sex, sex may come from love
and love may come from sex, but sex cannot replace love and love cannot
replace sex; whatever the situation may be, just know where you stand and
don't blind yourself from the truth.

ahem. are you serious????? ?!?!?!?!

well, i can't respond for _all_ women, but hell yes! i _do_ want to be paid
equally, given equal rights, etc. perhaps i don't want to be held in the
same esteem as some "half crazy old man that is losing his hair and his
mind", but do i want to be seen as equal to a man of the same educational,
socio-economic, blah blah background as me.

and if you ask me, it is the ones that _do_ want equality, stand up for it
and don't back down, who _do_ have the ambition. bite your tongue, mr.
fish!

time for work.

cheers - e. :)

Interesting.  Then I guess the Constitution is suspect since it's authors
were all slave owners.  I also would suggest that Darwin be dismissed
because of his view of European superiority.  What of Ghandi?  He wasn't
exactly the great equalizer when it came to women.

The point here is that we see what we want to see.  Adn dwell on what is
important to us.  Fact is the words Kipling used are as true now as then.
When applied to Kiplings time (remember India was occupied by Britian), his
words ring especially true and ironic.

I am glad that I used the quote and will continue to do so.

Truth is truth.

Peace,
John

Karsten, I believe this is totally relative to the
night and to what music is being played. Go on a 
Thursday  (Anthem) I bet you won't see too many
ladies bumbin' and gridin'.

Precisely, every club in the city is different on
different nights, I'm not trying to justify clubs
against raves - they are different in many respects.

Never been, can't comment.

Buddy, the End-up is probably the longest standing
club in the City. I think saying,"I'd understand if I
was a meth head" is like saying I'd understand raves
if I was an E-head, don't generalize. Not everyone
there is Cracked-on and its probably one of the most
diverse crowds you will find in any club. Why do you
find the need to define it - go and have fun - if your
not having fun - don't go!

True! (IMHO)

I'm not to sure about that - give me some proof, I have
been approached equally in both environments (and have
done some of my own approaching 80).

Fish,

I'm no women, but I believe if I were, I would sure
as hell wanted to be treated as your equal losing
hair, half crazy or not. Its the point that we all
need equality.

Please tell me you are not serious? In the words of

oh my god, megan says that this is her....

>worst pick-up line-
>"you look so familiar... were you at (name any place with the same
>clientele as the place you're at...) last weekend?"


now i'm really freaking out, cuz sometimes when i'm out, i see someone who,
you know, looks really familiar, and i, you know, think maybe i saw them
somewhere else that i was the weekend before.... and i might actually say
to them.... "you look so familiar, were you at .....  last weekend"

and, you know, there is probably absolutely NO scamming intended, because
these are simple English words that express an idea from one human being to
another....   and it really saddens me that to some, this is a pickup line.

not to jump on you megan, since i'm sure there was some inflection
somewhere in this line that didn't translate in writing (i hope) .....  but
i do worry that we sometimes become so defensive that in fact we have put
up barriers that do not work to our benefit....

yes, clubs are often meat markets, but you don't have to play that game...

to me, when i go to a club and don't want to be bothered, i wear a hat with
a brim that shields my eyes.... works fine for me... and i dress down or
dress a little weird, and usually find that the guys who are cruising for
the girlies with the tight black pants and high-heeled black sandals and
the half-shirts and handbags and perfect lipstick and shit... these guys
know that you're not one of those girlies and they generally leave you
alone....

and if they don't leave you alone, then you look them in the eye, and you
smile and you shake your head and say in a very clear voice "no, thank you,
i'd appreciate if you'd leave me to dance alone in peace" ....  and if they
don't, then you ignore them or move to another part of the room, or if
necessary, you ask security to help you out.

because women have a right to go out without being hassled.... but
sometimes that requires speaking up for yourself and claiming your space
and your right to say no to someone's advances...

but let's not forget that there are nice people out there, too, who might
change our lives when we get to know them, and you can't get to meet them
with all your defenses up....  and some of those people might come up to
you and say "you look really familiar, weren't you at............ last
weekend?"

ahhahahah this is _so funny_! I guess it was done by some TV
station about rave culture - it's hilarious! It looks like a television
advertisement for raves or something.

Check it out at:

http://www.wral-tv.com/features/forthechildren/1997/1120-outallnight/rave.qt

also check out
http://www.wral-tv.com/features/forthechildren/1997/1120-outallnight

and read what it has to say, it's pretty funny!

do you guys know of any other online rave footage?

love kim

Perhaps you have me confused with someone else. I never mentioned any such

hello.

I'm in a band called Her Ear Eth Efact Syo Urequested.  We are an
experimental, psychedelic
avant backasswards rock and roll outfit...

            DJ

                                          his machines.

We are getting ready to release a CD, and we plan on doing a lot of shows
to promote the album,
starting in the spring.  We are looking for a dependable, serious visual
artist to light our stages with a  luminary collage.  preferably someone
who is studying or has experience with visual art.  Or at least, someone
with a Vision.

Films, slides, overhead projectors.  Fans blowing bubbles.   Mazzola and
food coloring.

We currently cannot offer pay.  We are looking for someone who wants to
create art for art's sake,   (until we all get famous and can afford to
build swimming pools inside of swimming pools.)

In the meantime,  we just want to have a good time and put on serious shows
in collaboration with you and your ideas.

We often gig  to the Burning Man crowd.  Art galleries, clubs, private
parties, usually with  people
who have a sense of the absurd.

While we are not an electronic band, at least one of us :o) is a raver, and
many of our themes are ravelike

Ok fish this is absurd!!!!!!!  

Being considered equal has  more to  do with  being treated  as something
 less than equal. What I  mean by this,  women and everybody else should
be treated as you would treat yourself (even though you are a male)(I am
just kidding)  Do you think you yourself are not able to make it in a
careers that you choose, do you think that you are not intelligent enough
to vote,  do you believe that if you chose to be in a ring with large
gloves on your hands that you would not  be capable of defending yourself
against your aggressor, just because you have certain genitalia?  What
gives those that treat women as less than equal the inclination to make
those absurd generalizations for women.  The point is that people are
people and should be treated as that.  We are not your dog, your car or
your computer we are your  other half.

Those that speak out against the absurdity of sexism are not the ones
without the ambition.  Those that let others decide what they can do with
their life are the unambitious ones in my book.  Who has the right to
chose my life and what I want to do with it?  Me!


I care not that you might be a half crazed man, that is losing your hair,
that has nothing to do with you treating me with the respect any other
living being deserves.


I hope I got my point across

RLove

though i see where the foolish fish is coming from (sort of), I have to
take exception to the sweeping generality that sex has "degenerated into a
physical act alone"...  Tantra/ sacred sex is still practiced today, and
there is a great resurgence of interest in tantra throughout the western
world ....  and frankly, i don't think that most of western civilation
*ever* thought of sex as a truly sacred act.

and while i agree that raving is an amazing way to celebrate life, the
thought of reviving conscious sacred sexuality in the rave environment is
sorta funny to me...

because tantra is about focusing attention and energy to increase the
sexual energy to new levels.... but raving is about multiple sensory
stimulation that goes beyond sexual activities... it is about interacting
with many different people to create a vibe, and that cannot be done
through sex...  a room full of people practicing tantric sex would be an
entirely different vibe than a room full of people dancing...

my favorite quote  is "Dancing is a vertical expression of a horizontal
desire" .... and i while think that sex and dancing have similarities in
their power over us and our personal energy... i don't think that tantra
and raving can really overlap...

unless we had a really special chill space with a workshop going on... hmmmm...

and on the other teaser that foolish fish offered to get us arguing about
the obvious... ("equality" has nothing to do with wanting to *be* the other
person... it is about having the same *opportunities* as the other
person)...  i won't even be pulled into that silly discussion, i got enough
problems without adding losing my hair to the list....

I don't think raving has anyting to do with sex.  I didn't get into it
with the chance that I might score with some cute little candy raver, I
like the music.  Actually they didn't even exist then(~'91).  I have been
to Nakita even back when it was Mecca, and it has been a meat market ever
since.  But that is a club, a true rave has tons of cool people dancing
and talking to each other.  Sharing candy or whatever and just having fun. 
Some people on E loose all interest in sex and just enjoy the sensuality
of being close to like minded people and feeling the music.  I think
raving has more to do with a closenss and family with stangers then some
kind of sexual ritual. But we are all human and most people think about
sex a shit load of the time, so I don't blame your preoccupation with this
thread.

Amen to that!  Some people might extrapolate this line of thinking to find,
as I do, that raves can be a social event where we escape the meat-market
aspects so common among other social gatherings.

I do this too...i have a a very poor memory and have often asked
people the same question out of honesty. I am very much in love and 
basically out of the dating game and have been for a while. Actually
its
kind of irritating when you approach someone and they automatically
assume that because you are talking to them that I want to have sex
with them. I rememeber a time recently where i saw a woman at a rave
and knew she looked familiar but couldnt remember where from so after
watching her for a while trying to remember i went over and asked 
using the above line. She looked at me like i was a piece of scum
for saying that. Over the coarse of the day i kept running into
her and she kept giving me those wierd looks. Finally i remembered
and went up and told her. Then she completely changed and gave me 
a big, big hug and every thing was fine and we had a nice conversation.

Of course im very aware that "dont i know you from somewhere'
is a very old and silly pickup line but i still use it on both 
women and men not as a pickup but as an honest statement.
If anyone can suggest a better way of saying that i would love to hear
it so i wont embarass myself too much anymore.

and just as a side note,since i have had this situation arise
several times at partys and online...im not dating or even looking
so dont assume that just because im talking to you that 
im trying to hit on you.

happy holidays all

Hi folks!  ]=}

 For what it's worth, I went to the Troc for the Tsunami party (trance) 
this past summer. The place was reasonably full, I smoked pot (for 
medical reasons of course--I have a "documented" bad back), yet I never 
once had a bad feeling from security. Hell! I don't even think I saw them!

With all due respect i feel like you dont quite understand where im coming
from. I always have a problem explaining some of my less mainstream ideas
and often wind up in trouble like this or the blue angels post.
Yes the statement was a generalization but let me ask you this
to clarify. IF i come up to you and tell you that i want
to make love with you...is your first interpretaion of that
question that i want physical intercourse or that i want 
have a spiritual connection with you.? Most people would think
of genital sex. Tantra is a spiritual act that doesnt even
require you to touch another person. 

tantra as it is being praticed today in western society and
now by these newagers is very different from what was practiced
in the goddess societies. So i agree that western society
has never treated sex as sacred.

>

> sorta funny to me...

Again i agree, sort of.
I think that a new way of imtimate relating is being explored
at raves, sometimes. I feel that we as a society have lost
many things that are important to life like the tribal
rituals for example. I think people are looking for 
ways to revive some of what we have lost yet do it
in a way that fits today.
Dancing with the devine such as the sufis or in the goddess
temples is very similar to raves and i know many who
believe they were part of the goddess societies that dance
at raves because it produces that same experiences of the ancient
temples. But as you say raves and tantric temples are probably
not the best mix...but there are some connections there.

Actually in real tantra a room full of dancing people is exactly
what you have. Tantra does not always include intercourse. And
actually the vibe is very similar if the rave is about group 
conciousness and becoming one with something larger. Tantra 
is also a "multiple sensory stimulation that goes beyond
sexual activities" and it is sometimes "about interacting
with many different peole to create a vibe" ( not nessesarily sexual)
If you alter your sentence a little...you could say "raving
is about focusing attention and energy to increase the
 energy to new levels"

ok i guess i have to explain this one too.

Yes equal opportunities for everyone...i agree.
That post was have serious...i thought that was clear, guess not.
 
I have always thought that people liked to be treated with respect
and like intelligent sane people. 
Based on the response to my post it appears that some women 
here would prefer to be treated as crazy and lacking in intelligence
because that is how i am treated and they want equal treatment.
SO now im confused on this one =)

I believe that women and men are different and need to be treated
differently. I havent quite worked out exactly what that means
because i do believe that we all deserve equal treatment
and respect but how do we do that if we are different?

Hi all!  ]=}


 One of my big gripes about the Space Children flyers IS that BM is a 
non-commercial arts festival. No sponsership by Coors and the ilk is 
allowed. Having people advertise a commercial event (ie Space Children) 
is totally against what many are trying to experience at BM. Creativity 
and human surrealism without commercials. It is a noble cause which (I 
feel) deserves full support from artists. I know I walked away feeling 
more inspired and charged up than i have in a  l o n g  time.

 Big thanks!! I must say that I was mearly one of many dedicated 
individuals that came together for our *dance stage* (there are NO raves 
at BM!  ;). I and the others from our camp were very happy to be a succesful 
part of Burning Man '97.

 BTW is was my first Burn and OH MY GOD was it good!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  :)

Over the last couple of months I've been meaning to post about something.
I'm trying to find a particular person that used to call a BBS I ran in
the past. He may or may not be on the list but I thought it wouldn't hurt
to post about it. You see I used to run a BBS called "The Infinity
Gauntlet" in Martinez back in the early late 80s/early 90s... and on this
BBS I had a message base topic about raving and techno. I believe I called
it "Tekno". Well, to make a long story short there was a guy who called
and posted a lot, who was active in the rave scene around here. I'd like
to locate this guy just to say "what's up" and to meet in person. Just a
little blast from the past.... I shut the board down pretty ubruptly for
reasons I'm not going to go into here.... but if you're this person please
e-mail me....   pretty vague post but if you're on here you'll know what
I'm tawking about....

Peace.

I heard that joke along time ago...i think his point
was that men were not that great so why would anyone
want to be like these "slimey sexist idiots running this world".
It was a different time... when men believed that a womens
place was in the kitchen....so why would a women
want to be a sexist old jerk. Why not strive to be better
than that...to be someone who acts with integrity
and respect of all regardless of what gender, race or
what ever.

does that help calrify?

        ><{{{">  <"}}}><

ps...just to be sure, i do believe in equal rights and do not
like sexism or racism or any other form of discrimination.

most people would think of what you call "genital sex" because in our
english language "make love" is a phrase that is used to mean "have sex"
(with some semantic differentiation, of course, and this phrase is chosen
to usually describe a more "connected" and "love-oriented" act of sex)....

therefore my thinking you mean you want to have physical sex is completely
understandable and expected... and that is separate from whether i think
you also meant to include a spiritual connection (which, i believe, is
present in most consenting sex)...

and if you i knew that you were a student of tantra (many of my friends are
both students and teachers of tantra), i would *still* assume you meant
physical sex.... tantra is *also* a physical act .... tantra is NOT simply
a spiritual practice, it can be tied in very real ways to the expansion of
physical sexual practice and energy.... and it's physical aspects are,
well, very cool.

>tantra as it is being praticed today in western society and
>now by these newagers is very different from what was practiced

>has never treated sex as sacred.

i think there's a bit of a non sequiter here (your first sentence does not
support your conclusion).

in my reality, i *AM* a member of western society, and of the "new age" of
western society, my experiences are of that realm... i personally do not
feel connected to the "goddess" societies, I feel connected to the society
in which i live... and i integrate the philosophies of many past societies
into my world view.... that's sort of what "new age" is to me... a point
where we have information and teachings from many cultures and practices,
and are working to integrate those into a different way of viewing the
world...  i get a little tired of phrases like "these newagers" that seem
to dismiss the transformational power of having thousands and millions of
people integrate ancient and/or metaphysical thoughts and beliefs into
their daily lives.... thank god for "these newagers" I say, because they're
changing how modern society views the world.

i agree that dancing is definitely a way to reach those levels and
experiences... that is especially clear in the psytrance community, where
you often see people spinning for long periods of time...

>SO now im confused on this one =)

duane, you made a "half-serious" remark.... (which half do you mean??) ...
but maybe it would be helpful to stop and see it from the other
perspective... because you know that women aren't saying they want to be
treated as crazy and lacking in intelligence... (though women are often
treated as moody, told "don't worry your little head about it," asked if
they have pms when they're angry about something, ignored when making
certain decisions, gawked at in public... things that you probably have
never experienced in this specific way, because these are things that
happen purely and simply because one is a woman)

issues of sexual equality aren't about you, they're about everyone.... and
so an example that uses just you, while cute and humorous, has little to do
with the reality that women are not guaranteed equal treatment, and that is
wrong.  equal access and equal rights FOR EVERYONE (even funny old fish who
are losing their hair) is an important thing, and though that doesn't mean
we can't ever make jokes about it, it does mean that what may seem
half-funny to you may not seem so funny to others who are looking from the
other side of that fence.

>I believe that women and men are different and need to be treated
>differently. I havent quite worked out exactly what that means
>because i do believe that we all deserve equal treatment
>and respect but how do we do that if we are different?

we *are* all different... and I do believe that in certain ways, women *in
general* are different from men *in general*.... but men and women "need to
be treated differently?"  .... come on, get over it, dude.

you want to treat individuals differently depending on who they are and
what they are all about?  that is wonderful, i think that's how it should
be.  However, if you are saying that I should be treated in a certain way
(good, bad or indifferent) simply because of my sex, that is patently
ridiculous, and sorry, and it ain't even 10 percent funny.

Believing that men *should* be one way and women *should* be another is a
trap and a cage... you can escape it, but you first have to acknowledge
that it's there.

Unless of course, you're really talking about physical tantric sex, in
which case one *would* treat me differently than a man, being as i have the
girlie parts and all.

I tend to agree with most of this but am wondering about the 
connections between raving and sex. While my personal preference
are the raves you describe that are not about "finding a cute
guy or some little raver chick"

However there is definately an element of sexuallity in raves
which some like and some dont. And we have been talking
more about sex than raves on sfraves for the past two weeks.

I really like the fact that the best raves(my taste) are ones where 
people are there for something besides getting laid, i know
that others really prefer raves where there is more sexaul freedom
and there is room for both i think.

This is another one of those things im still confused about
with raves...just what is sexualities place. I see some
who only go to find that special guy or girl and some
who go for other reasons. I havent really made up my mind
on this yet so i appreciate those that have shared their
opinions.

I like the way you think foolishfish.  Now all we

Or I guess we could make it an acoustic set. pound on

 i completely agree with you on this one.... there is no doubt about men
and women being different! it's physically obvious... and i also believe
that we're spiritually (yin-yang) and mentally different (scientifically
proven... whether that's nature/nurture... that's another whole story! :).
and that's where the dichotomy lies... we can be different AND equal.
we've proven this in race- why is gender such a difficult thing to deal with?
my problem is that yes "i am an equal"... but i there are times i like to
be treated like a lady.  what's that supposed to mean? i'm not quite sure.
maybe i'm a hypocrite?  i still find it pleasing when a man opens a door
for me... 
however- i feel quite pleased to do the same for him on occasion!

One time I was tearing it up on the dancefloor minding my own, and some guy
came up to me and said,  "Hey, who is that DJ spinning?"

I said,  "What are you, gay?"

leslie... honestly, i was going to add to that post that it's a complete
catch 22; i have also had that experience as well!   seeing someone that
you honestly think looks familiar... and i have to laugh at the fact!  How
can i then judge someone who says that to me? well, because the likely hood
of me truly looking familiar to the amount of people who approach me with
that query has to be relatively low... in no exaggeration- i've had about 7
different people ask me this question in the last 6 months!  and it usually
doesn't seem like a sincere question... it always has that 'pick-up line
sound'  you know what i mean? i think a lot of it has to do with scene
too... this has happened mostly at clubs/bars,  not raves/ugs/on the
street.  i usually comes with the whole meat market vibe...  
maybe i just have a really familiar face? possibly...  it just seems to
happen way too frequently!

>the half-shirts and handbags and perfect lipstick and shit... 
that's one great way of dealing with that situation... but personally i
don't want to dress down just i so don't get hit on... if i'm going to go
out to a club, a rave, the supermarket, or the gym...i'm going to dress how
i want to dress. 
and sometime i do actually go out to meet people!   yeah- i know that those
aren't the best places to meet someone... but why not???  i LOVE dancing
and music! and i'd love to meet someone else who loves that sort of thing
like i do...  BUT it's not meeting people that's the problem... it's the
insincere bullshit,  the person with 50 hands, or the person who keeps
blowing on your neck! it's disgusting, annoying, and rude! and i'm not
asking or signaling for any of that!  all i ask for is a little respect...
not only as a woman, but as another human being.

:)
yeah- i usually give people the benefit of the doubt... but that's gotten
me into some unusual situations.  i try to go with my intuition, because
some people just give off bad vibes!  maybe it's unjust to be depending on
a 7th sense... but what else is there to go on?  
Ed Bundy -seemed- like a really nice guy- to lots of different types of
girls... go figure?
you can never be too careful.  i'd rather miss out on the love of my life,
then end up a victim.

I'll be there ... so if you see me, please say hi.... i'll be wearing
overalls, with a striped sleeveless top, tattoos on my shoulders, curly
hair in a ponytail, but i might be wearing a leopard hat, and lots of
silver bracelets....

so all you over-21 sfravers there, it's a nice mellow way to spend a
weeknight (but i have to work in the morning, so i leave around midnight or
12:30 or sumthin!)

that was exactly the point i was trying to make.
That sex has degenerated into a physical act. In our culture
making love is a phrase used to mean have sex. It used to mean more.
And  many people engage in quickies that have nothing to do 
with spirituality, although one could argue that everything is spiritual.

 Yes tantra can and usually includes the physical but not always.

there is nothing new about the new age...just new packaging of old ideas
unless we are lost in semantic misunderstandings again? I was a new ager
for years and moved onto what i consider to be really new and different.

get over what? Do women need different treatment when they are pregnant
or should we treat them like a man and expect them to be at 
work like every one else? I think in some situations women need
special treatment because of there gender such as pregnancy.
ANd the same can be said of men in certain situation. 
My point to all of this is that equal is not as simple as it sounds.
Because there are major differences in women and men you cant
make blanket statements that we all need to be treated the same.
Things like equal pay and equal rights are pretty obvious but
i feel we need to look at our differences also if we are going to create
a society where everyones need are met.

No that is not what i was saying.

now put those last two statements together and you might understand what im 
saying. In some situations we need different treatment(pregnancy and sex for 
example) 
and in some we need 
equal( such as pay and respect)
Im just trying to figure it all out.

What a perfect opportunity for a BSP... :)

Tonight at Static, we present a special One Trak Mind night featuring djs
Kit Clayton, Positive P, Marcus M, and Knat FM.  You may remember OTM from
such films as "A Diet for the Sick" starring Richie Hawtin and "3000"
starring DJ Godfather (Detroit) and Heather Heart (NYC).  <that was a
pathetic Simpsons reference for you junkies out there...>

Also featured will be guest dj Monty, of Justice League and Mad fame...

Should be some great tunes blaring out of Liquid tonight... feel free to
introduce yourself if you haven't met me before.  I'll most likely be at
the door taking your MONEY :)

.(snip)...................

i fully agree... and i know that we do develop a sixth sense of who is
being genuine and who is not (this goes back to the age and maturity
theme... the more experience a person has in dealing in the world, the
faster that he or she can accurately read a situation intuitively)...

and i think that someone following you around, or blowing on your neck,
touching you or whatever, is completely out of line...  and i believe that
women MUST LEARN to speak up for themselves... to turn and face the
harrasser and say "do not do that, stop it now" and do that without
embarrassment or timidity... because you have a right to protect your
personal space.

if someone is hassling you, then stand up for yourself....  (and still keep
in mind that even the obnoxious people will be grateful if you don't
publicly embarrass them.... maybe there's a way to say what you need to and
still educate them in the process)...

i think you mean Ted Bundy.... (for a second there, i was thinking of Al
Bundy, and wondering which girls thought he was nice guy!  ;^) .... and in
cases of true danger, i agree that you must err on the side of caution...
which  means don't go home with strangers, don't hitchhike, and listen to
your intuition...

but don't let it make you suspect everyone you meet and color how you
perceive the world you live in... because chances are that the people
you're going to be meeting are not serial killers...

>you can never be too careful.  i'd rather miss out on the love of my life,
>then end up a victim.

but it doesn't have to be all or nothing... there is a huge middle ground
here... being trusting without being naive, being respectful without being
disrespected, and being open without being foolish.

and i would hope that when the love of your life comes up and says "have we
met before, you look familiar" ... your intuition will tell you that it's
coming from someone you need to know, and you hopefully haven't let the
annoying clubster mackers make you so cynical and distrustful that you blow
him off.....  because i think it's better to not be victimized by fear than
to miss the love of your life.

maybe i'm just a romantic at heart.

STATIC

I will most likely be wearing a Detroit Red Wings jersey (white w/
red trim) and #19 and "Yzerman" on the back.

NEW YEARS QUANDARY

New Years Resolution is going on new years, and looks good (Derrick
May, Spacetime Continuum, Astral Matrix, Funky TT, etc.), but it's 
also co-sponsored by Spacechildren (Spice Children?), and everything
I've ever heard about them (this list and elsewhere) makes it sound
like they're total hacks in it for the money only.  I guess the 
question here is whether or not to take the big chance on this party
or find elsewhere to celebrate.  Ideas?

Cheers,
Steve.

there is a big difference between sensuality and sex or sexuality.  I
think raves are very sensualy, if sex comes from it that is ok.  With me
that is usually days down the road or back at my place and not on the spot
it would be too anticlimatic. At a rave I want to experience the person's
mind and play with the atmosphere.  If people at a rave dropped down and
had sex right next to me I might laugh and just go on with whatever I was
doing, to each their own.  But over all I think sensuality has a much
bigger palce at a rave then sex.

A little birdy told me that Gateway Systems will be throwing a New Years
Party as well, which will be a 100% benefit for Dennis Peron's campaign for
governor (founder of the Cannabis Buyers Club).  A much better way to spend
your money than for greedy rave promoters.  Stay tuned for more info...

well,
not everyone at the place was dancing but the
dancefloor such as it was was crowded with danicing
people- not only that but beyond race was getting
down in another room.

There was one a time when sex was considered a sacred act.

It was done in the tantric temples as a way to celebrate and practice our
spirituality.

Today it has degenerated into a physical act alone...often lacking
in any spiritual aspect at all. That is why we feel shame about
it....because we have forgotten how sacred it is.

Many feel it is time we remember those sacred ways of celebrating life.

perhaps raving is an early experiment in finding new ways to
revive that.

or maybe not...what do you think?

I think that sex lies within the eye of the individual.
I Personally feel that sex can be EITHER physical,
sacred, or flat out Kinky.  The relationship that you
have with a person is directly reflected through the 
intimate moments that you have.  

Those are my thoughts and that's about it folks

Mushiness ahead... :)

Sex is "Physical", Making love is "Spiritual" and "Deeply Emotional". This
is where I define the two. *Making love* is what it's all about. The
connection you make with the person you love. The way that physical
world and time fades away,.. and all that matters is the two of you as
you become one. Your human eyes are shut, your spiritual eyes are open 
to the beauties within yourself and the other person. You're both there for 
eachother as well as for yourselves. You're thinking of the other person's
feelings and how to make them reach higher levels of pleasure..... this
is making love. Sex is getting off, anyone can have sex, but only special 
people can trully make love. This is my opinion... and why I don't pick up 
people from clubs, raves, etc. If you want to see the true meaning you
have to respect yourself, the other person and everything that you both
stand for. Take the time to know the person and see how beautiful they
truly are. Then when you reach the point at which you want to take it to
that level it will be so beautiful... nothing on Earth compares to this.
"Let it happen naturally".. what's the rush??.. if you really care for
that person there is no need to hurry... appreciate them and everything
about them....  

Falling asleep with the one one you love (all warm and cuddly) while
"making spoons"(as Favian from Pulp Fiction put it) is the greatest
Ecastcy you could ever feel.....   sigh. :)

ps. The sky looks so beautiful today....... no smog... thanks El Nino.

-->The constitution was originally meant to apply to land owning white
male citizens of the US only, excluding women, slaves, and indentured
servants--why do you think the whole equal rights and feminist movements
began; because the interpretations of the constitution were so narrow.
That's why amendments were passed; to make the document more applicable to
modern views.  There is still debate concerning interpretations of certain
passages of the constitution as the national rifle association likes to
point out (e.g. the gun ownership clause for national defense).  The
constitution is only a figurehead, it has changed and evolved so much over
the passage of time that it really isn't what it was before.  And like I
said, its original purpose and drafting was meant to protect the interests
of the American elite.
	Yes, Darwin is suspect; not to mention Cpt. Cook, Columbus, and
Vasco de Gamma in "discovering" new worlds inhabited by "savages". How's
that for an equalizer?  In the same vein, Nazi experiments on
concentration camp victims has advanced medical knowledge dramatically
from what it was before (in respect to pre-WWII medical knowledge); yeah
you can pick and choose were you get your facts from and what you want to
see, just be sure to realize that sometimes the facts aren't as sterile
and clean as they appear--the marks of a good indoctrination program.

email's a tough one. speaking for myself, i often read very quickly, and
respond just as quickly. not that this is a good thing. it's also hard to
see/read nuances that the voice and facial expression usually communicate.
add the two together - you're more than likely to get misunderstood. the
thing about email, too, tho is that it's (at least for me) just as easy to
see where i've gone wrong (ie flamorama) and just as easy to correct
myself.

-->Sorry about the confusion B.A., but I meant it as a reply to John Lee's
post; I just replied to the post and didn't notice it was addressed to you
until too late.  
	I don't subscribe to the whole "whitey is out to get you"
mentality.  People are people and people tend to congegrate with people
sharing similar traits; whether it be America, Germany, or Japan,
outsiders will have more challenges to face than the endemic population in
reaching success.  From personal experience, being different is difficult
and you have to be damn strong to withstand all the bullshit that comes
with it.  I might as well be speaking about skin color, but I am talking
about something as inoxious as hair color; I have always followed my own
pjerogative in issues of image...and when I had technicolor hair people
thought I was a social deviant and anything I had to say was meaningless,
not to mention that my intelligence was questionable. I still keep my own
counsel about my issues of identity, and I periodically change chameleon
colors, but I have learned how people think, and I realize how valuable my
self-integrity really is...no matter what other people say.

heya megan....

this must be the most confusing thing i have to come to grips with in my
life. maybe all women?? why does wanting equal *rights* automatically throw
chivalry out the window? in a way, i see chivalry as a high respect for a
woman. you know, i think it's this country. european women (check out the
french) can be extremely powerful, command respect, and yet still be a
_woman_ - sexy, strong, intelligent, beautiful - and turns heads for all of
those reasons. i don't see that as hypocritical at all. just as you show
respect for an elder differently than you might a colleague, you can show
respect differently for women than you would for a man. it's also
situational. in any case, i don't see chivalry as being sexist. (but i
don't see placing a hand on my ass as being chivalrous, either... :P) what
is it they say - celebrate diversity - no shit. and respect it. has
_nothing_ to do with equal rights.

anyway... cheers!

[preface: every year my dad and his friends go to Las Vegas for the 
National Finals Rodeo. This year they invited me. This is highly NRR, 
although I did try go clubbing, as discussed below]

So, Las Vegas.

I think Las Vegas is absolutely amazing. It's so impressively American to 
take a desolated stretch of sand and gravel, and turn it into a 
+destination+ for all types of people, and to turn it into one of the 
most economically vibrant cities in the world despite having no natural 
resources. Not to mention turning it into an eeriliy beautiful place 
despite having very little natural beauty.

On Saturday night I went to the National Finals Rodeo (which is the 
grand puba of rodeos, held every year in UNLV's basketball stadium) with 
my dad, uncle Steve, and four of their wanna-be-cowboy friends/business 
associatess from Alberta. Everybody was pretty drunk, and all seven of us 
crammed into a rental car, everyone making jokes about each others' 
wives/sexual dysfunctions, and everyone giving my dad a hard time 
about his driving.

Got to the rodeo. everybody was wearing a comboy hat (save me,  who 
borrowed a cowboy shirt to try to fit in, but my jenkos 
were a giveaway, and would actually come back to haunt me again later 
that same night). The rodeo was rad, a lot like a circus, in that 
it was men doing tricks and battling animals. Except of course there was 
a shiny new belt buckle in it for the most impressive performances.

Racially poignant note: the only black man I saw the whole night was the 
rodeo clown in the barrel, who's responsible for distracting the steers 
during the bronc-riding competition (that's the one where there's lots of 
cowboys gored and trampled). hmmm......

After the rodeo, we went to some sort of rodeo awards ceremony at the 
Gold Coast Casino... lots of twenty-somethings. The most surprising thing 
to me was that the women wore reasonable and often really sexy clothes, 
but most also had big golden belt buckles. Including the ladies at the 
table next to us. Talk about strange parity: at one table a cute, 
21-year-old cowgirl, her mom and her mom's trashy friend, and right next 
door, me, my dad, and my dad's crazy 
gentleman/redneck/comedian/hard-drinking/50-year-old friend, this guy 
Laverne. Laverne is totally flirting with the trashy friend, and gets her 
two-stepping out on the dance floor, and it's the most natural thing in 
the world that I need to ask the cute cowgirl to dance too, except I 
haven't two-stepped in years, so I have to phrase it in terms of "will 
you teach me to dance like that". 

Of course, I have a natural groove-on, so in no time we're swirling 
through the crowd of cow folk, my jenkos sailing gracefully through the 
sea of uber-tight Wranglers (official sponsor of the NFR, of course).

Laverne and I, lady killers that we are, wore out all the competition. By 
4:30am my dad, uncle, their friends, and pretty much everyone else had 
cleared out. Unfortunately, Laverne, with his continual stream of 
hand-kissing and off-color jokes, also wore out the ladies, and so we 
were left listening to an Albertan country band in the wee hours.

(digression: The steel guitair is the most amazing instrument in the 
world. I remember me and all my friends used to make fun of it in high 
school because it had so many "hick" associations. I've now decided that 
it's just waiting to be repurposed for drum 'n' bass glory.)

On my way into town from the airport, the taxi driver told me the _only_ 
club in Vegas was at the Rio, so Laverne and I staggered over there. 
Totally different scene, really cosmopolitan club fashions. We got to the 
door, and of course, my "loose pants" violated the dress code, and they 
wouldn't let me in. Bastards. I wonder if a "no-loose-pants" rule is 
specifically aimed at ravers? I mean, who else wears loose pants?

Anyhow, that was pretty much my trip. Came back to the hotel at day-break, 
slept a couple hours, and then jetted back to SFO. 

-cowboy radon

ps. anyone know of the existence of a rave scene in Nevada? (meant to ask 
that before I went, but I'm still curious...)

Being pregnant is something that during early phases of it, even the woman
is often unsure.  People used to use the "monthly visitor" & pregnancy
arguements to keep women out of the workplace or assert differences
between the sexes to warrant other unequal treatment...  get wise. You're
spouting the party line as fed to us by the people we inherited this
bullshit from.

Pregnancy is NOT part of being a woman, it is part of being a biological
mother, it is an option, and in modern society a condition of choice... 
so treating all women differently because some might CHOOSE to get
pregnant is pretty damn backwards.  My mother, 2 pregnancies included, has
probably taken less sick days off than most people in her field of work,
and fought uphill all the way to get where she is, because it's so easy
for a sexist VP to decide between mommaW and Mr. Man when that critical
management position opens up and they're mumbling in the urinal stalls
about mommaW taking off for maternity leave or some other "crazy woman
thing" (eventually, years later, she got it, and hasn't let anyone down,
cause she's my mom, and she rocks).

We just had a programmer work until the day she went into labor, and the
child was like, turbo healthy (despite the "where is the water going to
break" office betting pool). She and her husband are now taking turns
staying home with the baby, both raising what should be a most loved and
cared for opportunity for the growth of a bright, strong individual, just
like his parents.  And, thanks to her career choice of being a coder, we
still get work from her when she's at home, so she's still getting paid
the same, and baby gets to play with mommy OR daddy (depending on the day)
and get held and all that good stuff.

To advance, sometimes we need to let go of the old ideas... 

Peace,
AndyW

p.s. I think I understand what you meant about diversity and differences,
I wouldn't yell "go long" and throw her a soda from the lunch truck, or
ask her to play softball in the company tournament this year, but I wanted
to point out that even being pregnant can have a negligible effect on job
performance in many fields, or a great majority of the other metrics we
use to establish personal worth in modern society.  Without uniformity we
cannot be equal in every aspect, but we should be given equal opportunity
and not base our perception of a set on the attributes of a subset (i.e.
using pregnant women to make arguements about women in general). 
     If PLUR is what the scene is about, which letter stands for Music?

you know, being a white male from the south, i have to admit - and it
pains me to say this because it's not at all what i'm about - but yes
indeed, whitey _is_ out to get you.  i heard shit all the time from
average joe whiteguys that made me cringe.  and i don't really think
it's all that different outside of the south. 

of course, the flip side to this is that, despite this sad fact, the
u.s. has to be one of the least racist places in the entire world.  i
mean, in india, if you look hard enough, you can tell what kind of job
a person has just by looking at their facial structure and the subtle
differences in skin shade - it's that segregated (at least that's what
i perceived after nearly a year there).  whereas the u.s. must have
been one of, if not _the_ first place in the world to pass something
like the civil rights act (not to mention women's suffrage).  imagine,
a democratically elected government passing a law that made racism
_illegal_.  what a grand concept!  i'd venture to say it's somewhat
unique to this country.  and while it doesn't surprise me that the
problem hasn't been solved in the last 30 years, i have great hopes
that the ideal will be realized one day.

i see it this way - if you grew up say, maybe 500 years ago, and you
saw a group of people approaching with even slightly different facial
features than you, well, chances were pretty good they were going to
try to kill you.  and even if they weren't, you needed to keep your
guard up, the bottom line was they were from another tribe.  this is a
broad generalization, and i know some of you could point out
exceptions etc, but i honestly believe that this was the reality for
most people when dealing with people of other races.  so basically, i
think fear of other races goes back very deeply into just about
everyone's culture, perhaps to the point of instinct.

i mean, in europe 50 years ago french were still killing germans were
still killing english were still killing over RACE (even though they
were all white).  meanwhile in america, does anyone _really_ still
give a shit if your parents were italian or irish or french german
whatever?  hell most of us are all racially mixed mutts at this point.
 and i see the same thing continuing to happen with immigrants
entering the country now, even though most of them aren't european.

my country strikes me as a grand experiment at this point - take
humans of all different races, people who since they first became
different have been warring with each other, and stick 'em in the same
country.  preferably in the same neighborhood.  can we all get along? 
will we all one day truly melt together in one big pot?  personally i
think it's inevitable - it's harder to hate someone when you see them
and talk to them every day. 

it obviously hasn't happened yet.  but i think discussions like these
are an integral part of the process.

christ i should write speeches.  this sounds like something the
valedictorian would read at his graduation.  oh well, i've been
reading the invisible man and this stuff has been on my mind...

wow, glad to know i'm not the only one out there with SEX on my mind...

hmmmm, so many SEX discussions i hardly know where to start.  

tantric SEX and SEXy ravers...  well, i see a big connection here. 
for centuries the christian church has been telling us that dancing
was evil.  it's been frowned on in this culture for ages.  it's low,
uncultured, dirty.  well thankfully we're (western culture) beginning
to discover that dancing is actually lots of fun.  the more the
better, all night long.  and as we loose our hangups about dancing we
begin to realize that its not dirty at all.  in fact, it can be quite
spiritual.  it can change your life.  it can make you SEE GOD. 
especially if you're candyflipping.  well, the same goes for SEX.

and i think i see this realization reflected in raver culture as well.
 you can't deny that there's a big sexy vibe at a lot of raves (and
i'm not just saying that cause of the ginseng) people kissing hugging
necking speakerhumping massaging dancing fucking...  i think all those
tight little sexy outfits girls wear reflect a celebration of SEX. 
it's ok to be SEXy, you don't have to hide it.  it's ok to walk up and
kiss some guy you think is attractive, it's natural, SEX is natural,
it's not dirty it's the most amazing thing imaginable...

that doesn't mean that raves are all about getting laid, mind you.  i
think clubs are like these places where people who want sex are
segregated to.  and it's seen as sort of nasty to go there.  "1015? 
ech, that place is a meat market."  even when you go through the
accepted outlets to sate your natural desire, it's still unclean.  i
want to have SEX, therefore i am a piece of meat.

at raves SEX is just accepted as something thats not only ok, but
good.  the fact that there's such a SEXual atmosphere without it
turning into some big, well, meatmarket, shows a level of maturity
towards SEX that i suspect most people over 30 will never reach in
their lifetimes...

did you know that many other countries consider the u.s. to be one of
the most UPTIGHT places in the world?  bad enough being christians, we
had to be founded by _puritans_.  the hang-ups still linger on today. 
if we think SEX is dirty, how does that make us feel about babies?  do
we hate ourselves because we are "born of sin"?  how sad, it's
surprising we haven't just died out and left the world to people who
know how good SEX is...

that's THE main reason i decided that the we all need a new religion
(and i'm the guy to found it).  it's high time we stopped thinking
that sex was dirty.  when i start my own church, it's gonna be about
seeing god first hand, through meditation, dancing, drugs, isolation
tanks, surfing, and generaly throwing big parties.

but mostly through SEX.

Yes there is i have been meaning to post something about that
but have been debating due to complaints about discussing spiritual
stuff on sfraves and the fact that astrology doesnt work anyway =)

any one interested in the incredible stuff happening in the stars
over the next few months, let me have your email address and
i will add it too my astrology\renaisance/peace/art newsletter.

Just breifly for those that are interested... neptune
is about to move into aquarius and we have just had
a unique lineup of all the planets and jupiter
is moving into pisces. We are about to witness
something truely incredible.

Mercury just went retrograde so communications will be screwwy
for the next three weeks and people will be very strange and tense.
Stick to routine and take lots of deep breathes and dont get freaked
when things dont work out as planned. If you are traveling, even
short distances allow some extra time. This is a great time for
introspection.

send me your email address if you want to hear more about this
as i have been trying to limit my astological postings here.

I suggest you take a walk through the neigborhood I just moved out of
then(West Oakland.) The simple fact is that people, no matter what the
color of their skin can be *very* intolerant of people that are not like
them.

Geez,

At this point this is like a soap opera.  But you know what?  I'm glad I've
spoken up about it, and plan to continue to do so until there is justice.
I'm not only talking about myself.  As I said before my problem is but one
of a myriad of problems at VSF.  I know this much.  The dialog we have had
here has gone *far* beyond this list.  It has reached the owner and plenty
of party people on and off the list.  Like I said when I started this is
far from over.

Anyway I talked with preston this evening (remember I am not adressing the
other problems, he is well aware of them, I am addressing *my* predicament
and looking for a solution/answer), and he indicated, in certain ways, the
noise was getting to him.  He will be talking with VSF, the security and
it's owners next week Tuesday.  Afterwhich , he promised, to call me up
thereafter (i.e. right after the meeting).  He still thinks that the
problem isn;t so much a racil one as it is a general security problem, and
I have no reason to doubt he beleives this.  I, on the other hand am
looking for one thing, and answer as to why *I*, out of the hundreds of
crackerjacks, was seen as too drunk.  At a Stompy?  The thing is Stompy is
a very, very, propular party.  People, like myself, go to Stompy to relax,
be themselves, and blow off some steam in what is considered to be a safe,
and very fun environment.  This security incident casts a deep pall with
VSF, and by virtue of he and his crew having a party there, Stompy as well.

I told Preston that I would not step foot one in his club until I could
have assurances that I would be left alone.  I can't step into his party
always looking over my shoulder, being overly concious of everything I do,
and generally not being able to relax due to a fear of being thrown out
(It's would be like walking the Haight at 3 a.m.).  Hell, Stompy is *my*
party too, and if I can't feel at home there why come?  I think others feel
the same way.  If security is looking for problems then  how can anyone
relax?  Like I said it is a larger issue, and it is concerns Stompy's goal.
If the goal is to provide a space for people to have a good time, then they
must be extra vigilant in creating a vibe conducive for people to do so.
Security shouldn't impede the fun, period.  Fights never break out at
Stompy, you'll never see more smiles and laughing people.  You'll never see
more beautiful people there to see other beautiful people (why do people go
to stompy, to see everyone else who went to stompy, a voyeurs delight).  I
mean Stompy is a people party.  VSF, in it's current state, completely
ruins that vibe.  If not now, certainly when the next party comes (are they
gonna be that hard assed during New Year's?  I hope not).  Security should
have a very light hand, unfortunately for some patrons we have seen the
opposite.

I will keep you all tuned in to what is going on behind the scenes with
this.  Hopefully Stompy & VSF can get their collective act together.
Preston understands how vital this is.  I await  next Tuesday with baited
breath.

As for me, I would paraphrase a certain something I heard the other day,
quite appropriate, "I'm not innocent, but I am far from being guilty!"

peace,
John

funny, I liked his view of the military, vary close to my own.  Perhaps I can
thanks my ex-berkeley hippy parents for that.  Maybe having that view of the
military is just a healthy way of staying alive. :)

No offense to any pro-military people... and I do realize they keep us free

I was recently at a party wearing a dress and dancing, and when I went to
get a drink some guy hit on me by asking me about my orientation and
telling me I looked really good in the dress -- then he got flustered and
said it really worked for him.

I was actually going to go for it until I heard him talking to someone
about how he'd punched someone that day... and then he started getting
agressive and, needless to say, I didn't go with him (he kept talking
about getting a limo and going to some party, somewhere, he wasn't sure
where or what -- probably another bad sign).

That's actually the only time I've been hit on at a party or rave (not
that I've been to many... yet).

My favorite "pickup" line (I'm not sure this really counts, but...) is the
one my partner used on me -- we were talking about hanging out and watching
a movie, which we'd done before, and she told me "You know, this is going
to be a date."   I really like honesty and directness...

brief synopsis of what I read of this conversation:

>>From Steve:
>>New Years Resolution...looks good (Derrick
>>May, Spacetime Continuum, Astral Matrix, Funky TT, etc.), but it's
>>also co-sponsored by Spacechildren...sound
>>like they're total hacks in it for the money only....

Indeed, Space Children (or at least one of two people behind it, who may as
well remain nameless) does seem misgiuded. Even in talking to him, though,
I'm unwilling to judge and say the evil two words (sell-out). He does seem
opportunistic, but he has good taste, charges "industry-standard" prices
and has not made the gargantuan sums of cash you might expect...he makes a
living, from what I can tell. And anybody else in the scene does the
same...That kind-heartedness aside, they sometimes totally fuck up the vibe
of a party, but a word to the wise: Derrick May NEVER lets a crowd down,
whether that crowd is 10,000 people, 5000, 500 or a dozen. He is the Vibe
Master, the best DJ I've ever heard/seen/felt/dug...and even in the face of
a failing sound system can resurrect the vibe within minutes. When people
say, "It's all about the music" which I think most of us who believe in the
scene feel, then Derrick is a living example of that philosophy.

>100% benefit for Dennis Peron's campaign for
>governor (founder of the Cannabis Buyers Club).  A much better way to spend
>your money than for greedy rave promoters.

Agreed: Promotion of marijuana causes is a delightfully intelligent and
good way to
spend money. But there are plenty of good people doing that who are doing
it within a mindset of practicality (including Dennis Peron himself in
other of his activities). In other words (oh no, classic pessimist argument
coming up) he stands no chance in the governor's race. Obviously. But what
CAN be achieved, (so this classic and perrenial train of thought goes)  is
a wider awareness for the issues of marijuana law reform. Unfortunately,
the rest of California is not as enlightened as we in the
Beautiful Bay and will squash it as a governor's campaign. Ah, but the
myriad other pro-pot groups (both underground as well as NORML) could stand
to profit if the money was given to them, instead of potentially
squandering it on a perfectly intentioned but probably futile political
race that
could take votes away from mainstream, admittedly dull and essentially
conservative liberals who could then lose to the likes of another Pete
Wilson (aghghghghghgh!!!).

All this aside, it's only a New Years party...but 1) I would put my
pot-law-reform money elsewhere for greater effect (maybe even other of
Peron's activities!) and 2) wouldn't miss out on the techno vibe wizardry
of 3 hours of Derrick May with a view of SF in the background.

and now i'm in a really good mood despite my extremely dangerous set of
final examinations because XGrRLsTrX has identified the track i have so
desperately racked my brain for.

Komakino's "Outface," in case anyone else was puzzled as well.

nothing left to do but:

<><><><><><><><>
Shout out!  for the long lives you've lived before this day and the things
you've done and the beautiful tender kisses you've given!

Stare at a dusty window watching the rain mercilessly hack at the ground
and admire its cold chaotic rhythmic drumline.

Very quietly go insane while waiting to hear from the one you love, and
jumping with delicious tension at every ear-piercing ring of the laughing,
all-knowing telephone.

Cast a spell and summon dark forces from dimensions beyond ours to do your
nefarious bidding, only to be foiled by the heroic efforts of a
spandex-clad superhero.

Slump against a speaker and hug someone so tightly and cry the happiest
tears as the 303's filters open so wide and the BPM climbs to infinity.

Sit on the now-empty bed and watch the plumes of smoke rising from two
cigarettes, one smoldering in the ashtray with lipstick on its filter, look
at the open door and listen to Bauhaus telling you just how dead Bela
Lugosi is while you wonder if maybe you shouldn't have made love to her
quite so soon and watching the sun come up and people just starting to go
to work as your cigarette sends up a strand of pyrolized tobacco that at
some perfect absolute moment undergoes a wondrous chaotic change and
becomes a plethora of silky swirls and think to yourself that sooner or
later you'll go outside but for now it's just time to sit quietly and
breathe in the fading aroma of perfume on your sheets as the sound of auto
noise starts to rise inexorably and monday starts up with a vengeance.

Skip stones all day and finally get a four-skipper.  Roll in the sand for a
bit, then go home to start setting up the sound system.

But most importantly, run outside with a fistful of #2 pencils, throw them
as far as you can and yell

"I'M DONE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

<><><><><><><><><><><>

soon enough, beautiful wonderful and ultimately really stressed people,
soon enough.

i don't think there's much of a scene intrinsic to nevada, but some of
those los angeles desert parties (YAY!!!) are so far up the 215 North that
they might as well be nevada parties. *sigh*

I decided to add the pick-up line that really worked on me..

I was having a pretty bad week.. and was Dancing for much needed 
therapy. It was still early in the evening, and the dance floor was 
pretty empty. Next time I look up three girls have surrounded me on 
the dance floor..  and one of them comes up and asks.. "We were just 
wondering. How much are they (the club) paying you to dance here?"

That just made my day.. The troubles from the week before vanished, 
forgotten for the duration of the evening. I was finaly free to enjoy 
the evening.

THE 12 DAYS OF CHRISTMAS....


December 14th


Dearest John:

I went to the door today and the postman delivered a partridge in a pear =
tree. What a delightful gift. I couldn't have been more surprised.


With dearest love and affection, Agnes
--------------------------------------
December 15th

Dearest John:


Today the postman brought your very sweet gift. Just imagine, two turtle =
doves.... I'm just delighted at your very thoughtful gift. They are just =
adorable.

All my love, Agnes
------------------
December 16th
Dear John:

Oh, aren't you the extravagant one! Now I must protest. I don't deserve =
such generosity. Three french hens. They are just darling but I must =
insist.... you're just too kind.

Love Agnes
---------
December 17th

Today the postman delivered four calling birds. Now really! They are =
beautiful, but don't you think enough is enough? You're being too =
romantic.

Affectionately, Agnes
---------------------
December 18th

Dearest John:

What a surprise! Today the postman delivered five golden rings. One for =
each finger. You're just impossible, but I love it. Frankly, John, all =
those squawking birds were beginning to get on my nerves.


All my love, Agnes
------------------
December 19th

Dear John:

When I opened the door there were actually six geese a-laying on my =
front steps. So you're back to the birds again, huh? Those geese are =
huge. Where will I ever keep them? The neighbors are complaining and I =
can't sleep through the racket. PLEASE STOP!

Cordially, Agnes
----------------

December 20th

John:

What's with you and those fucking birds???? Seven swans a-swimming. What =
kind of goddam joke is this? There's bird shit all over the house and =
they never stop the racket. I'm a nervous wreck and I can't sleep all =
night. IT'S NOT FUNNY.......So stop with those fucking birds.

Sincerely, Agnes
----------------
December 21st

OK Buster:

I think I prefer the birds. What the hell am I going to do with eight =
maids a-milking? It's not enough with all those birds and eight maids =
a-milking, but they had to bring their own goddam cows. There is shit =
all over the lawn and I can't move into my own house. Just lay off me. =
SMART ASS.

Ag
----------------
December 22nd


Hey Shithead:

What are you? Some kind of sadist? Now there's nine pipers playing. And =
Christ - do they play. They never stopped chasing those maids since they =
got here yesterday morning. The cows are upset are stepping all over =
those screeching birds. No wonder they screeh. What am I going to do? =
The neighbors have started a petetion to evict me. You'll get yours.


>From Ag
----------------
December 23rd

You Rotten Prick:

Now there's ten ladies dancing - I don't know why I call those sluts =
ladies. They've been balling those nine pipers all night long. Now the =
cows can't sleep and they've got diarrhea. My living room is a river of =
shit. The commisioner of buildings has subpoenaed me to give cause why =
the building shouldn't be condemned. I'm sicking the police on you.

One who means it, Ag
--------------------
December 24th

Listen Fuckhead:


What's with the eleven lords a-leaping on those maids and aforementioned =
"ladies"? Some of those broads will never walk again. Those pipers ran =
through the maids and have been commiting sodomy with the cows. All 234 =
of the birds are dead. They have been trampled to death in the orgy. I =
hope you're satisfied, you rotten swine.


Your sworn enemy, Miss Agnes McCallister
--------------------------------------

hey. if *you* want to carry around a _baby_ in your belly and then have to
*push*it*out* with your muscles, go for it. get your body all stretched
out, get sick in the mornings, and have to deal with your hormones taking
you on an emotional rollercoaster... more power to you, buddy. we do it
*and* we work, and you know what? we *glow* all the way through it.

this is true. but even if it were, don't you think we deserve to use our
holidays to have a baby? do men not benefit from us bearing their children?

There's also no doubt that individual men and women are different from
other men and women resp..

The variance (or even the st. dev.) within each gender is much larger than
the differences between them -- so we could, rather than talking about
statistical differences, talk about similarities in terms of the range
of behavior.  Especially if you consider many of the statistical
differences to be socially constructed rather than biologically
inhereted...

I'm quite dubious of different-but-equal arguments -- while I agree
with them in principal, I've seen little to convince me that our
society (specifically the USA, late 90s) is capable of respecting
them... the closest thing you can see is the use of 'exchange value'
to put people (employees) within a social structure which
theoretically gives them equal opportunities.  Of course,
statistically speaking, people of different gender and racial or
class backgrounds do not have equal opportunities, so I don't buy
this either.

Also, like it or not, different-but-equal arguments are easily used
by those who agree that men and women are different but feel this
means they should be treated differently -- consider the Promise
Keepers (and, generally, the religious right, amoung others, not all
of them conservative).

I'm not saying there's anything wrong with enjoying gender -- I get a
kick out of playing both butch and femme, as well as watching others
perform these roles... I just prefer to see them as socially constructed
roles (rather than anything biological) which people of either biological
gender can perform.

What are you talking about?

You will be sure to send out some mix to all the people that answered your
question theroughly? Why don't you send your mix out to whomever want's it?
I don't know what your talking about though. I don't want no copy of
whatevah anyways. And if I have to listen to this guy complain on the phone
for five more frickin minutes of my morning, I am going to kick somebodies
ass.

DJ Mix questionair. Hah.
Everyone want's to be a DJ these days. It's funny, all the people with big
mouths will get the gig's I am sure. Quiet people like myself with actual
TALENT will not get recognized. Aslong as I can make atleast myself feel
good mixing, and my friends. It's all good though.

Yep.

I agree with Molly. while it's a wonderful and beautiful moment
when you can acheive something more, i don't see anything
wrong with just having fun.

actually, i don't see anything in general wrong with having fun.
it seems to me that people look at life so seriously when in
reality it is pretty bizarre and silly.

something can be sacred depending on the individual - to one
person a quick fling might be sacred while to another a loving
experience......

i think perhaps it's the word "sacred" that i'm having a problem
with.....because that implies that people do not treat sex that
way now....but how can you say what is "sacred" and what is not?
maybe to them, their casual attitudes about sex are better than
treating it as something more than the physical......

our society has such a huge hang-up about sex- they censor
discussions of it in school and the media, yet use it to sell
products......you can't have condoms in schools, but you
can have cheerleaders with short-short skirts....seems
to me that everything in our culture makes a big deal out
of sex in its own way

anyway i'm kinda rambling here so will shut up now

I guess I am all alone here, but I honestly do not believe there
is any difference between men and women other than their
physical bodies. It is my belief that the reason they act "differently"
is due to how they are raised from birth and the expectations that
other people/our society has of them.

For example, I do not believe that women just have a natural desire
to play with barbies, or that boys just have an instinct to get matchbox
cars, yet their parents often act as though they do.

I do not agree at all that they should be treated differently. It's all
a sort of big cycle. You treat people differently, so they act as though
they are different from each other, when in fact they are not, so you
assume that their behavior is an innate quality, and then treat them
differently.

I'm not denying their are physical differences, but I do not consider
one's physical form to be very relevant to how you treat their Mind.

I definitely do not agree in the phrase "different but equal". That is like
saying kids in special education are looked on as "different but equal"
or that people of color are treated as "different but equal". I guess I am
opening up a big can of worms so to speak but that phrase really
bothers me!!!!

I never personally have been hit on in an interesting enough
way to comment on at a rave.

But my ex boyfriend told me he used to use this line
when he dj'ed...

"Hey cutie! Do you want to come over to my house
and help me make a mix tape?"

ahhahahah

sorry, I just can't help but liking the list too much-temporary moment 
of insanity-so I farted in the wind and it smelled for two whole days, 
but the smell is gone and I have returned in it's place.  I blame the 
holidaze and the huge bag of cookie dough that I devoured.
hi,

you have a point. or part of one. i don't think anyone could make an
argument against societal "programming" have an absolute influence over
the lives of those born into the society. however what you ignore is
nature. males and females exist to perpetuate the continued existance of
a species. same with humans. male and females in "natural" enviornments
follow certain instinctual behavioral patterns which differ between
genders. you can't have it both ways, being one with nature and at the
same time above it. if we are to be part of the natural order of things
we need to accept what intellectually speaking may be less desirable
charactaristics. and in accepting this i believe it just might be
possible for an indiviual or a society (maybe) to move closer towards an
ideal. but if you pretend try to sweep the dirty mess under the carpet,
it's still going to be there.

i agree. partially. play in humans and animals is a mirror of the
society that they're learning from. so are the toys aren't they.
however, i believe that girls and boys will gravitate to the activities
that will define them in their gender roles.

again, i agree, especially when teaching kids to accept the world around
them and those who populate it. they will emmulate or develope
prejudices based on what they're shown.

> 
for the sake of symantics and open discussion i don't think it's
appropriate to avoid defining phrasology because it's uncomfortable,
particularly when it just may be an accurate summary. i'm not just
playing devil's advocate here, i do believe that genetic differences in
gender make up for psycho-social behavior differences as well.

sometimes i think we just have to weigh the positives and the negatives and
the price of sexual inequality...

and frankly, i'd be very willing to trade in a couple of million times of
having some man hold open a door for me ....

if only my mother's life could have been as important in my family as my
father's, so she could have had a career like he did and not have been left
to work a minimum wage job when he moved on to someone else...

or if my 89-year-old friend could have expected to learn to handle the
finances and investments before her husband died and left her a potential
victim to people who would scam her....

or if i could feel secure that no matter what someone thought of me, they
didn't start of by making blanket assumptions about what i can and cannot
do because i am a woman, and who i am and am not, based on my gender.

bottom line, sexism and sexist behavior and expectations hold people back,
and therefore we're better off without it...

and that's why it is important to me to be vigilant about sexist comments
and seemingly innocent sexist behavior... because we're talking about
something that may seem trivial ("hey, i was only joking, you know"), but
in reality has profound effects on the ability for women to succeed in
their lives.

and it ain't about opening doors and lighting cigarettes.... holding a door
open for someone is about respectful behavior, that's a no-brainer...  i'll
hold a door or a lighter for a man or another woman without thinking twice
if that's what's called for... sheez.  that's just manners.


and, by the way, static was great again last night... i got to meet hai and
megan hug and steve and aminita/shira.... plus see lots of other
sfravers... but those martinis, man, are craaazy!  maybe i should just plan
to stay in the city on tuesday nights!

That's great, until you show up at the gig and pay your $25 (or
whatever)
only to find out that they cancelled Derrick May weeks ago, and then
kick you out at 4:00am.  I have no problem with oppornusm, and I don't
think anyone here does.  It's just that when somebody promises
something and then dosen't deliver, they should make at least an
attempt at reparations (ie. refunds, notice at the door before you buy
tickets that an artist isn't there, simple apology, etc.).  Not doing
so goes a bit beyond the boundaries of mere opportunism.

The idea in any election is to vote for the person who you think would
do the best job, NOT the guy you think is going to win.  If you think
Dennis Peron or Jerry Brown or Ross Perot (shudder) would be the best
for a particular job, then vote for him, even if there is no realistic
chance that he will win.  Granted, most people are sheep who do as 
they're told by a particular party dogma, but there will never be any
change in the way things work if the "fringe" candidates aren't around.
Dennis Peron may split the "liberal" vote, but he's also putting what
I see as a very important issue on the table for public debate.  I 
don't want to start a legalize/demonize pot thread here, so check
out http://www.norml.org.

Sounds great if it happens, but I'm glad I didn't go to a few
previous SpaceChildren deals, given the horror stories I've heard
(and so have you).

well... physical bodies dictate how the brain has been formed... no, they
are not shaped differently... but i believe that studies have shown that
they do indeed work differently.  wish i could give you some actual
references... (wrote a term paper on the differences/similarities of
men/women- these resources may have been old, but i don't think THAT much
has changed in these sort of studies since 1991).
I will admit that these studies may have been swayed due to nurture... but
i don't believe that environment has that much of an impact on a persons
sexuality... i think that genetics play a much larger roll in our
personalities and sexual behavior than you think!  
look at the studies of twins; same genetic make-up, seperated at birth, yet
when they've met up after 30 years? they show up in the same outfit, have
the same occupations, the same dreams... different environments... same
genetic make-up...

ah... but where did all of these expectations come from???
if we started the same... why are we so different now? 
and if we started different... why do you think that is?

>For example, I do not believe that women just have a natural desire

i'll agree with you there... to some extent.
BUT do you think toy manufacturers package their products to target adults?
no, they do study upon study to see what children like... and i just so
happens that girls go for the pink toys and boys go for the blue (a rough
generalization)... have you ever looked down a girls toy isle? a boys?
completely different!  and i don't believe that parents/society instill
this into their child... baby toys are all colors of the rainbow... no
premeditated sexism there.  but once they are old enough to walk down the
isles themselves... you see what children their age and sex like.  (i'm not
saying every child fits into these stereotypes... this is all just a
generalization... and i personally believe it's 40% nurture and 60%
nature... and once again- i know i am no scientist... just formed my own
educated hypothesis)

>I definitely do not agree in the phrase "different but equal". That is like
>saying kids in special education are looked on as "different but equal"
WHOA!
i _would_ say that...  whose to say that intelligence quantifies greater than?
you ask the parent of a special ed. student... and i bet they will say that
he/she is just as special as any other child... of course, we all have our
strengths and weaknesses... we are different.
i think we _are_ all equal! one may be more intelligent... but the other
may be more ________.

>or that people of color are treated as "different but equal". 
well why not?!!!

very, very basic example--> all fruits are equal... right? 
(ok, ok... just work w/ me here! :)
apples and oranges are different... right?
but whose to say that one is intrinsically better than the other?

DISCLAIMER:
all of the information mentioned above is a mish-mash of my
beliefs/veiws/thoughts... 
they may be different from kim's... but by no means more or less equal!

Ahem!  
     I want to mention that in the upcoming SF supervisorial 
There WILL be a Rave friendly candidate, he is also a self proclaimed 
pothead and a BLACK(ebonyblack) Drag Queen.

Joan Jett Black will win. And she will fight for your rights to dance in 
the street.

Like all politicians she has her down side, she wants to lower the 
drinking limit, allow smoking in bars and worse of all she is proud of 
her prejudice.

But she is a fighter. And she IS a dancer. 

email me if you want to help her get into office. Because of her 
controversial views this will be a history making grass-roots campaign.
Grass-roots means YOU get up at 7am and vote. Well, maybe for some, it 
would be go to sleep after you vote at 7am.

It's always been that way. See I view myself as a betamax quality of course,
but VHS won because more people knew about it and they bought it in mass
quantity. Yep, if you don't market yourself then you will definitely suffer
from delusions of granduer. I decided long ago that I don't want to do it for

I agree.

  I like the idea of sacred sexuality, but it doesn't work for me - it's
too serious. Besides, if sex is sacred, does that mean masturbation is
prayer? ("Now little Johnny, remember to pray before you go to bed
tonight." "Don't worry, Mom - I sure will!")

as an ex (and disgrunteled) employee of spaced children i have been 
avoiding this thread. This last show was the final straw for me.
I always worked there with the attitude that this was just a job just like
working for bill grahm or any other concert producer. I got into raving
for reasons that spaced children never supported but i thought 
that was ok, because it was just like any other job to me.
I also naievely thought i could perhaps influence things there
and maybe help move it in a different direction. I was wrong.

This last show really was just too much. I think two things 
that really opened my eyes were the fact that any woman
that wanted in free only had to flash her breasts and she got in
while the slightest hesitation of a male to pay full price was met
with security guards tossing him out the door. And then after
it was over and nobody got paid again i was told by one of the 
produceres that "its not about the money...just look at all
the hot women"

Plus i saw so many people leave with angry sad faces at being 
ripped off. The thing that really hit me most was seeing
two young people come in, lay down the $25 a piece, which 
was obviously a stain on a 18 year olds budget and then 
seeing them leave 5 min later with a look of disgust on their face.

I have treated so many people rudely at the door because "it
was my job to squeeze" every little dollar out of people and
feel horrible about some of the things i did there. I hope none
of you were victims of this and i apologize if if happened to any of you.

I knew there were problems there but i was unaware of a lot
of the things that have been discussed here. 

so i have finally decided after this last show that i will no longer
be working for them or attending any of their parties. I feel
sorry for the hundreds of people that have been ripped off by them.
 
this new years eve party is bound to be another disaster...it doesnt
take a financial wizard to figure that one out. I guess if you have 
big breasts and want a free party or want to ogle these women 
them this is the party  for you....otherwise i would suggest
you try one of the many other partys that night. And even tho
some big dj's are scheduled does not mean they will actually be there
as the word is out about the lack of payments so many performers
ask for money before they go on stage. Since there probably wont be more
than 3-400 ppl there its doughtful that there will be any money 
to pay these people.

yeah im bitter and disgruntled but facts are facts.

Actually there are some really good ppl there and potential for
them to turn things around. I really hope they wake up and do so.

I haven't called yet, I totally want to go though.  A 5 hour set by Doc
Martin!  My guess is the number(s) will be updated on the day of the show,
I've seen the rave cards all over SF and Berkely.

Nice to see you dont have a broken funny bone.
I guess as some else also pointed out, sacred
is one of those charged words that to some
equate with religion or seriousness. Not me.

Not being a religious person i cant really comment
too much on prayer but i have heard that if one...umm
"prays" enough...they do see god.

I was curious what you guys were planning on doing for New Years. Also, if
anyone has any idea how much the TrEAsurE Island thing is going to cost
I'd love to know.

I'm being driven to go to see Steve Loria for New Years. A friend of mine
gave me his mix tape from the last BY THE PEOPLE party and it's very nice.
I'm hooked. Funny how a DJ can just grab you and never let go. He's very
good. "Weeeeeeeeeeeeeee lllllllllllike to paaaaaaahhhtay!"..

i see what you're saying black adder.  i get some "racist" (i believe)
hassle walking past valencia gardens (a public housing project one
block from my apartment) on my way home sometimes.  however, currently
most power in this country is held by a small number of white males,
and i personally doubt that many of them hold the loftiest intentions
when it comes to opening that power structure to outsiders.  an
attitude which i think is all too human, and probably holds true for
just about any group at the top of any social hierarchy.  but the
thing is, i rarely hear to many of us admit to this fact.

like i was saying, i've heard some pretty bad things said by white
people regarding people of different races.  and while no one i hang
out with talks like that, i've heard it enough that i think it
reflects a very common viewpoint among "my people".  common enough
that i think the phrase "whitey is out to get you" doesn't sound as
ridiculous as it's supposed to.

See,
 I like this Robert guy. He is cool.

What about you give out your mix tape to whomever can supply you with a
blank tape?

Maybe not. Who want's to sit and record the same mix tape over and over for
400 people.


Well, I finally got off that call. I told him I would call him back.
That one seems to work often.


Peace.

True - but there's the other side of racism that a lot of people fail to
see.  It's interesting to note that race seems to be a property determined
solely by skin tone and complexion - rather than true heritage.  I won't
get into discrimination based on sexual orientation - but the more subtle
racism that I have experienced based on the difference between my genetic
heritage and my outward appearance.

I am Irish and Amerind (American Indian - Lakota Sioux), yet I appear to
be quite "white".  I have been active with several organizations to try
and preserve and teach traditional Amerind cultural values to youths of
both Amerind extraction and those who are simply interested in learning.
 Yet when I try to approach people who are potentially distant relatives,
I find hostility and anger directed towards me, as a "white guy trying to
press in on something that doesn't belong to him," even though I DO have a
right to this by lineage.

The ironic part is when I'm confronted by activists for other racial
groups - particularly those of African extraction.  I truly resent being
told that "my kind" was responsible the speaker's family's heritage in
slavery - when my own ancestors were victims of "imperialist" policies of
both British and American design, with the intent on at least one side
being genocide.

Race has become, in the words of a few journalists, a quality possesed by
anyone who is not white.  Visibly white people do not have a race - they
are simply the oppressors.  The problem this engenders is that all white
people are treated as a single class, a monolithic entity, when in fact
this is very far from the truth.

"Race" is not some club you are born into because of skin color - it is an
issue of us and them.  The solution to the "racial divide" is to stop
thinking of an us and them that is based upon appearances.  One of the
things that first drove me to pursue the rave culture, etc., was the
multi-ethnic background - how race didn't seem to be an issue.  People got
together for a different purpose, and for a moment appearances become
meaningless, melted away by the combination of music, dance, and in some
cases drugs.

When you discuss racism, consider this:  Are you talking about racism in
one person or a small group, or areyou trying to condemn the "white man"
as a whole.  And then consider those of us who are between two worlds -
too white to be permitted to learn of and experience our heritage, yet not
white enough to have the advantages of centuries of being the top dog.

Not all white guys are racist dogs out to climb a ladder greased with
minority blood.  Not all Amerinds are drunken wife-beaters that live in
tipis and hunt buffalo.  Not all Asians are brainy eggheads who take life
too seriously.  Not all Hispanics are migrant workers or drug smugglers.
 Not all Africans are gangstas or welfare mothers, living off society's
largess.

After following this thread for a while, I had to bring this up.
 Remember, plUr - Unity is VERY important.  We have transcended these
boundaries before - we can do it again.  Don't dwell too much on one
incident, though do not dismiss it too lightly.  Deal with it, and move
on.  The solution to racism is not to point fingers and shout out where
you believe racism to be - it sounds like crying wolf.  FIght racism by
building communities that cross racial boundaries, like the rave community
has been traditionally.  Focus on things, properties, interests and
achievements that bring us together, not drive us apart.  Save the
condemnation for individuals who can't embrace a new way of thinking - and
walk away from racist thought.

Racism is not just a property of the white psyche - it is a part of the
human psyche.  It can be repaired, and the damage put behind us - if we
refuse to look at the world through racially-installed filters.

(I know what's being considered - being "white" I don't know what it's
like.  Being gay, though, I do.  Wondering if a negative performance
review is a reflection of your own performance, or of your boss's dislike
of who and what you do in your own home.  I was driven out of college for
religious and sexuality-related reasons - I've walked this talk in the
past.  I won't say I know what it's like, but I've experienced similar
effects.  Common ground.)

well
isn't this the time of year when species
traditionally mate so that their offspring can be
borne in the spring. 
so naturally we would just be subject to the whim of
our biological drives...

plus it makes for a warmer bed.

Then vote for her, and, if you believe strongly in her position
and agenda, encourage others to vote for her also.  If you think Bozo
the Clown or Steve Young or your cousin Stan would do the best job,
write them in.  If everybody did things this way, we would soon break
the stranglehold that the Two-Party-System(tm) has on politics in this
country.

a silly thread about "s" gets out of control... I think the joke was
that "s" was sex... but whatever...  social-raves should be socal-raves.

</troy>

---------

I don't know if anyone else on the list reads MUZIK, a British clubbing,
music and scene mag, but socal raves actually showed up in the pages of
this month's issue.
The subject?...
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
"S BY GUM"
  Los Angeles-based e-mail site Social(sic) Raves caused mass hysteria
among clubbers in
California last month by announcing that a new triangular-shaped wonder
drug called "S"
had arrived on the scene. Apparently dealers were inundated with
requests for the drug
following claims that it caused an intense five minute peak in mental
processes which then left the user feeling completely refreshed.
  Pill-hungry types were dissapointed, however, when Social Raves
eventually came clean,
revealing that the drug didn't exist and that the triangular shaped
tablets were in fact
Sucrets mints. Very bloody funny...
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Congrats kids, you made the world news.
Albeit with spelling errors and misinformation, but then without that,
it just wouldn't
be socal-raves, would it? :)

ok ok i tried not to get involved but seeing as how i am helping to put
this party on (with my posse,nexus)i suppose i had no choice. First of all
the new years party is being put on by ,bagok tribe,funky tekno tribe,space
children,and NEXUS(bsp)and it will be out of control(in a good way)tthe
talent and the location will make this a party to truly remember. Also its
kinda historic all these diffrent crews working together. Second ive never
been to a space children party that promised derrik may and didnt deliver
the goods they have booked him at least three times and he has shown at all
of these parties. They have also gotten a good number of the transmat crew
at their parties including, juan atkins,kevin saunderson and stacy pullen
and all opf these artist have shown. I remember a party for their 1  year
aniv. that juan played at and it was a ug and cheap. THirdly i know scott
and coz. I know they love the music and the scene and i know that they have
lost ALOT of money at a few odf their parties but they continue to throw
them big or small. THis leads me to belive that they are not in it strictly
for the money. If they were i would think they wouldnt focus on techno as
the main form of music at their parties (house just draws abigger crowd in
san fran). Ran d dreams  reasoning for boycotting space children was one of
the most petty i have ever heard of. Mr dreams would u have boycotted if it
was harmony dropping flyers without asking u first i doubt it. They
definately mad a big tabbo mistake by not coming back and making sure their
flyers were cleaned up but who are u to make rules of what u can and cant
do at burning  man. last time i checked that was the antithesis of what
burning man is. I dont justify everything space children has ever done
they, like alot of people have made mistakes in promoting.(like each and
every promoter, ug and massive)  My final point is this , and it s quite a
heated one.... i dont know if there is anything wrong with promoters who
thorw parties for money as long as they take care of busniess(i know that
one of the points made was that space children dosent but still) Promoters
dont have to be rave kids they are  promoters and fed up with the scene for
the most part so do u guys think that throwing a party for money is
wrong... i dont think i do (but i will always love the music and all
promoters should love it too.)      NEW YEARS ON TREASURE ISLAND  WILL
FUCKIN ROCK!!!!!!!(OH YEA IM PLAYING THERE)......MOSHE
PS.SCINCE THERE ARE ALL THESE OTHER CREWS THROWING THIS PZRTY ITS NOT JUST
A SPACE CHILDREN PARTY AND THE PROMOTIONAL SKILLS OF ALL THESE GUYS WILL BE
IN EFFECT SO THERE WILL BE A FEW MORE THAN 400 PEOPLE THERE

i have hobby, i call it "fishtanking" - when i'm at a club or a party,
at some point during the evening, i find a secluded place set back
from the main area.  picture windows at house parties are good, you
get a good unobstructed view, and the glass adds to the fishtank
effect.  at 1015 there's a balcony overlooking the main dance floor,
it's usually fairly deserted up there, and it's a perfect vantage
point to watch what's going on.  there's almost always a good spot to
do this at any party, the idea is that you get a good view of
everybody as they all move from place to place around the room...

it's always fascinating to watch a group of people interact with each
other.  so many drama's unfold, and often you can tell exactly what's
going on even though the dialogue is removed - peoples facial
expressions and body language speak volumes.  i always look for
anything interesting, but whenever i do this i find most of what i'm
observing seems to be the human mating ritual.

funny but more than anything it reminds me of watching pigeons picking
up on each other in the park.  the male puffs up his neck feathers,
accentuating his subtle irridescent sheen.  the female coos
appreciatively, ruffles her feathers, then flies away.  but not too
far.  the male pigeon struts around a little, then flies over near the
female, usually behind her.  and struts around a little more.  then
tries to mount her.  but ms. pigeon is not that kind of girl, and
flies off again.  this process is repeated until a)the female decides
the male is a loser after all, and takes off for parts unknown, or
b)they make love in front of god and everyone else, cooing unabashedly.

now i'm sure you all consider me a pigeonphile, which i will neither
confirm nor deny.  but what i'm trying to get at is, we're all
animals. i believe that to deny that there are roles we were born to
play is to deny our connection with nature.  yet at the same time, i
believe from bottom of my heart that we all deserve the same
opportunities, regardless of sex, skin color, sexual orientation etc. 
and reconciling these two seemingly opposing points of view is just
one of the many philosophical juggling acts i find myself doing every
day.

I've never seen that at a rave, unless you concider the Crash Worship/Rave

ZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzz.......

Let's just say I'm not too hot on the idea of this becoming rave related.

(uh yeah, we're gonna need some cleanup here, we got another mob whackin
off in the chill room...)

Talk about jackin... of course, that would be a great idea for greedy
massive promoters... "thanks for the 25 bucks kid, now get in there and go
fu@k yourself..."

Ewww,

Um, for a little clarification.  There are different types of tantra that
focus on stimulating, or improving different aspects of life, Red tantra
is one type which focus on the second chakra and consequently sex,
reproduction, etc.  And yes tantra is still widely practised, though white
tantra primarily.

Um sex and tantra are very seperate.  The way to keep sex beautiful or
"sacred" is through the conciousness of the people involved and the
attitude with which they approach it. >

When i did tantra, i felt a type of bliss that kept me feeling balanced
aware and happy, a good rave can leave me feeling close enough to that to
keep going, sometimes especially to be up lifted. (personal opinion)

I'll be going home from Dec.17 till Dec. 24 to Orange County to do some
planting...are there going to be any good events during that time?  I am
subscribed to the SoCal calendar, but I can't find it and I don't know the
scene well enough to pick a good party :(  Oh shoot, I'll miss the Harmony
party on the 20th, er, okay, maybe I will only be home from Dec. 21 till
Dec. 25...oh I don't know, I am so indecisive sometimes.  Let's do it this
way:  How many of you out there think I should stay in SF until Dec. 21
and not miss the Harmony party? This is important since this will be my
first part*E* since September! 

Thanx  :)

-->	I have experienced many forms of racism, but as a rhetorical
question I don't know which one is more damaging, taxing, or "preferable".
In other countries there is open racism and strong anti-foreigner
sentiment (sometimes state sponsored), and I have found that living in
such a situation is unbearable because you can't "ignore" it or "forget"
about it because it is always there.  I came to realize that keeping my
guard up 24-7 was wearing me down mentally, physically, and emotionaly.
To clarify, I had to be _very_ careful where I was, who was around me, and
what possible sticky situations might develop because I was the "visible
minority".  On the other hand, I was thankful that the situation was so
obvious that if something unpleasant did arise, I would be somewhat
prepared--better a visible "enemy" than a hidden one.  In the US, I have
felt that there is more hidden racism...kind of like walking into a room
and getting a feeling that the interrupted conversation was about you, and
it wasn't a very positive conversation either.  This might be different in
other parts of the country; that's just my impression of California and
mass media.  The good thing is that you can lead a relatively normal
existance ignoring it, but occassionaly, there will be a devastating
encounter "out of the blue" which just screws up your whole week because
you weren't prepared for it.  Issues like the "glass ceiling" and
preferential hiring practices are real and frustrating because they are
obstacles which you can't (or which are really difficult to) pin down.  I
am not a paranoid person, but neither am I a dense person...these are my
observations and I would be interested to read what others have to say
about them.

I have been extremely lucky, I have not experienced or at least noticed
any racism.  Though I did get many curious looks and interesting comments
when I used to wear a turban and bana (sikh dress).  However, I found it
funny when a friend of mine from England said that if I went there I would
definatly be discriminated against.  He told me that Indians are more
discriminted against more than other people of colour.  He said that
"black" people were hassled alot, but they fought back, so people left
them alone, where as Indians just took it.

uhhhhh... to me this seems a bit contradictory. if being chivalrous is
"just manners", where does it fall in weighing the pros and cons of sexual
inequality? it shouldn't. in fact, it ought to be the other way around: as
women get more respect in society as equals, shouldn't men be *more*
chivalrous towards us?

so what's up, _b o i z_ ?????

ok, i dont mean to start ANOTHER drug thread, but heres my problem:

one of my best friends for the past 2 years has been an avid cocaine user ever
since i first met her. she has always been able to convince people, even
herself that she never had an addiction, and she was so convincing that i dont
think she really had a problem. when a friend told her that she was worried
about her, she was able to stop for 2 months to prove that she wasnt addicted.
but now, i think that even she realizes that things are getting out of hand,
but wont/cant stop by herself.  She is using more often than ever before and
all of her friends are scared for her. so here is where i need help. she is
showing some of the addiction signs that i have learned to look for and i have
talked with some of her other friends and we pretty much agree that something
must be said, so.....
what should we say to her? should we approach her alone or should we do one of
those group intervention thingees? what if she turns away from us? then what.
i dunno, i'm not even really sure what i should ask you guys. i guess that any
tips or recomendations any one has ( since i know there are a lot of us out
there that have been through some tough times with drugs)  i will be eternally
thankful.

wait, wait! i know what you're talking about! (reaching back through the
cobwebs that have formed over the past few years) there's that grey mass in
the center of the brain that dictates which side of the brain you're using
at a given time. and the one in women gear us to use *both* at the same
time (ie: women are better multi-taskers supposedly) where as men tend to
use only one side at a time.

whether or not this part of the brain developed over time (millions of
years, tho) due to need rather than it having been there since cell-day one
is another question tho....

hell yeah.

it's hard to say how much of a person is that way due to genetics and how
much due to environment. can't agrue either side.... they're both such huge
contributors! :P

toys, i think, i'll have to argue on the side of socialization. from day
one so many influences are telling us what to be, how to be, what to like,
how to look, what to want (welcome to ameri(k)a), what to buy. i know there
are certain stages at which a child can comprehend things (visually), but
i'm pretty sure preferences are (aside from those life and death related
ones) instilled in us.

>>I definitely do not agree in the phrase "different but equal". That is like

>i think we _are_ all equal! one may be more intelligent... but the other
>may be more ________.

i know! why can't you respect someone that is totally different than you?
all the more reason to be awed, i'd think.... granted sometimes you have to
respect something that you might not agree with, but does that mean the
different viewpoint/race/gender/sexual orientation doesn't deserve the same
(meaning equal) basic rights as the most common (or dictated, "chosen")
one?

>>or that people of color are treated as "different but equal".
>well why not?!!!

not that they _are_, but _shouldn't_ they be?!?  and in the same light,
shouldn't women/views/sexual orientations be treated as "different but
equal" as well?

heheh... that's an old trick... notice that none of the OTHER original
cards are there either.  for instance, the queen of diamonds is there at
first, but on the second screen it's the queen of hearts.  (same color,
so it's looks similar).  cute eh?

I guess it depends on what you consider significant mental differences.
I think our current understanding of the mind is limited, and therefore
people try and make generalizations about things.....I don't think they
work differently in any significant way.....I think that even the people who
are doing the studying already have an idea that they work differently,
so they set out to prove that theory.....

>>For example, I do not believe that women just have a natural desire
>>to play with barbies, or that boys just have an instinct to get matchbox
>>cars, yet their parents often act as though they do.
>i'll agree with you there... to some extent.
>BUT do you think toy manufacturers package their products to target adults?
>no, they do study upon study to see what children like... and i just so
>happens that girls go for the pink toys and boys go for the blue (a rough
>generalization)... have you ever looked down a girls toy isle? a boys?
>completely different!  and i don't believe that parents/society instill
>this into their child...

Of course they are targeting adults, children don't have money!
If a child saw a toy they wanted and the parent looks at it and thinks
"eew..i don't want my kid to have that" then it won't get bought.
Here's the thing - the kids they are doing those studies on have already
been taught by their parents what is appropriate behavior. From birth
kids grow rapidly, observe their parents, and attempt to copy them.
If parents dress girls in pink from birth,  naturally at age 5 or so they
think that they are supposed to pick pink.

I don't know about every family, but from age 2 on my parents had the
TV on when i was in the room. (i sure hate television, but that's another
rant.) Anyway, so from age 2 on I watched Sesame Street, etc. etc. as
well as cartoons and advertisements on TV. What did I see? I saw
little girls playing with dolls, and wearing pink. Hmm. I wonder what kind
of toys I thought  I should get?

Being that children are natural learners, they tend to internalize what
they see around them...this is just one example....

baby toys are all colors of the rainbow... no premeditated sexism there.

I'm not saying that this is sexism necessarily....it's just the way our
society
looks at men and women.....sexism implies it is bad.....well, i guess i must
admit i think we would be healthier and far more advanced if we didn't pay
so much attention to gender differences.....but i'm not saying our present
society is premeditating to be sexist...i think they just don't realize it!

But I have to disagree, I think that even as young as babies boys and girls
are treated differently - maybe not in the colors of their toys, but in more
subtle
ways......

but once they are old enough to walk down the
>isles themselves... you see what children their age and sex like.

I see products of our society and culture (and especially media!)

>>I definitely do not agree in the phrase "different but equal". That is
like
>>saying kids in special education are looked on as "different but equal"
>WHOA!
>i _would_ say that...  whose to say that intelligence quantifies greater
than?
>you ask the parent of a special ed. student... and i bet they will say that
>he/she is just as special as any other child... of course, we all have our
>strengths and weaknesses... we are different.

I know. *sigh* That was my point! Okay, I should'nt have mentioned it
because
now I must explain in length. I feel that the system of separating children
into different classes (i.e. a special ed class, a regular class, and a AP
class)
is not healthy for learning. When special ed kids are on the playground,
the other kids tease them, call them "stupid" etc. etc.

While it may be true that the intentions of the people who are separating
them is for them to learn better, I feel that it actually harms their
learning.

In the same way, i feel that separating men and women and treating them
differently even as children not only harms the people, I think it limits
people by confining them into certain labels and boundaries.

I agree that each individual person is different - that is why I think that
grouping people into broad categories like special ed or AP, or even
male or female, limits them. We all have some masculine and some
feminine characteristics no matter what our biological gender. By
expecting people to think differently, act differently, dress differently,
etc.
due to their gender, it limits their behavior and how they can interact.

>>or that people of color are treated as "different but equal".
>well why not?!!!
>
>very, very basic example--> all fruits are equal... right?
>(ok, ok... just work w/ me here! :)
>apples and oranges are different... right?
>but whose to say that one is intrinsically better than the other?

Word.  Neither is better. So in a perfect world, it shouldn't matter.
But, in our society, what ethnicity you have, what gender you have, etc.
DOES matter. You are treated differently!  That is what I am trying to
say...
I feel that treating people differently for their race, gender, or way of
learning
is limiting them.....and unfair!

the usual thing is up  =)

Well this is why i believe we need to toss out this idea of uniform rights
for all. I feel that each person is unique and each likes
to be treated uniquely. So I like to find out how a person likes to be treated
and then treat them as such. Some like it when i open doors or
bring them warm slippers and coffee in bed on a cold morning
and i am happy to do that for women or men if that is what makes them 
happy. I will not do those things for those who wish to not be treated that 
way. I know a woman that says she hates the equal rights movement
because she wants to be "treated like a lady by a man". Thats her
choice and i respect it while i treat others as they wish to be treated.

Each of us has different needs for many different reasons whether
that be gender, race religion etc...so we each need something 
more than equal rights. Sounds complicated but i think we can 
eventually find a system that is free of any type of discrimination
and provide evryone with what they need. I think raving and the interactions
that it produces including the discussions that go on here
in sfrave land are a way to learn to  respect each other no matter
how much we diasgree and feel we are different from each other.
I think when we really ask ourselves how we can make sure everyone we 
come in contact with is getting what they need then we will
ALL be pretty happy one day...dont you?

Hi Moshe!  ]=}

 About time *someone* leaped to SC's defense. I was beggining to think no 
one liked them.

 You need to get out more son.

 I called for a boycott for a number of reasons. If Harmony had dropped 
the flyers off, uninvited at BM I would have given Greg shit for it. I 
think most people who know me (including Greg) wouldn't doubt that for a 
minute.

 Mearly one of many mistakes these folks have made.

 I don't make any rules. I do, however have respect for the producers of 
Burning Man and what (they seem) to try to be doing with it. Nor did I 
say anyone *should* do anything because of what Space Children did. I said 
I was not going and *asked* (more courtesy than the SC gang showed me) 
for others to do the same for the reasons I outlined. I was expressing my 
viewpoint and was always clear that it was my viewpoint only.

 BTW it was my table the flyers were placed on. I do make the rules for 
what can be placed there. It is called taking responsibility.


> last time i checked that was the antithesis of what
> burning man is.


 Wrong. The antithesis (as far as I can tell) is commercialism and 
especially commercially raped art. There are rules there and for a 
reason. It is not about total anarchy. There is structure there more 
strange and beautiful (in some ways anyway) than anywhere else in the world.

 Everyone makes mistakes and hopefully we learn from them. My biggest 
disapointment was not getting an apology from Space Children. Perhaps I 
dealt with the subject in such a way as to make it difficult for them do 
make amends without losing face. Perhaps they don't care.


Happy Hplidaze everyone,

The Harmony party Beautiful People is on December 27th, not the 20th....
it's the Saturday after Christmas..... a perfect time to enjoy the holiday
spirit!

So you're in luck, you can still go to southern Calif and be back in time!

the term "chivalry" triggers the image of the strong manly knight throwing
down his cape over the mud so the delicate maiden who must be kept clean
and protected at all costs can gently step over it, so as not to soil her
clean white embroidered shoes...

and elizabeth, that is connected to the same behavior patterns that over
the centuries has kept women from realizing the power and potential that
they have.  (i hope you read my comments about my mother and my 89-year old
friend and how these attitudes affected their entire lives, that was the
real point of my post)...

Holding the door and lighting that cigarette is a modern version... and as
a traditional behavior pattern, it goes hand in hand with expecting women
to follow different (and lesser) paths than men.

if it's so important having men open doors for you that you're willing to
trade in their true respect for your true abilities, then go for it, and
enjoy it.

but i don't want to be treated like a princess, i don't need simple things
done for me just because i'm a girl. I just want to be treated respectfully
as an equal.... and i will do the same in return.. that's the difference i
mean between "manners" and "chivalry"

if you think the "boiz" should have better manners and behave more
respectfully to you and everyone else, then i'm with you all the way...
but that isn't about gender.   just like giving your seat to a pregnant
woman on the bus isn't because she's a woman, it's because she's
pregnant... it is very important to think carefully enough to see the real
reasons for certain behaviors.  you should give your seat to any elderly
person on a bus, not just women, because it's easier for a young person to
ride standing up.  that's common sense, and it's manners.

my dream is to live in a world where we treat everyone respectfully and
with consideration of the individual person they are, regardless of their
gender, race, age, etc,  because that's the way it should be.  no princes,
no princesses.

I have a pac - man record i got when i was 5 that i, happily still have.
at the beginning it has theme music and then it goes, "when you hear
the energizer sound, it's time to turn the page" "WAAOOWAAOOOWAAOO"
that is the coolest noise!

i definitely plan to spin that somewhere (if i ever get good enough to =
play out that is :P)

love kim

I am glad that you responded to my post kim
because once again when I went to post my
note-blocked by surfwatch came up on my screen- i'm
glad to see that it actually does not stop me from
sending.  
I can't even diable surwatch with out fear of
termination from my company.
This program far exceeds its bounds. 
If anyone out there is a lesbian, good luck getting
to a site with even non sexually explicit material-
because it is one of those watchwords.

i'm wondering you people,,,

what the hell is going on on this list?

i mean, i leave, i subscirbe to the sfravEs digest (burp!) and i look at my
mbox and it's filled with sex!
well let's schedule a tantric mutual masturbation ceremony one night when
we're all home in the wee hours of the night.  we'll all play a rave tape
at home too so this will be double rave related.  then it will enhance our
spirituality and we'll all feel connected more in a way.

i mean, i thought i was the sex fiend.  the dirty old deepfog.  but now i
wonder!  =]  actually though the fish (the foolish one) had a good point in
talking about sex being like a ritual.  i think a lot of things in life
should be treated as such including,

-eating
-ingesting any substances
-raving itself

i mean we have such an automated society like we can get 99 cent whoppers
w/o even having to blink.  the 25 cent sex booths. we live in an instant
breakfast society.  well slow down everyone.

i leave my soapbox now for some other bright cheery mind.

I don't know what is up with the other "boiz" but from what I see, it
isn't equality you seek, it is superiority.

i don't think that we seek superioriy... but that issue does have potential...

here come the flames...

this is my prediction... i -think- that in about 100-200 years (maybe even
more)- women will become the "dominant sex" in our society.
now this isn't something that i am personally aiming for- i just see this
slow change for equality that may not just stop at a sexual equlibrium...
but with momentum, keep shifting until women are on top (so to speak).
that isn't necessarliy a good or bad thing. but i do think when... or if
this ever does happen,  it would be extremely interesting to see how
different things are (technology aside) in the world.  i think that the
strengths and weekness of a female dominant society would be very unique
from what we have today!

just a thought...   
;)

There was once a time, before people kept much in the way of historical
records, when women WERE the dominant sex.  Before anyone knew how
babies were made, women were considered to have the magical power of
creation, and men were just big and strong and could kill things.

Here's a tip:  If women want to be the dominant gender, all they have
to do is withhold sex worldwide for one week and bring male-dominated
society to its knees.

Actually (IMO),

Sexism/racism/etc. will become less and less prominant in our world as the
information age begins to take root in all aspects of our lives.
The haves and have nots will be determined by who has the information and who
is "in the know" rather than by color, sex, etc.
Superiority will be completely determined by who consistently has the right
information at the right time.

But what would be the cause for such a  shift...i think it would have to
be something more than simply "it is our turn now"...megan, do you see
women gaining dominance out of control of reproduction...because you see
"female identified" values gaining dominance....why do you see this
happening?

Hi all!  ]=}

 I'm almost sorry for spamming three lists!  ;) Saw an article in the SF 
Chronicle (page A7, 12/10/97) talking about Solar Flares. Essientially 
they are very powerful and can affect (in some ways) life and 
telecommunications here on Earth due to the IMMENSE amount of 
electro-magnetic energy they spew at the Earth (is it just me or does the 
Sun seem a bit "male" in this respect ;).

 The interesting aspect (for me anyways) is that the peak output of these 
solar flare cycles happens every 11 years-- the next peak is due 2001. 
 That means the one after that will happen on 2012. 2012 is a year with 
much signifigance if you listen to Jose Argulles who interpets Mayan 
Prophecies. Coincidence?

(getting out the solar umbrella)

no, i don't see it happening from any of the reasons you mentioned...
and i really don't have all that much backing up my statement (just a
thought to start a thread...) BUT since you really shouldn't say anything
on this list without a valid reason behind it...

i guess i'd have to say that i see things working in cycles-
as steve mentioned, women were the dominant sex way back when... 
at this moment (whether we like it or not) it's men in the dominant role... 
and i see a great potential for women in our future.  all this fighting for
equality could end up giving us more responsibility than we had anticipated...
and you know what? i'm ready for a change!  and it's true that women don't
need men for the same reason we used to (food, shelter, clothing,
protection...) we can do it all on our own now.  
and i also see that once something has a lot of momentum... it is often
difficult to slow it down.

I wasn't directing my comment to all females. My apologies if you took it

Really? Most of us agree that males being dominant is a bad thing, yet you
don't see female dominance as necessarily bad? Where does that get us in
the long run?

When i go to these camping raves i always love seeing
people working and playing together regardless of race,
gender religion politics or color of our tails and stripes.
 I know there are occasional traces of discrimination but
i think they are rare or at least much less present
than in everyday life. I have seen occasional
things like "oh i cant lift that heavy speaker
or climb up there cause im a girl...lets get a man"
But those are rare exceptions. 

I often wonder why we cant take this out to the rest of the world
which is why i think massives have the potential to expose the
rest of the world to this new way of peaceful and equal 
coexistence.

The real source of a lot of our problems today are that a handful
(13 to be precise) have control of our resourses and pretty much
control the world. By fighting among our selves over issues
of gender bias or racial issues or any other subgroups
we dont have the focus or resourses to deal with the real issues.
 If we can find  ways to unite, then we can deal with the real power issues 
and redistribute it in a more uniform way so that we all 
have equal opportunities to get what we need and want. Raving,
i feel provides that opportunity. Isnt that what plur is about?

Im not saying that we dont have discrimination problems any more,
just that we need to also look at the bigger picture. And i think
that as robert said, the internet is also providing a tool
that is allowing us to move beyond these old boundaries
that seperate us and cause us to struggle for power over others
rather than power with others.

Perhaps. The information age is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, it
has the power to unite people of similar interests regardless of distance.
On the other, some of those interests aren't too nice. Been to any good
neo-nazi sites lately? Or how about "godhatesfags.com?" The information
age is not a panacea.

And get wet, and cold, and get sick, and die 'cause antibiotics and clothes dryers wouldn't be invented for hundreds of years...  

What I always find interesting about this recurring thread, is that chivalry is only remembered as it was/is applied to women.  Chivalry was a code of conduct that governed ones behavior towards both sexes, in all aspects of life.  Example, during a fight, if you disarmed your opponent, you would discard your weapon before continuing the fight... 

I've always wondered why men no longer think to treat each other like this, but we feel guilty if we don't act chivalrous towards women.

And yes, I do know that the code of chivalry served to enforce the idea that some men were intrinsically better than others... The commoners weren't expected to act nobly, blah blah blah.   I didn't say chivalry was all good, blah blah...

I've *always* thought this planet would be much more peaceful and
enjoyable if women had more power then men. Men are basically *jerks* and
in most cases and are all about being *better* and having *more clout*
then othe guys. This is apparent in everything. I deal with so-called
"professional males" all day long on the phone. It makes me sick sometimes
when I realize their mentality and their level of maturity. It also makes
me scared to think that there are people such as these running the planet.

I'm not saying all guys are jerks, but you have to admit that a very large
percentage of us are. It's sadening too, because the nice guys (like most
of us here) are overshadowed by the bad ones.

this is my own opinion....

whoa. being kind and courteous, having a bit of manners... noticing that
the end of someone's cigarette is cold, while you're holding a lighter...
ok, granted... i don't open doors for men, but i hold it open until they
put a hand on it if they are right behind me.. 
I open doors for little kids, and will stand with a door open for 3 or 4
women to go through if they are in an obvious group.  NEVER, never did it
cross my mind that they were incapable of opening the door for themselves
[in most cases], nor did I think them any less for not opening it for me Or
that they should take a lesser path, on the contrary, i am letting them go
before me, therefore giving them the lead, upper path, or whatever [cant
think of the right word].

If you are walking with someone, or arrive at a door just before someone,
it is just plain courteous to open the door and let them pass instead of
trying to get through it quicker than them, and let the door swing shut on
them. Has nothing to do with their position in life.

i can't recall having had a door opened for me by a girl.  not to say that
they expect it to be done for them.. there *is* a shortage of Doormen these
days at the local shops, but what i am trying to say is... if i ask you out
to dinner... we're not going dutch.  If we are walking together, and we
come accross a door, i will be momentarily confused if you open the door
for me... but will dismiss is as quickly with a thank you... [although i
think from then on, you will find it hard to get to the door before me].

>but that isn't about gender.   just like giving your seat to a pregnant

it's not likely i would give up my seat to a woman on a bus.  who would?
she can find  her own damn seat. [there, happy?] when she gives up her seat
to me.. then we'll see.

****
I do what I do, may it be chivalric in anyway, because it makes me feel
good to do it.  Opening a door and getting a smile out of someone is more
than enough thanks for me... I may live in a mostly thankless world, but it
doesn't mean I'm going to be any less courteous.

love it when you get like this Leslie,
peace,

The question is, is this behaviour intrinsic to being male, or is it a
product of enviroment/conditioning?

Just read Clan of the Cave Bear or something?  :)  

Seriously, my girlfriend has an interesting observation:  All the traditional matriarchal societies (that we could think of) occurred among peoples that had... well... MAN sized women.  Samoans, Hawaiians, some Native Americans, women of these societies are certainly not frail in appearance, nor lacking in physical stature.  No offence to these people, my girlfriend's family tree has both Samoan and Hawaiian roots, and I have Cherokee grandparents.  Contrast that with European women... Viking Babes (humor) notwithstanding, generally not as imposing size wise.  Hmmm....

In the UK, the cheer "long live the Queen" would change to "long live the goats!"   

Sorry!  That was Ba-a-a-a-ad...

Most of it is environment/condtion in one persons lifetime.  But I've done
some pretty stupid things in my past that I look back on and regret and
wonder why I did them (haven't I ladkie?<-a secret ref to some special
person on this list).  then I see other guys do exactly the same thing, it
makes me wonder if our minds have evolved over thousands of years of
conditioning to do competitive or childish or stupid things like some kind
of male mestration cycle.  Men are jerks in general, I don't know how
women deal with it.  They are stronger then we give them credit.

along the same lines, in yesterday's newspaper there was an article about
how in russia, where chivalry is far from being dead and women are treated
extra special, rates of spousal abuse and rape are astronomically high.

Not only that Robert,
 Pretty soon we will all be hyspanic anyways.. That will pretty much ruin
the whole rasist fad.
 That was a joke. But seriously. Were mixing up the gene pool so much.. It's
almost like people (women/men) are more attracted to races other than their
own. Like some chemical in the brain is perposely making people more
attracted to other races. Maybe I am wrong. But I see more blonde women with
darker men.,And I can't keep the darker women from smiling at my white ass.
The fact that oposite attract... You know. Maybe pretty soon we will all
look like thoughs damned grey aliens? I don't know.

Ok.
Bye, bye.

Please, speak for yourself.  The attitude you display is just part of the
problem, not the solution.

heya,

I agree. I did not make a reference to whether it was better or worse, but
rather how things will really be in the future.
There will always be inequity. Some will have more than others in all things.
The real issue should be this:
Its not that all should have equality in all things, but rather, that all
should have the equal chance at acquiring things.
The field should be level for those that want to strive towards their
particular goals (assuming they are good ones anyway), however it is not good
when spoils of one's labor be spread out amongst those who may not deserve the
fruits of your hard-earned labor.

Exactly. But within our society and how we're *supposed* to be raised, and
all the BS that goes with that.... what can you expect from the average
Tom, Dick, or Harry?

I would like to think that my son(s) and daughter(s) will grow up in a way
that's much different from the method that was used with my parents. Blue
and pink can be worn by both boys and girls... and my daughter shouldn't
have to wear a dress if she feels like wearing jeans...   all those
stereotyplical BS that's written into our minds from the very beginning.

It makes me sad to think of how far we *really* are from true equality
between the sexes. There are so many people my age that are so
*unevolved*.... I want to strangle them and tell them what's up. We need
to start admiring eachother more and excepting our differences...
respecting eachother for these differences.... and getting past this
physical layer...

Yep... I was raised by "3 women".. :)  Thanks Mom, Grandma and Auntie...
hehe...

http://www.citizenmag.com

p.s. Really tho. It is really only about humans attracted to other other
humans. The whole thing about races mixing is quite a notion. Race, as most
commonly use it, only reinforces the superficial differences between people
rather than allowing for an understanding of the real (and important)
fundamental similarities between all humans.
We need to get over this race thing.

-->I don't think I agree with your observation;  there have been numerous
examples of matriarchial societies in the past and I don't think I was
especially struck by the robust stature of the women. Since the accepted
theory states that Amerids migrated from Asia via an icy land bridge, and
human colonization of Pacific Islands originated from Southeast Asia there
is a possible suggestion of strong matriarchial antecedents passed on from
the Asian continent.  Samoans, Hawaiians, and Amerids display impressive
physical characteristics because both sexes lead an existance close to the
land and nature which dictates an active physical lifestyle.  I don't
think the women of these cultures are arguably bigger than their male
counterparts per say, but if you do a physical comparison of these women
with Japanese, German, and Peruvian women of course you are going to see
morphological differences since these people live in differing
environments. True, European women in the middle ages were forced indoors
to do embroidery, Japanese women were cosetted into doll-like
configurations, and Peruvian women into weaving textiles; these are faulty
arguments since they only apply to certain socially striated classes that
are not representative of the whole cross-section.
	Besides that, political power is quite distinct from physical
power and the fact that males tend to be physically stronger than females
is an undeniable factor that needs to be considered into such arguments.
There are examples of matriarchial lines in various Amazonian and African
tribes and when many of these subsistence cultures are examined,
traditional gender roles are present, but there also tend to be separate
spheres of power wielded only by males over other males and women over
other women (which kinda reminds me of "secret" male societies in western
culture, e.g. Promisekeepers, Masons, Robert Blythe inspired bongo beaters,
 women's tupper and society parties, collegiate greek systems, etc.). And
like much in politics, much has to do with symbolism, and even though clan
leadership might be passed down to a sister's daughter, the real power
might reside within the male dominated circle of elders.  

	But my point is, I don't think the size of a woman is any
indication of her strength and "woman-ness". Thinking so is not only
dangerous and presumptous in the size-ist sense, but she might just kick
your ass before you know it. 


	Oh, and I also wanted to add to Mr N'Stuff's thread: Interracial
crossing is very good in the biological and cultural exchange sense; too
bad social mores are still so primitive.

	heard an interesting interview (NPR: FRESH AIR rebroadcast
tonight at 7pm on KQED radio) with a "woman" born intergender which
means she originally possesed both ovarian and testicular tissue from
birth. in fact about 1 in 2000 children are born this way at which point
doctors make a gender decision. followed by "corrective" surgery to
remove the inappropriate naughty parts. my point? evolution in all
species begins with the apperance of mutations which prove themselves
better suited for their enviornment. 100-200 (more like 500-1000 but
hey, like any of us will remember this thread by then) years from now,
who knows if there will even be "gender"...

Am I?  I drew no conclusions, made no inferences.  I suggest you sharpen
your reading skills.  I simply relayed an observation about the

excuse to make long rambling posts, please find someone else's mouth to
stick words in...

[rest of my original post snipped]


First you say: : "I don't think I agree with your observation"  then you
confirm my observation by saying: "Samoans, Hawaiians, and Amerids
display impressive physical characteristics"... What?

Please, give examples!  I was hoping someone would add to the list of
female led cultures...  I'm sure there are many I haven't considered. 
Again, all I said was that in matriarchal societies I know of, the women
tend to be<italic> physically</italic> more robust...

Minh, with such an impressive vocabulary, you could make a good writer,

Well, duh?  I certainly do not think.... uh size matters :)  Books,

 I have seen shows on Discovery about this and some mention in my history 
classes, too.  It was never speculated whether the females were dominant for 
their reproductive abilities, so I can't really speculate on Steve's idea.

However, to contradict byroni's original thread, these societies were not 
all 'peaceful and loving' as we might like to fantasize.  In these societies 
(I learned about two, one on an island north of France and one somewhere in 
central/southern Europe - i think) the women were not only the dominate 
gender, but the warriors.  These women were some of the fiercest fighters of 
the times, tales say.
Also, in grave excavations, the female bones were the one's found with the 
swords, tools, ornaments, etc buried with them.  From this, the 
anthropologists suggest that women held much power and stature in the 
society.  I don't remember what they speculated the man's role to have been.

I feel that there will always be a dominant sex.  It may switch over time, 
but looking at different social groups in society, I think it would be hard 
to find a group of people that co-exist entirely as equals; somebody has to 
lead.  Somebody has to fill social roles and with these social roles, over 
time traditions will be formed.  etc etc

There was once a time, before people kept much in the way of historical
records, when women WERE the dominant sex.  Before anyone knew how
babies were made, women were considered to have the magical power of
creation, and men were just big and strong and could kill things.

Here's a tip:  If women want to be the dominant gender, all they have
to do is withhold sex worldwide for one week and bring male-dominated
society to its knees.

A female friend of mine was dancing at a massive a couple years ago and
felt someone tap her on the shoulder. She turned around to find some
gurning fuck jacking it right there. Needless to say he was forcibly
ejected quickly.

I've been at a couple other parties where people have been dancing with
themselves right in front of the subs...

Precedence: bulk



Hello EVRY-1 out in cyber-ville.  Hope that everyone is doing dandy, dry
and -- 'hi' to you newbes out there too.
=)

     Heres a bit'o'history; In MArch, Rebel Alliance Sound (aka RAS) hosted
a sucessful, free, outdoor event called _A New Hope_.  Dispite the cold,
cops, and a pesky crab we -the crew, DJ's, and partygoers- created a great
vibe and I hope that some of you out there that attended have fond memories
of that night.  In the consecutive months RAS organized, co-ordinated, and
assisted with various other sound crews to churn out decent underground
parties, all with very positive responses from you, dear raver.

     So to close out the year, and in the spirit of giving, RAS will be
having our finial party of 1997.  The event will be indoors, Free (although
donations will be extremely appreciated), and TOTALLY renegade.  Please
note that ALL RAS parties are done for the love and celebration of music
and dance as well as the scene it represents.  It's about a good time,
plain and simple.  All that we here ask is that you come with a positive
attitude, good vibes, WARM clothes and early, since the capacity of this
central SF location is Very limited.  Alcohol and smoking is to your own
discretion, so please be wise & discreet.

     So if you're bored off your bum and wanna have some fun, drop by and
dance to the cool sounds of: Joesph, Trace, Mary,  Anakin and Alex. Give a
call on the info line Saturday, the 13th. (510.218.7494) 'round 10PM for
directions.

     __PLEASE DO NOT POST TO THE CALENDAR AS THE LOCATION CANNOT POSSIBLY
HOLD THE AMOUNT OF PEOPLE THE CALENDAR USUALLY GENERATES__



     And to start off 98' proper, look out for RAS next event _POLARIS_
coming ta ya indoors, and in the East Bay, in January.



**Final Note:  (Anakin Here:) Thank you SFRavers for your patience.  My
first Mixtape _UNE_ is finally out and available.  A considerable amount of
gradidtude is due to the SFR family.  Many of you have influenced me
greatly in the production of this tape.  Thanks again.  although I cannot
control the pricing @ the various shops. If you run into me @ a party and I
have some tapes, I'll give ya the SFR discount =)...



                                                           And Merry X-mas.

(since we're not on the list yet, it'd be appreciated if someone could dial
the aforementioned number listed with code 303 to make sure that this post
                         went through... thanks.)



And wherever ya go ----  Play Hard.

After reading all this email that pours into my box, I can't helpmyself
to think about learning more about  you and what your interests are....

This happened to my friend at the FTT Halloween Tribal Massive.  We were in
the main room where Josh Wink was going off and she turned around and 2
guys were jerking off right behind her.  This was her 1st party, so now she
won't go to another one because of this incident.  She thinks this kind of
thing always happens.I tried to convince her that this was a complete freak
incident but her opinion has already been formed.

The holidays are bringing tons of parties almost every night of the
week.  There's another good selection this weekend, starting with
Pure Space tonight, and continuing with more and more on Friday
and Saturday.  Sunday features the Bulletproof boat party and BT and
a benefit; and the groove continues into next week.  Didn't find
anything for Monday though, maybe try Sister or Density or No TV
from the weeklies...

i was thinking about genetics and darwinism and "interracial crossing"
- first, i was thinking that, while evolution via the survival of the
fittest is a good theory, i've always suspected there was more to the
diversity of species than just that.  that perhaps there was some sort
of intelligence involved in the way that dna instructions were changed
or mutated or combined.

for instance:  a person born of asian parents will have natural
resistance to the diseases of that part of the world, whereas someone
born of european parents will have resistance to diseases that are
common to europe.  so will a eurasian child be more likely to be
resistant to the diseases of both, without first undergoing a natural
selection process?

i also understand that your average mutt canine will outlive most
thoroughbreds, as well as outdo them in intellegence tests.  of course
there was some serious inbreeding involved in producing most
thoroughbreds.

the thing is i can't back up any of this with hard facts (not that
there really are such things as hard facts...)  minh, you're some sort
of biologist aren't you?  i'd be interested in hearing some scientific
theory in this area, on or off the list.

as far as the cultural sense, i feel that different cultures
(obviously) have different ways of viewing the world in countless
ways.  ways which can't often be transmitted exept through long term
contact with, or immersion in, that culture.  and "learning" more than
one culture gives you several ways of seeing/interacting with the
world, which can perhaps be used selectively (ie you take the best
parts of each culture and incorporate them into your own world view. 
or use them selectively, depending on circumstance).

Birthday (9-20-71)  

What is your Sign= Virgo, just like Todd and Greg. 

Are you Married= No 

Have Kids= None...

Are you Single= Sorta.. not dating but not really looking, love will find
a way, or not...

Do you Dj = I try...

What is your most listened to Style of Music? = Minimal Ambient Detroit
style Goa Breaks... and that techno stuff, and ambient, and trance, and
house, and progressive house, and whatever else is on & honest...
listening to good music is what it's about, every style has a couple
shitty records in it, and most music does it for me at one time or
anothEr.

Musician / Artist= Trying... still can't draw circles, but I can do gears
like a master now.

Hobbies= Unkinking speaker cables, alphabetizing my vinyl collection,
bpm'ing everything I own (my alarm clock beeps at 140 bpm, perfect for
techno btw), writing long winded email, flaming people I haven't met yet,
discussing PLUR with people who steal money from their parents so they can
buy crank, snowboarding (cu@*geyz2!), geek stuff, trying to get a
non-cheesy sound out of my Korg X5, watching good movies, eating.

Favorite Sexual Position= Any one where the handcuffs don't bind into my
wrists

Ideal Party Linup= Cari Lekebush, Juan Atkins, Derrick May, John Williams,
James aka Slayer, Fat Tony playin phat ass disco in the morning... while
Joe serves em up shaken, not stirred.

Favorite Food= DJ Food, off Ninja Tunes (psychotically spicy Thai
actually...)

Mission In Life= To get people to stop crossposting to multiple regional
rave lists. 

Favorite DJ= Whoever plays the best tracks for that moment in time... it's
not about superstars, it's about moments in time.

Do you represent the Scene Negatively or Positively? = Negatively.  I have
been getting in touch with my inner jerk for several years now. 

How? = Being sarcastic on SFRaves. 

Do you go to parties to hear the music or hook up with the oposite sex? =
This is a bit "breeder-centric" don't you think?  I go to sell bunk E.

Peace...
Andy

I think it's important as well.. for the younger generation to  know what

what, weren't expected to act polite? i'd think that at least _some_ of
them did? it's the ideal, of being polite, i think that has been lost. god,
it almost sounds conservative, which is another misconception. maybe i'm
too idealistic, but shouldn't it be a goal to be polite and to respect
*all* people? it really has nothing to *do* with equal rights - as i stated
earlier, strides made in equality would seem to make people _more_
respectful and polite rather than less so. but then again, life just
doesn't make sense sometimes, does it. oh well - you do what you can,
right?

cheers - e. :)

so now wait! how come i'm not meeting any of these men??? :o

(and hey - holding 5 bags of groceries might incapacitate you, male or female.)

i have held doors for men (being female), but i have also seen my father do
it countless times. common courtesy. or at least it used to be.

no shit! men especially!

i suppose this is merely a case of understanding a word to mean different
things. i kid you not, i always thought the word "gentile" to mean kind.
never bothered to look it up. until i got into this debate over it. here
again, there are dual meanings. i've been thinking of chivalry as the act
of being chivalrous, which is defined as: characteristic of or relating to
the ideal of a knight...marked by fairness, generosity and kindliness, (and
here the questioned inequality) esp. to foes, the weak, the weak and lowly,
and the vanquished.... so what then philanthropy? is this discriminating in
a sense? nowhere does it say you have to owe any body anything if they
treat you with respect... this is something that has developed along the
way somewhere. and isn't that what inequality is? we owe you 'coz we're not
as *whatever* as you?

but i have offered my seat in a club.... okay, but then i don't take
busses. they *do* look awfully crowded tho! i'd probably only give my seat
up for an elder. or if they look really ill or somehting (okay, i'm
babbling, but it's like when you're waiting and waiting to pee and some
girl comes in looking like she's about to loose her shit all over the place
- of course you give up your place in line!) so many of these things are
situational. ya know?

i think we're going for the same point here, just using different terminology.

I spun at a party at a now un-used Orange County location and was told 
that some guy was caught shaking hands with Abe Lincoln in the bathroom 
and when they took him out, it turns out that he was the same guy they'd 
exjected for masturbating the week before!  A chronic recurring wanker! :D

OK instead of being really.. unlazy (is that a word?), I'm NOT going to
cut and paste on PINE, it takes too much time. SO here is me.

Name: lara

Birthday/Age: March 3, 1977 (note this, PEOPLE!) 20
(this makes me a Pisces)

Status: gonna fall in love, if not in reality, in my dreams... ;)not
lookin for it right now.
(NO KIDS)

Music of choice: I'm an everyday junglist.. I fight for survival..

Drug of choice: I'm an everyday junglist.. I fight for survival...

Ideal Line-up: Hype, Zinc, Rap, Brockie, Mickey Finn, SS, AndyC  w/ MC's
Fearless,
Skibadee and Det. but it'll never happen, never on the West Coast.
so i'd have to say, local talent: haK, Sifu, meeks, siphon and science.
just coz they're so damn fun to listen to and watch.

Mission in Life: to live. to love. to constantly learn. to be human. to be
compassionate. to smile. to fight ignorance and educate. to laugh. to cry.
to understand. to not understand but be there anyway. to share with others
like in the 2nd grade. to dance. to make sure my inner child is fed well.

Hobbies: dancing. walking. writing. reading. painting my toenails.
being with people who are cool. ;)

Do you represent the scene negatively or positively?: I'd like to say
positively, but there have been times when i've dissed the scene vrrbally
for its weaknesses.

How?" by being myself and respecting life.

Favorite Sexual Position: whatever.

Do you go to parties to get laid, or to get FUNKY with the BEATS?: the
latter :)

Artist/DJ?: i sing in the shower, tinker 'round on the piano. DJ? no.

Philosophies in life: Be REAL. Karma exists. However, Karma does NOT exist
necessarily for those who do good expecting something in return. 
and as a friend said

Whatever is whatever, everybody needs love.

xo
lara
p.s. i have not quite been myself lately.

      Why do you need a drivers license to buy liquor when you cant
drink and drive?

      Why isnt phonetic spelled the way it sounds?

      Why are there interstate highways in Hawaii?

      Why are there flotation devices under plane seats instead of
parachutes?

      Why are cigarettes sold in gas stations when smoking is prohibited
there?

      Do you need a silencer if you are going to shoot a mime?

      Have you ever imagined a world with no hypothetical situations?

      How does the guy who drives the snowplow get to work in the
mornings?

      If 7-11 is open 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, why are there
locks on the doors?

      If a cow laughed, would milk come out her nose?

      If nothing ever sticks to Teflon, how do they Teflon stick to the
pan?

      If you tied buttered toast to the back of a cat and dropped it from
a height, what
      would happen?

      If youre in a vehicle going the speed of light, what happens when
you turn on the
      headlights?

      You know how most packages say "Open here"? What is the protocol if
the       package
      says, "Open somewhere else?"

      Why do they put Braille dots on the keypad of the drive-up ATM?

      Why do we drive on parkways and park on driveways?

      Why is it that when you transport something by car, its called a
shipment, but      when
      you transport something by ship, its called cargo?

      You know that little indestructible black box that is used on
planes? Why cant they
      make the whole plane out of the same substance?

      Why is it that when youre driving and looking for an address, you
turn down the
      volume on the radio?

      Do vegetarians eat animal crackers?

      Why are they called apartments when they are all stuck together?

      If fire fighters fight fires, and crime fighters fight crime, what
do freedom fighters       fight?

      If con is the opposite of pro, is Congress the opposite of
progress?

      If olive oil comes from olives, where does baby oil come from?

      Did you know who in 1923 was:

      1. President of the largest steel company?
      2. President of the largest gas company?
      3. President of the New York Stock Exchange?
      4. Greatest wheat speculator?
      5. President of the Bank of International Settlement?
      6. Great Bear of Wall Street?

      These men should have been considered some of the worlds most
successful       men. At
      least they found the secret of making money.

      Now more than 55 years later, do you know what has become of these
men?

      1. The President of the largest steel company, Charles Schwab, died
a pauper.

      2. The President of the largest gas company, Edward Hopson, is
insane.

      3. The President of the N.Y.S.E., Richard Whitney, was released
from prison to die       at
      home.

      4. The greatest wheat speculator, Arthur Cooger, died abroad,
penniless.

      5. The President of the Bank of International Settlement shot
himself.

      6. The Great Bear of Wall Street, Cosabee Rivermore, committed
suicide.

      The same year, 1923, the winner of the most important Dance
championship,       Johny Suthers, won the International groove
Tournaments. Today he is still       phreaking the floor.

      Conclusion: Stop worrying about stoopid shit and start shaking that
ASS!

1) No known species of reindeer can fly. BUT there are 300,000 species of
living
      organisms yet to be classified, and while most of these are insects
and germs,       this does not COMPLETELY rule out flying reindeer, which
only Santa has ever       seen.

      2) There are 2 billion children (persons under 18) in the world.
But since Santa
      doesnt appear to handle the Muslim, Hindu, Jewish and Buddhist
children, that
      reduces the workload to 15% of the total - 378 million according to
Population
      Reference Bureau. At an average (census) rate of 3.5 children per
household,       thats 91.8 million homes. One presumes theres at least
one good child in each.

      3) Santa has 31 hours of Christmas to work with, thanks to the
difference time       zonesand the rotation of the earth, assuming he
travels east to west (which             seems logical).  This works out
to 822.6 visits per second. This is to say that for each
Christianhousehold with good children, Santa has 1/1000th of a second to
park, hop out of the sleigh, jump down the chimney, fill the stockings,
distribute the remaining presents under the tree, eat whatever snacks
have been left, get back up the chimney, get back into the sleigh and
move on to the next house. Assuming that each of these 91.8 million stops
are evenly distributed around the earth (which, of course, we know to be
false but for the purposes of our calculations we will accept), we are
now talking about .78 miles per household, a total trip of 75-1/2 million
miles, not counting stops to do what most of us must do at least once
every 31 hours, plus feeding and etc.

      This means that Santas sleigh is moving at 650 miles per second,
3,000 times thespeed of sound. For purposes of comparison, the fastest
manmade vehicle on earth,  the Ulysses space probe, moves at a poky 27.4
miles per second  a conventional reindeer can run, tops, 15 miles per
hour.

      4) The payload on the sleigh adds another interesting element.
Assuming that each child gets nothing more than a medium-sized Lego set
(2 pounds), the sleigh is carrying 321,300 tons, not counting Santa, who
is invariably described as overweight. On land, conventional reindeer can
pull no more than 300 pounds. Even granting that "flying reindeer" (see
point #1) could pull TEN TIMES the normal amount, we cannot do the job
with eight, or even nine. We need 214, 000 reindeer. This increases the
payload  not even counting the weight of the sleigh  to 353,430 tons.
Again, for comparison  this is four times the weight of the Queen
Elizabeth.

      5) 353,000 tons traveling at 660 miles per second creates enormous
air resistance  this will heat the reindeer up in the same fashion as
spacecrafts re-entering the earths atmosphere. The lead pair of reindeer
will absorb 14.3 QUINTILLION joules of energy. Per second. Each. In
short, they will burst into flames almost instantaneously, exposing the
reindeer behind them, and create deafening sonic booms in their wake. The
entire reindeer team will be vaporized within 4.26 thousandths of a
second. Santa meanwhile, will be subjected to centrifugal forces
17,500.06 times greater than gravity.  A 250-pound Santa (which seems
ludicrously slim) would be pinned to the back of his sleigh by 4,315,015
pounds of force.

In conclusion  if Santa ever DID deliver presents on Christmas Eve, hes
dead now.

      I still believe!!!!!!!!!!

ones that they often refer to women as having...I have tentatively
dubbed it "MSB" (male sperm buildup)

Sorry, just a little joke there....personally, I do not believe men are
"jerks in general" and find it silly to think that way......like i said
before
i think the whole women/men thing is just in people's heads...i see no
big difference.....

So do you feel that ravers are not equals and do not treat each other
equally
then?

I personally feel they are closer to equals than nearly anywhere else, and
that
is why I like it =)

Oh, I see.....men treated women as though they were inferior, so
we treat them as though they are inferior, and that makes it better?

Once upon a time there was a parallel universe to this one. Those who
had blue eyes were highly beautiful, intelligent, and respected. They
got paid more, were the majority of government, and were frequently
featured in the media. However, all those with any other color of eyes
were made fun of and at a great disadvantage both economically and
socially. If you had brown eyes, you would be more likely to be overly
emotional, on welfare, using drugs, etc.

Sounds pretty ridiculous doesn't it?

In my world, what people have in their underwear makes no more difference
than what color their eyes are, and I certainly don't think someone's
physical features which they have no control over should determine
their power in a culture.

I definitely do not think women should "rule"......nor men......!

imagine if you replaced the words men and women with african-american
and white. would it still sound right to you? if some people are getting the
shorter
end of the deal should they get revenge? does that solve anything?

The Glad Hand presents their drum 'n' bass crew:

December 20th at 5pm.
Free! in-store @ Faster Bamboo 
678 Haight St. at Pierce

Dj Monkey
Junior Varsity (live)
Busheeloop (live)

This is not really a party (unless a ton of people show up and start
dancing),
more of a low-key, chill-out, drum 'n'
bass-listening-while-you're-buying-records type of evening, so stop by
and check it out if you can.  

The Glad Hand is a monthly event featuring an eclectic mix of electronic
music by both DJ's and live artists.  Plans are being made for the
January and February Glad Hands at the Justice League.

You know, I am *really* tiring of people attributing thing to me that I
did not say. Please, before opening your mouth(virtually that is) make
sure you know who is saying what. In this instance you should have
directed your comments to Megan, not to me.

***What is your Sign = Aquarius

>Are you Single = 
***Divorced, and currently single as a middle digit.

Do you Dj = 
***no, but my interest in the music has led me to some computer software
like Rebirth which i would like to fiddle with *if* i ever get the friggin
time.

>What is your most listened to Style of Music =
***Trance,GoaTrance,Jungle,Drum&Bass

>Musician / Artist = 
***well, since i can't realy remember too many names, nor do i pay too much
attention to who is up there spinning when i am zoned in on the music... Dj
Dan has never let me down... or is this to *ask* if i'm a musician or
artist... well, yes, as a matter of fact, i like to think of myself as an
artist... do a bit of pen and ink... pencil seems to be my best medium...
although i do some computer graphics [mostly lame web stuff], including a
couple of flyers... ya know, free, cause i like my stuff to be out there,
and it gets me into the party for free... i *do* wish i had more time for
it...

>Hobbies = 
***Like to play hockey, take my dog to the river, and dance around my house
in nothing but my pants... or just smoke out and stand in front of my
stereo with my eyes closed and let the music tell me how to move... 'course
that's pretty much how i dance anyway...

PeanutButter and Honey Sandwiches....

something i love to do... 

>Favorite DJ = 
***Whoever's mix gets me dancing instead of idling.

***I supose positively... i'm not quite sure what you are asking.. do i
represent to others the scene as a positive thing.. or do i contribute my
postive vibe to the scene as a collective?  both.  i think it's extremly
important for those positive persons  to contribute to the vibe... you
can't expect it to just overtake you.. you have to make your own little
contribution..

>How? = 
***by enjoying myself, dancing, smiling, skirting the promotion and
creation of parties by doing flyerart... it [theart] puts a smile on my
friend's [the promoters/producers] faces, and they are stoked about getting
it done for free i imagine...  i'm not a talkative person, nor do i offer
up hugs randomly or pass out candy, but i generally don't give off a bad
vibe...

>Do you go to parties to hear the music or hook up with the oposite sex? 
***well, i just couldn't imagine... who was it who said they go to hook up
with the music..? that was perfectly put.

jamespark (Izumi)

What is your Age
---
25

Birthday
---
September 2 1972

What is your Sign
---
Astrological: Virgo
Chinese Astrological: Rat
Element: Water

Are you Married
---
No, not yet

Have Kids
---
No, not yet

Are you Single
---
Yes

Do you DJ
---
Yes

What is your most listened to Style of Music?
---
This definitely changes. Currently it's two sides of a cassette tape:
contemporary minimalist composition for piano and other side is Italian
jungle, and whatever I happen to be spinning with that night

Musician / Artist
---
Toshio Iwai - combines music with technology
Ryuichi Sakamoto - if I could be anybody else in the world, he would be it
John Cage - our father, who art in heaven
Phillip Glass - contemporary composer extraordinaire. Einstein on the Beach
Peter Gabriel - world beat, computer technology, always interesting

Hobbies
---
Snowboarding, skateboarding, music composition, computer stuff, anime

Favorite Sexual Position
---
I'm a monk (so far)

Ideal Party Lineup
---
DJ Spooky, DJ Shadow, DJ Sho, DJ Kid Koala, Derrick May, Ken Ishii, Jeff
Mills, Joey Beltram, Mijk Van Dijk, BCJ, Hardfloor, Brother From Another
Planet

Favorite Food
---
Sushi, Risotto, Udon, Fruit!

Mission In Life
---
Get people to communicate and understand each other through music, writing,
art, and just plain talking

Favorite DJ
---
I'll state my favorite type: The kind that will talk to you if you approach
them respectfully, offer tips, tell you who else to listen to if you're
learning, or just smile and say "thank you" no matter how much
puppy-dogging people do to them, willing to try different genres or
listening to them, not dissing others without good cause. DJs who help make
the scene flow, rather than putting up roadblocks and walls. I hope I can
live up to these criteria - and more.

Do you represent the Scene Negatively or Positively?
---
(-) - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - X - - - - (+)

How?
---
Respect for others, respect for the scene, evangelizing the positive
aspects, take people for their first times and stick with them and offer
support, remembering what is good and what is not and giving feedback,
learning all I can so I can show and tell others what a great vibe it
really is. Having a DIY attitude and making plans for, well, "doing my own
thing" for the people. San Francisco is going well now, but there is so
much potential for so much more. Let's make it happen together, shall we?

Do you go to parties to hear the music or hook up with the oposite sex?
---
The music: it keeps shaking me. To me, losing the sense of hearing would be
an incredibly depressing thing. I can live w/o the sight just fine as long
as I can still hear/feel the music.

Cheers,
james

That depends on the Rave. Sunset with its too mellow for my taste music, is
a great place to meet people. I go to raves to have a good time, dancing,
schmoozing whatever. Raving is a big part of my life, so of course I want
to meet women who rave, but getting laid is not my primary focus at raves.

Turn ons = inteligence, competence, education, creativity, good fashion
sense(hella trendy)
Turn offs = smoking, butterfly tattos, doc martens, hirsuteness.

Let me just put in my little $0.02 For those of you
that do not know Anakin (Adam) He is a real good DJ
and a nice guy I can remember many of a times during
summer waiting for parties to happen (being chased by
SC cops) or just helping setup and me and Adam and
the rest of the Jocks talking rekkid talk and stuff.
This guy has giving so much to the scene and to me
personally as a person I am glad that I had the
chance to meet,hang,Spin,talk,bullshit with him. A
all around nice guy very humble and a crazy groove
out dancer/trancer... Keep it up Adam I will pick up
your tape tommorrow, I think if I make it to the store.

Later all,
Macadio

relax, to hang out and be around people who aren't mundane.

Come on down to The Shack this Saturday and get a groove on with VSF's
security...**


   - Pablo's Sugar Shack - 
Funky House & Mad Jazzy Grooves!
      December 13, 1997

        TRACY (Mixology)
        RYNO (Spundae)
        TAJ
        CRISPY
        MOFO aka Moses
	
	next week: Mark Lewis (L.A.)

   - S A T U R D A Y - 
    10pm - afterhours 
VSF, 278 11th St. @ Folsom, SF
  $10, 21+, 415.668.2476
 SFRaves free B4 10:30pm



** just kidding, we supplement VSF security with our own security. If
you ever have a problem such as those discussed in the recent
"VSF/STOMPY/SECURITY" thread by all means LET US KNOW! 
SugarShack@mindless.com

Otherwise, always remember that illegal behavior is still illegal
whether it's in a nightclub or not.  Believe me, the VSF security
doesn't set-up a tent and sell their confisgated goods after everybody
leaves. Several times a night the club is visited by undercover SFPD and
for security to turn their heads the other way would be to sacrifice a
space that has been very friendly to our scene (Stompy, Pablo's Sugar
Shack, Pure Space, Ultra) in a city that is becoming increasingly
after-hours intolerant.

As for mistreatment of patrons by VSF security, I personally forwarded
several of the e-mails that recently appeared on SFRaves to the owner of
VSF.  While I haven't personally witnessed any of the problems that Mr.
Lee has (I use some of my own security on my night) the owner of VSF has
told security to become less "intrusive." As for the accusations of
racism, that's a tough call.  I've never seen it, which is not to say
that it does not exist.  But when a person has admittedly had several
drinks, uses foul language, and ethnic curses, it's tough to defend
their position no matter how righteous. Security is security and a lot
of the security at VSF work at 1015, Sound Factory, 177 Townsend, and
Cat's Grill as well. On the streets you argue with a cop you're gonna
lose.  In a club you argue with a security guard you're gonna lose.
Sucks but it's true. It's best not to get into a situation like that in
the first place.

After reading all this email that pours into my box, I can't helpmyself
to think about learning more about  you and what your interests are....
so if you have the time fill this out... and post on the list, Im sure
others are just as interested in you as I am.

Name (or Nickname) Jaylee

What is your Age= 24
Birthday (2-27-73)
What is your Sign= Pices
Are you Married= No
Have Kids= No
Are you Single= No
Do you Dj = Yes
What is your most listened to Style of Music? = Progressive / Breaks

Give it a Try!!!

Crap. 
When I first saw this I was like, "oh. whatever. some marketing thing..." but
then I started reading all your responses...HA! Fun.

So I am now obligated to put my nickel in the pot.

> Name (or Nickname) Rob Pointer (I hope that's not my nick name.)
> 
> What is your Age= 28 (Jurassic Raver. Itsah Dinah-sore thang...)

> Birthday 7/7/69

> What is your Sign= Yield. ("HEY YOU! SLOW DOWN!")

> Are you Married= Nope.

> Have Kids= Nada.

> Are you Single= Nope.

> Do you Dj = Yep. (It's all digital now fo' me.)

> What is your most listened to Style of Music? = LTJ Bukem style Jungle, R&B based vocal house, wicked DJ Driven breakbeat (a la Dan and D. Glaude), emotional sounding techno (a la Hardkiss and FSOL, etc.)

> Musician / Artist= Yep. Editorial Graphic Design is my fav and forte.

> Hobbies= Music, Political Theory, battling the evil empire (microsoft), Urban Magazines, My company CITISCAPE, Fonts, Warez, Neville Brody, Club/party flier collecting, Finding the dangers in living w/ technology, New Media, Publishing, Apple Computer drama, Vinyl, The 49rs BABY!

> Favorite Sexual Position= If its passionate, real, communicative, and intimate then it's ALL GOOD.

> Ideal Party Linup= DJ Qbert, DJ Dan (when he's tearing it up), Hardkiss guys, DRC, Orbital, FSOL (w/ full on Multimedia Display of visuals), LTJ Bukem, Doc Scott, Chris Lum, Raymond Roker, Pete Tong, Keoki maybe, ummmm, and the opening spot? --- ME!

> Favorite Food= Chinese, Pizza, Thai Food (homemade - not the restuarant stuff - native!). I love things that are TASTY! Shoo, I'll eat anything that's got tasty flavor. 

> Mission In Life= To have a positive impact on those around me and to influence world events for the better. To drive a volvo S70 and dump my jacked honda civic that I've owned for 10 years. To meet steven jobs and have him say, "wow, you are such a visionary. I wish I had you on my team!", to create a bad-ass and fully meaningful publication that makes people think (like roling stone used to be or even how URB could be!)
To have a physique like George in "George of the Jungle." Oh wait. DOH! I
don't think photoshop could help me at this point...

> Favorite DJ= Myself ('cuz I buy all the music I like which means I love everything I play.) :) It means I'm friggin' broke all the time tho.

> Do you represent the Scene Negatively or Positively? = I don't think I really represent the scene. I just love the music, the philosophy (when one cares to rear its head), and the fact that its something we all created on OUR OWN! (I really miss the illegal days - illegal spaces, illegal samples, stuff like that...)

> How? = dy.

> Do you go to parties to hear the music or hook up with the oposite sex? =
I don't go to hook up, but I love watching people dance and get into it. I
love the music and the energy. I really think the whole dancing thing is very
basic and primal which really leads me to believe that raving is truly sensual
when you are lost in the rhythm.

Wow. I feel free now.

:)

By popular demand, I don't write em just pass em along:

1.I wish you were a Pony Carousel outside Walmart, so
I could ride you all day long for a quarter.

2.Just call me milk, I'll do your body good.

3.Your body's name must be visa, because it's
everywhere I want to be.

4.Can I buy you a drink, or do you just want the money?

5.I may not be the best looking guy here, but I'm the
only one talking to you.

6. You be my Dairy Queen, I'll be your Burger King,
you treat me right, and I'll do it your way right away.

7. I'd like to screw your brains out, but it appears
that someone beat me to it.

8.If you were a new hamburger at McDonald's, you
would be McFine.

9. Wanna Play House?  You be the screen door and I'll
slam you all night long.

10.Excuse me, do you have your phone number, I seem
to have lost mine.

11.I'm new in town, could I have directions to your
house.

12.If your left leg was Thanksgiving and your right
leg Christmas, I could visit you between the Holidays?

13.I love every bone in your body - especially mine.

14.Hi, I'm a necrophiliac, how good are you at
playing dead?

15.I can't find my puppy, can you help me find him?

But that is cause i have venus in aries. Venus is the planet

I also want to prove that god was on some really good

dream comes true and i want to get everyone to help
each other to fulfill our dreams so we will all be happy.

look down on the fact that every full moon i climb twin peaks
strip down and smear myself with bananas and scream that raving sucks.

>DO you go to parties to hook up with opposite sex or for the music.

Bad question. There several sexes so there really is no opposite.
I have gone to a party to meet someone( havet most ppl done that at least
once?) But I go to raves to hear the music and meet people and
have fun and i find they inspire me in my art. I feel there
is a renaisance happening and raving will be a big part of that,
from new art forms to social and spiritual transformations.
New communities and so many other things as well. But
mostly just to have fun. My favorite partys are the campouts.
I really love sitting around a campfire with everyone
listening to the music and watching the stars and chatting with 
everyone about multidimensional universes and and how we are going
to make this a better world and other weird stuff.

ps thank you all who responded to my new newsletter. It is not
officially out yet and is rather sporadic. I wasnt expecting
to get nearly the response i got. I am not ignoring you, its just
going to be a few days before i get to sending everyone something.

I will be sending a forcast for the end of the year and the soltice
along with some very interesting info about what is happening
astrologically. I thank you for your patience and am very
greatful for all the interest you have shown. 

have a happy weekend.

After reading all this email that pours into my box, I can't helpmyself
to think about learning more about  you and what your interests are....
so if you have the time fill this out... and post on the list, Im sure
others are just as interested in you as I am.

Example:

Name (or Nickname) Jaylee

What is your Age= 24
Birthday (2-27-73)
What is your Sign= Pices
Are you Married= No
Have Kids= No
Are you Single= No
Do you Dj = Yes
What is your most listened to Style of Music? = Progressive / Breaks

Hello Everyone!! My Name is Patrice (Trice) Speed


<< What is your Age=15
 Birthday = February 12 (vallentine's baby) 1982
 What is your Sign= Aquarius (oddball)
 Are you Single= of course =)~*
 Do you Dj = In my dreams
 What is your most listened to Style of Music? = Trance and Jungle and House
and <GasP>  I still listen to the alternative stations on the radio
 Hobbies=snowboarding and studying stuff and blowing whistles and being
artistic and a light in someone's life whenever I can
 Favorite Sexual Position= Variety is the spice of life.. OH DAMN.. Did I say
that outloud?? Nevermind.. I don't know what I"m talking about.
 Ideal Party Linup= one where I'm spinning =)~*
 Favorite Food= never stop eating!!! fOOd Is happiness... candy and bread
 Mission In Life= I haven't found one yet.. maybe raving is helping me with
that?
 Favorite DJ=so many people spin and so many people have a lot of talent.
There's good Jungle djs and good hardcore djs and good everything djs.  I
think what it comes down to is "what dj's don't I want to listen to?"
 Do you represent the Scene Negatively or Positively? = I represent a little
bit of both.  i'm always trying to be positive, but reality gets in the way of
that.  Bad things are going to happen and your going to get pissed once in a
while and take it out on someone.  There have been countless times when I
could have been nicer to someone, or I've forgotten to smile, but it happens.
You just have to remember to keep trying and work a little harder.  Positivity
is what will keep our scene alive.  Don't loose the enthusiasm.
 How? = Bring fun stuff to share with people, and smile and meet someone new
and think of someone other than yourself
 Do you go to parties to hear the music or hook up with the oposite sex?=
Wait!!  you mean... you can hook up with them???  This explains a lot... 


          hugs n' stuff,

Is this the SFR dating game?@!?
Okay....I'll bite....


Name= Well....nAtAshA is just a screen name behind which there 
is a long story...

Birthday= January 26, 1972..I suppose that makes me around a 
quarter-century old

What is your Sign= Aquarius...the Eccentric of the zodiac!!

Are you Single= Yep.... rollin with the punches, enjoying every inch
of life  =)

Have Kids= hell no !!

Do you Dj= nope! I'm a spectator

Most listened to Style of Music = hmmm, i have real picky tastes...psy trance,
progressive house or trippy dance with lots of airy funkadelic layers and
headsplitting beats that you  *can't* stand still to !!  does that cover it?!
none of that over-played kinda house you find in cheezzzy clubby dives 
It's all about Energie!!!

Musician / DJ = dj dan always seems to hit the spot....anything high-
energy (sorta fits my personality??) just *give me energie@!!!*...any 
of those big time LA stars who rocked my world for 2years ...
Orbital and FSOL and the Crystal Method are kewl too

Hobbies= Gee, what *don't* I do?!?  my life is my hobby lately =P
let's see...mycology, eastern philosophy, yoga, reptiles (I have a boa,
Ursula ) hikes & nature adventures, glow-in-the-dark stars, exercise, 
medicinal and neurological chemistry (told ya this might get messy =D ), 
family, music, laughter, love, happiness, friendship! 

Favorite Sexual Position= hahaha  hell, i do yoga, i can make anything
interesting =P  it's ALL good

Ideal Party Lineup= I don't care if the pope is spinning, if he shredds the
place up!!   I'm all about the time, space, who you go with......you can hear
the same dj two nights in a row & he might suck one time and send you into
oblivion the next...so who knows which it'll be?  

Favorite Food= frozen yogurt....spicy curried tear-jerking vegetarian
concoctions (yes, I'm a rabbit).. sushi...no red meat 

Mission In Life= Be the most unique me I can be!! And make sure
everybody gets infected with my laughter and happy smiles!  
Oh, yeah, and i'm one of those chemical researcher nerdy types who's
interested in the parkinson's conundrum and related biological 
imperfections...so who knows -- some of the most amazing scientific 
discoveries often happen by chance :)

Favorite DJ= Dan! & anybody who can send me to the next galaxy in 8 hrs or
less

Do you represent the Scene Negatively or Positively? How?= Well, I only moved
up here 6 months or so ago, but I'd think that anyone who's met me would
vouch that i'm a pretty insanely happy person. So i guess that would be a good
thing, yes?  I think life is about helping yourself and others to be the most
incredible, dynamic people they can be.  To quote myself, "Nobody loses the
race if we all finish together !"  Humanity, compassion, connection,
exploration- what else is there??  

Do you go to parties to hear the music or hook up with the opposite sex? 
DEFINITELY for the music...meeting people is just part of the package =D

luv n hugs n post-final-exams BLISS,
natasha

Hello to everyone new and old at sfraves. I've been gone, off in outer

late. 

I hope some of you will take the time to say hi to me. Otherwise I 
hope to meet/see some of you at some up-coming events.

Later,

Affecting the Scene=		Both.  I love raving but I like all kinds of music.  Not 
just
How?=				"techno"  but I don't contribute much.  I put in my 2 cents
				here on the list, pay my money to get in, but do I really
				"contribute"?  I don't know.  Sill like to party.  Love the music.
				Haven't met many of you.  So I don't know what you guys
				are like in person.  Maybe I'll get a chance soon.
Music or Sex?=			I go to have a good time.  So far it's only been the music.
				I won't rule out the idea of love or sex.  I'd prefer friendship.
				Sex is scary.  There is a lot of trust in sharing body fluids!

Shabad music is sikh hymns, they are teachings and poems taken out of the
Siri Guru Granth (the bible of the sikhs).  They are sung in Gurumukhi
(closely related to Punjabi) and are played to the accompaniment of
harmoniums and tablas.  Regardless if you are sikh or spiritual the music
itself is beautiful!

I will let you know, you can download kdvs off of real radio,
unfortunately my show will be from 3-6 in the morning for a quarter (the
shit spot they give newbies.) but i will give you times and dates.  I used
to bhangra dance when i lived in india, we also have bangra competitions
here in davis and a couple of dj's who spin techno bangra music, it is
alot of fun.  Talvin Singh has done some amazing mixing of traditional
hindustani music syles and D&B I think that it is a good diverse branch of
techno and hope more ethnic off shoots spin off from it (no pun intended.)
I have some bootleg goa stuff that is incredible!

Last year's Gathering was fucking brilliant. More vibe than the vibiest
Efest at 654 Mission. I especially liked the speaker stacks made to look

Sign = Taurus 
Married/Kids/Single= no/no/yes 
 
What is your most listened to Style of Music?=Right now techno, D&B, and
tech 
step 
   but I really like most music except Country or Western. 
 
Hobbies= Spinning, snowboarding, skiing, rock climbing, building just 
   about anything I can think of, volleyball, surfing, swimming,  
   learning new things. 
 
Favorite Sexual Position= Four on the floor and nothing but booty shaking! 
   Oops!! I think that was a party review I read... 
 
Mission In Life= I seem to remember coming up with three when I was in third 
grade: 
          1) move to CA and live next to the ocean (done)  
          2) learn how to do a back flip (tried once on a trampoline,  
             but didn't really get it)  
          3) Can't remember....  (I guess remembering this one is my current 
mission) 
 
Favorite Food= PIZZA!   or anything veggie... 
 
DO you go to parties to hook up with opposite sex or for the music- 
   Neither! I'm usually tricked with the false assumption that there 
   will be pizza on the premises, but the music and people are cool tho ;)

You are indeed wise. That's no mere theory, it's proven fact. Men are known
to have hormone cycles, although less pronounced, and of course without any
obvious signs. There have even been studies that show that women living
closely with men have more regular cycles, just as women living closely
with other women have more regular and synced up cycles.

>> Mission In Life= to make the world better through technology.

OUCH! Do you really think that the world could get any better through 
the use of technology? I mean, shit, our technology is surpassing our 
humanity! Technology is creating a huge division in our society that 
will not be able to be fixed. I think that most of our problems today 
can be attributed to the technological advances of the 20th century, and 
it makes me sick. If we're going to make our world better, we need to 
focus on PEOPLE, not  TECHNOLOGY! (I just thought that needed to be 
said...)

I really see and hear this a lot and I must admit that I too once had this
distaste. But I have since opened my mind up wide and now appreciate, even
like, some C&W.

C&W influences, partnerings, etc. are just like any other. Anyone remember
"Justified and Ancient" from the KLF & Tammy Wynette? Or even Dolly Parton
on the HiNRG charts w/ her version of "Peace Train" this year.

Since I brougt up the KLF, I found a transcript of their classic manual:
http://wso.williams.edu/~cchen/articles/manual.html
If you haven't read this, I recommend it ;-)

If you don't know what the hell I am talking about and don't know the KLF,
the Timelords, or the Justified Ancients of Mu Mu, then I really must be
old ...

Sikh, as in the religon.  It was born as a non violent protest to the
mougls invading india.  a combination between islam and hindu.  Though
shabads could definately be called some sikh shit. (sorry had to do that)

Bye the way, i should have also included that i am a total cheese ball. i

this could easily become a war, so i'll try to just present the reasoning
behind my above response and leave it at that... let me give some examples
of the ways i think that the world is made better through technology: my
life span is now about double what it was before modern medicine. i can call
my mom on the phone and, even though i'm 3000 miles away, hear her voice. i
can access information in libraries, encyclopedias, and academic journals
all over the world from my computer. i can listen to TECHNO on a huge sound
system.

in my mind, part of what it means to be human is to learn to use and improve
the tools we have, be that a simple stone tied to a stick or a
supercomputer. of course there are many issues that deal with the
responsible and beneficial USE of these tools, but decrying the advance of
technology is not only misguided but nonproductive. if you feel we need to
focus on people, then do so. but attacking technology as the source of our
modern problems is foolish. we can never unlearn what we learn as a species,
we can never return to the days of the past, as quaint as they might seem.
we must accept inevitable progress and do our best to use what we learn and
create to improve our world. which returns me to my mission in life...

  (Terecimo here, just hanging out with my best bud Patricimo)   inside thing,
we like to play sumo wrestle.  :) 

 Hey peoples!!!!   WellI feel like a stick in the mud.  Lately I have been
feeling out of touch with a lot of things in my life= work, school, dance,
raves.  What is the deal?  I think that I am going to blame it on the fact
that I am still in school, on the verge of my fresh new life, and have no true
boyfriend to call my own.

    What to do, what to do(mmmm, buttered bread!)   I was wondering where did
some of you find your most excellent and long lasting partner in life.   Where
and how is a good way/place to get peoples to come by and talk to you(you
know, a good, clean, wholesome pick up place)  

  Jeeze, am I sad or what?  Well now that you are all done thinking what a sad
little creature I must be to ask such here please openly answer.

Turd in the dirt me,
Teresa

(I really do have good self esteem, just I am not showing it to well here-with
the references to myself as a stcik in the mud and turd in the dirt and all.
Hmm, last week or so it was***Big smiles and bouncy walks***)  Times they are
a changing, babble, babble she does like the quaint brook in the mighty
outdoors.   I just like to let go once and a while here.  I think also it's
that every once and a while I question the rave scene---know what i mean?

  Mannnnnnnnn, it made me soooo  MAD today when I picked up my school
newspaper.  In one of the articles something on what to do in Fremont when you
are bored the last three things to do were listed as these raves coming
up....CANDYLAND, BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE & ACID BREAKS 2!!!!  These were listed along
with the Djs spinning, date, presented by so and so and the PHONE NUMBERS to
call for info!!!  All this after the other things to do such as going to the
Edge, the X, etc.  Not that I don't like those other things to do, just that I
don't think that they all belong together in my school newspaper.   It might
just be me, but I don't think that raves should be publicized in High School
Newspapers or newspapers period.  Then it attracts all the people that have
never even been to raves and the people that go just to go, cause they have
nothing better to do & then proceed to completly trash our scene while there
because we are all a bunch of "freaks 'n wierdos" that listen to crappy music.
( Not that new people to the scene are bad)

Okay time for me to go flame me now if you like but you shall never flake me
to pieces, I really don't feel like going any further and I think yall get the
idea.  Just remember if you flame me send it to ravalum@pacbell.net, not
Patrice at this addy.

Teresa, and now here is Patrice.

newbies with a.. whatever.  Alrite... first off...  It makes me pretty mad to
hear that a school, (and my rival school at that =)  Is being informed of all
these parties in this way.  Personally, I've been trying to get new people
involved in the scene.. but it should be done in a way that conveys what makes
it special to us.  I think that just putting the number in your school
newspaper is right up there with being a chronic name dropper.  Ok, sure, It
makes you feel pretty damn special, and a few people may enjoy thinking
they'll get closer to those people by being your friend, but to the rest of us
it is JUST PLAIN ANNOYING.  GRRR.. I am FURIOUS!! Go ahead.. flame me.  I can
take it once in a while since I hardly ever get mad.  Plus.. if I was throwing
a party.. such as Beautiful people... and someone started tossing my info line
around to people that are most likely going to bring a bad vibe with them, i'd
be upset.  I understand that with bigger parties you want to spread the word,
but even then it should be a bit more friendly than this.   Get ready for a
hoarde of fashion ravers pouring into these three parties.  DOn't expect to
see me there.  I love you all.. if yer gonna dissagree with me.. don't be too

hey ladies,

how is this different from the thousand-billion flyers that are promoted
everywhere for these parties (both smaller and larger)?

Seems to me that you are suffering from delusions of uniqueness are only
trying to protect *your* perception of the "scene."

If "our scene" can't handle new people (however they find out about the
events), then it doesn't deserve to last anyway.

where do you find a man?
like i, of all people should be answering this question 
(i claim my boyfriend's name is Gerry, that's my teddy bear)
but

i would reccomend a little booty shake in your walk and they'll come
runnin.;)
j/k 

my theory on being single is..
hey.. i'm 20, i have all my life to meet my soul mate, if i have one.
and during this time, when i AM single, hey..
it's a good time to get to know myself more, and enjoy things you might
sacrifice if you were to have a SO.
and i pray everynight..
dear god, if i die alone, i will seriously cause havoc in heaven.
;D

Don't worry, it won't, and exactly for those reasons. Similar movements
have come, and failed for the same reason....

However in order to present a "balanced" view, you need to include the
other side of the issue as to where "technology" has gotten us:

Pollution, the rapid depletion of natural resources, increasing invasions
of privacy, the ability to wipe out all life on earth with the push of a
button, and the list goes on. 

Technology has it's uses. But like most other things, it is not
intrinsicly good or bad. It is all a matter of application....

Thank you, someone, for seeing the downfalls and destruction potential 
of many technological advances. I just wanted an explanation and 
possibly an open mind from Mr. Technology. Point taken, Lara! :o)

true that, drums are pretty primitive..
but a rolling warped bassline?
and loverly samplin?
jungle would be pretty primitive and repetitive...
if you ask me, beating on a drum is beating on a drum. 
yea it'smusic but it's nothing compared to where jungle is now :)
well not NOTHING in sense of VALUE, but you can hardly call it jungle as
jungle has so much more to it.. yanno? 
anyway, i was just trying to point out that the music we love today is
where it is right now BECAUSE of technology.. which does have many
drawbacks as well as advantages.
poo, i give up :)
 *trying to cover all bases and probably
failing, as usual* xo baybee :)

hmm...i'm going to sound very hypocritical (beleive me, i'm glad i 
didn't die of scarletina when i was 8 thanks to medicine) but somebody 
told me this once, can't remember who it was, but he was definately a 
ravEr, said something to the point that our generation is going to be 
the first to realize that hey, maybe i DON'T want to live to a 
hundred, ya know?  cuz that's a LONG fucking time.
also, another idea to support this: it's better to burn out than to 
fade away.  
flames private please, i don't wanna recreate the havoc of the sexism 
thing .

Technology is a tool and like any other tool, it's use is determined by the
user.  Most anything in the world cn be used positively AND negatively.  It
is up to us to make sure that technology is used in a positive way.  It is
possible.  If tech is used negatively, do not blame the technology but
rather, the individuals and organizations who are implementing it as such.

hey

after spending yet another evening at a small LA party, I've realized 
that I still don't really like the LA scene.  I mean, yeah, there are 
some fun folks in it n'stuff, but all-in-all it's not as much fun as SF

good analysis. i think that's about where i stand on it as well. tools have
no intrinsic good or evil. for me to say my mission in life is to make the
world better through technology means that i want to try to do something to
fix the bad things we have created in trade-off for the good things we've
gotten.

doreen had another good point:

we do have to consider if the world what we are creating is truly what we
want. and of course we need to be open to all the sides, not blind
techno-boosters. which i don't really consider myself. but since i don't
believe in retreating from knowledge, however dangerous, i would say that
this quote from noam chomsky pretty well sums up my thoughts on the matter:

"Optimism is a strategy for making a better future. Beacuse unless
you believe that the future will be better, it's unlikely that you will step
up and take responsibility for making it so. If you assume that there's no
hope, you guarantee that there will be no hope. If you assume that there is
an instince for freedom, there are opportunities to change things, there's a
chance that you may contribute to making a better world. The choice is
yours."

I totally agree with this. I much prefer to die at 60, having led a full
life as opposed to living to 100 having missed many of the simple(and not
so simple) pleasures...

I've met every great partner i've ever had through activities that I
love, or through other great friends.  The two women with whom I had the
deepest relationships, I met through theatre.  One of those was a friend
of a friend.  I've met none of them while I've been looking for someone.
It seems that the harder I look, the less I find.  Then, it seems
everytime, I give up on finding someone, and then a wonderful person
appears.  This has been a faithful pattern over 17 years of
relationships, so i don't think any of it is coincidental.

I think key element here is related to  "You can't truly love someone
else, till you truly love yourself."  I think what happens is I start
doing things I love, fulfilling myself.  At that point, people are truly
able to see some of your personality.  And especially for people like
me:  i'm not the type of person people look at and immediately love/lust
after.  Only after truly getting to know some of the deeper insides of
me do people love me.

So, the upshot of all this is that "pickup" places for me are virtual
places.  My hobbies.  My art.  My friends.  The "pickup" place that
never works for me is exactly that:  when I try to pickup someone, it
either fails miserably, or I have a bad relationship.

whata do?  be yourself.  do things you love.  if you can, stop worrying
about it (kinda hard to do, sometimes).  you'll meet people who like you
for what you are.  relationships follow life, then life follows your
relationships.

 Well, why not.


Name?
 Giles (sounds like "Jy-ulz")
 
What is your Age?
 23, the magic number - the Earth's axis is at a 23-degree angle to the
sun's axis, the heart's axis is at a 23-degree angle to the body's axis,
the number of chromosomes in human DNA is 23, etc.

Birthday?
 3/7/74
 
What is your Sign?
 Pisces with Aquarius rising.
 
Are you Married?
 No.

Have Kids?
 No, but kids are the BOMB. Remember what it was like to be a kid? 
Everything was new and amazing. I think when you can go back into what it
was like when you were a kid, and experience those sensations all over
again, it's like everything in the world becomes new for you, and you get
to see the world in a fantastic light. 
 
Are you Single?
 Yep.
 
Do you Dj?
 No, altho I do create tracks at home. They range in style. I make a lot
of hip-hop, and I used to make a lot of jazzy, spacy techno. I used to
freestyle with my brother, too.

What is your most listened to Style of Music?
 Jungle, hip-hop, house (the deeper the better).

Musician / Artist?
 Both. I make tracks, I do design, and I'm working on a screenplay about
alien abduction.

Hobbies?
 Music, typography, design, writing, of course having sex, mountain
biking, and I used to ski a little, but this winter I'm learning to
snowboard.

Favorite Sexual Position?
 My position on sex is that sex is a very good thing. I encourage
everybody reading this to go and have sex right now. With me, my position
is that I think sex is all good - sometimes it's just fun, sometimes it's
this fantastically intense experience of connection, but it always beats
just sitting around watching TV, you know?

Favorite Food?
 Italian, no doubt. I love the way the spices can complement the food.

Mission In Life?
 (see favorite sexual position)

 Seriously...think about your life for a second. You know how there are so
many things in your life that you've thought about doing, crazy shit that
you've wanted to try? My goal in life right now is to make those things
happen. 1996 was really weird for me - a couple people died who were very
close, one who was very young to boot, and my father came close to dying
too - and it just really made me realize that you have to take advantage
of the time you have while it's still there.
  One thing I did is make a list of all the things I wanted to do. One of
them is getting my tattoo, which I'm doing on Jan. 3rd (thanks to all who
gave me advice on where to find a good tattoo place, btw - have a look at
http://www.bowkett.com/tattoo if you want to see the design I'm getting). 
Another is learning to snowboard, which I've got planned, and another is
swimming with dolphins. There's a place in the Bahamas which is a dolphin
swim camp. You go there for a week or a weekend, and you get to swim with
the dolphins. Imagine what it would be like to swim with dolphins. With
me, I think something like that is just so amazing.

Do you represent the Scene Negatively or Positively?
 I don't know what I represent to other people, but I know that when you
go inside and look for what matters to you, and see a chance to experience
it, that, with me, is definitely positive.
  What the hell has that got to do with the scene? I don't know, my mind
is sorta wandering.
 
How?
 How is my mind wandering? ;-) From topic to topic, basically. In the way
that your mind does when you're getting really interested in something.

Do you go to parties to hear the music or hook up with the opposite sex?
 Well, to be perfectly honest, some raver girls are hella fine, so it's
not like I'm not looking, but it's more about the music.

-->What are you talking about?  Of course it's possible...Santa lives in
another dimension that is connected to ours only during certain times of
our Gregorian year; X-mas being one of them.  In Mr. Claus's dimension
elves, dwarves, and munchkins are "employed" by Santa to work in low
paying 60h/wk shifts to create cottage crafts to distribute as signs of
good will.This is because Claus is one of the many autonomous despots
(see_Wiz of Oz_ and _Alice in W-Lnd_ as reference) in the region and was
appointed as Ambassador of Positive Thinking and Empathy Between
Discontinuous Regions of The Universal Connundrum Dimensions Three and
Five (see Proceeds of the MMCXXIVth Annual Appointment Process for the
Ambassador of Positive Thinking and Empathy Between Discontinous Regions
of the Universal Connundrum Dimensions Three and Five, United Regions of
Dimension Five Government Press, Emerald City--Oz, 34758BN as reference).
Flying Reindeers come a dime a dozen in the D-5 existence but so are
many other Animals (see aforementioned references) which are experiencing
a displacement of rights because humanoids want to reduce them to the
lowely animals instead of the free-thinkingly intelligent talking Animals
that they are (see _Wicked_). The existence of intelligent Animals has
been well documented (Milne's _Pooh_ series, Grimm, Andersen, Bechstein,
Hauff, Kaestner, et al), thus providing a basis for comparison and
establishing  undeniable documentation for the  existential conscious
condition of Animals over the years.=20
=09Newtonian physics is not as all encompassing in D-5 as in D-3 and
the absence of traditional physical laws in the D-3 world are common.
There is also a big time displacement between the two worlds (approx.
40 minutes to 120 years depending upon locality; the most extreme cases in
the land of Faerie which is classified as D-4.5 and goverened by another
set of laws completely).  The time displacement is well used by Mr. Claus,
who travels back and forth betweeen the two worlds, to his advantage
during delivery time at X-mas.
=09The existence of D-5 is difficult to prove for residents of D-3,
but since children and animals are much more sensitive to displacements,
the majority of D-3 have had some contact with D-5 in their youth
(see Dorothy and Toto)--with some rare documented cases experienced within
the thresholds of adulthood as well (see Oracle of Apollo, Amerid rites of
passage, hallucinogen drugs, etc. as related topics).  =20
=09Much work has been done to try and discredit the existence of D-5
by top D-3 in the annals of psychoanalysis and science, but the truly
informed residents of D-3 are much more resistant to such government
sposored attempts at cover-up and propaganda; which reach an all-time high
during the months of X-mas, Midsummer's, and Hallow's Eve.

--> Err, this is will sound kinda lame, but I will try to reply to a
message from C. Porter concerning this post, but since I accidentaly
deleted it...

...there seems to be some miscommunication here (since most of sfraves is
written and not spoken, this is understandable).  I was not flaming you, I
was implying that other women might be offended by your thought that only
MAN-sized women are able to hold power; which in a sense, discredits them
as women.

...if I was out to flame you, there would be no mistake about it.  I
thought that the format of my response was rather staid and did not
contain much in the form of insult, thus indicating it as a discussion and
not a flame.  Of course, I was mistaken to assume so; thus this
clarification. 

...I am not offended by your flame because I see it as a mistake and
rather misdirected.  Before you jump on me again, don't be so
hyper-sensitive about what you read on the net...discussion is discussion
and because you read something that is offensive, you shouldn't scream at
the poster instantaneously; would you do that in a real discussion with
actual living people present? Just because something is put to print does
not necessarily mean that it has meaning or significance, be sure to read
between the lines sometimes.

...if you would be so kind as to send me your previous flame, I would be
more prepared to answer it thoroughly.

100 years is in no way a long time.  I have so many things I'd like to do
in life, I don't feel like I'll have enough time to do them all.  I don't
buy into the idea that growing older means losing the capabilty or desire
to live.  Time is a gift and I intend to use and enjoy every damn bit of
it.  If any of you don't, I think it's too bad that you can't give that
time to another who would appreciate some extra time spent on this earth.

The experiences I will have in my later years will in no way be the same os
those of my younger years and that is exactly why I am looking foward to
them.  Change is difficult but it is also what feeds the soul.

Bring it on!
Megan

This is one food I have never learned much about. Are there
any good vegitarian vietnamese foods and where is a good
place to find them?


We should have a big party/feast this spring with foods from all the different
cultures. It seems we've got a little of everything here so we could probably
get a pretty good party out it. Dont know what kind of music
we would have to satisfy everyone, maybe we would have to make it
an all week event. 

I wonder why we dont have more catering at the bigger partys. People
dancing all night tend to get hungry.

Maybe some entreprenurial ravers could form a catering business
for partys that would also allow us to sample all these cultures.

Name (or Nickname) = josh
                   or 725 if you will (and perhaps you might)

What is your Age= time is just another illusion of 20 years' length

Birthday= 30 November, class of '77 

What is your Sign= sagitarrrrrrrrius

Are you Married= no.

Have Kids= "have" as in "sleep with"?  "have" as in "cheat"?  "have" as in
"eat"?  oh, "have" as in "possess"!  no.  

Are you Single= i prefer the term "non-dualistic", but yes.

Do you Dj = why yes i do.  thank you for asking.

What is your most listened to Style of Music? = psychedelic trance, artsy
punk rock, metal, and dem funky L.A. Acid Breaks!!!

Musician / Artist= Autechre. Underworld. Cop Shoot Cop. Atari Teenage Riot.
the Jesus Lizard. nin. Pantera. Juno Reactor.

Hobbies= writing; spinning; entheogens.

Favorite Sexual Position= 

Ideal Party Linup= Christopher Lawrence, Trance, Sandra Collins, Ron D.
Core, Fester & Oscure on the 2 x 4...in no particular order...

Favorite Food= small pieces of paper, capsules, and a generous helping of
salad.

Favorite DJ= whoever's spinning as the sun rises over the desert and washes
the entire party with a lush wave of golden light.

Do you represent the Scene Negatively or Positively? = i don't represent
the scene.  the scene is an emergent property from a group effort and i'm
an individual.

How? = how am i an individual?  well, my ego gets in the way from time to
time.  so no eternal bliss for me (yet).

Do you go to parties to hear the music or hook up with the oposite sex? =
it's yin and yang, man.  true harmony is achieved with a mixture of both.
but too much lechery or too much self-absorption can throw everything into
koyaanisquatsi.

long live the new flesh, kiddies.

But you will be competing with the live 105 party at
the fashion center. They got "alluring dancers" and
a free "make out room " all for $65. Im not making this up.
They have a full page add in the guardian. Wow, $65 for a party...
and its sponsored in part by Red Bull energy drink.

    Heheeh, well I thought for sure the neighbors would protest to a lot of
jungle and trance blaring through some old speakers, but so far so good.  I
thought for sure the people of Fremont would get on my case but AnthonE's
been spinning for about an hour with no complaints.  So I was wondering if
there are any bored SFRavers out there who wanna come listen to some toonz
with us.  It's just a few #sfravers chillin' here, but I'm sure we wouldn't
mind seeing an extra smiling face, so if you're in the area or you're really
bored feel free to come over.
    Directions are here:

    http://www.accesscom.com/~nico/sfraves.html

    If you wanna call first to see if we've been cracked down on or not,
here's the number:

    (510)794-6520

Greetings everyone! I attended my first rave a few weeks ago - what an 
experience! I think what made it such a great experience for me was the 
presence of a few great friends who were very supportive and receptive 
of what had taken place. The experience was such a healing and spiritual 
one - can you relate!

and (bom de nom de nom de nom d'nomd'nomd'nomde) half of me is still trying
to move to beats pulsated into my head since about midnight friday....

but, not the reason that i post.

being up and bored (and without cable) and trying to get the beats to
settle down, the tv is providing voice. and what comes on but tome and
jerry!

who will (or has) mixed this theme song into anything? got my heals to rise
a bit there.... but that might not be saying much at this point!

Those who don't feel this Love
pulling them like a river,
those who don't drink dawn
like a cup of spring water
or take in sunset like a supper,
those who don't want to change,

let them sleep,

This Love is beyond the study of theology,
that old trickery and hypocrisy,
If you want to improve your mind that way,

sleep on.

I've given up on my brain.
I've torn the cloth to shreds
and thrown it away.

If you're not completely naked,
wrap your beautiful robe of words
around you,

and sleep.

-Rumi

Hi peeps,

I've been thinking about buying my first keyboard. I was wondering if
anyone was selling a used one I could buy or could point me towards some
good models for a beginner.

A man walks in to a doctor's office with an ear of corn up his nose and
a carrot sticking out his ear.

The man pleads to the doctor, "I need help, Doc, what's wrong with me?"

The doctor quickly replies...

"You aren't eating properly".

rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr

A cab driver reaches the Pearly Gates and announces his presence to St.
Peter, who looks him up in his Big Book. Upon reading the entry for the
cabby, St. Peter invites him to grab a silk robe and a golden staff and to
proceed into Heaven.

A preacher is next in line behind the cabby and has been watching these
proceedings with interest. He announces himself to St. Peter.  Upon scanning
the preacher's entry in the Big Book, St. Peter furrows his brow and says,
"Okay, we'll let you in, but take that cloth robe and wooden staff."

The preacher is astonished and replies, "But I am a man of the cloth.  You
gave that cab driver a gold staff and a silk robe. Surely I rate higher than
a cabby."

St. Peter responded matter-of-factly: "Here we are interested in results.
When you preached, people slept. When the cabby drove his taxi, people
prayed."

Hello all you beautifull beings out their in net land. I've been on the list
for about a month now and have really enjoyed what it has to offer. So many
multicolored opinions flowin through this community. I love it :D. Anyway I am
very proud to be a part of something so profoundly revolutionary and exciting.
Now this brings me to my question. I know there are many knowledgable Djs out
there. So I was wondering if any of you space captains could give me some
advice as to what would be a a nice quality begginners turntable/mixer setup
(used or new). I have about 600-500 credits built up. I'm sure there are many
others like me who would greatly appreciate the info........
Danke lovely people :)

I'm pro-technology when it is used in an altruisic way.  I love the
internet, but would rather be without chemical warfare.

In any case, with or without technology, nothing (for me) beats hammering
away on traditional drums for a Haitian dance class.  Rhythm is ageless and
universal.  I've found it best to look to technology for production, and
look to the past for music.

Leonardo

There are enough witnesses at Stompy to verify that this happened on Dec.
1, 1997.  It didn't happen at your club.  It does not mean it didn't happen
at other people's events.

Good to know.  Now people know that they had better be careful doing
anything at VSF or any other club in the city.  Not a bad thing IMO.

Thanks for doing that, although I would have like to be asked permission to
do so.  This is a forum for *us* the rave community.  If you wish to snatch
somethinghere and present it at least have the decency to ask permission.
Do we know that things were handed off in sequence, or that they weren't
edited.  I don't know, and I own my words.  In any case, it would be good
to know next time.  My .02.

Thank you.

So what was I to do?  Exit like a sheep?  Quietly?  Then the question would
be that I was too drunk anyway.  Being told that somehow I had broken a
norm I was not aware of.  Or did the people on the danceflorr sleeping have
some greater right than I to be there.  Why was not my word given eaul
value as anyone elses?  Was I that unreasonable?  Why canp;t anyone tell me
what *I* actually did, since nobody has come forward with any information
contrary to my position?  WHy is everyone I know asking, well you must have
done something but are remiss to tell me what?

This reminds me of the sexual harassment suits.  A woman is asked to mop
floors, when that is not nearly her job.  Get coffee when she's an
executive.  Patted on the ass, or massaged.  Often the publics *initial*
reaction is "What did she do wrong?"  or "How was she dressed?".  The last
and final straw to add insult to injury is "They had to do something wrong
to warrant some behavior!".  Same with rape victims.  Their past is
flaunted for the public and often the person is painted to be some whore
for the public to crucify.

Now what happened to me was far from aa rape, or even sexual harassment,
Iand I do not want to belittle my sisters who struggles are too well
documetned to argue or to take as my own.  The point is, until you're on
the receiving end you'll never know.

These days you need a videotape for anyone to beleive yopu and even that is
not 100%, as Rodney King.

Don;t defend my position.  I don;t care.  All I do care about is that the
club community takes care fo thier own.  You're in this for $$$'s and to
have fun.  We know that.  But with those $$$'s and fun, you have a
responsibility to your patrons who are trsuting you with their hard earned
dollars and time to take good care of them.  Providce a positive space, and
ensure a good time.

Whether or not I cursed is immaterial; it was ex post facto to my ejection.
My Drinking is immaterial, since I had 5 drinks in 4 hours, and there were
others far more plastered than I.  The fact is I was not treated well, for
whatever reason, and I wish to have an apology, publicly or otherwise.  I
will not rest until this occurs.

You and otehr promoters may want to smokescreen this, but that will not
happen.  Rest assured.  The only thing you can do, honestly is make sure
your bases are covered and that it doesn;t happen at your club.  Be good to
the people that support you and you will thrive.  Ignore them and wither
into the past.

VSF is now known for having a problem, and people are looking every which
way to  see if it's true.  The club has a rep. and now has to live it down.

All character assasinations notwithstanding, I am the only outspoken one.
Unfortunately for VSF, they've picked the wrong person to mess with.


> Security is security and a lot
>of the security at VSF work at 1015, Sound Factory, 177 Townsend, and
>Cat's Grill as well.

Big deal.  They are also very, green.  Working at several places does not
qualify you as a verteran.  Mature and seasoned security, I have had no
problem with for some 15 years.  Greenhorn security, like that at VSF,
everyone, even Preston has had trouble with.

This seems to me like this promoter, like many others, scared of the
negative publicity that this incident offers.  The scarcity of spaces in
teh city adds to this anxiety.  Let's face it, if a club is known for
people noit having a good time, or the security, for whatever reason, being
overbearing, the news will get out, and atttendance will suffer.  It would
be better for VSf to fix it's house, so that people going there can have a
good time, in a safe, fun environment.  I am holding them to a flame, not
only because I can, but because I feel that I have been wronged.

>On the streets you argue with a cop you're gonna
>lose.

These are not cops.  Illogical.

> In a club you argue with a security guard you're gonna lose.
>Sucks but it's true.

No kidding.  The point was to find out why I was being ejected.  They have
yet to provide and asnwer, which leaves them totally suspect.  You may
dismiss this, but once this goes even more public, and is in the public eye
even more, they will not just have me to answer to , but every patron who
comes in thier.  No matter who they are.

> It's best not to get into a situation like that in
>the first place.

So tell me, and I'm sure otheres want to know.  What could I have done to
avoid this?

I'm listening.

John, 

Even if you had a camera taping the entire proceeding, by *your* own
account of the incident, it would not have proven racism. Again, by your
own account, race was never mentioned in any way, shape, or forum. You
*may* have shown that you were improperly picked on.

"But officer, everyone else was going 90 MPH too." 

Setting aside whatever occured, other people being more inebriated
than you isn't a valid argument...

I went to Music Works in El Cerrito (11225 san pablo ave) and they let me
rent-to-own a keyboard... you only have to pay 5% of the price of the
keyboard each month, and after 20 months you own it!  no interest charged,
you can't beat that!  got a roland xp-10 for $35 a month, sweet!

good luck,
 justin

I was going to try to make it this year, but haven't seen any of the new
info on the web yet (only 1997 stuff).  If you have any more info, I'm
sure the list would love to see it.

ok, lemme explain myself further..what i'm saying is i am not relying 
on the possibility of living to a hundred to live my life to the 
fullest.  i think that can be done by age 60 or so (VERY biased 
opinion...i know...) cuz if living to be 100 means being decrepid and 
invalid, then i don't want it, just to be alive and say that fact that 
i am 100 years old because i AM.  most of my friends will probably be 
dead when i'm a hundred (if) and more than likey i will have outlived 
many precious family members.  since i am one to cling to the past a 
lot, i don't see it fit that i live to be a hundred.  i think i can 
get the MOST out of life if i continue to live as i do...but i don't 
wanna let it DRAG out if that's what living to a hundred means.  i 
think a lot of ppl THINK they can make the most of every minute of 
life, but why wait until your a hundred? (i'm not saying you ARE 
waiting...i think a lot of us actually ARE living life to the fullest)
besides, age is just a number.  to me, it seems to be a relatively 
HIGH number and i question what MY life would be if i was 
hundred...life is what you make of it.  i don't see it NECESSARY for 
MYSELF to live to be a hundred for these reasons.  
from a darwinian perspective, with the population growing like a j 
curve, people living hella old only overpopulates and slows down the 
natural order of things...(NOT that these lives are not 
valuable..that's a whole other arguement...)
oh hell, now i'm going off on tangents...

Do you represent the Scene Negatively or Positively? It's all good.

How?  Evil is an illusion. I bring cosmic energy to the parties while
connecting the space to the core of the Earth. I like to visualize a giant
rose engulfing the space absorbing the fear. I activate Galactic
Frequencies according to the Mayan calendar. If you would like an
activation, please let me know.

Do you go to parties to hear the music or hook up? I go first to dance to
the phattest most ecstatic music. I always have the intention to meet
others. I have this snake inside me that sometimes I feel powerless to
control. But it's just a mirror of the attraction that others have for me.

This is my Galactic Signature according to the Mayan Calendar:

Adder,

You insist on people being treated on merit alone.  You also should insist
that people be treated equally.

These are not officers of the law.  Officers of the law will have their own
say, as will be proven shortly.

Despite what has been given, you and others have chosen to ignore this.
ABC will not ignore this, nor will others.  Once again, I did not mention
race in my post, I have said whatever if anything.  Please be accurate.  I
am saying that if anything they were arbitrary, and in this instance, they
have , unfortunately for them, picked on the wrong person.  Why has been
left up to them to answer, and to date they have been silent.

I have given them ample time.  Too bad that IMO they have chosen to spend
such time in an unwise fashion.  The rest will be left to those people who
really do have a say.

Wait and watch.  I am not the person you ever want to make an example of,
for whatever reason.

They just happened to pick on the wrong person.

"Officer, I am not just anyone, I am a person with clout.  You will pay for
this!"

And that is how this is shaping up.

This isn't make beleive, this is real life, with a real person, with a real
voice.

This will not stand, until *I* am satisfied.

I find it interesting that you would dismiss so gladhandedly and yet wonder
what it would take to convince you of my feelings:
-must I be called the *N* word?
-must I have been treated badly an acted in response as the submissive (I
do wonder why people abhor the rebel and insist on MLK analogies to meet
some criteria, instead of Cinque's, Haitians, or Malcolm X's).
-should my death prove to be that wrongdoing has occurred.

Sir, what is your standard for injustice?  What does it take to prove to
you that a wrong has been done.  Enumerate or hush dear sir.  For I and
others would surely like to know.

The problem here is  that they in thier misjudgement have picked on a
person who votes, is 33 years old, has never been ejected, has world
experience, political experience (I met, personally, more than one
President in my time mind you), and knows how to get a message across, and
most importantly feels wronged.

Basically the wrong Negro to fuck with.  My race is just an accent at this
point.  This is a raver who will not stand for bullshit, in a scene i
*helped to build!*! G*ddamit.  More than some, less than others.

So offer whatever excuses you may, there are other Af-Am's who can account
for said greivances, and other ravers of non-African descent who are
standing by me, and plenty of others who will be watching until an
explanation is offered.

Until then sir, it is nothing more than tainted parties held at VSF at best.

Rationalizations and excuses aside, they have fucked up , and will be
called to the carpet for it.

If you or others think that I'm going to be intimidated to let this go due
to your interpretation of events, with VSF being very silent (except for
it's cronies who continue to throw parties there), it only leaves them and
your motives suspect.

As I said before this is not over, and won't be over until I am offered
nothing more or less than an explanation of events.

Ravers:

You spend some $25-25 to get into a party.  What are YOUR expectations for
said dollars spent?  Do you exopect undercover cops trolling (as is the
case in Sugar Shack)?  Do you expect to be spied upon even when innocent?
Do you expect that you will be ejected for no other reason than talking to
other ravers?

What do *you* expect when you spend you hard earned $$$'s for a weekend of fun?

Most importantly, how do you expect to be treated, when you are acting like
everyone else?

Adder, you weren't there.  VSF has made no claims contradicting mine.  Why
then do you defend their actions so?

Does anyone expect hassle free partying , like in the *day* any more, or do
many of you expect problems with overzealous security?

Your thoughts are greatly appreciated.

Peace,
John

Ah, yes, those damned ethnic curses. Use good old american curses like
"Hey, fuck you, you fucking fuck" and you're just peachy. But mutter
something in Turkish about said security p*kker-head being an
amermenian sheep farmer who spent too much time with his pants down
behind the barn, and ... well... all bets are off.

> So what was I to do?  Exit like a sheep?

Huhuh. He said sheep. Huhuhuhuh. Whatever you do, don't exit like a
sheep. And don't let 'em put their arms around you and call you
"fluffy" either. After all, they may understand Turkish and your
armenian sheep-farmer joke may be taken as suggestive.  Would never
stand up in an amerikkkan court-o-law.

More seriously here, it's interesting to note the multiplicity of
voices here that immediately decided to blame the victim, and sided
against the underdog -- people that weren't there and figured that JSL
must have done something wrong to get evicted and that VSF's
wonder-goons couldn't have possibly misjudged anything. After all,
security is deputized to act in the interests of the safety of all, and
since they are so empowered, they must be right. Ah, images of a modern
rome (falling) dance in my head.... Whatever you do fellow romans and
countrymen, don't question authority or you might end up in the modern
equivalent of being another neo-roman US citizen thrown-to-the
Nielsen-lions on COPS or True Stories of the Highway Patrol.  Don't
worry, they already got gladiator fights at corcoran prison for the
aspiring misfits out there. Your duty now for the future begins with a
strict diet of dangerous steroids, methamphetamines, and twinkies.

Ahem...

PS: My conspiracy-theory is that some SFR PLUR wanker decided to get
even for getting flamed by JSL on SFR and thought-up some
ecstacy-addled fantasy that would spur the security-goons into action
(he pinched my teddy bear's ass! he fellated my fairy wand! he spooged
on my fuzzy pants!) ... Moral of the story -- never trust anybody that
utters the word "PLUR" without snickering or howling with derisive
laughter.

I just got back from working in Bangalore (Karnataka, India) for the
last 10 days... the weird thing about Bangalore is that there is
*nothing* going on in that town 'cept the
rent/work/shopping/restaurants and "social" parties where people show
off how rich and powerful they've become ... I'd ask around  where the
concerts are happning and they'd say "what concerts?"; I'd ask where
the parties are and they'd tell me about some bars where people get
drunk and sing silly english lyrics to songs I wish I'd never heard in
the first place.... I guess I'm just hangin' with too many compu-geeks
to find out where the cool parties are happening.  I hear the more
cosmo cities in India, e.g. Delhi, or Mumbai (bombay) are a *lot*
cooler... all I know is that  I've seen better Indian music record
selections in little shops in Cupertino than in BLR, so...

... so, anywayws, it was quite exciting to come home and find this
thread going.

My 2 paise:

* For people that enjoy the beat, I strongly second the recommendations of 
	-- Talvin Singh
	-- Bally Sagoo (heard something good off a new/upcoming album
	   of his recently, newer than his debut album).

* For a raggamuffin / hip-hop take on the indian thing, check
	-- Apache Indian

* For an interesting mix of Indian and Western musics, I used to listen
to UK/indian groups like (back in the late 80's....):
	-- Monsoon
	-- Sheila Chandra

* One of my most favorite albums recently was orchestrated and directed
by my brother in law Brian Woodbury and his friend Chris Rael. It's an
album of classic Indian film music from director S.D.Burman remade and
modernized with an interesting combination of western and eastern
musical styles.  It's sung by the popular English/Indian songstress
Najma.
	-- Najma, "Forbidden Kiss" the music of S.D. Burman
	   on Shanachie records (avail. "world music" section of tower).

* If you're interested in hearing a storm of tabla rhythm, check out
Zakir Hussain, who has many recordings on CD, and plays often in the
bay area. (Last spotted at the SF Jazz fest playing w/ John
McLaughlin).

* Since I work in India for 2-4 weeks every few months, I've picked up
a  bunch of interesting/weird/cheez CD's. I'd be up for swapping
recordings of these (I have an audio CD recorder) in exchange for
high-quality cassette or DAT copies of interesting musics you all have:
	-- Tick Tack Toe Dance Tracks from Tamil Films
		(some great, some cheeze)
	-- Super Hits of S.P. Bala & Harihran
		(ditto)
	-- Kadhal Desam, Sundara Prushan, Andhimantharan
		(cheeze, but interesting nonetheless)
	-- Golden Collections of A.R. Rahman, vols 1 + 2
		(some really interesting modern indian film/dance
		 music on here).
	-- Daler Mehndi, "Dardi Rab Rab" (the CD someone sold me
	   when I asked for Bhangra, thinking I'd get indian hip hop
	   rather than a pop-version of traditional Bhangra dance music.)
	-- Polygram India "Dance Attack"
	  	(mostly cheeze but has a few interesting Bally Sagoo,
		 an Asha Bhosle remix, and some Apache Indian choons).

Nice thing about buying CD's in India is that the new ones cost $5.00
(which makes sense, since it costs less than $1.00 to make a CD). In
other words, the $10-$30 you pay in the US per CD is pure PROFIT
(robbery) on the part of the music companies.

I'd still like to hear some good Indian-techno/house (which isn't trance,
most of the stuff I've heard doesn't quite schwang my thang...).

-->	So when do you want to set up the lunch/dinner? I'm gone next
Wednesday and won't be back until X-mas but def. back in time for Harmony.
Viet. food will cost about $5 for lunch and $10 for dinner (maybe more or
less depending on how many people split the bill). Why just have dinner;
why not make this an SFR day since we all posted a dating personal?  You
know, draw up a flexible schedule of meeting times and places throughout
the day and whoever can join will be there (with dinner as the goal). Then
again, Californians are such flakes I don't know if this will be
realistic (Oh no, a schedule)--I'm one of the worst offenders, but I
promise not to flake on the dinner thing :)

--I absolutely _adore_ pets.  I had a kitty once, but my dad gave him
away. I have had numerous dogs over the years (double entendre?) but am
doggless at the moment. I've also had birds, fishies, rodents, reptiles,
and the like.  I am presently living a lifestyle (I travel too much) and
in a place that isn't conducive to having pets :(  I miss them soooo much,
but I sometimes find satisfaction in plants.  Maybe it's a nurturing
thing, but I think it's just nice affectionate company that does not
require constant conversation. My favorite pets are fishies; i've been
keeping tropical fish for ages (since third grade) and always manage to
have a fresh or saltwater tank somewhere (not for the last couple of years
though). Fishes are so colorful and graceful, and I just spend hours
watching them; probably why I didn't buckle under stress more often. 
This has probably already been discussed, but what pets do you all have
("$20 a month will feed this child" and other kids not allowed to be
considered as pets--those toddler leashes are abominable)?

-->Don't you think the American attitude towards aging is somewhat
worrisome?  Being old does not necessarily imply being decrepit.  There
are many old people out there that have enough spunk to wear us young
things out to nothin'.  My maternal grandmother is 70 (80?) something and
still is  very active with friends, gardening, keeping toddlers, running
the house, etc. (until her stroke, but  that wasn't entirely due to age
mind you, it was due to internal strife-like thirtysomething people).  In
my culture the older the individual is, the more unconditional respect
that person deserves.  I know that sometimes sucks for the younger
generation, but we all will  get old and it's nice when the kids don't  go
around calling you Gramps and shoving yah of into the retirement home
(okay, go ahead, flame me for  that one :). IMHO, the key to having a good
life in the twilight years is to respect your body now in your youth and
taking care of it.  Occassional decadence and depravity is all nice and
well, but moderation should be everybody's mission.  I look at myself now
and I realize I need to get out more often for physical activity (I know
dancing for  12 hours straight every weekend  is excercise, but what about
the other  five  days, you know?), I should lay of all the Lay's and
Nabisco, and Pepsi-cola, and caffeine, and processed sugar, and fast food
lard that is my ever so healthy student diet and start preparing real
balanced meals again, and blah, blah, blah, and yaddy-yaddy-yaddy...and
join a convent and start a bread and water vow of silence in a nettle
shift, and oh, sorry, your not the alt.recreation.masochist.guilt group
are you? Well, you get the drift...age is not evil,  and all those rich
femmes getting face lifts and tucking sags and wearing Gucci micro-minies
should know that by now since they've been on this earth since the
Pre-cambrian period. Today's obsessive youth culture will come back and
bite you in the ass one of these days...as for me, I love being young and
gawjeous dahlink, but I wouldn't mind it when my sides turn argent either
(besides, I've done it already and it looks good  :)

Looks like a few are interested. After the holidays when people
have more time, we should all meet for dinner. I cant wait to

I just heard a report about some new experiments similar 
to the transporter on star trek. They managed to read the info
of a photon and transmit that (*) info so that a flash of light
that occured at one point was transmitted to another point. Not
an actual tansfer of matter but close since energy =matter

So perhaps one day we will be able to download our spirits
into electromagnetic waves just like the indian shamans
 become an eagle. We  could trannmit ourselves to (*) any place
 or time that uses win95.

Or even duplicate ourselves on another planet and reproduce ourselves
as many times as our liscensing agreement allowed. We could 
achieve imortality thru silicon(*) instead of carbon based bodies.

We probably couldnt drink coke(*) tho as it would errode our servos.

But we could however (*)dance for weeks to out internal dj's.

Maybe the world wide web is like a giant cocoon that we will soon 
wrap ourselves in like a catapillar and then emerge as
something beyond the organic worm or the techo-cocoon.

Maybe the (*)butterfly we are about to become is beyond human or machine...

Maybe aliens are infecting our email with subliminal(*) mesages that 
activate a mutation of our DNA to prepare us for the transformation....
maybe you should send(*) this to all your friends and warn them
before we all become little grey borgs or something.

Destroy the machine!...but lets wait till i finish my term paper ok?

> >Don't you think the American attitude towards aging is somewhat
> worrisome?  

oh, i'm not worried about growing old.  i'm not worrying about dying 
either, they are both inevitable.  i must admit, that my opinion stems 
from observing my grandparents.  a couple of years back, i visited my 
grandmother in a convelescent hospital and saw the 'other' end of 
life.  it saddened me quite a bit.  i say to myself..."i don't wanna 
end up HERE in the last years of MY life.." but what about the ppl 
that WERE there?  did THEY think they'd end up where they are NOW?  i 
bet atleast SOME of them were a bunch of young hellraisers that liked 
to party in their day.  have they lived their lives to the fullest by 
being hand fed three times a day by hired staff?
hmm...i question this...
we only end up how we CHOOSE to end up.
and honestly, from a stupid, american post teenage perspective, i 
think i'd kind of rather be dead at that point.
when me living MY life to the fullest becomes a burden upon other 
people, then i think i'm no longer living life to the fullest, only 
the minimal.

Mornin'

O.K. lets see got to Nikita early (11:00pm). Scott
DeKastano s/p was up first in the big room since
Jeno decided not to show (for the third time in two
weeks). I was busy chattin' with some folks so I 
couldn't really tell you anything but that he sounded
good from my spot and he's a pretty nice guy as well.

Around 12:00 Scott came walking up to me kinda' pissed
and said well Jeno finally showed and for some reason
they let him come on? Now correct me if I am wrong
promoters, but if you show up an hour late for a set
your ass should sit down and you shouldn't spin that
night. I think Jeno is a great DJ but thats pretty
dis-respectful to everyone. Once, I can see, under
certain circumstances, but three times in two weeks?

Jeno, needless to say tore shit up, a nice hard one
hour set. Then on to the real deal.

Not really knowing what to expect (I had heard good and
bad about Icey) but seeing his records around for
10 or more years and loving breakbeat I had to see for
myself.

I positioned myself right in front of the booth (sorry
to anyone who was there and trying to talk to me I 
was in class that night 8) and he started rollin' out
the beats. Every song was better than the next with
insane build-ups and just incredible beats. As my
buddies and I were trying to figure out this a+r label
that every other record was, Icey turns down the
monitor and says its my label out of Dallas now. They
are on Acetate? so they can only be used Like 20
times then you throw-em out. We were bummed, guess we
can't
get those 8) 

During the four hour set he played three
records that he didn't make! How can you compete with
someone who creates all the records he spins and knows
the music inside out? YOU CAN'T!!! He was in constant
contact with the lighting folks so when he was bringing
on the build-ups they new how many beats were left
fuck it was amazing. At one point the lights all
dropped and the beat lazed into this beautiful Diva's
voice singing and he throws his hands up in the air
and starts singing with her getting the crowd into 
a frenzy before dropping back into yet another
break-down. He was in constant conection with the crowd
grooving his ass off and he truly looked like he was
having a blast. By about the third hour he looked up
at me and pointed to tables asking if I spin, and I
nodded my head, then he smiled and went back to
spinning. As my friends and I were looking at the 
records he was spinning saying "I've never seen that
Icey,You!!?" He pulled this particular record off
the platter, turned down the monitor and handed it to
me. "This is one of a kind, there are no other copies!"
I said thanks with a huge smile and my friends looked
at me like, you dick!  He ended the set with Rollin'
Gear - I know - mixed with Low Down Good Girl. Fuck he
rocked 1015 big time!! After the show I rapped with
him for a few, just an all around cool guy. 

Hi to the SFRaves folks out there Liz, Meg, Diana,
Byron, Josh sorry I wasn't more talk-a-tive but
like I said I was in school 8)


Note: To DJ's who just sit there and
stare at the tables looking super intense and
expressionless- it says a lot to a crowd when its
obvious that you are enjoying what your doing and its
a hell of a lot more fun.

There's a fantasitc book out about this sort of thing, dealing with
mostly the internet and stuff, but it is about technology in general
and its effects on the way things work.  Good?  Bad?  We'll see . . .

It's called "Silicon Snake Oil: Second Thoughts on the Information
Highway" by Clifford Stoll.

Check it out.  (Advanced warning: he's a bit of a nut case, but he
knows his stuff!)

Of course, all of this is academic when you believe in reincarnation.

See you in the next one (have a good time),
Steve.

(Of course, I'm not done with this one by a damn sight, either).

HERE, HERE!

My grandfather (and grandmother) are in their 80's and they just bought a 5th
wheel and is traveling all over the united states. He still builds houses (he
is a carpenter) and he is still mentally sharp (although very opinionated.) :)

I love talking to him because he is interested in my lifestyle (raves,
technology, interactivity, etc.) and likes to prove to me how little things
actually change. He likens it to perception.

Anyway, I agree w/ Minh. Our attitude (Western) is very skewed when it comes
to our elders and aging.

Yep.... it's probably all about competition between members of the same
sex for some kind of gain to plac them higher on the totum (sP?) then the
rest. It's sad, why can't we all just be equal.... ??? :) Because some of
us lacked something in our lives and need to make up for it somehow...?
Perhaps..

What does Byroni do for a living??...  I help people over the phone with
my company's Routers/Terminal Adapters.... troubleshooting Wans, Isdn and
T1. It's getting borrrrrring. I need to find something more challenging
and that pays more!.... :) I'm going to wait until April (2 years here)
and make some serious decisions. (In case anyone other than Danny cares...
) hehe..

Hugs...

Well my weekend started off at 1015 Folsom on Friday
night. The guest for the evening was DJ Icey.. Now I
kind of wanted to see him but he is not really my
thing but anybody that can press a rekkid every other
week I thought but be interesting to see. After a
long sketchy misson of trying to get to different
locations to meet up with me crew. (Running on raver
time of course) I finally hook up with Byroni and
crew and we head out. We step in and it is wall to
wall packed people grooving out to ICey and lasers
everywhere and the nice 6 way digitial sound was
great. However let me just say that I respect all
DJ's and Rekkid producer but He threw a Fucking
Brick... He was totally on and is good Technically
but the tracks he dropped were shitty (IMO) it was
like the cheezy rekkids he prouduces but as someone
posted prior to me they were his acetates that he
made. I can appreciate some good acid breaks but
there are like certain degrees and his were really
cheezie and I was not into it. In addition to that
the crowd at 1015 has to be the worst. For those of
you that have been to that meat market know what im
talking about. There was a lot of pushy rude people.
But Icey gets off and David Michael gets on and
totally rocks my world. This kid is so good. He was
dropping Phat Acid/Tribal/Breaky House it was all
mixed up and it was crazy good. I don't know why this
kid does not get any other play outside 1015 we was
good Technically and his choice of tracks were nice
and smooth very buildy floaty he takes you on that
trip. BTW he is the kewliest guy you will ever meet
he is a nice humble guy I have had the pleasure to
play at his weekly gig that he use to do and also I
have played at a party with him before. If you get a
chance to hear him DO he rocks!! over all I had a
decent time. Saturday I Played with Vertigo at a
small house party at the "EBF house" Hello Tony... it
was kewl really packed if you have ever been to the
EBF house you know what im talking about very small.
There was like 50 peeps there real hot but nice
peeps. From there I went to Thomas Troubles party. It
was at the T&J factory I like that space. You would
hav thought it would get busted in 2 seconds but it
did not very low key. Only about 200 peeps. nice and
roomy good traks being played Thomas has a nice sound
system no too loud but loud enough. visuals and
little lasers and such. Nice crowd lots of smilling
faces, family type of vibey atmosphere. Hung out
there for a while chit chatted then I got way to
tired and it was really rainy so I headed out. Then
sunday I going to work on my tape but I felt lazy so
I did not. I know <Bad DJ boy, Bad>
I will be working on that this week so stay tuned.

Peace,love, and cyber sex..  P.S. Don't take last
line literally...

I am just wondering, I thought Icey's music was quite
bomb on Friday, but I have recieved some other
opinions, just curious what you thought. I would hate
to spin his stuff out and have people not like it.

Who cares what people think - you can't take a poll before you buy every
record. If you like it, play it.

Layne,

I didn't like it very much..... thought it was cheesy and didn't have
enough rhythm for full funkdom....  I can't dig breaks too much... they're
cool to chill to for a little while, but to dance to them for 3 hours is a
bit of a "challenge"... I need music that has intensity, progression,
soul, jazziness...... it was up-down-up-down.....  I agree with macadio...
too many cheezy tracks.....   I was on E and still couldn't feel it.....
which says a lot.....  normally when you're on E and music is half way
descent it can be danced to.... it was an effort.....  but i enjoyed David
Michael.... :) And when I say "E" I'm refering to the Vitamin. :)

This is just my opinion... as a guy who liks a lot of soul, jazz and
deep emotion in his music....  I love retroy disco too.... so I'm just a
bird of a nother feather..... what I see as soulful, jazzy and deep is my
own taste.... so I'm not saying his tracks lacked these qualities for
others... just me.

Believe me tho... there are TONNNNNS of people who like DJ ICEY and went
nuts....  so don't let a few people's opinions spoil your taste in music.

Hey Byroni,

Thanks for your opinion. I think I should have worded
this differently. I didn't mean to say that I would
never spin his stuff if others didn't like it, more
like I was curious to see how many people did like it.
Does that make any sense? Just curiosity!

Thanks brother
Layne

Oh and David is the shit, you can count on it
regularly.

Good evening for some of you...

I sit here now, when many of us should be setting up, driving to, or calling
for a renegade pary to-nite.  Due to some unfortunate curcumstances involving
our sound and light crew the van to be used for shuttle and map point be came
unavalible.  The party technically could of happened however RAS would have to
charge for the event.  

And pesonally, I'm very against the notion of throwing a "break-in" party and
charging for it.

So, to compensate for the dissapointment of a 'failed' event, we're
negotiating a make up party or pushing _Polaris_ up to an early-January date.
As well as bringing our admisson charge down to unheard-of pricing (c'mon
promoters when did 15$ become a 'standard' price??).

So right now, a few of us sit @ Rebel Post #4 --- My bro's house in Sunnyvale.
Bout' three of us are here,  Cyber chatting, fading, and mixing in "The
Vault"...  
    ...And allthough I dont know how fast AOL email is if, anyone else is
bored drop by, (510.218.7494) and chat,420, spin wiht those that plot and plan
for your next UG...

*ANY* mention of race whatsoever when ejecting you. Any offhanded remarks
made by any of the staff towards you or any of your friends. *ANYTHING* to
substanciate your claim.

I was just pointing out the shortcoming of your reasoning. Because someone
else is doing something, it does not excuse you from liability from doing
the same thing.

I am not ignoring it. I have responded to you several times on this issue.
And I am not, and have not said that their motivations were not racial in
nature, which up to now seems to have been your overriding belief. What I
have said, is that by your own account, you have proven absolutely nothing
of the sort to me at least.. If you have changed your tack to having just
been ejected unfairly, then again from *your* account it sounds like your
claims might have serious merit, and I wish you the best of luck in
bringing attention to the issue of security and the mistreatment of
patrons at clubs/concerts/etc. 

> I find it interesting that you would dismiss so gladhandedly and yet wonder

Now you are contradicting yourself. Please look at the above where you
state that you never mentioned race. I just get the overwhelming feeling
that you *want* this to be a racial issue. 

> Sir, what is your standard for injustice?  What does it take to prove to

For one, both sides of the story. There are always two(or more.) You are
leveling some very grave charges. 

To reiterate, if you are saying that you were ejected unfairly, then it
sounds like you have some serious merit in your statements. I have seen
security at clubs/concerts do some pretty out-of-line things, and have
also been treated unfairly and rudely by security in the past. 

If in addition you are stating that the reason for this is racial in
nature, *and* all the evidence you have to offer is what you have provided
already, then you haven't proven this point.

I don't offer excuses or explanations. All I am doing is pointing out the
fairly large flaws in your logic. I haven't denied that these things
occured for the exact reasons you purport. I cannot do that.

Maybe you do. I don't.

For about the third time(in just this post), I do not defend their
actions. As you say, I wasn't there.

Sometimes I think, only when they are in agreement with yours...

Hello everyone,

I was able to experience the complete set of Doctor Martin on Saturday
at Big Heart City. I enjoyed his set very much.

His setup that night were two technics 1200mk2 and a rane MP24x. He
plugged in his own phones, Sony V6, I think.

Doctor Martin came in with two flight cases, one hard, one soft. He
organized the records into two bins (different styles of music? one bin
per turntable?) and kept an empty one off to the side to put the records
he was done with in. If he wanted to reuse a record, he would just lay
it on top of one of the bins. He usually kept the left turntable dark
while the right one kept it's guide light on.

His records were good. DAMN good. A lot of them switched their rhythm
halfway through the song which helped keep things interesting. He
usually dropped the other platter around these transitions; pretty good
timing, letting the songs run their course while giving himself plenty
of time to beatmatch.

He played a few acappella vox records over his records. One that I liked
was a record which was going on about how "House is a vibe, a soul, etc"
and then dropped the "I am the creator" vox on top of that. Strong
female staccato vox over quieter reflective male vox. Simply beautiful.

Doctor Martin did do his upside down record thing. He got out a big
plastic base thing and put that on the turntable, then the record, then
some kinda endcap to keep the record down. He too the needle and turned
it over, adjusted the weight, and placed the needle on the underside of
the record. He did take some time setting the needle, but after it was
there, he didn't wind the record or anything to catch the music phrase
at the beginning, he just beatmatched and faded it in. A really, really
nice sound. The record he chose was perfect to play backwards soundwise.
4/4 time, minimal, clean, enough ride and bass to let you know what was
going on. I wonder where you can get those plastic base things, or if he
made it himself...

He knew his songs really damn well. The most magic I experienced from
his set would probably be his eq manipulation. Even when playing the
same record, he knew when other instruments would be coming in, when the
breakbeat or tempo change would occur, and used this knowledge for the
Forces of Good, making the same song sound different in 24 different
ways (4! combinations for 4 dials, I think).

He had to end a bit early for some kinda Big Heart City policy reason.
He was kinda bummed about it but worked with the BHC crew and ended it
when he had to. He mentioned he played there (first?) in 1990 NYE.

Some tips I picked up from his set:
* When beatmatching, start the record fast then slow it down. That way
you know your record is fast and have only one way to adjust
accordingly.
* If you have time, try listening to the record for awhile. This way,
you will be more sure what the tempo difference is and can pick up the
phrasing of the music easily and know when and where to wind the record
to for best mixing.
* Have really damn good records ;) Also pick up a few acappella vox
records if you can. Records which change in the middle of the song is a
goodness as well.

Doc Martin had a great set, the people really liked it, it wasn't too
crazy but the energy level was nice. He was friendly, but did
concentrate mostly on the music during his set. Doc Martin was very
consistent throughout the set and he was into the music. For house, he's
the greatest I've seen so far.

Cheers,
james

Because I knowingly choose to do things that are "bad" for me. Such as the
food I eat. My diet would make a health-food nut scream. However, I enjoy
what I eat. Given the choice of eating what I want, as opposed to living
off of nut n' berries and soy milk so I can live longer, I much prefer the
former to the latter.

Wow. Yea..

Please confirm. Have you actually gotten rid of the San Jose Hip Hop

Don't be fooled into thinking that you like certain kinds of food, so
that's what you should continue to have to enjoy yourself.  Taste is rich
in information, a very sensual sense indeed.  But it is ultimately up to
YOU to decide what to "like" and what to hate.

I bet it would only take you a couple weeks of eating a new food, knowing
that it's healthy for you, before you begin to actually like it.  The brain
is a very programmable thing, and such self-preserving tasks as
establishing healthy eating patterns can't be that hard to accomplish.  I
remember "forcing" myself to switch to nonfat milk when I was cutting
weight for wrestling in high school.  Only a few weeks later, lowfat milk
was too creamy and whole milk was simply disgustin.  To this day, I can't
stand the taste of whole milk; I must have conditioned myself pretty well,
seeing as how I used to love drinking fresh milk with the warm foam.

I used to hate garlic and onions; they're taste seemed horrendous.  One day
I decided to TRY to like them, knowing it would be good for my blood.
Ignoring the taste was not possible, so I just kind of sat back and
observed it.  I saw taste as information that I could use to create a
sensation of my own choosing.  I came to associate the intense taste of raw
garlic with a that feeling of wellness you get when you take vitamins, the
feeling that you are doing your body a favor.  I soon came to love the
intensity of garlic; after eating a clove I would relish in the
light-headedness that followed.

Food is one of the greatest pleasures in this material world.  I think it's
important to guide and nurture that pleasure in the right direction.  The
pleasure from knowing you're fostering healthy growth/maintenance of your
body far surpasses the "quickie" thrill of eating a candy bar or a bag of
potato chips.

Peace, love, and granola,

Magos

Perhaps if you took some of your own advice, in a couple of weeks you'd be
drinking cream straight from the carton.

Blashhemer! ;-) Garlic&Onions are two of the greatest things known to
(wo)man. Sauteed in plenty of artery-clogging butter of course.

Again, it is a basic difference in philosophy. I don't question the choice
of those that choose to eat as healthy as they want. I don't turn an
upturned nose towards them and talk to them about how they should be more
decadent. It's my choice and I am happy with it. 

On the other hand, I have noticed many health-food fanatics do tend to
look down on others who do not share their "enlightened" viewpoints, and
tend to lecture them ad nauseum about their choice in diet. I rank them
somewhere around Jehovah's Witnesses in both their zeal and the import I
give their words. 

Live and let live.

Black Adder's logic doesn't add up.  He says that just because others
were more intoxicated doesn't "excuse" the fact that jslee had a few
drinks.  I'd rather ask, what was the excuse of "security" for ejecting
him rather than those who were more out of it (even asleep, for whatever
reason)?  Did John aggressively demand that the bartender put another lime
in his drink?  Did he shake a hand or hug someone
without the approved angle of rotation?  Did he accost the DJ and
demand a rewind of "Move Your Body"?  Did he do the John Travolta Dance
on the way to the bathroom?  Did he build an 18-storey Cup Tower of Pisa
out of upside-down plastic cups and then knock it all over the dancefloor?

Or was he just someone the "security" decided to make an example of?

John stated that his drinking was immaterial to his ejection because
others around him were more inebriated. I find a large flaw in that
reasoning. Even if everyone else had 10 drinks more than you it does not
make you sober. I was not and am not stating that John acted the drunken
fool. Just that the logic in reaching the conclusion that his drinking
was immaterial is flawed. And it is. And I utilized an analogy to point
this out.

Oh I agree wholeheartedly. Again, my comments were in no way intended to
"take sides" with VSF security over John. All I am doing is pointing out
what is in my opinion poor reasoning on John's part. If you utilize
erroneous reasoning in reaching a conclusion, then barring dumb luck, that
conclusion is most likely erroneous as well. 

> Or was he just someone the "security" decided to make an example of?

Quite possibly. And I would be most interested in knowing this as well.
Given John's version of the story, and Geoff and Megan backing it up, I
do find their actions suspect and one that warrants explanation. And I
really hope he gets it. From what I have witnessed in my years as a
concert/party goer I think that all too often security is not held
accountable for questionable actions, allowing them to play "little
dictator."

I have a american indian cd called dance to trance moon spirits.
It comes from england on logic records and produced by bmg.

Its similar to east indian but defiantely from turtle island.
Really good mix of tribal music and trance.

A couple other that are similar:
 A world without rules by paul heslinger and
  Tantric Steps by technova

Ok enough about the music, lets get back to our regular discussions
about sex, racism and tofu vs cows =)

I feel sorry for any that gets conned into going to treasure island.
With space children involved you know it will be a big disapointment
compared to the dozens of other choices for that evening.

Even on a good night with no competition space children cant even get a 
thousand people any more, there lucky if they get 200. With so many 
other choices and the price they are charging and the thousands who
are very upset at their recent behavior you can easily see this party
will be a waste and then you are not only stuck on the freezing island
but you've wasted your new years and your money.

The word is out that they are not paying their bills and most dj's
wont go on until they get paid up front and with no ticket sales
there will be no cash to pay these people. I was the guy that had to deal with 
all the angry people wanting there money back from there other recent
parties so i do know what im talking about. 

Sorry to be so negative on this beautiful monday morning
but i do hope no one falls for the hype and wastes their 
new years eve on this concert. They have had some great parties
in the past but things have Definately changed in the last few months.

The people that give you the gatherings are also doing a massive
that night if a massive is what you are looking for. Plus
all the great smaller parties.

I think each person needs to make their own choice as to what they eat.
One mans (or womans) poison is anothers pudding.

I used to feel the same way as Black adder about eating what 
ever feels good and i think that is still a good philosophy.

My difference is when i say "feels good" i tend tend to think of 
that in longer terms. For instance i used to love coffee
because it felt good in the moment but over a period of
time it made me feel jittery and even sick at times.
I  generally chose the long term feeling of pleasure over the
short term. Not that this choice is better...just the one
i made. I certainly like the instant feel good response
of various substances but i also look at the long term feelings.
Take cigarettes...i used to love them because they felt good.
I eventually quit not because they were "bad" but because of 
the long term pain...like gaging and choking in the morning
made me feel worse that the momentary pleasure they brought.

But i still feel we all need to make our own choices and
keep the freedom to do as we choose. And we need to respect those
that choose something else.

ps..is any one else addicted to the vegi satay and other wonderful
vegi food at veechas on haight st? That would be a great place
to have a sfraves dinner and they also have dead animals there
for those that eat them =)

you are what you eat...so eat live food if you want to feel alive.

we headed to the oakland airport pretty early as we weren't sure how
bad traffic would be.  besides, it's hard to get much work done in a
santa suit - for some reason the women in the office kept sitting in
my lap and telling me what they wanted for christmas.  4 other santas
were arriving in a limo as we walked into the lobby, and as we had
over an hour to kill we all headed straight for the bar.  i started my
downward spiral into drunken debauchery by downing a shot of bourbon
with a beer chaser.  followed by more beer.  as the alcohol flowed, a
few more santas and ms clauses arrived.  then a few more.  and a few
more still.  within thirty minutes there were 40 of us at least,
rapidly getting trashed as bewildered travelers looked on in
bemusement and disgust.  someone passed out presents wrapped in pages
from porno magazines.  "be careful who you give these to, last year
one of the santa's went to jail for giving a couple of copulating
dinosaurs to a five year old..."

there were probably 100 santas on the flight to burbank, needless to
say we were fairly boisterous.  luckily the flight staff decided not
to press charges.  upon arrival we hooked up with some of the l.a.
santas, and we all piled into four large busses and headed to a kitchy
german-american bar on sunset, conveniently located near the seedy
motel where most of us were staying.  as we gathered on the rooftop
patio, i realized what a scary, bizzare sight we made.  the space,
which was fairly large, was wall to wall santa's and mz. santas. 
there must have been about 250 of us.  while most santas were dressed
in the traditional red suit and white beard, they all looked slightly,
well... off.  green hair spilled from underneath red hats, tatoos
peeked out from the sleeves.  one mrs santa with bright red hair wore
red fishnets, white fur-lined lingerie, and not much else.  guess the
la nighttime chill was mild compared to the north pole.  we all downed
multiple massive stiens of german beer.  eventually i made my way
downstairs, where santa's were harassing the regulars to the strains
of cheesy christmas carols played by the oh-so-suave lounge
keyboardist in the corner.  after we all got kicked out of the bar,
many of us wound up at a party in the surrounding hills.  eventually
at 5:30 or so my five friends and i wandered back to crash in our
hotel room.

the next morning, i ate a proper santa breakfast of pancakes, coffee
and beer at the farmers market, while trying to explain the santa
onslaught to a couple of tourists in a cigarette-stained morning after
voice.  "this is a tough time of year for us santas.  you know -
endless malls, parades and tv spots.  sittin on some cardboard throne
for enless hours while little brats shamelessly beg for some stupid
toy they saw on tv.  then they piss on your lap.  god i hate kids. 
we're just lettin off a little steam, that's all..."  i'd never been
to l.a. before, so i was hyped to check out all the sights.  the
afternoon blurred together in an alcoholic haze: buff black queer men
bench pressing mrs santas on muscle beach...  the santa pile-up on the
lone l. ron. hubbard winter wonderland santa...  at some point i
vaguely remember talking to a trio of girls, who looked to be about 15
years old.  "ho ho ho, you girls been good this year?"  "um, yeah,
giggle giggle"  "well, now, let's just make sure, whats your name?" 
"uh, kim, tee hee hee..."  "well, now kim,  are you sure you haven't
been naughty this year?  maybe just a little bit?"  "well, not _too_
naughty, giggle giggle"  "well, just remember - i see you when your
sleeping, i know when your awake...  as a matter of fact, i saw you
getting out of the shower this morning...  enjoyed it so much i
rewound it and watched it again..."  "SANTA!  (hee hee hee giggle
giggle)"  "so hey, why don't you give me your phone number, maybe we
could hook up a little later.  aww come on now, doncha remember when i
gave you that barbie dreamhouse when you were seven?  i wont tell your
parents..."  finally wound up at the observatory overlooking the
glowing la sprawl as fireworks exploded in the distance.  a santa with
a megaphone announced to the santas and children milling about the
pendulum: "come on santas, we've got to leave in 5 minutes if we want
to get into the titty bar for free!"  "YYYYYEEEAAAHHH! HO! HO! HO! HO!
HO!"

the sight of all those santas lining up to get into "sunset strip" was
funnier than anything i'd seen all day, but that was nothing compared
to the carnage occurring inside.  i got a gin and tonic, downed it,
then a beer, and some change for tips.  i offered the stripper on
stage a finsky with my teeth.  she sucked on it for a minute, grabbed
it with her teeth, then stuck her tongue down my throat.  "no
pictures, all santas please stop taking pictures of the strippers!"  i
got a birthday lapdance for one of my santa friends, then got one
myself.  then watched as more santas and mrs santas lined up to rub
groins with the strippers on the leather couches in the dimly lit back
room.  then i had another drink or two.  after several more girls got
nasty on the main stage, the dj kicked in "hell's bells" by ac/dc, and
about two dozen ms clauses stormed the stage.  i stuffed a ten-spot
down the red haired santa's bra with my teeth.  then she licked my
face.  bills bras and santa suits littered the stage, i think i must
have blown $100 in an hour, and i'm sure i wasn't the only one, but we
were still so rowdy they turned off the music and kicked us out,
threatening to call the cops.  there were already a couple of santas
in jail for crystal meth possession, so we all got while the gettin
was good.

after dinner in a plush but disgusting mexican restaurant, all the
santas headed to the palace to storm the mosh pit at a punk rock show.
 fights ensued, the cops were called again.  finally at midnight we
ritually hung a santa at a rockabilly club as the santa hordes chanted
"naughty!  naughty!  naughty!"  afterwards many of the santas headed
back to the stadium motel to crash, but i managed to drag seven other
santas and santa-ettes to after hours at "club lingerie".

the club was nice, all metal and film loops, the clubbers clean, cool,
and beautiful.  we headed straight to the dance floor.  hmmm, seven
bedraggled santas dancing like maniacs, and everyone's pretending not
to notice.  well, maybe they'd notice if we jumped up on the main
stage in at the front of the room with the strobe lights flashing from
underneath the glass floor?  nope, somehow we're still invisible. 
well, surely they'd notice a shirtless tatooed santa in dark
sunglasses dirty dancing with mrs cluas on top of the bass bin 12 feet
above the crowd?  "no, we don't see you, there is no santa claus, it
was just our parents..."  hmmm, tough crowd those la clubbers. 
whatever...  we got a $30 cab ride back to the motel, and mrs claus
and i lay in bed listening to my friends stumbling around, laughing,
jumping on the bed and falling over in the room over ours till after
sunrise...

after beer and brunch the next morning we headed to the airport.  "i
wonder if i'd get in trouble if i called in sick tommorrow?" i asked
the ms santa sitting next to me.  "i dunno?  are you sick?"  "well... 
i'm sitting at an airport bar in burbank surrounded by fifty other
santas, drinking boilermakers at two in the afternoon, broke, covered
in sand and woodchips, reeking of booze, barf, reefer and sex.  i've
slept maybe 4 hours in the last two days, i'm hung over, my arms hurt
from lifting too much at muscle beach, and the bartender just cut me
off.  suppose i must be..."

the plane flight home was even more out of control than the flight
down, the stewardesses were really getting mad this time.  someone
passed out free drink cupons, "HO HO HO!  MORE BOOZE, MORE BOOZE!" 
several santa's at the front of the aisle entertained us with an
impromptu "barf bag puppet theatre".  it was amusing.  as we flew in
through the turbulence for a rough landing several santa's started
chanting "end up! end up! end up!"  well, it made perfect sense,
really.  so the end up it was, i was utterly exhausted, but as i
danced my white beard glowed like a new pair of white shoelaces in the
black light...

For the PHATTEST "House" party go to "Toon Town,By the
People,Basics,Come-Unity"... info line number: 415-437-4462

The vibe at this party will be so tight and creamy that you won't be able
(like you'll want to) slice it with a laser. A lot of HOUSE baby.

Space Children.... hahahahahaha!... they had beautiful people like us
supporting them and now they have finally paid the piper...
BADVIBES=BADFUTURE!... haha... :P I have love for people (and I had love
for Space Children) but I have no love in my heart for those guys
anymore....   $$$ isn't what this scene is about.... and those who try to
exploit the scene shall pay.... :)

children smiling."

Okay, how about those of us who aren't into the house thing?  I am
looking for a good party with lots of trance, d&b, ambient groovz,
and will avoid a house room/party like a poisonous insect.

Any suggestions? (I also have a bad feeling about treasure island).

Steve.

Hello folks,

For the time being I'm gonna go back on the list, but only for the 
purpose of hearing what my beloved friends have to say...That I miss . I 
finally finished all my graduation requirments at UCSC...it was quite 
excrusiating (sp?) Well, it's over and I have some time off before I 
start towards rl life, so despite the all the flaming, and just general 
making people feel bad here (ie bad vibes...whatever,) I'd kinda like to 
be able to comunicate with all of my friends here, so here I am. *doh!*

Anywayz, just in case any of you are wondering about the whole 
"playground" incident, I'll fill you all in. As many know we had 
posponed the party due to losing our location because of some "broken 
promises." Which for any of you who know what I'm talking about...I'm 
not as sour as you might think...a simple apology would be 
excepted...but I havent heard it yet. Anywayz, the Psychofunk crew, has 
kinda lost it's motivation...and therefore I've decided to go out on my 
own, and throw a smaller party, with hopefully one room being the same 
main room as we had in "playground." I'm actively seeking a "smaller" 
location for it now so if any of you have any leads...let me know. As 
always, I'll keep everyone updated on that through the list.
Also, if anyone is interested, in the next few weeks I'm going to be 
recording a mix tape of myself, (Hard--acid--cybertrance type stuff) and 
should have copies ready in about a month. 

I was also wondering if any here has Boy Wonder (Aaron's) phone or pager 
number...I need to get in touch with him and I'm not sure if he's on the 
list.  

Alrighty...that's all folks, hopefully i'll be seeing most of you 
soon...if not, have a happy holiday :-P

-matt-

I went out all weekend!  I went to that KMFDM show and really dug Rammstein. 
 Much better, IMO, than KMFDM.  Sure Nivek Ogre was a sight, but I preferred 
the dancer and Raymond Watts.  Anybody else out there agree with me?  It wasn't 
until the end did they play anything good (KMFDM).  Is it just me or did they 
majorly take a trip downhill?  I love their old stuff and I can't stand their 
new stuff!

Anybody go to Atari Teenage Riot at Slim's on Friday?  I got to see a very 
influential Digital Hardcore badn and some others on Alec Empire's label.  The 
show was fabulous!  I missed EC8OR but I did catch Shizuo.  They were ok, but I 
didn't really care for that dancer.  She was wearing a little black dress, 
black lace stockings and a garter belt.  She flashed the audience from time to 
time and kept most of the eyes on stage while they tore up the stage.  They are 
nice guys but they don't get a groove going to say the least!  I really want to 
know what that dancer was dancing too!  The music was a bit difficult to pick 
up any kind of rhythm but she went at it slowly and without any sort of pace. 
 It kept me interested for about 5 minutes because I couldn't believe what i 
was seeing!  But anyways, back to ATR.  ATR rocked the house with some phat ass 
phast ass beats!  Riot sound effects can produce riots!  Damn, that Alec Empire 
really knows how to kick some ass!  It was strange to see Carl Crack with hair! 
 Hanin was a sweetie.  She was so friendly.  At least after the show.  I got to 
meet them all.  Alec Empire!  I love his solo DJing stuff.  He's great.  Jello 
Biafra was there as well.  He came to talk to Alec about some funky shit! 
 German Porn soundtracks and some other stuff I wasn't too clear on.  Strange 
guy that Biafra!  New ATR should be out next year if anyone is interested!

I also went to BT on Sunday.  Boy was that a mistake.  $15 bucks and the crowd 
didn't gather until 1am!  I had to work the next day and let me tell you, I 
haven't slept in like 3 days as it is!  I am dying here at work!  I came in at 
6:30 in the morning and I haven't taken a lunch or any kind of break!  I feel 
like crap!
I was supposed to meet some friends there but they decided not to show...  But 
that's ok.  One had finals and another had a birthday party for his granddad. 
 And another one decided she had better plans!  You know who you are!  But 
don't worry, I don't hold grudges.  ~Blowing Kisses!!!  Did you catch them?  BT 
played a nice set and got more people dancing.  It was pretty bare in the 
beginning!  I was too shy to talk to anybody but my friends.  I was sitting 
down while they danced for a while.  But I got something to drink and started 
to strut my stuff!  He played a good set too.  I was expecting a party though. 
 Ooops!

And my weekend is extended one more day!  I haven't been to sleep and I feel 
like passing out.  I am so famished!  I need nourishment!  Gotta get some 
sleep!  I had a great weekend...  I just wish I could have met some of you!

Your Jedi Bitch,
Jedi666Boy

Any one coming to no-tv tonight?
Only $5 before 10pm, I think its $7 after that, not sure.

They have the place so well set up that you will forget you
are in a club. I rarely go to clubs but what they have done
there is pretty amazing. It feels like you are in someones
living room with great music and wonderful happy and kind
people. Plus the decor and special effect are great.

Its also close to solstice so if you like, bring
a candle or something....we can set up an alter
for the coming year. I will be bringing my medicine
cards and some astrology stuff and there is also
lots of art stuff there too.

Name (or Nickname) um, Leslie  (the artist formerly known as the fairy rave
mother)

What is your Age= 44, a nice symmetrical number, don't you think?

Birthday 11-21

What is your Sign=  Scorpio ... with Gemini moon, Aries rising, and lots of
other strong Scorpio influences

Are you Married= used to be, for a long long time, to a super-nice artist
who looks like an elf

Have Kids= come meet my daughter Emily (she's 19) at Harmony's Beautiful
People if you haven't met her yet  (kids are the happiest thing that can
ever happen in your life!)

Are you Single= Yep

Do you Dj = No, I leave that to the ones who have the urge, and who are
strong enough to lug those damned record cases .... I'd rather dance, and
as we all know, most djs just don't dance (except in their head, right, G?)

What is your most listened to Style of Music?  I like funky shit... whether
it's trance or house or jungle, give me a funky bassline and let me go!

Musician / Artist= let's see, i played the violin for 10 years in school,
and studied art in school... does that count?

Hobbies= I study astrology and tarot, read odd anthropological accounts of
life with the pygmies and such, love baseball and the Giants, watch too
much tv, scour the thrift stores for crazy clothes, collect and make hats,
collect antiques and paintings and bizarre things.

Mission In Life= I've learned that my true mission here is to inspire
others to express who they are, to reinforce their own confidence that they
can change the world, and that you don't have to buy into someone else's
ideas of what you're "supposed" to be or do because of your gender, age,
family background, whatever.  And I can do that through my own actions and
choices, cuz if it works for me, then it will work for anyone!

Do you represent the Scene Negatively or Positively? = I like to think that
I represent the scene realistically, hoping that I am at the positive tip
of it, but helping us to keep our eyes open to the other side, which is a
real one.

How? I make it a point to not hide the fact that I'm a "raver" even when
I'm talking to people from that other world who previously thought we're
all cracked-out freaks... because unless we show them the truth, how will
they learn?

Do you go to parties to hear the music or hook up with the oposite
sex? You mean you can go to parties to hook up with the opposite sex?
Geez, that's why I go to clubs!  I go to parties to dance and hang out with
my friends!

Interesting.  Once again the point here is that I was singled out, for
reasons unknown.  The only delta is my race.  That pretty much sums it up.
As for racism, mentioning of race is only one indicator.  I do not have
recordings of what was said between the guards.  All I know is that at
Stompy's held at VSF there have been several incidents of black males being
ejected for various vague reasons.  This may not prove racist intent, but
it's good enough for me.  I could care less if they're racist or not.  My
feeling is that I was singled out for behaving as one should at a party.
That is why I'm pissed.  The race issue is just icing on the cake.  Take
that away, I'm still angry.

My reasoning has no shortcomings.  How about this, please tell me *your*
reasons why I was ejected.

That is all I'm asking of VSF.  But thier silence is more telling than all
of this banter back and forth over race.

Nope, it's just one of the factors.  Strong or weak, you cannot ignore
patterns Adder.

I am not out to prove anything, so your proceed from a false premise.  I
only want an explanation then an apology from VSF.

Pretty easy.  It seems you are looking for even more than I.  I do not need
to make anyone believe me, all *I* know is that I was wronged, and *I* will
right it by various means.

That is the overall larger issue I've been talking about.  The mistreatment
of those who make VSF money and who make it possible for them to have the
crowds they do, spending the money they do in that place.  Race, in the
overall big picture , is just another artifact of VSF's poor security.

Then quit asking me to present both sides.  Talk to the people at VSF and
get their side.  All I can offer is my view of events, which can be
corroborated by many of the people in attendance.  Too bad you weren't
there to witness it yourself.  Next time, I'll bring in a hidden camera and
videotape the events.

Sheesh.

Nope.  You have mentioned race more than I at this point.  Dig, if I see
racism I do not need to clear it with you in order to be convinced.  In
life things are not so clearly defined, and you are far from being the
final arbiter of truth.  Situtations happen that leave suspect the notion
of merit.

Unless you were there then no amount of recounting or convincing will prove
race was a factopr unless I have a tape of them saying things.

So to continue with this argument for argument sake is tedious.  I cannot
convince you of my feelings, after all they are my feelings, and I need not
prove them to anybody to consider them real.

In real court cases of harassment, sexual or otherwise, it is not only
intent, but perceptions.  Since this is not a court, and since you are not
judge, I see no need in going farther with this argument.

Then what sir is your point?  If you want the other side, *call VSF*.  My
story is backed up by more than my lady (Megan), and my man (Geoff W).  As
you would know if you did the same amount of research I have done into the
events of that evening and other events at VSF (too bad I cannot share
private e-mail, you would be shocked, rest assured).

>
>> Your thoughts are greatly appreciated.
>
>Sometimes I think, only when they are in agreement with yours...

Wrong again.  You often engage in tedious debate to no end.  I am looking
for answers, and that fact seems to be lost on you.  For one who doesn't
even like the concept of race, you have certainly brought it up more than
I, as if you're trying to prove that race is never a factor in real life.
I think that is your axe.  I merely stated that it was a facotr in my
ejection as it was for others.  Sorry you don;t buy it, but I'm not trying
to convince you.

You can disagree, but for what?  What are you disagreeing with, my
feelings?  My version of the story? What other side is there since the
other side has been very, very silent. Since you only have one side, mine,
and since you weren;t there, all one can ask is what actually happened.
Instead you have gone on about why I think there is a racial component and
I've already explained that to death.

I could care less if you agree or disagree, but this much is for certain:
There is something wrong with VSF security, and the scene is becoming aware
of it.  Mgmt. of VSF is aware of it, and I think they are taking some small
steps to curb the abuses, whatever they may be.

And *THAT* Adder is the point, that VSF security be brought in line with
reality and allow people to party.

THAT is the only issue here.  So if you want to have a racial discussion we
can continue, but that is not where my head is at with VSF at this point.

Funny, I cited in the original post my feelings and how I felt about the
whole thing.  You will recall that I also mentioned other problems of VSF
security, and other issues.  Race was my small piece of the pie
(signifigant from my emotional pov) but I mentioned other negative
behaviors.  Yours has been to focus on my race comment leaving out the
other infractions.  If anyone has an axe to grind it certainly seems to be
you and the race thing at this point.

Nuff said,
John

P.S.  VSF security is out of control.  Be careful when partying there and
excersize extreme caution.  No pipes, no weed, no passing, no problems.

(Adder, so where is the racial component you've been rattling on about?)

Adder if you're going to argue understand *what* you're arguing about.  My
point was not that I was sober, my point was I was in no worse a state than
any of the crackerjack, e-takers at that party. So it leaves suspect why I
was ejected?

I need no reason to back up my feelings.  That's why thier called feelings
Adder.  Emotion often defies logic.  I do however see a pattern of abuse w/
VSF security.  But you have all but ignored that data.

Been thinking about things I do using popularity as a motive.

    Went back & forth, is it good, is it bad?

    I decided it's okay, because popular means you have to deal with a lot
of people and that's definetly better than being hidden.

        You know what I'm sayin?

        So just for me (actually just for you if you think about):

        Do your best to be the most popular being.

        Humble people do not ravers make.

you must have checked out NASA then - all done up in 60's style space
station decor.  it used to be a dance club, but then the city
government banned western-style dancing (about a month before i
arrived on the scene hoping to put together an indian/american techno
group to play in the previously numerous dance clubs there - sheesh!)
so now (or then, anyway) it's just a bar with a bunch of old guys
sitting around drinking expensive beers.  although they still turn on
the fog machine/ lazer-light show every night from 8 to 8:15...

goa trance is made more or less exclusively by europeans on the party
scene in goa (a small state on the west coast), at least as far as i
know.  though i hear a big techno influence on some of the hindi film
soundtracks released since goa took off (like "rangeela" or the
soundtrack that "telephone wallah" is on - btw does anyone out there
know what film that song is from?)

i've got a couple of exellent bhangra albums from the "extra-hot"
series put out on the mulitone labels (#8&9, specifically).  though
they're kinda old so the rave influence has that '91 flava.  btw the
techno style of bhangra is mostly made by british kids of indian
descent...
there's a cool store in berkely (on university ave i think) that sells
all sorts of stuff like that (along with every hindifilm soundtrack
ever made), including some ug mixes by west coast indian dj's.  the
clerk there was totally cool and pointed me too some good cd's.

  I wasn't there, and I don't know what happened, but I do want to say
something, for what it's worth. When I lived in Chicago, I worked with a
lot of black folks and I hung out with a bunch too, and one thing I learnt
is this: young black American males have more stories about people
screwing them over for no explicitly stated reason than any other
demographic I know of. Every one of these guys had a story - usually
several stories. And here's the important part: race was NEVER mentioned. 
Not once. Maybe racists are ashamed of themselves. Maybe they're cowards. 
Maybe an entire ethnic group just happens to be cursed with consistently
bad luck and it's just this amazing coincidence. But race never gets
explicitly mentioned until after the story's been told and people are
talking about what happened. Then someone says, "And you know why..." and
everyone nods. That's about as explicit as it gets.
  This Stompy's thing could have taken place because of racial reasons; it
could have taken place because the security guy broke up with his
girlfriend and he wanted to take out his stress on somebody. I don't know.
But I do know that if it was racial, you just plain wouldn't hear
anything. No mention of race, no offhand remarks, and nothing to
substantiate any claim. You never do.

i've thought about this a lot lately, especially at the santacon gig. 
now before i step on any multiple-listed cacophanyclub people's toes,
i should state for the record that _almost_ all of santa's i met were
quite friendly, open, fun, and cool.  cool in the good way, that is. 
but then there's this other kind of cool.  the kind of cool where you
drop a lot of names and snub people who can't (or won't) do the same. 
or who don't dress right or didn't go to that hip party last weekend
or whatever.  not that i've never dropped names, or tried to be cool
or anything.  but generally i try to avoid that sort of game, and i
really really try hard not to snub people, no matter how they dress or
whether they know the same bands as me or whatever.  just strikes me
as mean.

>

after spending a lot of time living the slacker lifestyle (rock band
going nowhere, retail job in a store fulla freaks etc.) i noticed
that, while every culture, fringe or otherwise, has an element of self
hype, the gen x indie rock scene seemed to be composed almost
exclusively of these hipper-than-thou name dropper types.  so i came
up with this theory (perhaps after a bit of soul searching):  many
people who got out of school around the time of the '91 recession
found themselves in these crummy jobs, when all through college we
were expecting to graduate and get a big salary and drive beamers like
everyone else (well i never thought i'd drive a bmw but you know what
i mean).  deprived of the financial means to impress anyone, we found
other ways of letting the world know how cool we were.  "yeah, i was
hanging out at mac's house the other day..."  "oh i get in for free,
the doorman knows me"  "yeah we opened for [name of trendy band] last
week...  what's your number?"

i dunno, maybe i shouldn't criticize.  i probably still do it myself
sometimes.  and there were things i really liked about the gen x crowd
- hell, some of my best friends are slackers.  but one of the things i
like about raves is the way that people are so open and friendly.  i
just seem to feel a lot less of this "too-cool-for-you" vibe.  

-mw

ps. and of course that goes double for sfraves.

I need your advice about where the best places are in the bay area to 
buy good jungle,preferably in the east bay. I am much more interested in 
"underground" jungle beats than anything,so please keep that in mind 
when you recommend a store to me. Thank you very much,PLUR,stephanie.

Nikita Fri PM.....
I agree with Macadio that David Michael did an
*awesome* job of totally tearing the place up....
DJ Icey was good, but David Michael was WAY better...
and Scott DC is fast becoming one of my favorites-
first set of the night and he completely set the 
vibe and got the crowd movin'.....i was so impressed 
the first time I heard him spin and he hasn't let me
down since...HELLA nice guy, too...so friendly and happy!!
Jeno's set was *amazing*...late or not, he still sent me
to another universe, he is truly an artist~!!
AND mucho mucho props to the laser/lighting crew at 
1015...those guys are totally in sync with the music
and the visuals are often just as good as tunes, and 
sometimes even make up for a crappy song or two

What a night!! Great dancing, even the harder acidy stuff
I usually don't listen to got me movin and groovin...
fun fun fun  =))

luv n hugs,
natasha

 YES I aggree that show wasn't very good, they should just forget about
playing their new album and play what everyone wants to hear!j/k I also
thought the crowd was kind of weak, but - My opinion! Rammelstein tore it
up though! The wonderful fireworks and sparks got ME excited, didn't seem
to phase many others though. I don't really keep track of the names at
all....Raymond Watts is the turtablist? If he isn't whoever is kicks ass.
Yes, the best thing they played was at the very end.   

Don't you blow your top! Ooohhhh I only dream of seeing that tour...

Name : What, are you K1DDing?

What is your Age: 20

Birthday: Virgo, 1977

What is your Sign: Moon in Libra, rising in Scorpio

Are you Married:  no

Have Kids: hell no

Are you Single: not entirley, umm, well, he's tellin people we are together,
but, damn, I da know.

Do you Dj: the K1dd tries, but the train always hits the cow, no matter how
hard I slam on tha breaks 

What is your most listened to Style of Music? Jungle, skapunk, funk  

Musician / Artist: am I or who do I appreciate? I draw.  I create.  I write.
I appreciate others who can create as well.

Phattest lineup?  Breaking from tha norm, the dopest concert would be tha
beastie boys, rage against the machine and lucious jackson.

Hobbies: playin (what we play is the question: everything ;) wink wink)

Mission In Life: to live, love and teach others to love.  Teach others that no
matter how little self worth they believe they have, they are worth it and
they are loved.  Well, unless they aren't then I really don't give a f*ck
about them.  But those are the chronic liars, the backstabbing bitches and the
fuckhead playaz we all know and love anyway.  Even that isn't hate, or even
dislike, it's just indifference.  And which is worse. 

Do you represent the Scene Negatively or Positively? HA HA HA!!! negativley,
or positively, depends on my mood.

How? See, I have this _idea_ and this idea is that there are two types of
people who go to raves.  Candy ravers and those who rave.  Candy ravers annoy
me.  All that glitter and bright jewelry is just...  just... UGH!!  Those are
the type of people who feel the more people they love, the cooler they are,
right> you all know who I am talking about.  The kids fuct up on so much e
that night, every night you see them, 7 hits, okay, I am  exaggerating, but
you know what I mean.  Then there are those who rave.  Go for the music
(jungle jungle jungle). See a brotha or a sista and chillen kick it with the
one's they can really love.  And I love all my brotha's and sista's out there.

Do you go to parties to hear the music or hook up with the oposite sex? It's
all bout the music.  I do love to look, but I never hook.  It's tha funk,
yanno? I don't wanna be hookin with someone if I smell like funk and they do
to right? so fukkit, if we gonna hook it, it be not too ralated to one of
those RAVE thingies.

Ms. K1dd has left the building

-->Well, I don't think the majority of the legumes you consume are
"alive".  They might be viable, but seeds were meant to store energy for a
later date when the conditions are right for the embryo to start sprouting
and actually living.  Seeds are actually in stasis--just like the frozen
meat I eat; the difference is that one stasis is the pause before life and
the other is the pause before decay :)


...I read a great quote the other day from Naomi Campbell; she was one of
those supermodels that was a part of those PETA antifur campaigns and to
justify her turncoat behaviour she said, "...I eat meat, I wear leather, I
will wear fur...."  Isn't it funny that not only did someone think her
opinions as a walking mannequin have significance and deserve published
ink, but in publishing such a non-sequitur the mag. was undermining its
credibility as anything _but_ a secondary cosmetics peddler and all
articles that attempted to be the least intellectual were questionable?
I am sure all of Ms. Campbell's furs aren't made of cow only, and all of
her leather accessories aren't made solely of lamb, and I am sure she
doesn't regularly have mink served on her dinner plate either.  Don't
editors read these things anymore?

yeah but
striving to be popular means you care too damn much what other people
think about you
and while trying to please others to gain their acceptance..
are you really doing what you WANT to be doing for yourself?
*taking the individual path and finding more happiness there than a bunch
of acquaitances could ever give me*
and that's just me... misspelling of the acquaintances word and all

Ummm, here goes...

Name: Matt Schwartz

Age: 23

Sign: Scorpio, but because I really dont quite fit with any astrological 
sign I would much rather be recognized with my chinese zodiac sign which 
is the tiger.

Married: nope, was engaged once though

Kids: Not till I can afford em :-P

DJ: I guess so, I have my own equipment...my mixtape will be out soon!

Musician Artist: Let see...I've done theater all my life, majored in it 
for three years in college. I've directed over 20 plays throughout that 
time. I play the Trombone, the Drums, the Tuba, The baritone...I can 
also play the trumpet and piano from time to time, I also used to play 
the Bass guitar in my school's jazz band. I write poetry...*ssshhhhhh* 
you didnt hear me say that :-P and I'm extremely into sci-fi...fantasy 
worlds..D&D whatever...yeah I think I can say I'm somewhat of an 
artist...but all that stuff is just different hobbies.

Hobbies: All of the above ;-), Hockey, Pool, Reading, watching 
movies...dunno etc..


Favorite style of music: Hard and Harder Trance :-P, Really progressive 
breakbeat...like the sh*t David Micheal threw at nakita friday 
night...he WENT OFF!, basically...I like anything as long as it doesn't 
suck :-P

Mission in life: Wow, interesting, I think my "mission" in life would 
have to be always striving to live it to the fullest. Enjoy as much as I 
possibly can while I have it, and to make as many awsome friends as I 
can along the way. 

Pos/Neg on the scene: I'd hope that I'd have a positive effect, 
although, sometimes it's really difficult when I get caught up in all of 
the BS. A note to any of you who read this...just remember one 
thing...keep faithful to your friends!...that is what this scene is all 
about...dont go off in another direction just to try and get ahead in 
the rat race. Stick with the ones who love you because not all really 
do.

How do you represent the scene: does it really matter?

Do you go to parties to listen to music or pick up on people:
Well...plain and simple...I go to parties to have fun. Whether that 
means listening to my favorite DJ, dancing all night, hanging out with 
my friends, doing drugs, or even picking up on people really depends on 
the circumstances. But I have a problem with people who look down upon 
anyone who, at that time, just might be looking for another cool person 
to spend time with...I mean come on, I would seriously doubt that there 
is one single person here who wouldn't mind hooking up with another 
really cool, other single person at a party. I dunno...if it happens, it 
happens...I dont go looking for it...but yes...I do like it when it 
happens to me.

Favorite UG DJ's

Trance/breakbeat-Vertigo
Techno - Macadio
Jungle - This is really tough!...four way tie I'd have to say 
          with Meeks,Science,Siphon,and Hak

Favorite thing about the internet: MUD's

My Dear Boys,

I have no idea as to the basis or authenticity of the following message, but
since you are all college men, and ticklish as far as I recall, I thought I
might pass on to you this opportunity to make some extra cash.  (Of course,
one should never miss an opportunity to promote a little debauchery either! 
I've heard of this particular obsession before, but have never seen it
pursued in quite this manner.  Let us encourage this brazen, wealthy!!,
fetish fledgeling!)

>From a non dj's perspective.

The Playhouse release party was incredible.  Our tribe got there really
early, the commute from davis not being as bad as expected, and we chatted
it up out side before finally entering around 10:45.  The vibe was a bit
odd at first.  Everyone was just milling around checking the place out as
the tables were being set up.  We took up residence on the stairs and got
some drinks.  Almost 5 min later a security guard came up to one of my
friend and asked him what he was drinking (my friend did not have a lovely
little arm band.) when we told him it was water he told us that there were
undercover cops in the club that were looking for underage drinking and to
be careful.  The security kept an eye on us, we were a group of mixed ages
so we could always sneak drinks, but they were also very cool.  They
understood the intention of the party and were not going to be assholes.  
Hell, they even felt my pipe when they patted me down at the door and did
not say a word.  

Buck eventually started his set, and it got good fast.  Around 12, six
plain clothed 40ish looking people left the club together and the party
really got going.

The rest of the event was really a blur of lights, strobe vision and
uncontrollable dancing that was interrupted only once in awhile with an
omygodthisissoofuckinggooood!!!!.

I was too into my own trip to say hi to any sfravers there so a belated
hello from me. (I was the one going off in the red&white polo and white
jenkos, with pig tails).  And a thank you must go out to the security at
Big Heart for looking out for us.

Goa trance is not indian made or really inspired.  True it is a european
way of taking spirituallity into techno.  But there are indian raves that
are not just europeans, raves that the indian people themselves
participate in and create.  I have a tape of a full moon rave in goa from
96.  The rave had 15000 people attending and the music is anything but goa
trance.  It is a mixture of indian film music and synth beats with tablas,
sitars and bagpipes of all things.  It also has indian rapping and reggae.
If anyone wants a copy i can send or give it to you.  I must warn you
though that it is a bootleg so the quality is not that good(to saythe
least)

Despite the false advertising of goa trance, i do love it. not necessarily
because it is supposed to be spiritual or indian, but because it is
relentless and very noisy.  If you like acid lines and non stop music to
bring you into any trance state you may want to reach, goa can do that for
you.  Besides there are different types of goa, like anything else.  And
if you only listen to the GG style you are missing out on some very well
made techno.  TIP has produced some very well designed goa that well,
kicks ass!  Sorry to preach, just wanted to get my point across.

Don't go there,  I can only type so many words per minute.  Besides people
find what they are looking for in different things, some people cannot
stand house, and I think that trance is completely full of soul.  Hell I
had to leave a room once when mystr-E and mars were tag teaming because
the music was so overwhelming i thought I was going to cry!  Seriously!
(ps, it was an incredible feeling to hear music so beautiful that it moved
me that much)

Believe me people have been pissing off the goa locals for along time,
even before goa came to fruition.  I was one of them.

IF it sounded anything like the above or perhaps ta din nak a din etc. or
sporadic repetitions of Sa Re Ga Ma etc.  Then it is a pattern that will
articulate the beat they are going to play on the tablas or the melody
they are going to play on the harmonium.

Hey kids,

As of Feb. 1st I will be leaving to study abroad @ Brunel University (30 
mi
outside of London).  Before I go I want to know about the scene over there
and I wanted to get on there RAVE mailing list...but I don't know where to
look.  I tried some of the links from SFRaves, but I only got lost and no
one returned my e-mails I had sent after some of the sites.

So if you have any info. on how to get onto there mailing list it would be
much appreciated..


thanks

Hey rave nerds,

For those of you interested in our multimedia CD-ROM project, we

Or the poor lads who rely on a simple smile and an unassuming "Hi",
only to be scoffed at because the female thinks that the guy can't 
come up with anything better, when all he's trying to do is be
friendly and try and meet her.  Of course, the same woman would also
scoff at any sort of obvious pick-up line (ie. don't I know you . . .)
and would never dance next to someone/strike up a conversation/smile
and wave, because . . .  well, whatever reason it is that (many)
women don't do that sort of thing.

Here's a tip:  Guys LIKE it when women come up and strike up a
conversation.  And most guys don't assume that you're trying to
get them in the sack just because you say "Hi".

hey!  whatcha knockin my town for!  (well mine since i moved here 6

my cousin's wedding), but i lived in london, and i've spent quality

to sf cause it was the coolest, most open and friendly, beautiful,

And no one else has ever been ejected from VSF that wasn't black for

Odd, that isn't the impression I got from all of your other posts on the

Nice try. However I will not be misdirected in that fashion. The reasoning
that I find a shortcoming in was that your drinking was irrelevant to your
ejection because others around you were more intoxicated. The drinking of
others around you has *0* effect on *your* level of intoxication. Now, if
you were to say that "I was not acting drunk" (which I believe you
did) that's another matter. I am only taking issue with your statement
regarding your level of intoxication being irrelvent for the reason you
gave.

You asked me what it takes to prove to *me* a wrong has been done.
I never asked you to present both sides of the story.

I agree that the events require explanation. I just don't agree with
some of the reasoning behind your explanation for the events. I must ask
though, is it an explanation you want, or evidence to support the
conclusion(s) you seem to have reached?

Doubtful. Define "point." If I remember correctly I wasn't the one making
claims about VSF security being racist.

Absolutely not. However, you are labeling people racists in a public
forum. If you are going to make such accusations, you should be ready to
provide evidence that point to that conclusion. 

I don't know about you, but I abhor racism. I can't stand it, and have
little tolerance for it(in case you haven't noticed.) And because of the
gravity with which I view the subject, I make damn well sure that if I am
going to label someone such that I have proof to back it up. And my
standard for proof is much higher than "a feeling," or "because 3 other
people that belong to the same racial group I do have been ejected from a 
club."

Oh no, I will take you at your word. If they made any statements to that

In a real court, you would have no case.. I think your lawyer pointed that

This "banter" is about the use of flawed reasoning to reach a conclusion.
I think it also involves asking for an explanation of an event, but
already having reached your own.

How? I don't pay $25 to get into a party. I haven't since 1994. You are
addressing "ravers" and I am pointing out that all "ravers" do not
necessarily pay $25 to go to a party.

Further, barring front-door security, I haven't been to a party since
then that has felt the need to have indoor security. I imagine at this point 
in time I would feel very uncomfortable being at such an event.

As I have stated numerous times before, to point out the flaws in you
reasoning to reach a fairly grave conclusion.

You are seriously mistaken. I have no problem whatsoever with the concept
of race. What I do have a serious problem is the misuse of race as an
excuse or a weapon.

Really? From your original post:

" I am no longer puzzled.  VSF has a very serious problem with their
security, and their security has problems with people of color at raves."

and 

" Brothers and sisters be warned.  If you are a person of color at that
  club, be very careful of what you do and who you do it with.  Security
  is watching, and they've got a job to do! ;("

Seems a little more like some very strong allegations to me. 

> You can disagree, but for what?  What are you disagreeing with, my

I am disagreeing with the reasoning used in reaching the conclusions you
have. I am disagreeing with your off-handed labeling of people as
prejudiced without the evidence to back it up. And I question rather it is
an explanation you seek, or evidence to support the conclusion you have
already reached.

Unless you have something else to add to the information you have already
provided, I don't see the point.

Yes, and they sound like very valid issues.

See your above comments from your original post. 

I "left out" the other infractions because I *agree* with you insofar as
seemingly pointing towards a general problem with security. They aren't a
point of contention.

In your original post. And in every subsequent one up until the above last
line. 

At any rate, I'm done with this thread. So you can have the last word. I
know how happy that makes you. :-) I do hope(really) that you will let us
know what happens. People should be able to party without hassles....

Preach on, good sir!

Of the few women I've met since I moved here, the ones that called ME
first got MAJOR props in my book.  Major, major props.

In fact, I quite dig one of them now...;-)
I just hope she digs me back.

Sure. Well, actually I am going to take a liberty and change hydrogen bomb 
to plutonium. As horrible as it was, the bombing of Hirshomi and Nagasaki
avoided a prolonged war with the Japanese. A prolonged war with the
Japanese would have ultimately left the death count in the Pacific
arena much, much higher. 

The ability of a nation to defend itself is of the upmost importance in
preventing others from walking in.

Yowza!

Hey, could we change the topic name for this now? I'm having a hard time
keeping track of people's personal info submissions. I'm creating a
statistical reference for everyone to read eventually for fun...

(y'know - 35% of us are crack smokin', kid havin', thai food eatin', go to
raves to hook up w/ underground sex, fools.)

Oh yeah, I have a lot of time on my hands (very, very, sarcastic!),

-->Chill Messiah, I was just using irony since "world-class" was written
with quotes 'n'stuff. But I was disgruntled and wanted to do something to
celebrate post-finals bliss but, you know, didn't have a Guardian or
anything handy at midnight.  I _Love_ San Francisco and have decided that
this place is one of the few cities in the world that I can spend years
in. But there are some bad sides like: no alcohol after 2AM=no hangin'
around and being a barfly, driving and parking (I'm sorry, but I think
NoCal drivers are some of the worst; speaking from a SoCal perspective), 
trying to find a decent flat, n'stuff, but I wouldn't trade all of that in
for any other city--not yet anyways.

Happy, happy, sunny day :)

raverette #1 if I was an icecream cone what topping
would you be....:) hehehehehe

I definately like the forms that we have been posting
on the net.  I admit to being a consumate voyeur.  I
could very well be a Ferengi for the ears I have for
gossip.

And basically that is why I joined sfraves to join a
vitrual community and make connections.  

It is really fascinating and wonderful how the
internet has filled in some of the void in today's
world.  If you think about it today's society is so
volatile that there are few institutions like church,
family, location to enable people to form ties.
Take me for example.  I never went to church, and
while I do not miss the innoculation of religion, one
would have to admit that there is a definite support
group there.

Also, I picked up and left my hometown and most of my
friends back in May.  And yet I am able to remain as
close to my friends back home,at least spiritually,
as I would have if I had stayed there- and I am also
able to make new ones through news groups like this
one.

Someone suggested that we send pix with our profiles.
 I for one am glad that we have to resort to text to
communicate.  Its not even that I don't want people
to know what I look like.  It's just kinda more
intimate when you don't have to worry about outward
appearances- more like a mental hot tub.  Do you
think people would have said half the things on this
list if they had to actually verbalize them?

Gosh am I rambling? I'm not even drunk.  I guess I
have been feeling the warm fuzzies of joining a crazy
group of Santas for their wacky adventures, which for
me was as fulfilling as joining some cult, club, or
religion.

Your message got through...

I have to agree that it is hard to relate to people in person.
I'm a pretty shy person, I had a crush on a girl who would
never know it for about 4 years and the most I said to her
was, "what did you get on the test?"  My mind is a muse
but my mouth is concrete.  I may think some really great 
stuff but when it comes to verbalizing... Good Luck!!!!
Like the other night in Big Heart for BT...
I was sitting next to a grrrl who would make eye contact
and then look away...  I don't know what to say!!!  Then
some guy came by and sat down next to her and started
talking to her.  =(  I have no guts when it comes down to it.

I have met a few people from the list and have had a great 
time.  The list also provides a way to meet up with people
that have the same interests...  Sure sometimes I feel kinda
left out because some of you get more replies but I'm learnin!
But I am an open-minded person and can deal with stuff.  
I am happy to be on this list.  It keeps me informed and
entertained...  You guys are da bomb!!!

Your Jedi Bitch,
Jedi666Boy

well, while legumes are seeds and therefore possibly not "dead" per
se...

the thing that i disagree with "morality" based vegitarians about is: 
plants are alive.  i've always felt sure (though i'll never _know_)
that plants have no more desire to "die" than any other living being,
although they may not be able to express this to us humans.  i mean,
how would YOU feel if you were just sittin there soaking up the rays,
when something came along and cut off your feet, picked up what was
left, and stuffed you in it's mouth.

so how not to starve, if "vegetables are murder"?  well the hardcore
jainists (sp?), i believe, only eat fruit that's fallen from trees. 
or something like that.  personally, i figure every living organism,
with the exeption perhaps of some single celled planktons at the very
bottom of the food chain, kills other living things to survive.  hell,
even plants compete for sunlight, with the losers dying in the shade
of the larger, faster growing winners.  just the way nature works.

of course there's a good argument to be made against all the meat
factories, the way we grow cows and chickens like plants in some
horrible bovine ausvitch.  like if we took all the grain fed to the
cows grown for american consumption, we could feed the whole planet. 
but if you go with that argument, you could argue against farming
period.  i mean, look at the places where people have been farming the
longest - i'm thinking ancient persia, the "cradle of civilization",
now the middle east.  all barren desert now.  if i ruled the world, i
would prefer to see the population shrink, perhaps by imposing a
one-child-per couple limit like china does (a draconian but highly
neccesary law, imo) until we could let most of the planet revert back
to forest.

of course, if i ruled the world i'd also make it a law that you had to
go to a strip club dressed as santa claus at least once in your life...

MYASS

A great new software announcement!!! This memo is to
announce the development of a new software system....myass
We are currently building a data center that will contain
all firm data that is Year 2000 compliant.  The program is referred to as 
the
"Millennia Year Application Software System" (MYASS).
 Next Monday at 9:00 there will be a meeting in which I will
show MYASS to everyone.  We will continue to hold demonstrations throughout
the month so that all employees will have an opportunity to get a good look
at MYASS.
As for the status of the implementation of the program, I
have not addressed the networking aspects so currently only one person at a 
time can use MYASS.
This restriction will be removed after MYASS expands.

 Several people are using the program already and have come
to depend on it.
 Just this morning I walked into a subordinate's office and was
not surprised to find that he had his nose buried in MYASS.  I've noticed
that some of the less technical personnel are somewhat afraid of MYASS.
         Just last week, when asked to enter some information into
the program, I had a secretary say to me "I'm a little nervous, I've never  
put anything in MYASS before."  I volunteered to help her through her first 
time and when we were through she admitted that it was relatively painless 
and she was actually looking forward to doing it again. She went so far as 
to say that after using SAP and Oracle,  she was ready to kiss MYASS.

  I know there are concerns over the virus that was found in
MYASS upon initial installation, but I am pleased to say the virus has
been eliminated and we were able to save MYASS.   In the future, however,
protection will be required prior to entering MYASS.
        >
  We planned this database to encompass all information
associated with the business. So as you begin using the program, feel free 
to put anything you want into MYASS.  As MYASS grows larger, we envision a 
time when it will be commonplace to walk by an office and see a manager hand 
a paper to an employee and say "Here, stick this in MYASS."
          This program has already demonstrated great benefit to the
company during recent OSHA and EPA audits. After requesting certain
historical data the agency representatives were amazed at how quickly we 
provided the information.
 When asked how the numbers could be retrieved so rapidly our
 Environmental Manager proudly stated "Simple, I just pulled them out of
MYASS."

I have to agree that I support the one-child thing.  
Who really needs more than that?  

I also agree with you on vegetarians.  I don't 
have a problem with them.  But they can be just
as pushy as some Bible-thumping Christians! 
All my g-friends have been vegetarians.  This
leads to trouble if you can't deal well under pressure.
I don't consider myself in anyway, better or worse 
than anybody else.  What I lack in one respect, I
make up for in another... You know, the whole 
Yin-Yang balance deal.  For instance.  One of my
x-g-friends was vegetarian because of the whole
morality issue and because of Skinny Puppy.  
But she wore Doc Martens, a leather jacket and
ate eggs and drink milk.  She tried to make me
become a vegetarian.  But I can argue too well.
I am too logical and unrelenting.  That is my virgo
qualifications and I'm a good lover.  She said so!
Vegetarians taste better too.  That's all I seem to go 
out with!  I can be very convincing, if you know what
I mean!  =)  But anyway, back to my point.  
I'm not a carnivore and I am open to new foods.  
Why do I have to be vegetarian?  I can't cook meat 
dishes whatsoever.  When I cook, which is often,
I cook vegetarian.  I just do.  But I enjoy the dead
animal cuisine just as much.  Nature has a way of 
reclaiming what is hers if left to her own devices.  
Humans can never live with the earth in harmony 
enough for this to happen.  We are too greedy a
species.  

So...when are we going to gather and go to a strip 
club dressed as Santa?  I'm game!  Jedi Santa 
has a nice ring to it!  Anyone want to see MY
lightsaber?

Your Jedi Bitch,
Jedi666Boy

about the candy thing - I don't like it when people act fake/plastic
either or feel that they need to be that way.
However, I personally wear clothes that could be labeled as "candy raver".
Big pants with fabric inserts, glitter, glow-in-the-dark bracelets, fur,
fuzzy
hats, etc.
I almost never do drugs at parties (last time was 1/2 year ago) and actually
don't do them much at all.
I just like dressing brightly and glittery..i think it adds fun to the
world. Especially
up here in Seattle when it is continuously raining, gray and drab. I have
never
understood why people dress in darker colors when it turns to winter...I
dress
the same way when I am at work, school, or at a party (granted, i get some
strange
looks, but that's okay =)
so, just know that not all "candy-ravers" are 7 hit freaks.

Looks like I'm on the tail end of this thread...

Name (or Nickname)= dave (dj radon)

What is your Age= 23.

Birthday= January 10th, 1974

What is your Sign= Capricorn

Are you Married= nope, unless you count the time I was five years 
old, when I married myself to the girl down the street.

Have Kids=nope.

Are you Single= Yep.

Do you Dj = Yep... I started "djing" at KZSU as a freshman, where I did an 
indie rock radio show for a while. Then I discovered Jungle about 18 
months ago, got my turntables soon after, and then started doing 
underbrush (http://www-kzsu.stanford.edu/~radon/) 

What is your most listened to Style of Music?= hmmmm.... too hard to 
answer. Today, I've listened to Sunny Day Real Estate, a Bill Laswell 
compilation, De La Soul, Directions In Music, Journeyman's "national 
hijinx", Sonic Youth, and Alec Empire's "Generation Star Wars".

Musician / Artist= I'm trying to get into d'n'b production/hip hop 
production. (isn't everyone?), and am working on some computer 
animation stuff. I agree with all the people who've said, more or less, 
that life is an art and everybody's an artist.

Hobbies= movies, snoboarding, djing, reading, video games, 
dancing/partying, record collecting.

Mission In Life= hmmm.... this is a really hard one. Nothing 
specific, I guess. Maybe: "Do some beautiful/interesting stuff and 
have fun."

Do you go to parties to hear the music or hook up with the oposite
sex?= Seems like I don't go to parties very often anymore. When I did, 
it was mostly to dance. 

This _has_ been a really fun thread, but it's a little bit weird to 
autobiographize yourself into 200 words or less. It seems like I'm 
leaving all the important stuff out...

sfrave-on,

-radon

I am sure that is true. However, it makes it that much worse when you're
killing something which can actually vocalize its pain and suffering, so
we know 100% for sure that we are hurting something alive.

Hmm. By that rationale, we should go around killing and eating our younger
brothers, sisters, and anyone else we find vaguely irritating,
Jeffrey-Dahmer
style, because that is how nature works. =) the weak and young must die
out...survival of the species....etc....etc....

I like to think that humans can rise above that to some extent and are
capable of showing more compassion than an animalistic approach.....

Also, from a health-related standpoint, it actually is healthier for you
to eat vegetarian, because like you said, it is starting at the bottom of
the food
chain....

Did you know that the reason why meat and dairy products are listed in the
four food groups could definitely have something to do with the fact that
the National Dairy Association and Meat Farmers association are on the board
who decides them?  (i'm sure i got the specific names of their organizations
a bit off, but that's okay, because you know what i mean)

there was a quote i heard, i can't remember the author, but it goes
something
like this:

"the animals of this world are here for their own reasons. they were not
made
for humans to eat any more than women were made for men, or black people
for whites...."

It actually really is not  healthy to be eating  flesh - it is filled with
fat and other
unhealthy chemicals and increases your chances of heart attack and many
other diseases.....

However, we are brought up to believe that it is healthy, and in fact normal
to eat meat and milk......but if you think about it, it's really kind of
gross, I mean,
why would it be natural for us to drink cow's milk? It wasn't meant for
humans...

i mean, would it be natural for people to go around milking their pet cats
or dogs and then putting the milk on cereal? or killing them and then making
small, round burgers? eew! of course that sounds nasty, but milking a cow
isn't really that much more logical....

It's very easy to forget that something was once alive and feeling sun on
its back
when it's all packaged up in plastic wrap......doesn't even look real
anymore,
just looks like another product...

which is the reason i am vegetarian.......if meat was eaten once in a while,
as a special treat, or something, that would be all right...but it is a
staple food in the
american diet...animals are treated like they are "products"..there to be
used,
killed, and abused for our pleasures....i think that is wrong!

what if human babies had their fingernails and anything else sharp on their
body
ripped out with no anasthetic so they couldn't fight back and were stuffed
into small cages barely large enough to hold them, until they were grown to
adulthood and the females could have their breasts milked roughly at
intervals until the day they
could look forward to being killed and made into Big Macs......

i don't think it is human nature to hurt other living things!

and even if it was, we have the potential to rise above that.

>of course, if i ruled the world i'd also make it a law that you had to
>go to a strip club dressed as santa claus at least once in your life...

*grin* glad to change the subject, i am.....can you explain this santa
thing to me? i think i missed something...i saw your last post and am
still confused....

This is a mix of thoughts and feelings provoked by many of the recent 
SFR threads, but it does not directly relate to any of them.. sit 
back.. relax and enjoy the ride.

	So much of what we get out of life seems to be a direct result of 
how we relate to others.. and how they relate and react to us in 
return..
	We often get frustrated with those around us.. trying to understand 
where they are coming from.. trying to find some common ground but 
seeming to fail miserably so much of the time. How often have you 
heard phrases like: "Women are so confusing..." or "Men don't make 
any sense.." uttered by someone desperately trying to understand the 
opposite sex? Some people never even get that far.. they are so 
afraid of what they might find if they explore the infinite diversity 
of shapes and attitudes that people come in that they insulate 
themselves from all things different.. frantically trying to prove 
their dominance... hiding their fear behind a fa=E7ade strength. They 
lash out at those things the fear.. forgetting that that fear is not 
in the object they are attacking..it is inside them.
	The world is a different place to a young child.. everything is new. 
There is nothing quite like the first time we encounter something 
new... In fact, this is the only time that we really see it for what 
it is. We have no name for it.. no label, if you will. What is it? 
what is its purpose? We have so many questions. Later, after we have 
learned its name.. we lose a part of what it is.. all we see now is 
the name and not what is behind it. An example:
	Everyone close you eyes and picture a flower in your mind.. go into 
as much or as little detail as you like.. Right now.. all 480 or so 
list members are each picturing what a flower is in their mind... and 
I can guarantee you that they are all different.. we each have a 
different experience of what a flower is, and that experience shapes 
how we see a flower. Luckily a flower is a physical object.. we can 
all go pick one out of the garden.. and pretty much agree on whether 
it is a flower or not. All things are not, however, so clear... when 
we are dealing with abstractions like 'Love' or 'Hate' or 'Good', we 
have no physical object to base our view of what it is on. You can't 
go down to the store and pick up a pound of Love on sale for $3.98 a 
pound. and if everyone on the list had a different view of what a 
flower is.. think how radically different our views are on what 
'Love' is.  
	... Getting back to the label thing now... another example with the 
flower again:
	If someone says "I got some flowers.." What does this tell you 
about what they got? I don't just mean whether they got roses or 
daisies either.. these are also just labels. How many petals did they 
have? What colors were they? What did they smell like? How did they 
make you feel? When you attach a label to something some of the 
detail.. some of what is important is lost.

	There is always a fear, an uncertainty, inside us. It is very easy 
to look at the world and see all the ways that we have been wronged 
by it. It seems we always have to look out for people who seem to be 
unfairly judging us.. attaching their labels to us, and not really 
seeing who we are. We do it ourselves.. it is almost as though we 
can't help it. We learn by associating new things we encounter 
with those we already know. Besides.. Who has the time to get to know 
each and every person anyhow? 
	The thing that we forget though, is that despite our infinite 
diversity, there are common threads of humanity running through each 
of us. Just as we are afraid of being judged by others, they too are 
afraid of us judging them.. the distance between us grows as little 
by little we build walls of security around ourselves because we are 
so sure that they are going to attack us...In reality they are 
waiting just as desperately as we are for someone to fill the gap 
between us. It is not judgment you see in the eyes of those around 
you, it is need.. a need to be noticed and cared about.
	People want to be able to tell their stories.. One time an older man 
very drunk..  and still drinking came up to me at abut 3am while I was 
waiting for MUNI at a bus stop.. he was singing a bit.. and I joined 
him in a few lines of "Las Mananitas" (it's amazing what you can 
learn in High School spanish classes ;-)). And while waiting for the 
bus, which was late as usual, and didn't end up showing up for a 
couple of hours we talked. He told me about Mexico and how living 
there affected him.. and made him who he was today... we started 
discussing politics.. and I learned a thing or two about why the 
mexican people do not have the voice that they should... I could have 
reacted very differently to this strange drunk mexican coming up to 
me at three in the morning and I would have missed out on all that he 
had to offer. When the bus finally did come, he thanked me for 
staying to talk with him... but there was no need. The pleasure had 
been all mine.

Why? Because our limited consciousness cannot hear the screams of those
poor, defensless plants, it is somehow not as bad to rip 'em out of the
ground and eat their soft and delicious innards?

Hey, they would eat you. Ever seen an angry cow? Man-eaters if I've seen

I don't quite know where I would hook up the milker do-dad. Any
suggestions?

So why aren't you a vegan? You should be ashamed of yourself. You
don't eat meat but think it is ok to use products that were produced by
the enslavement of animals? Tsk. Tsk.

Last time I checked cows weren't human babies. And I have yet to see the
McBaby Burger on the menu. Is there something I should know?

*LOL* Now that statement is just plain funny.

And thus, the superiority complex makes its self evident.

	I have read a few posts regarding militant vegetarians =P and 
although I do admit to being a veggie, it's not like you have to be 
a meat-hating activist to be a vegetarian.  I have lots of friends who
eat meat -- hell, my whole *family* is basically a group of carnivores,
but that's their choice, so what's the big deal here? I can understand
those peeps who don't eat meat for political or animal-rights reasons
or whatever and I totally understand and support their cause, but for 
me personally, I try not to judge others based on what they eat and 
why.  I eat fish and dairy but no poultry or red meat, so i suppose I
am a "vegetarian by design"....personally, it seems unfair for someone
to impose their beliefs upon someone else ...especially when it comes
to lifestyle choices...

Just my 2 cents  =P 

Happy Holidays all...

luv n hugs,

actually, very few animals will kill other members of it's own
species.  two lions fighting over territory won't actually fight to
the death, often their's some ritualistic instinctual "goal" - when
one animal pins down the other, or whatever (one species of snake
fights till the loser touches the ground with it's head - the film
footage of the "fight" was a trip) the loser slinks off, beaten but
alive.  man, as i understand it, is one of the few higher order
animals to kill it's own species.  we are particularly vicious
animals...

> which is the reason i am vegetarian.......if meat was eaten once in
a while,
> as a special treat, or something, that would be all right...

here's my idea:  in metropolitan areas, you have a species of deer
which wanders around the city, eating food from special deer-feeders. 
make it an attractive, housetrainable species that can run _almost_ as
fast as a human.  if you want to eat meat that day, you have to find,
run down, and kill with your bare hands one of these deer.  i think
this would not only be healthier for us humans (you have to exercise
to eat meat), but also nicer to the animals, and just generally more
"natural"...

I wasn't making reference to the non-militant vegetarians.
i was referring to the militant vegetarians...  A lot of my friends
are vegetarian and I have absolutely no problem with it.  I eat
vegetarian quite often myself.  I empathise with them but
don't share the same resolve.  I like a little meat every once in
a while.  I don't mean to offend anyone.  I am a selective eater.
I don't eat fast food meat.  It's scary!  Especially McD's!!!  

Please don't get me wrong, I love animals and am not defending 
the meat industry in any way.  

I prefer to eat vegetarian most of the time.  I eat at White Lotus 
every once in a while.  Eat a lot at fresh choice and Thai and
Indian cuisines...  Even at meat-serving restaurants I usually
eat vegetarian.  Especially at Italian restaurants...  I love 
cheese and bread!!!  I love to sit under the stars on a blanket 
and eat a warm loaf of sourdough bread and some cheese 
and a cool bottle of Henry Weinhard's Root Beer.  Anyone want 
to join me?  J/K!!!  I have the best of both worlds when it comes
to food.  I love both roadkill cafe' and rabbit delight.  

So to make a long story short... I love vegetarians...They just
don't always love me.

Another questionaire to learn about each other and 
to help create better partys and to celebrate solstice.

What are the things you liked about partys this year?

What are the things you experienced that you liked 
and would like to see more of?

What were your favorite/worst partys and why?

What are the things you didnt like and woukd like to see 
less of or not at all.

If you could have anything you wanted at a party, what would it be?

What do you want to create in the community, at partys
or just in general this coming year?

What would you like to give to the community this year?



Ps. there is a ritual where you sit in a dark room or out in nature
and reflect on the past year and think about those things you 
no longer need and get rid of them. Then light a red candle
 to welcome back the light and think about the things you want in the
coming year.  Then you have a big feast and party til dawn.
And if you are the kind that believe that the sound
of rules breaking
is sweet music to the ears, then you can party past dawn.

Interesting to see people getting steamed about vegatables.

According to Webster: vegitarian
 "A person whose diet includes mainly plant and plant
products and who eats no meat." 
It possible that eating only plants would
tend to make one vegetative. 
Vegetating is defined as:   
 To sprout or grow as a plant does. 

Possibly 
a vegetarian is someone who 
eats only plant products 
who sprouts all kinds of ideas,
 which may be rooted in reality (or not). 
Vegetarians may have
 unlimited growth (plantlike), 
think like a tree, 
have green blood, 
 hair that turns red or gold, or brown 
which falls out at the
autumnal equinox.  
Horses and cows are vegetarians:
They are tremendously strong, 
have beautiful eyes, 
never start wars 
but certainly get killed in them.  
One wants to stay out of their way, 
as when startled they can trample one.
  They don't know about stars,
But stars are named
for them.

I wonder who was the first guy that walked up to a cow
and grabbed her utters and said hey im thirsty i think
i will drink what ever come out when i squeeze her.

I am a vegitarian because it feels good and tastes great.
I have discovered so many great tasting foods since i 
expanded my diet beyond big macs and fries as a meal.
And my doctors are always amazed at how i am not a real
active person and yet i have the readings of a top athlete,
sometimes better. 

But i believe that there are more impoertant issues than
what one eats. Diet obviously affects our health and america
does have a health problem and people clogging our medical
and economic and enviormental systems due to unhealthy eating
and overeating need to be held responsible in the same way as any
other addict.

And one final thought is that i think what goes into your 
mouth is not nearly as important as what comes out of it.

you sure like to debate don't you. *grin* here is my reply.

before i begin i think it is important to note this part:

>      A happy "WRONG" person,
>
> Black Adder
>
I said quote "I think this is wrong." As in, for me, personally, this
is wrong. Not as in, Everyone else should be the same as me.
Or, those who do not think the same as me are wrong. I don't
attempt to pass judgment on others, and I would hope they would
be nonjudgmental of me in return. =)

>Hey, that rhymes!

not really....the beats are a bit off

<kim's attempt at mc'ing begins>

I ain't trying to preach, just trying to express
the vibe that i feel and the thoughts that i possess
most people don't share it, but that doesn't make it dumb
i can only speak from where i'm coming from
in my world there would be a global nation
of friendly faces, a love vibration
we all are different with our own way to be
i'm not saying yours is better or worse than me
but my personal belief is that we should give
the freedom to others to "live and let live"
and since it is not necessary to eat meat to survive
i think we should try to leave the animals alive!

my problem is not even just with the eating of meats
but by the way our society as a whole treats
living things as products, 
thinking it is funny,
to use and abuse creatures in order to make money.

When I turn on tv and see people objectified
Stereotypes flaunted and consumerist pride
I see a nation based around bucks
Happy to take advantage of another's bad luck.

If meat was treated like a living soul,
rather than a way for us to take control
over something smaller, that has no choice
no way to fight back, no human voice

if we treated it like it was a living thing
rather than an object with money to bring
then i would not think that it was wrong
but many don't respect that, hence my silly song.

It goes beyond right/wrong morality,
but using lives for money just bothers me.

please don't take my replies personally,
and live your life however you feel free....
just explaining why i am the way i like to be.

going into Darwinism here.. or are you saying there are actually more than
half of the human race who can catch a deer?

they aren't slow, and i know i would have a tough time catching one... and
i am  in pretty darn good shape.  what about shorter humans... plumper...
older...

funny how so many other  species have done well in this manner... and many
are quite majestic and beautiful compared to us oddly shaped humans.

i suppose what i am trying to say is... where will the feeders be? out in
front of MacDonalds?

Pervert! 





(just kidding)

I love this "I wish we could get the other sex to understand" bit... you
get some pretty damn cool insights spending time with bi, gay and lesbian
folk, as you'll realize it's not "men are screy" or "women are screwy"...
it's more along the lines of... love and compansionship are hard to find
(or "people as a whole are screwy", but I'm trying to stay positive
today).

In this world, we can have a thousand jobs, we can be a thousand ways,
have a thousand hobbies, make love/make whoopee/boink/rut a thousand ways,
have a thousand favorite foods, and see the world through a thousand
different eyes from a thousand backgrounds... 

And we will generally only find a couple of those combinations attractive
in others.

A guy named Matt Johnson once said, "if you can't change yourself then,
change the world."  Ask yourself just how fair that is... perhaps those of
us who are shy have a lesson to learn (I'm one by the way... get me away
from a terminal, and I'm a quirky, lanky, ackward kid who never really
figured out social graces, or how to brush his hair so that it does
something cohesive, or dance "right", and have to go to the bathroom
really bad/get faint/run around the block a couple times before every time
I spin in front of people)...

We need to take back living, rather than spectating.

Sometimes things are handed to you, and sometimes you need to take the
risks and hand yourself to someone or something else.  Ask yourself what
you want... and be honest about it.  Be honest about how you could tell if
somebody else was looking for those things.

If what you really want is a person to walk up and start a conversation
with you, than prepare to spend a lot of time hanging out, because it's
rare... and keep in mind you're asking someone you haven't even met yet to
do something you're not willing to do.  How fair is that? 

Peace.
Andy

Hey now.. Since when is Fat an "unhealthy chemical"????
People seem to get brainwashed by all the 'Fat Free' advertising that 
is out there.. While it is true that it is unhealthy to have too much 
fat, it is a normal and necessary part of our bodies.. That is the 
method that our bodies use to store energy away for later use.

Hey now.. Since when is it not normal for humans to drink milk?
Last I checked.. the Female members of our species produces it 
naturally in order to nourish our young.. Should we slap a label on 
every womans breast saying "WARNING: it is unhealthful to drink milk 
from here!!??"

Hey now.. Last I checked plenty of people aren't to worried about 
killing other people.. much less animals etc.. And what is "Human 
Nature" anyway? I'm having a hard time coming up with a definition 
for it.  

>

Very True :).. It is this potential that makes life interesting.. Now 
we just have to encourage everyone to do their best to  live up to 
that potential.

Yea.. But...

 Alot of people just "ACT" all happy and joyfull at ravEs. That's all good
n'all, even to act is not bad...Someone has to boost moral from time to
time..
 But if I was to have had a really, really bad childhood or something.. And
if I so happen to come off alittle less gay and care-free as most
ravers...Does that make me a bad person? Or NOT a ravEr?
 I am 25... When I was 19, all I could think about was getting laid and
taking drugs. Let's say that, maybe while I was growing up in this life
stile.. I encountered ALOT of problems with girls, myself, and my
perceptions..
 These problems from my past make me a more shy and quiet person today..
Should I not goto ravEs if I am going to have trouble communicating with a
large scale social croud?

 I always thought ravEs were cool because everyone got along. I haven't
been to school in a long time, so I don't know how things go there anymore.
But back when I was in high school...It was alot like being at a ravE...
All differences were set aside in class..You can't go spouting off your
narrow opinions and starting fights in class right? You need to just except
that the people around you are there too. That's how it seemed (at 1st) at
the ravEs. Everyone just got along and excepted one another...And I guess
you can say the music is the autority of it all. It keeps everone in line..
 But it turned out to be more like high school than I first assumed. People
hang in packs, people talk trash about other packs, and they outcast people
still. That is not right. The happy joyfull ravers full of love..sometimes
streight up HATE the more cut edge crouds.
 It's still a freaked out social mess.. If it weren't for the music. People
would be at each others throats.


This might sound negetive to you, but I assure you it is coming from the
most positive person you will ever talk to.
 I guess you can say the ravE scene broke my heart in a way. And it's all
because of people that think "EVERYONE" in this case "ravers" are all the
same.. If you go around thinking ALL ravers are happy and LOUD.. Your going
to be disapointed when you see me! And who gets hurt? Not you....You just
brush me off your back as if I am a flook in your party, and I get to
consume all your negitive feelings towards me, without you even knowing
what you did.

Does this make any sence to you?
Ok.. I got to get crackin though! Nice chatting.

Ahhh shucks, gotta share my thoughts about this one.


I grew up vegan.  Yup, no cheese, no milk, no eggs, no flesh for food
or clothing.  Don't feel like I missed out on anything really, but
then again my parents were really cool about letting all of us (Myself
and four brothers) decide what we ate.  They didn't freak out if one
of them decided to have bacon and eggs one morning, we just knew we
had to cook them ourselves.  It's all about your own PERSONAL choices
my little kittens!


I moved to Italy 2 months after I graduated from high school. My God,
how could a good little Vegan girl resist such cheesy temptation?  I
gave in, I became a cheese whore I admit it.  My parents don't hold it
against me at all. I'm still welcomed into the house, and I even think
they got me the kick ass Bastard board I've been begging for X-Mas. 
If I were to unwrap that beautiful gift while munching on a chicken
liver sanmich, they'd still love me, they just wouldnt' kiss me.


I personally would have no ethical problem drinking milk or eating
cheese produced by a small dairy where they treat their animals in a
humane way.  Unfortunately that doesnt' bring in the big bucks....

Hell, if I had a bigger backyard I'd have my own dairy cow named Gerta
and milk her myself, then we could have a butter churning party at my
house!


I Love Moo All!

Tabitha

Well.. The day they can store information simply by altering the course of
one single light element..Anything is possible. =]:..

 If you go into Guitar Center and ask for a couple technics turntables..
The people that work there will more than likely cast you as being..A
cheater, a no talent, and an annoying waist to the music community.
 I suppose if what you say happens.....Dj's will probably look at these new
artists in the same way.

 Just a thought..
There are already beat matching machines though I think. Cheaters! Oh..

Jeff you make puercfect sense!
i've always hated trying to spell when my email system is lagging and ic
ant see what i type./
;)

anyway, back to the comments Jeff had.. he's right..
the scene breoke myheart too..
i've seen soooooooo many  kidz.. trying to be the perfect raver..
striving sooo hard...
to know the right people (djs., promoters)
know the right tracks.
act the right way
dress the right way
PLUR fuzzy smiles and happiness with a loud beat and non-stop perfect
happy vibes with a 100% kind positrive soul

that they forget...
to be real...
and that irks the living shit out of me.

but then, there are an incredible amount of individuals out there that
make the scene dear to my heart..
people who aren't afraid to shout their differing opinion into the crowd
of sheep..
people who dance, act, look, breathe, etc... the way they want, no matter
what.

so i hate the scene
and i love the scene

ahh relationships are a bitch, aren't they?
but life would be so boring without the roller coaster ride they provide
for us.
xo n respect :)

some UK company makes a product (red-somethingorother) which takes a
sound input w/ beats and generates MIDI clock from it. one could use
this to sync up a beatbox/groovesynth (e.g. Roland MC303) to a
live-playing LP or CD and keep your synthesized beats in sync w/ the
live stuff.

i could also imagine getting two of these redsomethingorothers to
listen to the output of two 1200's (or CD players) and feed a circuit
which generates a difference voltage based on the phase difference of
the two midi-clocks output by the two redsmothingorother boxes. this
difference could then feed another circuit to simulate electrically
(e.g. via an FET txistor) the output of the pitch potentiometer on your
turntable/cd-deck. The circuits would self-correct the pitch for a
matched BPM between decks. Basically, a phase-locked loop for BPM 
matching.

I'd imagine that just as with any phase-locked-loop circuit, it would
be somewhat suceptible to transients, and might produce some annoying
pitch changes and oscillating overshoot/undershoot of pitch between
the matcher and the matchee...

Also, the reality is that BPM counters don't always work very well... 
especially for interesting/realworld/funky music. Ultimately you need a
human brain to understand it. Of course, w/ some particulary metronomic
gabber, house, or trance, all you need is a tweaker to understand it,
and we all know tweakers have no brains.

UNIVERSAL HUMAN SOCIAL LAW: For every "bitch" there is an equal and
opposite "bastard" ... they create each other, destroy each other and
and deserve each other. The sad part is when innocents get caught up in
the cycle and are themselves transformed into one or the other by the
process.

COROLLARY: apply above dialectic to humanity and you get the full range
of male/female/relationship problems you see today. 

INTERPRETATION: Fingerpointing don't help, and this "male bad" ideology
that our culture and law has acquired (and which is exemplified by the
post i'm responding to) *IS* the problem, not the solution. The worst
is the self-hating males that take this "male bad" sentiment to heart
and end up foregoing any chance of promoting positive maleness. He
tells  other males striving for evolution -- "forget it, you've got
balls, you're fucked" ... then, usually lists a panoply of past/present
"crimes of maleness" that can only be paid for by centuries of
self-flagellation, and denigration. But I don't think we need that kind
of solution... hell, if you want to simply feel bad about being human,
swallow-a-bunch of bullshit lies and half truths about human nature and
reality, while not doing diddly to introspect, evolve and strive and
make-better... hell that's what Christianity is for.

(hey, i've got a nice open can of worms here... anybody want some? Yummm!)

That may be, but...  
Male lions eat unprotected cubs fairly often, seemingly without reason.  Sometimes they even eat their own offspring.  Big cats will also do their best to kill other kinds of cats that stray into their territory.   Adult Lions know better than to fight each other to the death, the winner would be injured to the point of being helpless....   

Rattle Snakes don't kill Rattle Snakes, Garter Snakes don't kill Garter Snakes, but certain snakes feed almost exclusive on... other snakes.  Some Apes and monkeys kill and eat each other as well.  Animals may not kill members of their own race, but they sure as hell don't pass up the opportunity to kill creatures only slightly different.  

One of the laws of nature is that you don't really want to get into a life and death struggle with someone who's an even match.  The reason being that, while the looser may become breakfast, the winner will likely die of his wounds later...

Interesting contrast... Most crime in our society is INTRA-racial.  White on white, black on black.

I see your logic, but... Is genetically hobbling a species any better than farm raising cows?  In a bare handed cage match of Deer vs. Man, the deer wins hooves down.  Deer do kill impatient hunters who don't wait for them to die before running over to gloat over their trophy.  You'd have to make one weak ass deer to be able to catch and kill it, bare handed.   Granted, I have serious issues with hunting large mammals for sport but, if you were a deer, would you rather be ripped apart by some hungry, slobbering hominid, of killed by a single shot to the head? (Nether, obviously)

Is it lunch time yet?

There's also an article in this week's Guardian about on-line

This isn't a post to bring all of your spirits down, although it hasn't 
done much for mine. It's a plea to be safe. This weekend, a wonderful 
friend of mine (and many others) was killed. He and his wife were at a 
party up in Napa and he had been drinking. He wanted to drive, but his 
wife, thinking she was doing the right thing, wouldn't let him. They 
fought, and he got angry and took off running. They figured they'd let 
him sober up and calm down. 3 hours later they went looking for him and 
found him on the side of the road, dead. He had been run down by someone 
and left there. Please please please... just because you may not be 
driving drunk, others are. Be rational in the decisions you make and 
know that others that may try to stop you are just being the best 
friends they can. My friends and I are so deeply saddened by this and 
our lives will never be the same. Neither will his beautiful wife's.
He was only 22.

after an exellent indian meal w/ leslie, hai-la, maya, gary, and sara,
(hi y'all) we headed to liquid for booze and sTaTiC.  arrived at maybe
10:30 or so, i've never been to liquid that early before.  hung with
the gang for a while, but they all pooped out by midnite.  i was glad
i stayed, though, right around that time a trumpet player plugged into
the board and started blowin.  the mix was kind of rough, and there
were some patches where it sounded a little off, but there's really
sumthin about live improvization that adds a super cool energy to a
set.  there were some real moments of stellar beauty across the night
- strange loops of trumpet tones rising and falling over bleeps and
bloops, a great jungle duet between live and vynil horns, some
haunting techstep with brass whalesounds...

i was lost in the moment...  but it made me sad at the same time...  i
was gonna make a demo of myself playing trumpet through my effects box
over beats and give it to these very same dj's this summer, but never
did...  sometimes i think maybe i should lay off the clubs a little,
spend more time making music...  but then, i wouldn't have been
reminded of my intentions if i hadn't gone clubbing last night... 
hmmmm...

The trumpet player was an unexpected treat.  I didn't even know he was
going to be there.  I assumed he was just a local musician who dropped in.
As it turns out, his name is Graham Haynes and he is a very well known and
respected jazz musician from NYC signed to Polygram records.  He is also
the son of legendary jazz drummer Roy Haynes.  He actually has quite a few
albums out and is currently working on some projects which fuse live jazz
with drum and bass.  Being the techno snob that I am, I usually can't stand
live musicians over electronic beats, but I thought he was absolutely
amazing last night...  

Starting in January after our one year anniversary, we are going to try our
best to have at least one live performance or one dj from out of town every
month.  '98 should be a good year for Static...

here's a related poem I'm sure many of you have read.

DEATH OF AN INNOCENT

  I went to a party, Mom, I remembered what you said.
  You told me not to drink, Mom, so I drank soda instead.
  I really felt proud inside, Mom, the way you said I would.
  I didn't drink and drive, Mom, even though the others said I should.
  I know I did the right thing, Mom, I know you are always right.
  Now the party is finally ending, Mom, as everyone is driving out of
  sight.

  As I got into my car, Mom, I knew I'd get home in one piece.
  Because of the way you raised me, so responsible and sweet.
  I started to drive away, Mom, but as I pulled out into the road, the
  other car didn't see me, Mom, and hit me like a load.
  As I lay there on the pavement, Mom, I hear the policeman say,
  the other guy is drunk, Mom, and now I'm the one who will pay.
  I'm lying here dying, Mom.  I wish you'd get here soon.

  How could this happen to me, Mom?  My life just burst like a balloon.
  There is blood all around me, Mom, and most of it is mine.
  I hear the medic say, Mom, I'll die in a short time.
  I just wanted to tell you, Mom, I swear I didn't drink.
  It was the others, Mom.  The others didn't think.
  He was probably at the same party as I.
  The only difference is, he drank and I will die.

  Why do people drink, Mom?  It can ruin your whole life.
  I'm feeling sharp pains now.  Pains just like a knife.
  The guy who hit me is walking, Mom, and I don't think it's fair.
  I'm lying here dying and all he can do is stare.

  Tell my brother not to cry, Mom.  Tell Daddy to be brave.
  And when I go to heaven, Mom, put "Daddy's Girl" on my grave
  Someone should have told him, Mom, not to drink and drive.
  If only they had told him, Mom, I would still be alive.

  My breath is getting shorter, Mom.  I'm becoming very scared.
  Please don't cry for me, Mom.  When I needed you, you were always
  there.
  I have one last question, Mom, before I say good bye.
  I didn't drink and drive, so why am I the one to die?

It would not be very hard to do this with CD mixers... you could standardize
a CD-DJ format that would store tempo and beginning-of-phrase data in with
the music... maybe even data on what key the track is in (to automatically 
sync up the pitch)  This would not be the end of DJs... it would be the 
beginning of a new type of musician.  With this kind of technology, CD's could
become more minimalistic... and the "dj" could create complete tracks
on the fly from very small bits of musical data.  The DJ could make their own
peices of tracks and trade them on the Internet with other DJ's bits.  A live
set could consist of mixing your own peices, and peices from other dj from
around the world.  Oh, the future will be fun.

Hey, thanks for the Beta Lounge plugs, everyone... just wanted to let you
all know that the Beta Lounge is VERY SOON now going to be completely
independent of HotWired. Sometime in January you will no longer be able to
get to the Beta Lounge through HotWired - you'll have to go to the main URL
at <http://www.betalounge.com/>. Bookmark that one! Because that's where
we'll be at. Look for a new design, and more live music in '98. Also, all
of the DJs who have played at the beta lounge since July of 97 can be
accessed through the pull-down menu at http://www.betalounge.com/live.html
- this will be fixed in the new design, all of the archives will be
accessable from one location.

By the way, for those folks who missed Graham Haynes on cornet at Static
last night, you can listen to his set from last Thursday at the Beta Lounge.

Go to:  http://www.betalounge.com/live.html .

He played live over a great jungle set from Beta Lounge resident DJ Sifu.

Without singling someone out (which is I guess unavoidable in this case)
.... I would like to remind the folks on here that this is a list of more
than 450 people, all with different tastes, experiences and interests..

what we have in common is our love of raving.....  but beyond that, one
should expect that these many strangers are going to appreciate one's
secret quirks.

to me, a post like this is not appropriate in this forum.  there are young
teenagers on here, there are people of different religions and all sorts of
lifestyles....

sexually graphic materials may be welcome and/or appropriate on other lists
and in other situations....

however, i would like to request that -- cute, funny, satirical or whatever
-- we do not post blatantly sexual material on this list... particularly
when it has nothing whatsoever to do with raving, and most particularly
when the material is as controversial as b&d and fetish oriented.

perhaps this is an instance where a list of one's personal friends would
have been the appropriate mailing address to use, rather than sending this
to a list that includes a few friends and many many strangers.

please, folks, whenever you're tempted to post what is clearly bound to
offend certain people, think twice and treat us with as much respect in the
cyber world as you would in the real world.

love,

leslie

oh boy, another questionaire!  i gotta make up one of these things
myself one of these days...



> What are the things you liked about partys this year?

open skies, fog flowing in, the sound of the surf with distant beats
rolling underneath...  lazers caressing green leaves a mile away... 
the boundless youthful energy of the kids surrounding me seeping into
my old bones, making me dance like i was eighteen again...  friendly,
open vibes, smiles from strangers...  kisses from girls i'd never met
before and never saw again...  oddly coherant conversations with
strangers around the dimming campfire...

> 
> What are the things you experienced that you liked 
> and would like to see more of?

shadow couples projected onto white sheets grooving grinding kissing
fucking...  bodies covered in dayglo fingerpaint and nothing else as
the 303 goes mad...  fire, art, explosions...  good, clean san
francisco ecstacy...  that green dreadlocked girl i was flirting with
by sunrise on the dunes above happy kids...

> 
> What were your favorite/worst partys and why?

favorite:  happy kids beach party - sand, vibes, sand in my shoes,
sand on the dancefloor, pretty girls, vibes, jungledawn, vibes, fog,
lights, vibes, vibes, happy kids...

worst:  happy kids halloween - spent weeks putting together the best
messiah wannabe costume ever!  bought tickets for myself and all my
friends too!  lonely but lookin sharp!  high but comepletely lucid! 
got stuck on the castro and missed the map point, never found the
party...

> What are the things you didnt like and woukd like to see 
> less of or not at all.

sfpd.
 
> If you could have anything you wanted at a party, what would it be?

an orgy.

> What do you want to create in the community, at partys
> or just in general this coming year?

exitement, shock, disbelief... free feasts... guerilla art
happenings... diy sculpture in the middle of the dance floor...

> What would you like to give to the community this year?

a new religion...

unfortunately that is grounds for termination for
anyone who works here.
My private fantasy is to send a surwatch preferences
like a virus to all computers with surfwatch where
the keyword would be www, http, or something like
that which would completely disable the browser thus
illustrating the potential for abuse from this
cra-ppy ill thought out piece of software.  

I mean come on guys it is one thing to stop porn from
coming over the net but the software is ruining all
communication public and private.

pjf standing on his soapbox again.

I like this one :o)

 What are the things you liked about partys this year?
--This year i think i found another side of partys than what i had been seeing
before, i had the oppertunity to go by myself and meet people i would have
never met being with my friends, also this year, a lot more than previous,
Jungle has been everywhere *YAY*
 
 What are the things you experienced that you liked 
 and would like to see more of?
 --I saw more of seperation this year between UGs and massives, the types of
people and their reason for going seemed to put them in the right place...I
saw more DJs which is always nice, i saw smiles and all the good things that
keep me coming back :o)
 
What were your favorite/worst partys and why?
--I would have to say that Freedom and True Love tie for best partys. Theres
nuthin like stairing a a big mountain with crazy lazers all over it and
spending four hours in the shower the next day finding dirt EvErYwHeRe!!! The
DJs kicked all nite long and i have never watched a more unified sunrise. True
Love was the epitome of PLUR, the love that was flowin thru cyborganics that
nite was amazing i have never seen so many beautiful people, no matter how
sober one was they were never really sure
Worst party? i don't think there is such a thing, you make it what it is :o)

 What are the things you didnt like and woukd like to see 
 less of or not at all.
--Im sik of drugdealers but there seems to be a demand otherwise they wouldn't
be there at the door kissin your feet, ODs we don't need either, i like to
party with kiddos that are concious and no needles in the
bathrooms...pllleeezzze Also egotistical people arn't very fun, we're all
equal
 
 If you could have anything you wanted at a party, what would it be?
--The whole SFR kru. foam. and that bouncy house, oh and a vibe like no
other!!!!!
 
 What do you want to create in the community, at partys
 or just in general this coming year?
--Unity, i think we would make the best quilt if we all came together but for
some reason we can't
 
 What would you like to give to the community this year?
--my unconditional love, and everything i can to make you smile, laugh, dance
an get FuNkY! Oh yeah and a PARTY IN THA SNOW!!!!! details will be available
shortly :o)

As a general rule, I make my tapes 60 minutes (30 minutes a side).

I figure this gives folks enough to listen to without it feeling too 
overbearing (Hey, 30 solid minutes without a 4-on-the-floor beat is 
really hard for some folks to take!), and it also helps keep costs down at 
the duplication joint.

:)

Well, to me, the fwded message was just as "relevant" to raving as all
the posts cataloguing people's drug use/abuse, or all the posts talking
about vegetarianism, or ... whatever. I don't see you coming out
against people talking about drugs, but it's pretty clear that drug
abuse is far more harmful to "young teenagers" than, say, dildo abuse.
 
Basically, I don't agree that it is appropriate to single out
Satkriya's post and stand it up and give it a public spanking. 

And quite frankly, I'm sick of this "we're doing it for the children"
bullshit that has become a popular political means by which to  make
fascism, censorship and thought-control palatable to the masses. By the
same line of reasoning that you use to censor Satkriya, someone else
could say that all information about "raving" is inapprorpiate "for the
children"... 

Ultimately, if parents are worried about what their children are doing,
then perhaps they should be spending more time with them and teaching
them how to respond to messages they don't understand or perplex them,
rather than censoring. Censorship just indicates that children should
take special interest in the taboo subject matter, and that, if
anything, is what creates warped adults.

Besides, i'm sick of a culture that finds it perfectly acceptable to
condone various forms of drug use/abuse (incl. alchohol and tobacco),
blood & violence, war, greed, dominance/slavery/power etc. But when it
comes to anything dealing with sex, the human body, or even "weird"
behavior related to sex, well, that's just too freaky for "young
teenagers"... better take their mind off that subject by showing some
decapitations, clinical closups of gunshot wounds, or a still-beating
hearts ripped from the chest.... make war not love.

As far as I'm concerned, I'd rather see a butt-plug or a strap-on
glorified in the mass-media, but instead we glorify and accept guns and
killing-machines. But wHat can one expect from a society that glorifies
war and treachery against one's fellow humans.

But, hey, it's all "for the children" so it must be all right. Besides,
those violence-warped, sex/love-starved kids make for good cannon
fodder once they turn 18 and a war breaks out. it's all good.

Hi folks,

I think that this should have been marked NRR for sure,
however, I agree with Niels. We will blab about drugs
all day long, but the second someone says "dildo"
everyone runs for cover. 

This should have been marked appropriately, then let
each person decide if they want read it or not. We
should not be the ones to dictate what is correct to
post or incorrect. Censorship of any-kind is a pretty
touchy subject. My .02

Well the standard is a 90 on a chrome tape duped in a
pro place with a nice J-card. Doh!! was that the
party promoter in me Talking?? Well a nice Maxell XL
2 90 is the best and a nice recorder if you don't
have the mega bucks to put a "Pro tape" together. But
the bad thing about this is a lot of promoters just
want to get a free tape and can give a shit about
what is on it or who you are. At least that has been
my experience. So screw them go with a 60. Sorry list
as you can see I am still working through some shitty
promoter issues. :P~
it is funny cause I think I have only got one gig
from actually having a tape. But no matter 60 or 90
make sure the tape is good quality like Maxell or one
of the others.

Peace,
Macadio

well, I like to record mixtapes on 90 minute tapes.  I find it hard to cram
all the music I want to mix into anything less.

What are the things you liked about partys this year? great music as always,
maybe i'm getting old but it seems that i'm not so interested in crowded
overpacked poorly ventilated spaces, so i attended mostly massives and was
very impressed with what i saw  & heard

What are the things you experienced that you liked 
and would like to see more of?  Friendly security...and more people throwing
parties not for the $ but for the music and for the benefit of the scene here

What were your favorite/worst partys and why? 
The best? Gosh, it's hard to judge like that because each party has elements
which both disappoint and impress.  Explicit House was WAY up there...I
remember DUNE way back when...now THAT was the best of all time....um...HK was
too much like sardines packed in a box with no room to even move or dance

What are the things you didnt like and would like to see 
less of or not at all?
	What I  don't like? OD's at raves, kids abusing themselves and the space,
peeps who treat the UG like a business instead of a community 

If you could have anything you wanted at a party, what would it be?  Hahaha
Very funny question.  I think I'll plead the 5th on this one :)

What do you want to create in the community, at partys
or just in general this coming year?  An even stronger sense of family and
unity...less exploitation of the scene and greater awareness of the deeper
connection between music and (MY) sanity...

What would you like to give to the community this year?
Ummm, is this like the "what can you do for your country" line??
I think that being present as a positive influence is most important...
acceptance and understanding are also key, as are sharing hugs, smiles, and
long philosophical talks....(we all suddenly become philosophers in the wee
hours of the morn...=)

Happy holidays to all...be safe!

love
cryshia

SFRaves founder Brain Belendorf is featured in the Business Section of 
today's Chronicle, talking about his role in creating the Apache
web server software.

It mentions serveral times how Brian first got interested in the internet
by searching for "cool rave party" info online...

Niels, hush you're disturbing the children!

Seriously though, I'm with Neils on this one. While I can appreciate there
are younger folks on the list, I don't think we should have to censor
ourselves "for the good of the children."

Is there a online link so we can view it? I am
trapped at work and do not live in the city so it
will be a little hard for me to find a chronicle but
I would like to see the article..

Thanks,

I am looking for the cheapest place in the bay area to buy standard lighting
effects.  I am specifically interested in a Pro Beam for a Swirling Oil 
Projection.  Finding something used would be ideal.

Any info will be much apperciated...

Hey all!

I have a question for the list, just a general info.  Feel free to respond
to me personally if you'd rather not spam the list with the answers,
otherwise, feel free to post aloud and let the world know. :)

What do /you/ wear to Raves?

Does it depend on where the Rave is?

Does it depend on what your friends are wearing?

Do you go for comfort, or 'style'?

Feel free to tack on any other info you think is relevant.

Peace and love,
Haze

Here goes.... :)

> What do /you/ wear to Raves?
> 

Usually cybertropical/70s wear, modern stuff, or baggies.

> Does it depend on where the Rave is?
>

Yes. Outdoor parties are always more tribal. House parties are all about
the funk, techno/trance is new wave/spacey wear. Jungle is baggies and
earth colors. Or whatever is comfy.

> Does it depend on what your friends are wearing?
>

Nope. But it's fun to go dressed in a "mood" as a group. Wait until the
cybertropix crew goes all about.. hehe. :)

> Do you go for comfort, or 'style'?

Both.

I think external appearance is pretty nice. I like to look good at
parties, because it's a direct reflection of my feelings inside. I want
people to know I feel good about myself when I'm groovin'... and by them
knowing this they will be more prone to pick up the good vibes I try to 
share with others.

Also... my *favorite* music to dance to at parties is definately DEEEP
house. It has to be really soulful, emotional, jazzy and fun. It has to
have a lot of depth and emotion. It has to pull me in. You know
what'I'mean...? :) House House House.....

**What kinda music do you guys like most at parties?? If you stayed in one
room all night what would it be? And what DJ would it be...?

It would be House for me, and I'd love to hear DJ Sneak spinning an 8 hour
set... hehe.

Love,
Byron

Something that's clean (usually) that I can move in that's not too
hot or constricting.  Layers are good so I can shed/don clothing
to regulate body temperature.  Jewelry is rare, cuz it's just begging
to get lost, unless I have a lucky-talisman-of-the-week, in which
case it dosen't leave my sight.

>

In a way . . .  If it's in Detroit in the winter, I wear a coat . . .
But that's not the question.  For some reason, I like wearing a 
hockey jersey to a drum & bass party.  Don't ask me why, but it
just seems to fit.

> 
> Does it depend on what your friends are wearing?

Not really.

> 
> Do you go for comfort, or 'style'?

Comfort<-X------------------------------------>Style
That is, as comfortable as possible without looking like a dork.

> 
> Feel free to tack on any other info you think is relevant.

comfortable footwear is also important, since I'm often on my feet for
extended periods of time.  Barefoot is preferrable, but not always
feasable.  I also wear underwear (boxers) without any holes in it,
even though it's not going to show.

Well, you asked . . .

Steve.

THE GOLD BOX

We often learn the most from our children. Some time ago a friend of
mine punished his 3-year-old daughter for wasting a roll of gold
wrapping paper. Money was tight, and he became infuriated when the child
tried to decorate a box to put under the tree. 

Nevertheless, the little girl brought the gift to her father the next
morning and said, "this is for you daddy". He was embarrassed by his
earlier over reaction, but his anger flared again when he found that the
box was empty. He yelled at her, "Don't you know that when you give
someone a present, there's supposed to be something inside of it?" 

The little girl looked up at him with tears in her eyes and said,
"Oh, daddy, it's not empty. I blew kisses into the box. All for you,
Daddy".

The father was crushed. He put his arms around his little girl, and he
begged her forgiveness. My friend told me that he kept that gold box by
his bed for years. Whenever he was discouraged, he would take out an
imaginary kiss and remember the love of the child who had put it there.
In a very real sense, each of us as parents has been given a gold
container filled with unconditional love and kisses from our children.
There is no more precious possession anyone could hold.

==================

a bittersweet story that i recieved this morning.
I think i will send a few gold boxes this year also...full
of hugs and kisses.

Well I just got back from my travels, I had an awesome time in the East
Coast.  Did not get to rave at all, but still had
an awesome time.

So like I'm back, bored, have not been to a rave since Happy Kids on
Halloween and I want to party (Sober).

I went out with my old crew, The Backwon family ( I know I probably
misspelled that, but oh well, LIVE WITH IT  J/K ) and had an awesome time.
We went to Christmas in the Park, in San Jose.  We starred at the people
ice scatting, but none of us went on the ice.

I started seeing my ex again (as friends, I am so totally hoping for more,
but at least I have her friendship!!!, after trying to fight my self and
telling my self I don't love her, but DAMMIT!!!!! I DO!!!!!!! )

So now I hope to Rave a little bit more with her and all you wonderful !!!
kiddies !!!, before I take off to Europe in January for 6 weeks.....  ;-<

See all of you soon,

Matthew L. Downer
(AKA Cracked Out Elmo)
(AKA Kermit )

wow.

for those of you who weren't around a couple of years ago, neils p. meyer
told me years ago that he had created a filter to screen out all of my
messages .... guess that has changed.


>Well, to me, the fwded message was just as "relevant" to raving as all
>the posts cataloguing people's drug use/abuse, or all the posts talking
>about vegetarianism, or ... whatever. I don't see you coming out
>against people talking about drugs, but it's pretty clear that drug
>abuse is far more harmful to "young teenagers" than, say, dildo abuse.


perhaps that filter *is* working, and you just haven't read my messages,
becaue i have spoken out many many times about posts supporting and
glamorizing drug use and abuse.  i have also responded privately many times
to posts that i felt were inappropriate for a number of reasons, including
glamorizing drug use and things that were sexually inappropriate in my
opinion.  i also speak out against what appears to be sexist or racist
comments, either publicly or privately.

Additionally I am the mother of a teenager, and I have personal friendships
with many of the young people on this list .... as well as older people on
this list who for religious or personal reasons, are very likely to find
sexually graphic posts offensive and inappropriate.

and i don't think your analogy of drugs and dildoes holds up .... drugs are
a part of the rave culture, like it or not.  however, i don't recall seeing
many sex toys at parties of late.

i am on other rave-oriented lists where this would not have seemed
inappropriate because of the ages and personal relationships of the list
members.... but on sfraves, i strongly believe that *every* member needs to
be treated with respect, and that means not posting things that are far
off-topic and sexually explicit, because we are such a diverse group.
sorry, but i feel strongly about that.

then neils said...

sorry, you're barking up the wrong tree here... i think that my consistent
presence as a supportive figure in the rave community, as well as my
willingness to defend raving on national television, trying to speak up as
a positive voice for young people and the rave community in general in the
face of media disinformation, speak for who i am and what i am about...
calling my reasoning "fascism, censorship and thought control" is
laughable.

folks, to me there is a huge difference between censorship and
self-control.  i strongly believe that one of the most important personal
rules of behavior a responsible adult can have is to be aware of the
effects of their actions on others.

just as most of us would choose, out of respect and knowing what is
appropriate behavior, not to curse in front of our grandmothers, or to
smoke pot in front of our 6-year-old brother, we should be aware that
sfraves is like a family or a community, and that it's a public forum, it
is not the privacy of your own home.

i'm not saying "do it for the children" .... i'm saying remember where you
are, you are not at home in the privacy of your bedroom... you are, in
effect, in a room with 450 people, most of whom are not like you except
that they like raving, and when you take the stage, think about who you're
talking to, and use the same judgment in deciding what to say online that
you would if you were on that stage.

Well, on the nw-raves list we have a variety of subject codes
people use to decide which messages to dump and which to keep.
It automatically puts a [NWR] on the message to begin with...then they have:

[EVT] - for event information
[REV] - for party reviews
nrr, of course
[TECH] - for specific "gear talk"

so you can look at the subject of the message and tell immediately if you
want
to read it....
i have mixed feelings about this however. I understand what it can be like
to wade through massive amounts of email (i am on three lists! eek!) but
at the same time, it kind of makes it seem like certain messages are
important
and certain ones are not....If you aren't reading all the messages on the
list
then you might be missing out on something really cool.....on the other
hand,
they can be handy....

I'm sorry sir, but all the parties this weekend are "IO"(Intoxicated Only)

Dang are you supposed to wear clothes at a rave?
Maybe thats why i keep getting tossed out the back door.

	
actually i wear what i wear anywhere else but i really enjoy
the costumes others create...i just havent got around to 
making any myself. I do have some ideas for some interesting
clothing if there is anyone out there that sews and would be
interested in such a project....maybe we will become a famous
rave design team and become filthy rich and then we will be
on all the promoters "special ravers list" so we wont have 
to pay for partys anymore.

I'm sorry sir, but all the parties this weekend are "IO"(Intoxicated Only)
events. Guess you'll just have to stay at home.

Naughty Santa's Bizarre Bazaar

Sunday, December 21st, from 3-11pm
SOMAR Gallery 934 Brannan St. @ 8th in SF
$5-15 sliding scale

Info: http://www.laughingsquid.com/santa/naughty/

Oh no! Only four days 'til Christmas! Is it too late to order the usual
fruit arrangement for Aunt Gladys and Uncle Porcupine? Man, can the 
pears
and come on down to the second annual Naughty Santa's Bizarre Bazaar! 
Your
friends already have everything? No problem, Naughty Santa has 
everything
else!

This year there are even more artists and oddities, fabulous
entertainment, great food and libations (beer from Brewery Atlantis),
video projections, and cushy lounges -we've filled the entire SOMAR
Gallery to overflowing!  Art, fashion, flatware, zines, videos, unusual
jewelry, music and more.  Who wouldn't love a bubblewrap bustier? [Other
than Uncle Porcupine!] How about two tables of official Burning Man
paraphenelllia? Autographed Christian socks! Nowhere else but Naughty
Santa's.

San Francisco luminaries will be in attendance including: the Space
Cowgirls (as seen on CNN) and their new outrageous clothing line, Brian
"Defenestration" Goggin, Philo "Art Car Mogul" Northrup, and Michael
"Danger Ranger" Mykal will be hosting the Twisted Toy Making Table, The
Cyberbuss, The Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence, Michael Peppe, and those
are only the ones we'll tell you about ahead of time!

Even if you already have your shopping done there's plenty of fun at
Naughty Santa's. Thrill to videos documenting outrageous events from
S.F.'s alternative to the alternative curated by Laughing Squid
Productions. Chill in the Black Light Video Lounge brought to you by 
Museo
Contempo, and drink the heavenly Nub Chai. Explore the groove in The 
Funk
Side as DJ Toph hosts a wild terrain of artists, writers, magazines and
DJ's spinning and selling music and stuff from SF's hot hip-hop based
beathead Kultcha!

In addition to the DJ's-which include Deena Davenport, Alvin-A-Go-Go,
Otto, and John Hell-you'll be wowed by the Yule-tribal drumming of Santa
Worship.  And if you're wondering what awaits you under the tree this
year, visit Prophesies Unlimited, our team of pagan prognosticators. We
advise getting your picture taken with Naughty Santa and Mistress Clause
at the Bazaar, to verify your whereabouts and assure you get what's 
coming
to you!

I used to wear sweats and only sweats to the ravEs. Because I planned on
dancing all night long. And I HATE it when my pants stick to my legs slowing
me down.

But then I got myself a pair of JNCO's.. And they were just as easy to dance
in as sweats.

Image is nothing. Obey me!

I am writing this for all davsi area ravers/people.  I am coming back to
davis from xmas break on the 27 of this month.  I would like to meet some
or all of you, and I was wondering if anyone would be interested in
getting together sometime after the 27.  People could come over to my
place, hang out, bring their records to spin, etc.  Please email me back
to let me know if anyone is interested so I can plan something.  Peace
			Ken

>What do /you/ wear to Raves?

Usually whatever I am wearing that day, plus an additional ounce of glitter
and i color my hair (i have neon orange and red hair paints)

However, my normal clothes are : some type of giant pants (preferably
in a strange and funky fabric and color), a smaller t-shirt (preferably with
weird drawings or writing on it) and platform sneakers.

So in a sense I am dressed up all the time, 'cause my "normal" clothes
kind of look like party clothes anyway.

I tend to change sneakers before parties because platforms are fun to wear
but impossible to dance in. I find that airwalks and vans make good dancing
shoes.

On the subject of shoes - Why do I see so many ravers wearing Nike? That
really bothers me.

>Does it depend on where the Rave is?

Well, if it's a dirty warehouse I won't wear my pants with the white fur at
the bottom
because they'd get dirty....

It doesn't really matter where it is...

>Does it depend on what your friends are wearing?

Not at all, most of my friends don't dress like me....

>Do you go for comfort, or 'style'?

Aren't they the same thing? How can you feel good if you're not comfortable?
I don't really have any uncomfortable clothes.....

Here's my additional question:

Where do you guys shop for clothes online? I like the following stores:

http://www.alloyonline.com
(big pants, sweaters, stickers)
http://www.girliewear.com
(cute girlie tees and underwear)

We all have our beliefs on what is right and what is wrong(I'm not
talking about large scale things like murder, for those on this list
who have trouble reading between the lines).  One of my beliefs is that
censorship is total hypocracy.  With censorship you are trying to FORCE
your beliefs onto someone else who obviously doesn't beleive the same
thing you do.  But there is nothing wrong with voiceing your opinion to
especially to see if everyone else agrees.  I'm not trying to preach to
you, I think too much of that has been done on this list already.  I'm
basically saying that this list is all about fun and those poems were all
in good humor I thought they were great.  I realy don't see much of a
difference between clit clips and E anyway.  They both effect the mind and
cause the body to be touched, and I've seen both in public in SF and not
at RAVES.  So lighten up and have some fun, that is all this list is about
anyway.

What a wonderful idea, Haze!!

Personally, I can't go to a rave unless I have my electric blue wig on -
and it's surprisingly versatile! : P

>What do /you/ wear to Raves?
as little as I can get away with ( it gets really hot), this usually
consists of baggy pants and a small top.  No skirts or dresses though, I
have seen to many guys getting way to friendly with those that do where
them. No thank you!!  

>
>Does it depend on where the Rave is?
Outside beach parities, or wherehouse parties  I do the opposite, layers,
layers, long underwear, and more layers. 
>
>Does it depend on what your friends are wearing?
Not at all.

>
>Do you go for comfort, or 'style'?

I always think of comfort above all  and my own personal style.  I like
to wear collars, spiked or chains, I don't usually see many ravers
wearing those ( the only I can think of is Squeeze, what ever happened to
him?) .  I don't go out much, and that includes raving (only about once a
month) so when I do I love  to get as nutty as I can.  Holloween is my
favorite holiday and I will go all out with out blinking an eyelash.>


>Feel free to tack on any other info you think is relevant.
Sometimes I wear glitter  and sometimes I don't, sometimes (like on
Holloween) I get really dressed up and wear my sparkly pants and shirt
with tassels, and sometimes I where my plastic pants.  In other words I
were  what I want , at all times.  I enjoy making little things to put in
my hair, and accessorize with  my out fits. (flowers, or little glow in
the dark things, little fish, eyeballs,  anything that would make
somebody else smile)  I don't go to attract the opposite sex, even though
I might be wearing very little clothing but like I said before it get
damn hot most of the time, I choose to be comfortable.. Sometime I have
to out of my way to make sure people don't get that idea, and I have to
admit it still doesn't always work.>

RLove

maybe next year I will get burning man and try no clothes and see how I
like that.

I am sorry if I offended anyone, but it sounds like more people thought it
was funny than offensive. ;)  I would have labeled it, if I had paid more
attention to what I was doing and for that I apologize.

In a message dated 97-12-18 15:27:39 EST, you write:

<< What do /you/ wear to Raves?
I like to wear clothes that Teresa makes for me =)
I like to wear glitter and glow toys.
I like to wear big pants and fur and holographic/phsychedelic prints.
I like my bracelets and necklaces and stickers
I like cool stripes and piping and backpacks with bright colors on them.
 
 Does it depend on where the Rave is?
I think it depends on the rave.  Usually, I'll just pick out a random outfit,
but for things like Halloween or special occasions, I might create an outfit
with a theme
 
 Does it depend on what your friends are wearing?
 Never has, never will =)  

 Do you go for comfort, or 'style'? >>
I think it's a little bit of both.  ravers definately have their own "style",
but when I pick out a quote/unquote stylish outfit it's most likely gonna have
to be comfy enough to dance in all night.  

 Clothes create a vibe for me.  I get excited all the time when I see someone
wearing pants that I like, or a shirt that I think is cool.  If people didn't
dress so crazy and unique at parties, I don't think I'd have as much fun.
That's not to say that you have to dress a certain way to be a raver, but when
else do you get the chance to?

       Hugs n'stuff,

and plus, dear meat taste good especailly when healthy.......

just kidding - I've read some Vedic literature that reducing the
tendancies of eating animals will lessen the urge for violence in
human nature, this is ofcourse a truncated explanation. Talk to your

is it wise to get presale tickets for this party, or will it be 
come-one/come-all? are there even presale tix? it's been ages since
i've been to a gathering, and well, raving has gotten a bit more
popular since the last one i attended in 94 (i think).

 Word is that it will be ticket sales at the door, first-come, first
served.

 It's been awhile for me too - I'm going to bring a friend to his first
rave this Saturday! I'm counting on the Gathering to deliver the goods.

 If I remember, I'll drag him over to the water station at 1AM to meet 
all the old & new SFRavers ...

What day it the show and what time does it start.  Dr. W's show on Mon
2:30 was pretty good if it is still on next quarter.

The Gathering (6 years!) looks like the biggest party of the weekend,
with Sunshine Daydream leading into it (during the day on Saturday).
For a bit smaller crowd, try the Imperial Dub party or Candyland or Revival.
On Sunday, I believe the music marathon will be netcast as well on 
www.cybertribe.com. 

Next week's calendar will be out on Tuesday or Wednesday due to the
holiday on Thursday.

well I had the caps lock on I guess sorry.

I don't have home internet access because I have no
home computer, and at this point in my life I don't
really need it because the place I work has pretty
well loaded computers.  And let me take this further
to say that there are still people out there who have
no home-computers and must rely on public access to
computers.

My thoughts on the subject;

Prepending the original post with a warning probably would have been a
responsible thing to do.  Putting "NRR" in the subject line really should
have been done too.  The content certainly wasn't more offensive or
"dangerous" than the sex and raving threads we had going a few weeks ago,
maybe a bit more concentrated.  :)

My usual statements about relevancy to the list and respecting other
members' overflowing mailboxes still apply!

	Brian

Any ideas on *approximately* where the Gathering will be Saturday night?
Deep East Bay, "near" East Bay, SF, etc?

And where's the SFR meeting place?  :)

Envision: A box with two side-by-side DVD-ROM drives, a mixing console on
top with two jog/shuttle wheels and various searching/looping controls, and
a flat screen attached like a laptop screen, with a video out so what's on
the monitor can be displayed by a projector or something.  Now on each
home-burned DVD-ROM would be just hours and hours and hours of
128kbit-compressed audio (MPEG, liquid audio, whateva) that would be
multitrack versions of songs.  The beat, basslines, hi-hats, and five or
six melody lines would all be separate tracks, composed together using MIDI
or some other file format.  The interface would allow you to segue from one
track to the next sequentially - cut out song 1's beat, cut out song1's
melody, drop in song 2's beat, drop back in song 1's melody, drop in song
2's melody, drop out other parts of song 1, etc.  Add a few other pieces of
software like Rebirth and maybe a sampling tool, and you'd have a live
performance box which would completely blur the line between DJ and
musician forever.  Best of all, I think a box like this could be
mass-produced TODAY for under $1000 - DVD-ROM drives are already like $180
each, PC hardware is getting cheaper all the time.  The only real limit is
that artists typically don't release multitrack versions of their songs,
and there aren't any DVD-ROM burners yet.

I just brought home a CD-R burner I've had attached to the new Hyperreal
for the last couple months, and am in the process of burning my vinyl to
CD.  The software I'm using removes clicks and pops and scratch sounds too,
so the stuff ends up sounding pristine.  And, blank CD-R's are now down
below $2 each in bulk.  Maybe someday soon I'll have a vinyl sale. :)

A party a few years ago ('93?) held down on Mission near Army: a trumpet
player named "Blow" and a DJ named Doc Martin kicked mucho ass.  The
trumpet player had a roaming mic too so you'd be dancing and next thing you
know you'd see this guy playing the song you were grooving hard too.  Doc
picked some great music to use as a base for it too; very light on the
highs and melodies, and sparse so as to let the trumpet player improvise
freely.  Tons of fun.

Whad 'ap People?!

I have secured a condo in Tahoe for the week of New Years and would very 
much like somebody to spin New Years eve at a gathering I am having. What 
do you get? All of the free booze you can handle, some free grinds, 
interaction with a cool crew and free lodging if you don't mind sharing the 
floor, hot tub, etc! There might be some cash in it or some other perks, 
 but I can't make any promises as the condo is quite expensive. I don't 
mean to offend anybody but when you look at $2800 for the condo alone, and 
lord knows how much for the other stuff, there just ain't a lot of 
expendable dough left over.

Expecting anywhere from 30 to 60 people, perhaps more. It's in South Lake 
Tahoe conveniently located near casinos and resorts. Thick fresh pow so wax 
your rig, strap in and hit it!

Of course any of you lovely gravy ravy gals are encouraged to attend too 
(o: There is a small cost associated to help cover expenses except to the 
DJ. This is not an open party.

EMAIL if interested.

    Oh wellz, I wanted to apologize to all the #sfravers I disappointed in
some way tonight.  : (  I didn't know each of your e-mail addresses so I
thought a post to the list would suffice.
    *Side note* I know SFRaves is not a paging service, etc, but I feel
really bad for unintentionally misleading my friends.  : )
    Forgive me?
    Silver lining?  We all got to see each other again?  : )

    *STAY POSITIVE*

    Nico

P.S. Props to Byroni, Chris, Toof, Toof's friend, Nicole, Nicole's friend
Kelly, Czefir (thanks for the ride!), Joe, Dennise, Jedi, and all the
#sfravers that were with us in spirit for showing up and dancing to some
really lame stuphf tonight with me.  : ) : )  I think you're all too damn
picky but hey, it's all good in Nico's hood, just so long as you don't hate
me.  : )

well, dahling, it's cuz you keep changing e-mail addresses.

actually, i've removed all the personal filters from SFR, and just
apply interactive thread and/or name killers during the mail-reading
process as time and interest permits. My mail filters now fight SPAM,
which is the true Jihad that needs to be fought right now.

I'm sure you've spoken out about something.... but, I don't see the
need for a net.cop. Besides, what makes your opinion any more "right"
than mine which says it isn't? Or is the person that complains the most
automatically right?

I've seen semi-nekkid girlz dancing in cages w/ whips at massive (all
ages) raves even recently... what kind of image is that portraying to
the kids? Is talk of a dildo on sfraves worse for a young teenager than
the gauntlet of drug-dealers you pass through at every massive (all
ages) rave?? Or is that some quiet secret that we all know and just
don't talk about?

Basically "parties of late" have sucked. Raves are just not as freaky
as they used to be, and people are getting more and more fucked up on
wack drugs. Raving and club culture used to be really fringe, too
fringe for massive dollars to flow in from Buffy and Biff of the
high-school social set. Now it's mainstream, with mainstream,
lowest-common-denominator, milquetoaste values. This is sad, especially
given that raving came from an even freakier and fetishistic milieu... 
I guess you never went to any underground parties in SF in the 85-88
timeframe. I went to some pretty kinky parties in my time, back when
drag queens and weirdoes of all sorts could "do their thing" and "strut
their stuff" unmolested (unless they wanted to be) and unjudgled. These
were not really much different from raving during it's peak -- in fact
raving has done nothing other than mainstream (and straighten) an
underground dance-club culture that has been going on for a long time.

Bottom line is that the notion that music/culture/media needs to be
censored "for the children" is a very old concept. The story has 
always been about sexual values that did not coincide with mainsteeam
culture of the time, and that these sexual values would pervert the
minds of young innocent teenagers luring them towards the ravages of
decadence. The story is as old as Jazz, Rock-and-Roll, Disco, and
Raving, and it's been a losing battle every time. If you're worried
about such real-world influences affecting your children, then take
control and provide the moral and ethical leadership that your child
needs. But don't censor/control other people just because american
parenting refuses to take responsibility for itself. That's the real
problem here -- that parents think that government and society is
responsible for raising their children, rather than themselves.

there's so much NRR on this list that some humourous post about fetish
toys sung to "my favorite things" hardly seems to be something to get
stressed about. perhaps i am INSULTED and AFFRONTED by the postings 
discussing raver fashion tips, but I would not presume to censor people
simply because I think raver fashion is stupid. Besides, it was a hell
of a lot more interesting/humorous to read that post than many a post
to this list.

I personally don't think there is much to defend w/r/t raving. It's
track record speaks for itself. We all know exactly what goes on at
raves, we all know that unsafe sex, wack drugs, inebriated driving, and
other acts of stupidity happen, and that these are attractive acts of
stupidity for young people. But if people weren't getting their yaya's
out on raving, they'd be doing it with rock-and-roll, or disco, or
hip-hop, or jazz or whatever cultural youth movement happened prior to
raving. To me there's no difference, except for a different fashion,
dance, and music.

Like I said before, you seem to have a false image of your role on that
tabloid tv show -- whether it was your intent or not, you became part
of that melodrama and hype-mongering dog-and-pony show by lending what
seemed to be a voice-of-reason to a lineup of circus-freaks and
druggies. It made the ridiculous and sensational statements made by
others seem like "just another opinion" because you were there to give
the illusion that they were providing balanced information and fair
reporting. But fact is that you were outnumbered many-to-one by voices
saying that raving is a cult that will swallow your children whole and
turn them into drug-snarfling, parent-disobeying,
sneak-out-of-the-house-at-midnight  delinquents.  And it probably will.
In fact, I think you were being disingenuous by not telling the truth
that *SOME* people do use drugs at raves, just like *SOME* raver's
parents used drugs at rock-and-roll events, just like raver's
grandparents used drugs at jazz/dance events ...

> calling my reasoning "fascism, censorship and thought control" is
> laughable.

I never called your reasoning "fascism, censorship and thought
control". However, the "we're doing it for the children" line of
reasoning IS being used for just those purposes, right now, in national
political maneuverings that will limit our free-speech use of the
internet as a communications medium. The move to abridge these rights
is a central part of the communications decency act which has now been
repackaged into legistlative motions that will not be  easy to defend
from a constitutional and freedom-of-speech standpoint. "were doing it
for the children" is equally a part of the national fight by the FBI to
outlaw private and secure communications, which directly conflicts with
our constitutional rights to virtual peacable assembly, freedom from
virtual search and seisure, and our right-to-bear cryptographic-arms
against a government that is no longer representing the will of the
people. These constitutional rights are fundamental to securing
whatever vestiges of democracy remain in our nation, and by allowing
them to be abridged, we are opening the door to fascism.

Here goes.... :)

> What do /you/ wear to Raves?
> 

Usually cybertropical/70s wear, modern stuff, or baggies.

> Does it depend on where the Rave is?
>

Yes. Outdoor parties are always more tribal. House parties are all about
the funk, techno/trance is new wave/spacey wear. Jungle is baggies and
earth colors. Or whatever is comfy.

> Does it depend on what your friends are wearing?
>

Nope. But it's fun to go dressed in a "mood" as a group. Wait until the
cybertropix crew goes all about.. hehe. :)

> Do you go for comfort, or 'style'?

Both.

I think external appearance is pretty nice. I like to look good at
parties, because it's a direct reflection of my feelings inside. I want
people to know I feel good about myself when I'm groovin'... and by them
knowing this they will be more prone to pick up the good vibes I try to 
share with others.

Also... my *favorite* music to dance to at parties is definately DEEEP
house. It has to be really soulful, emotional, jazzy and fun. It has to
have a lot of depth and emotion. It has to pull me in. You know
what'I'mean...? :) House House House.....

**What kinda music do you guys like most at parties?? If you stayed in one
room all night what would it be? And what DJ would it be...?

It would be House for me, and I'd love to hear DJ Sneak spinning an 8 hour
set... hehe.

Love,
Byron

It looks from the posting by Ran D. Dreams that it's all taking place at
VSF... all day. Groovy.

ps. As for the meeting spot.... I totally mis-judged the amount of
moving/cleaning I have to do by Saturday.... (my roommate is jetting on
Sat at 10am) and we're supposed to be gone by then.... :(  so I'm going to
be DEEP into the house cleaning... (maybe listening to DEEP house
too.ha..)...  so I dunno if I'll make it. But you guys should meet in the
MAIN dj area (where the sky light opens up ) at some point......

 Ran D. Dreams' post was about the Ambient Room at The Gathering, and
did not mention club VSF. The sfraves calendar shows an all day event
called "Sunshine Daydream, a daytime gathering" at club VSF. It is
listed right under the listing for The Gathering, which may be the
cause of the confusion on Byroni's part.

 Having just gone through a house move , I can understand how he
could have gotten things a little mixed up!

heck, as long as we're at it, might as well pipe in some live
improvisation from bangladesh via isdn, like the fsol/robert fripp
duets on their virtual us tour.  as for multitracked music (where you
can bring in one or more elements from a song and mix it on top of
elements from other songs), you can already download from the web
tracks composed on the rebirth program (which is basically 2 303's an
808 and a 909 faithfully reproduced on a pc), or get cdroms with
multitracked compositions from various artists.  then throw in a
loopman synced to the beat (again this technology is already available
fairly cheaply) and you can sample loops from old soul albums of "the
tibetan monks" or diologues from your favorite movies and thrown them
in as well....

of course there are lots of other cool ways to use technology
available now.  my own ideal setup would be a laptop with rebirth and
a sequencer, one of those paperback-sized roland samplers you can get
for $400, and a pocket sized efects unit, all run through a tiny mixer
into a pair of small powered speakers and a dat walkman.  i've seen
all this technology in stores, it's not that expensive either (if you
have a laptop already the rest of the stuff would cost about as much
as 2 techniques a mixer and flight cases...) - and could all fit in a
briefcase.   i see myself using such a setup for two purposes.  one
would be to set it up on a street corner at midnight and play trumpet
over long strethes of acidy hip hop or jungle or what have you.  
second, i could carry it with me overseas, thus enableing me to
(possibly) become the third-world pop star/producer i've always wanted
to be (i hear jakarta has a pretty decent local club scene...)  or
maybe just do cool electronic/organic jams with peeps in remote
hymalayan villages...

minds.  From the title track to the b-sides ' Reckless Zoom ' and '
Urgionomics ', Organised Noise is attaining the level of similar quality
techno labels from Detroit to London and beyond.

*Tim 'Love' Lee-Confessions of a Selector
SR9718                                                   out now           CD
label: Silent / Three-Sixty
SF's 360 & Tim Love Lee has gotten their act together on this CD. Funky,
melodic, and sometimes just twisted, "Confessions Of A Selector" is the
90's soundtrack for life in the 70's.  As one reviewer put it, " '
Confessions ' makes me want to get naked and watch Bullitt at 6am with a
tall boy of ice cold Coors and Hunter S. Thompson at my side..."  The
effect will be different for some, but the groove is universal.

*Astral Matrix-#6                SR9718               out now          12"
label: Silent / O.O.B.E.
Straight outta San Francisco's underground, Astral Matrix's sixth 12" adds
another thumpin' chapter to the OOBE catalog.  A solid four tracker, '
Number Six ' covers a lot of territory.  From the lush technological cut '
Bass Faerie ' to the darkly percussive and minimal track ' Triangles ',
this EP is yet another achievement for this excellent local artist.

*Jondi & Spesh-We Are Connected  SR9722                out now          12"
Inspired by the Sweet! parties and ' Live at Half moon Bay ' show, this is
the second EP in the collaboration between Trip 'N Spin and Silent.  Floor
rocking trancey house with a left-coast feel.  Remixes by NovaBass.

hi =) i am from seattle and happy to answer your question.
If you check my web page (address in signature) it lists all
upcoming events here.

I also do an info line which is like the "buzz line" in SF (i think that's
what it's called) which lists all parties coming up at (206) 346-0378.

I would love to hook up with any SF ravers who are going to be
visiting and party!!!!!!

I am very excited to be going to SF for new years =)

love kim

=========================================

On the 12th day of the Eurocentrically imposed midwinter festival, my 
potential-acquaintance-abuse-survivor gave to me,

 TWELVE males reclaiming their inner warrior through ritual drumming,
 
 ELEVEN pipers piping (plus the 18-member pit orchestra made up of
 members in good standing of the Musicians Equity Union as called for
 in their union contract even though they will not be asked to play a
 note...),
 
 TEN melanin-deprived testosterone-poisoned scions of the patriarchal
 ruling class system leaping,
 
 NINE persons engaged in rhythmic self-expression,
 
 EIGHT economically disadvantaged female persons stealing milk-products
 from enslaved Bovine-Americans,
 
 SEVEN endangered swans swimming on federally protected wetlands,
 
 SIX enslaved fowl-Americans producing stolen nonhuman animal products,
 
 FIVE golden symbols of culturally sanctioned enforced domestic
 incarceration,
 
 (NOTE: after a member of the Animal Liberation Front
 threatened to throw red paint at my computer, the calling birds,
 French hens and partridge have been reintroduced to their native
 habitat. To avoid further animal-American enslavement, the remaining gift
 package has been revised.)
 
 FOUR hours of recorded whale songs,
 
 THREE deconstructionist poets,
 
 TWO Sierra Club calendars printed on recycled processed tree carcasses,
 
 and a Spotted Owl activist chained to an old-growth pear tree.

	Recently I went to guitar center and the salesman totally talked me into
buying Roland's new DJ-70mkii, a performance sampler.  You can load while
play (all 30 some odd keys at once/seperate), it does on the fly
timestretching, and it hooks up to a hard or ZIP drive.  Sweet ass machine,
so I ordered one, then went home and looked at my computer.

	Does the same damn thing.

	The only difference is that it's not a keyboard so I am not playing it
"live" per say. 

	But neither is the Roland DJ-70mkii, it's a computer disguised as a
keyboard!!!  The only reason to buy it is so you can fool people when your
up on stage "performing".

	So be careful, my friends, the only equipment you will need to make
electronic music is a computer (that's all ANY synth/sampler/module is). 
We just have to wait a bit for the software to get there.

The beauty of samplers is that they are *dedicated* to sampling.  Sure,
a computer will do the same thing, but at the same time, would you
rather carry a computer, mouse, keyboard, and monitor to a gig or a two
space rack mounted sampler?  The other draw back is that a computer
tends to crash because of all it's extraneous programs in the operating
system, while samplers have a streamlined operating system that make it
much less prone to crash.  True, one day there will be software that
rivals that of the best samplers so that you could play a whole show
from a laptop, but right now nothing beats samplers such as the DJ-70
mkII for live performance.

DJ: Uncle Noah
Mixtape: Sprung (Spring '97), Abduction Productions, 1997
Contact: unclenoa@netcom.com

Last Spring, Uncle Noah flew up from Southern California to play at one of
the SF undergrounds...(was it SuperLove?...one of those parties at the
Cyborganic venue).  

Anyway, toward the end of his set I looked up to check out Uncle Noah, and
the boy was nowhere to be seen.  Did he duck down to snatch the next record?
Or maybe Carlos was filling in for him for a song or two?  Nah. The unmanned
turntables were still kicking out beats,  and Uncle Noah was bouncing around
the dancefloor, tossing out free copies of "Sprung"  to the broke masses.
I've been wanting to do a review of it ever since, but I'm only just getting
around to it now.

The tape opens up with a sample lifted from KDBS Radio (Univ. Cal)-a warning
about listener discretion.  The tape grabbed my heart right away, because
I'm a big fan of Dj's who dig for samples.   But the listener discretion is
important too,   because Uncle Noah proceeds to kick the shit out of you.
He leaps out of the right-hand corner like a kickboxer on crack, punching
and kicking out a barrage of breakbeats.

I know this description makes it sound a little aggro--and it doesn't help
that breakbeat has a reputation for attracting the tuffguys and the
scowlers.  My own experience with breakbeat is that it is the best music for
the full-body workout--it's the only music that gives my arms and legs an
equal test.
And anyone who says that breakbeat ain't cute, wait til you hear
"1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8"  by DJ Icey.  Perhaps the cutest song I've heard from the
electronic music category.

But "Sprung", though it offers kickage of the ass, dominates the land of
happiness.   There are hints of the postmodern drifting through the
programming. Noahs breakbeats sometimes take the chance to describe our
'70's childhoods...a remix of a 70's TV theme (I wish I could pinpoint
it--Charlies Angels?  Columbo?).  A Charlie Brown sample of a kid trying to
solve a math problem (complete with the Teacher speaking  the "Wa-Wah"
tongue),  hints at the
brainwracking  mathematics of mixing beats.  Also keep your ear open for the
familiar Michael Jackson "I'mma-say I'mma sah a mah-coosah" sample.  

The tape ends with a brilliantly placed sample (perfectly synched with the
end of the tape) from that burned out duo, Cheech & Chong, closing out their
radio show.  

I'm particularly interested in what's happening here, at the end of the
tape, because this is something that I experimented with on my last tape.
The end of the tape (Cheech and Chong Radio sample)  leads right back to the
beginning of the tape (the Cal University radio sample).   By referring back
to the very beginning,  there's a sort of continuity.  Or at the very least,
a closure that hasn't forgotten  where the mixtape began.

Mixing skills: fine.  absolutely no problems to my ear(and breakbeat is the
hardest!)
Programming:  Wonderful.  Creative.  Intriguing.

And the final test--
As a soundtrack for knockin boots:  Hard, strong rhythm. Testosterone beats
with a soft edge in theme and lyrical content.

Uncle Noah is a SoCal Boy, but he's on SFRaves and it's not unusual to see
him in the Bay Area.  Keep 'em coming, Noah!

Want your mixtape reviewed? Send me a tape.  I'll review it. 
Disclaimer:  I do these reviews as a listening and a writing exercise. My
own beatmatching skills are ridiculous.  But I have a pretty good ear, as
long as my fidgeting fingers don't get in the way.  I represent Joe Raver,
not The Collective Family of Flawless DJs.  This is not to say that I won't
review flawless DJs.  But all we can do is our best, so send me yours!

It doesn't matter what you  wear to a party..all it matters is if you are
comfortable in what your wearing..if you feel like wearing tight clothes,
go for it...no one cares! =P

Hi all!  ]=}

 Some last minute changes... Dionysus Dreams was slated to do an art 
installation piece involoving lasers and crystals. However we were 
called upon at the last minute to cover visuals and some decorations for 
the ambient space. As a result the art piece won't be happening (anyone 
wishing to see the piece can catch it at The Digital Be-In on Jan. 9th), 
but slides, lighting and more will be coverd by Dionysus Dreams at The 
Gathering 6 Year.

 Hope everyone has a healthy and happy weekend!  :)

hugz,

Ran D. Dreams

So, do you really think that simply because you support the majority of the
community that it gives you permission to request just a "little"
censorship of the minority with whom you happen to disagree?

Come on...  that's like saying you're just a "little" pregnant.  It doesn't
really work like that.

Either you are... or you're not.
And I think you are.

evening ...

	Well, we end up at Nikita Fri PM and I'm all psyched cuz DAN is
spinning and I was with some really kewl peeps and we're all jolly
with holiday chEEr and such.
	The vibe was spotty at first, then evened out as the night went on, but
overall, I wasn't really too impressed with Dan's (or simon's) set.  I mean, 
everyone looked like they were having a blast and I had hella fun, but the 
tunes were often just too "disco-ey" and the set was pretty flat as far as 
energy went.  Perhaps I'm just into harder stuff lately, but his music just
didn't take me where I wanted to go, if ya know what I mean
None of those earth-shattering "OHMIGODthisisincredible" kind of tunes...
maybe he's just better when he spins at raves?   
	Well, I still had a kewl time (hi Hai!!) and met some incredibly awesome and
wacky peeps (Hi Andy , Hi Junior!), and I finally got to meet Leslie!!  =))
Was anyone else there?  Similar opinions ?

Have a Merry Holiday break everyone!

luv n jumbo-size hugs,
natasha

I have a question for anyone who knows about digital recording.  I have a
demo tape of my band that I wanted to out onto CD.  However, I ONLY have it
on audio tape, NOT in digital format.  What would be the best way for me to
put it on to cd?  I have a cd-RW burner and a soundcard in my computer.  I
am looking for quality, but do not have the money right now to buy hardware
for my computer.  I know I could plug into the in jack of my soundcard
through a walkman, but am not sure of what quality I would get this way.
Any suggestions would be appreciated?

So where's the g-spot?

Is there an official g<gathering>spot tonight at the
gathering? I will probably be too busy to get 
to the g-spot but you can stop by the door on your
way in or out and say hello. 
Martin has a reputation for creating some unforgetable partys.
I have worked for several promoters and as far as working
conditions go he is the best and that means a happy staff
and therefore a happy party. The gatherings are not to be missed.

so if we dont meet at the g-spot, you can come to the ticket table
and say hello...i have long brown/red hair and mustache, medium
build and height and green fishy eyes that make me look like i 
havent slept in years.

happy holidaze wherever you are!

I look forward to seeing many of you tonight.

If you were to get a cd-rom about the SFRave scene, would you want the

soundtrack to be totally crazy or would that be too distracting....a more 
slow, ambient
techno track would be more appropriate??

Hell folks,

As some of you may have figured out, I ended up being forced into going 
to the edge last night as I was with some 18+ friends who insisted on 
going to a club, (rather then a party, or doing anything else.) SOooo, I 
decided to go because i hadn't seen them in a long time, and 
thought...well...I'll keep an open mind about the Edge...maybe it won't 
be that bad, maybe everyone was just exagerating about how bad of a club 
it was........

that is the WWWRRROOONNNGGGG ANSWER!

Let me tell you a little something about my experience last night. First 
of all...the vibe there SUCKED...were talking HARDCORE SUCKAGE! It was 
shallow...It was shallower then the deep end of one of those plastic 
KIDDIE POOLS...the music was LIGHTCORE...NON-ENERGETIC house, and the 
crowd was a ton of drunken "freakers" all try to do the butt with all my 
friends....I was pissed off. The vibe in the main room was soooo bad 
that I was forced to dance to eighties music all night! Which wouldn't 
have bothered me if it weren't for all the SLUTS in the 80's room giving 
me nasty looks, and for those of you who jest by saying something along 
the lines of "you should have gone for that!"...let me tell you, I would 
rather be strapped to a chair and forced to watch the home shopping 
channel for the rest of my life.

Anywayz, I know I haven't said any real constructive critisism about the 
place, but truely it's a waste of my breath...everyone says the place is 
horrible...so I'll throw my ballot in with the rest...I VOTE SUCKS, if 
you're planning on going...listen to the masses, they know what there 
talking about...don't go...save yourself a night of frustration.

ah the edge, such fond memories of time past.  i don't go there often
anymore but know a couple of top guns (one is a cofounder) there
through a good friend.  they are cool to me.

but other than those two people, i couldn't say much about the edge
other than that it had served my purpose as a young lad while going to
school.  now my memories of the edge is dim except for a couple of
events.  

one time one of the guys mentioned above gave me a couple of vip
cards, two gals saw the process, they came right over and tried to
charm me for my the cards.  one worker came along and handed a couple
of free cd's to the gals, and to me, not even a look.  hey don't i
look pretty enough.  well seemed like you gals have been spoiled
enough already so i'll keep my vip cards, which i ended up never use. 
next week at a rave some dj was throwing out mix tapes and i waved at
him.  zzzzoooip, a mix tape came my way.  now how cool was that.  and
i didn't even have my makeup on that night.

and then there were my beers.  i seem to spill and waste them on my
own enough times already but the securities had to throw two of my
bottles 1/3 full away for me when i wasn't looking, in just one night.
 they thought i was done with them.  talked to the bartender and she
gave me the bad vibe.  no more tips tonight.  two weeks ago i was at
static and the bartender inadvertently threw away my bottle 1/2 full
and there was one i spilled on my own (see), he came right back with a
couple of fresh ones, for free.  guess where i made good use of the
tips that i had saved up from the edge?  now how cool was that.

merry goofy christmas everybody.. 

hugs,
hai

moving back to the Bay area!

Can anyone out there confirm or deny?!

it's here, check out rebirth - like i was saying, 2 303's, an 808 and
a 909 in one software package...

you can also get soundcards for your computer, and not just a dinky
ol' soundblaster.  i've got a couple of digidesign soundboards in my
mac, one's a high end digital recorder/editor, the other a 32-voice
sampler with loadsa cheap ram on it.  or you can get boards like
roland's sound canvas, and i think also korg and yamaha and a few
others make synthesisers you can plug right into a slot on your
computer.

the only thing i'd want outboard would be a phat analog synth,
preferably midi-able.  that technology is bulky by nature, too bulky
to fit in your computer...

Happy sunday all

I got this flyer for a party in sacramento
last night and thought it was so funny...
in a sad sort of way.

The first thing you see, because it is in the biggest font
on the flyer is:

	"FIRST 50 LADIES-$4.00"  "Lets Keep it Real"

Do you think we could get 50 guys to show up in drag?
 Or maybe just let
darwinism run its coarse...since this group sounds like
they are about to go the way of the dino.

Happy holidaze

Well, I made the choice, with no money last night me and my friends
decided to head to revival and hope for the best.
Though the process of getting there was a trip in and of itself when we
got there (very early, we were desperate for music) there were only 10 or
so people.  The location was great, reminded me of the Minna location from
happy kids (June).  There was plenty of room and rooms with cool
decorations and a smallish but sweet sound system.

The music was great from right off.  And I started to get excited.
However, by 12, or 1230 my hopes for the party started to waver
dramatically.  There was maybe 65-90 people if that and everyone was kind
of shocked at the lack of energy.  But we all tried, really hard to create
that vibe we have all become addicted to.

The saving grace, and the most important thing is that the dj's were
beautiful.  There were definately waves to the party, with Joey's set
starting them off.  His was definatley rocking, and his scratching
skills killed me!  Pistachio's set(s) kicked ass.  And you could see that
despite the lack of people the dj's loved thier music and loved to spin,
and it showed.  If there was any lack of enthusiasm on thier part it
certianly (SP) didn't translate over the tables.

I have never been to a party that desolate, but though I noticed, of
course, and missed the people incredibly, every one there was trying thier
hardest.  The people that I saw on the dance floor just knew good music
when they heard it and enjoyed the experience of seeing them spin.  During
the night a thought occured to me, this(revival) is what it could have
been like when raving first started to appear, a couple of people who
heard some damn good music and just had to dance, it wasn't a given that
there would be lots of parties every weekend they were before the
standard, set the standard and gave us the scene we have today, and for
every successful rave there is thier are plenty that don't such is life.

Though I will always have mixed feelings about that party, it has helped
me appreciate the vibe alot more, taught me what I really want in a party
and music, and I will think of it with a sm:)e!



See you at harmony!

 in a sad sort of way.
 
 The first thing you see, because it is in the biggest font
 on the flyer is:
 
 	"FIRST 50 LADIES-$4.00"  "Lets Keep it Real"
 
 Do you think we could get 50 guys to show up in drag?
  Or maybe just let
 darwinism run its coarse...since this group sounds like
 they are about to go the way of the dino.

 The rekkids Dan was spinning were actually really good. He just wasn't
hitting them on the correct time sequence like he usually does. You can
make alot of dead-beat rekkids sound phat if you just mix um right. He
was on the three hour stretch, perhaps he was just tired. Who knows
where he was spinning Friday night before he got to Nikita.

Hmmm..
 The Edge.

That's where I pretty much grew up..
 Next time your their. Goto Brian, the bartender up top. He really
appreciates tips. He always puts any extra beers I get for friends, on the
house.
 The place IS jam packed full of snobs.. But the management is alright.
 I remember one night there when it was way to packed. I was walking
through the place and this lady gently pushes me and says, "hey! what the
f$#k is your problem dumb ass? Why don't you watch the f@#k where your
going" I decide to stop, turn around and say, "hey! what boat did you just
come off biotch? This is a CLUB, people tend to bump into one another" Then
while I am walking off, her tall dark and retarded boyfriend comes up
behind me, politely taps me on the shoulder to say, "you know..I don't like
the fact you call me girl friend a bitch" I look back at him and realize,
going to the restroom is more importiant then knocking sence in to him. He
taps me on the shoulder again, but before he could say anything security
comes over and asks me if there is a problem. I didn't even have time to
say "no problem" before bimbo's boy friend butts in and trys to speak.
 Security goes, "hey! I was asking Jeff, not you" and security then pulls
them both outside to talk. Never saw them again.


 Hmmm.. Probably a year later, at probably my third or fourth ravE. I am
walking around alone in search of whatevah, at a WAY to crouded ravE inside
the Oak50 building. Just walking along with minimal bodily contact
involved. This guy yells out at me. "Hey! What does this fudcing look like?
A fncking walk way??" So I stop, look at him and say, "fudc yea!! WooHoo!
This whole ravE looks like the yellow frickin brick road to me brother! I
go where I please..."
 I see the same Mr Attitude guy about fifty ravEs later.. I walk past him
inside the Home Base hallway, he is talking to two teenage girls. Once I
pass by him he says, "yea that's right, you best not turn around asshole."
So I turn around, laugh at him, and keep walking.. I then hear him saying
something like, "aw man! I told you! err!"

 I liked that guy. He was comedy.

Woh..
 They got a 909 included in the software now?

Hmmm..
 You can kind of make a 909 sound with a 303 & the new PCF effect.


But I think the 909 is coming soon. But please correct me if I am wrong!

Hey folx, I just came to inform all the HH fans that there is a party in
SacraTomato on the 26th where you can get your 4-beat fix.  And there's
plenty stuff for the junglists too:

_SubSonic Underground's One Year Anniversary_
December 26th, 1997
(916) 484-4040
$10 before midnight

Featuring some talented out-of-towners:
-Golgo 13 (LA)--jungle
-Phunckateck (Noel & UFO) on 4 turn-tables (SF)--mo jungle
-Simon Apex (UK) & The Mind Controller (LA) on 4 tables--happy hardcore!!!

Plus the locals:
-RE (Sac)--a 6 hour live "drum n' bass" set
-DJ Rockit (Sac):  oldskool breakbeat set
-Dre (Sac):  jungle.
MCs for the night:  Lem (Sac) & Simon Apex (UK)

Time Out for Honesty:  I have a feeling this event is going to be at a
certain lil joint which shall remain unnamed, but I will say that if it is,
I _hate_ this location.  It's an OK club but a very poor space for
raves/parties.  Plus it will be cold as hell in the outside "room."  If it
does end up being there, I think that will be a drawback, but I firmly
believe the music will make up for that (it has before).

Let us show you how the capital rocks . . . ;-)  It'd be nice for people to
come out and support diversity en la musica here, since Sac parties are
usually strictly house.  If you come, look for the chica negra w/ the short
short hair & the sfraves laminate and say hello.

Happy Holidays!  Cheers to all of us who survived finals!

xoxo--Miccaela

Subject: Obligatory 1997 Review
Sender: sfraves-owner@hyperreal.org
Precedence: bulk

The traditional, obligatory, opinionated, arbitrary end-of-the-year
review . . .

While 1997 certainly wasn't the worst of years for dance music, it didn't
light any fires for me.  Maybe it would have been more exciting if the
dire predictions many (including me) made about the "electronica" boom had
actually come to pass.  Electronica now seems to be about every kind of
electronic pop music *except* traditional house, techno, bass and jungle,
at least in the eyes of the Music Industry and the millions of ears they
control.  Basically, electronica has been defined as the kind of music that
people sit down and listen to, or else consume as an audience.

I had a moment of enlightenment this year at a show at the venerable old
Kaiser Auditorium in Oakland.  For starters, The Orb performed a great
warmup set that was mostly lost on a crowd who had no conception of who these
upstarts were.  In between acts, we had the spectacle of a DJ playing an
almost unrecognizable "Fools Gold" amped into a muddy, rumbling roar, later
to be joined by a guitarist wearing shiny metallic pants and playing pointless
solo lines along with the vinyl.  Finally, during the main act, the crowd
rushed the stage just like in a regular rock concert when the MTV rotation
hit comes up.  Except this time it was when the Chems did "Setting Sun."
This was my moment of Zen-electronica realization.  We have entered into a
new era of unknown dimensions.


House.  Production values have improved enormously, but at the cost of
emotional impact.  It also must be admitted that after nearly 15 years,
it's hard to find new melodic or instrumental ideas, though it never
fails to amaze me how many new ones do get on record.  But house is now
sectored into stand-pat categories fitting the economic configuration of
the club world.  Thus, we hear of "peak hour tracks" and "6 am tracks"
and tracks designed for particular types of clubs.  What's next - "works
well with the Nike crowd, but a bit dodgy with the Adidas"?  House seems
to be considered a purely commercial musical style now, and that's a shame.

Techno.  The widest speciation of styles seems to have occurred here,
and the distance between them only gets greater.  Trance and hardcore
go on and on, but for the life of me I haven't heard new ideas there
for years.  On the more abstract side, Detroit is already starting to
move on and it's been two years since the last Basic Channel record,
but the new BC and Jeff Mills soundalike mixes keep showing up every
single week.  On the plus side, the most ferment of all is occurring
under the surface, whether it's "tech house" or some of the other
noteworthy experiments out there.  Most interestingly, a new group of
live techno performers is starting to emerge.

Jungle.  A year of splintering, with numerous subgenres emerging and
the essential cross-fertilization of styles disappearing almost entirely.
I suppose they call this progress.  On the other hand, the lack of
good new sonic ideas in a genre highly dependent on rapid innovation
is starting to show.

Speed Garage.  This is what happens when a music industry desperate for
something to hype blows up a nice little scene with a bit of gumption
but no particular grand new idea.  It was predictable that garage vocals
and drum&bass rhythm sections would meet, but it took concerted pushing
by the PR apparatus to turn it into a national frenzy, as it sort of
is in the UK.

The Scene.  The clubbing and "rave" scenes are like they were, except
moreso.  More fashion-conscious, more drug-oriented, more commercial,
more separate from each other -- more everything except music-aware.
However, there is a real underground still out there in the making, though
it has the added burden of fending off the accumulated weight of 15 years
of behavioral patterns.


The disappointing feeling of 1997 is that it was really the first year
in a long time where it felt like we were marking time instead of making
history.  The records are better produced and the covers have more gloss
than ever before, there are videos galore and some notice in the trade and
general circulation press, but no real excitement.

The good news is that there is a whole new generation of record makers
out there who are stalled behind the effort to commercialize yesterday
and today's leading lights.  And the Internet may yet prove to be the
next field for the evolution of electronic dance music in ways that are
only dimly perceived now.

So don't pay too much attention to the jaded old bystanders like yrs
truly.  As much as we like to recall how it was back in the day, we keep
moving forward because it's the only direction we know.


Stuff I Liked In 1997


First Hour
----------

BLAKDOCTOR - I Believe So Strong (Moonshine)
  All Doc Martin needed was the right production partner: Mark Blakkat Bell

D'LAREG - Better Way/Don't Wanna Come Down (Simply Soul)
  Another of the many hidden gems of Detroit house

JAN DRIVER - Arp Impression (Solid State of House)
  Read the Funky Manual

DUBTRIBE SOUND SYSTEM - We Used to Dance (Imperial Dub)
  My social calendar circa 1992

GLENN UNDERGROUND - 70's Trip (Cajual)
  I've been caning this for *months* and it never gets stale

MARSHALL JEFFERSON - Move Your Body, Adonis remixes (Trax)
  Takes measure of the classic and honors it completely with a modern sound

OCTAVE ONE - The Living Key (430 West)
  Fluid, deep, essential

DJ RASOUL - Themes for a Rainy Day (Subwoofer)
  Gee's tracks have always been good, these are great

SPANK SPANK - Your Inspiration (Nite Grooves)
  The real Pierre+Spanky deal

SUPERNATURE - Comin On (Shindig)
  Big build up, big crescendo, delivers like an anthem should


Second Hour
-----------

ASTRAL MATRIX - 6 (OOBE)
  AndyJ's Detroit-influenced excursion really works

CHIBA - Time Flies (Lightning)
  Sunscreem builds a stunner from their own sample

DJ DEEON - Boody Mover (Dance Mania)
  What track better summarizes driving around on Friday night?

DENEUVE - Never Give Up (Telepathic)
  People think Fred Gianelli is an "up and comer" -- hello, pay attention!

DETROIT ELECTRO ORCHESTRA - 1977 EP (Hydraulic)
  Bass still in ya face, and don't ya forget it

JAYDEE - You Got It (Danza)
  Yeah, it's a remix of you-know-what, and you know what? it kicks hard

KORSAKOV - Deep in Space (Muller)
  Goes well beyond the cliches of modern dub

THE MARTIAN - Red Planet 8 (Red Planet)
  A message that needs no words

MCP 21 - Leaving Town (Analog)
  Proves that you can still do effective things with an A-line

TEKNOTIKA - When the Planets Align (Eye Q)
  Words fail me, as usual, when Gary Martin is on his game


The above reflect my preferences as a *dance* DJ, and are not intended
to slight the other excellent releases that came out in 1997.  In particular,
there were a slew of really good albums, including Larry Heard, Kenny Larkin,
John Beltran, Kenny Dixon Jnr, Stacey Pullen, Dan Curtin, Mark Farina's
remix CD of Dubtribe, and on and on.  Maybe it says something that so
many talented musicians and producers are focusing more on album projects
than trying to break dance singles in an overcrowded, fad-driven series of
pigeonholed markets.

I originally wasn't going to hop on the band wagon with this, but it 
being 2:30am I decided what the hell!

Name= Ivan

What is your Age= 21

Birthday= 9/1/76

What is your Sign= Virgo 

Are you Married= Nope

Have Kids= Thankfully no

Are you Single= Yes, just got out of one of those "it was too long 
relationships" and want to stay single for a while!

Do you Dj= Um, Nope

What is your most listened to Style of Music? = It changes week to week, 
seems to cycle from Jungle to Trance to Classical to a little House to 
anything that seems to groove at the time, hey and if I can find 'em 
those CDs that have the music from cool video games, in other words 
anything and everything that touches my soul.

Musician / Artist= Well I have been creative at times, I think everyone 
is an artist in there own way, life would be so boring w/o the simple 
little works of art(visual, auditory, or language, etc) from somebody 
you least expected it from.

Hobbies= dodging trucks that are in front of me at 70-80 MPH on 101(long 
story), teaching myself and others new things about computers 
(languages, programs, I either take a class or teach myself and then try 
to teach others who want to learn) , reading, doing silly things(try it, 
just do something absolutely silly, it's good for bringing a smile to 
your face), anything that makes me smile and have those funny goose 
bumps run up my back, Learning about massage(I am way out of practice 
though), touch if done with care and good intentions has a wonderful 
healing effect!

Favorite Sexual Position=Undecided, um, it's also NYOB!

Ideal Party Line up= Dan, my buddy Marco (w/o allergies[anybody who 
knows Marco/Vivid knows what I'm talking about]), Mars, and this cool 
trip hop DJ that spun at the harmony 3 year who I can't remember the 
name of.

Favorite Food= A pesto and artichoke heart pizza (I have only had this 
made perfectly once, and I don't remember who it was that made it)

Favorite DJ= No fave at this time, if you feel you have reached this 
recording in error, please check the number, and try again later.

Do you represent the Scene Negatively or Positively?= Positively when 
possible

How?= Depends on my frame of mind, I try to do my best to bring a 
positive mood to those around me. Sometimes when I take breaks from the 
scene I don't represent it at all.

Do you go to parties to hear the music or hook up with the opposite sex? 
= been there, done that, bought the t-shirt! I go to hear good grooves, 
in a social environment.

sent with hopes of happy holidays,
-idw

hey everyone,
	I think either sunday the 28th or monday the 29th will be a good
night for the party/whatever we want to call it.  The only thing that
might be a little bad is the size of my apartment; it's not the biggest.
If anyone else wanted to suggest a spot that was larger, that'd be cool.
But I am cool having it at my place, it's not that small, it's just not
that big.  Please email me back so we can finalize the date.  Have a great
day everyone!
			Ken

Hi guys.

Well, after moving for over 16 hours I decided to head out to the
gathering at 1:00am... :) I got there with my buddy Jeff at about 1:30am
and proceded to the HOUSE room. Lets see.... then I went to the chill room
for a bit and ran into Rodrigo and his special lady. Chilled with them for
a bit discussing all the lovely things that we must share with one another
while melting in the chill room. ;) It was nice to chat with this
wonderful cupple and absorb their good vibes. 

The I started to journy around the spot and ran into various other
earthlings and Sfravers (we're earthlings too... I think.. :) ) such as
Baby Huey (grooving to Honey-B), Mr. 2 (whatup brutha?), FOOLISH FISH
(finally get to meet you.... ), ummm.... that's about all that I can
remember this fine monday morning.... (ssoooorrry)

It was a beautiful party with a fantastic vibe and setup. I'm so glad they
made the space seem smaller and more intimate by making corridors...
instead of leaving that BIG, WIDE, unused space open for people having bad
trips to feel even less happy... Martin thought of those kids and went the
distance to avoid past bad experiences by other promoters using this spot.
(From the people I've talked to, most people used to hate this spot).

Overall the music was dynamo.... Dan was spinning house.... then came
Tony... and then I caught the end of Mark Farina....    what a line up.
Thanks be to the power that placed me in this awesome party area.....
called the Bay Area.

Have a good week....

Okay,
I'm  sitting here at my brother's lovely new home in Wichita, Kansas,
and listening to Logical Progression (disc b).  Now, Wichita is a lovely
town (by lovely, of course, I mean midwestern, boring, flat, mall-infested,
and musically clueless), but as I sit here I am dieing for some good
grooves  on NYE.  I  want trance, d&b,  ambient, techno all nitE long.
I want I want I want.  I'll go  to Oakland.  I'll go to Sac.  I'll go
to Monterrey.  Hell, I'll even go to Marin <g>.

Sorry, I just had to vent there.

But if anyone can help . . .  The Toontown et.al. looks promising.

ppEEaaccEE  all

Steve.

POP'S NEXT BIG THING

What in the World Happened to Techno?
1997 was supposed to be the year that electronic dance music saved
the foundering record industry. It didn't turn out that way. But the
genre's pulse is still beating.

By ROBERT HILBURN


    The fortunes of techno music rose and fell as sharply as the
stock market during much of 1997: sky-high early in the
year, when the music was widely tabbed as the Next Big Thing, to a
virtual fire sale these days, when you can find only two pure techno
collections on the list of the year's 200 best-selling albums.
    It's a rise and fall that tells us as much about the workings of the

record industry--and the difficulty of predicting public response--as
it does about the commercial potential of techno itself.
    At the start of the year, there wasn't any reason to think of
techno as a major sales force--until the industry's search for
something to jump-start sluggish sales led, unexpectedly, to techno's
door.
    Expectations quickly soared after MTV, looking to boost its
own sagging ratings, announced that it was going to move away
from its reliance on alternative rock and rap videos because viewer
surveys showed fans were tiring of the styles. Those sounds, along
with country music, have been the backbone of the industry in the
'90s, generating almost $8.5 billion in sales in 1996 alone.
    Though MTV said it was also going to add more pop videos to
its programming, the industry zeroed in on the fact that the cable
channel introduced "Amp," a weekly video show devoted to
techno--or electronica, as the dance music is also called--to its
lineup.
    Even though "Amp" was placed in the ungodly 2 a.m. Saturday
time slot, the industry picked up on techno. The idea of more pop
videos on MTV--from the novelty of the Spice Girls to the polite
musings of Jewel--seemed too mainstream and old- fashioned for
an industry that likes to think of itself as cutting-edge.
    Besides, techno had an energy and imagination, a style far more
sophisticated and diverse than old-fashioned disco. And the music
had become the dominant sound on the British club scene, where a
group of new acts was bringing personality to what had long been a
faceless genre. Stars such as Prodigy, the Chemical Brothers and
Goldie were profiled alongside traditional rock groups in the British
pop papers. Some, notably Prodigy, even brought a sense of song
structure to the music, thanks to such tunes as "Firestarter," a hit
around the world.
    Aware of all this, record execs in the U.S. started having
daydreams of MTV's new "Amp" doing for techno what "Yo! MTV
Raps" had done earlier for rap: open the sound to the mainstream
rock audience.
    By spring, however, in a Calendar report about the potential of
techno, executives were having serious second thoughts about the
millions they were pouring into signing and promoting techno acts
here and in England.
    Despite the sometimes seductive lure of techno, there was an
anonymity in the whiplash beats and silky, ambient sounds that
made it a hard sell on record. Songs are the key to building careers,
executives reminded themselves, and most techno doesn't have
songs in the traditional pop sense.
    Still, the industry took notice in April when the Chemical
Brothers' "Dig Your Own Hole" became the first album from the
hard-core English dance field to enter the U.S. pop charts in the
Top 20. The album, which registered at No. 14, sold 48,000
copies in that first week, and it went on to be certified gold
(500,000 sales).
    But the future of the Chemical Brothers appears limited. On
stage, the group was unable to overcome the anonymous sound of
the music. The show was about as exciting as a crew of sidewalk
construction workers.
    That shifted attention to Prodigy, which made history in July by
entering the U.S. charts at No. 1, selling 201,000 copies of its "The
Fat of the Land" album, according to SoundScan. The album has
gone on to sell more than 1.5 million, making it one of the year's
Top 30 sellers.
    Unlike the Chemical Brothers, Prodigy proved to be a knockout
live--but in ways that didn't necessarily augur well for the
commercial future of techno.
    Prodigy is as much a rock band--in terms of attitude and
approach--as it is a techno band. You see a lot of the Sex Pistols'
Johnny Rotten in the wardrobe and sneer of frontman Keith Flint,
and you hear a lot of the independence and rebellion of the Who
and other classic rock groups in such songs as "Firestarter."
    The success of Prodigy ultimately reinforced the idea that
techno's future in the commercial mainstream is as an influence, not
as a dominant style.
    In that way, techno's place in pop history may be similar to the
role of punk. Despite such great groups as the Sex Pistols and the
Clash in the '70s and early '80s, punk was never a major, consistent
seller around the world. But punk's youthful fervor and
do-it-yourself spirit inspired virtually every rock band of note over
the last two decades, from U2 and R.E.M. to Nirvana and Pearl
Jam.
    Prodigy and the Chemical Brothers didn't start a stampede to
techno. Garth Brooks' "Sevens" album probably sold more in three
weeks in the U.S. (2 million copies) than all the techno albums
released here during 1997 combined, except for those two groups.
    And MTV's "Amp" remains in its 2 a.m. Saturday slot.
    An incident that gives evidence of the low standing of techno's
stock these days came when Goldie opened for Jane's Addiction at
the Universal Amphitheatre earlier this month. It was the perfect
setting for this star of the British dance scene to showcase his sound
before a young, tastemaker audience.
    After two numbers, the energy level was so low in the room that
Goldie moved to the edge of the stage and tried to peer out into the
darkness. "Los Angeles, are you out there?" he finally asked.
The truth was Los Angeles--or at least 90% of the 6,000 fans
who came to see Jane's Addiction--wasn't out there. They were
either out in the lobby or sightseeing along CityWalk. They hadn't
even bothered to see Goldie. And many of those who were in their
seats at the start of the show left after a couple of numbers.
    So what are we to make of techno?
    Ironically, the commercial fizzle this year may be the best thing
that could have happened to it. If the Chemical Brothers and
Prodigy tours had prompted fans to rush to the stores in search of
other techno albums, record companies would have started signing
acts with even greater gusto. This would have brought all sorts of
opportunists into the music, contributing to recycled and repetitive
sounds.
    But the fact that techno didn't explode commercially means that
only artists with a genuine love of the music will likely gravitate
toward it. The opportunists will form more ska bands--the most
successful but least interesting trend of the year.
    The one bright spot in all the success of ska and novelty records
this year is that a flock of sing-along hits, including Chumbawamba's
"Tubthumping" and Smash Mouth's "Walking on the Sun," caught
the ear of a preteen crowd, easing fears that today's youngsters
might be so enamored of video games that they would never care
about records. The best sight of the year, one retailer said, was
parents being pulled into stores by grade-schoolers.
    If "Tubthumping" and the rest can get the kids listening to music,
they'll eventually graduate to more substantial fare. And those
sounds seem to be arriving from England, where there has been a
revitalization of British rock, thanks to a new generation of artists.
Oasis' Noel Gallagher, the Verve's Richard Ashcroft, Blur's Damon
Albarn and Radiohead's Thom Yorke, among others, understand
the importance of songwriting and don't shy away from mass
acceptance.
    "The future of pop lies with songwriters," Gallagher said in an
interview this year. "It doesn't matter which style or whether they're
playing guitar, piano or the world's biggest synthesizer. A great song
is a great song."
    In the end, the problem this year wasn't techno, but the
expectations put on it. Think of hard-core techno as a great
resource library. At its best, techno is smart, exciting, even
revolutionary music. There will be collections of it that will
occasionally connect with mainstream audiences the same way
some of the Clash's albums did during the first era of punk. But the
primary audience is likely to remain a subculture.
    Eventually, however, a great young songwriter will likely be
excited by it the same way U2's Bono and Nirvana's Kurt Cobain
were excited by punk. Then, we can start talking about the Next
Big Thing in earnest.
                                              - - -

hi megan,

to me, my post was not censorship  (how could it be? i have no authority to
screen what gets posted on sfraves, i'm just a member with the same rights
and limitations as everyone else)....

my post was, rather, like saying "excuse me, but is this really the place
to say this? have you considered that this is likely to offend many of the
people to whom you sent this message?"

that's about respect to me, and i do think that someone has to speak up
when people cross what seem to be the lines of appropriateness...  i'd say
the same thing in person if i felt someone had crossed bounds and made
others uncomfortable without their permission ...

i'm not requesting censorship, i'm requesting that people remember that
this list has all kinds of people, and we're not all into the same things,
and some things can be predicted to be offensive.  racist, sexist and
explicitly sexual topics among them.  and to me, these things don't belong
on sfraves.

so, whatever it is you think i am (pregnant?), i'm not.  and i don't think
that thinking before you speak, is censorship, i think it's respect ....

i do worry that sometimes, in the desire to protect free speech, we lose
sight of respectful behavior... just because a person has a right to say
something doesn't mean that it's the right thing to say.

I agree that martins crew did a really good job on this place. Ive been
there several times but it seemed like a completely different place.
It really showed me how much a difference the producer can make on 
the quality of a party. I think alot of promoters just dont understand
how important the decor and enviorment is and how much they are
responsible for it.

I would like to see that place turned into a big permanent rave
site. We could install permannet stores/ booths for things like
music, art, clothing info and various other rave related
industies to pay for it. Maybe set up some
 rides and art galleries...sort of like a permanent little
 rave city. 24 hour music 7 days a week
with big parties every weekend. Restuarants and cafes?
 Maybe we can even get an old 
space shuttle and set it up for people to play on. I'll check 
the military surplus web site and see if they got an extra one they 
want to get rid of.

happy holidaze

Hi Leslie, the following is my opinion and nothing
more. I mean no dis-respect.

all >into the same things,

Exactly! Honestly Leslie, it is the request of 
censorship. Think about what your saying, you say
that there are "all kinds of people, and we're not
all into the same things!" If you said, "Hey I think
this is
slop and this is why." That would be an opinion. The
second you say "you should" or "you shouldn't" post
this because, its becoming more than an opinion. If
you read your post it leans towards that. 


> and some things can be predicted to be offensive. 
>racist, sexist and
> explicitly sexual topics among them.  and to me, 

The key words here are "to me" so you really shouldn't
suggest, what should or should not be included in posts
just state that this is how you feel. I know this is
just an opinion as well but it sounded a lot like you
were telling us not to post this stuff. A lot of people
thought that the post in question was funny. I
personally don't care. I do care that we have the right
to write whatever the fuck we want. That doesn't mean
I won't get flamed into oblivion. But I live in this
country for that specific right. Freedom of Speech

>these things don't belong
> on sfraves.

Says who? I think if its marked NRR you decide if it
belongs in your mailbox with the tap of a delete
button. Nobody is twisting your arm to read a
particular post. Is it your place to say what belongs
on sfraves and what doesn't? I mean come on now.

 
> so, whatever it is you think i am (pregnant?), i'm
>not.  and i don't think
> that thinking before you speak, is censorship, i
>think it's respect ....

This has nothing to do with respect. This is an open
forum if someone doesn't like what you write, the
intelligent folks on this list will let you know 
promtly 8) If I want to put a joke up I should mark
it correctly, (which wasn't done here I know) and
if you don't like it tell me so. But don't tell me
not to post it.

The amendments to the Constitution were created for
this purpose. You have to give everyone the right to
state what THEY FEEL is right. Your right, just
because someone has something to say, does not mean
that it's the right thing to do, but what each
person perceives to be right, may not be what you
perceive to right. There are some down right evil
things that people write supporting bigotry, sexism,
and a number of other things. I don't let them in my
life. But its my right to choose whether or not I want
them there and I am damn grateful for that.

This statement is contradictory. You are requesting that people not post
certain messages on S.F. Raves. You have decided what is and is not 
appropriate to the list and are requesting people not post things
that meet your personal criteria of inappropriate.   

The question I ask myself when I see people questioning the
"appropriateness" of a post is "Who does it hurt?"  Not who does it
*offend*. 

Racist and sexist posts clearly fall under the definition of being
hurtful, or having the ability to be so. However, when I see a post like 
the one in question, I can't think of anyone it might prove *hurtful* to. 
Offensive to some perhaps.

I worry that in the rush to be non-offensive to everyone that the world
will become a very, very dull place to be.

I think what is really in question here is how do we run this listing and
have a little fun here without pissing someone off?  We can't...that is a
fact of life in any situation.  I learned a long time ago that, in a
professional setting, you don't make jokes about sex, sexism, racism, or
religion.  but this is not work or a professional setting (for most of us)
we are here to feed our desires (techno related of course).  We are all
out to have fun and some of these jokes are fun for the majority of us.
The only thing we can do now is label the subject corectly and stop all
this preaching, I think this horse is sufficiently dead.

Reason #1 to believe brian could actually make this happen:

Setting:  a small party on a big roof.  It's five am, and our gracious
host is taking his turn on the tables.  He throws in a video about alien
abductions, hosted by Scotty - and two cds, one of which is spoken
word.   This dj matches the cds to the hundreth *and* includes the
soundtrack from the movie.  AND it WORKS - there are three individual
tracks which match the video images and the ghestalt is unbelieveable.

He's just f*cking around.  It's five am, and he has been celebrating
with friends, dancing and trancing to  insect vs. virus, ethan miller,
joe rice and jon santos

<pause for orgasmic response to the caliber of artists>

There's this woman lying on a big pillow, entranced.  She tells the dj
"my g*d, do you realize how many variables you have going?  And you're
not really maxing out, are you?  You're not actually challenged by this,
are you?"

And he says 'well, i didn't really have a lot of time to think about
this, and i'm using a lot of new cds'.

now *that's* multimedia.
*that's* Brian Behlendorf

Hey Troy...you posted an article from LA Times that gladdened my heart...

-* snippetty snip *_

~~     Despite the sometimes seductive lure of techno, there was an
~~ anonymity in the whiplash beats and silky, ambient sounds that
~~ made it a hard sell on record. Songs are the key to building careers,
~~ executives reminded themselves, and most techno doesn't have
~~ songs in the traditional pop sense.

Hum... this is interesting...its almost as if "mainstream" America needs that
"Cult of Personality" behind music. Its almost as if the music itself doesn't 
stand alone without some ego up on a stage being a "rock star". People either
want to be worshipped, or to have someone to worship instead of just getting
into the music for its own sake.

~~     Still, the industry took notice in April when the Chemical
~~ Brothers' "Dig Your Own Hole" became the first album from the
~~ hard-core English dance field to enter the U.S. pop charts in the
~~ Top 20. The album, which registered at No. 14, sold 48,000
~~ copies in that first week, and it went on to be certified gold
~~ (500,000 sales).
~~     But the future of the Chemical Brothers appears limited. On
~~ stage, the group was unable to overcome the anonymous sound of
~~ the music. The show was about as exciting as a crew of sidewalk
~~ construction workers.

They all want a show, the razzamattaz.

~~     But the fact that techno didn't explode commercially means that
~~ only artists with a genuine love of the music will likely gravitate
~~ toward it. 

Ahmen to that.

~~     In the end, the problem this year wasn't techno, but the
~~ expectations put on it. Think of hard-core techno as a great
~~ resource library. At its best, techno is smart, exciting, even
~~ revolutionary music. There will be collections of it that will
~~ occasionally connect with mainstream audiences the same way
~~ some of the Clash's albums did during the first era of punk. But the
~~ primary audience is likely to remain a subculture.

Yay!

~~     Eventually, however, a great young songwriter will likely be
~~ excited by it the same way U2's Bono and Nirvana's Kurt Cobain
~~ were excited by punk. Then, we can start talking about the Next
~~ Big Thing in earnest.

In my opinion the Cult of Personality is a BIG (excuse the french) WANK. I"m
glad that we are moving away from it. It should be all about the music.

There's an event coming up on January 9th (i think) in Santa Rosa (which
sucks cuz i'm going away that weekend) ....

but before then, i hope everyone's getting their advance tix for BEautiful
People next Saturday night... all the Harmony crew is really excited about
this party, the location is great, the size should be just right, and
there's kickass music scheduled.  including Bonnie (Maiz).

Greg posted where to get your presale tix on Friday, (F8, Trance & Jungle,
HArmonics and Solid Grooves) .... so get them now so we know you'll be
there to party with us!

We're so looking forward to it, and hope to see you all there... and
remember, the most beautiful people wear costumes!

love, leslie

Subject: VSF: Case closed.
Sender: sfraves-owner@hyperreal.org
Precedence: bulk

This saga ended around 11 am today.

Anyway all the parties got together, and my case and other cases, were
brought to VSF for discussion.  My allegations were supposedly brought
before the manager by P (not the owner) of VSF (I thought he was going to
have a meeting with the  owner, but I guess I was mistaken).  The manager
indicated that it was the bar that had me ejected.  Funny, the only
bartender who was waiting on me was off his face.  Anyway that's their
story.  No more drinkie, no more dancing, time to go.  I still cannot
reconcile this with what the security told me , the stories didn't jibe.
Anyway there is no proof of any overt action, and even if there were it was
it has probalby been handled now.  Or so I am told.  All of this was told
to me so I guess that's the conclusion of the parties, not me, the other
parties.  Still a vague story.  I could put some convoluted pice together
and that would be as plausible as anything else, since no story so far has
been corroborated.

So I'll accept it , after all what else can I do: :)
-I wrote the owner a letter
-I did research into violations

And there we're none, no violations.  That's that, and although I disagree
with it, I'll accept it.

I do take some small satifaction at being told the following:
-Some security was "no longer needed" and let go from VSF (I guess the
stories of their ever agressive behaviour may have gotten the best of them).
-VSF security will be more cool in the future.

Now all of this I cannot corroborate, since I wasn't there.  I guess the
proof will be in the pudding, by other people's positive experiences, or
whenever I decide to go back to VSF again.  That, I assure you, will not
happen anytime in the foreseeable future.

Well this took alot of time, and I'm looking forward to putting this thing
behind me.  It was fun, and I learned quite a bit, about how things work
especially the strong business dynamic in all equations.

Anyway P invited me back to his club and closed this drama out.

Peace,
Happy New Year,
Happy Hanukka,
Merry XMas,
John

Yeah, if I'm spinning somewhere that Lara's going to be at, I make sure 
to wear Polo Sport stuff instead of Adidas. :D

No this is not true. We are planning Beautiful People for this Saturday Dec
27th, and our next schedualed party will be Freaky People pn Friday the
13th of February, 1998. Hope this clears things up.

Hiya folks

Ok, so I finally downloaded the client...so is all I have to do is to 
connect to the IRC and then type /join #sfraves ??? I tried it this 
morning but I figured no-one would be on at 4 in the morning so I'll try 
it again tommorow. If I'm not doing something, or doing something wrong 
could someone please let me know...

Thanks
-Matt-

I wonder if any one ever leaves santa green brownies
 or cookies with E .

I have heard rumors of this
and that santa tends to leave
extra presents at those homes.

Well all..

I'm finally going to be going to my first Rave (Fanfare!), Harmony's
Beautiful People.  I'll be wearing probably, odd for a Rave (I guess,
never been to one so not sure), probably a decent chunk of black, and my
lil anime style SF Raves Laminate.  I'll also be handing out a big bag
full o' weirdo little toys n' stuff, so if you want one, and/or wanna meet
me, come by and say: HEY! Gimme a toy! Or..uh..you can ask nice for one
too, nevermind that I'll probably give you one either way. :)  Don't
forget to get a hug while you're at it.

If you further want to be able to identify me, check out my page:

http://haze.netgate.net

There's a picture of me on it. :)

Season's Peace to everyone still around.
If you're a jungle lover (and that goes beyond being animalistic between
the sheets) and can't figure out what to do for the second night of Hannuka
and don't feel like singing carols, then come to the TOP for VINYL
TREATMENT, you know it, BUGGIN' OUT, it happens every wednesday at the Top,
and this week DJ PUSH, ABSTRACT & NOEL will be providing the beats with
help from the vocal stylings of MC PHLUID.  It is 21up with a $3 donation,
but I promise, none of yore money is ever taken for granted. For a
by-product, the cost of that 'black crack' sure does add up!

Come and say hi to me! I'll be working the water bar after midnite.
(I hope everyone on the list will come up and introduce themselves!!!)
This will be my first party since the awesome 4x4 in August - the week 
after that I broke my leg and have been out of action since. BP will be 
my official return to the scene!

Look out for me - sfr laminates, harmony t-shirt, and probably the only 
raver there trying to dance with a cane!

Hey there!

Me again! I'm like the only one posting today. :)  Anyone know where I can
get glow in the dark rings and those rings with the little lights in them
that flash every so often?  I tried Paramount here in the South bay, not
sure where else to look. (Btw, yes, I live in the South Bay, so it would
be perfered that the stores recommended also be in  the South Bay.)

Thanks!

Haze

Ok, This is the rumor *I* heard.  The Canabis Buyers Club? 5 Floors?
TRANCE TRANCE  TRANCE?  Would that be the same party your speaking of?
I believe you can contact f8 in SF and for SantaCruz Peeps like myself,
Koininea is gonna have  the bottom floor, check out the Ion Exchange
downtown for tix. ;)

It failed to meet the flash-gimick factor required for success in the comemrcial "McDonalds Music" scene, and so returned to the underground where it can flourish and grow steadily & healthily, rather than being subjected to a forced steroid injection by the music "executives", only to die a sad death a few years later when the next "big thing" hits..

"Personality".. Hah !  Personality is for the average man in the street who listens to his music with two wooden ears and is too musically deaf to hear personailty in the _music_.  They need an "image" wrapped around it.  So that it's not about the music as such, but about the person who wrote it, and their marketability and fashion.   Keep the superstar phenomenon to yourself please.

Techno music is about the people on the _Dance floor_, NOT about the people on the stage..  It is for YOU to enjoy yourself and dance YOUR dance to.  Not for you to blindly worship some superstar prancing about on show..

>anonymity in the whiplash beats and silky, ambient sounds that

Exactly.. which is the good thing about it.  "Building Careers" can be translated into "Marketing for Money", which has nothing to do with MUSIC.  The mainstream music "Industry" is about _making money_.  Which has nothing to do with producing good music.

>    Prodigy is as much a rock band--in terms of attitude and
>approach--as it is a techno band. You see a lot of the Sex Pistols'
>Johnny Rotten in the wardrobe and sneer of frontman Keith Flint,

Exactly why most techno enthusiasts (myself included) do not class the prodigy as a techno group anymore.  They have obviously decided that money is more important to them than their music..  fine by me.. everybody needs money I suppose..  but I find it sad that they would stoop to following the pop formula of building an image with attitude, on stage gimicks and other razzamatazz just so they can make it in the mainstream music world.  Their choice..  I hope they find satisfaction when they have their millions of $$, and have forgotten why they started writing music in the first place..

Exactly what I said in a message sometime ago.  In an industry that thrives on 5-minute sensations, if you really want your music to survive the test of time, the answer is NOT a sudden explosion in popularity.  Sit back, enjoy your quality tunes, and watch as the mainstream culture goes through one-hit-wonder after another..

>But the fact that techno didn't explode commercially means that only 
>artists with a genuine love of the music will likely gravitate toward it.

Cool..  We'll have the _artists_ please.. the pop culture can have the wanna-be superstars with little talent all to themselves.

For 5 minutes until the next great song comes out.  and says exactly the same thing that the song before the last great song did.  As someone else recently said..  99% of all "great songs" are "Baby I want your love", "I'm so pissed about <X>", "Everything is great", or one of a very limited number of repeating themes said over and over again.   There is infinitely more variety in MUSIC and emotional expression, which the real artists can express themselves with.

<Phew.. we survived being "Pop"ularized, now we can go back to grooving away and enjoying ourselves..  See you on the dance floor !?

i would like to leave sfraves on a truly happy note.  lately i have
realized that most of the things i have to say should be saved for
some other lists or just to myself.  i would like to thank my friends
for their love, friendship, supports, and of course hugs mmmm...  and
in addition i would like to thank everyone else for sharing thoughts
with me.  i hope in some ways i have brought smiles to your days.  i'm
proud of the fact that i have not posted anything negative to sfraves
or to anybody, and the fact that everything i have written thus far
are straight from this crazy heart of mine.

i have learned so much and met so many people from sfraves in just a
little over the past 4 months.  incredible.  i would stay on longer
but i don't have the time, and besides, i'm not an email guy, although
contradictorily i program for a living.  that is my lunacy, what's
yours?  although the dancing and hugging have improved in my own mind,
the reading and more importantly the sports that i used to do are
lacking.  i i'm t'tired of in stutter telling the kids at the courts
that i have a career ending knee surgery hehhehh..

i guess this is it.  we'll be in touch.  see you all under the smiling
sun.

merry christmas & hugs, 
hai

Oh yah. The ego is hard to deal with for all of us and gets us all into trouble
now and then. And I guess wanking is okay, just that maybe you should do it in
private. Althought some folks do like to do it in public, and thats okay too if
you are into that sort of thing. ;-)

Basically, I won't make the effort if the person is stupid.  I hate stupidity.
In the crowd I run with, the people who do the most drugs are the dumbest.
They have lost all there brain cells to something or another.  And trying to
get with a guy who has no brain is like destroying the chance to be with
someone who is actually worth it.  I have come to the conclusion, after this
weekend, that any boy who does drugs, to the certain extent of being high
almost every waking moment and being a bitch when he's not, is not worth my
precious time.  I would rather sit at home and pick my nose than be with one
of those.  Boys like that are reserved for friendship only.

 > Likewise, 
 > if someone tries to get to know you, without the 'cheese' lines, and you 
 > turn them down, why do you do so? Be brutally honest.

Anyone who says looks don't play a major part in the getting to know someone
process is pretty naive.  All you know as well as I that when you first see
someone, you are taken by their looks, whether it be postitively ar
negatively.  Generally if a guy picks up on me, with or without the cheese
lines I turn them down.  This is because I choose not to date, for the most
part.  When I do, I realize what a big mistake I have made and retreat into my
own happy world of not having to deal with the fragility and stress of a "love
relationship."  I have had guys try to give me their numbers, my reply to them
is... "honestly, I wouldn't use it."  I chose their friendship if they are
genuine towards me, and in this process, if we get to know each other
everything is good.  If they are not sincere in their attempts then they will
not even try to know me as a friend.

the variety of reasons are for the variety of people.

I think it's less irritating to be ignored than it is to be constantly
harassed.
I mean, if other people aren't hitting on you, you can always go hit on
them.
*grinning* But, it seems like the people I would want to be with, would
never
hit on me in the first place....it all depends though.

 I don't turn people down who want to get to know me as far as being
my friend. I will basically be friends with anyone, but I try to avoid
people
who are fake, and try to pretend to be something they are not, as well
as those who are excessively negative. (however, i rarely run into
excessively negative people at raves.......but i have run into some fake
ones.)

I also try and avoid people who just want to date me/sleep with me and
aren't into being friends. If I get that vibe off anyone, I tend to run as
fast as possible.
if people hit on me in a blatant way, i am usually flattered and not
offended.
but if they pressure me into hanging out with them, it often scares me.

I disagree with whoever posted that physical appearance is important. Well,
I suppose to an extent..but it's more the way they present themself. You
could
be not necessarily the most physically blessed person....but if you are
beautiful
inside, it totally shows through like a light....while if a person is way
fly but
there's nothing within......they won't be attractive at all.

for all of you wondering why you're the only one on #sfraves ..
you're probably on UNDERNET..
therea re a few different networks.

#sfraves is on EFnet.
you gotta go to a server on EFnet to get to the SFR channel.
type /server irc.psinet.net or something, i don't know many EFnet servers
i'm an undernet chile' myself.
so if you find yourself on UNDERNET accidentially, do a /whois sk3
or /join #rave
and i just might be on :)
hehehe

Hello all!  There's a few things going on this weekend, even though
a lot of you are probably out of town.  The Harmony party on Saturday
should be pretty cool.  Mostly though, I think people are getting
ready for New Year's.  There's a bunch of listings already, and there
are a few more parties if you ask around...  Next week's calendar
will probably be sent out next Tuesday, the day before New Year's Eve.

Hmmm...I got this rating:

Nice, but several naughty marks. Was very good yesterday, so it's nice to
add another mark in the nice column. Needs to pick up toys better, and help
keep things neat at home

I was just setting here contemplating
that it is 1:20 and how that relates to sfraves and everything.

Just noticed how much christmas trees and ravers look alike.
You know...all the decorations and things

And if you set your tree on top of your speaker
it will even shake and dance like a human.

OH WAIT...1:20 has nothing to do with raving...that is 4:20.
sorry for the confusion...just ignor this post and
have a happy holidaze.

Well, that is a good question... Our scene is changing, as are we (the
crew)... For me personally, my time is very valuable, and I don't really
want to throw parties that might get busted (like ones in S.F.) It is a
real downer to have to go home early. Not to mention that it is hella
dangerous from some people to have to leave early. So I (as well as the
rest of the Harmony Crew) am focusing on doing parties that don't get
busted. That is why we are doing this party in Oakland with permits (they
are so expensive), and consequentially that is why this party costs $20
instead of $15 or even $10. Next summer we will be doing some free outdoors
events, as well as stuff up in Santa Rosa (Sonoma County). I really hope
that you guys all support us with this whole $20 party thing. It really
sucks that we have to charge that much, but that is the reality of the rave
scene now. But we are planning to have a "Freaky People" party on Friday
Feb. 13th, and Friday March 13th. of next year. After that, who knows? I do
know that we are going to plan a weekend campout for our anniversary party.
That will be summertime. But we will still be trowing parties and putting
our energy into keeping this scene alive. See ya in the future!

Peace and love,

Greg = )

I have to completely dissagree with that one.....I am going to go this party
even though I can barely afford it....but if you think that this is what the
scene has to be than that is pretty pathetic!!!!!!!!!! Why you guys feel the
need to follow the scene is beyond any reason I'll ever
understand....$$$$$$$$$$.....I really think it's a shame you had to make that

Here's the thing...Any time I try to record, one table comes out of both speakers
and the other comes out of only one.  The live speakers are fine, it only shows up
on the tape.  I have asked around and have tried jiggling cords, cleaning needle
contacts, etc.  Any other ideas?
Thanks!

i'd say merry xmas but i believe in them all, so i don't want to write a
large paragrpah and leave one of them out, say for instance what the little
green peruvians from the south side of the Martian South Pole believe in.

so, ah, who's going to what for new years?  all i know is, stay away from
EBF cause cleanup's still "in progress",,, so's it gonna be Pacific, Ltd.
or one of those other  biggies?  i think im gonna stay in my cave this year
and make some muzik.  i dunno.  lara, what's going on?  take me to a
party?!  show me the way.  i think there's something special going on but
im not supposed to say.  right?  isn't that how the underground works?
blabbermouths?

well anyway, to all, merry xmas, and remember,,,

MCDONALDS IS CLOSED ON CHRISTMAS!!!

love, dEEp

	More or less.  : ) : ) : )

	Just make sure you're connected to EFnet.  I think the default
server designated by mIRC is some Random Dalnet server, so make sure you
pick an EFnet server.  : ) : )  Otherwise sounds like you're doing fine.

silly x-mas poem I wrote because my bro woke me up at 6am (at least it 
wasn't 4am, like in the previous years):

Some people have christmas dears,
some have christmas beers,
and still others have christmas fears, 
but all of us have christmas years,
unless of course of you don't celebreate christmas,
but you most likely then have chrismas celebrating peers.
Anyway, here's a wish that you have several joyful chrismas years
and may it bring all of your family, adopted and biological, nears!! 

Hey, a merry x-mas, happy hanukkah, a joyful winter holiday season, and 
a wonderous fun New Year to all you SFravers out there!!!

Speaking of 4:20, there's a New Years party (like we didn't know that) by 4:20 productions. I've never been to a 4:20 party before. Do they kick ass or would I be happier somewhere else?

Okay, after dabbling in the world of propmotions for a while, I feel that 
I can talk on this subject a little.  There are a lot (and I mean *a 
lot*) or people out there trying as hard as they possibly can to bilk as 
much money as they possibly can out of The Scene.  And this is everybody 
from space owners/managers who at the last minute (literally) will up 
their prices by $2000 to the folks downtown who want five different 
permits that all cost $500 each, lighting folks who won't work for less 
than a grand, sound systems that cost a couple of grand, and then DJs 
that expect to receive anywhere from $200 - $1000 for spinning and hours 
worth of records.

It all starts addidng up really really quick when you do a "big" party.

I'm not saying it's right, but it happenes and it happens really easily.  
It's no hard to put together a "big-name" DJ lineup or to get a hold of 3 
argon lasers or to get a million watts of sounds... the hard part is 
getting all those people the money that they're expecting to receive.

For me, though, I'd rather be at a small, fun party. :)

Happy Holidays!!!

it's a permited party... with so many undergrounds getting popped....
it's the one of the few things left to do.  would you rather pay $10-$15
for a party with the possibility of the party getting busted at
midnight... so you just paid $10-$15 for an hour or two of partying, or
pay $20 (not $25 or $30 mind ya =) ) and know that you'll be able to
party all night and if you do drugs, you don't have to worry about
having to drive around until your sober. just in recent days people have
gotten huge fines and some arrests have been made, not to party goers,
but to the people involved with throwing the party.

you've gotta look at this from all sides.... not just from the party
goers perspective.

peace.jer - @spire

I think you have taken a big leap by construing things out of my post that
I did not say. I was in no way condeming or casting aspersions on Greg or
Harmony for his choice to provide his customers a safe, permitted party.
However, IMO permits and $20 admissions(within reason) have traditionally
been the mark of a massive. And although the name would indicate
otherwise, "massive" does not always refer to size, at least to me.

In defense of sound people...I think they are highly *under* rated.  When
you rent sound, don't forget that you are not only renting a sound system,
worth lots of money probably, you are *hiring* a person to come watch the
system all night.  Even at $30/hour that's about $300 for one party.
$30/hour for a sound tech is pretty cheap too.  Usually the sound is also
deliverd and picked up.  

I'm a dj...but imho it's the djs' that tend to raise the price of larger
parties...gimme a break someone charging $1500 for 2 hours of spinning,
that's a joke.

I would just like to say that there is a huge difference between a
massive and a crap party. We are not going to mention names here, but we
all know that there are massives which we hate or do not like. And there
are some that always seem to bring a good vibe, such as: SF House
Collective, Choice, and Tribal Funk, as well as others. There are all
those massives that hardly ever have a good vibe. We know which ones
those are. I think the same goes for undergrounds. I have been to a few
undergrounds that were sorta shitty with bad vibes. People need to
remember that it's not whether it is a massive or underground, it's
wether its gonna be a good vibe party with good music and good people.

Love,
Paul*E*Wog

I had never read this poem before, but when I started to just now it made me start to 
cry.  Not like misty eyes, but real tears-it's so sad.  I would never purposly try to 
hurt my Mom or Dad although I know that I have before. 

 This poem is so sad, it does seem that the good die first.

They're not just being paid to spin; they're being paid for their draw.
When it comes to fees, a DJ's ability to bring in people is at least as
important as their skills on the turntables.

Let's do the math....2 hours of spinning plus 2000 hours of practise, maybe $1,000 
a year on records, plus a slew of free shows, being ripped off by some promoters the 
list go's on.  A DJ charging 80$ might make .07 to 13 cents an hour while that 1500$ DJ
might make from $2 to $15 an hour.

Dont forget the value one could place on the vibe that DJ creates. When a DJ transports 
you out of your body into some aural nirvana are you thinking "how much money does this 
guy deserve?

I do suppose i was a little out of line by coming down on greg like that...we
did discuss things privately over e-mail and it was just a misunderstanding on
my part.....I love Harmony parties...it was 4x4 that completely brought a
group of me and 6 other friends of mine together forever......so  I must
apologize if anyone was offended by my comment.....Ironically enough I will
not be able to go to this party anyways because I am sitting here with a
temperature of 103.....so I am a bit delerious and very upset that I cannot
go....so I hope that all of you have a wonderful time at Beautiful
People.....I will be sitting here thinking of all of you guys....and then I
will probably start crying or something because I really wanted to go....oh
well be safe and have a gr8 time for me.....bye...

Happily my last event of 97 turned out to be one of the best of late. 

Started out shakey as I anticipated obstacles to overcome:

1. Lamer than normal crowd at Nikita due to Christmas holiday
2. Most of my friends out of town/too poor from xmas to cough up $15
3. I'm not big on trance,
4 I had yawned my way through a Sasha set once before, (overseas a couple of
years ago -it seemed 2 of the 3 hrs were beat-less breakdowns that only served
to accentuate aching feet and overall physical ickiness -luckily Carl Cox
followed and I was feeling no pain - only music that MADE me dance, like a
voodoo doll or something)

For various reasons I had always missed Sasha here in SF, but always heard
after the fact how amazing he is. Given my personal experience, I couldn't
understand all the fuss. But I figured I'd give it another shot, especially
after reading somewhere that he had cooled it with the 30 minute "epic"
breakdown non-music segments.

WOW! The only thing I can really say is now I get it. It's still not my
absolute favorite music, or even my favorite style of mixing, but that guy
certainly is tops at what he is doing. He defined the word "effortless".
There were a few short breakdowns towards the beginning of the set, but not
enough to really throw off the pace or distract your dancing rhythm. The rest
of the set was dance dance dance!  Some familiar old tunes, mostly fresh ones.
Crowd was pretty responsive and excited, and not too bad for a commercial-y
club like Nikita, at Christmas holiday no less.Sasha kept a good eye on the
crowd and even was dancing/jumping around a bit himself.  There were a few
times he'd build and build and build, pause just long enough, then just SLAM
an amazing finish, using the EQ to really accentuate the bass where before
there had seemed none, or vice versa. 
As usual, the visual crew was unparalleled. The lasers (colors and patterns)
seem to be changed frequently so as not to get boring, and the lights, giant
balloons and netting (and fog, but not too much) make for amazing sights to
complement the music.
In closing I'll just add none of the above observations were chemically
enhanced - it all stood up in its own right. (Although I think I might have
had a bit of a contact high vibing off most of the crowd!!)
Not that he needs any more, but Sasha gained another fan Friday.
What did anyone else think? How did it compare to his previous visits here?
Or at Twilo?   Keep dancing in 98!    JD   :)

Hello all...

I've been dieing to see SASHA for quite some time and let me tell you that
I had a really good time. I always like his style and had a really good
time. His set was clean, smooth and creamy... I found myself dancing all
over the place and smiling a lot. He is definately one of the best DJs
I've ever heard. THe best I can remember....  fantastic...  very UK... a
lot of build-ups (which I like)... which allow you to chill for a few and
then blow up again... it was beautiful. Sent me hovering high above and
into the heaves... the sweet sounds...  

when you listen to a DJ you can't always be too technical... because music
is pure emotion... spend less time analysing and more time absorbing...
very nice.. Thanks 'Sasha 

another deep space transmission from... ..  .

I was there. The last time I heard 'The Man Like Sasha' was in '92. He was
playing all the rave/house hits of the day(Bomb the Bass, M17, Melissa Morgan,
Nush), he wasnt mixing very well and there was this MC on top of him saying
stuff like, "Nice and easy lemon squeezy!"

I got to Nikita and it was packed. I still dont know why people complain about
the crowd. I was totally expecting older people in suits and martinis in hand,
judging from everyone's descriptions in the past. But it wasnt. I don't care
what any die hard raver says, the folks who go to Nikita are real. You know
why? 'Cuz they go to the club, get on the dancefloor, and dance their asses
off. They dont worry about who's got what laminate on, what anyone is wearing
or anything superficial like that. They're there to get down. I wish I could
play to a crowd like that! 

Now, what I found most fascinating about the night was the music. Not that it
was unusual or anything; Sasha was playing straight-up hard trance. He was
behaving as what I identify as a typical english DJ would(Not much movement
behind the decks, not a lot of personal connection to the crowd, and seemingly
not much desire to). What I found interesting though was WHO was there,
listening to this music. There were folks there who I'm friends with who
would'nt be caught dead in a club playing this kind of music under any other
circumstances. I mean, some of the long-time Wicked crew- 'proper house'-crowd
was in full effect, going nuts to this guy's tracks. But if 'The Man Like'
would have taken a bathroom break and Jon Carel or Ethan would've gotten in
there and started playing, The music would've been similar, if not better. But
do you see any of those folks at FnF or Gateway jams? No, you don't.
Interesting.

In any event, I'm glad I got to check it all out.

No, that's just what they want you to think. In reality, they are lurking,

everyone is down at the embarcadero because
they are having A Boston Tea party.

They are giving away free buds as a protest to the 
recent government harashment of medical marijuana clubs.

So everyone is getting their free buds and are probably just
too stoned to figure out how to turn on the computer.

So you're saying that a dj that might pull down upwards of $6000k a month
(only 4 gigs) and at that point is getting remix deals and probably
setting up a studio, also gets a lot of *free* promos from labels, and
doens't need to practice 2000 hours because they'be been dj'ing for 5
years now is only going to make $2- $15 hour ???  I think you need to
check your math and your variables again.

Don't forget the value of how the sound sounds?  What good is a great dj
set if it sucks because the sound system suck my ass?

Dj's should get props...I don't have a problem with dj's getting a couple
hundred an hour...but I know of dj's that won't spin for less than $1000

You make a very good point Michael. However, anyone worried about paying
DJ's for their "draw" is most likely running a business, and is not
just throwing parties for friends...

I hope they shut down the CBC forever and Dennis Perone ends up in jail
for a good long time. He and CBC proponents lied to Californians using the
gravely ill as a pawn and a front for distribution of marijuana to anyone. 

Dennis Perone for Governor? I vote for Dennis Perone for inmate #98398398.

Damn people, if you want pot legalized, legalize it for it's own sake. And
most of all, choose more deserving "heroes."

  Melissa...the people were very beautiful!  I would just like to say
that the Harmony Crew deserves MAD PROPS for throwing this part*E*,
even if it was a $20 one.  The location was wonderfully decorated, (a
bit overcrowded at times), but the paitings, lights, and strobes
(those REALLY blew my mind or some reason) were simply amazing.  The
Dj's were phat, with Brian and Brad spinning the most amazing set I
have ever heard on a 2X4..I couldn't even move during their set i was
so entranced in the music...jsut sat right in front of the left front
speaker and enjoyed feeling their shamanistic beats pulsate through my
body. Lots and Lots of people were their, it seemed as if you coulnd't
go for more than 30 seconds without seeing someone you knew.  To
everyone that was there..I thank you for such a totally awesome
experience.  For those of you that weren't...we'll see you at teh next
part*E*!  

Many Many HugZ, MUCH LuV, and sm:)es to all the Beautiful People!

I'm so glad there's others who notice the huge gap in effort, quality, money,
between sound and everything else.  Why is it Bay Area promoters (clubs,
massives, UG whatever) seem to spend at twice as much on printing three
different versions of  fliers than on a soundsystem, to the detriment of the
event/night etc. Why is this, when almost all DJs at all levels aren't shy to
tell anyone  (and many ravers, clubbers. party-goers agree)- that <<the SOUND
is THE most crucial element to a good party>>.

 I've had more potentially great nights become only mediocre ones because of
poor sound quality or equipment set up etc, and I don't even know anything
about it, other than when I can hear my neighbors conversation better than the
music, or when all you hear is a fuzzy jumble that maked you keep checking if
you're still wearing your hat (and earplugs!).

Had to add my 2 cnts because its one of my favorite subjects to gripe

Alright then, nice opinion.  Sir, let me breifly state that marijuana is the
best herbal pain reliever we have found, no additives.  It helps in releaving
pain of all sorts and was even used by the queen of england in the 1800's.
Until approx 1930, marijuana was used legally as a pain reliever.  It is one
of the earliest forms of pain relief, documented over 5000 years ago by the
chinese.  The reason marijuana was used less frequently as a pain reliever
comes from the invention of hypodermic needles.  Drugs, such as morphine,
could be disolved into a liquid and injected into the body, giving a quicker
form of pain relief.  Also, in the 30's some stupid fuck (Henry Anslinger of
the federal bureau of narcotics) decided to make pot illegal.  He started anti
marijuana propaganda that said people became crazy when smoking the herb, with
homocidal tendencies and the like, from this statement, such movies like
reefer madness were made.
    Marijuana has been proven an effective pein reliever for those suffering
from glaucoma, cancer and AIDS.  It alleviates the pain, but it also helps
people to eat (you know, MUNCHIES)

woops, I wasn't done yet, uh, where was I?  That's all I can think of right
now.  But all y'all remember, when you get that doller bill that's got george
washington sayin "I grew hemp" just think, damn, that is true!!  Hemp was one
of the major cash crops in the united states up til the time WWII ended.

So forgive my typos, forgive my mispellings, but excuse me.  Marijuana should
be legalized, for more than one reason.

Hi rave friends,

        It's true, I'm addicted... I can't stay away from this list even
though it takes way too much of my time to engage properly!  So after being
off a good part of this year, I'm back... and naturally I'm prepared to
spout off once again!  8)
        As always, I love to see people debating questions like this,
especially when it is done civilly and respectfully.  I think that such
discussions can only help us clarify our values, and when we know what our
values are, we can conciously act in accordance with them, which is,
frankly, a much better way to live.

        The question of how much money DJs should make isn't an isolated
question, but part of a dilemma this scene and other alternative scenes
have long struggled with:  How to preserve our subcultural identity in the
face of the larger culture.
        I believe it comes down to the fact that most of us seem to have a
couple different values which come into conflict when confronted with
issues of money.
        On one hand, we tend to value creativity and freedom.  We believe
that if an artist creates something, the artist has an absolute right to
reap the rewards of his/her creation, and we are not prepared to limit
these rewards by curtailing our own consumption of the desired products.
        On the other hand, we also tend to believe that there is something
fundamentally wrong with having the dollar-chase be a priority in one's
life, especially if the dollars are garnered from the rave community.
        How can these beliefs be reconciled?  Not easily, that's for sure!
But that doesn't mean whatever someone decides to do is okay...
        If I were a DJ getting offers of $1500 for 2 hours of spinning, I
hope that I would make it my practice to go by the intention of the
promoters I play for in setting my prices.  In other words, for someone
throwing a commercial event with the obvious intention of making a lot of
money, or for someone looking to enhance their image by having a lot of
big-name acts, I would charge what the market will bear.  But I would also
be sure to play friendly, humble, non-commercial events for little or
nothing, knowing that the vitality of the scene depends heavily upon the
vibe created by promoters not seeking money or power.
        Top DJs who play exclusively or nearly exclusively for large,
commercial events should not be considered part of the rave scene, in my
opinion.  Because they are there to draw audience, these DJs receive big
billing which makes them celebrities.  To borrow an old slogan, I think it
is easier for a camel to fit through the eye of a needle than for a
celebrity to be a raver.  The culture of raves and the culture of
performer-centered entertainment do not mix, in my opinion.
        It's hard to maintain the idea that everyone is a star when 4 or 5
people have their names splashed across a flyer and are making hundreds of
dollars an hour when everyone else is paying $20 to get in.
        This producer-consumer/entertainer-entertained dynamic works well
in many industries, and clearly it can work for dance parties too.  But
we've seen how beautiful rave culture can be when it's love-based, not
profit-driven or ego-driven, so why settle for less?  I wanna take it
higher!  8)  Th-th-th-that's all folks...

May the bass be with us,
                                        <<< Starchild >>>

Dear Melissa,

        One person I would be remiss not to mention was a lovely
blue-winged Tooth Fairy who came up out of the blue and handed me a
quarter!  Her wand with a big stuffed tooth on the end was not to be
missed!
        Other than that, I will echo the praise for the decorations... they
were beautiful, and the Harmony crew obviously put in a lot of work on
them.
        For those concerned about the cost of the party, let me note for
the record that at least one uniformed police officer was present, despite
the fact that Harmony had their own security and there was no disturbance
of any kind that I'm aware of (in fact Greg thanked everyone remaining at
the end of the night for how trouble-free the event was).
        Can you say "government extortion"?

May the bass be with us (and may the cops leave us the *%$# alone),

It is all to true what Doreen said about promoters throwing $20 
parties!! If people will pay they will throw them, simple logic!

I don't think $20 is too much to pay for a GOOD party, if you concider 
the fact that you get a GOOD 6 - 8 hour dose of GOOD music & good 
visuals, granted you may spend more on things to alter or enhance your 
party experience, but that is not what a promoter has agreed to provide 
you with, they have there expences, and when I go to a massive and spend 
my hard earned $20 I expect to hear good beats and see cool things up in 
the air and on the walls

Essentialy massive raves are much different from the small UG style 
parties, but you can control if you go or not, but how often is a sound 
system that much better at a massive when compared to the sound sys at 
small parties.

I used to go to Funky Techno Tribe events up in sac which cost $25 at 
the door, and I felt it was well worth it, because there was good music, 
good people (the ones that I met or knew already), and good vibes. On 
the other hand I went (foolishly) to Planet New Year last new year (same 
cost) and felt I got no where near the same or equal value for my money. 
End result I will never attend another cool world party unless there is 
some drastic change in the vibe there parties present(um not likely).

The rave/party scene/culture/society is yours to shape ,promote ,destroy 
,enhance ,create ,put down ,and change to what you see fit. I know 
several people that don't agree with Hamony's way of doing things, so 
they don't attend harmony parties anymore, I haven't been to a hamony 
event since 4x4 which granted I had an okay time at but I'm still 
willing to go to ther events because of the wonderful time I had at the 
spring massive. I feel that people should not stand by and let this 
scene go in a direction they don't want it going in, remember that DJs, 
promoters, lighting people, and promotion groups are made up of people 
just like you and me, if you don't like what you are seeing happening to 
your scene do something, get involved, or a part of the scene you do 
like and try your best to preserve it. Perhaps one day you will be 
sitting, dialed in to netcom telling people why you and your crew are 
charging $20 or even $25 for the next party your throwing.

These groups are made up of people, but maybe not like "me and you."  Sorry,
but you have seen the attitude, as well as I that "I threw this party, yeah, I
am the man." and the "I'm the _DJ_" attitude as well.  
I don't stand by and watch.  Thank you very much but I am usually quite
involved in the parties I attend, except what I will call a "massive."  ANd no
I don't like waht is happening in the scene.  I am sick of all the kids
whining and complaining about the scene changing.  Well, news for all you,
CHANGE HAPPENS!!!  I am sick of the candy raving september children, too.  But
what can we do about that.  Really nothing, we were all disillusioned kids at
one point, I guess.
  Trust me though, if I had the funds, I would throw the parties, but I
DON"T!!! so oh well.  It takes money to make money.
Have a good day at work today, after all, it is monday.

Because it costs 2-3 times as much.
Big DJ A who normally commands $4-500 a spin damands $1,500-$2000 on
NYE.
Big band B who normally gets $4,000 a gig wants $10-$12,000 on NYE.
Sound company who usually wants $5-700 an evening wants $1,500-$2,500 on
NYE.
Anybody who works for you from cashier to sound tech wants 2-3 times as
much.
"Economy of scale."  I don't know which came first. The promoter
charging a ton more on NYE or the talent wanting a ton more but either
way it sucks.  I've done NYE parties for the last 4 years and every year
it gets worse and worse.  
-SUNNY
P.S. Oh yeah, try to increase the value of your party by getting your
DJs to play exclusively at you event = increase price by another 25%. 
Take a look at the line-ups for NYE.  Some DJs are playing at 3-4
events.

  BA is not saying that pot is a bad choice to use as medicine..he sees it 
as wrong to use medicine as an excuse to legalize pot..these are *2
seperate issues* which are wanting 1) the legalization of pot for only
medical use and wanting 2) the legalization of pot just to be able to get
high!!...CBC has mixed the issues and are now paying for it!
                         just my 2 cents-

Erm...duh. Tell me comrade, what's so bad about running a business? NEways
there's a whole shitload of gray area. I can think of only one promoter who
I would say is just in it for the money. There are many many promoters who
are out to make a well deserved buck, and support the scene they love.
Promoters put hours of work, hundreds (more likely thousands) of dollars on
the line every time they throw a rave. If they make a buck, fine they took
they risk, and did the work. That my friend is the entrepreneurial spirit
that makes America great, and gave us the Silicon Valley which begat the
good stuff that we're using to geek out right now.

PS why do people whinge about what DJs and promoters make, but not about
what drug dealers make?

Good morning, all!

I would like to thank every single amazing person who came out to Beautiful
People Saturday night... this party was ALL GOOD!!!  and that is because of
the people who were involved in creating it, and the people who came to
contribute their energy to everyone's good time!  you all rock!

Setup was so smooth and easy, it was like the space was welcoming us ...
and shortly before the doors opened, i went outside and saw the mellow and
wonderful people who were waiting to get in, and knew it was going to be a
special night.. and it was.

themselves.  We didn't have one incident requiring medical attention, and
Karma Patrol's corner had only one real guest, a girl who had a short bout
with the stomach flu.

It was never too crowded (except in the hall occasionally), and you could
go pretty much anywhere on the dance floor and have room to let yourself
dance freely.  It got hot in a few corners, but you could move near a door
and cool down quickly.  It did get a little smoky, but hey, maybe i'm
sensitive to that since i quit a month ago and still have those cravings!

All you crazy kids who dressed up looked so amazing, all bright and
sparking and smiling and happy, passing out your candy and toys (Haze, that
toy scorpion's going on my computer) ...

And i got to see so many many people who i love to see out.... for every
person who i missed because they were out of town for the holidays, there
was one who had moved away in the past year, but was back for the holidays
and came out to party with us...

I got to meet so many sfravers i hadn't before .... and was wishing i had
the money and energy to create a sfrave booth with a photo wall.... if we
had a polaroid camera, each sfraver could sort of "sign in" at the booth
when they came, and have their photo taken, and we could post it up with
their name on a wall.... so that everyone could see who was there, and know
exactly what to look for, wouldn't that be cool?  (anyone who has the
energy to do this, go for it!!!)

to echo what greg said in the morning (after that great group hug!), this
party showed how wonderful responsible raving can be, and we all hope that
this is a taste of what the next year of partying holds for us.

I know that lots of people think $20 is a lot for a party.... and while i
wish it didn't have to be that way, it's important to recognize that it is
more and more difficult to throw underground parties that don't get
busted... i partied for 2-1/2 years before i was at a party that got busted
(FnF last halloween)... and sadly, now i'm so used to it that i feel
grateful at little undergrounds when we make it until morning.

And that is why a permitted party was the priority for harmony.  Yes,
throwing legal parties is expensive, and it does mean we have to have
security and the police will be around.  But it also means that we can
dance and be together safely and securely, and i think that's worth a whole
lot more than the extra $5 or so.

There was a uniformed cop who strolled through the party a few times the
other night.... two different people told me that they were nervous about
him, and went up and asked him if he was going to shut us down... he said
"no, i'm being paid to be here."  and they asked him what he thought....
and he looked at the dance floor filled with happy people dancing under
words that said  things like "respect" and "self-esteem" and "friendship"
and the crazy harmony letters and banners and he said "it's pretty great"
....  and that's something he will take with him, as another level of
understanding about what raving can be about.

And a special thanks to the crew.  every single person on this crew kicked
butt, worked their ass off, and had a great time doing it!  you guys are
amazing!!  and this time my daughter worked with us too, and that was so
great for me.

So if I didn't get a chance to say it personally to all of you who were
there, thank you for coming and making Beautiful People a night to always
remember.  My favorite moment was dancing in front of Brian and Brad from
Moontribe on 2x4, they were spinning the sickest trance and loving the
people dancing in front of them, and Greg was actually *dancing* to my
left, all candied out in his freaky party clothes and crazy white knit hat,
and i looked around the room and realized i was surrounded by people i know
and love, and we were grooving together.  Yep, *that* is what it's all
about, and that is magic.

much love to everyone, thanks for being part of my life in 1997,

leslie

Nothing.  Businesses are all good.  A rave is not a business.

Raves are not concerts. One thing I love about parties is that
it's more of an interactive experience....if you pay a lot of money for an
event
it separates the "performers" from the "audience"...and I don't like that.

It makes it seem as though the djs and promoters are on a different "level"
than the people going to the party.

I feel that raves and money-making should be kept separate. Throwing a party
in my opinion should not be a business venture.

If you are at an event that you are throwing, and you are not having fun,
what's
the point? I think running around worrying about "losing money" is
lame....and
takes away from the party.

There are many many promoters who
>are out to make a well deserved buck, and support the scene they love.

I would say that if someone is out to make a buck, they might be supporting
the scene THEY love, but it is not the scene _I_ love.

>Promoters put hours of work, hundreds (more likely thousands) of dollars on
>the line every time they throw a rave.

It really shouldn't have to cost hundreds or thousands of dollars to throw a
party.
You can throw a perfectly fun, exciting and creative party for very cheap.

It's just easier to do things the standard way (lots of oversized, multi
colored flyers,
big name djs, standard visual people) etc. which of course is expensive.

If more promoters dared to do something out of the ordinary, they could save
a lot
of money and massives would be more exciting.

That my friend is the entrepreneurial spirit
>that makes America great, and gave us the Silicon Valley which begat the
>good stuff that we're using to geek out right now.

Pardon my french, but fuck that!

People wanting to make money is not what makes america great, and it is in
fact one of the things that causes me to be most ashamed of the U.S., that
so
many people will treat other living things poorly in order to make a buck.

For example, is using workers in third-world countries and paying them $4 a
day
or less like Nike a good example of the entrepreneurial spirit? After all,
Nike
sure profits from it....

>PS why do people whinge about what DJs and promoters make, but not about
>what drug dealers make?


Perhaps because drug dealers don't claim to be "supporting their scene" or
pass out flyers that say "Peace Love Unity Respect - only $30 each"

They don't get an attitude and walk around saying "Yeah, I sell <insert name
here>"
like that makes them better than the average person somehow.....

They don't expect to get in free to parties just because they sell
drugs.....or become
bellligerant (sp?) if they are forced to pay (i have seen that happen with
numerous
djs and promoters)

*giggling*

also, maybe the people who don't mind the amount drug dealers make
 are anarchists and like the idea that they are supporting
something illegal, whereas most massives are permitted and therefore
"bowing down to the man" so to speak?

and i also honestly feel that the average person selling drugs you see at a
party,
is not making anywhere near as much as the dj spinning records in front of
them....
or the massive promoter.

Well..what can i say???  this was one of the best parties that i have
been to in a long time.

Great decorations and TONS of beautiful people.  I was sober the whole
night, but got such a rush from all of the wonderful people there. 
This reminded me of why i rave and was reminiscent of some of the old
party's that i used to go to.  I like the fact that the spce wasn't
too crowded.  thank u!

The music was great too, brian and brad tore shit up...it was cool to
watch 2 dj's who were so in tune with each other.  And Maiz also tore
shit up in the second room, anyone who was in there can atest to this.
 and an honorable mention to urn, who laid down a nice hard house
groove in the morning.

Please, let's not degenerate into a pissing match. There is nothing wrong
with "running a business," as long as you are honest about it. I have said
this before and I will continue to say it: If you want to run a business,
run a business, but don't put a bunch of B.S. "we are trying to gather
people from all walks of life and you will experience a spirtual mindfuck"
when what you are trying do is make a living.

When was the last time someone went to prison for twenty years for
throwing a party?

Well what can I say? or where to start. 
This party was sooo goood. They had a nice oak
location with full on permits. Decor what be said
they were excellent as always it was like the harmony
of old not to crowded not to hot just right nice mix
of people. The music where to begin??? it was
excellent I am not sure if greg or who is in charge
of the lineups but it was a excellent blend through
out the night brian and brad rocked it. So did Mr.
Greg himself Nice to see a new kid of out from Santa
Rosa by the name of URN he was real good played a
nice blend of progressive hard house it is nice to
see good Jocks that don't play out that often it
keeps the scene fresh and alive. I could go on and on
about the party but I will not waste bandwith it was
a excellent party. The only bad thing is even with
all the nice stuff and nice vibe those kids barely
broke even if that. I have not heard the confirming
reports but I know that party budget had increased in
the final days before. It is sad that these kids
worked so hard put on a good party and they were not
able make a little money. I know it is about the vibe
love music etc.. but they should be able to reap a
reward for all the hard work. Good job guys 

Thanks,

 While I highly respect Patricks opinion I am in diasagreement here with 
him and would like to point out that he sounds a tiny bit bitter in his 
comments on Dennis Peron (this coming from someone who knows how to 
sound bitter).

 Pot is (IMO) an effective medication for some ills. Getting Pot to a 
legal status *despite the intentions involved* is a step foward for 
those who are suffering. Not only in the relief of a persons suffering 
but especially as it gives the individual power over their medication. 
The patient can grow their own rather than relying on huge corporations 
(who care only about the dollar, not someones health) to provide relief. 
And typically the corporations supply addictive and dangerous (when 
compared to Pot) drugs to ill people.

 Dennis did a lot of people a favor by writing 215 and the voters of 
California bear as much responsibility in it's passage as Dennis.



>.these are *2
>seperate issues* which are wanting 1) the legalization of pot for only
>medical use and wanting 2) the legalization of pot just to be able to 
get
>high!

 And what if a person *just wants to get high* (oh the horror). Is that 
so terrible? Particularly when it involves one of the safest drugs 
known??? And what if wanting to get high is a form of self-medication? I 
would rather be a mellow person from Pot smoking than from taking 
Prozac!



>...CBC has mixed the issues and are now paying for it!

 Not really. The order to stop selling Pot is not set in stone and even 
if does become so, Pot can still be distributed free of charge. It just 
can't be sold.

 A useful thing to remember is that we are all different. Some people 
seem to operate in this world better when they are stoned. Others seem 
to operate better when they are sober. Dennis has provided us not only 
with a choice, but has also opened up research on medical pot. I thank 
him for that.

I am not "bitter." I am pissed. Big difference.

Sorry, I don't buy Machavellian reasoning. The ends do not justify the
means. If you lie and misuse people in order to acheive what
otherwise might be a "noble" purpose, you lose all credibility and become
no better than the people that are lying and making false statements to
keep it illegal.

This is a totally seperate and distinct issue from what the CBC has been
doing, which is handing pot to people that have absolutely no medical need
for it.

Californians bear responsibility for being lied to? Sorry, I don't follow
your line of reasoning. 

What Dennis Perone did is put the whole movement for the legitimate use of
medical marijuana *at risk* through lying and misusing the ill as a front
for his own quasi-legal drug cartel.   

You have to understand that I have *0* problem with the use of marijuana,
for medicinal or for any other reason. What I object vehemently to is the 
misuse of the ill as a front. Ultimately, when it is found that this moron
has been distributing marijuana to anyone who wants it, the people that
stand to lose the most are those with a medical condition for which it
could prove useful. The people that 215 was obsentisbly supposed to help.

  I think the answer is "sort of." There's a Rabbit in the Moon record
called "Phases of an Out-of-Body Experience", which uses a piano riff from
"Precious Things" as one of its main themes. It's on Hardkiss, which is
based here in San Francisco. Some of the vocal snippets on the record
might be from Tori Amos too, but they might not. The piano sample isn't
acknowledged - she doesn't get credit - and the song is longer and more
complex than just a remix. I think it may be something that started as a
remix and then turned into something else.
  Kinda funny that you mentioned this - I just got back from Santa Fe,
where I spent Christmas with my family at a ranch house which my parents
are renting half of. One of my parents' housemates had the Urb compilation
CD, which has about 5 minutes of "Phases" under the title "O.B.E." Long
story short, I was listening to that song all week long. (I have the whole
thing, but it's on vinyl, and I don't have a record player any more.)

Yeah I'm sure you're all dying to know about the angst of being the only 30
yr. old at a 20 and under hard trance party that ended at 4:30am and cost $20
even tho' the voice mail said $12 and also said the party would be going off
to whenever...

OK I"m exagerrating the angst a bit, raving is not something to get all
angstedoutabout....and so I ended up at what else, the End Up and chatted with
the cute gay boys and danced happily to tranceyhouse until 10am and would've
stayed longer but I needed to see my little bird.

Folks I did have a gr*e*at time don't misunderstand, my first Experience since
the '80's!   And some of my best friends are 20yrs. old. Cheers y'all. Happy
Monday.  (as if.) 

LG

 And what if a person *just wants to get high* (oh the horror). Is that
so terrible? Particularly when it involves one of the safest drugs
known??? And what if wanting to get high is a form of self-medication? I
would rather be a mellow person from Pot smoking than from taking
Prozac!

>...CBC has mixed the issues and are now paying for it!

 Not really. The order to stop selling Pot is not set in stone and even
if does become so, Pot can still be distributed free of charge. It just
can't be sold.
=-=-=-
Oh boy something I can comment on!!!

pot is quite a complex battle (duh);

I know Dennis Peron & he is a great drug dealer but his efforts are now
backfiring a bit (but it still may work out)

he continually uses medicinal use as an excuse to legalize any pot
advancements he can (this may be good but time will tell)

he continually blurs the line between legalization whereas many (most?)
of the delivery groups have stayed within prop 215 for medicinal use
(Dennis has stated that ALL pot use is medicinal)

just a few tidbits of info

sister kitty

p.s. if alcohol were invented today as medicinal elixer in hundreds of
flavors it would never be legalized

 Hey wow. Happy frickin holidays. I am back. It's so hard to write the
people you wanna write e-mails when your so frickin popular like me. Jeez..
=]:... It's like time consuming. Like I need to get that really neet program
their advertizing on TV now, where you can just talk and your computer
types.. That's cool.. My computer would lock up trying to understand what I
am talking about..

 So my friends keep bugging me to go with them to ORIGIN. But.. Well... It's
a ravE. And I want to have fun on New Year's. Not listen to a bunch of kids
mock me all night.
 But that's not why I am writing. I just want to know.....Does anyone know
if they will be selling BEER!! What good is a New Year's party if you can't
have a glass of champaine atleast?

 Anyone know? That would be pretty stupid to say your party is a New Year's
celebration & not sell alchohol....
 Yep.. I know.. Beer sucks.. Let's all take E instead and be frickin happy
and pass out candy!!  =]:...

So anyone know?
 I would hate to waist 21bucks on a ticket & end up having to leave because
of no bruskies.

Anyone?
 Thanks.
Jeff

I dont know about polaroid but im getting a digital camera in a few
months...we could connect it to someones laptop and have that for 
people to put their pictures on. I suppose a hard copy on the wall
would compliment this nicely.

They could also leave messages or do live reports from the party
to sfraves and we can even set up a web page to upload pictures
or even live audio or video of all the partys that night.

If someone doesnt beat me to this you can look for this in the summer
as i plan on getting a new computer in feb when the huge cuts
are promised.

hello Davis

I want to thank everyone for coming last night we had a blast, it was
small and we had some setbacks.  I hope all went well for you Ken and once
school starts we will do something.  One thing I want to remind all of you
is "Schoolhouse Rock" a weekly beginning this Jan. at the Mansion Pub
featuring DJ's Jayson and Jericho "gettin' slutty on the wheels of steel".

Does the Tekno Tribe usually have a party/rave once a month?  I was up there
for Halloween Massive and I think someone told me that they have one every
month.  BTW, I live in Hawaii.  Peace...

 Hi rave friends...

        BlackAdder (Patrick) says the end -- re-legalizing marijuana --
doesn't justify the means of moving toward legalization under the auspices
of the Medical Marijuana Law, which some (not all) Californians voted for
on a narrower basis.

        But Patrick seems to feel that the ends DO justify the means when
the end is guaranteeing marijuana to the gravely ill who need it, by means
of cooperating with the drug warriors in restricting the access of everyone
else to this wonderful drug.

        While I have compassion for those who need pot for conditions like
cancer and AIDS, I also have compassion for the thousands if not millions
of people currently wasting their lives in jail because they sold or used
marijuana.

        Because the presence of marijuana for any use makes those who argue
that the plant has no value look ridiculous, medical marijuana patients
will have no secure guarantee of legal protection until the value of pot is
widely recognized, which means re-legalization.

        Therefore those of us who believe what you put into your body
should be your choice are ultimately in this together.  We must not allow
our movement to be divided by a short-sighted defense of marijuana on
narrow medical grounds, a position which is not sustainable.  We must not
abandon our brothers and sisters in jail out of fear of losing what we have
gained so far, which is merely a small step.

        I strongly encourage all ravers to stand up for the fundamental
human right to use any and all drugs, for whatever reason.  It's your
life... if you're not harming others shouldn't it be your choice?

May the bass be with us,
                                <<< Starchild >>>

thank you to harmony and greg for another great party... the location was
interesting, one big room, one small room, and a long hallway... what was
that place anyway? i have to say, at first having the police there made me
feel strange but as the night went on and i spoke with some of them and they
were friendly, i felt very safe... i guess this is the way it has to be if
you want to go the above-ground legal route. the decorations were up to the
usual harmony high standards, lots of lights and banners...

the DJs were great. li really brought my energy level up. but the
bomb-DJ-of-the-night award goes to moontribe team, brian and brad. they tore
it up for HOURS, i was constantly thinking, "i love this track" and then
"hey, wait, that sample isn't on it!" as they mixed EVERYTHING... i didn't
spend a lot of time in the small room, but the times i cruised through it
sounded good...

it was great to see so many of you that i haven't seen for so long... please
appreciate the beautiful scene you are a part of here! it is so rare to
find... only now do i realize how much i've missed it, and i can't wait to
see you all again on new years eve...
=)

Hi Peeps! : ))) 
I hope everyone is having a wonderful joyous celebratory holiday season
(would you like some wine with that cheese?).  Just got back from a very
relaxing time in Montana - beautiful, relaxing, clean, relaxing

did I say relaxing?

I NEED TO DANCE!

I have won tickets to Toontown and I am in a rather unsure situation - 

I missed out on Toontown of new year's past

Is Toontown of new year's present going to be anything similar?  Am I all
excited to go for no reason?  Is anyone going??????? I've heard so much
about this, but now I'm hearing no-thing about this. Starting to feel
apprehensive...

Good to be back, Cheers and love to all

Hi there,  just moved into town from Philly. Looks like I'll be staying for
a spell and I was wondering if there was any key node of trance info. Hard
hard spiraling trance is what I need this new years.. but I cant identify
yet which are trance djs/parties/spaces...any suggestions? This list has
been superhelpful already.

I just knew all the mean things they said on the east coast about the techno

Quoth kim:
>Nothing.  Businesses are all good.  A rave is not a business.

Kim, before I begin, let me say that I have always, and continue to have
the great admiration and respect for you. However, "A rave is not a
business."? That's well... silly. There is business going on throughout the
rave scene: rekkid stores, clothing stores, flyer designers, drug dealers,
glow stick sellers, all but perhaps 10% of promoters.

>Raves are not concerts. One thing I love about parties is that
>it's more of an interactive experience....if you pay a lot of money for an

>that.
>It makes it seem as though the djs and promoters are on a different "level"
>than the people going to the party.

Hmmm, I don't see the connection. This is just my experience but: I've spun
at massives where I was running out from behind the decks to hug people,
and met people after my set and gave them hugs and candy, and I've been to
free parties where I hung out behind the decks with all the cool people.

>I feel that raves and money-making should be kept separate. Throwing a party
>in my opinion should not be a business venture.

That may well be so, but the reality is that most raves are business ventures.

>If you are at an event that you are throwing, and you are not having fun,
>what's the point? I think running around worrying about "losing money" is
>lame....and takes away from the party.

Even a $5 UG has to worry about losing money.. The party may get busted
early, or only a few people show up, because the big party down the street
had all the right DJs. The rent still has to be paid. The sound system
still needs to be paid for, unless you happen to know someone with a phat
system, but that system would exist, because it works other shows for
money. Even free renegades run the risk of having the sound system
confiscated. Worrying about losing money sucks, but it's not gonna go away.

>I would say that if someone is out to make a buck, they might be supporting
>the scene THEY love, but it is not the scene _I_ love.

Then I guess that the scene you love is only a small fraction of the rave
scene. I like massives and UGs. I have not found that the size of the party
or the promoters motives are indicators of how good a party will be.

>It really shouldn't have to cost hundreds or thousands of dollars to throw a
>party.

It shouldn't have to, but it does. I have worked on $5 UGs with budgets in
the thousands.

>You can throw a perfectly fun, exciting and creative party for very cheap.

Yes, it can be done, but not for many more than 400 people. And if you keep
throwing phat parties for 400 people, more and more people will want to
come, and then you have to be selective about who gets tickets, and then
you get a rep for being all stuck up and elitist. (yes I've seen it happen.)

>People wanting to make money is not what makes america great, and it is in
>fact one of the things that causes me to be most ashamed of the U.S., that
>so many people will treat other living things poorly in order to make a buck.

There are ways to make money without fucking people over. Just because
nearly all large corporations are evil, doesn't make everyone who tries to
make a buck evil.

>For example, is using workers in third-world countries and paying them $4 a
>day or less like Nike a good example of the entrepreneurial spirit? After all,
>Nike sure profits from it....

Nike are not "a person who organizes and manages a business undertaking,
assuming the risk for the sake of the profit"(Webster's NewWorld
Dictionary) Nike are a big evil corporation from hell.

>They don't expect to get in free to parties just because they sell
>drugs.

Too true, although they sometimes try to pay in drugs. I had a hippy crack
dealer try to get in for a few balloons once. Fuck that! Tanks don't get
past this doorman.

>bellligerant (sp?) if they are forced to pay (i have seen that happen with
>numerous djs and promoters)
>*giggling*

Ha ha ha, no shit. That brings me back to sooooo many door shifts. It's
kinda fun telling them to sit down and shut up until the promoter gets back.

> whereas most massives are permitted and therefore
>"bowing down to the man" so to speak?

And as a result providing good value because they don't get busted.

Just wanted to say that anyone complaining about this party perhaps
didn't stay until the end...where there was a MASSIVE group hug, and
then we danced to a final song.  If ya missed that, then the kewl
decorations, awe inspiring set played but Brian and Brad, and smiling
faces weren't enough, then perhaps it is time to question your own
existence.  I am not trying to attack anyone here, and I hope I don't
offend anyone, but open your mind, and sometimes things jsut look a
little better!
HugZ, LuV, and most of all peace!

Yeah I feel funny about all that cute crap on flyers for massives, but I
could go either way on this issue. On one hand it's may not be genuine, and
on the other, it may be the only place that new ravers here about PLUR and
stuff. Sure it's marketing hype, but it's marketing hype with a good, and

ahh, but those are not raves...those are rave related businesses....

well, then i guess it's those 10% that i think are throwing raves....the
rest
are throwing imitation raves. *giggling*

like diet soda..what's the point? =)

>>Raves are not concerts. One thing I love about parties is that

>Hmmm, I don't see the connection.

well, if some people get into the party for free (guest listed, etc) whereas
other people have to pay $20 or more, it sucks! it makes it seem like
everyone
is not on the same level......

This is just my experience but: I've spun
>at massives where I was running out from behind the decks to hug people,
>and met people after my set and gave them hugs and candy,

you are awesome =) but a lot of djs unfortunately are not like that =(

> and I've been to free parties where I hung out behind the decks with all
the cool >people.

i'm not saying that just because a party is free means it will be good, and
just
because a party costs $20 or more means it will be bad.

I'm talking about the intentions of the promoter, because I really feel that
is shows
through in the event, in every detail, from the decorations to the flyer, to
the order
of the djs and music chosen, etc....if their heart is in the music and the
vibe it
shows through......but if it is not, it's painfully obvious....

A party that cost $20 where the promoter put 100% of their effort into
making it
creative, fun, and a good value, could be cool......if they were doing it
because
they loved it and not because they wanted to make loads of cash....

However, I unfortunately nearly always walk away from larger parties feeling
like
it was a waste ...like people just following the same old formula over
and over with little or no creativity...a stagnant process....i.e. "insert
big name
dj here, insert cheesy flyer with fractal here, insert standard relatively
well known local djs here..." like they just take a cookie cutter mold and
chop
out a party....all following each other's leads as though there is only one
way
to do an event....

however, i am talking about parties in seattle...since i rarely get to party
in sf
(unfortunately)  the massives there might be totally different. but here, i
feel that
they are formulated.....hopefully i will get to check out some good ones
while
i am in sf :) (i leave tomorrow! woo! )

>>I feel that raves and money-making should be kept separate. Throwing a
party

>
>That may well be so, but the reality is that most raves are business
ventures.

i disagree...maybe it's the word "rave" that i am disagreeing with....
i prefer raves that have no money involved and are illegal, free, and all
djs/sound
is for free...

if you had said "massive" rather than rave i would agree...

>There are ways to make money without fucking people over. Just because
>nearly all large corporations are evil, doesn't make everyone who tries to
>make a buck evil.

i agree, but i don't think throwing "raves/massives/whatever" is a good way
to make a living because it is so risky that people who are basing their
income
on it will basically advertise anywhere in order to be sure of making enough
to cover costs...

Hmmm, 

I was taught that two wrongs don't make a right.  Just because we might
feel that our government lies and oppresses us does not mean that we
should do the same.  So the war on drugs turned out to be a bad idea but
how can we overcome the stupid decisions of the past if we use the same
means to achieve goals we assume to be loftier?  We need to be different,
creative, and honest, not redundant.

So live your life that the fear of death can never enter your heart.
Trouble no one about their religion; respect others in their view, and
demand that they respect yours.
Love your life, perfect your life, beautify all things in your life.
Seek to make your life long and its purpose in the service of your
people.
Prepare a noble death song for the day when you go over the great divide.
Always give a word or a sign of salute when meeting or passing a friend,
even a stranger, when in a lonely place.
Show respect to all people and grovel to none.
When you arise in the morning give thanks for the food and for the joy of
living.
If you see no reason for giving thanks, the fault lies only in yourself.
Abuse no one and no thing, for abuse turns the wise ones to fools and
robs
the spirit of its vision.
When it comes your time to die, be not like those whose hearts are filled
with the fear of death, so that when their time comes they weep and pray
for a little more time to live their lives over again in a different way.
Sing your death song and die like a hero going home."

                                      Chief Tecumseh, Shawnee Nation

You really need to do a better job reading what people write. 

The CBC and their ilk aren't "moving towards legalization under the
auspices of the Medical Marijuana Law," they have been lying, misusing
and attempting to hide behind the law in order to distribute marijuana to
anyone who wants it. That is a far, far different thing from "moving
towards legalization." 

And I would amend your "some (not all)" to read *most*(not all). If it
were indeed only some, then Dennis Perone and company would not had to
have hid behind the facade of helping the ill.

What I feel is that the CBC is seeing the result of their lies. And the
truly sad thing is that the ill are suffering because of the lies.

Do you? Really? Seemingly you endorse the utter misuse of 215, so much in
fact that it risks the availability of medical marijuana to the people
with cancer and AIDS. I would hardly classify this as compassion.
Selfish and self-serving would be more appropriate terms.

Where is the legislation to free them? Where is the legislation to
legalize pot for anyone for any reason? I will gladly sign both of them. 
But that was not what the writers of 215 stated that their propostion was
for. That is not what the text of the propostion stated either.

So where's the bill? I haven't seen it.

Most certainly not. I do not consider falsehoods and using the ill as
human shields in this battle to be acceptable behaviour and have no
respect for those that would do so.

You might start by encouraging those that have been abusing the law that
they help create to use it for the purpose it was intended: helping the
ill. This would at least give them some credibility and at least the
appearance of legitimacy, properties which the seem to be sorely lacking.

And I would add:

"If you choose to use deception as a tool in order to assert this right, 
be prepared to wake up one day and wonder why you are so much like the
people you despise."

I would like to suggest that we use our news years eve to vote
for what we want this coming year. If you want $20 partys then
 vote for them by giving them your money. If you want more 
smaller less espensive parties this year then spend your new
years eve there.

Personaly i hope to spend mine in nature under the stars
by a warm fire. maybe in shasta or with california's new volcano.
Anyone want to go along... let me know.

happy holidaze whatever you do.

  While I highly respect Patricks opinion I am in diasagreement here with 
 him and would like to point out that he sounds a tiny bit bitter in his 
 comments on Dennis Peron (this coming from someone who knows how to 
 sound bitter).
 
  Pot is (IMO) an effective medication for some ills. Getting Pot to a 
 legal status *despite the intentions involved* is a step foward for 
 those who are suffering. Not only in the relief of a persons suffering 
 but especially as it gives the individual power over their medication. 
 The patient can grow their own rather than relying on huge corporations 
 (who care only about the dollar, not someones health) to provide relief. 
 And typically the corporations supply addictive and dangerous (when 
 compared to Pot) drugs to ill people.
 
  Dennis did a lot of people a favor by writing 215 and the voters of 
 California bear as much responsibility in it's passage as Dennis.

  And what if a person *just wants to get high* (oh the horror). Is that 
 so terrible? Particularly when it involves one of the safest drugs 
 known??? And what if wanting to get high is a form of self-medication? I 
 would rather be a mellow person from Pot smoking than from taking 
 Prozac!
 
 
 
 >...CBC has mixed the issues and are now paying for it!
 
  Not really. The order to stop selling Pot is not set in stone and even 
 if does become so, Pot can still be distributed free of charge. It just 
 can't be sold.
 
  A useful thing to remember is that we are all different. Some people 
 seem to operate in this world better when they are stoned. Others seem 
 to operate better when they are sober. Dennis has provided us not only 
 with a choice, but has also opened up research on medical pot. I thank 
 him for that.

Though I agree it is wrong to use the sick as a scapegoat, 215 did benefit
some of these people.  Then again I could always go into a new age docta's
office and say I have extremely bad cramps and the only thing that helps is
marijuana.  Who knows.  Damn, if it were legal, medically, industrially and
recreationally, there would be less crime in  the US, and we, as a country
would benefit greatly.  Though I do believe regulations should be held on the
recreational aspect, such as those held on alcohol, I don't believe minors
should have easy access to this substance.
What Dennis Peron plans to do if he is elected to office is pardon all those
held in prison for marijuana crimes.  Is that so wrong?  Even though part of
that is for his own personal benefit.
We all just have to ask ourselves, who is the lesser of the two evils?

Sounds real good. Just joined the list. Sort of on tour. I'm currently
touring about 8 lists with almost 180 emails/day.  I'm working on a
script with some people form Austin about raves. I'll keep you posted if
you are interested and want to provide "constructive" feedback on the
story we are developing.

>From Toron-toe. Been to SF on a work trip to S-valley during the summer
and planning to revisit in March. Well, it's 4am and time for da Hen to
take off his pvc silvers and crash out.

But I just wanted to say I'm really enjoying this list. South African
one is really fun, too. "Friendly" is the keyword.

Bye for now friends.

Hi rave-friends,

        Some (lengthy) thoughts on Kim & Michael's conversation...

>Quoth kim:
>>Nothing.  Businesses are all good.  A rave is not a business.

        Then blessed be the 10%!  And blessed be those rave-oriented
businesspeople who frequently think about the good of the scene as well as
their bottom line...

        This is where charging according to motive comes in (a concept I
mentioned in my recent message about DJ income).  If I were a sound system
owner, I would charge the going rate to promoters throwing parties as
business ventures, but I would let non-commercial friendly vibe promoters
use it for little or nothing, perhaps merely loaning it on condition they
replace it if damaged or confiscated.
        Promoters can return the favor of getting talent and equipment on
the cheap by giving exposure to up-and-coming DJs and sound and visuals
people, and maybe turning them on to better-paying opportunities.

        I have not found the size of the party to be a good indicator of
how good it will be, although *very* large parties are rarely among the
best, in my experience.  However I have found the intentions of the
promoters to be an *extremely good* indicator.  Admittedly I don't have any
way of looking inside their minds or really knowing anyone's true motives,
but then again I don't think this is really necessary in most cases to have
a pretty good idea of what kind of party it will be.
        A friend and I had a conversation recently about how cool it would
be if someone was able to develop a scientific instrument to measure the
vibe.  I'm not saying this is possible, because a lot of what makes a party
"good" is subjective.  But I think many of us have also experienced that a
lot of it isn't.  There are parties where it is very difficult not to enjoy
yourself!
        And it's my belief that it starts with the promoters.  A promoter
with a good vibe and good intentions is more likely to have friends with
similar attitudes, and the opposite is also true.  And the
friends/acquaintances of the promoters usually make up a good fraction of
the attendance at any party.
        These people in turn bring their friends, often others of like
spirit, through word of mouth, and the vibe, or lack thereof, of the party
is largely established before anyone ever arrives.
        Another way a promoter's intentions make a difference:  Someone
who's throwing a party as a business venture is going to be more worried
about the outcome, financially speaking.  If their primary goal is making
money, rather than spreading joy and helping people have fun, they won't
care as much if their security guards act like thugs.  In fact, better to
have thuggish, intrusive security guards, because that means less chance of
someone bringing something inside that could cause damage or create a
disturbance and get them busted.
        If the promoter's concern is money, not fun, it won't bother them
that much if people have to wait outside a while in the cold -- after all,
a long line outside may attract more paying customers to the event.
        And making people pour out their water before entering increases
the chances they'll plunk down $3 for the bottled water you're selling
inside.  All these things, of course, contribute to bringing peoples'
spirits down.  If you have a mega-watt sound system and their favorite DJs
on tap, and they take good drugs, it may not matter too much.  People may
still have a darn good time, and be willing to come back again.  Maybe
that's what you're counting on.  But how much better it can be <sigh>...

        Isn't it strange that it should be *more* expensive per person to
put on a bigger event?  With economy of scale, it should work the other
way.  You have certain fixed costs, like space rental, security, medical,
DJs, sound, lights, decorations, and whatever other fun stuff like free
fruit or bouncy castles you want to have to enhance peoples' experience, so
the more people attending, the less you should have to charge per person.
Right?  Yes, until the authorities step into the picture!
        Of course if you aren't doing it to make a buck, you're more likely
to get one or more of the above necessities at reduced or zero cost.
That's because there ARE people who charge according to motive.  8)

        Very well said, and I couldn't agree more.  The profit motive may
have a negative impact on the rave scene, but for civilization as a whole,
I think it's been very good.  I don't particularly want to go back to
living in grass huts without heat or electricity and scavenging for my
food.

>>For example, is using workers in third-world countries and paying them $4 a
>>day or less like Nike a good example of the entrepreneurial spirit? After all,
>>Nike sure profits from it....

        Unless they are slaves, which does happen and is a different
situation entirely, the person working at Nike making $4 a day chose to
work there because it was the best job around.  The argument that "they
have to work there, or they would starve" just doesn't wash, because it
leaves unanswered the obvious question of how they were surviving before
Nike came along.
        Companies making goods overseas also have to pay taxes (and
sometimes extortion money, just the way promoters here have to buy
bust-free parties by paying for permits and/or hiring cops for security!)
to their host countries, and tariffs to the U.S. government, if they bring
the goods back here to sell, not to mention corporate income tax.  Although
there are significant expenses like fancy ad campaigns and ridiculous CEO
salaries that a company can control, government payoffs represent a huge
chunk of cash that Nike, et.al. are forced to spend just to stay in
business.

        I'll bet many businesspeople said something like that about doing
business with non-Jews in Germany around the time the Nazis started
cracking down, too...
        If you don't think it's a comparable situation, then how much
repression is too much?  You gotta draw a line somewhere.  Personally I
think being forced to pay anything to assemble on private property for a
peaceable party is too much.  Indeed being forced to pay (or more
frequently, busted when we weren't even given the option of paying) for
using public land like a beach at night when no one else is using it and we
are taking effective measures to clean up after ourselves is equally wrong.
        Aren't drugs and raves (among other things) scapegoated for social
ills the way the Nazis scapegoated Jews?  If the answer is no, why are so
many ravers afraid to let their bosses know what they do on weekends?

Rave on,

right thing if they were misled into doing it either.  But surely doing the
right thing for the wrong reason is better than doing the wrong thing?

Is there a general idea of where people are goin on New Years eve?  I've been
asked by a lot of people and I haven't really heard anything yet.  I guess
there's still some parties that have yet to surface.  well, if it's a big
secret (as sometimes seems to happen on this list), I guess I can find out in
other ways, but maybe we should discuss considering there are 2 million
parties that night.  laters

I must say that this is one of the rare times that I actually agree with the
man known as the Black Adder. I have always felt that the campaign to legalize
Pot was in danger of being subverted due to the often times careless attitude
of some of the measures' supporters. After attending numerous rally's in
support of the issue(I dont puff weed--it heightens my already acute sense of
paranoia and anxiety), it became clear to me that either many of its
supporters are foolish in believing their actions would lead to a positive
outcome, or that the movement had been infiltrated by individuals attempting
to subvert the movement.

I also agree with Patrick, though he certainly has more vitriol in his
comments than I would use :)  If you talk to the folks working to set up
medical marijuana dispensaries in other counties, such as Santa Clara,
Santa Cruz, or San Mateo, you'll see a WORLD of difference in their
attitude, procedures, and approach than Peron's.  They are working with
local governments, local and state law enforcement, following zoning laws
and business regulations for medical institutions, and are following the
wording of 215 to the letter and making conservative interpretations where
necessary.  Peron's SF CBC doesn't even pay business taxes or business
registration fees to the city of SF.  SF as a city might have a higher
tolerance for this type of protest business than Santa Clara, but the fact
is that Peron's CBC is the biggest target of the anti-215 politicians, and
it threatens the existance of all the other medical marijuana establishments.

It doesn't concern me one whit that Peron wrote 215 and also wants pot
legalized for non-medical use.  I may even vote for him.  But he needs to
clean up the CBC and the attitude that 215 means that anyone with a cough
can name them their primary provider and thus get access.

I don't know if you saw my earlier post to SFRaves or not, but I figured I'd
ask again since I see you live in Hawaii. I was asking if anybody knows of
anything going on in Oahu or on the big island for New Year's Eve,
preferably with jungle beats. Do you know of anything?

I would also like to know where everyone is planning on watching the new
year arrive.  I would prefer to be at a smaller party -- not ToonTown  or
New Year's Eve Midnight express size, please -- but I'm having trouble
locating anything.  I assume the smaller parties are keeping quiet to
maintain their small size and ability to evade the detection of authority,
but if anyone has any info on something relatively small, but with a great
vibe and some excellent djs I would appreciate it if you would e-mail me.

Thanks

Robin

I also agree that using deception and exploiting sick
people to further your personal ambitions is the wrong approach
with this. I do believe that all substances should be legal and
regulated along with help for those that abuse them.
 I have mixed opinions about Peron. What ever you may think
of him...he IS a rebel and i happen to like rebels...america
was built by rebels. 

What if you applied the following logic to raves? You could
also say that undergrounds that are not permitted and violate
many laws are messing up the scene for those that want to do 
it legally. You could say that undergrounds, because they violate the
law and often result in police activity are giving raving
a bad name. I dont agree with that argument, just stating it
as a comparison to saying that Peron's tactics are messing
up the movement that wants to follow the law as regards medical 
marijuana.

If i had a choice i would choose someone besides Peron to lead
the fight to end the drug wars...but he seems to be the only
game in town as far as i know.

The time is near...

New Years...I would like to be a part of a small party this year. I know
that many peeps have been talking about not wanting to go to a "massive". I
don't blame them. I think about it and get this funny warm-like-yearning
feeling inside myself of wanting a party like BP, HK, Pacific, or F&F for
New Years - ya know, I mean really know?

There's nothing better than partyin' with the people who put a party on for
the vibe...and dancing with the peeps who get lost in the rhythm and vibe
with you.

Sooooooo, if anyone has da skoop, I would be Ecstatic to hEar it. I would
like to  bring a cooler full of Odwalla Juice for the party - to help out.

I just heard on the news that the police are preparing for 
a military attitude this year. ZERO tolerence for public
drinking or drugs. I have a friend with a relative on
sfpd who says that raves are going to heavily targetted this year.
If there is drinking or drugs or violence they will be shut down
immediately even if they are permitted. Even a 20 sack of buds
on the premises will result in the party being shut down.
So be careful and VERY discreet and if you are going to an
underground try not to draw attention to the location.
(hint...dont waste your money on sketchy overpriced massives)

Wishing everyone a safe a happy new year.

I also agree with Patrick, though he certainly has more vitriol in his
comments than I would use :)  If you talk to the folks working to set up
medical marijuana dispensaries in other counties, such as Santa Clara,
Santa Cruz, or San Mateo, you'll see a WORLD of difference in their
attitude, procedures, and approach than Peron's.
 -=-=-==-
this is way true, at a recent summit of many of the delivery groups the
distinction between prop 215 and legalization-for-all was made quite
clear and, I believe, most groups affirmed that they didn't want to be
in the place of Peron of being the most obvious fast & loose dealer (&
media darling).

They are working with local governments, local and state law
enforcement, following zoning laws
and business regulations for medical institutions, and are following the
wording of 215 to the letter and making conservative interpretations
where
necessary.
 -=-=-=
well, some are, there is room for interpetation & experimentation but
there are plenty of groups who are to the letter & are forming
non-profits and other groups who only come close.

Peron's SF CBC doesn't even pay business taxes or business
registration fees to the city of SF.  SF as a city might have a higher
tolerance for this type of protest business than Santa Clara, but the
fact
is that Peron's CBC is the biggest target of the anti-215 politicians,
and
it threatens the existance of all the other medical marijuana
establishments.
 -=-=-==--=
probably the two biggest issues with peron's club are that it's
operating as a social center/nightclub/caberet AND undocumented users
can purchase without proof of medical need (Peron has seemingly always
dealt to second-hand dealers)

It doesn't concern me one whit that Peron wrote 215 and also wants pot
legalized for non-medical use.  I may even vote for him.  But he needs
to
clean up the CBC and the attitude that 215 means that anyone with a
cough
can name them their primary provider and thus get access.
 -==-=-=-=-
I wouldn't hold your breath - he isn't about to change anytime soon; his
tactics have kept him out of prison and his club is still open and he's
making loads of money, still.

I admire a lot that he has done but I hope that he isn't risking
patient's wellness by his carelessness; his certainly has done more with
in-your-face activism than thousands of folks who've been happy with
whatever laws are imposed on them.

i agree.
i've been following this conversation loosely, and don't really have the
background on Peron or 215... however...
IMHO marijuana should be legalized and treated like other drugs of it's
sort... similar to alcohol.. where the effects and duration are similar.  A
bowl at home after work.. or in a bar/club environment...

I am glad that you would not agree with that argument, as the "logic" you
apply to the situation is not directly applicable. 

1) A promoter obtaining permits and paying off the establishment(legally)
   is in no way affected by those throwing illegal parties. 

2) The "undergrounds" in your hypothetical senario did not choose to work
    within the framework of the law by getting legislation passed to help
   the ill through their parties and then misusing that legislation,
   jepordizing the health and well-being of those they were supposed to
   be helping through their own selfishness.

Again it isn't a good comparison. 

The problem with Peron is that now all the anti-drug folks now have
something to point to and say "See, you were lying, we knew this isn't
what you were about." And you know what? They are absolutely right. And
this severely undermines the credibility of the *entire* legalization
movement. 

And instead of getting the fool out of there, people want to vote for him
for governor. What a pitiful choice. The anti-drug movement couldn't have
a better ally than in Dennis Peron, because he has no chance of success
due to his irresponsibility.

He isn't the only game in town. He has the most recognition, which is a
far different thing.

        Well Patrick, "to distribute marijuana to anyone who wants it" from
a legal club is de facto legalization, which I would say is indeed, "moving
towards legalization."

        Although I think you are *probably* right that most people voting
for Prop. 215 did not vote with the intention of moving toward
legalization, a significant number did, including myself.

        If I recall correctly, the percentage of Californians who say in
surveys that they favor pot legalization is around 25%.  I think we can
assume that nearly all those in favor of legalization who voted, voted yes
on 215.  Also, I think there were other "yes" voters who opposed immediate
re-legalization, but who favored 215 as a more gradual solution, with the
goal being eventual legalization if the approach seemed to work.  Given
these factors, it seems likely to me that a *very* significant part of the
pro-215 vote was a pro-legalization vote.

        Personally I have always been outspoken about re-legalizing drugs,
and I don't think I deceived anyone regarding Proposition 215 -- I remember
consistently talking about it as a means to help end the War on Drugs.

        More to the point however, why should someone like myself who
believes in civil disobedience when it comes to drug laws feel they have to
obey the letter of Proposition 215 when it says only persons with a medical
need should get marijuana?  Such a restriction is as immoral and
unconstitutional as the rest of the War on Drugs, and many of us have felt
this way from the beginning.

        Allow me to make an analogy:  Someone I don't know steals $100 from
me for no good reason, and a friend of mine knows who took it and says to
them, "Just return $10 of the money and everything will be cool."  My
friend tells me the thief has agreed to return $10 of the money, and wants
to know if that's okay with me.  "Sure," I say, figuring getting $10 back
is better than nothing.  Let's say my friend assumes that my consent to
getting the $10 back means I won't try to get the other $90 also when I
find out who took it, even though I explicitly never agree to this.  Let's
say that based on what my friend tells him, the thief also believes he can
return $10 and everything will be cool.  Should I make sure and let my
friend know otherwise?  Frankly, I don't care about my friend's
relationship with the thief -- I think he'd be better off not having
friends like that.  And if he's my friend, he should be glad to see me get
my money back without involving him in a lie.  Deceptive?  Yeah.  But if
the thief comes by with $10, and I make him give me back the other $90 as
well, is justice served?  You bet!

        If it wasn't obvious, in the analogy I'm the people who want to use
pot recreationally, my friend is the people who want it for medical use
only, and the government is the thief.

        I hope this has helped you understand how I feel about it.  And I
don't think I'm in danger of waking up just like the people I despise,
because I have no intention of putting people in jail for living lifestyles
I don't approve of. "Despise" is too strong a word anyway -- I don't hate
anyone, I just believe some people can be extremely dangerous and
misguided.

        And if you agree that our goal should be legal protection of drug
use as a fundamental human right, then might I suggest that we focus most
of our energy on that, instead of fighting with each other about the
tactics we use to get there?

Much love,
                                <<< Starchild >>>

Dear Rave friends,

        In Dennis Peron's defense, I do not think he is "exploiting" sick
people.  Dennis worked long and hard to make medical marijuana legal.
Whatever you think of how he has handled 215 as law, without him it might
not *be* the law.  He is gay, and lost a lover to AIDS, who was able to
ease some of his suffering by the use of pot.  He works around sick people
who need pot for medical reasons all the time.  If you ever hear the man
speak, you can tell he is coming from a very emotional and heartfelt place.
Maybe it is his excessive compassion that makes him somewhat of a loose
cannon politically...
        But then, you could have said the same thing about Gandhi.  When he
was trying to free India from the British, I'm sure people felt his methods
were too radical and were hurting the cause of the Indian people by
threatening to make the colonial rulers crack down harder...
        I'm not saying Dennis is perfect, or that he's comparable to
Gandhi.  But there is a long, proud tradition of radical political action,
and you know what?  When you look back at history, more often than not the
radicals were right.  Dennis Peron may simply be broad-minded enough, at
least in the case of pot, to understand this.

i am another who is in agreement with patrick on the peron/medical
marijuana topic.  my personal view is that marijuana should be legal, but
that the same laws should apply as alcohol (i.e. driving while stoned) for
the protection of others.

but when the voters passed 215, they were passing a bill to allow growing
and dispensing marijuana to people with a medical need.

while many may have had a deeper agenda to move toward complete
legalization, that was not what the bill said, and it was not what they
voted on.

i, too, have been in situations where is was very clear to me that the
cannibis action movement has been using the shield of medicinal use as a
foot in the door to total legalization, such as attending a meeting where
the medical use issue was never mentioned, and little was accomplished
because the attendees were so stoned that there was little participation or
discussion in the real issues.  (true quote:  "At last month's meeting, we
came to three conclusions.... but I can only remember two of them... can
anyone remember all three?"  .... total silence in a smoky room....)

and i have personally seen the loose controls that have allowed large
quantities of pot, theoretically sold under "compassionate use" protection,
walk out the door of the cannibis club into the hands of people who are
*not* the ones the law was meant to provide for.

like it or not, pushing the limits of this law, while shouting
"compassionate use" is dishonest, and puts the entire issue completely at
risk.

if prop 215 was meant to be the first step on the road to legalization,
then it must be respected as such... one foot in the door doesn't mean you
can just push the door down because you think have the leverage.

while many of us would have voted for a bill to completely legalize
marijuana, the reality is that it probably would not have passed.  so we
supported what was available to us, and what we felt was the right thing to
do for the people the bill was meant to help.

starchild, i tried to and failed to follow your analogy about having
someone steal from you.... i'd suggest that this one may be more similar:

your entire state is living under a 10:00 pm curfew, which most of you
think is ridiculous.  you'd like to change that curfew, but instead of
trying to get it completely abolished, because that might fail, and leave
you where you started, you instead negotiate that certain needy people are
allowed be exempt from any curfew, based on very specific criteria.

but then someone starts issuing the passes to stay out all night to all
sorts of people who don't fit that criteria, and the powers that be are
pretty upset by it, because they see this as abusing the deal that was
negotiated.  The risk is now that they may decide to rescind the deal
entirely, even to the truly needy people, and just go back to how it was
before.

i think if you say you're willing to take your incremental win, you should
respect the terms of it.... and then when it's time, you can renegotiate
and go for midnight, or 1am, and when people are used to that, then you are
ready to abolish the curfew entirely.

this is what working within the system is all about....  and changing laws
means having the strategic mindset and honesty to work within the system,
whether it's to take steps to gradually legalize pot, or to throw parties
that don't get shut down by the police because you have ignored the laws.

you have the choice to take the risks of doing it outside the system if you
want to, certainly, but don't think that doing that is ever going to make
any real progress within the system...  and when you are trying to change a
law, if you're not trying to do it within the system, you have no chance of
success.

I think that Starchild's analogy is working under the assumption that we
have the innate right to "life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness" as
long as our actions do not infringe unduly upon the rights of others to do
the same.  When the government instated laws that did not allow us the
freedom to life our lives as we like (i.e. took away our right to use
drugs), they stole something from us -- in Starchild's analogy, the person
stole the $100 from us.  Our friend (those who support legalizing marijuana
for medical use) have negotiated with the theif (the government) to get
back some of the innate rights that have been taken from us.  But if we are
able to force the theif to return the rest of the rights that are owed to
us, why shouldn't we?  If we have an innate right to liberty, shouldn't we
defy a law that attempts to take those rights away?

Ditto. So far the phone lines haven't changed yet, and I haven't
hear anything about the Transporation. Further all of their
web sites are out of date. This is starting to give me the
creeps. But assuming it is happening, and not just some major
conspiracy to rip us off, anyone else going, meeting pts, etc?

P.S. Since this is my first post I guess I should say a bit
about myself. I've just moved out west from Toronto, Canada,
(and previously from Poland which was a long time ago, but if
you need to know where my accent is from...) I've been going
to events since ~1990 (I mentioned this to some barely-teen-chick
at a Halloween event and her eyes got so big they almost popped,
she was probably barely out of diapers back then).

(hi robin!)

while your description makes it a little clearer, i think my perceptual
problem here is that i think we're dreaming if we think that the
"thief"/government can be likened to someone we can beat up and steal our
money back from (that was what you had in mind, starchild? the "thief"
would appear with the $10 in hand, and you'd knock him over the head or
whatever and demand or steal back the other $90???)...

i don't think that's very realistic, expecially if you're a 2-foot-tall
weakling and the thief is the big bad giant thug who's a hundred times, a
thousand times, a million times, your size, and who has a whole army of
legislation and enforcement behind him, and who will happily use that to
show you who has the power when he realizes you think you set him up.

to me, while i see some of the reasoning in this analogy, it's a little
like the kindergarten kid thinking he's going to beat up the boogy man...
it's dreaming.  you cannot "force" or trick the government into making drug
use legal... and you cannot bluster your way through the current laws.  to
change the rules, you have to work within the system that is set up for
changing the rules.  because the "government" and the "legal system" is
really just people who are enforcing the rules that they are told to
enforce.

i don't like it either, i just have a different viewpoint about who's going
to be the winner in the "steal it back from the thief" scenario...

(there is a separate tangent about whether we truly have "innate" rights,
and what "life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness" really protects for
us... but that's another day!)

I agree with both you and Starchild.  I think that to create the best
society for everyone, we need to recognize the "innate" right to life and
liberty, but I also think it is difficult to force our government to give
it to us.  Especially when our government has the two-faced attitude of
voicing a belief in liberty, while only endorsing it when it is convenient.
And, of course, most of the populace is willing to sacrifice some freedoms
for the illusion of safety.  However, just because it may be quite
difficult to force the government to give us the liberties we have been
promised, I also think we have to continue to try.  Maybe coming up to the
big monster and trying to knock it over the head is not the best way,
though.  In all those fairy tales where David kills Goliath, where the
tortosie beats the hare, where Hanzel and Gretel kill the witch, where the
golden-haired princess outwits Rumplestiltskin -- each of the strong, bad
monsters was not confronted on the field of it's strength, but was instead
defeated by finding it's Achille's heel.

ah...  perhaps.. and although disorder may be a "pothead"... he isn't
saying *anything* about Prop. 215... he's merely exuberantly announcing
it's time for him/has been time for him to smoke out... obviously illegally.

if he knows any more about Prop. 215 than me... it still would be 4:20.

Respectfully, do you all know where 4:20 originates?  Have you even asked?
Its not a random time that stoners picked.  This topic shouldn't even
relate to 4:20, which is only derived in spite of the government's laws.
Within one political group, a joke about the other is ok.  But wide spread,
you wear your self thin.  Choose the right time to joke about things like
that.

So are you saying he is sick for posting this? Maybe we
should get him some medicine.


        ><{{{">   <"}}}><

                
I wonder if working with in the system to change the system is such
a good idea anymore since our top cop in state and the government are
criminals and could care less what the law says or what the people
want. Even when we pass a law the government and police refuse
to enforce it. Every right in the constitution has been modified
or eliminated so that who ever has the most money and the biggest guns
gets to decide justice. Sometimes a system become so corrupt that
the only thing to do is ....reformat C drive.

people seem to have a notion that government is deceitful and two faced...let
me just say that I'm sure we don't even know how deep this deception penetrates
our lives...might I suggest a reading of a document called "The Committee of
300" by I believe Dr. Malone...the man spills what he's learned having worked
in the intelligence community and being sickened by their activities of
control through cooperation of a secret society shaping the world's
history...not to induce paranoia but I take it for granted that every piece of
e-mail I send is recorded somewhere...this is not news to anyone...I agree with
the person who said that you must work within the system to change
things...rules will be followed, change the rules and they will be followed no
matter how ludicrous...to the people who are in favor of legalizing drugs, you
say freedom to control one's life and the pursuit of it should be honored...so
you would have legal access to crack, meth, heroin, coke...everything and
anything people want to do?...just a little recreational self-destruction?...I
would loosely quote Derrick May who said, "Fuck the drugs, I don't need it to
feel the vibe.  It all started with the music, drugs don't make it real."...I
suppose there are people who will argue that drugs expand the mind and give
you a broader horizon with different points of view...I can understand that,
but can we look into ourselves and find the humanity and empathy to relate to
our fellow ravers?...or do drugs in various forms have to play a part in
it?...the last massive I went to was Tekno Tribe's Halloween and I saw very
little tweaky freakies there, made me feel good...but maybe it's my wishful
thinking that the music is enough, I do know that music saved my life and still
does from the redundant repetitiveness and blatant brow beating to conform to
society's standards...and I do know for a fact that once when the music was
new and no one knew what techno or house was and it's various evolutions, once
there were people who felt that the music was in and of itself the drug...I say
enough is enough, vibe all night using only your energy and when you're tired,
you know you danced your ass off to the max your body could take...vibe all
night sober, really feel and think about the music...then ask yourself, was
that enough?...if it wasn't and you need to take something to make it better
for you, then the music cannot save your ehtereal life...you've bought in for
the duration...peace...

Hello Sfraves,

Well after sleeping for the last two days I have finally stirred up enough
energy to write this post. So here it is...

Last Saturday, at Harmony's Beautiful People, I was so happy with
everything. (which is hard to do, I am usually the one saying we could have
had more lights, or more this, or less that, etc. ) Everything seemed to
click right into place that night... The Harmony Crew did a fantastic job
setting that place up for what was a completely phat party! A huge thank
you and mad props goes to everyone who helped put that party together. You
all should be very proud of yourselves!!!  

I just wanted to touch on something that I spoke about at the end of the
party... some of you were there remember but for those of you who weren't,
here it is... Our goal for this party was to highten everyones' awareness
of their inner self, and each other. Our props were geared towards all
verbal messages, and words or ideas, which we hoped all of you took home
with you from the party.

Our message to you, was simply to be more conscious of you and your scene.
Be responsible with your parting, and always be safe. You are responsible
for your own happiness, and you can make a party into whatever you want it
to be. So if you want a happy, fun-filled, safe, positive, pure and clean
party... Then you need to make it happen! And at Beautiful People, on
Saturday Dec. 27th... We all created just what we wanted... and it was
AMAZING!!! I can't thank all of you who came enough for making it such an
emotionally successful night. All of you are the best! So thank you, thank
you, thank you!

We all had so much fun at that party... It will go down in my book as one
of the funnest BP parties I have seen so far (and that is a lot... ouch my
back ; ). I thought the djs were great all night long, and it was great to
see some new talent in our little group. 

All in all... It was a totally killer party. and I am glad that it went off
the way it did... And thank you to the so many people that were a part of
it and to those of you that helped create that phat vibe!!! On behalf of
the whole Harmony Crew, take care and we'll see you next year! We love you!

Peace and love,

Greg = )

  Howdy!
 oh lord, I'm turning into my father-ew :P  I just wanted to share some 
thoughts about this last year...
What "last year?"  It went by soo fast, so many new friends, ideas, and 
dreams.  The one thing that stands out more than anything was that I 
went to my first party last Summer.  Since then, I have been completely 
impacted because of raving,  I would spend my $ on parties instead of 
food, clutches, gas, cigs, tires, fuel pumps (I'm finally learning..I 
need a better job :P)  but the money issue was never really that 
important to me, It was worth the revelations and the things that I have 
matured about.  Shoot, I would pay 20$ /week on crap (m&ms, McD's, gum, 
well f00d in general was my only good hobby, now I've just been eating 
all the fudge that we got from our other foodaholic family members)  I 
might as well be meeting people, dancing, and having a great time ya 
know?  
  I'm actually very excited about the new year for once, I've been very 
content with what has happened and all the good that it has brought into 
my life.  Lord knows what will happen this next year...I don't want to 
think about that right now.. ;)

Stay safe tomorrow night, don't use a condom, use a brick (it would 
really toy with the outcome of the relationship He he )  
Another quick note, if you want to hug a tree this new years eve, make 
sure that you aren't in an automobile

Thank you all for a great one, and to all, a great night...tomorrow 
night...the eve...that is...well..you have a good night tonight 
too...and I will also...

Random acts of spazdom
committed by yours truly,
bAByHueY and good friend,

Conducting illegal activities from a legal business in no way moves those
illegal activities towards legalization. Has the cause of legalizing
prostitution been aided by escort services?

Further, there is nothing legal about what the CBC has been doing. It is
in no way "legal" in that sense.

Please point to any time that I stated that you the individual should obey
the letter of the law, if it is injust.

So the question is: Do you have the ability to battle these restriction on
their own merit, or do you find it necessary to attempt to deceive and
misuse people in an effort to reach your goals?

I wish you wouldn't. Long, drawn out analogies such as the one presented 
tend to add more confusion to the issues rather than offering
clarification. However since you feel the need...

Correction: If the thief is the government as you indicate, you *GAVE*
them the $100. 

And since you proceed on a false premise, I feel no need to continue
picking apart the analogy. 

Please, if you wish to discuss the issues, let's discuss them. I think we
are all capable of understanding them.

Not really. It would have been much easier if you had stuck to the issues.

The tactics are paramount in determining the success or failure of any
given venture. 

Dirty tactics result in dirty results.

Sender: sfraves-owner@hyperreal.org
Precedence: bulk

So what if Dennis Peron thinks all marijuana smoking is medical?  That's
not what Prop. 215 says, and at least one of the three Court of Appeals
judges agreed that it is ridiculous to prevent the sale of legal medicine
(do you have to grow your own opium to get painkillers recommended by your
doctor).  To the extent the CBC has pushed the limits of the law of this
state, the courts, the legislature and the authorities will obviously fight
them as much as they can -- just as they've fought more stringent clubs
like Flower Therapy as well, who haven't been as able to defend themselves
as the CBC despite their less controversial methods.  But until the
government steps in to supply medical marijuana through hospitals and
dispensaries, criticism of the distribution methods of those helping people
rings hollow to me.  Do any of you actually grow and distribute medical
marijuana, or teach ill people how to grow themselves?  Would you take that
risk?

One fact remains -- more people have been provided actual and sometimes
safe access to medical marijuana due to 215 than any other legislation
passed in this country.  And it wouldn't have happened without Dennis
Peron, flaws and all.

Guess what folks?  Dennis Peron started out as a pot dealer.  He's taken
bullets from the SFPD to show for it.  And his illegal connections have
obviously benefited desparately needy people, no matter who else has
benefited.  His personal life hardly shows evidence of great wealth from
selling pot at the club at those above-illegal-market prices.  (If you
aren't sick, but can't get pot in SF elsewhere than the CBC, you deserve to
pay their prices).

Those who observe the CBC -- and remember, no one has yet convicted anyone
associated with the CBC for selling pot, the court ruling was an injunction
without the evidentiary stage yet -- and then conclude that there shouldn't
be medical marijuana, should logically suggest ways of getting pot to sick
people as an alternative to the CBC, not recommend that there be no medical
marijuana under 215.  Those who accept the argument that, because some
people believe medical marijuana should apply to all smoking, there should
be no medical marijuana at all, are the only people who will be so turned
off by the CBC that they won't continue to support medical marijuana.  I
don't think that's that big a group -- most people understand the
difference.

The most Dennis can be accused of is tactical arrogance, not some moral
failing threatening the rights of those who truly need medicine.  He did
more to legalize those rights than anyone, and nothing he's accused of
doing now detracts from that a bit.

To paraphrase Animal Farm, even for those who believe that all marijuana
use is medical, some marijuana use is more medical than others.

the chronicle said they will be running until 3 in the morning.  my guess
is they'll be on holiday schedule Jan. 1, and start at 8.

I realize this is not marijuana related but thought
i would post it to the list anyway. But just to keep 
it on topic i would like to remind everyone that
a long time ago before microsoft, there were a bunch of
rebels that used some extremely illegal activities
to overthrow the government and declare their freedom.
Some of them even grew marijuana, george washington
for one example. Personally i think its about time we
started thinking a little more about these people as
we move into the new year and think about what we want
to create. So with that in mind here is a bit of british
wisdom to help celebrate the new year. And notice how it
is very similar to our own leaders wisdom.

 
Words of Wisdom from British Politicians of the Conservative Party:
     
  "We are not wholly an island, except geographically." --John Major
     
  "Suicide is a real threat to health."  --Virginia Bottomley
     
  "Anyone would think we were living on some island somewhere."
        --George Walden
     
  "It's not the future I'm talking about, I'm talking about tomorrow."
       --John Gummer
     
  "There's no smoke without mud being flung around."
     --Edwina Currie
     
  "I will never forget the 1981, -- or was it 1982? -- honours
     list."  --Julian Critchley
     
  "The trend in the rise in unemployment is downward."
       --Gillian Shepherd
     
  "The more important things are more important than the less
      important things."  --Stephen Dorrell
     
  "When the IRA plant such bombs, it proves they can scare people,
     it proves they can kill people, it proves nothing."
     -- Peter Bottomley
     
  "We said zero, and I think any statistician will tell you that...
     zero must mean plus or minus a few."  --William Waldegrave
     
  "Who Sadam Hussein kills, dies."  --Jeffrey Archer
     
  "All those people who say that there will never be a Single
   European Currency are trying to forecast history."  Kenneth Clark
     
  "The British public sees with blinding clarity."
     --Michael Hese


happy new year

98 is going to be great!
A year without hate
is the wish 
of this fish

and may a golden star be born in each of our hearts this new years eve.
And let each of those stars connect with a beam of love and gratitude.
Tonight let our hearts beat as one in peace and happiness.

So, what do we think the government's Achille's Heel might be?  If we use
deception then we assume their weakpoint is that they are easily decieved.
It's an interesting question.

The title of this post is called:
TOON TOWN POSTPONED or ANOTHER SHITTY NEW YEARS or THANKS A LOT!

I just called the Toon Town Voice-Mail and they said that because of the
Oakland City Council and other Oakland officials they are POSTPONING
Toon Town until Saturday Night! They called Origin and asked if they
could team up with them but the Origin jerks were gonna charge them
hellza money! The party on Sat is only gonna be $20 at the door and if
you can't make it on Sat and you bought presale i think they said the
tickets were refundable.

Well!!! My NEW YEARS is gonna suck! I have no pre-sal for cloud factory
and it is all sold out! I refuse to go to Origin because of what
happened last year since, the party was busted because a certain person
from a certain production company called the po-po's on them and even
before then the party really sucked. It was small and crampt, the music
was bad, the lighting was bad and there were drunk people in the party.
The map point was on Haight and the party was in Oakland!
	I don't have $30 to spend on Resolution. And it's just gonna be full of
assholes, gangsters with guns, hoes, bunk e dealers, and someone will
probably get stabbed or some dude will grabb Victoria's ass. I think i
will just stay home. Better yet i will have more fun at the Edge.

Happy Fu*king New Year Everybody RAVE ON!!

Love,
Paul*E*Wog

I have built a <small> buisness with this practice. And it has kept me broke and 
frustrated. I can't make the money I need to buy bigger systems for those high paying 
jobs. What is worse is a high percentage of the people I have dealt with who want a 
system for cheap or free dont understand the value of the equipment. They dont 
understand if they blow my equipment up I might not be able to make my rent that month. 
In thier mind the value of the equipment is((Cheap)), they didnt put any effort out and 
so thier feelings of responsibility towards my equipment is limited. 


  This brings me back to the subject. IMO Money is a measurement of energy. If 20$ 
party's are too expensive for you than create your own party or contribute some energy 
towards someone elses.  Believe me, it is sooo much cheaper/easier to pay $20 than it 
is to throw a party(or even volunteer). It would be kinda cool if everyone who 
complained about expensive partys threw thier own free party. 
 
  Having not paid thousands of dollars to make a massive come off, one might take for 
granted the ((VALUE)) of a large party. I believe you are getting a good deal. 


  I am getting old and am tired of lugging shit around for free buut I still have these 
pesky ideals so if you are in a bind call me and I will help you with sound.

"medical" marijuana smoking is a crock.  if thc aides the ill, there are
better ways of putting it into your system than smoking dank.

you don't think they would distribute thc tablets instead?  wouldn't it be
a  hell of a lot easier to regulate as a "medicine"?  they've been
regulating pharmacutials that way for years. 

have you ever heard of a perscribed drug you *smoked*?  

what is the actual likleyhood of it being used for medical  purposes in
that form?  i would think rather slim.

The *fact* of the matter is that pot's active ingredient THC cannot
be properly synthesized, so the little tablets (Marinol is the brand
name, I believe) don't do it for a lot of people.  It is possible to
eat pot (in, like, brownies or cookies or whatever), but that takes
a lot of preperation time, and takes a lot longer to work its way into
the system, and, therefore longer to give any pain relief.  So, smoking
is the way to go for a lot of people.

The only reason you haven't heard of a pharmacutical that is smoked
is because marijuana has been illegal since the '30's.  It is the
fastest and most economical way to deliver THC into the bloodstream.

Cheers,
Steve.

I don't think anyone(myself included) is arguing that point.

By all means, then let's focus on the clubs that are playing "by the
rules." These are the ones that are suffering the injustices, and who
should be receiving the attention.

It isn't an issue of "distribution methods." It is an issue of
distributing it to people that have no need for it, while attempting to
hide behind a law that allows you to distribute it to people that actually
are in need of it. 

> Do any of you actually grow and distribute medical marijuana, or teach
> ill people how to grow themselves?  Would you take that risk?

This is totally irrelevant to to the issue being discussed, which for
the umpteenth time is the distribution of the substance to those *THAT ARE
NOT ILL* by attempting to misuse the law that allows the use of the
substance by those that are actually ill, and the possible
deleterious effects that may result from these actions. If you wish to
discuss the legitimate purpose of 215 which the CBC is totally
disregarding, by all means let's start a seperate thread.

Oh yes, Dennis Peron, one man crusade. Sorry, that falls very, very short. 
As the legislation passed, it is obvious that there was popular support
for the concept, so all you can do is speculate that it would not have
happened sans Dennis Peron.

And he still is.

In the short term, I would agree. However his lies and irresponsibility
stands to destroy those benefits for *everyone* in the long term.

Again, it isn't relevant to the conversation. Dennis Peron could make a
million dollars from dealing drugs, and I would care one whit except for
the fact that he is hiding behind the ill, and stands to destroy or
severly damage the legalization movement for the forseeable future.

Rather they are convicted or not has no relevance to the fact that they
are doing so.

Again, you have gone off on a tangent. I haven't seen anyone here suggest
that there be no medical marijuana under 215. My comments are directed
specifically towards and about Dennis Perone and the CBC.

> Those who accept the argument that, because some  people believe medical

Again, who said that?

You are very, very mistaken. It is not only a moral failing, but the
jepardization of a law that he helped create. I'm sorry that you can't see
that using the ill as a front for drug dealing is wrong, but it is.

It is no wonder that with attitudes such as this, *even* among the people
that don't agree with many of the laws governing our society and complain 
about the deceit of politicians, that we have the liars and thieves we do
in government. You are endorsing the same tactics. 

> He did more to legalize those rights than anyone, and nothing he's
> accused of doing now detracts from that a bit.

Short term success, mis-managed and misused will most likely result in
long term failure. And considering that his actions stand to hurt far more
than they will help, he should be prevented from doing further harm.

that
risk?
 -==-=-=-=-
I doubt that anyone wants any governmental unit doing distribution, if
anything decriminalizing diifferent aspects and making way for legal
businesses with proper regulation (like a pharmacy or bar is regulated)

I don't think thisa started as a criticism of just the methods being
used as much as criticizing for putting sick people at risk by twist and
ignoring the very law (prop 215) that Peron wrote and continues to
ignore the will of the law (& voters) thereby risking the entire effort
AND continually mixing medicinal with legalization for all..

One fact remains -- more people have been provided actual and sometimes
safe access to medical marijuana due to 215 than any other legislation
passed in this country.  And it wouldn't have happened without Dennis
Peron, flaws and all.
 -==-=-=-
this may be true but Peron is not the only one who did the work on it
and we'll never know if it wouldn't have happened because it did
already, I do appreciate the accomplishments made but his actions have
also put loads of peolple at risk and much of it could fold easily.I
liken it to the london underground clubs that police are happier knowing
where they are and leave them be as long as they reasonably behave
themselves (I think that's why the D.A. has let it go for now)

Guess what folks?  Dennis Peron started out as a pot dealer.  He's taken
bullets from the SFPD to show for it.  And his illegal connections have
obviously benefited desparately needy people, no matter who else has
benefited.  His personal life hardly shows evidence of great wealth from
selling pot at the club at those above-illegal-market prices.  (If you
aren't sick, but can't get pot in SF elsewhere than the CBC, you deserve
to
pay their prices).
 -=-==-=-
I've only heard acedotes about piles of cash and what they're used for.
That's only part of the issue though - he charges higher prices because
he can, he (still I hope) gives discounts or free to those that can't
afford. Other clube have had little probrem charging as little as they
could and deeply discount for those who can't afford. One friend of mine
paid regular price when they could and discount when they couldn't.
Never could they pay Peron's prices.

Those who observe the CBC -- and remember, no one has yet convicted
anyone
associated with the CBC for selling pot, the court ruling was an
injunction
without the evidentiary stage yet -- and then conclude that there
shouldn't
be medical marijuana, should logically suggest ways of getting pot to
sick
people as an alternative to the CBC, not recommend that there be no
medical
marijuana under 215.  Those who accept the argument that, because some
people believe medical marijuana should apply to all smoking, there
should
be no medical marijuana at all, are the only people who will be so
turned
off by the CBC that they won't continue to support medical marijuana.  I
don't think that's that big a group -- most people understand the
difference.
 -=-=
I don't want to see him shut down just clean up his act a bit & stop
selling to dealers off the street for starters

The most Dennis can be accused of is tactical arrogance, not some moral
failing threatening the rights of those who truly need medicine.  He did
more to legalize those rights than anyone, and nothing he's accused of
doing now detracts from that a bit.

I guess we can agree to disagree

"medical" marijuana smoking is a crock.  if thc aides the ill, there are

I have agreed with most (not all) of what you have said so far but not this.
I know several that use marijuana for things like nausea, migrains,depression
and various other minor ailments. Why should we have to go to a doctor
everytime we get indigestion or headache? Part of the medical
problem today is that we have given too much athourity to the medical
community that is controlled by the government and drug companies which
by the way are the ones fighting this law. There are so many cases
of people with terminal illnesses that have rejected the AMA and
turned to natural medicine and cured themselves. To me this whole 
issue is one of freedom...freedom to choose your own treatment and
freedom from government control. Doctors using current medical practices
are causing more harm than good because americans are too lazy to 
think for themselves anymore and would rather have some
"expert" or government agency tell us what is good or bad.

It kind of depends on what kind of music you're spinning.  House tends
to (traditionally, anyway) be more dependant on particular songs,
whereas trance is more seamless and not as geard toward being a "remix"
of a song, but rather something else entirely -- like taking little
bits of song or sound bites or movie dialogue or whatever on top of
beats, other sound effects, keyboard, etc.  For that reason, I tend
prefer trance, because it's easier to get lost in it, since there is
not as many real "transitions".  Naturally, a set should "go somewhere",
but that dosen't mean you have to make sudden or drastic changes.

Well, you asked . . .

Steve.

I have high standards, so up yours.

Hiya all,


.
>

> 
> I have high standards, so up yours.

Yowza. Glad to see your high standards apply to all of us as well.

Alrighty, here's my $.02.

I think that if you look at a DJ's history and how they came up it sort of
gives an indication of whether they can do high impact transitions from one
song to another. It has been my experience that those that come from a hip
hop/club background are more adept at a taking house/trance/techno tracks and
making the transition, although obvious, an amazing step towards raising the
energy level in a mix.
However, the DJs that come in from only mixing house, trance, etc. don't
really have the ability to mix and change tempo's etc. because they don't
understand how to program music and change things up on a willing crowd. Their
DJ'ing experience is really an incestuous one and doesn't draw from a whole
lot of different (and extremely valuable) perspectives.
In my experience, it is much easier to DJ to a rave/party crowd than a top
40/club crowd. The top 40 crowd is always in your face asking for requests,
etc. and they are completely dependant on your ability to keep their interest
in the music (you are, after all, competing against their next "pick-up" or
their inebriated state).
House music and rave goers, however really depend on a steady groove and they
truly leave you alone (unless you really blow, then all the closet DJs come
out of the closet!). I feel that the prior experience is more valuable in
every DJ's growing resume.
It's the DJ that understands how to successfully work the music, forcing it to
do things w/ turntablist skills, that make for a better DJ.
Otherwise, you are just beatmatching. Just about anyone can do that after a
couple of weeks practice.

No. My point is that Dennis Peron is not qualified to determine that all
marijuana smoking is medical and then use that determination in an attempt 
to subvert the law that he helped create. 

And since we are on the topic of smoking, while marijuana may be natural,
I imagine that putting any kind of smoke in your lungs is not good for
you, thus it really is necessary to weigh the possible negative effects
when evaluating the desired effects.

I have no argument with this. However 215 states that marijuana can be
authorized by a doctors recommendation, not Dennis Peron's, or your own. 
If you want to take back the authority that has been given to the medical
community, then that needs to be done via legislation spelling it out.

Do you think the terminally ill that turn away from the advice of their
doctors and die anyways are put in the media? No, it isn't newsworthy. The
*exceptions*, the ones that do survive despite all odds end up in the
press. However, I do agree that in the cases of the terminally ill, they
should be able to try pretty much anything they want.

In the broader sense, I agree. However my comments were about the actions
of Dennis Peron and the CBC specifically. 

> Doctors using current medical practices are causing more harm than good

If this was indeed the case, no one be going to them, and they would be
completely unable to obtain malpratice insurance.

While I fully support the use of alternative medicines and healing
practices, they are not a substitute for modern medicine. Ideally, they
would be used in conjunction with alternative practices. And this is
beginning to happen. My HMO for example offers chiropractic, acupuncture,
and courses in *preventitive* medicine. And several of the others I
reviewed offered similar programs.

Yeah, I believe you Patrick. The Club is a front so that dennis can sell

In your last message you said this:

The above certainly sounds like you know what is occuring there as well,
so why the sudden change of story?

If it weren't for the voters such as myself who voted for the legislation,
the "movement" would be nowhere. Personally, I don't appreciate being lied
to, no matter how "noble" the intent.

Just because no one's been arrested or prosecuted, etc doesn't mean that
it can be or won't be done; only that it hasn't
IMO priority is being given to other issues and drugs which are a bit
more violent in nature
IMO pots leading side-effects are obesity & pregnancy

when i first heard jungle, i thought all the songs sounded the same, and
then someone said (hi reagan!) ... "wow!!! this is my favorite song!!" and
i thought she was out of her mind...  then i learned to listen differently,
and saw the subtleties and learned about the styles, and generally became
more educated...

house is easier, because there are usually some sort of lyrics or
distinctive beat patterns, it's more like a "song" usually ..... but that's
just one end of the spectrum...

i think that anyone who thinks that any genre of music all sounds the same
hasn't really learned to listen to that music yet, and that if they pay
attention, they'll begin to feel it...

a dj shouldn't have to trainwreck just to show that these are two separate
records.... because it's in the mixing, the layering, the gradual
transitions, where two or more pieces of music blend to create something
entirely different, that the truest and most beautiful music is made.

        Robin summed up what I meant very nicely, but my analogy wasn't
perfect, just the best I could quickly come up with.  In the real world, we
have an extremely important advantage over the thief/bully government:
They're trying to *force* us to do or not do something, we're just trying
to be free.

        That is, we don't have to "get our money back" as in my example.
All we have to do is get them to leave us alone from now on!  Although some
would disagree with me, I'm willing to have a general amnesty for
government officials who have been involved in the War on Drugs, and I'm
also willing to forgive their debt of billions of our dollars that have
been wasted on it.  (We should insist however, that people convicted of
nonviolent drug offenses be freed, and that property siezed in the drug war
be returned.)

        I believe there are times and means for working within the system,
and times and means for working outside the system.  Again looking at
history, there was a place for the people trying to get slavery legally
outlawed, and there was also a place for John Brown, the white leader of a
group who went around freeing slaves by force and killing slaveowners who
resisted.

        To say that the only way to make change is by following rules set
up by your opponents is to concede way to much.  It's also exactly what
they want you to think!

        Real, successful change very often comes about by breaking rules.
Consider the Free Speech movement at Berkeley, or Emma Goldman's public
speeches on the use of contraceptives which landed her in jail (yes, that
happened in this country, in this century!), but changed society
irrevocably for the better.

        Of course, you may say I'm a dreamer (I know, it's even part of my
email address), but I'm not the only one... In one of my favorite quotes,
Margaret Mead said, "Never doubt that a small, committed group of people
can change the world.  Indeed it's the only thing that ever has."

Love & liberty,

I'm leaving for Monterey from SF around 8pm or so, and have space for one

straight back (maybe after a pancake breakfast or something) so if anyone 1

Dear Brynne,

        Without more information about how much you charge, the cost of
your system, etc., it's hard to say much in response to this.

        However I will say that I get the impression you are trying to make
enough money to pay rent and afford a bigger soundsystem on the basis of
loaning your current system to underground-type events.  Respectfully, I
would suggest that the frustration you experience may be due to your
regarding this activity as a money-making venture.

        On the other hand, if the people you're loaning the equipment to
are really that unsympathetic and careless in their attitude toward you and
your system, maybe you should consider making it available elsewhere.
Surely there are good and considerate promoters who would not take this
attitude.

May the bass be with us,   ;)

He doesn't make the Doctor's recommendations people need to get pot at the
CBC, so how is he subverting the law?  Human beings are perfectly qualified
to their opinions, but that opinion of his doesn't translate into open pot
sales at the club for non-medical needs, despite what you think.

For people suffering from nausea, smoking is generally accepted as the best
method of administration, because nauseous people have problems taking it
orally.  Pot in edible form is readily available at the club for those who
get better medical effects that way.

And despite what you "imagine" about pot's effects on the lungs, there is
absolutely been no medical connection made between any long term lung
health effects and long term smoking.  Anecdotally, elder Rastas in Jamaica
who have smoked for decades show no additional cases of lung cancer or
emphysema.

Oh, and what have you seen, exactly?  When and where and how?  If you have
and think it's such a bad thing, go testify against him then, and stop
making public smears on the list (frankly, it's incredibly poor form to
make accusations of illegal behavior on this list anyway).  If it were
true, the government would have some credible allegations by now, given the
tens of thousands of dollars spent investigating the club.

The only way the government people got pot from the club, according to the
civil lawsuit, was to forge doctor's notes, and then staff a phony Doctor's
office with people confirming the recommendations.  In other words, the
club only gave pot to people with doctor's notes confirmed by the "doctor."
Hardly proof of what you're implying.  I also can't see why anyone would go
through the trouble of setting up a phony doctor's office just to get pot
at the club unless they were trying to entrap the club.

Stop telling me what I know.   My point was that if the club were a front
for a full-scale operation, it makes no sense from an economic point of
view, and there's no evidence of ill-gotten gains.  I've heard that people
with medical clearance sometimes buy pot for non-medical people for use
outside the club, which is their fraud, not Dennis'.  This happens with
lots of prescription drugs which have recreational uses .  i've also heard
of pot being used at the club during off-hours for non medical-uses, but I
have no idea where the pot came from.  I don't know what you know or have
seen, given your vague allegations.

You weren't lied to by the proposition.  It stands (and falls) on its own
language and judicial enforcement.

I'm not going to continue this thread, as it saddens me deeply to hear such
innuendo and vitriol thrown at someone who has helped thousands of sick
people in fact through the club for years.

Funny you should ask. E doesnt cause diabetes if thats what you mean, but
ive had type 1 for a year now, and am just getting back into raving. I used
to be quite a party girl all the way from industrial to mod to punk to goan
hard trance depending upon the mood of the era and my personal predelicitons.
Taking drugs on diabetes is hard. But only the first couple of times. Hell
if youre a diabetic then you know the scientific method of trial and error-
you employ it everytime you give yourself a shot and eat a meal. 
employ this same method for taking drugs. take small amounts, test your
sugar before and during and after. Unfortunately the first few times you do
it you arent allowed to forget that you are a diabetic (which is a drag) but
hell diabetes is a real character builder and for myself extracting a little
blood from my finger and giving myslef a corrective shot in a poorly lit 200
bpm dance enviornment on  two pills is easier that figuring out the ratio of
carbohydrate to insulin in my everyday meals!!
E is kinda tough, becuase it dyhydrates you big time, which is a problem for
diabetics, as dehydrated cells are terribly insulin resistant which in turn
makes then more dehydrated!!! So the dehydration ups your sugar -- I can
maintain a CONSTANT sugar if I dance all night (dancing lowers sugars, and
its not hard to do) and drink lots of water. ITs tricky though, end entirely
personal how it affects you. pot acid opiates- all the downers- produce
almost no effect but coke, e, speed, meth you must experiment with,
hopefully in a controlled setting before you try them in a club. (PS
sometimes its annoying to try and get insulin needles past security) 
make sure you have a friend round who knows the deal and can administer
glucagon if necessary. 
maybe you werent even asking for yourself, but heres my mouthful anyway:)
once you get it figured out, you can establish a routine (maybe you need to
not dance so much, maybe you need an extra shot at 6 am whatever maybe you
need to resist all those free lollipops)....so the hard work pays off and
eventually you can rave without obsessing about your blood sugar. Its weird
when youre a diabetic at a rave, everyone looks so carefree and healthy
(sucking on all those menthols) that it can feel a little alienating to have
a disease that you have to monitor. But diabetics need to live a life and
raving is worth it for me!!

this year, instead of giving up my bad habits, i resolve to cultivate
new ones.  i will try new drugs, and over-indulge in the ones i
already know and love, starting tonight.  i will dance harder, and
more often, despite the pain and stiffness i know i will suffer the
next day.  i will wear clothing that is inappropriate to my age and
station in life.  i will stay up all night on weekdays, and perform
poorly at work the next day.  i will post things to sfraves that are
non-rave related, and not label them as such.  i will continue to
smoke.  i wish ill tidings on those select few i consider my enemies. 
in fact, i resolve to actively seek to make their lives miserable if
at all possible, convenient, and untraceable.  i will give free reign
to my hormones, no matter what a slut people think i am.  i will
attend an orgy.  i will pay someone to spank me.  i will blow my
savings on things i don't really need, like a big, plush,
mid-seventies luxury sedan that will pollute the atmosphere and break
down regularly.  i will get a tattoo i will regret later.  i will
encourage others to behave similarly.  i will start my own religion.

love, messiah w

being a bit of a procrastinator, and also having been out of town till
yesterday, me and my friends find ourselves without tickets for cloud
factory, which seems to be the ug of choice this nye.  i could
probably enjoy myself at resolution, if it doesn't get busted, but i'm
curious what other options are available.  i've checked the calendar,
but little of the info there means much to me.  where's the good

Please, put this back into it's proper context, which was "So what if
Dennis Peron thinks all pot use is medical?"

No, last time I checked you needed a card which was $150 I believe.

Again, I was referring specifically to smoking.

Odd, the American Cancer Society "imagines" the same thing.

Again, I don't have to prove anything to you, or anyone else. I do know it
is happening, I have witnessed it, and unless the persons involved were
granted protection from prosecution, there is no way in hell I would give
specifics to you or anyone else.

The truth is not a smear, and really, you are the only person to question
that this is occuring. It isn't that big of a secret.

Normally, I would agree with you. However, the gravity of the situation,
and the people involved warrant speaking up. Some very misguided
folks are backing Dennis Peron as a canidate for governor. The man is not
fit to serve in any public office, IMO, and in order to explain why I feel
this, it is necessary to discuss the reasons I feel this way. And
unfortunately, those reasons are the illegal activities being conducted
by the CBC led by this man. Sorry, but if someone is going to run for
public office, then they entertain a whole different level of scrutiny.
And if you find that bad forum, deal with it.

With as sloppy as the CBC has been, I imagine they do.

Until they get an informant(if they do not have one or more already,) I
hardly find this suprising. 

And believe or not, I am very much for the legalization movement, and
don't want to see it fail. And because I don't want to see it fail, I
think Dennis Peron should be removed before the CBC damages the chances of
the movement any further.

Well, if you already know what is going on, then why are you asking me to
prove it?

Again, I cannot say. Ask yourself this though: Why would I lie? What
possible motivation could I have? It's not as if Dennis Peron pissed in my
wheaties when I was 12. My only "agenda" is to see that Dennis Peron is
not rewarded for lying to Californians, and to state my belief that the
best thing that could be done for the medical legalization movement is his
removal to prevent further and possibly irreperable harm to the ability of
the ill to obtain relief legally.

No, I was lied to by the people writing the proposition.

page C2

" The New Years Eve "rave" scheduled for Mayors Island, er, Treasure =
Island has been scaled back from what flyers promised. Permits only allow =
for 2000 revelers, thousands fewer than advertised. They must arrive by =
chartered bus. No fireworks, either. The Crueler ban however is on drugs =
and alcohol. A rave without Ecstasy?"

I want to go to this. Can anyone of the huge amount of people who must be =
involved in organizing this party confirm or deny this information? Can =
anyone supply any more details.

        Thanx Wayne, I have a sneaky suspicion that you are inferring to
the EDITED letter that they printed against my written consent.  If you
are, well then I just have this comment:

        Because I am a better person at heart than their entire
editorial staff combined, I am not going to let their veil, racist,
immature, unprofessional, and disrespectful actions get to me.  Or else
I would be giving them what they want.  Instead, Im just going to laugh
at the extent to which a major periodical will go to intentionally
slander a reader for nothing more than kicks.  Talk about lowlifes...
they aren't worth my breath.  Not only did they miss the entire point of
what I was commenting on, But their attempt at manipulating my words to
make me look bad has backfired on them 10 fold.  I have already received
100's of supportive calls from people that REALLY know me (including
xlr8r advertises, or should I say... ex-advertisers) and they have all
told me how much respect they have lost for this sell-out rag.  Xlr8r
has shown their true face, and its not pretty.  I predict that 1998 is
not going to be a very positive year for them.   They are digging their
own hole.... and I'm going to sit here and watch them bury themselves.

Keeping it Real... and Laughing at everything else...   Vlad

No, last time I checked you needed a card which was $150 I believe.
 -==--==-=-
the cards are not for sale but I'm sure you could buy one (illegally, of
course), for a while there was an on-site doctor who would charge you
$50-200 for a consultation where he would diagnose you though so you
hadf letter from your doctor

Again, I don't have to prove anything to you, or anyone else. I do know
it
is happening, I have witnessed it, and unless the persons involved were
granted protection from prosecution, there is no way in hell I would
give

think Dennis Peron should be removed before the CBC damages the chances
of

this is not going to happen without Dennis' OK, he keeps everything off
paper and is the guiding energy of the place, it's his life, love,
mission & home

<sniper>

> club, which is their fraud, not Dennis'.

<sniper>

UUUmmmm no

Dennis set this up, and, in fact, folks who disagree with him don't have
to work for him anymore (Biiyeee) One group has been ethically doing
delivery ever since the Church St daze of Buyer's Club.
Dennis knows exactly what's going on there, he's no fool or puppet.

again, I think he's being left alone because the authorities are leaving
well enough alone...for now.

he also has a prior record so he would go down fast and I don't think
anyone but Dan Lungren wants that

most folks concerned want to comfort the sick & dying; unfortunately
w/Dennis the illegal sales are a by-product but one that would occur in
another form anyway so why get so upset - so local authorities stay
away...for now.

luck seems to be holding out,

a happy new year from ben and iris, the two uk ravers who spent a wicked
summer dancing san franciscan style and had so much fun thanks to all you
sfravers

it's just gone midnight here, 1998 has begun. you still have a few hours to
go and are probably dancing your socks off right now while we sad kids sit
at home writing email :(

we didn't manage to get tickets to our favorite rave and because we're
actually both a bit ill, decided not to bother with anything else. so here
we are, listening to the tape of a new year's rave 3 years ago....

i hope you all have a good one tonight...and come to glastonbury in june

lots of love
iris and ben

POSTPONED until this Saturday. So IT WILL _NOT_ be happening tonight.

I just had an evil thought. We should all call the police tonight
and report a "big out of control drug and sex orgy" at so and
so address...fake ones of coarse, like the local 
safeway or something. We could have then chasing
so many wild geese that when they got a complaint about an actual 
party they wouldnt be able to respond due to the backlog of fake
complaints. And make the calls from a phone booth so they
cant be traced.

Sorry, im just upset about these "last minute cancelations"

Dear Patrick,

        It seems from your several recent messages that your real beef with
Dennis Peron is with what you see as his deceptiveness -- you "don't like
to be lied to," in your words.  But can't you see that any deception here
is a direct result of the criminalization of marijuana use, not of an
intent on his part to deceive the public?

        Say you've been engaging in an illegal activity and a cop stops you
to question you about it.  Are you going to tell the truth, knowing your
word one way or the other is the only evidence he has?  I don't think so!
Both of you may know you're lying, but it doesn't matter.  If you tell the
truth, he may feel obligated to bust you, whereas if you lie, he can't.  If
the Cannabis Buyer's Club is ignoring the letter of Proposition 215, then
they're in a similar situation.  When you're as visible as Dennis Peron is,
you can't publicly state that you're breaking or are intending to break the
law -- even an unconstitutional and illegal law against recreational drug
use -- without jeopardizing your ability to continue doing so.

        Frankly, I don't know whether the CBC is selling pot to people
without doctors' prescriptions or not.  I hope they are, and I hope they
continue to do so and get away with it.  Better that people have a safe and
reliable place to buy marijuana than that they risk being ripped off by
shady street dealers, or busted by undercover cops posing as dealers.

        I've read a lot of your posts during the times I've been on this
list Patrick, and even though I can at times find your tone uncivil (which
isn't to say I don't like you as a person; I do), I tend to agree with most
of your opinions.  On this issue though, you've lost me.  You remind me of
people who get mad at Bill Clinton for breaking numerous campaign promises
such as a big middle class tax cut after they voted for him.  What did they
expect?  If you rely on a Democrat to cut your taxes, you're a fool.  While
it would be nice if politicians kept their promises, people should know
enough not to believe what they say.  If you want the real story, look at
their records, look at who they associate with, look at what they do.

        I'm sorry, but anyone who tells me they were deceived by Dennis
Peron on the issue of marijuana I would regard as either naive or just
flinging charges around.  Dennis has stated openly and repeatedly over his
years as a public figure that he believes marijuana should be totally
legal, and what's more, the opponents of Proposition 215 publicized his
pro-legalization attitude and that of other 215 supporters during the
campaign in an attempt to discredit them.  Only someone paying virtually no
attention to the man or the issue would have been deceived into thinking he
was somehow going to change his beliefs and methods if 215 passed.

        Also I might add that the statement that all pot use is medical is
not as ridiculous as it seems, although leftjab's statement about some
marijuana use being more medical than other use is true.  We are learning
more and more about the mind-body connection, and how things like
depression and being stressed out can cause serious medical problems.
(Author and lecturer Deepak Chopra has some fascinating things to say on
this and related topics.)  The correlation between mental states and
physical health shows how occasional pot use could easily come under the
category of preventive health care.

        You say Dennis is not qualified to judge who would and would not
benefit medically from the use of pot because he is not a doctor.  But with
his long experience using and being around people who use pot, I'll bet he
has a hell of a lot more expertise in this area than the vast majority of
medical doctors -- foolish fish was dead-on right about the medical
monopoly in this country.

        And yes, I know what 215 says about needing a doctor's
prescription, but to me it's not an issue of what the law says, but what's
right and wrong.

        Ending the drug war is right -- it will save many lives every year
of people who are killed in drug-related violence due to illegality, many
of them young and healthy with their whole lives ahead of them.  We musn't
become so preoccupied with the suffering of medical marijuana patients that
we lose sight of the larger picture and throw away the chance to save more
lives and ease more suffering in the long run.

Yours in liberty,
                                       <<< Starchild >>>

Trust me, the last thing you want to do when a cop is asking you a question
is lie to them.  Lying to a police officer is a felony, having a small
amount of pot on you is a citation at worst, and unless you're a REALLY
good liar, it's going to come out, the cop's going to be pissed, and any
chance you had for on-the-spot clemency is shot.

Just ask the folks who helped throw a recent underground in SF that got
busted.  The promoter of the party was in the crowd but refused to step
forward when the cops arrived due to sound complaints.  The cops, pissed
that no one was coming forward, decided to confiscate the equipment -
somebody had to have owned at least the equipment, and those who did
stepped forward, and one was arrested.  A far worse outcome than if the
promoter had simply stepped forward and handled the cop situation directly.

I'm sure you're not really as dim as this sentence suggests.

Even if it means the state government, or the feds (who can simply declare
that 215 doesn't apply to federal regulations on narcotics, which has been
upheld by the Supreme Court before) comes in and shuts down the CBC
permanently, voids 215, and ends up closing other medical marijuana
dispensaries around the state?  Is that really a better option than the
alternative, which is that the dispensaries stay open and truly sell only
to those with a legit notice from a doctor?  Do you think that /won't/
happen if the CBC isn't hardened up?

If you read the newspaper, you'll see that both Governor Wilson and Dan
Lungren recognize that 215 is a mandate from the public to license medical
marijuana dispensaries, and that they are prepared to carry that out.  It
might be with a conservative interpretation of 215, but that's better than
nothing.

Since you're a big fan of analogies, let me give a few that I think
illustrate why Patrick's ire is up:

1) Recent tax cuts which were promoted as being "pro-middle-class" because
they gave an extra $500 tax deduction for children, yet also contained
staggering cuts in capital gains and estate taxes.  Overall those with
greater than $150K in household income fared far better than those with
less than $150K.  

2) "Desert Storm" - ostensibly to "restore democracy and autonomy to
Kuwait", yet clearly it was for the purpose of protecting American oil
interests.  Democracy in Kuwait or Saudi Arabia?  Laughable.  Human rights?
 What are those?

3) Recent "fines" levied on big tobacco manufacturers by the feds and
several states; while they sounded staggering (over $1Billion), they are
actually a boon for these companies because it exempts them from liability
from all other class-action lawsuits, *and* it allows them to deduct those
payments from their business taxes directly.  It's a giant shell game - the
public has been conned into thinking "yeah, we showed 'em!" yet the
cigarrette makers were hardly affected.  

In all three cases it's the government lying to the people.  In this case,
it's an "outside" group lying to the people.  To me, each is deplorable, no
matter how transparant it is.

Dennis has been knowingly puffin' smoke in any direction needed to be
able to continue his sales. IMO he's also doing WAY cool public service
so many folks don't give a big rip. But don't cloud over the facts, he
doesn't want too many to know that he has thousands of untaxed
unaccountable CASH going through his club every day it's open.

I agree with most everything you've stated, well put, right on! etc.

I think we all agree that there is some f**ked up laws that effect us
and the entire drug war needs to be re-aligned with common sense &
reality...

the point is the long-term goals and how many folks are not sure what to
do about his F**K the laws I'm going to do what I'm doing attitude and
waiving (mainly) AIDS patients in the face of anyone who disagrees

A lot of good has come out of the work Dennis has done, the concern has
always been that his sloppy disregard for how to run the
service/self-policing and providing to those not covered under the law
will keep at risk the people who are actually sick and will die without
pot.

Each time the club has been shut down the patients are the ones that
suffer. You probably won't get many to go on record against him because
they are the same people that need him every so often. It's like living
with a corrupt sherriff - you need the relationship to remain even
though things are kinda screwy.

IMO he dis-credits all the folks who are doing research & education (and
yes legislation) and have to work twice as hard to be accepted for the
work they do (and unfortunately just distance themselves from him).

thanks for the additional information... I was aware of it.
certainly, it takes longer to take effect orally.. just like *any* pill...
15-20 min if it doesn't have an enteric coating on it... like most
ibuprophen for example...

my point was, that *growing* and *selling* marijuana really doesn't have to
have anything to do with the legalization of it for medical use.  The fact
that an orally ingested  pill will take effect later, and *longer* leads me
to believe it would be the preferred perscription by doctors.  

Not, find a drug dealer, buy some sticky greens.. and smoke up at least 3
times a day for meals, eat an apple if you get the munchies.... oh, and
don't get any of the funky mexican browns, it's stony, but that's not what
i'm perscribing.

peace,
-SolR
