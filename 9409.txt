Ya knows, all this fog talk has really gotten me paranoid.  I am afraid I 
won't be welcome at the next F&F if I am going to be doomed to grow 
moldy.  Laura, am I the right kind of fog?  I don't want to be getting 
everyone sick, now.

Speaking of Star Alley, lately they seem to have really gotten it
together. They've got most things opened for listening now, they've
reorganized things a *lot* better, and they've been buying lots of
good music (well, I've been finding great stuff there lately).

The way they used to do things really bugged me, and I complained, and
they must have listened or something, because they've fixed most of it
(they still need 1200s instead of those antiques though). Anyway, I
like what they've done, so I thought I'd make a plug for them.

Most foggers use water-glycerin fog (which is why it tastes sweet).
Glycerin is somewhat viscous, and when you breathe in enough, it's
going to gum up your lungs a bit. No biggie for most people, and maybe
a biggie for those with breathing problems.

Something wierd has been happening with my sfraves filter ever since 
sfr switched homes.  A lot of mail doesn't seem to pass through my
filter but ends up in my regular mailbox.  This wasn't really a problem
because the volume wasn't great but when I logged on this time 90%
of the "Pronoia Projection" thread was in my inbox.  That was kinda
annoying.  In the past all mail from Tenderloin Waxx, and some from
Brian Behlendorf and Tony Garcia ended up in my regular box.  What
I noticed about the pronoia stuff was that all the mail was 
"Cc:" to sfraves.  Could this be the reason?  I haven't made any changes
to my filter (I wouldn't know how if I tried) and the only change
has been the moving of sfr.  Anyway, if anyone can help me clean
this up I'd be grateful.

BTW, the location announcement for the Burning Man breakfast will be 
posted on an actual cork bulletin board at the campsite not on a
computer bulletin board.  Just to clear up the confusion...  Can't
wait, 24 hours and counting. :)

Thanks.

Yeah, you would think that someone whose identity was given to them
by a magazine or advertising agency would be a little less arrogant...
I mean can't anyone think up anything themselves anymore?  What the
*fuck* is up with that shit?  Can't you recognize corporate aesthetics
when you see them?  Why are you so ready to carry someone else's flag,
especially when all they are trying to do is to establish you as a
captive audience?  Don't be a sucker!

get procmail.  (you may already be using it.)  it works great.

my .procmailrc includes, among other things:

:0:
* ^TOsfraves
sfraves

and magically everything is totally groovy.  this catches mail to
sfraves-planners as well, btw, and doesn't care if 'sfraves' is in the
to: or cc: field.

(note that if the second line read '* ^To: sfraves' anything which had
'sfraves' in the cc: field but not in the to: field would end up in
your mail mailbox.  the ^TO is a euphemism for checking a whole slew
of fields, including X-Sender: and other nuveau trendy fields like
that.  basically it ends up working the way you think it should.)

procmail is capable of insanely complicated and wildly useful
behavior, too.  (funny how those two things are often found together.)

yowsa,
Bob

The people I'm currently going with aren't leaving until tomorrow night.
I'd like to leave tomorrow afternoon.  If you're near the South Bay
(Milpitas) or it's on your way out, and you're leaving at that time,
and you have room for a guy with some drums, mail me (grigsby@agames.com).

I will, of course, pitch in for gas/music/etc.  You can also leave a
message at 408.434.1762

See you all there!

Ok ok ok.  I just have to ask.  WHAT IS THIS CRAP AND WHY IS IT IN MY MAILBOX??

I thought this list was to talk about raves, and things relating to raves,
specifically in the bay area.  LAST I CHECKED anyway.

This "zippy" spew is obnoxious and stupid and downright vapid babbling.
I didn't think I'd ever have to start a killfile for my MAILBOX, too.

For a group that is supposed to be spreading "happiness" you sure do a 
wonderful job of doing the opposite.

Tess, would you please stop spamming the list with this stuff?  Whether 
not I agree with your statements is beside the point.  It is not related 
to raves in the bay area--the reason I am on this list and the reason the 
list exists.  I noticed that your messages have been cc'd to many 
different people, so could you please just send the messages to those 
individuals?

Thanks in advance.


	Sami

This is sort of off-topic, marginally relevant but for those of you going 
to Burning Man, there will be some home movies!

I have installed a filter in majordomo to bounce to me any message the words
"z!ppy", "z!ppies" or "prono!a" appear in, though admittedly it doesn't catch
everything.  Again, that account has been suspended indefinitely.  So sad to
give a group a chance and see them squander it. BTW, it should be noted that
the group creating such ill will are Americans who were not involved with the
movement before the Wired article was published and certainly not at the time
the article was being researched, and who upon commencement in America of
their "tour" split off from their only source of legitimacy, Fraser Clark
(say what you will).  I gave them the benefit of the doubt and offered
assistance initially - I don't consider that a mistake, I'd do it again for
another group.

Well, I've been reading alt.culture.zippies since it was newgrouped and
the Z!ppies rarely appear there.  Yet, here they are on sfraves spamming
away with . . . whatever it is.

Anyway, since they don't seem to read netnews, and since a lot of my 
sfraves aquaintences don't read net news either, I'm reposting two 
rather "telling" articles concerning the Grand Canyon . . . whatever it
was.

Subject: World Unity Festival

Can any attendees comment on the WUF fiasco? The z!ppy group seems to be
off-line. The Phoenix news media made a big deal about how the area
would have to be quarantined because cleanup crews were afraid of
"catching AIDS from discarded hypodermic needles." Arizona will probably
never be ready for world unity, it's just a nice place to go camping.
Even the Hopis kicked out festival goers! As for myself, I went to
San Diego that weekend.

Newsgroups: alt.culture.z!ppies
Subject: I went to Flagstaff "In Order To Dance"

I had 2 reasons to go there:
a.  For the last 3 years 98% of the music that I listenned to was TT&A
(TechnoTrance&Ambient),
b.  Three of my French friends who live for travelling and going to TT&A
parties were going there.

I left NYC on the 20th and had to be back on the 27th.

On the 21st we slept in this Navajo owned land 3 hours drive north of
Flagstaff.  The next morning we understood more about the "World Unity
Festival" (I still didn't get the difference between the "World Unity
Festival" and the "Rainbow Gathering"; anyway...).  It was a bunch of
hippies (do not read in a pejorative way) and others meeting to celebrate
"World Unity".  I would say that about 400 people were there on that
Tuesday.  We asked around for any info on Z!ppies or techno party and got
no positive response.  The organization was almost inexistent so we
decided to head north and see some natural beauties and look for the
Z!ppies by ourselves.

On the 25th at 8PM we got the following message on a Z!ppies' answering
machine of the West coast: "... we're on tonight ... with a small sound
system ... (plus explanations on how to get to the place)".

At 12AM we were a little more than an hour west of Flagstaff.  The place
seemed nicer than the first one.  The same kind of people were there
(Hippies, dead heads, bohemians, gitans, Krishnas...) but still no trace
of Z!ppies =(.  There was a 130bpm beat in the nearby forest though.  We
walked over and found a very precarious DJ installation with two
campground fires and a stromboscope (less cool than it sounds;)).  My
friends new the DJ from Goa (Gil ("Goa" Gil as he calls himself in SF));) 
He was DATing (spinning from DATs) some 6 month to 1 year old "Progressive
Trance" (which is Goa specialty; the finest if you ask me).  30 people
were dancing, 20 were sitting around the fires.  Some interesting people
not aggressive like the hippies (yes that's what I found about the hippies
of this World Unity Festival (Re:"Z!ppies: Please stay away!" above)) but
not Z!ppies either.

The next day (26th) some serious sound system arrived.  Some Z!ppies too
among them Fraser Clark who is suppose to the "Da Man";).  Some less than
zero rock played from 7PM to 9:30PM when Gil strated DATing again.  About
50 people were there and my friends and myself were the only four persons
(and believe me I looked all around) who were ready for a "four days rave"
as it was advertized in several zines all over the western world (Wired,
Actuel(in France), and many others mostly techno and underground zines). 
I forgot to mention that it had started raining around 6:30PM.  Gil DATed
until 4 or 5AM.  We were sleeping very close to the stage and I woke up
several times.  The music was very good (my rating:17/20) but only 10
people were still around.

I left the next morning for NYC and I haven't heard much about this
"200,000 people Megarave", as I had read before going, since.

I e-mail the guy who wrote Wired article.

and in a way, I feel I should have never participated in it.  One thing I 
have learned from  SuperDuperRavers <sfraves@hyperreal.com> is that I do 
not agree with everyone's opinion on it.  There are even people on the 
net that I feel almost throw a negative energy into our discussion 
groups, which I have a tendency to forget and just engross myself in 
their negativity.  For me, it's almost like eating french fries, and I 
just feel the need to keep responding to these people that are just not 
ready to sit back and flow with life as part of the universe (whatever 
boundaries, if any there are).  Next time, I will try even harder to 
resist the temptation to fight fire with fire ( or more newspaper ).  But 
Brian, I must thank you for taking the one step that was really needed.  
I will stand in my chair and clap for 10 seconds (well, not in my chair, 
in front of it), and I recommend anyone that wants to do the same.  Maybe 
with the synchronous energy, we can "keep the negative energy out" like 
garlic is supposed to ward off evil spirits.  Is that stuff 
superstition?  I don't know.  

compound your energy.

I'm going to be taking a trip in late october to santa fe and wanted
   to know who to contact about the scene down there - seems to me that
   raving is the ideal way to break away from a conference and to get
   outdoors amid the hoopla...

Man, that's amazing.  you guys kicked off the z!ppy dude because you
were annoyed with his posts.

you guys won!  now we are back to our old happy selves, right?
 
I think that's pretty fucked up, to be  honest.

just my two cents...

wonder when I am going to be admonished for not capitolizing the first

You know, I would much rather try to decrypt one of those pronia
messages than see a bunch of people Whining about "What's this doing in
my mailbox?" I liked the message.  I liked it a lot more than I like
the messages that reprint someone else's entire message--with headers--
and then say "you're right dude" or "right on, man!" or whatever.

It's all about expression.  If you don't like it, lift your finger (I 
know, apparently it's difficult) and press "d".

isn't this place supposed to be about change and harmony and relating
information and experience and all that?  Whining about the pronia messages
reminds me of the many reasons so many people left this list awhile ago..

Well, I don't know if this is a recommendation but I was going to go to
Groove Kitchen which sounds like it could be a blast.  Unfortunately mother
nature got the best of me...a nasty cold (in the middle of summer #@?*!!!).
And of course nurse "Broom Hilda" recommends rest and many horrid bat-wing
potions.
Hope everyone has a wild and safe weekend...

It's a long story.  That's all I can say.  

A better explanation is that Pincus violated my faith in him to use 
hyperreal's resources appropriately.  He became the new-age equivalent of 
Cantor and Seigel.

away from the marina :) ).

DJs, on two sound systems:
   ambient -> dance -> trance
      Scottie & Whitsitt, M & Ovid (quantum ambient visualization),
      Tracy, Galen, Bonny
   all-night ambience:

  and of course some surprises... 

All ages, free.

Bring toys, fruit, drums, bean bags, something for the altar, 
smiles and friends

						hope to see y'all there,
						gregg

Actually, my understanding is that brian decided to end his *subsidization*
of them.  There is nothing stopping that person from rejoining sfraves
with their *own* account.  They were using a hyperreal account brian gave 
them for free.  Hyperreal costs $ to run, and brian gives free accounts out
with the understanding that the users will make a positive contribution to 
some aspect of the hyperreal environment.  Other than a handful of gifs in
the z*ppy WWW dir, my observations tell me that they have used the
hyperreal account as a mainly disruptive force here in the hyperreal
world.  Contract broken, contract ended.  

I do agree that the z*ppy filter is a bit heavy-handed if not downright
silly.  And truthfully, we've had people spew stuff that was far more 
negative without being thrown off the list for it.  I was actually 
starting to find them amusing in a perverted kind of way.

What we do is to ascribe negative motivation to neutral or even positive 
messages.  When we do so, others are quite right to comment "Had a bad 
day, Ken?" in reply. 

The best way to reduce negativity is to simply assume the best possible 
motivation on the part of everyone else.

[ Which does not necessarily mean the action taken is any different - I 
agree with the action taken by Brian. ]

There once was a Z!ppy named Pincus
Who created an SFRaves stinkus.
   With his posts of inanity
   We all lost our sanity
And exterminated him like a rat finkus.

I agree about one line posts in general, much less with more 
copied text than original.

BUT i think you hit the key right on the nose with
"I liked the message." 

i would agree with that had it been that
THE message. Any one of those would have done. And i might have said that.

But i see it as being analgous to going into a public area
and repeatedly yelling random comments. (No.. not the repeated
mumbling comments of people along telegraph :) So that the only
way to block them out is to cover your ears or walk away.

This is something that i think is important to keep in mind for
raving because our parties are someone elses Pronoia posts.
We have to be respectful of other people when doing stuff.

> It's all about expression.  If you don't like it, lift your finger (I 
> know, apparently it's difficult) and press "d".

A kind of extended version of the above is realizing that 
different people have different experiences.  While you may merely
have to press a "d" key (which i do as well) other may have to scroll
through their messages and cant jump to the next one. 
(as i found a coworker doing today, before i said 
'Man.. type pine or elm or SOMETHING!' :)
OR even worse the could have compu$erve or some such account
and have to pay for messages.

> isn't this place supposed to be about change and harmony and relating
> information and experience and all that?  Whining about the pronia messages
> reminds me of the many reasons so many people left this list awhile ago..

and whining about whining about whining messages are even worse...:) :)
but i guess i missed the exodus,when was that?

seriously.. i dont want to come off sounding preachy
like i have said the "just hit 'd'" line many times
and like i have posted shit that was less coherent than pinkus...
im just pointing out things that i often need to remind myself

1) First and foremost - That mumbo jumbo *did not* belong in this folder -
period.

If you need a refresher on what this folder is all about resubscribe
yourself to the list and a full 3 page description shall follow.  But just
in case you don't want to go thru all that, here is the very basics as it
appears on page 1:

          ***PLEASE READ THIS***
This mailing list is dedicated to discussion involving the rave/underground
club/techno scene now developing here in the Bay Area.


2) He can easily start his own list.  Only one posting here would have
sufficed if he wanted some followers of sfraves into his "cult".  There was
no reason to inundate hyperreal with short sayings/paraboles.

Regards

Denis,  ravnbird@crl.com

Well, the fire marshal's come and gone twice now, and we've talked to two
lawyers, at least two journalists and a whole lotta other concerned folk
about our situation. (I can't believe I skipped Burning Man for this!)
Information seems to change more rapidly than I can type it, so in lieu of
an exhaustive report I'd just like to take this opportunity to invite
everyone down to our General Meeting on Tuesday, September 6 at 7 pm at
Komotion (2779 16th Street, San Francisco).


The following are among the topics we expect to discuss:


-Legal Status: What the fire department has to say about our activities and why.

-September Shows: The outlook for a September 24 Friends & Family party is
grim.  
 We've already cancelled four shows so far. The remaining live shows may have to
 be moved, cancelled or scaled down on a case-by-case basis.

-Smaller Shows: Our legal occupancy for regularly scheduled "parties" is 49.
 This means the bulk of our bookings will have to be of a more intimate variety,
 i.e. live recordings, acoustic nights, one-band "showcases," etc.

-The Big Shows: Looks like we will be able to get away with the occasional big
 bash, as long as we go with strictly underground promotion (i.e. no ads, few
 flyers, mostly word-of-mouth). If there's interest, we'd like to make a go of
 Friends & Family again around Halloween.

-Modifications: As it turns out, our landlord may be hiring a contractor for
 routine seismic upgrades soon. We may be able to cut a deal with the contractor
 to put in a third exit and/or a sprinkler system. More on this as it develops.

-Off-site benefits: We've already sunk a chunk of money into recent repairs and
 legal fees, not to mention lost show revenue (both current and projected). We
 will be staging a series of benefit concerts at other locations, including the
 Bottom of the Hill in S.F. and possibly 924 Gilman Street in Berkeley. If
 anyone has any leads on putting together any ravey-housey benefits at an
 alternate location, please get in touch.


Again, thanks to everyone who's offered suggestions, practical info etc. 
The value of the support we've received from the list community is
immeasurable.

Hope to see y'all on Tuesday.

Not every action of this sort is censorship. In this case it was
a repeated misuse of this forum. One has to draw the line somewhere
regarding apprpriate use. If not, why not just move all the Usenet
groups to sfraves? In my opinion, the Z!ppies crossed that line
repeatedly and ignored people's pleas to stop posting their unrelated
stuff.

There seem to be some egos and agendas flying around here rampantly
since when are simple thoughts and simple words to be so out of context 
so quickly on sfraves?  What's Going on here?
When you look at the responses, half liked them, half did not, so why did 
the half that did not like the voice gain sway?
What about those who liked the voice? They are seldom as vocal.
Also, what did PRONOIA CENTRAL do wrong? It Flamed back those who flamed 
it, and responded in kind to those who were interested.
What Faith was broken, I believe we all have a right to know.  An act 
that cuts off anyone's ability to communicate just because one doesn't 
like the UNCOMMUNICATIVE NATURE OF THE COMMUNICATION?
Sounds Like any alien from outer space would be kicked off of sfraves 
also, and by the way, didn't the zippies put on two of their own 
events in San Francisco?  One called the jupiter bash at a warehouse 
close to where SPAZ used to hold their night, didn't they host a 
SPAZ party, didn't they put on the first performance publishing 
event at the Crash Palace in San Francisco, where they had the 
computers up on stage and live internet on stage as the main 
event?
Of course the zippies are not from San Francisco, and by default their 
continued presence on sfraves would not be intimitely related to the 
sfrave scene, because they are no longer in the sfbay area.  Pronoia 
Central did not utter one foul word, It responded strongly to the foul 
words of our own community.  Since when does a few words from Pronoia Central
become noise and objectionable spewing especially considering what some 
of us ourselves are also thus guilty of.  Is it not the nature of rave to 
have perhaps enticing or vague information?   We do it continuously 
whenever we put on a rave as a sfcommunity, we put out verbal feelers also.
Given that I had put out those words as a member of this sfcommunity, 
since I'm not a zippy, would you have tolerated me?  I can't believe I am 
even asking a question like this.  Ettiquete? Netiquette? For the sake of 
a few self-proclaimed grumps, and verbal objectors, why Brian, did you 
remove all the capabilities of PRONOID individuals like ggoff and reidf 
from MANIFESTING THEIR LIFE POEM at Hyperreal.  Who was Pronoia central?
And How many of us would like to see it back?  Why did you, brian destroy 
what many including yourself were in the process of creating.  Seems as 
though you were being paranoid, conspiring behind their backs to harm 
them, and harm them publically.  You keep talking that the Zippies should 
have come forward in front of all of us before the event at VIVID 
PRONOIA, and that everythin should have been done publically.  What did 
you just do? you removed their ability to communicate and put down your 
and a few other's word that they broke faith with you.  You removed their 
ability to communicate with us and our ability to communicate with them.  
You're no different than Pincus, I'm no different than Pincus None of us 
are really any different than any of the Zippies. when I saw them they 
were hungry and determined to help.  They drove their van right though 
the police lines unnoticed to deliver food for Food Not Bombs.  They all 
gave up all their jobs and apartments left loved ones behind to go out on 
tour across the states for two months, not knowing what would happen, but 
spreading pronoia, real pronoia, actively thinkiing and figuring how to 
help others around them, why else did people keep putting them up, all 11 
of them up in their homes.  Sure they could be lousy house guests,  11 of 
anyone would be a lousy house guest scenario.  They have a right to a 
voice, and especially to the voice you gave them Brian.  Nothing short of 
premeditated physical murder on their parts would warrant removing their 
voice.  Besides what about the other Zippies, or non-zippies, forget the 
labels, they were and are some of the most creative and industrious 
individuals and simultaneously the simplest and quitest and spaciest  and 
smelliest and rudest and whatever else you want.  WWhat right did you 
have to take away their freedom of speech?  Some of Us would like to talk 
to the zippies that did not have a chance to talk to us on the net 
through Pronoia Central,  from what I have witnessed so far, each 1 of 
the 11 is as different and contradictory and interesting as I am, which 
says the same for any and all of us on any net commuinity.  Whaat about 
the link to POSITIVE VIBE GENERATORS? why did you remove that from 
Pronoia Central, and what are you intimating by filtering mail with the 
word Zippy or Pronoia, what  are you doing?  Sit back and Consider the 
nature of your censorship.  Give them back Their voice.  Be True to your 
own commitment to equal public availability and access.  No 
individual or group of individuals becomes worthless just because you 
Brian and a few others say so.  What Reidf Did by presenting the Yogi and 
The Saint was interesting.  Brian, what you did was peurile, lacked 
creativity, and belies your training, skill, and discipline as an 
information throughput facilitator.  You Brian of all should have 
remained staunchly neutral.  Guiding the events to proper public 
representation.  It is expected that you Brian will do so immediately.
Do not play with life or the living.  Do not create the dead. Manifest 
human, for that is what you are.

directing traffic should not be cold and authoritative
it should not be an outline

intelligence and wit applied in a positive manner 
is my best advice - this is what I might pay attention
to in any conversation

also, I like the occasional lifted usenet post
if one of our esteemed community members feels that
an article is worthy of posting here it probably is

Two things:

Has anyone heard the new Pop Will Eat ITself EP, Amalgamation?  Besides some
great tunes of their rap/metal/punk/techno styling, they have 2 or 3 ambient
type songs, 2 of which stick out in my mind as being VERY good: C.P.I. #2 and
Intense.  It's a *GREAT* cd, and I recommend it to anyone with an open mind.

Second, at Pure Space (Which Twitch played at and impressed the hell out of
me), I picked up a flyer with the following info on it:

Dreamtime
DJ's
Dutch, Carlos, Das, Corbin
Saturday September 10th
415.789.8468

The guy who gave it to me was groovy indeed.

Yep, it's the beginning of September, one month since I was last told 
that Everett Zero would get Susan's video projector out of storage and 
return it to us. We have sent pages, left messages; we have done 
everything within our power that we could without resorting to public 
forum again, with no result. 
So would E. Zero's staunch defender Kerry please attempt to contact him 
again? He has done nothing so far to resolve this except make you look 
foolish for defending him.
Any and all info that will help take care of this with a minimum of 
ugliness would be deeply appreciated... 

If anyone out there knows this guy, ask him if he would give us a call. 
Let's resolve what should be a rather trivial affair to the benefit of us 
all.

Many thanks in advance,

Maui & Susan

Aha! A chance to make a positive contribution for my first message to
the list.

According to the Burning Man newsletter I have the Burning Man burns
at sunset Sunday night (Sept. 4). Maybe next year I'll make it there.

All valid criticisms, given what transpired on the list itself.  But 
there is more to my suspension of Pincus's account on hyperreal than that.
The account was created as a favor from me to Pincus who had complained about
not having the means by which to communicate.  I said it would be 
provided in the context of creating a meaningful Zippie archive on hyperreal
and in communicating to others on the net who expressed interest (the 
opposite of which is known as "spamming").  I also said I couldn't be 
available for Unix consulting - I pointed out "pine" and "trn" - and
that I strongly suggested that he and others working with him first
establish a presence on the most appropriate forum, alt.culture.zippies,
and then work with other members of hyperreal who had offered to help
create the WWW site.

After this, the Santa Cruz party took place, and the group calling
themselves the "Zippy Pronoia Tour to US" (including pincus) split off
from Fraser Clark. At this time I feel I would have been justified in
removing pincus's account, as I had lost a lot of confidence in this
group's ability to use hyperreal's resources.

A month later, no contact made with alt.culture.zippies, no effort
spent at creating a WWW site, and spamming of the sfraves mailing
list.  As owner of hyperreal.com I made an executive decision, a
decision I was hoping I'd never have to make, and which will affect
my eagerness at offering generosity in the future.

Yes, but the discourse of late wasn't relevant to this.  To the extent
that they only attended their own parties, I consider them as much a
part of the SF rave scene as any other visiting performer or DJ.  I
have a feeling the faction of zippies led by Fraser Clark will
actually be much more integrated to the scene, so we'll see.

Pincus has had a long history of sending purposefully obscure and
pseudomystical messages with no relevance to anything.  He sent 7
messages in quick succession to the list.  He has been warned by me
about this before.  We often do have people like this - yet usually
after awhile they get a clue.  Pincus didn't.  While he may think that
bandwidth and consideration for the other 386 members of sfraves
aren't important, I do.  If everyone, or even a small number, of other
members were to contribute in the same manner as Pincus had, I'd make
sfraves a moderated mailing list.  Which is essentially what I did
when I turned the filters on (which are now off - still a few messages
to forward, I will soon).

Netiquette is exactly what wasn't being observed in this case.  Of
course we would have tolerated you, as we tolerated Pincus for two
months.  But eventually even the worst cases learn netiquette.

Greg Goff and Reid Fossey still have hyperreal accounts.  There is still
a lot that can be done in the same vein as what the Zippies wanted to do.

> Who was Pronoia central?

An account shared by Pincus and Reid, now Reid has the account to himself.

In a sense, I did it to save them from becoming even more of a mockery
of themselves,though that would admittedly be hard to do.  Pincus and
the faction known as "Zippy Pronoia Tour to US" are NOT the only 
Zippies, and not the only online Zippy group, either.  	I have become
disillusioned with that faction's activities of late, and decided to
stop my subsidation of their efforts.

Diverging interests.  They've managed to harm a few other people, one
elderly man in particular, in public.

They lost my subsidation of their efforts.  They are welcome to get a
netcom account, communicate through you, etc.  If they start spamming
SFRaves again I'll take the same measure I'd take against any group
spamming the public lists I run.  I would *not* consider communicative
posts spamming.  I would consider pseudomystical irrelevant
blatherings spamming.  Note that: I would consider pseudomystical
*relevant* messages acceptible.  If your problem is that it's an
arbitrary decision on my part, you're damned right, it is.  I'm sure
netcom would allow pincus to start and run his own mailing list if he
so desired, though as I've said too many times alt.culture.zippies is
a totally appropriate place for it.

I have not stopped my subsidation of other more active Zippy-related
groups.

Though the above seems like a nonsequitor, I'll admit to their passion
for their endeavor.

Well, when you invest time and effort to set up a site and can grant
accounts to people who do everything except threaten you with murder,
get back to me.  I guess this is just where we have a difference of opinion.
I went *very* far to avoid having to take back my generosity.  And it
was *not* an easy decision.

Netcom's only $17.50 a month - 408-554-UNIX.  There are dozens, if not
100's, of Internet public account systems in the bay area.  Also, the
group in the "Zippy Pronoia Tour to US" own the name zippy.org (which
I helped them register) and when they get their own machine or have a
site willing to be a domain alias I'll be happy to do name service for
them.

Pincus always claimed he was only representing himself.  I have not seen
any of the other 11 on the net so I cannot speak for them either.

Reid still has his account (in addition to his netcom one, hint hint)
and is being quite active in that regard.

It was an attempt to get a handle on the spamming and responses to it in
the short term.

I have suggested totally viable alternatives.  What I instituted was

The "throughput facilitator" to do his/her job effectively must lay
down ground rules for the communication that goes over it - I can send
email from my machine to yours at Berkeley because both our machines
talk TCP/IP for example.  I laid down some very loose ground rules,
the same rules that are a part of the sfraves list, the Internet, and
the terms of my trust in his ability to use his account wisely.  We
had a social seg fault, and core was dumped.

Is this a death threat?  Good thing you don't have a hyperreal account. :)

Listen, I appreciate the passion involved here.  That is the hardest
part about my decision.  But passion without guidance turns into
friction.  I did what I had to so that friction wouldn't burn holes in
the list or to hyperreal.

I won't quote the (lengthy) post but will just add my two cents worth.
Brian doesn't have to give them an account. If they want an account they
can pay for it. Then you can contact them all you want.
I found the Zippies to be a group that puts out alot of hyped-up media 
propoganda and just gloms themselves onto other peoples events (or whatever 
is hip at the moment) for their own self-serving publicity.
I personally found the posts to be meaningless and annoying. Like psycobabble.
I did not appreciate slogging through all the litter to read the gems.
Also sfr is not the only list I'm on and I already get a ton of mail.

I heard from richard sun that the grand canyon rave has turned sour.
That the Indians unplugged them and then frazer clark replugged them.
In act of bad faith after act of bad faith The zippies are living pinheads
and seem to enjoy delivering dada to all. When you take the dada route 
you should expect someone to kick you in the teeth. Its part of the game.

I read an article in paper about the zippies which seemed to be just an 
article gleaned from other articles about something in the spirit of 
woodstock aniversary bullshit. They have issued flyers about an Oct 1st 
MEGATRIPOLIS...The hippies hate the zippies like they hate ravers? so far 
that is the only thing ravers and zippies have in common.

Arrived here on Thursday from Seattle.  Walked by the 
Palladium, which was playing Erasure, and got told by a group 
of people hanging out in front that "nobody plays techno in San 
Francisco, why do you want to listen to that shit, techno is 
out here, you have to go to san jose".  I hope this is not 
true, because I am living near the financial district and I 
have no car.

Anyway, I need to know

1) Where are the underground record stores?  I like stuff that 
comes out on Tresor, FAX, and R&S.

2)  Where are the clubs that play the stuff I like?  I like 
higher BPMs than house music, but I could settle for house if 
that is truly all there is in the city here...

3)  Where can I find cheap net access?  I used to have my own 
PPP account but down here everyone wants to charge by the hour. 
 Where can I get a cheap shell acct or unlimited PPP?  I am 
less than thrilled with hooked.

Anyway, guess this is changing the topic away from the zippies, 
but I don't know one single person in San Francisco, so...

mccoy@hooked.net

oh yeah, anyone from Choate or UPENN or Seattle down here?

Welcome to San Francisco.  I moved here in January from New York City and 
have experienced many frustrations.  

>"nobody plays techno in San 
>Francisco, why do you want to listen to that shit, techno is 
>out here, you have to go to san jose".  

Nobody BIG who the major party organizers/promoters book for the bigger 
clubs and parties plays techno.  Jeno, Garth, Markie Mark, Spun, and 
others in the top echelon of local just aren't into techno it seems.  

There seems to be some conception that the harder faster stuff is for the 
kiddies.  For a while SF had very strict caberet laws that effectively 
divided the party scene into under and over 21.  When techno was played, 
it was mostly at the all ages parties; meanwhile, many in the over-21 crow 
tend to avoid the all ages or so-called "kiddie" events.   People used to 
remark to me "techno is for speed freaks."  So that's a sampling of some 
of the attitude. :-( .  HOWEVER, I've seen that this is changing slowly.  
If anything SFRaves is a hotbed of technophiles (if such a thing can be 
said to exist in SF).  If you hang out here you'll find the techno.

You can find techno at some of the smaller clubs and parties, and at some 
renegade parties, too.  Look for names like Goa Gill, Ethan, HDW, 
Planet-6, Deaks, and DRC.  I spin on occasion, too.  Parties to watch out 
for include SPAZ, Test, Your Sister's House, Friends and Family, and Liquid 
Air.  (F&F and LA are on haitus right now while we sort out some space/site 
problems).

>1) Where are the underground record stores?  I like stuff that 
>comes out on Tresor, FAX, and R&S.

Well, there used to be Gaia Mantra, but I heard that they have recently 
closed up shop.  You could take the BART out to Berkeley and go to 
Rasputnin's on Telegraph.  Deaks and I have both resorted to mail order.  
If you look around, you can find a few tracks here and there, I've had 
good luck at Star Alley (look it up in the phone book since I don't know 
the address).

>2)  Where are the clubs that play the stuff I like?  I like 
>higher BPMs than house music, but I could settle for house if 
>that is truly all there is in the city here...

As far as I know the only place is SPAZ, which is held at 60th 6th Street 
on Friday nights.  There might be others, the best bet is to watch out for 
the sfraves calendar which is published to this list every Thursday.

>3)  Where can I find cheap net access? 

You can try crl.com or netcom.com .  I've not used either, but I know lots 
of people who have one or the other.  I also know a number of people that 
were on netcom, got sick of it, and switched to crl.

> I am less than thrilled with hooked.

Oh, but hooked is supposed to be the Best in the Bay Area according to Alex 
Bennett (morning DJ on Live 105).  I'm being sarcastic here.

>oh yeah, anyone from Choate or UPENN or Seattle down here?

I went to UPenn for a while back in the mid 80's.

First of all, anyone who goes to the Palladium is *not* from the city.
It's a club that caters to pre-teenage suburban nerds who love to listen to
madonna and have no concept of a good party :) :)

>1) Where are the underground record stores?  I like stuff that

Any of the record stores on upper and lower Haight Street (take a walk and
window shop, it's great!), BPM on Polk Street, Gaia Mantra on 16th Street
and a few in Berkeley among others.

>2)  Where are the clubs that play the stuff I like?  I like

Stay here on sfraves and you will learn about all the cool spots real fast.
Derek Chung publishes a weekly SFRaves calendar on this list.  It's posted
every Thursday.  If you want it I will forward the most recent to you. Just
eMail me.  It's about 3 pages long.

I use crl but they are not cheap...



>oh yeah, anyone from Choate or UPENN or Seattle down here?

It will not take long for you to get comfortable.  If you were part of the
underground up in Seattle you should be familiar with XLR8R magazine.  They
just established themselves in SF as of last month.  Their next issue will
be an SF issue.

Welcome!

I use the MH mail handler myself. It's free, and there's a number of
decent browser interfaces that you can use, includling xmh, exmh (if
you're willing to put up with Tcl/Tk abomination), and GNU emacs mh-e.
MH works on Solaris 2.3, Irix, HPUX, SunOS, and many more. Try 'archie'
to find where you can get it via ftp (it's free).

Put a pipe to MH's 'slocal' in your ~/.forward file, e.g.:

"| /usr/local/lib/mh6.7/slocal"

Then put a file like the following in your ~/.maildelivery

        Not only is it the title of a My Bloody Valentine album, but it was
plastered all over this weekend's _Sunset_ crowd.  What a fantastic day!

        Absolutely gogeous weather, wonderful group of people (much larger
than last weekend), amazing sounds...  Really should do this more often.

        Ran up the hill where the flag of the United States of Free Love
was firmly planted and watched the sun drop below the hills.  Flew down
into the middle of a circle of smiles just as the music peaked.  I never
danced so hard.... Who was that dj?

SHOBAN flyered me about a party called LUBE thursdays 7-2am 9/15/94
905.8831 probably rock hard acid techno party. She makes most acid djs 
sound like Live 105 wimps.

Sunset was beatiful..Markie played a song that was isaac hayes , black 
panther style with the lyrics KUNG FU   (not kung fu fighting) It was a 
great set .

I slept in the new moon ambient room and woke up with the strongest 
contact high ive ever experienced!

salutations, allen@ameba

R U Sure that's Isaac Hayes? Curtis Mayfield released a song called
"Kung Fu" on his album Sweet Exorcist (1974)....

Note that I wasn't at sunset so I don't really know for sure. (Wish I
was but I had to work all weekend. I don't think the people that made
this *&^%^@! Tuesday deadline had "honor labor" on their minds....)

It's definitely _not_ Isaac Hayes, It _could_ be a sample of curtis mayfield.
(The guitar samples and the violin samples are curtis' style for that part
of the seventies.

Actually I have this cut, it called "Kung Fu Man" by Master Po (honey dipped
records, Belgium)
Markie had double copies and played the "Peaking" Duck Mix and the 
Mandarin Dream Mix back to back. The logo side (Peaking Duck Mix) is the
70's style slightly acidy one witht the male vocals.  I vaguely seem to remember
these words from my teens but can't be sure, Niels do you have sweet exorcist?
Does he say "Right On Kung Fu man"? :)

Playing as the sun set was Tony (he looks like Charlie Brown =) ) after him
was Galen.

I also like track 9 on Orbitals latest album and I played it at the New 
Moon Party on Sun. People dug it. Check it out.

I want take a moment to thank Preston for putting on great Groove Kitchen at
the Troc.  It was a take me back to earlier days when the groove was phat,
and the people were happy. It felt so good in there.  Jon Howard, Markie, and
Marina Farina concocted blistering sets, which scaled acid house, progressive
house, and acid jazz. It was one of those great parties that kept getting
better all night. And thanks to all the sfravers who showed up to make it
great. That spirit just kept on flowing into the next days communal loveFest;
Sunset. What? 300 to 400 ravers, dancing around in love with the music and
nature. I'm sure other people saw that great older couple (45 or so) who
happened to walk by, got swept up in the music, and danced with everyone for
over and hour!! I loved those people....They just felt it with us.
They were ear to ear smiles. Special hugs and kisses to Tony for just kickin
it till the sun when down. It was the best good-bye to summer.    See ya
 down the  road...........robertj..........monterey

Mission Rock got very high marks from some friends 
of mine.   I missed it.


Groove Kitchen at the Trocadero (dock worker?)
This space is nice for dancing - a big basic room.
The music was loud and clear.  I thought the visual effects
were good.  They had a real sense of humor.  

The ambient area upstairs had trouble isolating itself from
the downstairs.  I didn't really care.  Some of my friends
were more interested in a mellow ambient place to hang out.
This party was not for them.

This was a clubby city party like I tend to favor.
Lots of the fabulous and beautiful.  Everyone was a hipster.
The music and the people reminded me of the recent
Wicked.  This was better. 

The best I could get out of my friends from London was that
"it's exactly like clubs at home".  So there ya go.


Sunset was the absolute shit!  Gorgeous day.  Heavy turnout
with lots of experience and variety to mix it up.  I heard the
last two djs - dirty funky sick jams that sat on your head
and oozed.   This party amazes me.  

Met a few nice people from Oakland (Gabriel, Robert?) and
from Santa Cruz (Telelia?, and friend?).
Also met Mel from San Diego at a party later.
I could have that all wrong... I do my best!

Dave

I deleted all of this week's, but if people can resend them to me, I'd be
happy to give them to him at the next sunset.  Does anyone (brian?) know
how often the archives are updated?  I don't see anything for August yet,
but it wouldn't take long for me to extract them from there.

people we know about.

i Mijos ! What a Sunday! Leaving the busted Chemique, what could we do but
huddle and dance to car stereos at 24th and illinois while we promised to
make Sunset the most incredible ever. 
Unconfortably spun, we rode the day out and then took our mats and blankets
over the bridge, and each group that arrived at the marina was met by
knowing smiles.
The sun shone, the wind blew,  dogs and kids ran around in the human
playground, and everyone shared bubbles, smiles, hugs, fruit, water,
blankets, luv.

The music grew into a grinding beat and heads bobbed and we smiled at each
other "Sheeeeet" and grass clippings got kicked up in the air. The music
synchronized perfectly to the sun's good-night, ribbit, kung-fu.....

. Even the police could tell there was nothing wrong goin' on. Lotsa 
sunset newcomers, from outatown ("are all sf parties this good?"-I wish)
and "old schoolers" that never hit the east bay before ("are all sunsets
this good?"-uh-huh). 

what a family to belong to; I'm the luckiest person on earth, because I am
surrounded by such wonderful people and love. 

Galen et al.,  excellent party.

Lotsa luv, 
Milton and the E-Bee...........

Welcome to San Francisco.  I moved here in January from New York City and 
have experienced many frustrations.  

>"nobody plays techno in San 
>Francisco, why do you want to listen to that shit, techno is 
>out here, you have to go to san jose".  

Nobody BIG who the major party organizers/promoters book for the bigger 
clubs and parties plays techno.  Jeno, Garth, Markie Mark, Spun, and 
others in the top echelon of local just aren't into techno it seems.  

There seems to be some conception that the harder faster stuff is for the 
kiddies.  For a while SF had very strict caberet laws that effectively 
divided the party scene into under and over 21.  When techno was played, 
it was mostly at the all ages parties; meanwhile, many in the over-21 crow 
tend to avoid the all ages or so-called "kiddie" events.   People used to 
remark to me "techno is for speed freaks."  So that's a sampling of some 
of the attitude. :-( .  HOWEVER, I've seen that this is changing slowly.  
If anything SFRaves is a hotbed of technophiles (if such a thing can be 
said to exist in SF).  If you hang out here you'll find the techno.

You can find techno at some of the smaller clubs and parties, and at some 
renegade parties, too.  Look for names like Goa Gill, Ethan, HDW, 
Planet-6, Deaks, and DRC.  I spin on occasion, too.  Parties to watch out 
for include SPAZ, Test, Your Sister's House, Friends and Family, and Liquid 
Air.  (F&F and LA are on haitus right now while we sort out some space/site 
problems).

>1) Where are the underground record stores?  I like stuff that 
>comes out on Tresor, FAX, and R&S.

Well, there used to be Gaia Mantra, but I heard that they have recently 
closed up shop.  You could take the BART out to Berkeley and go to 
Rasputnin's on Telegraph.  Deaks and I have both resorted to mail order.  
If you look around, you can find a few tracks here and there, I've had 
good luck at Star Alley (look it up in the phone book since I don't know 
the address).

>2)  Where are the clubs that play the stuff I like?  I like 
>higher BPMs than house music, but I could settle for house if 
>that is truly all there is in the city here...

As far as I know the only place is SPAZ, which is held at 60th 6th Street 
on Friday nights.  There might be others, the best bet is to watch out for 
the sfraves calendar which is published to this list every Thursday.

>3)  Where can I find cheap net access? 

You can try crl.com or netcom.com .  I've not used either, but I know lots 
of people who have one or the other.  I also know a number of people that 
were on netcom, got sick of it, and switched to crl.

> I am less than thrilled with hooked.

Oh, but hooked is supposed to be the Best in the Bay Area according to Alex 
Bennett (morning DJ on Live 105).  I'm being sarcastic here.

>oh yeah, anyone from Choate or UPENN or Seattle down here?

I went to UPenn for a while back in the mid 80's.

Boy do I miss Gaia Mantra! :(

Very pleasantly surprised by the selection at Rasputins though...loads of
tweeky techno and trance and acid of all flavors. The techno, house, etc.
buyer there, brian, commented to me: "I just get one of *everything,* if it
sells, I get more" +) So the more of us that buy techno there, the better
the selection will be I imagine :)

Also, thre is an email/mail order resource known as:

!nnovative Record Source

that emails a weekly list of new and classic titles including a 4-5 line
review of each; killer trainspotter. The buyer (Todd) seems to have quite a
taste for the acid/techno/trance end of the spectrum. I've had quite good
luck with them so far. IRS can be reached at:

                                            the burning that was the man...
greetings sfravers:

i just got back from burning man and for those of you who could not attend,
wow...
you really missed a unique experience.
i travelled with spaz, and we were the only dance contingent representatives
from san francisco.
some brief details sure to be elaborated on later by others:
  
...big sound system borrowed mostly from shark bait (our midrange/tweeter
section blew out so all we had were the bass bins at first).
the conditions in the desert were such that  you could really  *feel* the bass
shake the desert floor from 50 yards...incredible.
topher spun really masterfull progressive house/ambient-ish dubby orb-like
stuff with a taste of trance thrown in for a long time on several occasions,
notably as the day was drawing to a close sunday evening before the burning. i
really enjoyed it. the mood his selections encouraged complimented perfectly
both the warm, quiet late afternoon peace developing as the sun approached the
horizon as it set, and the butterflies-in-your-stomach anticipation of the
nocturnal festivities to come.

 peter from freezer added his two cents in the early am (sunday) after a small
party sat. nite with the *morning* music set. he and don from boogie soft also
collaborated sunday night for some live ambient during the party held after the
man burned.(thanks for the short wave ted, it was really cool...)
phillip spun some black practically liquid vinyl(whew... the heat out there!!!)
on the heavier acid/trance tip sunday day which was quite good as well. candice
of sfraves provided a really nice sfraves breakfast saturday morning with
oatmeal but i actually expected more people. when i was eating, me and my
friends were the only ones there :(
mtv came out and interviewed several spaz people and a couple others... i do
not know when or even if this footage will air, but because i have no tv, some
one could post what they saw if they see it. 
i could write tons more, but im sure others will fill in the cracks...
the hot springs were really cool too.
comments?
kevin

        Just wanted to say that we had a great party in Monterey with
Deaks, James, Donut, HDW and Tim McKnew spinning phenomenal sets.  We had a
great live play over with Tim's set.  Bryce kicked us off to an energetic
start,  Ernie (Deaks) just killed the crowd, look out for this man he could
be very dangerous in the future :)  the energy levels could become
uncontrollable when this man turns the tables...Look for Donut and James in
Santa Cruz definitely up and coming.  Monterey has some great positive
energy coming alive so if you are near check it out!  Special ythanks to
brycer and swoosh(cats.ucsc.edu) for all their excellent help and everyone
else who helped make Labor Day weekend a wonderful time.  I hope everyone
had a great time all over this weekend.  Look for a post from the Cloud
Factory in a couple of days about two upcoming events.

Love, Scott

P.S. If anyone is interested in seeing our expenses please e-mail I'll be
happy to mail 'em to you.  It was a three dollar party that made a few
bucks.  We've thrown three parties for three dollars each and are breaking
even with a tiny bit extra.  YOU CAN DO IT!!  Anyonr can throw a party, it
takes a positive attitude, some organization and a little time and can be
done with only a LITTLE money!!!

Subject: Re: fog machines.

As a former lighting tech for an Atlanta club that used lots of fog 
sometimes, I just gotta stick my $0.02 in --

There are two kinds of fog "juice": water-base, and oil-base. Oil-base is 
that really disgusting stuff that makes you cough. Water-base, used 
sensibly, should not cause the problems I see on this list.

Water-base is just water and glycerin, really -- the machine vaporizes 
water with a *very* hot element, and it is blown into the desired area. 
The glycerin just helps it last longer, but not mby much. I don't see how 
glycerin, esp. in such small amounts, could be causing these problems.

I believe the main problem here is the people using it. If it's 
water-base, but bothering folks, then:

1) The room is not properly ventilated. If the space doesn't have an 
air-handler of some sort, don't fog it.

2) The person operating the fog machine is trigger-happy, and is fogging 
*way* too heavily. (It takes only a little bit of fog to get the desired 
light-enhancement).

3) Said operator is blowing the fog out too close to the ground. It 
should be blown out well above the crowd (I like to send it down from 
the ceiling, actually) so that it dissipates before much of it gets to 
the dancefloor.

As for the odor, I agree, the scented ones are an abomination! However, 
the stuff I have used smells like -- well, like water.

Sorry I couldn't post this in a more timely fashion...

Maui

I would REALLY like to have an art party and make pieces (banners, an 
altar, etc.) for Your Sister's House, as we are returning to the scene. I 
also want very much to do some things, banners, maybe a new logo, for 
sfraves.

Alissa, you called our voicemail (YSH) a long time ago -- I recognized 
your name from our mailing list! I don't think I've met you though.

I have some fabric for banners, and I know where to get good-size bottles 
of nice flourescent paint at a good price --- let's see what else we can 
come up with!

I'm not too worried about that -- I've seen alot of painting recently, 
and it seemed to me that people were being very cool about it. No one was 
being destructive of other folx work, and no one was getting paranoid 
about their own.

That sounds wonderful! Let's *do* it!

I really hope that I can help to make this happen -- I think it would be 
so great to do -- a really nice change-of-pace from loud dance music and 
sweaty bodies (not that I have anything against either of those :)  )

Let me know what you all think.

It just occurred to me -- what if you already *did* the party, and I just 
wasn't here? Oh, dear...

Oh well, write and tell me!

Maui :)

Sorry about the late post.

I went to the New Moon Rave this Sunday at Gregg's place (is it your 
place, Gregg?).  It was great.  There was dance stuff being played 
upstairs and a chill out room downstairs.  There were lots of fruits to 
eat and there was even an engaging game of spoons to boot (thanks 
Caliban).

Anyway, if you're looking for something to do the next time one of these 
rolls around, check it out.  Good job Gregg and associated cohorts ;)

and it's a damn shame.  Stopped by the oatmeal breakfast (hi!) but didn't
see any of the usual SFO suspects.  Sorry I didn't partake but I was on
a fruit-juice fast all weekend.

Space, in sufficient quantities, is a drug, and the night stars were of
an intensity unmatched since Pete Ashdown's Knolls event (new moon, high
desert plateau).  The sungod fried our insanity to a crackly-crunchy crisp,
and the cold desert night kept us huddled around the fires.

Suddenly the theory of the four elements made a lot of sense.

As the fire burned my flesh to ash and the wind stripped the charred 
remains from my bones, all non-essentials were stripped away; worries
about work, The Law, hipness, phoning relatives, car insurance, and all
the other hundreds of niggling detail-work required of us to stay out
of the legal shredder.  Water, food, fire, and other people, and then
what?

Lots of art, almost all of which gets immolated by Sunday night.  It's
amazing what people do when the restrictions are lifted.  What keeps our
everyday life from being this interesting?  The tyranny of the majority,
as expressed in zoning laws, upkeep rules, the desire to make everything
drive-thru (or at least drive-near), ... ok, I'm rambling, but it was
beautiful.  I hope my "Free Action" coupons helped some people out.

Sure, it's pseudo-mystical shit, but we don't run on logic.  Rationality
is a tool with which the Beast fulfills its desires.  I was perfectly happy
drumming myself into a trance and daring the fire to burn me as I danced
around it semi-possessed (only caught fleeting moments of pure ego-loss).
The only downer was all the bottled-up sexual energy, which runs headlong

morality, and whose conflict manifests itself in big cars, outlet malls,
and other messianic religions.  

Oh well -- I'll shut up before Brian puts a grigsby filter on sfraves >%^)
Hope to see more of you next year.

I found the WWW-Home Page for this small music label. They have a couple of
12" listed w/description (160 and 166 PBM) and some tapes, available by
mail-order or at Silent Records in S.F.

	Title: "God Says No!" Records: ...a new direction in techno...
	URL:   http://iia.org/~cuddihd/gsn.html

This page also has pointer to some cool music-related sites with music samples
and more. 

One of the sites is, guess what, the SFR Archive but unfortunately it is still
pointing to techno.stanford.edu. Brian, maybe you want to send them the new 
address.
BTW, Spry Inc. has just released a fully functional demo of their AIR Mosaic for
Windows.  One of the nice features of this yet-another-version of Mosaic is the
presence of multiple Hot-Lists groupable by subject and the fact that they
come preconfigured with a bunch of cool and/or useful addresses. Again, the 
first URL in the Music Hotlist is the SFR Archive, but again, they have the
old address :(

Hey, this is for all y'all who wanted to get a demo of the stuff that I've
done.  It's going in the mail Wednesday.  

(Sorry this is being posted up to all of SFRaves but I don't know how to make a
mass mailing list when sending something out.)

If you gave me your mailing address, you should be receiving it within the next
two weeks.

Side OnE is a seamless trance mix with the following chronological points of
interest:

 0:00    (tape starts)
 0:04    Shooting Star Wish I Had A 303
 1:53    A.D.D. Girl Can't Get Arrested
 4:04    The Letter L (with Bert & Ernie)
 7:01    Shot At Sunrise (an interlude)
 8:54    The Letter L (Mr. Potatohead Goes Back mix)
 9:24    Godzilla vs. Steve Shelley
 11:47   An Evening With The Marquis
 15:3?   (tape runs out abruptly)

On Side Dos (the ambient side) is an extended put-it-on-and-go-to-sleep remix
of Stay Awake (from Mary Poppins) with a vocal sample from the version by
Suzanne Vega.  After that ends, you get a sudden cut into one of my very first
efforts at sequencing music, a pointless little attempt at dub that somehow
ended up on THIS tape purely by accident.  It's a nice melody, it's just that
I'm into more atonal stuff now.

I apologize for the sudden cuts at the end of each side, I kept forgetting to
take the length of the tape into account.  Also, keep in mind that you're
listening to a 2nd generation hi-speed dub.

Again, if you don't get anything from me within two weeks, lemme know and I'll
send another copy out.

Oh yeah, before I forget, here's a comprehensive equipment list:

        Roland R-70 drum machine
        SoundBlaster 16
        Turtle Beach Maui soundcard
        Realistic stereo mixer
        Korg rackmount line mixer
        Digitech delay rackmount
        Dod filter
        Boss sustainer pedal
        Fisher portable stereo
        486 personal computer

Don't forget to drop yer comments!

Greetings, SFRavers!

Well, after much soul searching, and thought to the practicalities of
the matter, I must regretfully announce that I will not be able to 
organize the September 24th Friends and Family, and have discussed 
this with Komotion.  We have arranged for another date at the space...
stay tuned for details.  As many of you know, I am currently working
with an attorney on the Oyster Bay case, which is consuming much of my
spare time.  The remainder of my time is going to meet commitments I
have already made, as well as toward repairing/stabilizing my internet
site (which suffered catastrophic failures).  Neither Ethan nor I have
the time and energy to devote to this undertaking, each for our own
personal reasons.  I hope you understand our reasons, and will continue
to support the many fine events held throughout the Bay Area during this
(hopefully) brief hiatus.  And, BTW, please support Komotion...you can
send them email at komotion@netcom.com.  Thanks for your support!

O.K. first of all. all i have to say to you is that if you think that the 
only people who go to the palladium is navy guys and girls from the east 
bay named candi with an i you are dead wrong and as far as the music that 
is played there you haven't been there in a long time. i used to be the D.J.
there and i can't remember when the last time that madonna was played 
there and i stopped working there last halloween so it must have been a 
long time ago. as far as music that is played there the palladium gets 
sent music by the music reps about two months be for you can buy it of if 
it's an import they usually get it right when it comes out or a little 
before. hell we even got stuff that you can't buy like the "new" mixes of 
surrender yourself by the daou we had those on a white lable when the 
original came out one of six copies in existance at the time and remember 
love you more by sunscreem they had that in '91 when they made 1000 white 
lables of the original song. be sides that they had 808 state come down 
and mix it up a couple of years back and when techno hit the bay area we 
were right on top of it switching the format from modern to a more housey 
technoie type of night even now sundays have been all acid jazz hip hop 
reggae and house. i do have to admit that the place still look like it's 
caught it a time warp from the seventies and because it's in north beach 
they get alot of tourists and navy guys but they do have a great sound 
system up to the minuite lights well except for the neon but most of all 
they have a very non threating atmosphere anyone can go to the palladium 
and have a good time talk to anyone and not have to deal with their 
attitude can you say the same from any of the others like 1015,the sound 
factory,the end up,dv8,dna,townsend, i don't think so.
anyway this has been my little rant i'm just protective and a little 
touchy about people who haven't been to the palladium in years bad 
mouthing it.Peace.Talizman.

sunset was the bomb of the bomb! nothing but bodies in motion lit by 
flickering tiki torches and the sky and the ground and great music.  I 
had to be pryed away...
so many beautiful people...

painting at new moon was great.  we should have something like that 
whenever possible.  the Free Love flag has been converted...

and for the first time, cops came and I didn't hate them.  I was playing 
a song with the line "why don't you love me, like I love you?" when they 
said turn it down.  I kinda felt flattered that they noticed the music. 
heh heh...

much love,

Internet mail                 Cumulus, Sunset, New Moon

My friends and I all had a WONDERFUL time at Cumulus.  I think each of us agreed
that it was a party that we actually had a really good time at for once in a
long while.  (Too many lame parties at 24th and Illinois, not counting the first
two or three at that spot -- before it was a 2-A-Week location.)  

Harmony, a couple weeks ago, was a truly beautiful and uplifting vibe for us,
but we put on that party, so it doesn't count!   ;-)

All the DJ's at Cumulus did a great job as I expected, and the music kept me
floating about an inch off the ground all night.  We stayed until after sunrise
to see everyone off, and it turned out there was no one but Bryce and the other
DJ's to help lug the sound system back up out of the monstrous and amazing sand
pit the party sat it.  I convinced my friends that WE would appreciate and need
the help from others if it were OUR party, and that we were practically
obligated to give them a hand.

So, up the giant sand incline we went with the sound system, two to a monitor.
                     That hill was our death.  

I couldn't see straight for 30 minutes after I got to the top.  Somehow we made
it back to our car, but I was satisfied that we had just saved the Cumulus crew
probably about an hour of backbreaking labour.  <Yay!>

Very, Very, VERY unfortunately, we missed Sunset and the New Moon parties, and
mucho bummed we were.  I tried to stay up after Cumulus until Sunset, but
consiousness much past 1PM just wasn't happening.  I decided to sleep until
Sunday evening, and then make my journey up to Berkeley for a New Moon party,
but I couldn't wake up Greg.  I even shook his waterbed for a few minutes, but
the waves only put him into a deeper coma.  Being totally dead myself, I gave
in.  A few hours later we found ourselves totaly awake at 4:00 AM in the
morning, and somehow hungry.  Ahh, the Raver lifestyle.  Too bad I was so tired
this week.  There will always be another week!

See you all soon!
Love and Hugs,
Todd

I concur.  The tone of my experience at the burning man was set when I drove
my car onto the desert and was passed at 60 miles an hour by a car shaped
like a shark (fins, teeth, a tail that moved) being chased by a fishing boat
with a nakid, crazed captain atop the recon tower.

Thank god you guys were there.  I heard stories of the rave two years ago
that was located 2 miles away from the man and was so loud that you could
hear it for miles around the desert.  This time wasn't quite so loud, but
I'm not complaining.

A small tragidy, that mid range going out.  What happened to it?

Black rock desert is an amazing place.  It's made out of gypsum dust with the
consistancy of talcum powder packed hard into the ground.  It covers hundreds
of square miles with no rocks, plants, or hills to break its flatness.  And
yes, it conducted sound really well.  It also had a very nice feel to it as
good as any dance floor I've been on.

The music was amazing.  Before I left for the burning man, I was a little
sad about missing the new moon rave, but this was every bit as good as
the goat rock or pt. reyes new moons I've been to.  Really, if you wanted
to pick the place for the ultimate rave of all time, the black rock desert
can't be beat.  There's no ranger to shut you down out there.

I spent a good two hours on sunday taking pictures of the MTV crew doing their
thing out there.  I believe I annoyed the hell out of them, but hey, at the
burning man there are no spectators, and even the media is a performance.
 
> i could write tons more, but im sure others will fill in the cracks...
> the hot springs were really cool too.

The greens and browns of the hot springs and vegetation were a welcome
change from the yellowish white of the desert.  Maybe you saw me out
there, I was the guy with the purple umbrella.

Ciao,

     Hello all,
     
     I'll add my $0.02 to what the Burning Man experience was like... First 
     off all, to sum it up, it was the most artistic and unique experience 
     I, and most of my crew have been to. The people were of such wide age 
     and background variety, yet everyone was just *so* friendly! It was 
     great!
     
     The days were spent walking around getting to know people, and the 
     nights were strictly for partying. The Black Rock Desert truly is so 
     serenely desolate..you can close your eyes with the car travelling at 
     80mph..for what seems like hours at a time.. and not hit a thing! 
     
     Well, the days activities included many 'artsy' things.. the impromptu 
     cafe's and bars and dancing parties that sprung up in the main camp 
     were great. One group was handing out 'zines' and another was handing 
     out poetry, etc... Our group brought a portable rock-climbing gym that 
     many people seemed to enjoy!
     
     On Saturday night there was a big 'burning' of a huge towerlike 
     thing.. The closest thing to describe it wouldve been a huge snout 
     sticking up from the earth.. The party that ensued around that and the 
     'opera' show that followed was just too cool! 
     
     The raves on both nights were just great, with SPAZ doing a great 
     job..yeah, one can *really* feel the pumping bass in the desert. The 
     Sunday night tunes had a lot of greeeeaat trancey stuff.. which went 
     well with the unreal view of the stars ( I swear I never knew one 
     could see so many stars in a night! ). 
     
     And of course the Burning of the Man on Sunday night was hella cool as 
     well. There it was, a mass of people who helped raise the man, light 
     him, and then he burned!! The man came crashing down and then 
     *everyone* started dancing around him! There were so many drummers who 
     drummed continuously for 3+ hours, until the last of the flame had 
     turned to ashes! Amazing! That experience alone was mind-boggling. The 
     vibe was intense! Any of you who went definitely know what I'm talking 
     about.
     
     All, in all, it was a great event.. I know what I'm doing next Labor 
     Day weekend! It was at times almost a scene out of a Mad Max movie... 
     with the artisctic and creative energy of all these people coming 
     together for a single purpose... If I were you I wouldnt miss it next 
     time! As you can tell, I'm still kinda speechless about it all!
     
     What an experience!
     
     Regards, and rave on folks!

Mijos, can anyone tell me what happened at chemistry?
Ok, ok, I don't want to hear the old "you shouldn'ta paid 20 in the first
place" stuff, I've promised myself that i don't know how many times, but
when you see everyone you love together in one place, and the lineup iiiiz
gooooooooood, you go...

so why did 20 not guarantee a long night in there? Some girl said "we
closed because baaaaad gangsters with baseball bats were gonna come in and
hurt you, we saved your ass" well, isn't that special? raise your hands
everyone who saw that....

Coulda returned our 20, since we still had the envelope and numbered card.
hmm,and when we relocated at 24th and ill, everyone uncomfortably spun,
building up unnecessary tolerance to their disco wafers, we got no news or
announcements from anyone. It just turned into a late night cruise strip of
low riders and gangstas, with little groups huddled for warmth near car
stereos. Could do that in the east bay with doobie and a six pack...

one dude sat there going, "chemistry loves us, man, the'yre our family,"
bub, mom and pop left us home alone....the real family was crashing hard,
40$ poorer and probably none the wiser...

for a consistently good summer-long vibe at a 5$ party, the family feel did
exist, busted parties did relocate, and Carlos cares, but why put a 20$
finale? Seems like baiting, and i ate... But to just leave us there, not
say anything, hell, what happened? I haven't checked their message, but
Chemistry can rise above Anthem (whata rip) and keep its name for most of
us, if they do a free one, with the same fucking line-up we paid for. Then,
maybe our money will make more people happy (those who didn't pay) and not
just a few (those who didn't play). 
Remember a wrehouse Organics, busted this spring? They relocated to the
closest thing (they bought out the Hayes) so no-one had to drive *&#@-up,
and while in line, they apologized and promised(delivered) a free park
party. Just gotta luv sincerity. Got nuthin' against makin a buck, just do
it right, and if you claim family, my chemists, stay with us till the end.

Buzzzzz,
Milton and the E-Bee

now, I dunno if this is supposed to be top scecret, but whatever, you
all are going to know abut it soon if it's true anyway.

I heard that Wicked FINALLY got their sound system.

And it's purple.

Apparently the genius who created the sound system Martin uses (Basics,etc)
modelled his system off of the one Wicked got.  So it's probably dope.

Now, is it true that Wicked might be throwing a little party
to celebrate the Giant Purple People Pusher?

if so, SHARE.

Yes indeed the wicked sound system has arrived and it is Purple
_deep_ purple (so that in normal house light it looks black but
when moonlight or sunlight reflects off of it, the reflection is purple.

No idea . . . I thought they were taking it to Burning Man and then loading 
up a schoolbus and taking a tour of the US to spread their message.  Or at
least that's what Markie said to me a month and a half ago.  Plans change.

I concur.  The tone of my experience at the burning man was set when I drove
my car onto the desert and was passed at 60 miles an hour by a car shaped
like a shark (fins, teeth, a tail that moved) being chased by a fishing boat
with a nakid, crazed captain atop the recon tower.

Thank god you guys were there.  I heard stories of the rave two years ago
that was located 2 miles away from the man and was so loud that you could
hear it for miles around the desert.  This time wasn't quite so loud, but
I'm not complaining.

A small tragidy, that mid range going out.  What happened to it?

Black rock desert is an amazing place.  It's made out of gypsum dust with the
consistancy of talcum powder packed hard into the ground.  It covers hundreds
of square miles with no rocks, plants, or hills to break its flatness.  And
yes, it conducted sound really well.  It also had a very nice feel to it as
good as any dance floor I've been on.

The music was amazing.  Before I left for the burning man, I was a little
sad about missing the new moon rave, but this was every bit as good as
the goat rock or pt. reyes new moons I've been to.  Really, if you wanted
to pick the place for the ultimate rave of all time, the black rock desert
can't be beat.  There's no ranger to shut you down out there.

I spent a good two hours on sunday taking pictures of the MTV crew doing their
thing out there.  I believe I annoyed the hell out of them, but hey, at the
burning man there are no spectators, and even the media is a performance.
 
> i could write tons more, but im sure others will fill in the cracks...

The greens and browns of the hot springs and vegetation were a welcome
change from the yellowish white of the desert.  Maybe you saw me out
there, I was the guy with the purple umbrella.

Ciao,

What a bunch of whining, ungrateful bullshit. Tell them to get thier *own*
fucking account and post all the useless, self-agrandizing, empty, hyped-up
cow pucky they well want to. At which point *I* will filter them.

Where to start...  Amazing seems to be the only word that has left
my mouth since I got back.  I really have to ditto Grigsby's post.
The absolute freedom and loss of boundaries was mind blowing.  I 
learned so much out there.  Water, sun protection, warmth, food
and pure, egoless human relations.  No 7-11 for those last minute
"necessites".  Did you forget something?  Hope that someone else 
didn't and is willing to share.  Beautiful.  I found Burning Man
to be quite different than other similar festivals/gatherings.
Maybe it was the *extreme* friendliness of everyone.  Maybe it
was that everything was so extreme.  Nothing was simply done, yet
everything simply happened.

Yeah, there were a few party poopers, but they were also part of the
beauty.  But then there was the man in the (two hour) coffee line
that told me about his mine claim out in the mountains and how he
just stumbled on the party thinking that it was Gerlach (Go Bruno!).
He gave me stones to make jewelry with.

My words can't do justice to the experience.  Maybe my photos will.
Probably not.

I have calouses and peeling skin on my hands from the Crush Fest. 
I lost all sense of myself.  Try it sometime.  It's really not all
that bad.

The oatmeal was great.  We posted a sign on the bulletin board and
non-sfr folks showed up too.  I made some wonderful friends.  (If 
anyone out there knows Sue, Mark, and John remind them to call me
355-3770)  From Saturdays Black Rock Gazette:
	
	Oatmeal is the natural healer.  It heals the mind, it
	heals the body.  Come share in the faith with an oatmeal
	feed.  (South side of the Land of Milk and Cookies bus
	in back of the Tiki Camp.)

How this got in the paper, I don't know.  Things just kind of happened 
out there.  People trickled in between 8 and noon which was just fine
for us.  As soon as we fed one group another would come in.  

People made pretend cameras out of wood and pipe.  I loved it, 
self mockery is important.

Burning Man will be different next year.  People were already mourning
the loss.  (MTV was there?  Didn't notice.)  I'm glad it will be 
different, what's the point in doing the same thing all over again?
I hope that each year is different from the year before.  An aside 
to this...  If you fear Burning Man commercialism, do something free.
If you didn't like the people selling coffee, make coffee to give to
everyone.  Something like this only evolves into what *you* allow
it to.

Fuck it up.

Gosh, if it's not one thing with this mail it's another.  I logged
out yesterday with a full mailbox and logged back in today to find
an empty box. :(:(  Anyway, if anyone has sent me anything in the last
couple of days (you know who you are:) could you please resend it.

Sorry to bother the whole list with this...

Thanks.

Whatever.  Try and understand that the expressed antagonisms and the
perceived self-absorbed, self-promoting expressions and actions of the 
zips have created a negative impression to many people.  For whatever
reason, that is the reality.

Many of us on this list go to parties all the time.  We are not that hard 
to meet.  There have been many ongoing open-to-the-public SFRave-related 
get togethers as well.  Special invitations have never been necessary for 
individuals who truly want to come together.

According to todays Chronicle:

Mayor Frank Jordan is pushing for a curfew that would forbid anyone
under 17 from being "on any public street, public park, or any other
public place" between 11 PM (midnight Friday and Saturday) and 5 AM,
unless returning from work, or religious or educational events.

                                 What the fuck????

I've got nothing against religion or people's right to practice such, but 
giving that sort of free rein to *anyone* while excluding others is bullshit.

Unfortunately the mass hysteria caused by the last two weeks of kids 
shooting kids is going to cause many to give this idea serious thought.  
Hopefully it'll die before it comes to fruitition or get knocked down by 
the courts shortly after inception (bringing religion into the matter 
makes that damn easy)

Just spouting off,
Peace,

Word has it that Wicked has finally bought the sound system we've all been
paying for ;), so Saturday may be the first chance to hear it.  

There are some new/old listings in the weeklies - Mission Rock is 
happening again on Fridays, The Top on Mondays, and of course Boogie
Buffet, if you hadn't already noticed.

The crowd went wild at Come/Unity last night, while last Sunday's Boogie 
Buffet was mellower, but I found some old friends there.  I haven't seen
most of you guys for a long time, maybe I'll see you at Wicked
or Sunset...

They've already done this in San Jose, folks.
And, as if the curfew weren't bad enough, 
they started setting up police blockades downtown 
that serve to automatically feed drivers (people who 
are driving in downtown SJ) onto the freeway 
whether they like it or not. Of course, they only do this 
on Friday and Saturday nights- so, I guess I can live 
with that- yeah, right. Many of my friends who live downtown 
can't get home on weekend nights because of the blockades-
makes for some very creative driving. Oh, yeah, they also 
close some of the exits going into the downtown area. 
Last Saturday I was trying to get to Greg's Ballroom for 
DJ Tara's b-day fest. I ended up driving around the SJ 
Arena Complex for about half an hour just trying to 
find/make my way around the blockade on Julian.
Nevermind my friend who has been supporting herself 
for the past year& 1/2 and who also just graduated from high 
school, age 17, this past spring- she pays taxes, but she's not
allowed to go out in public? huh?

It sucks.

Take care-

Jocelyn

Mijos, this cannot bee!
Each day, scared people are willing to trade off their freedoms and
interfere in those of others for a little security? while many will fight
this, I think it should be noted that in the early seventies, before
certain pschotropic botanicals were made illegal, certain like-minded and
far-sighted people formed the Church of the Tree of Life, and claimed these
substances as part of their sacrament. Members can use these legally and
with little or no harrassment, I am told.

Damn right, time to form a new religion. Not only have some of the most
deeply spiritual people I have ever met been thru raves (but not limited
to), but maybe this would protect us from certain busts, but maybe I just
dream out loud too much. 

Could you imagine, tho, the cops being turned away, unable to legally
interfere in "our" sacrament? heh, heh...

Amen!
Milton and the E-Bee....

The Grand Canyon Mega Rave
     (A report)
  (c) By Cap'n Crunch
  
  Well,  I'm finally back in civilization after being away for about 2 weeks,
and have not even thought about checking my Email.    

  My place has sorta been taken over by a bunch of Rock and Rollers,   who are
here practicing their performance for an upcoming Rock concert.    It's sorta
neat having live entertainment while working on the computer.

 A few wweks ago,  at 8 pm,  we left for Arizona,  to drive through the night
headed for the Kaibob national forest for the Unity festival/ Grand Canyon
rave/ Rainbow gathering.

 We pull into Kingman,  Az.  around 6:30 am with a slight problem with the car,
have breakfast,   and took car to a local garage,  where they diagnosed the
problem.    After about 3 hours of waiting,   I get the bad news..   $150  to
replace the distributor cap and wires.

 We were on our way,   and eventually got into the area about 10 am the 
following morning.    Our next problem was trying to interpret the directions
given on the info line.  I had called the number that previous evening,  and
transcribed the directions,   but was unable to interpret some of the words
given in the directions.   For instance,  off of route 40,  we were to look for
a sign saying "Park",   but later we interpret it as "Park" turnoff.   

  While looking for the site,  we ran into others,  and collectivly we converge
on the Rainbow gathering site,  and learn that the Unity festival was to be
located 7 miles away.    We decided to go to the Rainbow gathing first,  to
set up camp,  then head out for the Unity festival after setting up camp.

 later on,  we learn that the Unity Festival was either cancelled,  or moved
closer to the Rainbow gathering.   The Rainbows then invited the Unity folks
to their morning "Circle" to hash out and discuss some type of unity between
the Rainbows and the Untity folks.    The Rainbows are totally against amplified
sound,  but the ravers and Unity folks definately wanted amplified sound.

By Thursday night....

It was finally concensed that the ravers could do their thing,  as long as 
their music wasn't heard by the rainbow folks.    The SPAZ crew then set up
their sound system (A rather smallish one),  out about 3 meadows away from 
the Rainbow's but SOME of the rainbows were close enough to get and hear SOME
of the sound.   So,  there WERE some complaints about the music late at night
that resulted in the stoppage of the music.     Eventually,  it was agreed that
the sound be turned down,  but not so low as to not get the energy,   and 
things lasted til about 4 am or so.

The Unity folks weren't quite that fortunate,   but were able to get themselves
invited to join the rainbows for a short session to be held on Sunday,   and
also got permission to use amplified sound as long as it was far enough away
from the peace loving Rainbows.

By Friday,   the Unity folks were still trying to get permission to get their
sound systems into the park,   but the rangers kept intercepting them and
not allowing them to pass.

Frazer,  of the Zippies was a bit more clever,   and used a distraction 
technique,  and was able to cause a distraction,   while the sound system was
being moved right in front of their noses.    As far as the other Zippies,
such as Pinkus,  Angus and the others....   They have completly seperated
from Frazer,  who I am convinced,  has good intentions,  great energy,
and dispite the lack of resources,   always seems to pull through,  and
come off with an event,  dispite overwhelming odds towards failure.   In
this case,   a huge powerful sound system materialized,   and was put to good
use.

By friday,  the Zippies had set up the klller sound system,  and was able to
get things going,  dispite a long 2 hour rain storm.    After about 11 pm,
the rave started up,   and it was KILLER.    WOW!!,  this super sound system
was GREAT!.    Goa Gil then followed with some of his super Hard Acid trance
that had me bouncing around between the trees BIG TIME.   WOW!!  What super
energy,  as hundreds of folks were dancing out there in the middle of a forest
under a partial full moon.    A few Navaho dudz,  who have never been to a rave,
were totally impressed with the dancing energy,  and joined in as if they
were raving all their life.    A lot of the local Arizona dudes mostly stood
by and just gawked at the total joy and bliss that was happening in the
dance area.     Media people were sneaking around the dance area,   trying
to capture it on video.    Once the cameras left,   more and more people
came out dancing.

The Friday gig lasted until about 5 am when Goa got tired or was forced to
shut down,  due to a previous arrangement,  or whatever.   The media was  out
in full force,   mostly from foreign outlets,   but it was rumored that CNN
was to be bringing sattelite uplink equipment for the Sunday's "Drumming around
the world",  a HUGE drum circle to take place after QUIET SESSION from 6 am
till 9 am on Sunday.    I thought the camaras were rather intrusive,   with
their bright lights,   focusing on the dancers.    I spent most of my time
dancing away from the camaras.   Someone then mentioned that the Cap'n was
attending,  and CBC Canadian Broadcasting Co got an interview out of me,
and I told them that the rave scene is getting choked off by all this
nit-pickin authorities,   set agains people having a good time dancing.

The joy and energy there was nothing short of amazing,  and these media folks
transmitted these imabes round the world.   I just hope that the narration was
NOT about doing drugs,  and fucused on the energy and dancing.

 BY end of the Friday rave,  I was ready to trek out and look for a food 
kitchen for my morning caffene fix.

  I meet up with this great bunch of dudes from Texas and get invited to a pancake
breakfast and coffee.    After that,  I joined the morning circle to hear more
complaints from the rainbow's about the noise from the rave.    Things quickly
settled,   after it was made clear that the ravers would respect the 6 am
QUIET PERIOD,  as was ranbow tradition at these gatherings.

Late on Saturday,  before the rave,  we get rumors that the national guard
had set up roadblocks with sniffer dogs,  busting anyone with drugs, 
unregistered cars,  or other infractions.    Few people dared to make the trek
into town those days.    On late Monday morning,  we get word that the national
guard and the rangers had exceeded their budget and pulled MOST,  but not all
of the roadblocks.

Saturday,  was the largest rave...   More than 500 people were in attendance,
the media was there in force.    Again,   very little American media,   but I
met some grerat media dudz from australia doing a documentary.

I ran into Sara,  a journalist,  working for High times,  and spent a lot of 
time with her that evening.   Eventually, I realized that I should get over
to the rave,   and do it up again....  One can get distracted when one meets
interesting people.

The Saturday rave was really great....  Lots showed up and yet again,  Goa
Gil layed out some of the most incredable Hard Acid trance that reberberated
between the trees like I was in haaven.    By this time,   I had been awake
the 3rd night with little or no sleep,  but still managed to scarf enough
energy to dance my ass off until the very end.   At the end,  the sound
system went dead and we heard "ZZaaappp",  some sparks flying,   and someone
mentioned seeing some rainbow dude in a white robe and a beard running off, 
after he cut the generator wire,   so a few people start taking off after him.  
After catching up with him, he said that 6 am was the ending time as agreed,   
and Goa was to have played his last song in just a few minutes time.   There 
were some heated arguments between Goa,  the producers,  and this robed 
rainbow dude.

During Quiet hour,   I took the opportunity to "Meditate and trance" to try
and re-gain my energy for the World Drumming event to take place in a few
hours.

I then run into the Navahoe dude,  who tells me that they are still getting
fucked over for their land.    I listen to what he has to say,  then I
think about it,  then ask to see one of his elders on how he can pester the
Peabody Coal company that's strip mining their land.    I get the name of this
Navahoe Elder,  and make a point to try and find him about some ideas on how
they can get back at Peabody.

The Drums around the world were absolutly incredable.   The Navahoe,  and
all the other local tribes joined in... and with the teepees in the background,
the Navahoes,  Hopi's and other local tribes drummed and danced,  as well as 
Russian drummers,  Africa,  and India,   it wa a truly amazingly energetic and 
wonderful event.    CNN had set up an uplink,    and I am most curious as to 
what was seen in the news.     Has anyone gotten any tapes of CNN's brodcasts?

Late Sunday evening,  I FINALLY get some sleep since Wednesday evening (Last
time I slept).

People were then starting to leave,   and after lots of looking around,  I fail
to locate the Navaho elder dude,   but I did  talk to another Navaho,   who
told me of a demonstration they were having on this Thursday.    I make a 
note to try and check this out.

I wander around,  trying to find riders who are willing to PAY for their share
of gas,    and we now head north  towards the Grand Canyon.    And would
you believe it....   I run into Frazier of the Zippies,    We meet at the Taco
bell,   next to the IMAX theator near the Canyon.    I had just come from there,
after camping at the canyon rim,   pondering the possibility of actually hiking
down into the canyon.    I keep careful watch on the weather,  cause this is
Monsoon season,   and almost like clockwork,   everyone gets a thoural drenching
late in the afternoon.    I decided against hiking in (Was really glad I
did,  later),   and head East towards the Navaho reservation.    I make
wrong turn and meet Frazer.    After lunch,   we head back to the canyon
rim for some photo shots,   set up a boom box,   and rave for a few hours,
having our own party,  as herds of Japanese tourists parade by,   and take
it all in.....

So,  Frazer got his chance to rave at the rim.....  As we were finally
finishing the video,   a huge storm was brewing that provided us with the most
spectacular light show I've ever seen nature produce.    The storm was coming
from the West,  so I wizely head out to the car,   bid Fraser farewell,   and
headed east along the south rim of the canyon,  then North towards the 
navaho reservation,  to meet and talk with this Elder.

We get to this smallish bodunk town "Tuba City" in the middle of the reservation,
and were stunned by the poverty,  and yet see all this money around the place,
it's learly obvious that the Navaho get little of this money.

I sat all afternnon,  talking to the local kids,  and other folks about the
situation,  and learn it's really fucked BIG TIME.    For instance,  ALL
phone calls out of the reservation get socked with huge sur charges,   as
well as operator rates..   Navahoe phone co restricts the tone pads on ALL
payphones,  and filters it,  preventing ALL access from long distance
companies.   Sheesh!!  I wonder who gets all this extra money.   I know
who DON'T get any of it.   For instance,   most phones are rigged to only
allow incoming collect calls,  so huge surcharges can easily be levied
against all Navahoe folks who wisch to communicate OUT of the reservation.
This discourages them from "reaching out" for help.    They are in dire need
for a single Xerox machine,   as they get charged huge amounts for using
the one they currently have access to.

They have their OWN telephone company,  undoubtedly controlled by those forces
against them.    When having trouble calling INTO the reservation when I got
back,    I was usucessful at getting through.    I phone my friend who works
for major long distance switching equipment to investigate this for me.   So,
Ill try and find out....

  a) Why all incoming calls are blocked (Except collect calls)
  b) Why I cannot even reach the phone company's business office to 
     find out why I cannot reach one of their customers.

I get up to this trading post,   and see a hot dog stand,  and ask this white
dude if this is Navahoe run,  and he says NO,  so I walk away.    I did talk
to this Navahoe dude at the trading post and learn that most items are NOT
made by Navaho,   but they DO get the money from the sales.   I picked up
this great pullover wool sweater with great artwork on it.

We finally make our way up to where we were to meet this elder,   and I actually
have to drive on Peabody Coal property to reach his home,  and scope out this 
coal mining complex while driving through.    

It was horrible.   These huge giant machines,  digging huge gouges out of the
cliff,  with this long conveyer belt.    You get up to within 500 feet of
this "thing" and you can barely hear people next to you.    There were some
modest homes nearby,  occupied by Navaho,  and now I understand why they
are demonstrating.    The noise alone was quite a bit much to take.

After two unsucessful attempts to locate this dude,   I head back down
to the store and meet a few folks.    They informed me that I would be
arrested if I go up there to contact this Elder,  so I wizely depart,
making sure I get names and numbers to a few other Navahoe folks before
I leave.    I later discovered that it was impossible to get calls
INTO these numbers,  thusly confirming the fact that even incoming calls
are not allowed to certain Navaho individuals.

We head north,  then West,  and cut into Utah as we head West.    We take
a rather sutherly route West,  heading towards Las Vegas.    In early evening,
we head north on I-95,  near the nuke testing range,  wearing hankerchiefs
over our noses,   dousing ourselves with water to cool off.  WOW!!  it
was HOT.  Our destination....  BURNING MAN...  BLACK ROCK DESERT and a town

Mijos, it seems their will be a free party to make up for busted chemistry.
Try the line this saturday or next, in the am. 

Pero, I think Union Square (sat pm) is gonna be the shit. Brazilians
(Brasileiros e Brasileiras!) will be gathering to re-celebrate the Tetra
(our 4th world cup win!). Anyone who was at Franklin and Misiion or Bahia
Tropical the night we won knows what a party Brazilians can thro

There will be live bands, canned music, hella dancin and oh so goood
Brazilian food, a mixture of Amerind and African and Iberian, with tropical
products, but of course. 

The vibe at a Brazilian party is equivilant to a good outdoor rave: lotsa
happy, sweaty people, all ages, NO JUDGEMENT, no violence, loadsa smiles,
hugs,  and everyone dances their own thing. Don't let the beer fool you,
its NOT an alcahol party. Its a vibe party, grrrrrlllll.............
Check it out on your way to whatever on saturday afternoon, you might get
into it, and  see that we don't do anything new at raves, we just do it
with different music! The love has always been around. 

Milton and the E-Bee....
Ps. wear green and yellow

drinks, munchies, toys, smiles...whatever!  This will be extremely mellow 
and casual (movies, tunes, hang out, schmooose, batmitton, whatever).

Subject: Snivilisation first impression
Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

Hello,

My first impression from listening to the new Orbital CD once:

"Buy    this     album    NOW!"   :-)

And I'm no big Orbital worshipper/trainspotter - some of their stuff 
makes me yawn when I listen to it at home instead of the dance floor (even 
from the universally acclaimed second album).

But the new one is very inventive - no rust at chez Hartnoll.  While there 
is still a definable Orbital sound, Snivilisation is quite different from 
their previous work.

If it sounds like I'm avoiding specifics, it's because it's not similar to 
much else (part of what's good about it!).  Some of the tracks are perhaps 
like, say, Moby remixed by the Orb (or is it The Orb remixed by Moby?). :-)

New sound colors, different rhythms.  A few vocals...  Odd cover art!

provisionally 9/10.

Anyone see the moon tonite before it set? There was a fairly bright star
directly underneath the crescent, and it looked just like a big question
mark on the horizon. Kinda foreboding, huh?

	I know that this isn't exactly rave related but it got mailed
	to me and I thought that some of you might be intrested in it.
	Also I am going to ask a favor from all of you out there and
	that is-- I have a job interview today at 1:00pm in SF and
	could everyone please send out a positive vibe for me today?
	If I get this job I won't love 100 miles away anymore so that

Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

This is a courtesy message for anyone who is using AOL or any 
other BBS which is costing them a fortune and would like to 
stay on SFR without paying dearly.   (I'm not intentionally 
promoting my BBS, just trying to help fellow SFR'ers afford to 
stay on the list-I found out the hard way.)

We (Greg & Cindy) s*bscribed to SFR while on AOL and due to the 
amount of posts that come thru SFR we were paying over $60 a 
month for this BBS.  What BS!  So while listening to Alex 
Bennett we heard about Hooked.  Cost went from too much to only 
$25/month unlimited or $15/month limited service.  Runs under 
Windows.  The cool thing about Hooked is you can call up, get 
your messages, then *disconnect* to read your mail.  Your mail 
posts directly to your PC, doesn't stay on the BBS, and you can 
read it whenever you want once you've connected/disconnected.   
(With AOL you have to stay online to read your messages - what 
a scam!)

To get hooked e-mail:   staff@hooked.net

Oh yeah, if you do get "hooked" please mention that 
fritz@hooked.net sent you.

Peace & positivity,

That night, i had a dream too: somehow everyone got the wrong date and 
showed up for the party Saturday night instead of Sunday.  Then noone
would leave!  i kept trying to tell people to come back the next day, but 
nobody believed me.

Anyway, dreaming these problems ensured they wouldn't happen.  M & Ovid's 
quantum visualization was great, we didn't move to Kommotion, and 
everyone (and for a while there it did feel like _everyone_) showed up on 
the right night to manifest a great party.

Hello,

In case it wasn't clear from my review, I should add the disclaimer that 
despite plenty of beats, this is essentially listening music.

It IS different from the second Orbital album...

EG someone complained that the tracks are too slow. :-)

Actually, you can read mail offline on AOL using their new QuickSessions
feature.  But I usually read online since I have a free account.  I have also
heard of several folks bailing from hooked to netcom to get 'real' net access
and then again others switching from netcom to a smaller internet provider
cuz their sick of netcom's size and corporate attitude.   I must admit to
being occaisonally embarrassed by the 'neighborhood' I post from.  But I just
got the go ahead to setup and manage a domain for the comapny I work for - if
they only knew...

I must admit that when I first came to San Francisco, and some other times
since, I've frequented The Pal,adium, and I have to agree with Talizman, that
it ain't so bad.  However, it is a serious high school/college/preppy type hang
out, and there's a lot of picking up on others going on.  But the atmosphere is
OK, and the music is OK.  But give me an honest to goodness rave any day,
especially considering that it's $10.

To add my $.02:           For cheap 'n' nasty 
internet access, I use CRL.  $17.00 per month, unlimited access, no more 
fees for anything (except storage, $2/month per meg above 5meg.  I have 
never come close to having 5meg left on the system).  The support is 
excellent, and I have failed to get through on the first dial on average 
about one a month.

For even cheaper access just to internet mail, you cannot beat SFNET.  
You don't even need a computer.... they have coin operated terminals in 
cafes around SF.  No registration charge, stick in your quarter, and 
enter a handle and password.  You will remain a registered user.  A 
quarter buys 5 mins time.... it is mostly used for the chat tables - but 
has internet mail uploads and downloads about every hour.  Most nifty for 
checking the ravelist when away from home.  The other advantage is, of 
course, that your *true* name and address are known by nobody.  Ideal for 
the more paranoid individual who wishes to discuss the less legal aspects 
of the scene! :)

For more info on SFNET, it can be dialled from home on (415) 824 8747, 
and there are local numbers that cover the bay area.  CRL can be 
contacted at subscriptions@crl.com

Keep the Faith,

Fergal.

Hey, shout-outs and many thanks go out to everyone who helped compose that
massive response to my original post, giving me the warm fuzzies by making me
feel wanted.

HOWEVER, I have run out of tapes to send, so the following people need to send
me a blank tape with at least 30 minutes' of space total so I can dub it and
send it right back to you.

tape or I have already told you to send me a blank.

Don't worry about a stamp on your return envelope, I can take care of that. 
However, it's about 60 cents sending a cassette tape WITHOUT CASE via postal
service one way.

(Re: the question mark moon last night)

In case anyone's interested, the two bright objects near the moon
right now are Jupiter and Venus.  Venus is the one that made the
"question mark" dot with the crescent moon.  Vector off yer butt to the
window right now and (here in SF @ 8 PM, anyway) you'll get a good view of
all three.  Venus has cruised way off to the right of the moon and
Jupiter is above and to the right closer in to the moon.

-H-

(BTW: while on the topic of astronomy, anyone who is making a flyer
for a party in the near future should check out the Hubble images of
the Eta Carinae nova remnant... it's on the space telescope web site,
http://marvel.stsci.edu.  They look like they were taken right from
Industrial Light and Magic :-)

well, we already have sunset on sundays.  thoust canst dance thy buttocks 
off and cleanse thy soul of those nasty sins we have all committed (come 
on, you know you have!)

	on a side note ab out sunset, the last one i attended a while 
back was really cool.  the most striking thing i remember about it, 
though were some of the local kids (the ones doing the somersaults down 
the hill that made everyone cheer!)  I heard them as they were leaving 
saying "yeah, man, i come to sunset every sunday!"  really made me feel 
good...deepfog

Susan is looking for a decent monitor, hopefully one that will do double 
duty as a monitor for YSH w/o getting blown. Does anyone have one they 
would like to sell?

If not, where is the best place to get Community sound stuff?

Any other suggestions are very much appreciated as well :)

No, it's just that Microsoft Mail is brain-dead, and returning bounced 
mail to you instead of to sfraves-owner (i.e. me).  I removed that 
address, so things shouldn't bounce back now.  Thanks for the notice.

Hanging The Monitor - A few questions for the DJs out there -

 I was wondering what the preferred placement of monitor speakers are
for DJs ?

 If there was only one speaker ( left and right channels blended together ),
where would you want it placed? behind you? next to you? in front of you,
above the mixer? in front , behind the mixer? Or - someplace else?

 What about a stereo pair of monitor speakers?

Yep, our pals from San Diego are back, so be sure to check them out.  
Four nights of frenzied fun.  This time they'll be at the CW Saloon on 
Wed. and Thurs. and the Berkeley Square on Fri. and Sat.  If your sorry 
you missed Burning Man do go see Crash Worship for the drums and fire you 
desire.  You won't regret it (unless you catch on fire like the guy at 
their last show here).  I'll be at the Friday show, and maybe the 
Saturday show after the Dead (I'm going to a DEAD show?!?!? Oh, wow, man).  
But they should start earlier this time, so get there before they sell out.  
Should be about $10 for each show.

David

I flew back to Portland on Tuesday morning with 3 hours of sleep, and
it's been 18 hour days since then, so this is a little stale, but I
though I should throw in some comments about last weekend.

Probably it was the best overall weekend I've had musically in half
a year.  I came into SF on Friday but couldn't go out due to work
commitments.  Saturday, I worked late and then went over to Ameba around
1 am for the Chemistry map point.  Things were hopping, lots of good
energy which is really great to see on Haight St. after dark.  Didn't
leave until late since I was trying (somewhat unsuccessfully) to untangle
a hardware conflict in the Ameba computer, so when I arrived at the 2nd St.
warehouse right at 3, most people were gone and I heard from the few who
remained about the scuffles and the bust.  So I was out $20 and the price
of a can of food.  As it turned out - surprise, surprise - this was
indicative of the old story, that the higher the price for the party,
the lower the probability of it working out.  It broke my several-month
streak of no busts, too . . . 

So I went over to the Troc (long time, no see), and I must say that Groove
Kitchen was a very pleasant affair.  It doesn't take long to see from the
energy of a party what the attitude of the promoters is, and Preston
delivers a positive time over and over again.  I experienced much less of
the scrimmaging on the floor that I've gotten used to in the last year,
and while the crowd wasn't overly friendly I'd give them credit for
attentiveness to the music and each other.  I missed out on John Howard
and Markie, but Mark Farina was in full swing on three tables.  I'm not
a big fan of Mark's selections generally - don't get me wrong, he's
a technically superb DJ - but I enjoyed the mix a bit more than usual
this time.  

Afterwards, Mark and Tracy Ameba and I went over to 24th and Chillinois
to check out the remains of the Chemistry lab explosion :-)  But all we
found were a bunch of people hanging around, with a couple of car sound
systems playing aggrotechno.  A couple of people told us they'd been
waiting around for up to four hours for something to get together, I guess
it never did.  So we went up to the top of Potrero Hill to watch the new
moon and the sun rise.

Sunday I went over to M and P-ter's for a little Visual Basic lesson, 
helped them load M's CD mixer gear in the car and then BARTed and ACTranned
over to the Berkeley Marina (their car being jammed with audio stuff).
Nice sunny and somewhat breezy weather.  I hadn't been to Sunset before
and the few Marina events I've been to have all been on the Bay side, so
it was a little surprising to see where the setup was behind the first
rise, but it really is a great spot during the day when it's breezy.
Had an excellent time talking with folks I haven't seen much of, and Tony
and the other DJs put in solid sets.  It was really cool to stand up on
the ridge at sunset with everyone and watch the sun slip behind Mt. Tam
while the beats chugged on and we all cheered and rushed down the hill!

We left early and missed another of Markie's renowned sets to help Gregg
set up for the New Moon party at his house in El Cerrito.  The basement
was set up as the ambient room, and the upstairs was the performance and
dance space.  I spun a few tracks while we were setting up in the basement,
but as it turned out I spent most of the evening upstairs.  

It really was a great party, although I know Gregg was sweating bullets
for a while as it got quite crowded after midnight, but I think even
despite the visit from the local gendarmes things worked out very well.
I thought Scottie and Tracy both did excellently on the turntables, and
I can see now why Tracy got such great reviews from her Sunset gig.
You GO, girl!

But the highlight of the evening for me really happened early on, as 
M and Ovid finally were able to do their ambient/spoken word performance
in a space that really did it justice.  The acoustics of Gregg's big room
were amazingly right for this effort.  M warmed up for half an hour or
so -- it's really fun to watch someone practically get en-tranced as they
mix, you can do that with ambient!  She built up a *wicked* overlaying
of environmental sounds (crickets!, her trademark of course :) and textures,
and then Ovid began his quantum-physics-philosophy rap (with a special
section on the Kabbalah this time).  And Sean set up an audio-modulated
laser that was just the right amount of visual attraction/distraction for
the musical/spoken word performance.  It was amazing to see people step
into the room while this was going on and simply not understand it for
a moment or two, then sort of fall into the swirl.  I really think that
this ought to be done again, perhaps in a planetarium or other auditorium
space set up for this kind of performance, or even better outside.  
It does require a minimum of distracting noises to work, but it's worth it!

I was very pleased to meet some of the East Bay crew for the first time,
including Gregg and Scottie and the other MESS folks and so on.  I felt
like this was an overdue connection and may help expand the sfraves net
a little wider and stronger as a result . . .

Monday evening I went over to the Club Deco on Larkin in the City and had
a really good time (after stopping first at Blues on Lombard to see my
friend Mitch playing with Johnny Nitro and the Doorslammers :).  Dub Tribe
had just begun playing when I arrived, and they did an energetic set to
a small crowd in the room behind the bar, followed by a nice close-up set
from Ernie Munson.  I also saw Randy and Buck (who's moving to the UK
"for good", or so he says).  Turns out I missed a good event here in
Portland Saturday night, both Buck and Dub Tribe had a real good time
up here, which I was glad to hear since Dub Tribe had been poorly
treated by some of the locals when they were here last year.

Anyway, all in all it was a great weekend, and I'm glad the scene is
holding up well!

thanks to cap'n crunch for the great story about your arizona 
trek.
thanks also for the sobering look at our nation's contempt for 
its own indigenious
people. for what? COAL?!?!?!? how sad....watched a good movie , 
called thunderheart, that dealt with a similar crisis created 
by the mindfucking myriad
of gov't policies aimed at sucking dry the spirit of native 
americans, while simultaneously raping their resources, while 
simultaneously supressing the invaluable 
knowledge of the real and spiritual realms that they have 
acquired through the centuries. pretty impressive(read "scary")

at your next rave, when the vibe is racing through your heart 
and soul, send some their way...way good karma

peace

We were the map point for a party again this weekend, and thats always sa 
bit touchy because map points are always for young crowds who are used to 
getting burned by promoters and stopped by police. I do it for two 
reasons: for people to see that we are a bit more than a retail 
establishment by actively participating in our scene, and also to show 
new people that we ARE a retail establishment. Some times we do it for 
free , some times we accept money, last week Dutch gave us $50. Plus I 
get to spin while people get directions....for better or worse.

I saw an article laura wrote for Iron Feather journal about DJing, it was 
cool!

Wickeds new sound system works. King street was more king street than ever,
hot and sweaty, good crowd, no escape, Garth is really ON since he 
returned from a 3 week trip! NOW WHEN'S the FREE PARTY? 

The tables are open.....salutations, allen@ameba

The article in Iron Feather is acutally a reprint of something I wrote
over a year ago and is archived on hyperreal somewhere . . . I keep
meaning to update it as I've learned more and can better explain some
things.  

Anyway, if anyone has a copy of Iron Feather I'd love to see it as they
have not sent me a copy yet.  If you'd like to see the article you can
pick it off of the hyperreal ftp site.  It's in music/djs/djguide.laura

	Last night I witnessed and participated in one of the greatest
	parties I have ever been to. Caliban and I mailed you all about it	
	and lots of SFRavers and internet dwellers were there.

	The place was Terrences house. Its a large space with seemingly
	endless rooms, a massive dance area with hardwood floor which
	opens into the outside massive backyard. At the end of the backyard
	is a large room with one wall missing so its open to the air.

	The place was decorated to the hilt- the entry room was the "black
	room" with black beanbags and black plastic walls and tv monitors,
	it continued into a dark hallway which opened into the large 	
	dance area. There were two sitting rooms off of the dance area
	and the dance area opened into a backyard which was aglow with
	the huge FreeFall black light banners and a fountain. There was a
	FREE bar and awesome FREE food from Ole. Past the food and drinks
	was the ambient area where Caliban spun the greatest ambient set
	in history- his signature sound incorporates classic electronic 
	music, spoken word, a scanner, custom made Weird Blinking Lights
	tapes (he records at the WBL studios and our live sets- he also
	is 1/3 of WBL), and infinite myriads of music and sounds. Some
	of his spoken word were Isaac Asimov, Eldridge Cleaver, Marashi
	Yogi etc... Weird Blinking Lights appeared in instrumental form
	in the middle of his set with a set of live instruments and then
	he spun out of it deeper into Calibanland. The ambient room was
	spacious with couches, lights and a great sound system- all open to
	the warm night air.

	On the dance floor were many djs- but the ones I knew were DRC and
	Cairo. All of the DJS were PUMPIN all night with the finest trance,
	acid, and techno. Not a single HOUSE beat was heard all night long
	(we could pay $20.00 for Wicked if we want house and YES I will
	freely flame that and get flamed for it). The sound was LOUD and
	high energy trance all night long I left about 5:00am or so
	and the entire place was still packed.

	People I hadn't seen in *years* were there and geeks from all over
	were there. It went all night long and I'm sure is still going even
	as I'm writing this. Everyone had a smile on their face.

	It was truly one of the greatest parties I have ever seen and
	big applause to Terrence, Cairo, Ole, Buttercup and the rest of their
	crew for the amazing party. Weird Blinking Lights had a blast
	generating sound. Terrence and his crew are really into music and
	took a lot of time and care to make sure that all the sound was
	plentiful and great sounding.

	Our scene is very much alive.

You know, you can park in the boat parking lot for free, you don't have 
to look for a space on the street.  Look for the red blinking light on 
the left.

I heard a rumor that Sunset would cease after two more weeks.  Anyone 
have the truth of this matter?

P.S.  Naked Man is back! Sunset keeps getting even more amazing...

Subject: Interstellar CD (Lamo NET response)
Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

Hi.  Well there's still a pile of Interstellar CD left and honestly, I am
really quite surprised that the response by netters has been so, well, lame.
 I've always thought of us as the more hardcore ravers set, but out of
thousands of us, less than ten people have ordered the cd (a THOUSAND) were
pressed.

The CD again, was pressed to benefit all those who shoveled out major cash to
do the Interstellar Outback party, and even though it had major problems,
there are still many bills to be paid.

For just $11 bucks, which includes postage, you can hear some of the people
that where there DJing or playing live (as well as some that couldn't make
it:)
Many strong names are on it as well as new names that you'll be hearing more
of (this being a first release for some).  Also, these songs are only
available on this CD!

If you can find it worth $11 with shipping to check them out, all the great
bands and DJs appearing on it that didn't get to play for you would really
appreciate it.  They are shipping now and I promise they will provide you
with listening pleasure for a long time.

Also, anyone who has ordered the CD, post a review or reply to me personally
and tell me what you think!  Your input is appreciated as it will help on the
next one (which your support now will be remembered).


                                                        INTERSTELLAR OUTBACK
                                                           THE CD COMPILATION

A limited edition of 1,000 Compact Discs have been pressed TO be sold with
all profits going to pay those nasty bills that are accumulating to produce
the Interstellar Outback party.
The CDs (73 minutes) will be sold for a limited time on the net for $10 plus
$1 shipping and
for $8 at the party (so it would actually save you money to go and have a
great time!!!).
Hows that for advertising skill:)

The CD includes a 4 color insert of the flyer and a WIDE variety of music
from those artist
(both DJs and Bands) that will be attending the party.  All tracks were
recorded digitally and they're Phat!  There is a great representation of the
RAVE scene here with everything from:
HardCore, Jungle, Trance, House, Acid, and Ambient.  Do yourself a favor and
those who have
worked to hard to produce all aspects of Interstellar Outback the party and
donated their time,
money and music for the CD.  Check it out.

Thanks,
EllisD

I didn't get to Wicked until 3:30 am or so but I got to see the altar of 
water bottles piled up outside which people couldn't bring in.

I could tell from when the dude was frisking me outside that it was
packed solid and goin' off because my glasses were already steamed and I
could see nothing and I wasn't even in the door yet. Once inside I
couldn't get over the steam factor... just standing there made me sweat.  
Walking around bumping into people drenched with sweat is very bizarre, 
if there's any skin contact from arms or whatever there's this slipping 
effect.  Nuts.

The house was a very deep, consistent, danceable beat, but I didn't hear as 
much cheering as usual for Wicked parties.  The guy with the fruit hat made 
for a great energy boost for me while I tried my hardest to stay up on 
the "dancing turf" as denoted by the painted lines.  It's just such a 
tight squeeze!  So far I'd say I like wicked's at Townsend more because 
of the room and slightly better air circulation... And it's got that 
close encounters disco light right in the middle too.

Well last Saturday Wicked finally unveiled the long awaited sound system
that we have all been paying and waiting for.  Indeed the sound quality 
is quite formidable.  I was there during setup in the early afternoon and
was concerned because I could here every pop and crackle on the records
being played, (this is what happens when you get good response over 11k HZ.)
Still It seems to me that the system that they have (6 huge bass cabinets,
6 tops) is best suited for outdoor use, this comming full moon should prove
to be quite amazing.  Still when the club got full around 2, it was clearly 
the best sound that I have heard come out of a PA in all my days.

Although the room did not do it justice.  They set up their bass bins
in fornt of and two each side of the DJ (the DJ was is their usual King Street
location) with two mid cabinets on top of each Bass stack, and then a mid
at each end of the room in the back.  I think if they had 2 more bass bins,
and two more mid cabs and deployed them 4 for 4 at the points of the room,
it would have been absolutely unreal, but alas the sound in the 1 st half of
the club (closest to the DJ was still absolutely amazing, while in the back,
with King Street packed the way it normally gets, all the bass energy was 
absorbed by the bodies on the dance floor.

I got to hear all of the sets of all of the DJ and while they were good
and consistant for a Wicked, they didn't "blow me away" still I've never seen
Jeno so animated in all my days, he was clearly getting off on the effect
that this sound system was having on the crowd and almost looked like Carlos
in the way he was going at the tables :).  Garth was the hero of the evening
and played a very good "crowd pleaser" set. Complete with new stuff 
"just off the boat from London".  All in all, the FMR on the 19th should be
interesting.

It's true, I saw Jeno's head nodding and while looking out at the crowd -
Milton will back me up on this -  he smiled.

I got to Wicked at around 3 and managed to catch the last chunk of Jeno
and the first half of Garth before succumbing to the heat, humidity and
boomy acoustics that make King St. one of my least favorite venues.
If you like incessant no-escape pounding in a crowded zero-comfort sweatbox,
then this was certainly the place to be.  The sound system was big and loud;
I'm looking forward to the upcoming FMR for a sonically religious exper-
iance.  The people there  all seemed to be having fun, but after a couple 
of hours of paying homage I had had enough and and decided to check out
Terance's party on 14th st.  

I tend to get claustrophobic at house parties, but figured that this
wouldn't be any worse than King St.  I was delighted to find an incredibly
comfortable space: beanbagged chill space and a large dance room that 
opened into an even larger outdoor patio.  It was like the End-up minus
bar and beautifuly decorated as well; huge colorfully painted sheets,
video monitors, etc.  Also plenty of free food & drink.  The sound
was crisp & clean with music more of the techno/trance variety.  The vibe
was great with a nice mix of colorful folks.  I wished I had started my
evening here.  By 6:30 it was thinning out and the DJ's mixing had become
quite horrid, perhaps due to technical problems.

Sunset was absolutely wonderful.  The crowd was even bigger than last
week, 3-4 hundred strong.  I thought the vibe was better too.  This is one
happy party.  Solar, Galen, Spun & La Paix had fine sets.  I delivered
12 pages of sunset posts to Galen - I'm sure they'll make him smile.  The
blinking lights, strobe and black light display added a nice touch to the
evening.  There seemed to be a little bit more garbage strewn about this
time, so next week, we're gonna try to remember to bring some garbage bags.

There were a lot of sfravers in attendance - I was a little too tired to
be real sociable but we got to meet David Alves (hi david :) - it's
always fun to meet virtual people in the flesh.

My understanding is that there will be 4 more, to Oct 9th.  Also on the
friday the 23rd, the Autumn Equinox, look out for "Sunrise", an evening
party currently planned to be free, outdoor and near the city.

this is enthusiastic but maybe misleading

cryptic bartender on the phone

I went to Deco on Friday.  
The main floor was crowded with popular hiphop.
The basement was open with another dj and sound system.  
Friendly people.  I like this bar.  It is cozy.

I got to Sunset at sunset.
I met Lee (!) and Janie and Brie plus I saw lots
of the usual beautiful faces!!  I am really looking
forward to the Friday night outdoor party.  Will
this be the end of the marina summer parties?

It seemed to be more like music selection and mixing.  The last DJ came on
and everybody stopped dancing and turned and looked at the DJ...  But the
party was incredible until about 6:00.  Cool Weird Blinking Lights in the
outdoor ambient area at the back of the patio, too.  For once I could dance
as hard as I wanted and not be miserably hot.

DRC and Cairo in particular had really hot sets.  I just couldn't stop
dancing; nice hard trance with more than a hint of industrial in it.

    WeakEnd Rave report
    ===================
    By Cap'n Crunch
    

Ahhh!  My first weekend back in Bay Area after the last two weeks trekking
around the Western USA.     I see that WICKED was at the King St Garage.
Bummer!!   Won't be going to WIDKED *this* time.   The last time I was
at King St venue,   I had to have my lungs pumped to remove all the horrible
stale smoke residue from my lungs.    I'm STILL trying to pay the $750 medial
bill.

Instead,  this relly cool dude Terrance decided on a whelm to throw a very
good party.    It was FREE,  with free food,  VERY GOOD MUSIC and dancing
with a very loud and clean sounding sound system,   as long as one of the
speaker banks was functioning.    I walk in,  and was greeted with a small
room and chill area,  couches and pillows everywhere.

I walk down this long hallway,  towards the music and was in this fairly
small,  and very cool (in temperature) dance area,  with clean,  powerful
sounds,  coming from two speaker banks on each corner of the room.

It didn't take me long to start dancing.   So I wasted no time,   and
just dug into the great energy of the vibe.   There were nothing but smilea
and luv,  all around the place.

It took me a while to realize it,  but the back wall was missing,   which
goes to an outside chill and schmooze area.    There were tables,  chairs
(not many),   and at the far end,  a free bar,  serving all kinds of drinks.

Out back (really towards the front),  a side area hosted another sound
system,  playing ambient.   There were sofas,  pillows,  and other soft
things to lay down on.

Near the dance area,  there was what I would call the sex room,   with
a TV monitor,   showing all the things you can do woth your "private parts".
The floor was covered with matresses,   and one can only guess at what
they were used for.

A smaller room had a comfortable futon,  and another mat,  where people
were laying down,  resting from dacing.

It's hard to tell how many people were there,   but I would guess at somewhere
between 150-200 people.    A larger proportion of the folks were gay when
compared with other small private parties,  but all were very interesting
to talk to.

The music (provided by local talant),  was new and refreshing,  and although
"beat matching" wasn't perfect ALL the time,    it still kept me on the dance
floor most of the time.

Around 6 am,  Pollywog spun some rather eklectic stuff,  but opened with a
horrendous hard acid trance that caued me to leave this planet.   She took
me back to earth (somehwhat faster than I expected,    but it was "different".

Towards the end,  the music became less dancable,  but I DID meet Frazer and
Frank and the Megatripolus crowd.    Just a reminder,   Megatripolus starts
on 1st Oct.

-------

After the party,   I head over to Boogie Buffet,  and was not that impressed
with the lack of patrons.    The pillows were most welcome,  and I tranced
out and did metitation to some nice mellow ambient music preceeding the Acid
Jazz things they play.    At one point,  the DJ played some house,  but was
repremanded for doing so.

No more $2 pancakes like they Used to serve,   a lot less than the old "Buffet",
but the $4 cover charge at least made up for it.    Next,  I dropped into the
EndUp to say hi to some friends.

Aaahhh!! Nothing like a Sunday Morning on South of Market....   Boogie Buffet
closed earlier, and figured it was about time to head out to the Berkeley
Matina and Sunset.    I sure wasn't dissapointed...  

-------------
SunSet party
-------------

When I arrive,  I find about 50 people milling around,  with the sound system
playing ambient and slow dance stuff.    I take the opportunity to meet and
schmooze with a few friends,   and gradually,  the beat pickes up and
immediatly I start dancing,  digging into the music and the visuals of
a perfect sunney Sunday afternoon in the park.   People were sunbathing,
flying kites,  playing frisbee,   and romping with their pets.

The music got down into some good funkey deep house,  with lots of sound
nuances embellishing some synth,  and other mind fucking "ear candy",
tickling my ears as I hoppped from speaker to speaker,  discoverng some
interesting "Phasing effects" from all the moving around.    Eventually,
things got so crowded that moving around was not possible.   I would
guess the crowed swelled to about 500 during the peak of this event.

I simply got lost into the music,  allowing it to have total control
over my body.    My knees completly healed how,  thanx to my exercises,
allowed me to be engrossed into doing some crazy motions without complaint.   
After about 3 hours of continious dancing,   some slight break in the 
music,  let me go...  So I struck out to discover who else was around.    

All the usual SFRavers were there,   and almost immediatly,  people come
up and say they haven't seen me for a while.   Wish I could be in two
places at once!!

This was the BEST Sunset party I've been to,   I sure hope it can contniue
to exist for a while longer.

The music finally stopped (Well after sunset - Around 10 pm),   and I
say to myself... "It's GREAT to be back"...   and head home...

Later...
The Cap'n

I have to echo a lot of John's sentiments.  I had a great time (and no, Rob, it
 was NOT
my first party since I moved here, but it's been so long, it felt like it).
 Didn't get to meet
as many people as I would have hoped, but given the crowd, that's to be
 expected.

MAJOR HASSLE:  I arrive in a car with a friend; the close parking lot is filled.
  We are
told to go to the other area of the park about 10 miles away, and take a shuttle
 bus
back to the rave.   We arrive, we party, we get tired, we decide to go home at
 about 5:30.
  We arrive at the parking lot and discover that there is no return shuttle to
 wherever the
hell our car is parked.  The prospect of walking ten or so miles with majorly
 numb feet
(OK, so I forgot to put socks on with my Tevas - sue me) was a major bummer, but
 we
managed to talk a departing driver and friends into giving us a lift.  So I
 guess all's well
that ends well.

Paul

P.S.  Despite earlier posts to some, the President was not at Camp David last
 night.
However, he did know about the rave, as I gave him a flyer on Saturday morning,
 and
told him to stop by and visit a few thousand friends.

Yes, Wicked was a little hotter than normal and that sound system had me
dancin hard and nearly non-stop.  I've had so many good times at a packed
King St.  I was so sweat-soaked that I accidentally experienced the Hendrix
headband effect.  That feedback jam was amazing and provided a welcome break,
actually the DJs weren't as Wicked as they can be and there seemed to be more
beatless breakdowns -- either that or I just appreciated them more.  Good
thing it was housey and not non-stop hardcore or I would've passed out.  Was
the closing track that recent Dust Brothers thang? All I could tell was that
it was on Junior Boys Own...

wickedly wrecked,

Mijo, i don't know if youve been to Sunset yet, but that's where your young
high schoolers go, and they create an excellent vibe. A freind was
observing how much "the newer generation" loved dancing, and how free of
speed, etc..

This summer has been one where I've skipped the older parties and hit
things like chemistry and Sunset, where there is loads of love and warmth.
These "kids"are our family, too, and we've been sitting on our asses about
age discrimination or even shunning them at some parties. 

Glad you liked their vibe, but to all sfravers, fight age discrimination,
and more power to Lizette and her Go Figure (all ages, for the right
reasons)!

Lotsa luv, 
 Milton and the E-Bee

Jes, mijos, he did! He even started some side-side dancing for a song
somewhere near the end, a little bobbing, and smiled on several occasions.

i Mijos ! This has been one sloppy party! Ok, Ok, I enjoyed myself,
excellent music, we are all in awe of your system, great job, people. But
why the King? The Captain can't be the only person who hates the place.Hmm,
lemme see what's bein' said...

Why buy an excellent system and stick it in there?

If you like incessant no-escape pounding in a crowded zero-comfort sweatbox,
then this was certainly the place to be.

And Willis wong goes on:

If all that sweat was dance induced, great, but you can get the same effect
on a packed bus with closed windows!

That's because the people  were packed and hot, the floor was too wet and
muddy to sit down on, and there was "rave detritus" that stuck to your feet
on the dance "floor."I never saw one person jump up and down and scream
like at other parties, we were beat by the heat, and our vibe fed back to
the Djs, and they responded in kind. Very sloppy dancing by all of us,
compared to other Wickeds.

Good point!

Did you (WICKED) all hear that? It ain't just me. Either get the King's
owners to get a ceiling exaust or put some sorta giant, portable, fan in
the corridor door to let us survive the night. Or just get a better place
next time. It's not easy to throw a party,duh,  especially Wicked, but
jeez, plan ahead and get us some space, too many people we love didn't show
or said  "the King, aw, man, not there!" early that night. 
By the way, how about some chill equipment? Rest is essential. We want
bags! We want bags!We want bags! We want bags!We want bags! We want bags!
Hey, still a great party, and I'm ready to be blown by the moon. 
Lotsa love,
 Milton and the E-Bee........

Right on, Mijo! If Jordan does try, we must mobilize. We would all be
hypocritical, lying or just full of shit if we don't stand by the younger
raver's right to party, after all the talk of "I love you" and "there was a
real family vibe" at some party. Sunset can't be the only place all agers
can go, and Carlos and the rest of CDC provide at least a "young" weekly 
and the odd all ager. But there has to be more acceptance, a word I heard a
lot about this scene before joining it.

I'm not down on Wicked parties cuz of heat.  I'm not asking them for 
this or that, because I'm just glad that there is something like Wicked to 
choose from.  Just like Cap'n Crunch said he chose not to go because he 
knows King St. and anyone else could do the same, right?  

I knew it was going to be a sweatbox from going last month, but I was 
just amazed at how much more it was this time - wHOA!  It would be cool 
to have more vents or something but if it doesn't happen then so be it.

Yes, that is actually one of the reasons why I like going to Wicked is for
a little bit of sweat.  If a little bit turns into a lot then it just
takes more skill not to slip.  Sure its nasty but it does seem to fit the
whole theme of it all and a lot of people don't seem to mind.  When I get
home and peel off my multiple-smoke-filled-dripping-wet clothes I always
think "man, that sure was wicked!" and fall asleep until whenever...

The 1015 basement Wicked's, truely Hard House sweat boxes have made many
a true believer.  I must say that I really miss those parties.

The thing that made this one bad is that you couldn't go out side, but
when a club is hot and steammy and packed, it gets, well sensual, If you are
there to "look good" your make-up will be threw within 5 minutes.
Think about it more like a sweat lodge.

..... was the shit, not in spite of, but *because* of the head and sweat.
There was access to water, so it was OK, one of a range of sensual options.
Loved it, evn though I don't usually like King St. a tall.  cool & clean &
outdoors has its place, so does heat, dripping rafters, and lots 'o' skin.

Partime Job available @ InterNex - Customer Suppport

We have a small parttime job availabe for someone with a small amount
of computer experience.  Basically you would be working for me in customer
support.  This would entail mostly answering phones, filling out "trouble
tickets" when customers call in with problems, and some moderately interesting
jobs like configuring customer router and bridge hardware before it is shipped,
(if you can read and touch type, you can do this).  You would work about
4 hours a day and the pay is around $10/hr.  Our offices are in Menlo 
Park so this would be a great job if you go to Stanford or San Jose State.

We are pretty flexible at InterNex, no dress codes or bullshit like that.

If you like it here and we like you, the job could definitely expand into
something bigger.


Send all inquiries to geoffw@internex.net

Obrave: as of right now I and everyone who works for me are ravers.

Actually, tickets for this event is NOT available in SF. I tried
unsuccessfully to get tickets yesterday at two different places. The
seller had no difficulties in finding the event within the database; the
problem was that the printers would not actually print out the tickets
correctly.  This is a system-wide problem that BASS has acknowledged. 
Unfortunately, they don't want to do anything about it right now.

OBrave plug: I'll be spinning down in LA this Friday at Kevin Haskin's (of
Love & Rockets) birthday party/rave. This will be a small event of about
200 people and will be invite only. However, that doesn't prevent me from
having a list and letting as many people as I want in (within reason
anyways). If you're going to be in LA this Friday and want to go, drop me
a line and I'll try to put you on the list. See you there! 

p.s. Some guy named Taylor will be spinning there also. =)

An earlier review mentioned the pile of water bottles outside.

Can someone please explain the reasoning behind this? I assume that 
"access to water" means free access - so why prohibit water bottles ?

The Venue prohibits water bottles so that they can make money by selling
bottled water.  Water is also available in the bathrooms for free, and I had no
trouble getting a cup of ice for free.  I don't mind this too much since
the deal that is usually made is that the promoter gets the door and the
club gets the bar, I also think that's part of the reason that the temperature 
is as hot as it is (although it *is* a tradition for indoor Wickeds to be
as hot as hell :)

Excuse me, but it does  seem like Wicked has their sound system, and it

Just wanted to say that I wass't complaining in the least. Yes, House -
Hot(both ways) and Sweaty - packed dancefloor - WICKED!  It's an enviroment
and I love 'em.  Of course, heat, sweat and house music don't make a wicked -
plenty of parties have had that and more or less sucked.  You know you've
been to a wicked party - you *remember* them and its a cool contrast to the
FMRs and other outdoor events.  Milton was relaying some other attendees
feelings who asked him to do so and since he was wearing a dress,  I don't
know what he was complaing about - unless that bra was chafing him ;-)

I got a sense that the "Overdosegrrrl" felt somehow superior for having
"died" and come back to life.  I was especially irked by her unctious
praise of her disciples for having saved her life (Uh, like who wouldn't
dial 911!).

Wow!  Like, here's a woman who's really been to the edge!  I see a crowd of
lesser mortals asking "what was it like?".   "Were you drawn to a pillar of
light?"  "Did you see god?"

Are we supposed to be impreesed that she has an enviable job and yet is
able to do heroin?  Is this some kind of post-modern fashion statement:  I
am successful but I have an edge.  Try piercing your tongue and working for
Apple Computer, that would be much safer.

What I got out of it was no matter how carefull, and how intelligent you are,
when using drugs, you can 1) overdose/kill yourself, and 2) become addicted.
In addition I think this post also served to thank those who loved her enough
to respond quickly and stay by her side throughout the whole ordeal.  It also
seemed to serve as a way to resolve her own feelings on the matter.

At any rate this individual deserves our compassion and our most positive
of energies.  It is clear the rave scene is different in all parts of the
country
which is also probably reflected in the drug of choice at raves.  I think it
should also serve as a warning to all of us out here to not allow ourselves
to follow in those footsteps and continue to work hard to promote positive
vibes at our events, which only comes from bringing a great attitude with
you to an event and sharing it with those around you.

Enough ranting from me,

Ron.

I'd say as much as clothes or attitude.

Think Velvet Underground, David Bowie, Jane's Addiction and heroin.

Not to mention X and raving (before you flame, think about
perceptions of others - those who read the Chron, etc. Fashion
has to do with perceptions of a gesamt).

Hey, y'all. Time for my first truly rave-related post, with no mention of
lawyers, contractors or the Fire Department...

Does anyone know of any raves or house parties in the Santa
Barbara/Goleta/San Luis Obispo area?  My former sysadmin is in Lompoc,
California and I'm trying to get him into this. Any info on ongoing
parties, semi-regular promoters or whatever would be appreciated.

Aside from the previous explanations, a promoter told me that another
reason they don't want water bottles because of GHB or any substance other
than water.  In some of the raves I went to during the summer in LA, they
only allowed me to bring in water that was bottled.  (I had a bottle that
was opened during the car ride down to the rave, which I had to leave
outside.) But it defenately (?) is a rip off when a bar sells bottled
water $2.00 when you can buy the same little bottles in packs of 6 for
$1.69!

This may sound like a promo but actually it is only a praise.

Yesterday I was fortunate to get an advance copy of DRC's new tape
"Eargazmika".  I've heard her spin live on a couple of occasions and she
can be very fierce. She has captured that killer set very well on this tape
with a mixture of tribal-techno/trance.

Now for those of you who saw her spin at Terrance's party last weekend I'm
but envious as I've managed to miss all of her bookings of late.  I wish
she would spin more.  I guess the clubs are not ready for her
yet!...although I hear she will spin at the opening of Megatropolis, Oct.
1st.  Anyone has info on that?

If you see her at BPM records, say hi.

Denis,  ravnbird@crl.com

There's always a decent crowd and good sounds and plenty of 
liquids and air.  There's free passes at Outer Rhythm Records and other 
places in San Jose... I have extra ones if anyone wants.  See you there eh?

I'm involved with a group called the Justice League Sound System in SB who
put on most of the events there, although now that I live in SF I don't
make it down as frequently. We do a free beach party called Horizon the
first Sat. of the month, occasional one-offs (we might be doing an outdoor
event in 3-4 weeks) and a weekly called Justice. For info on all of the
above call 805.899.7336. It's a small, but very friendly and energetic
scene there. Ironically about half of the people who were in it 1-2 years
ago have now moved to SF, but that seems to be a trend all over.

There was another group, the League of Spiritual Discovery, that put on a
cuple of weeklies and one-offs, but they haven't done anything for a few
months and I think their voicemail has been disconnected.

There are a lot of people in the scene in SLO as well, but no regular
events that I'm aware of.

Actually, Monty, who spins at Justice every week and is my pick for Next
Big Dj (TM) is spinning at Sunset this week.

[ Bileous remarks about a person he's never met deleted. ]

You really make me sad.  China (overdosegrrrl) is an actual
physical real-life friend of mine, and here you go judging
someone you've never met who is trying to communicate something that
happened to her and her circle of MidWest Raves friends.

Personally, I don't think Susie should have ever reposted China's
post here, simply because the SFRaves list membership doesn't have 
the context to understand China or her relationship with other 
net-ravers at all.

China is truly one of the more interesting and beautiful (*and I'm
not meaninging solely in the physical sense*) people I have ever met.
I don't think for a second that she ever should have stuck that needle
in her arm . . . but I'd NEVER accuse her of holding herself up to
be "superior" after her experience.

Where is your PLUR?

It's not "really" the same people as the Megatripolis in London.
See, Frazer Clark and others founded Megatripolis in London.  After
a while there was a falling-out and Clark and the rest of the club went
their separate ways.  There was some kind of legal settlement where
the club in London could keep the name, and where Clark could use the
name in other ventures.

So it sort of is the same people . . . I find that whole crowd to be
so confusing, what with the Megatriplians, the UK-Zippies, the US-Zippies,
and so on. :-)

	I think this critism of China's thankfulness to her friends is a 
bit misplaced. If I have the situation right, she was not the only one 
who had shot up. Although I do not know how injecting herion differs from 
getting it in a pill doped with it, I can tell you herion is not a drug 
which motivates you to do things. This combined with the setting and the 
possiblity that her friends had taken some substance that night makes an 
act worthy of praise. Hell, in a lot of situations things days, people 
will walk right by a situation where someone needs medical attention 
without a second thought. Or of those that do stop (now this is just my 
experience, so it may not apply to all of reality) are much more 
interested with looking than with helping (or listening to those who have 
training in the realm of medical emergencies). Granted China was a 
friend, and most friends will call for help once they realize something 
is wrong, I still think she has a right to be as grantful to them as she 
is. Indeed she has been through something, something which the majority 
of us may not experience  (her comment of coming to and asking how she 
had gotten to the where-ever it is she was, ie. the hosiptal. The 
realization of what must have happened must have been something powerful, 
huge, whatever you want to call it, just something that most people do 
not experience in their lifetimes, as far as I can guess). I, myself, do 
not expect my friends to call 911 in such things happen. Indeed I would 
like them to, but their doing so is not 'contracted' in being my friend. 
This may be a shallow ideal of friendship (that one is not committed to 
saving a friend's life in all situations) but it is one I have adopted 
from experience. One cannot always save someone's life, but when an 
effort is made, it is nice to have the person express that he or she is 
glad you did it...
	In terms of the ODing to the point of the heart actually stopping
(well, she said she had no pulse, I guess that means she could have only
been in vfib, anyway...) I may be a bit biased here cuz I know someone
else who had a smimilar experience and she explained the coming to bit to
me. It changes your outlook on a lot of things...

	She wrote quite a bit about this. Her answer was no. She, like a 
lot of others who take drugs, is not a 'dead beat', nor a leech on 
society, nor an awful criminal who is going to rob to get her 'fix' (a 
line a cop once told me when they went over our car when the stereo was 
stolen)She did not fit into the categories that most of us put those who 
have let their drug use become an addiction (I should extend addiction to 
any habit that gets out of one's control, but for some reason this 
phenomona in the realm of drugs have been labeled adiction while outside 
that realm it is an obsession or the people is simply neurotic). If I 
remember correctly, China never said that her drug use made her harder 
than the rest of us, nor do I remember her being of the expressly 
'hardcore with attitude' type ( I used to be on some of te east coast 
mailing lists and heard much from her as she was on dcraves).
	I thought her post expressed a sentiment I wholeheartedly agree 
with,one taking responsiblity for one's drug use.  And she illustrated 
her point well: Here's what can happen to YOU, only you may not come 
back... 
Surfing the Aphex's sine waves

What piffle! OF COURSE opium is toxic to humans - people who OD 
are OD'ing because of the drug flowing through their veins, not because 
they're withdrawing.

Mijo, to the best of my info, I believe it's the Zippies, but that's just
what I've been told.Isn't that their club, the one they want to open all
over the world(including london?) The oct 1 party will be free, all ages,
etc.
Despite the weirdness in Santa Cruz and "our" negativity directed towards
them and their (to me)senseless posts, they did do a great party with Spaz
(remeber the Jupiter Bash?). Try 'em, they'll surprise you either way.

Lotsa love,

Well, I for one am glad to see that Susie posted China's story. Maybe it
will make others think twice before playing with fire. I for one saw it
as a post of someone who wanted to share her story about her brush with
her mortality. I thought that it was well written and I felt nothing but
compassion for her. I was glad to hear that she had no brain damage...
pretty amazing for being dead for 8 minutes as alot of people who have
been revived after drowning after only 3 minutes have suffered major
damage. She was verrry lucky. She was lucky that she wasn't alone.
I didn't feel that she came off as superior. She impressed me as being
genuine and happy to be alive.

I was just talking with my mom and she was saying that there was an effort
underway to rid San Diego of raves.  This, of course, comes after two 15
year olds were murdered outside of a rave-like party.
Apparently they would issue huge fines to promoters throwing illegal parties.
Has anyone else heard about this?

I didn't get a sense that she felt at all "superior" but that she was 
feeling (as most junkies coming off a binge...two months or twelve 
years... do) the rush of "reality" and life itself coming back.

I doubt it. Lots of us do it. Look at the people in the stock market. 
Lots & lots of junkies there. There's also a high rate amongst 
programmers. Think of it this way for a second: if your a junkie, 
what better way to support your habit than to keep your job that will 
pay for it? Lots of people work "better" on junk...floating, numb, 
quiet in the corporate world.

Try piercing your tongue and working for
> Apple Computer, that would be much safer.

It seems to me that you're completely missing the point. I know that 
a pierced tongue and keeping a good ("enviable" is appropriate too) 
job does not force one to explore the same, or even similar, aspects 
of life. A pierced tongue compared to junkiedom is kinda like 
comparing a fashionable haircut to having a terrible life-threatening 
accident on a Ducati.

There are (sort of) two groups of Zippies.  The rantings and what 
transpired in Santa Cruz were brought to us in part by the faction 
of Zippies that joined up with Clark in the US (or at least post-_wired_ 
article). Members of that group separated from Frazier 
Clark (or vice-versa) in Santa Cruz.

I'm not sure which Zip-group is doing Megatripolis, I'd assume since
Clark owns the name, it's his doing.  I just wonder where they're
going to have it?

>OF COURSE opium is toxic to humans

wrong. Overdose is an incredibly different circumstance than 
poisoning!

One of the hugest problems with opiate addictions is that the human 
body and opiates are so incredibly compatible. Physiological 
dependancy. And when an opiate-addicted person stops using the body 
goes into shock because it (the body) senses that the world itself is 
toxic.

amazing, and fascinating this body vs. lifestyle equations stuff! But not 
really rave-related anymore is it? Anybody that wants to continue 
this thread with me, that's great but let's get off the list with it

I encourage those who have an interest in this issue to read the cover
story from the Village Voice a couple of issues ago about heroin users.
It is not as clear-cut a thing as people make it out to be.  The
article, written by a long-time user, showed that the popular stereotypes
of junkies are just that - stereotypes, of which you can certainly find
real-life examples.  If anything, heroin seems to be an amplifier of

	reading on sfraves about four years ago about the
	'original version' of this cd being *far* superior
	to the later, edited version.  it also includes (or
	appears to) what is on the normal, single cd release.
	the question i have is is this the true original

	orbit cd total running time 55:32

	I have the single version, dated 1991 an printed in USA. So,
	either there is a third one or you have the right one (and I
	am missing 2 version :)

	I think that was the first ORB CD I bougth and one of my first
	ambient CD and it is still one of my favourites.

	BTW, what do you think of POMME FRITZ ? It's different from the
	usual ORB and I still don't know how do I like it.
	I was reading the posting on alt.music.orb and this seems to be

	Somebody on alt.music.orb also talked about a remix of Pink Floyd's
	"Wish you were here" with some Orb in it (Little fluffy clouds),

Dave,   Yes it is...   With the main person behind it being Frazer Clark,
one of the origional Zippies.    I've heard that Megatripolus will take
place in 2 locations.     Reports I've gotten have indicated that it's
to be at the Troc.    With the other location being some kind of warehouse.

Not sure about the music,   but I suspect it to be Hard Acid Trance,  
similar to Goa Gil's stuff,   around the 145 BPM range.  :-)

Briefly,  the Zippies have broken into two main factions.    The Angus,
Pinkus dudz have parted company from Frazer (One of the founding dudz,
and the person who founded the London Magatripolus).

Frazer is also starting up a club in Toronto in the near future as well.

All Ages?   At the Troc?   Hmmm!!  did they actually get their Caberet
license?    Perhaps they were speaking of this 2nd location that might
be an "all ages" venue.

I just want to point out the below this is a really good
attitude to have on this topic, IMO. I'm don't want this
to sound hipper-than-thou or snotty, but if you have never
been close with someone who is into heroin, than you probably
don't get it. There is so much misinformation and outright
myth surrounding the drug that most people out there don't
understand anything about what it really means. I'm not
endorsing it and I'm not 'condoning' it (does it matter,
really?), but people that criticize without having any
understanding of it should realize that they are (if I may
be a little harsh) talking out their ass.

Also, I have a pierced tongue and work at a computer company,
and resent the 'successful with an edge' comment. I'm proof
that is entirely possible to do both and be hopelessly unsuccessful.
(That's sarcasm, BTW.)

	I am quite looking forward this then. One last question. Is it 
going to be a weekly event (again, mirroring London)? It would be nice to 
have something like that around. If it is going to be a weekly, will it 
be held on Saturdays (like this first one on Oct. 1 is?) Thanks

Nope, they recently released the original 2-cd version in the states.

Heh.  It's very er... weird.  I wrote a review of it for Wired.  I 
basically said that if you can imagine Negativland meets Monty Python, 
you might like this.

There's a bootleg CD going around claiming to be Pink Floyd songs remixed 
by the Orb, but supposedly it's a hoax and very lousy musically.

If any of you were at Wicked last weekend, I was the guy who walked
by at about 12:30, thinking the line was too long.  Anyway, I went
over to the 14th St party someone posted about, and thought it was 
great.  This weekend, Organic is back - they've been some of the best
big parties lately.  Also, check out the boat party or Sunset on Sunday
and the full moon party on Monday.  Tonight, try the opening of Lube
or a good lineup at Pure Space...

Hey foulx,

Anyone hear about a fellow named Matthew Fox, who's reportedly helping
organize a "Rave Mass" in the basement of SF's Grace Cathedral in October? 

Just got done reading an article about this guy in SF Focus, and he mentions
this Rave Mass thingy, that supposedly emerged in Sheffield, England.
Evidently, some blokes from England (z#pp#es, maybe?) will be coming over to
help organize the shindig.

So, who's got the digs?

i've written this message quite a few times now cuz i keep deleting it

i dont want to sound preaching or judgemental or anything..
and i really dont think i have much to add that hasnt been said 
on the topic...

the one thing that sticks out to me though is this..

(i'll go through a bit of story time here :)

Last summer i was a counselor with this program for incoming students
to the University

The environment among the staff (also students) that is created is one 
of incredible safety and openess that permeates from the staff to the 
incoming students so that the environment is usually pretty unique
in allowing people to be and explore themselves.

One time, during this program, some 500 or so people were in a room
and we were watching a video about health/sex education.
In one of the scenes a man was talking about his date,
and when he used the word "he" in reference to his date,
there was a very loud groan and other disgusted mumblings.

The chill that i felt come over my body and the complete
nausea that took over my whole being was incredible.  

Point of the story?

I dunno... a VERY similar feeling crept across me as i read the messages
on here that seemed (to Me) to be in complete ignorance
of the fact that someone DIED.

but really.. think about that.
death.
no heart beat.
8 minutes.
thats what something like 500-600 heart beats that should have happened
but Didnt...

just try staring at a clock and watch a second hand tick 
and realize everytime it does.. your heart wouldnt

i dunno.. i dont know china at all... we've been online at teh same time
but i dont think i've ever said more than a quick 'Hi'

but that post really meant a lot to me, living in the drug culture
that i happen to live in...
maybe thats why it didnt seem preachy or high horsed to me
maybe its somethign i really needed to hear...

maybe its cuz my brothers fiancee OD'd on coke and had a seisure
and he got to hold her in his arms, covered in her blood,
as she died...

although i can see the relevance of any drug to the discussion
about the rave scene (and related messages that get put
on CD inserts), i think the most important relevance here
is compassion for a hurt raver

something, that _I_ think we would hopefully all have

Ummm. actually, opium is a very potent analgesic which has several adverse
side effects including  respiratory depression (which can kill you!!!),
nausea, dysphoria (a bad feeling), increased biliary pressure (predisposing
to gall bladder disease), physical dependence, allergic reactions such as
skin rashes, bronchoconstriction (not to cool if you haver asthma)!  Read

Yeah, I did come on a bit strong.  I'm just a bit pissed off to hear about
how heroin is making a comeback with supermodels and such.  Heroin has
destroyed too many lives already.  Do we have to recycle the worst parts of
the sixties and seventies?

Since I am quite familiar with the Sound Factory I want to point out a few
things for this weekend.
This Friday they have  DJ/Producer David Morales from New York spinning, that
should be slamming.
Saturday Freak Out sounds like fun, and I think people should also check out
Scott, the late night (1-4AM) DJ in the main room.  He's been working this
new hard house sound and its such a nice change to hear something fresh.  DRC
played on Saturday about a month ago, and you could tell the crowd and her
were both loving it.
The good news is both nights are free from 9:30-10:00.  The bad news is the
door can be a pain in the ass, and the have a dress code no sneakers or caps.

Heroin is a lot more complex than you give it credit for, birdsong.
I managed to chop my previous message, but I really do think that
Village Voice article from about a month ago gets into this in a
compelling way.  Like alcohol, heroin is an escape *and* an amplifier
of pre-existing problems, in addition to its direct psycho/pharmacological
effects.  I say this only on observation, I've never done it myself.

Heroin has a justifiably bad rap, but people keep doing it, and the reasons
are not identical for doing so, the social settings are not identical,
and so on.  

I suspect we all do things from time to time we probably shouldn't.
(Hey, what's that empty Nestle's Crunch package doing on my desk, huh?!)
It strikes me as uncharitable at best to criticize someone else who comes
to terms with this in such a public manner as China did.  What she wrote
taught *me* more about this situation, and about the deeper issues we're
wrestling with in this life . . .

CALIBAN will spin

we'll have a sound system all to ourself and its 
BIG SYNTHESIZER night- forget those tinysynths that are easy to carry-
we are bringing out the BIG ones- the 60+pounders that need special 
WIDE LOAD trucks to carry them down the street. Extra power generators

Captain, mijo, I got a flier at Sunset 2 weeks ago saying that(about
mega...)! I'll try to put it on the list tomorrow, as soon as I sift thru
all the fliers I still haven't organized! But I enjoyed seeing the
all-ages/outdoor subject matter. Wish more of 'em were...
Lotsa love,

hi jaxun,
well, there was some talk of this earlier in the year, so perhaps you can
look at the archived stuff. but i recently talked with some english folx
who where staying  with me. it seems to be some mix of rave culture and
xtianity, kinda like xtian rok was this mix of acid rok and xtianity.
don't know how it will work, will try to keep an open mind, tho'.
in england my frineds were telling me that the xtian element was pretty
strong.
take care/shalom

You can go at any time. A few days ago, a coworker of mine, Josh, had
a head-on crash so violent that his windshield ended up in the back
seat. If it hadn't been for the airbag deflecting it upward, it'd have
gone right through his head. He walked away from that one. I've known
several people that didn't.

Sometimes people need to be reminded that what they are doing
shouldn't be taken for granted. I think China's post should be heeded.

You know, heroin isn't especially dangerous in itself. It takes a long
time to get addicted, and most people who use it don't get addicted at
all. Compare to tobacco, where 9 out of 10 people who ever smoked a
cigarette are still smoking.  Even when addicted, it does not present
health problems; history has many cases where well known and well
respected professionals have been addicted their entire lives without
consequence. Again, compare to tobacco, the #2 killer in the USA next
to heart disease.

The only thing really dangerous about it is that there's no quality
control.  Are you getting a dose, or 200 doses, or 2000 doses? Care to
bet your life on it?

Our government need to recognize that the WOD is a failure, that
people are dying because of the lack of quality control, and that the
best way to prevent death and suffering is to legalize it, regulate
it, and provide support for those who want help.

Anything else is a witchhunt.

Sean

can anyone tell me where i can find a reliable source to buy weekly 
copies of Melody Maker and New Musical Express? I also need the place 
that sells these to get them imported, as opposed to from a domestic 
distributor, so i can get all the free goodies that comes with them every 
so often..:) 
i'm also looking for a reliable source for Select magazine with the 
qualifications just like the ones above...
i so far have had great difficulty finding this stuff...

Mijos, a poem for Xochipilli, the Nahuatl god of the sun and plants, by the
wise people of Oaxaca....

                   (Flowers foster friendship-translation below)

Solo las flores son nuestra riqueza      
Por medio dellas nos hacemos amigos    
y con el canto nuestra pessadumbre se dissipa

Y en el las flores preciosas se ven sus flores en la tierra
Lo sabe el corazon nuestro.
Cantad como lo quiere el corazon de
 aquiel por quien vivimos en la tierra.
_____________________________________________________________

Only flowers are our wealth.
Through them  friendship between us grows
 and through song our sadness vanished.

And by the precious flowers we are permitted to see
 your flowers here on earth.
We know it in our hearts.
May you sing according to His heart's desire,
  by whom we live on earth.

If you made it this far, mijos, know then that the Nahuatl, people of
Oaxaca and its highlands, refer to mushshrooms as "flowers" in their poems,
and used them in both profound ceremonies and in revelry, with dancing,
music and the warmth that comes from being surrounded by smiling, loving
freinds. This was an essential part of meso-american religion and
especially popular culture, as were morning glory seed (conataining
D-Lysergic amides) and several other spiritually powerful herbs. 
 R.G. Wasson, now in his ninetees (I believe) travelled there and took part
in a curandeira's ritual in the 30's! He introduced Timothy Leary to the
'shroom....It was wasson who saved this poem in his book and can be
credited for their (toadstools) access to us (ancient europeans used the
more dangerous Amanita muscaria that grows in colder regions, not too
popular!). He and his wife dedicated their lives to shroom studies and have
several entralling books ("mushrooms, russia and history" and "the magic
mushroom" and "the entheogenic origin of religion" where he links the birth
of religions with ingestion of certain plants and the visions/doors opened
thereafter...)
Maybe we're propagating that ancient vibe? I hope so,but wow, what a
responsibility!
Rave on, 
 Milton and the E-Bee....

Heroin and tobacco both must be taken daily (pack-a-day or more for cigs)
for 1-2 months before physical addiction sets in.  However, once this
happens, even if you quit, _one dose_ will jump-start your addiction
right back up.

The figure for crack is 5 in 10.  All are addictive -- I think the
difference can be explained by relative availability.  I support
legalization, but don't fool myself into thinking _less_ people
would shoot up if it were legal; less people would die, though, which
is the important thing.

More importantly, what is it cut with?  Quinine is common and also
very nasty.

You can't have a war on drugs; you can only have a war on people.

>LUBE was excellent- great location on the water with excellent sound.

I agree 100%.  The sound was *very* good at both the ambient and the dance
floor locations.  Being that both areas are outdoors it made for a very
clean sound and to my surprise almost without sound transfer between each
area.

Miguel played a wonderful set of ambient music for almost the entire
evening.  Great selection and variety!

At the dance floor I managed to dance myself into a sweaty mess although
the night had gotten a little cool. Shoban (I hope I'm spelling this right)
spun an eclectic set to get the dance floor in motion then split her set
with "Ken Machine" LIVE - what a quirky fun group they are, then Shoban
came back spinning for awhile until Alex took over at 12:30.  I may be a
little biased but I think he has incredible control over the emotion and
energy of the music.  Alex is incredible at teasing you for awhile and then
he goes for the kill.  Great set Alex!

No way. No way. We were considering renting out that place in July. Too 
much repair work for us though. It is quite...er...interesting. Does 
everyone get their own room? And how many other warehouses can claim 
having half a dozen bathrooms? If not for the great music, go just to see 
this place. It is quite unique. Just make sure you get a map at the door!

Really?  They must turn away most of the people who come to the door. :-)  
Or do they get a "South Beach" type of crowd?

I've heard this (the "wish you were here" one, there's evidently also a 
"dark side of the moon" one) and it's really not that bad - but not worth 
buying either.  Certainly not the Orb though.

The original "Wish you were here" is much better and just as trancey. :-)

Subject: a late take on the new moon
Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk


well, the moon of course waxes anew..sorry this post is a little out of
date but i goofily missent it last week:


we had it at gregg's house on Albany Hill, overlooking the lovely and
talented I80 highway, vroom vroom.  

we started out, kind of, at sunset, with an absolutely fabulous ambient
plus a little beat set from Ronan, fresh from a month-long stay in LA.
lucky for us, he is back for good.  ronan spins cds & comes equipped with
cd mixer plus lots of incredible music.  (i say "kind of" started jus
'cause we were still setting up.) the altar was assembled with his music
providing the perfect musical backdrop.  thanks go out to the MESS crew
for providing the decks, and Sean Casey for the use of his mixer.

the house is huge & we were able to set up a second sound system (provided
by Harlan and Billie, wizards of sound and light) downstairs in the garage,
which was transformed into the chillest of deep chill spaces, complete 
with wall-to-wall carpets (rescued from several flea markets), black lights,
a wall of paper for painting w/ flurescent paints, a big-screen video
projector, candles and so on.  many people contributed to make this space
work, including maui, sean c, pal greg, the MESS crew, harlan & billie plus
a few early arrivals to the party, including some sfravers.  wow...you
guys are the greatest.  thankyou again and again!

after ronan spun, m noraml went on with ovid, who did a quantum visualization
reading.  right now i'm kicking myself for not asking to tape it, just
because i'd love to hear it again.  i bet there are a lot of people, myself
included, that would like the chance to re-enter the frame of mind their
performance created.  

scottie of MESS took over after m and began the dance phase of the evening.
by then (12:30 or so) people were FLOODING in, provoking a few worries about
whether the house could hold so many people comfortably.  in fact, we had
to shut down the voicemail around 3 jus' cause they kept on coming.  many
people were heading over to the new moon party after going to the sunset
party at the marina & many of these had been playing all weekend.  we met
peole from Oregon, Reno, LA & other distant locations who were in the area
for the long weekend.  

after scottie, tracy ameba went on.  people kept coming up to me saying
"tracy is the shit!!" & yes, i have to agree!  this was only the third
time i'd heard her play & it was fabulous.  i hope i get to hear her
again soon.

downstairs was totally ambient all night, with Billie, Scottie, Bonnie
(recently arrived from Denver, i believe) and Mark Ameba.  this was the
first time mark had spun at this party (& the first time i've heard him
play) & it was right on: trippy, smooth but with just enough of an edge
to keep me going.  the space had a way of sucking people into the chill..
i wish i could show you some of the paintings that people made, including
one side of a conversation someone had on paper 'cause he'd lost his voice!
the MESS crew brought the united states of free love flag which they wanted
to colorize with fluorescent paints.  (we'll bring this out to the sunset
party today for all to see..)

after tracy, whitt of MESS went on to play a very deep house set, which
unfortunately was somewhat interrupted by a visit from two of Albany's
finest.  fortunately, we were on hand immediately to escort these two
gentlemen back out onto to the porch, where we assured them again and
again that there was no alcohol being served inside and that yes, we would
be happy to turn down the music to accomodate a mystery neighbor who
had complained about the noise.  after informing us that they would bust
up the party if called again, they left, but not without writing down
our names and ages.  (huh?)

by then, dawn was nearly upon us.  the house was full, but the majority
of the people there were fast asleep.  then someone volunteered to make
coffee and pancakes for everyone.  since lots of people had a long drive
ahead, breakfast seemed like a good idea.  yum!

all in all, doing this party was psychically refreshing to all concerned..
as usual, it was a collaborative effort among lots of people.  many new
moon regulars plus lots of newcomers came & contributed their efforts &
good attitude.  i hope we will get the chance to have more spoken word
ambient performances like m & ovid have been doing.

thanks so much for making it happen the way it did!  where do you get
all that talent, all that energy?  and where did you learn to dance so
good?  :) :) thank you sean, billie, harlan, gregg & greg, ovid, m,
mark, tracy, whitt, scottie, catherine, paul, seth, jeff, maui, dave
(for the amp & speakers), jacob (on keyboard & for the decks), bonnie,
fox (for you-know-what), devon & everyone else 

lotsa love,

ann

Last time i was there they had the "look at me! I do?" crowd going. I bet 
it's very dependent of the night that you go though.. Great space and sound 
systems, but a fashion show can go along with the ride..

Hello, everybody.

	I was wondering if someone could spare the time to mail me a copy 
of this weeks rave list, if it is around.  (And many thanks to the person 
who puts it together)

	Also I'm interested in what people think of William Orbit's 
Strange Cargo III.  I've found it to be great -- and also very much more 
mature than Cargo I and Cargo II.  Anyone else have an opinion?

Lates, Andrew

Last night's Organic was good. The recording said it was in a "new
building" with plenty of free parking.  But when I got there I recognized
the place from 2 years ago where they held the "Cosmofunkagrooveathon",in
a roller rink, which was busted before I got in.  The parking lot was full
but there was street space (if that's what they meant).  Big ole line
outside and it was coldddddd. Inside was like a zoo.  People sitting here,
standing there, dancing wherever.  Nice cheasy roller disco ceiling lights.

Sound was not so good coming in and out, soft and loud, but this was 
genuine techno with plenty of breakbeat and lots of bounce.  People were 
wiggin' out at the fast bpms and I was thuroughly enjoying it.  I even 
heard a song with that techno-rave chord progression theme to it... what 
happened to those songs?  I guess people got tired of chords?  

Music stopped completely at 3:30am and somebody said something.  What did
he say?  I dunno.  Music came back on in five minutes and people tried to
get back in to it and sudddenly it's trance-time and whooowheee so much
FOG.  This fog was thick but it was more pleasent than somebody's
Marlboro. Trying to dance and not being able to see my hand in front of my
face was really something.  I felt insecure not knowing where I was or
which way I was facing or who was around me... but there was always the 
beat to keep me going.  This feeling was nice but very stressful at the 
same time and I could only handle it for a bit.

Glow sticks, whistles, slinky's, blow pops, a Dr. Seuss Hat, and of all 
things a Fruit Loops Box serving as a backpack.  This was classic rave.

Ok one thing: the speakers were set up RIGHT in front of the bathrooms
which maybe is not a good place because you have your speaker worshippers
and you have your restroom goers all converging to the same personal space
and it was really quite a traffic jam trying to do either act.  What is up
with that?

I really like william orbit a lot...
i have strange cargo 2, and i like 3 better...
I'll buy sc1 as soon as i see it in a cut out bin or something :)

the weird thing for me about his music is that offhand i look at it
as this sort of new agey style music--which is a big turn off
for me...so i have this strange sense that i shouldn't like
his music...but i really really love it...

it's just really nice mellow music that somehow moves something
inside of me when i listen to it :)

go figure :)

Breaks spun in SF? do you know the dj who spun the records?

Also on a related note, does anyone know a record store in the area
that sells breaks, new or used?

Excellent as usual, with great sets from Monty, Simon (who played funkier
than I've heard from him before towards the end of his set) and Galen, who
pulled out some classics. Saw some SFRavers who I hadn't seen for awhile
(Hi Ethan & congratulations on a new baby girl, Bryce, Ronan, Troy, Crunch)
and I have a feeling I could have met some more had I been feeling a bit
more gregarious.

Only downside was the serious chill - FMR tomorrow is going to be definate
heavy clothing time.

Heard Organic was a blast - at least that's what I gathered from the half
dozen people jumping on my bed this morning after they returned. =)

 william orbit is one of my immediate favorite "composers" in that
 while people like R. James, Namlook Etc. play nice stuff their music
 is obviously more "live experimental". I'd say offhand that orbit is
 to techno what alan parsons is to rock. And I'd agree that it has a
 "new agey" feel but that's only because people like T. Dream, Schulze,
 Jarre, Etc. were lumped into a marketing hype category NOT because they
 had anything to do with the NA movement.

 Artists have little control over the "record bins" they find themselves
 sold from - it's just great to be sold ! Another fun pastime is
 to watch the people at Tower in San Mateo try to figure out where to
 file artists. They now have a fairly new "techno" section. Let's see
 AFX is in techno, Willim Orbit III is techno - others are rock. Polygon
 Windows is New Age (at least that's where I finally found it) but SAWII
 is techno. KLF is under rock and so on....

 It's a great sport to watch people struggle with labels  :-)

I just wanted to put in mine about Orbit, one of my favorite artists for 4 or 5
years:

In case you all didn't know, he also did stuff as a band called Bass-O-Matic,
whose first album rocks, but whose second album is now out of print, and was
never released domestically.  The Bass-o-matic singles were really cool too, as
was the "Water from a Vine Leaf" single from Orbit by himself with remixes by
Underworld among others.

Also, a while ago he was in a band called Torch Song, with a woman singing, and
I actually found the out of print tape (which is like 5 or 6 years old) at a
close out sale in Berkeley (can't remember the name of the store).  IT was kind
of cheesy (the lyrics), and the music was only pretty good, definitely not up
to his standards nowadays.

His remix of Madonna's song was really cool, and I have yet to hear his other
remixes including Prince and Siouxsie.  Any stuff that anyone else know about
him?

Oh!  I finally saw the video to Water From a Vine Leaf, and thought it was
totally cool.

PS - Sunset was great.  I can never get enough of Papua New Guinea

Only my second Sunset yesterday -- thanks to all of you who made it a 
wonderful experience.  Only 2 regrets:  I had to leave really early and I 
got a $27 parking ticket courtesy of the Berkeley cops.  Apparently, you 
can't park on the right-hand side of the road that leads to the end of 
the marina.  I guess it's posted, but I didn't notice the signs.  Anyway, 
every single car there was ticketed, so be warned!

Well I had a great weekend even though Organic started by not treating
people quite right.They didn't open up until after midnight so there
was a long cold period of waiting in line with lots of people trying
to crash the front of the line.  But they let everyone in for the $10
price so... The place was really fun, although something more than the
cheesy 70's roller rink lights would've been nice... well there were
those big strobes, but ... The sound was bad at first.. the amp to their
tweeters kept overheating so the music kept losing intensity and then
come back the go away... eh... When they shut off the sound completely
after a few hours of this, they said that they needed to rewire the amp.
15 or so minutes later it came back on and was nice from there on out.
I really like the trancey stuff after that but then the music became very
basic house like and lost my interest as it slowed down a lot.  Too
slow, in my opinion and so many people then were just laying down and
cuddling :) or resting... sort'f low energy.   But, one really cool thing
was that they were playing videos from Futur on the back wall.  They showed
the laser dancers and had a few shots of the lasers streaming from the
stage and though by no means did this do Futur justice, my friends and
several others and I just sat and watched and grinned and talked about
how much Futur was the shit.  That was good.  They also had some of the
videos of the face that they played on the triangle screen at Futur.
So... everybody was really happy and overall good vibes from the whole
crowd.  Ended up being really fun by early dawn.  Sleep Sleep Sleep...
and head to Sunset.  Sunset is just happiness.  The energy at unset made
up for the mellower energy at Organic.  Danced pretty hard for most of the eveni
ng.
Simon (I think) did a great set.  Lots of Hardfloor, and acid trance goodness
that had my grin from ear to ear.
Had an older couple walking by stop and ask me if this sort of thing
happened a lot... I said yes.. here every Sunday this summer.  They said
that it was great.  *grin*

Weekend Rave report
-------------------

Greetings!!   I finally get to a "Massive" this weekend since all the
traveling around I've been doing.    So I decided to check out Organic,
and see for myself this new space that was hyped over the info line.

The info said it was a half hour from the Bay Bridge,   but unless you
were in a helocopter,  or driving a fast car,    I hardly think anyone
could make it in the indicated time.    Not one mention was given about
what city it was in,   unless the other info lines included that info.
The direction to take on 4 was vague,  but luckily I took the right
direction.    After driving for more than an hour,    I stopped for
directions,   met a few other lost ravers but eventually found it.

The venue was a roller rink,    low cielings,    little or no ventilation,
dispite the smoking ban which nobody paid attention to anyway.    No real
chill zone,  but people just flopped down anywhere there was room.

Chlling out was a real problem,  as I often stayed next to the entrance
blocking things,  until I ran into Jerry,   the promoter.    He finally
realized that allowing me to stand outside,   was better for all concerned.

The music was really pumpin,   mostly housey stuff,  no fast beats,  but
consistant.    About 3:30 just before Simon was to go on,  the music stopped
so they could change a mixer,    but soon started up again.

It was crowded all night,  with perhaps about 75% still there at about
7:30 pm.

Although the party got started late (probably to give more setup time
after the rink closed),   people were still getting in for $10.    For
the price,  it was worth it.    

Almost immediatly,  peopole were asking me where I've been for the last
month and a half,   but it was great to touch base with some old friends.

There were a few SFRavers there,   but due to the "Out of the way" location,
there wasn't as many as there could have been.

The music finally stopped at about 8 am,   where Mark Ferina played some
slow stuff to finally close things off.

After the rave,  I left and headed back to Mill Valley for a much needed
shower,   but on the way home,   decided to visit the jacuzzi at one of
the 24 hour Nautilus health clubs instead.    Hmmm!  Gonna have to do
this more often  :-)

After a much relaxing plunge into the warm water,   I headed home,  tried
to chill,   but couldn't sleep, so headed out to Sunset.

As I arrived,  they were just setting up,   so I chilled around,  did some
meditation,   until the music started.

As usual,  Sunset started off with the slow beats,   but picked up soon
after that until the generator finallly conked out.   Thanx to an individual
who happened to have a spare,   we were off and running again and the 
momentum and vibe finally picked up.

Soon,  several hundred people were milling around,  dancing,  or just
schmoozing around.    

Dispite the much cooler weather,   lots of people showed up,  but not as many
as last week,   and the music played on until shortly after 10 pm.   
Probably in part due to some street gig in San Jose.

So,  once again,  Sunset lived up to it's expectation as one of the best
daytime gigs,    and I highly recommend those to come down and check it
out next Sunday.

Thanks to the sunset gang for yet another wonderful party!! I have been 
happy to make Sunset a weekly ritual.  Too bad the fog didn't allow us to 
climb  to the top of the hill and watch the sun disappear.  I LOVE that 
change of energy as people run down to dance just afte. Galen 
continues to blow me away everytime - set me deep in a trance. Cathy and 
I always meet more incredible people there each sunday, (Hi to the Mother 
Earth crew).  Is Sunset moving soon?  Milton thought he heard that it 
was, but I hoped somone from Sunset might confirm this.    

Bye for now, Peace and Love,
Andrew

Millenium was a big movie scene extravaganza in Los Angelos 
this weekend.  Calling it a Party would be too generous.

Driving up freeway 110 straight into Downtown was spectacular.
Giant concrete freeway cathedrals.  Off the freeway we immediately
started to see police blockades and rows of trucks on the side
blocks.  

We whizzed by Flower St in Awe.  All we glimpsed were giant
screens, blazing lights, throngs of people, and a whirlwind
of confetti filling the sky.

Following directions for the free parking shuttled us past
a fancy hotel that opened up right into the party.  This
little drive-by was around midnight.  It was a mob scene.

We parked out on the street and circled the 5x3 city block 
Hollywood encampment.  There was an extremely high stress
level outside.  Scalpers were aggressive and pissed-off
groups of people (didn't get in?) were milling about bitching 
and whining.  Entering at the far end we were greeted with
a 100+ porta potties, the free food and drink area, the free 
water area, and then the main street corner.

There were speakers everywhere, brilliant film lights, huge fans blowing
confetti into the air, two Football Stadium sized tv screens, a stage,
balloons, and searchlights all surrounded by skyscrapers with a nearly
full moon thrown in on top.  The main set decorations were Tanks and 
Army Guys standing around in the middle of the party.

25,000 people and maybe a 100 trying to dance.  These are difficult
odds.  DeeLite was either plagued with technical problems or the filming
demanded that they play a song and then stop for 5 minutes.  Their whole
set was disjoint and broken up like that.  There were constant pauses in
the music.  Interruptions by the movie people were way more annoying 
than I thought - "Ok people, let's do a countdown!"   Note that these
countdowns were really weak, it'll be interesting to see the post-production
results.

Before and after DeeLite were long silent breaks or timid dj'd interludes.
Random horribly distorted instructions to sound or lighting people were just
blasted out over the djs.  It was an Allstar Dj Lineup.  They each put
in a lackluster, broken up, 1/2 hour set.  No one was into anything except
standing around and gawking at themselves on the tv screen or people
watching.  It was a very mixed crowd.  Most similar in feel to the
State Fair or maybe an Amusement Park - without the happy kids!  Some
people were very beautiful.  A decent contingent of decorative model types
and club kids (USA twins were a personal favorite).  Others were 
desparately draining their "love phasors" into the fray.  The Alamo.

Aphex Twin came on after lengthy pleas for waving our hands in the air.
He at least managed to get the movie people to shut up during his set.
It wasn't that long but it was good.  I moved way back away from the
stage near a big screen and a tank.  This spot had a nice breeze, some
room and the best sound in the party (lots of places got muffled by
people or objects).  His set ended and then Doc Martin started to DJ.
I know this because someone kept saying it OVER and OVER and OVER in
an attempt to "Come on LA let's show some Respect."  I don't know if
these extended motivational shout-outs are normal for LA or exclusive
to this hopeless affair. 

Then the Clincher.  It just fucking ended at around 3:30.  The tickets
said "9:00 to Dawn".  Displaced party goers who were not ready to 
leave wound up sitting in big groups in the street throwing confetti
all over themselves.  These were the friendliest moments of the party.
Unfortunately, there was a HEAVY POLICE PRESENCE.  They were mostly
cool but there were So Many standing around watching.  They seemed
to become more noticeable after the music stopped and people were still
trying to lounge about.  Chalk that one up to my fear of cops.  I just
wasn't comfortable.  It was Over.  We left.

We raced back to SF (actually it was nice to get away, the trip was 
pleasant) and made it home for Sunset.  I was SO HAPPY to come home
and dance.  I had all this unused energy.  We didn't arrive til after 
dark.  When we first saw about 20 people grooving on the hill, my
friend commented "I already see more dancing than last night"
The last dj played a very good set.

I kept hoping for some small contingent of the Millenium people to 
get together. I know they were there - it was just hard for things
to gel under the circumstances.

I was far away from the stage.  My friends went up into the
crowded hell in front of the stage and claimed that he was 
there twiddling nobs behind a big rack of equipment.  I think
he played live.

I as at Millenium too and I thought I would add to David's comments since
he and I had different times, so it seems. :)

There were only 10,000 or so people there and I don't know where you were
for most of the evening, David, but the area in which we spent most of our
time (to the left of the stage and down some) was filled with loads of
happy dancing people - just ask Lee and Rox. :)

I don't think Deee-lite was being interrupted by the filming. Their set 
as disjoint but I think that was intentional. The sound was lousy for them
from where I was standing but wasn't that bad at other points in the evening.

Jason Bentley's set was lacklustre and broken up. Doc Martin's set was 
refreshingly different for Doc and quite nice. Aphex's set was incredibly
wonderful, sick acid house that really surprised me, coming from him. Sadly,
he only played for about 30 minutes.

The LA Times said it was shut down due to five Ecstacy overdoses though
what I heard on the night was that the fire marshall shut it down due to
excessive noise complaints. I don't believe the promoters had the intention
of shutting it down early. In fact, I spoke with Philip Blaine, the promoter,
last week and he had mentioned that the film commission was concerned that
they wouldn't be able to keep people there long enough to do all their
filming, like keeping people there well into dawn.

Dave, I'm sorry you couldn't meet up with the socal ravers because we were
there going strong!

  It's been a while since I've posted anything, been too busy with school 
and adjusting to city life, but here's a little weekend report :)

  Drove down to Monterey with my two friends and got there around 11pm.  
We drove around a bunch of artichoke fields looking for the site.  After 
an hour of this we called the voice mail and discovered I wrote down the 
wrong directions..  We finally get to the spot and Scott (drenalin) and 
crew were still setting up.  I was really impressed with the site my 
friends found, it's in a little valley and has an incredible view of the 
Moss Landing power plant. (who needs a generator??)  After some sound 
problems, we got the music going around 1am and about 80 people showed up 
from Santa Cruz and Monterey (and some friends from San Jo!) 
  Shilo spun some really nice groovy acid/trance for about an hour and 
then Scott came up to me and said it was my turn to spin.  Well, I wasn't 
exactly ready ;)  and then after the first few mixes I realized the 
monitors were WAY too far away, making beat matching a bitch!  Once the 
monitors were fixed I decided to just thrash as many people as I could, 
so I brought it up to 145 and kept it there for an hour ;)  Scott went on 
after me, it was his first time spinning at one of HIS parties!  

  We finally shut down around 7:30 and had a wonderful breakfast in 
Monterey, got some sleep, then drove to Big Sur!

  We had reserved two group camp sites at Big Sur  Pfiefer State Park.. 
The redwoods were amazing, you could easily have 500+ people here for a 
full moon or anything else you wanted to throw..  But we kept it small 
with only about 30 or 40 close friends showing up.  We also kept it 
ambient.. We had 3 T-tables, echo/reverb fx and a sampler and some realy 
bizzare feedback effects which sounded just like a 303.  Tim McKnew and 
myself played strange stuff for about 2 or 3 hours until most people had 
decided to get some sleep.  I haven't heard it yet, but we got most of 
the night on tape..  We have a growing archive of Cloud Factory sets and 
we may someday get them produced and available to the general public of 
ravers out there ;)

Peace out...

-Ernie 'Deaks'

after weeks of email saying that there was no way
that aphex was going to show up,
resonate said:

Okay- now for the real question- was it REALLY aphex twin playing?
was Richard James actually *THERE?* Did he play live or just spin music?

Well i have to admit it.  Resonate was right. Aphex was nowhere to be
seen in LA last saturday night.

They DID get this guy who looked a HELL of a lot like him,
(friends who were down in the lobby of the Bonaventure,
at around 4:30 saw him wandering around)
to go up on stage and play records and twiddle knobs 
with this incredible Acid House set that included songs like
Phuture (?) and Eon's The Spice, and made me damn well giddy.
(While This Is Acid was playing, i was forced to say
"Yes, This IS Acid." cuz it damn well was.)

At the end, there was there wonderful beautiful mindfucking
noise eminating from the speakers (causing a friend to say
"Do you remember that ripping sound in the middle of that?
Man... someone just shouldnt be able to do that to me"), 
and that sounded a hell of a lot like Aphex, but that was 
probably just a coincedence.

I'm still waiting for someone who has *seen* him play before to tell me
it was him. 

He doesn't have his equipment in racks, so whoever saw someone playing stuff
"behind racks of equipment" adds fuel to his quote "I won't be touring
for a long long time." 

I'm glad to hear that Millenium was exactly what I thought it would be-
a hollywood scam.

Tamara says,

>(to the left of the stage and down some) was filled with loads of
>happy dancing people - just ask Lee and Rox. :)

I know there were people into the party.  From my point of view,
they were really spread out among tons of people who were not so
enthusiastic. Bored, frowning, tired spectators were everywhere.

I expected a mix of people from a huge party promoted in lots of 
places.  However, I was planning to stay until "dawn" and hoped the 
party would pull together and go off when the crowd thinned out.	
In fact, this is exactly what I heard from folks arriving at the
same time I did.  People definitely believed it was going to
be "djs all night long - after the bands".

With the incredible amount of money and effort going into that
party and all the police and emergency crews who were there, I 
don't think noise complaints shut it down.  Seems like they
would have had the permits to do it right.

I believe the overdose shutdown story.  I'm also inclined to believe that
that they got what film they needed and didn't argue too much after that.
So they got 5 overdoses - they would expect more after 3:30 ... ??	
Or shutting down would somehow help this?
I don't get it.

I don't mean to completely slam the event  
It was fun for what it was

 five -not one, but five- ecstacy overdoses? Sounds like typical suburban
fear made it to the papers again "oh, those ravers and their drugs! See
what happens, junior, they took that e-thing and everyone died and now
no-one has any  more fun!"

Ok, why can't i get this? If you sell $10 tickets to 10 thou or more
people, and this is your movie, why can't you work around the noise
complaints? Sheesh, talk about lousy planning!
well, at least they had enough cops around to handle the crowd, should any
unrest come up when it shut down early, hey, good planning!

Promoters and accountability should go together....

Yin and Yang, Up and Down, Back and Forth  - but overall a fun party.  The
later early morning tracks were great, I just wish the DJ had switched to
that earlier.  I think the low energy level in the earlier morning was due to
too much unfunky hard house. Faster, acidic stuff would have been better or
slower, funky workouts.  Tony spun a really nice set earlier in the evening.
 I always forget how much I like him but I've been hearing him spin more
often in the past couple months and really enjoying it. SUNSET SUNSET SUNSET
SUNSET!!!! This party is *SO* GOOD!  Galen's set just made my weekend.  Why
doesn't he play any of the 'bigger' parties?

Here's my take on Millineum.

Drove up on Friday night and stayed with my brother in Agoura Hills.
It was to be his first rave. We went to Venice Beach Saturday after
scoping out the location and seeing the Jumbotron screens alongside
5th Street.

We got to the parking area around 8:50 and started walking towards
the site. We ended up on the upper-level roads and took an elevator
down to the street level. This was right across from the big hotel
where they were dumping confetti. When we got to street level, the
security crew told us to go towards the entrance to get in. When
we got to the area of the porta-potties, we noticed that they were
patting down the incoming people. We asked someone if they were
tearing tickets or stamping hands. She said no, and we turned around
to go to the action.

At that time of the evening, the filming was doing rehearsal and
security was trying to keep all of the ravers in one spot. I thought
that the party was going to start at 9, but in actuality, it started
around 10:30. The countdown scenes were weak. The guy hanging off
of the top of the hotel was interesting. The confetti was neat. Too
bad the music sucked. Well, the presentation of the music sucked
anyway. I explained to my brother that this wasn't a rave, but it
was a "rave-like" event. The music was disjoint and had very annoying
silent spaces. Most of the people were milling around and not dancing.
 Dee-lite had a very muddled sound and it seemed like they couldn't
hold a groove. Dancing was at times difficult because of the crowd.
(I was in my colorful spiral tye-die and a bike cap). I continually wandered
throughout the crowd, stopping in the slightly open areas and dancing.
Sometimes the crowd around me would join in. The mad-hatters were dancing
pretty well and at times, the area in front of the Jumbotron was dancing.

There was no velcro wall or acro-bungie or human gyroscope and no
Ambient Garden. 

The props were interesting. My brother asked the guys in the tanks
if they were props or what. They said yes. I also found it interesting
that the cop cars were getting vandalized. These too were props.
The area next to coffee shop seemed to have the most consistent dance
area.

I was quite disappointed when the music stopped. I thought that it
was going to continue 'till dawn. When the filiming stopped, though,
so did the music. Bummer. The only piece about the party on the news
the next evening was that it was closed down because of Ecstasy
overdoses. They showed a little bit of dancing and then had some
doctor spreading his ideas of the evils of ecstasy. That was it.

It was definitely an interesting experience. My brother got hyped
about raves and may start looking into the LA scene.

-Mike

Went to Pure Space to catch Alfie who's back spinning in the city again.
 He's really honed his skills and spun a great opening set that just built up
the energy from some great slow funky jazzy stuff into faster more tribal.
 Its really cool to see DJs re-invent themselves from time to time.  Then
some tall guy with long dreads played an OK set :-) I danced like crazy on
just a fat J.  For some reason I enjoyed Mark Farina's set at Pure Space a
lot more than his set at Organic though they were similar.  After hearing
Mark spin some fun slow stuff at Organic at the very end of his set (and the
party itself,)  I'd like to hear a whole set like that from him some day...
 Does anyone know if those Hyperdelic Videos they have at Pure Space (and
elswhere) are available like in a store? I think I need one  at home.

I had a great time at Millenium.  The first DJ I heard (about 10 PM
I guess) was spinning honest to god trance and acid trance.  My cups 
of tea.  Not many people were dancing except right up by the speakers, 
so I gladly jumped in with about 75 young LA guys waving and bouncing
to the 140 bpm+ beats.  That didn't last too long, the next DJ came
on and things got much slower and with more organs and horns, so I
wandered around to just soak things up.

There were all kinds of people there:  movie people, LAPD (and they
all seemed to be in friendly moods, I didn't get a bad feeling from
them at all), people who looked like they just sort of wandered in,
club kids in full regalia, and ravers of many ages and fashion senses.
People were friendly to me -- no pushing or shoving, people smiled and
said excuse me if they had to get by, complete strangers gave me 
blow pops and when Susie said to a random person "hey, where did you
get that hat?" he just gave it to her.  

Some of the music really annoyed me, but I liked the first few bits of
Doc Martin's set (it had 303's wailing away in it) and of course I
liked the stuff that the Aphex Twin was spinning.  

Whoever did the sound for Dee-Lite should be barred from doing sound
ever again.  The sound during their live performance was unbearble.  
Things were much better for the DJ's spinning vinyl.

Off to the left of the stage was a sort of valley studded with Palm
Trees.  It was MUCH darker there than anywhere else, and there were 
hundreds of people dancing like crazy and smiling and bopping around.
I ran into several people I knew, which was nice -- It was very
cool bumping into Rox and spending a good amount of time talking to
her.

The movie's set (New Year's Even 1999 amid tanks in Desert camoflage)
wasn't condusive to a good rave per se, but hey, I knew what I was
getting into when I heard it was a James Cameron film.  Like, what 
do you expect from the guy who brought us _Terminator_?  Basically
the bulk of the screaming production assistants was in the highly
lit area at the corner of 4th and Flower, at the opposite end of 
the square from the stage.  "Oh my god I'm not getting enough
confetti over here?  What should I do?"

So anyway, I thought it was fun and I'm glad I went.  Everyone's 
perceptions are different, and I just wanted you all to know that I
didn't think it was one bit as bad as Dave Alves described it.  But
then, I'm an East Coast Hardcore Girl (TM) :-) so maybe I'm used
to a more apocalyptic take on raving.  As I said on alt.rave, the
only bad thing in my opinion was that the Fire Marshal (I'm told)
stopped the party at 3:30 am because some idiots were doing back
flips off some equipment AFTER the promoter had gotten on the PA and
said that if people didn't stop doing dangerous stuff like that the
Fire Marshal would shut the party down.  Some people are just so
clueless and/or selfish.

I'm not a cheeseball (I'm a vegan and am what I eat). Maybe a wheat
gluten puff.
 
However I'm simply not a peace and love raver.
 
I remember 11 years ago when all the rage was to make movies about punk
rock and many "filmed" punk concerts happened and it was the SAME thing
that happened in LA at Millenium:
bad music, bad vibes, bad drugs, bad people, and bad press.
 
No solid scene needs *any* hype from the multi-death-corporate Hollywood
film industry. The media is a parasite on significant pop and underground
culture- it feeds itself and kills the host.
 
Fortunately- the one thing that dance music has going for it is that often
our favorite stuff has no vocals- and this will keep it out of the top 40
for a long time- or at least until MCA convinces everyone to buy it.

Resonate bitterly declares:

>a hollywood scam.

Oh lighten up.  It was fun and it only cost $10, which is a great
price for a rave these days.  Funky environment (it was weird
and it weirded some people out but I liked it), a variety of music,
free food and drinks, plenty of clean air.

Understood, nor am I.  But it seemed like you were just wishing 
vindicative ill will at people.  You don't have to be peace-love anything 
to see how wrong that is.

I agree with you completely on most of this, Steve, but you missed the 
point and subtly contradicted yourself: revelling in someone getting 
screwed is a bit like Sony having a party if MCA were to bite the 
dust.

HARMONY! @ Santa Cruz


    ___ We'd love to see you all at  Harmony  this Friday the 23rd! ___    ;) 

It's going to go off at a beautiful, new outdoor location north of Santa Cruz that
has never been used!  This is the special Santa Cruz location that we wanted to use
for the Harmony this last August 26th, but ended up locating at a beautiful spot in
the city.  (It was a peninsula on the water overlooking the San Francisco bay, the
city lights practically in our reach just beyond the bay on the other side.)  

Our August Harmony turned out to be very successful, and quite a big turnout
considering our relatively careful and conservative flyering and promoting.  This
time we've printed only a couple hundred flyers, and we are relying more on our
friends in the underground to support the scene and to spread the good word!

                  This is Greg's Birthday Party!  (Yay!!)
       A great big Happy Birthday to Greg (of Harmony Productions) 
              and to everyone else in the world on this day! 

Friday, September 23rd - Harmony
        DJ Deaks    Taylor    Tim    Tim McKnew    Donut
        A godly outdoor location about 15 minutes North of Santa Cruz.
        408.486.9591  408.488.9954

We are doing everything we can to make this party free.  IF we end up charging, it
will be very cheap (less than $5), and only to break even.  

        We have _ZERO_ interest in making any money!

        -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=--=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=--=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
There is plenty of room for tents, and be sure to bring lots of warm clothes,
blankets, stuffed animals, candy, toys, water, love, and everything else that is
good to share with others.
        -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=--=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=--=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Keep the Joy...
Keep the Love...
Keep the Faith...
Keep the Family...
Keep an Open Conciousness, and Dance Your Ass Off!

Most of all, Respect Your Mother Earth!  (We actually mean it though!)

Love and Hugs,
Harmony
Support the Underground!

RE> Cloud Factory/Big Sur :)

Cloud Factory definately was a good time.  DJ Deaks, Shiloh, and all the other DJ's
did a wonderful job, and I left the next morning feeling like I had a very good
night.  

Unfortunately, Greg and I weren't able to make it out to breakfast with Deaks,
mostly because we were passed out.  

Sorry Ernie!  We want to do it sometime soon though!  Maybe this Saturday morning
after  Harmony  this Friday the 23rd in Santa Cruz?

Shiloh somehow piled us in Greg's car and started driving us home.  To me this seems
like an impossible feat, seeing as how I was somehow sleeping outside for what
seemed to be a few hours... sitting up.

I also feel bad that I missed Big Sur...  I REALLY wanted to go, but my physical
state prevented me, somehow.  Usually that's not supposed to be a problem!  ;)

Love and Harmony,
Todd

	I hate to harp on this subject, well, maybe I don't hate harping 
on it, but I do not like always coming back to it. I would like to hear 
what they called this E overdoses, were they actually people passing out 
and needing a shot of Narcaine <spelling is worng, but the name of the 
anti-narotic is pretty close> to keep them from dying? Was this actually 
e, or was it cut with something?
	You see, I am quite sick of hearing that every rave or rave like 
gathering is a horrible drug infested event, just look at all these 
overdoses! I further find it unresponsible for the media to spread half 
truths about a subject very few people have any direct experience with, 
any viewpoint from to make a judgement for themselves (although one can 
argue that such a thing does not exist, I still would like to give people 
a less ditorted view, but then is my view less distorted?). 
	The way things tend to be played up, the word overdose can be 
misleading. A medical overdose on e consists of jaw-crenching and 
eye-twitching at the one to two hour mark, so 5 overdoses can be 
expected. But this is not the image that is conjured in the minds of 
people who can write letters to their mayor when a bunch of these people 
bring their loud music in their neighborhood and try to tempt their 
children into possibly overdosing themselves. Furthermore, who would 
want to have to think about people overdosing, such a scary thing... I do 
think people have been led to read a lot more into these what can be 
'accurately' reported (one might question which should allowed to be 
labeled as accurate though, the actual reporting, or the imagery which 
the media wishes to conjure in its readers eyes).
	I have trouble deciding whether to mad at people for taking the 
media's reporting at face value. I think a sense of fear of the unknown, 
a kinda of hopeless, lost-ness can deter a lot of people from looking at 
some situations for themselves when someone else expresses disgust or 
outrage toward an activity. Granted I have read a lot of Kesey, but I 
like to credit myself with seeing this before I read Sometimes a Great 
Notion... But this is degenerating into babble to keep me from writing an 
essay I have to write, I how there is something of intelligence in here...

Galen at bigger parties?

I know very little of Galen's history, but I would imagine that if he doesn't spin
at bigger parties, there is a reason.  If I were Galen, my theory would be that if I
were really supporting the underground, I would not be supporting the "bigger
parties" because that would be contradictory to my purpose.  Bigger, more
commercialized parties are exactly what put a bad name to all the tried and true,
sincere underground parties.  The very parties that try NOT to make money.

Until recently, Sunset WAS pretty much an underground thing.  Now that everyone and
their cousin knows about Sunset (from pretty much all around the bay area), it's
just not the same anymore.  It's still WONDERFUL, yet just not the same as the days
when there were 20-30 people out there dancing; instead, 200-300+ people show up
now.  

Don't get me wrong, the energy is still and always will remain with me as TRULY
AMAZING at Sunset parties, but the fact of the matter is, just too many people have
begun to find out about it.  No wonder Sunset will probaly live on at the Berkeley
Marina for only a few more weeks.  

Sunset was undoubtedly a scene that will remain in my memory forever, it was fun
while it lasted, and there is always another time and place for everything.

I luv Sunset!!
Love and Harmony,
Todd

Yin and Yang, Up and Down, Back and Forth  - but overall a fun party.  The
later early morning tracks were great, I just wish the DJ had switched to
that earlier.  I think the low energy level in the earlier morning was due to
too much unfunky hard house. Faster, acidic stuff would have been better or
slower, funky workouts.  Tony spun a really nice set earlier in the evening.
 I always forget how much I like him but I've been hearing him spin more
often in the past couple months and really enjoying it. SUNSET SUNSET SUNSET
SUNSET!!!! This party is *SO* GOOD!  Galen's set just made my weekend.  Why
doesn't he play any of the 'bigger' parties?

My guess is that galen would like to play parties any size , especially 
if he doesn't have to use his system and was getting paid. And of course 
who would miss an oportunity to play out of the bay area if offered?

I post this only so that promoters might realize how important Galen has 
become to all of us. Though he may not solicit himself , I'm sure he is 
ready for action!

Interestingly enough, no.  Another record you should check out is an 
ATOI-affiliated project here in Seattle.  The 12" is called Integratron, 
and will be released in October on Visible Records.  It features a mix by 
ATOI Seattle (myself, assisted by local DJs Michael Manahan and Dervish) 
and a remix by Martin Bond and Seofon.

Peace,
Matt

I never really understood why security guards bust anyone anyway.  Assumedly
they are hired by the promoter to prevent fights and such and the promoter
can tell them to do whatever he/she wants them to do.  Or do these
rent-a-cops actually think they are a distant part of the police department?
Anyway, open drug use is different than open drug dealing.  To quote Snoop on
MTV's Straight Dope, if you're gonna do it, do it in a business-like manner.
 Parties are a comfortable, friendly enviroment and its easy to forget that
you may be breaking laws that some folks take VERY seriously and that there
is massive pressure from a brainwashed public to enforce.  I do beleive that
communally breaking unjust laws is important though :-)  Martin Luther King
said that morally, you HAVE to break unjust laws.

That is more what I meant than why doesn't Galen play at giant, lame
commercial parties.  I'd like to hear Galen on a fuckin' massive sound system
and a flat dance floor :-)  It could still be relatively underground and all.
 And he could get paid which is always nice even if you just buy more
records.  And big party/micro party, free/$15, outside/indoors, fast
beats/slow jams it don't mean a thing if it ain't got VIBE!

This really seems like nit-picking to me.

I think the fact that the party has changed makes it
a better party.  The Freedom of the people to make the
party and the Thrill of watching it change is what it
is All about.

It wouldn't *be* Sunset without the first small 
parties And these later big parties.  Sunset is. 
Let it grow.  Enjoy it. 

It has not gotten to a size where the People have lost
their creative ability to Contribute.  It is a laboratory
and a studio and a kitchen.  It is a place where everyone 
can do their part to Make It Beautiful.

Even with 300 people you can still Feel what you put in
come right Back to Ya.  That is underground.  Not numbers.

And, of course, it doesn't hurt to have Galen transport
the whole damn meadow onto another planet like this Sunday ...

Love ya,
Dave

Mijos, why all this about talk about party size? like a penis, it ain't the
meat, it's the beat!
I've only felt more joy as more happy, surprised faces show up to their
first sunset, and as more converts to our scene are made. It has been a
massive, positive party, and I think the Berkeley "community" smiles upon
it, they only see happy, playful, respectful and accepting people dancing
and lounging. 

Let it Bee! This is our calling card, our foot in the door, and slowly
people are losing their fear of ravers. There is no reason to reduce or
relocate.Galen, say it ain't so! Keep it there a little mo'....

Lotsa love, 
 Milton and the E-Bee....

I am a press person.  I met with Richard James in the U.K. last year and I
saw him again this weekend at (funny enough) Millenium where we talked and
then he went on stage.

you guys seem like you want to destroy your scene.  why spread all these bad
rummors when you don't know what you are talking about?

it was an amazing event with tons of pluses, an event of that size can't
please everyone, but the vote is in in los angeles and the verdict is
millenium rocked!

"peace to all of the positive beings and more peace to those of you who need
it"

I had a very good weekend all in all.

Went to Crash Worship on Friday at the Berkeley Square and was sorely
disappointed.  Instead of feeling the overwhelming since of excitement and
tribal bonding overdubbed with industrial sound, I got pushed around in an
unemotional pit and got covered with water, oil and a 1/2 lbs of sugar.  It
went from fun to interesting to pure torture in a little under 15 minutes.
Now, to be honest, this was my first Crash Worship experience and my friends
all said it was probably the worst performance they ever did.  They blamed it
on the venue and the perponderence of inhibited UC students.  Sigh.

I guess I can't expect it to be Burning Man can I?

I did the Organic thing like a lot of sfravers did.  I too experienced that
sense of "wait, I must have missed the exit" when the 30 minutes from the
bridge elapsed.  I'm stubburn though, so I kept going.  Not so my friend who
gave up when he reached the 680 junction.  The 5:30 - 6am set was my fav, but
I was too tired to dance.  Chocolate covered expresso beans can only carry me
so far in the night.

While waiting in the Organic line for an hour, I got to witness a teenager on
4 hits of acid.  According to his friends, it was his first time.  Some
friends, I thought, who let him down 4 hits.  Anyway, this poor guy reached a
state in his trip where reality ceased to exist, and he fell flat on his face.
The Pain brought him back long enough so he could stand up again.  You could
see the smile on his face when he realized he was still in the parking lot,
still on planet earth.  Then you could see reality slipping away one more time
and he fell again, only this time straight back into the concrete.  His head
hit the ground with a very loud melon thud.  I'm sure he got a concussion from
it.  Finally, his friends who were probably just as high picked him up and
took him back to the car.  I shudder to think what the rest of his night was
like.

The moral:  If your going to take acid for the first time, stick to a hit or
maybed two.  For gods sake, don't take 4 hits at a rave in pittsberg.  It's
stupid and sad.  Quite honestly, I think more than one hit at a rave is a bit
overkill.  Save the heavier doses for a place with lots of comfy pillows,
toys, and good music.

At Organic, I met Milton sans the E-bee.  He had Rogaine the Frog with him
instead.  Milton has the right idea.  Too many people are afraid to play in
public anymore.  It nice to see other people who aren't afraid to look silly
in order to have some fun.

Sunday I went to the incredible sunset rave with my purple beanbag.  I got
there early enough to hear the blue haired dj (what's his name?) spin some
really sweet ambient (dub?) tracks.  The sun was still warm then folks, and
the kites were beautiful.  It was well worth the effort of waking up so early
in the morning (noon) to get there.

I got to meet, briefly, phuture.  Its nice to tie a name to a face.

Another happy note, I got a very nice CD, "One A.D."  Very yummy ambient.
I like it as much as the United States of Ambient cd.

Finally, one of my friends is doing a showing of her photos taken at Burning
Man.  She took a lot of "risky" shots with color and IR film, and many of them
turned out great.  The show opens on Thrusday, let me know if you want more
details.

Ciao,

Purple Tiger

>I post this only so that promoters might realize how

i second the motion...galen has shown all us what he can do.  
anything from chillin' out to  can't stop from dancing-hard!  
galen's variety of music and ability to spin many changing 
moods (terrible word, but its 7 am & my brain is still asleeep) 
has been proved  through sunset.  i've heard it; we've all 
heard it.

as i see it maybe no one would give him a chance to spin, so he 
may have said fuck it, i'll set up my own system and spin.  now 
there's a can-do attitude!  more power to him.

keep it going, galen; we support you!

peace&positivity,

I think i could just be overreacting, cuz im really sick of
people in SF saying shit about LA when they are never even here.
("people in SF" obviously equals SOME people in SF, not all of them)

i dunno, its just that the amount of ego masturbation 
going on from someone not even at the party is just ridiculous

>I'm still waiting for someone who has *seen* him play before to tell me
>it was him. 

Look, it wasn't him. It was some Richard Barnes guy. The LA Times said so.

I have seen Aphex at an event he was supposed to play live at.
I was in the room while he rehearsed and i just saw a mess of
equipment with this figure moving around in the middle of it.

I also passed him on the way to dinner.

If you were there and heard the incredible "mind-crunching"(tm)
shit he was playing, there would be no question.

>I'm glad to hear that Millenium was exactly what I thought it would be-
>a hollywood scam.

And i'm sad you give more of a damn about making sure you can gloat
than having 10,000 people have a good time.

Although it's kinda funny, but from the standpoint of most everyone
i went with, i dont think the term "hollywood scam" would be
what pops into their mind

(and since most of the people i went with are the 
'elitist punk rock' types who are the first to dump
any band that looks at a major label, i think they
would just as quickly dump a rave that was too hollywood)

>However I'm simply not a peace and love raver.

i really dont care about the P, L, or U, but the R (Respect)
is something i place a lot of value on

create arguements and conflicts, dont love,
but have enough respect not to blatently lie

>I remember 11 years ago when all the rage was to make movies about punk
>rock and many "filmed" punk concerts happened and it was the SAME thing
>that happened in LA at Millenium:
>bad music, bad vibes, bad drugs, bad people, and bad press.
 
well there was some of all of this, there was also
GREAT music, GREAT vibes, GREAT drugs, GREAT people, and good press
i didnt have to look very hard for any of them,
but maybe i was just in the right spot

>No solid scene needs *any* hype from the multi-death-corporate Hollywood
>film industry. The media is a parasite on significant pop and underground
>culture- it feeds itself and kills the host.
 
Amen.

but i dont think anyone wanted hype from Millenium, 
people just wanted a fun time on a big scale budget

>Fortunately- the one thing that dance music has going for it is that often
>our favorite stuff has no vocals- and this will keep it out of the top 40
>for a long time- or at least until MCA convinces everyone to buy it.

definitely. although it was kinda funny cuz there was Farsi 
(or psuedo-farsi) on all the things, and no English...
so i guess they dont think Sony is going to take over the world,
some Middle Eastern oil barron will


i'll probably shut up about this soon, but its really hard, cuz well,
you know it not like people on the SoCal list go bitch about
the events in SF that they went to that sucked,

i could go off about how EVERY full moon i've been to has been busted
and for a year or two EVERY event i went to was busted
but, i listen to people in SF and know that things arent like that
so im not about to keep bitching about them,
nor spread rumours around here about the scene up there
from my limited experience

I swear, this is my last post on the subject,
(if i have anything else to say, i'll have someone forward it :) :)

i probably would have even given up on this, but 
there was some mention of the "real facts" and well..
i dunno...
maybe i've just fucked with my brain/body too much
but considering its also my academic major's strongest viewpoint,
probably not, anyhow
no such thing as "real facts" just people's perceptions..
(especially since a fact was that "millenium rocked")

so here's a bunch of random responses to people's comments
with their comments removed so you lose context :)

I really have to say that confetti en masse dropped from a
35 story building is one of the most incredible things/effects
that i have seen in a long time, 

Although it would probably be good to make sure that it is made
out of something that will degrade quickly, cuz there was confetti
all over the roof and in the pool INSIDE the bonaventure

------
Just to make the story as clear as i know it on this:

Aphex was reported as spinning and twiddling knobs,
but even at the mental state i was in, all the songs
sounded pretty much like i thought they should,
so im assuming the only knob twiddling was on the last incredible
noise track that he played

----------
i pretty much think they were done filming
(probably didnt get what they wanted either)
so they were all cranky and wanted to go home

but it pretty much seems to have been the fire marshall, 
not the promoters or the film crew
and i highly doubt it was for noise complaints,

i was the one rambling about people doing back flips off of transformers
into a crowd of people (who were being supportive and planning on
catching the person, it didnt seem like swimming or stage diving
where the participants on the ground arent always willing)

there was also a rad dance show on top of a bus stop
with a guy in drag doing psuedo-ballet
next to a very fluid more agile dancer :)

both of those things caused the fire marshall to Threaten to
shut it down, (as was announced over the PA)

and im sure similar activities occurred after that announcement,
but like 10 or 20 minutes before it got shut down
i noticed a bunch of EMT's walking through the crowd
so  the overdose story seems to be accurate for once

(that the OD's got it shut down, not how many there were
or what they were on)

----

finally, i really think it needs  to be said that i think
the fact that 10,000 people were in that small of a space
and there was seemingly no violence, is quite impressive

if there was a large supply of alcohol, there would have been 
plenty of fights and related injuries, but people seem to be ignoring this

(although, the cops said they were pleased with the crowd
and many people commented on how friendly the cops were...
some told my friends they should sneak into the hotel
and use the bathrooms there when they were asked where a bathroom was.
but same friends said they actualyl had some cool convo's with a few 
of the different officers...

gee. Cops are friendly and people are friendly back,
what a fucking amazing concept :)

anyhow.. enough of this LA shit...

When you say tonight, you mean tonight sept 21 (the date you posted

I thought the FMR was supposed to happen in Sacto? Is this another FMR

It was near the Marina, but not at the Sunset location.

The rumor was wrong, as most FMR rumors tend to be.

BTW; both the elmo and wicked lines gave out the directions early
this am.  Unfortunately, Janie & I couldn't make it, even though we were 
on vacation through yesterday.  The extra day delay blew it for us. :(

So, my friend is showing her pictures, but they are not from Burning Man.
Appearently she is still processing all of those.  :-)

I'm sorry, please forgive me, I'll try not to do it again <whimper>

Ciao,

Purple Tiger

ps the showing is at Vasuvios in the city around Grant and Tierney.  The
opening is from 6 to 8, but the pictures will continue to show for the next
few weeks.  I'm going to drop by before lube tomorrow.  

pps I will let you know when she's showing the burning man pixs.  She may
even let me scan some.

my room-mate (Talizman) tried to send this a couple of days agoa, but 
screwed up the addres to it got bounced back to me. Better late than 
never i guess.

O.K. I don't know where all of you were but obviously you wern't in the 
right area. I and my two friends were off to the left of the stage right 
were the pillers of the building meet all night well actually i went and 
walked around about every hour just to meet other people but always 
returned to that spot and all i have to say is besides the sound cutting 
out and the movie trying to get a good count down that they could use which 
went hand in hand it was the shit!!!!! all the people around us were 
dancing hard and all night hell most of us didn't even notice that the 
music cut out everyone we met were so friendly and nice and we met alot 
of people no negative vibes at alllllll....I really wish we would have 
met some of you there because if you would have seen how much fun we and 
all the others around us were you would have been happy to. one thing 
though james or john (i don't know which) cameron should have thought 
alittle more about how to deal with a bunch of people who are very high
and dancing to the groove of the beat. think about it they are not actors 
they are not getting paid they do not say how high when you tell them to 
jump. and if you want them to jump and scream when they are dancing you 
sure as hell DO NOT TURN OFF THE MUSIC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! get a clue if they 
wanted a great count down they should have keep the music loud and had 
lady miss kier come out and do the count down the croud would have went 
crazy.
well thats all.Talizman

For those of you party people who were at Millenium...

I'm just curious... I didn't get to go to Millenium, but I saw DJ Orlando's
name listed on the Millenium flier.  Was he the same DJ Orlando who plays
in Chicago with Freddy Bain and Lil' John?

Or was he another Orlando who plays regularly in L.A.?  I remember reading
of a DJ Orlando who plays L.A. in Xler8tor magazine.

The reason I'm curious is because Orlando from Chicago (along with Freddy
Bain and Lil'John) came out last January to SF (at a party called "Le
Plaisir de Vivre") and last April (at a party called "House").  I don't
know if any of you went to these parties, but I was at both.  I thought
these three guys played the BEST deep house I have EVER heard.  I don't
think I've heard anything better since then (well, with the exception of
certain nights at gay clubs).  And Orlando just blew me away.  I've
actually been thinking of flying out to Chicago just to hear them again.

If anybody can let me know which Orlando it was who played, I'd really
appreciate it... Thanks!!!

Much respects to the party people... Stop the negativity...

Agreed. I'm somewhat embarrassed that we've come down to this sort of
snobbery. This reminds me of the old house vs. techno threads that would
resurface periodically on sfraves in the last couple of years, only this
time, we're marking out geographical instead of musical territory. 

I had a great time in LA this weekend. I love raving in the Bay Area. I
don't think those two things are mutually exclusive.

Anyone who opens with Bam Bam's "Where's my Child?" couldn't be all that

According to Orlando himself he played for over two hours on the second sound

dancing.  He also got a gig in SF because of his performance.  He "had an
amazing time".

FYI- 

Galen played at a Basics a few months ago. I'm sure we'll be hearing much 
more of him real soon.

Though Sunset has gotten bigger I think it is still a cozy size but we 
must be more aware of cultivating a postive vibe and policing/cleaning up 
after ourselves. I actually picked up trash for about 20 mins this week 
before I left. It really didn't take that much effort, I just had to 
remember to DO IT.

Let's keep the posititivty going and remember what's really important 
in all of our emerging communities and new modes of being.

Peace,
Ronan (aka,Photon)

Subject: [comp.sys.ibm.pc.demos] [NEW RELEASE] Grind 1.1
From:    jleonard@falcon.depaul.edu (Jim R. Leonard)

             ----------------------------------------
Archive-Name: auto/comp.sys.ibm.pc.demos/-NEW-RELEASE-Grind-1-1

For all those who waited, were patient, or simply didn't know where to
get it, GRIND version 1.1 is now on ftp.eng.ufl.edu in the
/pub/msdos/demos/incoming/music directory for everyone's enjoyment.
(Keep in mind that those guys are pretty quick, and by Saturday it might
be moved to the /pub/msdos/demos/music/programs/players directory or
something.  :-)

For those who don't know, GRIND is a MOD/S3M/MTM/FAR/STM/669 player that
displays people dancing in time to the music.  Cool, but best suited for
techno/dance/rave/trance/hip hop music.  And yes, it supports both SB
*and* GUS (amongst others), so I don't want to hear any whining.  |^)

New in this version:  MODplayers shell support (many people complained
that they couldn't use GRIND from their favorite player shell, like DMPC
and the like, so the majority of changes in GRIND 1.1 is to facilitate
that).

There's a YMCA near the civic center, on Mcallister near Larkin I think.
It's right next to where the ill-fated Anthem of The Sun party took
palce, if that's any help.  Last year I dropped off an out-of-town raver
there after some party.  That's all I know.

the bay. Theres one in Fort Cronkite across the bay best get a map to find

There is a youth hostel in the SOMA area which is better located than the
China Town one.  I don't know the name or much about it, but it is right
beside the ICON restaurant (fun, crazy, cheap restaurant, with internet
access), on Folsom Street at 9th.

(reinterpretation=The Times staff needs to work on their fact checking
a little. [of course, a friend of mine ran up and said
"I found out! His name is JAMES RICHARDSON!" cuz i guess he wanted 
to go knock on his hotel door or something...])

before and i was indicating that i fit that bill)

(reinterpretation=You didn't need to SEE Aphex play. To hear is to believe.
[Aphex is really the only artist who plays "mind-crunching"(tm) music
that i have heard live.])

I do think its sad that Aphex didnt get booked in SF,
cuz even for 30 minutes it was an incredible time.

But hey.. he played there last time after getting jilted in LA.

You want an instant natural high?  Listen to this new release by MORPH,
called Stormwatch.  Incredible......  You can even do it in your office,
Wow!!

I bought a CD copy at Tweakin Records yesterday.  I am so blown away by
most of the cuts on it, I had to post something on it.  I don't want to
review it as that tends to pigeon hole and then I would have to compare too
much.  Let me just throw a couple of names here: Richie Hawtin (as in Fuse)
meets Aphex Twin in a Zen Paradox acid journey into vapour space and more.
(Oh well, so much for not comparing...)
One thing, it is not pound on your head with a hammer steady beat type
music, more idm. Oh yah, it is very trancey (my middle name).

This is a New Electronica Presents (not a compilation) and all tracks are
credited to 2 guys, Damon Wild and Dennis Ferrer.  Does anyone have more
info on this group or those guys?

See you all at Lube tonight!

Internet mail                 RE: Cloud Factory/Big Sur :)

Cloud Factory definately was a good time.  DJ Deaks, Shiloh, and all the other
DJ's did a wonderful job, and I left the next morning feeling like I had a very
good night.  

Unfortunately, Greg and I weren't able to make it out to breakfast with Deaks,
mostly because we were passed out.  

Sorry Ernie!  We want to do it sometime soon though!  Maybe this Saturday
morning after  Harmony  this Friday the 23rd in Santa Cruz?

Shiloh somehow piled us in Greg's car and started driving us home.  To me this
seems like an impossible feat, seeing as how I was somehow sleeping outside for
what seemed to be a few hours... sitting up.

I also feel bad that I missed Big Sur...  I REALLY wanted to go, but my physical
state prevented me, somehow.  Usually that's not supposed to be a problem!  ;)

Love and Harmony,
Todd
Support the Underground!

Internet mail                 RE[2]: Galen at bigger parties?

Todd> Until recently, Sunset WAS pretty much an underground thing.  Now
Todd> that everyone and their cousin knows about Sunset (from pretty much
Todd> all around the bay area), it's just not the same anymore.  It's

Dave> This really seems like nit-picking to me.

  Sorry, but it is just my humble opinion...  While Sunset remains an incredible
scene that does wonderful things, and while it is not the numbers that count
(VIBE _IS_ EVERYTHING!), I still think that Sunset has changed.

Dave> Even with 300 people you can still Feel what you put in come right
Dave> Back to Ya.  That is underground.  Not numbers.

  I think having Sunset growing to such a large size has some blessings, and
some caveats.  With more people, there is more energy, more understanding, more
love, but also more unwanted vibe (in my opinion).  I certainly don't enjoy
having BIG gangsta boyz in long, black, puffy trenchcoats stand up against me
and stare me down with their stone-cold look as I dance.  This does make me
uncomfortable, so to deal, I try to absorb the good energy around me for
comfort.  Once I feel better, I project back as much good positive love as I
possibly can from then on -- to EVERYONE, gansta's included.  It's a real drain,
but its worth it every time.  They end up backing off, but sometimes it takes
30-40 minutes of dancing my ass off (without moving my spot much) before they
will back off and leave me alone.

  It may be worth it to our scene to make this 'statement', showing how ravers
won't be affected by (what appears to me to be) blatant intimidation attempts. 
We will keep smiling, but sometimes I wish these guys that stared wouldn't try
to make such a point of their presence and intimidational power.

Dave> I think the fact that the party has changed makes it a better party.
Dave> The Freedom of the people to make the party and the Thrill of
Dave> watching it change is what it is All about.
Dave> It wouldn't *be* Sunset without the first small parties And these
Dave> later big parties.  Sunset is.  Let it grow.  Enjoy it.

  I agree entirely!!  It's a beautiful way to watch a good scene grow with good
people.  But I think you may have misinterpreted my tone.  I'm just a bit bummed
that Sunset will probably end up moving in a few weeks.  I would think that one
of the reasons for this is that Sunset is becoming a little too well known for
some people's tastes.  

Todd> Don't get me wrong, the energy is still and always will remain with
Todd> me as TRULY AMAZING at Sunset parties, but the fact of the matter
Todd> is, just too many people have begun to find out about it.  No wonder
Todd> Sunset will probably live on at the Berkeley Marina for only a few
Todd> more weeks.

  My above "fact of the matter" should be corrected.  It is only my opinion, and
I share it with SOME other ravers.  I apologize for such a poor use of
terminology...

Dave> And, of course, it doesn't hurt to have Galen transport the whole
Dave> damn meadow onto another planet like this Sunday...

A M E N.

Love you -- right back,
Todd

There's nothing wrong with a little blatant self promotion.  Where would

     (yes, it can be done) or a sound card
SB: Sound Blaster; refers to the de facto standard sound synthesizer card
     in the PC world.  like "PC", now refers to generic "Sound Blaster
     compatible" cards; uses FM synthesis to create sound
GUS: Gravis Ultra Sound; a rather nice (i have one :) ) sound synthesis card
     that uses wavetable synthesis to create sound. has an SB compatible
     operation mode; taken with all SB compatible cards, represents
     compatibility with 99.999...% of al PC sound cards. Capable of
     multi-voice, multi-timbral and 3d synthesis.
player shell: a program that acts like a unix or dos or whatever shell;
     typically text or window oriented; displays sound files; when one is
     selected, determines which "player" should be used, and calls the
     "player"
DPMC: one of the more popular player shells

Uh, actually I think the reason is a little more germane - summer's over.

Oops, almost forgot this again.  I haven't been out, so I might be
missing stuff.  Potion and Harmony sound pretty cool, dunno what's up
with the Moonrise Gathering - it could be really nice if it's well
organized, but I don't know who's doing it.  Sometimes the really big
things turn out really great, sometimes they're fiascos.  If you're
ready for either, it sounds worthwhile.  Don't forget Lube tonight,
with Weird Blinking Lights and more...

If all the ravers showed up dressed as their favorite animal, or as Carmen
Miranda, then I'm sure the gangstas would high tail it out of there.

Just a though,

Big synthesizers ate my fuzzy purple brain!

Wierd Blinking Lights dragged to Lube three big non-digital synths weighing
from 50 to 70 lbs each.  Wow, like they had wood cabinets and real plastic
knobs.    After Caliban spun a very relaxing set, he and Resonate fired up the
big beasts and started playing with a Maharishi dialogue going in the
background.  I wish you could have been there to hear the sounds these synths
made.  Wild, unfettered, liquid lava electrons screamed out of the speakers.
No on/off well behaved eletrons were these, no you could hear them fighting
as Wierd Blinking Lights pumped, prodded, and throttled the suckers in ambient
noise.  All I kept thinking about was all the capacitors, transitors, op amps
and resitors configured in strange ways for the purpose of herding the little
beasty 'trons around.  It helped me to back in touch with the quantum.

I think everyone should see and hear something like this at least once.   It
helps put the digital shit in perspective.

Ciao,

Purple Tiger

Just went by the place.  It is called the  "International Student Center".
It is *on* Folsom but *not* at 9th street, it's at 8th street one block

Hello SFRavers -

 I think I'll check out HARMONY in the Santa Cruz area tonight. I'll be
wearing a hand-me-down hawaiian shirt that's a hot lava red and orange!
So , if you see me , come up and say hello! ( Of course , if it's cold ,
I may be wearing something warm over the hawaiian print shirt ...)

A while back, Galen had talked about moving the party to Benecia if it got
too big, and in fact it was held at a Presidio location as a change of 
pace.  He was pretty nervous about it getting shut down because the permit
they have *doesn't* cover the size of Sunset.  But once a positive dialogue 
was established with the Berkeley police (who have kept an eye on this from 
the beginning) he realized that he might be able to keep a good thing going 
at the Marina.  Speaking to Jason, of the Pacific group that puts these on, 
they feel that the size last week (around 300) was manageable, while the 
500 of the previous two weeks was pushing it.  The cooler weather will 
probably keep things smaller and they are now planning to continue Sunset
through the end of October.   

We hope to dance with some of you at Sunrise 2night; call the 
Pacific (Sunset) number for details.

I think the Moonrise Gathering is actually being put on by Dee-Lite
(Kier, Dimitri, etc.)

At least thats what the (very nice) flyer would lead you to beleive.
Kier did the graphic design, it said.

The presence of Onionz and Joeski also points in that direction.
Its a regular NYC posse.

##    ...sorry about the messed up formatting the first time...  -Todd


  ___ We'd love to see you all at  Harmony  this Friday the 23rd! ___   

  It's going to go off at a beautiful, new outdoor location just north of
  Santa Cruz that has never been used!  This is the special Santa Cruz
  location that we wanted to use for the Harmony this last August 26th,
  but ended up locating at a beautiful spot in the city.  (It was a
  peninsula on the water overlooking the San Francisco bay, the city
  lights practically in our reach just beyond the bay on the other side.) 
     
  Our August Harmony turned out to be very successful, and quite a big
  turnout considering our relatively careful and conservative flyering and
  promoting.  This time we've printed only a couple hundred flyers, and we
  are relying more on our friends in the underground to support the scene
  and to spread the good word!

 ---->           This is Greg's Birthday Party!  (Yay!!)
       A great big Happy Birthday to Greg (of Harmony Productions) 
              and to everyone else in the world on this day! 

  Friday, September 23rd - Harmony                                 <-----
          DJ Deaks    Taylor    Tim    Tim McKnew    Donut
          A godly outdoor location about 15 minutes North of Santa Cruz.
          408.486.9591  408.488.9954

   We are doing everything we can to make this party free. IF we end up
  charging, it will be very cheap (less than $5), and only to break even.  

          We have _ZERO_ interest in making any money!

 =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
   There is plenty of room for tents, and also be sure to bring lots of    
    warm clothes, blankets, stuffed animals, candy, toys, water, lots    
      of love, and everything else that's good to share with others.    
        =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=--=-=-=-=-=

        Keep the Joy...
       Keep the Love...
      Keep the Faith...
     Keep the Family...
    Keep an Open Conciousness, and Dance Your Ass Off!

 Most of all, Respect Your Mother Earth!  (We actually mean it though!)

 Love and Hugs,
 Harmony
 Support the Underground!

I heard rumours that Organic was going to throw a party in golden gate park
this saturday
...any truth in these?

hey--if you are still going after Saturday night or Friday night and
want to hang outside and be entertained, may I suggest the San Francisco
Shakespeare Festival's production of "Taming of the Shrew" in golden gate
park next to the hall of flowers...it's right to the left of the pavilion
and the show's supposed to be pretty good.  You gotta get their early, though,
before the 1:30 "curtain".  the audience area fills up pretty fast.

It's Saturday and Sunday at 1:30, and it's free. Support local theatre and
enjoy these free performances!

have a good weekend...

I have to comment on this since it's become a kind of mission of mine:
"BIG gangsta boyz in long, black, puffy trenchcoats stand up against me and
stare me down with their stone-cold" 

Just the other night at Organic, Milton was saying that these guys(and gals)
HAVE vibe its just takes more effort and perception to "feel." Yeah, they can
seem frozen but the vibe is there its just swathed in enviromentally produced
protective defenses.  I suspect there's a little envy that you can open up
and have such a good time.  As I see it, these folks are our immediate
"neighbors"  in that the musical tastes are similar and often crossover, we
all love a good underground party often in similar locations because of
simple logistics, the use of  recreational drugs produces a lot cultural
commnalities, a suspicion of authority particularly it's enforcers, and just
plain old street style.  Since these are our closest neghbors in this world,
we're going to come in contact again and again unless we become isolated and
defensive ourseles.  Sure it's tempting to want 'them' to go away and
preserve an easy to handle more or less homogenous scene.  But if we want to
GO anywhere and actually put this PLUR thing to the test you gotta spend some
of your personal pleasure and try and make it work.  You might try and hang
out with 'them' - it's fun and the insight is worth it because then you won't
suffer the impression that they are so negative to your vibe and you'll
better know how to approach someone without fear of offending or pissing em
off.  Think of the potential - we're so close already, if we could make that
connection then we would have really done something towards changing the
divided social landscape that is preferred by the powers that be.  Its such a
simple thing really - let's party together.  

actually, its all the fault of that cement path :-)

bopper/gangster camps to seperate, but like he said, if you don't make a
distinction on who's where, you'll share their space with them, you will
become one of them, they will become one of us. Damn simple.
 Just do some buzzin', flit around all over the place, talk to somebody,
BEFORE MAKING THE F##@!# JUDGEMENT, and you will be surprised, pleasantly
even! Heavens to murgatroid!
 A lot of older ravers have lost their aversion of younger dancers, by
Sunset therapy, and must see that they have been missing out on their
excellent, innocent vibe (those kids are dancers, not tweakers!)
 Remember, if the scene is about acceptance, ACCEPT! Or at least give
everyone a chance to give you a chance.....


Have you hugged you gangster today?

	After reading the numerous posts regarding Sunset recently, I have
become so overwhelmed with fond memories of my trip to SF a month ago, that 
I thought I'd contribute a northwest perspective of the thriving scene that
you are all so fortunate to be a part of.  It had been several years since
I'd been to the bay area, and during that time I could only drool at what
I read and heard about the sfrave scene.  
	My first Saturday I was taken to the Chateau for MESS's 
"Disorientation", and had a great time.  I was charmed by the homemade 
decorations and the intimate vibe, as well as Scottie's wicked house
set and friendly energy-what a nice guy! : )  Before I knew it, however,
I was whisked off to a rave in Oakland in a somewhat scary part of town.
I don't recall its name, or the djs, but some blistering acid was being
spun which I enjoyed immensely, until I was again yanked to yet another
rave, this one in the city: "Hope."  I personally thought the size of 
this event was nearly perfect--not too large or small, decent visuals,
and GRRRReat djs!  This was the first time I had seen Carlos, and was 
astounded at his bombastic energy and uncharacteristic dj presence...
he was bouncing off the walls!  I have rarely EVER seen a dj break out of 
that stoic-moody-undemonstrative personna, what a refreshing sight!  Is 
he ALWAYS like that?  As Jeno brought in the morning light and the music 
stopped at 6, I was quite satisfied with the first day of my vacation!
(Btw, if anyone knows Wednesday, the promoter for Hope/Organic, please 
let her know that if she still wants copies of the Hope photos, she
can contact me via email or (206)671-3916...).

	The ABSOLUTE highlight to my entire vacation, however, was 
several hours after Hope at SUNSET.  The pure, positive vibe, the music,
the smiles, the view, the family atmosphere, all caused me to be  
filled with an overwhelming joy that I have not experienced to such a degree 
before (yeah, like e, but natural!).  I was utterly amazed that something
so incredible as Sunset went on EVERY week, for free!  It was enough to 
make me entertain the idea of uprooting myself from Washington, and 
simply pitch a tent at Berkeley Marina so that I'd never have to miss
a party.  Btw, for those of you that were there on August 28, I was the 
guy waving a big, lighted log of incense around and passing out sticks
to everyone.  Anyway, I think the Sunset experience is VERY special,
and it breaks my heart to hear that gangstas are dragging their 
unwanted, ego-filled, negative-energy selves to this event, AND, that
Sunset may soon be no longer.  Life is change, I guess, and I feel
very lucky to have been able to participate in something so utterly 
unique.  For those responsible for the Sunset parties, a warm and 
appreciative THANK YOU!
	The remainder of my week in SF was fun, having attended Deep Space,
then OogaBooga in Sac, and Groove Kitchen the night before I left, but
what could have possibly compared to dancing on a hill beneath the stars
that Sunday with a hundred or so smiling souls?  Blessed nothing.

(A big hello to dj's Scottie and Brad!)

Peace,

Andrew

A nice party in a great location!

 I managed to chaffeur Ernie Deaks to HARMONY at about 2:40AM , after
going up the wrong end of the road ( the road is a big loop that is
connected to HW 1 at both ends - something the HARMONY phone message
failed to mention ). 

 After parking in a lot near the road , it was a quarter-mile walk under
a clear moonlit sky to the glen were the big bass sounds were coming 
from. About 40 people dancing , about 30 sitting on blankets or 
hanging out or exploring. 

 Music ranged over various genres , including progressive house , trance ,
and especially fast techno during Deak's set. ( A bit too harsh and fast
for my tastes - must be my age  :-)  ). But even when I didn't dance ,
the listening was fine.

 Outside of the early morning dew , fog , and drizzle , the weather was
great , especially considering the rain earlier Friday . Very good 
crowd attitude , very chatty and friendly. The left hand speaker stack could
have been aimed better , but that the only criticism of the setup that
I  can think of.

Darn it, I forgot my records again!!!  Well, never fear, Greg and I 
shared the mixing experience together for the last hour of Harmony.  I 
had a lot of fun partying with the Harmony family.  They are really 
cool.  My compliments to the chefs Deaks and Taylor (from SJ, i didn't 
hear the SC Taylor spin), who were on before me and Greg.  Also my 
compliments to Taylor from Santa Cruz, who has the killer traveling sound

see you all at sunset tomorrow!

First of all, I think that we tend to forget that people - be it ganstas or
ravers or whatever - are first human beings.  They also want to belong.
Being that we are as a whole (not everyone) but mostly very insecure with
ourselves we should be somewhat a little more understandable.  The guy
standing right beside you may just be just that *very insecure* person
*posing* as a ganster.  I WOULD SUGEST JUST SMILING BACK AT THEM AGAIN AND
AGAIN AND AGAIN. They will get the message that they do not need to put up
a "severe front" just to belong. All ravers are friendly accepting
individuals.  Maybe you should advance and just ask them to dance with
everyone and it would not surprise me how many would just do that.

Maybe the next time you see them they would be wearing a totally different
outfit - bright colors and a love peace sign.

What do you think?

hey all,


  well just wanted to give this little post and say that Sunset was
a JAM.  I got there around 4 and for the first two hours or so chilled
and danced up on the hill and checking out the American Flag that had
written on it  "The United States of Free Love" :)
  i then went down to check out the dj (who i later found out was garth. 
ignorrant i ;) and he was spinning some groves and i couldnt help but
find my body out dancing. And i continued dancing. Galen (sp?) was next
and his set was amazing.  I never once was let down by it the whole time
he spun. There were a few slight mistakes in his spinning at the beginng
but it didnt detract from the music he spun. Kudos to the that Meat Beat
Manifesto song near the end of his set. 
  Lastly was Jeno, who i havent heard since Jan. 1993 in Boston. He
just totally tranced me out and then made me groove at the end esp. 
when he threw on that "I have a dream" song. 
  So a very cool time. Sunset parties are the shit! when it got dark 
unfortunately the fog rolled in but the strobe and the laser and blue
police light were really cool effects. I didn't expect to stay to the
end but the music and the vibe made me :)

sfravers i met up with: Stevie and Phillip

peace and hope to see ya next week

Captain's log, stardate 9/26/94 at 12:57 am:

We have just taken the shuttlecraft "Frieda" back to Ten-Forward, which 
is currently docked in Santa Cruz.  I have personally had a wonderful 
experience at the Sunset party.  Tricorder readings were off the scale 
for positive vibes from other humanoids.  Mr. Spock danced his little 
vulcan ass off all night and didn't stop until the Klingons arrived and 
claimed back the Berkeley Marina as their rightful nesting ground.  So we 
all had to leave very quickly to show the Klingons that the people of the 
Federation (of love) are the most diplomatic people in the quadrant.  
After refeuling at Starbase "eat-a-pita" (falafel's only $2.50), we 
headed home under full impulse power and music by Dee-Lite.  After much 
analyzation in the ship's computer banks, I can only come to one 
conclusion:  SUNSET'S COOL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I'm new to this scene: I started to grok the rave thing at the burning man 
out at the SPAZ camp.  I've been listening to the music for quite a while 
(I was a DJ many years ago, so somehow you never leave, and the desire to 
hang with the mix, however private is still there.)

Anyway, I made it to Harmony near Santa Cruz. (A group of us burning man 
alumnus camped out: it was really trippy to wake up to find all the ravers 
packed up gone.)  I also went to Sunset last night, where I had the top of 
my skull completely blown off by the music and the vibe.  I have come home 
after so many years of wandering.  To just be there, dance, groove, vibe 
and hang see the beautiful ocean going sleep under thick blankets of fog 
was best.  I'll be there next week, most likely wearing blue polka dotted 
shorts.

they call him...vordo!

A year ago, various poeple were predicting the imminent death of
raving and I knew then what is so obvious now - they couldn't have been
more wrong.   There are just too many people who believe in the
magic of house music & dance...  It's not about money or egos or fads or
look-at-me performers or why-doesn`t-anyone-spin-my-favorite-kind-of-music; 
it's about people coming together to share and immerse themselves in 
positive energy and feelings of joy that come from being reminded how 
good this thing called "life" can be when we let down our hangups and 
experience some PLUR with friends, strangers and the surrounding cosmos.
Just like Woodstock 94 was a success because the *people* wanted it to
be, good vibey house & techno parties will continue because people want 
them to.  

There were 5 free outdoor parties (that I knew of) to choose from this 
weekend in addition to a couple of commercial ventures for the unclued.  
Deelite bailed out of the Moonrise Gathering, apparently something to
do with money guaruntees... hopefully they will soon bail out of the rave
scene altogether:  There is little need for a has-been pop band trying to 
glom onto raves in an attempt to keep themselves commercially viable.  
There were rumors at Sunset that Deelite was going to show up and do 
something for us - I suppose having Lady Kier model some of her outfits 
at the top of the hill would have been entertaining for about 5 minutes.

Anyway, the little bit of life Janie & I try to have outside of raving
and work prevented us from going to most things this weekend.  Not being 
very enamored with the 24th & Illinois site, we sadly passed on Sunrise.  
I made it to the Organic GG Park Bandshell party where a bleary-eyed 
Pacific crew had set up Galen's sound system on zero sleep from the nite
before.  Galen was spinning to a tiny crowd which grew with Graeme and
Jeno.   Organic decided not to use the Bandshell stage, and the lack of 
publicity kept this party relatively low key.  But like most free outdoor 
daytime parties in the sun, the vibe was relaxed and happy.  

When we arrived at Sunset, C3 was finishing up an ambient set that I
felt was a bit too loud.  Space music shouldn't be an assault - but I 
guess we always had the choice of chilling out further away.  Solar 
followed and was a bit housier than usual.  Then Garth came on and blew 
everyone away with a fresh sounding acid house set that I felt was better 
than what I had heard from him at the last Wicked.  Galen followed with
a blistering set that was rather Jenoesque - and in fact I felt it
outshone a good Jeno set that followed.  

Jeno, Garth, lazers... Sunset was a big-time party this weekend, with
most of the core SF House folks in attendance.  It was very smart of
Galen, who really does want the chance to play at big parties, to 
sandwhich himself between Garth & Jeno.  Hopefully, Martin and the other 
luminaries who were there took note.

We bumped into a bunch of SFRavers, uh let's see; Ronan, Derek,
Willis, Ethan, Bryce, Robert, Tony of Synergy, deepfog, Purple
Tiger, Grey, Kathryn, Niels, Gil, the Normals, Crunch, the Amebas, 
Jon D. &  Ann, Gregg, Anthrax, and others I'm sure, and we also met a 
very enthusiastic new convert: Vorgo - we didn't even know he was on the 
net until seeing his post this morning.  Welcome!  d:-)

Although Sunset remains the best party around town, it's innocence and 
PLURity was a little tarnished this week.  Near the end we encountered 2 
girls who were searching in vain for their probably stolen backpacks and  
A blank cassete was stolen from the Pacific crew who were then forced 
to tape over Solar's set in order to get Jeno's.  As far as "gangsta" 
presence goes, we *still* don't know what anyone is talking about with 
this.  If a couple of non-ravey observers happen to be watching us, what's 
the big deal?  And as usual, we interacted with someone who had just 
wandered by, never having heard the term "rave" or even "techno" before, 
asking "What is this?  This is GREAT!"  We could see the virus entering 
his soul...

Mijo,RavnBird, some confusion:
 Your quote was by deep fog (tony), adding to Phuture's quote (at the
bottom of tony's post) which you may not have read.

Phuture wrote that as he talked to me about the strong G factor at organic,
I responded about givenem a chance and just approach with his normally low
level of judgement. He did. Situation resolved.
Some people have felt bad at sunset for the same reason, working out of
those olllddd stereotypes,the same things we want to avoid, when authorties
and fearful figures spy down on us...

Tony only   added that if we give them love, they can lower their barriers. 
But why is a gangster not dancing mean he's not having fun/threatening
while a sitting raver is just chilling?
 "They" don't have to dress in overalls or clown costumes, don't have to
hug (although I wish evreyone did both!) to fit in our scene.So amy
"ravers" don't. So many people dress to impress, ie at wicked, why is
G-fashion any less accepted?

Try to draw them in, they'll fit in. Many of them already are....

Lotsa love to all considered, 
 Milton and the E-Bee............

ps: Rogaine the Velvet Frog-E says: ever seen a low rider with hydraulics

Mijo, you (lee fogel) refer to people who paid to party as being clueless,
yet you say "maybe Martin will take notice of Galen"!Uh oh, contradiction
city....

There are good money parties. And no one calls wicked  commercial, but
that's exactly what it is, especially if you look at their sloppy FMR
delivery over the last 2 months....

If Galen feels that he needs a big party outlet:
 1. sunset is a huge mutha
 2. He'll put one together and charge for it, why should Martin be the one
profitting off of galen's vibe?

but i do agree about you comments on dee-lite. If they want a rave
following, follow us! Show they care. A free performance would have shown
their love. Punishing us for intouractive's sloppy organizing and
dee-lite's overt monetary motivation   makes it clear: 
#@*! lady kier!

Sunrise was at 24th and Illinois.
I gave semi-lurking sfraver Steve Boyer a ride out
there and met a few other friends as we were parking.

It was a very nice warm evening.  Pacific and asphalt.
The crowd was smallish and into it.  Maybe 75 folks 
with the majority staying til sun-up.  Alex and Ethan
dj'd - and I don't know who else.  Unusual number of
capitalists about.  I met Carita (the slo mo disco queen)
and Stacy and Jake.  Got some free bagels straight out
of a dumpster from a group of Rainbow travelers.  Who
throws the Go Figure parties?  We chatted for a bit.
She was a particularly inspirational type. Jason
said Sunrise was his party with a big smile.
Morning flowers, a burning couch, 
and nice people.

I brought a few friends to Sunset.  They loved it.
One friend had never listened to any house or
techno until he came to visit this weekend.  He
was impressed with the "earth vibe" and even said
that "somehow technopop seems perfect".  
Go Sunset.

Yet another wackey raving weekend
=================================

  This Friday evening,   SunRise...  Brought to us by those beloved
SunSet folks.    So,   after checking the info line by about 8:30 PM,
I discover that the info wasn't put up yet.    So,  I head down to 
San Francsisco to hang out on the Haight,  and visit some friends
until the info comes out.   We all meet at the Horseshoe Cafe
(Where the SF Net terminals are) on a rather warm and unusually muggy
night.    It had rained earlier (First rain of the season),  so 
we suspected that site selection hasn't yet taken place.

   About 11:30,   the info came in....   "It's at 24th and Illinois",
the old standby spot,  so we all pile up in the car,   and head out
there.    None of us has any money this weekend,  so Potion (At 177
Townsend) was completly out of the question.    

   When we arrived,  the sound system wasn't up yet,    so we hung around
and schmoosed with all our friends,   and scouted out the area.    They
had paved the area,   so the site had an ideal dancing surface.    

   It wasn't long before the music started,   and the place started to
fill up.    Don't know exactly how many people showed up,   but I would
say about 100-150 folks showed up at it's peak.

   Alex spun a totally insane set of hard acid techno (140+ BPM) and at
that pace,  it wasn't long before my body really warmed up,   and got
into the music BIG TIME.    After that,   our own Ethan (SFRaver) dished
out some pretty funkey housey tunes,   most of which I haven't heard before.

   Solar then took over,   and upped the energy level yet another notch,
and I pulled put all the stops on his set.    Galen (From Sunset) then
took the controls and twisted my brain (and body) big time....   WOW!!
All these new DJ's.... Fresh new music.... and FREE!!!

   The weather cooled quickly,   a fire was started,   most welcome,  as
lots of us chilled out by the fire,   to warm our outsides up.

   Next thing,  the sun started coming up,   but no cheering (like Sunset),
but still a lot of folks remaining.     Eventually,   as the morning
progressed,   people were leaving around 9 - 10 am,   and people were
cleaning up the site.....  We left around 10 am,   and headed back to
the Haight for some free food at one of the Churches,   and prepared to
head out to Golden Gate Park for Organic,   yet another free party,
Organic in the park.

   I split off from the rest of my freinds,  and head out to the park,
where I home in on that familiar "thump thump" sound.   Only about
40 - 50 people were there at about 1:30, with Galen was at the controls.

   Eventually,  DJ Dan got on,   and dished out some incredably awsome
sounds,   scratching in some really creative sounds that got everyone
cheering.

   This site (Golden Gate Park),  often frequented by Japanese tourists,
and people from all over the world,   had people come over and watch,
and even some joined in and danced.    It was amazing.....

   By about 4:30,   the energy level reached critical mass,  when the
generator ran out of gas.    It took more than 20 minutes to nurse it
back to health,   but eventually the music started again.    Within
minutes,   everyone was dancing again.   

   All too soon,   6 pm finally arrived,   and we were given the chance
to hear the last song,   but just after a few beats started up,   the
generator conked out again.    So,  ended yet another afternoon in the
park.    I head out to the Haight with a friend who treated me to dinner
(thanx Matt),   and head up north to chill for a while.

   This big WICKED Dee-Lite party that was supposed to come off at a
Northern outside site,   never materialized,  and was later moved
to either the DV8 or the Sound Factory (Never did find out which one),
but if free tickets were to become available,   my friend was to call me.

   Before the party in GG park ended,   I was informed of yet another party
at same location as Friday,   but a dear old friend needed me to help him
out,    so I stayed home.

   Sunday......  Folsom Street Fair....  Where all the leather dudz,  and
freaky gays go out and strut their stuff.    Last year,  I happened to
be in the area (At Boogy Buffet),  so I checked it again this year,
but with no money,  I couldn't even scarf up a drink of water,   but
I did get in a little dancing.    WOW!!   That sound system sure was
powerful..   I got tired of looking at naked men,   so decided to head
over to E. Bay for Sunset.    As I arrived,   about 200 raving maniacs
were at it with full viger.   Now THIS! is my kind of party....

   This was the largest Sunset party yet.    I don't think it got to
1000 people,   but I would guess about 700 wonderful people were there.

   Hah!!  one gangsta type came up to and said "Have you hugged a Crunch
today",  and hugged me.   There was nothing out there but pure joy and
tons of high energy.

   As the sun was setting,  the fog came in,   cooled things down,   but
didn't damp any of the energy in the least.    In fact,  things picked up,
and went totally insane.    At 10 pm,   the last song was announced,  and
everyone put in their heart and soul on the last song.   An announcement
"The park is closing,   please pick up your trash,  and leave as quickly
as possible".

   I finally headed home with a "shit eatin grin on my face".....  winding
up a very nice "SMOKE FREE!!" bit of ravin....  ALL OUTSIDE!!  Simply
WONDERFUL!!   

Have a nice day everyone...

for those who have been wondering precisely what i've been up to out
here in (soon to be cold and dark) Boston:

the access group, a licensee of technology / sister company to the
company i founded out here, has just released their first online
catalog.  i've attached the short press release below.  it's pretty
nifty and we're all really happy to see it happen.

if you've got Mosaic, take a look.  it's pretty funny...

btw i will be in SF October 7th through the 14th on business, but i'm
definitely planning on making it out one or two nights.  i'm
especially hoping that YSH will go off on the 8th, as i'd love to see
some of that posse (hi Maui and Susan and any others who might be on
the list these days)...

take care everyone!

Milton & E-Bee
> Mijo, you (lee fogel) refer to people who paid to party as being clueless,

I was only referring to the 2 choices for this weekend: The hyped
Moonrise Gathering fiasco, and Potion, the noname-promoter Sat. nite Club 
party at Townsend that I heard was a predictably vibeless affair.  People 
who shell out $10 or greater for big-flyered parties with no idea of what 
to expect while there are an abundance of free outdoor parties with the 
same big name DJs are (IMO) somewhat clue-deprived as far as raving in the 
Bay Area goes.  I really didn't mean to be insulting; I started out as
clueless as anyone, and even now will sometimes attend questionable events 
out of curiousty.

> yet you say "maybe Martin will take notice of Galen"!Uh oh, contradiction
> city....

True if I was slamming all commercial parties, but I wasn't.

> There are good money parties. 

Totally agree.  The good ones are usually thrown by promoters with
established reputations.
 
> If Galen feels that he needs a big party outlet:
>  1. sunset is a huge mutha

I'm sure that Galen wouldn't mind being paid for his talents, as well as 
be able to just spin without having to be the supplier of the sound system 
and backbone.  He has made clear to me that he wants very much to be 
noticed by established promoters.

>  2. He'll put one together and charge for it, why should Martin be the one
> profitting off of galen's vibe?

Because Martin (and a few others) have the savy that it takes to put 
together a big high quality event while attracting a relatively good 
vibe - without going bankrupt.  Everyone profits from this, not just the 
promoter.  When Galen feels he can recoup an outlay of the thousands of 
dollars it takes to throw a good big commercial party, maybe he'll 
throw one.  Right now, I think he'd be happy just to spin at a few.

just give the kids a chance, man.  the rave scene is supposed to be about 
helping others break down the barriers that we have all learned to put up 
as a human race over the past 2000 years (and beyond).  if we don't 
accept these people in, then we kind of lose the whole meaning and the 
scene will begin to degenerate because it will be a "clique" <--- sound 
familiar???  hmm???

Gangstas probably have to sit around radiating attitude -- if they
start dancing, all those stoopid oversized pants will just fall right
off. Or they'll trip themselves up.

Kinda reminds me of this thing that happened to my brother in law
(sister's husband) who lives in NYC -- he bought a pair of colorful
"cross colors" pants and was wearing them, you know, like pants are
supposed to be worn. So this kid, dressed inna gangsta stylee (full on
baggy, butt-crack-and/or-boxers showing) just had to come up and tell
him "you're wearing your pants wrong!"...

PS: for the record, I noticed no gangsta presense whatsoever at the
recent sunset raves. On the other hand, at the one 2 weekends ago, I
did notice this girl dancing in oversized pants trip and fall over her
own pant leg. I personally find dancing and loco-motion is much easier
if your shoes are the main interface to the ground, not your pants.
Guess I must be getting old and conservative. Those craaaazy kids!

Hello Sfraves--(and Lee Fogel, for hint, hint, hinting to POST!!!)

Well, It's kinda of nice to be missed.  It seems like at each of the parties
I've been to recently; Groove Kitchen, Phutur, Organic,  Wicked, and Sunset,
people have come up and asked me where I've been.  Maybe my new beard  has
been a bit of a disguise, but I've hardly been able to disguise my 6'5"
frame. I've recently purchased some new vests at "Cognito," (my favorite
store in Santa Cruz, for those who've asked)-but I don't think that it
either--I think it's because I was away for a lot of the summer and didn't
POST.

I guess if you don't post you begin to look like you're  being beamed up on
the Starship "Enterprize."--A disintegrating SFraves molecular memory--and
shimmering shred of Past-Life participation.  S0, "Post or Die" is the
subliminal manifesto here. 

 Let me stretch out the gauntlet again (especially to Lane, my fave-rave
buddy)  and to all those Sfraver's "Lurking on the Skirts"--but desperately
wanting to blurt their blurbs.....................Break on through to the
other side!!!!!.Break on through.................... 

(Repeat.this Mantra 10 times, if you ever have doubts or fears about
posting...........)

Having been with SFRaves for over a year, has anyone else noticed the
delightful absence of any real acidbath flamewars
this summer? Very little electronic blood seems to have been shed during the
summer months. Do you think the Sunset parties, with their positive,
feelgood, loveGroove vibes, have contributed to a certain Sunset Vibe on the
Net? I do. 

And there are so many more people I can attach a name with a face, rather
than just an e-mail address. And I am sure that is true for others.

Even while I was "dancing in the dark," last night, people were coming up and
saying hello. People were waving around incense, glow-sticks, and the dreaded
marriage-E-wanda.

 While there are still a lot of people left to meet on SFRaves, I think a lot
of people have met,  and spent more time together at the Sunset parties.
There just seems to be more space for  smoozing it up when you're shakin' and
bakin' that groove thang,  and the music isn't so loud you have to pull out
your ear-plugs  to talk to someone, Eh?

Although I did have a little trouble conversing with Milton's Frog, but he
did have  that hand stuck all the way  up his ________, so I'll have to
forgive him. Ouch!!!!

All in all, it was nice to look out and over a sea of bobbing heads, dancing
to the music, that blue K-mart Shopper light spinning, red squiggle lazer &
strobe,  and feeling a vibe as thick as my dear old mother's cheesecake. I
even had fun staying to pick up trash!!!

 BTW, I've been asked to give a presentation on telecommunications in
education at the national conference for the "Coalition of Essential Schools"
in Chicago on Nov. 2-6th. If anyone has information on clubs, record stores,
or info lines for Chicago, let me know. Or, maybe a hot line to Mark Farina?

Well now.. I'm no expert.. but I loved Potion... It was NOT vibeless... :)
Guess it depends upon who you talk to... The only problem was that people 
cleared out too early.. at about 6 AM.. when the dancing went on til 7AM

I also enjoy paying $10 for something at TROC/Townsend/King St because I`m
guaranteed that my nite won't be hosed by someone busting it for permits etc.
Just one of those "on the one hand... on the other hand"... but I would
consider that I'm making an informed decision.. not a clueless one :)
I've done the free rave on the 
beach at 4AM on a cold SF Morning... right now, being the relic that I am.. 
I sorta prefer the hot sweaty Wickeds even tho' I`m $10/$15 poorer...
Now Potion was no Wicked... but it treated its clientele with much more
respect.. was VERY well produced and organized and I betcha someday they'll
go bigtime.... 

but hey, what the hell do I know... :)

it goes & gets down!

It's Sunset! I had a really great time. Thanks to 
all who threw it & participated. It just blows my mind 
to see so many people having fun. I was only there for 
about 3 hours 6-9ish. I spent most of my time in the 
DJ cheerleading section sweet spot- right in front of the 
tables. I saw Niels (I think) and Cpn. Crunch, grooving 
a bit to the left of me towards the speaker. I guess I was
into my groove a bit too much- they disappeared before I 
thought to say hello- well, hello! I was wearing a green 
dress with a cream&black striped shirt tied around the top,
an orange suede jacket, and some sneakers. It was really 
neat-o, becuase I took a friend of mine who hasn't been 
out on the scene for nearly two years. Of course, she ran into 
some people from way back when & it was just wonderful to see her 
enjoy herself at such an "event." Around nine, as we skipped away 
to the car, she commented, "we should do that again sometime."
Coming from a heavily jaded post-raver, that's the best compliment 
that I have for the sunset crew. Keep it coming... please?

Ob: have you hugged your gangsta today?

I didn't really see any gangster type people- at least 
not to my mind's eye, anyway. Then again I wasn't 
really looking for gangsters. There was only one 
negative incident which I witnessed-

This guy was sort of dancing, sort of slamming into other 
people who were dancing- basically, trying to be bothersome. 
He kept yelling things at the DJ (Galen?) like, "play the shit-
you think this is the shit! that ain't the shit- this ain't goin'
off, man!" while sort of throwing himself into other people's dance 
space & into other people. Everyone around the tables got 
very quiet & dropped the groove. 
It kind of got my blood up- I kept thinking that if I 
had been at the turntables, it would have really thrown me- 
but maybe I'm thin-skinned. Anyway I tried to get a cheer going, 
but I didn't time it very well with the music so it didn't have the 
effect I would have liked it to have. But I think it gave other 
people the same idea- during the next mix/transition, people 
started to whoop it up again. Problem solved. I'm not sure whether
the human "the shit"-ometer kept grooving or headed for the hills.

I had a terrific time, regardless....

Take care-

Jocelyn

If you will re-read this quote from my previous message, it may tell you why I
feel so particularly uncomfortable about this whole "gangster vibe" that I
experienced at Sunset two weeks ago.

  I said on 9/22/94: 
Todd> I think having Sunset growing to such a large size has some

Todd> ENERGY, MORE UNDERSTANDING, MORE LOVE, but also more unwanted,

Please note that what I experienced I DO NOT BY ANY MEANS perceive as positive
energy.  I feel that I was being physically threatened, and NOT AT A DISTANCE as
Milton implies is all that happens.  I don't feel like this unsmiling, very
unhappy looking guy follows me around, only inches away, so that I can't dance. 
I'm not the type that tries to show off or anything, I just like digging into
the music and the vibe REEALLY DEEP when I dance.

Milton> "They" don't have to dress in overalls or clown costumes, don't

It has absolutely nothing to do with fashion for me!
OK, Here's what happened:
  Basically, this fairly threatening looking man with a very unhappy overtone
about his presence decided to fuck around with me.  (I realize that this
"overtone" is MY PERCEPTION, but it's STILL MY PERCEPTION.)  He stood still
flush up to me, behind me and two my left slightly, only inches away.  If I
danced any more than strictly in place, he would rub up against me like he was
trying to start something.  I kept as much of a positive attitude and demeanor
about myself as possible, trying not to look affected by him.  In reality, I was
shitting in my pants, wondering if he was about to pull out a knife and take a
stab at me at any moment -- because he thought I was ugly, or perhaps because he
didn't like the way I was smiling and looking so happy or something. 

_I FELT THREATENED_ and I didn't know what to do other than to move over a bit
(among the already crowded dance area DIRECTLY in front of the DJ table).  After
I moved over, he continued his power/intimidation trip on me, so I just ignored
him and dug into the existing good part of the vibe that was ever-present.  I
tried to share with him as much of this good vibe as I possibly could, and
perhaps some of it got through.  He eventually backed off, but you have no idea
how hard this experience was on me.  I was so shaken (albeit not so much visibly
so), that I had to go sit by myself on the other side of the Big Hill for about
a half-hour or so to sort things out.

What is this fear that I have fallen to?  Should it be this way?  Am I wrong for
feeling threatened?  Am I not being understanding enough, or loving enough? 
What great lengths more do I need to go to in order to be as readily accepting
as you make it sound so easy for me to do, Milton?  Do gangsters ever fuck
around with you like they do me?  I'm 6'3", I smile a lot, and I like to dance
for my own personal pleasure and to share energy with others around me.  Maybe
I'm doing something wrong -- I don't know...  I wasn't going to give him a hug
-- he looked like he wanted to eat me for lunch!  (Would you if you were in my
shoes?)

Let me state that I am still dealing with my feelings about all of this, and
that I'm TOTALLY open to discussion that could potentially change my whole
viewpoint on this, and I'm interested in knowning how others might feel if they
were to deal with a similar situation.

How would YOU feel???  

I love you all.
Todd

Mijo,RavnBird, some confusion:
 Your quote was by deep fog (tony), adding to Phuture's quote (at the
bottom of tony's post) which you may not have read.

Phuture wrote that as he talked to me about the strong G factor at organic,
I responded about givenem a chance and just approach with his normally low
level of judgement. He did. Situation resolved.
Some people have felt bad at sunset for the same reason, working out of
those olllddd stereotypes,the same things we want to avoid, when authorties
and fearful figures spy down on us...

Tony only   added that if we give them love, they can lower their barriers. 
But why is a gangster not dancing mean he's not having fun/threatening
while a sitting raver is just chilling?
 "They" don't have to dress in overalls or clown costumes, don't have to
hug (although I wish evreyone did both!) to fit in our scene.So amy
"ravers" don't. So many people dress to impress, ie at wicked, why is
G-fashion any less accepted?

Try to draw them in, they'll fit in. Many of them already are....

Lotsa love to all considered,

I never thought I'd see the day that a "raver" calls baggy pants stupid :)
Back in the day (read in your best grandpa-chilling-on-the-porch-with-a 
bourbon-and-a-blunt voice), before ravers were "ravers" and raves were 
just acid parties (like in Manchester circa 1987) house music people were 
refered to as "baggies" on account of their pants.  (Happy Mondays: "Dad, 
you look shabby/ you run around and groove like a baggy")
So are you going to alienate me on account of my jeans are a foot too 
big?  I don't think so.  Really they don't stop me from dancing my skinny 
little ass off, so don't you worry your pretty little head.  I kinda like 
the way they flap around my shins.:)
(please don't consider this a flame, or even an attempt to start a 
discussion on the politics of fashion, I'm just havin' fun with it.)

BTW, I have seen NO (imho) gangsters at sunset.  I keep wondering what 
all the fuss is about?  Some of those kids are a little raw maybe, but 
gangsters? come on.  Not to invalidate anyone's experience or anything; I 
mean, being intimidated is REAL and SERIOUS, but having met up with 
actual, truer than life thugs on a few occasions, those sunset fools 
ain't shit. (But that's only my observation)
 Positive/Negative.... it's all just energy. If you try to vibrate only 
on one side, you'll find you can't.  Please don't try to force any values 
on anyone.  They become self evident at the apropriate time, anyway.  
   Having spent a fair amount of time amongst "hippies" (whatever that 
means), I'm worried that our scene, as it wakes up and becomes more 
conscious, will fall into the same sort of moralizing and patronizing 
tone that assures us that WE ARE RIGHT, but really pisses off the rest of 
the world.  I guess I'm moralizing a bit here, too, sorry.  I just 
believe in our potential for total acceptance, and don't want any of the 
vibe to get cut off, especially the funky parts.

really, it all stops mattering so much when that fat beat hits...

love,
whitsitt

p.s. the free love flag got kinda dirty, so we might have to re-paint it 
after washing....

Yep, someday I'll be able to tell my grandkids "I was at Chemistry's 
make-up party."  But seriously, I had a good time.  I had to go-I had 
never been to a Chemistry before, but it was at my favorite Mexican 
restaurant- El Flanker in East Oakland.  It's a cool place- an old 70's 
steak house with a disco floor.  There were lots of people there, but it 
wasn't "massive"-in the hundreds somewhere.  They did charge $2, but I 
didn't mind.  Carlos is a blast - so much energy.  Nice guy, too, went 
out meeting people in the crowd after his set.  I think Christpher and 
Dutch ("CDC=Carlos-Dutch-Christopher") spun also. The crowd was quite 
young.  Younger than me, anyways.  Mostly teenagers.  But there was a 
large variety of young folk there, huggy ravers, fashion plates, suburban 
gangstas.  The young ravers there were enthusiastic indeed,  some of them 
just *had* to come talk with me ;).  The only negatives were the usual 
annoyances, breakdancers and nitrous zombies.  Not enough people dancing 
sometimes.  The sound was pretty good.  There were two systems, one was 
the familiar SF sound, the other was mainly old school dance music.  All 
in all, quite worthwhile.

Well...

I wouldn't judge someone by what they wear at a rave. I've seen it all
(or feel like I have).

I _do_ think those big baggy pants are silly looking.  Some of the
stuff I wear at raves (like my big Bach shirt) is silly looking.

So? Be silly. Have fun :).

stoopid kids.  i am getting concerned that maybe someone should start a

alt.G-spot)

try to imagine what styles the gangsta's future children will be into.  
how will these former gangsta kids, now, of course mature and responsible 
adults, will feel?

I don't think anyone likes being treated like that.  It may well be that 
he was just unconsciously jealous that you were so happy and he was not.  
But I think that the best way to handle people like this is to try to 
treat them just like you would any other person you've just met---could 
say hello, wassup, or whatever you think might be some lingo they can 
relate to.  Then if they don't respond, maybe LEAVE the area as quickly 
as possible.  I highly doubt that he was really going to start anything 
with you, since it sounds like he was by himself.  No?

Is it possible that you are trying to project to much positive energy 
onto them that they are not ready for?  Does this happen a lot to you?  
Some of these people might take you smiling at them as threatening them, 
because they are so used to being negative.

I think this guy did a good job of stealing energy from you.  You must 
realize that he wanted to instill fear in you, and from reading your 
post, he did a good job.  So you have to find a non-violent way of 
showing him you are not afraid of him.  I would normally do this by 
introducing myself to him (but I don't think I would hug this dude just 
yet.  he's not ready for that just yet).  Read Milton's quote down there, 
I think he feels like I do...

I feel a bit bad posting this after someone posted about the fact 
that there have not been any flame wars here, BUT: 

I am a bit irked about the

Big baggy clothing = menacing gangsta

argument.  First, let's look at the social problems this creates.  The
media has lead some to believe that an entire style of clothing has 
been created for young, irate, murderous thugs.  And thus, anyone 
who wears this stuff is someone that should be feared, someone who
must be dealt with the powers that be.  Actually, big, baggy clothes
are not a gangsta threads, they are simply an urban style.  After 
living in South Central Los Angeles for three years I can say that nearly 
every kid in the city wears these clothes, it is just the urban style.  
Is it such a surprise that kids in the city will be wearing different 
things than kids in the suburbs?  Life in the city is 100% different
than life in the suburbs.  Not always better, not always worse, but 
just completely different.

Now that we have stigmatized this urban wear as Gangsta Threads,
we have almost mandated that the law can take "special precautions"
in dealing with young people wearing these clothes.  We know that
many of the kids in the city are minorities.  Can you see where this
argument is going?  By labeling all city kids as gangstas, we will only
further the racism and (if you want to go so far as...) genocide in the
inner cities.  Go to central Los Angeles, and you will see everyone
in the urban style.  Are all these kids criminal gangsta types?  The
media will tell you absolutely, so I guess we just have to eliminate
this little problem.

Styles change.  Compton used to be clothed in 70's sweats and 
sportswear.  Does this mean that all the Adidas Kids are gangstas
too?  Miss Lady Keir, are you a gun-toting criminal?

We need to stop judging people by the clothes they wear.  It is really
just as bad as judging someone by the color of their skin.

Personally, I absolutely love the urban style.  Big clothes are just so
darn comfortable!  I can't imagine dancing in anything but big
pants, big long untucked shirts, boxers, ect.

Because the weather is starting to get cold, I figured this weekend I 
should invest in a good jacket for club-going in SF.  I ended up
getting a big, long, puffy black jacket.  It's the shit!  It kept me
very warm while waiting outside of DV8 (*choke*, yeah, it was a 
nightmare, don't ask me why I went), and it also served me well
while I caught the "top of the hill vibe" at Sunset.  It is simply the
best type of jacket for the stuff I do.  But, after reading Niels' post,
I realized that a lot of people out there are going to think that I am
trying to put up some kind of attitude or something, just because
of my jacket!  Jeez, I hope that is not the case, because I'm really
not that type, but... well...  who knows.

Let's just judge people from the inside out, okay?

-troy

PS.  I have yet to meet many, many SFRavers at Sunset.  Look for me.
I'll be the tall guy wearing... well, you know, and hanging out with 
the Adidas Kids...

I was watching the final episode of Star Trek the Next Generation the 
other night, and an interesting subject came up that I didn't pay much 
attention to before.  For those of you who don't know the episode, I will 
BRIEFLY outline it.  

Captain Picard is being transported through 3 different time periods in 
his life:  the past (when he first took command of the ENTERPRISE), the 
present, and the future (everyone is old and grey).  In each of the time 
periods he is drawn toward a particular sector in space to find a rupture 
of "anti-time".  When time and anti-time mix, they annihalate each 
other.  

In the future, he no longer commands the Enterprise and somehow convinces 
Beverly Crusher (who is now his ex-wife) to cross the neutral zone and 
find this hole.  In the other 2 corresponding periods, he takes the 
Enterprise out there. 

In the future, he gets to the point in space, but finds no hole.  
However, the hole is there in the other 2 time periods, and it is much 
larger in the past.  He says we must find it, and they scan with a 
"tachion beam" to look for this invisible rupture.  He also in the other 
2 time periods did the same thing.  So what happened was all 3 beams met 
at a common point in space and CREATED the very rupture he was looking 
for.  

I've been thinking about this a lot, because it brings one question in my 
mind:  Is it possible to create your own destiny just by believing 
something is true?

It's not only possible, it is the only way that things work.

Matter arises from consciousness, not the other way around.

Yes.

"Belief in truth" worked quite well for Adolph Hitler and Charles
Manson didn't it? "Belief" caused many a heretic to burn at the stake,
and inspired many a parishioner to light the fire. "Belief" in our
ability to classify human versus sub-human got us slavery, genocide,
the crusades, etc. Belief in the "manifest destiny" of the colonizer
stole the land from many a native in many a country. Belief in the
power of the atom caused the scientist to ignore the dangers of
radiation.

Not that beliefs are inherently good or bad. "Democracy" ultimately
rose out of englightenment beliefs, for example. On the other hand, the
US Govt is happy to invoke "democracy" and/or "capitalism" as
justification to interfere with other countries and  cultures -- can
you say Vietnam, or Panama, or Iraq? Just mentioning the word
"democracy" invokes a certain "leap of faith" among some US citizens
even though the zeitgeist of democracy gave up the ghost long ago.

Perhaps if fewer people tried to create their own destiny (and others')
via belief,  life might be more pleasant for everybody else. Imagine
how pleasant human history would be without belief in the truth of
nationalism,  capitalism, socialism, communism, religion, etc.

Belief, like drugs, are powerful and should be used carefully, in
moderation, and with great skepticism. Belief is drugs to some extent.
People can and will twist reality to fit around their beliefs, rather
than vice versa. Mass consensual hallucinations are not always a good
thing.

Perhaps the true path, grasshoper, is the one reached without belief. :-)

I don't think anyone here means to make lite of Todd's gangster encounter. I
certainly didn't.  I would still like to see everyone dress up as their
favorite animal and go to a rave, gangsters or no gangsters.  :-)

Have you ever met a person that doesn't understand a word you're saying?
No matter how your explain something to them, they just can't understand.
It's almost as if their mind is on a different planet than yours.  There are
folks that are that way about positive energy.  I mean, you can smile all you
want and they still won't get it.  Todd's gangster might have been one of
those.

What do you do with folks like that?  I don't know.  Me, I keep my distance
and wait for the channel to change or for Todd to drive 'em off. :-)

Ciao,

Purple Tiger

Speaking of dreams, I believe I dozed off sitting in the sun there
at Sunset because before my eyes hundreds of people appeared out of
nowhere.  It certainly felt like I was dreaming then, with all the
music of my dreams (I often dream in technocolour) playing and people
dancing.  It didn't feel like anything on this planet anyway.

I'm glad Lee mentioned me in one of his emails, otherwise I wouldn't
have any proof that I was there.

There are certainly those that believe so, that if you devote enough thought
or effort to your dreams they will come true.  I also think that if you desire
a particular destiny too much, you'll never be happy with the one you got even
if it is what you were wishing for.

Seek instead to be happy with whatever life gives you.  Once you let that
happen, you'll see all the wonders you've dreamed of.

> I am a bit irked about the

> argument.  

I never said that. In case you feel like checking the facts, I've
included my original post below.

Basically, I was gently poking fun at a rather stupid fashion (IMHO).
Next week, maybe I'll pontificate about stupid shoes (like women in
high heels), or the incredible Karmic benefits derived from wearing
brown Rockports.

Fashion should be poked fun at, because it is fundamentally stupid,
unnatural, and poseurish. Even worse is when fashion becomes a uniform,
As it has become with the mega-baggy wear (i'm not talking raver baggy
here either, I'm talking gangsta baggy, which is extreme to the point
of disfunction).

(I like silly, unique, personal styling. I give more props to someone
that clothes themselves from a thrift shop than some poseur that is
trying to buy their way into a culture by picking up the latest baggy
and/or grungewear at Emporium for big $$$$. I like it when I wear my
patented atrociously psychedelic 1960's polyester golf pants  to a rave
just so I can hear all the big-hairspray club-girrrlz go
"eeeeeeeeuuuuu!". Now that's fashion!)

I don't like the idea that fuels fashion amongst its victims -- the
idea that you're not cool/hip/popular/sexy unless you're wearing
something that some 'droid in the head office of a department store
decided was hip for this fall's back-to-school lineup. Isn't it just
"strange" that next year, something else will be in? Consume kiddies!
Consume!

Unfortunately this is somewhat true, except that the "entire style of
clothing" has been created for poseurs that think they can purchase
rebellion. Actually, gangsta fashion is pretty stupid now that it has
shown up in shopping malls across America. Just how much gritty urban
authenticity are you getting when you lay out $50-100 for a pair of
pants? 

Equally stupid are the record execs pushing "gangsta rap" gansta this
and gangsta that towards what is ultimately a white suburban market.

I dunno. I can understand a big baggy jacket in NYC or DC in the 
winter. It doesn't make any sense at all in central LA. No, we're
talking mass conformity here. It's not a race thing, it's not a class
thing, it's a lemming thing. It's a stupidity thing. I reject it,
straight up, no chaser. Can you dig that?

This urban style (i've been told) evolved out of gangsta style of the
ghetto on the east coast. The oversized pants were supposed to show how
much you've slimmed out while in prison. How that style made it into
every suburban shopping mall in amerikkka is a great "mystery". Almost
as ironic as "grunge" becoming mainstream suburban fashion.

Equally mysterious is the marketing push towards "gangsta" rap. If you
don't see the hand of corporate marketing executives at work here, then
you're blind. (If you want racial conspiracy, try to remember that the
chains of slavery have been cut, to be craftily replaced with the
invisible shackles of the wage slavery, credit card payments, keeping
up with the joneses, and "fashion".)

I just don't understand "gangsta" -- it is not something that deserves
respect, and it is not going to get it from me in any shape or form,
whether it's action, pose, or fashion (although I probably will respect
a loaded gun pointing in my direction). I can respect wanting to
overthrow the government, I can respect disenchantment in the system. I
can't respect a fashion solution to the problem. You can't solve what
ills the nation by putting more money in the hands of the powerful. 

> we have almost mandated that the law can take "special precautions"
> in dealing with young people wearing these clothes.  We know that

I think you're putting words in my mouth. 

> Can you see where this argument is going?

Yes. But it's your argument, not mine. I guess I was originally just
trying to be funny, but what with all this P.L.U.R bullshit, I guess
you can't really say much other than "the song was 120 BPM" without
someone snuffing your expression.

> We need to stop judging people by the clothes they wear.  It is really
> just as bad as judging someone by the color of their skin.

Wrong. You can change your clothes. You can't change your skin (unless
your Michael Jackson).  People are wearing the clothes because they
want to be judged. Otherwise they could have saved their parents a lot
of money and shopped at K-Mart.

> Personally, I absolutely love the urban style.  Big clothes are just so
> darn comfortable!  I can't imagine dancing in anything but big
> pants, big long untucked shirts, boxers, ect.

I'm wearing loose-fitting comfortable clothes myself. I guess you just
missed the humor in the "baggy one upsmanship" that seems to have
migrated from the east cost to the west in the past 5 years.  It is
ridiculous to see these kids unable to cross the street cuz they're too
busy trying to keep their pants on. I think it's both funny, stupid,
and pathetic, all at the same time.

Gangstas probably have to sit around radiating attitude -- if they
start dancing, all those stoopid oversized pants will just fall right
off. Or they'll trip themselves up.

Kinda reminds me of this thing that happened to my brother in law
(sister's husband) who lives in NYC -- he bought a pair of colorful
"cross colors" pants and was wearing them, you know, like pants are
supposed to be worn. So this kid, dressed inna gangsta stylee (full on
baggy, butt-crack-and/or-boxers showing) just had to come up and tell
him "you're wearing your pants wrong!"...

PS: for the record, I noticed no gangsta presense whatsoever at the
recent sunset raves. On the other hand, at the one 2 weekends ago, I
did notice this girl dancing in oversized pants trip and fall over her
own pant leg. I personally find dancing and loco-motion is much easier
if your shoes are the main interface to the ground, not your pants.
Guess I must be getting old and conservative. Those craaaazy kids!

This was my fourth time in a row at Sunset and I'm determined that this
time I'm going to write something about it. Anyway, it continues to be
way cool (can you still say that about a rave or is it now obligatory
to say that it was the shit? :-) Definitely becoming a habit. Got there
late this time (after six) I think the DJ playing was Simon at least
he looked like the guy who played after Galen last week and I was told
that was Simon (Assuming I really know which one was Galen) Sorry, I'm
still trying to sort out these various people and I don't know many of
them by sight yes. Anyway, after Simon was someone I didn't recognize
at all. The light show after it's dark is getting better too. tonight
someone brought a strobe and a small laser.


[I wrote the above last night after coming home from Sunset. After
reading the messages today I am convinced that I am totally confused
about DJ identification. Could someone help me out? The guy I though
was Simon has long medium brown hair done up in dreadlocks and
gathered into a pony tail. Last week he came on about 7:00 and played
until 8:30ish. Yesterday he was spinning when I got there a little
after 6:00 and turned it over sometime after 7:00. I'd like to know
his name 'cause I really liked the stuff he was playing.]


Wish I could talk more about the music but I don't really understand
the terms I hear being used. I'm beginning to be able to distinguish a
sort of continuum with one end being the stuff that's slow[er], more
melodic, with more vocals and the stuff that's faster, has almost no
melody but is more like pure rhythm and has few if any vocals. Is this
the difference between "house" and "techno" maybe? But I'm still
confused about the meaning of terms like "deep", "acid", "trance",
etc.  Could anyone point me to someplace where I might learn about the
different kinds of music I've been hearing?


About gangsters.  I was kinda surprised to read Todd's remarks
about gangsters at last week's Sunset 'cause I didn't remember seeing
any. Maybe I missed them. Anyway this week I was looking around to
notice the types of people there. I did see a couple of people dressed
in what might be called "gangsta" style but they didn't really look
like a gang somehow. There were lots of different kinds of people
there doing all different sorts of things, dancing, standing,
juggling, sitting, walking
around, whatever... The all seemed to be enjoying themselves and
nobody seemed to be looking for trouble. I though that's what the
scene was supposed to be about. Anyway, that's what I like about it, all
different kinds of people coming together just to have a good time. If
"gangstas" want to come and have a good time too, I say that's fine.

Again, I wrote the previous paragraph last night. I don't think I want
to change it much. I would like to add that I'm wary of attaching
labels to people especially based on superficial attributes like
clothing style. Because once you slap a label on someone you start
reacting to the label instead of the person. And so do other people
who hear the label and maybe never even saw the person. 

I think maybe I've said enough for my first real post to sfraves. I
just want to thank the organizers of Sunset and all the people there
for some really good times.

Later,
-Bill

That was Garth last Sunday.  And you are right about it being Simon
the week before.  2 different people.  Galen came on after Garth - 
young guy with a baseball cap.  Then Jeno, older guy with a baseball
cap.

Check out the rave FAQ on hyperreal.com. If you can, use a Web browser
like lynx or mosaic.  Otherwise FTP or gopher might still be supported.  
And while you're there, check out "The Spirit of Raving" directory to get 
an explaination of what Niels refers to as "all this P.L.U.R. bullshit" :)

The REAL trick is to find the balance between being happy where you are 
and at the same time pursuing your dreams. Determining what the Universe 
has in store for us (as opposed to what we THINK we want from life) 
requires the greatest test of who we are: that of unbending self-honesty.

I agree with this point of view.  Certainly if you are too focused on 
your future, you will be too blind to see what is directly in front of 
you, and you'll trip up.  I like to try to see what is driectly in front 
of me and what is soon to come.  That can by reworded by saying "I follow 
my intuition", unless my intuition tells me to jump off the GG Bridge or 
something ? like that...

Hello to all of you SFRavers!  I am writing because on Oct 7th I am
going to be losing my email ability and will no longer be able to read
SFRaves. (many frowns inserted here)  This is ironic, the reason that
I am losing mail is because I am starting a new job in SF!  I will be
getting out of Modesto and since that is the thing that has kept me
out of the scene....well you get the idea.  Anyway I have until the
7th so if anyonehas any ideas on how to stay in touch without a
computer please let me know?????  

Dan Arquette
dana@u097.ca.vp.com

P.S. I hope to get to sunset this weekend even though I have to deal
with moving.  I will probally need the rest!

You should be able to get a Denon for about $1000 or a Stanton for $700
(new).  DO NOT buy the Gemini one...  Most important flaw: it's cueing
sucks--with a single press of the search button you jump about 2 seconds in
the song.  It's also front loading instead of top loading.  The Technics
one is beautiful, but its about $1300+ for a single disc player.

The Stanton CD-11 allows you to cue frame by frame.  I have one and it's
nice; missing a few bells and whistles, but I didn't have money for the
Denon.


Feel free to email me if you want to hear more about it:)


mike

P.S.  Please don't flame--I also have a pair of 1200's, but use my CD mixer
mainly for ambient music which I have found much harder to obtain on
vinyl...


Anybody who can recommend a source of ambient vinyl around here?  It would
be much appreciated....

> Fashion should be poked fun at, because it is fundamentally stupid,
> unnatural, and poseurish. Even worse is when fashion becomes a uniform,

	I must really agree with these sentiments... Clothes are after all
clothes... If someone takes a little bit of gibing about their 
appearance, especially when it is not meant as a cut, then what does that
say about their personality? Actually quite a bit... and I think the point
of that fashion tends to destroy unity was well made. How am I supposed
to include people who do not want to include me because I am not decked
out in the proper gear. So before anyone goes and flames me for being lax
remember that unity works between individuals in a group and even if one
person is opening up to all, if that person is being excluded for any reason,
there is no unity, just someone being open in a group of people... Right,
well, that does not mean that I run around saying that I will not be open
to people who put themselves above me because their clothes cost more, it
just means I have another reason to go PPPTTTTHHHHBBBBB and smirk for a bit
while they try to figure at what the hell I was going PPPPTTTTHHHHHBBBBBB
at... (You those of you who do not know me, I like to PPPTTTHHHBBB just
abouyt everything, but I think my favorite thing to PPPTTTHHHBB is myself,
which after a few seconds thought, might mean that people who only interact
with me for a short peroid of time take my PPPTTTHHHBBBs the wrong way)...

	As I see this, this is only partly true. You could go and shop at
K-mart but then you must take the abuse of those around you for not being
in the times. This is a problem with fashion, in that it is one of those
vicious cycles that people like to associate with 'bad' habits, ie. 
you get made fun of for not dressing to current fashion code, so to stop
the unwanted abuse, you go and shell out far too much money to dress to
ths code, but then you want something for your money (I guess) so you
decide to make fun of people that do not dress to the standard (ok, not
everyone does this, but the fashion cycle seems to work this way from
an outsiders perspective). Does this make fashion a bad habit?

> "baggy one upsmanship" 

	I think this is the real point of this arugment, or at least the
point which is being argued past. One person is looking at the attitude that
is often comes with a style, and the others defend the style or those that
the generalization does not apply to. When the I-am-superior attitude appears
people tend to notice, but not necessarily the fashion or the look associated
with the superior being. Surely, it is just the attitude that is being
recongized. And I tend to think that part of the gangsta image is an I-am-
superior-to-thou attitude or image (which is the real attitude, the image
one wants to portray or the way they actually feel?) which if sufficient
effort is made, can be gotten past. Whether or not this image will be broken
for more than the evening, I guess, is inconsequentual... 
	I guess I question the need to always be breaking down other peoples
attitudes, I have enough trouble finding time to sort out what I believe. 
And for some reason I have trouble 'forcing' someone to open up if they make
no move to do so on their own (I do not consider coming out to a gathering
to get blitz out of one's skull and go around exerting their trip, which 
seems to be unwanted a movement toward opening up). But I do see that an
effort should be made to explain what is going on, to give the person an
understanding of that in which they are trying to involve themselves. Yet I
do see a point when a person has rejected what they see in front of them, 
and decide to exert an unwelcome trip upon a mass of people who do not wish
to have that trip exerted upon them. In some ways, I believe that the 'scence'
as a whole can be too anti-confrontational, I have seen parties die from this
(take examples: look at parties which have happened at 16th and Harrison,
after my third one there, I vowed never to return, for the very reason that
no one including myself was going to do anything about about 10 people who
radiated a few stars worth of attitude, or imagine a nice little intimate
house party which was crashed by the local drunken frat group, yes, this is
personal experience, which killed a good vibe for the entire night, even
after we asked the group to leave...) One might quickily observe that even 
when something was done, the vibe was killed and this is something I do not
know how to work around. I believe that there is a point when enough is
enough, and something has to be done about attitude (hold over from my
teenage years of shows at CBGBs in nyc, nyhc :) )... But then, eventually
I might find myself rejected in my whistle blowing frenzy (I like noisy
parties where things are intense, and I think my dance style may be a bit
aggressive, it was termed by a friend as the way Max dances in Where the 
Wild Things Are(Live?), I take that as a compliment). Again, the problem
I see is that any line drawn is abritary and will most likely alienate
someone who does not want to be alienated... What to do????

There's an article in today's San Jose Mercury News about why women's
clothes are priced so much higher than men's: women attach more status
to clothing and will pay more. Men (for the most part) don't follow
fashion and won't pay those prices.

 "if they start dancing, all those stoopid oversized pants will just fall
right off. "

Actually, there is a minor but undeniable thrill in dancing in baggy pants
that are seriously in danger of falling off -- try it, you might like it :-)

I think the fun about fashion is to see how much you can look like you just 
came out of a Magazine without spending money.  I can go buy designer name 
clothes, silks, linens, wools, and many others for less than I can buy cheap 
clothing at Kmart.  I am more into finding basic clothing out of good fabrics 
at less than $10 an item.  If I can buy some DKNY jean shorts for $8 at a 
clearance store, I for sure am going to buy them over any $15 jean shorts at 
Kmart because designers often use higher quality fabrics that will last longs, 
and will wash better than Kmart's clothing.  Don't go spend tons of money on 
the latest DKNY or J.O.E. or Todd Oldham, when you can get the same stuff at 
discount stores, or on the clearance rack for 80% off the retail price.  Don't 
waste money just for the tag, all those tags end up at discount stores in the 
end anyway.

Fashion is a statement that is meant to impress others.  By devoting a lot
of time and energy to putting down 'fashion plates', you are only strengthening
the cult of fashion, because people are fashionable so they will be noticed.

The difference between fashion and cool clothes is the wearer's attitude.
Do you wear that outrageous hat because you like it, or because (say) sanp-
(oops) snap-brims are in this year and you see people wearing them on
bus kiosks?

Second: a note about attitude.  If people keep getting in your face while
you're dancing, go into the thick of the dancing so you won't feel isolated
and the person trailing you will have to work to follow.  If they're still
there, just ignore them; don't try to bump them, but if they get in your
way don't worry about it.  Fix them with a long stare; keep smiling and
dancing.  Don't stop looking at them until they leave.  I haven't met the
attitude-monger yet who will stand up to this, since the only two options
are to start a fight (dumb, you're in a big crowd) or go away.

Both these points tie together in that if a person is not physically
coercing you, they only have as much power over you as you give them.
Don't give up your personhood to someone else's projected image.  Project
your own, and let your two images fight it out while you keep dancing.

>Fashion should be poked fun at, because it is fundamentally stupid,

Self Decoration is basic to human beings
I think it is very natural
I also think it should be fun ;)

>(I like silly, unique, personal styling. I give more props to someone
>that clothes themselves from a thrift shop than some poseur 

I give more props to those who make their clothes

I love thrifting  
this doesn't guarantee unique stylings
all this summer's soccer/seventies sweat pant stuff comes to mind
thrift store fashion trends go big

It is difficult to use 'fashion' (what others wear)
as inspiration without just following along.  
Not every painting or poem or idea you have is
going to be your greatest.  So you should
stop because of this?

It seems to be very confusing for people.  To the point where
many just don't get into it or have convinced themselves 
that they are making an anti-fashion statement (snooze)
For some, the whole idea becomes a big negative
Like somehow it masks the true person 
And photographs can steal your soul ...

It is a shame to get turned off to what can
be so beautiful. There are some talented 
people in SF decorating themselves for
everyone's enjoyment. 

What is cool, 
is that it is There
for you to Play with 
if ya want to

People appreciate those Pants
I love any Effort
Especially at a Party !!

I thought i would combine two topics..

I like baggy-ish jeans...I love watching people with the super baggy
jeans (the pants as wide as the shoes) go off...I tend to like dancing
in baggy shorts (the leg just under the knee)...

my buddies and I are trying to addd two more speakers to our decks...we are
going to be pushing 2 pairs of 12" or 13" cerwin vega HED speakers...

I am looking for an amp that will make us happy...any ideas where to look
for some?

thanks

Don't misinterpret an emphatic display of
strength and power as a threat to you.

That alone is Not a reason for fear.
Don't attribute motives to someone's behavior.
Take it for face value. 

Do what ya want - I always try to act tough
when someone throws that my way.  I like it.
I don't get to flex my bad ass inner self
as often as I should.

Respect.  Don't escalate it.
Have pride.

Virtual world where are you?

In reality...yes, I believe that if you focus enough energy towards one
goal, that may become your destiny.  I also believe that you mostly (other
than catastrophic events) have control over that destiny.  If you look in
one direction to a point on the horizon you will get there eventually,
maybe through some steep valleys and some exhilerating climbs along the
way. Obviously and fortunately along your journey you will discover many
diverging paths, diverse beings, exciting adventures but if you do not lose
sight of that goal you will reach it undoubtably. Remember there are no
rules, just creativity.

Your destiny could simply be fulfilment as a whole, the balance between
body and soul, peace with oneself and the world around you.

I live by this simple line: "Life is not a rehearsal - live it to your best
now 'cause you do not get a second chance".

Peace...

A quote from our buddy Jimmy Swaggart:

"The homosexual has no place in society, becuase he is a fundamental
threat to the nature of society. Through  unnatural acts, he spreads
immorality and disease..."             -JS, "Things God Hates", 1991

At least being queer doesn't make one a poseur, too.

"...Saved their parents..."??? Some of us spend their own money to be
stupid, unnatural and poseurish, thankyaverymuch.

i believe (har har) that you can't find yer true destiny
  if you know what it is; because that'll blind you to the
    signs that otherwize would've lead you to that destiny.
furthermore, since it's really unlikely that anyone would
  REALLY KNOW their destiny, even SEARCHING for it could still
    topple you off the path you would have persued elsewize...

so, to really find what you seek, look for something else entirely,
  and clear your mind of all things pertaining to what you originally
   sought.  all of a sudden, when you are TRULY looking for something
    else utterly unrelated, the original thing you MEANT to find will
     pop up and boink ya on the nose...

at least that's been my experience...

Our culture has traditionally insisted on women's involvement with 
fashion, and has not (until recently...historically speaking) placed 
a lot of emphasis on men being involved with fashion. Of course there 
has always been the well-dressed male, but being well-dressed is 
quite a different issue than  being involved with fashion. And "the 
well-dressed male" in American culture (to me anyway) has always 
brought to mind the suave and urbane European male...but the European 
male has traditionally been involved with fashion (look at LouisXIV!)

I'd agree that it's stupid when it becomes a uniform and the 
person(s) doing it don't understand why they're doing it (the lemming 
thing), but I don't see that fashion is "fundamentally stupid"... do 
you care to explain?

What's wrong with somebody wanting to look good? to do something 
flashy and fun to get noticed? I think it's natural for people to do 
stuff like this. It's a problem when people do it without being aware 
of what they're doing... because their friend, mother, boss, priest, 
teacher, billboard, magazine, television tells them that if they 
don't do it they're not worth anything. So how much of this is a 
problem with individual people or with the culture we've created?

Just to add some support to this....this is a great record...if you like 
techno, and (god forbid) breakbeat, you'll like this. it's melodic, as is 
most other Induction stuff and has really nice beats. at least check out 
the file to see if you like it first , but keep a look out for 
induction's other releases...

On - E Jungle ?    that doesnt surprise me,  slowly but surely after my 
request for jungle six months ago, the good shit has come my way.

Art Forum several issues ago called it the paradigm rave music... Most of 
it is a lot like old hardcore breakbeat techno just a bit "classier".

The stuff I like is like high speed ambient. We are going to release 2 Dj 
Dara tapes soon. Heavy Jungle Vibe! He visited us from England last week 
and recorded us a special mix.

There is a DIE CUT flyer! with the words ambient jungle on it  415.241.1560

But I like fashion. I think it's one of the greatest human inventions. I used  
to be fairly clueless about fashion -- thinking it has nothing to do with me,  
but a trip to paris few years back completely changed my opinion of it. I  
appreciate people who pay attention to what they wear and how they put their  
clothes together and how they mix their colours -- with a hint of vanity,  
flair, and fun. I like that touch of vanity in people (otherwise I think they  
are boring).

Granted, it is stupid when the person who is trying to be fashionable fails at  
it miserably, but I dont see why fashion itself should be the blame. That  
person who cant carry it off is stupid, IMHO, not fashion, as an institution.  
When somebody does it "just right", it gives many of us a sense of 'perfection'  
like a piece of art is perfect. I think fashion, when done right, definitely  
feels very natural, brilliant, and adds a certain joy to life.

Good morning...

Well, Todd, I think you did everything possible to avoid a potentially 
harmful situation. When I was doing rape education seminars at San Jose 
State, the first thing I'd say was "Trust your gut instinct." If you feel 
threatened by somebody, move away from the person. That's what you did, and
the situation abated (eventually).

Being threatened *sucks*, especially when you're at a place where you don't
expect it to happen. Furthermore, it WASN'T your fault. Don't blame yourself.
You were at an event and this jerk decided to fuck with you. It was HIS fault,
not yours.

Hope you can put this out of your mind -- he isn't worth getting upset over.
Of course, a couple of weeks ago was my four-year anniversary of being raped 
after a party, so I know that it can be difficult to forget about it and move 
on. Take comfort in your friends, try to not think about it, and keep 
dancing!

--Lynn

If you will re-read this quote from my previous message, it may tell you why I 
feel so particularly uncomfortable about this whole "gangster vibe" that I 
experienced at Sunset two weeks ago.
     
  I said on 9/22/94:

Please note that what I experienced I DO NOT BY ANY MEANS perceive as positive 
energy.  I feel that I was being physically threatened, and NOT AT A DISTANCE as
Milton implies is all that happens.  I don't feel like this unsmiling, very 
unhappy looking guy follows me around, only inches away, so that I can't dance. 
I'm not the type that tries to show off or anything, I just like digging into 
the music and the vibe REEALLY DEEP when I dance.

It has absolutely nothing to do with fashion for me! 
OK, Here's what happened:
  Basically, this fairly threatening looking man with a very unhappy overtone
about his presence decided to fuck around with me.  (I realize that this 
"overtone" is MY PERCEPTION, but it's STILL MY PERCEPTION.)  He stood still 
flush up to me, behind me and two my left slightly, only inches away.  If I 
danced any more than strictly in place, he would rub up against me like he was 
trying to start something.  I kept as much of a positive attitude and demeanor 
about myself as possible, trying not to look affected by him.  In reality, I was
shitting in my pants, wondering if he was about to pull out a knife and take a 
stab at me at any moment -- because he thought I was ugly, or perhaps because he
didn't like the way I was smiling and looking so happy or something. 
     
_I FELT THREATENED_ and I didn't know what to do other than to move over a bit 
(among the already crowded dance area DIRECTLY in front of the DJ table).  After
I moved over, he continued his power/intimidation trip on me, so I just ignored 
him and dug into the existing good part of the vibe that was ever-present.  I 
tried to share with him as much of this good vibe as I possibly could, and 
perhaps some of it got through.  He eventually backed off, but you have no idea 
how hard this experience was on me.  I was so shaken (albeit not so much visibly
so), that I had to go sit by myself on the other side of the Big Hill for about 
a half-hour or so to sort things out.
     
What is this fear that I have fallen to?  Should it be this way?  Am I wrong for
feeling threatened?  Am I not being understanding enough, or loving enough? 
What great lengths more do I need to go to in order to be as readily accepting 
as you make it sound so easy for me to do, Milton?  Do gangsters ever fuck 
around with you like they do me?  I'm 6'3", I smile a lot, and I like to dance 
for my own personal pleasure and to share energy with others around me.  Maybe 
I'm doing something wrong -- I don't know...  I wasn't going to give him a hug 
-- he looked like he wanted to eat me for lunch!  (Would you if you were in my 
shoes?)
     
Let me state that I am still dealing with my feelings about all of this, and 
that I'm TOTALLY open to discussion that could potentially change my whole 
viewpoint on this, and I'm interested in knowning how others might feel if they 
were to deal with a similar situation.
     
How would YOU feel???  
     
I love you all.
Todd

Mijo,RavnBird, some confusion:
 Your quote was by deep fog (tony), adding to Phuture's quote (at the
bottom of tony's post) which you may not have read.
     
Phuture wrote that as he talked to me about the strong G factor at organic, 
I responded about givenem a chance and just approach with his normally low 
level of judgement. He did. Situation resolved.
Some people have felt bad at sunset for the same reason, working out of 
those olllddd stereotypes,the same things we want to avoid, when authorties 
and fearful figures spy down on us...
     
Tony only   added that if we give them love, they can lower their barriers. 
But why is a gangster not dancing mean he's not having fun/threatening 
while a sitting raver is just chilling?
 "They" don't have to dress in overalls or clown costumes, don't have to
hug (although I wish evreyone did both!) to fit in our scene.So amy 
"ravers" don't. So many people dress to impress, ie at wicked, why is 
G-fashion any less accepted?
     
Try to draw them in, they'll fit in. Many of them already are....
     
Lotsa love to all considered,

imho, it is not only possible to create your own destiny through belief 
structures, but that it is inevitable that you do so, whether conscious 
of it or not.

  Yes, there was Jungle played at Wicked's party at DV8 last Sat.  Super 
DJ Dmitri was the one who through it on.  I started freaking out and 
dancing my ass off but a lot of people just stood there :( .. I even 
heard a 'club girl' say "Don't ever go to a party if you see this guys 
name on the flyer, his name is Dmitri!"  

  As if hearing Jungle wasn't enough, Garth (I think it was Garth) played 
some acid during his FUNK MANIA set.  I guess the world is beginning to 
appreciate the energy a solid 303 groove can create.

  Speaking of 303 grooves, I finally finished a tape loaded with hard 
acid and trance.. Much thanks to Ethan and Lee for inspiring me at the 
last F&F.  I can't afford to mail it out (except to the people I allready 
owe, Hi Jacob!) but if you're interested in a copy, perhaps we can meet 
somewhere in the city.. Haight would be easiest for me..

  Thanks to everyone who came out to Harmony!  Special thanks to Larry 
for coming WAY out of his way to pick me up.  I had an awesome time 
spinning for all my friends :)

  Peace out...

	Right, so we seem to have a large discussion of attitudes
connected with a certain fashion going. Or is it the other way around,
I cannot really tell anymore. A lot of thoughts that I am not sure are
really connecting, so I am going to add my own from the perspective I
have, maybe the will bring two or three or four people on to the same
wavelength...

	So, there is the baggy fashion, worn by a whole lot of people,
some of who come with big some smiles, some of who come with a stoic
expression, some of who come with snarls, some of who come with a dire
need to make someone feel small at an event that is the "shit". What
I see, is that the fashion is not the point, it is what someone is 
trying to express with their puffy jacket and baggy pants. I doubt
anyone with a smile on their face, someone that is giving some energy
bck to the group which they draw energy from, will come over as a
hardcore bad ass (Take the guy drumming two sunsets ago, he was decked
out, but no one around was looking one bit scared, or unhappy that he
was banging away on the toms). To that party I walked in behind a group
of people who dressed in 'urban' style, yet they made me feel a tad
uncomfortable, cuz I had on a pair of faded blue shorts, my bike shoes
a dark blue top, and my woolen hat. Right, so I walking behind them 
under the trees, and I keep getting these "You just do not know how to
dress" looks... Now I could take these one of a few ways: I could smile
and chuckle (but what am I smiling and chuckling at? That I am better 
than they are cuz I am above all this, I have to look like this?), I
could have gotten pissed off, expressed my rage, and taught them a
lesson (hmm, I doubt that would have done anything but made me feel like
shit two minutes later), I could have done nothing (which in my weak
hearted state, I did), or I could have employed the art of saracsm to 
make fun of these very clothes which, in part of my head, I both did not
like and found quite funny because they are after all, just clothes...
(oops, I am babbling) What I am trying to express, is that there is
a difference in people's attitudes and it can take a hell of a lot of
energy, and will to laugh each time someone attempts exert their trip
on you. (I know it can be done, I lived for six months in a town full
of these people, and I know quite a few around me these days as well).

	I have had experiences much like the one Todd (hope I am 
remembering the correct posts) described and turning to my aggressor
and introducing myself never entered my mind, but after the inital
reaction of fear I had to such a suggest subsided, I realized that is
either the best solution to the problem, or the best way to get yourself
decked for not showing the proper respect to your superior (I am sure
a lot of people who disagree that it would cuz someone to deck me, but
I cannot get it out of my head). Yet, I do have to say I wish people would
take this approach to getting rid of an unwanted overbearing presence 
(not necessarily make the person exerting the overbearing presence go 
away, just make the overbearing presence go away). But this is in part
due to my own insecurities due to a whistle that seems to be a bit loud
when matched against a sound system the size of Sunset's... (ah ha, you
know know who I am....)
	So I am ending this post in a sec. I am hoping I have not been
missing the point of this thread, and misconstruing it as a discussion
about different attitudes and the way those attitudes are expressed. I
will have to say that if it is really about gangsta style fashion popping
up at parties, and this 'fashion' may be evil or even a welcome change,
I have but to smirk and stick my tongue out and go PPPPPTTTTTTHHHHHHBBBBBB...
at I discussion I find entirely silly... Ach, but it is such a livid
discussion, aye?

Maui  has posted a few times attempting to locate the guy who has my 
video projector... I'm posting about it myself now, as she doesn't feel 
like she can help me further.

It's obvious that there are people on this list who know Everett, and I 
do not understand why they don't contact us, or push him to do so. After 
all, it's not like Maui and I are going to throw our hands in the air and 
forget about it... We are going to keep posting and continue hounding 
until the projector is back in my hands. 

Can you you blame me?

Maybe not EXACTLY, but sure, as long as you believe in something, you CAN
make it your destiny.  As long as you believe in your dreams...as long as
you keep dreaming...and visualizing in your head...you are sure to actualize
these dreams.  So, in a sense...to a certain extent dealing with control
over YOURSELF (not the outer environment)...yes, you can control your own
destiny.

An interesting place to visualize and practice your goals for the future
is in lucid dreams... 

What I found paradoxical about that Star Trek episode is that if he went to
the anti-time hole when he was young, why doesn't he expect it to happen
at the 2 times when he's older?  Like, at which time period did this
shifting start to occur with him?  

Well, maybe this should be left to the proper newsgroups...

Just a question (sorry I'm uninformed):


where is the best place to go in SF to buy ambient vinyl (or CD, but vinyl
preferred)?  I have been having a hard time finding much...


been lurking around and would say more but gotta study for a midterm:<



On Fashion:  my sense of fashion is what makes me happy when I wear it:)  I

	Denon has different models. I have the DN-2000F. It's good
	and easy to use, but I don't like the way it has to move in a track
	(a couple of buttons to do fast search, but if your track is 10 
	minutes long and you want to go almost to the end...)
	Anyway, the new one (I don't remember the model) is much more powerful
	(and expensive !) It has a joggle to move in a track and you can
	also jump directly to a point, typing directly the time on a
	numeric keyboard).

	Prices: I paid ~ $900 for the Denon DN-2000F last year. It should cost
	less now and I suppose the one Michael is referring to ( $1000 ) is
	the new one (I tought it was more expensive).
	Denon also have a single version called DN-1000F.
	I got a catalogue from Music Emporium and the carry the DN-2000F, the
	DN-1000F and the Gemini CDs. They also have some Stanton stuff but
	I didn't see the CD player. You may want to call them and check the
	prices: 1-800-648-8460.

not sure if i'd call it 'classier'..i certainly prefer the old-school UK 
hardcore - pianos, vocal samples, the whole nine yards -  but this new 
breakbeat mostly leaves me cold on the dancefloor. i sometimes enjoy 
listening to it, as armchair-techno-type-stuff, but ususally it makes me 
leave the floor....the reason i was so happy is that i've been 
*saturated* with alot of house (which i find boring, not that house is 
boring, but what i've heard lately is) here, and being from the east 
coast rave scene, am used to lots more diversity. therefore the jungle 
element was quite welcome. :) when he spun 'incredible' i was yelling 
'BOOYAKA BOOYAKA' at the top of my lungs. :)

 I was wondering if there were any opinions about the upcoming 
Megatripolis ? I was going to invite a non-raver friend to go
with me to it.

 Also - any suggestions for alternates this Saturday night , if
Megatripolis washes out?

I guess I really meant "it is fundamentally stupid in the context of
gangsta wear". THere's not much range allowed in gangsta wear so it gets
old real fast. Same with grunge. And it is a "uniform". That's what I like
least.

Also, I like colors a lot, and gangsta wear is not very colorful for the
most part (exceptions are always present, e.g. "Cross Colors")...

I don't have any problem with utilitarian "workman" clothing from which
some gangsta wear and some "rave wear" evolved, other than the fact
that I'd like to be paying "workman" prices for that fashion, not "idle
rich" prices... A while back, the SF Examiner magazine had a special on
young SF fashion designers and one group was "designing" this kind  of
"workman" clothing along with "Adidas" inspired fashion. I think it's
pretty ridiculous to call yourself a  designer when all you're doing is
a retread of a has-been. And beyond that, I think calling this retread
a "fashion" is laughable. Wow! cotton, a square-cut shirt, and big
metal buttons. Big f-ing deal. But hey, what would I know, i'm just a
geek and haven't been properly indoctrinated in the fine arts of
marketing.

I agree completely... a culture is made up of individual people so it's a
problem with both. It's also due to mass marketing and easy dissemination
of advertisements in a variety of media. Fashion now "invades" people's
homes and forces a level of conformity and normalization of thought that
we've never had to deal with before.  Even when you're not experiencing
something that is explicitly a commercial, you're dealing with a lot of
subliminal marketing push through endorsements.

The latter. I guess some people wear it as an expression of conformity.

And I enjoy them greatly. But they're not wearing boring cookie-cutter
monochromatic gangsta wear.  Their wearing cool metallic pants, or crazy
psychedelic hats, weird froot-loop backpacks, etc. I luv dat stuff.

The thing to notice is that these folks are not following fashion.
They're leading it. You notice and enjoy them because they don't look
like anything you've seen before.

Guess you haven't been around any suburban high schools lately have you?
Palo Alto High is back in effect, and I've seen what the kids are wearing.
Are you telling me they can buy all that bullshit overpriced baggy-wear and
"grunge fashion" delivering newspapers?

Depends on what fashion you're talking about, don't it? I saw a fashion
magazine recently that had a picture of a button that said "grunge is
ghastly" -- I guess I'd have to agree, thought I don't think much of the
high-society b...matron that was wearing it....

I just can't get with every cycle of attempted anti-fashion becoming
fashionable itself. After punk was passe, it used to be "new wave"...
last year and this year "grunge"... this year and next year
"gangsta"... and the year after that, people will be dressing like me,
yes like me!

Hope I'm not condescending, but: 303 refers to a Roland TB-303, a 
little synth for making basslines that you have undoubtedly heard if you 
have listened to acid/trance/whatever for any length of time.  The sound 
is squelchy and, well, acidic.

A 303-groove is an acid/trance/whatever groove, I guess.

Hi,

I've been trying to set up my Mac to run slip and slip app's
using tia on my netcom account.  I have tia set up correctly
(according to the tia binary anyway) but the Mac hangs every
time I try to start NCSA telnet (to test using a slip app).

Has anyone out there  managed to get this working properly?
If so, would you share info on what the slip settings (Inter-
SLIP, in my case), MacTCP settings (if any), and any other
Mac-voodoo that might be involved?  I'd be very appreciative...
Also, are there known Mac init's, control panels, etc., that don't
work w/ InterSLIP/MacTCP/tia?  If so, maybe I'm running them, so what
are they?

thanks in advance...

This may or may not be relevant...

I was in London a few weeks ago and went to a Megatripolis event there, and
it was easily one of the best raves I have ever been to.  The music was great
the entire night (and I'm usually a pretty harsh critic).  They had a
house/funk room, a hard techno room, an ambient room and a live band room
(where Test Department played).  It was held in a film studio, which meant
that all of the rooms were acoustically isolated from each other.  (You
couldn't heard dance music in the ambient room.)  There was a large outdoor
chill space, they had free water, and they had a room where artists were
selling trippy artowrk.  The promoters obviously cared enough to put on a
very fine production.  (BTW: it cost 10 pounds ($15) to get in.)

The crowd was also especially good.  Although some people were drinking,
there was no negative alcohol vibe.  (This is probably more due to
differences in British and American culture in general, though -- people in
Britain drink to get light-headed and happy, not to get rude and annoying.)
The people were really into it.  It seemed like everyone was having a great
time.  Hardly anyone was standing around.  There was also quite a bit of
interaction on the dancefloor, too.  And the vibe was so warm and natural,
it never even *occurred* to me to question whether or not people were on drugs.

That sounds good and reasonable. If this is done with good intentions,
with no structure or hierarchy, I might even buy in.

But the idyllic situation you describe could easily be subverted by
"happy police" enforcing groupthink, combined with people too lazy to
think for themselves but more than happy to regurgitate some spoon-fed
dogma or "spirituality". Throw some "control freaks" in to lead the
flock and you've got trouble. This has been going on for a long time,
all the way from the early Christians to this summer's Zippy Fiasco...

This kind of crap always happens when you try to get a "movement"
together. That's what makes me wary.

I'd rather have a PLURality of thought and opinions get together and
party in unity, than a bunch of blissed-out sheep bleating "P.L.U.R."
over and over again. The differences between people is what is
interesting; the spiritual/moral outgrowths of the rave or hippy
movements sometimes tend to squelch the differences and enforce a
boring sameness of thought. And I certainly don't want some
prescribed "spirituality" to be a part of the package.

I don't think I'm quite that good, but I would try to prove
something slightly more interesting, were I to bother.

Well, I guess you missed out on the sentence you deleted there.
I already archived it and don't feel like digging it out for
a silly little correction like this, but the deleted material
pointed out that making statements like

"
Fashion should be poked fun at, because it is fundamentally stupid,
unnatural, and poseurish. Even worse is when fashion becomes a uniform,
"

quickly displays the speaker to as dogmatic, closeminded
and frankly rather stupid in the eyes of people who might to
disagree with said speaker.

Hint: saying X is _fundamentally_ Y, unless supportable by the
same logic that allows one to say "Dogs are animals", is the problem
here. If you still don't get it, try plugging in other words, like
"Ravers are fundmentally braindead, fat, and ugly." Doesn't work well,
does it?

You're right, I haven't been in an HS since I stopped attending
several years back. This is completely irrelevent, however, becuase
again, I think you missed the point, the point being that

1) I said "some of us...", which last I checked left plenty of
room in 'the rest' for differences (those being your HS students),

2) what was said was "people.... Otherwise they..." which seems to at
least try to implicate any humans who 'are wearing the clothes', and

3) 2 above is not true, as some people into fashion happen to support
themselves and thier fashion habits.

Is that easier to get down?

a 303 groove i assume would be a metaphor for the roland 303 and the 
sound that it makes...and the groove part would refer to a heavy liking 
and/or trance like state one achieves from this experience...susie (:

The one thing that has bothered me (just a little) about the "PLUR" 
acronym is that it has caught on a little too much like some kind of
prescribed raver code-of-conduct.  Nevertheless, you have to admit that  
it is hard to have people with "a PLURality of thought and opinions get 
together and party in unity" without a certain amount of Peace, Unity & 
Respect.  Love, depending on your definition, doesn't hurt things either.  
Other ideals, like Openmindedness, also come in handy.  I think what you 
are saying is that just believing and preaching these words pales against 
actively experiencing what they are supposed to represent.  This may be 
true, but it doesn't necessarily make the words and acronyms conceptually 
invalid.

I can't speak for hippies, but so far, the only thing ravers around
here seem to be able to agree on is that Sunset is a fun party.  :)

The key thing about the spiritual outgrowth of raving is that it is
an *outgrowth*.  The spirituality that some ravers experience
comes from the EXPERIENCE.  I.e. our actions aren't governed by some 
externally defined ideals, rather, the ideals are realized by our act
of coming together and transcending ourselves on the dancefloor.  

Yes, there is always the danger of overdefining these discovered ideals 
and then trying to *follow* them.  But as long as we can just let go 
of everything, stop worrying about what *should* be while connecting with 
each other and  sharing our energy through music and dance, I think the
special vibe that happens at good raves will remain unforced and sincere.

 Mijo, you got it on! There are good alcahol vibes, good sober vibes, good
E-vibes, everywhere...In Brazil, as in your experience of Britain, there
are people who get euphoric and lower their barriers on a beer or a rum and
coke. Must be the age limit here, creates a sense of awe and anticipation
in teenagers, so when they can drink, it MUST be to excess, and that
conditions them to binges for several years (Frat parties, anyone?).

Carnival is drunken revelry in many latin cultures, sometimes synergized
with ether (Whoosh! Kill da brain!). But the vibe is very much like one of
those raves you walk away smiling ear to ear like felix himself.....

I love that type of clean vibe, too, where drugs are irrelevant. I feel
that way at sunset, and it's great to know that people are enjoying
themselveswith just the vibe in their veins and galen under their
tongue.....
Right on Wertheim!

Lotsa love, 
 Milton and the E-Bee.....

Fingers, Inc "Can You Feel It"  accapella on Trax records 12"

		*** Jack's House ***

In the beginning, there was Jack, and Jack had a groove.
  And from this groove came the grooves of all grooves.
   And while one day viciously throwing down on his box,
Jack boldy declared, "Let there be HOUSE!" and house music was born.
"I am, you see, I AM THE CREATOR!, and this is my house."
 "And, in my house there is ONLY house music."
"But, I am not so selfish because once you enter my house it then
   becomes OUR house, and OUR house music."
And, you see, no one man owns house, because house music
	is a universal language, spoken and understood by all.
You see, house is a feeling that no one can understand really
  unless you're deep into the vibe of house.
House is an uncontrolable desire to jack your body.
	And, as I told you before, this is our house and our house music.
And in every house, you understand, there is a keeper.
			And in this house, the keeper is Jack.
Now some of you who might wonder, who is Jack and what is it that Jack does?
Jack is the one who gives you the power to jack your body.
Jack is the one who gives you the power to do the snake.
Jack is the one who gives you the key to the wiggly worm.
Jack is the one who learns you how to walk your body.
Jack is the one that can bring nations and nations of all
	Jackers together under one house.
You may be black, you may be white, you may be Jew or Gentile.
It don't make a difference in OUR House.
					  And this is fresh.

NPM says "I'd rather have a PLURality of thought and opinions get together
and party in unity, than a bunch of blissed-out sheep bleating "P.L.U.R."
over and over again. The differences between people is what is interesting"

This is one of the things I was trying to get across in my original g-reply
to g-fear.  Are you really tripping hard enough?  And even if you're new to
this particular mindfuck, will you be satisfied in the future?  Its kind of
like the darkside breakbeat(very unhappy jungle) stuff that I almost never
hear spun in this city -- its a different trip, a new flavor.  Hip-hop, goth,
punk, whatever, when its true its vibrant and creative and a communal vibe
exists no matter if it doesn't seem 'happy' to you.   I'm not really jaded, I
LOVE house culture(movement, as Niels points out, implies leaders, direction)
its the most amazing scene I've ever been involved in.  But it hasn't changed
that much since the late 80's and nothing will kill it faster than
stagnation, repetition.  And the best way to get others interested in what
we're doing is to go visit them!  Fashion can be a great way to crossover by
the way.  Take this gangsta stuff, ravers have adopted some of that style so
g's think, hey those guys look kinda like us and that beat is phat,maybe we
could party together.  Same goes for grunnge and several other sub-cultures
ravers sample and recycle.

Just some more thoughts,
phuture

There's a neat thing on the Wired WWW site all about that party that
DeeLite was at down in LA.  When people wrote how bad DeeLite sounded, it kinda
reminded me of working on a concert scene for the Doors movie way back
when.  they just played a tape and Val Kilmer just moved around..the rest
of the band just pretended to play the instruments.  That was because
all the sound was going to be dubbed over in the studio anyway.
Same thing with "Millenium 1999"--it's part of a movie called Strange
Days starring Angela Basset and acting god Ralph Fiennes written and
produced by Jim "Terminator" Cameron.  Juliette Lewis was supposed to be there
as well.  They probably had some really cool scenes during the party and
had to reset stuff and refilm some sequences which would account for the
pauses in the music...

ANYWAY...the URL to the Wired Rest Stop is 
http://www.wired.com/

check it out if you can...it's pretty interesting...like the article says,
it's proably teh first time actors had to PAY to be seen on film!

(the extras at least!)

It is being directed by Mr. Cameron's ex-wife, actually.  Also, I don't
think the bands will actually be in the movie.  They seemed to just be
a draw for a crowd.

Oh, my, this is sounding like it is going to be a hell of a time....

	IS there anyone in the East bay that might have room tfor two 
people? I do have access to a car, but it has been on the blink lately, 
so if worse comes to worse, I hope to find some generous people to sweep 
us away to what sounds like a time not worth missing...

 Hmm.. a buddy said he just got a 303 .. so I prob get that 
sampled in we ek or so.. 
  As for going to the store, the only way I'll go that route is 
if I have a DAT or mini disk recorded.. which don't seem to be 
in my future anytime soon =) ... thanx for the replies...

Wow...  I was being a total space cadet as usual last weekend, 
but somehow I   remembered the name of a bad-ass record, and 
was hoping that someone could point   me in the direction of a 
place to buy it.  Its "The Kali's Dream" from "Jondi   and 
Spesh."  They're an SF based group.  Anyway, if anyone knows 
where to find   it, I'd love a message... And if not, and you 
happen to see it in a store --   pick it up.

Yeah, I've been talking to Kairo who is apparently the main "promoter"
behind sf's megatripolis. The vibe I get from him so far is pretty good.
One thing he mentioned to me is that he wants megatripolis to do "sound
system" nights wherein local soundsystems -- the pacific posse, or the
liquid posse, or the wicked posse -- for example would be featured. The
Friends & Family sound system (as it were :) has been invited to do a night
there. 

In any event, I'm very curious to see how megatripolis unfolds, though, in
truth, I wonder whether there's any real association or basis for
comparison between the sf and the London version...

Kairo certainly seems intent on involving the local community though,
something I cant help but see as positive.

take it easy

Weird, but I was talking about this kind of thing to a friend last night
before I read this thread.  We were talking (a little tongue in cheek) about
the philisophical basis of Schwartznegger movies et al.

As it relates to this thread, in "Total Recall" Arnold asks the mutant leader
Kuwato (?) who is he, and how can he get his identity back.  The mutant
replies, why, what does it mater... "you are defined by your actions..." not
your memories or past.

I think this is fundementally different from Easter thought which doesn't
support redemption in the Judeo-Christian vein.  Eastern thought (or at least
the Japanese Zen thing ) is more that life is a continuum coxisting with a
universal continuum.  The Christain thing is even on one's death bed, one can
"find God" and attain redemption and go to heaven.  It seemed like a raw deal
to me in Sunday school, for those who were always "good."

But the philisophcal point was the only we can define ourselves.  I could go
on (as I did yesterday) but I think the point is clear enough.

        "Total Recall" is based on a Philip K Dick story.  All his stuff
is very good for anyone who wants to explore the outer edges of the meaning
of reality and existence.

To	Awesome Ravers

Internet mail                 Cow Palace "Rave"

I recommend you avoid events like this if you don't want to waste your money and
feel like a cow all night, trying to weed through the crowds and crowds of
people with lousy attitudes (Not EVERYONE, of course).  Just IMHO.

If you've never been to a "Rave" at the Cow Palace, and you have nothing better
to do and a friend to go with who is just as bored, then it might be worth the
undoubtedly "interesting" experience to go.

Interesting, but only in the way that you know you'll never go twice.  I
wouldn't go as far as calling it a nightmare (that depends on you), but "rave"
events held there are certainly not my idea of a good party.

By the way, I base my opinions based on my semi-recent attendence to "World
Groove '94" by Cool World Productions several months ago at the Cow Palace.

It was, <ahem>, interesting.  ...yet somehow not as interesting as the flyer
overtly suggested (demanded?) I believe.

Does anyone know anything about this event happening this saturday?
With how big it seems like it is going to be, I'm suprised there's
been no mention of anything about it yet.
I mean... the cow palace...   eeks.
That's a quite a place for a rave.
Tickets through BASS... welll...
A billion things going on.
anyone?

It's nice to hear that some folx aren't down on alcohol for poor reasons.
After all, I drink alcohol, and I'm not rude or abusive because of it  :)

I think that the reason so many kids drink might be because it's easy to 
obtain...

I am also fully cognizant of the fact that alcohol can really mess you up --
but I am really tired of this puritanical tendency that is exhibited in 
"the scene", and on this list. Alcohol doesn't have to be nasty, mean, 
violent, and coppin' a 'tude.

Thanks for reading this :) :) :)

I've heard this term before but I could never figure what elements make 
up deep house.  Can someone help?

Galen Just received a call from the police revoking his permit.

This was due to an incedent which took place last Sunday.
A well known raver took too many drugs and had to be taken away in shackles.

First off!!   The info number has changed...  The new number: 415-487-5426
should give out the directions.

DJ's - Rhion,  Barnes, Tracey,  Nate,  DJ Unknown - trance in the evening,  
and house in the morning.   Plus a live Acid Jazz band. 

Ambient cabin... Mark,  and Allan from Ameba plus special guests plus

I haven't really heard these DJ's,  so don't know how good they are,   but
I am always open for new changes in the rave scene,  and the price to

check it out.     

If this number doesn't check out,   please let me know,  and I'll personally
Email the directions.    I'm planning on attending if I can get a couple
of riders to share the gas.

NOTICE:   Riders needed to go with me to the Clear Lake rave...    Call me
at 415-381-5847 if you want to go.     I live in Mill Valley,    but planning
on getting into the SF (Haight area) and can meet you at the Horshoe Cafe
or some other place if anyone wants a ride.    Don't know if I'm going
with a friend or taking the trek myself.     NOTE:  my car is small,  so
can take only 3 people (Perhaps 4 if you don't mind getting squished).

Cheers

What's the basis for revoking the permit, and under whose authority
was it revoked? What was the due process?

Who do I (and 3000 other ravers) call to complain? Let's ALL complain.
Stuff like that gets results.

I happen to agree. I've been to several events where alcohol was sold
and some have had very good vibes (fond examples: F&FII & III). And boy
when you've busted your butt for hours throwing or attending a party,
an ice cold beer at 4am is nearly orgasmic.

I think it's more a function of the crowd than a function of the
intoxicant. Throw in a bunch of (kids/oldpeople/gangstas/businesspeople/
lovechildren/urbs/suburbs/hillbillies/anyone) with "I don't like you."
attitudes, and the party is going to suck. And in this case, alcohol
will probably make it worse (compare to E).

Now start with a crowd of people mostly wanting to share and have fun,
and the party flies, alcohol or no.

People that want to put a lot of energy into discouraging certain
substances should instead spend that energy reaching out to people at
parties and fostering a positive attitude.  I've never ceased to be
amazed at how much energy one person can catalyze at a party by
something simple like handing out blo-pops and talking with people.
Reaching out to people works. It's one of the things that made me feel
at home at my first rave, and it's something I believe in doing at the
parties I help promote.

Just a heads up that following up discussion here with a little energy
out there will make a huge difference in people's experiences.

:)

Galen seemed to understand why the cops revoked the permit
I think He is just dissappointed that it was one of the family who 
screwed up. We screwed it up for ourselves basically.

AS for the details of the incident,

There are many drugs which if you take too much and flail around hurting 
yourself and others. Police and ambulance were appearently needed, Martin 
O'brien appearently spent a good effort at the talk down to no avail and 
the sunset people are very appreciative of this attempt(Martin has 
probably had to do this before).

I was not there so if anyone else can add...i have no other info

Haven't gone on line for awhile now so I missed most of the fashion
thread... but I did want to say that when I was up in Portland this
summer I spent my last night at a lavish great fashion show put on by
the local scenesters - great drunken caravan of wonderful sexy and fun
fashions - everything from space suits to bunny outfits, colored alcohol,
crazy dancing, and even superman! Tres cool! I wish it could happen here....
Maybe?

Yes, in once sense we had to pay $10 to be an extra.  But otherwise this is a
breif stort of what I GOT for only $10.

I arrived at the site at about 9:15, parked at the free parking lot that was
printed on my ticket.  Then I went the the enterence which was at 3rd and
flower not 4th and flower and waited for 5 to 10 minutes in line. 

Now I am inside and this guy point to a sign that says "free food and drinks
with ticket stub".  My friends and I skipped dinner so we were stoked.  I had
a turkey sandwich, a hot dog and washed it down with an O'Douls non-alch beer
all for free.  We grabbed a few bottle of evian and walked into the tech area
where we play some cd-rom and cool vr games.  even our very own AOL had a
booth there.  

Anyway we walked toward a huge video screen where a small system was playing
some wicked trance.  But we explored more and went to the main system which
was at 5th and flower.  there they had another Huge video screen.  At one
point they had a mind melting video playing but the rest of the time is
simply displayed "2000" real big.  The confetti falling was AMAZING, it
filled up the sky so much you couldn't figure out where it started or ended.

We found a bunch of happy people at the sound stacks farthest away from the
stage.  we hung out here for a while and loved the beats.  The sound wasn't
very loud unless you stood inside  the area that the six different stacks
pointed towards.  then it was great.  The main dance area looked like it only
had enough space for 6 or 8 thousand to enjoy the sound but there was so many
other places to check out, a good flow maintained.  we went to the top of the
bonavenute hotel, and from the resturant we could look down at the five block
rave.  I heard there was 14,000 people, from up there it looked like even
more.  

Then we hung out to the left of the stage in this cool area with palm trees.
 the sound wasn't very loud here, but that turned out good because alot of
people chilled out here.  they had free water also in this area which was
great.

oops dinners ready, gotta go but it was a good trip. see ya.

To all you SFRavers planning to attend Megatripolus this weekend...   We
are trying to have a few tables set up for those folks interested in exchanging
PGP keys,  signing keys,  etc.    What we need are people who would be willing
to bring a Mac Classic,  or portable so that Mac versions of PGP can be copied
out and given to those that need it.

Secure rooms will be available for those folks who won't want to stay at
the table all night and watch their equipment.    

See Ya all there....

Some additional info that came my way...

It turns out that this dude (Who shall be nameless) who freaked out at the
last Sunset,  also owned the VMail for Nocturnal Persuit.    What this means,
is that the thousand or more flyers that Dan handed out on Nocturnal Persuit
that gave the info number is not going to be updated in time for Nocturnal 
persuit (NP).  Thus was the reason why I gave out the new number earlier.

This is a very bad bummer for those folks putting on the party,  because of
all those folks that got the flyer.    A large search is underway to locate 
this dude so that he can update the Info for NP.

If anyone knows this person,   please let me know,  so we cen get him to
update the number.    

Apparently,  he was taken to the hospital,  and eventually released.   Some
people have reported to have seen him on the Haight,   but no word yet on
if he's been found.    I suspect that he is laying low (Much to the regret
to those folks putting on NP).

More later...

It seems odd that it took them this long to react. I barely noticed the
incident on Sun. and the party certainly continued well after the ambulance
came and went. All I know about the incident itself are unconfirmed rumours
which would serve no purpose by repeating. I wonder what the conditions of
the permit were that they can revoke it so arbitrarily?

The basis for the police advising him not to have the party was last week
a few people ate too much acid and freaked out (took off clothes, rolling
on the rocks in the bay, etc) Somebody called the cops (who have been very
tolerant so far) and they came saw the obvious signs of  drug use and
told Galen that things were getting a little out of hand and that the parties
would have to stop.

Sunset is canceled for this week but will go on next week 8/9 at a different
location. I don't really know where else they will be able to "get away" with
playing loud music for 700 freaky people but I'll be looking forward to it.

I think the police basicaly told Galen that if they continue doing the
party the Berkely PD will have an obligation to be on hand to make
sure that there is no drug use/abuse around. That would not make 
for a good vibe if suddenly the police arived and started busting people.

Sunset has almost reached Full Moon proportions and you know
all the problems that arise when you get over 500 people outdoors
on public land. I think it is a good idea to let things cool down with
the Berkely Marina spot so it dosen't go the way of Bonny Doon and
so we can use it in the future. Anyways a change of scenery might be
nice. Originaly Sunset was going to be held at many locations around
the bay but they stuck with the Berkely Marina because it worked out
so well.

Hi y'all (sic)

I know it's a drag when somebody gets greedy or whatever and imbibes
too much, causing problems for themselves and others, *but*, I'd be
*surprised* to find that among those who do *anything* there are people
who have *never* made the mistake of taking too much of something [the
*what* doesn't really matter, too much of anything can be a drag].

While this may have shut down a party, I think it's good to remember
that many of us have been there and some of us will likely be there
again, at some point in our lives...let's not let society's attitude
about intoxication make us forget that the person afflicted and their
health/safety/comfort is *more* important than partying whether the
cops got called or not.  I doubt that the person involved is not clear
on the concept that they made a mistake, so let's not get down on 'em
too hard whoever they might be.  Unless this person does this repeatedly
[as in regularly, has been spoken to and still doesn't do anything],
they deserve a little sympathy and support and could probably use it now
more than ever.

Family or not, I personally hope he/she recovers quicky and fully
as I trust that the rest of us will find another place to rave...

as for the cops, it's high time we got 'em off our case for these
types of offenses, and I sure hope y'all (sic) VOTE!!!!

sermon over

i'm out...

I am sad about this but I don't think we need to be 
knocking ourselves or the unfortunate person who had 
this accident.  People make mistakes.  

Sunset is fragile
simple open fun

moments matter
take it home

It is not, i repeat, over. Mijos, it can go on elsewhere, or we can reclaim
the site by bitching to the cops and the papers, but WE OWE GALEN OUR
EFFEORTS after all of his to put on this consistantly excellent party.
To give up is selfish and spoiled. 

This party has been my best time all summer long, and my main reason to
keep sober. Most people i knew at sunset were either sober or had a little
bowl and that wuz it. That the police should shut down the CLEANEST party
over one person's drug problem is tragic and ironic.

I wonder if they would shut down a Bears game if I fried balls and lost it
in the stands?

At this point, if Galen still wants the Marina (it is getting cold) he
should ask for our help. If he needs it to relocate, he should get it. This
is the chance for everyone in "the scene" to prove that as this year's vibe
recovered, we have come together stronger than last year and are willing to
perpetuate the love.

deep house originally meant "well-produced" as opposed to rawer garage 
house.  Chicago, New York, Detroit and even parts of Europe (bust mostly 
American) are good cities for it.  Roots in disco, funk, jazz, gospel, soul, 
R&B.  Huge basslines, four-on-the-floor beats, crisp high hats, pianos, 
horns, guitar, echos, 
sampled and chopped vocals, as well as diva type singing.  Often tales of 
love lost and found, surviving through hard times, devotional or 
spiritual themes, and just plain getting down.
  For me, deep is a feeling or tone certain house tracks have.  Space in 
the mix seems as important as the actual music.  Sometimes the most 
minimalist tracks trance me out the most; that's deep house.  Mark Farrina 
plays the deepest house I've ever heard and Terrence Parker is my favorite 
producer.

love,
whitsitt

I'm glad to hear others say they think Kairo's doing something positive 
-- I don't know him that well, but Susan likes him. He's done some pretty 
trippy banners n'stuff. It should be a fun party -- I plan on going to it....

Huh?  People have already been busted at sunset, and I always went there
knowing full well that undercover police were watching everyone.  It
didn't seem to dim the vibe much.

Hey, this is Ann here at Komotion,  I was just talking to this woman who
wants to know if there's a way for her to find out about various raves
other than the internet... Like a phone number or a mailing list. If there
is such a thing or anybody has any suggestions could you let me know?
Thanks, and Cheers! from Komotion!

Hello Folks -

 I see that there's a weekly called Free Fall at 60 6th street on
Saturdays. Does it have similar music to the SPAZ events that were
there? Maybe I'll check it out before Megatripolis...

	To the yonder hills (Hmm, except those houses up there are all 
expensive and lived in by people who like their quiet little community... 
Probably best not to disturb them.... But still, There are a lot of nice 
places nestled in the Berkeley/Oakland hills which when me and some 
friends were going out into the woods scouting for spots, seemed to be 
workable.

Kinda sorta; Susan spun consecutive weeks at both, and her sets *were* 
different, but not radically so. A lot of the same people were at both 
parties :)

I'd say it depends on the DJ's. Free Fall is a bit more "queer 
environment", but not in the ass-grabbing sense at all. The guy putting 
it on is quite nice, and the scary creep that runs the door when SPAZ is 
there was nowhere to be found (whew!)

I'll see you at Metripolis (Metripolus?)

*hugs*
