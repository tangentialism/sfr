JAN KRUEGER

It's 1995 in D=FCsseldorf - Jan's hometown - and he's consumed by the
Music of Labels like M-Plant, Relief, Sound Signature, Planet E and
Phono. Jan owes his first steps to present his record selection (to
those other than his lovely dog and cat) to a very good friend who
holds a residency at one of the best underground clubs for electronic
music, an old wine cellar located in Wuppertal, near D=FCsseldorf. Here
he had the pleasure to play alongside artists who had inspired him
since the early nineties. In short - this is the precise starting
point of a never ending story fuelled by love for the music.

In 1996, Jan started to work for a record store and focused on hosting
his own parties starring international guests like Daniel Bell,
Matthew Herbert, Ata and Steve Bug. Around the same time, he met the
young and promising producer Daze Maxim. Both clicked right away and
found out that they have a quite similar interest in electronic music.
Both decided to start some excursions in Maxim's backroom studio to
produce deep and minimal house tracks, which were finally released on
Matthias Tanzmann's Moon Harbour Recordings in 2001.

Three years later, Jan determined after sleepless nights to move away
from D=FCsseldorf and all his friends in order to start a new chapter in
Hamburg. Because of his long friendship to the staff of Germany's
leading distribution company Word and Sound, it was a logical step to
take on a position as sales manager there. As a consequence of all
this, it wasn't long before he proposed to Daze that they set up a
platform for him and friends to release music. Hello?Repeat was born.

As a DJ, Jan is adept in the late night hours, playing his highly
individual and addictive mixture of deep house, minimal, and techno
with rough edges, always focused on the dance floor. Today Jan lives
in Berlin and holds a residency at Panoramabar and Watergate and plays
ocnsiderably abroad to represent the high quality sound of
Hello?Repeat.

DAVE AJU

San Francisco native Dave Aju has been producing and performing his
unique brand of electronic dance music for nearly a decade. He seasons
traditional elements of house and techno with a blend of outside
musical influences, notably free jazz and p-funk, a low-slung
aesthetic clearly rooted in hip-hop, and an organic sonic approach
akin to Musique Concr=E9te. The result is a consistently fresh and
expressive sound, varying from raw and percussive to deep and melodic,
that is favored by an ever-increasing number of listeners, dancers,
DJs, and producers around the world. His in demand status has taken
him from Moscow to Mexico City, the highly-respected MUTEK Festival,
and has garnered support from a who's-who of forward-thinking peers,
from hometown heroes Sutekh and Kit Clayton to the illustrious Matthew
Herbert, who has recently commissioned Aju to release material on his
Accidental label. His recent debut full-length, Open Wide, is
currently causing a stir in the electronic music community with it's
bold diversity of musical styles and the strict but effective use of
only his mouth to construct it.

Subject: [sfraves] NRR: Funny news (spoof) video of a harvest's destruction

This is a spoof of a BBC news reporting who's standing next to piles of 
street drugs (marijuana and coca leaves) and getting stoned while doing 
it.

Oh wow,

haha,

I was wondering if anyone was using this list anymore, I just resubbed like 
last weds, to see what was up. Kinda almost felt a lil sad when I went to 
the hyperreal site and saw nothing had changed since like '06.

Are people still using it ? Is there some sort of weird delay with messages 
? Last time I was here, I was getting a ton more messages than I am now.

shit I even subbed to some ravelinks site to see what was up. . .

mann I'm so out of touch hehe. . .

take care

haha

Geri Dahl? Don't remember tussin. . .

Stonkin sounds fun. . .I could go for a lil stonkin. . . and I've already 
been cooking down rockstars for years now (but I quit smoking them outta 
lightbulbs, mostly cuz theyre pretty much all cfl's now).

hey, theres a pho restaraunt down the street from my house. . .I was 
wondering what they did in there. . .hmmm. . . I remember when that pho 
owner went to a chiropractic college and started a practice years ago. huh, 
guess she should've known that stonkin in the back of her pho house would 
have been better. I should go see her later.

There isn't some type of secret stonk handshake is there? i mean, if I ask 
her if I can stonk in the back of her pho house and she grabs my balls and 
slaps me in the face. . .does that mean yes, or no?

wow, complicated stuff. . .

: )

Wow, what's next...  A comeback post from Geri or maybe Mr. Tussin?  lol.

Aryck, these days, raves are illegal so we all pretty much just go to 
parties, and many enjoy the new trend in all-night revelry, "Stonks". 
Stonks are a lot like raves used to be, but they start at 9:30 and go 'til 
5:30am, instead of 10-6.  And instead of doing loads of drugs, people 
instead cook down energy drinks and snort them.  The music is generally soft 
rock, and the venues are almost always the kitchens of pho restaurants.

Stonk on!

Wow, what's next...  A comeback post from Geri or maybe Mr. Tussin?  lol.

Aryck, these days, raves are illegal so we all pretty much just go to parti=
es,
and many enjoy the new trend in all-night revelry, "Stonks".  Stonks
are a lot like raves used to be, but they start at 9:30 and go 'til 5:30am,
instead of 10-6.  And instead of doing loads of drugs, people instead cook =
down
energy drinks and snort them.  The music is generally soft rock, and the ve=
nues
are almost always the kitchens of pho restaurants.

Stonk on!

We will burn them, print whatever artwork you want on them, put them in white paper sleeves, and mail you the final product.

Please see:  http://www.cutefangmedia.com for more details.

Thank you!
Phillip

So folks, Muchthump has been quiet lately, taking a break, dealing with the
rest of our lives.

Due to the new world order, recession, whatever you wanna call it, I have
decided to let the warehouse go back to the void whence it came.  Before I
do, I want to have one last underground show!   No, MuchThump is not going
away for good.  Just time to hibernate, regroup and re-emerge later this
year closer to summer at a new venue!  Come celebrate with us for one last
get together to close the circle we opened almost 2 years ago.  Its been a
wild and crazy ride here at the warehouse we all know and love.  You should
remember where it is, if you don't, drop me a line to RSVP and I will put
out an info line with directions tomorrow about 6PM.


SATURDAY JANUARY 10th.  Thats today!  We are starting a little earlier,
music starts at 9PM.   This is gonna be one last friends and family show.
We got some great artists who have agreed last minute to come throw down
some love for your ears.
Donation rates to get in!
Before 10PM  We're asking $5!  C'mon, how could you refuse that?  Got to get
it started somehow:)
Between 10-12am, we're asking $10.  Still fair to see these great acts that
get more at clubs, so come see them up close and personal.
After Midnight, we would appreciate $15.  We know why you are here, you know
we know, so kick down!  All proceeds go directly to the artists.  They gotta
eat too you know:)

Gonna have us some incredible hip hop to go along with our wonderful dj's.

We got Foreign Legion with Prozack Turner.  Check out his Youtube stuff
http://www.youtube.com/user/prozackturner
Hungerstrikerecords.com and http://www.myspace.com/foreignlegion

Azeem with Stretch www.youtube.com/user/OaklynRecs

Audionista!   http://www.myspace.com/analyze1022
She has been a staple of the MuchThump world since near the beginning.
Beautiful as she is talented, come shake your booty to this girls funky
beats!

DJ Inexplicable   www.myspace.com/djinexplicable  Another foundation of the
MuchThump sound and vibe.

Syzygy  www.myspace.com/syzygybeatbox
This is a world class beat boxer, not to be missed!!


Fernando Tarango   www.myspace.com/fernandotarango
A new addition to the MuchThump Factory family circle.  What great party
doesn't start with some awesom acoustical music and singing?
We also got some other talent showing up.  Timeslots and who to be announced
later, but here are a few worth mentioning:)

Sheztek
P-Dub
Influence

I love you all, come celebrate with us.

Directions:

I-980, take the Jackson St. Exit.  Make a right turn at the light (Jackson
St.), then make next right at 4th St. The Muchthump Factory will be on the

Coming from East Bay.  If you are south of Oakland, take I-880 north, get
off Oak st. Exit downtown.  Take left at the light (Oak ST.) and then make

Eclektronik Groove w/ Holt Sorenson - Mon 9AM-12PM Pacific/US
--------------------------------------------------------------

Holt will be hosting J Funk and Dru Deep.

Having Fun is not only DJ/Producer J Funk's first release on Jump
recordings it is also an accurate description of what he is doing at
any given time. Always armed with a big smile and hearty laugh this
San Jose based artist has learned to channel his good vibe mentality
into infectious house music. A DJ since the mid-nineties J-Funk paid
his dues spinning everything from high-energy to hip-hop at house
parties, school dances,and clubs. Inspired by House legends such as
Garth and Mark Farina, in 2002 J-Funk decided to take on the roll of
DJ/Producer full time. As his name would suggest J-Funk has been
heavily influenced by the funky grooves of seventies Disco and R&B
as well as the more contemporary funk of Bay Area artists such as
Too Short and Digital Underground. His extensive mobile DJ and club
experience have given him a keen sense of what will get the party
people moving and according to J-Funk "that's what it's all about ".

Dru Deep plays records, make beats, and designs designs designs. Dru
has been playing records since he was a young lad. House is Dru's #1
love. With all the diiferent styles nowadays he hates to label
himself as "just a house DJ". He plays oldschool hip hop, disco,
electro--versatile is Dru's middle name.

Epiphany of Sound with J.C. - Th 9AM-12PM Pacific/US
----------------------------------------------------

After 14 years, DJ J.C.'s techno/house/electronica showcase has
garnered much attention and devotion. Like most folks at Stanford's
radio station, he's a volunteer, proving that his motivation isn't
a paycheck; it's his passion to share his interest in one of music's
most eclectic genres. With his conversational style, inclusion of
producers and musicians from both the local & international scene,
and his stewardship of the station's 24-hour marathons during
Solstices and Equinoxes, it's no wonder that DJ J.C has made a
connection with listeners in a very crowded market. Catch his live
broadcasts or listen to the previous week's program at underheard.org.

J.C. will email this week if he has an update on any guests.

Thanks for your support!!!

The moon rise was amazing. Only hung out for a half an hour but it was  
quite the party.. Lots of happy people, good music, and motorcycle  
tricksters. Lest we forget the donut drag racing!

were gonna unhook the sound last... Hello 2day... as soon as he said that,

Cut to 5 days later, Wednsday night, Raf finally called me back after I
like had something w/ DJs & stuff, then not 'cause I ain't heard from him
in like 5 days,  but apparently he still wanted to do it... so within'
like 72 hours, alota emails, phonecalls, not having a line up, having a
line up, then not having a line, then getting overbooked, cleaning up,
moving stuff, & a yummy sushi dinner... we had the party!

But like yeah... we were totally cutting it to like the mondo last minute

soooo much good energy, & yeah... it was a mondo yummy time!!  I mean.. It

it was!!!

I mean... it was like a hip hop & dance music thing which is kinda hard to

Subject: [sfraves] turntable tune up help

My decks are 13 years old and in dire need of a tune up.  One of my rca
cables just shorted, the pitch floats a bit, and I've got some lights out.
Anyone know a shop in SF that does a good job on 1200s?

Subject: [sfraves] BSP - PULSE - 01/30/09 - a new SF monthly event!!

Pulse returns on Friday January 30th at an amazing new venue in
San Francisco. We'll be rockin' it at the newly remodeled
Paradise Lounge at 11th and Folsom. To kick things off we've
got an irresistibly killer lineup that you won't want to miss!
And best of all, we've reevaluated our mission and decided to
dedicate our efforts to helping the greater Bay Area community
by donating all proceeds to a local charity each month. Our
first beneficiary is A Safe Place, an Oakland-based
organization which assists victims of domestic violence by
providing support services, advocacy, education, shelter and
counseling.

Peep their site: www.asafeplacedvs.org

Our goal is to raise a minimum $2K, so please join us and help
create that warm, vibey underground atmosphere that only a room
chock full of FnFers can, while helping those less fortunate
than ourselves. We've got house and techno downstairs and
breaks upstairs, so hopefully there's something for everyone to
enjoy. =)

May 2009 be a year of joy and positive change for everyone,

The Pulse Crew

Subject: [sfraves] BSP: Alpha Beats - Friday 1/23 @ DNA - Doc Martin / Sunshine Jones / Jeno / Syd Gris / Eric Sharp / The Fingermonsters

Friday, January 23rd

Rock It Science and Prismatic present:

Alpha Beats: A is for Alien

The creators of Tonal, SF's highly acclaimed color themed warehouse party
series, take you to the next level with Alpha Beats.  Combining their knack
for booking insanely diverse and exciting lineups, bringing together a
killer crowd that goes berzerk on the dance floor, transforming spaces into
themed experiences, and building a party that goes way beyond one night,
Rock It Science and Prismatic invite you to experience the launch of their
new event series Alpha Beats.  For the letter A, Alpha Beats brings you an
outer worldly Alien experience at DNA Lounge, taking you to Outer Space with
some of the West Coast's most influential pioneers and to Inner Space with
front edge trail blazers of the next generation. 

Outer Space:

DOC MARTIN (Sublevel, LA)

One of the world's favorite DJs, Doc Martin hardly needs an introduction.
Beginning his mission on the decks back in the summer of 1986, his focus on
house music from the land of funk and disco was triggered while playing the
club and warehouse scene in San Francisco during the late '80s and 90's. As
one of the major players in laying the foundations of a strong West Coast
dance scene, Doc has always been a master of mixing the crowd with the
music.

SUNSHINE JONES (King Street, Treehouse Muzique, Sunday Soul, Imperial Dub,
Dubtribe Sound System)

Founding member of Dubtribe Sound System, producer of classics such as "Do
It Now" and "Mother Earth" for labels like Guidance, King Street, Defected,
and Imperial DUB, Sunshine Jones continues to pioneer, produce, and perform
live/DJ sets all over the world.  His passion for improvisation, dance, and
devotion to deepness send him and his dance floors out among the stars
forever.

JENO (Back2Back, Noise From the Void)

After heading to San Francisco in the early 90's, Jeno began the now
legendary 'Full Moon' parties with the infamous Wicked crew. The friendly
vibe and hedonistic atmosphere found at these free outdoor events attracted
a large and diverse crowd of people, setting the tone for the future of the
electronic dance music scene in Northern California.  He has now become one
of most loved and sought after dj's in the United States.

DRUMS BY XAVIER (Remedy)

One of the founders of Remedy, Xavier's skills on the drums were a mainstay
for many years during Remedy's long running Friday night weekly at DNA
Lounge.

Inner Space:

SYD GRIS (Opel, Opulent Temple)

Syd Gris has been called a Renaissance man of the West Coast scene, and with
good reason.  Founding Opel Productions, Opulent Temple, and being heavily
involved in SF's Lovefest event are merely the tip of the ice berg; Syd is
one of the West Coast's top talents, consistently being voted in the Top 10
San Francisco Dream Team poll, and playing the biggest events in California.

ERIC SHARP (Rock It Science, Flavor Group)

Eric Sharp's ascent to the forefront of dance music can only be described as
meteoric. From working countless dance floors into frenzies at clubs, bars,
and parties across the US and the globe to producing some of San Francisco's
most epic parties with his crew (and soon to be music label) Rock It
Science, Eric's seemingly endless energy and dedication to electronic music
is simply contagious.

THE FINGERMONSTERS (Monsta Music)

The Fingermonsters consist of Andrew Phelan, George Cochrane, Cubik, and
Shawn Allen.  Their production and Monsta Music label has been creating
quite a buzz recently, garnering support from some of the biggest DJs in the
world.   Their live PA is a site to behold, with all four members freaking
out together onstage on a variety of synths, drum machines, laptops, and
general insanity.

I don't know if I am going to have a babysitter in time, but this looks like a good one!

Anyone been to DNA recently?  Haven't been for a large number of years now.

"What is appealing is the idea
of attaining the unattainable and learning from it. Once you obtain a
fantasy it becomes a reality, and that reality is not as exciting as
your fantasy. Through the fantasies you learn to appreciate your own
realities."
--Ricardo Montalban

"But what is the greatest evil? If you are going to
epitomize evil, what is it? Is it the bomb? The greatest evil that one
has to fight constantly, every minute of the day until one dies, is the
worse part of oneself."
--Patrick McGoohan

Subject: [sfraves] [bsp] Sunday! AFTERGLOW: an evening of mellow electronics.

AFTERGLOW was conceived as a chance to wind down after a long weekend
by listening to some chill music and having a few drinks with friends.  The
idea is to allow some of SF's most talented and multi-faceted dance music
DJ's an opportunity to dig deeper into their collections and play music they
wouldn't be able to in a club setting. Anything's game, from ambient to dub
techno, trip-hop, idm, atmospheric drum n bass,  downtempo, future jazz,
deep house and beyond.

_______________________________________________________________


This Sunday, January 18th will be our debut event and features the
relaxing and heady musical stylings of the one and only:

MIKE BEE  (Amoeba Records . KUSF . XLR8R)

I keep forgetting to post this... But the fabulous Dave Pezzner of  
Jacob London is going to be dropping the heat tonight at Phonic@ the  
end up. Dave has been producing some amazing tech house and techno up

Subject: [sfraves] Bfp - pezzner live @ phonic, tonight! 

I keep forgetting to post this... But the fabulous Dave Pezzner of Jacob London is going to be dropping the heat tonight at Phonic@ the end up. Dave has been producing some amazing tech house and techno up there in Seattle, and we're all in for a treat.

Don't sleep!

R A Y presents:

F A K T I O N : P A X A H A U : keeping the dance cult faith

Friday, 23 January 2009
JOHN JOHR
RICH KORACH
live webcast via DEFSF:Radio Integrated

For over 10 years, the legendary Paxahau name has been synonymous with
Detroit's electronic music scene.  Defying classification, neither
house nor techno and yet combining aspects of both, the artists of this
label continue to capture the attention and spirit of electronic dance.
In recognition of its contributions, Paxahau is *the* producer of DEMF,
bringing a world-class festival to Detroit.

RICH KORACH has relocated his base of operations here to the West Coast
and begins to add in the distinctive influences of San Francisco's own
unique style.  And, who else would a headliner as prominent as Korach open
for, but his own label-mate, JOHN JOHR!  John's style, like colleague and
good friend Rich, brings its own unique flavor to the mix, showing origins
in harder tech-house, Detroit and Chicago deep house and many others,
but goes in a direction that can only be described as John's own.

This is Johr's first-ever SF appearance and his only one scheduled so far,
so arriving early to catch the stylings of Korach is recommended!

Until then, enjoy these mixes, which demonstrate both the style and clear
comradery these paxaresidents share (Note that Rich called this late-2007
set "the deep mix" and John called his mid-2008 set "the deeper mix").

Subject: [sfraves] BSP: Alpha Beats this Friday - visuals by Viberation just added!

Friday, January 23rd

Rock It Science and Prismatic present:

Alpha Beats: A is for Alien

The creators of Tonal, SF's highly acclaimed color themed warehouse party
series, take you to the next level with Alpha Beats.  Combining their knack
for booking insanely diverse and exciting lineups, bringing together a
killer crowd that goes berzerk on the dance floor, transforming spaces into
themed experiences, and building a party that goes way beyond one night,
Rock It Science and Prismatic invite you to experience the launch of their
new event series Alpha Beats.  For the letter A, Alpha Beats brings you an
outer worldly Alien experience at DNA Lounge, taking you to Outer Space with
some of the West Coast's most influential pioneers and to Inner Space with
front edge trail blazers of the next generation. 

Environment:

DNA Lounge will be transformed into a haven for Alien space dwellers.  The
Main Room will be themed Outer Space (think planets, stars, supernovas) and
will be powered by visuals from Viberation alongside one of the most
sophisticated lighting displays in San Francisco.  Upstairs will be themed
Inner Space and is being transformed into a Space Station by the multi
talented Mistress of Decor Jamie Luv.

Outer Space (Main Room):

DOC MARTIN (Sublevel, LA)

One of the world's favorite DJs, Doc Martin hardly needs an introduction.
Beginning his mission on the decks back in the summer of 1986, his focus on
house music from the land of funk and disco was triggered while playing the
club and warehouse scene in San Francisco during the late '80s and 90's. As
one of the major players in laying the foundations of a strong West Coast
dance scene, Doc has always been a master of mixing the crowd with the
music.

SUNSHINE JONES (King Street, Treehouse Muzique, Sunday Soul, Imperial Dub,
Dubtribe Sound System)

Founding member of Dubtribe Sound System, producer of classics such as "Do
It Now" and "Mother Earth" for labels like Guidance, King Street, Defected,
and Imperial DUB, Sunshine Jones continues to pioneer, produce, and perform
live/DJ sets all over the world.  His passion for improvisation, dance, and
devotion to deepness send him and his dance floors out among the stars
forever.

JENO (Back2Back, Noise From the Void)

After heading to San Francisco in the early 90's, Jeno began the now
legendary 'Full Moon' parties with the infamous Wicked crew. The friendly
vibe and hedonistic atmosphere found at these free outdoor events attracted
a large and diverse crowd of people, setting the tone for the future of the
electronic dance music scene in Northern California.  He has now become one
of most loved and sought after dj's in the United States.

DRUMS BY XAVIER (Remedy)

One of the founders of Remedy, Xavier's skills on the drums were a mainstay
for many years during Remedy's long running Friday night weekly at DNA
Lounge.

Inner Space (Upstairs):

SYD GRIS (Opel, Opulent Temple)

Syd Gris has been called a Renaissance man of the West Coast scene, and with
good reason.  Founding Opel Productions, Opulent Temple, and being heavily
involved in SF's Lovefest event are merely the tip of the ice berg; Syd is
one of the West Coast's top talents, consistently being voted in the Top 10
San Francisco Dream Team poll, and playing the biggest events in California.

ERIC SHARP (Rock It Science, Flavor Group)

Eric Sharp's ascent to the forefront of dance music can only be described as
meteoric. From working countless dance floors into frenzies at clubs, bars,
and parties across the US and the globe to producing some of San Francisco's
most epic parties with his crew (and soon to be music label) Rock It
Science, Eric's seemingly endless energy and dedication to electronic music
is simply contagious.

THE FINGERMONSTERS (Monsta Music)

The Fingermonsters consist of Andrew Phelan, George Cochrane, Cubik, and
Shawn Allen.  Their production and Monsta Music label has been creating
quite a buzz recently, garnering support from some of the biggest DJs in the
world.   Their live PA is a site to behold, with all four members freaking
out together onstage on a variety of synths, drum machines, laptops, and
general insanity.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Strategik renegade?

being a part of the Strategik family, you'd think i'd now about it.
but like the forgotten stepchild, i have no clue as to what's going on.

Besides, even if something were going on, I'd be playing hookie with a 
beautiful woman instead (as it's Terri & my 15 YEAR anniversary this 
Wed/Thurs - & to celebrate I got us 3 nights at a B&B in Bodega Bay.  oh 
YUMMY! )

I do believe there's something going on with Strategik on Jan. 30.  At least 
that's the next one I'll be at.  I don't see the info posted on the homepage 
http://www.strategiksf.com site, but found an online flyer elsewhere and 
have been promoting it through my own channels.  I suggest those of you who 
have questions regarding Strategik events post up  your inquires from there 
site directly (as i don't think many, if any besides me & maybe another or 
two, are subbed to sfr)

have a good week everyone!

being a part of the Strategik family, you'd think i'd now about it.
but like the forgotten stepchild, i have no clue as to what's going on.

Besides, even if something were going on, I'd be playing hookie with a beautiful woman instead (as it's Terri & my 15 YEAR anniversary this Wed/Thurs - & to celebrate I got us 3 nights at a B&B in Bodega Bay.  oh YUMMY! )

I do believe there's something going on with Strategik on Jan. 30.  At least that's the next one I'll be at.  I don't see the info posted on the homepage http://www.strategiksf.com site, but found an online flyer elsewhere and have been promoting it through my own channels.  I suggest those of you who have questions regarding Strategik events post up  your inquires from there site directly (as i don't think many, if any besides me & maybe another or two, are subbed to sfr)

have a good week everyone!

Subject: Re: [sfraves] ACME Dave died yesterday

So. . .

I'm not really sure what to say. . .
I guess I have a different attitude on life and death than most people.

I'll miss Dave, I was thinking about him a bunch in the past couple months. 
Everytime I went thru berkely, or past blakes or near that area anywhere I 
kinda hoped I'd run into him. I'm kind of a weirdo in that I don't usually 
call people to check up on them, I kinda just wait till fate or whatever you 
may call it brings us to bump into eachother.

I'll remember all the events we were at together. He was a good organizer, a 
leader type. Had tons of great ideas and creative ways of bringing them 
about. I mean one of my favorite events like ever was (was it an sfr party) 
in berkely somewhere in the hills above the college kinda near LBL I think. 
Down this nature trail thing in this little grove area. I think he found it 
by scouring google maps, and I also think I remember him getting poison oak 
there (which isn't really significant but I think it counts as a memory).

Good times like that one party at in some way the fuck out there town 
(might've been a feelgood party) where they had frog jumping contests (not 
during the party, but the town was like known for it), that was more of a 
big ass festival (I remember lil frogs in the showers everywhere). Where we 
built speakers cab setups on site for the sound system, and ended up pissing 
off a couple other crews cuz our sound was drowning out theirs. (I'm 
terrible with names hehe).

Btw, anyone see Bonez lately ? Has he heard?

There was also that other party (maybe another sfr one, we shuttled peeps 
for this one) that was on castro valley blvd, in a soon to be sold building 
by like zorbas. I forgot who but someone got the key from their mom, and we 
went in, blacked out the windows, and everything went off without a hitch 
till early in the morning. I love it when it's early in the morning, fucked 
up ravers are wandering out of a building, and neighbors, joggers and 
whatnot are just kinda watching, dumbfounded n lost at what went on during 
the night. .

Dave was a good guy. You know in that groove movie where the party producer 
guy was asked why he went thru all this to throw parties ? And he said he 
did it all for "the nod" ?
I kinda saw dave as a guy like that, like when everyone was having a good 
time, he was happiest. He was a good guy in the ways that I feel are some of 
the most important.

btw, it was at parties with him, that I met some of the best friends of my 
life, so in a way, that could possibly have never happened without his 
influence.

I'm a biker type, dirt and otherwise. . . I'm sure most people agree, they'd 
rather pass on to the next world doing something they love doing (with all 
dangers within and realized). It's sad and unfortunate to lose a 
friend/family like that, but these energies (souls you might call em) are 
with us throughout our lives, and we will meet again and do what we do again 
someday, sometime, and somelife. . .

he is and will be missed until then. . .

take care all

arycK

That was Herbonium Aryck... remember you did Map point 1 & i did map point
2, both by your house... & the girl who had the key was Jen, that short
girl with the short black brown hair you used to kick it with all the
time.. I got a pix from that night of us 3 and Alex Van Dune... i'll show
it to you when we kick it soon man....

we did herboniun again the year after, but it wasn't as big as the 1st
one.. but it was in the same building though... lol

yeah... it's still kinda hardcore for me man... I mean... it's been kinda
tough being like cause their family wants me to get in touch with the
raver familia & everyone dave knew & talking, emailing, geting in touch
with everyone... wow.. it's been taking it's toll on me for the ones who
ain't heard yet, they cry, I cry, & it becomes this mondo emo fest on the
phone or whatev man... yeah.. it's still hard to come to grips & still
kinda sureal for me still...

So my boss has this oldschool synth he's putting up for sale. 
Thought I'd post it here too, I have no idea if this is a 
rare find or junk, it looks pretty vintage. (I'm kinda curious what it 
actually is for you gearheads out there)

Hey Chuck,

Cloud computing, nothing new.  While I like the idea for running software, I
won't be handing over my MP3s, movies, etc, to google anytime soon!

minimal techno + avant house
every 1st Saturday at The Endup



featuring from Berlin:


MIKE SHANNON

(Cynosure . Plus 8 . Wagon Repair)
(Dumb-Unit . Force Inc . Num . ~scape)

A DJ since age 12, Mike Shannon had been an
integral member of the Canadian techno community
centered out of Montreal and a respected player on
the international scene for over a decade prior to his
recent move to Berlin. Whether it's putting out jackin',
quirky minimal techno and house on his own
Cynosure label, or producing acclaimed music on
some of the world's finest labels such as his recent
Memory Tree album on Plus8, Mike's total submersion
into the techno world is a reflection of his passion
and dedication to sharing great music with the world.



and special guest from Minneapols:


DUSTIN ZAHN - live pa

(Enemy . Drumcode . Droid Recordings . Rekids)

Dustin Zahn's distinctive brand of dark and heady
peak-hour techno has quickly carved him a place
amongst the best in the business. 2008 was a huge
year for this talented young artist, and with a stellar
string of releases on Drumcode, Droid Recordings,
and his own Enemy Records, 2009 shows no signs
of slowing.

MIKE SHANNON

(bio courtesy of residentadvisor.net)

It's been 10 years since Mike Shannon started making a name for himself on
the international techno scene as a DJ, producer and label owner. Now,
having relocated to Berlin from Valencia via Montreal in 2007 he's recently
crowned his first decade of active service with Memory Tree, his third full
length to date, and his debut for another notable Canadian export - Richie
Hawtin's Plus 8 Records. Over the years, Mike has well proven that it's not
just his music that makes him such a valuable asset to the techno community,
it's his total dedication to the cause. Whether finding him standing behind
a record shop counter or searching out new talent for his labels, it's
always been about bringing people together and investing in the future of
the scene.

Mike first got the vinyl bug at the tender age of 12, buying house and
techno tunes at Play de Record in Toronto and by 15 his turntable skills
were already landing him gigs at local underground parties and clubs. From
then on, Mike's musical world expanded rapidly thanks in no small part to
Detroit's influential WJLB radio station which turned him on to U.R., Juan
Atkins and Kevin Saunderson - influences that still play a big role in his
approach to music today. To satisfy his appetite for all things Techno, he
was soon managing the orders at Speed Records in his hometown of Kitchener,
Ontario where he continued his education; importing cutting edge sounds from
across Europe.

Throughout that time, Mike was out DJing and clubbing from Detroit to
Toronto, making connections and building up a solid network of producers and
artists, which led to the inevitable formation of his own label Cynosure in
1999. A couple of years later, he teamed up with Jeff Milligan on the more
experimental Revolver Canada imprint. Both labels have since developed into
highly respected and trusted sources, subsequently raising the profile of
Canada's electronic music scene by providing then unknown producers such as
Akufen and Deadbeat an international platform to spread their distinctive
sound throughout the world. Beyond developing homegrown talent, both
imprints continue to invite an inspired selection of international artists
including Pier Bucci, Monolake and Brett Johnson to name a few.

For Mike it's always been a question of choosing uncompromising artists who
possess a unique and original voice - an attitude that also defines his own
work whether recording as John Shananigans, The Sunaj Assassins or under his
own name. There's a distinctive feel to his music that's both dark and
soulful, that stays true to his roots while embracing the future and never
fails to deliver a flurry of kick-ass, funk infected beats easily proven by
a volley of timeless singles over the years and his two previous full
lengths. Take 2001's Slight of Hand on Force Inc - an album that cemented
his reputation as an up-and-coming Minimal Techno producer and 2005's
Possible Conclusions to Stories That Never End - a collection of chilled-out
Electronica inspired by his musical odyssey through out Chile in 2003.

Mike's recent move to Berlin represents the fulfillment of another chapter
in his musical career and with so many influential Canadian producers having
taken up residence in the German capital over the last few years, it's a
chance to hook up with old friends again and start collaborating on new
plans and ideas, just like the old days. Then of course there's the new
album, the accompanying remix projects and the immediate matter of
fatherhood to make 2008 something of a milestone both professionally and
personally.

DUSTIN ZAHN

After being influenced by mix-tapes of artists such as Richie Hawtin, Dustin
began writing music purely for fun. Shortly after, Dustin met future-partner
Ian Lehman, who was established in the mid-west rave scene. Ian explained to
him that music similar to his was played at parties called raves. Ian
invited him to one of his shows and Dustin took his offer to see what he was
talking about. After being exposed to just one party, Dustin knew this was
his future. Dustin started doing a Live PA at various local parties and
quickly became a favorite. After a year, Dustin stepped up to the decks and
won just as much respect as he did with his productions.

In early 2001, Dustin and Ian both agreed to take things to the next level.
They put a halt on bookings and concentrated on the studio. A year later
their work had emerged onto vinyl and all over the internet, creating a
serious buzz. Abiotic was born, and the duo formed The Attack People.

A few words can easily describe Dustin Zahn's style: moody, tribal, dark,
and hypnotic. Since Dustin co-founded Abiotic Recordings with Ian Lehman in
2001, he's finished projects for labels such as Invasion, Mankind, Compound,
GFR, Humanoid, and many others. His tracks have received support from many
of techno's top DJs, including Adam Beyer, Ben Sims, Chris Liebing, Dave
Clarke, Umek, Cari Lekebusch, Patrik Skoog, and countless more. Together
with partner Ian Lehman they perform a Live PA under the moniker "The Attack
People," a project concentrating on moody, futuristic funk for both the mind
and dance floor. Zahn is also known for his diverse 3-table DJ sets which
have brought him all over the U.S., to Europe, and South America.  When not
in the studio or DJing around the globe, he also co-promotes some of
Minneapolis' biggest techno parties.

In recent years Dustin has made a steady ascent into the upper echelons of
techno producers as a solo artist, with releases like "Moving The Chains" on
Drumcode and "Analog God" on Droid Recordings, as well as many more on his
own label, Enemy Records.  Future releases include a remix for Dubfire, as
well as tracks on Paco Osuna's Mindshake, Radio Slave's Rekids, and Adam
Beyer's Truesoul labels.  Clearly on a roll, Dustin Zahn is certainly a name
the techno world will be hearing much more of.

yup, january is almost over which means that break's over. after all,
the first couple of weeks of the year really are the only relatively
quiet weekends in the san francisco party scene, and you all know there
have been some awesome parties! blessing or curse? who cares! who else
in the world is lucky enough to have awesome music year round? 

with
any luck this will actually send out before the work day is over, but
if it didn't hopefully you all caught it on tribe or facebook....

on to what's goin down this weekend!



THURSDAY Jan 29th


continuing the theme that's grabbed a hold of me, there's some amazing live music at beat church tonight.

Beat Church
Shine Mission @ 9th
10pm -2am $5

Halo (Kitty-d & Mimosa)
Mr. Projectile
Cumulous


and apparently there's a new thursday hot spot in town...

9:30pm - 2am $5

Mary Ann Hobbes
Ghosts on Tape
DZ
Lazer Sword
Kid Kameleon

Alex Pasternak
Shane King

it's
a good thing these venues are only a few blocks from each other. i see
a lot of bouncing back and forth between the beats goin on tonight!



FRIDAY Jan 30th

i love it when there are a couple quality events on a weekend night
to recommend, especially when one goes later than the other. it won't
be a super late night but then the superbowl is sunday so you want to
save some energy! 

Detonate
Shine Mission @ 9th
9pm-2am $5

DJ Icon 
Dragn'fly vs. M.O.D.
Dex Stakker vs. ECQ

i
especially like the idea of pulse! because proceeds from these events
will go to good causes! proceeds from this night will go to A Safe
Place in Oakland, a comprehensive program in oakland for battered women
and their children more info at www.asafeplacedvs.org!

(((...PULSE...)))
Paradise Lounge

downstairs:

once
again, these venues aren't too far apart but i doubt paradise lounge
allows ins 'n outs so start off the night at shine and then head over
to paradise for more good music and to support a very good cause!



SATURDAY JAN 31st


ok, so things aren't quite in full swing
yet as there don't seem to be a gazillion late night options choose
from but there are three great events to choose from, one which if we
all head over between 1am and bar closed might go late night!

Hold your ground, hold your ground! Sons and daughters of the
Bay Area, my people! I see in your eyes the same fear that
would take the heart of me. A day may come when the courage of
women and men fails, when we forsake our friends and break all
bonds of fellowship, but it is not this day. An hour of woes
and shattered lives, when the age of human kind comes crashing
down! But it is not this day! This day we PULSE! By all that
you hold dear in this good Bay Area, I bid you DANCE, People of
the West!

I was planning on going this, but great 70F in Big Sur has derailed plans of
sticking around the city for the weekend.  I've heard a lot about your
collective Michael (Pule that is!), hopefully tonight goes well and we'll
see more stuff from y'all in the coming months!  Very nice line up by the
way, I wish Alland was playing at more parties than just Kontrol and the
Kontrol groupie promoters.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR: Google plans to make PCs history

Yeah... the last couple of times the idea rolled around it was "thin  
clients", and "network computers" before that.  "Cloud computing"...  
same thing, different day.

It ain't gonna happen until this country can pul its head out of its  
ass and build out a proper data infrastructure to every household.   
Comcast, their imitators, and the whole "traffic shaping" and monthly  
bandwidth cap BS need to be slapped down.  Network neutrality needs to  
go through.  And, FFS, we need fiber run on the local loop!  (Oh how I  
wish Verizon FIOS were available where I live!)

Then, after all that's done, maybe the next time the idea pops up...  
whatever they call it then... it will actually be feasible to implement.


cya,
john

France has had in home based dumb terminals in use for just under 3 decades,
read the wiki on 'minitel', so this is hardly a new concept. Part of the
problem is that access needs to be treated as a public resource, instead of
a private, profit making, one.

As far as FTTH goes, when I lived in Palo Alto and they lit their fiber loop
they wanted $1,500, up front, just to bring the wire past the door and then
some insane amt for monthly access, when it should have been made free to
every household in town, with at most a $5 a month municipal fee, with
plurhaps a carrier affiliate fee made when a household made an online
purchase, say 1/10th of .001%.

Bet that would have generated a nice revenue stream for the city, beats
having no takers, doesn't it?
