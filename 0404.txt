Subject: [sfraves] American and Canadian Officials Bust Drug Ring..  bummer dude!

-------------------------------1080835728
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="US-ASCII"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

WASHINGTON (March 31) - A U.S.-Canadian drug trafficking ring believed 
responsible for 15 percent of all the Ecstasy smuggled into America has been wiped 
out, authorities said Wednesday. They announced arrests and criminal charges 
against 170 people.
At its height, the ring distributed 1 million Ecstasy tablets per month in 
the two countries and laundered $5 million a month using travel agencies and 
bank transfers in the United States and Vietnam, officials said.
Drug Enforcement Administration chief Karen Tandy said the two-year 
investigation culminated in the arrests of nearly the entire trafficking operation, 
from leaders to couriers.
''We wiped out this entire organization,'' Tandy said at a news conference.
Ecstasy, or MDMA, is a synthetic controlled substance known originally as a 
''club drug'' because of its popularity at gatherings called ''raves'' and 
dance clubs. It has spread to high schools and colleges, with an estimated 3.2 
million people using the drug in 2002, according to the DEA.
It was once thought of as a harmless drug. But research has found that 
prolonged, heavy use of Ecstasy can cause confusion, depression, anxiety, aggressive 
and impulsive behavior, and memory loss, according to the National Institute 
on Drug Abuse.
Its popularity has caught the attention of an increasing range of criminal 
enterprises, largely because of the big profits. Pills sold at about $4 apiece 
wholesale in the operation typically cost $15 to $20 each on the street.
The organization targeted by U.S. and Canadian authorities consisted largely 
of people with Asian backgrounds, according to court documents. The alleged 
ringleaders were Ze Wai Wong, 46, a Chinese citizen, and Mai Phuong Le, 38, a 
Vietnamese citizen. Wong was arrested in Toronto and Le in Ottawa.
They operated three labs in Canada, which were discovered and dismantled in 
August, authorities said. The pills often were smuggled across the U.S. border 
or inside Canada in compartments within vehicle gas tanks, making the drugs 
hard to detect, particularly for drug-sniffing dogs.
The Supreme Court on Tuesday unanimously ruled that government agents have 
broad authority to search and even dismantle vehicle gas tanks to combat 
smuggling at U.S. borders.
The ring also used hidden gas tank compartments to transport cash. In one 
instance, the search of a vehicle headed for Canada in Burlington, Vt., yielded 
$750,000 in U.S. currency concealed in the compartment.
Authorities said the Wong-Le organization differs from previous Ecstasy 
trafficking groups because it is the first known to have manufactured the pills on 
a large scale in North America. The main sources of Ecstasy previously have 
been the Netherlands and Belgium.
These methods, said Deputy Attorney General James Comey, are ''a signal to us 
that, as we feared, the profits available in Ecstasy are attracting new 
traffickers and new ways of trafficking.''
U.S. and Canadian charging documents accuse Wong of leading a drug 
distribution ring in 18 U.S. cities and Canada and contend that Le orchestrated the 
laundering of drug money for the operation. They and the others are charged with a 
lengthy list of counts including conspiracy to distribute Ecstasy and 
operating a continuing criminal enterprise.
The organization also trafficked in Canadian-grown marijuana, known as ''BC 
Bud,'' and was involved in identity theft and other criminal enterprises, 
officials said. Raf Souccar, drug chief for the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, said 
eight marijuana-growing operations were shut down Wednesday in the Ottawa 
area.
Of those charged in arrest warrants, about 145 had been arrested as of 
Wednesday afternoon. Arrest and search warrants were executed in 16 American cities, 
with Canadian authorities serving 50 arrest warrants in Ottawa, Toronto and 
Montreal.
Arrests were made in these U.S. cities: Houston; Los Angeles; San Francisco; 
Oakland, Calif.; San Jose, Calif.; Jacksonville, Fla.; New Orleans; Baton 
Rouge, La.; Mobile, Ala.; New York; Boston; Atlanta; Alexandria, Va.; Des Moines, 
Iowa; Minneapolis and Salt Lake City.

For those of you who don't know, Dihydrogen Monoxide is the #1
unregulated chemical released by thousands of factories in the US each
year, and the EPA has refused to do anything to regulate it.  It causes
thousands of deaths in the US alone each year.  The gas form can cause
burns, and lengthy exposure to the solid form can cause lethargy,
numbness of the limbs, and eventually death.  However, the liquid form
is the most dangerous, and accidental ingestion of it is what causes the
most deaths.  If you want to learn more, you can go to this website:
http://www.netreach.net/~rjones/no_dhmo.html or do a google searchfor
Dihydrogen Monoxide.  I've found tons of useful information on the web.
Let's help ban this chemical once and for all!

That was in the news not too long ago about a prank site that was talking

Generally, using the IUPAC system, it is sufficient to say dihydrogen-oxide.

Just a side note,

Ravers should note that, while ingestion of this chemical in moderate amounts 
is a good thing when exercising/sweating/dancing, ingesting too much can 
result in death. The condition is known as "hyponatremia" and means there is not 
enough salt in the blood. So, go ahead and pay your $2 or $3 per "dose" of this 
chemical, but use some sense when putting this chemical into your body -- 
don't overdo it!

Ravers should note that, while ingestion of this chemical in moderate
amounts is a good thing when exercising/sweating/dancing, ingesting too
much can result in death. The condition is known as "hyponatremia" and
means there is not enough salt in the blood. So, go ahead and pay your
$2 or $3 per "dose" of this chemical, but use some sense when putting
this chemical into your body -- don't overdo it! 

 

It does have a useful purpose after parties as well:  its
characteristics as a solvent help remove "raver funk" from the skin.
It's also good to take some along with 5-HTP, helping one to recover
from a hard weekend of partying.

"What's up good people?. 

How's it going?? Good I hope. It's a good week when Bush and his lying bandwagon of corporate sponsored thieves are on the defense. Don't ya think? Oh sorry, I meant to rant less this week. Suffice it to say his revived campaign to be seen as a compassionate conservative is a joke, and the vice-pres is a dick.

Let's move on to my big TV debut. He he he. I hope I don't end up regretting this, but I'll be one of many people on the Peter Jennings special on ecstasy this Thursday at 10:00pm on Channel 7. The producers seemed to have a genuine interest in giving an honest account and history of the little pill that has been the subject of much misinformation, and varying degress of dance floor consumption. They interviewed dozens of people for the piece, including Alexander Shulgin, the first chemist to report it's effects, Frankie Bones, pioneer of the East Coast Rave scene, the Texas business man who sold it legally, the law enforcement agents involved in it's criminalization, psychiatrists, psychologists, and accounts from people who have tried it. This should be an interesting show, tell a friend. More info in 'Syd's Corner' above. When it's over, go see Boy George at Ruby Skye, just for fun. His drug of choice was heroin, but he stills spins a fun set of music. Info: spundae.com"

That's a great story. It would have been very ironic, for sure. I, also, have been grazed by a disco ball, no damage done though. It was only about a foot in diameter and split when it landed on the ground. Gotta watch out for those Mission bars. Dangerous props man.

Sure, it's great until you go into seizures or have a stroke and end up in a wheel chair for the rest of your life over it. Both of which I've seen, and also have personally experienced the seizure effect. Be safe.

For those of you who don't know, Dihydrogen Monoxide is the #1
unregulated chemical released by thousands of factories in the US each
year, and the EPA has refused to do anything to regulate it. It causes
thousands of deaths in the US alone each year. The gas form can cause
burns, and lengthy exposure to the solid form can cause lethargy,
numbness of the limbs, and eventually death. However, the liquid form
is the most dangerous, and accidental ingestion of it is what causes the
most deaths. If you want to learn more, you can go to this website:
http://www.netreach.net/~rjones/no_dhmo.html or do a google searchfor
Dihydrogen Monoxide. I've found tons of useful information on the web.
Let's help ban this chemical once and for all!

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

Good people, great parties. Check them out!

Why hello fellow Rehab-ers. We're so proud of those of you who showed up for Step One. We hope this month has not been too trying, and you find your resolve to have a good time has only strengthened as you waited oh-so-patiently and prepared for Step Two. 

This coming Sunday, from 11am to 3pm, we're ready to take it to the next level. This is when it starts to get serious, patients. Those $2 Mimosas have turned into beastly cost-effective $15 pitchers, and $3 Bloody Marys will also be singing to you as $20 pitchers. Who loves and supports you? We do. 

Our fabulous brunch menu will keep you feeling nourished and cared for. And the prices simply rock: nothing is over $10. 

Speaking of rock, we'll have some fab fashions strolling through the clinic inspired by the greatest supplier of endless rehab candidates: no, not Jerry Springer. Rock 'n' roll, babies. (Fashions courtesy of the ladies over at Retro Fit on Valencia.) 

And lastly, the thing that makes Rehab extra-special (besides you, naturally): the music. We'll have DJs Big Red and Deevice keeping your head nodding because of their damned good music, and not because of some dangerous substances you got your hands on. 




Treatment is this Sunday, April 4th, 11am to 3pm. Rehab is held on first Sundays, so Step Three will be May 2nd. 

@ Temple Bar and Bistro 
600 Polk St. @ Turk St. 
(next to the Embassy Hotel) 

See you Sunday. Because you deserve as much Rehab as you need. 

Lovingly, 
Your Sponsors, Marcia (Knees Up) and Ryan (Root PR)

Hello everyone!

I am starting a new email discussion group and would like to invite you to be a part of this. We will be talking about whatever you feel like sharing. Personally, I plan to include discussion regarding events in San Francisco and the bay area, artistic people and happenings, political view points, and things of high or low importance but with good entertainment or knowledge value. Please join us as we share and grow through the bonds we create. 

Email me your email address and I'll send you an invitation to join "cosmicones".

Love and light, heidi

P.S. 

I will NEVER abuse or give out/sell your email address or info for anything.

WOW. WOW. WOW.

Did anyone just watch the ABC report on ecstasy? I think that is the most 
positive news broadcast I have *ever* seen. I think they touched on *alot* of 
what all of us have said at one time or another. I can't even remember the last 
time I took E and I am not actively taking *any* drugs nowadays, but I'm still 
very happy about that report, particularly about the finger pointing at the 
government. Given the climate of today with all the government foot soldiers in 
the media, I am pretty amazed at what this report touched on, especially 
pointing out that the faulty reports like the ones they published only undermines 
our trust in them and to what degree we'll listen to them in the future... boy 
who cried wolf syndrome, so to speak.

Way to go. Who ever though ABC, a Christian run broadcasting company, would 
produce and air this? I am so relieved, in fact, that I just signed back on to 
SFR after being absent for forever to discuss this. : )

Also, does anyone else find that there's nothing like a news broadcast about 
how bad ecstasy and raves are that makes you want to go out and take a pill 
again? ; )

heart,
Alida

Subject: [sfraves] Peter Jennings' Ecstasy Story....

I just got done watching the thing...

.... and HOLY FUCKING SHIT!!!!  That's something I never thought I'd 
see coming from a major network, and CERTAINLY nothing I though I'd see 
from ABC (which had a series of ecstasy scare-story specials in prime 
time, a while back).

I think they went way too light on that doctor at Johns Hopkins who got 
caught falsifying his research.  But other that that, it was everything 
short of calling the government a bunch of bullshit-spewing liars!  And 
I guess with bush's FCC on the rampage these days, you really can't get 
away with saying such things explicitly.

I especially like the way he ended the show: saying that even if 
credible research showing that there IS permanent and long-term brain 
damage DOES show up in the future, that no one will believe them, after 
all the lies they've told so far.  Too true, too true.  Methinks that 
far too many people have forgotten the tale of "The Boy Who Cried Wolf"


cya,
john

I was satisfied with it. Well balanced, informative... and made the
leadership of the DEA look like a bunch of twits. "Oooo, it's a touchy feely
drug..." That mid-80s DEA head just oozes unhappy bitterness, and he's one
of the originals do start the whole criminal mess.

Yeah, it's possible we could all be a bunch of twitchy windowlickers by the
time we're 60... but that could also be the fate of users of Prozac,
Wellbutrin, Xanax, Zoloft, and plenty of other emotion-futzing drugs for
which we ALSO have no data on long-term effects.

Rave on, guinea pigs.  =)

Maybe it was their general annoyance with the government using them for
their own nefarious ends (e.g., the "we have to go to war with Iraq"
propaganda machine).  The report was a nice little "up yours" to the
administration that had the added benefit of being truthful.  =)

	I just watched it too, and I agree it was a major breakthrough. 
Especially helpful was the interviews with older, articulate people who 
have used the drug and had positive experiences. I think maybe John 
Stossel is having an effect on the rest of ABC. I do wish Jennings had 
used some side-by-side comparisons the way Stossel often does. Too many 
people who watch the special will still come away with impressions like 
"people have died from Ecstasy" or "Ecstasy poses unknown risks." 
Comparing Ecstasy to various legal substances and activities which are 
more deadly, or pose equally unknown risks, would have helped put 
legitimate concerns in proper perspective. I also felt the show made 
Alexander Shulgin come across a bit like Dr. Frankenstein, out there 
tampering alone in his lab with all kinds of dangerous chemicals and 
heedless of the consequences, when in fact he is a very careful and 
conscientious scientist. Still, kudos to ABC for ripping a big hole in 
the government's lying propaganda.

Truth be told, ecstacy, pure MDMA, was created as an anti-depressant. It makes you feel good, therefore the government must do what they can to convince us not to use it. They wouldn't want us taking away from their "legal" anti-depressants in the big money making pharmaceutical industry. It's funny how they never mention the side effects of Paxil when they are about 1000 times worse than anything ecstacy, pure MDMA, can do to people. Such as:
 
"Frequent - Paxil - Seroxat (Paroxetine) Side Effects

Body as a Whole: Malaise (a vague feeling of bodily discomfort), pain. Cardiovascular: Hypertension, syncope (a sudden loss of strength, a temporary suspension of consciousness due to cerebral anemia), tachycardia (excessive rapidity in the action of the heart). Dermatological: Pruritus (Intense itching) Gastrointestinal: Nausea and vomiting. Metabolic and Nutritional: Weight gain, weight loss. Nervous System: Central Nervous System stimulation, concentration impaired, depression, emotional lability (emotional instability), vertigo (a hallucination of movement; a sensation as if the external world were revolving around the patient or as if he himself were revolving in space). Respiratory: Cough increased, rhinitis (inflammation of the mucus membrane of the nose). " 
 
Taken from http://www.prozactruth.com/paxil.htm.
 
"Legal" anti-depressants have MUCH worse side effects and severe withdrawal symptoms. Paxil is even warned of driving some users to suicide due to their absolute dependence on this "legal" drug that is regularly pushed by your trusted family doctors. 
 
Does anyone see anything wrong with this picture? Our government doesn't want the street drug competition and that is why their efforts regarding the "War on Drugs" rages on. If you ever pay attention to the side effects of the most commonly prescribed FDA approved drugs, you will clearly see the governments concern for our helath is NOT their number one priority. The bottom line, as always, is big business, big $$. 
 
Check out this article posted today on Yahoo news regarding a drug bust and "the dangers of ecstacy". http://news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&u=/ap/20040331/ap_on_re_us/us_canada_ecstasy
 
How many times can they tell the same lies when no one is believing them anymore? Seems to carry over into many aspects...

Way to go. Who ever though ABC, a Christian run broadcasting company, would 
produce and air this? I am so relieved, in fact, that I just signed back on to 
SFR after being absent for forever to discuss this. : )

Also, does anyone else find that there's nothing like a news broadcast about 
how bad ecstasy and raves are that makes you want to go out and take a pill 
again? ; )

Hi Alida,

Missed you:)  Yes, I agree.  This was the most balanced piece of commercial 
journalism I've seen on MDMA.  I believe much science these days has been 
politicized, and the ABC report goes right to the heart of this 
issue.  Props to them.

I heard through someone else that the producers at ABC took some risk with 
this program, so they would appreciate support.   Write to ABC.

Love,

Apollo

I was thinking the same exact thing re: SSRI's etc. during the show as well. 
I mean hell, we don't really know the long term side effects of those drugs 
either! And I was just talking to a woman the other day about when she went of 
prozac after being on it for a few years and how severe the withdraws were. She 
said she had never been so miserable in her life and that she had every 
possible horrible side effect all at once for three months. Yes, of course, 
everyone reacts differently... not everyone has those side effects, nor does everyone 
feel depressed the day after taking E.... but I've heard of far more people 
having unbearable side effects from legal antidepressants and anxiety 
medications, and more importantly having their day to day *life* dramatically impacted 
by it, then I do with ecstasy users. I don't think there has been anyone who 
was driven to kill while they were on ecstasy, yet there are many controversial 
murder/suicide cases involving people that were recently places on 
antidepressants/anxiety medications prior to the deaths.

I have to wonder though, and I'm sure there is a reason that I just don't 
know about.... if MDMA was developed as an antidepressant, yadda yadda, and it's 
making all this money on the streets and so many people are taking it, etc... 
why not legalize it and get the pharmaceutical companies in on it so they can 
become even *more* profitable (*vomit*)? I'm going to take a stab and say that 
it is because MDMA generally actually makes people bond, feel loving and 
compassionate, it is conscious altering, etc. rather than just making the person 
numb and passive? Brave New World anyone?

heart,
Alida

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Surprised? Just a bit!...ecstacy story

Here's a really good article on the history of MDMA:
http://www.a1b2c3.com/drugs/x_01.htm

It notes that the psychiatric/psychotherapeutic use of MDMA started
in the mid 1970's. Interesting point to note that the US commissioned
research in the 1950's in pursuit of a truth serum for the Army's
chemical warefare...later proving not suitable for that purpose.

<que cera cera>

Highlights:

"...A MAPS History of MDMA

MDMA was first synthesized in 1912. It was patented in Germany by the
Merck Company in 1914. At that time it was not the subject of human
research.

Merck stumbled across MDMA when they tried to synthesize Hydrastinin, a
vasoconstrictive and styptic medicine.

MDMA was an unplanned by-product of this synthesis. As usual, the process
of its synthesis was patented.

It can not be reconstructed to what extent Merck tested MDMA and what the
results of such testing were, but it can be excluded with certainty that
MDMA was ever considered as an appetite suppressant.

In the 1950s it was briefly researched by the U.S. Government as part of
the CIA's and the Army's chemical warfare investigations, a commissioned
research in 1953/54 on MDA, MDMA and other substances as a truth serum.
They proved to be unsuitable for this purpose.

The results of this research were not published until 1973. The first
reported recreational use was in the 1960s.

In the middle 1970s, it was rediscovered by the psychedelic therapy
community and began to be used as an adjunct to psychotherapy by
psychiatrists and therapists who were familiar with the field of
psychedelic psychotherapy. MAPS published a book, The Secret Chief, about
the leader of this therapy community.

The above info came from MAPS, for more, on The Struggle to Conduct
Research into the Therapeutic Use of MDMA, go to the MAPS Website.

More History of MDMA

In the early 1980s, the drug began to be used non-medically, particularly
in Texas, under the name Ecstasy.

Both the non-medical and therapeutic use of MDMA were made illegal in 1985
despite the Drug Enforcement Administration Administrative Law Judge
Francis Young's recommendation that physicians be permitted to continue to
administer it to their patients.

Soon afterwards its use rapidly spread outside the United States as well.
In Dallas, where alcohol was prohibited at the Southern Methodist
University, students bought legal MDMA as a substitute, paying by credit
card.

The US consumption rose from 10,000 doses in the whole year of 1976 to
30,000 doses a month in 1985. At the same time the Drug Enforcement
Administration (DEA) reported that 30,000 doses a month were being used in
the state of Texas alone.

A 1987 survey revealed that 40% of students on the campus of Stanford
University had used MDMA. In 1985 MDMA was prohibited by the Drug
Enforcement Administration, when it was given the same status as heroin
and LSD..."

Subject: [sfraves] BSP: 4/3/04 Punch and Slip: A Jungle Juice House Party

Here's the link to the prettier (not pretty, but prettier) version: 
http://www.brproductions.net/BBS1/viewtopic.php?t=5530&sid=51aef3dd417d650fd79c7273a63572af

Othewise, here ya go:

(4/3/2004) Punch and Slip: A Jungle Juice House Party
Featuring The Flank from Santa Cruz, CA


The Deal:
Free House party at my house for anyone who doesn't break shit and can 
respect a house. It's BYOB so come fully stocked (and bring extra for me  ). 
As long as everything goes according to plan there will be open decks for 
those who want to play (see below). We are having a band from Santa Cruz 
come and play as well.

The Catch:
So check it, I'm down to throw a house party this Sat but I don't have any 
sound. If someone has some powered monitors or sound they could contribute, 
you get priority on the time you want to play (except when the band plays, 
see below). PM or email me if you want to play or if you can bring sound (a 
nicer mixer would be cool too). Basically, sound is the necessity at the 
moment.

Other Stuff:
We are having a band come through and play. They are The Flank from Santa 
Cruz. That's right people, a band, you know... with real instruments! They 
will probably play from 12-1 or 1-2, so come early and get your swerve on. 
Other than that, open decks but I'm going to reserve slots for people who 
get in touch with me so that we don't have the same issue we had last time. 
Respectful promoters are welcome to come through, but if you flyer any of 
the cars in the neighborhood I am going to put your face on a milk carton. 
Again, promoters are welcome but you cannot flyer outside of the house, 
period. Remember, cig butts go in the trash, not my front yard or the 
street. Thanks.

I guess that's is... If I work out some sort of time schedule for 
everything, I'll post it.

W3RD ^,
-Joey

PS, If you wanna get your swerve on and you need to crash here, it's cool; 
just bring some blankets or whatever and find a corner to crawl into  .

PPS, Bring stuff for jungle juice

Subject: [sfraves] RR: Thursday Breaks @ Shadow Lounge

Holy effin' ish!!!!

Ok - so maybe I'm a weeeeeeeeeeeee bit biased, because breakbeats OWN that 
azz, but last night was MUCH fun. I got to meet a few folks (Brandon & the 
Greg J - that's his name right? LOL), and I gots ta hear some tasty broken 
beats. There was a pretty decent sized crowd considering it was a Thursday 
and the 1st night of the party too, which was really surprising. The sound 
was pretty decent as well. A little loud to start with, but when the people 
flowed in it evened out nicely.

This party has promise people! I suggest if you like breaks, and you like 
partying in the city on a Thursday night, that you get yer arse down there 
next time around!!! They have some good local talent spinning there, and 
it's FREE for god's sake!!! The drinks aren't even horribly priced, and I 
dunno if it was just me - but they seemed to be on the stiff side, which you 
cannot argue with. For around $5 I got a RedBull  & vodka that was mainly 
vodka.

I'm stoked to go back personally, and if any of you miscreants wanna come 
with me next time, say the word!!!

Two very enthusiastic thumbs up!!!!

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Peter Jennings' Ecstasy Story....

I thought it was a well balanced and methodical presentation of the issues 
facing a scared administration, and an out of control drug whose effects are 
not understood.  I particularly appreciated the degree of criticism against 
the administration for adopting unsound science in support of over-reaching 
policies, that failed to weigh in any of the criteria for schedule 1 
classification (ie. no medical use).

Peter Jennings is the last person I expected to see making those 
arguements.. who's next Dan Rather?

"Security is mostly a superstition.  It does not exist in nature, nor do 
the children of humans as a whole experience it.  Avoiding danger is no 
safer in the long run than outright exposure.  Life is either a daring 
adventure or nothing."
-Helen Keller

The dangerous patriot: "The one who drifts into chauvinism and exhibits 
blind enthusiasm for military actions. He is a defender of militarism and 
its ideals of war and glory. Chauvinism is a proud and bellicose form of 
patriotism . . . which identifies numerous enemies who can only be dealt 
with through military power and which equates the national honor with 
military victory..."
-Marine Corps, Colonel James A. Donovan

Subject: RE: [sfraves] RR: Thursday Breaks @ Shadow Lounge

word, marco.

for our first night, i was pleasantly surprised with the turnout!  i guess 
some people do like breaks (other than me and marco).  anyhow, to recap the 
night...M.O.D., Aaron Jae and I did some swapping behind the decks for most 
of the eve with the crowd peaking at about midnight.  for a party with no 
flyers and only word getting out on the street this week...really can't 
imagine asking for a better night.  i'd say we had about 40-50 people come 
through there, which was delightful.

lots of friends showed up.  djs Doubleday and Greg J showed up (both of whom 
will be playing later this month), Tim/Antitim and Eva, Mr. Marco popped in 
with a CD of his (thanks!).  heck, even Mike Migurski was there!  when was 
the last time you saw that guy out past 8pm?

next week, our very special guest on the decks is none other than the Donna 
Matrix.  you know her, you love her.  and the vinyl goodies in her bag will 
spank you harder than your daddies backhand.

look for more BSPs from me next week.  special thanks go out to M.O.D. and 
Aaron Jae for rockin' tha jams, Pam for putting it down proper, Adam and the 
Shadow Lounge for providing the space, and all y'all who came out to have a 
good time!  see you next thursday.

i think when they say "we come from the 80s" it means that most of the 
people at this party were born in the 80s....like 1985 to 1989.  ;)

i think theme parties are fun!

Additionally, A well known news agent (ktvu) is also negotiating several =
(6+) other deals with various news agencies around the counrty.
There will be a followup bit with KTVU coming up again sometime probably =
next month.

I'll keep people updated on dates, times n such.

I'm actually quite busy right now, kind of being a main volunteer trying =
to help everyone. Theres a small number of us around the country who are =
working to get this issue recognized and treated. . .so far it's well on =
it's way to happening.

Karina <karina@hyperreal.org> wrote:
Here's a really good article on the history of MDMA:
http://www.a1b2c3.com/drugs/x_01.htm

It notes that the psychiatric/psychotherapeutic use of MDMA started
in the mid 1970's. Interesting point to note that the US commissioned
research in the 1950's in pursuit of a truth serum for the Army's
chemical warefare...later proving not suitable for that purpose.



Highlights:

"...A MAPS History of MDMA

MDMA was first synthesized in 1912. It was patented in Germany by the
Merck Company in 1914. At that time it was not the subject of human
research.

Merck stumbled across MDMA when they tried to synthesize Hydrastinin, a
vasoconstrictive and styptic medicine.

MDMA was an unplanned by-product of this synthesis. As usual, the process
of its synthesis was patented.

It can not be reconstructed to what extent Merck tested MDMA and what the
results of such testing were, but it can be excluded with certainty that
MDMA was ever considered as an appetite suppressant.

In the 1950s it was briefly researched by the U.S. Government as part of
the CIA's and the Army's chemical warfare investigations, a commissioned
research in 1953/54 on MDA, MDMA and other substances as a truth serum.
They proved to be unsuitable for this purpose.

The results of this research were not published until 1973. The first
reported recreational use was in the 1960s.

In the middle 1970s, it was rediscovered by the psychedelic therapy
community and began to be used as an adjunct to psychotherapy by
psychiatrists and therapists who were familiar with the field of
psychedelic psychotherapy. MAPS published a book, The Secret Chief, about
the leader of this therapy community.

The above info came from MAPS, for more, on The Struggle to Conduct
Research into the Therapeutic Use of MDMA, go to the MAPS Website.

More History of MDMA

In the early 1980s, the drug began to be used non-medically, particularly
in Texas, under the name Ecstasy.

Both the non-medical and therapeutic use of MDMA were made illegal in 1985
despite the Drug Enforcement Administration Administrative Law Judge
Francis Young's recommendation that physicians be permitted to continue to
administer it to their patients.

Soon afterwards its use rapidly spread outside the United States as well.
In Dallas, where alcohol was prohibited at the Southern Methodist
University, students bought legal MDMA as a substitute, paying by credit
card.

The US consumption rose from 10,000 doses in the whole year of 1976 to
30,000 doses a month in 1985. At the same time the Drug Enforcement
Administration (DEA) reported that 30,000 doses a month were being used in
the state of Texas alone.

A 1987 survey revealed that 40% of students on the campus of Stanford
University had used MDMA. In 1985 MDMA was prohibited by the Drug
Enforcement Administration, when it was given the same status as heroin
and LSD..."

It's funny how they never mention the side effects of Paxil when they are about 1000 times worse than anything ecstacy, pure MDMA, can do to people. Such as:

	As noted, I suspect that John Stossel's influence may be rubbing off 
on other people at ABC. He has done great reporting on the Drug War -- 
it's always refreshing to see White House spokesmen complaining that a 
media report was unfair to their perspective on drugs (see 
http://www.mapinc.org/drugnews/v02/n000/a096.html)!

	By the way, for those wishing to comment to ABC News, you can give

I put up my Quasimidi 309 for sale on Ebay. I am getting cash together
for a second turntable after a bout of insanity and selling the other
one thinking I could quit spinning at any time. The link is-

http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=3715652346&category=3
8069&sspagename=STRK%3AMESSE%3AIT&rd=1 

This is one badass unit. It is like having a 303, 606, 808, and 909 in
one unit. I love it but my need to spin has outgrown my need to produce.

Subject: Live Music Under Attack - Fight for Your Rights


Live Music Under Attack - Fight for Your Rights

Members of Congress think the American people won't stand up for their
rights.  On April 24th we're going to prove them wrong.

Narrow-minded policymakers are working to shut down radio shows, TV
shows, concerts, and other events they don't like. In the last couple of
weeks, the federal government has fined Clear Channel and Infinity
Broadcasting over a million dollars for daring to air radio shows
considered offensive by bureaucrats.  The U.S. House of Representatives
just passed a bill making television stations pay massive fines if they
air television shows Members of Congress find "indecent".  The Justice
Department is using the RAVE Act to scare nightclubs away from playing
certain kinds of music. The entire entertainment industry is under
attack.

Now, Congress is considering legislation that would hold bands, DJs,
bartenders, promoters, venue owners, radio stations and others liable if
a patron uses drugs at a nightclub or concert. If enacted, music lovers
could soon be unable to see their favorite band, DJ or other
entertainment live. The economic impact on the music industry could be
devastating.  (For more detailed information on this legislation see the
link at the bottom of this alert.)

Following the lead of local groups around the country, the Drug Policy
Alliance is making April 24th a Day and Night of Outrage to protest
these proposed laws, raise awareness among voters, and raise money to
stop them. Already, music lovers in Billings (Montana), Denver, Los
Angeles, New York, Santa Fe and Washington DC are planning events.
Without the help of people like you, this legislation could become law.

What you can do

1) Organize a protest. Go to our sign-up form
(http://actioncenter.drugpolicy.org/ctt.asp?u=37373&l=25494) if you're
willing to take on the responsibility of organizing something in your
area.

2) If you're a musician, consider donating some or all of your income
from that night. You can also convince the venue you're playing at to
donate money. As D:FUSE says, "Artists have a responsibility to raise
money for this campaign to protect live music. Not only can this
legislation shut down the venues we play at, it could even land artists
in jail."  Let us know what you can do to help.

3) If you're a promoter, get musicians and venue owners to donate some
of their proceeds from that night. Promoters in Los Angeles, New York,
and Washington, DC are already getting DJs to play for free that night,
in exchange for the venue giving money to the campaign.  Let us know
about your event.

4) If you're a club owner consider donating a percentage of your
proceeds from that night
(http://actioncenter.drugpolicy.org/ctt.asp?u=37373&l=25494).
An easy way to help out is to simply add $2 to that night's cover
charge, and donate that money to stop federal legislation that could be
used to shut down your business.

5) Fax your U.S. Representative and tell him or her to oppose this
legislation
(http://actioncenter.drugpolicy.org/ctt.asp?u=37373&l=25495).

6) Distribute flyers
(http://actioncenter.drugpolicy.org/ctt.asp?u=37373&l=25496) and
petitions (http://actioncenter.drugpolicy.org/ctt.asp?u=37373&l=25497)
at music shows, record stores, and festivals.

7) Donate money now
(http://actioncenter.drugpolicy.org/ctt.asp?u=37373&l=25500)
to help make April 24th a success.

8) Forward this e-mail to musicians, promoters, venue owners, and music
lovers. Encourage them to take action.

Actually, the FDA is currently pushing for far stronger language regarding

I've known people who were given a quick handout for mild depression and
ended up in a total tailspin far more severe than their original issue
from the mood changes caused by the stuff.

Thank god. It's about fucking time. Thanks for updating us on that. The 
current trends of misdiagnosis and grossly overprescribing these drugs 
unnecessarily (i.e. "I'm having trouble sleeping and feel a little sad that my cat died." 
"Here's a prescribtion for Zoloft! Take it for the next eight years!") is one 
of the driving forces of me going to school to become a 
psychoneuroimmunologist. I'm glad the rest of the world is waking up to these problems.


heart,
Alida

Yeah, "psychoneuroimmunologist" has to be one of the coolest job titles /
careers I've ever heard of.  My job title isn't nearly as cool, but I'm an
antidisestablishmentarianist during my off-hours.  =)

if you're in the east bay and considering driving to SF by way of the 
Bay Bridge - DON'T.  take BART...

Posted: April 2, 2004 at 3:51 p.m.

SAN FRANCISCO (BCN) -- Officials are continuing their negotiations with 
a man who has been standing on a railing on the westbound side of the 
Bay Bridge near Treasure Island since about 11 a.m. today, according to 
California Highway Patrol Officer Virgil Aguilar.

  Westbound traffic is backed up to Highway 880 and Highway 92 and is 
getting worse by the minute as people aim to avoid the Bay Bridge 
snarl, Aguilar said.

  "It's Friday, people want to go home, and they've been working all 
week. This is causing major delays, especially because there is a 
Giants game tonight at SBC Park," Aguilar said.

  Drivers on the Golden Gate and San Mateo bridges are facing backups 
too.

  At one point, the man appeared to be smoking a cigarette, according to 
Aguilar. Earlier today, Aguilar said he was bleeding at the mouth.

  Also assisting the situation is the U.S. Coast Guard, which has sent 
two boats to the Bay Bridge for "any type of rescue and assistance 
should the man decide not to go back over the rail onto the auto deck," 
Coast Guard Petty Office Gabriel Flesher said.

lol.. at the career titles!!

I am curiuos how many people have notable short-term memory loss after doing 
extensive amounts of E.  I know I did, after about 1 year of regular 
(meaning excessive) use of pure molly.  But, I also was able to notice a 
significant recovery of my short term memory after about 6 months to a year 
of abstinance.  I think that is pretty good for it being such a potent 
chemical.  It took me longer to recover my learning disabilities incurred 
from smoking pot, not to mention the psychological addiction if mary-jane 
that I never got from E.

Amazing.. anyone have similliar experience that has stopped taking it after 
prolonged use?

i don't know why they're wasting their time on this loser.  let him

	It says "80" in parenthesis after your name. If you're really =

Friday, April 16, 2004 ** Elektrosorcery presents Aries **

Aries subjects are courageous leaders with a genuine concern for those they=
 command, being responsible people, it is rare that they will use their sub=
ordinates to obtain their own objectives as leaders, but occasionally it do=
es happen. They do not make very good followers because they are too "take =
charge". They may be unwilling to obey or submit to directions for which th=
ey can see no reason, or with which they disagree. They are much concerned =
with self, both positively and negatively - self-reliant but also self cent=
ered (sometimes) and concerned with their own personal advancement and phys=
ical satisfaction. Their immense energy makes them aggressive and restless,=
 argumentative occasionally, headstrong, quick tempered, easily offended an=
d capable of holding grudges if they feel themselves affronted.

With Aries DJs: Kid Wicked, SemaJ, Element, Goober, & Jesse Gonzalez.

A Super Special Seekr Space with: Aaron Jae, Allen, David Bu Hau, Cyrus, Sc=
ottO, & Dr. Kipper.

And an Elektrosorcery Summoning Chamber with: Majere, James Dub, The Doctor=
, Nick Nyquil, Pandacon, & Leon Cook.

Red Melon is proud to finally be able to showcase one of the biggest succes=
s stories in the underground house movement. Ask yourself how many globally=
 respected, underground artist-producer-DJs have turned-down offers to tour=
 with U2, and you will likely draw a short list. Josh Wink is such an artis=
t -- one who is unassuming, yet enjoys a cult following and who places arti=
stic integrity above all else. Owner of Ovum Recordings and remixer of mega=
-talents such as Sting, Depeche Mode and Ladytron, Josh has made only rare =
appearences in San Francisco, so don't miss out.

Supporting Josh will be Dano, Dj and tech house producer from San Francisco=
=2E  After a long winter touring Australia, New Zealand, and Eastern Europe=
, Dano is back in town working in the studio for a few months.  Dano has th=
ree new releases coming out simultaneously on Silicone Soul's Darkroom Dubs=
 imprint, Honchos Music, and Red Melon.  He will be spinning fresh techy gr=
ooves along with red melon biz partner JZ.  No stranger to the Melon experi=
ence, JZ is responsible for some of the most memorable sets in the seven ye=
ars of parties Red Melon has produced.  It will be just like old times!

If you are serious about your Red Melon parties, this Melon is not to be mi=
ssed! Get there before 11:00pm to take advantage of an earlybird cover char=
ge of $10 at San Francisco's newest venue, Mighty, located at 119 Utah St a=
t 15th Street. Mighty is a beautiful renovated warehouse with a touch of te=
chnology and art and the massive sound system that made Club Townsend a San=
 Francisco favorite. All of that plus cheap drinks too! You can't go wrong.=

Subject: Re: [sfraves] bay bridge troubles

well, maybe he's mentally ill, but in that case he ought to be in a 
hospital, not on the bay bridge ...

but whatever his situation is, or whatever kind of person he is, what 
business does he have backing up a major traffic artery like that?

my point is, i don't think he really wanted to jump in the first place, 
otherwise he would have jumped right away, like that guy who jumped in 
front of a caltrain a few years ago.  this is just a copycat looking 
for attention, and if you want to show him compassion, i'm fine with 
that, but i really don't think that's doing anything to help his 
situation.  what needs to happen is the judge needs to throw the book 
at him.  that way he understands if he's feeling bad to turn to a 
friend or a community center or a suicide hotline.

this is going to happen again in the next year ... mark my words ... 
and you'll never hear about this guy again.

Subject: [sfraves] BSP: Free, Tonight, Punch and Slip!

Check it out, we've got some timeslots and additional info added for the 
party.  Directions and address will be posted later today.

http://www.brproductions.net/BBS1/viewtopic.php?t=5530

for those who are too lazy to look at the prettier version:


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(4/3/2004) Punch and Slip: A Jungle Juice House Party
Featuring The Doctor (dnb) and The Flank (rock) from Santa Cruz, CA

***UPDATE***
Sound has been graciously provided by DJ Resistance. We will now be rockin' 
the neighborhood with some serious bump. DJ's who want to get a time slot 
instead of duke it out should IM or email me soon.


The Deal:
Free House party at my house for anyone who doesn't break shit and can 
respect a house. It's BYOB so come fully stocked (and bring extra for me  ). 
As long as everything goes according to plan there will be open decks for 
those who want to play (see below). We are having a band from Santa Cruz 
come and play as well.

The Catch:
* there is no catch... YAY!

Other Stuff:
We are having a band come through and play. They are The Flank from Santa 
Cruz. That's right people, a band, you know... with real instruments! They 
will probably play from 12-1 or 1-2, so come early and get your swerve on. 
Other than that, open decks but I'm going to reserve slots for people who 
get in touch with me so that we don't have the same issue we had last time. 
Respectful promoters are welcome to come through, but if you flyer any of 
the cars in the neighborhood I am going to put your face on a milk carton. 
Again, promoters are welcome but you cannot flyer outside of the house, 
period. Remember, cig butts go in the trash, not my front yard or the 
street. Thanks.

Timeslots:

9-10: warm up and sound check (get'n crunk time)
10-11: still open if anyone wants to get on it
11-12: Marc (O) (Washington DC) and DeeJayB - Tag team break set.
12-1 DJ Resistance (house with some quick hands)
1-2 The Flank (a kick ass rock band from Santa Cruz)
2-3:30 The Doctor and DJ Arize (Tag team Jungle from two good friends and 
two great drinkers)
3:30-4:30 Joey Frisco (hard house, hard style, hard dance, who the fuck 
knows?)
after 4:30 open decks until everyone passes out or bitches out.

I guess that's is... If I work out some sort of time schedule for 
everything, I'll post it.

W3RD ^,
-Joey

PS, If you wanna get your swerve on and you need to crash here, it's cool; 
just bring some blankets or whatever and find a corner to crawl into  .

PPS, Bring stuff for jungle juice

PPPS, Don't fall asleep/passout with your shoes on or you will lose, period.

When Luna-C plays, to be honest, you never really know what you're going to 
get. He is an incredible DJ, who is really unafraid to cross between old 
school, new school, gabber, jungle, doesn't really matter, because he'll end 
up doing it. We've had him here 3 times in the past, and each time he's 
completely brought the house down! He's promised to have a set of insanity 
for this party, mainly because it's his birthday and he's excited to be 
playing on it, as he never has before. I'm more than sure everyone will 
appreciate Luna-C's crazy style!

that was so predictable how did i know one person was gonna get all mad and 
say "let him just jump" and another person would say "you don't even know what 
he was going through" no offence to anyone but how many people saw that coming 
a mile away? 

     I propose that we should just open up a new suicide lane on the bridge 
for people who just can't take the traffic you know? just drive off of the damn 
bridge into the water and get it over with. would speed up people communte by 
at least 20mins a day.

well, hey, let's *also* be realistic -- i *can* go overboard and be a 
real jackass and have no compassion when maybe sometimes i *ought* to.  
but i *am* tired of hearing about these things happening over, and 
over, and over.  doesn't it piss (some of) you off?  it makes *my* 
blood boil!   you don't hear about this stuff happening in other 
cities.

or do you?  it seems to me it's one of those "only in san francisco" 
things.  anyone?

btw, i was rolling (on the floor laughing, not rolling on ecstacy) when 
i read that 'suicide lane' idea.  did you know that someone actually 
did that on the bay bridge a couple years ago?  on the upper level, 
coming out of treasure island, in the left lane, if you look, there is 
something sort of like a ramp that someone used to successfully launch 
their car over the side into the water.  i think they have since tried 
to block that off, but anyway, your analogy of creating an entire lane 
for activities like that may not be too far off the mark!

We've added tons of info and our lineup is complete.  Check out the info at 
http://www.brproductions.net/BBS1/viewtopic.php?t=5530


or again, for the lazies...

C-ya tonight...

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(4/3/2004) Punch and Slip:A Jungle Juice House Party
Featuring The Flank from Santa Cruz, CA

***UPDATE***
Sound has been graciously provided by DJ Resistance. We will now be rockin' 
the neighborhood with some serious bump. DJ's who want to get a time slot 
instead of duke it out should IM or email me soon.


The Deal:
Free House party at my house for anyone who doesn't break shit and can 
respect a house. It's BYOB so come fully stocked (and bring extra for me  ). 
As long as everything goes according to plan there will be open decks for 
those who want to play (see below). We are having a band from Santa Cruz 
come and play as well.

The Catch:
* there is no catch... YAY!

Other Stuff:
We are having a band come through and play. They are The Flank from Santa 
Cruz. That's right people, a band, you know... with real instruments! They 
will probably play from 12-1 or 1-2, so come early and get your swerve on. 
Other than that, open decks but I'm going to reserve slots for people who 
get in touch with me so that we don't have the same issue we had last time. 
Respectful promoters are welcome to come through, but if you flyer any of 
the cars in the neighborhood I am going to put your face on a milk carton. 
Again, promoters are welcome but you cannot flyer outside of the house, 
period. Remember, cig butts go in the trash, not my front yard or the 
street. Thanks.

Timeslots:

9-10: warm up and sound check (get'n crunk time)
10-11: Hip Hop Happy Hour w/ John da Bomb (Humboldt)
11-12: Marc (O) (Washington DC) and DeeJayB - Tag team break set.
12-1 DJ Resistance (house with some quick hands)
1-2 The Flank (a kick ass rock band from Santa Cruz)
2-3:30 The Axis (The Doctor w/ DJ Arize aka Stalin w/ Musolini)
3:30-4:30 Joey Frisco (hard house, hard style, hard dance, who the fuck 
knows?)
4:30-5:30 DJ DelRo (house and/or NRG)
5:30-? you?

Directions:

>From the East: Take the Bay Bridge to 101, take 280 south towards daly city, 
keep going until you pass Ocean/Geneva exit, the next exit is Mission. Take 
Mission exit and take your first right around a chevron onto Sagamore, go 
two blocks and turn right on Capitol, go to blocks and turn left on Broad. 
Find parking.

>From The South: take 280 north and exit towards 19th avenue/ Golden Gate 
bridge, Take a right on 19th avenue (you need to be in the far right lane 
and you'll see a little ghetto gas station), follow the train tracks up 19th 
avenue and it will start to snake around, keep following the tracks until 
you get to Broad st. Find Parking.

>From the North: follow highway 1 down to 19th avenue, follow 19th avenue 
until you pass SFSU, get in the far left lane and continue straight accross 
the intersection where the three right lanes turn into 280 south (just 
follow the train tracks), follow the tracks until you get to Broad st, find 
parking.

The address is 243 Broad St, SF, CA 94112. Mapquest that shit if you can't 
figure it out. Peace.

I guess that's is... If I work out some sort of time schedule for 
everything, I'll post it.

W3RD ^,
-Joey

PS, If you wanna get your swerve on and you need to crash here, it's cool; 
just bring some blankets or whatever and find a corner to crawl into  .

PPS, Bring stuff for jungle juice

PPPS, Don't fall asleep/passout with your shoes on or you will lose, period.

 From Jeno of the Wicked collective:


"O.K.so as to avoid any speculation, and/or misunderstanding here are the 
facts....

There are no plans to throw a Wicked event again in San Francisco. Not now, 
not ever. There are no plans to do anything relating to Wicked in San 
Francisco, not now, not ever. Hence no more Wicked messageboard.

There will be a Wicked in L.A. on April 17th. This was booked and confirmed 
before the above scenario was discussed, so we decided to go ahead with it.

Markie is continuing to Dj, and is featured as a monthly resident out at 
the Oasis in Oakland once a month on a Sundays for Smartbeat.

Garth and myself are not hanging up our headphones either and will be 
residents at a new party called "The Cosmic Coconut" . It will happen every 
3rd Sunday of the month, at Bambuddha Lounge, from 4pm 'til at least 
midnight, and will begin in May. There will be food, and (depending on the 
weather) the party will be both indoor and out. Musically we will be 
broadening our selection to include just about anything we feel in the mood 
for, especially earlier in the evening. Don't expect anything less than a 
night of pure joyous expression and wickedly experimental moments from the 
pair of us... : )

They are the facts... o.k?

Beyond that I will only say that it's possible though not planned, that we 
will continue to perform as "Wicked" if we are booked together by an 
outside promoter, if it is uncomplicated to do, and seems appropriate. 
Let's just say for now that this is my disclaimer.

Of course none of this may apply if we collectively change our minds. I 
mean, who can predict the future, after all? No doubt it would only take a 
small change to create a big result, but that is not something I can 
conjure up, so I will stick with the facts."

"Security is mostly a superstition.  It does not exist in nature, nor do 
the children of humans as a whole experience it.  Avoiding danger is no 
safer in the long run than outright exposure.  Life is either a daring 
adventure or nothing."
-Helen Keller

The dangerous patriot: "The one who drifts into chauvinism and exhibits 
blind enthusiasm for military actions. He is a defender of militarism and 
its ideals of war and glory. Chauvinism is a proud and bellicose form of 
patriotism . . . which identifies numerous enemies who can only be dealt 
with through military power and which equates the national honor with 
military victory..."
-Marine Corps, Colonel James A. Donovan

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the 
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become 
visible."
-Jacques Attali in his seminal text "Noise"

--part1_14.260b94ee.2da11f80_boundary
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="US-ASCII"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Hey,
  Here is a quick survey/questionairre I am conducting to gather research for 
my school project.  My project is to design a resource web site for people 
who have a interest in becoming a DJ.  This web site will provide info and tips 
on topics such as equipment needs, setup, places to buy equipment, etc.     

This survey is intended for those who have NO DJing experience, but have an 
interest in learning about DJing and/or becoming a DJ.
IF you are a experienced DJ (1 + years experience), and would like to take 
the survey, please do so.  
BUT when taking the survey, please imagine yourself back BEFORE you were a DJ 
trying to learn the ropes.

Here goes:

1) Do you know anyone who is a DJ?
a) Yes
b) No

2) If you wanted to learn how to DJ, which topics would be helpful to you in 
gaining more information about DJing?
Please check all that apply
a) Basic DJ equipment needs
b) Equipment setup
c) Places to purchase DJ equipment (online stores, national chain stores)
d) Price comparisons for equipment
e) Places to buy records (both online and local)
f) Intrstrucitonal help (tips,exercises on mixing etc.)
g) Reviews on equipment, videos
h) Places for CD/mixtape duplication (to make promo mixtapes/CDs etc)
i) Other (Please list any topics you wish could be covered if not listed 
above)

Please send answers back to my e-mail address.  
Thank you for your time.

Thanks to those who made it out to Punch and Slip last night... I had a 
really good time and I'm glad others did as well.  A special thanks to 
Maro(O), The Flank, Axis, Achilles, Resistance, DJ DelRo, and DJ Wavelength 
for making it out and playing.  It was great tagging with Steven (achilles) 
and listening to all the other great dj's.  You all rocked the ghetto like 
nobody's business.  Again, thanks and I'll see y'all at the next one.

THE TROUBLE WITH MARIJUANA AND LEGISLATORS
Bruce Mirken, AlterNet

Lawmakers think that supporting medical marijuana is a
radical move that will get them in trouble. It's not, and
it won't.

*In DrugReporter: http://www.alternet.org/drugreporter/


"Many persons have a wrong idea of what constitutes true happiness.  It is 
not attained through self-gratification, but through fidelity to a purpose."
-Helen Keller

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the 
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become 
visible."
-Jacques Attali in his seminal text "Noise"

"I loved the focus in the early days of Wicked on the pagan aspects of 
life. The natural cycles of the full moons, being out in nature, on the 
beach, free, alive, unbridled, wild and spontaneous. There is no club, 
party or other sound system that has ever achieved anything close to that..."
-Jeno, on the early days of Wicked and the Full Moon Raves

Subject: [sfraves] NRR: movie review "Eternal Sunshine..."

Am I the only one who has seen this flick yet???

I was HIGHLY impressed. The story itself isn't anything groundbreaking 
really, but the format of the movie, the cinematography, and the effects are 
astounding. It was like being in someone else's dream.

I have seen "dream sequences" and movies that were supposed to show what a 
dream is like - but never have I seen one that really captures the feel of 
one like Eternal Sunshine does.

I dunno - maybe it's just me. I loved it though.

I would expound, but it's really a "you have to see it for yourself" type of 
movie.

Anyone else see it? Thoughts? Opinions?

M-

I saw it and also thoroughly enjoyed it, as I have all Charlie
Kaufman-penned films (I haven't seen Human Nature yet, though).  Beyond
its trippiness, I felt it was also a good love story; my girlfriend was
crying at the end, and even my heart of stone had melted a bit.  =P

Real news coverage has always taken a back seat to revenue when it comes
to commercial news outlets.  Where's the revenue stream?  By reporting
anti-legalization stories they don't risk losing the money from the
anti-drug ads sponsored by the gov't.

If the med. mar. lobby could rack up debt like our gov't, there'd be
plenty of ads and plenty of news stories.

BMW M3 grabbed the rusty knife OJ Simpson used on his wife and stabbed the 
fetus.In the back of daddy G's head he was think "Stupid people do not need to be 
breading, take that and that (Slash,Gash)"  Now Daddy G turns his IPOD up 
really lound and dose the moon walk out of the crime scene. ha ha ha.....!!!!

Rocktronica shines through Crystal Method's prism
By Dave Wedge, Boston Herald
Monday, April 5, 2004

Count Ken Jordan of the Crystal Method among those who won't be casting a 
vote for George Bush in the upcoming election. But it isn't because of 
rising unemployment, health-care woes or the increasingly bloody war in Iraq.

      It's because, he says, the president killed the rave scene.

      ``The whole thing with the Bush administration and the (anti-rave 
legislation) had a chilling effect,'' Jordan said. ``It's made (promoters) 
afraid to do big shows and big raves. That's been terrible for (the scene).''

      Hatched in Los Angeles in the mid-1990s, the Crystal Method came up 
playing renegade warehouse parties and un-permitted massives, but it all 
came to a crashing halt in the late 1990s when the government, reacting to 
a spate of club-drug deaths, cracked down on raves. Gone now are the days 
of gargantuan underground bashes in rural fields and secluded metal 
buildings, replaced by corporate-sponsored package tours and club dates.

      ``Everything is super-legitimate now, in big clubs. Nothing really 
has an underground feel to it anymore,'' Jordan continued. ``Some parts of 
that are good, but the underground has to thrive, or overall (the scene) is 
really going to be hurting.''

      The Crystal Method has pressed on despite a fickle music industry 
that boldly touted electronic music as ``the next big thing,'' only to 
write its obituary just as quickly. Jordan and his partner-in-crime, Scott 
Kirkland, bring their ``Legion of Boom'' tour to Boston's Avalon on Tuesday.

      ``We'd rather not be in any category,'' Jordan explained during a 
recent phone interview from Myrtle Beach, S.C. ``We always sound like 
ourselves. Our sound sort of changes over time. We like to make Crystal 
Method tracks but we don't get caught up in subgenres. It's all music to us.''

      Live, the pair are like mad scientists, unleashing their signature 
big beat sound from behind a wall of keyboards, samplers, turntables and 
other digital weapons. Last month, the pair cleaned up at the Dancestar 
Music Awards at the Miami Winter Music Conference - electronic music's 
equivalent of the Grammys - taking home best act, best single and best 
album for ``Legion of Boom.''

      Like its Brit brethren the Chemical Brothers and the Prodigy, the 
Crystal Method walk a fine line between dance and alternative rock, equally 
inspiring break dancers and dwellers of the mosh pit. ``Legion of Boom'' 
also dabbles in hip-hop, with two cameos by rapper Rahzel of the Roots.

      ``We've always sort of wanted to be in with all the other acts that 
are on normal modern rock radio,'' Jordan said, naming Foo Fighters among 
the band's prime influences. ``We're sort of underground, sort of a dance 
act, but we're also sort of an alternative rock band.''

      The band's so-called ``rocktronica'' formula is on full display on 
the massive ``Weapons of Mass Distortion'' and ``Born Too Slow,'' both of 
which prominently feature the gigantic guitar work of ex-Limp Bizkit axman 
Wes Borland. Jordan and Kirkland laid the groundwork for the collaboration 
back in 1999, when Limp Bizkit and the Crystal Method were on the Family 
Values Tour.

      ``We're just trying to make cool music and whole albums,'' Jordan 
said. ``The main thing we're looking for is emotion. We're looking for that 
sound that gives us goosebumps.''

"I loved the focus in the early days of Wicked on the pagan aspects of 
life. The natural cycles of the full moons, being out in nature, on the 
beach, free, alive, unbridled, wild and spontaneous. There is no club, 
party or other sound system that has ever achieved anything close to that..."

Subject: [sfraves] NRR: Canada: Downloading MP3's Not Copyright Infringement

http://news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&u=/ap/20040401/ap_en_mu/canada_music_swapping_2


TORONTO - A Canadian federal court ruled Wednesday (April 3) against a
motion that would have let the music industry begin suing individuals who
share copyright music on the Internet.


Justice Konrad von Finckenstein ruled that the Canadian Recording Industry
Association did not prove copyright infringement by 29 "music uploaders."


He said downloading a song or making files available in shared
directories, as facilitated by the popular "peer-to-peer" Kazaa service,
does not constitute copyright infringement under Canadian law.


"No evidence was presented that the alleged infringers either distributed
or authorized the reproduction of sound recordings," von Finckenstein
wrote. "They merely placed personal copies into their shared directories
which were accessible by other computer users via a P2P service."


He compared the action to a photocopy machine in a library. "I cannot see
a real difference between a library that places a photocopy machine in a
room full of copyrighted material and a computer user that places a
personal copy on a shared directory linked to a P2P service," he said.


The recording industry has argued that it, and likewise artists, have
suffered billions of dollars in lost revenue as tens of millions of people
have turned the Internet into a music-swapping bazaar.


In the United States, the Recording Industry Association of America has
launched almost 2,000 lawsuits against file swappers since last year. The
RIAA has settled some 400 cases, generally for a few thousand dollars
each.


The Canadian ruling is similar to a U.S. court setback for the recording
industry in its campaign of legal intimidation to discourage online
file-swapping. In December, a U.S. appeals court ruled that the industry
can't force Internet providers to identify file-swappers unless they first
file a lawsuit.


Just as that made the process of identifying defendants more cumbersome,
so does the Canadian judge's decision.


The Canadian Recording Industry Association took five Internet service
providers, including Bell Canada, Rogers Cable and Shaw Communications, to
Federal Court last month, trying to force the companies to hand over the
names and addresses of 29 people who allegedly shared hundreds of songs
with others last November and December.


The individuals are currently identifiable only through a numeric Internet
address and user handles, and the association can't begin civil litigation
the alleged offenders are identified.


The judge's denial of the recording industry's request means Internet
providers won't have to divulge their client list.


The Canadian Recording Industry Association's lawyer said the group
expected to appeal and said Canadian law needs to be altered to reflect
technological change.


"In our view, the copyright law in Canada does not allow people to put
hundreds or thousands of music files on the Internet for copying,
transmission and distribution to millions of strangers," said attorney
Richard Pfohl.


University of Ottawa professor Michael Geist, who specializes in Internet
and e-commerce law, anticipates the decision will push the industry to
increase its lobbying efforts for copyright reform.

Digital music: what's in store?

By Jonny Evans

The music piracy debate has intensified once again, following controversial 
court decisions and a report released last week by Harvard Business School, 
and industry trends suggest the music business may eventually be forced to 
change.

The <http://www.macworld.co.uk/news/main_news.cfm?NewsID=8303>Harvard 
report disputes record industry claims that file-sharing has impacted 
against sales; calling the impact of file sharing "statistically 
insignificant". It suggests that competing entertainment formats; economic 
worries; limited breadth of music releases and the end of the vinyl to CD 
upgrade cycle have had more impact against music sales than file sharing.

The Canadian high court last week declared that music fans downloading 
songs using peer-to-peer services are 
<http://www.macworld.co.uk/news/main_news.cfm?NewsID=8332>not breaking 
local copyright law; and a Florida court also last week 
<http://www.macworld.co.uk/news/main_news.cfm?NewsID=8356>denied music 
labels attempt to extract personal information about file sharers from a 
local ISP. The Canadian decision is subject to change.

These revelations arrive as the music business prepares to extend its legal 
action against file-sharers internationally.

Commenting on the Harvard report, International Federation of Phonographic 
Industries (IFPI) chairman and CEO Jay Berman told 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/online/story/0,3605,1185973,00.html>The 
Guardian: "If I listened to that study my business would have improved."

It appears the music industry remains blinkered to the Harvard researchers' 
alternative explanations for falling music sales, preferring to continue 
its tactic of demonizing file sharers as the business attempts to maintain 
its grip on the means of music production and distribution.

P2P United chair Wayne Rosso counters: "The recording industry is so 
completely misguided in its use of fear tactics that it can only engender 
even more contempt from fans. And what's even more ridiculous is that 
they're all profitable and their business is up, in part due to the free 
marketing they get from P2P networks. They should be paying us!"

Europe is ripe for digital music sales. Online music service OD2 
<http://www.macworld.co.uk/news/main_news.cfm?NewsID=8337>sold one million 
tracks in Europe in the first quarter of this year. Support for licensed 
music-download services are an essential element to the music labels' 
strategic plan for dealing with digital music – litigation without a viable 
legal alternative can only be counter-productive. Berman observed: "I want 
iTunes, Real and Napster here as soon as possible. I'm trying more than 
ever for a licence on behalf of all these services."

Leave me alone

However, artists and music fans are increasingly vexed by the music label's 
litigious tactics. And this is creating an interesting phenomenon. Artists 
are going it alone online.

Blur drummer Dave Rowntree is furious at music industry plans to litigate 
music fans, telling New Media Age: "It's preposterous". And the 
professional musician is not convinced that file-sharing music fans buy 
fewer records. "How do they know?" he asked.

Musicians are turning to the Internet in an attempt to create an 
alternative ways to make a living than working with the established music 
business, and since that business is built on artists' talent, it appears 
that its control of the means of production may be under attack.

George Michael last month 
<http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/music/3499534.stm>announced plans 
to dump the music business, promising never to make another album for 
retail sale. Michael will instead make future releases available online to 
fans in exchange for charitable donations.

Explaining this decision, he said it would take him out of the music 
industry mechanism, which requires artists create new song collections 
every "so many" years, "which nearly killed me," he said.

Music-business contracts commit artists to certain release cycles. For 
example, a musician can have created a collection of songs across many 
years before winning a record deal. They then find themselves committed to 
a gruelling touring cycle, and to a record release every year.

This creates the phenomenon of the difficult second album, as artists 
attempt to manage more fame and commitments while struggling to find the 
inspiration to create new music in order to fulfill their contract. 
Commercial realities can arguably transform artists into musical battery 
hens, and dampen the quality of their art.

Thank you for the music

In recent weeks, both Metallica – renowned for their litigation against 
Napster – and The Bare Naked Ladies have begun their own experiments with 
digital distribution – experiments that could lead musicians toward 
more-autonomous futures.

While both remain committed to their existing labels, the acts are making 
MP3s of their live shows available from their Web sites for sale to fans.

Metallica's unedited soundboard recordings cost $9.95 as MP3s and 
<http://www.livemetallica.com/>are available here. The band is also making 
FLAC (an alternative higher-quality digital music file format) downloads 
available for $12.95. Downloadable CD labels – including tray and front 
cover inserts are also supplied, along with special booklets. The band is 
currently engaged on a mammoth North American tour, and each gig is made 
available within days of its taking place.

Bare Naked Ladies are offering recordings from up to 80 per cent of their 
shows for download, as MP3s with cover art ($13.99), or on CD ($20). The 
band sold over 35,000 songs in the first week of the experiment, with 
downloads outselling physical CDs by two-to-one, reports claim. While 
existing label Warner takes a slice of those sales, the band gets three 
times the royalties it accrues from studio albums.

These actions show that established musicians are already in position to 
make a profit online.

BPI representative Steve Redmond said the Metallica and Bare Naked Ladies 
actions show what can be done using the Internet for copyright holders: 
"This is bands profiting from their own copyrighted music."

He added: "Some people have come up with the idea that the music business 
is against the Internet. That's absolutely not true. But artists still need 
to be paid for what they do."

Culture shock at the power exchange

Other recent innovations from the creative community hint at future 
developments in music. The recent story of the 
<http://www.wired.com/news/digiwood/0,1412,62372,00.html>Grey Album shows 
how the Internet fundamentally changes music distribution and control.

The Grey Album in brief: DJ Danger Mouse remixed the vocals from Jay-Z's 
The Black Album and the Beatles' White Album and called his creation The 
Grey Album. He sent about 3,000 promos out, until EMI told him to stop. 
However, Internet activists continue to make the Grey Album available online.

The Beatles and Metallica pop-up once again in another recent online 
happening, Beatallica, a pair of anonymous musicians who play Beatles songs 
in the style of Metallica.

The songs are made available free, and the musicians concerned hope to 
avoid legal action from Metallica or Beatles lawyers by remaining 
anonymous. It appears popular – since the release of the second album last 
week the official site has run out of bandwidth.

Break on through

Is it possible we are seeing the creation of a 'third estate' for music, 
opening the doors to new creative expression accompanied by a need to 
create new economic models. EMI's move to 
<http://www.macworld.co.uk/news/main_news.cfm?NewsID=8324>axe 1,500 jobs 
last week shows change is in the air. The company intends further focusing 
itself on a smaller roster of large artists.

Existing legal music download services are experimenting with the new 
territory. Apple's iTunes Music Store, for instance, has begun selling 
exclusive live shows – some recorded at Apple's own retail stores. The 
company is also offering pre-release tracks, for example from popular US 
novelty act <http://biz.yahoo.com/prnews/040322/nym103_1.html>William Hung.

The music business is reluctantly going through growing pains, as artists, 
consumers and the business itself renegotiate its business proposition, and 
the labels attempt to cling to control.

As Karl Marx once wrote: "Wherever a part of society possesses a monopoly 
of the means of production, the labourer must add to the working-time 
necessary for his own maintenance an extra working-time in order to produce 
the means of subsistence for the owners of the means of production."

"I loved the focus in the early days of Wicked on the pagan aspects of 
life. The natural cycles of the full moons, being out in nature, on the

when i dance at the party i get looks & stares
they're looking at me but there's nobody there
i move to the sound of chirps blips and glitches
my limbs seem to disapear then reapear, twitches
i vibrate to beats that are too fast for effect
then pause to the silence like a nervous insect
never an arrogant smile for a dance move well done
not one nerv of pride because i have none
anxiety flows through my bones like a circut
i can hit every beat of the sound how i work it
i count up to zero and become one with the void
my soul is binary like a tribal android...

PROMOTERS!!!!!!!!
Reid Speed - Breakbeat Science - LA
Simon - Buzzlife, Sleaze, Redux-XM Radio - DC

I'm sure a lot of you know Reid Speed - she's one of the hottest (take that 
as you may) female D&B dj's around. Simon is a personal friend of mine from 
Washington DC, and a DJ I respect enormously. These two kids are booking 
dates for the "Something Different" tour right now, and were interested in 
seeing if anyone on the area might be willing to procure their services for 
an evening. Since Simon is my boy, I figured I'd check here and see if 
anyone might be interested...

Simon spins a blend of techno, electro, breaks and more. For this tour Reid 
Speed is spinning techno & breaks.

I'm pretty sure this would be one helluva show...don't sleep on these two!!! 
Hit me off list for more details...

Subject: [sfraves] SRR: Headshells needed! 

Anyone have an extra pair of headshells that will fit Stanton/Shure needles 
that they'd be willing to sell me?

I'm abandoning Ortofons for the 1st time and switching to "other"carts, and 
prefer to deal direct with people rather than waiting for some online place 
to send 'em to me.

Anyhoo - if someone gots 'em, and wants to sell - hit me up!!!

Marc(O)

Subject: [sfraves] NRR: Politician-Speak Translated

"In our time, political speech and writing are largely the defense of
the indefensible... Thus, political language has to consist largely of
euphemism, question-begging, and sheer cloudy vagueness... Political
language [is] designed to make lies sound truthful and murder
respectable."

-- George Orwell, "Politics and the English Language," 1945. 

***********************************************************************

Politician-Speak Translated
by former Libertarian Party News editor Bill Winter

Libertarians have long pointed out that when politicians talk about
"cuts" in government spending, they usually don't mean an actual
decrease, as understood by (non-politician) human beings. Instead,
they mean that government spending won't increase quite as fast as
they hoped it would.

This creative use of English was brought into sharp focus in a March 1
article in USA Today. The article noted that last year, government
experts widely predicted that a downturn in tax revenues would force
states to cut 1 million people from Medicaid rolls. In fact, USA Today
reported, enrollment in the government-subsidized health insurance
program *rose* by 1.6 million in 2003.

So, how did a "cut" turn out to be a huge increase? Stephen Heffler,
an economist (and federal employee) at the Centers for Medicare and
Medicaid Services, took a stab at explaining it.

Said Heffler: "Sometimes people get confused when they hear the word
'cut,' and they think there is an actual reduction in spending or
enrollment."

Well, that explains things. Let's see if we've got this right: When a
politician promises an "increase" in government spending or a
government program, he really means an increase. When he says it will
remain "stable," he really means an increase. And when he threatens a
"cut," he really means an increase.

Thanks, Mr. Heffler! We're not confused anymore.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] email viruses from sfr peeps?

yknow

a lil while ago, I was getting emails to my normally used @hard-grooves.com
email accounts, from "management" & administration@hard-grooves.com saying
that I need to follow this link (that looks like it'll go to my site but
doesn't) to read the rest of the message. I was getting several of those,
and it even had my actual web address, but the management and admin
addresses don't exist.
now, I'm getting defaulted emails (anything to hard-grooves.com comes to me
if there isn't an address with that name) sent to those administration, and
management email addresses with lots of other viruses, saying things in the
body of the message like
+++something something Virus protection
+++virus free

makes me wonder who has access to fraudulent emails, that is sending other
fraudulent emails. . .

and just today, like out of 40 messages there were 6-7 viruses, mostly all
to my ak addy thats just subbed to these lists. . .

I think I pissed off a indonesian credit fraud group. . . kinda did it on
purpose tho. . .


: )

Subject: Re: [sfraves] email viruses from sfr peeps?

someone like osby (sorry dood - you've had some issues with this before)
that has just about everyone on this list in his address book is infected.
The virus randomly takes the contacts from the user's addy book and then
emails you with an attachment that's viral. If you open it, and don't have
Norton, or the like, running you start sending out emails the same way.

It's very annoying that people out there can't be smart enough to have an
anti-virus application running to prevent such things from occuring. An
annoyance on par with spammers.

House Anti-Narcotics Chairman Reacts Strongly to Ecstasy Promotion by ABC, 
Jennings
By Jimmy Moore
Talon News
April 6, 2004

WASHINGTON (Talon News) -- Rep. Mark Souder (R-IN), the House 
anti-narcotics chairman, reacted strongly to the
reporting on an illegal drug by ABC News anchorman Peter Jennings.

Souder responded to comments he read in the Palm Beach Post by Jennings 
last week regarding the popular mind-
altering drug Ecstasy.

Jennings said he was concerned that claims by the U.S. government that 
Ecstasy is unsafe are exaggerated, causing
young people to question any information provided in the future.

"Government is best when government is most honest, especially for the 
younger generation, which is more susceptible
to trying drugs," Jennings remarked to the Palm Beach Post. "If they can't 
rely on the government for good and
honest information, then government has lost something enormously valuable, 
which is people's belief in the
government's credibility."

In a one-hour news special that aired last Thursday called "Peter Jennings 
Reporting: Ecstasy Rising," Jennings
examined the government's futile record for slowing the distribution of the 
pills.

"This was an opportunity for us to look at whether or not the government 
isn't its own worst enemy in trying to
control illegal drugs," Jennings explained to the Palm Beach Post regarding 
the show.

Promoting the benefits of Ecstasy rather than the dangers in his show, 
Jennings said he is not concerned at all that
this will pique the interest of young people to try the illegal drug.

"It can't be a concern," Jennings said regarding young people wanting to 
try Ecstasy. "Our job is to lay out the
facts."

Souder said he could not believe a well-known news anchor like Jennings 
would make such comments about a drug that
has been banned in the United States since 1985.

"I'm outraged by the irresponsible comments that [Jennings] made in advance 
of its airing," Souder exclaimed. "Their
appalling nature does not leave me optimistic about the veracity and good 
intentions of the 'production' he's
touting."

Using his experience dealing with anti-narcotics issues in Congress, Souder 
said the research conducted by Jennings
and ABC is severely flawed.

"Jennings exposes a great deal about his own selective research methods 
when he claims that the government's
'science was not good,'" Souder states. "Countless studies have proven that 
Ecstasy is far from a benign drug."

He added, "[R]eams of evidence demonstrate that Ecstasy causes brain damage 
and even death."

As for the carefree manner that Jennings conducted this program, Souder 
said the lack of a moral compass by the ABC
news anchor is especially disturbing.

"If Jennings' nonchalant comments about this dangerous drug are indicative 
of the outlook of his 'special,' then he
is misleading his viewers," Souder remarked. "To make matters worse, 
Jennings appears to have no moral qualms about
offering the American public what the Palm Beach Post cast as 'a glossy, 
late-night infomercial.'"

Questioning the motives of Jennings' reporting of this story, Souder said 
Jennings needed to look into the subject
further.

"Jennings somehow believes that his take on Ecstasy is tantamount to 
'lay[ing] out the facts.' But how much does
Jennings actually know about the facts?," Souder commented.

Providing an example of how Ecstasy has caused harm, Souder challenged 
Jennings to show the whole truth about the
negative effects of Ecstasy to complete his story.

"In 2002, I heard testimony from the mother of 23-year-old Kelley Baker who 
died of an Ecstasy overdose," Souder
noted. "Will Jennings' 'special' offer the facts about Ecstasy's effects on 
her young life?"

Subject: Re: [sfraves] email viruses from sfr peeps?

It's not enough to have an anti-virus program running. There are new
variants of these viruses coming out faster than then anti-virus vendors
can keep up. It usually takes a day or more for the vendors to update
their virus database, and in that time period you're vulnerable to the new
virus. The bottom line is, don't run any attachments, especially if you're
on windows. Even if the return address is someone you know. Even if it
claims to be from your system administrator. Even if it says that it's
"scanned virus free". Just don't do it.

Keep in mind that a lot of the mail is probably spoofed.
That is, it may not be coming from who is in the headers.

Except, of course, for the new virii that don't even require the
attachment to be manually executed - just for the email to be read. 

Big ups to Windows security.

It's not enough to have an anti-virus program running. There are new
variants of these viruses coming out faster than then anti-virus vendors
can keep up. It usually takes a day or more for the vendors to update
their virus database, and in that time period you're vulnerable to the
new
virus. The bottom line is, don't run any attachments, especially if
you're
on windows. Even if the return address is someone you know. Even if it
claims to be from your system administrator. Even if it says that it's
"scanned virus free". Just don't do it.

Hey, all on the SFRAVES list!=20

What's the big (bitchy) deal on SFraves? Why are we making fun of =
someone who can't spell correctly?=20

I have a college degree in English with a specialty in editing, but I =
still want to dance beside Warren someday before I leave this email list =

non-fiction messages from me in the next month because I have a lot to =

In the past, Warren has asked me to help him edit his postings. I =

I feel that this list should continue discussions about raving, =

Subject: [sfraves] Dancing in the dark with candles [was:sfraves Tribal Android]

I don't know how to thank you except via a public reply to this list.

Your poem expressed my daily emotional sentiments.

I dance at the park on weekdays, by using a Rebok Step or a PowerSlide (thus
guaranteeing strange stares from bystanders), but I also dance in the dark
with candles (at home), with no one around to see my silly expressions.

Your poem moved me to tears.

Yes, I feel like an android when I am expressing dance movements without
inhibitions.
(at home or at at raves)

Sincerely,
Greg VP

when i dance at the party i get looks & stares
they're looking at me but there's nobody there
i move to the sound of chirps blips and glitches
my limbs seem to disapear then reapear, twitches
i vibrate to beats that are too fast for effect
then pause to the silence like a nervous insect
never an arrogant smile for a dance move well done
not one nerv of pride because i have none
anxiety flows through my bones like a circut
i can hit every beat of the sound how i work it
i count up to zero and become one with the void
my soul is binary like a tribal android...

Subject: [sfraves] Second Wind

 
Hey sfraves,

I just finished uploading a new mix to my website, http://jl.halogen.org ,
it's called "Second Wind" it's a mixture of breaks and progresive house.
Download it and give it a listen.  Also, I'm spinning @ Uplift this Thursday
which is at Sublounge (628 20th & 3rd Street).   Dj's for the evening are:

jauncy & sheztek - 8:15-10:45
jason lee - 10:45-12
danny & sir nod - 12-2 tag

If you come, be prepared to sweat ;).

Also, if you come and want a copy of any of my mixes on CD, shoot me an
email, I can burn you a copy and give it to you at Sublounge.

See you Thursday!

Jason

Subject: Re: [sfraves] email viruses from sfr peeps?

That email that is going around that appears to be from staff@whatever.com
or
management@whatever.com
and sports an attachment (usually .pif) is a strain of the
Netsky worm.

The relevant information on the worm as well as a removal tool for any of
our customers who were infected is available here:

http://securityresponse.symantec.com/avcenter/venc/data/w32.netsky.d@mm.html

The updated Norton Antivirus & MacAfee definitions include the ability to
detect this
virus, so if the affected customer has it installed update the definitions
and run a scan.

You can also set up spam filters to block the email
address of staff@whatever.com  or management@whatever.com unless you
expect mail from that address.

Subject: RE: [sfraves] SRR: *especially TRANCE* Defending my friend, Warren

I don't have a problem with Warren at all personally, but I have to admit, 
trying to read some of his posts actually hurts my brain. It was like trying 
to read "Osby-speak" for the firts few times ;)

I think most people just can't see why a simple "spell check" can't be used.

Whatever tho - at least this list talks about music some of the time, unlike 
my hometown list DCRaves, which tends to get stuck on political threads 
where it's two different factions repeating the same arguments over and over 
for 100 posts or more.

*shudder*

Now who wants to go see some breaks with me tomorrow night?!?!?!!? 
BREAKBEATS FOOLS!!!!

House Anti-Narcotics Chairman Reacts Strongly to Ecstasy Promotion by =
ABC,=20
Jennings
By Jimmy Moore
Talon News
April 6, 2004

WASHINGTON (Talon News) -- Rep. Mark Souder (R-IN), the House=20
anti-narcotics chairman, reacted strongly to the
reporting on an illegal drug by ABC News anchorman Peter Jennings.

Souder responded to comments he read in the Palm Beach Post by Jennings=20
last week regarding the popular mind-
altering drug Ecstasy.

Jennings said he was concerned that claims by the U.S. government that=20
Ecstasy is unsafe are exaggerated, causing
young people to question any information provided in the future.

"Government is best when government is most honest, especially for the=20
younger generation, which is more susceptible
to trying drugs," Jennings remarked to the Palm Beach Post. "If they =
can't=20
rely on the government for good and
honest information, then government has lost something enormously =
valuable,=20
which is people's belief in the
government's credibility."

In a one-hour news special that aired last Thursday called "Peter =
Jennings=20
Reporting: Ecstasy Rising," Jennings
examined the government's futile record for slowing the distribution of =
the=20
pills.

"This was an opportunity for us to look at whether or not the government =

isn't its own worst enemy in trying to
control illegal drugs," Jennings explained to the Palm Beach Post =
regarding=20
the show.

Promoting the benefits of Ecstasy rather than the dangers in his show,=20
Jennings said he is not concerned at all that
this will pique the interest of young people to try the illegal drug.

"It can't be a concern," Jennings said regarding young people wanting to =

try Ecstasy. "Our job is to lay out the
facts."

Souder said he could not believe a well-known news anchor like Jennings=20
would make such comments about a drug that
has been banned in the United States since 1985.

"I'm outraged by the irresponsible comments that [Jennings] made in =
advance=20
of its airing," Souder exclaimed. "Their
appalling nature does not leave me optimistic about the veracity and =
good=20
intentions of the 'production' he's
touting."

Using his experience dealing with anti-narcotics issues in Congress, =
Souder=20
said the research conducted by Jennings
and ABC is severely flawed.

"Jennings exposes a great deal about his own selective research methods=20
when he claims that the government's
'science was not good,'" Souder states. "Countless studies have proven =
that=20
Ecstasy is far from a benign drug."

He added, "[R]eams of evidence demonstrate that Ecstasy causes brain =
damage=20
and even death."

As for the carefree manner that Jennings conducted this program, Souder=20
said the lack of a moral compass by the ABC
news anchor is especially disturbing.

"If Jennings' nonchalant comments about this dangerous drug are =
indicative=20
of the outlook of his 'special,' then he
is misleading his viewers," Souder remarked. "To make matters worse,=20
Jennings appears to have no moral qualms about
offering the American public what the Palm Beach Post cast as 'a glossy, =

late-night infomercial.'"

Questioning the motives of Jennings' reporting of this story, Souder =
said=20
Jennings needed to look into the subject
further.

"Jennings somehow believes that his take on Ecstasy is tantamount to=20
'lay[ing] out the facts.' But how much does
Jennings actually know about the facts?," Souder commented.

Providing an example of how Ecstasy has caused harm, Souder challenged=20
Jennings to show the whole truth about the
negative effects of Ecstasy to complete his story.

"In 2002, I heard testimony from the mother of 23-year-old Kelley Baker =
who=20
died of an Ecstasy overdose," Souder
noted. "Will Jennings' 'special' offer the facts about Ecstasy's effects =
on=20
her young life?"

Grammar and spelling are key to communicating effectively. That's why you
have the job that you do. No one would read anything from you and treat it
as credible information if you didn't have the capacity to spell and from
grammatically correct sentences. The excuses of "it's an email list" or
"it's just aim" are complete bullshit. In any forum that uses written
communication your ability to communicate accurately *does* have a bearing
on your perceived intelligence and credibility.

Does spelling and grammar have anything to do with dancing? No, they do not.
When one is out dancing he//she is not participating in an online forum that
revolves around written communication. When that person decides to send an
email to a forum, be it rave related or otherwise, that email is
representative of you. If you have horrible grammar and spelling you present
yourself in a manner that's not conducive to being intelligent or credible.

Emotions and plur-like thinking aside, that is the real world truth.

Hey, all on the SFRAVES list!

I know that y'all have issues with spelling and with trance addicts. Well, I
want to defend my friend, Warren, who posts on this list as
DJBigDaddyG@aol.com.

I met Warren back when he posted on the MokshaTribe list in a moment of
great excitement (he was happy to be invited by Apollo).

What's the big (bitchy) deal on SFraves? Why are we making fun of someone
who can't spell correctly?

I have a college degree in English with a specialty in editing, but I still
want to dance beside Warren someday before I leave this email list and this
region of the country. In fact, you will be hearing more non-fiction
messages from me in the next month because I have a lot to say about raving
and American lifestyles.

In the past, Warren has asked me to help him edit his postings. I actually
edited a few of these, but I strongly feel that your English or grammar
habits have no significance to raving if you want to tell the World how you
feel.

I feel that this list should continue discussions about raving, regardless
of email filters and significant law-making authorities (spies).

Therefore, this message is a defense of Warren. I have a new personal tag
line, for as long as I am raving,

"Trance puts the prance in your dance."

In addition, I mean it, sincerely,

Greg VP

well, i just thought of "breaded stupid people" and laughed.

i mean, if you're gonna come down on "stupid people", you'd better be 
damn sure you're not one of them first. (or as ryan said - at least 
make sure you're not perceived as one because of your terrible 
spelling)

Breaded??? :)

I'm not sure how old Warren is, but I'm guessing he's quite a bit older
than the age one perceives from reading his posts.  (And like Marc(o),
my brain often hurts afterwards as a result.)

Soylent green is made out of people... who can't spell.

Ryan voiced an opinion that I've been thinking about for the last few
weeks of my participation on a message board with quite a few more bad
spellers and grammatical manhandlers than the Hyperreal list.  In some
places the English language is becoming horribly corroded from instant
messengers and rapid-fire discussion threads... not to mention poor
education in the language or an indifference to learning good writing
style.

If someone wants to be taken seriously in a forum of the written word, one
must write well.  There may be valuable thoughts behind the words, but
unless we can read those words without getting confused or getting a
migraine, those thoughts won't be communicated.

Hi, as usual in a debate, I feel that everybody is write ... oops, "right"  
:)  ... to some degree. Like Greg, I make my living editing the mistakes that 
other people make when writing, so in a way I have a vested interest in the 
continued misuse and abuse of the English language by so many people. 

I think what we're witnessing is the fallout from the "Hooked on Phonics" 
phenomenon. In the past, many kids who were not solid in language skills felt 
awkward about expressing themselves. Phonics encouraged them to go ahead and 
write, with less emphasis on correct spelling and other emphases of older methods. 
That's great, up to a point -- eventually kids should learn how to spell 
correctly because, as Ryan says, people will not take them seriously if their 
language is severely mangled.  We see with some SFR members an exuberance about 
self-expression that would be welcome, except that the spelling and grammatical 
choices do indeed make the brain hurt at times. 

It's all a matter of degree. I don't think that the population, in general, 
spells as well as in the past. Many of the posts on SFR contain spelling or 
grammatical mistakes, but if they are below a certain threshhold, readibility is 
not threatened. Very many posts contain words that pass a spellchecker but are 
in fact the "wrong word," such as "their" vs. "they're." The spelling of many 
words is only a guess; for example, "feening" (as in desiring something) is 
really spelled "fiending" (as in "drug fiend"). A common mistake, even found in 
many publications, is the word "phased" (meaning affected) when it really 
should be "fazed." Even the best grammarians will leave in small mistakes and 
uncapitalized letters, knowing that they are communicating well enough to be 
understood, especially in the informal realm of online media. 

I recommend to everyone not to be too reliant on spellchecking. Spellcheckers 
are the front-line soldiers in the war against bad English but they're not 
the whole solution. For those who really have a lot of difficulty with written 
language, I recommend classes at a local community college or a similar 
program. Your ability to communicate really does affect your chances of success in 
life. 

I have not yet met Warren in person but he seems to be a very sincere and 
warm person who has only the best intentions. In a way, I'm reminded of a 
friend's younger brother who is always eager and wants to tag along all the time. You 
might get annoyed that he can't communicate in a more polished way, but you 
can't really get mad at him for being himself. 

that's my Too Sense     :)

This reminds me of a grammer issue that I had to do lots of research to =
figure out since no one seems to really know:

What is the correct usages of "effect" vs. "affect".

Effect is not for human use. Affect is for when a chemical affects you =
and you feel the effects. Got it?=20

"affect" is a verb and "effect" is a noun.

My grammer is really good until I take too much cough syrup, I'm sure =
many other users of this list have similar problems.

That's true, except when talking about "effecting a change," meaning "to 
bring about a change."  Then "effect" is a verb.  A lot of writers, especially in 
newspapers, don't get this right.

i was just laughing as well.

i don't think anyone was being bitchy, i think we were all
poking some harmless fun.  if i misspell something, i expect to
get ribbed for it too.  i mean, come on!  use the spell check
if you know that you can't spell.  don't give your emails to
someone else to proofread.

anyway, this reminds me of when i was offering advice for
warped records.  i told people that if their records were
"bowel shaped" they could flatten them in a certain way.  i got
plenty of comments (both public and private) on that one.

just take it in stride and laugh.  it's no big deal.

Subject: [sfraves] <bsp> *Uplift* Thursday April 9th - Feat: Jason Lee/Sheztek/Jauncy/Sir Nod & Danny

i finally got to arrange the lineup for uplift, here's
what i got:

Jason Lee is headlining the night, from
10:45pm-midnight.  he's sick, amazing, and basically
able to surpass any grand epiphanic experience most
dj's i hear shoot for, and he does it every time i see
him spin.  you can check out his website
http://jl.halogen.org to further investigate, dog

Sheztek & Jauncy are doing a tag set from 8:15pm to
10:45pm - i have absolutely no idea what these two are
coming with, so get there early to find out.  If you
like them at Moksha parties, you'll love them in a
dark basement with no available exit and only a tray
of drinks in sight.. ;) 

Finally, we have our man Danny doing a tag set with
Sir Nod - i'm not sure what they're playing either but
whatever the hell it's going to be (and if i know
Don), it'll most likely be driving techno.  wouldn't
it be awesome to wear a suit made solely of bass
traps?  /fear 

finally, upstairs we have our AuraSF/Hosstribe crew:

7:30p-9p Koroma
9p-10:30p Cronos
10:30p - 12am Floorcraft
12a-1:30am JC.

drinks are cheap!  <duh, if you're of age> 2 dollar
drafts, 3 dollar wells, video games and airline seats.
 no cover, parking, blah blah - get your ass down
there!

Sublounge is 628 20th street & 3rd, 7:30-whenever

Fuck grammer! It's all about spelling!-|

Warren creates strange connections in my brain.
When I see a post from him, I think of WarrenG-
And then Bobby Brown-
And then I'm struck with a feeling of "man what the
fuck happened to me".
And then I imagine Escalades, a 2-way, and bling bling
on eBay.

And then I totally lose it and start writing
single-sentence posts about people and fetuses.

Spam? Army C-rations circa World War II? Osby dude you should visit Hawaii 
... they love Spam over there. Dunno why, really. Pork shoulder and ham ... and 
that weird gelatinous stuff that fills the rest of the can ... I don't know if 
it's officially "aspic" but it's something of the sort. 
Modern soldiers get "Meals Ready to Eat" instead of Spam. There's more 
variety, and like Spam, these meals don't have to be cooked. I'm not sure if the 
soldiers like MREs any better than Spam, as their nickname is "Meals Rejected by 
Ethiopians." 
BTW studies have shown that the soldiers' morale improves when brand-name 
snacks like Skittles are included in the MRE.  

Here is a recipe for Osby:
Take one can Spam
Put it back on the shelf
Buy a cheeseburger at the Smokehouse on Telegraph, along with an order of 
their great fries!

Subject: [sfraves] NRR effect/affect RE: [sfraves] SRR: *especially TRANCE* Defending my friend, Warren

Your "grammer"?

Sorry- I had to :P

I love nothing more than seeing someone bitching about
someone else's "grammer"-
It seems to happen at least once a day on /. 

As to your question, someone please correct me if this
is incorrect because I'm not a professional-

But "affect" and "effect" differ mainly by their use
as nouns and verbs.
"effect" is always(*) a noun.
"affect" is always(*) a verb.
Correct: "I'm feeling that blunt's effects""
Correct: "Man, that 40 is affecting my judgement!"

(*) The only exception I've seen to this is the phrase
"to effect change"
(Meaning- "to bring about change")
I think it's that way because it's describing the
condition of change (noun).
If that phrase meant "to change change" (change used
first as verb, then as noun- which makes no sense)
then it would be written as "to affect change"-
Tho, lots of people write that too, so maybe its
interchangable.

i used to make a mean spicy spam sushi in college.

cut spam into long strips about 1/2 inch x 1/2 inch.  marinate in Sriracha 
hot sauce and simmer in frying pan.  lay out dried seaweed, spread rice on 
seaweed and place spam strips in middle.  roll up a fatty and slice.

you can also make a hawaiian spam musubi and can even buy a little plastic 
box thingy at an asian market so you can "mold" the rice and the spam into a 
single block.  add a strip of seaweed to hold it all together.

spam fried rice rocks, too.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR: Any good SPAM (that canned meat thingie) recepies?

The story I heard way back when my dad was stationed at Pearl, and we 
lived in Honolulu goes something like this:

During WWII just about everything was rationed in the US... gas, tires, 
milk, everything... including meat.  So beef was already in short 
supply.  What's more, transportation was mostly monopolized by military 
uses.  And Hawaii has very little grazing land, and hence, very few 
cattle.  With the bulk of shipping being used to fuel the war effort, 
beef became that much MORE expensive in Hawaii... prohibitively so, for 
most of the population.  And remember, this was before refrigeration 
was common, especially in the shipping industry; so unless you were 
shipping live cattle, beef would mostly spoil on the way anyway.  What 
WAS in abundant supply (and CHEAP), because it was fueling the war 
effort, and because it doesn't perish, was Spam.  So the islanders 
learned how to cook with it so as to make it taste somewhat decent; 
mainly out of necessity.  And eventually they came to like it.

Now, I dunno, for sure, if this is the truth, or just an urban legend.  
But it makes sense to me.  Beef is STILL fairly expensive on the 
islands.  But the real reason, I'm sure, that it is thought of well 
NOW, is because they were raised on the stuff.

I agree.  Warren has lots of passion:)  As for grammar and spelling, 
language changes and the Internet certainly has had much impact on 
"correct" usage or lack thereof of the King's English.  I like Dr. Samuel 
Johnson's quote on grammar:  "No man forgets his original trade: the rights 
of nations and of kings sink into questions of grammar, if grammarians 
discuss them."

Subject: Re: [sfraves] SRR: *especially TRANCE* Defending my friend,  Warren

Your *King's English* comment is a tangent that confuses the original
argument. Last I checked we weren't an imperialist society with king and
queen figure heads. People that have horrible grammar and spelling will
appear to be uneducated and lack credibility in written form. Don't try to
add in *well he's a good person* or any other character attributes because
they have no bearing on an ability to communicate intelligently in written
form. As for modernization of the English language we have the Modern
Language Association for that purpose. Those that haven't been to school or
encountered MLA before should read up. http://www.mla.org.

"But it's a rave list..." - and that means you have an excuse to bypass
basic English skills? HA!

Thank ABC for Ecstasy Documentary!

ABC News anchor Peter Jennings hosted a 
<http://actioncenter.drugpolicy.org/ctt.asp?u=488&l=27002>special report 
April 1 on the risks and misconceptions of the drug MDMA, also known as 
Ecstasy. The hour-long documentary highlighted the federal government's 
campaign against Ecstasy, centered on the idea that the drug causes brain 
damage. But "Ecstasy Rising" also included plenty of testimonials from 
people who say MDMA has improved their emotional well-being. Please 
<http://actioncenter.drugpolicy.org/ctt.asp?u=488&l=27037>e-mail ABC to say 
thanks.

Far from a new drug, MDMA was patented in 1914 by Merck. Mental health 
professionals used it widely in the 1970s and 1980s to treat psychiatric 
disorders. The federal government moved Ecstasy to Schedule I, defined as 
having no valid medical use and high potential for abuse, in 1986 after a 
resurgence of the drug on the club scene. Yet some patients report a 
feeling of openness and a willingness to talk after taking MDMA, which the 
Drug Enforcement Administration recently 
<http://actioncenter.drugpolicy.org/ctt.asp?u=488&l=27001>approved for a 
first-of-its-kind psychotherapy study.

The Jennings documentary marks the first time a network news broadcast has 
dedicated so much time to a balanced examination of federal drug policy. 
Please let the network's staff know you're grateful for their hard work.

Here ya go Osby (most of you might not know this, but my favorite thing
ever is cooking weird stuff with whatever is in the pantry/fridge):

SpamFry (serves 2-3)
--------------------
1 can of spam
1 brick of firm tofu
8 green onions
1 cup of rice
2 tbsp of peanut oil
sesame seeds
crushed cashews
some nori flakes (or just a quarter sheet of nori held over a burner till
it changes color and ripped into little shreds)


dry press tofu (best done with a brick).
start yer rice.
when rice has about 10-15 minutes left on it...
cut up tofu into 1/4" thick pieces
blot with a paper towel.
cut spam into 1/4" thick pieces
heat up oil in frying pan on medium high heat (make sure the pan is big
enough to keep all ingredients flat in one layer)
when the oil's hot... (if you're not sure throw a grain of rice in
there... it should dance but not burn)
fry up your tofu + spam
cook till spam is starting to brown and tofu starts to skin (about 2-3
minutes a side if you got the oil right)
drain oil from above crap (best to just rest it on paper towel and turn
once).
with still hot pan, pour off the remaining oil and sear the green onions
(crank up the heat and cook until you get some dark lines on the onions).

serving:
top with spam with nori, the tofu with crushed cashews and the green
onions with sesame... served over rice in funky pattern (you can skip soy
sauce for this one cause the spam is so salty as is... try a Tonkatsu
sauce instead!).  goes perfect with a dry tasting beer (saporro, kirin)
and a dessert of green tea ice cream and some dark chocolate shavings.

Yep, well I have a PhD in English lit and the MLA style sheet is an 
excellent document.  But the MLA has many motivations and, like many 
academic organizations, needs to spend a bit more time outside the King's 
walls:)

The "King's English" is an old phrase and has absolutely nothing to do with 
"imperialism."  Wow:)

Moi, I look for character and talent first in others.  I've learned much 
from people who have "poor" language skills.  Right now, for example, I'm 
communicating with some very talented DJs and producers from back in 
seventies NYC before revising House Music 101.  Some of these guys have 
real problems with writing.  We've had to move from emails to the 
telephone.  If, for example, I got my tits in a ringer over Barry's all 
caps emails, with horrid grammar and spelling, I would learn nothing new.

Just me.

Love,

Apollo

Ah, that should be tits in a "wringer:)"  Although tits in a ringer has 
something to it.  You know, when I was a small boy my mother got her tits 
in a wringer.  We had to call a doctor.  Remember it vividly.

"I loved the focus in the early days of Wicked on the pagan aspects of 
life. The natural cycles of the full moons, being out in nature, on the 
beach, free, alive, unbridled, wild and spontaneous. There is no club, 
party or other sound system that has ever achieved anything close to that..."
-Jeno, on the early days of Wicked and the Full Moon Raves

I need more than one hand to count all the grammatical
errors that you have made in your post.

You are really in no position to exude your feigned
air of arrogance because your own grammar isn't even
perfect yet. 

You sound like the fat guy who tells everyone to go on
a diet while he runs to the kitchen and swallows a
whole large pizza and a couple cheeseburgers.

I agree with Apollo and I was thinking similarly when I wrote the message.

I like the idea of "looking for character and talent first in others" &
"learning much from people who have "poor" language skills."

I had a delayed reaction to various comments about Warren after thinking
about him yesterday so I just expressed what I felt inside.

On a side note, the colorful language of Texas has a good example of poor
grammar:
"It won't take but a minute."
People actually say this every day in the South, along with the usual
greetings like y'all (you all), which I can't seem to avoid saying myself. I
guess it is true that you can't take the South out of the boy.

Greg

Moi, I look for character and talent first in others.  I've learned much
from people who have "poor" language skills.  Right now, for example, I'm
communicating with some very talented DJs and producers from back in
seventies NYC before revising House Music 101.  Some of these guys have
real problems with writing.  We've had to move from emails to the
telephone.  If, for example, I got my tits in a ringer over Barry's all
caps emails, with horrid grammar and spelling, I would learn nothing new.>>

Ah, that should be tits in a "wringer:)"  Although tits in a ringer has
something to it.  You know, when I was a small boy my mother got her tits
in a wringer.  We had to call a doctor.  Remember it vividly.

Love,

Apollo

Antoine de Saint-Exupery is one of my favorite authors.  Most people know 
"The Little Prince,"  but he also wrote some excellent books about the 
experience of flying.  His last flight was in a P-38 during WWII.  He and 
his aircraft, a recon model, disappeared in 1944.  The plane has been found.

ASSOCIATED PRESS

1:08 p.m. April 7, 2004

PARIS – It was one of French aviation's enduring mysteries: Antoine de 
Saint-Exupery, the pilot and author of the beloved tale "The Little 
Prince," took off on a World War II spy mission for the Allies and was 
never seen again.

After 60 years, officials have confirmed that the twisted wreckage of a 
Lockheed Lightning P-38, found on the Mediterranean seabed not far from the 
rugged cliffs of Provence, belonged to Saint-Exupery, Air Force Capt. 
Frederic Solano said Wednesday.

In France, the discovery is akin to solving the mystery of where Amelia 
Earhart's plane went down in the Pacific Ocean in 1937.

"This was our holy grail," said Philippe Castellano, president of an 
association of aviation buffs who helped authorities identify the debris. 
"We never even imagined this."

It was a stunning revelation: Teams have been searching up and down the 
coast for decades, and many experts believed the plane was probably too far 
out to sea to be recovered.

Clues to the crash started coming together in 1998, when a bracelet bearing 
Saint-Exupery's name turned up in a fisherman's net near Marseille. Some 
reports said the find was a fake.

"For six years, people had their doubts," said the fisherman, Jean-Claude 
Bianco. "People claimed I made it myself."

But Bianco's discovery jogged the memory of a local scuba diver, who first 
saw the plane debris nestled in the ocean bed in the 1980s.

The diver, Luc Vanrell, pored over records of downed planes. By 2000, he 
was convinced he had found the right one. But it took time to get 
permission from France's Culture Ministry to have the pieces brought up for 
analysis.

The plane, smashed into hundreds of pieces, lies 100 to 300 feet below the 
surface, less than three miles from the coast between Marseille and Cassis. 
The key find was a tail piece bearing a tiny serial number, 2734 L – the 
same as Saint-Exupery's, Castellano said.

A piece of the puzzle remains unanswered: the cause of the crash. Theories 
have ranged from hostile gunfire to suicide. The debris has so far yielded 
no clues.

"It's impossible to say if he was shot down, if he lost consciousness, or 
if he had a mechanical accident," said Patrick Grandjean of the national 
Department of Subaquatic and Submarine Archaeological Research.

Famous for his bravery, Saint-Exupery was selected for the dangerous 
mission of collecting data on German troop movements in the Rhone River 
Valley. His plane vanished in the night on July 31, 1944, when he was 44.

He has become one of France's most admired figures, in part because of "The 
Little Prince," a tender fable about a prince from an asteroid who explores 
the planets and then falls to earth. Saint-Exupery's other works, which 
largely deal with his aviation experiences, include "Wind, Sand and Stars" 
and "Flight to Arras," about a doomed reconnaissance mission.

Until the euro currency was introduced in 2002, the novelist's image 
appeared on the nation's 50-franc note. In Lyon, Saint-Exupery's hometown, 
the international airport is named after him.

Castellano, president of the Aero-ReL.I.C. organization that helped 
identify the plane, said some Saint-Exupery fans resisted the efforts. They 
wanted to keep the mystery alive.

"In the end, I think everyone is satisfied," he said. "We didn't find a 
body, so the myth surrounding his disappearance will live on."

"Many persons have a wrong idea of what constitutes true happiness.  It is 
not attained through self-gratification, but through fidelity to a purpose."
-Helen Keller

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the 
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become 
visible."
-Jacques Attali in his seminal text "Noise"

"I loved the focus in the early days of Wicked on the pagan aspects of 
life. The natural cycles of the full moons, being out in nature, on the 
beach, free, alive, unbridled, wild and spontaneous. There is no club, 
party or other sound system that has ever achieved anything close to that..."

not only do i PWN a copy of the SPAM cookbook (you may begin
worshipping now without pause), i also PWN a stylish SPAM t-shirt.

oh yeah.  and, the icing on the SPAM is that i have never once
actually eaten SPAM.  i've thrown it at walls, helped a friend make a
sculpture, and once even gave a freshly empty can to a friend (as a
joke) to collect money from people while camping out to buy
lollapalooza 2 tickets.

my friend, being a little shy of "total hallucinogenic bliss", thought
my idea was a fine one, and 8 hours later he had amassed about $10 in
greasy, SPAM-slime covered change and small bills.

ah, SPAM.  :)

osby: i'll bring the book for you on saturday (if you're going...
which you are, correct?).  i can't bear to part with it, but i'll let
you peruse it's papery goodness.

shane

ps- i have no idea, btw, how i actually came to possess the SPAM
cookbook.

Subject: [sfraves] RE: NRR:  the whole damn grammar thing!

i've found that the new st. martin's handbook (certainly no longer uhm, new) 
has been helpful in all grammatical issues for those who struggle.  its 
cheaper than a class (i'm sure you can find it used at any bookstore), and 
it is organized in a way that makes navigation through its chapters 
incredibly simple.  it covers everything from subject-verb agreement to MLA 
and APA documentation.  i've had it for years now and don't know what i'd do 
without it!

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR: Any good SPAM (that canned meat thingie) recepies?

One of my best friends in high school would eat SPAM straight out of the tin 
with Worcestershire sauce on it. It would get all stuck in his braces and 
smell HELLA nasty.

It pretty much put me off of SPAM entirely.

Just thought I'd share ;)

And since I'm predicting the answer is NO for the most part, why not?

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Is there anywhere for techno?

I didn't say I cant find techno going on. The most important part of what 
I'm asking is the party part of it. Not the techno part.

>>Is there anywhere to find a really dope techno party?

These days, just finding someone playing techno is not enough. After all 
these years, I'm no longer willing to use my time going out unless there's a 
good chance that a party will be something special. I want it all.

Shit, even if it's only a few times a year... That would be cool.

I look, harder than you know.

hey kids - no need to hit the "reply all" button with every message. 
we're all on the list, we'll all see it.

just reply to the list, or privately if it's not something that 
everyone needs to see.

thanks!

Here in america we're as lucky to have such a bright, smart, enlightened 
president to lead us to the promise land. Here are a few quotes to remember him by 
in the future.



"Mars is essentially in the same orbit... Mars is somewhat the same distance 
from the Sun, which is very important. We have seen pictures where there are 
canals, we believe, and water. If there is water, that means there is oxygen. 
If oxygen, that means we can breathe."  -GWB

"Natural gas is hemispheric. I like to call it hemispheric in nature because 
it is a product that we can find in our neighborhoods." Dec. 20, 2000 

"The Holocaust was an obscene period in our nation's history. I mean in this 
century's history. But we all lived in this century. I didn't live in this 
century." GW Bush,
" I believe we are on an irreversible trend toward more freedom and 
democracy, but that could change." 
"One word sums up probably the responsibility of any Governor, and that one 
word is 'to be prepared'." 
"Verbosity leads to unclear, inarticulate things." 
" I have made good judgments in the past. I have made good judgments in the 
future." 
"The future will be better tomorrow." 
"We're going to have the best educated American people in the world." 
"People that are really very weird can get into sensitive positions and have 
a tremendous impact on history." 
"I stand by all the misstatements that I've made." GW Bush, Jr. to Sam 
Donaldson 
"We have a firm commitment to NATO, we are a part of NATO. We have a firm 
commitment to Europe. We are a part of Europe." ... 
"Public speaking is very easy." ... 
"I am not part of the problem. I am a Republican"
"A low voter turnout is an indication of fewer people going to the polls." 
"When I have been asked who caused the riots and the killing in LA, my answer 
has been direct & simple: Who is to blame for the riots? The rioters are to 
blame. Who is to blame for the killings? The killers are to blame. 
"Illegitimacy is something we should talk about in terms of not having it." 
"We are ready for any unforeseen event that may or may not occur."
"For NASA, space is still a high priority."
"Quite frankly, teachers are the only profession that teach our children."
"The American people would not want to know of any misquotes that George Bush 
may or may not make." ...Gov GW Bush, Jr.
"We're all capable of mistakes, but I do not care to enlighten you on the 
mistakes we may or may not have made." 
"It isn't pollution that's harming the environment. It's the impurities in 
our air and water that are doing it."

Subject: RE: [sfraves] BSP: DON'T MISS Li Sasaki RIGHT NOW on An Epiphany Of
 Sound


Li is playing at next month's huggermugger (may 16th) in tag team
formation with his old buddy me.  For those who remember those nights (we
sure as fuck don't) AndyW and Li came from a time when it was important
for DJs to be multidisciplinarians, and be like twice as wasted as the
kids sitting in the middle of the dancefloor huffing vicks, ducking UFOs
and planting trees in the linoleum.

HuggerMugger goes down every third Saturday at Lit 9-2am (at the lovely
intersection of 6th and Mission).  Top Shelf DJing and premium cat shaving
services with a techno flavor.  Please make a note of it.

I<3Li!

Subject: [sfraves] Li's new Mix & Andy W & Li

So Li gave me a copy of his new Mix "fifty-fifty" on Sunday @ Sunkissed... Awesome fuckin' Mix... it's all like all two steppy Break beaty stuff... Love it.. I guess it's called like Broken Beat in general but like more specifically called "Nu-Step" I guess????  But man... I Love it... Good Shit... unfortunately I couldn't hear him spin 2day on JCs radio thingie.. but I know he did a bad ass job!!!  

So yeah.. the last time i heard Andy & Li do a 2X4 was @ the SFR 10 yr @ that park place where U gotta kinda hike a trail 2 get 2 that pavilion lookin place... those sets are somewhere archieved.. right??? 

Wow... I'm excited now about fuckin' Li... Good Shit man.. I Love this mix!!!  OK... I know I'm laggin' on my DJ CD Reviews 'cause alot has accumulated since I reviewed Mega's CDs... I'll get 2 them...

But Li's new CD is like Groovy... I mean.. I guess the fact that it's filled w/ hella 2 Step basslines and melody patterns really makes me cream... I Love it!!  It's funny.. I've seen Li more in the past 3 weeks then i have in the past 2 years!!  LoL

So listen to fifty-fifty.. u soooo won't be sorry! =)

Subject: [sfraves] BSP**UPLIFT tonight at Sublounge-free

i finally got to arrange the lineup for uplift, here's
what i got:

Jason Lee is headlining the night, from
10:45pm-midnight.  he's sick, amazing, and basically
able to surpass any grand epiphanic experience most
dj's i hear shoot for, and he does it every time i see
him spin.  you can check out his website
http://jl.halogen.org to further investigate, dog

Sheztek & Jauncy are doing a tag set from 8:15pm to
10:45pm - i have absolutely no idea what these two are
coming with, so get there early to find out.  If you
like them at Moksha parties, you'll love them in a
dark basement with no available exit and only a tray
of drinks in sight.. ;)

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Bushism

	I think we're already in "promise land." We get there before every 
election. It's the "promised land" that never seems to arrive. 
Meanwhile, Bush has clearly said a lot of ridiculous things, but I 
don't think this quote belongs on the list:

"When I have been asked who caused the riots and the killing in LA, my 
answer has been direct & simple: Who is to blame for the riots? The 
rioters are to blame. Who is to blame for the killings? The killers are 
to blame."

	Nothing dumb about that. The rioters and killers *were* the ones to 
blame for the riots and killings in L.A. Maybe whoever put that list 
together is mocking him for his answer because the people asking the 
question were looking for a detailed response parcelling out blame to 
different ethnic groups, people causing racial tensions, institutions 
like the LAPD,  etc. But sometimes when you get into all that, you lose 
the most important point, which is that individuals are responsible for 
their own actions. He could hardly have said it any better.

Groove on,

"Many persons have a wrong idea of what constitutes true happiness.  It is 
not attained through self-gratification, but through fidelity to a purpose."
-Helen Keller

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the 
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become 
visible."
-Jacques Attali in his seminal text "Noise"

"I loved the focus in the early days of Wicked on the pagan aspects of 
life. The natural cycles of the full moons, being out in nature, on the 
beach, free, alive, unbridled, wild and spontaneous. There is no club, 
party or other sound system that has ever achieved anything close to that..."
-Jeno, on the early days of Wicked and the Full Moon Raves

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Bushism

That's a pretty good point. And perhaps the quote doesn't belong on the 
list, because it is not an obvious inanity.  You shouldn't ignore the 
fact that with that statement he sidesteps some important issues. 
Of course, an individual involved in a crime is responsible for his or 
her crime, and no one else is.  And a riot is really nothing else than a 
bunch of individuals committing individual crimes.  The fact that it 
happened on such a large scale, however, indicates that there is 
something more going on.  Something acting on the level of communities 
and society.  Bush's statement points out the obvious and simple in 
order to not deal with the some uncomfortable realities and underlying 
causes.  I think the fact that the most putatively powerful man in the 
country is _avoiding_ the discussion is just as messed up the fact that 
he often comes across as an idiot. 
No, scratch that.  I think it's more messed up.  And I think that when 
he says stupid shit, he often does so in order to avoid real discussion 
on those matters too.  By being imprecise he can't be held to anything 
he says.  I can't be bothered to go out and actually find a quote, but 
several times I've come across statements made by him which are quite 
inflammatory, but very imprecisely worded.  It's always followed by a 
more reasonable statement from an aide, saying what the president "meant 
to say".  It's all just rhetoric, and depending on your p.o.v., you 
either eat it up or it disgusts you.

Did I read my email correctly today?

I think someone (i.e. Ranger) mentioned that Dave Seaman is coming to the 
city on Friday?

I pulled out my GU boxed set (#012, Buenos Aires) in response to give it a 
listen.

Guess I better check out the 1015 site as well.

Ya know...  I'm all for ragging on president Duh, when he displays his 
idiocy himself.  But several of those are fake (Well, not exactly fake, 
but not spoken by the shrub.).  The ones about the holocause being an 
"obscene period in our nation's history" and "impurities in the air and 
water" in particular, I remember being part of a list of Dan 
Quayle-isms that used to circulate in the BBS scene, back during the 
time of george the first.

And a quick google for "Dan Quayle quotes" does actually come up with 
lists containing many of these.

Yup, I have an email from 2000 attributing those to Quayle.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] BSP: Li Sasaki - Thank You

Man, it's been a while.  Thanks everyone for tuning in.  Hope you all 
didn't mind my 9am beatmatching skills (not a morning person)  = |

I just put a website up, http://www.waxwrecka.com, where you can 
download my latest mix.  It's mostly nu-skool breaks with a bit of 
2-step.  I'm going to have a run of CDs burned soon, so if you like it 
send me an email and I'll get you a copy.

Thanks again to J.C. "the segue master"

"Bush's statement points out the obvious and simple in
order to not deal with the some uncomfortable realities and underlying
causes."

---He wasn't asked what the underlying causes were, he was asked who was
responsible for the rioting and killings.  Sometimes you can overanalyze
things, especially if you have an agenda to always make someone look bad.
In the end you're looking up your own ass with anal eyes, and guess what?
There's nothing there.

see, that's the difference.  all the JAs born and raised on the mainland 
call that shit "onigiri" but the islanders call it "musubi".

same basic thing, different name.  word up to the umeboshi inside the rice 
ball, y'all.  but i gotta give it up to the nihonjin and the crazy hawaiians 
that got the rice ball at the supermarket with the plastic wrap so that the 
seaweed stays crispy until you unwrap it.  that's pretty damn dope.


and spam breakfast at mcdonalds and the slushy floats.  like

hey look no further,   

this saturday april 10th the DEF KRU, Techno-Truth, and Cymbalic come wreckin 
w/
>>RoBoT feelings<< 
   the party's sort of an homage to the early moral values of the south bronx 
hip hop culture. when chaos was breakin loose they created art, community, 
and unity. i feel alot of important steps in the moral structure of raves were bo
rrowed from afrika bambaata's zulu nation. when planet rock was released it 
eluded to the zulu nation ethic as one planet one nation one world under a 
groove (as suggested by the parliament lyric).  the techno and electro music 
genres are an evolution of that concept and have taken it to the next level. our 
current scene often fails to show respect for its roots even though the obvious 
signs are there, technics sl1200s, flyer designers trying to get over with 
flyers, djs & promotional outfits gathered together like graff crews, and dancers 
adopting styles through emotion and advancing them through personal 
expression.. 

robot feelings is all about that. take out your agression, -your hard 
thoughts and the people breakin on you and break on the floor. show love unity and 
respect and break on noone else. 

robot feelings should be pretty off the hook. hope you all can show love and 
support for your scene.
the full BSP should be posted to the list somewhere around here...
in the odd event that it is not please seek the knowledge and apply.

Subject: [sfraves] SRR: punk/metal remix mix

This is from this kid from Boston named DJ Entropy. Mostly I think he's a 
big fucking tool - but this mix was worth posting just cuz it's so not 
normal.

It's all punk and metal remixes - starts out with nuskool breaks, works into 
hardcore and D&B. The D&B metal remixes are worth it alone...

http://www.djentropy.com/mixtapes/DJ_Entropy_-_The_Punk_&_Metal_Rave_mix.mp3

Enjoy kiddies. BY the way - how was Xhale last night? I got stuck at home, 
had to come into work early today - yuck.

haha yeah ... I think what it comes down to is that anything that would taste 
good made with ham will work with Spam. Why anybody would actually PREFER 
Spam is what I don't get, but "go figgah" Hawaiians ... it's a native thang, we 
wouldn't understand.  :) 

It's sorta like how the British love sausage that's filled with cereal and 
all kinds of stuff but not much meat. I remember sitting with some German kids 
at a hostel in England, and the German kids were saying, "... this is sausage 
??? Where's the meat?"

Subject: [sfraves] NRR: favorite Italian dishes, anyone?

Content-Type: text/plain; charset="US-ASCII"

ok, Spam has had its day in the sun. Sounds like Marco can cook up a mean 
plate of pasta with meatballs ... anybody have favorite Italian recipes to share? 

I don't have the amounts with me so this will just sketch it out. It's a 
Chicago-style stuffed pizza with Italian sausage. 
Warm up some milk in the microwave. Mix in two packets of yeast and some 
sugar, along with some cornmeal. Let it sit. Put about five cups of flour in a big 
bowl with a little vegetable oil and salt. Then mix in the yeast mixture and 
knead the dough for about five minutes. Set it aside to rise (covered, in a 
warm place). 
After an hour or so, pound the dough down and knead it some more. Then, split 
it so about 40% is in one ball and 60% in the other. Knead each ball some 
more. Roll (hehe ... I used a raver word) the bigger ball with a rolling pin so 
it's bigger than the pizza pan. (This works best in a deep dish pan, with high 
sides.)
Crumble up some Italian sausage and fry it up in a pan. Shred a whole bunch 
of raw spinach in a food processor. Shred a whole lot of mozzarella. Mix the 
spinach and mozzarella and spread it over the dough, and then throw in the 
cooked sausage along with some more mozzarella and spinach. 
Roll out the smaller piece of dough and lay it over the spinach. Crimp the 
edges of the two layers of dough together so they're locked. Then, press the 
edges of the dough and fold them over to make a rounded edge crust. Poke some 
holes in the top layer of dough with a fork. 
Spread some more cheese on top, along with some diced Roma tomatoes that have 
been well drained. (It's really good if you let the tomatoes simmer first, 
with a bunch of Italian herbs like oregano and basil. It shouldn't be watery or 
the crust will get soggy) Sprinkle on a bunch of parmesan. Maybe some black 
olives ... fresh garlic ... whatever. 
**If done right, the pizza will weigh a lot, so be careful handling it when 
it's hot.**
Put in an oven that's preheated to 450 degrees F. Put on a rack below the 
middle of the oven for 20 minutes, then move to a rack right at the middle for 
... oh, this depends on the oven, but probably about 25 minutes longer. When 
done, the crust should look golden, and any cheese that's exposed should be 
getting brown. 
Take it out of the oven and let it sit for at least five minutes before 
cutting and serving. If it's too thick for a pizza cutter, use a butcher knife.  :) 
 
I made this pizza for a friend who's  a chef -- with a slight change of beef 
tri-tip (marinated in merlot) instead of sausage -- and he said it was the 
best pizza he's ever had. 

This pizza is a lot of work and takes a while to make but it's really filling 
and tastes great. 
Mangia, mangia...

Oh lordy - where to start????

The last dish I made was Sausage & pasta w/ tomato pesto. Mainly I've been 
getting into more rustic/country style Italian fare though. It's less work, 
and very very hearty and tasty, not to mention pretty cheap to make overall.

Let me think on it a bit and then I can post a recipe or two.

best pizza he's ever had. 

This pizza is a lot of work and takes a while to make but it's really filling

But back the eye jewel's, gag me with a spoon. lol, I am way cautious about
putting anything near me peepers. You only get one set ya know?

not that eye jewelry had anything to do with you going out.

I would recommend AsiaSF, the freeform crew has a great event starting at
9pm. Also Dave Seamon is playing 1015.

But back the eye jewel's, gag me with a spoon. lol, I am way cautious about
putting anything near me peepers. You only get one set ya know?

Ahhhahahahahaha narc.=20

Go chug a bottle of Robotussin Max strength. It's one of the strongest =
psy drugs available and it's legal. Problem is, 1 out of every 3 people =
doesn't have the correct stomache enzyme to break it down and they end =
up having really crappy trips. So it's only for the elite. Oh and don't =
mix with MDMA since it's the complete opposite (outer vs. inner).

MDMA takes you deep inside yourself
DXM takes you deep outside.

Oh and I don't do drugs, just know a lot about them.

theres all sorts of canadian online pharmacies. . .

besides that, if you're talking about cannabis, join a club, go to a doc. .
.if you want to grow, I can help you with info. . .if you would plant a bush
in a month or so, by christmas you'll have at least a couple pounds of the
healthy happy herb. . .

best to go the somewhat legal route wherever possible.

Subject: [sfraves] SFR Calendar: 04.09.04


Yield and overcome;
Bend and be straight;
Empty and be full;
Wear out and be new;
Have little and gain;
Have much and be confused...

Therefore wise men embrace the one
And set an example to all.
Not putting on a display,
They shine forth.
Not justifying themselves,
They are distinguished.
Not boasting;
They receive recognition.
Not bragging;
They never falter.
They do not quarrel,
So no one quarrels with them.
Therefore the ANCIENTS say, "Yield and Overcome..."
Is that an empty saying?

Be really whole,
and all things will come to you...

Friday, April 16, 2004 ** Elektrosorcery presents Aries **

Aries subjects are courageous leaders with a genuine concern for those they=
 command, being responsible people, it is rare that they will use their sub=
ordinates to obtain their own objectives as leaders, but occasionally it do=
es happen. They do not make very good followers because they are too "take =
charge". They may be unwilling to obey or submit to directions for which th=
ey can see no reason, or with which they disagree. They are much concerned =
with self, both positively and negatively - self-reliant but also self cent=
ered (sometimes) and concerned with their own personal advancement and phys=
ical satisfaction. Their immense energy makes them aggressive and restless,=
 argumentative occasionally, headstrong, quick tempered, easily offended an=
d capable of holding grudges if they feel themselves affronted.

With Aries DJs: Kid Wicked, SemaJ, Element, Goober, & Jesse Gonzalez.

A Super Special Seekr Space with: Aaron Jae, Allen, David Bu Hau, Cyrus, Sc=
ottO, & Dr. Kipper.

And an Elektrosorcery Summoning Chamber with: Majere, James Dub, The Doctor=
, Nick Nyquil, Pandacon, & Leon Cook.

Zodiac ritual room by Jeremy S.
$10 tickets at F-8, Skills, and Solid Grooves. $15 at the door.

May Day Trivia:

=95 Traditional May Day celebrations were pre-Christian agricultural festiv=
als. Eventually the significance was lost and the practices survived merely=
 as popular festivities. (Which can also be said about other holidays: Hall=
oween, Christmas, Easter.)

=95 A widespread superstition held that washing the face in the May Day mor=
ning dew would beautify the skin.

=95 In Hawaii, May Day is Lei Day. Everyone gives the gift of a lei to anot=
her, putting it around the receiver's neck and accompanying the gift with t=
he traditional kiss. Observing practices of the islanders for centuries, Le=
i Day began to be observed officially in 1928. Some Hawaiian celebrations a=
re complete with pageants, a Lei Queen and her court.

=95 In 1889, a congress of world Socialist parties held in Paris voted to s=
upport the U.S. labor movement's demand for an 8-hour day. It chose May 1, =
1890, as a day of demonstrations in favor of the 8-hour day. Afterward, May=
 1 became a holiday called Labor Day in many nations. It resembles the Sept=
ember holiday in the U.S. The holiday is especially important in socialist =
and Communist countries--when political demonstrations are held.

Red Melon is proud to finally be able to showcase one of the biggest succes=
s stories in the underground house movement. Ask yourself how many globally=
 respected, underground artist-producer-DJs have turned-down offers to tour=
 with U2, and you will likely draw a short list. Josh Wink is such an artis=
t -- one who is unassuming, yet enjoys a cult following and who places arti=
stic integrity above all else. Owner of Ovum Recordings and remixer of mega=
-talents such as Sting, Depeche Mode and Ladytron, Josh has made only rare =
appearences in San Francisco, so don't miss out.

Supporting Josh will be Dano, Dj and tech house producer from San Francisco=
=2E  After a long winter touring Australia, New Zealand, and Eastern Europe=
, Dano is back in town working in the studio for a few months.  Dano has th=
ree new releases coming out simultaneously on Silicone Soul's Darkroom Dubs=
 imprint, Honchos Music, and Red Melon.  He will be spinning fresh techy gr=
ooves along with red melon biz partner JZ.  No stranger to the Melon experi=
ence, JZ is responsible for some of the most memorable sets in the seven ye=
ars of parties Red Melon has produced.  It will be just like old times!

If you are serious about your Red Melon parties, this Melon is not to be mi=
ssed! Get there before 11:00pm to take advantage of an earlybird cover char=
ge of $10 at San Francisco's newest venue, Mighty, located at 119 Utah St a=
t 15th Street. Mighty is a beautiful renovated warehouse with a touch of te=
chnology and art and the massive sound system that made Club Townsend a San=
 Francisco favorite. All of that plus cheap drinks too! You can't go wrong.=

never been there myself but I will definitely say that if your into house ..... and more specifically dirty ass twisted acid tech shit then Vancouver is definitely where its at. Some of the best producers/dj in the business for that style are all out of Vancouver.
 
 I would HIGHLY recommend any events with  Tyler "dj Tbone" Stadius  (he's consistently rated as one of the top  dj's in the world)  Jay Tripwire A.K.A Mr. Barcode (one of the hottest most sought after producers in the world..... fucking guys shit hot right now and also has serious skills behind the decks), Dj Ali, and Tyler Lewis. Any events with any one of these guys is well worth your time and money........ if your into that twisted acid tech shit anyways.

 
 I wish I could make it out there...... for the shit I'm into that area is a mecca , well that and London of course. 
 
 Have fun out there man!

Jack,

	Since you asked...   8)

1. Yes. http://eroticsafari.com/san%20francisco/
2. Yes. 
http://www.ammunitions.com/ammunitions/Firearms%20For%20Sale%20new.htm
3. Yes.* http://www.tntfireworks.com/ncom/tnt

	*Fireworks probably aren't illegal, as I don't think government in the 
U.S. has the constitutional authority to ban them. However they violate 
the constitution all the time, and may wrongly arrest and prosecute you 
even if they lack any actual legal authority to do so.

Subject: [sfraves] UPLIFT was So Dope!

OK.. I really wanna apoligize 2 Bam... I know i keep promising 2 go 2 Shadowlounge, & Seraphim, sorry I didn't make it out 2 Meow Mix lastnight either, but man... Uplift was fuckin' Awesome!! 

OK... lemme just start w/ a story.. so like my new class is on Tuesday nights now, but my parents, 4 some reason, would like not understand this sudden change in schedule w/ school ('cause I just found out that day as well).  So I pretended 2 go 2 class, but in actuality, I had Mondo hours 2 kill in the City considering I'm usually on Campus by 5:30 & class starts @ 6...

So I went 2 Anu & hung out w/ 1/2 of Jet Trash 'cause the other DJ dude wasn't there... hung out for like an hour... then all of a sudden I decided that walkin' 2 Sub Lounge sounded like a Groovy idea.. hmmmm.. 

After almost an hour of walking & talking to some dogs, I was 2 blocks away from Sub Lounge when i realized I had like all these mondo Muni passes & I coulda took Muni instead of walking.. LoL.. Hello 2day...

OK... Jauncy & Sheztek's tag set was Sick... they opened w/ like New School yummy Break Beats, then I dunno.. somewhere along their set came some old skool sounding stuff, then they busted out like these epic-industrial-type-deep-and-dark-melodic (if that's the term) sounding tracks that fuckin' floored me like crazy & i totally creamed when i was dancing =) YAY

oh oh oh oh.,.. so yeah... after like a year ago almost & getting invited 2 his site when it was still beta.. I fiiiiiiiiiinally met DJ Cronos.. This Dude's Awesome!!  his set was Groovy... ok... i know i'm totally lame w/ the House Genre terms... but yeah man.. he was rockin' the decks w/ this Bad Ass Yummy ?Prog? House.. I mean... he went on like after Koromo who totally started out the night playin Prog House also.. I dunno.. but I was seriously DMOA @ like certain moments of those sets!  

Jason Lee was Dope!!  LoL... he hella shocked me when he busted out House also like right after the Breakbeats right b4 him... but he was Sick!!  His house was kinda more deeper than what they wre spinning upstaairs, but it wasn't like deep house house though like all throughout his set from what i remember... but as Jason like started like getting towards the end of his set... I did notic he played more like oh gosh... Hello 2day.. I just like totally remember the last track when it had the South Park Kids like totally talking & shit... it was hella funny.. wiat.. it was South Park.. right?

Mr. Blueshaman & SirNod went on next down in the basement & oh shit.. their set was sick... I mean.. there was everything in there!!  Psy Trance, Techno, Breakbeats, Acid Trance, Oh My Goodness man... than like BlueShaman's closing song was 1 of my favorite Happy Hardcore Songs like ever!!!Oh Yeah!! LoL.. jk.. I dunno who the artist is.. but it's like this really hard Break Beaty song w/ Yummy vocals!!!  Oh Man.. Thank U 4 that song!!!  Loved it!!

Upstairs.. I guess his DJ alias is Floorcraft, but he was pretty Groovy too w/ his house set.. I mean.. i could keep sayin' that all the upstairs DJs were spinning like Prog Prog Prog, but I don't think it was all that though.. I mean... they all threw in there own twists of diff house genres in thier sets!! Gosh man.. it's hard 2 like not diferenciate when Jack's not there... LoL... I know i did hear some Tech House somewhere, & even some sudo disco house also!! LoL  But like Floorcraft... ohyeeah... I mean... I was actually up there like Groovin' 2 his set alot & I swear man... he so smooth with his tracks I noticed in his set!!  I was totally diggin' it man!

JC closed the night upstairs as totally did this mondo bang up job like always!!  LoL it was fun watching him put a record on, mix it in, then walk around the bar & like talk 2 people... LoL... oh yeah.. some did spin a house song that was in a movie...

OK... so it was fun like peoplewise there also!!! Alot family around which was Mondo Groovy! I mean.. seriously.. it was so hard 4 me 2 stay still 'cause there were so many peope I wanted 2 talk 2, all the while I wanted 2 play The Tazmania Devil game by the DJ booth!  Hello 2day, it was confusing.. but it was fun!

Afterwards the bar closed, I hung out w/ Damien (old school SFR kid), Polaris (old school SFR also), & a few other friends as we like galvanted around the City & ending up @ Damiens pad where i was like spinning Jungle 4 an hour in his decks!! LoL  It was an amazing  night & Wow... it was fun fun :P

Take Care,
Peace-> O§bY {8O)

Um, Warren, don't worry about it, in fact, this topic got out of hand and
changed into something different.
The replies copied within your email (see below) are easily taken out of
context from the original thread.

It might sound like a personal attack on you, when some comments were just
replies to other people on the list.

Now just go dance and have some fun.

Hi all,=20

I have mixed emotions about this, but I am leaving the rave scene and =
the Bay Area. The reason I am all mixed up is that raving is the only =
scene that I ever understood and participated in as an energetic dancer. =


I missed the disco era (too young at the time) and when new wave got =
popular in the 80s, I enjoyed the electronic beats and I went to clubs. =
But it wasn't like raving.

Something happened to me in the 90s while I lived in Houston. I signed =
up for Hraves (their local list) and jumped right into the warehouse =
parties. Jungle was a growing genre in Houston at the time, but I still =
liked the trance. I went to my favorite club a lot, Hyperia, in the =
downtown district near the ballpark. I went to parties every weekend, =
including one at an indoor amusement park and another at an abandoned =
warehouse. Houston did not have outdoor parties because it is too hot =
and sticky (high humidity).=20

When I moved here in 2000 (because of a job offer), I signed up =
immediately and started grooving with this group. And it has been great =
for me. SFraves is full of talented, bright, friendly, and articulate =
people. If I had a business venture I would hire all of you in a flash =
and we would be hugely successful and change existing corporate =
standards.

Now I find that disillusionment has set in with lack of opportunity and =
diminished standards of living, so we sold our house last night and we =
are hitting the road. I cannot leave until escrow closes and until we =
sell all worldly possessions aside from the important personal things =
and transportation. But as soon as the furniture is gone and the new =
guys get the keys, we are following a lifelong dream of travel.=20

The plan is to see the National Parks of the West, along with some =
national forests, state parks, and monuments, and just get away from it =
all in the process. Hence my departure from raving.=20

However, I will be thinking about all of you, and since I need to stay =
fit, I will probably do some raving at my campsite by dancing around the =
Ring of Fire with CDs and plenty of batteries!

I will be in the Bay Area for at least 20 to 30 days more, but I just =
wanted to post this message without disappearing.=20

Sincerely,=20

Greg Van Pelt=20

I remember on multiple occasions you telling this me this was your plan.

Thanks for the heads-up. Great to have you as a part of our list and
community =)

Best of luck on your endeavors, I know you have worked as a technical
writer, but are planning to do some creative writing on your new journey.
Pehaps you can include us SFR-nuts in your writings, and be a
SFR-Geri-Dahl on-location, of sorts ;-)

Bon Voyage!

> I have mixed emotions about this, but I am leaving the rave scene and the Bay Area. The reason I am all mixed up is that raving is the only scene that I ever understood and participated in as an energetic dancer.
>
> I missed the disco era (too young at the time) and when new wave got popular in the 80s, I enjoyed the electronic beats and I went to clubs. But it wasn't like raving.
>
> Something happened to me in the 90s while I lived in Houston. I signed up for Hraves (their local list) and jumped right into the warehouse parties. Jungle was a growing genre in Houston at the time, but I still liked the trance. I went to my favorite club a lot, Hyperia, in the downtown district near the ballpark. I went to parties every weekend, including one at an indoor amusement park and another at an abandoned warehouse. Houston did not have outdoor parties because it is too hot and sticky (high humidity).
>
> When I moved here in 2000 (because of a job offer), I signed up immediately and started grooving with this group. And it has been great for me. SFraves is full of talented, bright, friendly, and articulate people. If I had a business venture I would hire all of you in a flash and we would be hugely successful and change existing corporate standards.
>
> Now I find that disillusionment has set in with lack of opportunity and diminished standards of living, so we sold our house last night and we are hitting the road. I cannot leave until escrow closes and until we sell all worldly possessions aside from the important personal things and transportation. But as soon as the furniture is gone and the new guys get the keys, we are following a lifelong dream of travel.
>
> The plan is to see the National Parks of the West, along with some national forests, state parks, and monuments, and just get away from it all in the process. Hence my departure from raving.
>
> However, I will be thinking about all of you, and since I need to stay fit, I will probably do some raving at my campsite by dancing around the Ring of Fire with CDs and plenty of batteries!
>
> I will be in the Bay Area for at least 20 to 30 days more, but I just wanted to post this message without disappearing.

kay, let's lay aside the sfraves "snobbery makes you cool" image for a 
minute.  have people actually suggested running your words to the mailing 
list through a spellcheck before you send it to the list?
if you're that insecure about your spelling to sfraves, maybe there's some 
OTHER points in your life you need to be focusing on....

spelling as credibility?  please, if you're making a political statement...  
did we suddenly join a group when individuals recieve credibility based on 
their "spelling"?  dear god, please tell me you all or joking.  "well, since 
he can't spell, i guess he probably sucks at dj'ing too..."  my, you 
sfravers are getting bored in your old age...

Subject: [sfraves] More Anti-EDM and Live Music Legislation: Take Action

--=====================_11576576==.ALT
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"; format=flowed


Congress is considering legislation that could hold DJs, bands, bartenders, 
promoters, venue owners and others liable if a patron uses drugs at a 
nightclub or concert. If enacted, music lovers could soon be unable to see 
their favorite DJ or band live.

Congress passed the Illicit Drug Anti-Proliferation Act (also known as the 
RAVE Act) last year, making promoters and venue owners liable for the drug 
offenses of their customers (for more information on this law see 
<http://www.protectlivemusic.org/rave_archive.htm>history of the rave act. 
Now Congress is considering two new bills that threaten to effectively ban 
live music and dancing while throwing innocent people in jail.

<http://www.protectlivemusic.org/rave_act_action.htm>Fight Back
Find out what you can do to help fight against these proposed laws

The <http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d108:h.r.02962:>Ecstasy 
Awareness Act (H.R. 2962) would throw anyone in jail who "profits 
monetarily from a rave or similar electronic dance event knowing or having 
reason to know" if some of the event-goers use drugs. Similarly, Section 
305 of the 
<http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d108:h.r.00834:>CLEAN-UP Act (H.R. 
834) makes it a federal crime - punishable by up to nine years in prison - 
to promote "any rave, dance, music, or other entertainment event, that 
takes place under circumstances where the promoter knows or reasonably 
ought to know that a controlled substance will be used or distributed."

This makes no sense. Since the government can't even keep drugs out of our 
federal prisons, everyone has reason to know drugs may be used at their 
event. Every music concert attracts some people who may use or sell drugs. 
These provisions make criminals out of every concert promoter, nightclub 
owner, and stadium or arena owner.

The language of the Ecstasy Awareness Act is so broad that bartenders, 
musicians, and anyone else that in any way profited from an electronic 
music event could be fined or jailed. Section 305 of the CLEAN-UP Act is so 
broad that every musical style could be affected, including rock, Hip-Hop, 
country, and electronic music. Indeed, any property owner (including hotel 
owners, cruise ship owners, and casino owners) could be hurt under the 
CLEAN-UP Act, since it is reasonable to assume that any entertainment event 
that draws a large crowd (especially young people) will draw people who 
will try to use or sell drugs. (It should be noted that Section 305 of the 
CLEAN-UP Act is the only section of the bill that is problematic. Other 
than that section, the CLEAN-UP Act is largely a good bill that provides 
resources to train law-enforcement officers how to dismantle illegal 
methamphetamine laboratories without hurting the environment).

Disturbingly, it does not matter under either the Ecstasy Awareness Act or 
the CLEAN-UP Act if event promoters and property owners take steps to deter 
drug offenses. They can be prosecuted even if they have good security and a 
strict zero-tolerance policy. Nor does it matter if the vast majority of 
people attending the event are law-abiding citizens that do not use drugs. 
These bills criminalize entire events and everyone involved in such events, 
raising very serious free speech and due process issues. Racist or 
homophobic prosecutors could also use the laws to target Hip Hop and R&B 
concerts and gay and lesbian nightclubs.

People should not be punished for the crimes of others, nor should the 
government be frightening law-abiding businesses away from holding legal 
events like rock, country, or Hip Hop concerts. The Drug Policy Alliance 
and its coalition of partners will continue to work to protect the music 
industry, prevent the further criminalization of dance and music events, 
and mobilize opposition to these dangerous laws. We need your help:

"Many persons have a wrong idea of what constitutes true happiness.  It is 
not attained through self-gratification, but through fidelity to a purpose."
-Helen Keller

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the 
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become 
visible."
-Jacques Attali in his seminal text "Noise"

"I loved the focus in the early days of Wicked on the pagan aspects of 
life. The natural cycles of the full moons, being out in nature, on the 
beach, free, alive, unbridled, wild and spontaneous. There is no club, 
party or other sound system that has ever achieved anything close to that..."
-Jeno, on the early days of Wicked and the Full Moon Raves

Subject: Re: [sfraves] SRR: Another dancer departs the scene this Spring

Ok, I'm trying to avoid the reply all syndrome!

Thanks, Terry, that is a great idea. (about posting some writings while on
location).

I am still trying to figure out how to stay connected on the road, even with
the T-mobile "hot spots" and other wireless technology.

I know that most RV parks at least have a dial-up station for limited use by
travelers.

I have some time to figure things out, and obviously I won't unsubscribe
until the last minute (if necessary), but I would love to post an occasional
remote message. Or, maybe I could write a "blog" (web-based journal),
something I never tried because I worked so much.

Greg

I remember on multiple occasions you telling this me this was your plan.

Thanks for the heads-up. Great to have you as a part of our list and
community =)

Best of luck on your endeavors, I know you have worked as a technical
writer, but are planning to do some creative writing on your new journey.
Pehaps you can include us SFR-nuts in your writings, and be a
SFR-Geri-Dahl on-location, of sorts ;-)

Bon Voyage!

Jungle was a growing genre in Houston at the time, but I still liked the
trance. I went to my favorite club a lot, Hyperia, in the downtown district
near the ballpark. I went to parties every weekend, including one at an
indoor amusement park and another at an abandoned warehouse. Houston did not
have outdoor parties because it is too hot and sticky (high humidity).

This week we've got yet another quality show for you, with Nature and DJ
Pick joining us in the studio.  Peep the timeslots and shit ->

7-9pm EST - ODJ & Jerel - Your faithful hosts rock it out Dirtbox Kru
style.  You know how we do, so I need not say any more :)

9-10:30pm EST - Nature - The bad boy of Calvert County makes the hike up
here to throw down some wax.  Nature's been hosting The Battery w/ Mike F
on 88.1 WMUC for a fuckin looong time now, and does a show on
Destroyer.net w/ the one and only Deinfamous.  His mixes are well thought
out and full of energy, equating to pure dancefloor ownage.

10:30-12am EST - DJ Pick - Pick has recently shown up on our radar, when
he opened up for ED Rush & Optical in the main room @ Cubik.  He's got a
wicked crate, and can mix like a champ.  Y'all make sure to give this guy
a warm welcome on Sunday night.

It might sound like a personal attack on you, when some comments were just

Now just go dance and have some fun.

Subject: [sfraves] non fictional work...the spirit of easter season nrr

--0-307071777-1081801647=:78110
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

hello, today we are working on a non-fictional piece meant to uplife the spirit and the soul....we are great fans of non-fiction, however, we enjoy writing fiction more than non-fictional essays...in light of the spiritual season that continues to hover over us, we chose on this day to consider and continue the solemnity of the time of year:
 
what does easter mean to you? to some, it means candy and easter egg hunts. to some, it means going to church with large crowds, and to some, it means participating in a smaller community gathering, but it is always a day of contemplation nontheless. if you are a candy eater, perhaps today is the day to break off from the candy and just sit quietly...quietly in silent contemplation. your belief system need not interfere. you can believe in nothing or no one, but to sit in silence is pretty deadly lonely. thank you. :)

hello, this is a continuation of a fictional piece:
 
the supa baby in toddler form noticed that sometimes computers get colds and sometimes, a lot of computers get the same cold or a mutation of the cold during flu season, but that like all other flu and colds, they eventually work themselves out and just go away. :)

Same here... I keep getting "failed delivery" notices, which means someone on this list is infected with netsky or beagle or some email spoofing worm/virus, which is using my email to attack others. Id recommend everyone run this netsky removal tool if they're not sure if they have it or not..
 
http://securityresponse.symantec.com/avcenter/FxNetsky.exe
 
... keep in mind some AV progs wont find netsky and some others if you're not in safe mode (MS winblows users).

Subject: [sfraves] skylab2000 is alive and well and living in California


Sorry to steal the subject from an old Jacquel Brel record, but just 
letting everyone know that skylab2000 is still very much in the scene, 
still playing lots of live shows, and still releasing records and remixes. 
(Two more in July)

Just wanted to remind you all that you can have skylab2000 play live at 
your event, so contact me for details. Solid summer bookings so far, so 
let's add yours!

Subject: [sfraves] whats the trax

there was a tape simon put out in the early 90's. i
used to have it. i think it was called "narra mine".
anyway there are two tracks i have wanted for ages but
am finally getting around to looking for as i missed
the boat the first time. tif anyone remembers this
tape the songs i am looking for were the last two
tracks on side 2. 

the first one goes something like

"what about the narrow minds they see what they want
to see, what about the narrow minds they do what they
want to do"

the second track is the one that followed. the wicked
crew used to play it as well

some rasta guy heavy voice somethin like

"hay........ hay.... nadda hay" then a fat break would
come in and he would start ratsa rapping...

i will pay cash for these if anyone has them on vinyl.

or would be happy do download or if you know the
titles and artist i can look for them online. 

peec,

dub

Subject: [sfraves] SFLNC needs 100 people April 19th for Last Call at 4AM support

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

Forwarded from Terrance Alan, Chairman San Francisco Late Night 
Coalition.

********************************************
San Francisco Late Night needs your help.

Last Call at 4am will bring needed visitors from the surrounding towns
to keep our night life culture alive. Last Call at 4am will shine a
beacon on San Francisco's late night scene that will be seen around
the world. Last Call at 4am means more money, more jobs and more
fun.

And, according to the Traffic Safety Administration, even safer roads 
(see < <http://www.SFLNC.com>> for statistics.)

But, we need you help!

The hearing on the Last Call at 4am is scheduled for Monday April 19th
at 9am in Sacramento.

We need 100 people to be at that hearing. Not all will speak, only a 
few, but we need you.

Yes folks, it could be this simple, 100 people meet at the End Up (401 6th St. at Harrison St.) at 6am on Monday morning (April 19th) for complimentary coffee, Red Bull and Krispy Kremes. Then on to the bus we go. You will be given buttons and badges to wear. Everything will be done for you, but you need to show up.

So far I only have 37 people and I need 100.

I have a bus.

I have coffee and Krispy Kremes.

I have Red Bull.

I need people!

Forward this email everywhere you think folks will respond. Time is 
running out.

REMEMBER! With your support, anything is possible!

Email questions and offers to:terrance@SFLNC.com

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR: Masking my email address

they don't have to be on the list, and they're not using your address*.

what's happening is that someone with your email address in their address 
book is infected, and their machine is spewing out email to try and 
spread  the virus.

the mail delivery failure isn't real - the virus writers are using the 
tactic to get you to open to email.  In MS Outlook, opening the mail may be 
all it takes to infect the machine.

* You can prove this be deleting the email address, or changing the 
password - the infected emails will still arrive bearing your email address.

Go ahead and fwd: me any email viruses received that may be associated
with the SFR list.

I've seen a few of them...My bet is that someone on this list has a worm
or something similar, the headers are largely being spoofed.

Still, fwd: them to me with full headers so I can try sleuthing this.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR: SFR Virus BS!

A virus got me too-- I just got a bounced message with a virus 
attachment sent under my email address to someone I don't know. 
Interestingly, I wonder if our community is being targeted/used on 
purpose: The original message describes its attachment as a wav audio 
file, but is that fake screensaver virus that's been circulating. My 
logical conclusion as to who the culprit behind all this would be none 
other than Oakenfold himself as revenge for all the [mostly deserved] 
abuse we give him.

Hmmm conspiracy theorists ...we're on to something ... ya know how California 
is afflicted with a virus that's killing OAK trees ... Our oak trees are 
fold'n ...  It's all Oakie's fault for sure. 
Next, Keoki is going to poison our Kahlua supply so we can no longer drink 
Keoki Coffees without developing an urge to spin bad electroclash.

Subject: [sfraves] Dj Diversity

I love diversity.
the bay area is a full on melting pot. We have the most diverse communities 
around.
these days i never see too many Exotic Djs.
What do i mean about Exotic Djs...well i never see Djs of other ethnicities 
getting much play time. I went to furious and dream sequnce. there was some 
diversity.
Every once in a while you'll have Dnoald Glaude hit ruby skye for a splash 
of diversity.

why is that? i'm mult-cultural and i know alot of you are.
any opinions on that??

Subject: RE: [sfraves] Dj Diversity

My guess - more of us honkies spinning than anyone else???

It could also be that lots of people might be from another culture/ethnic 
background, but not look it.

There are lots of Spaniards who look white, but aren't. Plenty of folks from 
South of The Border that have the same issue going on. Shit - I had a 
roomate straight from Chihuahua Mexico, and no one could tell he was Mexican 
until they heard him speak.

Honestly though, I could care less if the DJ is from mars and has twenty 
boobies on his/her head - I just wanna hear good music.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Dj Diversity

you know you'll never be 'open minded' if you keep bringing up the color of
people's skins. The only way to move past racism is to not make it an issue.
Do racism exist? sure. Does you trying to invoke affirmative action on the
dj community do anything to help other's stop judinging based on color? no.
The irony of these 'multi-cultural' people astound me; They are the first
ones to judge based on color.

Who gives a shit who is playing the records? I mean seriosly am I going to
stay home because the dj is black? Or, Chinese?  Am I still O§by's friend
even though he doesn't look like my twin? Hell ya. DJ Bam rocks me as hard
as Calamity Jane who rocks me as hard as Koroma. As long as I am groovin'
they could be purple for all I care. And if a dj sucks, do you think the
first thing I say is 'man, they must suck 'cause they ain't white'. lol I'm
sure. They could have down syndrome, or be missing an ear, of maybe gay, OMG
;) I don't think me going to see a DJ is directly dependant on what they
look like. But then again I am a white/heterosexual/conservative what do I
know?

Although the one thing I do hate...lol, this is good, is the hot chicks that
spin topless, man oh man, how do you comepte with that? Would ya'll come see
me if I spun topless?

Subject: RE: [sfraves] Dj Diversity

It could be a few things...

1.) What parties you are going to? If you're hitting up all trance/nrg/hhc 
shows you're probably not going to see much diversity.

2.) I feel you and can tell you that it is somewhat unique to the Bay Area. 
Let's not forget that house & techno were both born in Black clubs. And the 
fact is, the deejays and clubbers involved in those pioneering days were 
hardly diverse (when it comes to ethnicity that is). If you travel, you'll 
see the diversity (ethinc, cultural, and otherwise) of both the artists and 
the people on the floor. Especially in the midwest (& Texas), parts of 
Canada (Montreal, Toronto), as well as in New York & the New England area. 
And that's just here in the US. Places like London are on a whole nother' 
level (but how many places in the world are like London?).

It seems to me that in today's Bay Area, kids are segregating themselves 
into what they are "supposed" to be into. So it's not going to be all that 
diverse. They say that the Bay Area is so culturaly diverse, but is it 
really? Who's actually sharing between many cultures? Just because there are 
so many people here, from all over the globe, is it really diverse if 
everyone (generally) keeps to themselves?

If you are only talking about the rave/club circut-traveling headliner 
deejay then it might be because certian areas producing these deejays are 
predominantly one ethnicity and/or culture. If you look at the population, 
the globe-trotting deejay world is actually more diverse than many of the 
cities that they come from. As well as the dancefloors they play for.

Subject: [sfraves] Detroit Re: [sfraves] Dj Diversity

The funny thing is (sorry I don't have time to read this whole thread but am 
still tossing in my 2 cents anyway) in the Detroit rave scene circa 
1995-2000, the party kids were overwhelmingly white (typically leaving their 
suburban homes to drive the 10-80 miles to Detroit), partying in areas which 
where overwhelmingly black, and the djs were often black as well (often from 
detroit or chicago).

Detroit really is as bad as you think, many burned and/or abandoned house, 
the great white flight decades ago after the riots, etc. - all the more 
apparent when you pack 2000 white kids into a warehouse in a black 
neighborhood, with the only black person in the room is the dj.

The bay area ROCKS!  I could never go back to Michigan for good... too much 
sameness is so BORING.  Another biggest difference - Detroit has some dope 
dancers, but its too competitive - people stand around and nod to techno 
alot - people dance here!

We are all so lucky to live in the Bay Area, to be open-minded, diverse, and 
know that we aren't the freakin' minority in our views... who cares what we 
all look like on the outside, yeah?

On that note, the Detroit Electronic Music Fest is the absolute best time to 
go to Michigan - everyone turns out for it, so much positivity (and 1.5 
million peeps!) - movementfestival.com

Anyone going to the breaks at Shadow Lounge thursday night?  if so say hi!

wow, that's the most i've posted on here in months.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR: SFR Virus BS!

dude I've been getting all sorts of em. . .

did you want me to just give you copies of ones with sfr addies ? Or also
ones we think may be related to sfr (like if I had an address that was only
used for sfr, which was recieveing viruses, but not necessarily from
recognizable members)?

I've gotten them from people I know, like ryan. . .and from people I don't
think i've really ever spoken to, like macadio (is he still around) and
djcantos.
those were mainly the ones that said something like "heres the info you
wanted", or something similar. I have several mail failure messages from
names that sound familiar. . .most seem to be hotmail or yahoo accounts..

I get a TON of the mailer failure messages. . . most from somewhat familiar
names, kinda raverish names, like lilchrishugs.

yknow, one weird one. . .is from nrgn@hotmail.com
the message says---
----------------------
If the message will not displayed automatically,
follow the link to read the delivered message.

Received message is available at:
www.hard-grooves.com/inbox/ak/read.php?sessionid-32084 -----------------

which is odd cuz thats not how my servers set up. . .  and I know I didn't
have that stuff on my server. . .
I didn't follow the link cuz there wasn't an attachment, so the link must go
somewhere that does the actual damage. . . I just noticed, about half of the
failure messages I get, have links like this which go somewhere ??

Just fwd: me the original mail w/ full headers and virus, if it's from
someone who is or was on the SFR list. I probably can't fix anything, but
I can at least figure out what the virus and most common variants are.

That is probably the Netsky virus, maybe this variant:

http://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/virusencyclo/default5.asp?VName=WORM_NETSKY.P&VSect=T

Here's Microsoft's acknowledgement of the exploit:

http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS01-020.mspx

In general, (esp. if you're using Windows) make sure you have proper Virus
detection software, and install patches for known Micro$oft
vulnerabilities.

i hit all types of clubs and the rave scene.
interesting thing. i never raised the issue of color. i said ethnicity.
ethnicity does not mean the color of your skin. yes a Latino Dj can be white 
as snow but his ethnicity is not white nor is it brown.
my not open minded. turn the tables here. did i once says that it's not 
fair. did i once even mention who gets all the attention and who doesn't?
your preception of the whole posting is on a negative note. where i was

I'm not on the attack here. simply stating an observation and getting

rid of em asap .

They're brand new, unopened. . .if any sfr people are interested, I'll =
sell them for $1010 (both)+tax/shipping.

the price recently has gone up on the tables. msrp was like $600ea, =
people should be raising their prices about $50 sometime soon.

I also have superblue led kits for the technics, which replace the popup =
with brighter blue leds, and another kit which replaces all but the =
popup with super bright blue leds. Actually I think I have these tables =
listed including the leds. . .even tho the 1210mk5g's have mostly blue =
lights already.

also, I recently became an ebay powerseller. . .which is interesting. . =
.they have a good amount of benefits available to powersellers. =
..medical n such. . .I was wondering how long it was going to take. . .

: )

take care

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Dj Diversity

yknow an interesting thought with this,

like last year, an exhibit was opened in san mateo or daily city at some
philipino museum saluting philipino dj's and the music. . . it was in the
newspaper, I never went to see it tho.

I thought that was odd at the time since it was mainly geared towards
philipino dj's, not dj's as a whole.

One of the DJ's on the movie SCRATCH was going off about how little 
Philipinos are represented in DJ culture too - weird.

I never realized dj'ing was a matter of cultural pride....guess I was wrong?

Subject: [sfraves] •| MAY DAY! Saturday, May 1st 2004! $5 Presales • ALL AGES • 8pm-4am!  [bsp]

Liquidvinyldjs.com is very proud to present..


• MAY DAY! •
Saturday, May 1st 2004
8:00pm - 4:00am
500 Person Capacity
1 ROOM VIRGIN LOCATION - Centrally located in the Bay Area!
ALL RESPONSIBLE AGES WELCOME!


With MAY DAY!, we would like to celebrate the beginnings of Summer with a 
very intimate 1 room experience! Join us as we kick the summer of just right 
in a

brand new location, close to everyone here in the Bay Area!


DJ's for the night:


|| DJ LUNA-C
[Kniteforce North American Tour || KFA/Kniteforce, UK] - SPECIAL BIRTHDAY 
SET!!
We are very proud to bring DJ LUNA-C to the Bay for his special Birthday 
Set. This will be the last stop on his very exclusive Kniteforce North 
American

Tour, and this night just happens to be on his birthday! He's coming 
prepared to showcase a very special set exclusive to us here in San 
Francisco, which is

sure to absolutely blow you away. If you've seen LUNA-C at any of our past 
events, you know he will completely take the roof off the place and have you

moving, from the first record to the last! Please allow us to wish our good 
friend a very Happy Birthday here in the Bay!

|| CLOUDSKIPPER vs. THE NICE GUYS
[Raw Elements/Kniteforce/Liquidvinyldjs.com vs. Liquidvinyldjs.com/K-12] - 
3X6 INSANITY SET!
In what is sure to be one of the more talked about sets this year, 
Cloudskipper faces off against The Nice Guys. Relatively little is known 
about The Nice

Guys, except, well, they're nice. In any case, be prepared for in your face 
up front hardcore, a lot of unreleased music, as well as onstage antics that 
can

only be described as pure madness!

|| DJ TRONIC
[Resistance Recordings/Liquidvinyldjs.com/CHR]
In preparation for his anticipated European tour, Tronic's set is going to 
be chalked full of brand new hard hittin material! This will be his last 
local

appearance before he heads off to Europe for 2 weeks, so be ready for the 
Hard Beats!

|| MAJERE
[Elektrosorcery, DJMajere.com] - SPECIAL TRANCECORE/FREEFORM SET!
In a rare appearance playing trancecore/freeform, Majere is taking a bit of 
a step back into his roots. Expect a set of fast and hard mind melting 
music,

which can only be appreciated by those ready to move!

|| THE DOCTOR & MC FADER
[Liquidvinyldjs.com/Bayraves.com || Gravitycrew.com/Emceeds]
Quite possibly one of the best DnB/Jungle DJ's in Northern California, The 
Doctor has become a household name. You can catch him almost every weekend 
droppin

those hard hittin tracks all over! In tow is the MC called Fader, in which 
really needs no introduction. These two go together like steak and eggs, 
like

butter on toast, like.. well you get the idea!

|| DJ J-MARR
[Liquidvinyldjs.com/Bayraves.com] - FAREWELL SET!
The man, the myth, the legend. Need we say more? Known from up and down the 
West Coast for not only his music, but also his energetic charisma, J-Marr 
is a

legend in the scene. This will be his last set behind the decks, ending a 
tenure other DJ's can only dream about. Be there to witness J-Marr rocking 
in his

usual manner, for the last time!

|| CARLOS ALFONZO vs. RECLIPSE
[Resistance Recordings/Soop Recordings vs. D&A Music/Bayraves]
The battle of the BBQ Iron Chef Carlos and the Maddest Mad DJ around, this 
will be a treat to all those who appreciated hard techno... and we do mean 
HARD.

These two will come out swingin' with pure dancefloor driven material.. get 
ready to rock!

|| LEON COOK vs. PETER GO-ZANIA!
[Hardscience/Logik Pro Audio]
These two have been rapidly rising among the Hardcore faithful here in the 
Bay, and with their crowd rockin performances and talent behind the decks, 
it's

really no wonder why. Expect a set full of freeform and upfront Hardcore 
material only these guys bring to the table.

|| DJ DMS
[Oakland Bounce/Dream Crew]


>From the same people who brought you HAPPY TOGETHER 1 & 2, OVERLOAD 1, 2, & 
3, SUMMER ROCKIN, and GET UP!. MAY DAY will be an extremely special night to 
us,

where we are celebrating the coming of summer, as well as our good friend 
LUNA-C's birthday. If you've loved the vibe and sharing of the music we've 
had at

past events, this will be no different!!

Subject: [sfraves] dj Babu, Re: [sfraves] Dj Diversity

That was dj Babu of Dialated Peoples (a sic dj) and he was not talking
about dj culture, he was talking about pop culture in general.

he was saying that djaying is one of the only places where filipinos were
really famous in pop culture as opposed to say movies tv politics etc.

correct me if i'm wrong.

with love,
Jonas, a mexican dj btw

Ummm, I'm thinking you hit reply on the wrong e-mail. Sounds like you're 
replying to someone else's reply in this thread (hitting on many key points 
of an entirely different e-mail)... Not mine.

Right?

True dat.  I'm Japanese on the outside and white on the inside.  I'm 
afraid of visiting Japan because I don't want to deal with constantly 
saying, "I don't speak Japansese, I just look like one."

But seriously, I never noticed.

Maybe I should change my name...Is there a  "DJ Token" anywhere? (too 
much South Park....sorry)

Agreed.  It looks like W32.Netsky.P@mm or Q@mm sending itself to 
everyone in someone's addressbook.

If you don't have virus software and you are running windoze, you can 
check to see if you are infected by doing a search on your C:\ drive for 
"FVProtect.exe."  The virus copies itself to the C:\Windows or C:\WINNT 
directories along with a few others.  If found, run this:

http://securityresponse.symantec.com/avcenter/venc/data/w32.netsky@mm.removal.tool.html

Then buy anti-virus software.  Simple.

Subject: [sfraves] BSP: s.ghael on An Epiphany Of Sound for Tax Day

Hey folks,
s.ghael will be dropping by the studios of KZSU later this morning, and
if he keeps with expectation, I believe he'll be bumping the really hard
techno stuff.  If he strays from the norm.... who knows??

In any case, do check it out.  An Epiphany of Sound is every Thur. on
KZSU from 9a-11a.  90.1 FM or http://www.kzsulive.stanford.edu .  It's
funner than a bathtub full of Chia pets.

ROBOTECH
Invasion Begins  April 17th

In July of 1999 a large craft crash lands on Earth and the Nations of the 
World, who are engaged in a global war at the time, call a cease-fire to assess 
the alien threat. Shortly after first researching the remains of the ship, a 
shocking discovery was made.. the crew who piloted the starcraft were on 
average, FIFTY feet tall. Terrified of an invasion, mankind came together to prepare 
for an invasion. Soon the commission of the SDF-1 project started and shortly 
after the "Project Valkyrie", a variable configuration all-purpose Robotech 
combat system, was introduced . Now it has been nearly 10 years  and the 
Zentraedi have arrived.

Subject: [sfraves] SRR: Shadow Lounge tonight?!?!?!

Aiight kidz - who all is rollin' out to Xhale @ Shadow Lounge tonight?!?!?!

Even tho I FINALLY got my new mixer, and all my equipment set up, and I'll 
be sacrificing spinning time, I'm gonna meander down for some drunken 
breakbeat business.

Anyone else from the East Bay heading out??? If there is, if you got room, 
holler! I'll pay bridge toll and buy a round or two as payment (or drop $$ 
in your tank if you'd rather have that - whatever is clever).

Anyone???

BREAKS PEOPLE!!!!! BREAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKKKKKS!

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Dj Diversity

I have to chime in here. For of you who haven't yet met me, I am half 
white and half black, and I grew up in East Oakland. I don't know if 
it's because of my black half, or because I grew up in a such a diverse 
environment (ethnically, sexually, economically), but I think about 
these things a lot too. I lived in Santa Barbara for 6 years, and I had 
to come back to the Bay Area because I couldn't take the homogeneity of 
SB any longer. Maybe I'm prejudiced, but I do like it when I see someone 
up there who looks different, whatever that might be. I would never 
*not* go see someone because of what they look like, but if I heard of 
jungle party where most or all of the djs were going to be black, for 
example, I would be intrigued and would want to check them out. Hmmm...I 
wonder, if I played up my black half would that get me more gigs? ;-)

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Dj Diversity

I'll admit, I prefer nicely mixed crowds (ethnically and otherwise), but it 
would never be the motivating factor for me goping to a party. The whole 
reason I went to "raves" in the 1st place was due to the largely diverse 
atmosphere.

But what are we gonna do about parties with a smaller "ethnic population" ? 
Bus people in like they do in schools???

That's right, we've finally reached two fuckin years of doin the show.
We're celebrating this by rockin out hardcore, special Saturday edition
style.  Peep the lineup (all times EST):

. 06:00pm - Don Vega & Just Charlie
. 07:30pm - Brian Arse
. 09:00pm - Bizar
. 10:00pm - ODJ & Jerel
. 11:00pm - Robot Death Squad (Akasha & Evancipation)
. 12:00am - Hooligan & Shade
. 01:00am - Ransom
. 02:00am - Stamina
. 03:00am - Psykofly
. 04:00am - Afterhours??

We may end up goin mad late, but that'll depend on how crunked we all are
at the end of the night.

Tim Defekt will be out with his vid camera gettin shots of the action, as
well as peeps with cameras, so expect some neat shit up on the site
afterwards, as well as sets from Picklejuice, Stretch, and Dave Nada,
who'll be playing upstairs.

But you know what sucks, I was sooo busy trying to make sure I was being =
diverse, I totally missed all the choons. :(

(for those that haven't been following this little post, lighten up, I =

PS - Bam, can I get a witness?

breaks. Good beer too...mmm.

Subject: RE: [sfraves] ATP: REVIEW: Shadow Lounge....Diversity at it's finest?

If I may vent for a second (and hijack the thread)....

So my car not only is a big ol' piece of shit, but the tags are dead, and 
until I can get the car working properly again, I can't register it - which 
leaves me more or less sans transportation for the time being. This is the 
main reason I missed out on Shadow Lounge last night (and I am seriously 
peeved cuz I was really looking forward to getting out last night). I'm not 
so stupid that I'm going to go driving illegally, and I didn't want to BART 
down, only to either A. get stick in the city w/o a ride, or B. go down for 
an hour than turn around and go home - that's just a tease.

Does anyone know of any decent and REASONABLY priced places in the East Bay 
to get a car fixed??? I just need 1 of my 4 valves to be un-stuck, and get 
the car ready for emissions. Not a ton of work. I don't even need a full 
valve job - just to un-stick the stuck valve. The car isn't worth having the 
the valves re-machined.

Anyhoo - that's why I wasn't out @ Shadow Lounge.

Just to cover my bases now  - if **ANYONE FROM THE EAST BAY**  is going out 
next week to Shadow Lounge for Xhale, FOR THE LOVE OF GOD PLEASE LET ME RIDE 
WITH YOU!!!! I will pay for bridge toll and a few drinks!!!!!!!

*sigh*

Hopefully I can make it down to Progression tonight - if I don't get out 
this weekend, I'll scream.

:)

So I can barely contain my excitement and must share it with all of you. =
I had mentioned that I came from an interview before I headed to Shadow =
Lounge. The interview was part of the this huge news....I have had 3 of =
my mixset's accepted by ThumpRadio and on April 23/24 Jack is headed =
Nationwide. The interview will obviously be chopped up and edited to be =
played during my mixes...it was to say the least an awesome experience. =
I am so excited and at the end having to do a lot of the station =
identifications was probably the highlight of week, if not 2004. So if =
you are ever in Dallas, of Philly, or Orlando and you hear "This is Jack =
Triumph representing ProgressionSF and when I am in Seattle (or insert =
city here) and I listen to the only station that matter's nine three =
three" ... THAT'S ME!

So sorry to ramble but I am just soo damn happy. So for all you local =
heads you can catch me:

April 24th, Saturday,on Alice/ThumpRadio 97.3 @ Midnight
..I have no idea what mix they are going to play or what parts of the =
interview you will hear, but it will be good. I am thinking about maybe =
throwing a little "listening party" at my house, so if you are =

NICE! Clear Channel's been doing this for ages, replacing local DJs with
recordings of some guy in Texas reading their stations' call letters
from a long list. Thanks for contributing to the national homogenization
of radio, Jack!

And hey, is it really necessary for you to prefix the subject of every
email you send with "ATP"? It's kind of redundant, considering we can
all see who sent the email by looking at the "From" field.

Cheers,

Subject: RE: [sfraves] ATP: REVIEW: Shadow Lounge....Diversity at it's finest?

buahahaah!  that's right.  jack said it best.  the Shadow Lounge on 
thursdays is the epitome of a diverse community.  and hey, we didn't even 
need affirmative action to get all those people there.  you know what did 
it?

THE BREAKS!!!!!

yes, i'll say it.  breaks will save your soul...and his, and hers.  it tears 
down the walls dividing us all and kills all "-isms" that seperate us.

can ya dig it?  i knew you could.

and seriously, thanks to everyone who made it out.  mr. jack triumph, erik 
to tha konkers, osby, becky-ravah-luv and amber, rashida-audio angel, 
spinner, ms. leslie ayers, and all the heads i saw bobbing to the breaks (or 
was it the beer?).

props go out to DJ M.O.D., Doubleday and Influence for taking us from 
progressive to nu skool to dark and dirty beats.  to my homeboy Aaron Jae of 
Evil Breaks.  to Pam and the Shadow Lounge crew.

every thursday.  always breaks. you want to come.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] ATP: ?

Alright I have got this before. Let me breakdown ATP for whatever it is
worth; Little history lesson into Jack's mind. When I first started posting
to SFR, there wasn't exactly an instruction manual on Post "prefixes", i.e.
NRR: BSP: SRR:, etc, etc, . That being said one of the first people I
befriended was a Mr. Nick Adams, who some of you may or may not know. I met
Nick via SFR and he rode shotgun with me one night out to a beach rave that
I was playing in Jenner, where I also befriended a gentleman by the name of
Mykrokozm, who doesn't post very much on SFR anymore.

All that being said, Jenner is pretty far, which gave Nick and I quite a bit
of time to get to know one and other. During the drive of course SFR came
up, since that was our initial common bond, and I asked him to explain what
all these different prefixes were. He obliged; at some point we were talking
about mixing and promoting and general EDM whatnots and I said "wouldn't it
be cool if people adopted personal prefixes to help personalize their posts.
We had a good laugh and that would be cool. So ATP was born.

ATP = Another Triumph Post.

So whether you think it is the lamest or coolest thing ever, I dig it. Just
helps me add a little "jackie touch" to my posts. If it bother's you well,
and not to be a d*ck, life's rough and this certainly won't be the hardest
obstacle you will ever have to tackle, lol. Think if it like my own little
emoticon. I encourage everyone to express themselves as they see fit. I
consider myself a creative person and I think language, communication itself
is a great thing. I study Latin, German and just about any other piece of
interesting tidbit I can get my hands on, in regards to how people
communicate their ideas. If you have seen my album titles you will see I
spare no expense ;)

When I first started doing this, Michael Red-Stickman (another great friend
I met on SFR), used to mess with me and change it to: APT, obviously a pun
on Apartment. Actually I am just guessing, I have no idea what he meant by
it, but it was all in good fun.

So you asked, and that is the honest truth. 'nuff said?

PS - I didn't realize I was this important; ya'll are making me blush...

I'd say the biggest reason for doing it is so at a glance you can see who

Basswaves
4-24-2004

Heavy pounding basswaves along bayshore are an early warning sign that
underground basswaves are approaching on 4-24-2004.  Swell causing heavy

underground basswaves.  The party people were very astute when it came to
finding basswaves booty-shaking action.

But when i got 2 the Embarcadero Station & made my way up the escaltor... it was trippy man... I heard my name like yelled out loud & it kinda scared me... Oh Shit.. it was Alex Van Dune!!!  Hello 2day... WTF!  So him & I talked 4 like 15 mintues about what's what & all that.. Lol.. then i went 2 school...

Got 2 school & like lab was closed, then somehow I ended up in the class where my old classmates are in now & watch them do oral presents... LoL... 

Anywaze... lab opened up again & liike I went in but was 2 lazy 2 do any tests.. so i left school & walk from China Basin to SOMA... it was a nice walk like talkin' 2 well.. I was talkin' 2 dogs again...

Shadow Lounge was closed still so i ended up like walkin' over 2 Butter. on the way there I really had 2 go pee & I went in2 some random bar, Heeeeeeeello 2DAy... it was this gay bar... LoL... but it was CooL... Some guy offered me a ciggy & said we shuld smoke in the smoking room in the back.. ok.. so i went... then yeah... the back room was actually the naked room LoL.. 'cause there was a naked man smokin' ciggies yeah... Ooooooooooookay

So I went 2 Butter.. OK.. YUMMY BREAK ACTION goin on in there.. LoL... It was fun.. DJ D was there & we kicked it 4 a bit.. then i got a Red Bull from 1 of my fave bartenders @ Butter.. Fun stuff.. we talked 4 a bit & he gave me some dl info about well.. stuff...

Then I went 2 DNA & made ammends w/ 1 of the bouncers who 86ed me like last year 4 bein' 2 hyper.. LoL... But yeah.. it was MEAT @ DNA.. so that was kinda Groovy.. they had like this really Hard Dark Trance music goin on which was fun... & the people there were all Goth... the host of the night was wearin a bloddy apron & there were like Chains hangin from the ceiling & this like "meat" theme.. it was fun!!

Then i went over 2 Shadow Lounge again... still now open.. I bumped in2 Araya while was walkin' 2 the store & we hung out 4 a while... it was fun!!  Went 2 her friends house 4 a bit & it turns out that her friend Matt is moving 2 Japan!!

OK.. finally went back 2 Shadow Lounge & it was open... I mean.. there were these YaYa Clubbie girls who were annoying as fuck there... la la la

But it was fun.. toooooootally fun man...

DJs:

I dunno who was spinning, but BB = Brakbeats, OK??

So BB DJ1 was spinning a nice opening set 2 warm up the night.. He spun alot ummmmm... I wanna say old skool tracks.. but they weren't really, but man.. he totally got off this 1 time doin' some Yummy Scratching!!! =)

BB DJ2 was Awesome.. oh man... he played some harder tracks as his set went on.. YUMMY!! & it was sick!!  There was a brief pause in music 2 sing Happy Birthday 2 someone... Jeff... who I met b4 like a few times I think.. OK.. & the fuckin' BDAY cake was a fuckin' Cheese cake.. YUMM!!

OK.. Now BB DJ3 was fuckn' Sick.. ok... what i liked about his set was that he had some Acid BB goin' on 4 a looong time during his set... WHOA.. then he went strait in2 Future BB after that 2 close... I Loved his closeing track.. & as he was spinning.. his shit got more faster & Man... it was fuckin' Awesome man!!

So like lastnight was BB fun fun... alota people showed up.. Finally after sooo long I saw Jack & it was fun fun catchin' uyp w/ homeboy!! =)  Ms Audio Angel was in the house & it was fun booty bumping w/ her on the flooor.. ok.. Hello 2Day.. Bam & 'Shida had an 80's dance off w/ each other during BB DJ3's set.. it was Dope & heeeeeella funny @ the same time.. I swear man.. never seen Shida dance that hard b4... 

Seriously.. i've never in a long time moved consisteantly like last night on the dance floor.. I was goin' Crazy... the only time I stopped was 2 get some air outside, but i was always on the floor like just moving... i did have some Janet Jackson moments when I was  like daydreaming I was 1 of her dancers while i was danincg... LoL

Then when the night ended... oh yeah.. I "missed" bart again by "accident" lastnight & I as just expectin' 2 kick it the City 'til BART opened... but Mr Bam took me home suprisingly.. it was Dope!!  I mean.. totally unexpected, but mondo appreciated!!! YAY!!  it was Dope... we haaaad sooo much 2 talk about, even more so than all the shit talk we do when we 1st C each other... oooops.... LoL...

Odeed - (Moonshine/LABA/W.E.)

Odeed is simply one of the sickest producers and dj's/turntablists around. 
He has had multiple releases on Moonshine Green with fellow producer Bionic, 
and his style of breaks easily distinguish him from other producers. He's 
had many affiliations including Moonshine, C.T.W., Downtown Dwellars, 2 
Covert Capin's, and of course L.A.B.A. One of his most recent performances 
in the Bay (May, 2003) was at 1015 where he opened up for Uberzone, and we 
are proud to bring him back again for a performance not to be missed.

vs

DJ Wish (W.E. - Baltimore, MD)

Originally hailing from Balmtimore, MD dj Wish has made a name for herself 
with her unique style of breaks. She has had many residencies to include, 
The Edge (DC), Tracks (DC), and The Spot (Baltimore). She has also worked 
closely with Shaken Not Stirred Records, Deep Rising Productions, F(x) 
productions, and she has performed at the world famous Buzz (Nation) in 
Washington DC. Odeed and Wish are currently working on a few tracks 
together, and this event is going to be part of their nation wide tour to 
promote their new label W.E. Recordings. I've been told we might get to hear 
some unreleased tracks that are sure to tear up the dance floor.


This event will be a small 250 capacity two room held in San Francisco at a 
new, secure venue, and we'll be bangin out the Breaks from 9pm till 4 am

Presales: $7
Door: $10

This looks like my kind of shindig. But I've never heard any of these people 
play. Am I going to get some quality music (played well) when I get there?

Cause' I kind of need that right now.

Not sure if you were there, but I played at the last Moksha Tribe party
in a similar fashion to what I'm doing at Basswave (live bass and
decks, tweaky/techy house), and people seemed to be into it.  I don't
have a set up yet in that vein but will soon.  As far the others
involved, I've heard most of them, know a few of them really well, and
yes, you won't be disappointed.  Great stuff is in store!

Well, of course I'm going to tell you yes.  All of us are pretty darn
good DJs.  None of us are super star.  You'll probably hear a handfull
of loose mixes throughout the night.  But the flow will be good.  The music
will be good.  And we're putting a lot of work into making it "Not just
another $10 underground in some warehouse."

If you're not convinced, hit me up off list and I can get you some demos
of some of the DJs.

If you can't distinguish the From field easily enough, then you need to
get a new mail client. If you want to add flair to your posts, format
your name differently. The subject header isn't intended to hold
signatures.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] (SHZ) [INC] Re: [sfraves] ATP: ?

I'm not advocating a 3 letter tag for everyone on this list. The last thing
I need to see is everyone with their own 3 digit tag on every damn post.
But, since only one person does it, it stands out. At a glance you can
follow the *thread*  If I see 3 bold letters, or some other text formatting,
I can follow a thread with greater ease. To each their own with what works
best.

formatting is grate!

I have been using it for a while now, since August, and have only come across one virus which my Norton caught and I deleted immediately, causing no damage. Maybe you are downloading from the wrong people? I really don't have that problem. Sorry to hear you did.
 
I added you Ninja. :)

Friday, April 16, 2004 ** Elektrosorcery presents Aries **

Aries subjects are courageous leaders with a genuine concern for those they=
 command, being responsible people, it is rare that they will use their sub=
ordinates to obtain their own objectives as leaders, but occasionally it do=
es happen. They do not make very good followers because they are too "take =
charge". They may be unwilling to obey or submit to directions for which th=
ey can see no reason, or with which they disagree. They are much concerned =
with self, both positively and negatively - self-reliant but also self cent=
ered (sometimes) and concerned with their own personal advancement and phys=
ical satisfaction. Their immense energy makes them aggressive and restless,=
 argumentative occasionally, headstrong, quick tempered, easily offended an=
d capable of holding grudges if they feel themselves affronted.

With Aries DJs: Kid Wicked, SemaJ, Element, Goober, & Jesse Gonzalez.

A Super Special Seekr Space with: Aaron Jae, Allen, David Bu Hau, Cyrus, Sc=
ottO, & Dr. Kipper.

And an Elektrosorcery Summoning Chamber with: Majere, James Dub, The Doctor=
, Nick Nyquil, Pandacon, & Leon Cook.

Zodiac ritual room by Jeremy S.
$10 tickets at F-8, Skills, and Solid Grooves. $15 at the door.

May Day Trivia:

^=D5 Traditional May Day celebrations were pre-Christian agricultural festi=
vals. Eventually the significance was lost and the practices survived merel=
y as popular festivities. (Which can also be said about other holidays: Hal=
loween, Christmas, Easter.)

^=D5 A widespread superstition held that washing the face in the May Day mo=
rning dew would beautify the skin.

^=D5 In Hawaii, May Day is Lei Day. Everyone gives the gift of a lei to ano=
ther, putting it around the receiver's neck and accompanying the gift with =
the traditional kiss. Observing practices of the islanders for centuries, L=
ei Day began to be observed officially in 1928. Some Hawaiian celebrations =
are complete with pageants, a Lei Queen and her court.

^=D5 In 1889, a congress of world Socialist parties held in Paris voted to =
support the U.S. labor movement's demand for an 8-hour day. It chose May 1,=
 1890, as a day of demonstrations in favor of the 8-hour day. Afterward, Ma=
y 1 became a holiday called Labor Day in many nations. It resembles the Sep=
tember holiday in the U.S. The holiday is especially important in socialist=
 and Communist countries--when political demonstrations are held.

 with U2, and you will likely draw a short list. Josh Wink is such an artis=
t -- one who is unassuming, yet enjoys a cult following and who places arti=
stic integrity above all else. Owner of Ovum Recordings and remixer of mega=
-talents such as Sting, Depeche Mode and Ladytron, Josh has made only rare =
appearences in San Francisco, so don't miss out.

Supporting Josh will be Dano, Dj and tech house producer from San Francisco=
=2E  After a long winter touring Australia, New Zealand, and Eastern Europe=
, Dano is back in town working in the studio for a few months.  Dano has th=
ree new releases coming out simultaneously on Silicone Soul's Darkroom Dubs=
 imprint, Honchos Music, and Red Melon.  He will be spinning fresh techy gr=
ooves along with red melon biz partner JZ.  No stranger to the Melon experi=
ence, JZ is responsible for some of the most memorable sets in the seven ye=
ars of parties Red Melon has produced.  It will be just like old times!

If you are serious about your Red Melon parties, this Melon is not to be mi=
ssed! Get there before 11:00pm to take advantage of an earlybird cover char=
ge of $10 at San Francisco's newest venue, Mighty, located at 119 Utah St a=
t 15th Street. Mighty is a beautiful renovated warehouse with a touch of te=
chnology and art and the massive sound system that made Club Townsend a San=
 Francisco favorite. All of that plus cheap drinks too! You can't go wrong.=

Subject: Re: [sfraves] (nrr) who's on ********?

i would like to suggest the program peer guardian.

the program is available @ http://www.methlabs.org/

it's basically a light-weight firewall diesigned specifically for p2p
program users.  it has a block list of ip addresses and ip address ranges of
people such as the RIAA and the MPAA and other organizations who are known
for spreading bogus files and/or are known for sniffing for people who are
sharring specific files to try and go after them and get them in trouble or
what not......

ummm, yeah.... its a great thing to have whether you are using the kazaa
network, the eMule network, Bit Torrent Network, the Soul Seek network, etc,
etc...... basically it is useful for all of them.....

hello, this is a continuation of a fictional piece:
 
phillip walked into the bedroom and slid open the closet door. when he looked on the floor, he saw 9 of his favorite silk ties all tangled up in a pile with the designer tags ripped off from when each one had been tugged and pulled from his tie rack. phillip actually owns 10 silk ties. one of them is missing. :)

For the 21+ crowd there's HuggerMugger tongiht ... a club I help do that's
been banging a great little techno monthly for a few sessions now.  Free,
located at Lit (6th and Mission), cozy yet strange vibe, dark dance floor.
9pm-2am.  http://tech-on.com/huggermugger.html

Sunday things get really silly, I'm entering my first laptop battle at
Club6.  It's totally open format, so expect to hear techno, ambient,
dubbed out goodness, glitch hop, noisecore, experiments launched sideways
at your head or whatever keeps you going for the next round from a bunch
of Sf's laptop totin' freaks.  16 contestants go single elimination to
determine whose cuisine reigns supreme.  Club 6 - 21+ $5 9pm-2am.
http://sf-laptopbattle.org/

hope to see you there!

damn, i was wondering when someone on this list was going to mention the 
laptop battle!  i would have been very surprised if there were no souls 
brave enough to do battle.

maybe i'll have to swing by and root for the home (sfr) team!

hello, this is a continuation of a fictional piece:
 
phillip followed the trail of the echoing sound  "oy! oy! oy! oy!", and entered into the thud, thud of little feet jumping up and down to the blaring stereo system in the front of the home. when he reached the source, he immediately spotted his missing tie all wet and crumpled up in a corner spot.  when he picked it up, he could faintly smell a hint of dog food upon it, and when he turned and looked behind , he saw two little eyes looking way up into his and heard a pained  voice insisting, "MINE! MINE! MIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII----ne. " :)

hey whats up

I saw on the news earlier today, an sf supervisor talking about new =
legislation for producers of one night events.

It came up after the death of that one youg guy at that ymca party like =
3 mos ago. I believe it's named after the young man who died.

she said that one time event producers will have to have complete =
background checks, before any events. They're doing this to protect =
people from shady event producers. Also the leg. plans to heavily =
penalize producers who have events in which violence breaks out. . .=20
I wonder how massive events would be effected, since I ALWAYS see fights =
at those parties, and theres pretty much always some irresponsible =
person going home in an ambulance.

I thought it was interesting. . .

is the SFLNC doing anything about it (do they even know about it) ?=20
Certainly it's much much more important than helping drinkers drink more =
alcohol. . .

I know some clubs a couple years back, like 1015, had to turn in lists =
of events, dj's, promoters and such to the SF coppers for =
review/acceptance/denial. . .that was argued at the time as being unfair =
to the promoters/etc . .  I would think that this leg. would effect all =
one night events in sf's future, possibly make it difficult/impossible =
for normal people to get events together.

. . .=20

: )

take care all

Subject: [sfraves] Alloy Trex CD out now!



Hi all,

Alloy Trex is proud to announce the release of their first full-length
CD, "Algo-Rhythm".  This CD was recorded just like we do our shows, completely
live.  If you are not familiar with Alloy Trex, we have performed in
numerous chill-rooms around the Bay Area for over five years, including
Koinonea, Thump, Tantra, Key of Life and G.o.a Play parties.

Alloy Trex combines funky breakbeat grooves with ripping psytrance
inspired synth work with lots of random weirdness thrown in for good measure.
The Alloy Trex sound has a dynamic, evolving quality that can only
come from a live, real-time performance.

"Algo-Rhythm" is available for online purchase at CDstreet.com:

http://www.cdstreet.com/artists/alloytrex/

Here you will find plenty of sample clips from the CD.  We invite
you to come take a listen.

-troy and alex

THE MOST NATURAL SELECTION

Steven Kotler, LA Weekly

Charles Darwin would say that since homosexuality is not a
reproductive strategy, it's an aberration that should die
off. But a new book arrives at another conclusion: Darwin's
theory of sexual selection must be wrong.

"Many persons have a wrong idea of what constitutes true happiness.  It is 
not attained through self-gratification, but through fidelity to a purpose."
-Helen Keller

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the 
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become 
visible."
-Jacques Attali in his seminal text "Noise"

"I loved the focus in the early days of Wicked on the pagan aspects of

beach, free, alive, unbridled, wild and spontaneous. There is no club, 
party or other sound system that has ever achieved anything close to that..."

Subject: RE: [sfraves] NRR: THE MOST NATURAL SELECTION

An interesting read.  I study genetics (and other stuff, he he) and right 
now there is no convincing evidence that homosexuality or variations in 
sexual behavior are inherited.  There are many homosexual individuals who 
have offspring before they "come-out" and as far as I know, their children 
do not have a higher occurance of homosexuality than nonhomosexuals.  To me, 
it seems that sexuality is something that is more of a spectrum and 
preference than a definable categorizable matter.  In my own life, as well 
as in the lives of many close friends, my ideas and sexual behavior have 
changed.  There is no evidense genetically or from personal experience, that 
sexuality is something that is inhertible or something that is permanent.
Just my 2 pesos,
Joey

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR: THE MOST NATURAL SELECTION

	Perhaps there *is* a biological (inherited) aspect of homosexuality,  
but one that does not function in a completely straightforward manner.  
While I think a fair amount of sexual orientation may be  
social/cultural, some people clearly have strong dispositions from a  
very early age that cannot really be explained by anything other than  
an inherited trait.

	I agree with Joey that gender is a spectrum, with extreme masculine on  
one end and extreme feminine on the other. People on both ends are less  
likely to have strong homosexual tendencies than people near the  
middle, but there are exceptions in both cases. Say a particular set of  
parents have strong feminine genes. This would mean that if they have a  
*son*, he is more likely than average to be gay, but if they have a  
*daughter*, she is *less* likely than average to be lesbian. The  
reverse would be true for parents with strong masculine genes.

	Of course it's my personal opinion that all of us are bisexual -- most  
people just have a strong enough attraction in one direction or the  
other that they don't bother to experiment much (or at all) with the  
non-preferred sex.

Groove on,

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR: THE MOST NATURAL SELECTION

I heard an interesting theory once that homosexuality occurs in nature as a 
means for population control. Given the fact that there are so many people 
on the planet sucking up it's resources at an accelerated rate - maybe it's 
the earth regulating things.

It's *A* theory, not *my* theory. Something to think about anyway...

Either way, people can theorize any way they want, to me it's just another 
part of the yin and yang of life.

Origin of 420:  What I've heard (and this has been disputed) is that a bunch 
of Marin kids would meet at a statue in front of school at 4:20 pm to smoke. 
This was either San Rafael High (in San Rafael) or Redwood High (Larkspur). 
Seems like an odd time, though ... an hour after school lets out? 
It's also been said that the number is a police code for people smoking pot, 
but that's not true. 
I always grin when I hear ravers say, "I'm sober tonight ... yeah ... just 
smoked some weed tonight, that's all."  it's a matter of degree! 

Today I celebrated by enjoying some, and then treating myself to ice cream.  
:D

I want to say that 420 stands for the number of chemical compounds that are
found in pot smoke, or pot itself ?!?!

Anyone else heard that. who knows, maybe I watch too much late night tv..

Heh....  My personal anti-favorite are those stoners who come up with 
ridiculous little slogans like: "baked, not fried"; and who talk about 
how "pot's not a drug, man, it's an herb"; and "I only do drugs that 
grow naturally, man".

Well, things like hemlock also grow naturally.

I don't get where the idea came from that one is somehow virtuous 
because they chose to get high off of some drug that grows as a plant 
vs. a drug that's cooked up in a lab, or people who stay sober.  (And, 
when you come right down to it, many of those "synthetic" drugs can 
ultimately be derived from plant sources; if you'rfe willing to do a 
little more work.)

'Reminds me of this wonderful article about anti-drugs:

Davey D on Democracy Now-Police Surveillance and Hip Hop

Entire article can be found at www.daveyd.com

Recent reports in Miami and New York have revealed how the police in
these cities have been closely monitoring the hip hop community in
ways critics say are a throwback to COINTELPRO.  We talk acclaimed hip
hop journalist Davey D who hosts a daily show on Pacifica station
KPFA.  [includes rush transcript]
Since the Bush administration took office three years ago, the
number of secret surveillance warrants sought by the FBI has increased
some 85 percent.  This is one of the findings of the commission
investigating the 9/11 attacks.

Recently, there have been a number of stories in the press about
surveillance against Hip Hop artists.  Recently, the New York Police
Department hosted a hip-hop training seminar, attended by several law
enforcement agencies.  At the meeting, a six-inch thick black binder
was handed out.  It included the arrest records and photos of dozens
of rap artists and their companions.  Also, the Village Voice
newspaper recently revealed the existence of a Hip-Hop Intelligence
Unit within the New York Police Department.


Davey D, a hip hop historian, journalist, deejay and community
activist.  He is the webmaster for what is considered one of the
oldest and largest Hip Hop sites on the web: Davey D's Hip Hop Corner.

Well, this is way-off-topic but I thought I would share the feeling. You =
might be in this boat someday.

In real estate, when you are selling your house, it's important to set a =
trend. You have to show off--make your place very presentable, like a =
model home.

The agents call it "staging" and there are professional firms to handle =
this for sellers.

We have some nice furniture so our agent suggested doing our own =
staging. We got rid of some items, and this is hard to do for things =
that you like, but when the place is not cluttered, it looks better. I =
even stored away my 5-minidisc + 3 CD bookshelf system, and we took out =
5 bookshelves and all books and personal items. (Try cooking without =
cookbooks)

The realtor said that you would be surprised how distracting =
photographs, calendars, posters, refrigerator magnets, and such are to =
prospective buyers. So we took them down. No one has to see our happy, =
smiling faces on the walls.

So, when you are living in a "model" home, you have to put things away =
constantly, vacuum a lot, try not to cook smelly seafood, keep the patio =
swept, play CLASSICAL music (NOT jungle, house, or trance) during home =
tours, turn on all the lights and open the windows, hide the dog and her =
bed and toys, and just be presentable.

Man, it's work living in a model home! But maybe since this is the Bay =
Area we will get a lot of money from this deal, and we can see the =
U.S.A.

Greg VP

Subject: Re: [sfraves] 420!!!!BABY!!!!!!HA HA!!!!!!

the 420 term came from a group of northbayers who called themselves the
"Waldos". When they were in high school they used 4:20 as their own code
speak meet at the regular place to get smoked after school. I think there
was a nearby amusement park they would routinely go to.

the only chemical in cannabis that really needs any mention is thc. like
tetrahydracannibinol . Some marijuana like plants (ruderalis something or
other) are very similar to cannabis but do not contain thc. Vaporizing is
the absolute best way to take thc, since there is basically no carbon
monoxide produced from the burning of plant matter, cuz thc "vaporizes" at a
lower temp than the actual plant material burns, thus basically eliminating
any and all of the negative effects of the "smoking" part.
In some coffee houses, vaporizers are allowed (not in us) because it's
technically not "smoking".
The us govmt has their own synthesized form of thc that can be prescribed by
doctors in capsule, liquid or powder form.

I think it's funny when people always talk about 420 and have no idea what
they're talking about. Just a catch phrase basically like "wolf tickets",
I'm suprised it caught on, but then again anything that gives cannabis
lovers another reason to love cannabis is usually heavily supported buy
cannabis lovers.

I've been reading high times, and grow books and things like that for like
more than 10 years. . .I'm a supporter of the cause and have even instructed
and helped several people set up groovie grow projects to success. . . it's
a good healthy habit in a lot of ways. It's too badd that some positive
things can kind of be exploited by others, like the HS kids who just are
irresponsible and try to get high all the time cuz they just want to be high
all the time. If they only knew about the other good things they're doing
for themselves, the whole issue could change from "drug users" to educated
beneficiaries of natures gift.

high times never said that,

I have the issue with the article on the waldos. . .

: )

I have issues from the 80's. . . magazine issues that is.

Also a notable fact:

Even tho in CA, if on federally owned land, such as in the presidio area in
SF, federal law governs and you can be arrested for posession even tho you
have all the required doctors recommendations n such. A ticket for posession
is like $250, and they confiscate everything. I assume the same would be
said for military/ex military bases, like in alameda. . .but those are
mainly just security patrolled areas and not patrolled by federal police
officers really (or I've never seen them). Maybe airports also, local and
larger ones. Or FAA governed land.
I'm curious as to what would happen if not actually on federal land, but
within sight of federal officers. . . like on the border of the land area.

oh yeah, also

I'm sure most all plants have hundreds of active chemicals running thru
them. . .no huge discovery there. . . but if cannabis is vaporized properly
you really only deal with the cannibinol related ones (the stuff from the
vaporizing of the crystals which contain thc).
Of course you would be smoking chlorophyl n stuff like that if you smoked
any plant like that.

I heard an ex president once mention that he was against hemp clothing
because kids were boiling it down and somehow getting high off it. . .
pshhhh. . .

Vaporizing is perhaps the worst way to introduce cannabinoids into your 
body.  The sensation is entirely different from smoking, and I don't find 
it nearly as pleasant.  THC is the most prevalent chemical, and perhaps the 
one we understand the most, but the others shouldn't be dismissed or 
overlooked.  Marinol (synthetic) is also nothing like smoking, and many 
patients prefer the effects of smoking, if they even register the marinol.

yknow really. . .

if someone synthesizes anything, it may be based or similar to natural
compounds, but it will never be exactly the same.

Manufactured and processed chemicals create environmental issues that most
people won't even think about until years from now when it all comes back to
bite us in the ass. . .

and there are major diffirences between "use" and "abuse" of.

Any natural non processed chemical is vastly superior to anything created or
manufactured.

Look at our medicines versus ancient medicine. . . Here in the us, we're
wonderful at covering things up (symptoms n such), but are horrible at
cures. Herbalism, chinese medicine, natural medecines are the sources for
actual cures/remedies, and not simply "making a headache go away", but
making it so you don't get headaches in the first place. (eg)


people who tend to argue about the natural drug thing also tend to be the
same people that embrace manufactured chemicals on a daily basis. Which
realistically, if they changed their tune, they would be much more likely to
find cures for the ailments that they were covering up with their daily
Alleve or high blood pressure meds or whatever.

I've been thru several surgeries on my knees, feet, hands. . .mostly from
broken things. . . after the first time, I tossed out the vicodin crap, and
the pills they told me to take. I simply used herbs, cannabis, proper eating
and diet, and spirituality, and I recieved relief that no manufactured drug
has ever been able to give me, relief that lasts a lifetime, safely. I used
to take zoloft, n xanax, n tried all of these other things, but ultimately I
gave all those things up for natural remedies, and have been much much
better off since.

it's not a simple as "one pill a day", but it actually works at remedying
the cause of the issues.

Marinol is a synthetic form of THC.

here's the bad part.  it's patented.  therefore, it makes a drug company
rich.

here's another bad part.  it doesn't taste amazingly great like skunk or
hash oil.

here's another bad part.  marinol is the same thing over and over and over
again.  therefore, i can build tolerance to it.

i want 50,000,000 different kinds of cannabis.  variety is the spice. the
spice expands consciousness.  i want to choose which types of effects i
want to feel.

bill o'reilly, let me grow my own medicine so i don't have to waste my
money making another drug company rich.

jeez billy O' which drug company writes your paycheck.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] 420!!!!BABY!!!!!!HA HA!!!!!!

the effects from smoking and vaporizing are diffirent,

carbon monoxide, and other chemicals you absorb from the burning of the
plant matter also gives you that light headed, woozy sometimes kind of
feeling, which thc itself isn't the main contributor to.

like, you know how if sometimes you smoke a cig, and get a lil nauseous,
room spins, light headed n such. . . most of that is from smoking all the
crap from the burning of the papers and materials in the cig and not the
nicotine itself. (some might be sensitivity to nicotine, but mostly the
burning stuff). Try this if you're a smoker. . .smoke an herbal cigarette,
or even just a paper itself or something. . .you'll get a lil short term
woozy buzz feeling. . .you just don't get the fulfillment from the chemical
you're craving, but still feel the lil side effects.

vaporizing is also non cancerous, which is a huge plus, since carbon
monoxide is one of the main causes of cancer in smokers, and the carbon
monoxide is from the burning of the plant matter itself. Carbon monoxide is
poison to most all living creatures, and in small doses cause all those
other heavyish effects you feel, esp with low quality buds.

btw, I personally don't vaporize, even tho I know it's better. . .it's not
too convenient really.I don't own one of those contraptions, but have used
them before.

Vaporizing reminds me of smoking opium. I mean - if I ever smoked Opium, er, 
um - n stuff.

The all over body-high. Also kinda reminds me of the feeling of eating the 
ganj. Maybe it's just me.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] 420!!!!BABY!!!!!!HA HA!!!!!!

The govmt medical whatever organizations created marinol as a substitute for
cannabis, trying to fight the idea of cannabis being medically beneficial.
Marinol I believe is supposed to have the benefits of consuming canabis, but
without all the side effects (getting high etc).

they were mainly just trying to stop people from finding simple relief. The
drug companies had to get their hands in the mix and they're not gardeners.
. .so what else could they do.

I've heard the question often about how the drug industry would regulate or
make their money if everyone was growing their own pot. . .the answer is,
they wouldn't. . . so it's basically another attempt of the govmt to control
this.
Also, cannabis is not an acceptable reason (even with a docs referral) for
someone to be able to have a pass on a drug test with a positive result. But
most groups accept marinol, even tho it most likely will produce a positive
result, but if you can prove your Rx, they'll let it slide.
So if you really wanted to, get the rx, keep it handy, and show it to the
drug people when you fail the pre employment test. I haven't tried that yet,
but it's such a sensitive issue, it's usually best to mask your urine with
something else, and avoid the subject all together.

aK

sorry if I tend to sound like a know it all. . .but cannabis is one subject
I know I know more than average about. . .but not everything. . . I've just
been involved with ocbc, cures not wars,the MM March group (may day is jay
day), various pro cannabis groups for years. . .so I tend to hear a wide
range of thoughts and ideas on the subject (especially from people who've
never tried it).

speaking of vaporizers, i'm the art director of a new company - check 
out our product.

    www.vaporlogic.us

it should be out on the market in about 4-6 weeks.  i saw a production 
model this weekend, and it's pretty bad-ass.

good hash or keefe is similar too. . .

you can make it pretty easily with screens, or trimmings sitting in cold
water. ..

I met a guy who made new kinds of hash, he had this weird foam spongy type

What really bothers me about what is happening is IT'S A FUCKING RERUN.

jazz -> hip hop
McCarthy -> Ashcroft

"Many persons have a wrong idea of what constitutes true happiness.  It is 
not attained through self-gratification, but through fidelity to a purpose."
-Helen Keller

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the 
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become 
visible."
-Jacques Attali in his seminal text "Noise"

"I loved the focus in the early days of Wicked on the pagan aspects of 
life. The natural cycles of the full moons, being out in nature, on the 
beach, free, alive, unbridled, wild and spontaneous. There is no club, 
party or other sound system that has ever achieved anything close to that..."

I'm still looking for the"right" vaporizer.  Seem to be so many models out 
there now.  Some over $400.00.  A friend has an expensive high tech device 
that, it would seem to me, would be easily broken when coordination is 
somewhat impaired after a few tokes.  Also, with vaporizers, it's hard for 
me to judge how much I can comfortably smoke.  Seems a couple of hits and 
you're down...

Love,

Apollo

Subject: [sfraves] RE: XHALE @ Shadow Lounge this THURSDAY!!!

Ok - so everyone has already been subjected to my illegal automobile 
sob-story. As promised last week, I am here today to see if one of the fair 
citizens of the East Bay SFR tribe would be willing to transport my tuchus 
to SHADOW LOUNGE this Thursday night for XHALE. My offer/request still 
stands from last week: I pay bridge toll, buy ya a drink or two or kick down 
a couple pesos for petrol funds. I know there's some sympathetic soul out 
there that is willing to hook me up, right???

Even just a ride home FROM Shadow Lounge would be great as it's very easy 
for me to BART there, but in order to stay there later I'd need a ride home. 
If someone can hook up the return ride the same offer stands.....

I gotta have my breaks people!!! Someone? Anyone?

That's the global list... the local one is called sfbay604. I believe it's

Subject: [sfraves] nrr:  50 worst songs of all time

`We Built This City' tops Blender's 50 worst songs list

Tuesday, April 20, 2004
©2004 Associated Press

(04-20) 14:18 PDT NEW YORK (AP) --

Starship may have built this city on rock and roll, but Blender magazine is 
tearing it down, naming the band's "We Built This City" as the worst song 
ever.

Some tunes on the "50 Worst Songs Ever!" list were selected for their 
melodies, others "are wretchedly performed" and "quite a few don't make 
sense whatsoever," the magazine said.

The list, which appears in the May issue, includes songs by New Kids on the 
Block, Meat Loaf, The Doors, Lionel Richie, Hammer and The Beach Boys, among 
others.

Blender describes 1985's "We Built This City" as "the truly horrible sound 
of a band taking the corporate dollar while sneering at those who take the 
corporate dollar."

Starship lead singer Grace Slick says, "This is not me," when the magazine 
reminds her of the tune. "Now you're an actor. It's the same as Meryl Streep 
playing Joan of Arc."

Rounding out the top 10: "Achy Breaky Heart," Billy Ray Cyrus; "Everybody 
Have Fun Tonight" Wang Chung; "Rollin'," Limp Bizkit; "Ice Ice Baby," 
Vanilla Ice; "The Heart of Rock & Roll," Huey Lewis and the News; "Don't 
Worry Be Happy," Bobby McFerrin; "Party All the Time," Eddie Murphy; 
"American Life," Madonna; and "Ebony and Ivory," Paul McCartney and Stevie 
Wonder.

Other songs on the list: Toby Keith's "Courtesy of the Red, White and Blue" 
(No. 22); Whitney Houston's "Greatest Love of All" (No. 30); Ricky Martin's 
"She Bangs" (No. 39); Billy Joel's "We Didn't Start the Fire" (No. 41); 
Simon & Garfunkel's "The Sounds of Silence" (No. 42); The Beatles' 
"Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da" (No. 48); and Celine Dion's "My Heart Will Go On" (No. 
50).

Blender and VH1's TV special "50 Most Awesomely Bad Songs ... Ever" airs May 
12.

Bassbin don for another rolling set of dubbed-out
floor smashers.

Subject: RE: [sfraves] NRR: THE MOST NATURAL SELECTION

Because the wrapper "gay" is a construct of society-

<theory>
Both animals and humans both simply engage in
behaviors based upon their wants/needs and their
associated opportunity costs.  
Both animals and humans are both basically driven by a
chemical reward system, and a not-just-physical "pain"
sensation.
Both animals and humans are complicated enough, and
react to their environment enough, to develop
"preferences" that truly are unique to the individual.

What this means is that a person or animal is not
"gay" or "not gay"- it simply means that for lots of
humans and animals, their preferences have evolved to
the point that the benefits of engaging in homosexual
sex outweigh whatever the particular opportunity costs
might be.
In otherwords, it's just something that some people
like to do, based off of their being as a whole, and
not pinpointable down to genetics or environment
specifically, though those 2 factors certainly have a
say in it (as they do with all other activities that a
human or animal might engage in)
</theory>

THE MASK COMES OFF: AARON RUSSO BLASTS GOP CALL FOR MILITARY DRAFT

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
APRIL 20, 2004

Contact: Stephen Gordon
stephen@russoforpresident.com

In the first public display of bi-partisan congressional sentiment for 
conscription, US Senator Chuck Hagel (R-NE) today floated the idea of a 
draft to address the deteriorating military situation in Iraq. "Why 
shouldn't we ask all of our citizens to bear some responsibility and 
pay some price?" Hagel asked the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. He 
holds that conscription would force "our citizens to understand the 
intensity and depth of challenges we face."

The spectre of conscription has loomed over Washington for months, 
despite denials from the Bush administration that a draft was under 
consideration.

With re-enlistment rates plummeting and recruitment flat, the 
administration has quietly begun staffing Selective Service boards. US 
commanders in Iraq have called for an immediate deployment of 10,000 
additional troops to bolster the American occupation, and Secretary of 
Defense Donald Rumsfeld has announced his intention to expand the Army 
by 30,000 next year, with no details as to how.

Democrats have been calling for conscription with a slightly louder 
voice for more than a year, receiving round condemnation from 
Republican legislators until now. US Representative Charles Rangel 
(D-NY) and US Senator Ernest F. Hollings (D-SC) introduced a draft bill 
in early 2003 which remains in committee. US Senator Hillary Clinton, 
in a March 25th speech at the Brookings Institution, referred to a 
volunteer military as "inadequate."

Democratic presidential hopeful John Kerry (D-MA), called for 
"mandatory national service" on his campaign web site until last week, 
when Libertarian presidential candidate Aaron Russo's highlighting of 
the issue embarrassed him into removing the language.

"A Washington Times reporter called me, asking where Kerry's use of the 
word 'mandatory' existed on his web site. I looked and it was gone. We 
have collected a Google cache proving it once existed, and will be 
posting it on our web site soon", commented Russo spokesperson Stephen 
Gordon.

"This isn't speculative," Russo says. "The draft is coming. Republicans 
and Democrats have been trying to put off the public discussion until 
after the November elections, but there's no doubt that the American 
people will be threatened with conscription by the end of this year."

Independent candidate Ralph Nader's voice joined Russo's last week in a 
press release aimed at American students. "Young Americans need to know 
that a train is coming," said Nader, "and it could run over their 
generation."

Russo greets Hagel's trial balloon, and Nader's engagement of the issue 
with enthusiasm. "For six months now, I've been telling Americans about 
the coming draft, and the Republicans and Democrats have denied it out 
of one side of their mouths while talking around it with the other. 
It's coming, and it's time we had a real public discussion about it. If 
Bush and Kerry want this issue to go away, all they have to do is make 
clear, public pledges that there will be no draft."

Russo's campaign web site (www.russoforpresident.com)features an 
anti-draft petition which has collected thousands of signatures.

"The question is this simple," Russo says. "Should the government have 
the power to take our sons and daughters, against their will, in order 
to rescue themselves from the situation they themselves brought about 
with an immoral, unwinnable war? The answer is no. The war in Iraq was 
a mistake a year ago, and it's a mistake today. Not one more drop of 
American blood to save our politicians from their own wrong-headed 
policies.

"Americans have always responded in their country's time of need. If 
this war was justifiable, the recruiting offices would have lines 
around the block of young men and women eager to serve. The fact that 
they don't should tell our politicians that it's time to re-think what 
they're doing. But the draft? No. It's not right and it can't be 
allowed to happen."

And with both "major" parties now on record as supporting conscription? 
"That just shows how disconnected from reality the Democrats and 
Republicans are," says Russo. "And it demonstrates the clear necessity 
of electing a president to this November who will put the nation back 
on the path to peace and prosperity."

As the Libertarian Party's likely nominee, Russo is the only 
presidential candidate opposed to the draft and to the war in Iraq whom 
Americans will find on the ballot in all fifty states this November. 
His platform includes immediate withdrawal of US forces from the Middle 
East.

	Obviously whoever put that list together had a strong bias =
against --=20
well, I was going to say against catchy pop music, but that doesn't=20
even begin to cover it. Basically it's just an ignorant personal rant=20
to say that musically and lyrically solid songs like "We Built This=20
City," "The Sound of Silence" and "We Didn't Start The Fire" are among=20=

the fifty worst songs *ever*. Give me a freakin' break.

Subject: RE: [sfraves] (NRR) GOP Senator joins Democrats in calling for military draft

To be quite honest, a draft is very scary and disheartening.  I really hope 
that it doesn't happen.  I may be selfish but I sure as hell don't want to 
go to Iraq to kill or be killed over a war I don't agree with or understand.
Dos Pesos,
Joey

Everybody aged 18-24 had better be eyeing prices for apartments in
Canada right now.  I had MAJOR major fears about the draft when I was a
kid..  Luckily I'm in my late 20s now so I've neatly missed it (unless
we *really* get f-ed up).  However pie-in-the-sky the possibility of
the draft seems at current, it couldn't hurt to look into the
particulars behind obtaining Conncientious Objector status or the
logistics of a temporary out-of-country move.

Cheers,
George

Jefferson Airplane    cool
Jefferson Starship     pretty cool and then pretty sucky
Starship     incredibly sucky

I've been following Paul Kantner and whoever else he's with for a long time, 
going back to Haight St festivals in the late 60s. To me, "We Built This City" 
is the absolute nadir of the Jefferson Airplane/Starship repertoire. Awful 
corporate rock, not written by the band but by hack songwriters, and sung by the 
soulless Mickey Thomas. But is it one of the 50 worst songs of all time? 
That's so subjective. I can think of worse! 

After all, there are a lot of terrible songs that nobody knows because they 
never became hits. To be a "huge" terrible song, somebody had to like it. This 
is really a list of "50 Really Popular Songs That I Always Hated." Some of 
these songs wouldn't be remembered with such hatred if they hadn't been 
overplayed so much when new, or repeated endlessly on "classic rock" stations. 

Some classic rock songs even end up as trance mixes, lol.  You know how Mars 
never met a remix of a rock song he didn't like...   :)

Aryck,

	I'm a fan of holistic medicine and herbal cures/remedies in many 
respects, but humans are a *part* of nature, not outside it. The 
distinction between "natural" and "artificial" is ultimately an 
artificial one, and trying to draw a solid line between the two makes 
no sense. "Natural" carcinogens will cause cancer just as surely as 
man-made carcinogens.

	To say that "any natural non processed chemical is vastly superior to 
anything created or manufactured" is sheer ignorance, imho. Are you 
telling me that if you knew you were going to get polio, you wouldn't 
want the polio vaccine because it was "manufactured?" That you'd take 
your chances on some Chinese medicine or something? That you wouldn't 
want penicillin for any of its numerous beneficial anti-biotic 
applications? That tobacco, a natural drug, is better than ecstasy, a 
manufactured drug? Etcetera, etcetera...

Groove on,

					<<< Starchild >>>


"Assault weapon" confiscation turns violent in Boston
Scores Killed, Hundreds Injured As Para-Military Extremists Riot

BOSTON, April 19 - National Guard units seeking to confiscate a cache 
of recently banned assault weapons were ambushed on April 19th by 
elements of a para-military extremist faction. Military and law 
enforcement sources estimated that 72 were killed and more than 20 
injured before government forces were compelled to withdraw.

Speaking after the clash, Massachusetts Governor Thomas Gage declared 
that the extremist faction, which was made up of local citizens, has 
links to the radical right-wing tax protest movement. Gage blamed the 
extremists for recent incidents of vandalism directed against internal 
revenue offices.

The governor, who described the group's organizers as "criminals," 
issued an executive order authorizing the summary arrest of any 
individual who has interfered with the government's efforts to secure 
law and order.

The military raid on the extremist arsenal followed wide-spread refusal 
by the local citizenry to turn over recently outlawed assault weapons. 
Gage issued a ban on military-style assault weapons and ammunition 
earlier in the week. This decision followed a meeting in early April 
between government and military leaders at which the governor 
authorized the forcible confiscation of illegal arms. One government 
official, speaking on condition of anonymity, pointed out that "none of 
these people would have been killed had the extremists obeyed the law 
and turned their weapons over voluntarily."

"Government troops initially succeeded in confiscating a large supply 
of outlawed weapons and ammunition. However, troops attempting to seize 
arms and ammunition in Lexington met with resistance from heavily-armed 
extremists who had been tipped off regarding the government's plans.

During a tense standoff in Lexington's town park, National Guard 
Colonel Francis Smith, commander of the government operation, ordered 
the armed group to surrender and return to their homes. The impasse was 
broken by a single shot, which was reportedly fired by one of the 
right-wing extremists. Eight civilians were killed in the ensuing 
exchange.

Ironically, the local citizenry blamed government forces rather than 
the extremists for the civilian deaths. Before order could be restored, 
armed citizens from surrounding areas had descended upon the guard 
units. Colonel Smith, finding his forces overmatched by the armed mob, 
ordered a retreat.

Governor Gage has called upon citizens to support the state/national 
joint task force in its effort to restore law and order. The governor 
has also demanded the surrender of those responsible for planning and 
leading the attack against the government troops. Samuel Adams, Paul 
Revere, and John Hancock, who have been identified as "ringleaders" of 
the extremist faction, remain at large.

The price of freedom is eternal vigilance."
-- Thomas Jefferson

Subject: Re: [sfraves] (NRR) GOP Senator joins Democrats in calling for military draft

-------------------------------1082508071
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="US-ASCII"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

There are definite plans in the works for a selective type of draft. What, 
exactly, I don't know. It doesn't mean they'll do it but the planning is going 
on. People with some specific skill that the military wants. People who can 
speak Arabic, Farsi, or Pashto. People who retired from the military and have 
experience in some area where the current forces are weak. This could really 
happen. 

The war is going so badly now that a general draft is being discussed. 
Earlier, the White House was strongly against a draft because people remember 
Vietnam and how anti-draft protests became such a huge issue. Charles Rangel, a 
Democrat, started talking about a draft a year ago as a way to point out how 
minorities would die at a disproportionate rate in the all-volunteer armed services 
if we went on to an extended war (which we're in now -- it's not "over" as 
Bush said many months ago). A lot of young people with limited opportunities 
join the military as a way to get ahead, while rich kids go to college or get 
businesses handed to them by daddy. When you have a draft (in theory, at least), 
the burden is spread over a wider spectrum of society. Of course, the really 
privileged kids would still get out of having to serve. They could just emulate 
our fearless leader:  get daddy to pull strings so they could get into the 
National Guard AND away from combat, and then pull more strings so they can 
quit. 

Now, with the military stretched so thin, a draft is becoming a real 
possibility. However, all the parents remember Vietnam, and Bush doesn't want millions 
of moms showing up at the White House to protest.  

Also, i want to point out that there are many women in the military now. 
There would be no way to draft men without drafting women too; there would be 
constitutional challenges. I don't think the American public will stand for the 
drafting of women. Only in extremely rare circumstances have nations sent their 
women to war. It just doesn't make sense to kill off the women, because future 
generations would be lost. So, starting a general draft is a real hornet's 
nest, and if you see Republicans urging one, yeah ... it's time to move to 
Canada.

Even WITH Celine Dion, Canada looks pretty good about now.

Anything that burns that was previously alive gives off carbon 
monoxide.  I've never heard claims before that there's any correlation 
between CO and cancer.  I have smoked many things - herbal cigs, 
cloves,  and tobacco straight out of a glass pipe - I can say with 
certainty that the lightheaded / nauseas feeling comes from the 
nicotine.  If you want to get a rush from O2 dep. just hyperventilate.  I 
do emissions testing.. on cars.. and I smoke.  I can tell the difference 
between the cigarette and the CO.

dude, what'd you say about people talking out of their ass on 4/20?

I used a medical cannabis prescription to pass a STATE drug test with a 
positive result.

Marinol doesn't work for me.  Marinol doesn't work for a lot of people.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] 420!!!!BABY!!!!!!HA HA!!!!!!


This is how I feel about things,

I'm not christian/catholic or whatever, I do not believe "god" created
everything on earth. I do believe however that the universe was designed to
fuel/feed itself. If it was a simple world, without heavily influence by
manmade instruments, I believe the world has everything to support itself,
and its inhabitants supported naturally. Disease, and whatever issues could
be cured from various products all around us. But our world is at a point
where so much damage has already been done. Diseases and such have surpassed
natures ability to heal, and its our fault basically. We created stronger
diseases that the world isn't designed to support, we've made organisms
stronger, that could withstand any previous normal means for treatment, with
our industry, air pullution, chemicals we've created n such.

Thats the onl;y drawback really, that you can live a natural type of
existance in efforts to keep away and avoid illness now better than you can
immediately cure it. You only need strong antibiotics because diseases are
stronger now because of our efforts to treat them and such.

The natural method is more of a preventative means, and it works, but still
the world more or less has emphasized finding manufactured remedies for
things instead of exploring for components which are already here that do
the same if not better.

I'm allergic to penicillin actually. And isn't a carcinogen a bi-product of
processing various materials ? Like do cancinogens grow on/in trees ?

And yes, I do prefer natural means to things like antibiotics. but to
confess, the natural means are sometimes processed in some fashion, like
mineral supplements, herbal supplements. . .but these elements are also
present and naturally occuring in materials we were originally meant to
eat/drink.
Also again, little research has been done on these methods.
I have fought off illnesses with copper, and silver that no man made
chemical or antibiotic could even touch. My father is 78 and has had issues
from meds he's been taking for years that destroy his skin, make it really
thin, bruises, tears super easily. . .he takes meds which are supposed to
help that also, and has for years, but they don't work. I started him on
copper supplements (copper is required by the body to build connective
tissues) and he doesn't bruise at all much anymore, his skin is healing,
doesn't tear. . . it even firms skin and removes wrinkles.

I haven't had a cold in almost 2 years, haven't had the flu since I was like
12, and never get flu shots.

Silver is a wonderful detoxifier. Theres actually like 80 minerals we
absolutely need on a day to day basis, to ward off things like arthritis,
bone deterioration, illnesses, and most everyone in the world is deficient.
But a major source of all of these in large amounts is also a naturally
occurring substance. Most people don't believe it, but if people intake
(don't even pay attention to the RDA) enough of the required minerals, they
WILL notice that they hardly ever get sick anymore, and they WILL live much
much longer lives.

people argue that science has helped us live longer lives, and in ways it
has, but science has also helped us find and mine/grow/harvest naturally
occurring remedies to most all ailments also, which hundreds of years ago
weren't really thought of. When was the last time you saw anything about the
old west, and people taking their vitamins, or eating their vegetables. . .
it's the meat eating thats killed people with high blood pressure, and the
chemical companies who are called on to try to mask the real issue.

about tobacco vs extasy. . . tobacco obviously wasn't meant for an extasy
type of enlightenment.Lots of things have their specific purpose, and
broader purposes. I feel shrooms gave me a much deeper sense of extasy
(spiritual/emotional) than I ever felt with E. And it was a more
natural/real/totally understood feeling, not the fake type of happy e gives
you. But extasy in knowing your purpose, being fulfilled, being "ok" with
everything everywhere. I know I emphasize minerals in this post, but other
naturally occurring means are also suitable remedies for anything from pain,
stress, bleeding, skin healing, infection prevention and so forth.

basically the point is, everything we need is around us, but less than there
used to be cuz of the population of course. It's our environment that we
created and live in which create some people's needs for manufactured
remedies. Nature has the cure to everything, and we would never need quick
vaccines for super illnesses that can kill you in a matter of days, if we
didn't create an environment where the disease needed to develop in a way to
become so unnaturally strong. Otherwise the natural way would work for
everyone, but if someone doesn't follow the rules, they get the super
diseases we helped develop and need the super cures we had to create because
of ourselves.

Thou Shalt Not Steal? Christian Teens Seen Pirating Gospel Music Online

By: Frank Meyer

04-20-2004

CYBERSPACE - The Gospel Music Association isn't exactly singing 
"hallelujah" over the news that avowedly Christian teenagers are getting 
gospel music through Internet downloads and CD burnings at a rate 
comparable to that of secular music fans in the vast peer-to-peer community.

Association president John Styll told the Dallas Morning News he was 
surprised and disappointed to learn of Christian teenagers behaving so 
similarly to non-Christian teens when it came to music downloading.

But the downloaders themselves don't quite see it that way, Agape Press 
said. "Talks with (Christian) teens reveal that many simply do not think of 
it as stealing when they copy CDs or download free music from the Internet, 
or even when they share such unauthorized copies with others," the news 
service said.

A poll taken by the Barna Group, which performs tracking and surveying from 
a religious perspective, says one in 10 Christian teens they surveyed 
consider online music piracy to be morally wrong and 64 percent of them 
said they participated in one or another kind of music piracy.

Agape also said that "many" adult believers "and even church leaders" think 
Christian teenagers downloading gospel music from cyberspace is no big 
deal. "Some suggest," the news service said, "that getting the gospel 
message out should matter more to industry professionals than getting paid 
anyway."

Tell that to Barry Landis, president of gospel label Word Records. "You 
would never steal Bibles to give them away," he told the Morning News. "You 
shouldn't steal Christian music to give away, either."

"Many persons have a wrong idea of what constitutes true happiness.  It is 
not attained through self-gratification, but through fidelity to a purpose."
-Helen Keller

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the 
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become 
visible."
-Jacques Attali in his seminal text "Noise"

"I loved the focus in the early days of Wicked on the pagan aspects of 
life. The natural cycles of the full moons, being out in nature, on the 
beach, free, alive, unbridled, wild and spontaneous. There is no club, 
party or other sound system that has ever achieved anything close to that..."
-Jeno, on the early days of Wicked and the Full Moon Raves

`We Built This City' tops Blender's 50 worst songs list

Tuesday, April 20, 2004
©2004 Associated Press

(04-20) 14:18 PDT NEW YORK (AP) --

Starship may have built this city on rock and roll, but Blender magazine is 
tearing it down, naming the band's "We Built This City" as the worst song 
ever.

Some tunes on the "50 Worst Songs Ever!" list were selected for their 
melodies, others "are wretchedly performed" and "quite a few don't make 
sense whatsoever," the magazine said.

The list, which appears in the May issue, includes songs by New Kids on the 
Block, Meat Loaf, The Doors, Lionel Richie, Hammer and The Beach Boys, among 
others.

Blender describes 1985's "We Built This City" as "the truly horrible sound 
of a band taking the corporate dollar while sneering at those who take the 
corporate dollar."

Starship lead singer Grace Slick says, "This is not me," when the magazine 
reminds her of the tune. "Now you're an actor. It's the same as Meryl Streep 
playing Joan of Arc."

Rounding out the top 10: "Achy Breaky Heart," Billy Ray Cyrus; "Everybody 
Have Fun Tonight" Wang Chung; "Rollin'," Limp Bizkit; "Ice Ice Baby," 
Vanilla Ice; "The Heart of Rock & Roll," Huey Lewis and the News; "Don't 
Worry Be Happy," Bobby McFerrin; "Party All the Time," Eddie Murphy; 
"American Life," Madonna; and "Ebony and Ivory," Paul McCartney and Stevie 
Wonder.

Other songs on the list: Toby Keith's "Courtesy of the Red, White and Blue" 
(No. 22); Whitney Houston's "Greatest Love of All" (No. 30); Ricky Martin's 
"She Bangs" (No. 39); Billy Joel's "We Didn't Start the Fire" (No. 41); 
Simon & Garfunkel's "The Sounds of Silence" (No. 42); The Beatles' 
"Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da" (No. 48); and Celine Dion's "My Heart Will Go On" (No. 
50).

Blender and VH1's TV special "50 Most Awesomely Bad Songs ... Ever" airs May 
12.

***********************************************



Liquidvinyldjs.com is very proud to present..


 MAY DAY! .
Saturday, May 1st 2004
8:00pm - 4:00am
500 Person Capacity
1 ROOM VIRGIN LOCATION - Centrally located in the Bay Area!
ALL RESPONSIBLE AGES WELCOME!


With MAY DAY!, we would like to celebrate the beginnings of Summer with a
very intimate 1 room experience! Join us as we kick the summer of just right
in a

brand new location, close to everyone here in the Bay Area!


DJ's for the night:


|| DJ LUNA-C
[Kniteforce North American Tour || KFA/Kniteforce, UK] - SPECIAL BIRTHDAY
SET!!
We are very proud to bring DJ LUNA-C to the Bay for his special Birthday
Set. This will be the last stop on his very exclusive Kniteforce North
American

Tour, and this night just happens to be on his birthday! He's coming
prepared to showcase a very special set exclusive to us here in San
Francisco, which is

sure to absolutely blow you away. If you've seen LUNA-C at any of our past
events, you know he will completely take the roof off the place and have you

moving, from the first record to the last! Please allow us to wish our good
friend a very Happy Birthday here in the Bay!

|| CLOUDSKIPPER vs. THE NICE GUYS
[Raw Elements/Kniteforce/Liquidvinyldjs.com vs. Liquidvinyldjs.com/K-12] -
3X6 INSANITY SET!
In what is sure to be one of the more talked about sets this year,
Cloudskipper faces off against The Nice Guys. Relatively little is known
about The Nice

Guys, except, well, they're nice. In any case, be prepared for in your face
up front hardcore, a lot of unreleased music, as well as onstage antics that
can

only be described as pure madness!

|| DJ TRONIC
[Resistance Recordings/Liquidvinyldjs.com/CHR]
In preparation for his anticipated European tour, Tronic's set is going to
be chalked full of brand new hard hittin material! This will be his last
local

appearance before he heads off to Europe for 2 weeks, so be ready for the
Hard Beats!

|| MAJERE
[Elektrosorcery, DJMajere.com] - SPECIAL TRANCECORE/FREEFORM SET!
In a rare appearance playing trancecore/freeform, Majere is taking a bit of
a step back into his roots. Expect a set of fast and hard mind melting
music,

which can only be appreciated by those ready to move!

|| THE DOCTOR & MC FADER
[Liquidvinyldjs.com/Bayraves.com || Gravitycrew.com/Emceeds]
Quite possibly one of the best DnB/Jungle DJ's in Northern California, The
Doctor has become a household name. You can catch him almost every weekend
droppin

those hard hittin tracks all over! In tow is the MC called Fader, in which
really needs no introduction. These two go together like steak and eggs,
like

butter on toast, like.. well you get the idea!

|| DJ J-MARR
[Liquidvinyldjs.com/Bayraves.com] - FAREWELL SET!
The man, the myth, the legend. Need we say more? Known from up and down the
West Coast for not only his music, but also his energetic charisma, J-Marr
is a

legend in the scene. This will be his last set behind the decks, ending a
tenure other DJ's can only dream about. Be there to witness J-Marr rocking
in his

usual manner, for the last time!

|| CARLOS ALFONZO vs. RECLIPSE
[Resistance Recordings/Soop Recordings vs. D&A Music/Bayraves]
The battle of the BBQ Iron Chef Carlos and the Maddest Mad DJ around, this
will be a treat to all those who appreciated hard techno... and we do mean
HARD.

These two will come out swingin' with pure dancefloor driven material.. get
ready to rock!

|| LEON COOK vs. PETER GO-ZANIA!
[Hardscience/Logik Pro Audio]
These two have been rapidly rising among the Hardcore faithful here in the
Bay, and with their crowd rockin performances and talent behind the decks,
it's

really no wonder why. Expect a set full of freeform and upfront Hardcore
material only these guys bring to the table.

|| DJ DMS
[Oakland Bounce/Dream Crew]


>From the same people who brought you HAPPY TOGETHER 1 & 2, OVERLOAD 1, 2, &
3, SUMMER ROCKIN, and GET UP!. MAY DAY will be an extremely special night to
us,

where we are celebrating the coming of summer, as well as our good friend
LUNA-C's birthday. If you've loved the vibe and sharing of the music we've
had at

past events, this will be no different!!

Subject: [sfraves] Anone know anyone in Minneapolis?

Hi All,
    I'm in Minneapolis for 2 weeks, and would love to get a taste of the 
local party scene while I'm here. I've tried posting to a local message 
board, but have gotten no response. I know it's a long shot, but does 
anyone know anyone out here that might be able to point me in the right 
direction? I've only been here for 3 days, and I already miss our scene. 
:-(  See you all soon!

Happy

So I hear Misstress Barbara is going to be at the End Up Sunday morning. 
Seeing as that is really not my thing, anyone know where she might be 
playing Saturday night? I know she's not just here to play at the End Up... 
Gotta be somewhere in The Bay on Saturday night... Right?

AUDi,
Gavin

1.  AB 2433 FAILS TO GET OUT OF STATE ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE

The SFLNC is disappointed to announce that AB 2433, state legislation
to allow for a later last call in San Francisco, failed to make it out
of committee
at the State Assembly, effectively killing any chance of passage this
year.

While San Francisco officials were heavily in support of the bill,
statewide anti alcohol groups lined up against AB2433, claiming that
it would lead inevitably to later last call in other parts of the
State.

Police Officers from Oakland also testified that later last call in
San
Francisco would create traffic accidents in Oakland that their
Department
could not fiscally handle.  It is unclear whether those officers were
speaking officially for the City of Oakland or just as individuals,
but
their testimony had an effect on the statewide legislators.

In addition, testimony from a mother of a person killed by a drunk
driver clearly made the legislators uncomfortable in voting for the
legislation.
Assemblymember Leno attempted to contest their arguments, but the
format of the assembly did not offer much chance for rebuttal.  Many
democratic legislators left the room after the Mother Against Drunk
Drivers testimony and did not vote, so there were not enough votes to
move the bill out of committee.

San Francisco was clearly in support of AB 2433, with Assemblymembers
Leno and Leland Yee, Mayor Newsom, 9 of 11 Board of Supervisor members
and District Attorney Kamala Harris all in favor, but that was clearly
not enough to overcome the more conservative politics of Sacramento.
We did gain valuable experience with both the Sacramento legislative
process and also with the claims of our opposition, so we more clearly
understand the challenge when  we bring back AB 2433 next year.

The SFLNC would like to thank the 100 committed individuals who
showed up at the End Up at 6am to make the trip to Sacramento.  We'd
also like to thank Assemblymember Mark Leno and his staff for all
their hard work on this and other pro-nightlife legislation.  Make
sure to vote for Mark Leno for Assembly in this falls Assembly
elections.

2.      MAYOR GAVIN NEWSOM SIGNS 18+ AFTERHOURS LEGISLATION

After a two year legislative process, 18+ venues and events in San
Francisco
may now apply to the Entertainment Commission for an after-hours
permit.
The legislation to allow 18+ after-hours, co-sponsored by Supervisors
Bevan
Dufty, Chris Daly and Tom Ammiano, was recently signed into law by
Mayor
Newsom.

The SFLNC first sponsored this legislation last year but it was vetoed
by
Mayor Willie Brown.  This year the legislation was sponsored by the
San
Francisco Youth Commission, with leadership by the SFLNC's Liam Shy.
Congratulations to Commissioner Shy and the Youth Commission, who
revised the original legislation and successfully lobbied at City Hall
to get the legislation passed by the Board and the Mayor.  It is great
to see San Francisco youth fighting for their rights and taking
control of an element of their own destiny.   Hopefully, we'll be
seeing legal 18+ late night events by the summer.

3.  AB 2296, AN ABC REFORM BILL, PASSES IN SACRAMENTO

While our last call legislation was defeated at the State Assembly,
the SFLNC and Mark Leno did score a small win recently at the State
Assembly.  AB 2296,  a bill designed to prevent abuse of ABC licensing
hearings for bars and nightclubs, passed unanimously with bipartisan
support out of the Assembly Government Organization Committee last
week.

When an opponent of a nightclub asks to protest the issuance of a
liquor license, the ABC is currently required to hold a hearing
regardless of the merits of the opponent's complaint. Often times this
hearing requirement is used as a tactic to stall the process with the
protestor never even showing up to the hearing. This wastes the time
and money of nightclubs and the ABC.

AB 2296 would allow the ABC to require protestors of venues to show
some responsibility. If a venue is being protested for unreasonable
concerns, the ABC can send a letter notifying the protestor that they
find their complaints to be unreasonable and they intend to approve
the license. The protestor could still have a hearing in this case, to
ensure the rights of having neighborhood concerns heard, but would be
required to notify the ABC that they would still like to have a
hearing and confirm they intend to show up. Otherwise the ABC and
nightclub owners can drop the protest without having a hearing.


4.  PLANNING COMMISSION HEARING TODAY ON CHARLIE'S CLUB

The SFLNC needs people to attend a hearing Thursday, April 22th at 3
PM in
room 400 of City Hall. The hearing is at the Planning Commission and
is a
request by the Charlie's Studio Club to receive a Place of
Entertainment
permit.

The SFLNC became involved in this issue when the owner of the lounge
contacted us to find out if it was true that he needed to have a
permit to
have a DJ play music in his 49 person cocktail lounge in Bernal
Heights.
The answer was "yes" and in the process of applying for the permit a
few
neighbors got involved in opposing his application .  Right now they
are
doing everything possible to make sure that his permit is not granted.
  Other neighbors, including those living overtop of the bar, are
supportive of the permit request.

This is a case where the owner has invested much money and effort in
renovations  and soundproofing and turned  what some referred to as a
"scary
biker bar" into a very cool lounge.   Yet still some folks don't want
a DJ
to play in his small bar.

That brings us to the hearing  on Thursday.  Please show your support
of San
Francisco Culture; tell the government to support the entertainment
community by showing up at the hearing.   You will not be required to
speak;
your presence in the audience will be enough.

in a similar vein: when driving by 1015 folsom last saturday,
we noticed that there was a "notice of suspension" on the
doors.  obviously the place was empty.

not sure if this was discussed on-list or not (i've been kind
of busy) but i was wondering what was up.

"The welfare of the people in particular has always been the alibi of 
tyrants, and it provides the further advantage of giving the servants of 
tyranny a good conscience."
-Albert Camus

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the 
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become 
visible."
-Jacques Attali in his seminal text "Noise"

"I loved the focus in the early days of Wicked on the pagan aspects of 
life. The natural cycles of the full moons, being out in nature, on the 
beach, free, alive, unbridled, wild and spontaneous. There is no club, 
party or other sound system that has ever achieved anything close to that..."
-Jeno, on the early days of Wicked and the Full Moon Raves

So I hear Misstress Barbara is going to be at the End Up Sunday morning. 
Seeing as that is really not my thing, anyone know where she might be 
playing Saturday night? I know she's not just here to play at the End Up... 
Gotta be somewhere in The Bay on Saturday night... Right?

So I hear Misstress Barbara is going to be at the End Up Sunday morning. 
Seeing as that is really not my thing, anyone know where she might be 
playing Saturday night? I know she's not just here to play at the End Up... 
Gotta be somewhere in The Bay on Saturday night... Right?

AUDi,
Gavin

I hear from someone who talked with Ira it's closing for 2 weeks due to a
court judgment/lawsuit/plea bargain due to a certain raid that happened
awhile back.

"The welfare of the people in particular has always been the alibi of
tyrants, and it provides the further advantage of giving the servants of
tyranny a good conscience."
-Albert Camus

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become
visible."
-Jacques Attali in his seminal text "Noise"

"I loved the focus in the early days of Wicked on the pagan aspects of
life. The natural cycles of the full moons, being out in nature, on the
beach, free, alive, unbridled, wild and spontaneous. There is no club,
party or other sound system that has ever achieved anything close to
that..."
-Jeno, on the early days of Wicked and the Full Moon Raves

It stems back to the previous legal trouble 1015 had. Go to the website for
1015 and look at the forums. You'll find the info. Personally I could care
less if 1015 never comes back. The downside is the trashy ass bitches that
flood the place will flood other spaces now.

*yay* =P

I think you mean you could NOT care less.

Trashy bitches with no where to go may be the downside, but the big upside 
would be all the talent that pretty much only stops there traveling the 
circut would now be playing at other clubs. Or at least ABLE to play at 
other clubs if they wanted another option as a viable Bay area booking 
opportunity.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] 1015 folsom (was: [sfraves] SFLNC LATE NIGHT NEWS)

Mezzanine and Ruby Skye are the replacements for 1015 and the big talent
plays at both of those venues. 1015 needs a serious overhaul of its image.
1015 to me is damn near the same as a SoundFactory or City Nights type of
venue. It's the place that everyone goes to because it's big and that's all
the out-of-towners know. There is so much that I miss talent wise and all
because 1015 is a POS venue with a trashy ass, fucked up, crowd that ruins
the place.

I'm not sticking up for 1015, but I've had many great nights with that =
disco ball falling on me, arms in the air, and some great DJ playing =
great tracks.

Mezzanine and Ruby Skye are the replacements for 1015 and the big talent
plays at both of those venues. 1015 needs a serious overhaul of its =
image.
1015 to me is damn near the same as a SoundFactory or City Nights type =

venue. It's the place that everyone goes to because it's big and that's =
all
the out-of-towners know. There is so much that I miss talent wise and =
all
because 1015 is a POS venue with a trashy ass, fucked up, crowd that =

the place.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] 1015 folsom (was: [sfraves] SFLNC LATE NIGHT NEWS)


I just don't like 1015 in general. It's the logistics of the building that 
makes it sh@tty to me. If I'm getting to party to great music in a quality 
venue, I could not care less how trashy the tourist clubbers around me are. 
It's the structure itself that kind of ruins 1015 to me.

Ruby Skye and Mezzanine are the replacements and are my favorite clubs in 
the city and besides for small shows thrown by friends, the only large clubs 
in the city I'll go to.

Now if they start getting Carl Cox, Oliver Lieb, Derrick Carter, & Misstress 
Barbara at those two clubs (I know, Richie Hawtin @ Mezzanine was a start) 
instead of having them play at 1015 every time they come to town, there will 
really be no need for 1015 anymore. Although, an overhaul of the club could 
change everything. But would be too expensive, even for them...

> 1.  AB 2433 FAILS TO GET OUT OF STATE ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE

I was there, and although I was dissapointed in the outcome,
there was something that dissapointed me even more.

I suppose it is "business as usual", but while this committee
met, the individual members felt free to come and go as they
pleased. It was like watching a continual dance of musical
chairs for two hours. Almost half of that time, the number
present wasn't even enough for a chorum.

In my ideal world, I suppose, the members of the committee are
actually required to attend the committee meetings. They'd
vote on what was brought in front of them. And they wouldn't
show up for the last 5 minutes of a 50 minute presentation by
10 different people, and then vote. Or attend the whole thing,
and not vote.

If that's the way our state allows its paid assembly members
to act, then it's even more broken than I thought.

In 11 years of observing California politics, this is the
most deeply dissapointing thing I have ever seen. These
representatives sorely misused and worse, underused their
positions. They represented no one. They don't deserve to
be paid.

Sean

A la TWILO in NYC. I saw some seriously amazing acts @ Twilo, but I can see 
why they got shut down. Sounds like 1015 is the same way....

Subject: Re: [sfraves] SFLNC LATE NIGHT NEWS

wow hmm. . .

I would have spoke against the alcohol thing if I was there personally. . .
thats why i didn't go mostly, to not like oppose old friends, but also I
really didn't think something like that would pass.
I would have talked about being a kid, when I was at my dads house, n him n
my mom were drinking, got into big fights that ended in stuff flying around
and my mother kinda forcibly driving me home drunk, sometimes running off
the road, sometimes passing out on the side of the road. . .
stuff like that. . . I have old friends who I think are such idiots, one of
them have sideswiped several cars and driven off after driving home from
bars n such. . . On halloween, some drunk construction worker dressed guy
driving a truck just got pissed of waiting in traffic and hit 4 cars (that I
could see) on purpose while he did a bad 3pt turn and sped off down the
wrong way. . .I saw him later on the freeway, which is odd cuz I was stuck
in traffic, and if we both left at the same time then he prolly hit a lot of
other cars before he got out of the city.
Especially places like SF. . .even sober people hit cars like crazy. . .

I am definately anti alcohol. . .  I have been all my life pretty much.. . .
I'm actually happy to see that issue fail there. . .

not to sound mean, but it's kind of a happiness/relief feeling. . .

: )

Subject: Re: [sfraves] 1015 folsom (was: [sfraves] SFLNC LATE NIGHT NEWS)

I missed Twilo by a week. They were shut down "temporarily" and never opened 
back up. And it all happened the week before I was there.

At least they parted out the Twilo sound system on EBAY. That's pretty cool.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] 1015 folsom (was: [sfraves] SFLNC LATE NIGHT NEWS)

The sound there was phenomenal, albeit a bit loud at times depending on the 
DJ. Some of my favorite experiences were there despite the insanely guidoed 
out crowd. Jeff Mills, Sasha & Digweed circa Northern Exposure, Digweed on 
his own. All really amazing shows. Still - the place was shady overall. They 
had metal detectors and secuity with hand-held detectors on hand to pat you 
down big time - shady drug dealings, etc. Hence the shut down....

Subject: Re: [sfraves] SFLNC LATE NIGHT NEWS

What does ANY of that have to do with allowing the serving of alcohol to 
extend from 2AM to 4AM?

I'm pretty much anti-booze too. I can count the number of times I've drank 
on my fingers (no joke). But I have no problem with it. I'm pretty 
indifferent about what may or may not happen if they would allow a later 
last call time, but can see the obvious benefits of places staying open 
later. Can't really see how it would make anything worse than it already is. 
If anything, common sense tells me drunk driving casualties may go down if 
it were to change.

1015 was a great venue back in the day -- before it became, as it were, 
"world class."  As Philip said, Come-Unity was there for many 
years.  Further, there were great events with local DJs like Product in the 
early nineties.  Gus Bean had a regular gay event there on Saturday nights.
Prior to the "1015" days, the venue was called "Das Klub."  And in the 
seventies it was a bisexual bath house called the "Sutro Baths."

Last time I was there was at Come-Unity.  Malachy moved it to Barneveld for 
a spell after that because neither the patrons of the DJs could deal with 
the invasive security and changing vibe.  Neither could I.

Love,

Apollo

Now, at clubs without an afterhours permit,  the bar closes at 1:30am and 
drinkers are hurled out on the streets at 2:00 am.  I always thought this 
was unsafe and lacking in common sense.

that's pretty funny. I have the album by Orleans, lol. Those albums are so

Subject: Re: [sfraves] SFLNC LATE NIGHT NEWS

I don't have a problem with alcohol, I have a problem with people who can't 
handle themselves on it. I place blame where it needs placed. For every one 
person I have met who cannot conduct themselves while on it, I have met 10 
more who can. I have bartended, and worked at several nightclubs, and the 
amount of times i have had to bounce people out for being idiots, and the 
amount of times I have ever heard of any patrons having run ins w/ the law, 
or wrecking their cars, etc. is extremely LOW.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] 1015 folsom (was: [sfraves] SFLNC LATE NIGHT NEWS)

Club 1015 and Ira can fall off the earth for all I care.  

I've been to 1015 about 12 times since '93. Every time I've been
there I've been searched within an inch of my life. I've been denied
entrance because I had prescription medication. I've seen employees
peering at people in the doorless bathroom stalls. I've been told I
can stand here. Can't do this.  Can't do that. Seen so many other
people hassled I wonder why they bother.

If they can't run a business without doing all that, they don't
deserve any. I've been to a lot of clubs, and 1015 has the rudest
staff I've ever seen, by far.

Let it fall. SF doesn't really need it anyway.

Hallelujah Phillip!

On most parts I concur that the patrons are one variable that can effect a
club's environment and people's perception of club itself.

There are many others too:
There is a fine line between an event *PROMOTER* or *CREW*, how that
crew acts, throws events, how organized they are, what music and
artists they book, and how they run an event (think weekly, monthly,
etc) at a *VENUE* they might have secured but may or may not own.

versus:

The venue itself, permitting, music genres, venue ownership, layout of the
club, ventilation, security, how you are treated, cost to get in the the
door, soundsystem, bathroom cleanliness, drink cost, other available
services offered by the venue, DJ bookings, and other items which can
all effect one's experience at a club.

coupled with:

One's attitude towards it and the scene in general, one's personality,
energy, vibe, and the interactive participation of the club goer. The
patron effects the energy at a club at well. So many variables mentioned,
others not that can effect one's overall experience. It's up to you (and
other patrons) to enjoy oneself along the way.

I've been to many Spundae's at 1015, and always enjoyed each time, dancing
my booty off.

Cheerios,

Karina

Subject: RE: [sfraves] SFLNC LATE NIGHT NEWS

Just to be the minority here, Jack's digs the brew. :)

Ak, I see your point about personal problems with your family and drinking,
but that doesn't make
ALL the apples bad. Take Marco and me, we have had many pints together and I
haven't even taken a swing at him yet! I believe Ben Franklin said it best
"Beer is living proof that God loves us and wants us to be happy." - Now,
downing a 1/5th of Gin is a different story. Having shots in the morning so
you can to work is a different story. Drinking until you can't see and
pissing yourself is a different story. Everything in moderation.

When I was in Europe all the Social/Community meetings took place centered
around, or in a beer garden. These were enormous halls, or fields sometimes
holding up to 2 - 3,000 heads where people could socialize and kids could
play in the open. The hofbrauhaus Las Vegas is trying to recreate that, but
reality tells me that the US isn't mature enough for it.

I would even say I wouldn't support a later last call just for the points
mentioned above. I know I am responsible, but who knows about my fellow
brother's and sister's. I think you would see an increase in drinking
related deaths. But I am also totally against and sort of decrease in the
last call, ie moving it to midnight. Just let it be.

oh well, I got waaaay off topic, but my closing point is, like everything
else there are a few who ruin it for all. Jack out.

Oh yeah and I dig good beer!

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Is there anywhere for techno?

I say we need a party *like* Alumni, Anyone here want to bring back
oldskool techno from the dead of people's crates and onto the dancefloor?
There are so many hits from back in the day (1990-1996) I'd love to hear
specifically played at an event. A series of events like this would be
nice too - bringing back all the years and couple it with the Nu-School of
Techno from then and beyond into the 21st century. I'd love to hear 8
hours of Techno like i'm listening to the 8 hours of acid house and
classic house from the Alumni set in January. I know, two seperate genres,
but I love it all baby... It was House, Acid House and Techno, along with
breaks that got my booty starting to Shake 14 years ago...

Want help planning a party? If someone doesn't have an interest.. maybe
I'll just do it... Long live Techno....

I'd love to hear these on the dancefloor for instance:

Shut Up - New York Style
Inssomniak (*I Come Back) -concrete mix - D.J.P.C.
elvis has left the building - The Castle
Paranoid - Paranoid
The Dexorcist - DeadSilence
No Sex until Marraige (pre-matrimonial climax version) - R.J.'s Rule
Float in a Dream of Ex-tc (667 Beats) - Fire on High
808 State - Excel  -  1 San Francicsco
808 State - Gorgeous - Europa, Nimbus, Sexy Dancer
Temple of Dreams - Messiah
Evapor-8 (Inciner-8 Mix) - Altern-8
Papaua New Guinea - The Future Sound of London
I know you like it - React 2 Rhythm
Digeridoo - The Aphex Twin
Incubus - The Spirit
Where is your Evidence - Frequency
Frequency - Altern 8
Sychologic P.S.P. - Nexus 21
Wave of the future - Heavyweight
Let's Do it Again - Project B12
Stream - Cyclone

Too many others to list .... For all those who say Fuck Techno, I say,
Fuck to Techno then repeat the following Mantra:

Viva Le Techno!

Paix,

Karina

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Is there anywhere for techno?

I tried to set up an event back east that showcased both old and new styles 
throught the night. Sort of an Old Skool vs. Nu Skool style event. A mixed 
batch of locals and well-knowns playing a mix of both styles. Maybe it's 
just because I do that in my own sets that the idea appeals to me so much, 
but it would be a neat way of seeing the progression of genres, styles, etc. 
The idea got sparked after seeing DJ Slipmatt (from SL2 fame) a year or so 
back. He was so amazing, and played both old and new stuff - and had the 
main room @ Buzz in DC positively hopping from beginning to end. People were 
talking about it for weeks afterwards.

Anyone up for that? I know I'd be into helping any way I could for something 
like that....

i dunno - i've had different experiences.

even before i worked there, i was able to sneak in multiple
water bottles filled with sake.  why did i do this, you ask? 
because 1: i'm a drunk, 2: fucking 1:45am last call.  club
stays open till 6am, sometimes 8am.

one time i was able to get 3 water bottles full of sake in. 
this was most likely in 1997-1998.  another time i brought in a
backpack full of liquor so we could make our own long island
ice teas.  full bottles of triple sec, rum, tequila, vodka.  we
bought the coke from the bar.  ;)

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Is there anywhere for techno?

Yeh, Greg is the mother effi'n man. But even though they called hardcore 
(back when it did not suck) tekno all those years ago, it really never was. 
I think Greg is dope at everything BUT techno. And even at that, he's a 
better techno jock than most I've heard on the West coast. He's got the 
skills of a dope techno deejay for sure. Just not the soul of one.

--=====================_936186==.ALT
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"; format=flowed

Here is a list of local activities in support of the DPA's day of protest 
against anti-RAVE and other legislation that threaten the music community 
in general:


California

Cubensis, Southern California's Grateful Dead music tribute band will be 
performing. Proceeds will benefit Drug Policy Alliance.

Thursday, April 29th

Humanities Bldg, Rm 133

San Francisco debut of "Generation E." Co-sponsored by DanceSafe and CEASE 
(Creating Empowerment through Alcohol & Substance-abuse Education) at SFSU. 
"Generation E" is a new documentary video on the passage of the RAVE Act. 
The documentary traces the recent history of publicity surrounding raves 
and "club drugs," legislative actions regarding San Francisco late-night 
recreation, key flaws in the drug war, and examples of harm reduction 
alternatives to the perceived problems of raves or other youth recreation.

In addition to these events, supporters are passing out petitions and 
holding benefits in dozens of other cities.  From NYC:

APRIL 24th
Liquid Sound Lounge-WBAI 99.5FM
7p-9:30p eastern time (New York City)
live stream 
<http://www.liquidsoundlounge.com>http://www.liquidsoundlounge.com or 
<http://www.wbai.org>http://www.wbai.org
and archived shortly after at 
<http://www.undergroundnyc.com>http://www.undergroundnyc.com

Host and producers of Liquid Sound Lounge, Jeannie Hopper brings together 
an audio collage of music and interviews with various activists and groups

"The welfare of the people in particular has always been the alibi of 
tyrants, and it provides the further advantage of giving the servants of 
tyranny a good conscience."
-Albert Camus

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the 
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become 
visible."
-Jacques Attali in his seminal text "Noise"

"I loved the focus in the early days of Wicked on the pagan aspects of 
life. The natural cycles of the full moons, being out in nature, on the 
beach, free, alive, unbridled, wild and spontaneous. There is no club, 
party or other sound system that has ever achieved anything close to that..."
-Jeno, on the early days of Wicked and the Full Moon Raves

Sex, Drugs, and Techno Music
Why the rap against Ecstasy has a familiar ring to it
By Jacob Sullum

Last spring, the Chicago City Council decided "to crack down on wild=20
rave parties that lure youngsters into environments loaded with=20
dangerous club drugs, underage drinking and sometimes predatory sexual=20=

behavior," as the Chicago Tribune put it. The newspaper described raves=20=

as "one-night-only parties -- often held in warehouses or secret=20
locations where people pay to dance, do drugs, play loud music, and=20
engage in random sex acts." Taking a dim view of such goings-on, the=20
city council passed an ordinance threatening to jail building owners or=20=

managers who allowed raves to be held on their property. Mayor Richard=20=

Daley took the occasion to "lash out at the people who produce the huge=20=

rogue dance parties where Ecstasy and other designer drugs are widely=20
used." In Daley=92s view, rave promoters were deliberately seducing the=20=

innocent. "They are after all of our children," he warned. "Parents=20
should be outraged by this." ...

Subject: [sfraves] NRR: Banana Thieves

I just read an article that farmers in Hawaii's North Shore are having 
problems with poaching from their various fruit orchards & fish ponds. 
As a swift counter-measure for this problem, I think that we should 
offer a "ravers for hire" service-- I'm almost certain that small scale 
strategically placed 24/7 raves in the various places that are getting 
(or could be) stolen from, our partyin' presence would certainly scare 
away intruders. The dance scene in Hawaii is far too weak to support 
this kind of campaign, so we must step up & do our part, for we of the 
Bay Area are the paragon of groovers who must help our Hawaiian brothers 
& sisters to protect their lush tropical orchards & sandy beaches. [If 
any North Shore farmers are reading this, please note that I will work 
for Matsumoto shave ice & box lunches from Yummy Korean BBQ.]

Aryck,

	The only thing that will probably decrease alcohol use much in the 
near future is if people switch to other drugs. We all know when it 
comes to substance use that "Just Say No" doesn't work. So if you're 
anti-alcohol, I hope that you're encouraging a substitute. Pick your 
favorite substance and promote it, i.e. don't just oppose bars selling 
alcohol past 2am -- talk about how they should be allowed to sell pot, 
ecstasy, LSD, magic mushrooms, whatever, instead. Otherwise you're just 
Nancy Reagan in raver clothing.   8)

Groove on,

>> When an opponent of a nightclub asks to protest the issuance of a

Subject: Re: [sfraves] SFLNC LATE NIGHT NEWS

Sean,

	I'm sure you're right that what you witnessed is "business as usual." 
And while I probably don't know the further details of what goes on 
*behind* the scenes any more than you do, I suspect that it makes that 
hearing look good by comparison.

	Once again I think this points to the problem that government is 
simply way too big. The sheer size and complexity of it means that in 
order for the democratic process is to be upheld, there will be a huge 
number of stakeholders and an endless series of hearings and issues for 
the legislators to educate themselves about. Even if the committee 
members were all acting in good conscience -- which I don't believe for 
a minute -- it would be amazing, in a system with so many demands on 
their time and attention, if they didn't behave somewhat the way you 
describe. Except for the part about not voting, of course. That's sheer 
political cowardice.

	But until they cut way back on the number of ways that they try to run 
our lives, I suspect that none of this will change much. If there were 
fewer issues, it would be easier for the media to take a more in-depth 
look at those issues, and to educate the public on the subject matter 
and to expose any legislators who weren't taking their jobs seriously. 
It would be easier for the public to keep track of how their 
legislators were voting, and who wasn't bothering to vote at all.

	The best way to bring this about, in my view, is to start turning off 
the money tap. Vote "NO" on all taxes, bond measures, fees, etc. This 
will force lawmakers to prioritize and choose which of the things that 
they're spending resources on are things that government actually needs 
to get involved with on a routine basis.

Peace, love & liberty,

Aryck,

	I *strongly* recommend that you take a look at the Cato Institute  
policy analysis, "The Greatest Century That Ever Was: 25 Miraculous  
Trends of the Past 100 Years," by Stephen Moore and Julian L. Simon.

	While Moore and Simon do not focus directly on the issue of "natural"  
vs. "artificial," they do show in very concrete terms the amazing  
amount of improvement that has taken place in the United States over  
the past 100 years. And if you read between the lines, it's pretty  
obvious that much of this progress has come about as a result of  
"artificial" human advances in technology.

	Very few articles I've ever seen manage to capture the big picture of  
where we're at in terms of human civilization the way this one does. If  
you approach it with an open mind I almost guarantee it will change  
your perspective.

Peace, love & liberty,
					<<< Starchild >>>

P.S. -  Lots of ecstasy users (including myself) would disagree that  
the happy feeling e gives you is "fake." For me it's always felt more  
like having my blinders off; being able to see the world in an open,  
positive light.
You say nature has all the cures we need. And what about manufactured  
music? Does nature have all the sounds we need, too? Is house music  
just an unnatural symptom of a sick society? I think not! Why so much  
pessimism about human beings and their creations? Don't be a self-hater  
-- have some human pride, dammit!  8)

"We are convinced that the progress of the 20th century is not a mere  
historical blip but rather the start of a longterm trend of improved  
life on earth."
	-Stephen Moore and Julian Simon

Subject: [sfraves] NRR: My Earth Day with sea otter beads [was [sfraves] ATP: NRR: Umm Am I missing something?]

Ahh, I had a great Earth Day contributing creative talent to a worthy cause.
Last year, at a gem and mineral show, I found some adorable beads that were
painted & shaped like sea otters. I made a necklace with these small
replicas, actually had a "raft" of them strung up (5 sea otters), along with
some black beads.

While on vacation in Monterey, I visited the Friends of the Sea Otter,
www.seaotters.org, and someone noticed my necklace and asked about it. I
volunteered to make more, but work interfered and I never got around to it.

This year, in honor of Earth Day, and because I have the time & materials, I
created three additional sea otter necklaces.

I contacted the Friends of the Sea Otter last month, and they finally got
back to me. They had a grand opening celebration today (moved to the
American Tin Cannery outlet mall).

So, I drove to Monterey today and sold my necklaces to their gift shop. It
was something rewarding to do, for a small amount of money, but really just
to feel like you made a difference. Of course, I had to burn some fossil
fuel to get there! Oh well.

If you are in Monterey, be sure to stop by the store. It's a volunteer
effort (non-profit org) staffed by cool people (nature lovers).

That's it for my Earth Day activities. Now I'm off to string up some more
beads!

Greg VP

Isn't it earth day or something...figured I would have seen some posts from
the "diverse" community. What a beautiful day for Earth Day. that's it, I
leave the sarcasm out of this one.

I think if you know Greg, then you will agree with me that he is just about
the coolest damn person you could come across. I am very "selfish" with my
friends and while I wish him the best on life's journey's, and it sounds
damn exciting, I am still said to see him begin a grand adventure. He is one
of those cats that makes me so happy I subscribed to this list. If I hadn't
I wouldn't have probably never met him.

As Ryan says; He's grate!

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR: My Earth Day with sea otter beads

Thanks Jack, that was nice of you to reply with such a compliment.

We finally have a buyer for our house, a nice family (wife, husband, baby).
Before they came along, we got royally screwed by someone else whose escrow
deposit was invalid due to a stop-payment (and this happened after we signed
a contract).

It's great to have genuine, friendly, people who want our house because they
are starting a family and are tired of paying rent.

It seems that we will be leaving on May 17 (approximate date; you never know
with title companies).

So I will probably be prolific in my last few weeks here. (How many posts do
we get, 6 a day?)
I promise to check my spelling and grammar, and I will not write fictional
messages, either.

Greg

I think if you know Greg, then you will agree with me that he is just about
the coolest damn person you could come across. I am very "selfish" with my
friends and while I wish him the best on life's journey's, and it sounds
damn exciting, I am still said to see him begin a grand adventure. He is one
of those cats that makes me so happy I subscribed to this list. If I hadn't
I wouldn't have probably never met him.

As Ryan says; He's grate!

"The welfare of the people in particular has always been the alibi of 
tyrants, and it provides the further advantage of giving the servants of 
tyranny a good conscience."
-Albert Camus

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the 
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become 
visible."
-Jacques Attali in his seminal text "Noise"

"I loved the focus in the early days of Wicked on the pagan aspects of 
life. The natural cycles of the full moons, being out in nature, on the 
beach, free, alive, unbridled, wild and spontaneous. There is no club, 
party or other sound system that has ever achieved anything close to that..."
-Jeno, on the early days of Wicked and the Full Moon Raves

During Hip Hop's Golden Age Sampling Was A Creative Force
By Davey D
San Jose Mercury News

One of the most frequent complaints these days from those who've been
down with hip-hop for years is that the music has lost its creative
spark.

Today's popular rap songs are viewed as results of a record-industry
formula.  Their subject matter centers on sex and violence.  We get
song after song about macking, pimping, street life and being a playa.

Aside from the redundant themes, critics point to a lack of musical
variety.  Producers such as P.  Diddy epitomize the trend of taking
their main riffs and hooks from classic funk or disco songs and
reworking them.

Folks who've been around for a while cringe when they hear the
reworked version of a vintage Police, Prince or Rick James song.
``Wy are these rappers so lazy?'' they ask.

Actually, the rappers aren't lazy.  But keeping things ``simple''
(that is, not creative) meets today's expectations of the record
industry, and many outside it aren't aware of the creative
stranglehold on rap artists.

To fully understand, one must look back to the most creative period in
rap.  Keep in mind that, for many who came up in the inner city and
became part of the ``hip-hop generation,'' there were no such things
as glee clubs, music classes or bands at school.  Such programs had
been gutted to balance budgets.

For example, I went to one of the best public high schools in the
country, New York's Bronx High School of Science.  It was the
equivalent of today's magnet schools such as Lowell in San Francisco,
but there were no bands or music classes.

For many aspiring musicians who were trying literally to create
something out of nothing, rap music filled a void.  They were inspired
to seek out old James Brown and funk, jazz and blues albums.  In the
early dys, they simply rapped over percussion breaks in popular
songs.

When hip-hop records first came out, from Sugar Hill, backup bands
were hired to replay the old-school classics.  But by the mid-'80s,
the backup bands were disappearing, sampling had become common, and
fledging hip-hop producers were defining how that tool was used.

Producers such as the Latin Rascals, with their signature rapid-fire
cuts and edits; the legendary Marley Marl; hip-house innovator Todd
Terry; a young Teddy Riley; and the late DJ Scott La Rock were among
the first and most innovative masters of sampling.

Many rappers had rejected the formulaic disco music of the '70s and
uninspired funk of the '80s, with its drum machines and listless
singing.  The '80s sampling craze focused on resurrecting James Brown,
Sly Stone, and other funk and soul masters whose music was all but
ignored then by mainstream outlets.

As sampling became more popular, hip-hop DJs got ever more creative
with what had become the genre's premier instrument.  Tey would dig
into the crates and find a James Brown grunt, a Sly Stone drum
pattern, a George Clinton bass line, and then use them to create ``a
music collage.''

When the James Brown-inspired sound began to wane in popularity,
hip-hop artists turned to jazz, sampling Cannonball Adderley, Grover
Washington Jr. and everybody in between.

This period, from 1988 to 1993, is considered the golden age of rap,
its most creative period.  Many of the sampling techniques and
innovative approaches to creating music influenced the whole industry.

But that creative period waned overnight when what Prince has
described as the ``bean counters'' became interested in protecting
intellectual property.  I'll have more on that in my next column.
======================================

Sampling Creativity Squelched  By Record Companies
By Davey D
San Jose Mercury

My last column (Eye, April 2) dealt with the evolution of sampling
into a compelling art form; today, we look at the constraints on
sampling.

Hip-hop producers usedsampling to create intricate music collages
that reflected the artists, genres and time periods of the sampled
material but were also substantially different from them.  Landmark
albums such as the Beastie Boys' ``Paul's Boutique'' (1989) and Public
Enemy's ``Fear of a Black Planet'' (1990) showed the heights sampling
could reach.

Contrary to the beliefs of critics who longed for the ``good ol' days
of real musicianship,'' sampling stayed true in many ways to the
music-making spirit of previous generations.

Bay Area music professor, author and radio personality Ricky Vincent
explains in his book ``The History of Funk'' that sampling was not
much different from the ``riffing'' (or borrowing) and ``vamping''
(twisting) done for decades by musicians.  He points out that artists
ranging from the jazz greats to James Brown and the Average White Band
often riffed and vamped existing harmonies to make them their own.
This concept, he says, was not just a major part of black music but a
cornerstone of all music.

Over the past 20 years, it was only the tools and technologies that
changed: Instead of playing drums, musicians used drum machines.
Instead of playing piano, they used keyboards and synthesizers.
Instead of re-creating older sounds on their instruments, they copied
them directly from recordings.

Vincent goes on to argue that the evolution of music-making has been
cut short by record-industry executives who reaped an economic
windfall by enforcing copyright and intellectual property laws.

Today, no one would argue that a major sample from an earlier work
should not be paid for.  A good example of such a sample can be heard
on MC Hammer's megahit ``U Can't Touch This,'' which borrowed from
Rick James' monster hit ``Super Freak.''

What became sticky was when producers took small bits and pieces from
earlier songs.  For example, what if an artist sampled a small snippet
of ``Super Freak,'' slowed it down, played it backward and added a
fraction of a second from a Prince scream?  Then while the artist was
rappng, he brought in harmony from a popular TV tune behind him?

Although the substance and sound of the result were unique to it,
record labels wanted substantial compensation for everything they
could claim as their own.  The financial claims often were made in the
name of artists, but, as George Clinton once pointed out, he doesn't
get a dime when his music is sampled.

In the early '90s, some companies hired youngsters to work as musical
bounty hunters.  They would listen to new rap records and collect $500
if they could find an obscure drum beat or bass line that had been
sampled.

As a result of the industry response to sampling, some rap artists
were left with little or no profit after paying fees for their
samples.  And God help them if they did a spontaneous rap using a
small portion of an existing harmony or melody.

The economics dictated that sampling be reeled in.  For example, 10
years after Public Enemy introduced ``cram sampling,'' a technique
inspired by Phil Spectre's Wall of Sound recording tchnique, the
group owed about $500,000 for sounds it had borrowed.

Bay Area icons Sway and King Tech released the album ``This or That''
in 1999, and the samples cost them $300,000.  They paid roughly $3,000
each time their collaborator, DJ Revolution, did a scratch.

Some artists, including Dr.  Dre, have simply brought the rights to
old records in order to use samples from them.

But the opportunities for hip-hoppers to borrow from the past are
severely limited today, in contrast to the late '80s and early '90s,
and hip-hop is less creative now.

WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOT! I missed the last one, and am not missing this 
one. I might even cheese out and break out the sweater vest style, lol.

Nothing wrong with reminiscing....

Friday night it was late
I was walking you home
We got down to the gate
And I was dreaming of the night
Would it turn out right
How to tell you girl
I want to build my world around you
Tell you that it's true
I wanna make you understand
I'm talking about a life time plan

That's the way it began
We were hand in hand
Glen Miller's Band was better than before
We yelled and screamed for more
And the porter too
Made us dance across the room
It ended it all too soon
And on the way back home
I promise you, you'll never be alone
Hurry don't be late
I can hardly wait
I said to myself when we're old

We'll go dancing in the dark
Walking through the park and reminiscing
Friday night it was late
I was walking you home
We got down to the gate
And I was dreaming of the night
Would it turn out right
Now as the years roll on
Each time we hear our favorite song
The memories come along
Older times we're missing
Spending the hours reminiscing
Hurry don't be late

I can hardly wait
I said to myself when we're old
We'll go dancing in the dark
Walking through the park and reminiscing
We'll go dancing in the dark
Walking through the park and reminiscing
You should be dancing
Dancing
Dancing
Dancing
And reminiscing

I have a good friend recording in MAC and needs to find a simple program
to record multiple tracks in. He has an afternoon to learn it. He has
two or more wav files he has already recorded and needs to retain the
stereo properties and mix them al together being able to shift the start
and end points of each piece as needed. He is currently using Amadeus
and Bias Peak. So if you have any help it would be great. Thanks

 

Jason

Yanno I would have to say that Messiah - Temple of Dreams and Thunderdome
were hardcore-ish, but in todays terms they're basically trance. 21st
Century Jesus came out in what - 1992? The Shamen - Entact album was
pre-1995 as well. That's pretty damn trancey music right there. Move Any
Mountain anyone? My opinion is based on relative definitions of trance we
have today. Opus III - Mindfruit and Sunscreem - 03 (ozone). Both of those
are pretty fluffy. Luv U More and the eternal epic Fine Day are considered
trance(y) these days. Back then the genre didn't have a name. It wasn't as
firmly set apart from the other genres of the time. Looking back now though,
that music is definitely trance.

There definitely was pre-95 trance.  The genre coalesced during 91-93:  Jam 
& Spoon, MLO, Spicelab, Lords of Acid, Sven Vath, etc.  An offspring of 
acid house and techno.

Are we talking stuff that sounded like some form of trance here?

Because if so, there was obviously mass amounts of music pre-95 that would 
fit the bill. From years of Detroit stuff, to early progressive house (and 
progressive techno), and early German techno. And let's not forget early 
"tech-house".

I thought we were talking about "trance" as a commonly used term to describe 
the sub-genre of electronic music.

 May 22, 2004

There was a book out in '95 I think called Cyberia and it mentions the music 
already being called trance (I'm sure it was written in '94). And I'm not 
sure if anyone mentioned them, but wasn't "Art Of Trance" already around 
before '95???

If it looks like trance, smells like trance, and sounds like trance... it's
trance. The whole genre naming scheme is a farce anyway. This is prove with
dnb and jungle. Same thing to some and to other distinctly different.
Progressive house vs trance has the same problem. So yes, I am talking about
trance in the *commonly used term* here. The term hadn't been coined in the
pre-1995 world, but it did exist.

That's what I was thinking. But I really have no frame of reference. I had 
read about trance in the mid-90's, and it was described so much like techno 
that I wanted to hear it badly, but it was not untill 98 or 99 that I 
actually heard a lot of it at a party, enough to recogize that it was 
"trance".

 Saturday May 22, 2004


Judging what Dutch threw down on the decks at the last Alumni party, I
hardly doubt you'll hear *ANY* trance this time around...unless they
decide to bust out some of the classics. Thump parties are a good place to
hear him play Trance.  I have pictures of many of Dutch's records thrown
down on the decks from the last Alumni, not one single record played in
the 8 hour set between Dutch, Jeno, Markie Mark, Galen and Solar was
"TRANCE", house, ACID house, yes, Trance at that Alumni, was, present
in spirit.... not on the decks.

Here are some samples of what Dutch played:

Subject: RE: [sfraves] nrr - what is song is most "wrong"

I have a track called "The Chicken Track". It starts out with some weird 
spoken wordintro about how irradiated chickens destroy a city. Then the best 
part  - it breaks into this SEVERELY cheesey clubby house type track, with a 
person screaming "Bawk Bawk Bawk Bawk Bawk Ba-Gawk" like a chicken. It is 
possibly the most obnoxious thing on earth, and the best "end of the night 
get the fuck out " track I have ever heard (next to the Pleasurehead remix 
of the Neverending Story theme song).

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Mac Recording help

Well, the Media Access Control address is how Microsoft deals with DRM 
at the Data-Link layer. Obviously his problem in this case is that he 
hasn't registered his MAC address with MS and the authorities. He should 
run Windows Update hourly to remedy this.

	"Stella" by Jam & Spoon (1992?). Not that I'm any expert on the genre  
or electronic music in general, but I'd call that trance. Still one of  
the best dance tracks ever, in my opinion.

Well, the Media Access Control address is how Microsoft deals with DRM 
at the Data-Link layer. Obviously his problem in this case is that he 
hasn't registered his MAC address with MS and the authorities. He should

run Windows Update hourly to remedy this.

Not to beat a dead horse, but everyone here should know that the first =
"trance" song was "Giorgio Moroder - The chase" from the Midnight =
Express soundtrack in 1978.

It has these trance elements:
4/4 beat
arp with filter cut-off sweeps
massive delayed sound effects (just like todays prog)
Written by a German
Remixed by Oakenfold AND Jam and Spoon

If that isn't the first trance song ever then kick me in the face.

Sleep well knowing any degree of name recognition you have is via the same

Hallucinogen did a remix of "On the Run".. not sure if it's an official

May Day Trivia:

=95 Traditional May Day celebrations were pre-Christian agricultural festiv=
als. Eventually the significance was lost and the practices survived merely=
 as popular festivities. (Which can also be said about other holidays: Hall=
oween, Christmas, Easter.)

=95 A widespread superstition held that washing the face in the May Day mor=
ning dew would beautify the skin.

=95 In Hawaii, May Day is Lei Day. Everyone gives the gift of a lei to anot=
her, putting it around the receiver's neck and accompanying the gift with t=
he traditional kiss. Observing practices of the islanders for centuries, Le=
i Day began to be observed officially in 1928. Some Hawaiian celebrations a=
re complete with pageants, a Lei Queen and her court.

=95 In 1889, a congress of world Socialist parties held in Paris voted to s=
upport the U.S. labor movement's demand for an 8-hour day. It chose May 1, =
1890, as a day of demonstrations in favor of the 8-hour day. Afterward, May=
 1 became a holiday called Labor Day in many nations. It resembles the Sept=
ember holiday in the U.S. The holiday is especially important in socialist =
and Communist countries--when political demonstrations are held.

Friday, May 7, 2004 ** Melon : Josh Wink **

Red Melon is proud to finally be able to showcase one of the biggest succes=
s stories in the underground house movement. Ask yourself how many globally=
 respected, underground artist-producer-DJs have turned-down offers to tour=
 with U2, and you will likely draw a short list. Josh Wink is such an artis=
t -- one who is unassuming, yet enjoys a cult following and who places arti=
stic integrity above all else. Owner of Ovum Recordings and remixer of mega=
-talents such as Sting, Depeche Mode and Ladytron, Josh has made only rare =
appearences in San Francisco, so don't miss out.

Supporting Josh will be Dano, Dj and tech house producer from San Francisco=
=2E  After a long winter touring Australia, New Zealand, and Eastern Europe=
, Dano is back in town working in the studio for a few months.  Dano has th=
ree new releases coming out simultaneously on Silicone Soul's Darkroom Dubs=
 imprint, Honchos Music, and Red Melon.  He will be spinning fresh techy gr=
ooves along with red melon biz partner JZ.  No stranger to the Melon experi=
ence, JZ is responsible for some of the most memorable sets in the seven ye=
ars of parties Red Melon has produced.  It will be just like old times!

If you are serious about your Red Melon parties, this Melon is not to be mi=
ssed! Get there before 11:00pm to take advantage of an earlybird cover char=
ge of $10 at San Francisco's newest venue, Mighty, located at 119 Utah St a=
t 15th Street. Mighty is a beautiful renovated warehouse with a touch of te=
chnology and art and the massive sound system that made Club Townsend a San=
 Francisco favorite. All of that plus cheap drinks too! You can't go wrong.=

Didn't see anything about MB on the message boards for Devotion or any
special announcements on the End Up webpage.  *shrug*

I'm trying to talk myself out of showing up anyway because "just in case"
isn't worth waking up at 5:30 am to go clubbing.  ;)

Where Have All the Divas Gone?

Sat Apr 24, 5:35 PM ET

By Michael Paoletta
NEW YORK (Billboard) - It's 2004. Do you know where today's crossover dance 
divas are?

Since the mid-'90s, female dance artists -- not to be confused with female 
"electronic" artists or those featured on a track -- have experienced 
difficulty in crossing over their rhythmic sounds from dancefloors to the 
more lucrative mainstream.

"The welfare of the people in particular has always been the alibi of 
tyrants, and it provides the further advantage of giving the servants of 
tyranny a good conscience."
-Albert Camus

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the 
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become 
visible."
-Jacques Attali in his seminal text "Noise"

"I loved the focus in the early days of Wicked on the pagan aspects of 
life. The natural cycles of the full moons, being out in nature, on the 
beach, free, alive, unbridled, wild and spontaneous. There is no club, 
party or other sound system that has ever achieved anything close to that..."
-Jeno, on the early days of Wicked and the Full Moon Raves

Hi All, 

Some of you may remember my posting of a few months
back reporting on the non-profit I'm trying to get
going. The Digital Music Education Foundation's goal
is to use DJing, electronic music produciton tools,
and other music software to teach math and science to
middle and high school students. I wanted to share
some very early feedback with you. 

I recently completed my first class entitled "DJ
Algebra" at a San Francisco public school and it went
over really well. DJ Algebra is a program that uses
beat matching (specifically the pitch adjustments on
the turtables) to teach techniques of solving simple
algebraic equations. The kids learn a little math, get
an idea of what DJing is, and get a brief chance to
try it out themselves. I bring a prepared presentation
and some simple worksheets for them to do. I'm
currently reworking the materials based on some great
feedback I got in the first class in order to make it
more accessible to a variety of students. 

I hope to bring the class to more kids in the fall but
my financial resources are extremely limited so it
looks like maybe I'll be able to afford to do this
once or twice next school year. I'm still looking for
some way to fund this venture and expand it to more
schools and other districts. Any suggestions are
welcome.  We are also in need of equipment, computers,
mixers, decks, etc. to enable a more in depth program
to be available to an intitial group kids next year. 
So if you have somethign you don't need anymore and
can afford to donate let me know.

I've also attached two pics for your viewing pleasure.


Peace, 

Peter

Subject: [sfraves] .: Dirtbox Radio Tonight (4/25) : Live DNB : Ricky Ricardo, PiC +
 More :.


What's up y'all!

Tonight is the first night of a new year for Dirtbox Radio, and we're
happy to bring you some smashin tunes to set it off right.  Joining your
faithful hosts tonight will be Ricky Ricardo, with the possible showing of
Dirtbox Kru's Phil Scott and/or Mr. Joey Migraine of Jungletrain's
Renegade Bass.  It'll be a bangin show regardless, so tune the fuck in!

Ricky Ricardo dropped a dope garage set last week at the 2 year party, so
we got him back this week to give you a junglist injection.  A true
hardcore motherfucker, and representative of the Dirtbox Kru, I've yet to
hear this guy play anything but a retardedly good set.  He'll be playin
tonight from 8-10pm.

be up on the site on MONDAY night (ferreal this time!).  See you cats in
'bout an hour.  Tune in to the shows beforehand and give 'em some love!

PS - Biggup to Abe Froman and his lovely wife Valerie.  They're havin a
baby and are about a week overdue.  We'll get him back here after the fact
for a Baby Daddy set :)

Subject: [sfraves] Riding BAssWaves Saturday night =)

OK.. so like ya know, Basswaves was so Fuckin' Totally Mondo Dope Saturday night... I literally had a smile on my face nearly the whole time I was there lastnight... so trippy!!

OK.. so like my Favorite DJ of the night was oooh Gosh.. what was his name... Jeff Richmond!!  Good Shit man... I Loved it!!  He totally started out spinning this like House at 1st, ya know, but like progressively got kida faster & yummier during his set!  Then he mixed alota Acid Trance & Acid Techno like nearly all throughout the rest of his set & slipped in some Booty Vocal House in between parts and also some yummy Breakbeats here and there... Oh mY Goodness man.. Hello 2Day, that sert fuckin' Rocked!!! YAY!  I mean... musically I"m not tryin' 2 B like biased or whatever, but that set did fill me up!  I danced soooooooo hard!

BUt I mean... I Loved all the sets that I was there 4! So like me & Jaze went out 2 this party 2gether and as soon as we got in there, there was this OK.. I don't remember who was spinning in the front room when we got there 'cause I was like kinda overwhelmed w/ the site of like hella Family there chillin' under the parachute... LoL... & I kinda paid more attention 2 all of them instead of the music @ that point... LoL

Anywaze, went 2 the back room & Wow... Origami was spinning this Bad Ass House set w/ his bass guitar & fuck man... that was Sick as always!!!

Oh Oh Oh... OK... I remember now, the DJ in the front was spinning Break Beats!!! It was Dope!!I mean... the crowd in the party was like still kinda small during that point, so there was some room on the floor 2 Groove!!  Yeah, OK..I remember now 'cause while i was talkin' 2 Shane, I was like dancing @ the same time!  LoL

Jeff Richmond spun next in the front room & in the back... Sticky spun this Groovy like funky Hip Hop, Break Beaty set & @ 1 point, he was playing MJ's "Billie Jean" over this track & it was Sick!!  I was was totally diggin' it man!

After JR's set, Konkers went on... OK... so yeah, I was totally ready 2 hear like bangin' Break Beats comin' from his set, but Hello 2Day, he spun fuckin' Techno!!  Good Shit man.. I Loved it!!!  I Loved alota the songs he played 'cause alot of them had like these funky breakdowns in them... So Dope!  Oh Yeah... I was totally feelin' this set also on the floor!  OK... yeah... this had 2 B 1 of my other favorite sets 'cause well.. I was dancing to every set i was there for, but Konkers was Dope!

The party itself was Groovy!  It was totally Family filled, Oh Wow... so many Groovers showed up who I haven't seen in a hella long time, Awesome vibe throughout the venue, decorations were sorta minimal, but there were a few.  There was some discomfort I was feeling 'cause well, the chain(s) on my wallet fell off & 4 some reason, I thought i should put my wallet in my back left pocket.  So whenever I sat down, it felt so odd on my ass with my wallet on the wrong side!  But I did change it 2 the right back pocket, so all was Groovy w/ that situation =)  LoL

So like yeah, Jaze kinda had an early day on Sunday, but was very tempted 2 stay 'til Sun up.  BUt he didn't give in and made sure we left @ a decent time, no matter how hard it was.  I mean, I think we were both fulfilled with the amount of time we spent there & were hyper lil' Ravers on the way home! LoL

I just want 2 say Mondo Thanks 2 the Crew behind that Sat NIght Shindig!  LoL... I was a Mondo Happy Camper! =)

Take Care,
Peace =-> O§bY {8O)

Coming in April on Cobalt Radio: Unit 21 live.

Unit 21 Bio : 

Stanislav "Slam" Vdovin and Eugene Martynov began making music and writing 
songs at the tender age of 13. Slam's love of dance and electronic music grew 
from listening to late night radio programs over the past three years. Eugene 
has a deep interest in guitar music, and prides himself on focusing on the 
world's best guitarists. Slam and Eugene became close friends in 2002 and formed 
Unit 21 in Nizhny Novgorod, Russia in February 2003. 

With Slam on keyboards and electronic software and Eugene on guitar and bass, 
Unit 21's goal is to become well-known professionals in electronic music 
without a concrete style specialization. With diverse abilities and passion for

Anywho, have fun downloading:)

Hey all....

I used to live in that neighborhood (up on Winfield, St near the 
slide), and can vouch for it.  It IS a great place to live.  And you 
WILL get a good workout walking up and down that hill.

Parking's a bitch tho.  Don't "work out a compromise" on that garage 
spot.  Jump on it, and don't let go.


cya,
john

Just thought I'd let you know that Canada and Mexico are now no longer
options due to the "Smart Border Declaration" signed a few years back -
you're gonna need to go a lot further now.=20

Also, college will no longer provide a haven from being drafted - the
way the current bills are being written, you will be allowed to finish
the semester you are currently enrolled in and that's the only deferment
you will receive.

Bleh,

Subject: [sfraves] Friday night: D&B at AsiaSF (drunks and barefeet but pounding bass music)

------=_NextPart_000_0073_01C42BD1.DBF8EE60
Content-Type: text/plain;
	charset="iso-8859-1"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable

OK, I just had to post a message about my fun time on Friday night.

Originally, I had wanted to go to the element party (three fifteen), =
because Jack T. was spinning, but something happened when they were =
setting up (the 5-0 got 'em).

So instead I headed to AsiaSF really late (around midnight) for the SOMA =
Sessions (Drum 'n Bass Fourth Fridays), since I have never been to this =
party.

My first impression, after paying 12 bucks, was uh-oh, these aren't my =
kind of party people. It was a bunch of drunks upstairs in the =
restaurant, behind the bar area, acting nasty with each other (and no =
D&B to be heard). I could have sworn that I saw a flesh flash, like =
naked asses, or strip-tease scenarios, but the people standing around =
were blocking my view.

Actually, for a minute there I thought it was Michael the Red Stickman, =
cause I know he likes to "moon" occassionally.  But it wasn't him, just =
some male strippers (or drunk guys) and drunk girlies.

Then I heard the pounding bass and saw the stairs to the basement, which =
I bounded down, checked my long-sleeve SFLNC shirt, and got into the =
music for the rest of the night (until closing).

Just danced really hard, got sweaty, had a great time, although I didn't =
know anybody and no one spoke to me (the music was loud, after all).

The only annoyance was a very drunk Asian girl on the dance floor, who =
was dancing barefoot, a dangerous thing to do in a bar. I made sure to =
keep an eye on my feet and dance movements so as not to hurt her, but =
she kept getting closer (and following me on the floor somewhat).

Girls: Please don't do this--it's not wise to be in a close space where =
people are moving fast and you have no foot protection!
(duh--common sense, please).

I am surprised that the bouncer did not say anything to her. Anyways, it =
was still a great time, I just hope my pretty Asian girlfriend made it =
home OK (she was wasted).

Orbital to Disband After Next LP

Joshua Sharp reports:
In 15 years, techno mainstays Phil and Paul Hartnoll have covered a lot
of ground. All Melvilles aside, hailing Orbital to be the most
successful crossover group of the electronic persuasion would not be an
inordinate boast. With six full-length releases under their belt, as
well as an incalculable number of singles, soundtrack offerings, remixes
and collaborations, the boys are finally ready to end it all.

"I think we feel that Orbital has run its course," said Paul Hartnoll
via the official Orbital site. "We're both pursuing different avenues
with our music. And we've been sat, as brothers, in the same room for 15
years now-- and studios are always confined spaces-- I think it's time
for a change."

Before closing the curtain on their decade-and-a-half discography, the
duo is set to release their final record, entitled The Blue Album
(Weezer mash-up comment withheld for the sake of humanity) on June 21st.
Says Paul of the swan song's sound: "It's closer in character to our
first album than our later ones, if only because we made it in our own
time and for ourselves." Confirmed titles so far include "You Lot",
"Acid Pants", "Bath Time", "Easy Serve", and "One Perfect Sunrise", the
latter featuring Dead Can Dance vocalist Lisa Gerrard. The album will be
followed by two final British concerts, showcasing the duo's legendary
finesse. As follows:

06-25 London, England - Brixton Academy
06-27 Glastonbury, England - Glastonbury

--Apple-Mail-2--475243398
Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable
Content-Type: text/plain;
	charset=ISO-8859-1;
	format=flowed

	A friend of mine recently described how he believes the military =
draft=20
will be introduced. Elaborating on his basic idea, I've come up with=20
the following scenario:

	For starters, they won't call it a "draft." Instead it will be =
called=20
"national service" or something like that. And just so people don't get=20=

alarmed, it won't involve the military at all, or if it does only=20
civilian jobs in veterans hospitals and things like that. The program=20
will be sold as a way to give young people pride in their communities=20
by doing things like cleaning up local streets, helping conduct the=20
census, or doing environmental protection work on government land --=20
you know, the stuff we supposedly pay taxes for. (This additional=20
low-pay grunt labor will allow politicians to take money they would=20
have spent on these services and give it back to the taxpayers? Ha ha,=20=

that's a good one. No, they'll spend it on other things that are more=20
popular with the special interests who write them checks.)

	The "national service" program probably won't be mandatory at =
first.=20
You'll only be required to participate if you *want* certain things,=20
like a government loan for college. Perhaps universities and school=20
districts will find that some of their government funding is made=20
conditional upon a certain percentage of their students signing up for=20=

the program -- this will give school personnel an incentive to get=20
students to sign up.

	Participation may also be used as an alternative to things you =
*don't*=20
want. Imagine being told, "Here are your options -- you can either pay=20=

all these traffic tickets now (sorry, cash or credit card only!), lose=20=

your driver's license permanently, or sign up for national service."=20
What would you do? Or, "You're probably facing several months behind=20
bars on this misdemeanor charge, but if you sign up for national=20
service you can avoid any jail time and they'll even remove the offense=20=

from your record."

	Once the initial program is in place and the public has relaxed =
about=20
it, it will slowly become mandatory for more and more people and the=20
requirements will become more and more onerous. That's exactly what=20
happened with Social Security. The Social Security Act was passed in=20
1935. In 1936, the federal government published an informational=20
pamphlet about it which stated:

=A0"And finally, beginning in 1949, 12 years from now, you and your=20
employer will each pay 3 cents on each dollar you earn, up to $3,000 a=20=

year. That is the most you will ever pay."

	Of course it was a lie. According to a site with a whole lot of=20=

revealing info about Social Security=20
(http://www.justfacts.com/socialsecurity.htm), the maximum=20
inflation-adjusted SS tax per person in the year 2000 was more than 5=20
times that amount. For workers with average incomes, the government now=20=

collects the equivalent of 6 weeks worth of their salary in Social=20
Security taxes every year.

	When it got started, Social Security was also optional for most=20=

Americans. But over time, more and more people were forced into it. A=20
1999 Reason magazine article=20
(http://reason.com/9908/fe.rm.forced.shtml) describes how this happened:

"When the Roosevelt administration dreamed up Social Security in 1935,=20=

the stated goal was to guarantee that industrial workers would have=20
secure pensions. With the Great Depression threatening the life of so=20
many enterprises, it seemed like a good idea to provide these workers=20
with an independent, guaranteed retirement plan. Public employees were=20=

specifically excluded because Congress recognized that they were=20
already safe from the swing of private sector fortunes.

"Then President Roosevelt made a promise that revealed his=20
administration's redistributionist aims. FDR allowed workers who=20
retired after 1936--no matter how little they paid in--to collect full=20=

benefits immediately. That meant that the system had to expand to cover=20=

the costs of these unfunded liabilities. Small-business owners,=20
farmers, doctors, and others who traditionally funded their own=20
retirements were gradually forced into the system. Today, more than 148=20=

million workers pay into a system that was just supposed to protect the=20=

working poor from poverty in old age.

"After most private sector workers were absorbed, the federal=20
government targeted other government workers--even though their=20
retirements were secure. In 1954 Congress amended the Social Security=20
Act to let states and municipalities voluntarily cover their public=20
employees under Social Security. Some opted in, others stayed outside=20
the system. This voluntary agreement was revoked in 1983, when Congress=20=

made it illegal for states and municipalities to continue to set up=20
alternative retirement plans for their employees; only pension plans=20
pre-dating the 1983 amendments were allowed to enroll new employees.

"At the same time, all new federal employees were forced into Social=20
Security. (Congress maintained that the 1983 amendments would ensure=20
Social Security's solvency for at least another 75 years; a mere 16=20
years later, Social Security is again facing bankruptcy.) In 1990, the=20=

Social Security Act was amended again to force any public employee not=20=

already enrolled in an exempt plan into the system. Clinton proposes to=20=

close this last loophole, forcing the last handful of exempt workers=20
into the Social Security system."

	Anyway, getting back to the draft. As the "national service" =
program=20
grows, it will be "improved" by offering participants more options --=20
including the option of serving regular military duty. Of course they=20
won't make a big deal about this. Just one of the minor adjustments=20
that bureaucrats are always making in government programs. But=20
gradually, more participants will be steered toward this option by=20
making the alternatives less attractive. Those choosing enlistment will=20=

get better pay and shorter service requirements. Eventually national=20
service will be opened to everyone, not just those wanting government=20
money or having trouble with the law. Not to worry, it will be easy to=20=

get an exemption, at least at first. Having a regular job, having kids,=20=

being in school, writing a "hardship" letter, etc., will all get you=20
out of national service. As well as lots of more narrowly tailored=20
exemptions designed to win the support of various interest groups for=20
the program. But over time, these exemptions will start to be called=20
"loopholes," and Congress will go about "tightening" them. Just like=20
they do with taxes.

	Sometime around this point, most people will start to realize =
the=20
country has a full-on military draft. Of course if they'd been asked=20
whether they wanted a draft, they would've said "Hell no!" But it=20
happened so slowly. None of the changes were alarming. They all seemed=20=

to make sense at the time. And by now National Service is an=20
established program. All kinds of groups have strong financial and=20
emotional investments in it. Kind of late to blow the whistle, isn't it?

Peace, love & liberty,

When I read this on their site last week I was emotionally disturbed to say the least. I've been listening to this band for about 10 years now and it's dishearthening, but I feel that they did run their course and I'm eager to hear the brothers go at it with their solo sound.

Orbital to Disband After Next LP

Joshua Sharp reports:
In 15 years, techno mainstays Phil and Paul Hartnoll have covered a lot
of ground. All Melvilles aside, hailing Orbital to be the most
successful crossover group of the electronic persuasion would not be an
inordinate boast. With six full-length releases under their belt, as
well as an incalculable number of singles, soundtrack offerings, remixes
and collaborations, the boys are finally ready to end it all.

"I think we feel that Orbital has run its course," said Paul Hartnoll
via the official Orbital site. "We're both pursuing different avenues
with our music. And we've been sat, as brothers, in the same room for 15
years now-- and studios are always confined spaces-- I think it's time
for a change."

Before closing the curtain on their decade-and-a-half discography, the
duo is set to release their final record, entitled The Blue Album
(Weezer mash-up comment withheld for the sake of humanity) on June 21st.
Says Paul of the swan song's sound: "It's closer in character to our
first album than our later ones, if only because we made it in our own
time and for ourselves." Confirmed titles so far include "You Lot",
"Acid Pants", "Bath Time", "Easy Serve", and "One Perfect Sunrise", the
latter featuring Dead Can Dance vocalist Lisa Gerrard. The album will be
followed by two final British concerts, showcasing the duo's legendary
finesse. As follows:

06-25 London, England - Brixton Academy
06-27 Glastonbury, England - Glastonbury

It really doesn't sound that bad, the way you write it.  France has a 
national service that's mandatory.

thanks O§by, I think ;)

..Yes I too was beaming to hear my name on the radio, pretty cool thing.
Even cooler to hear something you spun being played. Anyway not to toot me
own horn too hard, it wasn't the set I would have chosen for this area, but
based on the cat who was on before me, I guess it fit...dj Scot Quick I
think?!?. Overall I haven't received any death threats, so I guess all is in
order. For anyone who is interested the set was entitled "Weltherrschaft"
and is available now for download at www.jacktriumph.com

Thanks again for your support; hopefully more to follow.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] (NRR) GOP Senator joins Democrats in calling for military draft



It all smells of slave labor to me.  We are going to give the rich massive
tax cuts... Oh, and to pay for it, we are going to ask young people to work
for free.

Why not ask the wealthy of this nation to chip in their fair share, that
way we can actually *pay* young people to do this work, and maybe even
set them off on a real career in civil service.

Otherwise, if we can't afford to go to war, we shouldn't.

I think it's BS too. You're basicly on point with what you're saying.

But many other countries have the same thing. Hedo Turkuglo of the San 
Antonio Spurs has to go back to Turkey this Summer to complete his 6 month 
civil service (millitary) required of all young men by a certian age. And 
this guy is a millionaire in America that anyone can see on TV on a daily 
basis. He's still doing it.

To be honest, a 6 month type of thing doesn't seem all that bad. Anything 
longer is where people might start to have real problems with it. I know I 
would...

Subject: Re: [sfraves] (NRR) GOP Senator joins Democrats in calling for 
     military draft

here's the thing with the other countries that have mandatory service.
they have socialized medicine and many other social programs that this
country does not have in return for service.

i would never go to war in some other country.  if someone invaded the
U.S. then maybe, but to goto another country and fight is like me going on
to someone else's property and imposing my agenda.

it's always wrong.  i won't be fooled by fear and propaganda.

It all smells of slave labor to me.  We are going to give the rich =
massive
tax cuts... Oh, and to pay for it, we are going to ask young people to =
work
for free.

Why not ask the wealthy of this nation to chip in their fair share, that
way we can actually *pay* young people to do this work, and maybe even
set them off on a real career in civil service.

Otherwise, if we can't afford to go to war, we shouldn't.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] (NRR) GOP Senator joins Democrats in calling for
military draft


here's the thing with the other countries that have mandatory service.
they have socialized medicine and many other social programs that this
country does not have in return for service.

i would never go to war in some other country.  if someone invaded the
U.S. then maybe, but to goto another country and fight is like me going =
on
to someone else's property and imposing my agenda.

it's always wrong.  i won't be fooled by fear and propaganda.

"fair share" is all relative.  Personally, I would rather see fewer people
suffering in the world, instead of being able to afford that new Porche or
Hummer.... or a 3rd vacation home in Aspen.

But, that is all for the voters to decide.  If the struggling families
of America want to keep voting (not not voting) to give people like me 
even more disposable income, well, I guess thats just the way Democracy
works.  Its pretty funny how they get suckered.  I guess they deserve it.

coming prepared to showcase a very special set exclusive to us here in San 
Francisco, which is sure to absolutely blow you away. If you've seen LUNA-C

|| CLOUDSKIPPER vs. THE NICE GUYS
[Raw Elements/Kniteforce/Liquidvinyldjs.com vs. Liquidvinyldjs.com/K-12] - 
3X6 INSANITY SET!
In what is sure to be one of the more talked about sets this year, 
Cloudskipper faces off against The Nice Guys. Relatively little is known 
about The Nice Guys, except, well, they're nice. In any case, be prepared 
for in your face up front hardcore, a lot of unreleased music, as well as 
onstage antics that can only be described as pure madness!

|| DJ TRONIC
[Resistance Recordings/Liquidvinyldjs.com/CHR]
In preparation for his anticipated European tour, Tronic's set is going to 
be chalked full of brand new hard hittin material! This will be his last 
local appearance before he heads off to Europe for 2 weeks, so be ready for 
the Hard Beats!

|| MAJERE

In a rare appearance playing trancecore/freeform, Majere is taking a bit of 
a step back into his roots. Expect a set of fast and hard mind melting 
music, which can only be appreciated by those ready to move!

|| THE DOCTOR & MC FADER
[Liquidvinyldjs.com/Bayraves.com || Gravitycrew.com/Emceeds]
Quite possibly one of the best DnB/Jungle DJ's in Northern California, The 
Doctor has become a household name. You can catch him almost every weekend 
droppin those hard hittin tracks all over! In tow is the MC called Fader, in 
which really needs no introduction. These two go together like steak and 
eggs, like butter on toast, like.. well you get the idea!

|| DJ J-MARR
[Liquidvinyldjs.com/Bayraves.com] - FAREWELL SET!
The man, the myth, the legend. Need we say more? Known from up and down the 
West Coast for not only his music, but also his energetic charisma, J-Marr 
is a legend in the scene. This will be his last set behind the decks, ending 
a tenure other DJ's can only dream about. Be there to witness J-Marr rocking 
in his usual manner, for the last time!

|| CARLOS ALFONZO vs. RECLIPSE
[Resistance Recordings/Soop Recordings vs. D&A Music/Bayraves]
The battle of the BBQ Iron Chef Carlos and the Maddest Mad DJ around, this 
will be a treat to all those who appreciated hard techno... and we do mean 
HARD. These two will come out swingin' with pure dancefloor driven 
material.. get ready to rock!

|| LEON COOK vs. PETER GO-ZANIA!
[Hardscience/Logik Pro Audio]
These two have been rapidly rising among the Hardcore faithful here in the 
Bay, and with their crowd rockin performances and talent behind the decks, 
it's really no wonder why. Expect a set full of freeform and upfront 
Hardcore material only these guys bring to the table.

|| DJ DMS
[Oakland Bounce/Dream Crew]

It's anyone's guess what a "fair share" would constitute. I tend to
think that as long as there are children starving, millions without
health care, and an entire class of working poor in this country that
NOBODY is paying their fair share.

People want affordable health care and safer streets, decent radio
stations and support for the arts, but they're unwilling to pay the
price. Public services cost money, and as long as we remain greedy and
selfish, nobody will benefit from even the slightest distribution of
wealth in the world's richest nation.

concept, but horrible in practice, here's why:

capitalism:

freedom
emphasis on personal acheivement
rewards innovation
Man WAS NOT created equal, but shall be given equal oppurtunity
survival of the fitest
Man is inherrently selfish and greedy, why deny it.
No hope for the weak or disabled
realist perspective

Communism/Marxism(socialism):

conformity
one for the good of the community
weakest link is a broken leg for the whole community
desirable for countries ruined by war that need hope
why strive to be the best if there is no reward
Loss of individualism and self expression
Idealist perspective

Here's a link to why communism will never work: =

It's anyone's guess what a "fair share" would constitute. I tend to
think that as long as there are children starving, millions without
health care, and an entire class of working poor in this country that
NOBODY is paying their fair share.

People want affordable health care and safer streets, decent radio
stations and support for the arts, but they're unwilling to pay the
price. Public services cost money, and as long as we remain greedy and
selfish, nobody will benefit from even the slightest distribution of
wealth in the world's richest nation.

That's not quite correct-

Maybe on paper... but does average Joe taxpayer know how to incorporate 
themselves in order to depreciate personal property used for business 
purposes?

That's just one example, but there are a myriad of huge tax-saving 
strategies that are basically out of reach to those that cannot afford 
the accountants and attorneys required to implement them.

We have a democratic republic with hideous entities like the electoral

2) the 2000 election

it's not fair to assume that every person that falls into the "rich"

WTF?

all communists are socialist
not all socialists are communists

re: shawn

the problem isn't that we're not willing to pay, the problem is we're 
paying already, and the services aren't being delivered.  think how much 
better other programs would be if we stopped the losing war on drugs?

If they're smart they do :)

And they're not "loopholes" so to say- it's more that business/personal 
tax law is so incredibly complex that it's *way* beyond the grasp of 
anyone not studying it as their profession.

The legal and accountant costs are the same regardless of the dollar 
values involved-
A pizza delivery boy isn't going to spend 10k on consultants for the end 
result of cutting his taxable income by 30%, but for an exec making 100k 
per year, it makes sense...

I love a lot about the US.  Less and less all the time it seems.  San
Francisco is probably about the only place in the US I'd care to live in
these current times.  There ARE many other places where the quality of
life is just as good as that here, so I'm not with you in the "I
wouldn't live anywhere else" realm.

Was it Jefferson who said something along the lines of it being a man's
DUTY to protest??  That's one of my favorite political quotes.

Actually, the United States in the 1950s had a very small gap between the
rich and poor.  CEOs might have made 5x more than the average worker, not
500x.  The "rich" drove Cadillacs, and the "poor" drove Fords.  That was
just about the extent of the income gap. 

I would like to see a return to those days in America.  Seems like the
right-wing is always talking about going back to the "good 'ol days of
America"... I hardly think any of them would call America in the 1950s
communist.

THIS is really the root of most all of the "evils" in the US, IMHO.
Track the expansion of the income gap vs. the rate of crime, as well as
the overall quality of life and I'll bet you find some enlightenment.

I believe that the changes in the tax code (tax cuts) have severely
affected this in a negative way (facilitated the increase in the gap.)
This is where change needs to happen first if there's a desire to reduce
the gap.

Subject: [sfraves] Interesting experience

Something to get off the subject of politics, especially since I suck at =
debating:

"This was back in 2000, i remeber the experience vividly, i wanted to =
talk about it so here it goes.

I have never seen a DJ do this so I don't know if it was a DJ in the =
general sense.=20
I had never been in such a place before, met a girl on line and took the =
bus SF to meet her and hang out for the weekend.

Her boyfriend took me out around town at 2 am that night walkd about 5 =
blocks from 3rd and Bryant. Where she was living. Came to this shady =
club with people standing outside, lots of weed inside and people =
crowded togtether talking and smoking. He introduced me to people and i =
got a hug instead of a hand-shake from girls and guys ( hey man how are =
you doing where are you from? etc)

The place ( I dont remeber the name of it except that it had green sign =
and looked kind of like a hole in the wall joint but inside it was =
different) had 3 rooms One main one with a bar accross from it. The bar =
was packed no free stools. DJ was up on a pretty high deck mixing some =
loud jungle. Started to look pretty dead on the main floor so the =
bouncer at the door yells Yo' FUCK IT UP!" so the guy brings in some =
other crazy jungle track about twice as eratic as the first. (Turns up =
the volume a bit to).

The other room had another jungle dj and so we hung around I was =
introduced to people all most of whom work for yahoo and other tech =
companies, a lot look like they just got off the bus from work and had =
been danceing with their bags/backpacks with them. Obviously to unwind.

It was like THE place they came to unwind. One girl letting loose on the =
floor looked like she was a totally different person before she walked =
into that place.

Later on that night we walked into the way back room and saw everyone =
standing around this guy setting up sound equipment on a table. People =
were standing around watching intently and the club staff looked at this =
guy like hes gonna turn the place upside down and they were standing =
back looking at him like he was in control now.

It was this guy with 2 laptops on a table along with a dat and a bunch =
of other sound modules and tone generators of some kind. He didn't play =
anyting anyone could dance to. - he would start with a sound - from some =
kind of sound box, turn the knobs and make it build and buld - then some =
flange sounds nad vibrating swishes and stuf very loud and mixed it with =
other sounds. - everyone was just crowded around the table watching this =
guy do this - i had never seen anything like that before - would you =
call that djing? or what do you call it?=20

It was amaizing - I think it was more to cater to those who were drugged =
up - I wasn't nor did I drink at all and I was really curious about it =
all. What does anyone give as a take on this experience

If anyone else knows what this is called or categorized as please share =
it. I mean where I've been to places in general - no one woudl take =
interest in a guy on a table with a bunch of gadgets just creating =
sounds like that.=20

I felt like this is someting I'd love to do if a crowd loved it.
Some how I feel like it really was an event to be tripping off of while =
on the weed. I bet I got some kind of contact high being in there either =
way. "

THIS is really the root of most all of the "evils" in the US, IMHO.
Track the expansion of the income gap vs. the rate of crime, as well as
the overall quality of life and I'll bet you find some enlightenment.

I believe that the changes in the tax code (tax cuts) have severely
affected this in a negative way (facilitated the increase in the gap.)
This is where change needs to happen first if there's a desire to reduce
the gap.

Want details???  Plug the data from this page into excel:
http://www.census.gov/hhes/income/histinc/f03.html
or use this one for a wider range of data:
http://www.census.gov/hhes/income/histinc/f01.html

A study of the results of the 80's and 90's is here:
http://www.cbpp.org/5-31-01tax.htm
It's the after tax results that are important in this discussion.  (A
graph that shows this, for 1979-1997, is here:
http://www.cbpp.org/5-31-01tax-pr-f1.jpg)

As an aside, this often times seems to boil down to an "us" vs. "them"
argument.  Well, there's a tribe for us "others":

Subject: RE: [sfraves] (NRR) "fair share" of taxes



just a couple of quick points and i'll go back to
lurking --

to use an over-simplified model, there are two factors
that make a nation work - politics and economics.  in
the US, politically we're federalized dmocratic and
economically capitalist.  they are tied together in
the nation's operations, but are in fact mutually
exclusive.

communism and socialism, likewise, have been seen
together in political/economic setups, but much like
capitalism and democracy, are mutually exclusive.  

most of all, communism and socialism are by far and
away not the same thing -- your first clue on this is
that there are different words for them.  

as UC alumni, it's distressing to hear that Cal's
poly-sci department presents them as the same.  i'd
expect that kind of academic laziness at a high school
level, but not at the flagship campus of the UC.  ah
well.  next time i'm up at Cal i'll have a talk with
Dr. Chhibber about that.

finally, we here in the US enjoy *a lot* of socialist
products and services.  these include things like
highways, sanitation/sewer systems, utility
infrastructure and so on.  

the position that the US completely rejects socialism
and that socialism cannot work at all, no matter what,
is flawed at best.  and again, it's a point that i'd
hope the poli-sci department at Cal wouldn't be
promoting to it's students.  not because i think Cal
should be promoting some ultra-liberal-USA-hating
philosophy, but because the argument is fallacious and
can be debated off immediately.

okay, back to lurk mode.  if anyone wants to hear some
breaks tracks at their parties and wants to fly me up
from SoCal, drop me a note and i'll get a demo CD out
to you.  of course, i'll have to charge you for the
gig -- if i did it for free, i wouldn't be a
capitalist, now would i?

I never thought I would support a return to the draft, but recent events 
have made me rethink this position.  This generation's relationship to the 
brutal realities of war is pretty abstract:  video games;  censored 
news;  and some jackass in borrowed flight gear who had never seen battle 
himself shouting "bring it on."

Folks who have actually been in battle are very reluctant to support 
grandiose worldwide military interventions.  They understand the actual 
costs of war.  It's quite easy right now to sit in one's armchair, wave a 
flag, and let others do the dirty work in Iraq and elsewhere.  When you are 
about to be placed in harm's way, however, a certain clarification of 
thought occurs.

This happened during the Vietnam war.  Many had to ask the 
question:  "...is it worth my life to support some abstract domino theory 
of politics?"  Good to be forced to ask such questions, I think.

Further, unless you had some rich daddy who would buy you an aircraft and 
flight suit in the National Guard, people from various backgrounds, 
ethnicities, and social strata were forced to work and live together.  Now 
it seems we have increasing stratification of society and concomitant 
tension and lack of empathy with those who are different from those with 
whom you associate.

I don't wish the draft on anyone, however.  What I would prefer to see is 
"mandatory" public service:  say, two years of military or other service to 
the country.   "Mandatory" in that after completion of this service you 
would "vest" in certain rights and privileges accorded to full citizens, 
like voting, reasonable access to health care, ability to hold elected 
office; priority in hiring, and other valuable benefits like the ability to 
serve on a board of directors.  Thus, one could "choose" to give to the 
country or not.  The selfish would pay.

Love,

Apollo

tyrants, and it provides the further advantage of giving the servants of 
tyranny a good conscience."

"I loved the focus in the early days of Wicked on the pagan aspects of

just a couple of quick points and i'll go back to
lurking --

to use an over-simplified model, there are two factors
that make a nation work - politics and economics.  in
the US, politically we're federalized dmocratic and
economically capitalist.  they are tied together in
the nation's operations, but are in fact mutually
exclusive.

communism and socialism, likewise, have been seen
together in political/economic setups, but much like
capitalism and democracy, are mutually exclusive. =20

most of all, communism and socialism are by far and
away not the same thing -- your first clue on this is
that there are different words for them. =20

as UC alumni, it's distressing to hear that Cal's
poly-sci department presents them as the same.  i'd
expect that kind of academic laziness at a high school
level, but not at the flagship campus of the UC.  ah
well.  next time i'm up at Cal i'll have a talk with
Dr. Chhibber about that.

finally, we here in the US enjoy *a lot* of socialist
products and services.  these include things like
highways, sanitation/sewer systems, utility
infrastructure and so on. =20

the position that the US completely rejects socialism
and that socialism cannot work at all, no matter what,
is flawed at best.  and again, it's a point that i'd
hope the poli-sci department at Cal wouldn't be
promoting to it's students.  not because i think Cal
should be promoting some ultra-liberal-USA-hating
philosophy, but because the argument is fallacious and
can be debated off immediately.

okay, back to lurk mode.  if anyone wants to hear some
breaks tracks at their parties and wants to fly me up
from SoCal, drop me a note and i'll get a demo CD out
to you.  of course, i'll have to charge you for the
gig -- if i did it for free, i wouldn't be a
capitalist, now would i?

Using the words communism, Marxism, and socialism was your first mistake.
Your second was pulling your ideological defense from a 1940's US propaganda

Some interesting words from someone who'd I'd call a conspiracy
theorist:

You can't fight city hall.
Death and taxes.
Don't talk about politics or religion.
This is all the equivalent of enemy propaganda rolling across the picket
line. Lay down GI... Lay down GI...
We saw it all through the 20th century. And now with the 21st century
its time to stand up and realize that we should not allow ourselves to
be crammed into this rat maze.
We should not submit to dehumanization.
I don't know about you but I'm concerned with what's happening in this
world. I'm concerned with the structure. I'm concerned with the systems
of control. Those that control my life and those that seek to control it
EVEN MORE!

I want freedom!
That's what I want!
And that's what you should want!
Its up to each and every one of us to turn loose of just some of the
greed, the hatred, the envy, and yes the insecurities. Because that is
the central mode of control - to make us feel pathetic, small - so we'll
give up our sovereignty, our liberty, our destiny.

We have got to realize that we are being conditioned on a mass scale.
Start challenging this corporate slave state.
The 21st century's gonna be a new century. Not the century of slavery,
not the century of lies and issues of no significance, and classism, and
statism, and all of the rest of the modes of control.
Its gonna be the age of human kind standing up for something good, for
something pure and something right.

What a bunch of garbage - liberal, democrat, conservative, republican.
Its all there to control you.
Two sides of the same coin.
Two management teams bidding for control of the CEO job of Slavery
Incorporated. The truth is out there in front of you but they lay out
this buffet of lies.

I'm sick of it!
And I'm not gonna take a bite out of it!
Do ya got me?!?!!

Resistance is not futile.
We're gonna win this thing.
Human kind is too good.
We're not a bunch of underachievers.
We're gonna stand up and we're gonna be human beings.
We're gonna get fired up about the real things !
The things that matter !
Creativity and the dynamic human spirit that refuses to submit!
Well, that's it. That's all I got to say.


The conspiracy theorist I speak of??  Alex Jones.

If by socialism you mean a system that uses our vast collective wealth
to benefit people without the means to help themselves, then yes.

> It's lovely in concept, but horrible in practice,

Horrible in practice? Canada and western European nations have been
doing quite well with socialist policies for a while now. *No*
implementation is perfect, but I (and, I imagine, many people with
limited means) would much prefer some socialist policies in key areas
(healthcare, for one) to our all-or-nothing capitalist caste system.

Some of this stuff below is just ridiculous...

> capitalism:

> freedom

> Man WAS NOT created equal, but shall be given equal oppurtunity

"Equal opportunity"? LOL.

> survival of the fitest

You're confusing evolution with capitalism here. Do you really think
that (for instance) people who were born into poor families are
inherently weak, and therefore undeserving of life? That somehow the
wealthy are an evolved species of human more fit for survival? The poor
aren't poor because they were born uneducated or disabled. It's the lack
of equal opportunity [see above] (in education, in the workplace, and in
society as a whole) that keeps them where they are.

> Man is inherrently selfish and greedy, why deny it.

I don't believe that at all. You may be selfish and greedy. Americans,
for the most part, may be selfish and greedy. But people in the rest of
the world really aren't. Humanism and captitalism aren't mutually
exclusive.

> No hope for the weak or disabled
> realist perspective

Realist? There's nothing inherently "realistic" about capitalism. In
fact, it's more realistic to say that capitalism simply isn't the
be-all, end-all of economics. A self-proclaimed "realist" might say that
some socialist policies could potentially *compliment* a capitalist
society.

> Idealist perspective

You're thinking of communism specifically. Socialism isn't an
all-or-nothing deal, it's just a term used to describe any system
whereby a good or service is owned and distributed collectively. In
Marxist-Leninist theory, socialism was a stepping stone from capitalism
to communism... Nowadays though, socialized services tend to work
hand-in-hand with capitalist economies. And FWIW, Canadians haven't
exactly had to sacrifice their individualism or self-expression for
public healthcare.

She couldn't have been that great if her students are still using the
terms "communism" and "socialism" interchangably. Or weren't you paying
attention?

Troy,

	You don't mean voting to *give* people like you more disposable income 
-- you mean not voting to *take* as much of the disposable income you 
have. It's funny how we forget that the money belongs to the person who 
earns it in the first place.

	Of course if you *don't* think you earned your money, or believe that 
it more properly belongs to someone else, you're free to give more of 
it away. But please, let's not pass any more laws confiscating more 
money from *other* people based on *your* sense of guilt.

	I'm all for reducing suffering in the world. And by that I mean the 
*world*, not just American families. Most American families have it 
relatively good compared to people in places like India and Sudan. But 
whether rich or poor, people suffer when they are *compelled* by force 
to do things they don't want to do. Instead of encouraging more 
government aggression, why not look for ways to end poverty *without* 
the use of force?

Ok fine! I suck at debating, never was good at it.

I am just sick of paying tons of taxes for people that don't work hard =

how mature ... yes! 

well hey, I just thought it was pretty simplistic. 

I graduated from UC Berkeley and also took poly sci. I certainly did not 
reach the same conclusions as this very sensitive poster. 

Anyhow, this is all way too antagonistic. I think Jack Triumph is right ... 
what about the music?

Excellent post, Shawn.  One might add that equating democracy and freedom 
with capitalism is another fallacy.  It is quite possible to have "freedom" 
and democracy in a socialist system.  Many seem to equate "freedom" with 
the ability to practice unfettered consumerism in a world with limited 
resources.  Freedom of thought and expression is, to me, far more important 
than the ability to buy fifty different kinds of underwear with the salary 
I earn working as a serf in some hierarchical corporation where most of 
one's life is spent in an environment that is antithetical to democracy and 
freedom.

Love,

Apollo

Excellent post, Shawn.  One might add that equating democracy and =
freedom=20
with capitalism is another fallacy.  It is quite possible to have =
"freedom"=20
and democracy in a socialist system.  Many seem to equate "freedom" with =

than the ability to buy fifty different kinds of underwear with the =

I earn working as a serf in some hierarchical corporation where most of=20
one's life is spent in an environment that is antithetical to democracy =
and=20
freedom.

Yes, as do I.  When the place opened there was some "dress code" I 
heard.  Athletic shoes, t-shirts, and jeans were prohibited.  One thing I 
will not do is dance in leather dress shoes -- boots are OK:)  But now I 
believe there is no dress code.  Correct?

Love,

Apollo

"The welfare of the people in particular has always been the alibi of 
tyrants, and it provides the further advantage of giving the servants of 
tyranny a good conscience."
-Albert Camus

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the 
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become 
visible."
-Jacques Attali in his seminal text "Noise"

"I loved the focus in the early days of Wicked on the pagan aspects of 
life. The natural cycles of the full moons, being out in nature, on the 
beach, free, alive, unbridled, wild and spontaneous. There is no club, 
party or other sound system that has ever achieved anything close to that..."

Wow that sucks. The place is off the hook. NOTHING like 1015. Nothing at 
all.

If someone you like comes to Ruby Skye, check it out... It's worth one try. 
Not to say I've partied all over the world or anything but have in SF, LA, & 
New York... Ruby Skye is the best experience by far. Although I've only gone 
on nights that I wanted to hear someone play. Thats probably because I'm 
living in Sacramento now. If I was back on the peninsula again, it would 
probably be a regualr stop for me. Even on nights that the music was 
probably not going to be my thing.

Plus it's pretty easy to get on the guest list through thier web site. And 
once you do, GO that night, they'll keep sending you free list spots on a 
regular basis if you continue to go on the nights they offer to comp your 
cover.

AUDi,
Gavin

Subject: RE: [sfraves] RR: LTJ Bukem @ Ruby Skye?

i went last year to see BT.  i don't think i'll ever go back to Ruby Skye 
unless there was someone i really, really want to see.

the vibe is very much into the "look at me, i'm stylin', let's get drunk and 
dry hump on the dancefloor."  the place is nice...but to me it's nice in a 
cheesy way.  no doubt, they put a lot of money into it and they get great 
talent.

it's just not my bag.  in my opinion, i'd rather go to 1015.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] RR: LTJ Bukem @ Ruby Skye?

I like"d" Ruby Skye. As fate would have it, I used to live with a bartender
who worked at Ruby Skye...so when I turned 21, truth be told, Ruby Skye was
my first "club" experience. It is an extremely nice place. Very well thought
out in terms of the interiors. But geez this was like back in 2000/01, and I
certainly wasn't paying the $20 cover.

Now there are certainly some that say RS isn't underground enough, well no
shit. It is a "put on your nice shoes, pants, smelly cologne" and have your
lady get all dolled up. It's a socialite club. Most people are there to be
"seen". Residents usually pump out the funky/deep SF house and they get some
decent names in there. In fact, I heard that Chub & Ceballos showed up one
night, which is a huge thing. However, I can't say I have been there in
almost 2.5 years, so who knows...maybe it's shite.

The one thing I will say, and this may be jaded because I was always guest
list, but the security was always cool to me and the people I was with.

I dunno about a pick up environment. Maybe because I only go on nights where 
like-minded party people make an effort to be there... Yes, there's always 
plenty of well dressed people. But it's not out of control. My experience 
has ALWAYS been, these well-dressed people are down as fcuk! I always hear 
how it's a bunch of stuck up, coke head girls trying to get the biggest 
baller to take them home. Thats never been the thing on nights when I've 
gone. It's always been just a whole lot of people there to party and party 
they do. Nothing like any "rave" I've been to in a number of years. I can't 
remember the last time there was a vibe at a rave like the last few times 
I've been to Ruby Skye. I'd even say it's more like a rave USED to be. Way 
back when. Not exactly, but more like it that any rave you'll see today in 
the Bay.

As far as 1015 being a drinking environment???

HAHAHAHAHAHA!!! yes, it might have a liquor licene, but the main room there 
is like a medium-sized warehouse party with the same amount of illicit 
drugs, better lights, and better sound (as well as talent). Somehow they've 
managed to kill the vibe it once had though. Save for certian nights.

Gavin

Subject: RE: [sfraves] ATP: BSP: Sick of "Reality SFR"

last week when i dropped off some flyers at Beaucoup Beats in San Mateo 
(formerly Remix Records) i spent some time crate digging and found a copy of 
Apache Breakdown and Ecstacy Recall/Escape from Brooklyn for a buck each.  i 
was pretty happy about that.

and then at amoeba i did more crate digging in the used section and found a 
copy of Skybox "The Breaks" (a backup copy for myself) for $1.99.

i like finding records for cheap.  mostly because i'm unemployed and still 
have to feed my vinyl habit.

I don't think there is much of a dress code right now. If anything, it's a 
code made by the club's patrons. But it's all good. The other Saturday I was 
probably the most under-dressed male in the club. Had on a T-shirt. It was a 
nice T-shirt, brand new "insert label-whore brand here____" T-shirt. But 
still a T-shirt. Some denim jeans I payed waaaayyyyy too much for. But still 
jeans. And some all white K-Swiss. Way below the bar.

They did not even care as I went in even though I was obviously underdressed 
by thier clubber's in attendance standard. Better than that, the people 
themselves did not care. I partied with more well-dressed ladies, and 
partied hard, than at any other place I've been. Partied harder than you see 
people partying at raves anymore too. People were just there to dance, so 
what if they wanted to look good at the same time?

The dress code is kind of self-imposed. But I pulled it (not following the 
code) off and did not feel one bit uncomfortable doing it.

AUDi,
Gavin

We have one of the lowest effective tax rates in the world as a
percentage of GDP... but we also have the highest GDP. So yes, on a
large scalle we pay quite a bit less in taxes than the rest of the
world. Why is everyone complaining then?

I wouldn't mind paying more taxes if I knew that they were being put to
good use (thanks for pointing that out, Sarilion). I also know that if I
were a multi-millionaire, I wouldn't mind paying a great deal more taxes
if I knew that it would make everyones' lives better. You're not just
paying taxes for "people that don't work hard or try their best". Your
tax dollars pay for the law enforcement, fire departments, roads,
education, and a wide variety of other services you probably can't
imagine living without. It's no wonder that most of these services are
poor when compared to those of other countries with higher effective tax
rates.

I think the Constitution and the Bill of Rights are wonderful. The
system itself isn't all that great though.

Subject: RE: [sfraves] (NRR) "fair share" of taxes

I'm totally lost here.  Who else are you paying taxes for?  Have you ever 
considered that some people that are wealthy are earning their money and 
paying taxes on it too?  Do you really think CEO's are rewarded routinely 
for not trying their best?  Sure, there are shiesty people out there (ie 
Enron), but they're bad apples in the bushel.

the two clubs that they own have always had a dress code.  Always, so it is 
nothing to be unexpected.  Try working there...it is a pretty fun gig.
While working for Backbeat in santa clara, I went in as a guest one night 
and they had to lend me a pair of dress shoes.  Don't take it personally at 
all.  They are really good people too.

I wouldn't go so far as to say that I hate it.  I've never actually =20

I choose not to go, though, because for a place that books all kind of =20=

the fact that it extends to your SHOES as well; which is even worse for =20=

a place that plays DANCE music.

I found all this out the hard way, back when I had my dotcom job, and a =20=

bunch of us decided to go to see $some_big_dj_or_another.  Hell, we =20
KNEW it was a "dress to impress" place, and even dressed fairly clubby =20=

and glossy.  But we were going there for the DJ, not to play the club =20=

game, to "see and be seen", or to "hook up".  So all but one of us got =20=

turned away at the door because we were not wearing =20
hard-ass-uncomfortable-can't-dance-for-shit-in-them-leather shoes.

I'm not totally unwilling to dress up on occasion.  But I wear =20
uncomfortable shoes for no one.

So I don't go to Ruby Skye.

i'm ever amazed how much people on this list like to
moan on and on about nothing!!!

i went to the show.  bukem played his usual well-mixed
set of tame liquidy d&b and conrad was exactly like
he's been for years.  enjoyable but exactly what i
expected.

there was no dress code, the club was nice, the sound
& lights were great, the crowd was having it and the
security was forgiving- they confiscated my flyers but
at least they didn't kick me out as 1015 did last time
bukem played.  the drinks were expensive but stiff as
a board.  all in all i had a good time!!!

Yeah- it's a totally different place on club nights versus special events.
No doubt its a really cool venue, and like others have said, the dress 
code and the crowd really make me ill on "normal" nights- but Blasthaus 
pulls in some good people for shows there- and when you've bought tix 
ahead of time for special events like that, there's no dress code and 
the crowd reflects the performer.

shame on you for actually responding to the this message thread with any 
kind of information that actually pertained to the original post!  shame on 
you!

now please, let us continue talking about the virtues of comfortable 
footwear and the oppressive dance clubs that keep us from them.

     I think there is some psychiatric double talk gonig on on this list, of 
the Sean Hannity type... Yes of course rich people pay more taxes, we know 
that, we're not stupid. It works on percentages. But the idea of finding ways to 
tax rich people more, and poor people less, is still a very valid idea. 
Because look, after all the tax's are over... what do you know? Rich people are 
still rich, and poor people are still poor. And although it is harsh for one 
person to have to technically pay "more" than another, it can never be as harsh as 
it is to actually be poor yourself. 
     Think if you were out with your friends and some emergency situation 
happened and you were all stranded somewhere and they each had $5 and you had 
$100. Who would bail everyone out and get a taxi? You would! would you even have 
to think twice about it? Now just try to think of a grander scale and replace 
your friends with the people of the United States... granted, you probably 
don't like everyone in the United States, especially all the poor people, 
especially if you're rich because perhaps they desereve it, perhaps they dug their 
own hole, perhaps they are lazy but... in most circumstances, rich people 
inherite their money, or their money-making-habits from family and/or just knowing 
the "right" people. Not everyone has the same luck. Consequently when taxes 
come around not everyone should have the same luck either.
     And just because my statement may relate to what some people think of as 
"socialism" doesn't make it wrong. It doesn't take implementation of 
"survival of the fittest" in order to encourage people to work hard. I have been known 
to compleately forget to clock in at work and forget to pick up my pay 
checks... while still working much harder than everyone else in my crew. I've been kn
own to go out of my way to help people who would never buy something, even 
when I'm on commision. There are lots of people out there like me who work for a 
sense of responsibility and honor amung the human race. There are people who 
just concentrate on the effeciancy of GETTING THINGS ACTUALLY DONE and 
progressing and evolving in the world. Rather than going through-out thier lives 
conjuring up how much money they can make, and invest and make more money. The 
idea of that seems fictional to me, and yet we all support that? How is it that 
we see capitalism as such a hero and socialism as such a leach? The truth is, 
it is the other way around.
     Now if I were to go to some American Indian reservation... and spend all 
my time picking all the fruit off their trees, then cutting their trees down 
and making stuff out of the wood, and working my butt off day in and day out, 
ravaging their land and putting it in my little storage bin, while they were 
all out being lazy playing Indian ball and what not, enjoying life... And then 
one day when they got hungry and needed things I said "HEY you all are lazy 
bastards that play Indian ball all day, I've been working my butt off reaping 
all of your resources and putting them in my little storrage bin! You all have 
to BUY them from me now!" What would I be? That's right I'd be a Capitalist. A 
Capitalist in not your real friend, but just someone who uses you for what 
you're worth untill you fall... and they'll be right there to pick you up, for 
the right price that is. They basically own you because after a certain gap is 
reached you'll never be able to compete with them. (now am I gonna get stoned 
for this or is there anyone sensible enough to agree??) - jaze

Content-Type: text/plain;

Hello to All on the List,
Today I had the old song by Qkumba Zoo going through my head, "The Child =
Inside" (circa 1996), and it made me wonder about life in general.

Do we, as ravers, have a particular "inner child" or hidden spirit of =
dancing that others do not understand?

A few years ago, my Dad actually told some other people close to me that =
I was like a child in some ways, something that they never forget to =
remind me about!

But the funny thing is, I LIKE being a child inside. I think it keeps me =
immune from the modern-day ailments like depression, anxiety, and drug =
abuse. It also makes me smile, something my grandmother always =
appreciates, even today (she misses me in Louisiana, her home state).

Grandma reminded me one day that I used to "lay hands" on her, and pray =
for God to make her feel better.=20

I don't pray much anymore, but I still smile, especially when dancing, =
or when I see the bright eyes of a young innocent child.

Sincerely,
Greg Van Pelt

Subject: RE: [sfraves] ATP: BSP: Sick of "Reality SFR"

Good selections for such a cheap price. I just won a lot of like 10 records 
off of eBay for around $20. The guy lives here in the bay area, and I'm 
meeting him to get the vinyl and avoid shipping charges. There were two 
records in the lot that alone were worth the $20 I paid - the best being 
Deepcuts Vol.2 by Scam. If y'all haven't heard Scam yet - he/she/they 
(whoever it is) is badass funky/nuskool breaks. One of the tracks has this 
Ska kinda feel to it, which would normally make me cringe - but they manage 
to make it work to maximum funkitude. That was a huge score for me.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] (NRR) "fair share" of taxes

was this thread all about the casinos having to pay their fair share of
taxes ?

personally, I was wondering how they've gotten away with it so long, it
seems like those native american groups have kind of taken advantage of the
US's flexibility there, and they're making tons of money from activities
that are illegal to most of us post-natives.
Like cache creek, casino san pablo, places like that, I personally think
it's unfair.

what forms do religious organizations need to claim tax exeption ? Does that
only apply to most normal churches ? Or could a wiccan priest start a
church/coven in the home and calim tax exemption also ?

: )

I figure there are cool club events (21 and over) going on, as there usually 
are, and somebody will post something.  

In terms of regular parties, though (either 18+ or All Ages), doesn't this 
weekend seem less busy than usual? There is Mayday on Saturday, and it has a 
cool lineup, but it's heavily slanted towards Hardcore; what if you're not into 
Hardcore? And what's going on on Friday? Seems like a good weekend for a 
renegade party or a party at someone's house.

i'm of the opinion that the native american tribes should be LEFT THE 
FUCK ALONE ALREADY.

no taxes, no laws (from the US), and no more meddling in their business.

Yeah.  genocide is not enough?  we have to tax them too?  we are eternally
indebted to these groups.  that's not affirmative action, its just right.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] saturday fun?

i'm guessing that the lack of events this weekend might be a result of 
coachella going down in socal.  and speaking of coachella, i'm surprised 
that of all that talent being brought into the state...only Paul van Dyk was 
booked to play SF this weekend (saturday at 1015).

so yes, i agree, it does seem a bit light of a weekend.  but then there's 
also Kraftwerk tonight (is anyone going?).

mayday does sound good and i'm sure that crew is going to throw a dope 
party...but i'm not the hugest fan of hardcore (shut up osby).

When I posted earlier today, I wasn't noticing that there IS a party on 
Friday: Space Monkey's "Year of the Monkey part 1", with trance and NRG, in a 
one-room venue in SF. Looks like a good party.

Subject: RE: [sfraves] NRR: Inner Child Keeps Smiling

I think by dancing it helps us recconect to ourselves.  It is a solo 
mission, breathing, sweating, feeling...you start to get into a zone, it 
relaxes us on many levels.   We live in a society where we are programmed to 
focus away, giving lots of attention to jobs, family, friends...obligations 
without being able to recconect.  Reconnecting to your spirit is DIRE! Great 
music, great times and people is great, and it gives us a chance to play, 
which we have not been able to do for so long.  So when your dad tells you 
you are a child, tell him "Thank you!"

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

hello, this is a continuation of a fictional piece:
 
agatha was sick of watching the shitty news. it was all just a bunch of shit, this crappy world! agatha turned the t.v. off. she was so bored. she was so bored, she started fantasizing about the first rave she went to. at least that was fun. at least she was happy then, and at least she could believe that everyone else was happy then too, because she believed in herself COMPLETELY. maybe a little bit to much, but at least she was on the line then. at least it seemed like there was something going on the made sense for once. something besides fucking hormones for god's sake. :)

Don't you know it's not about performance? It's all about how many dubs, 
whites, and promos you drop.








Well, at least to some people...

You're saying that there are junglists that have an exclusive *more punk
than you* attitudes?? No... Say it isn't so! Someone should just sell white
lable stickers to put over regular pieces of vinyl. That way all the
junglists out there can spin a white label//promo only set and become
super-epic-cool. =P

Subject: Re: [sfraves] (NRR) "fair share" of taxes

	I don't believe in eternal debt or other forms of the original sin  
doctrine that say people are born guilty, but I certainly agree that  
Indian tribes should be left alone. The problem isn't that they *are*  
allowed to have gambling facilities -- the problem is that the rest of  
us *are not*.

	This is kind of the equivalent of medical marijuana -- everyone should  
be able to use pot, but politically we've had to take it a step at a  
time because of the resistance from the prudes. And since that means  
someone getting it first, I can't think anyone I'd rather it be than  
medical users. I feel the same way about Indians and gaming.

	I just hope that when it comes time to allow non-Indian gaming in  
California and other places, that the tribes don't get greedy and use  
their new financial clout to try to keep a monopoly on it. I know,  
that's probably wishful thinking.

	This to me is a big part of what raving is really all about -- 
recapturing the innocence, wonder, and excitement of being a kid. 
Children, toys, cartoons, etc., have been big themes in rave fliers, 
parties, and music, especially early on I think.

Sex, the final frontier: Nasa acts to ensure that astronauts don't follow
their urges
By Charles Arthur, Technology Editor
29 April 2004


In the First World War, frontline troops who were away from their loved
ones for long periods famously had bromide put into their tea to reduce the
distraction of their sexual drive. But yesterday it was suggested that such
measures might be taken a lot further - to Mars, in fact.

Dr Rachel Armstrong, speaking yesterday at a British Interplanetary Society
symposium on the Human Future and Space, said the US space agency Nasa was
considering how to deal with the natural urges of astronauts travelling on
long journeys such as a three-year trip to Mars, where the six-strong crew
would be likely to include two women.

"Nasa is talking about the chemical sterilisation of astronauts on longer
journeys," Dr Armstrong said, in a talk discussing the problems humanity
may face in trying to reach the planets and, eventually, the stars.

Nasa was nonplussed by the suggestion yesterday. "I haven't heard anything
about that," said a spokesman at Nasa's Johnson Space Centre, where the
long-range trips announced by President George Bush in January are being
planned.

But that denial may hide a reluctance, in a nation where the showing of a
nipple on national television provokes a religious outcry, to discuss the
rather delicate subject of sex in space. Certainly, some scientists believe
it is a topic that should be dealt with head on. Douglas Powell, a
psychology professor at Harvard University who was recruited in 1999 by
Nasa to investigate the behavioural needs of long-term space trips, said:
"Like anywhere, these are normal healthy people in their prime and they are
sexually active so they are going to get involved with each other. So
what's going to happen in space? It's a serious question and it needs to be
confronted."

Unusually for a space issue, it is one where physical problems would not
arise, as the presence or absence of gravity doesn't affect body mechanics.

But scientists such as Professor Powell are concerned that the emotional
fallout from having a crew where some are happier than others, or where
relationships are made and then fall apart, could be disastrous. He noted
the comments of one Russian cosmonaut about time spent cooped up in the Mir
space station that "when you have two people locked up in a very small
environment for months at a time, all the conditions for murder are met."
Mix in sex, and you almost have the script of Othello in space.

Other scientists have suggested that the best way to ensure there is no
interplanetary interplay is to crew the mission with astronauts over the
age of 50. "The idea is that they won't be worried about having families
and concerned about getting exposed to radiation, because they're getting
towards the end of their useful working lives," explained Peter Bond, a
British expert on space matters.

"Alongside that is the idea that the ideal Mars mission would have - in
Star Trek terms - two Mr Scotts and two Mr Spocks, and definitely no
Captain Kirks, or Mr Sulus, or Dr McCoys. You need the Scotts to do the
engineering stuff, and the Spocks to do the science. You don't need a Kirk
because all he does is issue orders - and kiss any woman in sight."

Extraterrestrial entanglement is a topic that has been surrounded by rumour
for years. In 2000, a French author, Pierre Kohler, claimed that a
"confidential Nasa report" in 1996 showed that two astronauts had joined
the 200-mile-high club at the agency's behest as part of tests to see how
long humans could survive in space.

Nasa angrily denied the claim, pointing out that the text claiming to be
the report was an internet posting containing grammatical and factual
errors. Similarly, there were allegations that Russia claimed a space first
in 1982 when Svetlana Savitskaya shared the Salyut 7 space station with two
Russian male colleagues. Online postings say there were "experiments" to
try to conceive the first space child. But there is no independent
confirmation of this; instead Savitskaya, who was the second woman in
space, and the first to carry out a space walk, says in her memoirs that
the two male cosmonauts "welcomed me at the hatch with an apron". She threw
it aside and "established a working relationship".

But the push towards Mars raises more difficult questions that Nasa will
have to deal with - even though it has always preferred to push sex as far
down the agenda as humanly possible.

Interestingly, there is no Nasa ban on sex between crew members. "We depend
and rely on the professionalism and good judgement of our astronauts," said
a Nasa spokesman in 2000. "There is nothing specifically or formally
written down."

And that may be part of the problem. A crew heading to Mars would
potentially be away for three years: six months travelling out, two years
on the Red Planet waiting for the Earth to come back into alignment for the
six-month trip back.

The psychological strains of such a trip would be huge, noted Dr Joanna
Wood of Nasa's National Space Biomedical Research Institute, who compares
it with the isolation experienced by scientists in Antarctica. But they
have the comparative luxury that they can be rescued if necessary. With a
Mars trip, there comes a point of no return determined by fuel and the
planets' positions.

"Interpersonal relations is a big issue, but we leave sexual stuff to the
discretion of the individuals," said Dr Wood.

No, I'm not trying to pimp a mix.  I'm doing research for a school/work 
project and I'd like some info about labels'/artists' use of and/or 
experience with market research tools:  what do they use, what kind of 
budget is allotted for this type of info, etc.  Anything would help.  
CMJ/Billboard subscriptions, Big Champagne, etc.

Anyone?  Please respond to me offlist, there's too many damn posts on

Thanks!

Subject: [sfraves] (NRR) Drinking and the Draft

    I think that if they do go ahead and reinstate the draft, they 
should lower the legal drinking age across America to 18. Are we really 
going to tell people "You are adult enough to go fight and die for this 
country, but you're not adult enough to drink, or to stay out past 2am?" 
If they don't make the change across the board, they should at least 
treat those with military IDs as if they are 21. America. The land of 
hypocrisy.

Happy

A happy person is not a person in a certain set of circumstances,
but rather a person with a certain set of attitudes. -Hugh Downs

Radio Hosts to Pay Price for Fooling Fidel
By Jane Sutton

MIAMI (Reuters) - Two Miami radio hosts who duped Cuban President Fidel 
Castro ( news -web sites ) with a prank call are soliciting pennies 
from their fans to pay a $4,000 fine proposed by U.S. regulators 
because of the on-air stunt.

Talk radio host Enrique Santos said the fine made no sense, so he and 
co-host Joe Ferrero will pay it with 400,000 cents, delivered in person 
to the Federal Communications Commission ( news -web sites ) in 
Washington.

"We prank-called a head of state in a country that is considered 
hostile to the United States. He's a violator of human rights and 
they're fining us $4,000," Santos said on Tuesday. "We just find it 
absurd."

Santos and Ferrero host "El Vacilon de la Manana," or "The Morning 
Joker," show on Spanish-language radio station WXDJ-FM in Miami.

On June 17 they phoned Cuba's foreign relations ministry and pretended 
to be aides to Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, an admirer of Castro. 
They said Chavez needed to speak urgently to Castro because he had lost 
a suitcase full of sensitive documents during a recent trip both 
leaders made to Argentina.

The call was transferred through several government officials and when 
Castro came on the line, the pranksters used recorded snippets from a 
Chavez speech to make it seem the Venezuelan leader was calling -- 
phrases like "Fidel," and "How are you?"

After getting Castro to agree to hunt for the suitcase, they called him 
a killer and told him he was on a Miami radio show. Castro replied with 
a string of curses and hung up.

The call was broadcast five times over two days, to the delight of 
Miami's Castro-loathing Cuban exiles.

But the FCC ( news -web sites ) ruled last week that the station 
violated a regulation requiring that participants in phone 
conversations be told in advance if the call is being broadcast.

"It was in fact the intention and result of WXDJ's actions to fool and 
surprise the recipients of the call," the FCC said.

The commission proposed a $4,000 fine against WXDJ and gave it 30 days 
to pay it or contest it. Santos said station managers had not decided 
which to do, but that he and Ferrero would hold an on-air penny drive 
outside a furniture store on Thursday to raise money for the fine.

"The listeners are just outraged," he said. "We're asking people to 
just go through their drawers and cars for any old pennies and drop 
them off."

The FCC said it acted because it received an informal complaint about 
the call, but did not say who complained.

funny, I just watched Moonraker on TV the other day.  The last scene is sex

natural.  Why not spend the money on training a fully compatible crew?

Subject: [sfraves] BSP: DJ Balou on An Epiphany Of Sound today

Today we'll be bringing you straight up house and deep house courtesy of
DJ Balou.  He's my guest today on An Epiphany Of Sound.  Compare his
style to the Wicked style for a frame of reference.  i.e., don't miss

Peace.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Oh Yeah... Congratulations Jack Trumpet! =)

I can't wait to hear Jackie T. on XM Satellite Radio! (this May)

If you don't have it, XM is great! I am totally hooked.

First I had it in my car, but then I sold the car, so I had to get the new
DELPHI boombox with the XM Skyfi receiver. (the new boombox has two sides
that flip/reverse--one for the receiver, and the other for a CD/MP3 player
with AM/FM radio).

True portability for traveling anywhere, although the six D cell batteries
get eaten up quickly. (shore power is better)

Anyway, that's my XM Satellite radio promo! Too bad I don't get credit for
it.
(My favorite channel is BPM in the dance neighborhood)

thanks O§by, I think ;)

..Yes I too was beaming to hear my name on the radio, pretty cool thing.
Even cooler to hear something you spun being played. Anyway not to toot me
own horn too hard, it wasn't the set I would have chosen for this area, but
based on the cat who was on before me, I guess it fit...dj Scot Quick I
think?!?. Overall I haven't received any death threats, so I guess all is in
order. For anyone who is interested the set was entitled "Weltherrschaft"
and is available now for download at www.jacktriumph.com

Thanks again for your support; hopefully more to follow.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] nrr: wise words for a beautiful day

Wow, thanks for this important message/posting. It's food for thought. I
don't know much about the Dalai Lama, having been brought up in other
environments (i.e. a preacher's kid), but this is enlightening.

Even when I was a kid, I was always curious about other avenues of thinking.
(Eastern, Western, or otherwise)

When I was about 11 years old, and I lived in upstate New York, my parents
took me to the Mormon passion play in Elmira several times. When I got
involved/curious (natural for kids), and asked for a copy of the Mormon
bible, my parents were aghast and we quit going to the play! (It's a great
production, too)

So much for cultural values and exchanges. (at least from the Fundamentalist
or United Pentecostal parent perspective).
Anyway, I appreciate the wise words that you posted.

Greg VP

Instructions for Life in the new millennium from the
Dalai Lama:

1. Take into account that great love and great
achievements involve great risk.

2. When you lose, don't lose the lesson.

3. Follow the three Rs: Respect for self, respect for
others and responsibility for all your actions.

4. Remember that not getting what you want is
sometimes a wonderful stroke of luck.

5. Learn the rules so you know how to break them
properly.

6. Don't let a little dispute injure a great
friendship.

7. When you realize you've made a mistake, take
immediate steps to correct it.

8. Spend some time alone every day.

9. Open your arms to change, but don't let go of your
values.

10. Remember that silence is sometimes the best
answer.

11. Live a good, honorable life. Then when you get
older and think back,you'll be able to enjoy it a second time.

12. A loving atmosphere in your home is the
foundation for your life.

13. In disagreements with loved ones, deal only with
the current situation.Don't bring up the past.

14. Share your knowledge. It's a way to achieve
immortality.

15. Be gentle with the earth.

16. Once a year, go some place you've never been
before.

17. Remember that the best relationship is one in
which your love for each other exceeds your need
for each other.

18. Judge your success by what you had to give up in
order to get it.

19. Approach love and cooking with reckless abandon

  Outrageous Legislation

--=====================_2132346==.ALT

DJs, Music Lovers, Drug Policy Reformers Gather to Oppose
Outrageous Legislation

Activists in more than a dozen cities passed petitions to partygoers and 
raised money on April 24, dubbed a "Day and Night of Outrage" by the Drug 
Policy Alliance. We organized the day to fight back against the rising 
momentum behind dangerous legislation in Congress that would put a chill on 
live music.

The legislation would hold anyone from t-shirt vendors to radio station 
owners accountable for someone else's actions. 
<http://actioncenter.drugpolicy.org/ctt.asp?u=488&l=31604>HR 2962, the 
Ecstasy Awareness Act, would jail anyone who "profits monetarily from a 
rave or similar electronic dance event knowing or having reason to know" if 
some of the event-goers use drugs.

Similarly, <http://actioncenter.drugpolicy.org/ctt.asp?u=488&l=31605>HR 
834, the CLEAN-UP Act, makes it a federal crime - punishable by up to nine 
years in prison - to promote "any rave, dance, music, or other 
entertainment event, that takes place under circumstances where the 
promoter knows or reasonably ought to know that a controlled substance will 
be used or distributed."

The Alliance supports other parts of the CLEAN-UP Act, including its main 
purpose, to help law enforcement officers dismantle dangerous 
methamphetamine labs without hurting themselves or the environment. But the 
section dealing with entertainment venues is absurdly punitive. Its effect 
will be to stop live music from being performed, not to stop drug use.

"The government can't even keep drugs out of its own schools and prisons, 
yet it is seeking to punish business owners that can't stop their patrons 
from using drugs," said Bill Piper, Alliance Director of National Affairs. 
"If these bills become law, innocent business owners could go to jail... 
that's why business owners and music fans are organizing to protect live 
music."

"The welfare of the people in particular has always been the alibi of 
tyrants, and it provides the further advantage of giving the servants of 
tyranny a good conscience."
-Albert Camus

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the 
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become 
visible."
-Jacques Attali in his seminal text "Noise"

"I loved the focus in the early days of Wicked on the pagan aspects of 
life. The natural cycles of the full moons, being out in nature, on the 
beach, free, alive, unbridled, wild and spontaneous. There is no club, 
party or other sound system that has ever achieved anything close to that..."
-Jeno, on the early days of Wicked and the Full Moon Raves

Subject: Re: [sfraves] saturday fun?

Ohhhh! Did someone say happy hardcore! I love the stuff cause it's so FAST!

I'm not particularly crazy about the crowd (i.e. e-tards and drugged out
club kids or whatnot), and that's a general statement, I know. But typically
I have seen lots of stoned people at this kind of event.

It doesn't matter, I just get crazy on the hardcore floor. And people always
ask me if I have any E, which I find somewhat amusing.

I've never even tried the stuff.

Why does everyone hate HHC, even in movies like Groove, when the guy says
he'll go to the party as long as they don't play that "happy shit" or
something like that.

In my opinion, it's all good!
As long as I can move my big feet!

I figure there are cool club events (21 and over) going on, as there usually
are, and somebody will post something.

In terms of regular parties, though (either 18+ or All Ages), doesn't this
weekend seem less busy than usual? There is Mayday on Saturday, and it has a
cool lineup, but it's heavily slanted towards Hardcore; what if you're not
into
Hardcore? And what's going on on Friday? Seems like a good weekend for a
renegade party or a party at someone's house.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] behind the scenes of nasa rewind

And the moral of the story is...

Don't throw parties with retards!

Come on man, this guy was obviously a flake from the beginning of the party
process, chalk the $12,000 up to a "learning experience".  If your party
organization looks fucked from the get go, and your co-promoter is up to
shady business from the beginning, guess what, you're probably going to get
fucked in the end!  You have to be smarter than that...

Subject: [sfraves] SFR Behind the Music "Where are they know?"

Ok so this is random and im bored as the painters finish painting my house 
so I thought I would post a few questions to the list..

**DRUM ROLL*** SFR behind the music where are they now series!!


So what ever happen to a infamous DJ that was one reported to be stabbed 
like 6 times and didn't die.. And ya'll though 50 was tuff..  Well he is not 
tuffer then Thomas trouble!! what ever happned to that dood? There are many 
in the scene that did not like him but he was always a straight shooter with 
me so I never had any problems with him.

Ok here is another blast from the past "The V is VORG"

Whatever happened to Vitaly Golomb? I know that he has SFR.COM or net or 
some shit like that but has anybody seen him?

"IF it feels good it is good"!!!

Vlad Cood.. Now I know he is still around here and there but I haven't heard 
much from him. Once again another straight shooter with me though I didn't 
100% agree with his rave business you still have to give him props for 
running succusfully one of the best rave venues we have seen in some time. 
Is he still doing the club whisper thang?

Wayne D. Correra.. (SP)

A once very vocal member of this list and I assume has just merged into the 
whole burning man, PSY older freaky walkabout type of scene? Haven't seen 
him at An FnF party for a while, but then again I don't attend that many.. 
could be the reason too :)

Supa DJ hearthrob Micron..

My once dynamic duo partner in crime and at one time #2 guy to mystere in 
terms of chic magnets.
actually saw him at the last FnF party I think he was trying to become a pro 
surfer or something like that but nevertheless in good spirits.

250 Blowpop  Eric

Now if you know that name your pretty old skewl.. Anyone seen him?

Jupiter Boy

Once again if you know that name your pretty old as well. Anyone?


Well enough randomness from me today im starting to get Geri Dahl syndrome

Subject: [sfraves] Physicists Find Method to Recover Old Audio 

--=====================_11202278==.ALT
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"; format=flowed

Apr 29, 10:58 AM (ET)

By MAY WONG

SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) - Two physicists have discovered a
way to digitally map old, archived audio recordings and
reconstruct the sound.

Four years after hearing a radio report on the challenge of
preserving aging audio recordings, particle physicist Carl
Haber's newfound method of rescuing the classics is music
to archivists' ears.

Haber and a fellow physicist at the Lawrence Berkeley
National Laboratory, Vitaliy Fadeyev, have found a way to
digitally map the grooves in warped or damaged shellac
records and wax cylinders - and play them back using a sort
of virtual needle.

To do so, they use the same optical scanning method -
powered by a microscope and computer technology - that
physicists employ for measuring the journeys of subatomic
particles.

The technique detects and filters any scratches, as well as
clicks and pops from dust. It works with vinyl, too, though
such records aren't as fragile to need it.

Roughly 2.5 million music and spoken-word recordings are
stored in the Library of Congress - the project's sponsor -
but some are more than a century old and very delicate.
Archivists risk further damage if they use a real stylus to
play and re-record them.

"This marks a whole new direction for sound archiving,"
said Mark Roosa, the library's director for preservation.
"They're reconstructing sound as we had never imagined
would be possible, even if there are cracks in the
cylinder."

The physicists hope their research will ultimately lead to
a machine to preserve and enhance public access to sounds
of history.

"Archivists want tools that will allow them to copy
recordings with as little intervention as possible," Haber
said. "It's starting to almost look like there could be a
Xerox machine for recordings."

"The welfare of the people in particular has always been the alibi of 
tyrants, and it provides the further advantage of giving the servants of 
tyranny a good conscience."
-Albert Camus

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the 
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become 
visible."
-Jacques Attali in his seminal text "Noise"

"I loved the focus in the early days of Wicked on the pagan aspects of 
life. The natural cycles of the full moons, being out in nature, on the 
beach, free, alive, unbridled, wild and spontaneous. There is no club, 
party or other sound system that has ever achieved anything close to that..."

Rumor has it that Wayne now dislikes psy and the psy-scene.  He was
last scene-spotted at an SLA Womb party.  I have bumped into him dining at
the outdoor tables at the various french restuants on Potrero Hill.  
I beleive he is still an avid Burner.

Subject: [sfraves]NRR: Laptop Advice - Last cry for help

Hey all,

If it wasn't for this board, I wouldn't have invested my good money into a 
kick ass pair of technics rather than some belt driven crap.  So before I go 
investing 1000 bucks on a laptop, I thought I would check with you all 
first.

I have around 1000 dollars to spend, and I want the best I can get.  This 
laptop will be used primarily with Sonar 2.0 XL, Reason 2.5, Soundforge 7 
and I will hopefully be getting my hands on final scratch soon.

I want at least:

1.2 gHz processor
512-1000 ram
30 gig hard drive
wifi access
USB 2.0

Please advise!  I know there are possiblities of buying a laptop and then 
adding ram later, so if your an expert at those types of deals, please let 
me know.

Thanks Everyone.

fable....

U.S. soldiers allegedly abused prisoners

BY ARNOLD ABRAMS AND JOHN MORENO GONZALES
Staff Writers

April 29, 2004, 9:30 PM EDT

American military police officers manning what was once Saddam Hussein's 
most notorious prison are under investigation for torturing Iraqi detainees 
with threats of electrocution, forcing them to simulate oral sex, beating 
them, and ordering them to beat each other, according to Army officials.

The 17 U.S. soldiers removed from duty in connection to the photographed 
incidents at Abu Ghraib prison near Baghdad include six being held for 
court martial in Iraq. The command unit for the reserve force is the 800th 
Military Police Brigade headquartered in Uniondale, but the 310th MP 
battalion under that umbrella and encompassing about 150 members mostly 
from Long Island is not connected to the alleged misdeeds, Army officials 
told Newsday yesterday.

While Army spokesmen in Baghdad would not comment yesterday on the 
specifics of the alleged incidents, Brig. Gen. Mark Kimmitt, deputy 
director of coalition operations in Iraq, appeared on CBS Wednesday and 
acknowledged damning photos of American soldiers behaving like Hussein's 
henchmen.

Kimmitt said on the program: "Don't judge your army based on the actions of 
a few. ... Every day, we love our soldiers, but frankly, some days we're 
not always proud of our soldiers."

In most of the graphic photos taken inside the dank prison, male and female 
soldiers are captured laughing, or giving the camera a thumbs-up.

The CBS program "60 Minutes II" that aired Wednesday showed a prisoner 
standing on a narrow box with his head hooded and body draped by a 
makeshift poncho. Wires were attached to his fingers and he was warned that 
if he fell off the perch, he would be electrocuted, Army investigators 
said. Other snapshots show nude Iraqis stacked in a human pyramid, an 
American slur scrawled on one man's skin. They also show Iraqi prisoners 
positioned to simulate oral sex.

The pictures were taken late last year by the guards themselves, who, 
military sources said yesterday, were part of the 372nd MP Company based in 
Cumberland, Md. They were turned over to a commander by a soldier who 
reportedly said mistreatment was taking place "that I cannot live with."

The Army announced charges of dereliction of duty, cruelty, maltreatment, 
assault and indecent acts against the six soldiers on March 20 but would 
not give details at that time.

Staff Sgt. Chip Fredrick told CBS that poor training for the reserve unit 
was the root of the abuse with which he is now charged. Frederick, whose 
family and attorney could not be reached for comment yesterday, said 
superiors and civilian observers, including the FBI and CIA, turned a blind 
eye and even encouraged the behavior.

"I kept asking my chain of command for certain things, rules and 
regulations, and it just wasn't happening," he said, noting that soldiers 
also sicced guard dogs on prisoners.

Iraqis have charged for months that American soldiers were abusing their 
powers. Last month, Newsday interviewed Iraqi detainees who said American 
forces beat and tortured them.

One man, Abdul Kahar Mehdi, 30, a teacher, said U.S. soldiers terrified him 
and killed his 70-year-old father Mehdi Jamal al-Duraj. They pulled plastic 
bags over their heads and tightened them around their necks in a noose that 
suffocated the older man, he said.

U.S. military officials apologized for the death of his father and in 
February issued Mehdi a letter saying they were investigating the incident.

As he guarded Abu Ghraib, Frederick, a correction officer at a Virginia 
prison, sent an e-mail to his family expressing pride in the unit's ability 
to crack Iraqis.

"Military intelligence has encouraged and told us 'Great job,'" he said in 
the correspondence obtained by CBS. "They usually don't allow others to 
watch them interrogate. But since they like the way I run the prison, they 
have made an exception. . . . They [Iraqi detainees] usually end up 
breaking within hours."

Brig. Gen. Janice Karpinski, who ran Abu Ghraib during the incidents, left 
Iraq earlier this year as part of a scheduled rotation. She could be 
relieved of her command, blocked from promotion, or receive a letter of 
reprimand, Col. Jill Morgenthaler, a military spokeswoman in Baghdad, said 
yesterday.

In January, four other Army military police reservists were 
less-than-honorably discharged for allegedly beating prisoners at Camp 
Bucca, a detention center near the southern city of Basra.

The Army's investigation of the Abu Ghraib incidents began the same month. 
According to CBS, it includes statements from an Iraqi detainee who says a 
translator hired to work at the prison raped a male juvenile prisoner.

CBS also reported that there is a photo inside the prison of an Iraqi man 
who appears to be dead and recently beaten.

"I don't know the facts surrounding what caused the bruising and the 
bleeding," Kimmitt said Wednesday of that photo.

--=====================_2683458==.ALT
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"; format=flowed


Allen Cohen - Editor/Poet/Teacher/Visionary - passed away peacefully on April
29th in Walnut Creek, CA succumbing to his battle with cancer.  He was 64.

Mr. Cohen was born in Brooklyn, New York in 1940 to a working class family.
Inspired by Jack Kerouac's On The Road, upon graduating Brooklyn College in
1962 Mr. Cohen began his vision quest by taking a cross-country trip that
eventually led him to San Francisco.  Following in the steps of Allen Ginsberg,
Neal Cassidy, and Lawrence Ferlinghetti, Mr. Cohen lived in San Francisco's
North Beach District, well known for it's home to Beat writers and bohemians.
North Beach was a Mecca to other aspiring writers such as Mr. Cohen, because of
the area's vibrant nightlife with its many cafes and clubs where poets and jazz
musicians would convene in a spirit of free expression.  At that time LSD was
legal and it fueled the artistic community of San Francisco with vivid colorful
images and an expressive eloquent tone in its literature.  It was during this
period that Mr. Cohen's visionary quest would soon be realized.

"The welfare of the people in particular has always been the alibi of 
tyrants, and it provides the further advantage of giving the servants of 
tyranny a good conscience."
-Albert Camus

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the 
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become 
visible."
-Jacques Attali in his seminal text "Noise"

"I loved the focus in the early days of Wicked on the pagan aspects of 
life. The natural cycles of the full moons, being out in nature, on the 
beach, free, alive, unbridled, wild and spontaneous. There is no club, 
party or other sound system that has ever achieved anything close to that..."
-Jeno, on the early days of Wicked and the Full Moon Raves

May Day Trivia:

=95 Traditional May Day celebrations were pre-Christian agricultural festiv=
als. Eventually the significance was lost and the practices survived merely=
 as popular festivities. (Which can also be said about other holidays: Hall=
oween, Christmas, Easter.)

=95 A widespread superstition held that washing the face in the May Day mor=
ning dew would beautify the skin.

=95 In Hawaii, May Day is Lei Day. Everyone gives the gift of a lei to anot=
her, putting it around the receiver's neck and accompanying the gift with t=
he traditional kiss. Observing practices of the islanders for centuries, Le=
i Day began to be observed officially in 1928. Some Hawaiian celebrations a=
re complete with pageants, a Lei Queen and her court.

=95 In 1889, a congress of world Socialist parties held in Paris voted to s=
upport the U.S. labor movement's demand for an 8-hour day. It chose May 1, =
1890, as a day of demonstrations in favor of the 8-hour day. Afterward, May=
 1 became a holiday called Labor Day in many nations. It resembles the Sept=
ember holiday in the U.S. The holiday is especially important in socialist =
and Communist countries--when political demonstrations are held.

Wednesday, May 5, 2004 ** Spring Gathering **

Our 4th Annual Spring Gathering will be held at Gaia's Oasis Retreat in Aub=
erry, CA from May 5th ~ 9th The schedule of events including all workshops =
and activities has been added to our website:
www.firedrumcircle.org/SGInfo...kshops.htm

Other gathering information can be found here:
www.firedrumcircle.org/SGInfo...ingGathering.htm

Also, the reg. deadline is coming up- April 23rd. If you do not think you c=
an come up for the entire gathering, that is fine. We understand that life =
can get in the way of things. Remember this is an intimate gathering, we ar=
e all family here... so if you have any questions or concerns, don't hesita=
te to bring it up. We are definitely open to making arrangements to fit you=
r needs. :) I have posted some text below. It is something that the other o=
rganizer wrote in response to someone's questions about our gathering. Hope=
fully from that you will get a better understanding of what we're about.

***
Spring Gathering is more in the tradition of sacred tribal gatherings of ce=
nturies past, with hand drums and fire, song, chant, dance and community be=
ing the binding of our magic together. : >

The registration is because as much as we'd like this event to be free, as =
that's more in line with our beliefs and ideals, we have to recover at leas=
t our out-of-pocket expenses. Also, having to register in advance creates a=
 certain amount of commitment to the gathering that we are looking for. How=
ever, if financial issues are the only thing keeping some one who wants to =
come from attending, we will work it out for you. We're not about the money=
=2E If you want to be here, we'll do everything we can to make that happen.=
 That's what's important to us in the long run.

The Spring Gathering, and really much of Fire Drum Circle, is a grand exper=
iment of living, being, playing and creating together in community. Each ni=
ght we gather together around the fire circle, and each day we play togethe=
r doing yoga, workshops, sharing community meals, and really making it up a=
s we go along! If you haven't gone before, I highly recommend you come expe=
rience for yourself what this community has for you and what you have for u=
s. We attract a really diverse crowd and everyone brings such an amazing en=
ergy.

Friday, May 7, 2004 ** Melon : Josh Wink **

Red Melon is proud to finally be able to showcase one of the biggest succes=
s stories in the underground house movement. Ask yourself how many globally=
 respected, underground artist-producer-DJs have turned-down offers to tour=
 with U2, and you will likely draw a short list. Josh Wink is such an artis=
t -- one who is unassuming, yet enjoys a cult following and who places arti=
stic integrity above all else. Owner of Ovum Recordings and remixer of mega=
-talents such as Sting, Depeche Mode and Ladytron, Josh has made only rare =
appearences in San Francisco, so don't miss out.

Supporting Josh will be Dano, Dj and tech house producer from San Francisco=
=2E  After a long winter touring Australia, New Zealand, and Eastern Europe=
, Dano is back in town working in the studio for a few months.  Dano has th=
ree new releases coming out simultaneously on Silicone Soul's Darkroom Dubs=
 imprint, Honchos Music, and Red Melon.  He will be spinning fresh techy gr=
ooves along with red melon biz partner JZ.  No stranger to the Melon experi=
ence, JZ is responsible for some of the most memorable sets in the seven ye=
ars of parties Red Melon has produced.  It will be just like old times!

If you are serious about your Red Melon parties, this Melon is not to be mi=
ssed! Get there before 11:00pm to take advantage of an earlybird cover char=
ge of $10 at San Francisco's newest venue, Mighty, located at 119 Utah St a=
t 15th Street. Mighty is a beautiful renovated warehouse with a touch of te=
chnology and art and the massive sound system that made Club Townsend a San=
 Francisco favorite. All of that plus cheap drinks too! You can't go wrong.=

Saturday, May 8, 2004 ** Taurus presented byElektrosorcery **

 Taurus  by Elektrosorcery - The Taurean's characteristics are solidity, pr=
acticality, extreme determination and strength of will - no one will ever d=
rive them, but they will willingly and loyally follow a leader they trust. =
They are stable, balanced, conservative good, law-abiding citizens and love=
rs of peace, possessing all the best qualities of the bourgeoisie. As they =
have a sense of material values and physical possessions, respect for prope=
rty and a horror of falling into debt, they will do everything in their pow=
er to maintain the security of the status quo and be somewhat hostile to ch=
ange. Mentally, they are keen-witted and practical more often than intellec=
tual, but apt to become fixed in their opinions through their preference fo=
r following accepted and reliable patterns of experience. Their character i=
s generally dependable, steadfast, prudent, just, firm and unshaken in the =
face of difficulties. Their vices arise from their virtues, going to extrem=
es on occasion,such as sometimes being too slavish to the conventions they =
admire.  With Taurus DJs: James Dub, Valerie Sparks, Elz, Nomad, Cauze, Cyr=
us, Aaron Jae, No Left Turn, Phokus, Reclipse, Rodel, Zoe, Michael Allen. A=
