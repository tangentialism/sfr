OK.. so like yeah... things kinda happened unexpectedly on my endof things
& I ended up not going 2 class lastnight... so LoL.. I went 2 the ol' BnB
early 4 ummm... the open decks throwdown 4 Cannabass.. it's also like
mondo Groovy 'cause well.. I picked up an old story I wrote like 2 years
ago that I ended as an open ending end.. & i read it again & thought,
Hello 2day, let's add more.. so I can honestly say that I did spend a huge
chunk of the night like writing in my notebook.. LoL

OK.. DJs... ummm.. there was like this tall Groovy "Berkeley Kid" lookin
Cat who busted a good set during open decks well.. it was more or less the
sound check set 'cause yeah... they had some probs.. but it worked out..
Dope!

OK... My Jungle Slut from Santa Cruz & her BF came up 2 spin... so Dymphna
hit the decks & ya know.. it was a really chill set from her lastnight...
she played alot tracks that, Ummm, like had more of the jazzy instrumental
breakdowns playing then the hard bass jungle, like i dunno.. reversed dnb
songs.. la la la.. but it was smooth.. she pretty much stayed jazzy the
set, so yeah!  So Dope!!  Oh yeah.. but she did get in some hard tunes
here & there, so that was Groovy!  But yeah.. the many many times I've
seen Dymphna spin... this may have been the 1st time ever I heardher go
mello & not hard boom boom boom... LoL

OK.. DJ Sik went on next... he took up a step & well.. he played OK ok
ok.. shoot me if I'm getting this wrong, Liquid Funk!?!?!! YUMMY none the
less!

OK.. now KODA went up & yeah.. he played his signature raga Jungle, but it
was a trip.. he busted out this track that wasn't Raga,, so that weird &
like when that track dropped, me & Lewt like looked @ each other & laughed
=)

O.. but I wasn't there 4 all of KODA's set 'cause, YAY, my Homie Crash
from LA came up 2 Oakland 2 spin & him, me, & his GF went 2 get like food
real quick...

We got bac & KODA finished his set.. OK.. then Crash went on..
Heeeeeeeeello 2Day,,, see,, Homeboy's been my Bro 4 like the past 2 years
& we ain't seen each other since 2004... but we do talk online like every
other day!!  He just picked up the tables last year or like year & 1/2 &
right away practiced on DNB 'cause that's his musical Love!  \O/  Yeah.. &
now he's fuckin Sick w/ his spinning!!  YAY!!  His set was fuckin
Awesome!!  I mean.. yeah.. he was just playing all this hard bassy jungle
& me & his GF totally like grabbed floor!

The vibe was chill.. I mean.. there wre people dancing, people drink,
alota laughing... it was a Good night there!!  I Loved it!!!  YAY!!

events between SFRaves & other crews, promoters, djs, artists, venue

our diverse and fantastic community.

3) To plan, organize, promote and host current, future and ongoing events 
for the SFRaves community and beyond into the reaches of the Nightlife and 
Dance community in the greater SF / SJ Bay Area. This includes 
collaborative events, one-offs, weekly events, outdoor and indoor events, 
small intimate affairs and large gatherings. This theme is growing and 
includes plans for outdoor campouts, bonfires and burns, as well as 
planning the SFRaves 13 Year Anniversary which is now in planning stages.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Moby gets skewered.

Oh yeah I've been on a big Kruder and Dorfmeister kick lately.  I just
recently downloaded a bunch of mixes of theirs.  They know how to
bring on the chill like it aint no thang.  Perfect morning music, i
love smokin a phatty blunt and chillin in the morning watching a
sunrise while listening to K&D.

FUCKING A-MEN.

I think the lack of new K&D shit is at least part of what pushed Matt
and I to really freak the fuck out with our shit.

A new *originals* album would rock my socks so hard.  I loved the
'sessions but G-Stoned still reigns supreme for me.

*cue flapping ruler sound*

Subject: [sfraves] Stop Crying Over Spilt Milk

Ok i'm tired of hearing about this stupid Terri Schiavo crap.  Why's
everyone gotta have their panties crammed up their butts over this one
stupid girl.  There are probably a few hundred of people in very
similar situations, but you dont hear crap from them or their
families.  Why get so worked up over this one?  I dont get it.  It's
stupid and retard, just like she was.

Actually it's funny cause she may have been retarded confined to a
life of drooling on herself, but you know what?  It was her parents
who were the real retards.  I mean come on, who would want to see
their child live like that?  To carry this crap on for 15 years?  Well
actually the real legal bullshit didnt start until like what year 8? 
Which to me is still way too long to let her live like that.  But to
then drag it through the court system for another 7 years?  That's so
stupid.  Now it's all thrown up in our faces, and we cant escape it. 
I put a lot of effort into avoiding the news.  Cause to me it's like
listening to 94.9 or some other piece of shit top 40 radio station. 
Listen to some crap...take a 2 minute break, listen to the same crap
again...talk about something else for a minute and now that you think
you're done listening to the same piece of shit, here you go again,
only this time we're gonna play the super long extended club you over
the head mix and then just to make sure you dont forget it, we'll go
over it one more time, before we go over it again.

Stupid religious parents...just let her die and go be with your God. 
If he truely is all powerful and all fogiving and all that shit and
looks down on suicide/euthenasia and what not, i think he'll still
take little Terri into his arms at the pearly necklace...er i mean
pearly gate.  So why not end her suffering and live out the rest of
her afterlife in peace and happiness.  Lets film this chick for like 5
hours and edit it down to the 4 minutes we think she might have
actually be responsive and use that as our defense that she is
responsive and not a permanent kumquat.  How stupid is that?  Sounds
like they should go work for Fox News, so they can help them edit it
out all the truth and reality in news and force feed us what the
stupid right wing dumbasses have the think about stuff, then maybe one
day they can work their way up to the glorius position of being G. W's
personal ass wipers.

I cant belive they enjoyed seeing their child like that.  I mean sure
i bet they loved her more than anything and no parent wants their
child to die before them, but come on.  Is the pain of knowing your
daughter died with as little suffering as possible, greater then the
pain of seeing your child live a meaningless miserable life every day?
 I for one, would rather have the one single pain of knowing i had to
end my childs life for the better.  Knowing I let them die in peace
and not live a fabulous life of drooling on themselves, would help me
get over it, and i was relish in all the happy memories.  It'd be more
painful to have to go to a hospital everyday to see my child drool on
itself because i could no longer give it the care that it needed. 
Sounds like like taking a needle and slowly pushing it into your
eye...god damn this hurts, but for some reason i just cant stop
myself.  Fucking stupid plain and simple.

I'ma guess it's cuz the republicans needed something to distract the country 
from that nasty little mess in the middle east - that's why this Schiavo 
thing has been such a huge deal.

Isn;t it nice to know our govt. can't do shit for our healthcare system, but 
can step in over ONE person and turn her story into a media circus?

*yawn*

It bores me.

Question - if they are so damn serious about their religion, wouldn't they 
WANT her to get to heaven and NOT suffer? Stupid Christians. (no offense to 
all you other stupid christians)

Yeah, they should be doing the serious work of the government... like
holding baseball steriods hearings.

Notice the only 2 real things this congress has accomplished is to
screw consumers in favor of Big Business? (Bankruptcy Bill and Class
Action lawsuit reform).

Whatever your personal beliefs are concerning Terry
Schiavo...

Were you aware that George W. Bush signed a law in
Texas that expressly gave hospitals the right to remove
life support if the patient could not pay and there was
no hope of revival, regardless of the patient's
family's wishes? It is called the Texas Futile Care
Law.

Under this law, a baby was removed from life support
against his mother's wishes in Texas just this week. A
68 year old man was given a temporary reprieve by the
Texas courts just yesterday.

Were you aware that Republicans have voted en masse to
pull the plug (no pun intended) on Medicaid funding
that pays for the kind of care that someone like Terry
Schiavo and many others who are not so severely brain
damaged need all across this country?

Were you aware that the tort reform that is being
contemplated by the Republican congress would preclude
malpractice claims like that which has paid for Terry
Schiavo's care thus far?

Were you aware that the bankruptcy bill will make it
even more difficult for families who suffer a
catastrophic illness like Terry Schiavo's because they
will not be able to declare chapter 7 bankruptcy and
get a fresh start when the gargantuan medical bills
become overwhelming?

Were you aware that this grandstanding by the congress
is a purely political move designed to appease the
religious right and that the legal maneuverings being
employed would be anathema to any true small government
conservative? (See the now infamous memo circulated to
GOP House & Senate members...)

We are now seeing a spectacle on television in which
the news anchors repeatedly say that the congress is
"stepping in to save Terry Schiavo" mimicking the
unctuous words of Tom Delay as they grovel and leer at
the family and nod sympathetically at the sanctimonious
opportunists who are using this issue for their
political gain.

This is why it's become so difficult to trust the
mainstream media. Most people get their news from
television. And television is presenting this issue as
a round the clock one dimensional soap opera pitting
the "family", the congress and the church against this
woman's husband and the judicial system that upheld
Terry Schiavo's right and explicit request that she be
allowed to die if extraordinary means were required to
keep her alive. The ghoulish infotainment industry is
making a killing by acceding once again to trumped up
right wing hypocrisy.

sorry for the late notice on this...  anyway, it
should be fun!  if you haven't been to a Reclaim the
Streets before, come check it out.  they've got the
spirit of a great underground renegade - but set loose
on the streets of SF...

RTS-SF and the Coalition for Transit Justice in
standing up against muni fare hikes! Experience
thepower of community, delight in the thrill of an
impromptu street party, revel in creative
performances, art, dancing, and music, all while
taking a stand against the increasing commodification
of public space and public transportation.  

Bring your banners, noisemakers, puppets, urban
redecoration toolkits, friends and of course your very
sexy self to Dolores Park, Saturday April 2nd at noon
o'clock. This parade gets on the road at one pm,
marching to an undisclosed location for a street party
and masquerade ball. So don't forget to come in
costume! 

(I can't vouch for the music for the whole event, but
i do know there's going to be some hot
technofunk/electro including some original tunes from
12:30 to 1pm in Dolores Park before the march starts.)

Somebody said a second ago that he's probably dead & that the Vatican just isn't ready to announce it. I think that's probably that most accurate assesment I've heard so far.

Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"; format=flowed


THURSDAY, Mar. 31st to April 1st
Club 6 Presents
The Filming of
RENT THE MOVIE

Chris Columbus, the same film director who brought us Home Alone (1990), 
Mrs. Doubtfire (1993), Nine Months (1995), Stepmom (1998), Bicentennial Man 
(1999), Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (2001) and Harry Potter and 
the Chamber of Secrets (2002), plans to make his next movie in his own 
backyard -- between San Francisco and the East Bay.

6th St. was chosen because of it's unique resemblance of the Lower East 
Side in the 70's. During the filming of the movie, Club 6ix will be 
transformed into a transvestite bar frequented by the main characters.

House Music 101:  http://livingart.com/raving/articles/housemusic101.htm


The US is:  "...a nation of 200 million used-car salesmen with all the 
money we need to buy guns and no qualms about killing anybody else in the 
world who tries to make us uncomfortable."
-Hunter S. Thompson

"Friend, hope for the truth while you are alive.  Jump into experience 
while you are alive!  What you call "salvation" belongs to the time before 
death.  If you don't break your ropes while you are alive, do you think 
ghosts will do it after?"
-Kabir

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the 
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become 
visible."
-Jacques Attali in his seminal text "Noise"

Subject: [sfraves] BBQ and Picnic tomorrow in the park

Saturday April 2nd 2PM at the BBQ pits in Lindley Meadow at Golden Gate 
Park...

This is a byos party - Bring your own shit. Whatever you wanna eat, drink, 
smoke, or trip out on.

Things to bring: sunscreen, food, charcoal (if you're gonna get your 'cue 
on), lighter fluid, drinks (I don't know what the rules are on alcohol in 
the park, so if you don't know either, be discreet...), blankets, tents (if 
you're feeling extreme), peanut butter and jelly sandwichs, ghetto blasters, 
guitars, bongos, sunglasses, and hugs for the homies.

Things to not bring: Guns and mean people.

Alright, y'all wanted to bbq also... so we're gonna meet at the bbq pits in 
Golden Gate Park. The bbq pits are located in Lindley Meadow by the polo 
field. If you have acrobat and you want to see where the pits are, check out 
the following link and look at point 12.

hey it's  friday and i'm chilling so i write a few as i'm listening to
CL's new album 'Unhooked: The Hook Sessions'.  bash me if you are not
a trance/techno fan would yer ;)

what's up with this dude?  always get me kicking and acting foolishly
with pumping musics outloud?  i mean when i go to mainstream music
stores i often find myself wondering around the techno section looking
for his latest gigs.  called me hypnotized and brainwashed.  call me
anything your like... but i just like his stuff.  albeit some albums
shared same tracks but they go together in harmonously per album..

what do i say about CL'slatest album?  go buy it along with a seven
pack of mood altering stuff then chill forget anything that u wanna
forget.

have a wonderful weekend folks.

l&hugs.

Subject: [sfraves] ARGHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!

    sorry, i need to vent bigtime. so the restaurant
that i have been mangaing for a little while opened a
new location. the one i work at has the "commisary
kitchen" which means that we make everything for all
the other locations. which means that my life is hell
right now. 

my boys in the back are mad because they don't have
the equipment they need. it's been ordered, after
bothering the bosses for a week, but who knows when it
will come? 

my foh staff is pissed because our location is running
out of things, which they hate. cause of course the
customers get pissy when that happens. 

my suppliers are mad cause i can't give them a clear
idea day to day what to expect. hiccups of opening a
new place. 

and i'm pretty sure next week my bosses will be a
little miffed because i intentionally over ordered
going into the weekend because we don't get another
delivery till monday. 

not to mention the fact that because a new location
opened i am now understaffed, specially since i have
to fire someone on monday for stealing money and the
gm (i'm the am) is out of town till april 12th.
horrible timing. 

needless to say, i am ecstatic that i have this
weekend off. between brass tax, get freaky, and god
knows where saturday will take me, then some good
outdoor earthy dirty fun, i will hopefully go into
next week, which will only be harder, a little calmer
and much happier. god i wish i was really off of work.
this is the longest day i've pulled in a while, only
cause i have to wait for this one customer to come in
so i can deal with his order. then i'm done. party
time!!!!! he better be on time!

>Spirit of Raving Question: How do you define Community?

Community...or Come-Unity...seems to be becoming an ever more elusive 
experience lately in the nightlife business.  Recently I have been 
rereading Hunter S. Thompson's "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"  -- last 
read was when it was published.

This excerpt is an excellent description of "community" in my humble opinion:

"...it seems entirely reasonable to think that every now and then the 
energy of a whole generation comes to a head in a long fine flash, for 
reasons that nobody really understands at the time­and which never explain, 
in retrospect, what actually happened.

My central memory of that time (the mid-sixties in SF) seems to hang on one 
or five or maybe forty nights­or very early mornings­when I left the 
Fillmore half-crazy and, instead of going home, aimed the big 650 Lightning 
across the Bay Bridge at a hundred miles an hour wearing L. L. Bean shorts 
and a Butte sheepherder's jacket . . . booming through the Treasure Island 
tunnel at the lights of Oakland and Berkeley and Richmond, not quite sure 
which turn-off to take when I got to the other end (always stalling at the 
toll-gate, too twisted to find neutral while I fumbled for change) . . but 
being absolutely certain that no matter which way I went I would come to a 
place where people were just as high and wild as I was: No doubt at all 
about that. . . .

There was madness in any direction, at any hour. If not across the Bay, 
then up the Golden Gate or down 101 to Los Altos or La Honda. . . . You 
could strike sparks anywhere. There was a fantastic universal sense that 
whatever we were doing was right, that we were winning... .

And that, I think, was the handle­that sense of inevitable victory over the 
forces of Old and Evil. Not in any mean or military sense; we didn't need 
that. Our energy would simply prevail. There was no point in fighting­on 
our side or theirs. We had all the momentum; we were riding the crest of a 
high and beautiful wave... .

So now...you can go up on a steep hill...and look West, and with the right 
kind of eyes you can almost see the high-water mark­that place where the 
wave finally broke and rolled back."

Love,

The US is:  "...a nation of 200 million used-car salesmen with all the 
money we need to buy guns and no qualms about killing anybody else in the 
world who tries to make us uncomfortable."
-Hunter S. Thompson

"Friend, hope for the truth while you are alive.  Jump into experience 
while you are alive!  What you call "salvation" belongs to the time before 
death.  If you don't break your ropes while you are alive, do you think 
ghosts will do it after?"
-Kabir

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the 
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become 
visible."
-Jacques Attali in his seminal text "Noise"

He lives 3 blocks away from me in phoenix. Kinda funny actually.

Anyhow, have fun with him. I've got him booked for gigs when he comes

    I really want to see the meeting minutes too,
becuase there were some parts I missed due to smoking,
bathroom, talking to the bartender, etc. Wondering
when the next meeting will be, what all needs to be
done and by whom. The whole nine yards.

At least you were able to attend. I'm 700 miles away, so it's the only
way I can really hear what was discussed in any sense.
Looking forward to seeing what was said, so I can get involved.

Subject: [sfraves] [NRR] Papal Reform

Ok, so the Pope is dead, it's time to reform.  We need a new
direction, a new vision, a new kick in the pants to push us into the
21st century with a full head of steam.

I think the best way to do that would be to vote me for the Papal
seat.  Who better for that position than me?  A man of great wisdom
and charity.  I may not be a priest of Catholicism or any religion
other than my own for that matter.  Why do we need such a rule like
that.  I've been clean and celebate and true to myself my whole life,
I'm a perfect canidate.  According to some predictions, there's only 2
seats in the Papal office left.  Help make me one of them.  Put your
trust and faith into me and cast your ballot.  Rush to you local
priest or cardinal and submit my name for candidacy.  I shall not let
you down.

Vote for Pope Chester I "The Great Molester"

Subject: [sfraves] technotica SF question

Hi all,
   I just ran across a technotica sf set that I grabbed off flux.fm a
long while back from 11/24/03 and I was wondering if anyone knew who
the DJ was? If I remember Forest and Clarity were running the show but
I doesn't seem like either of them when compared to their sets from
the previous shows. Any idea?

Thanks,
   bryan

Did i disrespect the dead?  where?  when?  I dont recall saying
anything about anyone dead, except for where i said

> "Ok, so the Pope is dead, it's time to reform."

How's that disrespecting the dead?  Did i walk over to his limp
lifeless body and teabag his chin?  or take a dump in his Papal Hat
next to his deathbed?  i don't recall any of that, i guess it could
have happened in a drunken stupor, but i doubt that cause i havent
been in any lately.

So if you could please point out the disrespect, I'd appreciate it. 
If it truely was disrespect, maybe you all will get lucky and hear an
apology out of me, but seeing as how i dont see any disrespect i guess
you all will just have to keep holding your breath.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] [NRR] Papal Reform

It's not like the cardinals arent doing the same thing, they're going
about trying to figure out who's next.  They do that everytime they
confirm the pope is dead....start figuring out who's gonna be next,
cause the world will fall apart if there isnt a pope to lead the
sheep.

I fail to see the callousness of that sentence, and if people do take
it as disrepectful and callous, then they need to take their finger
and jam them far, far, far up their ass and pull those pretty pink
panties they have all bunched up in there out, maybe then they'll be
able to relax a little.

Most religions/governments all do the same thing, once the current
seat of power is opened, they worry about getting it filled back in. 
It helps restore "order" and bring peace to their pathetic little
lives, cause with out someone one to tell them what to do, what will
they do...it's maddening, the world will spin off it's axis and we'll
all die in the firey glow which we call our sun.  It's not callous and
anyone who thinks that, is retarded just like terri schiavo was.

Everytime someone says "The pope is dead" I think of the Smiths and "the
queen is dead" then I think of what a great album that was.

Oh mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head...

Oral sex 'is best'  !!!


Washington - US teenagers apparently prefer oral sex as a safer and morally 
more acceptable alternative to intercourse, a possible explanation for 
their rare use of condoms, according to a small poll by the University of 
California.

Around 20% of the ethnically diverse 580 teenagers - 42% boys, 58% girls 
with a mean age of 14 - who answered a questionnaire in the study published 
on Monday, admitted having had oral sex, compared to 14% who had had 
intercourse.

In addition, one third of the survey group said they intended to experiment 
with oral sex in the following six months, said the medical researchers 
headed by University of California paediatrics professor Bonnie 
Halpern-Felsher.

The teenagers in the survey said they preferred oral sex because they 
believed it carried "significantly less risk" than intercourse in terms of 
its health, social and emotional consequences, according to the study.

This perception would explain why condom use among teenagers is so rare, 
the researchers said.

Although the risk of contracting sexually transmitted diseases, including 
Aids, is considerably lower with oral sex as opposed to regular sexual 
relations, young people too often underestimate it, said the study 
published in the latest issue of Paediatrics.

* Remembering Japanese American Civil Rights Pioneer Fred Korematsu *

Japanese American civil rights pioneer Fred Korematsu has died at the age of
86. He was jailed during World War II refusing orders to be sent to an
internment camp set up for U.S residents of Japanese ancestry. We air an
excerpt of the documentary, "Of Civil Rights and Wrongs: The Fred Korematsu
Story" and we speak with one of his attorneys.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR: Remembering Japanese American Civil Rights Pioneer Fred Korematsu

i was a little dissappointed that the Korematsu's passing wasn't given
more attention considering the impact that his original case and the
retributions had on our nation.  the original 1942 Korematsu vs.
United States is widely referenced to in all legal textbooks.  the
1982 case overturned the original ruling, which ultimately led to the
US government apologizing and admitting they were wrong for
imprisoning 120,000+ persons of Japanese ancestry during WWII.

His story is a very interesting one, even more so for me since my
entire family was sent to internment camps.

though it happened over 60 years ago, the recent climate towards
people of middle eastern decent is really not that much different than
how Japanese and Japanese Americans were treated during WWII.  How
easily we forget history...

Not to discredit American's of Japanese decent and their struggles and
mistreatment in a dark day in American history, and also not to troll...

But really some one should make a movie about the rape of Nanking. I
find it sad that a lot of younger people today are more aware of the
imprisoning of Americans of Japanese decent then the atrocities
committed by the Japanese army during WW2.

Same with the Abu Gahrab(sp?) prison scandals, In the future are people
going to only remember the negative things done by a few stupid soldiers
or are they going to remember all the people that got their heads cut
off with butter knives by the terrorists while screaming "god is great"?

Seriously, this is not a troll post. Just trying to converse and hear
viewpoints.

you know what, fuck you for making a connection between what happend
to Japanese Americans and what the Japanese military did in China.

that's right, fuck you.  it's that same attitude that made it possible
for Americans to think it was okay to throw 120,000 people behind
barbed wire fences because of their ethnic background.  not because of
crimes they committed.

fuck you.

of the 120,000 people interned, do you realize that over 2/3 were
American citizens?  citizens that should have been protected by
constitutional rights and our judicial system.  these were not
Japanese nationals.  these were people born and raised on US soil who
had never even been to Japan.

these were not the people that bombed Pearl Harbor.  these were not
the people that invaded China.

you are making some sort of weak connection between Japanese American
Internament and the actions of the Japanese military.  which is the
same thing that the US military and government and the people did
during WWII.

let's point the finger at the other guy and say "hey what they did was
worse."  and hey, we imprisoned 120,000 people without due process and
robbed them of their land and property but you know what.....some
people across the ocean who have slanty eyes like them and eat with
chopsticks like them, they did something worse.

fuck you.

you know what, fuck you for making a connection between what happend
to Japanese Americans and what the Japanese military did in China.

>WW2, I was just bringing up the point that it's insane that we

much bigger >mistakes have been made by others.

that's right, fuck you.  it's that same attitude that made it possible
for Americans to think it was okay to throw 120,000 people behind
barbed wire fences because of their ethnic background.  not because of
crimes they committed.

>No, I don't think so. The attitude that lead to the Americans of
Japanese >decent being put in prison was one of FEAR and the fact that
spying and >espionage was big in that time period.

fuck you.

>I will later when I'm at home.

of the 120,000 people interned, do you realize that over 2/3 were
American citizens? =20

>Duh, yeah and I'm also aware of the fact that the Americans of Japanese
decent immigrated a long time before WW2 into the United States. Most of
them even came before the Chinese.=20

citizens that should have been protected by
constitutional rights and our judicial system.  these were not
Japanese nationals.  these were people born and raised on US soil who
had never even been to Japan.

>um yep. Learned it in school in 5th grade and again in 9th grade.

these were not the people that bombed Pearl Harbor.  these were not
the people that invaded China.

>Duh.

you are making some sort of weak connection between Japanese American
Internament and the actions of the Japanese military.  which is the
same thing that the US military and government and the people did
during WWII.

>Nope.


let's point the finger at the other guy and say "hey what they did was
worse."  and hey, we imprisoned 120,000 people without due process and
robbed them of their land and property but you know what.....some
people across the ocean who have slanty eyes like them and eat with
chopsticks like them, they did something worse.

>not what I said. Come on, think a little more complex then that!

fuck you.

My major gripe with our country is the overwhelming amount of blind 
allegiance people give it. As if the USA could do no wrong. Nevermind that 
we robbed the Native American people's of the land they inhabited LONG 
before the white man ever showed up. Never mind all the slavery of African's 
and the resulting social caste system. Nevermind the internment of Japanese 
Americans, or the war in Iraq, or Vietnam, or the Iran-Contra scandal, or 
the fact that there are thousands of "alleged" terrorists hanging out in 
Guantanamo for supposedly having terrorist ties that no one can seem to 
prove. Fuck due process and the Constitution and the rights that come from 
it. We're the US of A! "god's" chosen people! right?

Sick and sad.

I think the point that's trying to come across here is that a sense of
rightousness fuels acts of indecency on fellow human beings.Wether in
the instance of the American, German, and Japanese govs during WW2,
the recent beheading-happy terrorists, or any of the other thousands
of sensless violent acts which have been commited on innocent people
during times of war, it just goes to show that people in power often
lose their sense of consciousness and humanitarian responsibility.
It's sad and upsetting, but nothing new. I mean, fuck. Look at the
crusades. Unjustified fear-based persecution all over. So sad....

America is far from perfect, but it's the best system of government to
ever come along IMO.

Also, I don't believe in holding people (Americans) responsible for
their ancestors mistakes (Natives, slavery, internment, ect.). There is
no such thing as being born into sin.=20

well, here's my point.  we can't control what the other guys do.  if
what other people do really pisses us off, we can just invade their
country.  however, we do have control over what we do in our own
country and what we do to our own citizens.  the issue of Japanese
Internment is an issue of civil rights.  was it okay for the US
government to deny American citizens of their civil rights based
solely on their ethnic background?

> >No, I don't think so. The attitude that lead to the Americans of

for the record, there was not ONE recorded case of spying nor
espionage by any Japanese Americans before or during the war.  people
of Japanese ancestry in American were viewed as disloyal foreigners
but there was absolutely no evidence of this.  no evidence, no cases
of espionage, but they looked like the enemy and therefore were
treated as such.

but still, you hear the words "WWII" and "Japanese" in a conversation
about the civil rights issues surrounding Japanese American Internment
and it reminds you that the Japanese military invaded China and killed
alot of Chinese people?  what's the connection?  are we talking war
crimes?  what the Japanese military did in China is a war crime.  what
the US government did to Japanese Americans is a legal issue of civil
rights and due process.  of course, this was prompted by the events of
WWII, but the issues affect all Americans regardless of ethnicty.

Executive Order 9066, which was used to enforce internment, did not
specifically single out people according to ethnic background.  it
gave the US military the right to remove any and all persons from any
region for whatever reason.

had the Korematsu case not been overturned, the original Korematsu vs.
United States would have still been on the books.   this is the
importance of the case as it applies to ALL Americans and people
living in America.  that you could be taken from your home and
imprisoned without trial and without evidence because the military
views you as a threat.

so here's my point.  the Rape of Nanking was a terrible atrocity.  and
you're right, there isn't much out there regarding that time period in
that region.  Iris Chang's "The Rape of Nanking" is probably the most
influential text on the subject but it wasn't published until the late
90s.  but that was something that was committed by a government other
than our own and was committed on soil other than our own.

Japanese American internment was committed by OUR government on OUR
soil and to OUR people

well, here's my point.  we can't control what the other guys do.  if
what other people do really pisses us off, we can just invade their
country.  however, we do have control over what we do in our own
country and what we do to our own citizens.  the issue of Japanese
Internment is an issue of civil rights.  was it okay for the US
government to deny American citizens of their civil rights based
solely on their ethnic background?

>>No and I agree with what you are saying.

> >No, I don't think so. The attitude that lead to the Americans of

for the record, there was not ONE recorded case of spying nor
espionage by any Japanese Americans before or during the war.  people
of Japanese ancestry in American were viewed as disloyal foreigners
but there was absolutely no evidence of this.  no evidence, no cases
of espionage, but they looked like the enemy and therefore were
treated as such.

>> Maybe not by Japanese American's, but by Japanese living in the US.
The fact is, Spying was a new concept in the times of WW2 and thus the
fear of it was huge, just like how we fear a dirty bomb here now.

but still, you hear the words "WWII" and "Japanese" in a conversation
about the civil rights issues surrounding Japanese American Internment
and it reminds you that the Japanese military invaded China and killed
alot of Chinese people?  what's the connection?  are we talking war
crimes?  what the Japanese military did in China is a war crime.  what
the US government did to Japanese Americans is a legal issue of civil
rights and due process.  of course, this was prompted by the events of
WWII, but the issues affect all Americans regardless of ethnicty.

>> Ok, true, but I was trying to make the point that we seem to
concentrate on the wrong things.

Executive Order 9066, which was used to enforce internment, did not
specifically single out people according to ethnic background.  it
gave the US military the right to remove any and all persons from any
region for whatever reason.

had the Korematsu case not been overturned, the original Korematsu vs.
United States would have still been on the books.   this is the
importance of the case as it applies to ALL Americans and people
living in America.  that you could be taken from your home and
imprisoned without trial and without evidence because the military
views you as a threat.

so here's my point.  the Rape of Nanking was a terrible atrocity.  and
you're right, there isn't much out there regarding that time period in
that region.  Iris Chang's "The Rape of Nanking" is probably the most
influential text on the subject but it wasn't published until the late
90s.  but that was something that was committed by a government other
than our own and was committed on soil other than our own.

Japanese American internment was committed by OUR government on OUR
soil and to OUR people

>> Very true, and thanks for giving me that viewpoint, I hope you can
consider mine.

Subject: [sfraves] Suggestions on good place for pop-house music

I work with a bunch of interns from Germany and they want to go party at
a club. They are really into house music (like Daft punk pop style). Can
anyone suggest a good club? I had them go to 1015 last weekend and it
sucked for them because they complained that it was an "asian" club.
They want a straight up party place where they can drink and get crazy.

Also, any suggestions on VIP or guestlist tickets would be appreciated!

BTW - What happened to JC? He was my VIP hookup!

Thanks,
Steve Osteen

actually, this is also untrue and has been widely referred to as an
arguement against the military neccesity of internment.

http://www.pbs.org/childofcamp/history/
"At the time, Executive Order 9066 was justified as a "military
necessity" to protect against domestic espionage and sabotage.
However, it was later documented that "our government had in its
possession proof that not one Japanese American, citizen or not, had
engaged in espionage, not one had committed any act of sabotage."
(Michi Weglyn, 1976)."


> >> Ok, true, but I was trying to make the point that we seem to
> concentrate on the wrong things.

i would still disagree that concentrating on acts by our own
government in which citizens are robbed of their civil rights is
wrong.  even in comparison with immoral or violent acts committed by
other nations in other countries.

in the case of internment, it wasn't just a handful of people.  not a
group of individuals.  it was EVERYONE in the western united states
who was of a certain ethnicity.  they were uprooted at a moments
notice.  could only take what they could carry.  they lost property
and their livelyhoods.  there were first forced to live in horse
stables while the camps were being built.  then forced into camps
behind barbed wire in some of the least hospitable regions of our
country.

> >> Very true, and thanks for giving me that viewpoint, I hope you can
> consider mine.

and i think i understand your  viewpoint.  but i still will stand by
my perspective that we, as a nation, should hold ourselves to the
highest standards of our own laws if we are to continue to say that we
are a free nation and try to enforce our own moral and ethic code to
other nations.

otherwise we are hypocrits and have no base for expecting other
sovereign nations to respect us.

Ok this isnt to be taken badly or derogatory or anything ok?  I just
thought i'd toss it out, my ex girlfriend always referred to Japanese
American's (Herself included) as Cracker Japs and  It's always kinda
stuck with me, cause it's kinda cleaver and witty with a lil fun
poking , but i wanted to see how the rest of you felt about that?  Do
you feel that's just a cute coin phrase or do you feel it's more of a
derogatory term?  I've always felt it was the prior rather then the
latter, but i can see how people can see it that way,  I never thought
it was that bad since she was Japanese/American and she called it
herself, but then again i guess a lot of black people call themselves
niggers (among themselves in conversation or like in Rap music where
it's out there for the masses), but if someone else were to say it
they would be looked down upon.

Feel free to give your insight, flame, poo throwing...whatever I can
take it.  Just wanted to see what others thought, since so far as i've
found i havent come across anyone else who had ever heard or used that
term before.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR: Remembering Japanese American Civil Rights Pioneer Fred Korematsu

no, it's derogatory but not in the way i think most people would interpret it.

i would say that Japanese Americans that experienced internment and
the generations after them ahd some seriously complicted and fucked up
issues.  let's take a second generation JA born in the US but before
internment:

you grow up with your parents who speak Japanese and tell you good
stories of thier past in Japan.  you eat Japanese food at home and
practice some of the cultural customs.  but outside of your home
everything is American.  you grew up speaking English and go to school
with kids of all ethnic backgrounds.  you're just one of the
guys/girls.  you love America and recite the pledge of allegiance
everyday.  you learn about freedom and how great America is.

then war breaks out.  the country your parents were raised in has
attacked the country that you were raised in.  then the country you
were raised in tells you that you'rea a threat to national security
because of what was done by a country that you've never been to, and
yet have a cultural connection to.  people on the street call you a
"dirty Jap" and spit on you.  your friends and neighbors who used to
welcome you into their homes now look at your with spite and say
"you're not an american."

then you get taken from your home and get dropped at a race track
where you live in a horse stable.  the smell of shit surrounds you. 
your once proud parents don't talk anymore and don't smile.   you bath
and wash your clothes in a trough meant for animals.  then you get
trucked off into the desert.  you're surrounded by barbed wire.  some
people say it's for "your own protection" but the machine guns in the
towers point inward, not outward.

years go by and the war is over and you can go back home.  but you
don't want to go back home cause you've got nothing left there.  you
don't want to indentify with anything Japanese cause that's what got
you locked up in the first place.  but your parents still speak
japanese and eat japanese food at home.  so you disassociate yourself
from them.  you go off and try to be as american as possible, but you
can't deny the fact that you have some fond memories of the customs
that you were raised with.

you grow up and get married.  maybe to another JA, maybe not.  you
have kids.  what do you teach your kids?  about the fact that the
country you are trying to teach them is best in the world locked you
and grandpa and grandma up for being japanese?

doh, meeting time at work.  yeah, i'm supposed to be working.

more on this later.  or not.  isn't this a rave list?

Yea, it's much better to pretend none of that shit (that still affects our 
country BTW) never happened. That's a healthy American solution. While

As some of you may have heard, Google has a mapping service available in 
Beta.  One can view both a map and directions to a location as well as a 
satellite view (look on the upper right hand side of the map and click on 
"satellite."

I thought it might be cool if we exchanged satellite views of our homes.


Here's a link to the map and satellite picture of where I 
live:  http://maps.google.com/maps?q=1496+La+Playa+Street,San+Francisco

Yes, I sympathize Bam.  I'm a Polish American (PA) and when I moved to SF 
in the eighties I thought I was the only PA in the City, let alone the 
"nightlife" scene.  Then I  met Andy W :-)  But that was after living here 
over as a lonely Pole for over a decade.  Takes time.

I'm going to go eat some kiska...by myself.  Andy doesn't eat it anymore :-(

Love,

Please re-read my e-mail and then reconsider your comments and how they
don't relate to what I said.

Van, just because your great, great, grandpa killed 200 mexicans, should
you be responsible today for his mistakes?

Yea, it's much better to pretend none of that shit (that still affects

Yeah, I sympathize too. I grew up in East San Jose and was a minority
being white (I look it, though I'm not) at my High School.

BTW - Asians were the majority followed by Latinos.

Yes, I sympathize Bam.  I'm a Polish American (PA) and when I moved to
SF=20
in the eighties I thought I was the only PA in the City, let alone the=20
"nightlife" scene.  Then I  met Andy W :-)  But that was after living
here=20
over as a lonely Pole for over a decade.  Takes time.

I'm going to go eat some kiska...by myself.  Andy doesn't eat it anymore
:-(

i know you were responding to Marco, but for clarification....

Internment happened about 60 years ago.  People that were interned are
still alive.

We're not talking about great, great, grandparents.  We're talking
about our parents.

Actually, my great great Grandpa was still in Sicily, probably helping 
extort his fellow Sicilians in one way or another, lol - so, I don't feel 
responsible for any of it. But as an AMERICAN, I think that if we're gonna 
pimp like "the greatest country in the world" we ought to not be shitheads, 
and never forget the mistakes of our past. Knowing your roots is NOT a bad 
thing. Learning from those mistakes is not bad either.

Obviously we should never forget our mistakes of the past. Again, what I
said had nothing to do with that.

Pioneer Fred Korem

Actually, my great great Grandpa was still in Sicily, probably helping=20
extort his fellow Sicilians in one way or another, lol - so, I don't
feel=20
responsible for any of it. But as an AMERICAN, I think that if we're
gonna=20
pimp like "the greatest country in the world" we ought to not be
shitheads,=20
and never forget the mistakes of our past. Knowing your roots is NOT a
bad=20
thing. Learning from those mistakes is not bad either.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR: Remembering Japanese American Civil Rights Pioneer Fred Korematsu

I ran into a good-sized cluster of Japanese ravers at Little SciFi.  I 
spotted a couple of them again at Bubblegum SciFi, but it was too damn 
crowded to make it over and say hi (WAY overcrowded...  First time I 
ever actually left a Skills party significantly early, it was so 
crowded.  Probably the last time I'm gonna set foot in the Blue Cube, 
for the same reason.).

So far as the rest of the thread goes, I'm with you 100%.  I'm gonna 
refrain from throwing in any further, as I'll just wind up launching 
into a long bitchy rant about how extra-double-super-loathsome certain 
people are, for trying to blame the present generation of Japanese for 
the tragedies brought about by some old, mostly dead now, Japanese 
soldiers during WWII.  And no one wants to read that, I'm sure.

I mean... for fucks sake...  I'm half Italian, on my father's side.  
And I have (non-living) relatives who fought in the Italian army during 
WWII.  Yes, on the same side as HITLER  (Oooooo...).  Does that make ME 
a fascist?  Does that make ME responsible for Auschwitz?  Not a chance. 
  So for anyone to bring up nanking with today's generation of Japanese 
is just totally and entirely despicable, and would seem, to me, to 
indicate a latent (or not-so-latent) racism.

I am pretty disappointed with the resolution.  There are sites elsewhere
on the 'net that are a lot better.

Still, its cool to switch between graphic map and real image when they
are the same orientation.

Subject: [sfraves] (nrr) Quote of the Day (Thu)

i just got done reading philip k. dick's "lies, inc.".  this is an interesting
book, because it was originally written in the 1960's and published as "the
unteleported man".

dick wrote and wanted to publish an expansion of the book at the time, but the
publisher didn't like the expansion.  then in the late 70's, he found another
publisher to agree to publish the book with the expansion.  the only problem
was he couldn't find 4 pages of the original book so he rewrote the beginning
and ending to make it all fit together.  then he died in 1982, and the person
managing his writings found the 4 pages and published the book, with the
expansion, under the new name "lies, inc."  that dick intended.

the book without the expansion is very much like a twilight zone episode.  the
expansion is very abstract and psychedelic.  i can see why the publisher would
have thought it too weird but it does add to the story.

and finally, after about 6 different people told me i should, i'm reading snow
crash.  very funny and outlandish adventure book.  what are you reading?  let
me or us know!

probably why she loved me but that one day I might disgust her for the very
same reason.

Finished "Brass" recently.  If you like Irving Welsh (Trainspotting, ect..)
you should like Brass.  Total smut though... about 7 sex encounters as
graphic as anything you would read on the internet.  Not just sex.. but dirty
dirrrrty sex.  We yanks just can't get enough of those clubbing, drugging, 
shagging british youth.  Only thing, though... I could not quite get the
girl's modivation for her reckless sex cravings.  Almost like the sex
scenes were pasted in over the story to help sell books.  Worked for
a sucker like me, though.

I found "Plan of Attack" facinating becuase I was really following the
news with the buildup to the Iraq war.  This book takes you behind the
scenes to see what was really happening behind the headlines.  I really 
loved the description of the CIA infiltrating northern Iraq.  A team of 
8 CIA and special forces guys driving into Iraq on bumpy trails in just 2
trucks... with 18 million dollars in $100 bills for payoffs.  You can
see why both pro- and anti- war people like this book.. it actually 
softened my hatred of Bush.  The real person to blame for the Iraq mess?
Rumsfeld.  

Currently reading "Cloud Atlas".  Seven seperate stories linked together
in a mysterious way.  Great writing.. but you have to be able to re-enage
with those 7 different stories and sets of characters.  Very interesting.
I have a friend who is totally fanatical about this book, and he can't
wait for me to finish so he can have someone to discuss it with. 

Phillip K. Dick is always a fun read.  His whole worldview is that reality
is never solid.. but constanty shifting and flipping around and inversing.
My favorite is "Flow My Tears, The Policeman Said".  Not as far-out as
his stuff like Valis.

Finally a thread i can floss my mind with.....thanks Deepfog!

i'm reading "love in the time of cholera" -gabriel gacia marquez
it starts off as a romantic piece and then goes into sexual liberation. 
this was written sometime ago so it's like a melrose place episode as far
as being risque.  unlike melrose place, it is brilliantly written.  i am
enjoying it immensely.

Open Turntables and DJ Performances at SF Giants game this Saturday
http://www.iamthedj.com/news/

I will be on the field (on the field!) at SBC Park before the game with
two young norcalDJMPA alumni who will be spinning a short set for the
crowd of 40,000 before the San Francisco Giants face the Colorado Rockies
this Saturday.

norcalDJMPA will be hosting open turntables in front of the park in Willie
Mays Plaza from 11am - 1pm, and up in the Coca-Cola Fan Lot during the
game, too. You would be nuts to miss this. DJs invade SBC park this
Saturday. Get tickets now!

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR: Satellite picture of where I live

Here's another cool one that's been making the rounds:

Black Rock City (site of Burning Man)
http://maps.google.com/maps?q=gerlach,NV&ll=40.759277,-119.236679&spn=0.042229,0.070467&t=k&hl=en

http://redirx.com/?37rs

The satellite pic was taken days before it was about to begin 
(8-18-2003), so you can make out the layout, and camps starting to setup, 
and you can _almost_ make out a teeny tiny 'Man".

ha haaa, I used to live right next door ;)  that place was super scary
well at the 11000 empire grade area
when you go up to the gates there are signs and shit that say "no 
photography" and all sorts of weird shit...
always gave me the heeebeee jeeebbees

"What I am against is quotas. I am against hard quotas, quotas they 
basically delineate based upon whatever. However they delineate, quotas, I 
think, vulcanize society. So I don't know how that fits into what everybody 
else is saying, their relative positions, but that's my position." George W. 
Bush (our president)

>Who do I need to hook up with? I've got the raver heart, so let me

Who do you need to hook up with?  You need to hook up with me, so I
can pimp you out and get you to know all the "right" people.  No need
for you to spread the love, we can find other things to spread that
will bring a lot more joy.  I like that idea you had with the
CD-Player, i'm sure we can have a lot of fun with that, probably bring
in some good cash flow too.

Why do people always gotta post, how do i promote?  I dont get it.  Is
it really that hard to figure out.  I mean shit when i first started
partying back in the early/mid 90's i figured it out.  It's not that
hard to go to the DJ, who more often then not will know whos' throwing
the party (unless it's keoki and he's too fucked up to remember his
own name) and ask...hey i wanna help promote, are you part of this
crew or know who it?  Or how about the person working door?  or one of
the people working *cough*security*cough*.  It's not that hard to
notice the people behind all the action, unless your an E'd out candy
kid, with enough chemicals in your blood to kill a horse, and still
i've been there and i can still tell who's behind the party.  Sure
asking a public forum like this could get your pointed in about 30
differant directions, but why not take the initiative yourself and ask
around at the party your at.  You are obviously at that party cause
you like some element of it, and therefor asking around there, will
get you better leads, rather then getting 30 leads here that could
point you in directions you dont really care for (like promoting
gabber parties or something *bleh*) you could ask around at that party
and get leads that would point you in a similar direction as that
party.

For me the easiest way was to stick it out till the end of the party,
after everyone's gone home.  The few people remaining are generally
going to be the people throwing that party and then you can have a
chance to talk to them one on one without loud pounding music going on
in the background or stupid raver kids asking you if your want a god
damn sucky ass light show.  Offer to help clean up and talk about what
other things you can do to help out.  It shows you get some motivation
to be part of a crew.

All in all take initiative, walk around, ask around, putting out a
broad post on a public forum isnt the way to go, it's like getting a
tutor and having them do your homework for you, you get it done and
you get good grades, but are you really learning anything?

Can someone please write a script that will Osby-ize any text?

Then we can apply it to all sfraves email for a week.

That would be so cool.

Well that's your problem- you don't sit on the CD player, you sit on the  
speaker-
Get yourself a nice, suitable-shaped bandpass box (SAS Bazooka tubes work  
well here)- then just send a 33hz tone through it-
Put a little ampmod on it to make it pulse nicely, and there ya go...
Be careful you get the frequency right- 33hz vibrations will make most  
women have a spontaneous orgasm, but 13hz will make you instantly shit  
yourself.
Unless you're in to that of course :P

"Hypocritical Hip Hop"
By NerCity (3-16-05)

"I don't like these new rappers"
"They aint talking about shit"
"All they do is degrade women and talk about money"
"What happened to REAL MC'S!!!????!"
SHUT UP!!!!
Old School hip hop heads
Got all 'Booshy'
Forgot where they came from.
Acting like Ice Cube's alias wasn't "Bitch Killer"
Like Chuck D
And PE
Wasn't hanging out with gun totting criminals
Called the 9-8 posse
Holding gats
Are you really trying to tell me
That all old school hip hop
Was block parties and pro-black???
Man 'figa-figa-figa' fuck that..
The first rule about hip hop is "KEEPING IT REAL"
And real is
For every time Jay-Z rhymed about Maibach
EPMD talked about Benze with "Ground effect kits"
In days way back.
Hell EPMD stood for
two dudes "Making Dollars"
No different than a crew called "Cash Money"
Rap recycles itself
Like Daytons and Trues and Vogues
Now being replaced by Spinners dipped in chrome
Before I heard KRS-1 talk about self destruction
He told me that
"Roxanne Shawntee was only good for steady @#%$"
Basically calling a Queen from Queensbridge a Ho.
Hell "Bitch Better Have My Money"
And "Jeneane The Dick Fiend'
By AMG
Disrespected more women
Then any song from
50, Buck, or Tony Yayo. ...
You Hip Hop Hypocrites....!!!
Acting all high and mighty
judging these new school kids
And their music...
Women who got upset and wanted to boycott
Nelly when credit cards were slid down the ass of Groupies
were the same women that replied
In the early 90's when Treach asked them
If they were "Down with OPP?"
Come on man..stop fronting
It's just me.
Don't get booshy.
Acting like NWA
stands for "Nubians With Agendas"
You're laughing..
But if you're around my age..you're fronting
For every Poor Righteous Teachers
There was a Too Short
"BIIIOTCH" bumping in your speakers
There was
DJ Run
Keeping a bag of cheeba inside his locker.
Before Hey Young World
Or Children's Story score
Rick the Ruler said
"The Bitch Been Around Before My Mother's Born"
Face it..
Bitch and ho lyrics aren't new...
Hip Hop has always embraced it.
Talked about guns,
drugs, money and material things
Three fingered rings
To bling bling
 From Sugar Hill
Cypress Hill or Lauryn Hill
Digital Underground's Sex Packets
Were ecstasy pills
Way before Em talked about Purple Hills
Come on man.
You're breaking rule number 1 of Hip Hop
"Keep IT REAL!"
Or maybe we should just keep it right.
And make all MC's accountable for what they write.
Understand that our MC's
Opened the door for 1000's of MC's
And even though we feel a few of them
are some 'Sucka MC's" They're still MC's...
MC Brains or Chingy
The people who say they hate rappers who sing a lot
Know they bump "Friends" by Whodini
Or Biz Markie
Stop being hip hop hypocrites
If you don't like the way Rap music is now a days.
Shut up
Shut off the radio and video
Leave the mainstream garbage alone
dig up your roots
and dig out some Roots and stop being "Clones"
And PLEASE....stop complaining
Hip Hop is fine.
The same people who complain about it
Are the same people who only download it online
Don't support the art.
Don't go to Talib or Common concerts.
Hip Hop is fine.
Radio has always sucked!!!
So if you're tired of how Hip Hop sounds
go back to where you first heard it.....
come with me...
It's underground.

Subject: [sfraves] (nrr) Quote of the Day (Fri)

thought i was going to forget, eh?  actually, the internet was down (or so
annoyingly slow it might as well have *been* down) so i had to wait.

i was going to make friday a star trek quote of the day.  yes, i still like star
trek.  i know i don't talk about it as much these days and i know that you wish
i would.  well everything needs a rest now and then.  back when i was at UCSC
there were these surfer dudes from dana point in my dorm.  well guess what they
liked to do?  yep, you guessed it.  i had to climb up on the upper bunk in order
to use this contraption they had.  anyway, one of them told me all i ever talked
about was star trek and raves.  now i just don't talk much unless there's
something really new and interesting.

and speaking of new and interesting, why not dig up an old quote of the day from
one of my favorite old time authors, robert anton wilson.  you know, the nice
thing about things we like is they never really get old.  sometimes you have to
take a break from them but just like a boomerang, they always come back to you.

happy friday!

William James, father of American psychology, tells of meeting an old lady who
told him the Earth rested on the back of a huge turtle.

"But my dear lady," Professor James asked, as politely as possible, "what holds
up the turtle?"

"Ah," she said.  "that's easy.  He is standing on the back of another turtle."

"Oh, I see," said Professor James, still being polite.  "But would you be so
good as to tell me what holds up the second turtle?"

"It's no use, Professor," said the old lady, realizing he was trying to lead her
into a logical trap.  "It's turtles-turtles-turtles, all the way!"

- Robert Anton Wilson, excerpt from "Promethius Rising"

osby --

i must have missed this email ... i've been doing mass dumps to my 
saved box on webmail.  it's kind of a pain in the endup, but whatever 
works, works, right?

right now i'm regurgitating all my webmail back down to my laptop.  i'm 
at an internet cafe in malta.  when i came to san francisco last month, 
i was pleased to see more coffee shops having wifi, but this cafe i'm 
at here blows them all away.  they serve alcohol and let you play pool 
and order food all in sort of a big multiplex internet cafe.  it also 
connects to a bed and breakfast.  and internet is $3 per hour.  not 
bad.

what else could you possibly want?

see you all monday ... quote of the day

hold on a minute, is this bullshit or real?

if it were true then it would be technically possible to install in
your car a seat capable of automatically generating spontaneous
orgasms for female passengers.

think of the time you would save!

especially if you had a camper.

No bullshit- I believe it was Tesla who fist discovered the "vibrating  
shit table"...
IIRC he would invite guests in to his house and tell them to sit on the  
"relaxation platform", then await their reaction.
My kinda guy...

As for the in-seat attention-getting action, there are several companies  
that make transducers that are made simply to vibrate, and not produce  
sound (though they operate just like loudspeakers)-
Yeah sure, I guess I could be fiddling with knobs on the dash while my  
female companion is enjoying the ride in her seat, but hahah those aren't  
the buttons I want to be pushing you know?

soooo, after waay too much of debauchery  at the End Up dancing to David 
Marales (sp) and checking out my next ex boyfriends, I decided that I would 
still hit up the Giants game, wonderful day for a ball game :)  then work 
after that...tried to meet up with a friend and then met up with my friends 
Layla (bitch is making my couch smell all funny at the moment) Matt 
Sinclair, Ivan the Terrible and Mr Clay from San jose  I call them and they 
are all "we are out at this party out kinda of in portrero hill area by the 
water"
hmmm....was I going to go out and get in more trouble?
Duh  ;)

You guys remember the old renegade parties where there were about 100 peeps 
max and the music was just OFF THE HOOK?
well, this was that
Fucking amazing, gorgeous party.  I have  no idea who threw it, but mad 
probs if you are sailing in on SFR.  Thecrowd was wonderfully mixed, Music 
was INSANE AND MINDBLOWING, everybody was dancing and so friendly!
OH MY GOD
Who threw this party?  does anyone know?
it was like going back in time,  the vibe even made me want to do dirty 
things to great people:) that has not been done for a long time...so the 
change happenned, I danced my ass of as usual. and met the greatest folks, 
laughed, took pics, and just talked to newbies and others
good times good times...
See you at  Sunet   party everyone!!!!

wtf man???  you were there?  why is it that we've been at 2 of the
same parties in the last month and not seen each other?  did you grow
a beard?  dreadlocks?  are you wearing disguises these days?

anyhow, that party was INSANELY fun and the group that throws them is
called Down Low productions.  basically, a bunch of breaks
afficionados with ties to the burningman and underground breaks scene
in sf.  good people and this is the 3rd party that they've thrown.

expect more this summer!  i had so much fun last night, i don't know

Subject: RE: [sfraves] Miss Kitten at Mezzanine 4.30.05___ FREE

Doing some Googling, this show appears to be $20.

So, is it free? Did someone royally screw the pooch when they emailed you 
that???

Cuz, for free, I am so there, but I don't ever pay $20 unless the party 
lineup is choc-full-o DJ's.

Anyone? Bueller?

Grrrr...the guest account has been suspended so I can't see the pics, 
but it was great to see so many faces yesterday that I hadn't seen in 
days. Had a fantastic time, the only shitty part being when the cops 
wouldn't let us spin fire. I know that I did a few burns there last 
year, so I was bummed that they were talking about lack of permits. 
Overall, it was amazing to see so many beautiful people dancing and 
being in community under the warm spring sun. Big ups to the the SF scene.

Happy

Subject: RE: [sfraves] Miss Kitten at Mezzanine 4.30.05___ FREE

I hear she's good live, but I don't think many people are worth $20 on their 
own. Maybe that's just me...

Yeah. I like it even better than Perrier: it's called Gerolsteiner, and 
drinking it during and/or after a heavy night of drinking the hard 
stuff absolutely prevents the nasties the next ayem!

Subject: RE: [sfraves] smartest dance floor on earth

When we did sound for Sound Asylum (5 i think) Denise brought in one
of those dance floors.  It was pretty cool.  You could setup little
games on it like dodge the bouncing ball and pong.  We had a lot of
fun on it at the beginning of the party before people started packing
in.  For a while people didnt seem to want to dance on it, but once we
got a few people going it was all over from there.  It had some cool
effects on it.  But it's freakin expensive as hell.  the guy who set
it up said he's done a few clubs where they had the entire dancefloor
made of that stuff, but for this party it was only like a 10'x10'
square.  i got video of it at home still i think.

that's cool. this one was built by hand by a group of engineering
students at MIT. I think probably you're thinking of another kind of
light-up floor. granted, all light-up floors are cool, but this one
you can manipulate in real-time using pthreads and Matlab.

Hmmm could be another floor, but this one you could manipulate real
time as well via some software GUI is had running on a computer behind
the decks, and you could even synch it to the music.

sorry, I don't understand at all. what other buttons are worth pushing?

I wasn't picturing a set of knobs to fiddle with on the dash so much
as a more Nicola Tesla meets "The Fast And The Furious" situation,
really. like a sort of, "bitch, get in, sit down, shut up, cream your
fucking panties" sort of thing. if the orgasm-inducing frequency can
be predicted dependably for the majority of women then you just set
the machine to that frequency in the hardware. why would you ever
twiddle the knob? there's no other frequency to set it to. the only
necessary control is an "on" button.

(btw gmail has this weird habit of hiding my sent messages so I only
found your reply today, that might be the reason for the confusion
here.)

anyway, you're thinking too small. it's not a toy to entertain
somebody who would already be having sex with you anyway. it's a
button you push that allows you to give an orgasm to any woman who
gets in your car. this frees you from the requirement of even being
able to speak the woman's language. imagine if you were a limo driver.
you're driving a gorgeous woman from Italy. you don't speak Italian.
she doesn't speak English. you push the button. what happens?

if what you're describing is a bona fide universal
female-orgasm-generating technology, then it's true -- Tesla really
was a genius.

Imagine a floor like that in a square room covering the entire floor
with 4 projectors set up so that each wall has some winamp visual (R4 is
my favorite) running at a high resolution covering the entire walls.
Then add a few dozen lasers and a little fog. Maybe do a moon and some
stars on the ceiling with planetarium like changing color horizon
lighting (to simulate different time changes).

Came across this last night ... www.419eaters.com
 
Anyone ever participated in baiting or any types of these vigilante-good samaritan efforts?  I thought it was hilarious.  In the forums, they post links to empeethreees of the conversations they have had with the crazy crazy nigerian scammers.
 
Thoughts/ideas? I think I have a new hobby ima start practising on. :)
 
Good Times

yes, and keep topping it, because it's not about having fun creating
things that didn't exist before, oh no, it's about primitive tribal

MY light-up floor had 8.47 surround sound DVD audio and A LASER BEAM!!!!!!!!!!

Yeah..  When Derrick Carter and Mark Farina co-head a bill and charge
$20, it's tough to slap down a twomp just for one dj, no matter how
cool.

To me, I will only pay that kind of money for a party with lots of
people I want to see, or for a really complex, awesome live PA artist. 
(they work a lot harder than most djs- writing tracks, carrying and
setting up gear, etc.  their fees should reflect that.)

cheers,

Well, a drum circle could possibly be just as much fun and probably much
more of a religious experience.

Personally I enjoy creating things though...

yes, and keep topping it, because it's not about having fun creating
things that didn't exist before, oh no, it's about primitive tribal
status games.

MY light-up floor had 8.47 surround sound DVD audio and A LASER
BEAM!!!!!!!!!!

so NYEAH. :-p

Mmmmm I can think of several off the top of my head that could use some  
attention...
It's a metaphor, you'll understand someday my son.

No, Tesla discovered the shit-yourself frequency, I don't remember who  
discovered the other one.

Subject: [sfraves] Red Jerry and chillout rooms


Anyone familiar with the album (Deep and Chilled Euphoria, Mixed by Red
Jerry)? Ever been in a chillout room with it playing?

Anyone want to share any awesome ambient experiences? Any good chillout
room memories?

Somehow I've managed to connect to the music in this album on a
spiritual level. The songs move me in a way that can't be explained in
words.

Maybe it was the 5-meo-mipt?
Maybe it was the MDMA?
Maybe it was all those nights in the dark on DXM?

Maybe they are just damn great songs.

As I move farther and farther away from daily drug usage I've found my
mind is going a little insane. Or maybe I forgot what being normal is.

Steve

Grace's chics hatch!!!

In the quiet of darkness between the evening of April 11, and the early 
morning hours of April 12, the first eyas of the 2005 season hatched!  Then 
the second eyas hatched shortly before 7AM PDT on camera the morning of 
April 12!  Not wanting to miss out...at 2:25PM PDT eyas number 3 made its 
entrance into the world!  This has been a very busy day indeed!  When 
peregrines are young, they require near-constant brooding by the adults to 
keep warm, so when the chicks are not being fed, the adults will appear 
much as if they are incubating, making the chicks difficult to see the 
first few days after hatching.  One egg now remains in the nest box...

ok, this is a brand-new discovery for me but not actually a brand-new
discovery for the world.

so!

if you've seen it my bad.

if not -- there's been some discussion about the commercial viability
of niche artforms on this list, for obvious reasons.

and here is one possible answer to all those questions:

Bassbin twins were out here 2 weeks ago. I listened to audio of the

That's seriously gotta be a joke.

BTW, where in the bible does it say you cannot drink? I know it says
you shouldn't drink to the point of stupid intoxication, but it never
says once, "Don't drink alcohol"

fuck yeah, she's worth paying $20 to see!  i am SO
psyched she's coming back.  i heard her last year at
mezzanine, and it was the best dj set i heard all
year, hands down!  (and it was a busy year for me, as
i went to both movement in detroit AND sonar and heard
some amazing stuff.)  anyway, i think she rocks.  i
hope she's as good as the last time i saw her.   plus,
it's the eve of beltane/may day, the pagan festival of
spring, one of the best party nights of the year,
imho.  i am giddy.  i may be more giddy about seeing

the howard stern movie--Private Parts--is actually pretty good. i gained a lot of respect for him--or wound up liking him at least. he's talking about the scene in which a caller is hot for howard so he has her straddle her speaker as he hums into his microphone. pretty hot ;-)

bhr & sfr --

well my friend anton met a local young maltese couple and they showed us a
little bit around the city last night in the old part up on top of a hill where
it's sort of like an old christian fort from perhaps the 1500's.  after we went
and had an egg burger (that's a burger with an egg on top) at a local
restaurant.  i mean, they had burger king and mcdonald's here but i can eat
that stuff any time.  in fact, they probably have that stuff on the moon too!

just when i was thinking the other day that most of the really really old school
sfr celebrities either are no longer on the list or perhaps are full-time
lurkers, will penna i guess is back on sfraves!  give him a warm welcome.  most
of the people on the list actively posting today are people that joined from
about 1995 and on.  there's a lot of people that used to post from 1992.

anyway, will and the rest of the old school santa cruz collective still keep
things alive down there, and i really appreciate that when i come home to
visit.  if you've never been down there tracy and carlos i believe spin quite a
bit down there.  check it out!

Personally, I'm part of two crews... DTS (disturbing the scene) Collective 
(dtscollective.org) and Nocturnalism Entertainment 
(http://www.nocturnalismentertainment.com).  I think there are literally 
hundreds of crews around the bay though.  Some are obviously more well known 
than others.

Are you speaking about crews past & present, or only those currently
active?

There are plenty of dormant crews that deserve mention in the history
books, and few current crews of much import.

Element Fridays presents...



SASHA - RENAISSANCE THE MIX COLLECTION: 10th ANNIVERSARY EDITION - www.djsasha.com | The Collective | UK

There are DJs who turn up, play records and make people dance. And there are producers who make the dancefloor-igniting records those DJs will kill for. There are very few people in dance music who can do both and Sasha is the leader of the pack. Ever since he rode in on a tidal wave of adoration from the North of England's explosive early 90s club scene, that magic touch has made Alexander Coe one of the most famous, most revered DJ on the planet.

It's because of what he can do with music - the way he can make good records sound better, great records sound awesome, and everything he plays into his own. The way his mixes take elements from across the spectrum of electronic dance, from trance, breaks, progressive and deep house, and create a languidly hypnotic liquid groove. The way his understanding of both melody and momentum can tease, taunt, and en-trance a dancefloor before unleashing a record that will have people not just leaping up and down but bursting with emotion. The best DJs know that Djing is first about being able to read people and then about being able to tap into that human experience and take it on a journey. Sasha has always been noted for being a master at this and it is this universal appeal that he has tapped into that has established his strong fanbase around the globe.

Do not be mistaken, this kind of recognition does not happen overnight. Born and raised in a small town in Wales, Sasha was exposed to Motown records when he was just a baby and it was in the home that his talent for playing the piano was developed. His stepmother forced him to take lessons. At the time, he hated them, but after his first studio session - and this is typical Sasha - he phoned her to say thank you. His first exposure to house music was at Manchester's Hacienda; just as dance music exploded into the summer of love. One visit and the young pony-tailed Sasha was hooked. "The smoke machine, the strobe lights, everyone trance dancing, wearing bandanas and smiley T-shirts," he smiles now. "It definitely had a fuck-you attitude compared to the rest of pop music." This impact encouraged his move from Wales to Manchester. His first exploration into Djing was when a DJ in a local pub announced he was looking for people to play club dates. Sasha volunteered and now says that he
 'had about 30 records and basically just blagged it'.

After honing his deck technique, Sasha's first big break came when he was offered a residency at Stokes legendary club Shelly's. When all the other DJ's were playing US House, Sasha's style was much more uplifting, and he encapsulated clubbers with his mixture of piano led Italian House whilst playing acapella tracks over the top. This combination alongside a wide variety of anthems kept dancefloors full and elevated Sasha to hero status. And, lets not forget, in a world where the DJ had too often been bespectacled nerds, here the headline DJ had the looks and charm to match his growing following. In classic rock n' roll style, here was a star that boys wanted to hang out with and girls wanted to get just that little more bit close to.

Shelly's was the launch pad for the residency at Renaissance, where Sasha created his niche and helped forge a new style in UK house music. At Renaissance two major things happened; Sasha mixed the first ever UK DJ mix album and he met John Digweed which cemented the partnership known as 'Northern Exposure'. Sasha and John have played together on five continents, have mixed 3 'Northern Exposure' albums which have sold to over 1 million people worldwide. This special brother like relationship that Sasha and Digweed have on the decks, is what landed them the monthly residency at New York's "Twilo", following in the footsteps of Vasquez and Tenaglia.

The first DJ cover star - on Mixmag in early 1991 - the still shy DJ was freaked. "I was so used to going to places and just hanging out. Suddenly there was a stream of people coming up," he recalls. "Of course it's bound to happen. You go to Liverpool and you're the first 'pin-up' DJ and you're going to get shit. Frankly, It still weirds me out." Today he still remains shy at heart. "I'm not very good in social situations where I'm put on the spot," he says. "Like meeting new people, small talk. Just never been good with that." It's this contradiction - the coyness that Alexander Coe has when it comes to being Sasha, that's at the core of the Sasha myth.

Although Sasha has clearly reached a celebrity status, it's his generous personality, his love for his peers and of course his completely candid humour that has enabled him to maintain such a likeable high profile in the often-fickle world of club culture. Sasha has gone from DJ to superstar status in America, where 'Sarsha' is a household name for many teenagers - a gruelling three month tour took their sound further out into deepest America, preaching a gospel of repetitive beats and imaginative mixing from coast to coast, and right through the mid western heartland of the States. A punishing gig-a-night schedule that must make nights like the opening of Space in Ibiza in June seem like a holiday by comparison.

There followed a move back into releasing his own music, collaborating with the former Underworld mainstay, DJ Darren Emerson on 'Scorchio'. For Sasha, music is his first love, and what gives him a buzz is being able to share his music with others. Soon after 'Scorchio' came the first concrete proof of the long-awaited, debut Sasha longplayer.

'Airdrawndagger' took his nose for the dancefloor's g-spot and combined it with the ears for a heartstring strumming melody, a smile inducing hook and dirty great b-line to create a 69 minute symphony that sounds as wistfully enchanting doing the hoovering at home as it does reaching for the lasers on Saturday night. Like the best Sasha DJ set you ever heard, it has melancholy mixed with euphoria, downtempo introspection mixed with jump n' shout excitement.

Across the 11 tracks, there's the time and space to reflect his love for music that rarely gets the chance to shine in clubs, whether that's punishingly gnarly breakbeats or glittering modern classical film scores. It's a symphony for all ravers that grew up but never grew out of chasing that buzz. A record of a journey that began, as so many did, in the smoke and strobes of Manchester's Hacienda nightclub and has now taken him to Midwestern stadia and around the globe.

And that's an award-winning journey. The Delta Heavy Tour that consisted of Sasha, John Digweed and Johnny Van M and took in 35 gigs between March and May last year was recently awarded Best Dance Event at the Dancestar Awards 2003. It was a series of gigs that took DJing into unprecedented waters - two mammoth tour buses, visuals by the company behind hit movie 7even's intense opening credit sequence, and crowds of up to 15,000 clubbers crammed into arenas, warehouses and theatres across the United States. The success was such that Sasha and the boys will be back on the road to do it all again, bigger, better, badder come Spring next year.

After a summer of dates across the globe, including sets at Homelands, Creamfields, Dance Valley, and hosting a stage in the forest of the Mount Fuji Festival, Sasha has been in the studio again, working on new plans and ideas, and most recently remixing the forthcoming UNKLE single. Expect a few surprises over the coming months, for the man simply refuses to stand still.

STEVE PORTER - Fade Records | New York, New York

“So Fresh, So Clean” could be the perfect title for Steve Porter. It can easily describe his personality, his look and more importantly his music. 2003 was another banner year for the boy wonder with his big time single “Definite Form” and his now classic remix of Amber's “Anyway”. Adding to that his underground side projects Agent 001, HDF & Bons and his looming artist album, his music sees huge support across the spectrum of DJs from Sasha & John Digweed to Carl Cox to Mark Farina and Derek Carter.

Steve has now made a huge mark with his techno edged house productions. His studio work was only one facet of Steve's two prong attack. His DJing is where he really rocks the funky beats. His move to New York City from Boston has only put more fuel to the fire. Along with dates across the country and tours with Sasha (Airdrawndagger Tour), Sander Kleinenberg (Essential Mix Tour) and Chris Fortier, Steve is in demand from Tokyo to Tampa. With over 20 remixes to his credit, his Agent 001 & HDF & Bons projects busting down doors, he is leading way for the next wave of America's future stars.

FEATURING...


INFLUENCE - www.nfluence.net - SAN FRANCISCO

Representing straight out of San Francisco, Influence has been damaging dance floors with his versatile array of brokenbeat since 1998. His distinguished style combines long precise mixes, cross fader control with bass driven breaks. Influence has shared spotlights with some of brokenbeats most respected artists such as Chris Carter, Auotobots, Lobudg, Jhz, Trona, Aubl, Future Funk Squad, Stakka, Felix The Dog, Gridlok & Madame Mercury. In 2004, Influence started producing brokenbeat with the emphasis on funky, bass driven breaks. 


DJ CANTOS - www.djcantos.com - SACRAMENTO

In just a few short years, Sean Akio Canty a.k.a. Cantos, has advanced to the vanguard of the Sacramento dance music scene. With roots in mixing records reaching back to the underground hip-hop scene of 1992, Cantos possesses a level of skill and professionalism behind the decks that few can claim. His sound – a mixture of deep, progressive beats, dark breaks and smooth vocal tracks – demands control of the dance floor and his live sets can only be described as inspiring. His ability to read individual dancers and understand their desires never fails to satisfy each one. 

Beginning in Sacramento as a resident for a local underground production crew, Cantos is now a regular guest at The Rage Nightclub and has recently acquired residency at Twisted Thursdays located inside The Tower Club. With support from Sacramento’s most respected production crews , as well as U.K.’s Primalsounds.com, broadcasts of his internet show “ProgressiveSoul” are streamed live through selekta.com and reaches audiences worldwide. Cantos has utilized opportunities to share the decks with accomplished performers such as DJ Micro, DJ Dragn’fly, Gianni, East Coast Boogiemen, MTV's DJ Icon, Aphrodite, Moda, Ariel Cybana, Madame Mercury, Mars & Mystre, Paul Lancaster, Gabriel Black and DJ Dara...


UNDECIDED - www.urban-breaks.com - SEATTLE

In early 2004 Chris aka Undecided moved from Sacramento, where he was responsibile for throwing many breaks shows and hosting weekly breaks nights, to Seattle, where he is quickly making a name for himself. He began deejaying in early 1998 and his skills have rapidly evolved, incorporating into his sets scratches and an unmatched energy, and earning him the opportunity to play with many well known and talented artists such as uberzone, DJ Rap, Trona, Baby Anne, A;Dubl, and influenze. Undecided is well known for his ability to make you groove to dirty funk basslines.


SOULKID - www.urban-breaks.com - SEATTLE

Hailing orginally from Orlando, FL...Soulkid has made Seattle his homebase for the past three years to push his funky Florida Breaks sound all along the west coast. Blending the Miami bass and the female vocal hooks, Soulkid keeps with the trademark of the Florida sound to move the soul. Influenced by breaks producers like Fixx, John Digweed, BT, Bassbin Twins, Huda Hudia, Brad Smith, Soulkid brings 17 years of experience behind the decks with him and a stage presence to match.


BISCUIT - www.urban-breaks.com - SEATTLE

Combining Nuskool, UK, and Funky Breaks, Biscuit has been bringing the best in breaks to dancefloors throughout the Northwest for the last 3 years. In this relatively short amount of time, Biscuit has quickly distinguished himself in the Seattle breaks scene with precise mixing and an enthusiastic stage presence. His talent behind the decks has lead him to share line-ups with numerious breakbeat icons and turntabalism geniuses such as Aquasky vs Masterblaster, Deekline, DJ Fixx, DJ Craze, the Young Punx, Factor e, and Disco D.

------=Can You Collect Them All?=-------




Reid Speed 
-=Very Special TWO Room Set! One Breaks, One Drum 'n' Bass=-
Reid Speed has had a pretty great year. In the fourteen months since her first mix CD, Resonance, on Breakbeat Science Recordings, she conquered a 35-date tour, moved to Los Angeles, secured a national ad campaign with Triple 5 Soul, and was selected as the official DJ for a network comedy show. As the perfect finish to her outstanding debut year, Reid Speed now releases her powerful new drum + bass mix CD, Life After Dark, a reflection of her packed dancefloor sets that illuminates the depth of her selection and the full spectrum of her talent as a DJ.

None of this attention has in any way distracted Reid from her first love - the dancefloor, to which she dedicates Life After Dark. The tracks on this, her second mix CD, represent a bold cross-section of the varying moods of drum + bass. Reid weaves a musical tapestry of uncommon threads, building a bridge from the musical bounce of "Funhouse", by NYC d+b production kings Mathematics, to the hardcore ragga stabs of DJ Dara and A-Sides' "Unholy Grail". Always one of drum + bass' most talented storytellers, Reid not only manages to get these two sounds into the same room but has them engaged in deep conversation - her greatest strength as a DJ and one of the standout elements of this mix. In a nod to diversity of tempos, the mix is bookended by slower and deeper works; Life After Dark opens with the murderous downtempo of drum + bass legend Dylan's "Black Rainbow" and slows to a sublime close with Omni Trio's remix of the Foul Play classic "Music Is The Key" - a bold gesture for a
 drum + bass DJ, and an illustrative start to the next unpredictable year of Reid Speed's artistic life.

Aaron Simpson

Jimmy Hoffa VS Chris Tremens


Detonate & Sarah Shoxx

VS.

Wheelz & The Corruptor

-+- 2 hours, 2x4, Hard Tekno versus Hard Trance! -+-
Detonate and Sarah Shoxx have been playing hard tekno all over for the last year, aggressively dedicating themselves to this new found love. Wheelz & The Corruptor have been producing and playing some of the best hard trance seattle's been groovin on for the last year. All 4 of these long time Seattle Electronica veterans are going to bring both styles together, in a battle for HARD supremacy!

Flave vs Jordan
-=Get your Funky ass up! Jordan and Flave are 2x4ing!=-
What do you get when you put Flave and Jordan together? You get a lot of ass shakin and lots and lots of funky shit! These cats used to live together and do it every day. Now their unleashing the funky fury at Ravetastic once again. You know it's on!!!

DJ Monkey VS Sonny Chiba VS ?????? VS Sandman
-=Who is the Suprise DJ?=-
Trance brought to you by Sonny C, DJ Monkey, Sandman and the mystery DJ. Who could it be? Only one way to find out! You'll hear lots and lots of rumors, but that just makes it more RaveTasTic! This is sure to be one of the most memorable sets of the night for any trancer out there. 

Sir Kutz vs Kreeper
-=4 decks and 2 mixers. 90 minutes and 50 records =-
Sir Kutz has been extremly busy playing all over Canada, Taiwan and Portland. While not playing in the Bass-Sick Boys rockin speed garage with Dig-Dug he can be seen playing Nu Skool Breaks. We figured what could be more ravetastically delicious then to have him play head to head with our own local bad boy Kreeper!!!!

Bazsic Elementz vs EMU
-+- 2 hours, 4 decks, 2 mixers, a metric raveload of breaks djs! -+-
One of the most interesting match ups, with Baszic and EMU kickin it and playing all sorts of breakbeats all over the northwest. This friendly duo may just end up being an around the world tour of the breaks. 

Goodbeat Drum n Bass!
-+Complex, RiceCube, Juggler, & Edot+-
Oh my god. The Goodbeat Drum and Bass crew in effect. Mash up style for the masses. Goodbeat + Ravetastic + Drum & Bass = GOOD RAVETASTIC DRUM AND BASS BEATS!!!

Jizosh vs Swank
-=UHF "House Ain't Givin Up" 2x4=-
That's right! The United House Front is on board and going to give us 90 minutes of funk! These cool cats have been holdin down Seattle house for a long damn time! Never to be bought, never to be sold, the UHF's finest are gonna funk you and leave you wanting some more!

Hardcore Kids of Doom!
-=Jimni Cricket vs Kid Kaboom vs Element DCLXVI=-
Take three of the most hardcore kids in the northwest and pit them up against each other and you've got a recipe for chaos and destruction. No one is sure how this will end up, but there will most definitely be some black and blue and blood and guts and broken bones.... of doom. 

Tony the Troll vs Loki
-=Treasure Troll vs The God of Mischief in the Breakbeat Arena!=-
Tony and Loki have been squarin off here and there in Seattle since ALL YOUR BASS ARE BELONG TO US, but only in the form of tag sets and improv action. On this night, they take on each other in a 2x4 which pits action figure against norse god! There are rumors of costumes and shenannigans. We'll just have to wait and see.

Heavyweight vs Jowell vs NRGYZR
-+-Pussycat in the house with an hour and a half of HARD trance and NRG-+-
The Pussycat Trio will be taking you on a journey of hard trance and NRG that will show you the best of what's across the water's got to offer. 

Soular
Soular, formerly Plurfict Trip, has been developing an awesome cosmic jazzy sound to his drum and bass. After hearing him play on C89 and at Edot's House Party, we had to bring Soular in to reprezent! This cat plays some smoooth tunes. 

Niugini
Niugini is the CD section of the Mix Orgying "Mendicants" but when he's solo, don't expect breakbeat madness, expect some of the chilliest and deep down relaxing house Soul Seek has to offer! 

Dave Airborne
Dave Airborne is quickly developing a good sound that even those who dislike trance will dig. One of the "goodbeat rookies" Dave is sure to impress with his programming and on point mixing. Just don't trainspot. He hates that!

BillyOKantSpin
BillyOKantSpin is a continuing project. This is the hardest working raver in town. Busting his ass all week long for his family and then comiing out and supporting and helping out with whatever shows go on. Billy0 literally can't spin. But he's going to learn. Consider this live action Reality TV!

Zodiac Productions presents: The Chill Room

The Death of Rich Uncle Skeleton
Radius VS. Manubrium
This is it. The final demise of the union of Rich Uncle Skeleton. Radius and Manubrium decide to have their final battle amongst the sounds of enlightenment. amongst the wailing of hell.

 and crews comprise a complete list of SFBay Area representation?


This is a list that would include current & present, future and unknown, 
past, as well as underground, lesser known and well known entities 
comprising the span of collectives, production crews, crews, tribes, 
groups, communities and associated with event production, promotion, 
planning, participation and creation in the greater SF Bay Area.

Renegade crews, as well as larger known and lesser known groups 
apply

Thanks
Karina

What's more intriguing is the difference in price between Red Bull and=20
Water @ the store versus in a bar. What's the most you've ever seen Red=20
Bull and Water for?

Water: 5 bucks a *small* bottle
Red Bull: 6 bucks a can!

Talk about raping and pillaging the people for $$$

Renegade crews, as well as larger known and lesser known groups 
apply

>It's because of what he can do with music - the way he can make good

>electronic dance, from trance, breaks, progressive and deep house, and 
>create a languidly hypnotic liquid groove. The way his understanding of

>experience and take it on a journey. Sasha has always been noted for being 
>a master at this and it is this universal appeal that he has tapped into 
>that has established his strong fanbase around the globe.
>
>Do not be mistaken, this kind of recognition does not happen overnight. 
>Born and raised in a small town in Wales, Sasha was exposed to Motown 
>records when he was just a baby and it was in the home that his talent for 
>playing the piano was developed. His stepmother forced him to take lessons. 
>At the time, he hated them, but after his first studio session - and this 
>is typical Sasha - he phoned her to say thank you. His first exposure to 
>house music was at Manchester's Hacienda; just as dance music exploded into 
>the summer of love. One visit and the young pony-tailed Sasha was hooked. 
>"The smoke machine, the strobe lights, everyone trance dancing, wearing 
>bandanas and smiley T-shirts," he smiles now. "It definitely had a fuck-you 
>attitude compared to the rest of pop music." This impact encouraged his 
>move from Wales to Manchester. His first exploration into Djing was when a 
>DJ in a local pub announced he was looking for people to play club dates. 
>Sasha volunteered and now says that he
>  'had about 30 records and basically just blagged it'.
>
>After honing his deck technique, Sasha's first big break came when he was 
>offered a residency at Stokes legendary club Shelly's. When all the other 
>DJ's were playing US House, Sasha's style was much more uplifting, and he 
>encapsulated clubbers with his mixture of piano led Italian House whilst 
>playing acapella tracks over the top. This combination alongside a wide 
>variety of anthems kept dancefloors full and elevated Sasha to hero status. 
>And, lets not forget, in a world where the DJ had too often been 
>bespectacled nerds, here the headline DJ had the looks and charm to match 
>his growing following. In classic rock n' roll style, here was a star that 
>boys wanted to hang out with and girls wanted to get just that little more 
>bit close to.
>
>Shelly's was the launch pad for the residency at Renaissance, where Sasha 
>created his niche and helped forge a new style in UK house music. At 
>Renaissance two major things happened; Sasha mixed the first ever UK DJ mix 
>album and he met John Digweed which cemented the partnership known as 
>'Northern Exposure'. Sasha and John have played together on five 
>continents, have mixed 3 'Northern Exposure' albums which have sold to over 
>1 million people worldwide. This special brother like relationship that 
>Sasha and Digweed have on the decks, is what landed them the monthly 
>residency at New York's "Twilo", following in the footsteps of Vasquez and 
>Tenaglia.
>
>The first DJ cover star - on Mixmag in early 1991 - the still shy DJ was

>Although Sasha has clearly reached a celebrity status, it's his generous

>a gruelling three month tour took their sound further out into deepest 
>America, preaching a gospel of repetitive beats and imaginative mixing from

>'Airdrawndagger' took his nose for the dancefloor's g-spot and combined it

>on Saturday night. Like the best Sasha DJ set you ever heard, it has 
>melancholy mixed with euphoria, downtempo introspection mixed with jump n' 
>shout excitement.
>
>Across the 11 tracks, there's the time and space to reflect his love for 
>music that rarely gets the chance to shine in clubs, whether that's 
>punishingly gnarly breakbeats or glittering modern classical film scores. 
>It's a symphony for all ravers that grew up but never grew out of chasing 
>that buzz. A record of a journey that began, as so many did, in the smoke 
>and strobes of Manchester's Hacienda nightclub and has now taken him to 
>Midwestern stadia and around the globe.
>
>And that's an award-winning journey. The Delta Heavy Tour that consisted of 
>Sasha, John Digweed and Johnny Van M and took in 35 gigs between March and 
>May last year was recently awarded Best Dance Event at the Dancestar Awards 
>2003. It was a series of gigs that took DJing into unprecedented waters -

>After a summer of dates across the globe, including sets at Homelands,

Subject: RE: [sfraves] Miss Kitten at Mezzanine 4.30.05___ FREE

Amen. It is insane the markup of non-alcoholic products at most bars. That 
is one of the VERY few things I miss about the DC metro area...ok, let me 
recant - the Baltimore area (a mere 30 minutes north of DC). Anything in the 
majority of the bars there, from booze to water, was pretty damn cheap. And 
the drinks in "cHarm city" (as it's known), are retardedly strong. The only 
place I've ever found 16oz Red Bull & Vodkas for $2.50 - you cannot fuck 
with that.

FEATURING...


INFLUENCE - www.nfluence.net - SAN FRANCISCO

Representing straight out of San Francisco, Influence has been damaging dance floors with his versatile array of brokenbeat since 1998. His distinguished style combines long precise mixes, cross fader control with bass driven breaks. Influence has shared spotlights with some of brokenbeats most respected artists such as Chris Carter, Auotobots, Lobudg, Jhz, Trona, Aubl, Future Funk Squad, Stakka, Felix The Dog, Gridlok & Madame Mercury. In 2004, Influence started producing brokenbeat with the emphasis on funky, bass driven breaks. 


DJ CANTOS - www.djcantos.com - SACRAMENTO

In just a few short years, Sean Akio Canty a.k.a. Cantos, has advanced to the vanguard of the Sacramento dance music scene. With roots in mixing records reaching back to the underground hip-hop scene of 1992, Cantos possesses a level of skill and professionalism behind the decks that few can claim. His sound – a mixture of deep, progressive beats, dark breaks and smooth vocal tracks – demands control of the dance floor and his live sets can only be described as inspiring. His ability to read individual dancers and understand their desires never fails to satisfy each one. 

Beginning in Sacramento as a resident for a local underground production crew, Cantos is now a regular guest at The Rage Nightclub and has recently acquired residency at Twisted Thursdays located inside The Tower Club. With support from Sacramento’s most respected production crews , as well as U.K.’s Primalsounds.com, broadcasts of his internet show “ProgressiveSoul” are streamed live through selekta.com and reaches audiences worldwide. Cantos has utilized opportunities to share the decks with accomplished performers such as DJ Micro, DJ Dragn’fly, Gianni, East Coast Boogiemen, MTV's DJ Icon, Aphrodite, Moda, Ariel Cybana, Madame Mercury, Mars & Mystre, Paul Lancaster, Gabriel Black and DJ Dara...


UNDECIDED - www.urban-breaks.com - SEATTLE

In early 2004 Chris aka Undecided moved from Sacramento, where he was responsibile for throwing many breaks shows and hosting weekly breaks nights, to Seattle, where he is quickly making a name for himself. He began deejaying in early 1998 and his skills have rapidly evolved, incorporating into his sets scratches and an unmatched energy, and earning him the opportunity to play with many well known and talented artists such as uberzone, DJ Rap, Trona, Baby Anne, A;Dubl, and influenze. Undecided is well known for his ability to make you groove to dirty funk basslines.


SOULKID - www.urban-breaks.com - SEATTLE

Hailing orginally from Orlando, FL...Soulkid has made Seattle his homebase for the past three years to push his funky Florida Breaks sound all along the west coast. Blending the Miami bass and the female vocal hooks, Soulkid keeps with the trademark of the Florida sound to move the soul. Influenced by breaks producers like Fixx, John Digweed, BT, Bassbin Twins, Huda Hudia, Brad Smith, Soulkid brings 17 years of experience behind the decks with him and a stage presence to match.


BISCUIT - www.urban-breaks.com - SEATTLE

Combining Nuskool, UK, and Funky Breaks, Biscuit has been bringing the best in breaks to dancefloors throughout the Northwest for the last 3 years. In this relatively short amount of time, Biscuit has quickly distinguished himself in the Seattle breaks scene with precise mixing and an enthusiastic stage presence. His talent behind the decks has lead him to share line-ups with numerious breakbeat icons and turntabalism geniuses such as Aquasky vs Masterblaster, Deekline, DJ Fixx, DJ Craze, the Young Punx, Factor e, and Disco D.

Subject: [sfraves] Request for Resources: Flyer Design

I would like to inquire if any of you have Graphic design skills and 
are interested in working with SFRaves to design a flyer for our event 
on April 30, 2005.

This requirement needs to be turned around and delivered in a short 
timeframe. Several of our original designers are not available at this 
time to design a flyer. If you are interested in helping us out, please

"It's All Gone Pete Tong": Last night a (deaf) DJ saved my life

SALON.COM


In addition to possessing the most confusing title of the year, Canadian 
filmmaker Michael Dowse's high-energy dance-club saga 
<http://www.itsallgonepetetong.com/>"It's All Gone Pete Tong" arrives in an 
elaborate package of spoof and deception that should win the admiration of 
any practical-joke connoisseur. English comedian Paul Kaye has a 
star-making role as one Frankie Wilde, a deranged Cockney exile who's more 
or less the Keith Richards of the cocaine-drenched club scene on Ibiza, the 
über-trendy Spanish resort island. (The movie's title, by the way, derives 
from Cockney rhyming slang and also name-checks a different well-known DJ, 
and that's all the help you're getting from me.)

As other jet-setting DJs like Carl Cox and Paul van Dyk testify in the 
movie, Frankie's hard-driving dance mixes, hard-partying ways and maniacal 
stage antics revolutionized Ibiza nightlife in the late '90s, until the 
combination of a genetic eardrum issue and all those pumping beats rendered 
Frankie stone deaf. He then falls into the embrace of the Coke Badger, a 
fuzzy, demonic beast whose love requires you to shovel white powder up your 
nose by the kilo. (The Internet campaign for this movie is so extensive 
that even the Badger has his own <http://www.cokebadger.com/>Web site, 
complete with sinister purring noises.)

But thanks to a sexy Spanish lip-reading instructor named Penelope (Beatriz 
Batarda) and a pair of speakers with built-in flip-flops on top, Frankie 
learns to feel the beat he can't hear. He gets off the snow, if not the 
Scotch and ciggies, and rises again to the pinnacle of his profession -- 
before he and Penelope disappear from Ibiza for good. Is he now writing his 
memoirs (or, as Frankie himself observes, writing a pamphlet, since a book 
would take too long)? Running a record shop in Oxford? Busking for change 
on the streets of New York? Holed up in a tropical hideaway plotting his 
next comeback? Rumors fly, but nobody knows for sure.

Frankly, I think you'd have to be an idiot to watch 10 minutes of this 
movie -- what with Frankie's drunken monologue about the many uses of 
"spunk," or the pompous meanderings of Eric Banning (Dan Antopolski), a 
scholar who has supposedly written several books about Frankie's career -- 
without understanding that it's a full-on piss-take, as the Brits would 
say. But the packed houses of boogieing Ibiza nubiles are real enough, and 
trashily exciting, and indeed, if you start spelunking on the Web, you'll 
find all kinds of testimonials to the extraordinary career of 
<http://www.frankiewilde.com/>Frankie Wilde.

Chat rooms about pop music, movies and dance culture are packed with 
Frankie questions (many of them strikingly similar in tone): Have you heard 
about the amazing deaf DJ? How can I find his records? Even Alfonse and 
Horst, the two clownish Austrians who serve as Frankie's chief musical 
assistants, have a Web site for their post-Frankie outfit 
<http://www.ladderhause.com/>Ladder Hause. No one ever went broke by 
overestimating public ignorance, it's said, and a surprising number of 
critics and real human beings have been taken in by "Pete Tong" already.

I have one word of advice for those marketing mavens who constructed this 
game: Amazon. If Frankie Wilde really had all these hit records, albeit 
quasi-obscure Euroclub mixes, wouldn't some of them be for sale somewhere? 
Anyway, Paul Kaye gives an amazing performance, the first half of the movie 
is crudely hilarious, and the love story with the lithe and lovely Batarda 
works surprisingly well. (Kate Magowan and Mike Wilmot get special props 
for their roles as Frankie's Dolce-and-Gabbana-laden trashbag wife and 
skeezeball, bottle-tanned manager, respectively.)

Director Michael Dowse (whose previous movie, "Fubar," took a similar 
approach to heavy metal) blew through New York this week, and I grabbed him 
for a few minutes. He insisted on staying on message, at least officially. 
When I asked him if he wanted to discuss the real deal behind "Pete Tong," 
he said, "You mean the fact that I'm not really Canadian? Go ahead. Say 
whatever you want to about that."

No, but really, Mike, what kind of movie is this?

It's a bio piece about an amazing DJ. It's a comedy, too, but I think 
comedy is a great way to treat it. Something as tragic as Frankie's story 
requires a sense of humor. I'm sick of movies that take a dour approach to 
tragic subject matter. I wanted to make a film that the guy himself would 
have appreciated.

Um, OK, let's move on. You shot in real Ibiza clubs with real crowds. That 
must have been an essential part of the production. Without that, the movie 
wouldn't have worked at all.

Yeah, that was the element I was most nervous about. We needed access to 
the clubs to make it feel authentic. Otherwise, we would have died. You 
know, our musical coordinator was Lol Hammond, who's a part of that club 
world. He was our shepherd, and people were like, "Well, if Lol's doing it, 
it must be all right."

My worst nightmare was having those club scenes look like a beer 
commercial. You know: "Now everybody have fun!" So the cast and crew had to 
be portable and adaptable, no big circus, no trailers. We had to shoot on 
the spot and we had to shoot fast. No way were we going to try to re-create 
an Ibiza nightclub on a set. I hate movies where they do that, like in "Go" 
or whatever, where they hire a warehouse and put 200 extras in it. It 
always looks so fake.

Tell us about the Coke Badger. He's the latest in a line of fuzzy, scary 
creatures in film.

Yes he is!

I was thinking about the rabbits, of course. In 
<http://www.salon.com/ent/movies/review/2001/06/13/sexy_beast/>"Sexy Beast" 
and in 
<http://www.salon.com/ent/movies/review/2001/10/30/donnie_darko/>"Donnie 
Darko."

Yeah, but nobody uses them for comedy. I really wanted the beast to attack 
and kill, but also to be a comic character. I guess he's a gag: Cocaine is 
a very badgering drug. But we've all seen those preachy movies about drugs, 
where four addicts end up in the fetal position. Yes, drugs are bad, but I 
didn't want that to be the message of the film.

Obviously Paul Kaye is the heart and soul of this film, and it feels like a 
breakout performance. He's well known in Britain but not at all over here. 
How'd you find him?

Well, Paul came very well recommended, so we exchanged tapes and mutually 
disliked each other's work. [Laughter from Kaye, who is nearby.] Seriously, 
I love that he tends to "improvise toward the stupid," as he puts it, which 
was just perfect for the character of Frankie.

Isn't this movie a tough sell in the United States? In Britain and Europe, 
club music is huge and DJs are big stars. But it's still a small niche 
audience in America.

Yeah, well, it's harder in some ways. But you don't have to know anything 
about club music, or like it, to enjoy the film. The club kids are our core 
audience -- we just had a screening with BPM magazine, and they went nuts 
for it. But I also had a 70-year-old couple at the Aspen Film Festival tell 
me it was the perfect movie. They were like: "We don't listen to that kind 
of music, but there we were, tappin' our toes!"

"It's All Gone Pete Tong" opens April 15 in New York, April 29 in Los 
Angeles and May 13 in at least 24 other U.S. cities.

FRIDAY APRIL 15
HYBRID(dj set) at Cellar Bar, with Serge Devant opening
  Yea, you heard me....
this Friday we(East Side Productions) welcome 2 of the coolest and most talented guys in the business to play a special dj set for us at Cellar Bar....Chris Healing and Mike Truman...known to most people as HYBRID!

Hybrid have seen it all and done it all. In 2000, Hybrid traversed the length and breadth of America as guests of Moby on his tour. He then asked Hybrid to perform at his final London date of the year - Wembley Arena. This marked Hybrid's and Moby's largest indoor performance.
In 2003 Hybrid released Morning Sci-Fi which included collaborations with NYC based DJ/remixer John Creamer, Kirsty Hawkshaw, the legendary Peter Hook (New Order) and The Hermitage String Orchestra, St Petersburg.

They just dont stop, they are still working on numerous projects and we all cant wait to see what they come up with next!!!!

Come on down to Cellar Bar to check them out for a VERY rare appearance. How many times do you think you will have the opportunity to see a group like Hybrid play for FREE in a 200 person intimate and gorgeous lounge?
I think we all know the answer to that one....see you Friday ;)

Subject: [sfraves] nrr: Republican call for Japanese American Internment Memorial

yes, i'm talking about it again.  ;)

-b

Emotional call for internment memorials=20
Bakersfield Republican bucks the White House=20
- Edward Epstein, Chronicle Washington Bureau
Friday, April 15, 2005=20

Washington -- One of California's most powerful Republican House
members is clashing with the Bush administration, which opposes his
proposal to authorize $38 million in federal funds to preserve the
camps where Japanese Americans were interned during World War II.

An emotional Rep. Bill Thomas, R-Bakersfield, choked up a few times
Thursday as he presented his bill at a House Resources subcommittee
meeting and recalled how the passage of years was taking away those
who lived through a dark episode in U.S. history.

First, the 63-year-old Ways and Means Committee chairman remembered
post- World War II Japanese American friends whose parents had a hard
time talking about their bitter wartime years.

And he recalled two men who died recently. Fred Korematsu, who died
March 30, was the man who defied President Franklin D. Roosevelt's
internment order, a stand that led to a historic U.S. Supreme Court
ruling upholding FDR's orders. The late Rep. Robert Matsui,
D-Sacramento, who died on New Year's Day, was sent to the Tule Lake
camp in far Northern California with his parents as an infant, and was
one of Thomas' original co-sponsors for the legislation.

"This legislation is the absolute bottom line of what we should do,''
Thomas said.

President Ronald Reagan and Congress formally apologized in 1988 for
the treatment of the 120,000 Japanese Americans who were sent to 10
camps. The internment represents "an era of history that needs to be
remembered. A lot of the sites are disappearing,'' along with the
surviving internees, many of whom are in their 70s or 80s, Thomas
said.

Thomas also is sponsoring the bill because of his long friendship with
former Democratic state Assemblyman Fred Mori, who is the immediate
past president of the San Francisco-based Japanese American Citizens
League. The political odd couple were roommates in Sacramento when
they both served in the Assembly in the late 1970s.

"It was an unusual relationship politically,'' Mori recalled. "We've
been friends ever since.''

Co-sponsors from internment camps

Among Thomas' co-sponsors are Matsui's widow and successor, Rep. Doris
Matsui, D-Sacramento, who was born in the Poston internment camp in
Arizona, and Rep. Mike Honda, D-San Jose, who spent his early
childhood in a Colorado camp.

Thomas' bill would require nonprofit groups and local governments to
come up with a 25 percent match for federal funds. It would cover 10
internment camps, including Tule Lake and Manzanar in California and a
host of associated sites, including 17 assembly centers in such places
as the old Tanforan racetrack in San Bruno, and at sites in Stockton,
Salinas and Sacramento.

The money would go to buy property now in private hands, help restore
historic buildings and perhaps create museums and visitors centers.

The National Park Service, which would administer the program, says it
has nothing against commemorating the internment episode. But
officials says the agency can't afford a new program mandated by
Congress, especially in a time of tight budgets and huge maintenance
backlogs at federal park properties across the country.

"With the emphasis we have placed on the president's initiative to
reduce the deferred maintenance backlog, it has become more important
than ever to avoid authorizing funding for non-National Park Service
projects that would draw funds from the Park Service's budget,'' said
the service's acting deputy director, Michael Snyder.

Park Service proposals

He said the Park Service already has made the Manzanar camp site on
Highway 395 in the eastern Sierra into a historic site whose visitors'
center attracts 80,000 people a year and that it administers a
five-year-old memorial to Japanese American patriotism during World
War II just a few blocks from the Capitol building. He suggested that
instead of Thomas' proposal the Park Service could work with local
groups to develop programs at the camp sites and publish a guidebook
to internment sites.

That suggestion didn't go over well with the legislation's advocates.

"By itself, I find that insulting,'' Gerald Yamada, national
coordinator of the Japanese American National Heritage Coalition, told
the subcommittee. "The plans don't address the hardship and sacrifice
and the lessons we seek to preserve. Left to their own volition, I'm
not encouraged they would do more than they're doing.''

The subcommittee did not vote on the bill, although passage is likely
when it does. As for the final showdown between Thomas and the Park
Service, congressional aides said they wouldn't bet against the
chairman of one of Congress' most powerful committees, given his deep
commitment to the idea.

'We are the living legacy'

If the proposal ever becomes law, such groups as the Tule Lake
Committee -- which is already involved in preserving the campsite near
the Oregon state line and in developing programs teaching
multicultural understanding -- are getting ready.

"The money we could get would be a start'' toward building a museum of
conscience, said San Franciscan Pat Shiono, who chairs the Tule Lake
group's preservation committee.

The group has reclaimed three wooden sheds that were camp barracks,
which the federal government gave away after the war, and wants to
restore them. It also wants to take over existing war-era buildings
now used by Caltrans and the Bureau of Reclamation.

Tule Lake was the toughest of the camps because it housed the
"no-nos,'' Japanese Americans who refused to declare undivided loyalty
to America, feeling the question was an insult to their citizenship.
The Army guarded the camp, and there was scattered violence, the
committee's history says.

"We are very attached to that site,'' said Shiono, who was born after
the war to parents who were interned. "We know the camps changed the
lives of all Japanese Americans. We are the living legacy of a proud
group of immigrants who were imprisoned without charge.''

http://www.cnn.com/2005/TECH/science/04/14/mit.prank.reut/

CAMBRIDGE, Massachusetts (Reuters) -- In a victory for pranksters at
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, a bunch of
computer-generated gibberish masquerading as an academic paper has been
accepted at a scientific conference.

Jeremy Stribling said Thursday that he and two fellow MIT graduate
students questioned the standards of some academic conferences, so they
wrote a computer program to generate research papers complete with
"context-free grammar," charts and diagrams.

The trio submitted two of the randomly assembled papers to the World
Multi-Conference on Systemics, Cybernetics and Informatics (WMSCI),
scheduled to be held July 10-13 in Orlando, Florida.

To their surprise, one of the papers -- "Rooter: A Methodology for the
Typical Unification of Access Points and Redundancy" -- was accepted
for presentation.

The prank recalled a 1996 hoax in which New York University physicist
Alan Sokal succeeded in getting an entire paper with a mix of truths,
falsehoods, non sequiturs and otherwise meaningless mumbo-jumbo
published in the quarterly journal Social Text, published by Duke
University Press.

Stribling said he and his colleagues only learned about the Social Text
affair after submitting their paper.

"Rooter" features such mind-bending gems as: "the model for our
heuristic consists of four independent components: simulated annealing,
active networks, flexible modalities, and the study of reinforcement
learning" and "We implemented our scatter/gather I/O server in
Simula-67, augmented with opportunistically pipelined extensions."

Stribling said the trio targeted WMSCI because it is notorious within
the field of computer science for sending copious e-mails that solicit
admissions to the conference.

The idea of a fake submission was to counter "fake conferences...which
exist only to make money," explained Stribling and his cohorts'
website, "SCIgen - An Automatic CS Paper Generator."

"Our aim is to maximize amusement, rather than coherence," it said. The
website allows users to "Generate a Random Paper" themselves, with
fields for inserting "optional author names."
"Contrarily, the lookaside buffer might not be the panacea..."

Nagib Callaos, a conference organizer, said the paper was one of a
small number accepted on a "non-reviewed" basis -- meaning that
reviewers had not yet given their feedback by the acceptance deadline.

"We thought that it might be unfair to refuse a paper that was not
refused by any of its three selected reviewers," Callaos wrote in an
e-mail. "The author of a non-reviewed paper has complete responsibility
of the content of their paper."

However, Callaos said conference organizers were reviewing their
acceptance procedures in light of the hoax.

Asked whether he would disinvite the MIT students, Callos replied,
"Bogus papers should not be included in the conference program."

Stribling said conference organizers had not yet formally rescinded
their invitation to present the paper.

The students were soliciting cash donations so they could attend the
conference and give what Stribling billed as a "completely

The US is:  "...a nation of 200 million used-car salesmen with all the 
money we need to buy guns and no qualms about killing anybody else in the 
world who tries to make us uncomfortable."
-Hunter S. Thompson

"Friend, hope for the truth while you are alive.  Jump into experience 
while you are alive!  What you call "salvation" belongs to the time before 
death.  If you don't break your ropes while you are alive, do you think 
ghosts will do it after?"
-Kabir

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the 
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become 
visible."
-Jacques Attali in his seminal text "Noise"

ummmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm I think it was more that he developed
systems of generating orgone energy. but he was awesome. he was a
mystic scientist who figured out a way of scientifically controlling
sexual cosmic energy. unfortunately the powers that be kinda threw him
in prison and set his books on fire. if he had just pulled an Einstein
and helped them build a bomb, maybe they would have tolerated his
genius, but I don't know if I could handle a world with nuclear sex
bombs, especially now in the modern age of terrorism. I don't think
the world is ready for a nuclear sex bomb terrorist.

Subject: [sfraves] Doctor Wilson to offer Prescription

--=====================_9010085==.ALT
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"; format=flowed



An interesting article on my friend Greg Wilson in the UK.

"House music is no longer at the cutting edge of culture.  I think people 
are a little stranded, to be honest. It's not new any more and as a result 
people want to go back and explore the roots of the music they like."


Doctor Wilson to offer Prescription

Richard Hector-Jones

DJ legend Greg Wilson is a walking encyclopaedia of black music. An hour on 
the phone to him on Monday night reveals that.

And, if that weren't indication enough, you should visit his website 
<http://www.electrofunkroutes.co.uk>www.electrofunkroutes.co.uk, where he 
waxes lyrical about a near forgotten period of dance music that rocked his 
post northern soul and pre-acid house world; a scene characterised by New 
York labels such as West End, Tommy Boy, Prelude and Sugarhill.

Music that went on to inform Chicago and Detroit as much as the Europeans 
such as Kraftwerk. Yet somehow it never got the accolades.

Tonight Liverpudlian Greg plays a new night called Prescription, taking 
place at Legends on Whitworth Street, spinning a set of his characteristic 
electro-funk sounds to a crowd that might not have a) paid attention first 
time round or, b) not been born when Greg was spinning back in the day.

Johnnie Johnson, 80, Dies; Hall of Fame Rock Pianist

By Adam Bernstein
Washington Post Staff Writer
Thursday, April 14, 2005; Page B07

Rock and Roll Hall of Fame pianist Johnnie Johnson, who worked closely with 
Chuck Berry and insisted that he was the inspiration for the song "Johnny 
B. Goode," died April 13 at his home in St. Louis. He was 80 and suffered 
recently from pneumonia and a kidney ailment.

Mr. Johnson, once known as the "baddest right hand in the land," was a 
rollicking thriller on the ivories. Reared on stride and boogie-woogie 
styles, he went on to support Berry, the flamboyant, duckwalking 
singer-guitarist, for most of the 1950s and then sporadically afterward.

They had a famously complex relationship. Berry, originally hired as a 
replacement in Mr. Johnson's rhythm-and-blues trio, soon overshadowed the 
reserved pianist. "When Chuck started with me, he didn't know but 12 songs 
all the way through and couldn't play the guitar that well," Mr. Johnson 
told his biographer, Travis Fitzpatrick.

Although sidelined by Berry and suffering from alcoholism, Mr. Johnson 
continued to help craft Berry's most famous songs, including "Maybellene," 
"Sweet Little Sixteen," "Roll Over Beethoven" and "Back in the U.S.A." He 
said he provided extensive melodic framework to accompany Berry's ideas, 
but by the time Chess Records made them stars, Berry was the frontman and 
had the glory.

Mr. Johnson drove a bus for the elderly in St. Louis and occasionally went 
on the road with Berry and other musicians. Largely resigned to obscurity, 
he received an unexpected boost when he appeared in Taylor Hackford's 
documentary film "Chuck Berry, Hail! Hail! Rock 'n' Roll" (1987), made to 
celebrate Berry's 60th birthday.

Keith Richards, the Rolling Stones guitarist who was featured in the 
documentary, became one of Mr. Johnson's chief supporters. "You can tell 
how much Johnnie's blues stylings had to do with the music for Chuck's 
tunes," he once said, "by the fact that a lot of those characteristic Chuck 
Berry guitar riffs and compositions are in keys familiar to Johnnie and 
other pianists but seldom used by guitarists."

In 2000, Mr. Johnson sued for co-writing credit on 57 songs, claiming Berry 
had taken advantage of Mr. Johnson's alcoholism to claim sole credit. A 
federal judge dismissed the claim because too many years had passed since 
the disputed songs were written.

Mr. Johnson's final fight was winning recognition from the Rock and Roll 
Hall of Fame, which inducted him in 2001, when it added a new category for 
sidemen. Mr. Johnson saw the long wait as one of rules and politics, 
saying, "I knew there were others in there not as good as me."

Johnnie Clyde Johnson was born July 8, 1924, in Fairmont, W.Va., where his 
father was a coal miner. His parents bought him a secondhand upright piano 
when he was 4. When the youngster sat down and began fingering some music, 
he said his mother "cried out that it was a gift from God."

Mr. Johnson said he learned musical timing by listening to trains near his 
home. He also listened to his parents' blues records and tuned into a 
late-night big-band program in Pittsburgh called "Dawn Patrol."

While serving in the Marine Corps in the Pacific, he played in a group 
composed of musicians from the Count Basie and Lionel Hampton bands. He 
said that meeting many of his idols focused him on a career in music.

In 1952, while fronting a blues trio for a New Year's Eve engagement at the 
Cosmopolitan Club in East St. Louis, Ill., he hired the obscure Berry as a 
last-minute replacement and noticed an immediate impact.

Berry, favoring a raucous, hillbilly-blues style, soon became the star 
presence at the Cosmopolitan. Sir John's Trio, as Mr. Johnson's group was 
called, was soon the Chuck Berry Combo.

Mr. Johnson was deferential, up to a point, mostly because Berry had a car. 
But conflicts ensued over money and Mr. Johnson's habitual lateness to 
engagements. Mr. Johnson once said: "I'd just get there in time for the 
show and Chuck would be shakin' his head, askin' me: 'Why can't you just be 
good, Johnnie? Stay with us.' "

He claimed the phrase inspired Berry to write "Johnny B. Goode" in 1958. 
Berry said the lyrics, which describe a country boy who "could play a 
guitar just like ringing a bell," was more about himself, though some 
sources claim he wrote it for Mr. Johnson.

It became one of Berry's greatest hits, a song so infectiously upbeat that 
NASA blasted it into space in a time capsule as a sample of Earth music. In 
interviews, Mr. Johnson introduced himself as "Johnny B. Goode."

After the Hackford documentary, Mr. Johnson played with such artists as 
Richards, Bob Weir and Eric Clapton, and toured from Scandinavia to 
Australia despite a fear of flying. He appeared on guitarist Buddy Guy's 
1994 Grammy-winning blues album, "Slippin' In."

Survivors include his wife, Frances, whom he married in 1989. He had

The US is:  "...a nation of 200 million used-car salesmen with all the 
money we need to buy guns and no qualms about killing anybody else in the 
world who tries to make us uncomfortable."
-Hunter S. Thompson

"Friend, hope for the truth while you are alive.  Jump into experience 
while you are alive!  What you call "salvation" belongs to the time before 
death.  If you don't break your ropes while you are alive, do you think 
ghosts will do it after?"
-Kabir

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the 
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become 
visible."
-Jacques Attali in his seminal text "Noise"

it was chunky beats, bows arrows, raver buckaroos, glowing cacti, beer 
rustlers and funki laptops. i was waiting for yul brenner to show up until i saw 
someone who i thought was him, but it just turned out to be plateshifter. `;)

cool decent vibe, non aggro like the surgeon shindig... can't wait till 
advent blows the roof. someone should force him to play that panther track when he 
comes around. i would go nuts.

Listen, DJ Slutfuck -- if that is your real name -- I realize not
everybody can appreciate my fantabulous vocabularizm. But I haven't
thrown parties for a good five years, so if you want to spin at my
parties, you're probably gonna have to find a time machine.

(And I don't mean a watch.)

I've got an Orgone Accumulator
It makes me feel greater
I'll see you sometime later
When I'm through with my Accumulator

It's no social integrator
It's a one man isolator
It's a back brain stimulator
It's a cerebral vibrator

Those energy stimulators
Turn your eyeballs into crators
But an Orgone Accumulator
Is a superman creator

It's no social integrator
It's a one man isolator
It's a back brain stimulator
It's a cerebral vibrator

I've got an Orgone Accumulator
And it makes me feel grater
I'll see you sometime later
When I'm through with my Accumulator

on friday nite, i work'd @ Levende lounge.

this is not so exciting except that i met Dead Seal.  he's got some
releases coming on coco machete and 2 other local labels.  he is also a
very nice person.

Landshark has been pushing this guy as of late and I hear he's the next
big thing out of SF.

some dirty tech house...keep your ears peeled.

Big ups' to Ben & Dave @ Mission-1/Acid Totem. Great vibe @ the beach on Sunday. Thanks for the BBQ chicken, beers, and beats! Great SF House made for a great day beach. Waterfall was dope- good choice for a location. 
 
Looking forward to Doc Martin / Jeno / Garth this Friday!
 
Peace

You should check bayraves. There is a huge thread about the promoters of 
that event raising prices up to $45. Some shady stuff went on this weekend.

Thomas Trouble, Simon Apex and a bunch of locals. No one worth $45 I can 
tell you that much. But all the raver newbies love our locals haha.

$45 for a party????  HAHAHAHAAHAH those stupid E's out ravers and
their parents money.  That's fuckin insane.  i mean it's Thomas
Trouble....he isnt worth the shit is just flushed down the toilet.=20
Wait I take that back, i would gladly save my shit just to throw it at
him and laugh as he trainwrecks every mix.  Then he can go sulk and
smoke some crack with his underage floozy's.  I'd pay a buck just to
spit on his face....hahahaha, those silly candy ravers and their lack
of what a good dj should be.  Anyone can pick up all anthem tracks and
drop em one after another with out mixing em very well, and those e'd
out candy ravers will eat it up like a honey-sucker in a porto-potty.

I could have sworn that guy was dead by now...or was that just wishful thin=
king?

Thomas Trouble is still alive and well, or at least, alive, and as
well as he was previously. I think the only mishap he's suffered
recently is that his pants were stolen.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] hello? is anybody out there?

I was @ Westworld Saturday night. Absorbed some tasty beats. I was most 
impressed with Freaky Chakra , who busted out some brand new beats for us, 
and played one of the best sets I've heard him play in the last year or so. 
Also, Boreta dropped some illy beats as well. I really enjoyed Tony Rohr's 
tracks, but his segues were a bit awkward at times. Chris Yap brought some 
reallllly ill shit too. I'm glad I finally got to see him spin, very nice 
work Mr.Yap!

All in all it was a nice time, surrounded by plenty of nice folks. Staying 
uber late and hanging with the crew was good times...I'm looking forward to 
the next shindig!

DimSum and XLR8R present:
THE ANDREA PARKER TOUR 
 
DJ and Live Sets From:

Andrea Parker (!K7, MoWax, Beggers Banquet, Touchin’ Bass)
Mochipet (DimSum, Tigerbeat6, Bpitchcontrol)
Forest Green (DimSum, SisterSF)
Sindri (DimSum, Imputor?)
Samira (SisterSF)

9pm, $10

Andrea Parker, known for her electro mixes and sublime
productions on !K7, MoWax, and Beggers Banquet is
headed stateside to support her own imprint Touchin’
Bass!

Parker has contributed to several experimental
electronic releases through out her career including
remixes for Depeche Mode, Ryuichi Sakamoto, and
Tipper.

Miss Parkers DJ style is uncompromising and crosses
all boundaries. She’s supported Radiohead on the US
part of their Kid A tour, experimented live on stage
with avant-garde supremos : Bang On A Can (Philip
Glass and Steve Reich) and provided more than a little
entertainment at parties for director Roman Polanski
and fashion house; Gucci.

Her popularity as a DJ was confirmed by the high sales
of her mix for !K7’s DJ Kicks series which showcased
the variety of her musical tastes; she’s not afraid to
fuse hip hop pioneers like Man Parish with electronic
pusher’s Gescom.

mmm... ecstacy... mmm ecstacy and underage floozies...  I'd pay 45 bucks to 
lick a frogs back... to listen to people train wreck, do ecstacy, and hang 
out with underage floozies, I'd probably pay two comma splices, a run on 
sentence, and three mispelled words.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Did anyone catch the party that Thomas was at last
 weekend?


I'd rather spend an evening with a bunch of stupid E'd out ravers and 
trainwrecking DJs than an hour with a bunch of stuck-up shitheads 
listening to chunky deep house at 110bpm mixed flawlessly with everyone 
getting drunk and talking about how hip they are. ;)

Give it a rest. Just because some of us got old and jaded and bitter 
doesn't mean the new generation can't have their fun with E and silly 
music too. :)

half this list's girlfriends?

this list has girlfriends?

Remember that the Hitler Youth was compulsory.

Sounds like the Catholic church got an even more conservative pope then
before.

Of course he is 78, and 30% of popes die within the first 6 months...

excellent movie with Nicole Kidman naked, which distinguishes it from
"Billy Bathgate," which is an awful movie with Nicole Kidman naked.
but, I advise everybody on this list to check it out, not just because
it features Nicole Kidman naked -- which should entertain the list
itself, multiple-girlfriend-having pimp daddy that it is -- but also
because it features Russian-language hip-hop, which, obviously, is the
wave of the future.

let's not criticize the Hitler Youth! I mean, who hasn't served Satan
before becoming Pope?

that's actually quite a resume, isn't it. star player on both teams.

of course 69% of all Catholic high school girls -- on second thought,
I won't go there.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Did anyone catch the party that Thomas was at last weekend?

I was kidding...but the worst part is, I've seen those.

;-p

I don't want to sound jaded or anything, but this list was once quite diffe=
rent.

actually I'll sound hella jaded. back in the late 90s O'Reilly did a
book on the evolution of the web, explaining how e-mail was basically
ill-suited to large group communication and that corporations
communicating important information via e-mail inevitably end up with
multiple versions of the same file distributed to multiple inboxes
with no version control, no clear understanding of who has which
version of what file, and generally all sorts of efficiency problems
caused by the use of an inefficient communications medium. the whole
point of this book was that web-enabled NNTP was a technologically
superior way of organizing corporate communications. sadly this book
has since gone out of print and I can't even remember what type of
animals were on the cover -- I think it was sea lions -- but the
validity of the insight is proven in that most new online communities
develop around Web forums rather than e-mail lists. I think this list
is inherently doomed to obsolence owing to the outdated nature of its
technological foundation, i.e., the fact that it is an e-mail list in
the first place, but like most on here I am still for some reason
hooked. (although I gotta tell you, it's not the chauvinism that
hooked me.)

in my defense, I tried to create an elegant replacement for the
existing bulletin board systems, which are generally both ugly and
clunky, but I got bored. online communication systems are hardly the
thrilling frontier they were ten years ago. instead I did this really
pretty sort of dynamically-generated Flash-based Frank Lloyd Wright
cellular automata art thing which I will post once I get my machine
back online and/or when I remember to do it.

ANYWAY.

movin on...

the downside to this whole thing is of course that $45 parties can
happen featuring people who we on this list had assumed had died or
moved back to Ireland or what have you. the upside is I can talk about
technologically sophisticated subjects for paragraphs at a time and
some of you motherfuckers will actually read the whole thing.

:-)

All true, Steve.  Although most everyone in Nazi Germany said they were 
compelled to participate :-)  Mystery to me how Hitler took and held 
power.  Magic?  Ratzinger left the Germany army in May, 1945, at, he says, 
"great peril to himself."  Well, by May '45 things were pretty much over, 
eh?  His formative years were spent in the Nazi educational and military 
system...there is no doubt of this.

On the other side of the "conservative" definition of Benedict, although 
I'm no longer a member of the RCC, I personally don't believe cafeteria 
ethics -- moral relativity -- is a good thing.  The Church is not a 
democracy :-)  I listened on NPR to some 19-year-old American's reaction to 
the  election of Cardinal Ratzinger with amusement:  "He's old and not 
relevant to the youth of today.  No, I don't know anything about him except 
he's old.  I really don't know anything about Church history before I was 
born."  I paraphrase a bit, but that pretty much sums up America, eh?

I left the Church because I could not adhere to the rules and much of her 
dogma.  I did not, however, expect that the RCC would change because I had 
a different world  view.  LOL.  Not relevant to me, I went elsewhere.

Love,

Apollo

The US is:  "...a nation of 200 million used-car salesmen with all the 
money we need to buy guns and no qualms about killing anybody else in the 
world who tries to make us uncomfortable."
-Hunter S. Thompson

"Friend, hope for the truth while you are alive.  Jump into experience 
while you are alive!  What you call "salvation" belongs to the time before 
death.  If you don't break your ropes while you are alive, do you think 
ghosts will do it after?"
-Kabir

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the 
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become 
visible."
-Jacques Attali in his seminal text "Noise"

Ok - 40 makes her hotter. I likes em older and aware of themselves.

Ol' Catherine Zeta Jones is a winner too - even if she humps a lizard.

moved back to Ireland or what have you. the upside is I can talk about
technologically sophisticated subjects for paragraphs at a time and
some of you motherfuckers will actually read the whole thing.

Damn was last night over the top..  John Tajada (sp?) was amazing.. his
beats hit so hard and had every body jumping so much that the boat threw a
second wake.. making it a kinda breakbeat float!  No, seriously.. it was
hella fun trying to dance while the waves were tossin everyone around.. but
if you timed it right you could do all these amazing spins coming up off the
floor and shit.. it was super fun.  The crowd was beautiful and a lot of
great energy was in that place.  Everyone getting hella drunk and peoples
all making out all over the place.. a little cheesy.. but in a fun spirited
way that made me happy to be on the boat again.  It has been three years
since my last sunset boat party.. way too long.. I finally got to hang out
with Manny (M3), and Laird who I hadn't seen in a few months, and hella
girlies that I knew from way back when.  So when it was over.. we were all
wobbly with sea legs and everyone had to learn to walk on land again.
*grin*

 

Bon Voyage!

Ranger

Subject: Re: [sfraves] LTJ Bukem & MC Conrad @ Ruby Skye Thursday

actually, at this point, i think 1015 is in better shape than Ruby
Skye.  the crowd has been getting better there, especially for the
breakbeat parties.

though i do know Ruby Skye is going to have some nice DnB talent
coming through.  and that's pretty refreshing.  and the fact that it's
on a thursday will probably mean that the people there will be there
for the music and not to be seen.

Subject: [sfraves] Intro/Hugger Mugger

Hi, I don't think I've posted here yet but I've been lurking for a  
couple of months. I'm Tim, I just moved to SF from DC. I know a few  
people on here already (mostly people who also moved from DC recently)  
but not too many.

I DJ (who doesn't?)...not as much as I used to but I'm hoping to change  
that now that I'm out here. Mostly I spin techno these days but I've  
been known to do hard house, acid, NRG, and hardcore in the  
past...anything with a lot of energy and an edge to it really. But on  
the other hand, lately I've been picking up more microhouse and  
Detroity style techno...maybe I'm just getting old. My website is still  
under construction, but here's a recent mix I did:

http://www.timresistor.com/Mixes/YearOfReflection/TimResistor- 
YearOfReflection.mp3


I haven't made it out to any parties here yet, but I was thinking about  
checking out Hugger Mugger tonight. Anyone else planning to go? Do  
people tend to get there early or late? If anyone wants to keep the new  
guy company, that would be great...

Subject: Re: [sfraves] LTJ Bukem & MC Conrad @ Ruby Skye Thursday

If I had $$ right now I'd go...even if it IS at Ruby Skye. LTJ Bukem always 
delivers a sweet set, and I like Donna Matrix & Smoove....so...

Alas, being broke as fuck prevents such luxuries.

Subject: RE: [sfraves] Intro/Hugger Mugger

Please welcome this guy properly folks. He's one of the nicest, brightest, 
and most positive folks I know from back in the DC area (and one helluva DJ 
to boot!).

I am glad to see more of the quality folks from back east making their way 
out here where it doesn't suck ass to be.

yup. was there.

out on the water.  not sure how'd i'd feel throwing a party there,
though.  those folks are doing a really good job on their events and
are doing them semi-regularly.

wouldn't want to ruin it for them.  the cops did come by this last
time, but only asked people to park their cars further away.  go

I'm playing closing set tonight at Hugger Mugger.  And I don't want you to 
decide now if you should go or not, but when the night eats at your brain 
and you wish you could be getting your head kicked in by some unhyphenated 
banging dance music at 12:30, I'll just be getting on... like I was 
waiting for you to get there.

 :P

And I'm really in the mood to play some techno... just finishing up here 
at work listening to some of the old Technostate ACN show archives and 
bouncing in my chair.

p.s.	Tim, bring me a mix cd.  You can doooo it.

Supreme Court to Review Ayahuasca Case
<http://en.groundspring.org/EmailNow/pub.php?module=URLTracker&cmd=track&j=27681995&u=251676>http://www.cognitiveliberty.org/dll/ayahuasca_index.htm
=============================================================

On Friday April 15, the US Supreme Court agreed to review an important case 
involving US members of the ayahuasca-using Uniao Do Vegetal (UDV) church. 
The CCLE's Richard Glen Boire is an expert on the legal issues concerning 
ayahuasca use and spoke about them live on the BBC Radio 5 on April 18, 
2005, noting that the case pits Freedom of Religion against the symbolism 
of the War on Drugs. Ayahuasca is not a drug of abuse, and has zero impact 
on the "drug war," whereas freedom of religion is one of the most cherished 
freedoms enshrined in the Constitution. During alcohol prohibition, 
religious users of wine (a drug far more habituating than ayahuasca) were 
exempted, and the CCLE maintains that a similar exemption ought to be 
recognized for the members of the UDV. Indeed, the Religious Freedom 
Restoration Act mandates such an accommodation. The case is Gonzales v. O 
Centro Espirita Beneficiente Uniao Do Vegetal, No. 04-1084.

CCLE Supreme Court Legal Brief Makes Waves
<http://en.groundspring.org/EmailNow/pub.php?module=URLTracker&cmd=track&j=27681995&u=251677>http://www.uakron.edu/law/lawreview/pdf/Schultz382.pdf
=============================================================

In 2003-4 the CCLE was an amicus party before the United States Supreme 
Court in the case of Sell v. United States. The case was successful, with 
Dr. Sell winning a bar on being force-drugged in an effort to make him 
legally competent to stand trial.  All evidence was that Dr. Sell was 
mentally competent and posed no danger to himself or others. In that case, 
our amicus brief argued that the First Amendment protects cognitive liberty 
- a right to integrity over one's own thought processes and underlying 
neurochemistry. A new law review article published by Elizabeth G. Shultz 
"Sell-ing Your Soul to the Courts: Forced Medication to Achieve Trial 
Competency in the Wake of Sell v. United States," 38 Akron L. Rev. 503 
(2005) cites the CCLE's brief and adopts our argument, noting: "In light of 
the seriousness of the First Amendment right to freedom of thought at 
stake, the Court should have recognized that no governmental interest can 
outweigh a person's right to freedom of thought, especially when the 
defendant is non-dangerous and charged with non-violent crimes." The 
complete article (in PDF format) can be obtained by clicking the above link.

American Journal of Bioethics Publishes CCLE Commentary
<http://en.groundspring.org/EmailNow/pub.php?module=URLTracker&cmd=track&j=27681995&u=251678>http://www.bioethics.net/journal/
=============================================================

The prestigious American Journal of Bioethics will be publishing an article 
by Richard Glen Boire in the upcoming issue. The article examines a new 
breed of brain-based lie detectors, and argues that existing Fourth 
Amendment jurisprudence is ill-equipped to deal with law enforcement uses 
of these devices. Richard's article argues that the notion of cognitive 
security would provide the missing legal concept, and ought to make 
nonconsensual use of such devices by law enforcement agents an 
unconstitutional "search" within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment. The 
article should appear at the above link later this month.

Cognitive Liberty at University of Pennsylvania
<http://en.groundspring.org/EmailNow/pub.php?module=URLTracker&cmd=track&j=27681995&u=251679>http://www.bioethics.upenn.edu/nubc/promotional.html
=============================================================

On April 1-2, Richard Glen Boire flew to Philadelphia where he spoke about 
cognitive liberty and gave a response to the keynote talk by renowned 
neuroscientist Dr. Michael Gazzaniga. The event was called "The Brain and 
Beyond: The 8th National Undergraduate Bioethics Conference," and brought 
together over 300 undergraduate and graduate students from 25 states and 7 
countries. Richard's talks focused on the need to update the legal notion 
of "freedom of thought" to include protections for autonomy and 
self-determination over one's own functional neurochemistry. Richard spoke 
with many of the attendees and with the other presenters about the way that 
a legal right to cognitive liberty and cognitive security would provide a 
framework for encouraging advancements in neuroscience and 
psychopharmacology, while advancing a legal principle that protects both 
those who want to say "yes" to using such technologies, and those who want 
to say "no." Check the above link for an eventual DVD and archived webcast

RGB guest on Science Today Radio Show
<http://en.groundspring.org/EmailNow/pub.php?module=URLTracker&cmd=track&j=27681995&u=251681>http://www.kdvs.org
===========================================================

On Tuesday March 29, Richard Glen Boire was a guest on the half-hour 
"Science Today" radio show on KDVS. KDVS is a college radio station 
broadcasting from Davis, California with mp3 podcasting programs archived. 
Richard explored the intersection of constitutional rights and 
psychopharmacology, ranging from the use of peyote in religious ceremonies, 
to future-coming drugs that will make it possible to manage one's memories 
- either boosting or attenuating them.

===========================================================

The April 2005 issue of URB Magazine carried an article on the way in which 
criminal drug prohibition actual drives the creation of new synthetic 
drugs. The article includes Richard Glen Boire's comments comparing the 
harms of today's drug prohibition with the harms produced by alcohol 
prohibition, and ends with a deeper critique of
the war on ecstasy:

Boire, continues and proposes a plausible theory: "There's a fear of
Ecstasy, not [just] the drug [by that name], but the experience, the
idea that people can have this autonomous joy that is not limited by
church protocols or socially-constructed modes. It's okay to be happy
when your team scores a touchdown in the Super Bowl, but it's
[considered] odd for people to be ecstatically dancing in fields."

Should Salvia Divinorum Be Made Illegal?

==========================================================
The Beaver County Times, a small paper in Pennsylvania reported on the 
CCLE's efforts to educate legislators in that state who are seeking to add 
the plant Salvia divinorum to the state's list of controlled substances. 
Unfortunately, it is unlikely that this misguided legislative effort can be 
forestalled because Salvia divinorum is just one among a group of 
substances named in the bill for control. For the latest news on this bill 
or on other legal threats to this plant visit

Yes on Child Medication & Safety Act
<http://en.groundspring.org/EmailNow/pub.php?module=URLTracker&cmd=track&j=27681995&u=251685>http://releases.usnewswire.com/GetRelease.asp?id=46015
==========================================================
Last year, the CCLE launched its "Choices for Children" campaign aimed at 
ending schools from conditioning a child's education on the use of Ritalin 
or other psychotropic medication. Today, April 19th, actresses Kirstie 
Alley and Kelly Preston will address the Florida Education Council on 
legislation (HB 209 and SB 1766) to prevent schools that receive state 
funding from forcing parents to put their children on psychotropic drugs as 
a condition of attendance in the schools, and to give parents the 
information they need to make an informed decision for their child's 
behavior problems. Although the issue of psychiatric child drugging is 
controversial, their message is straightforward, as is the CCLE's: "Give

The US is:  "...a nation of 200 million used-car salesmen with all the 
money we need to buy guns and no qualms about killing anybody else in the 
world who tries to make us uncomfortable."
-Hunter S. Thompson

"Friend, hope for the truth while you are alive.  Jump into experience 
while you are alive!  What you call "salvation" belongs to the time before 
death.  If you don't break your ropes while you are alive, do you think 
ghosts will do it after?"
-Kabir

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the 
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become 
visible."
-Jacques Attali in his seminal text "Noise"

Acid Totem Acid Test-

40 Years ago, Ken Kesey, author of "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" 
embarked on a psychedelic journey to Edge City. The first of what was to be 
many Acid Tests took place in Santa Cruz County in 1965. Ken Kesey and his 
clan of Merry Prankers initially spawned the framework for the psychedellic 
and counter culture revolution of the 1960's. Circa 25 years later, another 
revolution which fused music and elements of psychedelia was again 
happening in our beloved California. Doc Martin, Garth, and Jeno all played 
huge roles in putting the West Coast on the map throughout the 90's, laying 
the foundation for the next decade plus.

We invite everyone to celebrate all that is good among the old, and the 
new, and ask the question: Can YOU Pass the ACID TEST?

This shit's gonna be crackin'.  If you missed the last party, sucks for you. 
  Don't make the same mistake this time around.  A good jungle line up on 
one hand and a solid mixture on the other.  A DTS party is an investment in 
memories that last a lifetime.  I'll be there for sure.

--=====================_17537667==.ALT
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"; format=flowed

The Wesak Full Moon Eclipse on Sunday, April 24 ...Time for a Soul Recharge!

Wesak (the May full moon) has more spiritual energy around it than any 
other. All over the world Buddhists remember Siddartha, and the ability to 
communicate with higher levels of intelligence is sublime.

The Sun is in peaceful Taurus (think of Buddha under the Bodhi Tree) but 
the Moon is in Scorpio. Coupled with an eclipse, the energy is perfect for 
dumping every toxic thing in your life safely in to the ethers for 
recycling and healing. It's the perfect time to dance and let go.

Be willing under the Wesak Full Moon Eclipse to be washed clean, renewed, 
refreshed, restored and RECHARGED ... innocent again and ready for a new start.

Love,

Apollo

"Friend, hope for the truth while you are alive.  Jump into experience

-Kabir

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the

yea, that boat party was the craziest I have been too, off the hook....I 
took tuns of pics too, brought both cameras  ;)  After the boat, we roamed 
on over to Pink and the music was bumpin crazy there too...

highlights for me
"poison" by BBD
going under the GGate bridge
popping many a boat party people's cherries
Thomas the Cute guy
David the Funny Man
Ivan's dreddies
Layla's Slurring
Jessies Crutch
Darryl's 200$$ in drinking tickets
hell, all the cute guys

lol
it was a blast
:)

at home.  Be there for the debut event, featuring the label launch party
for progressive & tech-house imprint Railyard Recordings and all their
headlining artists, including...

In the Main Room:

Michael Thomas aka BLACKWATCH (Live)
Blackwatch is nothing short of a progressive phenomenon.  His skillful,
powerful productions have dominated the industry with over 50 releases and
remixes on such labels as Global Underground, Renaissance, HOOJ Choons,
Bedrock, YoshiToshi, Plastic Fantastic, Hope, SOG, Fade, Shinichi, Pitch
Black, and Ministry Of Sound. His recent smash hit "Gentle Rain" with
Greed went on to top major DJ charts all over the world in 2004.  And now
his current label home is Paramount Pictures, where he's opening up the
space within his legendary sound further than ever.

Justin Scott Dixon aka VOYAGER (Live + DJ)
Voyager's extensive body of work has been widely acclaimed throughout the
dance industry. His tracks and remixes have been licensed to heavyweight
CDs including Sasha's Global Underground San Francisco, and John Digweed's
GU:Los Angeles & 'Stark Raving Mad' compilations. Scott was one of the
first artists signed to Sasha's Excession label, and since then his music
has been released on Bedrock, Rhythm Syndicate, and Fire. He was also
chosen to remix John Digweed's Bedrock stormer, 'Beautiful Strange'. 
Today Voyager is forging a new sound in progressive: towering beats,
wide-open soundscapes, innovative melodic progressions, and SF is proud to
host the debut of his groundbreaking new material.

Plus be there early for an opening set by local hero Spesh (Looq, Qool,
Renaissance, Bedrock).  Come and welcome him back for his first solo set
at 1015 in years.


Upstairs:

Adam Collins aka OMNI AM
Since his emergence from the Chicago underground in the mid 90's, Adam
Collins has been instantly synonymous with the true underground Tech-House
movement in America, well before the upstart genre's emergence among the
transpotters as a cool musical buzzword. Adam owns and operates the
extremely influential Euphoria Recordings and has released on such labels
as Swag (uk), Big Chief (nyc), New Life, Crayon and Primal Recordings. He
has produced work with Uk tech house guru's Terry Francis, Eddie Richards,
and Grant Dell, and remixed such acts as Derrick Carter, Jay Tripwire and
Mr. C. His Dj'ng career brings him all over the globe with performances at
Crobar (Chicago), Arc/Twilo (NYC), Space and Concorde2 (UK). Today, Adam
in every way represents success in bringing the biggest sounds of the
globe to North American dancefloors.

plus Matt Xavier & Sean Detech aka GrUvHaUs  (LA/NYC - Railyard Recordings).


And in the front room:

Holdin' it down all night, local crews SOLIDSF and FunkyCozy, including
the supastars you know and love:

Jonathan Beech (FunkyCozy, Electrocelt)
D Spurlock (SolidSF, Clear)
Justin Corbett (Slow Motion Sequence, SolidSF)
Tim McCormack (FunkyCozy)

droppin' the funky, techy, progressive beats all night!


To sum up....

1965, Ken Kesey, author of "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest", and his
band of Merry Pranksters stage the first Acid Test; a radical and
psychedelic experiment based around music and lighting projections in
Santa Cruz County. Many Acid Tests would follow the Soquel Acid Test,
and would prove to be a major catalyst of things to come in the
counter-culture revolution of the 1960's. Circa 25 years later, a
different revolution was occuring on the Beaches and in the Deserts of
California. Under the watch of the full moon, DJ's such as Doc Martin,
and Garth and Jeno of the Wicked Crew introduced House and Electronic
music to thousands, and would lay the foundation for the West Coast
Sound for the next decade plus.

Join us as we celebrate all that is positive with the Old, the New, and
everything in between. Re-experience the pure and virgin energy that
helped create and build our House Nation.

Subject: [sfraves] Track ID [albeit a very fucked up one]

so, I was in IRC
and a friend of mine posted a disgusting link, as people tend to do in 
IRC... in this case, an animation of a dog engaging in relations with a 
naked woman.
it's disgusting .
but!  I really want to know what the song in the link is!  :s  it's very 
familiar, for some reason, and it's driving me nuts that i don't know 
it/can't remember it

the URL is dickcream.com/dog/

anyone know the track?
you *have* been warned, and I hope this doesnt count as spam :p

later

well, here's a quote that's pertinent to me in my life at this time.  ask me
about it in person some time over a cup of sicilian coffee.  they serve it in
little tins with the cup right next to it.  very classy.

have a good drive home and try not to listen to michael savage too much

Agreed.  the slot machine is ever so fun.

this is a good site.

contrast w/ http://www.drugfree.org/Teen/.  pics of sad looking kids and
nothing but horror stories like "Heroin killed my sister"  wtf???

c'mon, fire and brimstone doesn't work.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Track ID [albeit a very fucked up one]

I just want to say something about this.

Dogs have barbed penises. The barbs aren't sharp, they just keep the
dog's dick in the female dog to ensure maximum sperm dispersal.

If any of you ladies are considering fucking a dog, be aware that
every so often, a woman fucks a dog and the dog gets stuck inside her
because of the barbs -- human pussies aren't adapted to these things
and shit happens.

And the lady and the dog have to go to the emergency room, which is
funny, and sometimes the dog has to be killed, which is not funny.

So, ladies, be kind, be responsible, and don't fuck your dog.

This message brought to you by the holy shit dude how do you even know
that foundation for the prevention of tragically embarassing canine
death.

Subject: RE: [sfraves] Love Parade Berlin - Cancelled

i read in an article somewhere a while ago that the shut down was planned 
and that they were taking their time looking for a new space.  so hopefully 
no worries and they'll be back.  i hope so... i've never been.

Subject: [sfraves] NRR: Inside Sales position in South SF !!!

Hey all,

I was unemployed until about a week ago, and I'm still receiving some 
interesting job leads. I normally do Customer Service work, but was offered 
a really decent inside sales position today. I had to decline since I took a 
new job, but I figured someone out there might be looking for work.

This is INSIDE sales, so leads are already there, and alot of your work will 
be done for you. The position starts at $50K, plus full benefits, bonuses, 
stock options, 401K, etc.

Pretty solid. Located in South San Fran.

If you're interested, please reply to me off list and I'll forward you the 
contact info, etc.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Acid Test this Friday: Doc Martin, Jeno, Garth!

Hiya!
I went to this, and had a great time! Thanks :) Heres my review;
Ive only been to a couple things in SF, havent really had many
chances, but anyway..
Club Mighty is a decent space, easy to get to and good sized. Good
sound for a club, and it filled up well. I was happy to see a wide
range of groovers, and a lot of them dancing too. And how could you
not?? These DJs were GREAT! I dont know who played in what order, but
the first guy definetly got things moving, packing the floor with some
very danceable stuff. The second DJ played what I came to hear -
bumpin tracks *dripping* with 303 sounds - YUUM!! I couldnt sit down
if I wanted to, and I didnt want to :) The third guy was tearin it up,
dropping disco hooks through a bangin set. I had to leave after that,
but I could have danced all night. Thanks SF for the good time ;)

Love,=20
Lily

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

How do you feel about "Electric Guitars" in dance music?

My self I find electric guitars are a good tool to move a crowd. The new (Daft Punk) album use a ton of guitar loops in there newest album called "We Are Human" If have have not heard none of the tracks then you are missing out good French house music at its best. Much love goes out to (Daft Punk)  

I feel the more that people experiment with musical instruments with dance music. The more dance music will grow.

My self I play the Electric Bass Guitar as well as Electric Guitar & I would love to put my Bass Guitar into some of my mix sets. I think the more musical instruments in the dance music would leave it open to new ideas and sub styles such as (House Rock, Electric Trance) and so on. 

In my mind, when someone talks down on dance music saying it is crap. I just laugh at them and think about how far we have made it in the muisc world from Classical Orchestras to CD-DJ & Drum Machines. 


So let me hear your thoughts: D

Subject: Re: [sfraves] How do you feel about "Electric Guitars" in dance music?

It really depends how they're used.  I play bass in my productions and
live with my own djing and others (Andrew Phelan quite a bit), and I
also incorporate guitar and bass in the Cubik & Origami live show.

Raging distorted guitar wank soloing in a house track?  That can get to
me, for sure.  Otherwise, I say, it's just another sound source.  I
have house tracks that have 12 guitar parts in them, and if I didn't
tell you, you might not even know the parts are guitars- but the
instrument they were played on certainly "informed" what came out in
the end.

Bass is a little easier, because, well, everybody wants more bass. ;)

How can you leave out the fact that we beat down two drug dealers last

Subject: [sfraves] [skylab2000] a lovely story for you

Hi all, 

The next live skylab2000 show is in Nagasaki, Japan. Since most of you wont make it, I thought I'd just tell ya bit about Mexico last week. Kind of a one off blog kinda thing. Fun, huh? 

Mexico.. Well, at first, no one was there to pick us up from the airport. Bad start. I tried a few phone numbers I had, but my spanish didn't help much here. No luck, so we just decided to have a seat at a bar, and decide what to do. We popped open a couple of Tecatas and ate some chips. After an hour we did see a girl with a sign, that said "DJ Danny Barton", so that must have meant us. :) 

We got in the car and there was lot of fast spanish talking into cell phones and a lot of general confusion about the hotel, customs, money, soundcheck etc etc. Mayhem, but we finally made it to the location. 

Not the club I was told it would be at, but now was a nice outdoor club called Yabu. Cool. Set up, did a sound check, and realized that a very important synth wasn't working properly. No big deal. I was a repair tech in a prior career, so after a while of poking and prodding, we were back in biz. Must have looked funny seeing me onstage with a pocketknife and travel screwdriver trying to fix a synth, but ya do whatever it takes. 

It was a great event with a ton of people, and was very fun to play for such a large enthusiastic crowd. Was mobbed afterwards for chit chat and sign-me-here and sign this. Fun, but a bit scary when there was people completely surrounding me. Fun to be famous now and again, but being truly famous 24/7 would be quite weird. 

Anyhow, hit the afterparty hoping for a ride back, as we were abndoned yet again, but had a great time there with large group of wonderful and friendly strangers. It was at a large house, so we got a great chance to meet so many cool Mexican people. Big thanks to the unnamed girt that trusted strange Americans and drove us back! 

Was a very fun trip, and I'm sure Japan will be even more of an adventure! 

Hope you enjoyed this email.. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

There are still some summer dates open for skylab2000, so if you do a club or event, please contact us. Easy to have skylab2000 play at your event! 

Lastly, the new folks on this list haven't heard info on the $5 live skylab2000 CD available, so here's info: "LIVE BOOTLEG B001" is out now! For ten years we have secretly recorded skylab2000 live sets, and now we are excited to release some of these live tracks in a series of low cost CDs called LIVE BOOTLEG.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] How do you feel about "Electric Guitars" in dance music?

In general, it tends to swing to the severe end of the good/bad 
spectrum: It can exponentially amplify the energy of an already great 
track into something truly inspiring & innovating, or it can take a 
perfect good tune & send its momentum to a crashing halt. I think, like 
the addition of any instrument, it depends on the skill of the 
musician/deejay; Last year Baby Mammoth's "Sizzling Finch" successfully 
incorporated a clarinet into one of their songs, which I never even 
thought could be remotely possible in a techno song, let alone be 
really cool.

I dunno, I'm a bit of a sucker for any brass or woodwind instrument in house 
or techno - I like the organic feel it adds. But I'd agree with your opinion 
that guitar could make or break a track.

I saw SUN project in south frisco a couple months back. They were AWESOME.

In fact, I was probably at the same show as you stickman ;)=20

It was funny. The crowd would be bumpin and then the guitar would SLAM
in with this crazy repetitive riff and EVERY TIME the mob would leap
and howl and stomp. Elite.

Some sick ass drum and bass last night.
That impressed me.

What did not impress me:

The constant feeling of unease that followed me all night.
The blood in the bathroom.
The 12-person brawl in the hallway that shut the party down. (How is
it every time I go to that venue, now, a fight breaks out?)
The fuckawful sound setup in the main room. Poor Dyloot trying to spin
trance in there. :/

I had fun anyway. Everyone was hella crazy and drunk and I laughed a lot.=
=20
But still. As fun as it may be to get rowdy and beat up drug dealers,
do you really want people to remember your parties as brutally violent
and crazy? Being 'the other side' of rave culture doesn't mean you
have to cultivate the atmosphere of a gutter punk show.

thanks for all the feedback i think it is fucking really good to use new styles of music in dance :-) if anyone can get there hands on this track it is hot. i know for a fact Felix The House cat is banging this track Death_From_Above - Romantic Rights (Erol Alkan Remix) it is pure raw nrg on the dance floor :-) or just pick up MIXMAG and get the free cd that felix the house mixed for them :-) and if you are lucky you get to hear puff daddys house track. witch is not bad at all i can not belive felix da hosue cat made the beat for his track the song is called P Diddy - Jack U

My self I find electric guitars are a good tool to move a crowd. The new (Daft Punk) album use a ton of guitar loops in there newest album called "We Are Human" If have have not heard none of the tracks then you are missing out good French house music at its best. Much love goes out to (Daft Punk) 

I feel the more that people experiment with musical instruments with dance music. The more dance music will grow.

My self I play the Electric Bass Guitar as well as Electric Guitar & I would love to put my Bass Guitar into some of my mix sets. I think the more musical instruments in the dance music would leave it open to new ideas and sub styles such as (House Rock, Electric Trance) and so on. 

In my mind, when someone talks down on dance music saying it is crap. I just laugh at them and think about how far we have made it in the muisc world from Classical Orchestras to CD-DJ & Drum Machines. 


So let me hear your thoughts: D

I left that part out on purpose.  I don't like fighting and I think that 
it's lame that the dude sucker punched me in the first place.  I don't feel 
bad about beating them up, but I don't want people to look at us and think 
that we're shit disturbers.  We really are peaceful people who throw good 
parties with a good vibe.  I honestly don't think that we started any of the 
drama friday night.  It was a birthday party for a really good friend and 
people brought their drama in the party.  As far as the party went; it was 
off the chain.  As far as fighting, I'd perfer that never happen.  In any 
case, it was a crazy night that I'll never forget.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] ravemaster review

something weird is going on with BayRaves and DNS, so I'll just say
this here: violence leads to retaliation. some kid tried to jack me at
a rave, he put me in a half nelson and I just twisted out of it and
turned around and looked at him. I had been studying Tai Chi, if you
study Tai Chi you learn there's no such thing as an unbreakable hold.
so now I'm looking at this kid who tried to jack me. he was like a
foot shorter than me and fifty pounds lighter at least, but he was
black, and in America a black kid will be described as a "big black
guy" whether he's 8 feet tall or 4 feet tall. so I just stared at him,
like, you're black, you're a guy, but you're not a big black guy.
you're short, you're ten years younger than me, you have the physical
build of a willow tree, your unbreakable hold was very breakable, the
light you turned out I just turned back on, and now you're looking at
a large man from Chicago who isn't scared of shit. what are you going
to do? and he ran away. which realistically was a very sensible
choice.

I never laid a finger on him. I just showed him that my understanding
of fighting was infinitely superior to his, and then I stared him in
the eyes. and that was the worst thing that happened to him all night.
and he never had to beg anyone for mercy.

if these guys were seriously begging you not to hit them any more then
you should have stopped hitting them. there's a lot of people in
certain cultures who go around getting into fights so that women will
look at them. that's all there is to what they're doing. they don't
hit hard; in fact, when they get arrested, they look out for each
other. they lie to the cops and say, no, we weren't fighting. a dude
who thinks that way will go out in a gang to beat up some other dudes
from some other gang, but if the cops ask a guy from gang A if some
guy from gang B was fighting them, they'll say no. because the truth
is they're not really fighting at all.

if you're hitting somebody so hard that they're begging for mercy,
THAT is fighting. if you hit somebody and they're still standing
afterwards, that's not fighting. that's just look-at-me bullshit. it's
just a method of getting female attention.

it's a fucked up method, yes. but responding to violence with more
severe violence is not going to work. it's bad for the scene, it's bad
for your soul, it's bad for the world. use your strength to neutralize
violence, to see it coming and to defuse it. stooping to their level
only degrades your parties. if you're stronger than they are and
smarter than they are, use your intelligence to see their next move
before they make it, and use your strength to protect them from their
own stupidity. they are the weak and the foolish, and they are more
dangerous to themselves than they are to you.

hope your armpit heals OK.

vital vinyl and let it be were fantastic record shops!

let it be had a very diverse selection of music.  lots of house and
techno.  breaks selection sucked, but they did have a fair amount of
old soul and rnb.  good stuff!

vital vinyl had more breaks than any SF store i've been to so far.=20
really good selection.  i listened to maybe 60-100 records there.  and
brought home about a dozen.

didn't get out clubbing.  but did drink my ass off.

yay.

Just to explain to everyone how it went down..

I came in the room after these guys has already disrespect a female 
friend of ours and MC Fader was just sticking up for her. I had pushed 
fader out of the room and got him to calm down but the guys kept going 
on and on. One of them then punched me in the back of the head and I was 
only truing to break it up. They then threw a second punch at Joey and 
all hell broke lose. We did out very best to control the situation. This 
was about the 4th time that night these guys were caught trying to start 
a fight. We did not want anyone to get hurt and it sucks the night ended 
this way.

Sorry for the multiple posts.

Subject: [sfraves] Chemical Imbalance Lastnight

OK... so like lastnight was weeeeird.. Like I really didn't plan @ all on
going out... on the Real, I was just gonna stay home & hunt 4 a fuckin'
article 4 my Accounting Class that startts on Thursaday & it's close 2
impossible finding this article... anywqze, so liek I"m on IRC in a few
channels & some1 mentioned RAVE, SF in 1 of them & I started talkin' 2
this random person, who later I found out his name was Tien, & we went 2
Chemical Imbalace in the City...

It was fun...  I mean.. I dunno.. I kinda felt kinda giped when i fronted
$20 @ the door 2 get in.. but oh well.. I had fun!!!  Totally man.. it
good seein' alota people I raely get 2 C & hang out w/ them!!!

There wre 3 sets that really got me... Nick Niqul spun this really Groovy
Breakbeats set.... danced as much as i could in there.. The Doctor was up
next in that room.. Ooooh my gosh.. i been waiting 4 a Jungle set all week
to dance tooo... YUM!!  LoL.. He dropped NIN in the middle of his set.. it
was Aw3some!!  Hello 2Day...

OK.. i do have 2 say that Miss Dragnfly's set was SIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIICK!!! 
I LOVED IT!!!She started out playing like 80's Rock Tunes like a few song
by like Def Lepard, Iron Maiden, Glen Fry,  The Alman Brother.. It was
fun... then she went in2 some UK hardhouse & directly in2 Techno.. oh
man.. Hard Techno.. I Loved it!!!  OH gosh man.. then she spun some EVIL
ELECTRO CLASH & somehow beat matched Ghetto Tek to it!!!  It was fun!! 
Then she went in2 "Hard Dance"... all throughout the rest of her set...

While Dragnfly was playing she did a few cartwheels after like jumping
from up behind the decks on2 the dance floor kinda Ninja style!  It was
Dope.. 'cause they even like well this monkey bar swingie thingie like
appeard in the DJ booth & like did 1 of those jumped up, grabbed it swing
bar, then like lifted, turned herself so that she was hangin' on the swing
by her legs.. then she started like mixing upside down.. It was AMAZING!!!
All this done while she was in a hella cute ass pink Tutu.. then i
remember her training as a Trapeze artist w/ Cirq DeSoile which explained
alot!!

1 of the best sets I've ever seened like in my whole life!!

Unfortunately, there wre cops wating outside, which i learned earlier,
visited TheDungeon & walked around... apparetnly there's neighbor
complaints & la la la.. so the party kinda ended early...

It was a fun time.. but seriously, Tien who a totally Groover newbie 2 the
scene as well as SF.. he just moved here 2 months ago from NJ...

OK.. hope all is Groovy & y'all have a Dope Week!!!

LoL.. Fun Fun Stuff!

hmmm. well, I don't want to get in the middle of that. I could be all
preachy and tell you guys to kiss and make up, but I'm still pondering
killing somebody over a fight I had in 2000.


(note to any cops: I'm not really considering killing anybody.)


(note to the motherfucker I'm talking about, and you know who you are:
oh yes I am.)

For the Kids, A NextAid Benefit - 15 May, 2005 In loving memory of Wert Terry

In the long-heralded San Francisco tradition of supporting worthy causes, 
the house music community is responding to such shocking statistics as the 
fact that 95% of the 15 million children orphaned by AIDS are living in 
Africa, and is joining forces to make a difference around the world. This 
same community united last year in the first "For the Kids" which was 
inspired by "For the Love" (2002), an unprecedented community event that 
raised money to help Wert Terry, a beloved member of the community, in his 
fight against cancer and towards his daughter's education.

This year's "For the Kids" is presented by: Grayhound, Om Records, DJ 
Adnan, Zone AV, Sunset/Pacific Sound, Raindance, Green Gorilla, Nitevibe, 
DJ Seven, Tweakin', Anon Salon, Opel Productions, Spundae, Cloud Factory, 
staplemusic, and SFbyDEF.

Artists include: Miguel Migs, Jeno, Garth, MRK aka Markie Mark, Ellen 
Ferrato, Adnan, Andy Caldwell, Rick Preston, M3, Little John, Tracy, Galen, 
Solar, Joshua, Monty Luke, TK Disko, Fluid, Late Night Sneaky, Antonio, DJ 
Seven, Nikola, Fil Latorre, and Dr. D.R.E.

With support from: YBR Promotions, WorldDJ.com, flavorpill, SFSTATION.com, 
and * The Big Love Show * on 90.1FM KZSU Stanford, EmailLabs.com

NextAid is a Los Angeles based non-profit organization dedicated to 
creating sustainable solutions for African children orphaned as a result of 
AIDS. By partnering with other organizations in the production of music 
benefits and awareness-raising activities, NextAid channels emergency and 
long-term aid to African children in need. NextAid is committed to 
represent the international dance community as the charity promoting an 
effective and practical response to the AIDS pandemic NextAid aims to 
inspire people into tangible action, taking responsibility and making a 
difference.

Proceeds from the event will go towards the building of an earth-friendly 
multi-purpose center for Youth for a Vision, a non-profit organization 
comprised of teens mostly orphaned by AIDS who use theater and music to 
teach AIDS awareness to their peers, literally saving lives. This center 
will serve as a template for future centers throughout Africa. One of the 
center's buildings will be named after Wert Terry.

The PC and the Internet sprang from pot-smoking, acid-dropping California 
dreamers

The author even recounts how Apple founder Steve Jobs once told him that 
"taking LSD was one of the two or three most important things he had done 
in his life."

By John Markoff

VIKING; 310 PAGES; $25.95

----------
In the world of high technology, a visionary is a person whose obsessively 
held hunch happens to come true. For everyone else, fate holds either 
obscurity, or, for an unlucky few, habitual derision, as with Digital 
Equipment Corp. founder Ken Olsen, who has been unfairly held up as an 
example of technological cluelessness ever since he told a convention in 
1977 that "there is no reason for any individual to have a computer in his 
home."

A similar fate was courted by Xerox Corp. when it elected not to 
commercialize the Alto, a prototype personal computer invented at its Palo 
Alto Research Center (PARC) in 1973, almost a decade before companies like 
Apple, Radio Shack and IBM entered the PC market. In contrast, PARC itself 
would go down in business history as a nexus of farsighted West Coast 
researchers who were ignored by their buttoned-down East Coast masters.

John Markoff, a San Francisco technology writer for the New York Times, 
extends this visionary-centered narrative even deeper into the history of 
personal computing and the Internet. "What the Dormouse Said: How the 60s 
Counterculture Shaped the Personal Computer Industry" is an enthusiastic 
argument in favor of the idea that it was the uniquely Californian scene 
that brought forth the technologies we depend on so much today -- that the 
PC and the Internet sprang as much from a cultural environment of 
back-to-nature independence, personal freedom and psychedelic drugs as they 
did from engineering diagrams.

Based on the evidence Markoff presents, there is much to this. The most 
recent ancestors of modern PCs were the kit-based computers beloved by 
hobbyists in the mid-1970s (a favorite model was the Altair 8800), and one 
of the centers of the hobby movement was Menlo Park's own Homebrew Computer 
Club, founded in 1975 by peace activist Fred Moore. Homebrewers swapped 
software and components and advised each other on how to build computers 
from the ground up -- a do-it-yourself ethos with close links both to the 
Whole Earth Catalog phenomenon and to the ideas of radical educator Ivan 
Illich, who believed that technology should be limited to the human scale.

Homebrew was in turn an outgrowth of the storefront-based People's Computer 
Co. (PCC), which played a vanguard role in selling hands-on computing time 
and training to anyone who walked in off the street. PCC was one expression 
of the era's general reaction against corporate power, which in the world 
of computing was symbolized by the "glass house": the room in which the 
central computer was kept, attended by its priesthood of operators. For 
frustrated scientists and hackers, the notion of having a computer 
dedicated to an individual was immensely attractive. As Ted Nelson declared 
in his influential 1974 manifesto, "Computer Lib/Dream Machines," computing 
should be available to all, "without necessary [sic] complication or human 
servility being required."

2 new rap tracks:

1.  California Love (up north remake)     The original gangsta beat candyflipped to meet NorCal
standards: Mendocino County, Thomas Ballantyne, OtherWorld, Pacific Sound System, and the
boulevards of Oaktown.

2.  Run Honkey Run.   East Oakland battle rapper treads on the wrong turf.


I've been dubbing this CD with remixed INSTies from "Nothing Left But the Future".  Your A Idiot"
has been remixed with a delicious car accident, even smaller penises, more rednecks, and some
fresh guitar loops.   

Oh yeah, also this MC called Barni who rips it up on the mic,  a colleague of mine.  The chic is
real.  She laid down the digital dust in her first-ever session, and did a fine job. 

Snail me.  Name street town zip.

The thing that comes to mind is the remix of Yes'
Owner of Lonely Heart that's playing a lot right now. 
Personally I don't like this track but YMMV.  I
actually met Jon Anderson at the Cat & Fiddle in
Hollywood one night during the production of the Yes
album 90125.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] How do you feel about "Electric Guitars" in dance music?

i started doing live mashups of that song about 3 years ago. 
granted, it didn't go over as nicely as i wanted (real-time
drummer made it difficult) but it was worth it to see the
shocked expressions on peoples' faces.  most didn't like it:
pretty similar to the response to my techno mashup of
starship's "we built this city".

speaking of "owner of a lonely heart", a friend of mine once
played that song at DVC, wearing a suit made entirely of meat.

Subject: [sfraves] (nrr) Quote of the Day (Tue)

last night, a friend of mine told me a funny horror restaurant horror story,
something we've all had at one time or another.  this one is right out of a
movie it seems like though.

he was at this lazy south carolinan diner having some lunch with a few
friends.  no brand name diner, just something like suzy's diner or whatever.
his friend was drinking his iced tea and suddenly discovered there was a fly
in the drink.  they called the waitress over, and guess what the waitress
did?  you guessed it!  she came right over there, stuck her hand in the
glass, pulled the fly out, and said "is that good enough for you?"  he said
they were laughing their asses off right after that.  this was around lunch
time.  i asked them if they left after that and he said he wasn't sure, he
thought so.

do you have any funny restaurant horror stories that sound like they came
out of better off dead or some comedy movie?  let us know!

you mean seize the disturbing the peace half-naked day, right? not the
getting shot through the heart day? bkz I've already seized that day
and it sucked.

if you're talking about getting arrested for disturbing the peace
half-naked, that's a pretty good day to seize. I can definitely see
where you're coming from.

Subject: [sfraves] What is SFRaves? (That 'Ol Vision Thang)

In the seven years of my volunteer work and responsibility to this 
community, as well as the 13 years I've followed SFRaves & Hyperreal.org: 
This has always been my inspiration as well as my guide, this is the 
vision I hope that SFRaves is to this community. SFRaves is a beautiful 
gift to all of us, let its future be bright, positive and a dream turned 
into reality. <3 Karina

>From the FAQ located @ http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/sf/doc/whatis

In the wise words of Brian Behlendorf, SFRaves Founder:

"...
Subject:
A little of that ol' VISION thang.
From: bbehlen@soda.berkeley.edu (Brian Behlendorf)
Date: Fri, 2 Jul 1993 11:14:36 -0700
To: sfraves@soda.berkeley.edu

I'm not sure exactly what form this post is going to make, it's gonna come 
out pretty stream of conscious-like, but then again everything I've ever 
written here has been stream of consciousness so I'm not worried. Just 
giving you warning to bear with me.  In fact, now that I've written it and 
like it, I'll add a PLEASE READ THIS, NOW.

 	*what* is SFRaves?

 	The idea mainly came out of frustration with my situation back in 
March 1992.  I had moved up from LA the previous fall, where I had been 
going out once a week to parties down there, and when I moved up here I 
found myself completely out of touch with what was going on.  I heard 
about one called ToonTown, tried to go to it, but alas found out after 
waiting an hour and a half in line at King St Garage that it was 21+, 
something I had never run into in LA.  I had heard about parties here and 
there, but never could find anyone who even liked the music enough to want 
to venture out and check them out.  I also feel in love with the Internet 
at this time, and I saw a post from a certain Jon Drukman mentioning the 
Woopy Ball on the Manchester mailing list, and another post from someone 
on rec.music.industrial about a local party.  I figured there HAD to be 
SOME people on the net who knew what was up around here, so I asked the 
sysadmin of my machine if I could run a mailing list and he said sure.

 	Within a week we had 80 subscribers.  The Woopy Ball was the first 
weekend, and I met Jon and Mike there, and Andrea, and it began to click 
that maybe there were quite a few people on this; and I began to become 
really good friends with many of you, which was completely different from 
my college social environment in which I found most people rather cold and 
self-absorbed.

We held a picnic in May, and it clicked that here we had an incredible 
group of people who have this elusive thing called a "vibe"... and I began 
to feel like family with you, and with the list at large, and I began to 
be less and less inhibited about what I post, who I talk to, everything. 
It's like someone said, it feels like the community of SFRaves have always 
existed, it just took an entry in an aliases file to bring us all 
together.

 	And then we threw Connection, which, until the day I get married 
and/or the day I die, will rank as the most intense experience I have ever 
had.  It was the feel of a community putting on a party, where everyone 
felt GOOD, where we felt like we were leapfrogging into a future full of 
warmth.  It was a personally very transformational thing for me, and I 
think the same is true for many others.

 	It was also the beginning of my journey into the realm of becoming 
someone in the SF House Music culture.  I found a group of people I really 
liked being with; I also found that our method of communication could be a 
model, a basis for something bigger.  Even as we were having the time of 
our lives, we began to identify things in the scene, and even in the 
world, that we wanted to see changed.  SFRaves became a channeler for 
memes, for emotions, for expressions on what house culture is and how San 
Francisco is/could be the center of it all.

 	Now, you could say I got stars in my eyes... but I don't think it 
was unjustified, and I know many people felt the same way too.  I didn't 
feel and still don't feel like I was responsible for it, I was just the 
janitor of this majestic House.

 	The cycles of life, though, ebb and flow, and as high as SFRaves 
ever got, there were low points too, points where I wanted to send a 
message to the list saying "UNSUBSCRIBE" or even consider shutting it down 
for a day or two to calm some peoples' nerves.  I ultimately resisted the 
urge, mainly because I believe the list could self-check itself, for every 
low the people would wake up and give it a high, etc.

 	However, this cycle concerned me because I was afraid (and still 
am) that this cycle could affect our ability to spread and enhance the 
vibe.  I wondered if this was just an expression of insecurity, if I 
really could define the "vibe" anyways.  I saw a huge procession of people 
subscribe and then unsubscribe within days... my rational side said ignore 
this, SFRaves shouldn't and can't please everyone, but my emotional side 
wanted SFRaves to serve as a basis for uniting people and engendering that 
"family" feel we all had at the beginning, towards the scene as a whole.

 	There are still lots of sicknesses in the scene, perhaps more now 
than ever, and if we could playa part, by spreading ideas and memes and 
opinions around for everyone to share, that we COULD make the scene 
better.  I wanted to include everyone on this - I was actively working to 
get the promoters I know hooked up in one way or another to share in this 
Great Experiment, because communication is the main thing I felt was 
missing in the scene. The Come/Unity meetings of promoters and DJs and 
concerned folk enhanced this, and I could see barriers of distrust being 
shattered.  I wanted to bring that to the electronic realm, and them to 
us, because I feel the synergy would just be incredible.

 	This is still a dream right now.  There are a few promoters on the 
net, some more vocal than others, there are a few DJ's, there are a LOT of 
people who go out and spread the vibe, and we are known as an entity by 
many if not most people in the scene.  The calendar you see every Thursday 
is going to have an "official" status, as a way for promoters to plan 
their schedules out and try and avoid massive clumping of parties around 
certain weekends.  In other words, we are making inroads.

 	But sometimes we stumble.  I haven't been communicating this dream 
as much over the net as I should have; I'd talk about it to others outside 
the scene, we'd become excited about the possibilities, and then we'd come 
home and read our email and get discouraged at times.

 	But there's no way I'm gonna give up that easily.  I *know* I'm 
not alone in this dream, and for the most part I think SFRaves has had 
that spreading-the-vibe effect for awhile.  But we have so much POTENTIAL 
I want to see used.  Right now the most vital thing the scene needs is 
COMMUNICATION, people need a forum for expressing their views and for 
listening and understanding each other.  Right now the many-to-many nature 
of email mailing lists is the single most powerful format for this. 
Let's use it right - let's take the concept of love, peace, harmony, and 
RESPECT for each other back into our lives and spread it.  I'm going to 
work this summer on making the SF scene the most wired scene on the planet 
(it already is, I'm gonna make it even more so), and watch the fireworks 
fly.  Sure, we'll always have our ups and downs, and I still want people 
to talk about ANYTHING they feel like talking about while still providing 
a high-qualityhigh signal-to-noise-ratio mailing list.

 	Remember that when you send mail to sfraves@hyperreal.org you are 
sending personal mail to about 500 people.  That is an awesome power for 
such a subtle action.  Please don't abuse it - use it freely, but just 
think about what you're saying for a second.  If it's something more 
appropriate in personal email, take it there.  But if it's something we 
all can learn from, by all means bring it forward.

 	SFRaves and the fractalizing threads that have led from it are the 
most significant thing that's ever happened to me.  I know most other 
people aren't going to go to THAT level of enthusiasm but I want people to 
feel what I'm feeling.  This "dream" I have of making SFRaves a powerfully 
positive force in the scene is nebulous, and we may never know if we've 
ever gotten there, but I think as long as we keep it in mind a lot of good 
can come about.  In fact, the medium has so much potential it is our 
RESPONSIBILITY to see this happens.  I've seen so much over the past month 
and a half of my travels that has led me to think we tend to take our 
scene for granted a lot, and its almost become a victim of its own 
success.  Let's not let that happen.

 	See you all at Connection 3!!

 	Brian

*sigh..*

Why, why, oh why, did I wait 'til 1999 to go to a rave?  (especially
when I'd been actively making "rave" music since '96 or '97?)

Looking at glowing texts like these really makes me feel like I missed
out on something really important.  My time in the scene, while short,
most certainly has been sweet..  ..but I think, by the time I got here,
most folks were over this whole "change the world" thing.

big effin' *sigh*

Oh well, at least the people I've met have been wonderful and I can't
complain in the least about my life..  Just wish I'd have taken notice
when those friends of mine started buying RECORDS of all things back in
the early 90s, instead of writing them off as stupid kids listening to
annoying "techno" music. ;)

Subject: Re: [sfraves] What is SFRaves? (That 'Ol Vision Thang)

i wish i'd listened to this girl in my high school yearbook class back
in 1992 in southern california.

she was telling me about "raves" and "techno" and i just couldn't wrap
my head around the concept.  i was really curious and wanted to go,
but i was a pussy and couldn't break out of my shell.

i can't imagine what my life would be like if i'd gone to a party in
LA in 1992.  better?  worse?  who knows!

Subject: Re: [sfraves] What is SFRaves? (That 'Ol Vision Thang)

I like and admire Brian Behlendorf but I've seen this fucking e-mail
so many fucking times. what is he, the pope? this thing was written 12
years ago.

in nomine patrum, et filii, et spiritus sanctum :-p

1993 was an astonishing year for anyone with a computer, a brain, and
a love of electronic music, but for fuck's sake, it's 2005. some of
the kids you see at raves were BORN on the day this e-mail was sent.

!!!!!!

(sorry, I'm always a bit cranky before breakfast.)

if you meet the Buddha on the road, kill him.

hero worship is stupid. Brian Behlendorf didn't have the power to turn
back the hordes of MBAs who took over our little internet cultural
revolution thing and turned into the biggest scam until Enron. he's
just a guy. he's a cool guy. he's a smart guy. but he's just a fucking
guy. some cool shit that was right on the money in 1993 doesn't belong
in my inbox in 2005!!!!!!!!!!!!

definitely cranky. time for breakfast.

but if I have breakfast, I'll probably have to go to work.

OK, fuck it. I'll compromise. I'll have some coffee, and I'll continue
my tirade.

hold on.

**makes coffee**

**watches Invader Zim**

**plays drums**

**watches QBert DVD, attempts scratching**

**stalks the Tigger sluts**

holy shit.

are you people still HERE?

look. if there's something you find fascinating, if there's something
you love, if there's some memory from the past that you still adore,
take that vibe forward into the future for fuck's sake. the past is
the past. carpe diem or shut the fuck up. :-)

yeesh.

I went to Medusa's in Chicago when I was 17. I played dance music on
the radio when I was 16. I made beats on a Korg M1 when I was 15. This
was Chicago, late 80s. Worship my hairy balls.

Actually with all of that I still didn't go to my first rave until 97.
But that was still 8 years ago!!!!!!!!! Jebus.

(ps worshipping my hairy balls is not actually necessary.)

seriously all you do is this. look into the past. take the bits you
love, put those bits in your future. take the bits you hate, xerox
them, write the lesson you learned on the xerox, throw the original
away. take the bits you wish you had, the things you wanted, the
things that should have happened or could have happened or maybe would
have happened, and put those right smack dab in the middle of your
future so that you are heading straight towards them. and baddabing
baddabang, you're fucking DONE.

SO given the fact that this was sent out as an impetus, let's rephrase the 
question.

What *is your definition* SFRaves ? (2005)

I concur with many of the things said, this isn't so much about 
worshipping the past as it is taking bits and pieces of it, reflecting on 
it at present, and looking towards the future.

-&e->	*what* is SFRaves?

-&e->	The idea mainly came out of frustration with my situation back in
-&e->March 1992.  I had moved up from LA the previous fall, where I had been
-&e->going out once a week to parties down there, and when I moved up here I
-&e->found myself completely out of touch with what was going on.  I heard about

-&e->never run into in LA.  I had heard about parties here and there, but never
-&e->could find anyone who even liked the music enough to want to venture out
-&e->and check them out.  I also feel in love with the Internet at this time,
-&e->and I saw a post from a certain Jon Drukman mentioning the Woopy Ball on
-&e->the Manchester mailing list, and another post from someone on
-&e->rec.music.industrial about a local party.  I figured there HAD to be SOME
-&e->people on the net who knew what was up around here, so I asked the sysadmin
-&e->of my machine if I could run a mailing list and he said sure.
-&e->
-&e->	Within a week we had 80 subscribers.  The Woopy Ball was the first
-&e->weekend, and I met Jon and Mike there, and Andrea, and it began to click
-&e->that maybe there were quite a few people on this; and I began to become
-&e->really good friends with many of you, which was completely different from
-&e->my college social environment in which I found most people rather cold and
-&e->self-absorbed.
-&e->
-&e->We held a picnic in May, and it clicked that here we had an incredible
-&e->group of people who have this elusive thing called a "vibe"... and I began
-&e->to feel like family with you, and with the list at large, and I began to be
-&e->less and less inhibited about what I post, who I talk to, everything. It's
-&e->like someone said, it feels like the community of SFRaves have always
-&e->existed, it just took an entry in an aliases file to bring us all together.
-&e->
-&e->	And then we threw Connection, which, until the day I get married
-&e->and/or the day I die, will rank as the most intense experience I have ever
-&e->had.  It was the feel of a community putting on a party, where everyone
-&e->felt GOOD, where we felt like we were leapfrogging into a future full of
-&e->warmth.  It was a personally very transformational thing for me, and I
-&e->think the same is true for many others.
-&e->
-&e->	It was also the beginning of my journey into the realm of becoming
-&e->someone in the SF House Music culture.  I found a group of people I really
-&e->liked being with; I also found that our method of communication could be a
-&e->model, a basis for something bigger.  Even as we were having the time of
-&e->our lives, we began to identify things in the scene, and even in the world,
-&e->that we wanted to see changed.  SFRaves became a channeler for memes, for
-&e->emotions, for expressions on what house culture is and how San Francisco
-&e->is/could be the center of it all.
-&e->
-&e->	Now, you could say I got stars in my eyes... but I don't think it
-&e->was unjustified, and I know many people felt the same way too.  I didn't
-&e->feel and still don't feel like I was responsible for it, I was just the
-&e->janitor of this majestic House.
-&e->
-&e->	The cycles of life, though, ebb and flow, and as high as SFRaves
-&e->ever got, there were low points too, points where I wanted to send a
-&e->message to the list saying "UNSUBSCRIBE" or even consider shutting it down
-&e->for a day or two to calm some peoples' nerves.  I ultimately resisted the
-&e->urge, mainly because I believe the list could self-check itself, for every
-&e->low the people would wake up and give it a high, etc.
-&e->
-&e->	However, this cycle concerned me because I was afraid (and still
-&e->am) that this cycle could affect our ability to spread and enhance the
-&e->vibe.  I wondered if this was just an expression of insecurity, if I really
-&e->could define the "vibe" anyways.  I saw a huge procession of people
-&e->subscribe and then unsubscribe within days... my rational side said ignore
-&e->this, SFRaves shouldn't and can't please everyone, but my emotional side
-&e->wanted SFRaves to serve as a basis for uniting people and engendering that
-&e->"family" feel we all had at the beginning, towards the scene as a whole.
-&e->
-&e->	There are still lots of sicknesses in the scene, perhaps more now
-&e->than ever, and if we could playa part, by spreading ideas and memes and
-&e->opinions around for everyone to share, that we COULD make the scene better.
-&e->I wanted to include everyone on this - I was actively working to get the
-&e->promoters I know hooked up in one way or another to share in this Great
-&e->Experiment, because communication is the main thing I felt was missing in
-&e->the scene. The Come/Unity meetings of promoters and DJs and concerned folk
-&e->enhanced this, and I could see barriers of distrust being shattered.  I
-&e->wanted to bring that to the electronic realm, and them to us, because I
-&e->feel the synergy would just be incredible.
-&e->
-&e->	This is still a dream right now.  There are a few promoters on the
-&e->net, some more vocal than others, there are a few DJ's, there are a LOT of
-&e->people who go out and spread the vibe, and we are known as an entity by
-&e->many if not most people in the scene.  The calendar you see every Thursday
-&e->is going to have an "official" status, as a way for promoters to plan their
-&e->schedules out and try and avoid massive clumping of parties around certain
-&e->weekends.  In other words, we are making inroads.
-&e->
-&e->	But sometimes we stumble.  I haven't been communicating this dream
-&e->as much over the net as I should have; I'd talk about it to others outside
-&e->the scene, we'd become excited about the possibilities, and then we'd come
-&e->home and read our email and get discouraged at times.
-&e->
-&e->	But there's no way I'm gonna give up that easily.  I *know* I'm not
-&e->alone in this dream, and for the most part I think SFRaves has had that
-&e->spreading-the-vibe effect for awhile.  But we have so much POTENTIAL I want
-&e->to see used.  Right now the most vital thing the scene needs is
-&e->COMMUNICATION, people need a forum for expressing their views and for
-&e->listening and understanding each other.  Right now the many-to-many nature
-&e->of email mailing lists is the single most powerful format for this. Let's
-&e->use it right - let's take the concept of love, peace, harmony, and RESPECT
-&e->for each other back into our lives and spread it.  I'm going to work this
-&e->summer on making the SF scene the most wired scene on the planet (it
-&e->already is, I'm gonna make it even more so), and watch the fireworks fly.
-&e->Sure, we'll always have our ups and downs, and I still want people to talk
-&e->about ANYTHING they feel like talking about while still providing a
-&e->high-qualityhigh signal-to-noise-ratio mailing list.
-&e->
-&e->	Remember that when you send mail to sfraves@hyperreal.org you are
-&e->sending personal mail to about 500 people.  That is an awesome power for
-&e->such a subtle action.  Please don't abuse it - use it freely, but just
-&e->think about what you're saying for a second.  If it's something more
-&e->appropriate in personal email, take it there.  But if it's something we all
-&e->can learn from, by all means bring it forward.
-&e->
-&e->	SFRaves and the fractalizing threads that have led from it are the
-&e->most significant thing that's ever happened to me.  I know most other
-&e->people aren't going to go to THAT level of enthusiasm but I want people to
-&e->feel what I'm feeling.  This "dream" I have of making SFRaves a powerfully
-&e->positive force in the scene is nebulous, and we may never know if we've
-&e->ever gotten there, but I think as long as we keep it in mind a lot of good
-&e->can come about.  In fact, the medium has so much potential it is our
-&e->RESPONSIBILITY to see this happens.  I've seen so much over the past month
-&e->and a half of my travels that has led me to think we tend to take our scene

ECSTASY'S LOST 'ITS PANACHE' AMONG TEENS

Ecstasy was the "it" drug among certain teens and young adults for a few 
years beginning in the late 1990s: a feel-good, dance-all-night stimulant 
that was a driving force behind rave parties that featured pulsating, 
melody-free music.

But after peaking in popularity in 2001, Ecstasy isn't so cool anymore.

Tighter airport security since the 9/11 attacks has pinched the flow of 
the drug into the USA from chief suppliers in the Netherlands and Belgium, 
making it less available and more expensive.

Meanwhile, federally funded anti-drug campaigns have produced poignant TV 
spots warning that Ecstasy users risk brain damage or death.

Teens and young adults have taken note.  Last year, 57.7% of high school 
seniors said they believed that taking Ecstasy just once or twice could 
harm them, up from 33.8% in 1997, according to an annual survey of teen 
drug use by the University of Michigan.

Mike, a 24-year-old musician from Long Island, N.Y., who didn't want his 
last name published because he is in drug treatment at Phoenix House in 
Ronkonkoma, N.Y., says he used to go to raves where Ecstasy was popular. 
But he says he stopped two years ago, after seeing "younger and younger" 
ravers get so high that "they would get incapacitated and lie there like 
dust."

Ecstasy is "just not new anymore," says Mark Brandl, executive director of 
DanceSafe Org, a New York-based group that works to prevent drug abuse 
among recreational users at nightclubs and raves.  "It's lost its .  .  . 
freshness, its panache."

Moving on to Other Drugs

The bad news, says Lloyd Johnston, chief investigator for the Michigan 
study, is that some teens appear to have moved on to drugs that are less 
expensive, more available and potentially just as dangerous.

The use of highly addictive prescription painkillers such as OxyContin and 
Vicodin has jumped since 2000, and both drugs have become more popular 
than Ecstasy among high school seniors, the Michigan study reported last 
year.

More than 9% of high school seniors said they had used Vicodin during the 
previous year, the study said, a level of popularity that roughly matched 
that of Ecstasy when it was at its peak four years ago.  About 5% of 
seniors said they had used OxyContin in the previous year, compared with 
4% who said they had taken Ecstasy.

When drug researchers at Michigan first started tracking OxyContin and 
Vicodin abuse among teens in 2002, many users tended to steal small doses 
from their parents' medicine cabinets.  "Trail mixing" parties -- where 
teens would mix pills in bowls and then hand them out randomly - -- gained 
popularity, according to the Community Epidemiology Working Group, 
researchers who report drug-use trends to the National Institute on Drug 
Abuse.

Teens also have gotten prescription narcotics from Internet pharmacies 
that sell such drugs illegally.  This week, agents with the Drug 
Enforcement Administration ( DEA ) and other agencies broke up an alleged 
drug ring that is accused of illegally selling more than 2.5 million pills 
a month via the Internet.

Some Internet pharmacies allow any teen with a credit card to order 
narcotics without a prescription.  Even after a big markup by sellers, the 
drugs often are cheaper than Ecstasy.  The price for Ecstasy varies; in 
some cities it can cost as much as $30 a pill, the DEA says.

Safer Than Street Drugs

Teens also perceive prescription drugs as safer than street drugs such as 
heroin and cocaine, Johnston says, adding that many teens don't appear to 
recognize the risks of abusing prescription drugs, or to understand that 
OxyContin is in the same drug family as heroin.

"The increases ( in prescription drug abuse ) aren't dramatic, but I find 
the absolute levels -- one in every 20 ( seniors having tried OxyContin ) 
-- disturbing," Johnston says.  "If I told you that 5% were using heroin, 
I think you'd go screaming into the night."

( Nearly 1% of high school seniors said last year that they had used 
heroin in the previous year, the Michigan study said.  )

Opening Door for Inhalants

Ecstasy's demise also appears to have cleared the way for a rise in teens' 
use of inhalants.

They were a problem a decade ago, before public health campaigns that 
warned of the damage they could cause to a person's brain and nervous 
system helped to dramatically lower usage among teens.

Now, a new generation of teens unfamiliar with those dangers is 
experimenting with inhalants, Johnston says.

Overall, the percentage of seniors who said they had used any illegal drug 
in the previous year dropped from 41.4% in 2001 to 38.8% in 2004, the 
Michigan study said.

Marijuana remains the most widely used illicit drug; last year 34.3% of 
high school seniors said they had used it in the previous year.

Ecstasy is difficult to make here because the U.S.  government monitors 
the necessary chemicals and it licenses pill-pressing machines.  Canada 
and the Netherlands do not license pill-pressers, and such chemicals are 
more available in the Netherlands.

Before 9/11, Ecstasy smugglers from Europe faced little scrutiny at U.S. 
airports.  They could move thousands of pills at once in suitcases or 
strapping packets to their bodies.

"It was coming right from Europe into ( John F.  Kennedy International 
Airport in New York ) in every way possible," says Dean Boyd, spokesman 
for Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

In fiscal 2002, customs and border agents seized a record 4,633 pounds of 
Ecstasy pills, up about 12.4% from the previous year.  That changed in 
2003, when Ecstasy smugglers began to avoid airports.  The amount seized 
that year dropped by more than 77%.

At the same time, Ecstasy's presence in the USA declined, suggesting that 
some drug rings scaled back their operations or simply gave up trying to 
send Ecstasy here.

Meanwhile, investigators' pursuits of Ecstasy distributors are beginning 
to pay off.  U.S.  and Canadian agents last year busted a smuggling ring 
that allegedly accounted for about 15% of the Ecstasy in the USA.

A DEA analysis later found that the average price of an Ecstasy pill 
jumped in several cities.  In New Orleans, undercover DEA agents paid an 
average of $17.50 a pill, up from $10.50.

MMM ecstacy. It's been a few years since I felt that rush.

So according to this article the US Is winning the war on drugs and all
drug users are turning to more dangerous forms of getting high or
spending more money (which increases crime).

Yeah, Marc said she seemed fairly non interested overall..

Apparently he spelled his name for her no less than four times (at her 
request, no less), and she still got it wrong..

Among other misquotes.. but still  .. the article (while skipping over the 
fact that less arrests/hospital visits and the "always reliable" high school 
questionaires does not necessarily make less use) does have a point in that 
people are taking up more and more "non norm" drugs.

Interesting thought..

I was *NEVER* polled about drug use in high school.. and no one Ive ever 
asked locally has either (sacramento) ...  Where the hell are these high 
school quesitonaires coming from?

I love the melody-free part of that article.

Apparently they've been listening to too much jungle. :-P

In framing a government which is to be administered by men over men the great
difficulty lies in this: You must first enable the government to control the
governed, and in the next place, oblige it to control itself.

>>But he says he stopped two years ago, after seeing "younger and younger"
>>ravers get so high that "they would get incapacitated and lie there like

>>
>>Ecstasy is "just not new anymore," says Mark Brandl, executive director of
>>DanceSafe Org, a New York-based group that works to prevent drug abuse
>>among recreational users at nightclubs and raves.  "It's lost its .  .  .

>>
>>Moving on to Other Drugs
>>
>>The bad news, says Lloyd Johnston, chief investigator for the Michigan
>>study, is that some teens appear to have moved on to drugs that are less
>>expensive, more available and potentially just as dangerous.
>>
>>The use of highly addictive prescription painkillers such as OxyContin and
>>Vicodin has jumped since 2000, and both drugs have become more popular
>>than Ecstasy among high school seniors, the Michigan study reported last
>>year.
>>
>>More than 9% of high school seniors said they had used Vicodin during the
>>previous year, the study said, a level of popularity that roughly matched
>>that of Ecstasy when it was at its peak four years ago.  About 5% of
>>seniors said they had used OxyContin in the previous year, compared with
>>4% who said they had taken Ecstasy.
>>
>>When drug researchers at Michigan first started tracking OxyContin and
>>Vicodin abuse among teens in 2002, many users tended to steal small doses
>>from their parents' medicine cabinets.  "Trail mixing" parties -- where
>>teens would mix pills in bowls and then hand them out randomly - -- gained
>>popularity, according to the Community Epidemiology Working Group,
>>researchers who report drug-use trends to the National Institute on Drug
>>Abuse.
>>
>>Teens also have gotten prescription narcotics from Internet pharmacies
>>that sell such drugs illegally.  This week, agents with the Drug
>>Enforcement Administration ( DEA ) and other agencies broke up an alleged
>>drug ring that is accused of illegally selling more than 2.5 million pills
>>a month via the Internet.
>>
>>Some Internet pharmacies allow any teen with a credit card to order
>>narcotics without a prescription.  Even after a big markup by sellers, the
>>drugs often are cheaper than Ecstasy.  The price for Ecstasy varies; in
>>some cities it can cost as much as $30 a pill, the DEA says.
>>
>>Safer Than Street Drugs
>>
>>Teens also perceive prescription drugs as safer than street drugs such as
>>heroin and cocaine, Johnston says, adding that many teens don't appear to
>>recognize the risks of abusing prescription drugs, or to understand that
>>OxyContin is in the same drug family as heroin.
>>
>>"The increases ( in prescription drug abuse ) aren't dramatic, but I find
>>the absolute levels -- one in every 20 ( seniors having tried OxyContin )
>>-- disturbing," Johnston says.  "If I told you that 5% were using heroin,
>>I think you'd go screaming into the night."
>>
>>( Nearly 1% of high school seniors said last year that they had used
>>heroin in the previous year, the Michigan study said.  )
>>
>>Opening Door for Inhalants
>>
>>Ecstasy's demise also appears to have cleared the way for a rise in teens'
>>use of inhalants.
>>
>>They were a problem a decade ago, before public health campaigns that
>>warned of the damage they could cause to a person's brain and nervous
>>system helped to dramatically lower usage among teens.
>>
>>Now, a new generation of teens unfamiliar with those dangers is
>>experimenting with inhalants, Johnston says.
>>
>>Overall, the percentage of seniors who said they had used any illegal drug
>>in the previous year dropped from 41.4% in 2001 to 38.8% in 2004, the
>>Michigan study said.
>>
>>Marijuana remains the most widely used illicit drug; last year 34.3% of
>>high school seniors said they had used it in the previous year.
>>
>>Ecstasy is difficult to make here because the U.S.  government monitors
>>the necessary chemicals and it licenses pill-pressing machines.  Canada
>>and the Netherlands do not license pill-pressers, and such chemicals are
>>more available in the Netherlands.
>>
>>Before 9/11, Ecstasy smugglers from Europe faced little scrutiny at U.S.

>>strapping packets to their bodies.
>>
>>"It was coming right from Europe into ( John F.  Kennedy International
>>Airport in New York ) in every way possible," says Dean Boyd, spokesman
>>for Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
>>
>>In fiscal 2002, customs and border agents seized a record 4,633 pounds of
>>Ecstasy pills, up about 12.4% from the previous year.  That changed in

I was always cool with that song "Everybody, be somebody!" (the techno
song, not the lady singing hip hop song).

or=20

Messiah - temple of dreams.

Or

Speed racer.

Orbital comes to mind also.

Can you tell that I grew up listening to Live105's Steve Master's mixes?

Subject: Re: [sfraves] How do you feel about "Electric Guitars" in dance music?

I stand corrected  :-)

Hell your lucky that I could even remember that much! Most times I only 
catch the label or color. So I walk around saying "You know that Yellow 
record" Or that one with the "boom clanky" bassline.

:P

I'm relieved to hear that kids are now using heroin and permanently 
damaging mental function by sniffing inhalants.  My nephew started with 
Oxycontin at 12 and moved on to needles.  WOD has made pot, E and other 
relatively innocuous drugs too expensive for the average kid so they find 
other things.  Hell, glue sniffing was  so popular when I was growing up 
that they locked airplane glue away in hobby stores.  So you ordered it by 
mail.  Thank the heavens cheap shake became abundant then or I wouldn't be 
typing this email :-)

We get the country we deserve, eh?

As for drugs,


Ask Dr. Andrew Weil

I'm sending this note to remind you that best-selling author Andrew Weil, 
M.D., and I will be online for an audio web chat on the revised and updated 
editions of <http://actioncenter.drugpolicy.org/ctt.asp?u=488&l=90538>From 
Chocolate to Morphine: Everything You Need to Know About Mind-Altering 
Drugs and <http://actioncenter.drugpolicy.org/ctt.asp?u=488&l=90539>The 
Natural Mind.

Before Dr. Weil became known to tens of millions for his pioneering work 
and writing on integrative medicine, he was already highly regarded for his 
insightful writing about drugs. His first book, The Natural Mind, is one of 
the greatest books ever written about psychoactive drug use. It played an 
important role in shaping my thinking on the subject, and is widely 
regarded as a classic in the field. As for Chocolate to Morphine, which 
Andy co-authored with Winifred Rosen, there is simply no better drug 
education book -- both for young people and adults.

Dr. Weil will be online to address your questions on a range of topics. 
Please email <mailto:questions@drugpolicy.org>questions@drugpolicy.org to 
submit questions, and don't forget to bookmark the chat address!

When: Thursday, April 28, 2005, 3 PM PST / 6 PM EST
Where: 
<http://actioncenter.drugpolicy.org/ctt.asp?u=488&l=90529>http://www.drugpolicy.org/news/041205weilchat.cfm

Read on for further information about Dr. Weil and myself:

About Andrew Weil:

Recognized as one of the world's most influential people by Time magazine, 
Andrew Weil, M.D., is a world-renowned leader and pioneer in the field of 
integrative medicine. He is also a clinical professor of medicine and the 
founder and director of the Program in Integrative Medicine at the 
University of Arizona in Tucson. He is an expert in the traditional use of 
mind altering substances and the different effects of various legal and 
illegal drugs.

Dr. Weil is a best-selling author whose books include Spontaneous Healing; 
8 Weeks to Optimum Health; Eating Well for Optimum Health; The Healthy 
Kitchen; The Natural Mind; The Marriage of the Sun and Moon; Health and 
Healing; Natural Health, Natural Medicine; and From Chocolate to Morphine: 
Everything You Need to Know About Mind-Altering Drugs. His new book, 
Healthy Aging: Your Lifelong Guide to Physical and Spiritual Well-Being, 
will be available in October 2005. Andrew Weil, M.D., also authors the 
popular Self Healing newsletter, a monthly column for Prevention magazine, 
and is the editorial director of DrWeil.com, the leading online resource 
for healthy living based on an integrative medicine philosophy.

I am the founder and executive director of the Drug Policy Alliance, the 
leading organization in the United States promoting alternatives to the 
"war on drugs." I've spent many wonderful hours with Andy over the years. 
It will be a real pleasure to have you join our conversation.

Kansas?

hahaha, well.. I guess thats why the numbers seem so skewed...

Kansas doesnt seem to represent the majority of the "at risk" population... 
most coastal cities/states fall into that category..

Interesting spin.. poll the places where its less likely to happen to get 
better numbers..

Course, Im just theorizing here.

And here the great mystery unravels. Let's face the facts:
 
1) Someone apparently called P.O. (like that? sounds like B.O.) a "Homo"
 
2) Word got back to P.O., who makes over 6 figures an hour and has more money than God. 
 
3) P.O., being the insecure homophobe he is (this happens with Mamma's boys sometimes), decided to find out who's talking shit on a global scale. 
 
4) P.O. Hires these assholes to spam everyone and their mom that might even know what a dj is to give the culprit a chance to fess up & make a public apology before he flies over here and kick's some Yankee ass. 
 
5) Bring it on, P.O., but first, please, brush your teeth & take a shower. 
 
so there
 
Chuck

skewed towards what?  increased meth and coke use most likely.  the midwest

oh, i see what you're saying now - you want to propagandize MDMA use has

'Generation Rx' Label Dazzles Media




By Maia Szalavitz, STATS
Posted on April 26, 2005, Printed on April 28, 2005
http://www.alternet.org/story/21876/

The Partnership for a Drug Free America released its latest survey on teen 
drug use last week, prompting the usual almost-verbatim press-release 
reporting and expressions of being "shocked, shocked" about "kids today" 
from the media.

Almost all of the coverage picked up the Partnership's label "Generation 
Rx," so named because nearly one in five of this group of adolescents 
reported having used the opioid Vicodin without a prescription. In the 
third paragraph of its story, the AP included a quote from the 
Partnership's chairman which said, "For the first time, our national study 
finds that today's teens are more likely to have abused a prescription 
painkiller to get high than they are to have experimented with a variety of 
illegal drugs."

But this is only the second time prescription drug use has been included in 
the survey -- and it was at the same level when they measured it for the 
first time, last year. The AP story (which was picked up by CNN, among many 
others) buried this information in its last two paragraphs, along with the 
fact that far more kids used marijuana than prescription drugs.

So, it's not only not the first time that prescription drug use has been 
this high, it's also not true that kids use more prescription drugs than 
marijuana. Where's the news, and where's the truth in the quote? If this is 
only the second year that prescription drug use has been measured, the fact 
that the level is higher than for cocaine and ecstasy doesn't provide much 
information about whether this is a new or ongoing phenomenon.

That's the news here -- but reporters seem to be dazed to see it.

The US is:  "...a nation of 200 million used-car salesmen with all the 
money we need to buy guns and no qualms about killing anybody else in the 
world who tries to make us uncomfortable."
-Hunter S. Thompson

"Friend, hope for the truth while you are alive.  Jump into experience 
while you are alive!  What you call "salvation" belongs to the time before 
death.  If you don't break your ropes while you are alive, do you think 
ghosts will do it after?"
-Kabir

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the 
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become 
visible."
-Jacques Attali in his seminal text "Noise"

Subject: [sfraves] NRR: 30th Anniversary of the Fall of Saigon

Article by my friend's unble in Philly.  Tomorrow is the 30th
anniversary of the fall of Saigon.


--
It was 'our last hope'

Thirty years ago today, Inquirer director of photography Hai Do was
among hundreds of thousands of people frantically trying to flee South
Vietnam as the North Vietnamese entered Saigon. Many died on boats or
drowned. Many were caught and sent to "reeducation camps." His story
follows.

All I could see were the thousands of hollow eyes looking in despair
as the cargo vessel slowly pulled away from its berth along the Saigon
River. This moment, so calm and so quiet, was punctured nightly when I
woke up, breaking out in a sweat, after seeing that a pair of those
hollow eyes were my own.

For years after the fall of Saigon on April 30, 1975, the scene played
out every night in my sleep as a reminder of how close I came to being
left behind as communist forces entered the city.

I was 17 at the time. The Vietnam War had existed for my entire life.
It had also existed for my parents' entire lives. Born and raised in
North Vietnam, they moved to the South as the Geneva Convention in
1954 divided the country. The division ended up splitting family
members who took up arms fighting for communism in the North and
nationalism in the South.

My father, Hoe, joined the South Vietnamese army and rose to the rank
of major in artillery. The only times we ever saw him were at army
hospitals nursing his wounds or at special family occasions. One time,
he arrived at a cousin's wedding in battle fatigues, carrying the
smell of gunpowder and the red dirt of Pleiku. Everyone paused as he
entered the room.

Life went on in and around Saigon while soldiers like my father fought
battles in An Loc, Ban Me Thuot and Tay Ninh. My older sister, Thuy; a
younger brother, Vu; and I would head off to school six days a week as
our mother struggled daily to bring home food.

But the war took a turn in 1968.

Vietnamese believe that whatever you do for Tet, the New Year's Day of
the lunar calendar, will shape your fortune for the year. My father
would come home as both sides of the conflict stopped fighting. There
would be new clothes to wear, more food to eat, and lucky money to
spend. We would celebrate with firecrackers to scare off the ghosts of
the past and the evils of the future.

On the morning of Tet in 1968, the sound of firecrackers turned out to
be the sound of gunfire. Communist forces broke the traditional
cease-fire and staged surprise attacks in every community in the
South.

Hiding in the alley in front of our house on the edge of Saigon,
communist soldiers attacked the headquarters of the South Vietnamese
armed forces with batteries of machine guns.

As a fire started to spread, we had to leave our hiding place, our own
home. I was about 11, but I could never forget that moment of having
to walk through the gauntlet of communist soldiers to flee the coming
fire.

I held on to my mother's arm, looked straight ahead, and kept
reminding myself, "If I make myself so small, they're not going to see
me and they're not going to shoot me."

A few years later, on my way to school, I said hello as usual to the
uniform cleaner by the railroad tracks, waved to the owner of the
motorcycle repair shop, and passed the old man who was always sleeping
on the sidewalk in front of the cinema. As I continued on my way, a
time bomb detonated, collapsing the theater's facade onto the
sidewalk. Somewhere underneath was the old man I had seen only moments
earlier.

By the spring of 1975, the North Vietnamese army was advancing at a
breakneck pace.

The Vietnamese broadcast from the BBC described the scene of South
Vietnamese soldiers taking off their uniforms to flee from the
highland. My father was one of the soldiers who escaped and came home.

As communist forces closed in on Saigon, planeloads of well-connected
Vietnamese took off hourly from the Tan Son Nhut air base near our
home.

President Nguyen Van Thieu broadcast his farewell address blaming the
Americans for losses, and took off. Gen. Nguyen Cao Ky crisscrossed
the city calling for troops to defend the motherland, then flew away
in his own plane.

On the morning of April 29, we were awakened by loud explosions as
shells landed at the air base.

My dad held Diem, my 2-year-old sister, in one hand and grabbed one of
my three brothers in the other. Mom clutched the two others while my
sister Thuy and I took our 72-year-old grandmother, and we departed
our home.

With every burst of gunfire echoing, my father hollered at us to pick
up the pace. My grandmother mumbled about how fruitless it was to even
bother running. I could see rows of helicopters flying overhead. And I
could hear the noise of rotary blades shaking everything in sight.

But I was not prepared for what I saw ahead in downtown Saigon. There
were men with eyes bulging and weapons waving. There were women
sobbing and children crying for anyone to latch on to.

A sea of humanity was pushing, shoving, punching and screaming toward
the U.S. Embassy, at least five blocks away. For the first time in my
life, I was terrified. I snatched glances from the corner of my eyes,
afraid that the men would empty their weapons if I dared to look them
in the eyes.

My father changed our course to Bach Dang naval base on the other side
of the city, hoping that we could get on board a naval vessel. The
crowd in front of the base was small enough to afford a view of the
gate. We quickly found out why as bursts of gunfire overhead sent
everyone cowering on the pavement. Our own soldiers were firing at us
to protect their way out!

Our last hope was fading as we started heading south ahead of the
communist forces marching in from the north. Low-flying jets fixing on
targets around the city drowned out the noise of helicopter blades.
Then, the loudest explosion imaginable shook the earth below my feet.

An orange ball of fire shot up in the sky ahead, followed by another.
The oil reserve tanks in Nha Be exploded, sending up columns of fire
and smoke.

And right there in front of us, a black cargo vessel was boarding.

A single man with arms outstretched on the ramp was pushing against a
tidal wave of humans desperate to board. With my dad in front, we
pushed and pulled and shoved and clutched one another until all of us
were aboard. We forced our way to the hold of the cargo vessel and
joined the exodus of boat people fleeing Vietnam.

The Truong Xuan was a 60-foot vessel designed to navigate the Mekong
River. As the tide turned against South Vietnam, its owner and a group
of paid passengers had organized the maiden voyage to the high seas to
escape. They were not prepared for the waves of refugees forcing their
way aboard.

The first two days on board without food and water, I still had enough
energy to roam about and found two bags of flour tucked away in a
corner. With a tin can attached to a string, I fetched seawater and
mixed it together with the flour. How hard could it be to make some
bread? I persuaded the boat owner to bake it in the oven. The result
was a clump of white powder burnt on the outside. I did not get
through even the first bite.

A lasting image was of my father walking around the boat with the limp
body of my sister Diem. She was dehydrated after two days at sea. He
begged and begged until someone gave her some water and food. My
father dipped his finger in the cup of water, and put it in her mouth.
He repeated it over and over and then shared what was left with our
family. Then, he would pick Diem up again and go to a different family
to beg some more.

Overcome by hunger, I faded into my corner of the world, a door frame
leading to the deck below, where every step had been claimed by a
fellow refugee. The boat was so crowded, no one had room to lie down.

After seven days, the Truong Xuan was found. American warships were
stationed off the coast of South Vietnam to pick up refugees escaping
by anything that floated.

I was barely conscious when my father and a sailor propped my head up
to pour some liquid into my mouth. It tasted like milk. I hated, still
hate, milk. I proceeded to drink the whole container and asked for
more. I revived. My little sister survived as well.

The warships escorted our vessel to the Philippines. We arrived at the
harbor at Subic Bay after midnight on the ninth day with only the
twinkle of lights visible.

With his arm around me, my father talked about our lives, our hopes,
and our future. Then he pulled out a pistol that he had carried on the
battlefields, on the run, and on the boat, and dropped it into the
sea.

Happy Happy Joi Joi saturday.  Not to touch off another series of
anticore rants. ;)

My boy crackerjack is spinning that night. Unfortunately, they bumped
him to an early timeslot... if any of you are going, go early. Seeing
danny serenade a group of underaged raver whores to happycore gets me
right *there*.

UNLEASH YOUR INNER KRAKEN

When they've had enough rum, the old-timers tell 
the tale of the last voyage of the Jiggletech, 
a noble submarine. Weighing anchor, she drifted from 
port and set out in search of the Other World, an 
undersea grotto of kinky pyramids and giant pearls.

  Dom (FnF)

Fearing the pleasures this might unleash, a squadron
of black helicopters intercepted the vessel on the
horizon's edge. The good ship dove for the ocean floor
as depth charges rained down from the sky! Relentless 
sonic pressures pounded her hull with each detonation,
discharging waves of unending acoustical force. 
Her hatches battened, her bulkheads sealed, 
the Jiggletech drifted deeper.

Beyond the reach of sunlight, the Jiggletech
found herself embraced by the coiling tentacles
of a radiant squid. Gently, this leviathan
deposited its catch on the sandy sea bottom.

  The Band (live)

Having jaws but no gills, the submarine's divers
ventured curiously out through the hatch, snorkles 
in hand, masks and tanks at the ready. What they 
found was no inky abyss; all around them were
Nereids, Neptunes and shape-shifting sea-nymphs -- 
a deep water garden of coral and bubbles, 
beautifully lit by the phosphorescence of the 
benevolent squid.

Scuttling her butt in this clamshell of love,
the Jiggletech never returned.

UNLEASH YOUR INNER KRAKEN

When they've had enough rum, the old-timers tell 
the tale of the last voyage of the Jiggletech, 
a noble submarine. Weighing anchor, she drifted from 
port and set out in search of the Other World, an 
undersea grotto of kinky pyramids and giant pearls.

Fearing the pleasures this might unleash, a squadron
of black helicopters intercepted the vessel on the
horizon's edge. The good ship dove for the ocean floor
as depth charges rained down from the sky! Relentless 
sonic pressures pounded her hull with each detonation,
discharging waves of unending acoustical force. 
Her hatches battened, her bulkheads sealed, 
the Jiggletech drifted deeper.

Beyond the reach of sunlight, the Jiggletech
found herself embraced by the coiling tentacles
of a radiant squid. Gently, this leviathan
deposited its catch on the sandy sea bottom.

Having jaws but no gills, the submarine's divers
ventured curiously out through the hatch, snorkles 
in hand, masks and tanks at the ready. What they 
found was no inky abyss; all around them were
Nereids, Neptunes and shape-shifting sea-nymphs -- 
a deep water garden of coral and bubbles, 
beautifully lit by the phosphorescence of the 
benevolent squid.

well, sorry 'bout that folks, but i guess it's not on after all, due to

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Phillip K. Dick

I saw discussion of this on barbelith a couple weeks ago ... if any of
you haven't read it, a scanner darkly is an /awesome/ book. It's about
drug culture in the realest sense: paranoia and insanity followed by
betrayal and more insanity. Everyone's nuts and everyone's scared and
nobody can be trusted. A parody of the schizophrenic state of a narc
... I can't do it justice with words. I am not Phillip K Dick.

Really. Read this book. See this movie.

see it already?  that bad?  I am not a huge fan of the book but when Adam's
official biographer says it sucks big time....   it looks too eye-candyish 
and one can
sort of tell from the promos (how they're put together) that it probably 
isn't great

Friends and I saw "Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy"'s midnight opening 
here in Santa cruz. It was great fun for all of the huge audience, most 
of us longtime fans, just as Douglas Adams wanted it. His "official 
biographer" is just full of sour grapes. Go see it and see what you 
think and THEN let's have some discussion of it here!

Saw it, loved it.  Since every incarnation of the guide is different,
the movie stuck closer to the book than I thought it was.  Loved the
imagery, the vogons were great, marvin was awesome, Ford, Arthur, Zaphod
and Slarti all met up to my expectations and all the cameo's from the
old TV series were good too.  The only character that suffered from
Disney producing the movie in my opinion was Trillian.  Personally I
think DA would've been proud of the movie.  They didn't change much from
his original screenplay either.  Of course I've also been waiting for
this since 1986 when I first read the books at 8 years old.  I only have
3 gripes with the movie, the new symbol for the guide when the green guy
has been the staple icon forever, superficial details about the
portrayal of Zaphod (physical not character traits.. Although, the fact
they made him talk and act like george bush was a nice touch) and a yet
to be talked about storyline since the movie just came out and I don't
want to spoil it. As a movie I'd give it a 7 - 7.5 out of 10.  Since
most sci-fi isin't 10 quality with a rare exception, I'd give it a 9.5
in meeting my expectations as to how this movie should've been done.

just a thing, real quick. "true to the book" doesn't mean shit. when
the books came out people were complaining that the books weren't true
to the radio show.

the "Hitchhiker's" books were based on "Hitchhiker's" the radio show.
in England radio shows are a drama format as established as movies,
television, and books. the radio show came first, and believe me, it
is better than the books, better by orders of magnitude, and although
I'm sure this movie is good, it'd have to be good as a motherfucker to
be even half as good as the radio show.

plus, the radio show is the best source of quality samples in the
history of human endeavor, outclassing even The Muppet Show.

(and I have Muppet chickens singing "Babyface" on vinyl.)

long story short, if you like "Hitchhiker's" at all, on any level, in
any way shape or form, get the fucking radio show on CD as soon as you
can.

you will be glad you did.

--=====================_6720733==.ALT

Beltane



Beltane, or May Day, is one of the Great Sabbats of the Wiccan calendar. Of 
the four Great Sabbats, Beltane is one of the most important, second only 
to Samhain (Halloween). Beltane is chronologically opposite of Samhain, 
splitting the year evenly. Most Wiccans celebrate the holiday on May 1st, 
however by Celtic reckoning, the actual celebration begins on sundown of 
April 30, because the Celts always figured their days from sundown to 
sundown. Like many covens around the country, we find that our lives are 
often too busy, and one or more of us will be unable to meet together on 
that actual first of May (we affectionately call this phenomenon 'Pagan 
Standard Time'). In this case, we hearken to Mike Nichols who wrote:



"By the way, due to various calendrical changes down through the centuries, 
the traditional date of Beltane is not the same as its astrological date. 
This date, like all astronomically determined dates, may vary by a day or 
two depending on the year. However, it may be calculated easily enough by 
determining the date on which the sun is at 15 degrees Taurus (usually 
around May 5th). British Witches often refer to this date as Old Beltane, 
and folklorists call it Beltane O.S. ('Old Style'). Some Covens prefer to 
celebrate on the old date and, at the very least, it gives one options. If 
a Coven is operating on 'Pagan Standard Time' and misses May 1st 
altogether, it can still throw a viable Beltane bash as long as it's before 
May 5th. This may also be a consideration for Covens that need to organize 
activities around the week-end."



Naturally it's always better to celebrate on the actual day, but sometimes 
one simply cannot help circumstances, unlike our ancestors who's entire 
village planned their lives around the ancient holidays.



The word 'Beltane' is derived from the Irish Gaelic 'Bealtaine' or the 
Scottish Gaelic 'Bealtuinn', meaning 'Bel-fire', the fire of the Celtic god 
of light (Bel, Beli or Belinus). He, in turn, may be traced to the Middle 
Eastern god Baal. Bonfires were often lit for this holiday, and leaping the 
fire was a custom thought to encourage the crops to grow as high as the 
leaper could leap the fire. These fires, also called 'need-fires' were 
thought to have healing properties, thus we have the tradition of 
'sky-clad' (naked) witches leaping the fire to ensure protection. Other May 
Day customs include walking around one's property ('beating the bounds'), 
repairing fences and boundary markers, processions of chimney-sweeps and 
milk maids, archery tournaments, morris dances, sword dances, enacting the 
'Robin Hood' story, feasting, music, drinking, and maidens bathing their 
faces in the dew of May morning to retain their youthful beauty.



Perhaps one of the most misunderstood traditions of Beltane is the custom 
of free sexuality on this night. For a long time after the Christian form 
of marriage (and it's strict rules of sexual monogomy) had replaced the 
older customs of handfasting, those strict rules of monogomy were relaxed 
for the May Eave rites. Called 'greenwood marriages', in which young men 
and women who spent the night in the forest and brought back boughs of 
flowers and garlands to decorate the village in the morning, were 
especially condemned by the Puritans. Many a young woman would come back 
pregnant from these romps in the woods, and such children were referred to 
as 'merry be-got'.



These wildwood antics have inspired writers such as Kipling:

Oh, do not tell the Priest our plight,
Or he would call it a sin;
But we have been out in the woods all night,
A-conjuring Summer in!



And Lerner and Lowe:

It's May! It's May!
The lusty month of May!...
Those dreary vows that ev'ryone takes,
Ev'ryone breaks.
Ev'ryone makes divine mistakes!
The lusty month of May!



The maypole is, of course, one of the great symbols of May Day. It is a 
part of that fertility symbolism that is so much a part of this holiday. It 
is most often refered to as a phallic symbol, joined with the Goddess in 
holy sexuality. These days there are many people who whose sexual path 
makes them uncomfortable with this imagery, and because of this they choose 
not to celebrate the maypole. This is too bad, since the maypole is a 
powerful and moving experience, and is not limited by personal sexuality 
choices... for instance, one could view the pole as the Tree of Life 
instead of a phallic symbol. To join ourselves by ribbons of the colors 
representing different aspects of life to this sacred Tree, one can work 
just as powerful magick as the other person who views the pole as the more 
sexual phallic symbol.



The aspect of Goddess represented at Beltane is the Maiden, called Maya, 
Maia, May or Mai in Northern Europe, Flora in Rome, or Kore in Greece. The 
God is the grown Son, the Lover, the Green Man. This is the time the Maiden 
and Lover meet and perform the Great Rite (sacred sexual union) in harmony 
with the fertile energies of the season. This is the beginning of Summer, 
of the growing season. Thus what is done on the spiritual plane is echoed 
on the physical plane.


There are many ways to celebrate Beltane yourself, such as:

"Friend, hope for the truth while you are alive.  Jump into experience 
while you are alive!  What you call "salvation" belongs to the time before 
death.  If you don't break your ropes while you are alive, do you think 
ghosts will do it after?"
-Kabir

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the 
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become 
visible."
-Jacques Attali in his seminal text "Noise"
