Subject: Re: [sfraves] Sad Sad day for us all

Reguardless of how the majority of congress voted, still Bush, the president 
that most of us either voted for or agaist (mostly against i might add) chose 
to approve of this outrageous bill. I mean who actually takes the time to 
vote for senators and congressmen, yes ideally we should try to vote for as 
much as we can but the majority of people who come out to vote, do it durring 
presidential elections. And when the president lets us down in his desicions 
he's the one we point the finger at, it's part of the job. 
    Bush choose to aprove of a bill that is named after a little girl that 
got kidnaped... and somehow the bill irrelevantly adds a clause about jail 
sentances for clubs underground party drug situations. Now sure it sounds all 
fine & dandy about putting high pressure on kidnappers and pephiles, yes that 
part should be approved of, and yes that part is logical to name the "amber 
alert bill" ...but can somebody explain to me how this has anything fucking 
remotely related to drug use at clubs? anyone? and don't try to tell me that 
minors who use drugs at clubs are getting kidnaped, because i've never heard 
of that, it's very rare if that ever happens at all. I think the government 
is subtley trying to imply that minors who use drugs at clubs can end up like 
this Amber girl. And it's wrong of them to assume that. 
    That is by far the most rediculous stretch of the imagination for a law 
that i've ever heard of. It ranks right up there with the law about no events 
with "repetitive beats" that i heard about over in the U.K.   It just goes to 
show you how determined the government is to stop the rave scene's 
popularity, and it's raw spiritual influences such as the drugs that surround 
it. 
    And those of you who say things like "The raves scene just hasn't turned 
out to be the movement we would have liked it to be" and "The rave scene is 
somethign that has come and passed" are playing right into the hands of what 
the government wants you to think, and what the government has sucessfully 
achieved in it's draconian laws against us. 
    Now does that mean our government is some evil dictatorship that 
diabolically wants to ruin our lives? No, of course, not but I can tell you 
that our government is full of grown up "rich kids" who were pushed into 
politics and fancy colleges and were raised to be the people they are now by 
their parents (i.e. Bush senior). The government does not know anything about 
underground culture nor do they know anything about the spiritual practices 
of achient tribal cultures all around the world. They do not know about the 
deeper, more spiritual effects and the emotional side of the drug world. 
People in our government do not have friends who are "having a hard time" 
making it in life... because they have been shuting all those peopel out 
every day since high school, as to ensure them a more efficiant path to 
success and power. All the problems that we have as a country are all the 
problems that they have been avoiding all their life.  We are all just 
numbers to them and they have been taking lots of math and science and 
humanity classes to figure us out, but when we don't cooperate with their 
"programs" that are supposed to help us "it's our own fault" and to think 
other-wise is just "apathy" as i was once told by a conservative. the 
government will do anything to prove that it doesn't make mistakes. this is a 
desparate trait of a typical person who falls into the pretentious nature of 
the world of politics or any other profession these days. Those of us who are 
honest about our mistakes and change our mind often and retract comments etc. 
are considered "inferior" and are treated that way, while those of us who 
learn the path of "pretentiousness" and learn to pretend that we're always 
right and blame things on other people and things than ourselves will always 
suceed and will gain more respect from our superiors. 
    now that is what i believe is the "evil cycle", that people see in our 
ways as americans. all of these pretentious attitudes add up to a lot of 
beaurocratic non-sense that cannot be understood exactly and truely unless 
you are a top notch political student or researcher. therefor the rest of us 
(and the majority of us i might add) are not considered emotionally or 
spiritually when laws are passed. because those are the two words that the 
government dares not speak of (or learn of) so if the laws that are passed 
keep us safe, but ruin our lives emotionally and spiritually, than they will 
very likely be passed anyway, and no one will even notice or have the power 
to fight it.

When Cops Attack!
More police on the street -- more kids in jail

It's a morning like any other. The family is sitting round the breakfast 
table watching Good Morning America. Then the front door gets kicked in. 
Screaming at the tops of their lungs, a heavily armored SWAT team bursts in 
waving automatic weapons. Before you lift a finger, you're hog-tied on the 
kitchen floor at gunpoint. A nervous cop threatens to shoot your dog to stop 
it from barking. Someone waves a piece of paper in front of your face saying 
something about a search warrant, while the police spread out across the 
house, pulling open drawers, throwing the contents into Hefty bags. Welcome 
to your first starring role in America's Most Wanted.

But this isn't just another Fox special; it's a growing political reality. 
SWAT raids and confiscations are becoming an everyday tactic against even 
the smallest crime; and, as many activists have recently discovered, that 
includes the offense of mouthing off once too often against the powers that 
be. Fifteen-year-old Brenton Gicker and his family found out this unpleasant 
fact the hard way, and their story is a chilling tale of the extremes to 
which one police department will go to prove their point.

On October 17, 1998, Gicker, along with a ragtag collection of 50 adolescent 
punk rockers and other anarchists, staged a demonstration at the Eugene, 
Oregon Nike Factory Store, protesting working conditions at the company's 
overseas facilities. During the rally, about 10 individuals entered the 
store and trashed the place, smashing Halloween pumpkins, knocking over 
displays, and even breaking a window. The police were on hand, but no 
arrests were made at the time.

Two weeks later, on the morning of November 2, Brenton's parents Janet and 
Randall Gicker were preparing to leave the house to run errands, when 
Randall spotted several darkly-clad figures scurrying outside the window. As 
he went to investigate, a battering ram smashed in the door and 
approximately 13 police officers in paramilitary uniforms stormed into the 
house, guns drawn, and ordered the Gicker family to the floor.

The two-page search warrant listed Brenton Gicker as the prime target in 
connection with the October 17 Nike "riot." The evidence sheets list over 
360 separate items taken from the Gicker house. Brenton's room was cleared 
out as the cops took posters from his walls, his computer, assorted books, 
pamphlets, and a Ronald Reagan hockey mask. Janet, who runs an online 
business selling collectibles on eBay, lost her computer and her personal 
files, as well as the family's videotape of the Bruce Willis film Die Hard, 
into the police evidence bag.

Gicker was formally arrested at school on February 8 and charged with 
burglary, disorderly conduct, riot, and criminal mischief. After several 
months confined under house arrest, he faced a bench trial (meaning his fate 
was decided by a judge rather than a jury) in juvenile court on May 28. His 
lawyer, Don Diment, filed a discovery motion and found that the case against 
Gicker was pretty thin at best -- amounting to a smudged set of fingerprints 
found on a placard at the demonstration and a coerced "confession" from one 
Sean Downing. Downing, 22, was picked up in mid-January and charged with 
second-degree burglary in connection with the October 17 event. Under 
intense interrogation, Downing fingered Gicker as one of the culprits, even 
though the two had never met before.

The story doesn't end there. At the annual "Reclaim the Streets" 
demonstration on June 18, police spotted someone wearing a straw hat and a 
pair of overalls behaving badly. Naturally, they assumed it was Gicker. He 
was re-arrested by Eugene Police Officer Greg Kalef on July 5, charged with 
violating the terms of his release, and held in juvenile hall for four days. 
The charges were only dropped after documentary footage, aired on a local 
cable community service channel, showed Gicker at the demonstration in a 
completely different set of clothing and behaving in an orderly manner.

Unable to admit they made a mistake, the police pushed for a harsher 
probation for Gicker. "I just can't believe it," his mother complained, 
"they were proposing community service as punishment. Now it's this big 
probation thing where he is not allowed anywhere in town. The probation 
officer says he's not even allowed to go to the library and read about 
anarchy. He's 15 years old and he is being persecuted for his beliefs."

The trial lasted all of three hours. Downing recanted his testimony, yet 
Gicker was still found guilty of burglary and disorderly conduct. On July 
14, Gicker was sentenced to a year in a youth correctional facility. The 
court then suspended the correctional facility sentence, and placed him on 
an extremely restrictive year-long probation. He is not allowed to be 
anywhere near the downtown Eugene area without the company of his parents, 
and must adhere to a daily 10 p.m. curfew. Despite being found not guilty on 
the rioting charge, he was ordered to pay a $400 restitution fine and to 
perform an additional 40 hours of community service.

"The cops were just making me an example, which is funny," Gicker says 
philosophically. "There was a whole lot of people at the Nike protest, and 
who knows how many actually trashed the store. I'm guessing quite a few. 
Only one person gets screwed over, you know? So it's well worth it."

Despite motions filed on their behalf, the Gickers have yet to receive their 
confiscated property. In order to continue her online business, Janet had to 
shell out over $1,300 for additional computer equipment.

Not Enough Donuts to Go 'Round

While the Gicker case can be viewed as an extreme example of cop behavior, 
Christian Parenti, author of Lockdown America: Police and Prisons in the Age 
of Crisis, sees this as a disturbing trend. "Crime is down," Parenti says, 
"The police are not [dealing] with a lot of murders and revenge killings 
they have to solve. They are looking for action. There is no end in sight. 
Clinton's crime bills of '92 and '96 have put 100,000 new cops on the 
street. Some police forces have doubled in the last eight years."

The Gickers are not alone. Several incidents have occurred that bear 
striking similarity. In Tampa, Florida, a group known as the "Tampa Three" 
was subjected to FCC-sanctioned SWAT raids in an effort to shut down three 
pirate radio stations broadcasting in the area. Doug Brewer, operator of The 
Party Pirate, had $100,000 worth of electrical equipment seized on the 
morning of November 19, 1997. Kelly Benjamin of 87x was charged with 
possession when the cops found marijuana at his house, and Arthur Kobres was 
prosecuted for operating his Patriot-affiliated unlicensed station. All 
three have yet to have any of their equipment returned.

A more recent case is that of Kevin Keating. Keating was stopped by the San 
Francisco Police Department and arrested for carrying a backpack full of 
posters and pasting materials. The police were looking for "Nestor Mahkno," 
the sinister man behind a terrorist group calling itself "the Mission Yuppie 
Eradication Project." The MYEP's posters targeted new upscale bars and 
restaurants that have sprouted up like weeds in the working class 
neighborhood, vowing to reduce them to "picturesque ruins" during the "major 
urban riots" against "cigar bar clowns." In other words, the kind of 
telegraph-pole hyperbole you expect from art school refugees -- not from the 
Symbionese Liberation Army.

After being held incommunicado for over 15 hours, Keating was formally 
charged with a felony count of making terrorist threats and one misdemeanor 
count of malicious mischief. During those 15 hours, the SFPD executed a raid 
on his home and carted off boxes of his possessions. According to the 
35-page evidence sheet, this included over 70 books, his computer, 
diskettes, and correspondence; all the materials of a nearly complete 16 mm 
film project; and a picture of Malcolm X. Charges against Keating were 
dropped pending further investigation, though he can be re-indicted up to a 
year from now. In the meantime, his possessions will remain with the SFPD 
indefinitely.

The stories of Gicker, Keating, Brewer, Benjamin, and Kobres represent the 
unfortunate state of policing in America. Apparently, repeated viewing of 
those reality cop shows has had its desired effect, making SWAT raids and 
confiscations accepted, commonplace events of everyday policing. Parenti 
concludes that this is an example of the supposedly non-political police 
force acting out their true political purpose. "The function of the police 
is to suppress dissidents and manage surplus populations. They do that if 
these populations are white or black; if they are well behaved or ill 
behaved. In a class society, the police always have this social control."

Subject: [sfraves] NRR: SCARY ! improved trust or Big Brother ?

http://www.againsttcpa.com

how long till this happens? Soon I bet.

-------------------------

What are TCPA and Palladium?

TCPA stands for the Trusted Computing Platform Alliance, an initiative led
by Intel. Their stated goal is 'a new computing platform for the next
century that will provide for improved trust in the PC platform.' Palladium
is software that Microsoft says it plans to incorporate in future versions
of Windows; it will build on the TCPA hardware, and will add some extra
features.

What does TCPA / Palladium do, in ordinary English?

It provides a computing platform on which you can't tamper with the
applications, and where these applications can communicate securely with the
vendor. The obvious application is digital rights management (DRM): Disney
will be able to sell you DVDs that will decrypt and run on a Palladium
platform, but which you won't be able to copy. The music industry will be
able to sell you music downloads that you won't be able to swap. They will
be able to sell you CDs that you'll only be able to play three times, or
only on your birthday. All sorts of new marketing possibilities will open
up.

TCPA / Palladium will also make it much harder for you to run unlicensed
software. Pirate software can be detected and deleted remotely. It will also
make it easier for people to rent software rather than buying it; and if you
stop paying the rent, then not only does the software stop working but so
may the files it created. For years, Bill Gates has dreamed of finding a way
to make the Chinese pay for software: Palladium could be the answer to his
prayer.

don't get yer knickers in a twist laddie...he said
that the npo-status thing is part and parcel with the
overall trend towards forming organizations. party
crews form production companies, collectives form
NPOs. it expresses itself differently in different
contexts but it's the same dynamic at work.

but that's his point, man. it's grown up. it's
organized. it happened before, it'll happen again.
instead of an anarchic force with the power to change
things, it's a sustainable, wonderful thing, still
going strong. sounds like the lyrics to some Japanese
company's corporate song.

(hey, that rhymed! note to self: if ever do rap album,
remember above lyrics.)

I totally disagree. first, the guy didn't actually
single out CF at all. he mentioned them in passing.
second, CF lost its way hardcore.

the Cloud Factory is basically a communist
organization. nothing wrong with that in and of itself
-- communism is incredibly useful for developing
countries. it prevents stronger countries from taking
stuff away by force, because it pools resources along
traditional tribal lines.

however -- when you've got a group of middle-class
white people pooling their resources along traditional
tribal lines, how the fuck is that supposed to be
cool?

don't get me wrong, I've been to Cloud Factory events
which were absolutely wonderful. but the philosophy is
completely ass-backwards. that's why you have kickass
musicians and DJs at every Cloud Factory event -- yet
you can't guarantee you'll actually get to hear them,
because it all depends on whether or not their name
gets pulled out of the hat. CF makes it possible to go
on drug-infused picnics with the best DJs around and
not hear a single one of them spin. CF is completely
fucking insane.

sometimes CF events are wonderful and I take back
every bad thing I've said about them. words are
meaningless and forgettable. but the thing is --
actually, this is a total tangent, but blame mercury
retrograde, because here I go:

I'm getting a Transmat tattoo soon. Growing up in
Chicago, I heard "Strings of Life" on the radio when I
was a teenager. And the thing is, that wasn't the
result of a collective enterprise. Transmat Records is
and was a business.

the Grateful Dead created something which was
surprisingly cool and powerful. the vibe at Dead shows
was a textbook example of how musicians and fans can
create entire alternate worlds together simply thru
their love of the same sounds. selling out arenas is
not necessarily the same thing as simply selling out.
I've gone to Dead shows just to smoke pot in the
parking lot. (in fact I was doing just that at the
last show Jerry Garcia ever played before he died.)

and how many thousands of lives did Jerry Garcia
change? credit where credit is due. I think what the
Grateful Dead did was amazingly cool, even though I
don't even slightly understand the appeal of their
music. (I'll admit I've got a few Dead CDs, but then
again I have hundreds of CDs.)

Yeah -- but what about the people who make their money
and stay in the game? CF preserves the underground,
but the underground is a birthing point. Preserving
the underground sometimes seems to me like the
equivalent of prolonging your childhood. When Derrick
May was underground, he was the coolest thing in the
universe. Now that he makes a living off his music, he
stills seems pretty cool. In fact these days he
reminds me of a 21st-century Miles Davis.

Once upon a time Paul Oakenfold was underground too.
He made one of my favorite records of 1992 --
"Loaded," which was a Primal Scream remix. Oakenfold
is not that cool, he's more cheesey, but again --
credit where credit is due. These guys from London and
Detroit, and their fans, they created an entire
alternate world based on their love of the same
sounds. What they've done is incredible -- but if
they've moved on from the underground, what is it in
the underground that deserves preservation? What is CF
doing that is so worthwhile?

These aren't just rhetorical questions. I'm genuinely
curious. I mean it is possible that I'm missing
something.

But, I skipped the DEMF for a CF event once. I
remember scratching my head and wondering what the
fuck I was thinking. And now? Now I don't have the
money to go, and now this year's DEMF is gonna be
amazing. Derrick May won control back from the
corporate assholes who were running the show. He's
gonna do something absolutely incredible, and I want
to be there.

(wah wah wah. poor me...)

> I for one would love to see Skills, F8, FGE,
> Brainchild/Orgy or hell, even
> Burning Man seek out NPO status.

Burning Man could do it easily. In fact it's a really
good idea. A Burning Man arts-promotion NPO affiliate,
analogous to the CF organization, would have the
funding to make a difference, and would have access to
a vastly larger number of artists.

Someone in CFCA should talk about that to Sameer. (He
has the same lawyer as Burning Man.)


Giles


ps -- two more things.

1. things are going to change soon. it's inevitable,
because things are getting stagnant, and after things
getting stagnant, things change. so, if CF gets
dissed, don't be taking it personally.

2. the Grateful Dead are actually a really interesting
example because it may be that they form the model or
precursor for what eventually happens with the rave
scene. it's getting bigger and bigger, and in Europe
it's been huge for a decade. something's going to
happen. the only question is what.

I basically think there are two alternate futures for
the rave scene: the Moby future, and the DEMF future.

pray for the DEMF future.

Moby is sending a Terminator back in time to kill me.

sex in a private home. "If the Supreme Court says that you have the right=20
to consensual sex within your home," the Pennsylvania Senator reportedly=20
fumed, "then you have the right to bigamy, you have the right to polygamy,=
=20
you have the right to incest, you have the right to adultery. You have the=
=20
right to anything." Santorum went on to group gay marriage with bestiality=
=20
and pedophilia.

Well, bad news and bad politics travel fast, particularly in Washington,=20
and as soon as the story hit the wire, gay-rights advocates were calling=20
for Santorum's head, or at least his party leadership post, as were=20
Democrats and many in the press. But hey, what the hell, it's just the=20
commies, the queers and the damned liberal media, right? Well, yeah. Except=
=20
that it's not. 'Cause now Owen Allred is pissed at Santorum too.

Who's Owen Allred? Why he's the eighty-nine-year-old patriarch of Utah's=20
pro-polygamy sect United Apostolic Brethen, that's who, and he told the=20
Philadelphia Daily News last week that Santorum's comments =96 that is, his=
=20
brazen lumping of buggery with multiwifing =96 made him "so mad I want to=20
swear" (which is to say, pretty goddamned mad). Not that Allred necessarily=
=20
disagrees with Santorum; not in principle, anyway. As he'd explained the=20
day before to his hometown Salt Lake Tribune, "The people of the United=20
States are doing whatever they can to do away with the sacred rights of=20
marriage." (And marriage. And marriage. And marriage.) Nonetheless, Allred=
=20
said (in the Daily News) that the Catholic conservative "is an insult to=20
Christianity." Yikes. This from a man with eight wives.

Of course, the pile-on doesn't end there. Even Santorum's GOP colleagues=20
have gotten into the act. "Senator Santorum's views are not held by this=20
Republican and many others in our party," said Rhode Island Sen. Lincoln=20
Chafee, and Maine's Olympia Snowe added, "I believe Senator Santorum's=20
remarks undermine Republican principles of inclusion and opportunity." (As=
=20
damning as they were, neither statement held the entertainment value of=20
Nebraska Democrat Bob Kerrey's reported onetime crack: "Santorum? Is that=20
Latin for 'asshole'?")

Ah, but back to the matter at hand, the plight of poor, misunderstood Rick=
=20
Santorum. As David Smith, a senior strategist with the Human Rights=20
Campaign, put it, "He seemed to put gay people on the same moral and legal=
=20
plane as someone who would commit incest."

Santorum, of course, says he meant no such thing. "I have no problem with=20
homosexuality," he said in the same interview. "I have a problem with=20
homosexual acts" =96 all but begging for an update to the old drug joke:=20
Problem with gay sex? Move to the Castro, Rick. No more fucking problem.

The great irony here is that Santorum's right =96 examined more closely, his=
=20
comments on Lawrence v. Texas aren't actually homophobic after all. No, as=
=20
it turns out, Rick Santorum isn't anti-gay, he's just anti-sex.

Think that's silly? After all, Santorum has six kids. It's safe to assume=20
he's been engaging in something resembling sex with Mrs. Santorum. But read=
=20
the quote again. "If the Supreme Court says that you have the right to=20
consensual sex within your home, then you have the right to bigamy, you=20
have the right to . . . "

Catch that? Not consensual gay sex, but consensual sex. Period. It seems=20
Rick Santorum is making a pretty classic slippery slope argument, the twist=
=20
here being that the slope begins sloping not in the bedrooms of West=20
Hollywood and the West Village, but in your bedroom and mine as well. In=20
the Senator's eyes, the right to sexual privacy among consenting adults is=
=20
not a given: "It all comes from, I would argue, this right to privacy that=
=20
doesn't exist in my opinion in the United States Constitution, this right=20
that was created, it was created in Griswold [v. Connecticut]," Santorum=20
said, referring to the 1965 case that established the Constitutional right=
=20
of heterosexual couples to use contraception within the context of a=20
marriage. Yeah. So if Santorum can't get behind that, he's not going to get=
=20
behind any form sexual privacy, your own particular kinks =96 or lack=
 thereof=20
=96 notwithstanding.

All of which brings us to the heart of the matter. Santorum has been=20
vilified by the left and abandoned by some on the right for turning a legal=
=20
case into a platform for his bigoted views, and rightly so. But in reality,=
=20
Lawrence v. Texas isn't about gay sex at all. Well, okay, it is =96 the=20
sodomy practiced by the couple in question would have been legal if one of=
=20
them had been a woman (or a horse =96 gay sex may be illegal in Texas, but=
=20
bestiality isn't). But what Lawrence v. Texas is really about is privacy.=20
In Texas =96 and in more than a quarter of all states, it's worth noting =96=
 it=20
remains illegal for consenting adults to express their sexuality, even in=20
private, unless their sexuality meets standards laid out by the state=20
legislature.

If you're straight, do you perhaps think this doesn't concern you? Think=20
again. Because Santorum's right =96 it is a slippery slope. Seen as a=
 privacy=20
issue rather than a sex issue, the high court's decision in Texas impacts=20
your right to oral sex, it impacts your right to masturbation, it impacts=20
your right to contraception =96 hell, it impacts your right to everything=
 but=20
the missionary position, man on top, and it may just impact that too. In=20
short, it impacts your right to any kind of sexual autonomy, particularly=20
if you happen to be part of a "second-class" relationship.

That's not my term, by the way. William Donohue, president of the=20
conservative Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights, classifies=20
heterosexual marriage as "special" and all other relationships as=20
second-class =96 in other words, not just the cousin-fuckers and the=20
wife-collectors, but committed homosexual relationships and, yes,=20
unmarried, sexually active straight couples (uncomfortable yet?). And, as=20
Donohue puts it in throwing his organization's considerable support behind=
=20
Santorum, if the law allows those kinds of relationships, well then we may=
=20
as well "just let everybody fornicate and let kids be born into a society=20
of bastards."

Uh-huh. The way I see it, as long as Texas law =96 and the U.S. Constitution=
=20
=96 fails to protect our most private rights, well, a society of bastards is=
=20
exactly what we've got.

--=====================_18445584==_.ALT
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"; format=flowed

I think it's important to understand we in the EDM community are not going 
to surrender and accept this infringement of our rights.  Even now, efforts 
are underway to repeal those provisions of the Amber Alert Act that affect 
our communities nationwide.

I urge all of you concerned with the future of our dance floors to support 
those organizations who are organizing opposition to this legislation.  The 
Drug Policy Alliance is addressing the rave crackdown in a number of ways. 
It has established an organization call the Electronic Music Defense and 
Education Fund. In 2002 the Alliance, with the help of its supporters, led 
an aggressive campaign to stop the federal RAVE Act, which would have given 
federal prosecutors new powers to shut down raves or other musical events 
they didn't like and punish businessmen and women for hosting or promoting 
them. The Alliance also has assisted the ACLU in its successful challenge 
to federal government restrictions rave promoters and participants. In 
addition, the Alliance has sponsored a series of public forums on rave 
culture and is working with dancers, performers and youth advocates to 
draft model legislation regulating electronic music dance events in a 
manner that protects First Amendment freedoms and promotes the health and 
safety of all involved.

The Alliance is now working with the ACLU to repeal the RAVE act.  Though 
I'm as financially strapped as everyone these days, I've made a donation to 
the Alliance and the ACLU and I hope those of you who can afford it will do 
the same.  Info below.

Much love,

Apollo

Bush Signs RAVE Act, Drug Policy Alliance Seeks Repeal
Wed, April 30, 2003


Today President Bush signed the well-supported but highly controversial 
Amber Alert, a far-reaching child protection legislation carrying a number 
of contentious provisions.

"After months and months of trying, we've finally gotten a green light for 
a national AMBER Alert program," says Senator Patrick Leahy (D-VT). "The 
problem has never been winning enough support to pass it.  The problem has 
been that our bill has garnered such strong support that it has been abused 
as a sweetener for highly controversial add-ons."

One such abusive provision, the RAVE Act, was tacked on to the legislation 
at the final minute. Last year Drug Policy Alliance and its supporters 
managed to squash the bill that would make it easier to arrest event 
holders for the drug offenses of their patrons, however, the determined 
Senator Biden (D-DE) snuck the harmful legislation through Congress on the 
back of the otherwise unrelated Amber Alert.

The next year will be crucial for the fight against the RAVE Act. As the 
law comes into play, Drug Policy Alliance will continue to get the word out 
about the dangerous legislation, create guidelines for business owners to 
help them deal with the law's complications, and start the fight for 
repeal/reform.

Drug Policy Alliance is not alone in its misgivings. Some Democrats, who 
support a stand-alone version of the Amber Alert bill passed by the Senate, 
argued that provisions in the bill reducing federal judges' discretion in 
sentencing criminals should have been debated on the floor. The provisions 
limit judicial discretion in a broad range of federal cases and in protest, 
federal judges and legal scholars, including some Republicans, are calling 
it an assault on judicial independence. Some judges have even threatened to 
resign. They argue that the legislation further erodes the discretion and 
authority of trial judges and that such discretion is necessary in certain 
cases, such as those involving minor participants in the drug trade and 
girlfriends or spouses of drug sellers.

Parts of the loaded legislation also take the country in the opposite 
direction to recent reforms in some states where strict sentencing laws 
have been eased. Many states have eliminated harsh three-strikes laws and 
mandatory minimum sentences to reduce prison numbers as they struggle to 
balance their budgets.

Despite complaints about restrictions and supplementary provisions, House 
and Senate Democrats voted for the Amber Alert bill. The House passed the 
bill 400-25 and the Senate approved in on a 98-0 vote.

With your support, we will take on Attorney General John Ashcroft and the 
DEA every time they use the RAVE Act to try to shut down electronic dance 
events, raves, rock and hip hop concerts, hemp festivals, circuit parties, 
and other events.  We will organize thousands of people to oppose this new 
government intrusion. We will launch an aggressive and relentless lobbying 
campaign to repeal the RAVE Act.

To do it, we need your help.  This campaign costs real money. Contributions 
from people like you help us pay for lobbyists, grassroots organizing, and 
all the faxes we send to Congressional offices.   Please donate $10, $20, 
$50, $100, $500, $1,000 or whatever you can afford at:

"Loyalty is the realization that America was born of revolt, flourished in 
dissent, became great through experimentation. Our tradition is one of 
protest and revolt, and it is stultifying to celebrate the rebels of the 
past while we silence the rebels of the present."
-Henry Steele Commager

Really? Man, for all my life I thought it was:

I thought she was the "smooth criminal" he was eluding to?

Oh well ;-)


i wasn't sure if i'd been wrong about the words myself, so right before posting (gosh, sometimes, i am totally hyper-obsessive about not being wrong in front of people.:) :) :)....but anyways, i checked a site that posts lyrics, and while my lyrics are out of order, that site also put, "annie are you okay?" as the words. annie oakley would have made perfect sense, i think. perhaps he was alluding to her. interesting. it is a good song, but also, i guess, it gets on people's nerves or something. i don't know. i don't know why people make fun of michael jackson so much or why they accuse him of things that they don't know about or understand. i think that's beyond wierd. people say that gossip and mockery goes along with celebrity. i think that is just a lame way of excusing what is wrong. any culture that supports and reinforces mental illness needs a major makeover. people talk a lot about cher and her plastic surgery. cher says that if she wants to put her breasts on her back she will, because it is her body. i love that.  :)

so transmat is 'cool' because its a business (that associates itself 
and/or its members with events thrown by massive corporations), but cf 
is 'uncool' because its a group, in your words, of middle-class white 
people pooling their resources along traditional tribal lines. that's 
the message?

how does: "you have kickass musicians and DJs at every Cloud Factory event"
corellate with: "not hear a single one of them spin"

i'm curious, what is your definition of selling out? you could draw a 
distinction between burning man and a dead show - they are both massive 
in terms of the numbers of participants and take big dollars to pull off 
- but one occurs (occurred)  in a venue inherently fused with brand 
exposure and strategic partnerships of the biggest corporations in the 
world ...

preserving the underground seems to me like the equivalent of creating a 
place for things more intimate and driven by the love of an art, as 
opposed to (on the extreme end) being a statistic in a demographic 
study, tagged as a viable consumer for target-marketed products. maybe 
its just me. i find it more desirable to participate in something where 
i have a sense of being relevant as a person and possibly an artist, 
with something to offer to the collective experience other than being an 
attendant with money in hand and a pair of eyeballs to soak up brand 
impressions.

they are having a many-to-many dialogue with people. they draw a 
distinction between attendants and participants. they promote and live a 
genuine sense of family and relationship. they are doing something out 
of love and passion. they are bringing together many different kinds of 
artists and exploring a broader creative territory. i personally find 
these traits worthy of my admiration.

interesting. i find CF to be one of the agents of said change, a group 
actually doing something about said stagnance.

if the scene has one core trait attached to its genesis, its "do it

--part1_f6.2ba8199c.2be34093_boundary
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="US-ASCII"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

  As most of you know, the anti-rave legislation (S. 226, the Illicit Drug 
Proliferation Act) was signed into law, snuck in the Amber alert bill. And 
like the signing of over 200 death warrants while Governor of Texas, "pro 
life" Prez Bush signed our death warrant to fun in America, that country that 
wants to infect "freedom" to the rest of the world; freedom defined as the 
freedom of "free trade", meaning radical capitalism where 10 year olds to 
work in Disney & Walmart sweetshops for 10c an hour, and having governments 
that will  expose their ass holes (at the point of a cruse missile if 
necessary) to the plan of the "New American Century doctrine, the modern, 
international version of the Manifest Destiny doctrine.
  So, what does this all mean now? Technically, it is illegal, not only to 
rave, but any event, rock concerts, hiphop, punk shows, back yard BB-Q's, 
house parties, wedding functions, any place where people congregate and drugs 
can be found, the promoter of the event as well as the property owner can now 
be subject to the crack house laws, which means they can have their property 
and assets confiscated, be fined $500,000 and face a 20 year prison sentence. 
Everyone in the music/entertainment business is having a cold chill go down 
their spines with this, and not only will venue owners think twice about 
renting a space for a rave, but any event, especially associated with music 
and entertainment of any genre. Sure, raves and music concerts could 
theatrically go on, but in order to assure that all events will be 100% drug 
free, which is the only option promoters and venue owners have been cornered 
into now to CTA's, patrons would have to be subject to literal strip and 
cavity searches, dog sniffs and be 1984'd all through the event. And I don't 
think not that many people will find an event worth going to be put through 
all that crap, even by those who don't do drugs. 
  So, the side walk of night life and partying of any kind could very well 
roll up in America and helping, amongst other things going on, to fast track 
the US to become the (Fundamentalist) Christian version of Ayatollah 
Khomeini's Iran or the Tallaban's Afghanistan of the Western world! I don't 
think we have yet digested what has been done. 
  One fallout of this bill that can happen, and it's going to happen a lot, 
is landlords being snoopy with their renters, looking for bongs and drug 
paraphernalia and would (to CTA's too) evict anyone accused of drug use or 
not rent to anyone who may (profiling) look like a drug user. All landlords 
are now subject to this fucked up law too and can face the consequences if 
the police show up at a house or apartment they rent and find drugs. 
Defiantly another fallout, mentioning going to raves or wearing candy jewelry 
at work or school could force people to mandatory drug testing. You can say 
all this is unconstitutional, but say that to Japanese Americans hauled off 
to concentration camps in WW II and Muslims sitting in detention centers 
today with no right to legal representation. More fascism is to come. You 
cannot pass this off as some conspiracy theory or an over abundance of 
paranoia anymore. This is serious! Hey, what about having something called 
"Operation American Freedom" here at home?
  But then, we did ask for much this, karma redux, But despite these fast 
becoming dark days, there is a bright side. I will go into our karma redux 
and the bright side in another post.
  Pacifica's Democracy Now program did a good expose on the anti-rave bill 
and Free Speech Radio News mentioned it in some detail as well. You can 
listen to these programs at: democracynow.org and fsrn.org and click on live 
audio program for 5/1/03.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] IT'S OFFICIAL: RAVING IS ILLEGIAL, a rebirth

Although the Anti-rave legislation sucks a fat nut, and I do not support it, 
I am kind of excited to see a rebirth of underground culture.  I think that 
the legislation will have the largest effect on mainstream parties and clubs 
(which sucks), but I don't see it eliminating undergrounds.  The detrimental 
effect it will have on undergrounds is that it will in essence push them 
further underground.  Making everything a little bit more shady and a little 
bit less safe (like no DanceSafe etc).  This may put a lot of sleazy (and 
not so sleazy) promoters out of a job and that sucks too.  I suppose this 
type of pressure has never been applied to such a wide array of party 
people.  Proactive voting, political pressure (applied when available), a 
motivated spirit, and some comfy dancing shoes are the weapons that we are 
still armed with.  I hope that we can all use these tools to reform this 
oppression.  It's gonna be a long march to victory, but I can assure you 
that I'll be dancing all the way.

Subject: [sfraves] NRR: our government is full of sissy squares... 

I suspect that the government's resentment for drugs is somewhat similar to 
the Amish people's resentment for technology... 

You know I think someone like John Ashcroft fears taking drugs like an Amish 
person would fear riding a roller coaster... Sure everyone who's been on one 
knows it's safe (with the proper safty straps and harnesses) but just by 
watching what a roller coaster does and how the people act when they are 
riding one... i think is enough to make any Amish person go running home to 
their farmland.  

And have you ever noticed how people always say "they don't like roller 
coasters..." instead of "they are scared to ride a roller coaster..." 

things that make you go hmm...

Now this is not to say that people who don't take drugs should be pressured 
into doing so by calling them "sissys" but i think we should just get it out 
in the open that when it comes down to it, the truth is, people actually FEAR 
drugs, mostly for either superstitious or religious reasons. Also the fear 
comes from exaggerated propaganda created by people who have never touched 
drugs. I think a lot of people who have never done drugs are afraid that they 
will "freak out" if they do them, or that some wierd aspect about their 
personality will come out in the open, and they don't want people to see them 
like that. This is especially true for members of our government....

no.

Transmat is unequivocally cool, and it is a business.
CF I have profound ambivalence about, and it is not a
business.

the becauses came from you.

go to a CF event. you could hear kickass musicians and
DJs spin. you could equally well hear non-kickass
musicians and DJs, while the aforementioned kickass
musicians and DJs were standing next to you listening
to said non-kickass folks.

nothing against those who don't kick ass, but not
everybody who spins is a DJ. I've been spinning for
five years and I only just recently got to the point
where I feel comfortable calling myself a DJ.

I'm assuming you mean the Dead shows were a corporate
environment? I gotta wonder if you've been to any. I
mean it's true that you could buy Pepsi there but
other than that I'm not really sure where you're
coming from.

OK well I don't know what to say to that. but keep in
mind, Transmat (the big bad business) wrestled control
of the DEMF from corporate forces pretty similar to
the ones you're describing here. and the Cloud Factory
did not. escaping corporate control is not the same
thing as standing up to it and kicking its ass. you
can run away from bullies if you want to, but I like
the folks who beat the bullies up and finally teach
them to stop taking other people's lunch money.

besides, what you're talking about sounds more like
some kind of art therapy support group. real artists
don't need supportive environments. Detroit and
Chicago, respective birthplaces of techno and house --
you think those are supportive environments? ever seen
"Kentucky Fried Movie"?

Tyrant: Take him to be tortured!
Spy: You can't scare me!
Tyrant: Take him to Detroit!
Spy: Nooooooooo!
(spy is dragged away screaming)

that's a great movie btw. go rent it, it's awesome.

also, here's some inexplicable randomness:
     "are you with the dj?"
     defiance is good for you.
     words are trivial.

I dunno, those are good things, but taken too far you
just end up with a community art fair.

I admire CF somewhat, but only somewhat. I can't deal
with this like life-or-death loyalty thing. sorry, but
I don't love CF **or** hate CF. I'm not for you or
against you. if anything, I think you need to calm
down.

personally I feel CF is this kinda cool thing which is
a little bit over-rated. I mean, cooler than Skills?
okay fine. but cooler than Transmat? cooler than the
people who invented techno?

okay, look, that's fine too. why not? CF can be cooler
than the guys who invented techno -- so long as we
agree that Moby is sending a Terminator backwards in
time to get me. I'll entertain your delusions of
grandeur if you'll entertain mine.

I'll be back.

well, obviously if you've got two people saying
there's only one question, and they're both saying a
different question is the only question, then
obviously we're both wrong, because our failure to
even agree on what the question is obviously prompts
the question, what is the question?

but I see where you're coming from, and I think you
need to chill out and go watch cartoons. :-p


Giles


ps - this is my last post ever on this subject. I have
nothing more to say about this. and if you read all
this and head out the door to a cf event, cool. have
fun! they're often good. some of the best moments of
my life occurred at cf events. but some of the best
moments of my life happened at Medusa's in 1990
dancing to Mark Farina. cf is awesome, you just gotta
realize the world is full of awesome things.

pps - my current favorite cartoon is "the fairly
oddparents." go watch it!

I've had this same conversation about the bloody Cloud

Shaolin Presents.Our BIGGEST party ever!

June 13, 2003

HIGH OCTANE <~~mini-MASSIVE

============================

 

LOCK N LOAD

The Lock N' Load project consists of two Dutch producers / DJs: Frank van Rooijen and Niels Pijpers. One fine day the Club Caviar boys came to visit the Lock N' Load studio, heard the old version of a song and offered to do a remix of it. In collaboration with Lock N' Load they delivered this stunning result and Niels decided to release "Blow Ya Mind". After all on Blue White Records, within a period of three weeks, it became the No. 1 club record in the Netherlands, and Europe followed soon after that, the United Kingdom was ready to be conquered. Through no. 1 positions in both the UK Club and UK Dance chart it had an amazing entry at 6. Help us welcome Lock N' Load to Sacramento.

Chris C.

Now firmly established as one of the Biggest and most popular DJ / Producers on the UK Hard House/NRG scene, Chris has masterminded the emergence and rapid success of his 3 Labels, Mohawk, Aztec and Nile. Positioning the former today as one of the genres top 5 marques. With over 30 single releases and 2 Albums to his name on various labels including Tidy Trax, Tinrib, Eve, Honeypot, Phoenix Rising, GBT, Bulletproof, etc...Chris' reputation as one of Britain's finest exponent of Hard House, both behind the decks and in the studio, continues to grow.

Whistler

Victor Cape a.k.a. Whistler shines as a highly respected DJ on the Pacific Northwest dance scene. Known for his tight mixing skills and uplifting personality behind the decks, Whistler blends energy and emotion from Hard Melodic Trance, Epic Anthems and Hard House to take his listeners on a dance floor rollercoaster ride. If being a DJ wasn't enough, he also manages Lovetribe which has quickly become one of the most well respected event productions in Seattle. It's been over a year and a half since Whistler's last performance in Northern California. So we're excited to bring him out for his first Sacramento performance!

GOOD MORNING FROM PORTLAND, OR      

 

 

 

What a day for house music. What a day for deciding to book a deep house
dj who can and will work your crowd. Why you ask should I book this
person there is plenty of good talent around. This is why, because I am
a kind hearted soul who enjoys walks on the beach and throbbing sound
systems. I do not have a self inflating ego I prefer to just enjoy the
beats and dance my poor white man dance. Another good reason is this no
travel costs. I am going to be in your area in about 2 months and just
need bookings with a small fee to go get my fix of vinyl from your local
shops. If you need to hear the beats here they are please do take the
time to listen as I have taken the time wait patiently while the mix
uploaded. To listen click the following link or paste it into your
browser. Http://www..flavoredclubbing.com/strawberry/ohmix2.ram
<http://www.flavoredclubbing.com/strawberry/ohmix2.ram>  

 

 

If after all this you are reading and smiling but you are not a promoter
please take the time to pass on my mix or name to your favorite
promoter. 

 

Now for a little about me. I am originally from Tucson AZ where I was
initiated into the rave scene in 1992 and then continued to party and be
stupid until 1995 when I got my first turntables. Living in the middle
of nowhere forced me to teach myself all that I know. In 1997 I moved to
the Bay Area and from there continued to the great NW. I now call
Portland my home and will continue to do so until I am lured to another
city with a promise of a better life for me. So please take the time to
think would you like a dj from Portland on your flyer? Would you like a
dj who can work a crowd? Would you like this dj for only small fees and
no travel costs? Well would you? Now quick hit the reply button and let
me know your dates and I will send you a contract and then when I get
the notarized contract back I will mark my calendar and see you on that
date. Pretty simple so what's stopping you? Oh yeah it is me stopping
you because I am still typing.....

Subject: Re: [sfraves]LONG LIVE SEGREGATIONnrr

"..I think a lot of seniors were disappointed,.. she said. ..Now we have to
choose between two groups of friends..."

huh? what? maybe i'm just a prude, but that would make a very easy decision
for me. MY FRIENDS wouldn't segregate themselves, plain and simple.

i was born, grew up, raised and went to my first year of highschool in rural
georga. i can't recall at any time any sort of tension between anyone of
color, or any other visible differences. i was friends with people who were
ugly in so many ways more and less than me, and i don't recall ever hearing
anyone us derogatory terms for people of different ethnic and racial groups.

i can't say the same for other parts of georga, maybe it was just where i
was living, but this saddems me that there's still people this stupid.
clearly the education system in that part of town isn't working, because it
has failed to teach them anything about the human spirit.

Damn Giles, you killed my buzz hardcore =P

If Cloudfactory is akin to a communist organization, then I'm sleeping
with Stalin, and I've felt up Castro.

That sucks.

Some of the best times of my life have been with CF, they've always been a
very generous, open-minded, socially-conscious, and balls-to-the-wall
party-throwing group of folks. I'm not discounting anyone's personal
feelings of lost direction, but to fault the group like that, and here,
is just awful.

Subject: [sfraves] nrr/bsp - berkeley housing: large room & private bath/entrance in 2-br apt

hey, my roommate is graduating and moving out at the end of the month so his 
room will be available starting june 1st. rent is $750 each, it's a 2 bedroom 
apartment on the southside of campus (ellsworth/blake), a quick 5 min walk to 
the south gate. there's no living room or common area other than the kitchen 
(which is big btw), but the available room is pretty large (about 12 by 17 
feet), you can fit a queensize bed, desk, dresser, coffee table and a futon or 
couch. you get your own separate entrance, the room's got a private bathroom 
and a walk-in closet. an overall studio-like feel to the place. the people in 
the building are very cool too (mostly students) and the neighborhood has a 
nice atmosphere. utils are shared, there are coin washer/dryer in the 
basement, rent includes parking space in the garage, you can go on 
month-to-month or year lease, and we also get cable modem/tv.
so about me: i'm alex, male, 23, first-year grad student at cal, born and 
raised in nyc and just moved to berkeley last august. i love techno (hard 
trance, goa, nrg), i'm a bedroom/up and coming dj (about 3 yrs), go clubbing, 
out to raves and hit up the bars occasionally. ya, i like to party but i also 
keep my act together cause i gotta get through eng. grad school. otherwise i 
like modern art, traveling, meeting people and just hanging out. i'm pretty 
laidback, easygoing but also responsible and respectful of personal space. i 
smoke cigarettes but only in my room and vent so the smell doesn't get into 
the kicthen or the other room.
i'm looking for a chill roommate that's fun to hang out with but also has a 
rather independent lifestyle. i'd like somebody responsible and trustworthy 
who can pay the bills on time. it would be cool if he/she (no preference on 
gender) had similar interests (especially the music, lol, we could hit up 
parties), but i'm open to anybody that's fun, friendly and open-minded.
if you think we might have a good match, send me a reply telling me a bit 
about yourself. leave me a number or reply-to so we can arrange a time for you

well, isn't he actually sort of right about that though?  maybe non-profit
ideals are a few steps toward communism ... what i find kind of funny is
that giles seems to see something wrong with that model.  i mean who cares,
it's their money and time, isn't it?  free country, i thought.

not that they were a corporate environment - they were _in_ a corporate 
environment.
the point i was making was about intent and a creating space... that was 
the burning man contrast.
relating to underground or not...

i never said there was anything wrong with transmat.
as you put forth derrick as a true underground soldier,
i was merely pointing out mr. may's involvement in, for example, events 
put on by cigarette companies.

the move events were good examples of a US event being centrally focused 
around a corporate brand.
when we're talking about what's on the other side of underground, that's 
something on the other side.

don't get me wrong either.
i missed hearing richie and derrick at the desert move,
and i certainly would have liked to have seen the majestic stacks of 
cabinets in the air...

but, as you describe things getting bigger and bigger - i bring that up 
as a contrast to why the underground might yet have merit.
where's the diy heart and soul in it, if all you have to go to, to hear 
the music that you love, is corporate sponsored parties?

yes that's hypothetical.

on the other side of underground, there are specialized rave/club 
marketing firms,
looking at us to see if we have the numbers they need to move more 
consumer products.
i'm not describing that as 'evil' - simply that is what i see on the 
other side of underground.
i'm not making judgements. i'm interested in contrast. these are just 
observations man.




>besides, what you're talking about sounds more like
>some kind of art therapy support group. real artists
>don't need supportive environments. 
>
c'mon. why did they form a label then? why did they team up with each other?
so they wouldn't be lone superheroes.
they created their own supportive environment.

it could be said that creating transmat or generator or <insert crew or 
label> _was_ an art therapy support group.
artists reaching out to each other to find other like minds.

"from our minds to yours"




>Detroit and
>Chicago, respective birthplaces of techno and house --

i'm from chicago also. no, chicago in and of itself is not a supporting 
environment.
people invariably create supporting environments within their cities, 
however cold and hard those cities may be.

see, to me an electronic-infused community art fair with awesome music 
sounds like fun.
after 12 years of going to events that have the same basic form and 
structure,
a little variation and mixing it up a bit is a good thing.

Hard to disagree with that.

Not only that, but then we also seem to have a large group of people 
who DO use drugs, even just recreationally and in moderation, that 
feel guilty or bad about it which only makes it worse. Drugs aren't 
bad, though they are illegal. "Illegal" does not automatically equal 
"bad". If you think it does then you probably should really enjoy 
living in the kind of theocracy that America lately seems to be 
slowly becoming.

Vive le sur-terrain!  (et pardon mon French mal.)

Has the prophecy of AndyW come true?  A return to the
underground?  Anyone still have some bolt-cutters? 

Let's throw a party in celebration, we'll be as
defiant as devilish dictators.  I'll play the

 Check ebay. That's the best place to find them used.
You can get a Pioneer cdj 100s for about $150. The
pitch control on that model sucks though to be honest.
It moves in incriments of .5% as compared to the cdj
800 or 1000 that move in incriments of .05% . What
this means is basically you have to babysit them. 

  You can probably find a Cdj 800 for about $500.
Thats what I recomend (and what I have). They are
basically a very stripped down 1000. They are 
expensive , but you will be much better off in the
long run. They are a dream to mix on, I actually would
prefer to play on 2 of them than 1200's.......and I
know plenty of other people who feel the same way.

well we talked it out.... But yeah... it was kinda trippy how that happened, 
but that goes w/ my thing I told y'all B4 about how things happen w/ me 
Psychicly & people I'm close w/...

But what's weird is that while this was happening... I tuned in2 CNN & they 
had this like story about monkey's & this total live feed thingie @ the 
location they were doing the story on!!  I dunno how many of U I told my 
dram I had about when I owned a pet monkey, but this was way 2 weird!  OK...

In my opinion..I think we all need to take a look at why we are involved in
the scene, and make sure we are doing this for the right reasons. I also
feel that us promoters have an obligation to keep this thing going and we
need to fight the powers at all levels. Part of fighting this will be living
with the law and making sure we don't get put in jail for it. I personally
feel that our crew should take a much larger stance against drug use at out
events. I know everyone wont be happy with that but my concern is keeping
the parties going so we can go out and hear good music every weekend.

ELECTRONICA OPTICA :: VJ & VISUAL ARTIST CONFERENCE
SATURDAY MAY 17, 2003 =80 150 Folsom, San Francisco, CA
2 Year Anniversary Celebration

http://www.electronica-optica.com/events/


o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o

/\ Intro

Electronica-Optica is celebrating their 2nd anniversary by presenting their
first annual VJ & Visual Artist Conference in San Francisco on May 17th,
2003 from 2pm - 4am. This conference will be one of the first in the US to
highlight and showcase this growing visual culture.

VJs are similar to modern DJs in that they play out at concerts, nightclubs=
,
and festival, except VJs play video content using traditional equipment suc=
h
as VCRs, DVD players, laptops, and video mixers. Some may even mix digital
video clips using VJ software such as Arkaos, MotionDive, and/or MaxMSP.
(Over 2 dozen VJ software packages exist for PC and Macintosh computers.)

Visual Artists are creative individuals and studios that produce stunning
imagery and visuals using a variety of media including shot video, film, CG
animation, motion graphics, pattern generators, or any combination thereof.
Content varies in length and may be non-linear, narrative, semi-narrative,
abstract, or simply the equivalent of a painting in motion.

Visuals are different than music video in the sense that they aren=B9t
commissioned works to promote a particular music artist. Visuals are create=
d
to stand for themselves, work with a variety of musical formats, and even b=
e
mixed by VJs with other visual content to create an entirely new impression
for the audience.



\/ Workshops

The daytime conference will begin with a discussion panel featuring Radley
Marx (Electronica-Optica), Jon Schwark (LightRhythm), and Grant Davis &
Michael O'Rourke (Dimension 7). Each will be addressing different areas of
this emerging culture and sharing experiences and expectations for the
coming year. Topics will range from aesthetic and cultural expression to
practical market projects and strategies.

The afternoon workshops will be filled with a fun assortment of software an=
d
hardware demonstrations for VJs, DJs, visual artists, and newcomers to this
growing culture.

For DJs and new music producers, there will be a essential workshop for
sequencing video clips along with your music, using Arkaos VJ together with
Reason (the easy-to-use music production software that is quickly becoming
more popular than DJs). Equipment demos include VJ turntable-tools for
mixing and scratching video just like records.

For veterans, the Cycling =8C74 workshop will demonstrate the extreme high-en=
d
of what can be created and manipulated by digital video artists. Dimension =
7
will also be showing showing a variety of highly-developed equipment by
Edirol and M-Audio used in professional-level production.

Anyone is free to attend and take part.  This will be an excellent
opportunity for hands-on exploration and discovery.


/\ Screenings

Running concurrent with the workshops will be a series of visual screenings=
.
Just like a film festival, the screenings offer exclusive presentations of
short works and full-length visual projects from the visuals community.

The day will kick off with episodes of Electronica-Optica=B9s public access
series: VJTV. The full-length features include Yeast Films=B9 cultural music
sequence =B3Prophesy=B2 and a sneak-peak at the locally produced CG project, =B3I
Am=B2 by Dimension 7. The high point of the afternoon will be Bitz & Bytz, an
amazing assortment of 5-10 minute submissions by visual artists from around
the world including Addictive TV, D-Fuse, eMovie Collective, SquareSquare
and many more.




\/ Audiovisual Performances

The night celebration will feature performances by several outstanding
artists from the Bay Area and the mid-west. Headlining the night will be
VisualAudio, VJ Oz, and ESP - audiovisual performing artists that base thei=
r
show on the video as much as the music (or more). Other performances will
feature VJs and DJs playing together for exciting in-the-moment mixes that
spawn a powerful experience for the eyes and ears.




/\ Admission & Location Information

This conference is hosted at the Dimension 7 Studio, located at 150 Folsom
Street, in downtown San Francisco.

The workshops and screenings are FREE and run from 2pm to 8pm.

The night celebration goes from 8pm to 4am in the same space.
A small donation is requested for attending the night performances.

/\ About

Dimension 7 (D7) was formed in 1993 as one of the original visual artist
collectives and grew to become a full service production company. D7's live
production team combines multiple video projections, special effects, live
camera feeds, and laser animation to create what D7 calls "Immersive
Environments."

Electronica-Optica was formed by Radley Marx and Emmett Feldman as a means
to be creative visual artists and to help build a strong market
infrastructure for the emerging VJ industry.

Electronica-Optica is partnered with Media Box to produce VJTV, a monthly
one-hour television series that plays across North America and features
guest artists and visual content.

Radley Marx has worked in the west coast rave scene as a DJ and designer
under the alias Elemental and currently heads Electronica-Optica,
co-produces VJTV, and is developing his own live show as VJ Oz.

Emmett Feldman is currently working on original audio and visual material a=
s
Suryummy, as well as working with a variety of audiovisual groups including
ESP and LightRhythms.

Hi,   Let me introduce myself. My name is john and i am a producer/horrible dj(much better producer). I belong to a group known as Roar! and we are actively trying to get the rave act repealed.

Subject: [sfraves] Karma Redux: We brought this on ourselves, but...

--part1_129.2919be4a.2be461d5_boundary
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="US-ASCII"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

  There is a bright side to all of this. I know I will be misunderstood for 
this statement, and I will be hitting a wasp nest with my thoughts, but as I 
have learned, and still learning from my mistakes and misdeeds that to 
misplace the blame on others and to play the martyr or victim is easy and a 
natural response for most of us, but it only drags us down further in the 
black hole of energy draining energies of fear and reactionary living, and it 
only makes our situation or our karma worse. The hard part is to own up to 
our karma: "it's my karma, I own it" and to stop focusing on others and trust 
that the wisdom of the universe will honor our honesty and make us wise and 
more mature in the end, not to mention better karma situations.
  Here's what's up. The rave scene has become so corrupted and so way off 
base that because we as ravers were unwilling to take charge of our scene and 
clean it up, the government had to step in and do our job for us, like you 
drive DUI, you loose your license, not because the CHP hate drivers, but 
because of your actions you are a threat to the safety of other drivers. I 
don't think the intent of all responsible for this bill was entirely 
motivated on a hatred of raving per-se, but drugs were getting out of hand. 
Those exposes of us on TV news zines were somewhat exaggerated, but true 
enough to scare the hell out of moms and dads of America; we, too busy acting 
as victims and martyrs to see and listen to our karma warning us of the day 
of reckoning coming if we didn't change our ways.
  Raving is no longer an urban underground phenomenon made up of a few urban 
perverts, techno hippies and anti-pop culturists that most didn't find 
attractive and thus didn't give a fuck about us. But thanks to greed and our 
"enlightenment" to capitalism, too many kids, many of them hella young kids, 
kids from conservative homes, white suburban kids and the poster minority 
group, Asian kids, were now getting fucked up on drugs and laying on the 
floor and engaging in acts disturbing to Mid-America. Raving was getting too 
close to places like Iowa, Tennessee, Danville and Stanford, so something had 
to be done to stop it. 
  We all know what was going down with our scene. I remember back in the 
early 90's seeing newbies coming to raves and within a month throwing 
parties. Most of these people didn't have alturistic intentions, but were 
drug dealers and capital venturists finding a market to sell drugs and to 
make a profit. Even though the rave scene back in the day had a good share of 
open minded, adventurous, friendly, drug responsible people who cared about 
others and the old skool parties were rich with spiritual themes and the vibe 
was generally PLURy, I, and many others knew back then this wasn't going to 
bring a positive outcome for the scene. If we knew back then what the scene 
would be like today, we would have been so overwhelmed with discouragement.
  What we have today is a scene that has been advertised and flyred to 
virtually every mall and high/middle school in America and PLUR has been 
replaced with narcissism and nihilism. Here's hitting the wasp nest really 
hard, but we all know it's all true, sort of a public taboo subject, many 
promoters, DJ'ds and other "VIP"s in the scene are into drug dealing and many 
parties have acted as fronts for drug dealing. The DEA has known that for 
years, and now is on it because, like I said mid-America is getting sucked in 
the drama. Many others are into the scene for ego stoking, rock stardom and a 
nice, player life style. It seems those who are in it for the love of the 
scene and the music, altruistic intentions you might say, have become fewer 
and fewer. Corruption rots everything it touches, and eventually the rot 
turns on those who corrupt; aka. 
  So you wonder back a few years ago when the alarm bells were sounding and 
not many people seemed to care, why many promoters and DJ's didn't step up to 
the plate to come together as one force and organize protest parties and 
benefits to help fund some lobbying effort to our elected officials or to 
help pay for the legal defense of raving, you know why.
  But, like I said there is a bright side. Most of these people, including 
the people they attracted to raving, once raving no longer becomes profitable 
or too dangerous to be involved with will bail on us. Watch a lot of well 
known people bounce out of here. I say, let them go! What a wonderful time to 
take advantage of this cleansing to go back, not to the old skool, but to 
those things that made old skool raving so special. Old skool is dead, but 
those values that made raving a magical, life changing experience is 
timeless. It may be illegal to rave, but it's not illegal for those of us who 
really love techno to come together, learn form our mistakes, start over 
again from scratch and rediscover PLUR, spirituality, adventure and self 
creativity, all those things that were lost in mainstream/narissistic raves, 
and see what the energy from our unity will manifest. That is what I'm 
excited about!
  Peace to all, Bodhi ^ _ ^

Subject: [sfraves] Act consciously, do not be unconscious

In Regards to the Amber Deal....

With this all, I think the question is...what is the reason this is being
protested.

Is it for the right to have drugs in a public venue? Or, is the right to
gather and dance?

If it is the right to dance and gather well than that opportunity is still
there if the drugs are left behind. If that is the choice than this law will
not affect those organization publicly promoting drug awareness in their
venues and coordinating with the government to even help spread information
on missing people through our vast network of patrons across the country.

One can't really argue that it is bad to want to find missing children but
of course having missing children tied directly into the "rave" scene is
certainly not a proven fact but a generalization and a little shady for the
Govt just to throw it in.  I can personally say through my experience years
ago, back in the underground after hour's scene back in LA, I knew several
people who just never went home.  Or the kids that would just not go home or
to school for weeks at a time going to the thrift store in the day to get
some clothes for the next night out.  Some of the people did literally
disappear after a while ...

I am certainly not preaching anti- drugs to those who chose.  But I do think
one should protect the rights of everyone by not bringing a substance in
that due to the current laws would "spoil it for everyone".. One thing I can
say personally is that I would not mind being able to walk through the dance
floor without having to step over the E-puddles. Once again, not against the
E but support the practice of moderation.

Act consciously, do not be unconscious

TNG

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Act consciously, do not be unconscious

I think the big question here is how many people do we all know who will 
continue to support a drugless rave scene? how many people will stay all 
night sober? how many peopel will dance their ass off sober? will sentimental 
trance songs still make us shed a tear? is it still acceptable to talk and be 
friendly to strangers? can we still tolerate mars & mystre & skills style 
music, sober all night? how about happy hardcore, energy, gapper etc.
    I myself think positive and i believe i would still attend raves if every 
single person was sober all night long, and i'd still dance my ass off. but i 
know for a fact we'd lose a lot of less courageous souls in the process. it 
would be really strenuous if you think about it, to try and bring back that 
"vibe" without even the pressense of drugs at all. it's somewhere close to 
impossible, but if tht's what it's gonna take then i'd say i'll give it my 
best shot. i'll represent, i'm sure others will too. 
    but just the fact that we can possibly continue raving without drugs 
doesn't make it ok that they put two irrelevant bills together and voted on 
them like they were one bill. knowing that the other bill would not pass by 
itself. (fucking basdards!) to just "look at the brite side" and just have 
raves without drugs from now on is just going to encourage them to keep 
pushing us around and treating us unfairly. i don't think the rave scene is 
supposed to be so "co-operative" with oppresion, i don't think that's being 
true to our spirit. 

    In fact, i think the goddess... is getting royally pissed off.... (don't 
ask me what that means)

available for use, with or without compensation, the
place for the purpose of unlawfully manufacturing,
storing, distributing, or using a controlled
substance.'

it's not "the right to have drugs in a public venue"
but the fact that no matter how tight the security (i
was all but strip searched to get into an event in the
bay before leaving on principle alone) there is a .01%
(my own random figure) chance that someone will be
able to get drugs into an event and ANYONE can take
them before hand.  because of the .01% and the fact
that 100% of the people who take the drugs before hand
will get in, that event (not rave but event, concert,
play, prom, etc.) can be shut down and the promoters,
venue owners, sound crew, etc. can all be fined.

granted, they got rid of the "know's or reasonably
ought to know" bit, but still all that needs to be
proved under the current law is that someone was on
drugs because, after all, everyone "knows" (thanks to
20/20 and frontline) that raves (events, concerts,
proms, etc.) contain drug use...

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Act consciously, do not be unconscious

i don't "support a drugless rave scene" just as i
don't support a "drug rave scene", to each there
own...

i've danced my ass of sober many, many, many times...

i don't listen to trance, ew (joke, well not really
but... i do shed a tear to certain tunes)

i find it acceptable to talk and be friendly to
strangers daily, don't you?

"still tolerate mars & mystery & skills style music,
sober all night long" - hell, i can't tolerate them on
drugs!  (hehehe, joke... or maybe not)

the fact of the matter is, there doesn't need to
actually be drugs presant (they can find their way
around that technicality)... it's the mere fact that
raves cater to drugs (after all 20/20 and frontline
said so) that makes the events (along with proms,
concerts, etc. as far as i'm concerned) illegal

Subject: [sfraves] segregated prom etc

As a Southerner from Alabama (I am a real, live, honest-to-God/dess 
HILLBILLY), I have noticed that racism began to re-emerge more fully 
into the common social milieu post-Reagan's first election. Before 
that, tolerance for racist crap was seen as rude and impolite, 
something that cultured people just did not do. As really minor as that 
seems to me, that even teensy change in social behavior was a marked 
improvement over the legendary, blatant racism of my home culture.

It saddened me to hear of the resegregated proms in Georgia. What are 
these people thinking????

if what you have is a .rar and not a .raw file.

a .rar is an compressed file format like a .zip, but it has to be extracted
with the application WINRAR, just go to

 www.rarsoft.com/download.htm

and they have all the info you need. basically load winrar, go to the dir
where you have the .rar file, right-click the .rar and extract to, play with
it and you will find it easy to use.

with or without drug use, those puddles of people generally get on my nerves. i can respect that people like to sit in a line and give massages to one another, but also, i don't like it when someone likes to try and drag me into that shhhhiiiiiiiii---tttt. also, i don't even like to see the puddle or the line of people. it is just not attractive in my eyeballs, so i just try to stay out of that area if those kinds of things appear. hopefully, there is more than one room at the party, because if not, i leave, for sure. :) p.s. also, i can't stand group hugs.

i didn't even consider mismatched beatmatching. the human ear is pretty good at compensating for equipment faults and difficiencies. working on scrap builds artistic confidence. another way to look at it is that it shows you actually have ability. i like two mismatched tables and a mismatched cd mixer....ornament the alter as you like. tra-la-la. i also like used cars...prefer them to what's being churned out lately.  :)ES <exitstrategy2@yahoo.com> wrote:that's pretty good advice. i first started off in a studio to make sure i actually liked djing because it's not as easy as it looks. as for tables, remember that they are an investment. if you get the right tables, ie technics, they'll last forever, and maintain resale value. if you get two mismatched tables, they may not be in sync in terms of starting and stopping power, which hurts beatmatching. geri dahl's suggestion of studio time is probably best for cash strapped friends.

Subject: [sfraves] The Amber Ages...

    in our current situation and drug/non-drug paradox in the rave scene, i 
think it might be appropriate to create a "darker" more "jaded" scene to 
mystify ourselves creatively and artistically. i think there is a distinction 
that can be made out of a "ideal" rave for a person on ecstacy or other drugs 
and a "ideal" rave for a person who is sober. me personally, if i'm gonna be 
sober, i like dark techno and deep tribal house. maybe throw in some jungle. 
I think the dark sound symbolizes some sort of cause in the world and reason 
to be pissed off.
     on the other hand i love happy and melodic techno as well, epic trance, 
bubble gum, caroony, happyhard core bring it on.... but i like to save that 
music for times that are worth celebrating, and when i celebrate, i'm more 
likely to use substances. and considering this new laws we have now jepordize 
the lifes of people who produce parties... far be it from me to bring drugs 
into someone's partly that clearly says "no drugs" on the flier and what not. 
    So i'm just asking any DJ's out there who read this... please spin us 
some dark tunes because i do love the rave scene, but i am in no mood to 
celebrate untill this amber bullshit gets set straight.

now, i wouldn't be *that* depressed.  we haven't actually seen what the
real-life effects are of this law yet.  a few years ago they passed a
no-smoking law in all the bars in san francisco, yet when you walk into many
bars, not only can you smoke in them, but there are ashtrays.

also, remember that new orleans case.  they've already tried sending people
to jail for things like what this amber alert tackon supposedly allows them
to tack on.   just because something has become law doesn't mean it can't be
either modified or even struck down in court.  perhaps that case of the past
will end up helping in some way.

...also, just try to put yourselves in the opposition's shoes for a minute.
i just briefly glanced over the 2002 version of what passed, and while some
of it is obviously exaggerated, some of the things might be a little bit
true, both due to irresponsible promoters and irresponsible partiers.
perhaps there will be a way for the responsible ones to survive relatively
untouched through the amber ages.

...then again, maybe it will be like that movie "The Running Man" where
they've got Osby, AndyW, and Mike Migurski running for their lives on
national TV for crimes they didn't commit!  get the popcorn!  well,
hopefully it won't be that bad.

so, anyway, i think we've got to wait and see what happens next.

fog out

Subject: Re: [sfraves] IT'S OFFICIAL: RAVING IS ILLEGIAL, a rebirth

I'll have to take Nick's stance on this one.  Unfortunately I can't decide
yet whether it'll be a futile act..trying to make parties drugless and
enforcing it so.  I mean, all it takes is someone to have a pipe or someone
who wants to make money by selling a pill or two to just fudge it up.  How
do you fight the powers that also say "I can check out what books you
checked out at the library cause we think it might be essential to national
security"-- "The Patriot Act").  The law makes it self so it's pretty damn
impossible to coorperate with it unless you have drug sniffing dogs and cops
doing the searches.  Kind of pointless if you ask me.  The cup to the
underground has been given to be filled up with the juice of responsibility.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] IT'S OFFICIAL: RAVING IS ILLEGIAL IN AMERICA!!!

This has little to do with drugs, and a lot to do with the elimination
of a way of feeling, a way of thinking, and a way of life that grows out
of it.

Last year, we flooded the Senate with phone calls, faxes, and petitions
opposing this bill.  The appearance of such a political force out of
nowhere alarmed the powers-that-be.  It seems that it also strengthened
their determination to crush us,  so much so though that they employed a
blatant end-run around what is left of the democratic process to do it. 
No debate.  No vote on the measure by itself in either chamber.  Just
hook it onto the popular Amber bill that nobody dares to oppose.  In the
conference committee.  Even by Washington standards this is over the
top, but it got nary a peep in the media.


This law will drive our scene underground.  WAY underground.  They hope
to drive us so far underground that we lose any ability to make a
difference in the world.

Then kids in Iowa, Tenessee and Danville will never see or hear of such
a thing as a rave.  They will never dance except as part of the
socially-approved courtship ritual.  Many will never engage in *any*
significant physical activity that is not competitive.  Most will never
hear about PLUR.  They will hear a lot of other things on TV and believe
them.

It has become fashionable to put down PLUR, because Peace, Love,
Understanding, Unity and Respect seems so hopelessly far from the actual
human condition.  But consider the alternative:

War, Hatred, Misunderstanding, Divisiveness and Disrespect have become
government policy and are well on their way to becoming the new American
way of life.   We may be the only ones who can stop it.

The ruination of our spiritual lives is not a side-effect.  It is the
real motivation for passing such laws.  If they can destroy us
spiritually, then they can enslave us absolutely.

geri,

you can tell your friend from a knowing source that if you're talking about
being in the military, you go to work at 7 just like everyone else ...
usually whether or not you've been up all night on watch or whatever.  most
people would rather stay at home, and who can blame them?

I have to agree with Andy here...this is not really about drugs.

Illicit drugs have and will continue to be used throughout American society 
whether clubs and raves are closed or not.

It is important to pound into legislators and the public's collective 
consciousness that EDM events are not the cause of the increasing use of 
MDMA, nor are EDM participants the primary users of the drug.  While it is 
generally true that experimentation with new ideas, fashions and drugs 
arise in subcultures these "innovations" are rapidly adopted by the 
mainstream society.

One would really like to have more data here, but I can't believe 
intuitively that the multi-billion dollar MDMA industry is solely supported 
by dancers.  Those who attend music and dance events are a very small 
percentage of the population.  Even if every one of us downed five pills a 
day, seven days a week, this would account for a fraction of overall 
ecstasy sales.  If all of us were to be locked up tomorrow, MDMA sales 
would not, I believe, be significantly diminished.

Clubs and other EDM events, however, are easy targets for the 
government.  This is all somewhat analogous to my grandmother's experience 
during prohibition.  She loved to dance, and the best music and dancing was 
to be found at speakeasys, where illegal drugs (booze) were sold.  Although 
my grandmother disliked alcohol, and rarely drank, she would be hauled off 
to jail in a paddy wagon for her late night activities.  Her father, 
however, who was from Europe, thought is was crazy that Americans would 
prohibit him from drinking beer.  He sent his kids to a local neighborhood 
brewery regularly for buckets of brew, as did all his neighbors.  My great 
grandfather, therefore, was a bigger "criminal" than my grandmother, but 
she was the one that ended up in jail.  She, however, did not stop 
dancing.  Folks were not easily controlled in those days.

The larger issue is, of course, our culture's ambivalent and irrational 
treatment of recreational or pleasure-giving drugs.  As we all know, drugs 
of various types have been in use recreationally, or for religious and 
other purposes, since the beginning of time.  Most recreational drugs that 
are now illegal were readily available and legal a hundred years ago.  It 
is not surprising that with advances in technology synthetic drugs like LSD 
and MDMA should hit a market that has in the past, and will in the future, 
demand substances that enhance pleasure or perception.  Nothing really new 
here.  The traditional, accepted, legal drugs like alcohol and nicotine are 
to my mind inferior and often more dangerous than many of the illegal drugs.

Given the realities of humankinds' love of mind altering substances, my 
position has always been that criminalization does not work.  For that 
subset of users who have addictive problems, treatment is the only 
option.  For the majority of users who do not have addiction problems harm 
reduction and education are the only way to keep people safe, as well as 
some product safety control.  But taking this position is dangerous these 
days, and difficult to argue in the current resurgence of Puritanism.

I'm not going to engage in self-flagellation here.  I have nothing to be 
ashamed of, and I personally will not succumb to fear-based government mind 
control.  If the government wishes to shut down dance clubs and events of 
all sorts, well, they really needn't find drugs at any venue to do 
so...eh?  They can bring their own, and "discover" them.  You can strip 
your patrons naked to prevent drugs from entering your venue, pass out 
Miller Beer T-shirts, and dance to "God Bless America" all night -- won't 
make a difference.

I do think that those who really care about our community should not buy or 
sell illicit drugs at parties.  There have been promoters who have been 
involved in these activities in the past, either directly or 
indirectly.  No drug dealers will ever be permitted to sell drugs at a 
Moksha party and dancers, in my mind, should not support on-site 
sales.  This would take much of the heat off of the scene.

Finally, it is ironic that some really dangerous drug use has emerged in 
the dance community and elsewhere as a result of economic pressures, 
irrationally focused drug enforcement, and relatively easy manufacture -- 
crystal meth.  It's cheap.  It's "American"  -- we give speed to our troops 
(interesting aside, we have not fought any war in the twentieth century 
where the troops on both sides have not been on speed  -- think on that for 
awhile).  You can find it in rural communities as well as urban.  And to my 
mind, it is now destroying the gay dance community.  Crank abuse is what 
folks should be worrying about at present, not E or bud.  But, hell, none 
of this makes any rational sense.

Love,

Apollo

i agree with you.  these laws shouldn't exist.

unfortunately, we don't have enough people that care making noise.  when
we're in a climate like we are today, a few hundred people sending emails to
their local congressman isn't going to make much impact.  no one knows what
it would take to make the pro-rave movement (or whatever we call it now) as
large as the civil rights movement of the 50's or the anti-war movement of
the 60's, if it ever will.

i think people ought to have the right to do what they want, as long as it
doesn't involve murdering other people, which is what many people think drug
dealers are, something i don't agree with either, but hey.

it's funny you mention this, because the book i'm writing, a science fiction
book that combines something like star trek, groove, and stephen king's the
stand, has a main character that comes to the same realization that you do.
these laws shouldn't exist.  it's the turning point to something i haven't
fully created yet, and i don't know if i'll actually ever finish it, but i
do work on it regularly, i got it up to 200 pages, then viciously hacked it
down to 83 pages, and now i'm back up to about 90 pages.

anyway, this wasn't really intended to be a bsp, i was just trying to say, i
do care, but i think it's a precarious balance for one to care too much or
too little.  either way too far and we risk not being very effective.

later,

DF

I was just thinking to my self about what was going on in my life in the last 
past 2 weeks *also the last past month 1/2* and well now I have told my self 
that I made my choices now I must lay in a bed of dirt. 

Why do I deserve the things I own and have? 
Why do I deserve the G/g or X-g/f that I love and care so much about?
Why do I deserve the music I pound my ears to hear?
Why do I act the way I do?
Why do I feel so down all the time?


*****MY reason is that the reason i am a shity person is because of how i 
changed in the last few months*********

I think I need to become a member if a church and help out with caring and, 
etc., making life better for others. Why should I live and tell my self how 
much I hate things and how much I hate the actions I do? Why not just go and 
help outer people be happy and see the light put a few smiles on there faces 
and just see the pure joy of love.

So now I just know I have had to much time to think if I am telling all of SF 
& Sac raves about how shity of a person I am without gaining into 
details......

I love Break Beats jsut to let everone know.....


SO PEOPLE SMILE ON ONE ANOTHER AND LOVE ON ANOTHER...


***I LOVE YOU MELISSA***

    I'm not saying that I expect there to be a movement of masses of people 
that we, the SFraves list, personally organize ourselves. You don't need 
anyone else to help you fight the government, you don't have to write 
letters, you don't have to have a parade you don't have to storm the white 
house (although those are very effective actions) All you need is yourself. 
All you need is art, and music and spirituality and symbolism. You can, in 
fact, make a difference just by walking down the street, you can make a 
difference by the way you dance, the way you write, the way you talk, and how 
you treat other people.
    You personally are the most powerful source on the earth that you will 
ever know. You can make a difference just by the way you look at people.
    For instance whenever someone gives you an attitude that reminds you of 
the way the government treats us.... you can give them a look like you'd like 
to kill them but you don't believe in fighting.   And whenever someone gives 
you an attitude that is remenisant of the old rave scene that we all know & 
love, you can give them props and encourage them to keep it up. With that 
philosophy alone you could effect hundreds of people a day. It's all subtle 
you know... it's all in metaphors, there are things going on around you that 
you have the power to change, and it's works in chain reaction. I suppose 
it's like the idea of "think globally, act locally" but it's even more subtle 
than that. locally does not nessesarily mean your community organization, 
your church and your sociology class. 
    the real revolution happens in your mind. People don't just read an email 
and all of the sudden get all fired up and gather into a big crow of maniacs 
to change the world forever.
    i think it was in the matrix that morpheous said something like "the 
world you live in, is one of illusions. and the war we fight, is a spritual 
one"
  I think of the rave scene as sort of a global *underground railroad* 
because we use it to gather and exchange ideas, style, faith and 
inspirations. The african-american slaves used to sing songs that gave clues 
and told stories, sometimes metaphorically on how to escape the plantations 
and how to make it to safety (i.e. folowing the north star all the way to 
canada) these songs took place right under the noses of the slave owners, who 
probably dismissed it as some sort of "nigger talk" excuse my french. Well 
guess what? they were dead wrong, and this movement started a chain of events 
that led to the civil war, and eventually the end of slavery  and racial 
segregation. 
    well the rave scene is similar in which it is used to exchange ideas 
about freedom (mostly metaphorical) and it happens right under the noses of 
the government. Our government probably dissmisses it as a crazy new age 
hippie drugfest. But guess what? They are dead wrong as well. Sure we can sit 
here and try to look at it in their point of view and make excusses for them 
why they treat and think of us so badly. but common, what is there to be 
guiltly about?? Don't you think all of us, as ravers, have done a tremendous 
amount of good in the world in the recent years? don't you think the 
inspiration behind a lot of that good, comes from our happiness that we get 
energy from the rave scene? 
    Anyway the point is that the rave scene is a *SLOWLY* evolving 
underground railroad to true freedom. If you don't think the rave scene is 
evolving then why don't you go look up some of the SFraves archieves from 3 
or 4 or 5 years ago and tell me if you think they are just as inteligent and 
revolutionary as the disscussions we are having now. maybe they were for 
their time but our inteligence is on the incline, at a drastic pace. even the 
hip hop scene is catching on. do you think Conscious hip hop would be the 
same today if not for the influence of the rave scene? i doubt it. it might 
not even exsist as a genre if not for our support. 
    I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say that the rave scene is a bit like 
Christ. In a sense that it's easy to say that it's dead and it's not coming 
back, and technically be right. And I suppose there's a sense of security in 
knowing you're right. but to take that chance... to not know for sure, but 
believe anyway, in something that you can't see with your own two eyes, to 
have courage and faith in, not religion, but music, and dance and 
revolution....that's... that's some shit.

  Raving as we know it is pretty much dead. In Eastern thought it's called 
impermanence, a law of the universe where there is the "dying" of one 
phenomena and the rebirth of another, like without a sunset, there can never 
be a sunrise.
  Going underground isn't really going to work. First of all, the 5-0 is 
pretty much on to us, and I assume they are prepared and willing to find them 
out and shut them down. Who among us are willing to face 20 years in prison 
to throw a UG? Those parties that may be able to slip under the radar of the 
law will become very dangerous. These will be parties where the drug problem 
will be worse, parties that will most likely be thrown by drug dealers and 
other shady characters, attended by mostly by kids and will just exacerbate 
our situation.
  I absolutely agree this anti-rave law sucks Great Dane dicks and is 
blatantly unconstitutional and a paranoid reaction by the powers that be to a 
legitimate problem, plus like I said it will put raves further in the hands 
of the people that got us in the situation we are in today. We need to stand 
up against this Orwellian legislation. But we need to think here for a 
moment, what kind of scene are we fighting for? Are we fighting for a scene 
that has been pretty much taken over by drug dealing? are we defending a 
scene that has too much capital venture promoters, rock star DJ's and egos 
bigger than the planet Jupiter? Are we wasting our energy spinning our wheels 
in the mud and getting all worked up over a scene that facilities 15 year old 
e-tardness? Personally count me out! I haven't been to a party for almost a 
year now, partly because i don't have the money; unemployed now, partly 
because I felt I need to back off and re-center my self, but most of all, I 
was beginning to feel very uncomfortable going to parties attended by a lot 
of kids, some almost young enough to be my kids, not that raving with kids 
was the issue, but seeing them fucking themselves up and feeling being there 
I was supporting their destructive behavior and giving a nod to the promoters 
who were either totally down with this or too busy counting their money to 
give a shit!
  The scene I will get fired up is a scene where the promoters love techno, 
not how big their parties are and how much money they are making, a rave 
scene where the DJ's care about the people, not their images, a rave scene 
where the people think community, not just themselves and go off and hide in 
their little cliques, a rave scene where PLUR is the reason to go, not to 
take 5 pills and lay on the floor all night and get light shows, a rave scene 
where spirituality, how ever you choose to define spirituality and express it 
is the vibe, not narcissism.
  There will never be drug free parties, let's not bull shit the point. The 
only people we are BS'ing is ourselves if we think otherwise. Where ever 
there will be people, sure enough there will be drug use of some kind. That's 
not really the issue. I'm not pro drug use nor am I anti drug use, I'm pro 
responsible drug use by mature adults. My personal opinion, and this doesn't 
have to be everyone's truth, truth is fluid and not so ridged and black and 
white, is that in certain situations drugs can be a positive experience for 
people, and in certain situations it can be a negative experience for people. 
For some people, drugs = trouble. Drugs don't mix well with adolescence 
because their bodies and minds are still developing. Most drug addictions 
begin in the teenage years. We all need to know what situation is best for us 
and respect each other's attitude about drugs. I believe the war on drugs is 
a sham and a black hole for this country and I believe that drugs should be 
decriminalized, and certain drugs like pot, even MDMA, LSD and shrooms (all 
psychedelics) should be outright legal for adults. I should be able to sit in 
the privacy of my home and smoke my dank in peace without worrying about the 
cops breaking down my door and hauling me off to jail like I was a terrorist 
or something.
  Raves should be about the music, but if anyone does decide to use drugs, 
raves should be a safe place to do so, around people who will not judge you 
and take care of you. But when you go to a rave and stumble over e-puddles 
and seeing people OD'ing, are we not being our own prosecuting witness?
  Here's what I think we can do. Let's get together and start having forums 
on how to rebirth the electronic music scene, part truth and reconciliation 
style, and part everyone being able to be heard and their views and ideas 
being respected, that from these forums solutions and a new scene will come 
out and we can have a new scene that will not just be a real people's scene, 
but a scene that will be a legitimate rebuttal to the rave antagonists and 
the war on drugs. We can ask Dance Safe, EMDEF, the ACLU, SFLNC and other 
allies to participate and to give us support and wisdom. what do you think?
  While on the subject of drugs and such, I heard the other day William 
Bennett, Poppa Bush's drug czar, the guy who said if we legalized drugs there 
would be 50 million drugs addicts in America, the guy who wrote the Book of 
Morals, admitted to loosing millions at gambling casinos. His excuse was that 
because "he didn't spend the milk money" it was OK. We have a chance to seize 
the higher moral ground here. Let's do it!
 Peace to all, Bodhi ^ _ ^

Paradigm X

By Jarret Keene, Las Vegas CityLife
May 5, 2003

I'm almost ashamed to admit that one of my most powerful literary=20
experiences as a child took place during the summer of 1981, when I paid 75=
=20
cents at the corner grocery in Tampa, Fla., for a comic book called "The=20
Uncanny X-Men." I had been following the title for many years, but nothing=
=20
I'd read up to that point even hinted at the scary ideas and images inside=
=20
the "SPECIAL DOUBLE-SIZED 150th ISSUE!"

I say almost ashamed, because it was in a comic book that I gained insight=
=20
into the spiritual cost of being different. Sure, I learned about=20
significant things in other books I read that summer. "Animal Farm" taught=
=20
me to beware of fascists in revolutionary clothing. "The Adventures of=20
Huckleberry Finn" taught me how the best adults make for the worst=20
hypocrites. "The Red Badge of Courage" taught me about the horrors of=20
modern war.

But it was the X-Men who demonstrated how being gifted meant being feared=20
and hated. It was and remains a hard lesson.

The X-Men were created 30 years ago by the legendary Jack Kirby (who also=20
created Captain America, the Fantastic Four and the Incredible Hulk). X-Men=
=20
#150 ("I, Magneto ... ") wasn't written or drawn by Kirby. Instead, Chris=20
Claremont and Dave Cockrum did the honors and succeeded in expanding the=20
existential foundation that Kirby laid 15 years prior. The X-Men were=20
misfits bound together by their freakish powers. They were a powerful=20
symbol for the way I felt about my own misfit status. Like the young=20
mutants, I was a "gifted" student enrolled in a "gifted" school where I=20
took "gifted" classes apart from the larger student body, who naturally=20
looked at me with suspicion and a bit of envy. If my powers had consisted=20
of something more than the ability to read a lot, perhaps they might have=20
grown to fear and hate me.

Being different was the red badge I wore growing up, and I wore it proudly=
=20
with others like myself. It was a privilege the X-Men characters could=20
never afford, because their powers consisted of flying, bending metal,=20
becoming metal. They were weapons, like Wolverine, whose powers were=20
heightened by military scientists, making him a weapon of mass destruction.=
=20
Still, they wanted to be accepted, not persecuted, for their unique=20
qualities. It's a universal feeling, particularly among adolescents, as=20
they discover how they differ and =96 more often than not =96 learn to=
 suppress=20
rather than flaunt the talents they're born with.

Persecution is an ideological game, one played expertly and to the hilt=20
during Reagan's '80s and Dubya's '00s. Cold War brinkmanship is another=20
game that has returned to the headlines. It's the game the mutant villain=20
known as Magneto tried to disassemble in X-Men #150, a comic book I still=20
possess today. In it, when the character Cyclops questions Magneto's=20
resolve to protect mutant kind with a pre-emptive attack on humanity and=20
its nuclear arsenal, the super villain replies, "For myself, I am tired of=
=20
seeing things as they are and asking why, of dreaming of things that never=
=20
were and asking why not. I have the power to make my dreams reality. And=20
that I shall do."

As a child, I understood that Magneto had a point, and I found that point=20
frightening. As columnist Patricia J. Williams writes in the April 28 issue=
=20
of The Nation ("Taking the Cake"), pre-emption "is the Bernhard Goetz=20
doctrine, the cowboy rationale, as well as the hip-hop anthem, shoot first,=
=20
ask questions later. It is a scared gangfighter's way of thinking, and it=20
ensures a never-ending cycle of trauma, in which illusions of danger are=20
treated on par with reality, in which waves of endless violence engulf all=
=20
sane limits."

What horrified me as a child is that Magneto's words were often echoed in=20
the speeches of my cowboy president =96 and now as an adult I hear them in=
=20
the words of the New Cowboy. This sense of horror at our leaders' dreams of=
=20
death is something I've longed to encounter in comics =96 and movie=20
adaptations of comics =96 ever since. After all, comics have always been a=
=20
subversive medium, from Marvel Comics' anti-nuclear stance to Crumb's=20
underground revolution to Alan Moore's deconstruction of Victorian England=
=20
in "From Hell." But all the mainstream comics industry and Hollywood have=20
given us is the same crap, specially formulated to sell Happy Meals. From=20
Superman to Batman to Spider-Man to Daredevil, it has been nothing but a=20
consistent, brain-deadening attempt to pander to the lowest common=20
denominator. Sadly, it works.

No more. I can't fully explain why director Bryan Singer's sequel to his=20
shoddy first foray into the X-Men saga is a superior, thought-provoking,=20
thrilling example of genre filmmaking. (It seems the same hacks who brought=
=20
us that cliched showdown atop the Statue of Liberty in X-Men were involved=
=20
in the making of X2.) But I can outline some themes and moments in "X2:=20
X-Men United" that reveal its subversive spirit and bold vision.

The opening scene, for instance, is harrowing. A mutant (whom we later=20
learn is named Nightcrawler) enters the White House, teleporting his way=20
through Secret Service agents and into the Oval Office. There, the=20
president cowers amid 30 or more agents, their guns drawn, waiting for the=
=20
mutant to break down the door. Instead, he teleports through the room,=20
viciously beating the agents into submission, until it's just him and the=20
Big Man, pinned to the desk. Nightcrawler pulls out a dagger, ready to=20
plunge it, but an agent recovers enough to wing the assassin, who then=20
disappears. The dagger is left sticking in the desk; a note attached reads:=
=20
"Mutant Freedom Now!"

When has a Hollywood superhero flick been this hardcore? Singer (The Usual=
=20
Suspects, Apt Pupil) must have ordered his screenwriters and production=20
crew to put their balls on, because from here things just continue to=20
intensify.

The assault renews the political and public outcry for a Mutant=20
Registration Act, a gross erosion of civil rights on par with the Bush=20
administration's own Patriot Act. Leading the anti-mutant crusade is a=20
wealthy former military commander, William Stryker, played by Brian Cox=20
(Manhunter, LIE), who does his best John Ashcroft impression, as a man=20
whose grievances and psychopathology make him a dangerous administrative=20
figure. He sends U.S. Special Forces to attack Xavier's School for Gifted=20
Youngsters, and the images of soldiers shooting mutant children in the neck=
=20
are absolutely terrifying. There's a moment when the clawed Wolverine (Hugh=
=20
Jackman) =96 who alone is left guarding the school while the X-Men search=
 for=20
Nightcrawler =96 shish-kabobs a dark-hooded intruder. It freezes the heart:=
=20
Mutant has killed man, and there's no going back. The war is on.

Indeed, the humans' effort to pre-empt another mutant attack has wrought =96=
=20
as the Israelis and Palestinians fail to acknowledge in their treatment of=
=20
each other and as our own leaders refuse to perceive =96 more violence. As a=
=20
result, the evil mutant Magneto (Ian McKellen, The Lord of the Rings)=20
unites with the X-Men to fight a common foe, the U.S. government, and=20
impending disaster haunts every subsequent frame.

There are other chilling scenes. Teenaged Bobby, or Iceman (Shawn Ashmore),=
=20
briefly shelters Wolverine and two younger mutants at his parents' house.=20
There, he "comes out" to his family that he possesses unique powers, to=20
which his mother replies, "Have you tried not being a mutant?"=20
Heartbreakingly, Bobby's brother immediately phones the authorities, and=20
the group is again on the run. Fear shatters even familial bonds.

Then there's the scene where Magneto lures Pyro (Aaron Stanford, Tadpole),=
=20
Xavier's student, to the dark side. "You're a god among insects," he says,=
=20
flattering the burgeoning pyromaniac. "Don't let anyone tell you=20
otherwise." Mutant power is a curse, until it's used to harm others, the=20
weaker ones, humans. Then it becomes a mark of supremacy.

I could go on. Of course, X2 has everything the rubes expect from=20
Hollywood: lavish special effects and violence. The pill beneath the sugar,=
=20
though, is that the violence serves as a warning about the direction our=20
country is headed. Mindless fear and policies of intolerance will result in=
=20
a cycle of bloodshed from which no one will be spared, not even the=
 innocent.

Who are the innocent? Singer's new movie offers no answers. Rather, X2 is=20
full of troubling questions. If all summer movies were this daring, comics=
=20
enthusiasts would no longer have to suffer inferior Hollywood adaptations.=
=20
Indeed, the American superhero comic book is a mythic genre that has=20
finally been translated into a remarkable film. Let's see if American=20
audiences will embrace or loathe the long-awaited breakthrough.

"X2: X-Men" United opens Friday, May 2.

look at it this way....you go to a massive party, and like 10 dj's or so will play the same song at least once in their set...so, if you are at the party the whole night, then you'll hear the same song ten times at least...that's pretty good, huh? and it is kind of like shopping at a furniture store or a high end audio shop...10 different sales people will tell you ten different times during the 10 minutes that you are in the store that such-and-such is a great model. at least you know for sure now which one not to buy! :)

RAR is not an audio format, but a compression scheme like zip, sit or gz.

Try typing "*youroperatingsystemhere* RAR archive freeware" into
Google.com.

It's the stars, man. The planets have been all out of wack for a while now and everybody is really emotional. I used to belive in antidepressants and all that shit, now its nutrition, yoga, and astrology. Have yourself a big bowl of fresh spinach and walnuts, and folow it up with a little low fat rocky road, do some twisting yoga poses, and cuddle with a loved one in front of the tube (no friggin "news" shows! Watch some Animal planet or cartoon network or the simpsons, or some good old fashioned chuck jones looney toons) or to some chill tunes of your choice. Some nice tea wouldn't hurt either, the kind you make from leaves in a little ceramic pot and get at tea shops with sweet little asian ladies. Call or Email an old friend you haven't talked to in a long time, give a panhandler a nice peice of fruit, and if you still feel shitty, go for a hike in some nature, or pick some strawberries, and buy or pick a flower for you or someone you love.

Subject: [sfraves] May 17th

If anyone is headed to the Festival of Bass gathering on the 17th, 
my boyfriend and I could use a ride.  I will gladly cover all of 
your gas costs in exchange.  Providing food and camping gear is 
also something that we would be happy to do.  My boyfriend is 
trying to get out of an evening work shift that would end around 
10:30 in Oakland, because we'd love to be there at sunset.  
Otherwise, we'll be ready to leave at 10:30pm on Saturday.  We can 
rendevous near any BART station if need be.  
 
If you have space in your vehicle for us, please call my 
boyfriend's cellphone at (510)301-8951, or leave us a message on 
our home phone at (510)450-0167. 

Thanks!

Subject: [sfraves] Groove Garden

--=====================_4926396==_.ALT
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"; format=flowed

I think much of the "rave is dead" talk one hears these days has little to 
do with the realties of transformative dance groups I see evolving in our 
community.  When many people use the term "rave" they seem to be referring 
to the mainstream, commercial-style massives and other events that have 
attracted the attention of the public, government and marketers over the 
past few years.  What I have seen, however, is the creation of a 
multiplicity of EDM families in the Bay that manifest the vibe and 
intention of old school "raves," yet have adapted to their communities and 
changing times.  Let's call them spirit-based dance communities if the term 
"rave" has become meaningless.

Groove Garden is one such community.   GG, the creation of Martin Tickle 
(DJ Dragonfly), has been going down once a month for nearly four years in 
Marin.  In addition, Martin has thrown several parties in San Francisco.

I first met Martin at some Kelly's Mission Rock party.  He was spinning on 
the upper dance floor and I was much impressed with his craft.  We talked, 
and he put me on his email list for future GG events.  Had it not been for 
this chance encounter I probably would never have known about his little 
tribe and its philosophy of putting the dancer's needs first.

I attended several SF-based GG parties over the years, the last a sybaritic 
affair held at Studio Z featuring an amazing crowd of costumed dancers, 
drummers, live acts, male and female belly dancers, and an extraordinary 
vibe -- much like early raves.  I had never, though, gone out to the 
monthly GG party.  My bad.  Guess I thought it wasn't worth the drive for a 
Saturday night party that ran from 8:00 PM to 1:30 AM.

When Fraser Clark arrived in town I notified Martin, and he extended an 
invitation for Fraser to speak at the last GG Saturday night.  We all drove 
out to Fairfax and I had my first experience with this happy tribe up north.

Martin achieved a remarkable thing with GG.  He has integrated a regular 
EDM party into the community around Fairfax.  The party is held in the 
local church.  No police presence.  No security.  People of all ages are 
welcome.

The vibe and aesthetics are certainly Marin:  a sort of New Age cultural 
base transformed by electronica and brought into the twenty-first 
century.  GG is certainly "organic."  Virtually everyone dances in bare 
feet.  An ample and tasty selection of vegetarian foods are available as 
well as teas, ciders and a ginseng/l-carnitine energy drink that was quite 
effective. No alcohol.  No drugs except for some bud smoking in the outdoor 
garden.  Very friendly people and accepting vibe.  And people of an 
astounding range of ages dancing energetically all evening long.

The party begins at eight, and for the first couple of hours there were 
grade-school aged kids dancing with their parents.  Quite nice.  As the 
evening moved on, a more mature and diverse crowd rolled in.  GG is very 
well attended.  One man I talked to was seventy-one.  He had lost a lung to 
cancer, but he came every month to dance.  Another guy I talked with 
outside in the garden was from Santa Cruz.  Mid-twenties.  A year ago he 
had a life-changing experience at a 13Moontribe full moon rave and was just 
learning about the dance community.  I even ran into Mercutio, who I have 
not seen for awhile.

Now, I am an urban dancer used to a more gritty, edgy scene.  But I must 
say this happy, healthy environment was quite appealing.  Women left their 
purses unattended on chairs.  Lots of trust.  No drama.  Lavish 
decorations, including old school oil projections.  A proper chill room 
with ambient music.

The music rocked my soul.  DJ Dragonfly's set -- funky house mixed with 
world beats and music -- was most excellent.  Martin is rather laid back 
when he is not behind the decks.  He is a wild man when he is spinning.  He 
beats on electronic drums over the house, and at one point he had a trained 
opera singer on the PA singing lyrics to some old disco.  All night long 
there were drummers in the back enhancing the mood.  Again, everyone danced 
with much fervor -- both young and old.

Last month Martin and Rhythmystic began a weekly event on Thursday nights 
in San Francisco called Alchemy, dedicated to transforming "the dance 
experience through the infusion of spirit, spark, and groove" at Mission 
and 8th.  Alcohol-free.  Shoes optional.  All ages.  Haven't been yet, but 
I'm looking forward to seeing how GG tribe will do with its own brand of 
spirit-based dance in the City.

When I hear "death of the scene," therefore, I am somewhat bewildered.  The 
community is transforming itself.  I just happened upon Groove Garden.  I'm 
sure there are many such intentional dance families out there.  Not mass 
advertised.  Not at clubs.  Developed through email lists and personal 
invitation.  Different vibes.  Different folks.  But all dancing to EDM, 
integrating the dance floor into their lives, and in a small but consistent 
and ultimately powerful fashion changing the world.

Much love,

Apollo

Subject: [sfraves] anti-rave legislation covered in 5/15 rolling stone





sorry if this has already been posted, i didn't notice it on any of the
digests:

page 30

<  Trouble in Clubland: Congress passes controversial anti-rave bill

By Jenny Eliscu  >

Dance clubs, concert halls and even outdoor festivals are in danger of
being put out of business thanks to a new piece of legislation that passed
in
Congress on April 10th. According to the bill, any individual who owns or
operates a venue where audience members are using drugs could be sent to
jail
or subjected to steep fines. Sponsored by senators Joseph Biden (D-Del.),
Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) and Joseph Lieberman (D-Conn.), the bill was tacked
onto
the Amber Alert Act, concerning child abductions - a move opponents say was

intended to avoid close scrutiny. (The new law is a revision of an earlier
proposal known as the RAVE Act, an acronym for Reducing Americans'
Vulnerability to Ecstasy.)

"It isn't just a threat to the rave community," say William McColl,
director
of National Affairs for the Drug Policy Alliance, "but to any community
that
isn't liked by the majority - hip-hop events, gay and lesbian circuit
parties, even rock & roll shows like the Grateful Dead or Phish." McColl
acknowledges it could be years before anyone is prosecuted but says the law

may scare off promoters and keep them from holding raves.

Biden was unavailable for comment, but his office directed Rolling Stone to

speak with the Partnership for a Drug-Free America.  "We're not anti-rave,"

says that group's spokesman, Howard Simon. "This isn't like John Lithgow in

Footloose telling people, 'Good God, don't dance.' This could help
authorities to go after the few bad apples turning a winking blind eye to
drug use."

Donnie Estopinal, the New Orleans promoter who was unsuccessfully
prosecuted
in 2000 under the federal "crackhouse statute," doesn't see it that way.
"This law will definitely have an effect on whether promoters can get
access
to venues," he says. "Just the threat of being prosecuted is enough to
scare
people away.

"We already search the hell out of everybody," he continues. "It's harder
to
get into a rave than it is to get on an airplane. We're forced to treat our

customers like criminals before they even get in the door."

(sorry for any typos)

PROPS and THANK YOU to ROLLING STONE!

i think the writer does a fine job of explaining to the general public what

just happened legislatively to us and why we, and not just us, should be
concerned.

if you agree, please write to rolling stone and say so:

This quote really bothers me.  I'm thinking Patricia neither watched Cowboy 
movies nor listens to Hip-hop.  The Cowboy culture and gangsters do both 
use violence as a means to an end, but the similarities stop 
there.  Hip-hop and gangsta rap are not one in the same.  There is no 
Hip-hop anthem which promotes violence of any sort, that I know 
of.  Furthermore, I doubt Patricia was a former gang member; I think any 
one could tell you that danger is not an illusion.

I couldn't read the whole article because it has spoilers, and I haven't 
seen X2 yet.

Sounds like you are going to the wrong parties...But I know what you mean.Recently, may favorite UG venue hosted a party put on by my favorite HH group, and now the owners of the venue put a blanket ban on HH as a reaction to seeing etard 15 year olds, and worring about parental involvement and their own responsibilitiy, sadly, a few young kids are inadvertantly killing their own scene by using drugs, I hope something happens simalar to what happened with punk scene and we start seeing "Straight Edge" ravers.

hey, so maybe then the term 'candy flip' will become more literal ...
flipping candy, and maybe 'hippie flip' will refer to straight edge ravers
beating up hippies that do drugs.

that's a nice thought, but i hope we don't see too many of these types of
people, i'm sorry to disagree.  i think that's like taking a rubber band and
stretching it beyond its limits.  either the rubber band breaks or snaps
back.  

i think it would be better if people just learned to be more responsible
with their substance use and learned to say 'no' or 'enough' a little more
often.  this country has a horrible problem with that not just with drugs,
but alcohol and food.

i think we are actually talking about the same thing, and probably agree
more than we may know.  sometimes when i get into posting a lot, i probably
put off an air that i know everything and i'm always right.  neither are
true, though sometimes i'll drive a point into the ground and it looks like
such.

i think this is happening all over the country, to some degree, but more,
perhaps in san francisco.  back to my opinion that the rave scene is
essentially dead, death in itself is also a rebirth of something new .. a
transformation of sorts.  i'm not suggesting it's all over and we all
retreat to our bedrooms and never go out anymore, it's just not like it used
to be.  and hey, maybe that's for the better!

BACK IN THE DAY!!! LOL!! GROOVY lalala ...

anyway, that's my 2 cents.

I dunno about astrology, but I can definately vouch for the other two... if you
extract yoga out into simple "a good workout" instead of a specific exercise.

After a long night of dancing, especially to hard house or happy hardcore, I
get home flat out exhausted, but I feel SOOOOOO good; especially after
showering and getting a bit of sleep.

And as for foods, it's basic chemistry.  Chocolate and coffee contain tons of
mood-enhansing psychoactives (look 'em up on erowid... theres a LOT more in
there than just caffeine!).  And turkey, red wines, some cheeses and some nuts
are notably high in tryptophan, which gets converted into, you know it,
seratonin, that neurotransmitter we know and love so much.  LOTS of foods
contain tryptophan, or others.  The ones I listed stick in my head because
they're so high in it.  That's why the warning labels on some anti-depresssants
(mostly MAOIs, but some SSRIs) tell you to avoid the big three: turkey, red
wines, and cheeses.  The idea is, that your doctor is controlling your doseage
very carefully, and extra seratonin, in those circumstances, is actually bad.

Case in point:  Sarah herself last night, on the chocolate-covered espresso
beans!

Subject: Re: [sfraves] re:STARTING FROM SCRATCH: What shall we do?

Of course 15 yos should be munging pills - we need to train the youth to rely on chemically induced mood swings. Once we have a generation of pavlov dogs that we control we can launch an attack on the white house and start enlightening the water supplies of the masses. Plus, if we're lucky we can cause widespread erectile disfunction and they won't be able to breed.

Totally unnecessary that, sorry. Reality is, I never saw as many 15yo mungers until I came to this country, and it is pretty disturbing. I was talking to a good friend of mine once about what you can do to talk to your children about drugs, and he said 'All I could really hope for was that I could persuade my kids to wait until they are 18', and I agree with his statement. So much more damage is done to young adults from every kind of drug consumption, and I think that if you can just wait a few years you'll be a lot more mentally able to handle your drugs, and you won't hack up your body and mind so much. I think so little is known about the consequences of drug use during puberty and the stakes are so high that it makes little sense to go crazy.


Another question... who here thinks that they would be the same person if they had regularly munged down pills from the age of 13 onwards?

[ie weekly, or whatever you think is excessive... or perhaps we should try, 'if you had used the same level of drugs at 13 as you did at 23']

and that's why your post is being exposed. Aren't you
a regretful one!  :)

You want people to please tell you why you are a

You can't be that oblivious toyour own question. The
answer is right below........

ooh, you even used the nasty N-word. Good luck in
making any new friends, SPARCO TRIP.

LOL! , for the record, I didn't actually eat the beans, everybody just 
thought I did because I was acting like a nut case! This is what happens 
when someone with a natural tendency towards adhd and a saratonin imbalance 
gets over stimulated. I felt like shit today! When you become an old lady

9:30pm - Close
no admission

Sounds from a Pretty World: Zygote and Friends serve up Plunder Jazz, 
Abstract Weird-Tempo and Experimental Pop Musique with an electro twist. 
Come early, as the night is usually packed out with super models and jet 
setters of the IDM world........

SPECIAL GUEST May 7th, DJ "Clarity""

Clarity began spinning in the North Bay at the age of 19. Realizing her true 
love for techno in 1998 she quickly swept across rave scene dropping as hard 
and heavy as she could get away with. Playing at parties like Harmony, 
Children of the Sun, Happy Kids, and Flower Shop she definitely had wide 
variety of music lovers surrounding her and with the support of many of 
those promoters she was able to play out at a lot of parties before having 
any DJ recordings out. With a high demand for trance and house, being a 
techno DJ in the community was a challenge.

Subject: [sfraves] Amber alert should only be directed towards minors not us.

    Does everyone here realize that this Amber girl was only 9 years old, and 
from texas? And her abduction had nothing to do with parties or drugs? I want 
to make sure everyone knows that, i know most of you do but sometimes these 
tricky politics can decieve us. i think it should be demanded that this bill, 
if it's going to be continued to be called the Amber alert bill, only pertain 
to minors, and have nothing to do with drugs. 
    It can't be accepted or forgotten that this add on IS the RAVE act (which 
didn't pass on it's own) in deguise.

    the add on is totally unessesary, it's a perfectly well intentioned bill 
all up untill the RAVE ACT add on, and then it's an outrage. They are using a 
good cause to overshadow a hiddeous dislike for the rave scene. It would be 
like issueing a 911 bill about an alert for terrorists and then at the end 
saying in small letters... also middle easterners can no longer fly in planes,
 and then passing the bill.
    If the bill is truely about KIDNAPPING which it claims to be, then we 
should demand that it only pertain to youngsters and NOT everyone who goes to 
parties. and if the government outlaws minors from going to raves then so be 
it. I didn't start going to raves till i was 18 and i'm glad i waited. 
    So anyway i know not all of us have time to protest and do political 
demonstrations and write letters right away. I for myself can say i will 
NEVER again support our government untill this perticular bill gets set 
straight. I'm not moving away to another country, and i'm not gonna do 
something stupid that puts me in jail. but i will symbolically, as an artist 
be anti-(US)government for the rest of my life until things like these get 
set straight. i'll try to write letters, protest and vote, but beyond that 
i'm going to make noise artistically because I'm.... in film school. and i 
have the tools to influence people. (appallo made a good point how films can 
metaphorically be a political statement, such as X-men) 
    I think the government has gone & done it with this bill. it's over the 
line. they have fuct with the wrong people and they're gonna pay for it. how 
it's going to happen i can't tell you for sure but things are going to 
change... and we have the rest of our lives to figure out how. (and if that 
fails we can raise our children to suceed where we have failed) 
    I know a lot of you feel trying to change the government is hopeless but 
I know that we all have friends who have friends who have friends who have 
friends, and i think that every one of us can now agree that the government 
has throuroughly betrayed us. First by introducing the RAVE ACT (which didn't 
pass) and then by deguising it behind a bill that they knew was going to 
pass, as an add on. It's time we plan on taking over america, and getting rid 
of our horses ass policies that make me want to puke. i know it's sounds 
wierd to say "take over america" so lightly in a sentance like it can 
actually be done but i think it can and i'll tell you how in my next email. -

Subject: [sfraves] last week for paypal mindcontrol tix


This is the last week for mindcontrol tickets via paypal.

They may still be purchased through Saturday the 17th at BPM records in
SF, and at Primal records in Berkeley.

Thanks once again to those of you who got your tickets so far in advance.

The rest of you without tix still have the chance to get in on the presale
ticketpacks, and support the subterranean resistance where it needs it:
upfront costs.  Get your presales this week.  Save five bucks, and get a
bunch of trust/mindcontrol related goodies.

More mindcontrol info here:

Shaolin Presents.Our BIGGEST party ever!

June 13, 2003

HIGH OCTANE <~~mini-MASSIVE

============================

 

LOCK N LOAD

The Lock N' Load project consists of two Dutch producers / DJs: Frank van Rooijen and Niels Pijpers. One fine day the Club Caviar boys came to visit the Lock N' Load studio, heard the old version of a song and offered to do a remix of it. In collaboration with Lock N' Load they delivered this stunning result and Niels decided to release "Blow Ya Mind". After all on Blue White Records, within a period of three weeks, it became the No. 1 club record in the Netherlands, and Europe followed soon after that, the United Kingdom was ready to be conquered. Through no. 1 positions in both the UK Club and UK Dance chart it had an amazing entry at 6. Help us welcome Lock N' Load to Sacramento.

Chris C.

Now firmly established as one of the Biggest and most popular DJ / Producers on the UK Hard House/NRG scene, Chris has masterminded the emergence and rapid success of his 3 Labels, Mohawk, Aztec and Nile. Positioning the former today as one of the genres top 5 marques. With over 30 single releases and 2 Albums to his name on various labels including Tidy Trax, Tinrib, Eve, Honeypot, Phoenix Rising, GBT, Bulletproof, etc...Chris' reputation as one of Britain's finest exponent of Hard House, both behind the decks and in the studio, continues to grow.

Whistler

Victor Cape a.k.a. Whistler shines as a highly respected DJ on the Pacific Northwest dance scene. Known for his tight mixing skills and uplifting personality behind the decks, Whistler blends energy and emotion from Hard Melodic Trance, Epic Anthems and Hard House to take his listeners on a dance floor rollercoaster ride. If being a DJ wasn't enough, he also manages Lovetribe which has quickly become one of the most well respected event productions in Seattle. It's been over a year and a half since Whistler's last performance in Northern California. So we're excited to bring him out for his first Sacramento performance!

Ohh coooome on!

How about for starters...


NWA "Fuck the Police" (Woo...sing it y'all)

Right about now, NWA court is in full effect
Judge Dre presidin'
In the case of NWA versus the police department
The prosecution attorneys are M.C. Ren, Ice Cube, and Eazy
Mothafuckin' E
Order, order order
Ice Cube, take the mothafuckin' stand
Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothin' but
the truth, so help yo' black ass?
"You're goddamned right!"
why don't you tell everybody what the fuck you gotta say...

Fuck the police commin' straight from the underground
A young nigger got it bad 'cause I'm brown
And not the other color
Some police think
They have the authority to kill a minority
Fuck that shit 'cause I ain't the one
For a punk motherfucker with a badge and a gun
To be beaten on and thrown in jail
We can go toe to toe in the middle of a cell
Fuckin' with me 'cause I'm a teenager
With a little bit of gold and a pager
Searchin' my car, lookin' for the product
Thinkin' every nigger is sellin' narcotics
You'd rather see me in the pen
Than me and Lorenzo rollin' in a Benz-o
Beat up police, out of shape
And when I'm finished, Bring the yellow tape
To tape off the scene of the slaughter
Still gettin' Swoll' off bread and water
I don't know if they fags or what
Search a nigger down and grabbin' his nuts
And on the other hand
Without a gun, they can't get none
But don't let it be a black and a white one
'Cause they'll slam ya down to the street top
Black police showin' out for the white cop
Ice Cube will Swarm
On any motherfucker in a blue uniform
Just 'cause I'm from the CPT
Punk police are afraid of me, huh
A young nigger on the warpath
And when I finish, it's gonna be a bloodbath
Of cops dyin' in L.A.
Yo, Dre, I got something to say ...

Fuck the police!
Fuck the police!
Fuck the police!
Fuck the police!

SCENE I :

Pull your goddamn ass over right now
Aw, shit, and what the fuck you pullin' me over for?
'Cause I feel like it, just sit your ass on the curb and shut the
fuck up!
Man, fuck this shit
All right smartass, I'm takin' your black ass to jail

M.C. Ren, will you please give your testimony to the jury about
this fucked up incident?

Fuck the police and Ren said it with authority
Because the niggers on the street is a majority
A gang - that's wit whoever i'm steppin'
And a motherfuckin' weapon is kept in
A stand-by for the so called law
Wishin' Ren was a nigger that they never saw
Lights all flashin' behind me
But they're scared of a nigger so they mace to blind me
But that shit don't work, I just laugh
Because it gives 'em a hint not to step in my path
To police, I'm sayin', "Fuck you punk!"
Readin' my rights and shit - it's all junk
Pullin' out a silly club so you stand
With a fake-assed badge and a gun in your hand
But take off the gun so you can see what's up
And we'll go at it, punk, and I'm a' fuck you up
Make you think I'm a' kick your ass
But drop your gat and Ren's gonna blast
I'm sneaky as fuck when it comes to crime
But I'm a' smoke 'em now and not next time
Smoke any motherfucker that sweats me
And any asshole that threatens me
I'm a sniper with a hell of a scope
Takin' out a cop or two that can't cope with me
The motherfuckin' villain that's mad
With potential to get bad as fuck
So I'm a' turn it around
Put in my clip, yo
And this is the sound
Yeah, Somethin' like that
But it all depends on the size of the gat
Takin' out a police would make my day
But a nigger like Ren don't give a fuck to say...

Fuck the police!
Fuck the police!
Fuck the police!
Fuck the police!

SCENE II :

Yo, Man, whatcha need?
Police, open now (oh shit), we have a warrent for Eazy E's arrest
Oh shit
Get down and put your hands up where I can see 'em!
Man, what did I do?
Just shut the fuck up and get yo' motherfuckin' ass on the floor
But I did'nt do shit
Man, just shut the fuck up

Eazy E, why don't you step up to the stand and tell the jury how
you feel about this bullshit?

I'm tired of the motherfuckin' jackin'
sweatin' my gang while I'm chillin' in the shack an'
Shinin' the light in my face and for what?
Maybe it's because I kick so much butt
I kick ass, or maybe it's 'cause I blast
Oh a stupid-assed nigger when I'm playing with the trigger
Of an Uzi or an AK
'Cause the police always got somethin' stupid to say
They put up my picture with silence
'Cause my identity by itself causes violence
The E with the criminal behavior
Yeah, I'm a gangster, but still I got flavor
Without a gun and a badge, what do you got?
A sucker in uniform waitin' to get shot
By me or another nigger
And with a gat, it don't matter if he's smaller or bigger
(Size don't mean shit, he's from the old school, fool)
And as you all know, E's here to rule
Whenever I'm rollin', keep lookin' in the mirror
And ears on cue, yo, so I can hear a
Dumb motherfucker with a gun
and if I'm rollin' off the eight, he'll be the one
That I take out and then get away
While I'm driving off laughin', this is what I'll say ...

Fuck the police!
Fuck the police!
Fuck the police!
Fuck the police!

The verdict :

The jury has found you guilty of being a red-neck, white-bread,
Chicken-shit motherfucker
"That's a lie! that's a goddamn lie!"
Get him out of here!
"I want justice!"
Get him the fuck out of my face
"I want justice!"
Out right now!
"Fuck you, you black motherfuckerrrrrrrrrrr!"

Fuck the police!
Fuck the police!
Fuck the police!

i just said that. i mean, i don't know what else i could say to just completely please the whole world and free myself from suspicion, the paranoid delusions of others, random suggestion or any other sort of negativity that just goes on and on and on. talking about it makes me feel bored, so i can just imagine what living in a little shell of a world like that might do to a perpetually bored soul. oh yes, and lately the obscenities and the racist slurs that have been coming my way have been mightly disgusting, not to mention all the true crime i've been reading about. gross, gross, gross. :)

I am certainly going!

This is going to be a great party. I am driving all the way down from
Seattle for it!  Have you ever heard music played over MTs before?  It is
rare to find anyone using them outside of the mid-west.  It is like having a
conversation with God.

as ed mentioned i'm obviously going too...

in addition to all of the excellent locals who i'm stoked to hear,
there are two performers in particular that a lot of folks here may not 
have had a chance to hear yet:

dis=co! - a fine gent from colorado - on the merciless pounding techno 
front.

and a very special set, for the troopers who make it to the early 
morning hours...
the jungleside is closing down a little early for everyone to gather up 
for chad mindrive,
of nice musique fame. the last time chad played at a trust event was in 
1994...

one of my all time favorite djs from days gone by.

so excited!

Heh...  If I ever become an "old lady" like you, I think I'll have far more to
worry about than a seratonin imbalance.  More like the HORMONE imbalance, and
the suddenly missing important parts of my anatomy.

Well, I can't really comment on much of the punk scene HERE, as I mostly quit
going to shows when I started going to parties.  But if it's ANYTHING like the
punk scene on the east coast (I'm thinking mainly of Florida, Boston, and
Balitmore here.) then I can confidently say that there aren't any less people
getting "fucked up" in that scene than in ours.

Oh, the CHOICE of drugs is sometimes different.  And where/when they choose to
do them is sometimes different.  But there are just as many punks getting
blitzed every weekend as there are ravers.  About the only thing that the
straight edgers do is try to ostracize and exclude the obviously-fucked up
people (And many didn't even do THAT, they were quite happy to socialize with
someone who was high, they'd just stay sober themselves), and make them be more
discrete.

(Now, there WERE the occasional entirely-straight-edger shows, where you just
did NOT show up non-sober, but those were the exception.  And I don't think we
want any poor kid getting a boot party because he took a pill at the wrong
partie.)

Though I've mostly stuck with punk & ska, when I was younger, and raveing, now,
I've bounced in and out of the scenes surrounding a good dozen genres of music.
 Reggae didn't turn me into a stoner, punk didn't turn me into a tweaker,
raving didn't turn me into an e-tard, and grunge CERTIANLY did not turn me into
a heroin junkie.

Though the drugs of choice, and the places it's acceptable to do them, might
vary from scene to scene, it's been my observation that there are people who
will:

1) Never do any drug (either EVER, or ANYMORE)
2) People who experiment, but don't really use
3) People who will use occasionally and casually
and
4) People who will get fucked up as often as possible and screw up their lives

... And you'll find ALL four, in EVERY scene, and by and large, the choice of
music will not affect the fact that all four are present.  About the ONLY
differences that I've noticed in rave scene are, the drugs of choice, and that
users are not ostracized, and they can be non-sober openly, instead of hideing
it as in some others.


cya,
john

I'm certainly going to be in attendance.

I know quite a few others who are, too.

I have a vague feeling I'll be wracked with guilt and self-loathing if I
don't. And Ed might kill babies.

So go to Mind Control.

Or Ed Colmar will kill babies. Really small ones. And cute, too. Blue
eyes. Everybody loves blue eyes. Little blue eyed babies. Dead. Thousands
of them.

Do you want that on your conscience?

Err. I should have said I BET something happens...
http://www.frii.com/~lust/pure10.html
The reason I said that is because I'm sometimes feeling those same emotions 
that turned me into a "Straight Edger" back in the day, we didn't call it 
that yet though. I was on a punk kick because I just learned about 924 
Gilman St. Wouldn't it be cool if raver kids had something like that?

That's true, I want to know why we are getting picked on... "E" its so 
scary...OOOOHHH... it makes you want to hug people...Dangerous!

That's the kind I was... and what I was hoping for when I wished for 
"straight edge ravers" our scene has more than a few people who do this... 
bless them.

Have you met "Giggles"? You know somebody is out of control when they scare 
SCOOBY!

Dude...I know you. If anybody is a role model for "responsible" drug use 
it's you. If everybody took a page from your book, we wouldn't have 
problems with drugs any worse than tripping over spent nitrous shells :)

group 4 is the kind I worry about, if it's not illegal drugs it's legal 
ones, or an eating disorder, or cutting, I think If our society spent less 
time and effort trying to prohibit 1,2,3 from getting drugs, and more time 
and effort helping group 4, before they get to that point, we would be in a 
lot better shape.

Subject: [sfraves] The Declaration of IndepenDANCE

    "All men are created equal and there are certain unalienable rights that 
governments should never violate. These rights include the right to life, 
liberty and the pursuit of happiness. When a government fails to protect 
those rights, it is not only the right, but also the duty of the people to 
overthrow that government. In its place, the people should establish a 
government that is designed to protect those rights. Governments are rarely 
overthrown, and should not be overthrown for trivial reasons. In this case, a 
long history of abuses has led the colonists to overthrow a tyrannical 
government." - Thomas Jefferson

    Respectively, things may seem trivial so far, but I think we can count 
this recent scandal as strike one...

Subject: [sfraves] (nrr) Quote of the Day (Wed)

They had a great thread going on yesterday on the DCRaves list about a club
that has a dress code, when the website said something about it being for
people dressing the way they want.  I guess they meant you can wear what you
want, as long as it's not around them.  Tuck that shirt in, Osby, or you'll
get no candy today!

I think that thread brought an interesting point to light in my mind ... the
rave scene originally wasn't necessarily about going to a drug party with
music.  I think people do that at normal clubs all the time, despite all the
hype and security, and always have.  It was more about getting away from
clubs that had strict dress codes and always managed what the DJ would play
tonight instead of letting it be more free-flowing all the way around.  What
do you think?  

Anyway, thanks to cypha on the DCRaves list for his funny signature at the
end of his message, which was funny too.

Subject: [sfraves] NRR: cross-posting considered harmful

Hey folks,

I don't mean to sound like a curmudgeon here, but if you're going to
cross-post messages to multiple lists, or send the same message to a
group of friends, please use the Bcc field. Not only is cross-posting a
pain in the ass for list admins to deal with, but exposing your friends'
addresses to public mailing lists isn't really a great idea, either.
Thanks for your cooperation.

It's more iterative than conditional, really...

#!/usr/bin/perl -w
# vim:et sts=4 sw=4 cindent:

use strict;

my $who = 'Melissa';
my $term = 'forever';
my $refrain = sprintf('Love me now or love me never but if you love ' .

my @whens = ('I wake up to you on my side', 'we kiss',
             'I pick you up off the fool and spin you in circles',
             'we fight and have a bad day',
             'I am there for you to cry to and when I am here to ' .
			 'listen about your life',
             'I ask you to be my girl till the end of time');

printf("Love Poem to \%s\n\n", $who);

foreach my $when (@whens) {
    print "$refrain\n";
    printf("Love me when \%s.\n", $when);
}

printf("I love you Melissa. Please love me now and \%s.\n", $term);

0; # or should the exit code be non-zero?

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Love Poem To Melissa *YOU KNWO WHO YOU ARE I LIVE
	YOU*

The poem to Melissa is nice. I was touched by it.

Remember this, your actions must speak louder than your words. What appeals
to her lies deep in yourself. Learn from your mistakes but do not live in
the past. Be honest with your feelings and thoughts. If you cannot do that,
then a relationship cannot exist until you do so.

If you love her, you must have the patience to allow her to adjust (to let
her go). Be yourself and work with your emotions through beautiful music and
beautiful people. Place a picture of Melissa in your car on the dash or
wedged up in the rear view mirror and look into her eyes while you listen to
beautiful music. You'll feel your heart and your spirit. Nothing can ever
touch that.

In time, you will heal and reach a higher purpose. Should Melissa give you
her spirit once again, you both will be stronger.

Good luck!

Best regards!

Subject: [sfraves] Re:Love Poem To Melissa *YOU KNWO WHO YOU ARE I LIVE YOU*

I don't know Melissa, and I'm sure she had her faults. But I'll bet that you 
were probably being an ass that's why she left you. Rarely do women just 
pick up and leave because they want to hurt their loving, caring boyfriends. 
It happens, but it's not usual. More often than not, the dude brought it 
upon himself.  Try to see how you can improve yourself so your next 
girlfriend won't have to deal with your crap.  Also getting on a rave list 
with this snivelling mess of a poem, hoping that she'll come running back to 
you, is a big mistake, and it makes you look to her like a whimpering 
pitiful piece of dung.  Instead of wanting to come back to you, she's 
probably thinking "oh my god get me away from this clingy, suffocating 
wretch." Your best chance to get her back is to run in the opposite 
direction. Give her space, and work on being an emotionally strong man any 
woman would respect and esteem. As a matter of fact, FORGET ABOUT HER!  Get 
on with your life. You've got some work to do. Harsh words, I know. But I'm 
not trying to make it sound pretty to you or even being mean. The quicker 
you can come to terms with the stark reality, the quicker you can get on 
with the business of self improvement.  Take a long hard look at yourself. 
It's not about Melissa at all. It's really about you.

I'm coming to san fran from humboldt this weekend and was hoping someone could give me some info on a good party, or even a club with a good vibe.  I just moved here from new orleans about 6 months ago, and have only been to san fran twice, so i have no idea where anything is.  Last time i went to a club that looked good that i saw on sfraves.com, met a couple kewl people there, but it was mostly yuppies in suits getting outta limos, i guess i prolly don't need to explain the vibe.  Any info would be greatly appreciated.  It's been a long time since I've gotten to get my groove on, and i don't wanna miss an opportunity peace,phil

yea, thinking back to the very first parties i went to, i don't remember 
harder drugs being really prevalent, except a nitrous tank and people 
smoking out here and there. the way people dressed was way varied too... 
you had people from lots of different scenes, all colors, all freaks, 
converging in one place and it was truly diverse... it might have been 
looked at by some people as an alternative to going to a club... then 
again i was maybe 15 at the time and there was only one club i could get 
into at that age anyway. i wouldn't have been able to make the comparison.

after maybe a year or so that began to change, and you'd have tons of 
people tripping at a given event... that was widespread for a long time, 
before e really made its way to the midwest...

Yeah, I went for years and didn't even know E existed until that 20/20
report, then it was everywhere.  But I miss my desert parties :(  I went
to 99% of my parties completely sober as to not become a stat because it
meant so much to me.  I did my expierimentation at house parties and 16+
(in reality 12+) goth/industrial clubs.

yea, thinking back to the very first parties i went to, i don't remember

harder drugs being really prevalent, except a nitrous tank and people 
smoking out here and there. the way people dressed was way varied too...

you had people from lots of different scenes, all colors, all freaks, 
converging in one place and it was truly diverse... it might have been 
looked at by some people as an alternative to going to a club... then 
again i was maybe 15 at the time and there was only one club i could get

into at that age anyway. i wouldn't have been able to make the
comparison.

after maybe a year or so that began to change, and you'd have tons of 
people tripping at a given event... that was widespread for a long time,

before e really made its way to the midwest...

Subject: [sfraves] musical hunt.

Hey!

   I'm trying to find out the artist of a song.
I saw the video  back in '99 in Germany and I think the song is "It don't
matter" or "It just don't matter" or "It doesn't matter"  In the video there
is a bussiness guy walking down the street and his briefcase is blown open
by a big gust of wind.  His papers go everywhere.  One point he loses a shoe
in water off of a dock.  The video cuts back and forth btween this business
guy and a band singing the song.

   I know it not much to work on, but any thoughts on what it could be would
be helpfull.

   Thanks!

   -Andrew RB

I think this is cute and romantic.  :)  There isn't enough POSITIVE on this
list, just grammar slammers and nitpickers.

People are partially a product of their environment, and if it weren't for
an abundance of cynical / jaded haters making the delete key a way of list
life, stuff like this would actually help create smiles not smirks.

So um, dude, I don't think you should send a complaint to the entire list,
you should email your uh intended recipient privately, or else you'll look
like a big fucking hypocrite ... KTHX

love always

Hey there, 

   I believe that it could be "It Doesn't Matter" by the
Chemical Brothers if its a stomper tech house track with some
acid lines tossed in...OR...it's that track that Wyclef did with
the Rock if its hip-hop! LOL  I haven't seen the Chem video and
don't remember the Wyclef one...so there ya go! ;-)  Take
care...

Subject: [sfraves] NRR: Dude Ranch Duds for Cowboy clubbing

Well howdy folks,
I was invited to a party this weekend, a small club-ish affair, but the theme is
cowboy attire.

I'm from Texas, y'all, but I don't have any western wear. Now I am getting some
ideas about apparel.

Some of those western shirts are nice, but they look kind of hot/sweaty, esp. if
you are dancing.

And how about those cowboy boots? Can you actually dance in them? I get tired of
my Nikes coming untied; maybe boots are the answer! LOL...

I don't think a cowboy hat would be too comfortable while raving/clubbing, but
maybe I am wrong about that, too. I'm just afraid it would go flying off my head
when I am getting groovy.

Anyway, I was just looking for some feedback on "Texas attire" or cowboy
get-ups.  Where can a guy go to get some "dude ranch" duds? I want to look the
part for the cowboy theme party, but not sure about spending all of the
hard-earned bucks.

Then again, I could re-invent myself during the shopping process. And y'all
could just call me "cowboy Tex." Lookout line dancing, here I come! I am just
feeling ironic because I moved here and now the "western theme" follows me.

And I'm kind of feeling like getting in the mood of the party; it's fun to
"Dress up" sometimes.
Gregory VP

Subject: [sfraves] hooray for sage! (new mix-cd out 5/20 :)





your grrl sage was just named resident of Sonar, a great baltimore club=

owned by dj's lonnie fisher (ultraworld) and lovegrove (sonic soul)!  w=
e're
stoked!  =3D)

here's some interesting info off a press release about Sage, and a
tracklisting for her new mix-cd below ...

Sage's recent troubles and triumphs are revealed in her new mix CD due =
out
May 20th 2003, entitled Drum & Bass Elements 01. Mixed by Sage on Moons=
hine
Recordings. Through her extreme dedication and love of Drum and Bass sh=
e
was
able to handle her father's long illness and passing while keeping her
career moving forward. "This has been the most difficult few years of m=
y
life. I just feel grateful for all the support I=B9ve gotten. I come fr=
om a
huge Irish family and honestly every single one of them would cut off t=
heir
right arm for ya! Looking back, the amount of help I've received from
colleagues in the dance music industry as well as from fans is
overwhelming.
I can=B9t help but to feel very fortunate."

Perhaps it was her musical training or just innate ability, but it was
apparent from the start that Sage's musical sensibilities made her an
exceptional DJ. Noel and UFO!, as founders of the well known DJ collect=
ive
'Phunckateck', immediately recognized her skills and invited her to be =
part
of their crew.

Sage started her musical endeavors at the age of 4 in her native Kansas=
,
with the piano. Her love of music and her talent soon had her graduatin=
g to
the violin at the age of 6. Drums later became her instrument of choice=
 as
she began playing in punk bands during her pre-teen and teen years in
Ireland. Having worked in record stores, played in jazz and indie rock
bands, she has always had an appreciation for all musical genres. From
Choir
to Music College that she attended on scholarship, it was seemingly
pre-destined that Sage would choose a career in music.

Still in touch with her roots, she is currently working on an indie roc=
k
band project called Meathe with fellow well-respected techno DJ/produce=
r
John Tejada, which provides her an outlet for drumming and singing as w=
ell
as playing guitar and bass on occasion.

Besides being a DJ and producer, she currently runs her own record labe=
l.
Phylum Recordings (one of the world's only all female owned record labe=
ls)
with partners Elektra and Susie Lee. With a well-received mixed CD unde=
r
her
belt entitled Stateside Sessions, Volume One, Mixed by Sage, and two ve=
ry
successful singles on Phylum, Sage continues to receive accolades from
peers
and fans alike.

Since 1997, Sage has been closely connected with the skateboard communi=
ty.
In 1999 she was approached by the world's largest skate shoe company DC=

Shoes and asked to join their team of DJ's. Since then, they've feature=
d
her
in 2 ads, and she has modeled for them in their catalogue. She carries =
the
DC logo everywhere she goes as DC's one and only female representative.=


This upcoming year will see Sage touring extensively around the US and
Canada to promote her new mix CD, hitting some of the towns where she
crashed with friends and fans on her long trips to and from Ireland.

Alongside DJ's Irene and Mea, she has been asked to participate in a
documentary due out in the Fall/Autumn 2003. World Party and Moonshine
Movie's "Three Chicks and A Bag of Tunes" will outline the day in the l=
ife
of all 3 women as working DJ's in the electronic music scene.

Press, peers and sponsors all love Sage, see what they say below:


"(Sage is) one of the hardest working DJ's in the scene, it's a true
testament to her character how she can travel, DJ, produce, mode, and s=
till
come off as one of the most genuine and truly inspirational performers
around. With that the best is yet to come for America's first lady of d=
rum
&
bass. Watch out!"

	Goodwill is your best friend. The Goodwill's' when I lived in AZ
were full of wranglers and other clothes you could tell easterners sent
their nieces and nephews for Christmas believing everyone out west was a
cowboy. Good luck and props to the production crew with the balls to do
something a little out of the norm. Peace

Subject: [sfraves] NRR: Dude Ranch Duds for Cowboy clubbing

Well howdy folks,
I was invited to a party this weekend, a small club-ish affair, but the
theme is
cowboy attire.

I'm from Texas, y'all, but I don't have any western wear. Now I am
getting some
ideas about apparel.

Some of those western shirts are nice, but they look kind of hot/sweaty,
esp. if
you are dancing.

And how about those cowboy boots? Can you actually dance in them? I get
tired of
my Nikes coming untied; maybe boots are the answer! LOL...

I don't think a cowboy hat would be too comfortable while
raving/clubbing, but
maybe I am wrong about that, too. I'm just afraid it would go flying off
my head
when I am getting groovy.

Anyway, I was just looking for some feedback on "Texas attire" or cowboy
get-ups.  Where can a guy go to get some "dude ranch" duds? I want to
look the
part for the cowboy theme party, but not sure about spending all of the
hard-earned bucks.

Then again, I could re-invent myself during the shopping process. And
y'all
could just call me "cowboy Tex." Lookout line dancing, here I come! I am
just
feeling ironic because I moved here and now the "western theme" follows
me.

And I'm kind of feeling like getting in the mood of the party; it's fun
to
"Dress up" sometimes.

if you want to feel safe in the world, then you can relax once you learn that tons of people wear uniforms to let you know sort of what they are like and what they are associated with, so you can pick and choose your every movement with ease...for example, people who aggressively loiter in front of stores and public bus and train stations sort of look similar in dress, and after a while, you will be able to recognize an aggresive, potentially angry person who means you harm to just your regular passerby...another example is the strategic use of eyebrow highlighter by people like myself...kind of pretty in the right light, also, sort of slutty in an ambush sort of way. :)

Subject: RE: [sfraves] uniforms and highlighter enlightenment nrr

I'm confused, sweetie...
did you just reply to your own post, or were you adding to it?

:)

...and in a vain attempt to make this rave related: Do ravers wear a
uniform, anymore, do you think?  Has the 'raver look' been commodified
enough that it's just for halloween, or was it ever a real 'look' to
begin with?

later

P.S. [just because I'm a curious bored little person]: why isn't the
unsubscribe info at the bottom of either of your emails?  or, hrm, I
suppose any of your emails for that matter now that I look at it...

there's also genuine cowboy stores, that sell all cowboy stuff.  there's 
one in Chico, but I'm not sure where they'd be in the bay.

a well fitting cowboy hat won't come off your head while you're dancing, 
but don't expect a nicely made hat to be cheap.. in fact, a lot of cowboy 
stuff is made out of leather, which isn't nearly as cheap as cotton or 
synthetics.

Subject: RE: [sfraves] NRR: Dude Ranch Duds for Cowboy clubbing

You know the funny thing is a couple of years ago I would actually go to
parties every now and again in dark blue jeans, a cowboy hat, my hair in
ringlets and a pink sequined tube top..sort of a rhinestone cowgirl if you
will...lol It was fun mainly because people would freak out and think you
were a total weirdo for wearing such a thing. I guess I liked to stand
out..kind of like when I would dress up in hot pink and roller skates for a
goth event my friend threw ;)

there's also genuine cowboy stores, that sell all cowboy stuff.  there's
one in Chico, but I'm not sure where they'd be in the bay.

a well fitting cowboy hat won't come off your head while you're dancing,
but don't expect a nicely made hat to be cheap.. in fact, a lot of cowboy
stuff is made out of leather, which isn't nearly as cheap as cotton or
synthetics.

There's "Western Wear" at McCarthy Ranch at 880/237 (Milpitas/Santa
Clara-ish).

Bet some of the stuff's expensive though....

I'm going to have to send this quote out a little early, as i'm going to be
pretty busy tomorrow and i don't know when i'll be able to connect until
perhaps late at night.  living on the east coast is like living in a sauna
24/7.  someday, when i come back to my home city to live again, i will
appreciate the mediterranean climate.

phhueeaace!  (that's how my little brother says it)

UNDER THE RADAR DJ Night at Julip
http://www.julipsf.com/
839 Geary Street ( between Larkin and Hyde )
9:30pm - Close
no admission

Sounds from a Pretty World: Zygote and Friends serve up Plunder Jazz, 
Abstract Weird-Tempo and Experimental Pop Musique with an electro twist. 
Come early, as the night is usually packed out with super models and jet 
setters of the IDM world........

SPECIAL GUEST May 7th, DJ "Clarity""
VISUALS by: Killamac (freebeats collective)

Clarity began spinning in the North Bay at the age of 19. Realizing her true 
love for techno in 1998 she quickly swept across rave scene dropping as hard 
and heavy as she could get away with. Playing at parties like Harmony, 
Children of the Sun, Happy Kids, and Flower Shop she definitely had wide 
variety of music lovers surrounding her and with the support of many of 
those promoters she was able to play out at a lot of parties before having 
any DJ recordings out. With a high demand for trance and house, being a 
techno DJ in the community was a challenge.

I'm sorry, I wasn't trying to bring anybody down. CF
is full of good people. but I think this is a little
exessive. I criticized CF and now I'm told doing so is
just awful. I'm also compared to some kind of
music-manipulating Pepsi executive. I'm even told the
Grateful Dead were corporate.

that doesn't even make sense. I'm sorry, you guys are
just gonna have to chill. don't chill with me, don't
chill against me. just chill. because you're freaking
out. I call CF communist, you respond with
descriptions of sex with Stalin?

Stalin's dead, dude. either you can't tell the
difference between a communist organization and a
homosexual necrophiliac communist organization, or
(more probably) it wasn't Stalin at all, but Captain
Crunch in a Russian uniform. either way, I think this
is too much.

some of my opinions were actually pro-CF, like when I
said that I too have had some of the best times of my
life at CF events. and saying ppl lost their way is
not such a dramatic criticism, really. losing your way
is something that happens to good and bad alike.

apologies for any hurt feelings.


Giles

You might also check Worn Out West in the Castro.  They used to have a

>>Some of those western shirts are nice, but they look kind of hot/sweaty,

>>
>>And how about those cowboy boots? Can you actually dance in them? I get

>>I don't think a cowboy hat would be too comfortable while

>>maybe I am wrong about that, too. I'm just afraid it would go flying off

"Many persons have a wrong idea of what constitutes true happiness.  It is 
not attained through self-gratification, but through fidelity to a purpose."
-Helen Keller

"I know what the great cure is:  it is to give up, to relinquish, to 
surrender, so that our little hearts may beat in unison with the great 
heart of the world."
-Henry Miller

"Loyalty is the realization that America was born of revolt, flourished in 
dissent, became great through experimentation. Our tradition is one of 
protest and revolt, and it is stultifying to celebrate the rebels of the 
past while we silence the rebels of the present."
-Henry Steele Commager

Subject: [sfraves] Thursday morning radio- bsp

I'm playing on KZSU's an Epiphany of Sound tomorrow (thursday) morning,
sometime between 10 and noon. UK Garage, 2-step, breakbeat and whatever
else I pull out of the crate. Maybe some of the tunes I've been working
on too:)

Subject: [sfraves] BSP: DJ Science on An Epiphany Of Sound

Howdy all,
I'd like to welcome you all to listen in to An Epiphany Of Sound today
as we bring you the stylings of DJ Science.  He's sure to serve up some
tasty 2-step and breaks today, and maybe drop some of the music he's
been working on himself.  We do it during the normal timeslot, 9a-noon
today.  Do tune in, 90.1 FM in the bay area, or
http://kzsulive.stanford.edu online.

If you're interested in getting into your favorite club for free, I've
got giveaways for 6 different club events this weekend ranging from
booty shaking house events to butt kicking tech-style events.

Talk to you!

that we are to stand by the President right or wrong is not only

American public."

KZSU Radio or Stanford University." (or words to that effect.)

Subject: [sfraves] Friendster Happy Hour & Elastiq

So where were all y'alls lazy asses last night?? ;) 

Zack and I drove all the way to the city to go to the Friendster
"meet-up" and well, out of the 5 people that showed up (we arrived
around 7:30), I knew them all (since we planned on meeting there). Not
even a DJ showed up! I had a blast, tho!!! That bar was hella cute!
Looked like a cave near the back and was a total hole-in-the-wall. The
bartender was awesome. Tequila stories, free drinks, even my first SF
shooting! 

Yes, everyone, someone was shot 5 times right at the corner of 6th &
Market last night. And we got to witness all the craziness. A wonderful
beginning to a fun night...

I got rightly trashed on tequila shots (bartender thought I was very
brave *hehe*), loaded up the friends and went to Il Pirata for some
Justin Hale and AndyW goodness. I met more people at this place then
the Friendster meet-up... Mmm Peyton. 

And I got to talk codshit all night! LOL

So... went home and ended up sleeping in an hour past my alarm. Luckily
I made it to the BART just in time for the next train that would still
get me to work on time. I am SOOOOO hungover. Luckily, the others in
the office understand and we're taking it easy today. I'm still
lightheaded & fuzzy. Hell, I was still drunk when I woke up.

Happy Thursday everyone!!! The weekend begins... At least for me.
Jessica

PS - and Ryan... where were you?? You're the one who announced this
thing... slacker. ;)

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Friendster Happy Hour & Elastiq

I decided to tear apart the front end of my car and rip out all the old AC
system under the hood. Kinda got carried away and ended up not finishing
until after 10pm. That's where I was. Oh and I was just passing on the
message for Polymorph. =)

Subject: [sfraves] Friendster Happy Hour & Elastiq


So where were all y'alls lazy asses last night?? ;)

Zack and I drove all the way to the city to go to the Friendster
"meet-up" and well, out of the 5 people that showed up (we arrived
around 7:30), I knew them all (since we planned on meeting there). Not
even a DJ showed up! I had a blast, tho!!! That bar was hella cute!
Looked like a cave near the back and was a total hole-in-the-wall. The
bartender was awesome. Tequila stories, free drinks, even my first SF
shooting!

Yes, everyone, someone was shot 5 times right at the corner of 6th &
Market last night. And we got to witness all the craziness. A wonderful
beginning to a fun night...

I got rightly trashed on tequila shots (bartender thought I was very
brave *hehe*), loaded up the friends and went to Il Pirata for some
Justin Hale and AndyW goodness. I met more people at this place then
the Friendster meet-up... Mmm Peyton.

And I got to talk codshit all night! LOL

So... went home and ended up sleeping in an hour past my alarm. Luckily
I made it to the BART just in time for the next train that would still
get me to work on time. I am SOOOOO hungover. Luckily, the others in
the office understand and we're taking it easy today. I'm still
lightheaded & fuzzy. Hell, I was still drunk when I woke up.

Happy Thursday everyone!!! The weekend begins... At least for me.
Jessica

PS - and Ryan... where were you?? You're the one who announced this
thing... slacker. ;)

NO CROSSPOSTING.

bad bad bad... 3 different groups in one email. There's this thing called
*bcc* BCC those lists. Crossposting creates problems for list admins and
returns junk mail to people like me saying *bla bla bla you're not sub'd to

GOOD MORNING FROM PORTLAND, OR      

 

What a day for house music. What a day for deciding to book a deep house
dj who can and will work your crowd. Why you ask should I book this
person there is plenty of good talent around. This is why, because I am
a kind hearted soul who enjoys walks on the beach and throbbing sound
systems. I do not have a self inflating ego I prefer to just enjoy the
beats and dance my poor white man dance. Another good reason is this no
travel costs. I am going to be in your area in about 2 months and just
need bookings with a small fee to go get my fix of vinyl from your local
shops. If you need to hear the beats here they are please do take the
time to listen as I have taken the time wait patiently while the mix
uploaded. To listen click the following link or paste it into your
browser. Http://www.flavoredclubbing.com/strawberry/ohmix2.ram 

 

 

 

 

 

If after all this you are reading and smiling but you are not a promoter
please take the time to pass on my mix or name to your favorite
promoter. 

 

 

 

Now for a little about me. I am originally from Tucson AZ where I was
initiated into the rave scene in 1992 and then continued to party and be
stupid until 1995 when I got my first turntables. Living in the middle
of nowhere forced me to teach myself all that I know. In 1997 I moved to
the Bay Area and from there continued to the great NW. I now call
Portland my home and will continue to do so until I am lured to another
city with a promise of a better life for me. So please take the time to
think would you like a dj from Portland on your flyer? Would you like a
dj who can work a crowd? Would you like this dj for only small fees and
no travel costs? Well would you? Now quick hit the reply button and let
me know your dates and I will send you a contract and then when I get
the notarized contract back I will mark my calendar and see you on that
date. Pretty simple so what's stopping you? Oh yeah it is me stopping
you because I am still typing.....

 

Goodbye and remember Peace, Love, and Roller Skates

It's all good. I'm sure you had fun working on your car. 

Just kinda sad more people didn't show up... 

And I feel a lot better. Mmm, lunch good. BTW - tomatoes are great
hangover cures. One of my coworkers told me about this. Or tomato juice
w/ a little lemon. Or a Bloody Mary. >;) Yummy tomatoes.

Subject: [sfraves] NRR: Track Listing?

This disco house type song starts out with a filter effect, you know that 
muffled sound like you are hearing the music from the parking lot before you 
get to the party? and then it oh so slowly but gracefully smoothly clears up 
into a deep throbing funky disco house beat. and the lyrics just say 
something like "Live your life... be freeeee"  "be, freee"  "be, free"  and I 
believe those are the only lyrics to the song. the lyrics sound all sparkly 
too, like they are coming from the sky or something it's a fucking dope song. 
They play it for about a minute or two on the radio sometimes. The party 
station lol   Somebody tell me who this is by and what's the name of the 
track so i can find it!
    Also there's another song i'm looking for which has the "Rock the casbah" 
beat in the back ground but it's been totally remixed all housy and with new 
lyrics. This song I MUST find as well.

and cable provider to all be owned by one company.  NBC, ABC, CBS and
Fox could have the same corporate parent.  The resulting concentration
of ownership could be deeply destructive to our democracy.

Congress is supposed to guard against monopoly power.  But the
upcoming rule change could change the landscape for all media and
usher in an era in which a few corporations control your access to
news and entertainment.  Please join me in asking Congress and the
FCC to support a diverse, competitive media landscape by going to:

http://www.moveon.org/stopthefcc/

You can also automatically have your comments publicly filed at the
FCC.

When the folks at MoveOn.org talk to Congresspeople about this issue,
the response is usually the same: "We only hear from media lobbyists on
this.  It seems like my constituents aren't very concerned with this
issue."  A few thousand emails could permanently change that perception.
Please join this critical campaign, and let Congress know you care.

Thanks.

"Many persons have a wrong idea of what constitutes true happiness.  It is 
not attained through self-gratification, but through fidelity to a purpose."
-Helen Keller

"I know what the great cure is:  it is to give up, to relinquish, to 
surrender, so that our little hearts may beat in unison with the great 
heart of the world."
-Henry Miller

"Loyalty is the realization that America was born of revolt, flourished in 
dissent, became great through experimentation. Our tradition is one of 
protest and revolt, and it is stultifying to celebrate the rebels of the 
past while we silence the rebels of the present."

Live Element - Be Free, on Strictly Rhythm. Probably the Robbie Rivera
remix.

There have been a couple re-edits of this track. The most popular was
called House the Casbah, on a white label identifying itself as "JF" (I
think I saw this one at Tweekin the other day, actually). Another one,
released early last year, was by House of Crash, IIRC. I'm sure there
are others...

Manhattan Judge Orders Club
To Have Drug-Sniffing Dog


New York Lawyer
May 7, 2003

A Manhattan Supreme Court justice who earlier this year allowed a Hell's
Kitchen nightclub to reopen two weeks after she ordered it closed, last
week ruled the club must have a drug-sniffing dog at its entrance to remain
open, the New York Law Journal reports.

Justice Emily Jane Goodman initially closed the Sound Factory on West 46th
Street in February after the city filed an ex parte application claiming
that designer drugs such as Ecstasy and Special K had been sold at the
club.
She allowed it to reopen two weeks later because adequate steps were taken
to prevent drug dealing.

In her latest order, Justice Goodman specified 19 measures the club must
take to stay open, including posting security personnel in the bathrooms.
She also ordered the police to respond to any complaints that drugs were
being used in or near the club.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] uniforms and highlighter enlightenment nrr

I think it's when some dude is just hanging out somewhere and decides 
to harass every pretty girl that walks by. Being a guy, I never 
experience this. But then it dawned on me about two years ago that 
females live in a very different world. They get harrassed about a 
thousand times as much than your average guy because there are just 
some ungentelmanly men out there that just believe they can say or do 
whatever they want to any woman they please. But they'll NEVER do it 
when a man accompanies them.

I've walked miles upon miles of crowded city without any stranger 
ever saying as much as a word to me. But many women, especially 
comely ones, get harrassed about every ten feet!

I'm not saying women are weak and can't handle it. On they contrary 
they, are often tougher then men because this type of shit happens 
every day and most guys are just blind to it because it doesn't 
happen to them.

Empathize,

BS

Also, Saturday is Eva's 25th bday - to be celebrated this weekend at
thump (she's going in for cancer surgery later this month). So if you
see this girl, wish her a happy one - even if you're a total stranger!

night...beesssspeee

i'll try to elaborate in an email later this week but for now i want to
put the (((thump))) party this saturday night with mr. peculiar and
miraculix on your radar.  there is something happening to the global
psytrance sound.  it's getting bigger and more powerful and these 2
artists are helping to lead the charge.

the music will be ripping, full-on trance and the vibe will be palpable.

phatbreaksnfunk from the groundscore crew upstairs too.

http://www.thumpradio.com/thumpparty.cfm

presales have been a'sellin' for 2 weeks - still available on the site
until saturday at noon.

another BSP and a chance to win tix later this week....

:)

peace, trance, and (((THUMP)))!

Subject: Re: [sfraves] uniforms and highlighter enlightenment nrr

I think it's when some dude is just hanging out somewhere and decides 
to harass every pretty girl that walks by. Being a guy, I never 
experience this. But then it dawned on me about two years ago that 
females live in a very different world. They get harrassed about a 
thousand times as much than your average guy because there are just 
some ungentelmanly men out there that just believe they can say or do 
whatever they want to any woman they please. But they'll NEVER do it 
when a man accompanies them.

I've walked miles upon miles of crowded city without any stranger 
ever saying as much as a word to me. But many women, especially 
comely ones, get harrassed about every ten feet!

I'm not saying women are weak and can't handle it. On they contrary 
they, are often tougher then men because this type of shit happens 
every day and most guys are just blind to it because it doesn't 
happen to them.

Empathize,

BS

Subject: [sfraves] Crisis! RE: Dance Culture Spirituality

A week ago I asked you all to fill out a survey for my soiology class.  I 
got a lot of great answers, and was about halfway through with my paper when 
the DB got wiped out.  I only have a few days left before the paper is due, 
so I am humbly requesting everyone to please go back and retake the survey, 
and if you didn't take it the first time, please take it now.  Thank you!!!

ANNOUNCEMENT OF CHANGE OF EVENT DATE!!!

Dear Friends of Electronic Music and Civil Liberties:

With the recent signing of the RAVE Act on April 30th, the resistance 
to 
government attacks on electronic music is gearing up to fight back. 
ROAR! has 
determined that the situation calls for extreme measures.  Formerly, we 
had 
announced a protest for June 13 to display our dissent with the 
repressive and 
ill-conceived law.  We now see a need for an even larger event is to 
bring the 
attention of the public to this law and the consequences to the 
industry and 
civil liberties. In an effort to make our drive to have the RAVE Act 
repealed 
we are rescheduling ROAR!s second ever and even bigger event to late 
summer.  
Event details, including date and lineup, will be announced by the end 
of May.

Expect a bigger, louder event to communicate just how important this 
issue is 
for us. With your help, thousands will descend on Washington, D.C. to 
the 
National Mall for a massive party-as-protest.  On a day of dancing, 
music, 
speeches, art and outreach, ROAR! will spotlight some of the 
world-renowned 
artists that make electronic music so important and politically 
influential 
speakers who can bring our struggle to a national audience.  Together 
we can 
stop the war on dance music culture and community. 

You can help! ROAR! needs people to join its mailing list, help with 
national 
promotions, spread the word and donate. Visit our website for more 
information.

Also, on May 31, expect a mass national day of action, with public 
protests 
taking place in major cities all over the country.  Display anger at 
attacks on 
your civil liberties by protesting in your own backyard.  Expect event 
information soon!

--

ROAR! is a national organization dedicated to fighting government 
threats to 
the electronic music industry and community. With a history of 
successful, high-
visibility media events, ROAR! educates the public and influences the 
course of 
national legislation with the goal of advancing the freedom to gather, 
dance, 
listen to, perform and promote music in a public setting. We 
seek to preserve both the livelihood of all those associated with the 
electronic music industry and the vibrant culture of those who 
participate, as 
well as civil liberties for all Americans.

For updates on ROAR!, the anti-RAVE Act movement and our summer 
party-as-
protest, look to our website (http://www.roargroup.org) or join our 
mailing 
list (join@roargroup.org).

Actually the AC compressor pulley bearing siezed in December consequently
locking out the entire engine. Shot the electromagnetic clutch windings out
the side of the pulley. Given that the system wasn't charged to begin with
and that I had to remove the compressor to make the car work I decided to do
away with all of the AC gear. Don't really care about weight savings. Just
cleaning up after a prior mess. =)

SECRET SERVICE JAMS UP OAKLAND HS STUDENTS
by JR


"(The Secret Service agent) asked me if I knew my rights, and I said
no.  Then he said that I'm not going to even tell you your rights
because of what you said.  .  That was a threat to the government.  I
ain't going to tell you shit because you are owned by us now, you're
owned by the government.  If you lie or do whatever, I'm going to take
you to federal prison and you're just going to be sitting there and
your parents won't know about it," said one of two 16-year-old
Southeast Asian Oakland High School students who were interrogated by
the Secret Service on April 22.

The students' names aren't being used because they did not want to be
identified.  "He asked us questions like was I a good shooter .  was I
a good sniper .  am I good dealing with guns, and what are my thoughts
on the president.  I was in shock and fear.  It was only me, the
principal, Mr. Mok, and two agents."

The Secret Service agents had the students pulled out of class without
parental knowledge or consent and interrogated them in a school
conference room.

"Apparently there was a discussion going on about the war, and many of
the students were expressing some criticism of Bush and the
administration.  And the fact that thousands of people have been
killed in Iraq and things like that.  In the course of this, some
students made some comments (like) well, maybe he should be sniped or
taken out, or something like that.  And another student said Bush is
wack or something like that," said Oakland High School teacher Larry
Felson.

"The teacher was apparently upset about what had been said and the
next day decided to call the police and ended up talking to the Secret
Service.  All we know is that the next day the Secret Service came in
and interrogated these students, each one of them for 45 minutes or an
hour or something like that."  The other student said, "I was very
scared.  I was crying because of what they said to us.  I was very
depressed at the time."

Police terrorism has been getting a lot of attention in the Bay Area
with cases like the murder of Idriss Stelley, an unarmed young Black
man who was shot over 20 times in downtown San Francisco's Metreon
Theater, to the Oakland police who call themselves the "Riders" in
West Oakland, one of whom fled the country while the other three are
facing charges of kidnapping, beating people, planting false evidence
and writing false police reports among other things, resulting in the
Oakland department having to shell out $10.9 million to 119 victims.
On Martin Luther King's birthday in 2002, the SFPD fondled teenage
girls in Hunters Point while holding their parents at gunpoint, and
they gave another youth a concussion and a fractured jaw when he
voiced concern about how his family was being treated.  On Oct.  11,
2002, the SFPD descended on Thurgood Marshall High in Hunters Point
with approximately 100 swat team members, ATF and sheriff's deputies
to break up a fight between four unarmed students, arresting 11
students and one teacher and terrorizing dozens in their classroom
hallways.

Since then, the OPD has run over the feet of high school students of
color who were protesting the war in their communities and the wars
overseas and arrested me and my comrade Rashida after they threw us to
the ground, terrorizing us, scraping Rashida's face on the concrete,
putting their knees on her neck and head and chipping her teeth.  We
also have to include what the OPD did to the Oakland dockworkers and
people who were protesting the war on the Oakland docks on April 7,
when they shot them in the face and body with wooden bullets, bean
bags with scrap metal in them and concussion grenades.

The Bay Area has long been a testing ground for police and law
enforcement terrorism.  Now they are stepping up their game, and the
Secret Service is bringing their terroristic activities that they use
in the streets of the nation to school campuses.  Oakland High just
happens to be the first in the Bay Area that we've heard about.  "We
are advocates for our children.  We're protectors of our youth, so if
anything goes down, we're supposed to be there supporting them 100
percent, and they should feel comfortable to raise anything," said
Oakland High teacher Cassie Lopez.

And she is right.  Education is supposed to be about us questioning
what's going on around us and dialoguing about the world that we live
in.

"The real reality is that we have a president, no matter what the
polls say, that is very unpopular, particularly unpopular in the East
Bay, where people have spoken out against him.  Many people think that
he is the international terrorist," said Oakland High teacher Larry
Felson.

"Many people think that he should be brought to trial and the rest of
these guys that run this closet government that's not really elected
by the people, and many of the students know that here.  So of course
there is a righteous anger about what the government is doing, and a
lot of people express themselves about it in the classroom.  And
that's why we think that what has happened here is an attempt to
suppress students, suppress teachers and create an atmosphere of
intimidation, and we need to stand up against this," continued Felson.
"It sounds like fascism to me, reaching a point where you don't have
the freedom of speech - you can't voice your opinion.  You aren't even
supposed to have an opinion, the way they're conducting business right
now.  I've always let my kids know that you have a right to have an
opinion about everything that goes on in this world, in your
community, in your neighborhood, in your home," said Lopez.

Mok, who has been the principal of Oakland High School since July 2002
and has been working in the Oakland Unified School District since
1990, said, "I am not sure what the School Board or the superintendent
are going to do.  I know that I talked to the superintendent about the
incident, but he didn't indicate to me exactly what his opinion was,
so I can't speak for him."

"I was following the instructions of the Secret Service.  .  Usually
the protocol is to not interfere with their investigations and just
follow instructions.  And that's what I was doing," Mok added.

Just think, is this the kind of person or the kind of school system
where you want to send your children daily, to be miseducated and
programmed not to think for themselves, like this principal?  Probably
not.  You can call Oakland Unified School District Superintendent
Dennis Chaconas at (510) 879-8200 or the Oakland Board of Education at
(510) 887-0152.  Email JR at fire@sfbayview.com


------------------------------------------


ADDITIONAL NOTES:


What makes the story even more troubling is the fact that when the
Secret Service was contacted by newspaper reporter Harrison Chastang
of KPOO Radio in SF, they admitted to interrogating the students, but
said the school may have overreacted by calling them...  They didn't
have to go that far up the ladder..  As an agency they have to respond
to any threat to the President, however, the school could've handled
the matter internally.  Why they didn't is still in question.  It's
not like the school has a zero tolerance policy..  The two students
were not suspended or expelled from school..  Nor do they have
criminal records, gang involvement or anything like that..  So what
was really going on?

All this takes place in the backdrop of several recent incidents
involving Bay Area folks..  One involves Michael Franti and members of
his group Spearhead.  We reported several issues back how Gov't agents
showed up at the doorstep of one of his band member's house and
interrogated the mother about the group's anti-war activities...  They
pulled out pictures of the band to indicate they have been following
them..and showed their financial records and basically attempted to
scare the daylights out the family...

The Franti incident came at the heels of the FBI paying a visit to a
well known Hip Hop activist named Kawal Ulandalay who works for an
organization called APAL and Filipinos For Affirmative Action.  He had
been organizing airport workers and screeners in the Bay Area, many
who were set to lose their jobs in the aftermath of 9-11.  He got a
visit from FBI agents at 2 in the morning who wanted to know if he was
a Muslim [He isn't] and if he loved this country...  Things are
getting hectic..

Also JR gets major props because he not only interviewed everyone
involved he also got them all on our KPFA Hard Knock Radio show the
other day.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] uniforms and highlighter enlightenment nrr

when i was in my late teens/early twenties, i got my consciousness 
permanently raised in this regard...my girlfriend worked as the assistant 
manager of a "head shop" that was located in the gay neighborhood of 
Chicago; i was a slim, long-haired, femme-looking guy with a cute butt, and 
so i got a fair amount of attempted pick-up activity.  i'll grant you that 
gay pick-up lines are at least more tasteful than hetero ones ;o)  but the 
point was that after experiencing people trying to impose a sexual subtext 
on you, you become more aware of how that might feel to others.

Subject: [sfraves] Looking for some good psytrance?



Listening to Ticon's new album, Aero... I am very impressed.  This is
the first trance album I have heard in a while to really excite me.

Good unqiue sounds and beats.  Driving trance tracks can take dubby
detours right in the middle of the track, and go back, without interrupting
the flow at all.  The whole album has more of a "fun" and "driving" instead
of "dark" quality.  Can totally see this as morning music in the best
possible meaning of that word.  Not to be confused with fluffy.  

Best part of this album is production.  One word: Immuculate.  This sound
quality on this album is what other artists should be striving for.  
These guys are pros.

I am going to be coming home from sf at like 2 in the morning on sunday.  I 
think I should put a taxi service number in my wallet.  Got any 
recommendations for a good one?  There are so many!  Also, any idea on 
price?  Not a biggie on the price, I can call once I get a good name 
recommended.

Thanks all.

You know..... come to think of it, I've experienced this all of my life. When I was younger, I also had long hair and a cute butt (of course the only thing that has changed is, I cut my hair). Chuckle chuckle! Anyway, I've always gotten harassed by older, less attractive women. Usually the ones, if you could... in your wildest imagination want to, compliment them, you'd say something like......... "Nice Tooth".  Over the years, they've gotten downright rude and obsene.  The only good thing about this is though, (and I know it's the same for women, only they go for the credit cards and Mercedes') is that when I've bartendered, those are the women that tipped the best. Especially, If I flirted with them. Usually, they had the most money. (Of course, they got it from the guys.... when they were younger and had all of their teeth.) Well, I just had to throw my two cents worth in..... that's all I had was two cents. The good looking women got all of the rest!!! (Including the credit cards and the Mercedes) Woe is me..... I guess I'm just like every other poor schmuck that has hormones.  I do have to say in my defense though..... I treat everyone with respect, I have never... ever... cat-called or whistled at any woman (or man) .... ever. I think it's stupid, rude, and otherwise shows much disrespect for people in general and that includes pulling up to somebody's house and honking the horn for them to come out. If that were ever to happen to my daughter (and she knows it) by some guy.... he'd be wearing a body cast when I got done with him. After which I would be strongly lecturing his parents on appropriate child rearing behavior and, I'm the least violent guy you'll ever meet.  Peace out    Piper

i was thinking about some dates i went on back in the day, and i am so shocked sometimes at some of the things that people will do and say. i am also shocked that i never once flat out looked someone in the eye, and said, "ummm, excuse me, but aren't you a total bum? why are you asking me about my career plans and children?"...i have lots to do as usual. something that you must do when your mister is in the hole and you want him to come out is to bake brownies and put a scoop of vanilla ice cream on the side. works EVERY time...just be warned though, he mightn't ever leave. :)

Subject: [sfraves] Can't hardly wait for outdoor seasonal parties

I was just thinking about how much I am looking forward to warmer weather and
the great outdoor parties that various people throw around here.

I have so many happy memories of my seasons here, although my arrival has only
been since October 2000. It is fun to dance under the sun because it is not
overly hot and humid, like Texas, where outdoor dance parties are rare (you must
have air conditioning in Houston to survive).

Every outdoor party has its own vibe just like indoor rave parties. Lake
Elizabeth was popular for one season, and Stafford Lake (Marin County) gets
used. Last year we had at least two crews choose the McLaren amphitheater in SF
and it was a great place to party.

There is even a different scene from sfraves, the Flagger community. In gay
social circles, these guys have parties in Dolores Park with trance music
(usually Gryder & Hughes as DJs) and they move to a different rhythm than
glowstick heaven by twirling around big, beautiful flags in time to the music. I
want to check out one of these parties, too. I hope they have them this year in
San Francisco.

Anyway, I am just getting excited about seeing old acquaintances under the
bright summer skies and meeting new people as well. 

See you in the park,
Gregory VP

Subject: [sfraves] (BSP,NRR) DETROIT - Sunday Night @Skylark

Greetings from "DETROIT"!

thank you all who attended last Sunday night's fantastic kick-off to our weekly toasting to the spirit of musical tradition and innovation that is Detroit. We are excited by the turn out and just how well the mix of music connected with the crowd for a really great vibe. This sunday we'll be hosting the second edition of "Detroit" with more garage rock, motown, techno, jazz, hip hop and electro funk, all mixed up with everything in between (Expect to hear a few prominent "influences" as well)!

The party starts at 9 this Sunday night, May 11, at the Skylark, 3089 16st., San Francisco. This weeks featured DJ's include Baby Daddy (Rob Goppold) and 12 Mile (Brian Stein).

thanks - The Woodward Posse

Except for the all-powerful "Type R" sticker; which is good for at least an
extra 30 or 40 HP.  Also, drill some holes in your muffler.  I'm told that the
louder you are, the faster you go as well.

For excellent examples, see:

i realize there are many of you going to see cybertrance commander tom =
saturday night but if you are looking for an updated global trance =
sound, thump radio is bringing 2 massive next-wave full-on trance =
artists to the DNA lounge for (((THUMP))) also on saturday night:

http://www.thumpradio.com/thumpparty.cfm=20

Mr. Peculiar (((tribeadelic records, australia)))
Miraculix (((alchemy records, sweden)))

along with Uphonic, and phoenix family DJs Dr. Spook and Wichdokta.

upstairs is hosted by groundscore with a host of =
rippingbouncingfunknbreaks:

felix the dog, a:dubl, andreas octavia, eric rigsbee, laird, ms. =
throwdown, frogger

we go until at least 6am, so you can probably progress from =
cyber-to-psytrance all in one night!  :)

presale tickets are available at thumpradio.com

 ***ALSO***

a limited # of $15 presales to the infected mushroom show at 550 =
barneveld are now available on the site.  we are offering these $15 =
presales in the hopes that people that could use a break financially =
will take advantage of this discounted price.  so, if you can afford the =
$20 presales or $25 door ticket, please leave the $15 presales to those =
in need.  thank you.

once the $15 presales are gone, the $20 presales will be available...

PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE buy presales for this show - they will go quickly!

it's a great month for trance - big smiles!  :::)  <---sphongle smile!

in goa to check out some of the nu-nrg being released these days. some of it 
sounds alot like psy before it started to tend towards the minimalistic. check 
out some of the later releases on tinrib records (all of which are free on the 
website btw)... peace.

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

 a few weeks ago, a man bought a pretty black push-up bra that i was considering. he snatched it before i could get my hands on it, and then yesterday, i went to a store that mostly gay men shop at, but they have ladies products there..i went there, because my favorite lipstick of the hour was on sale there, and i thought for sure, i'd be able to snag a couple, because, hey, it is practically a totally gay store, but when i arrived, every single lipstick in the entire line was there EXCEPT for MY color. do you realize what that means? that means that the gents are also into my peachy pinks. ...oh, yes, song of the day....parental discretion was advised, i am certain, although, not in my neck 'o thee woods...  "god damn, it was plain and simple...the nine-millimeter went straight the temple....blah, blah, blah, blah...i put the bitch down and ran for the school yard bathroom..." some ice cube and the lynch mob...it's a good skating song. :) :)

Subject: [sfraves] NRR: Inteligent hip-hop  (Del from Oakland)

There was a debate of weather hip was about violence and stuff like that. 
Well this is concious hip hop... it even used techno theme music in the 
background. Ya'll should pick up this album it's revolutionary to modern 
hop-hip and it pushes the limit as far as it can go with vocabulary at a 
speed and rythm so fast that it's almost creepy... especially coming from the 
slums of the east bay of all places.  check out deltron on Kazaa and tell me 
if you don't think hip hop has evolved drastically. (peep the techno 
influence too it's definately there in the background)

i'm in thinking and writing mode....actually, i am having a horribly nutritional and intellectual deficet (sp? big minus) day....so, i was just thinking though, with the permission of myself, and, well, i could and do think when there are zillions of possibities being thrown my way, but, mostly, i prefer to just be in my own thoughts without all that other stuff and askings and worldly sort of thing going on...if you can't make any decisions and (someone is taking up some of my mental space now...so, i am sharing, and she and also a he too, knows that we are all sharing thoughts about things and other things all at the same time, but i am still writing to you...)okay, back to what i thought was kind of important....if you don't know what you really want, and you feel like you just don't know and won't know now, and maybe not ever, at least you know full well what you don't want, and if you know what you don't want, you can just follow that, and then, you won't feel so lost, and you will actually still know yourself even in these most pressing times for everyone when there is no one to speak with except for me for some reason, and couldn't i be the one to do blah, blah, blah with you and for you even though you probably know deep in your heart that i don't want to have a thing to do with you, but why not just go for it anyway? i know that in some way, i am actually reaching the most important part of you, beyond just your privileged ear, eyes and the pure entertainment factor of my fine literature.  alright, i know what i want at least. :)

Subject: [sfraves] Bored on a night with no party...

... or more accurately, no party with music I'm in the mood for and that's
within my price range...

And I get a bit of amusement from going through the really old rave pictures on
the various websites, and from my own camera, and:

1)  Seeing pics of people I used to see at parties all the time; but they never
show anymore; and I never got their contact info, thinking: "I'll just see 'em
at the next party.".  :-(

2)  Seeing pics of people you know... before you knew them.  And you wonder...
"I was standing two feet away from them, and I didn't say hi???" or, more
annoyingly, "I TOOK all these pictures, with them in the background, for a good
YEAR before I MET them?!?!?"  *smacks self*

3)  Seeing pics of still others... before they were jaded and they still went
to "candy" parties...  Including people that no one would ever guess would BE
at; and whom I had forgotten WERE at...  Happy Kids partys!  ;-P


cya,
john

dissent, became great through experimentation. Our tradition is one of 
protest and revolt, and it is stultifying to celebrate the rebels of the

That's it!!  It is dangerous to those who are sending us into one war 
after another.  If it made people surly and violent they would have less 
of a problem with it.   Compare the government's response to speed.   
They don't devote nearly the effort to supressing speed as they do to E, 
even though it is a bigger problem.   They may put meth in the title of 
the bill, but the actual target is always E.

ANDERSON CONGRESS, THE LUXURY TAX & No. 0056
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tuesday, May 27th
26Mix (mission, between 26th and ceaser chavez)
$3 Donation, 21+

Another installment of u.t.r.'s flagship weirdness. Join us as we warm-up 
for our 2 year anniversary event installment plan. We have some very special 
shows lined-up for you, featuring u.t.r. friends and family.

Here to present another brain-spanking journey into over-drunken week-night 
madness:

LIVE

Anderson Congress:
>From his hide-out deep in the Richmond District in San Francisco, AC 
delivers you some of the most forward thinking electronic music on the west 
coast. With sounds that move between sonic glitch work-outs and mad rhythmic 
ass-shaking beats, AC will work you into a frenzy before you can say 'audio 
mulch'.

The Luxury Tax:
Inventors and virus agents of "gutter bass". LTX has been an active crew, 
releasing no fewer that 3 projects within the last year alone. Their unique 
sound blends cut-up (mashed?) drum and bass, hip-hop, and 'glitch' noise 
with a healthy since of irony and humor. As a project spawned from alcohol 
consumption, drugs and a strong sense of audio geography one would never 
know that these abstract sounds come from a  Corporate Customer Service Rep. 
and a PhD student.

No. 0056:
This Sacramento artist is here to rip you another ear-hole. Mean beats from 
meat streets.


-------------------------------------------------------------
WARMDESK / PIN-UP MOTEL + SPECIAL PEOPLE
-------------------------------------------------------------
Tuesday, May 27th
26Mix (mission, between 26th and ceaser chavez)
$5, 21+

WARMDESK: (LIVE)
warmdesk is the project of chicago-based producer william selman. selman is 
a freelance multimedia designer who is currently studying for a master's 
degree in computer science. the sound of warmdesk combines dense, noisy 
harmonics and dub-like bass with rhythmic patterns and samples from everyday 
life. the desire is to create a multi-faceted "spray" of sound grounded by a 
pulse of beats and concrete sounds--ideally, not too far from minimal techno 
and tech-house. formerly a drummer, selman's strategy is to allow rhythm to 
intuitively develop through repetition instead of the current obsession with 
changing its timbre and structure every measure.

warmdesk has released material on several labels, including bip-hop, static 
caravan and fallt. he is nearing completion on a full-length cd for the 
well-regarded deluxe label (home of electric birds, blechtum from blechdom 
and matmos's early endeavors).

PIN-UP MOTEL: (LIVE)
PIN-UP MOTEL is:
Dan Racanelli (Keyboards)
Jameson Edwards (Guitar, Vox, Keys)
Martin Przybyla (Guitar, Bass, Vox)
Alex Feldman (Drums)

ZYGOTE:(DJ'ing)
Stephen Ruiz (aka Zygote) uses the mechanized process of electronic music 
production and combines the expression of complex human feelings to create 
sound art. The tools of his output are computers, tape recorders, wires and 
other conduits of noise. His sound transcends the inhuman element of 
"technologically enhanced" production methods so vital in the world of 
electronic music producers, and in it's place submits raw and unfiltered 
emotion. While exploring the idea of personal expression through the cold 
exterior of machines, he takes the concepts of compositional indeterminacy, 
generative music and evolving cellular automata and humanizes them. The end 
result is populist music of emotional depth that illicits response via 
technology. Having trained in percussion and guitar, his compositional 
methods are rooted in structured narrative that are constantly being mutated 
under the pressure of new forms of expression.

Stephen has releases on Under the Radar Records and Alectric Records 
(Canada) and is the founding organizer of The "Under the Radar" experimental 
music and video events in San Francisco

-------------------------------------------------------------
TWO YEARS AND RUNNING
-------------------------------------------------------------
Tuesday, June 3rd, 2003
Julip: 839 Geary (between Hyde and Larkin)

u.t.r.// 2 year anniversary event

DAT POLITICS:
Dat politics flash by the way of music but also texts some pixellised and 
pop snapshot focused on failed flirt and gastronomy, After work with 
innovative  and respectable labels as A-musik, Mille Plateaux, Skipp or 
Tigerbeat6, now the laptop-band collaborates with the electro-trash label 
from the Berlin-based trio Chicks On Speed to diffuse their domestic and 
terribly exotic new sonic adventures.

BLEVIN BLECHDOM:
Blevin Blectum - nee Bevin Kelley - one-third of Sagan, ex-d84 and formerly 
50% of Blectum From Blechdom. Currently Blevin plays solo and in Sagan (with 
fellow musician J Lesser and video artist Ryan Junell). Her first solo CD 
was released on Phthalo in 1999. Her second solo CD Talon Slalom was 
released May 2002 on Seattle's Deluxe Records. She makes electronic music 
with samplers and computers mostly.

LESSER:
Starting off with the templates of drum and bass but tweeking them beyond 
recognition, Lesser's music delivers crunchy snares and overdriven bass 
frequencies with a heaping helping of skeptical humor, gritty digital noise, 
and DIY instrument-building ingenuity. Soldering together new instruments 
out of the refuse of 80's mixers and synths, J Lesser avoids the standard 
sounds and strategies in favor of a confrontational, schizophrenic and often 
hilarious rethinking of conventional "intelligent: electronic dance music.

Lance Grabmiller
Born in Kansas City , Missouri in 1975. Studied viola, cello, alto 
saxophone, tenor saxophone and music composition (in that order) before 
putting all formal studies on hold with the discovery of his first four 
track tape recorder at the age of 14. Using various tapes, effects, objects, 
microphones, amplifiers, razor blades and any instruments that could be 
begged or borrowed, he created quite a din in the Midwest, most notably in 
his collaborations with Shannon Fields which included such bands as Alice's 
Offspring, Requiem (which included a revolving cast of dozens) and HSoA 
(with Martin Nieznanski), the last of which culminated in a gigantic 
performance noise nightmare that nearly destroyed the Gizmo in Galesburg, IL 
in 1994.

Co-organizer of the Under the Radar events.


DJ PERFORMANCES:

Wobbly:
Wobbly is a multi-talented artist who excels in music, painting, singing, 
writing, dancing and even woodworking. Once dubbed "Mr. High on Life", his 
colorful high energy is like electricity as it provokes intense emotion in 
his audience.

Wobbly is practical and youthful. He possesses charisma and magnetism. He's 
been a natural artist since early youth, but has restrained himself until 
recently, as his creative drive is pushing him to give to the world what 
lies inside of him. He developed himself as a portrait painter. This year, 
he's gone beyond that as he fulfills his philosophical nature in the avenue 
of music, writing and singing. He wants to live a long life and be creative. 
His fulfillment will not come until he's completed the full cycle of his 
inborn talent. His high creativity in all areas has funneled into music 
where he finds himself at this time, with his artistic ability as a painter 
having a profound effect. It appears as if his painting background shows up 
in his music as he paints pictures with his words. His broad background is 
embraced in his inspired voice.


Zygote:

Del? Is that the super underground track I saw MTV playing? ;)

You'd be surprised what comes out of the East Bay -- many a great things
are brewing there. Anyway... I'm all about intelligent hip hop -- my
current fix hasta be Sage Francis. Check 'im out if you haven't already
heard of him. Good stuff. He does a lotta awesome spoken word stuff, and
great stuff with clean beats as well.

Below is a letter from our system administrators our inboxes here at my
work are flooded with virus emails. Please beware and watch your
computer so you do not get this virus. In 5 hours I have deleted over
150 emails containing the virus and luckily our anti-virus software here
is removing all attachments. Peace

Summary

A new virus, FIZZER, started widespread infections overnight.  This
virus is similar from our perspective to Klez, meaning it doesn't cause
us much harm, but it's leaving a lot of garbage behind to clean up.

 

What's Going On?

Fizzer is a "hybrid" virus, meaning it blends together components of a
wide variety of other viruses in an attempt to infect systems.  It
appears to be particularly aimed at home users, with a focus on chat
rooms and file sharing networks as a component of its attack, as well as
traditional email distribution.  

 

What can I do? 

If you're receiving your email from Columbia, the infected files are
removed when the message is received here at headquarters, though you
will likely receive remnant messages in your inbox.  These messages can
be deleted. 

 

If you're receiving your email from another source (Many Sales offices
or Sourcing offices), make sure you are running the latest versions of
your antivirus software with the latest pattern files.  Similarly, at
home, make sure you're running anti-virus software, and download the
latest pattern files from the manufacturer of the software.

 

What are you doing?

We've already updated all of the file servers and email servers in the
environment with new anti-virus pattern files and are actively scanning
for this new virus.  We will pass along any new information as it
becomes available. 

 

We automatically delete the payload of the virus as it enters the
environment, so it isn't harming us, however we can't block the email
messages without running the risk of impacting good messages getting
through to you.  

 

Thanks!

Brennan O'Brien

Mondays are going to be the Vice City Quote of the Day for a while, either
until I run out of cool ones, or until I just get tired of it ... that's not
likely anytime soon though.  I unfortunately lost my memory card that had
the game 98% beat ... but I bought another card and now I'm working on
beating it for a third time.

Hey, why not?

Subject: [sfraves] Rave date help: Which party?

Hey all,
I got invited on a date, with a caveat:
hardcore trance party

and obviously, I am being treated, my choice of times/events,

so when I check various calendars I find that next weekend is fun-filled with
three events:
5/16/03  Over The Rainbow 2 
5/17/03  Overdrive 
5/17/03  Elektrosorcery

I am not familiar with these crews. Can someone offer some advice, thanks, I
just want to dance. And I've got a date, yippee, It's so special to be treated
this way. (really)

Greg VP

Subject: [sfraves] "Synergy" rave movie released on DVD



"Synergy, Visions of Vibe" has been released on DVD today.  This movie
is a great look at the late-90' socal desert rave scene, and it's global
impact.  Shot on 16mm film, loaded with great music, this is a highly
recommended DVD.  Personally, I think it as the superior, underground
version of "Better living through Circuitry"

Check it out at amazon.com:

I thought i had posted this already, but i didn't see it on the list so i'll post it again...Just wanted to say thanks to everyone involved in the faultline party.  It was a great party, with great music, and great people.  It's been a long time since i've been to a party, but it reminded me of why i started going to parties 12 years ago, and after attempting parties in New Orleans, before I moved out here, I really needed a reminder..  Everyone was really kewl, and the vibe was really good.  And also, THANK YOU HEIDI!  If any of you don't know her, she rules!  Thanks for a great weekend! peacephil

even though i had to leave a little early, i had an awesome time.

faultline was classic, in so many ways...
met a lot of great people, saw old friends, excellent music, vibe was 
going off...

so much fun.

Ottawa's move to decriminalize the use of pot angers the U.S. government

U.S. drug czar John Walters frowns on Canada's plan to decriminalize
marijuana possession.

The move could unleash a flood of pot into the United States, he warns, and
provide funds for terrorists. In retaliation, the Americans might insist on
careful inspection of all Canadians crossing the border, causing long delays
and disrupting business.

"You expect your friends to stop the movement of poison to your
neighbourhood," Walters says.

Canada suggests, in return, that Walters and his boss, President George W.
Bush, chill out.

The pot plan, to be introduced in the House of Commons before the summer
recess, includes a strategy to combat trafficking and smuggling, Justice
Minister Martin Cauchon says. When the Americans see the total package,
they'll like it, he insists.

Paul Cellucci, the U.S. ambassador to Canada, was initially as hostile as
Walters but has toned down his criticism. We'll wait and see, he says now.

Why all the fuss over what amounts to a minor amendment to Canada's Criminal
Code - a change backed by dozens of studies and, polls suggest, enjoying
wide public support, even in the United States.

Why do American officials fear Canada will inflict a major setback on their
war on drugs when we're proposing to do what 12 U.S. states did more than 25
years ago?

Experts say the controversy is as much about perception as facts.

Not surprising, they say, given the history of the marijuana law and the
current anti-drug fervour in Washington.

In 1923, few Canadians had heard about pot, let alone ingested it. But that
year, almost as an afterthought, it was included on the list of prohibited
drugs in an amendment to the Criminal Code.

"Cannabis Indica (Indian Hemp) or Hasheesh" was hastily inserted into one
copy of a previously prepared schedule of illegal drugs. No one explained
why. No one in Parliament bothered to ask.

It was, several observers now say, a solution without a problem.

What pressure there was seemed to originate in the United States, where
opponents of "Mary Jane" were beginning to issue dire warnings.

Famous feminist and reformer Emily Murphy - fresh from her triumph in
persuading the Supreme Court of Canada that women were persons, not merely
the property of their husbands - might have persuaded some officials that
dope was the devil's work.

"Persons using this narcotic ... become raving maniacs and are liable to
kill or indulge in any forms of violence to other persons, using the most
savage forms of cruelty," she wrote in a 1922 book, which described
marijuana as "a new menace."

Murphy was, in fact, approvingly quoting Charles A. Jones, then Los Angeles'
police chief, whose rant was a thinly disguised attack on "Hindoo"
immigrants from India.

Despite their concerns, the Americans didn't make pot illegal until 1937.

No marijuana charges were laid in Canada until 1934. The annual total never
exceeded a handful until the flower-powered mid-1960s. After that, while
use, charges and convictions all soared, the nightmare of murders committed
by dope-addled addicts didn't become reality.

In 1972, a report commissioned by the U.S. government recommended: "Casual
distribution of small amounts of marijuana for no remuneration, or
insignificant remuneration not involving profit no longer be an offence."
Around the same time, in Canada, the Le Dain Royal Commission reached a
similar conclusion.

Neither Ottawa nor Washington acted on their reports. But in 1973, Oregon
decriminalized possession. In the next four years, 11 other states followed.

Then decriminalization fell by the wayside, says Paul Armentano, of the
National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, a Washington pro-pot
lobby group. After 1980, it was snuffed out by Ronald Reagan's war on drugs.
Spurred by the Americans, the United Nations toughened a 1961 convention
that makes it a violation of international law to legalize pot.

Even so, lobby groups and independent researchers around the world continued
to study the issue. All the research showed marijuana use doesn't lead to
hard drugs, and tough penalties aren't a deterrent. The studies invariably
opted for decriminalization.

Australia and most European nations eliminated criminal penalties for
possession, although no country has yet challenged the U.N.'s ban on
legalization.

The issue is being revived in the United States, but the focus is now on
using marijuana to relieve the suffering of people with cancer, AIDS and
other painful diseases. Nine states have gone this route; more are
considering it.

Over the past three decades, Canadian politicians, including Prime Minister
Jean Chretien when he was justice minister in the early 1980s, have talked
about loosening our pot law. With Chretien trying to build a socially
progressive legacy before he retires early next year, it appears Ottawa
might partially reverse what it did eight decades ago.

The current situation is confusing. The possession law is rarely enforced
and, when it is, penalties are wildly inconsistent. Ottawa has approved
medical use of marijuana, but the nearly 300 people in that program have no
clear way to get their supply.

On top of that, the Supreme Court is considering a challenge to the 1923
law. It heard arguments on Wednesday.

Ottawa's message is that marijuana it will continue to be illegal.
Decriminalization means simply that those caught with a small amount -
probably less than 30 grams - will face a modest fine, like a parking
ticket, rather than a court appearance and the possibility of jail and a
criminal record.

Growing, possessing and selling larger quantities will still be a crime. In
fact, the plan - expected to cost about $400 million - will include tougher
measures against traffickers and major producers.

"It's going to lead to a better policy that makes sense for Canadians and
will alleviate the concerns of the Americans," says Mike Murphy, a
spokesperson for Cauchon.

Last fall, a Senate committee recommended legalization, which might allow
pot to be produced, sold and taxed like alcohol. But that step is not in the
cards.

Marijuana "is harmful and it will continue to be treated as an illegal
drug," Murphy says.

Canada is not prepared to challenge the international convention against
legalization, and the public isn't ready for it, officials say.

Ottawa's main aim is to reduce harm, says Richard Garlick of the Canadian
Centre on Substance Abuse, an independent, federally funded research group
in Ottawa.

"Everyone agrees the biggest harm from the existing regime is the
criminalizing of tens of thousands of otherwise innocent people.
Decriminalization succeeds in addressing that; it's as far as you need to
go."

Marijuana has some health effects. Heavy users are prone to respiratory
ailments and, possibly, cancers. It can become addictive.

But, the experts say, those impacts pale in comparison with the damage to
the 600,000 Canadians saddled with a criminal record - which can hurt their
employment prospects and keep them out of the United States - just because
they were caught will a little dope.

In the 12 U.S. states where marijuana possession is decriminalized, use has
actually dropped slightly. The biggest increases have been in states with
the toughest enforcement.

The Americans spend about $17.5 billion (U.S.) a year on policing and
prosecutions, according to the Washington-based Drug Policy Alliance. Police
forces say the expense is far out of proportion to any benefits; the money
and manpower could be put to much better use.

Legal experts say the pot situation brings the law and police into
disrepute. The law is not consistently enforced. While the rate of marijuana
offences has nearly doubled over the past decade - with 70 per cent of those
simple possession charges - less than 1 per cent of Canada's 2 million to 3
million users are caught. Most of them aren't penalized.

More than half the people caught with small quantities of marijuana lose
their stash but get off with a warning. Nearly half of those charged aren't
convicted; many avoid court through community service and education
sessions. Those who go through the courts often get an absolute discharge.

Ottawa's plan, "will lead to more consistent application of the law," Murphy
says. "When it is consistently applied, then people will respect that law."

This "consistent application" might lead to more people being penalized for
possession, says Garlick. If police only have to issue a ticket, they're
more likely to enforce the law, he says. In Australia, the number of
offences tripled after decriminalization.

U.S. officials say relaxing the laws would boost profits for traffickers who
support terrorism. Others argue the opposite.

"It is drug prohibition that generates huge profits for these groups," the
Canadian Foundation on Drug Policy says. "Without prohibition, the drug
trade could not finance terrorism to any significant degree, since profits
from the legal sale of drugs would be a small fraction of what they are
now."

Walters and others warn that Washington would likely express its displeasure
by imposing tough inspections at the border. In particular, analysts say, it
might refuse to exempt Canadians from stringent security measures to be
imposed in 2005.

That worries business groups, including some, like the Fraser Institute,
which support decriminalization.

At a time when disagreements over issues like the Kyoto accord on climate
change and the attack on Iraq have strained relations, they say, we don't
need another dispute, particularly one that could curtail trade.

Canada must be strategic, says Michael Walker, the institute's
executive-director: It might be better to move by stealth, rather than bold
action.

"If we do it in a way that creates a backlash and people start to lose jobs,
there wouldn't be much sympathy for it. We don't have to decriminalize to
achieve the results people want."

"It's another irritant at a bad time," says University of Toronto political
scientist John Kirton. "Even more damaging, in some respects, than the
disagreement over Iraq is the fact it comes in a social-policy issue that's
quite central to the core constituency of President Bush as he moves toward
re-election."

But Daniel Drache, of York University's Robarts Centre for Canadian Studies,
says the threat of retaliation is overblown.

Even if Canada dropped its pot plan, there's no guarantee the U.S. Congress
would approve any exemption from the 2005 security rules, he says.

Drache is convinced, however, the Americans will choose trade over
punishment.

"They're more interested in doing business. If Canadians are committed to
this, it will go through and there will be no repercussions."

\/ Workshops

The daytime conference will begin with a discussion panel featuring Radley
Marx (Electronica-Optica), Jon Schwark (LightRhythm), and Grant Davis &
Michael O'Rourke (Dimension 7). Each will be addressing different areas of
this emerging culture and sharing experiences and expectations for the
coming year. Topics will range from aesthetic and cultural expression to
practical market projects and strategies.

The afternoon workshops will be filled with a fun assortment of software an=
d
hardware demonstrations for VJs, DJs, visual artists, and newcomers to this
growing culture.

For DJs and new music producers, there will be a essential workshop for
sequencing video clips along with your music, using Arkaos VJ together with
Reason (the easy-to-use music production software that is quickly becoming
more popular than DJs). Equipment demos include VJ turntable-tools for
mixing and scratching video just like records.

For veterans, the Cycling =8C74 workshop will demonstrate the extreme high-en=
d
of what can be created and manipulated by digital video artists. Dimension =
7
will also be showing showing a variety of highly-developed equipment by
Edirol and M-Audio used in professional-level production.

Anyone is free to attend and take part.  This will be an excellent
opportunity for hands-on exploration and discovery.



/\ Screenings

Running concurrent with the workshops will be a series of visual screenings=
.
Just like a film festival, the screenings offer exclusive presentations of
short works and full-length visual projects from the visuals community.

The day will kick off with episodes of Electronica-Optica=B9s public access
series: VJTV. The full-length features include Yeast Films=B9 cultural music
sequence =B3Prophesy=B2 and a sneak-peak at the locally produced CG project, =B3I
Am=B2 by Dimension 7. The high point of the afternoon will be Bitz & Bytz, an
amazing assortment of 5-10 minute submissions by visual artists from around
the world including Addictive TV, D-Fuse, eMovie Collective, SquareSquare
and many more.



\/ Audiovisual Performances

The night celebration will feature performances by several outstanding
artists from the Bay Area and the mid-west. Headlining the night will be
VisualAudio, ESP, EQ!, and 47 - audiovisual performing artists that base
their show on the video as much as the music (or more). Other performances
will feature VJs and DJs playing together for exciting in-the-moment mixes
that spawn a powerful experience for the eyes and ears.


/\ Admission & Location Information

This conference is hosted at the Dimension 7 Studio,
located at 150 Folsom Street, in downtown San Francisco.

The workshops and screenings are FREE and run from 2pm to 8pm.

The night celebration goes from 8pm to 4am in the same space.
A donation is requested for attending the night performances.

/\ About

Electronica-Optica was formed by Radley Marx and Emmett Feldman as a means
to be creative visual artists and to help build a strong market
infrastructure for the emerging VJ industry.

Electronica-Optica is partnered with Media Box to produce VJTV, a monthly
one-hour television series that plays across North America and features
guest artists and visual content.

Radley Marx has worked in the west coast rave scene as a DJ and designer
under the alias Elemental and currently heads Electronica-Optica,
co-produces VJTV, and is developing his own live show as VJ Oz.

Emmett Feldman is currently working on original audio and visual material a=
s
Suryummy, as well as working with a variety of audiovisual groups including
ESP and LightRhythms.

Dimension 7 (D7) was formed in 1993 as one of the original visual artist
collectives and grew to become a full service production company. D7's live
production team combines multiple video projections, special effects, live
camera feeds, and laser animation to create what D7 calls "Immersive
Environments."

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR: Inteligent hip-hop  (Del from Oakland)

Which one of Del's video's is on MTV? I've only seen him on MTV with the 
Gorrilaz. I'm curious to see if Del actually does have a video on MTV then i 
want to see it. Because i'm a film student and Music Video is my medium so 
seeing a good Del video would be a good reference for me.
    Also I think it's important to not put Del down or say he's not 
underground if he's on MTV because Del has a really awsome message that 
everyone should hear, and not just a certain elete "Underground" group of 
people. i think the word "underground" should be used to describe the vibe or 
the way music sounds. I don't think it would be all too bad of a thing if 
"Underground" became a style of music that was actually popular like "rock" 
or "jazz"
 because you gotta figure, underground music sends the right message, and 
it's just better for people to be hearing than pop music because it's more 
educational and full of truth. so in the event that what was 
underground...becomes popular, i think, is a good thing not a bad thing.

Subject: [sfraves] trip hop record shop?

Hi y'all

I'm new here... I'm looking to pick up some trip hop vinyl, does anyone know 
a good record store in the Bay where I might be able to find some?  (I don't 
want to have to check out every single record store)

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

Some of you, no doubt, have seen me running around at day parties with a big tube of sunscreen, applying it to exposed areas on pale ravers. Well, yesterday I got burnt, bad. I was just walking my dog, when I got distracted, now I am all red and sore. It sucks. Wear Sunscreen. BTW, I don't know if there is any info on this, but since most antidepressants fuck with your ability to not get sunburned, regular or recent use of mda or mdma probably does too, so for those of you who choose to partake, be extra careful.

"Many persons have a wrong idea of what constitutes true happiness.  It is 
not attained through self-gratification, but through fidelity to a purpose."
-Helen Keller

"I know what the great cure is:  it is to give up, to relinquish, to 
surrender, so that our little hearts may beat in unison with the great 
heart of the world."
-Henry Miller

"Loyalty is the realization that America was born of revolt, flourished in 
dissent, became great through experimentation. Our tradition is one of 
protest and revolt, and it is stultifying to celebrate the rebels of the 
past while we silence the rebels of the present."

THE WAR AT HOME

Sanho Tree, AlterNet
The preconditions contributing to drug addiction have changed little, but
our response to the problem has become overwhelmingly punitive.

House Music 101:  http://livingart.com/raving/articles/housemusic101.htm

"Many persons have a wrong idea of what constitutes true happiness.  It is 
not attained through self-gratification, but through fidelity to a purpose."
-Helen Keller

"I know what the great cure is:  it is to give up, to relinquish, to 
surrender, so that our little hearts may beat in unison with the great 
heart of the world."
-Henry Miller

"Loyalty is the realization that America was born of revolt, flourished in 
dissent, became great through experimentation. Our tradition is one of 
protest and revolt, and it is stultifying to celebrate the rebels of the 
past while we silence the rebels of the present."

Subject: [sfraves] more rolling stone coverage of anti-rave legislation





rolling stone, may 29, 2003

on page 52

(part of "the new clubland" feature, pages 51-57, including stories:

"rock is the new dance! step aside techno: bands take over the clubs" by
jon caramanica

"you can't do that here" five towns where the man is cracking down on
nightclubs, by tricia romano

"the new dj booth" inside the modern dj's control room, by d.p.

"the debauched nineties" writer frank owen describes new york when clubs
were clubs

"swing meets house music" louis jordan in da club!, by d.p.

"yoko ono, dance diva" forget paul mccartney - clubland loves yoko!, by
matt diehl

and more)


< 'you can't do that here'
is this new york city or footloose? meet five cities that try to stop the
dancing

with the recently passed Illicit Drug Anti-Proliferation Act, federal
authorities now have another tool to shut down raves. but wait, there's
more - in the past few years, the following cities have been enforcing
their own anti-party bylaws:

1.  new york:  former mayor rudy giuliani dusted off the prohibition-era
cabaret law in the mid-nineties to clamp down on clubs - it says that a
venue must have a license if more than three people are "moving
rhythmically" to music.

2.  charlotte, north carolina:  promoters are required to apply for a
permit to stay open after 2:30 a.m.  all dance events with teens in
attendance have to close by 11 p.m. on weekdays and midnight on weekends.

3.  chicago:  promoters, property owners and even djs can be fined up to
$10,000 for hosting or performing at an unlicensed, for-profit dance event.

4.  orlando, florida:  all clubs serving booze must close by 3 a.m. and are
not allowed to reopen to host raves.

5.  milwaukee:  a town infamous for fining partygoers for once "aiding and
abetting" unlicensed promoters (charges were later dropped) imposes an 11
p.m. curfew for minors on weekends.

tricia romano >


the title and subtitle of the first story upset me greatly because they
sound so dismissive of something we love and care about, but i am glad that
they are continuing to cover the anti-rave legislation.

if you'd like to write to rolling stone to thank them for bringing the
anti-rave legislation to the attention of its readers, please write to them
at:  letters@rollingstone.com.  fax 212-484-3434

thanks.

respect,
mary :)

i've been meeting a lot of very interesting girls lately from all over the globe. sometimes, i wonder what would make a wonderful sweet lady leave her home where there is clean air and possibly a good family and go somewhere else, and then, i read the news. there are constant bombings going on everywhere. little wars within small communites. children being murdered or put at risk for torture. poverty. i remember almost tossing away a small crust of bread once in front of a russian girl some time ago, and she was very, very upset with me, because her family had been spending a lot of time waiting for hours in line for loaves of bread of any kind, and i should be sure to eat the whole thing. i still toss away my burnt toast though. i really like beautiful girls a lot. especially when they are nice to me and when they are real. we don't live in a perfect world though, as i am sure you have noticed. i am thinking of a couple of girls i know now. i don't know if i'll be able to bring them to some of the places i like to go to, because the disrespect rate is so completely high just about everywhere, and if it is bad for me, i think it might be ten times worse for them. just my personal admiration of them. i suppose beauty is in the eye of the beholder. don't honestly know what these ladies see in me. wishing the world were a different place. :)

1)  Yeah, the fact that I subscribe to SFRaves *IS* a pretty good indication
that I like electronic mucic.  *BRAVO*  You get a cookie.

2)  But the fact that I like electronic music does NOT mean that I give two
shits about your crappy-ass CLUB night.

3)  If I did, I'd probably seek out and subscribe to a list along the lines of
SFClubs.

4)  Regardless of weather anyone likes clubs or not, harvesting email addresses
from peoples' posts to a mailing list, and adding them to your spam list
without their permission is bloody rude, loathesome, and just fucking lame.

5)  No rave promoter has ever been that disrespectful.  The only RAVE crews
that I get email from are the ones whose lists I have explicitly and
intentionally signed up for.

6)  Yes, all this DOES include you ex-rave promoters who have now dropped down
to being club promoters.

7)  See #4

8)  Don't think for an instant that because I'm a raver, I don't report your
spam to Yahoo's filter service and every spam blacklist and mail-abuse service
I know of.

9)  PLUR does not extend to spammers.

10)  See #4

11)  That is all.


cya,
john

And now, here's your triple chocolate, reverse osmosis quote of the day, one
day late, in exchange for one that was one day early.

And it's something *I* ought to follow more often, eh?  Especially during
Mercury Retro.

Subject: [sfraves] Re:  rave project

I did my final powerpoint project on raves a year and half ago.  You should 
have seen the look on the whole class, especially the professor - they were 
riveted!  Basically my approach was to give a break down of the different 
elements of Raves  i.e.  origins, dj's, flyer art, attire, rave culture, 
media coverage, positives & negatives. I tried to cover it all.  For many in 
my class, it was the first time they learnt about the culture behind raves. 
Most of them only knew about raves from the crappy media coverage. Make sure 
you have some really kick ass flyer art, they'll be mesmerized.


Good luck....oh yeah, I aced the final :)

Spammers need to go to hell and die! I get an email every week for some club

hey everyone. if you like hip hop, live grooving hip hop, be sure to catch 40 Watt Hype at the Tongue and Groove this Saturday night, 17 May 2003.  here's a bit of a bio on them, they absolutely rock, and feature a wealth of talent that will blow your mind. also performing are go kart go, the nukes, calahan, blood red rose and lockstar
 
40 Watt Hype offers up a road tested, Organic, All Orignals, 8 piece music group. Several features and write-ups in district, local, statewide and internet press have brought the band to forefront of innovation in the newest hip hop styles. News organizations recognize the skill of the talented band, and the likability of a style that was once limited in its audience appeal. 40 Watt Hype has built a reputation as an impressive, active, working band, and is a favorite among local mainstream (104.1, 101.1) and college (90.7) DJs.

The 8 piece set up avoids the limitations of DJ based hip hop and allows for the band to groove in the moment and prove its musical skills. 40 Watt Hypes tight musicality goes beyond the predictability that Hip Hop has come to be. The horn section evolves sensibly between solos and riffs while Percussionist JD rocks the steady beat on the congas.
Accessibly adding to the true hip hop form and bringing a legitimate sense of musicality, MC/Vocalist Awall fluidly doubles up on percussion and timbales to flawlessly contribute to the massive sound. Twylight MCs from his lyrical volumes with ease and control, and His comfort with the stage proves his music to be a lifestyle, not simply a front for performance.

The bands creative drive reflects in refreshing Leslie-styled chord tones and jazz progressions. 40 Watt Hype have become true innovators of the new hip-hop form with their music, lyrics and stage presence.

Thanks to the help of bands like Ozomatli and 40 Watt Hype, full band-based hip hop has found a larger audience in California where it is given the sensibilities that only a California band can provideAn ironic blend of energy, attitude, laid back style and hype wrapped in jazz based Hip Hop. It is, ultimately, music with a heritage.

40 Watt Hype consistently headlines to sold out venues. With thousands of visits to their website, and an extensive mailing list, buzz on the street is that 40 Watt will bring the Showwhether playing for Blackalicious, The Warped Tour, or Fishbone. 40 Watt Hype is comfortable performing regularly with any style of music: hip hop, latin, ska, rap rock and reggae, finding an audience in each.

Winning over audiences at every stop, a 40 Watt Hype show is not to be missed

hey all
I was having a discussion with a friend last night, and he said he
couldn't stand techno.
I asked him why, and what he'd ever heard that was techno...
He said that he couldn't stand it since it had been popular in the early
90's... 'You know, those songs like [Haddaway's] What Is Love or [La
Bouche's] Be My Lover'.
o.O
Is that really what most people think of as techno?
I said i would find him a history of techno as *I* understood it, since
he knows i like trance and EDM in general.
 
Where *does* that early-90's dance stuff fit in?  I said it was more of
an updated disco than anything else... and that it wasn't related to
Aphex Twin [who he knows, and likes, but he says 'well no, that's
*ambient* techno'... errrr] or electronica as i understood the terms...
I realize I could be wrong, and I know i've seen a history before, but
I'd like something to show/tell him when I next see him, so that he
knows that my idea of techno is quite different from early-90's
pop/club/dance hits.

Well after a long hiatus, things are starting to get back into gear. 

With summer right around the corner, get the season started off right
with a night of broken beats, 2-step garage, breakbeats and guaranteed
crucial basslines. 

Mike B and myself will be controlling the decks, but we need you to
control the dancefloor. Hope to see some of you there!

40 Watt Hype offers up a road tested, Organic, All Orignals, 8 piece music group. Several features and write-ups in district, local, statewide and internet press have brought the band to forefront of innovation in the newest hip hop styles. News organizations recognize the skill of the talented band, and the likability of a style that was once limited in its audience appeal. 40 Watt Hype has built a reputation as an impressive, active, working band, and is a favorite among local mainstream (104.1, 101.1) and college (90.7) DJs.

The 8 piece set up avoids the limitations of DJ based hip hop and allows for the band to groove in the moment and prove its musical skills. 40 Watt Hypes tight musicality goes beyond the predictability that Hip Hop has come to be. The horn section evolves sensibly between solos and riffs while Percussionist JD rocks the steady beat on the congas.
Accessibly adding to the true hip hop form and bringing a legitimate sense of musicality, MC/Vocalist Awall fluidly doubles up on percussion and timbales to flawlessly contribute to the massive sound. Twylight MCs from his lyrical volumes with ease and control, and His comfort with the stage proves his music to be a lifestyle, not simply a front for performance.

The bands creative drive reflects in refreshing Leslie-styled chord tones and jazz progressions. 40 Watt Hype have become true innovators of the new hip-hop form with their music, lyrics and stage presence.

Thanks to the help of bands like Ozomatli and 40 Watt Hype, full band-based hip hop has found a larger audience in California where it is given the sensibilities that only a California band can provideAn ironic blend of energy, attitude, laid back style and hype wrapped in jazz based Hip Hop. It is, ultimately, music with a heritage.

40 Watt Hype consistently headlines to sold out venues. With thousands of visits to their website, and an extensive mailing list, buzz on the street is that 40 Watt will bring the Showwhether playing for Blackalicious, The Warped Tour, or Fishbone. 40 Watt Hype is comfortable performing regularly with any style of music: hip hop, latin, ska, rap rock and reggae, finding an audience in each.

Winning over audiences at every stop, a 40 Watt Hype show is not to be missed

I always considered that stuff like Amber and La Bouche et al pretty
much the new versions of say Debbie Gibson and Madonna.  Pop Dance
really.  Nowadays it'd probably fall on Brittany Spears and company its
just that they made it way more mainstream.  Madonna still somewhat fits
into the category but ever since she pulled in *thinks*  Was it Brian
Eno or William Orbit?  She got a lot more flavor for more underground
dance beats and sounds as opposed to the pop like sounds she used to
have.

hey all
I was having a discussion with a friend last night, and he said he
couldn't stand techno. I asked him why, and what he'd ever heard that
was techno... He said that he couldn't stand it since it had been
popular in the early 90's... 'You know, those songs like [Haddaway's]
What Is Love or [La Bouche's] Be My Lover'. o.O Is that really what most
people think of as techno? I said i would find him a history of techno
as *I* understood it, since he knows i like trance and EDM in general.
 
Where *does* that early-90's dance stuff fit in?  I said it was more of
an updated disco than anything else... and that it wasn't related to
Aphex Twin [who he knows, and likes, but he says 'well no, that's
*ambient* techno'... errrr] or electronica as i understood the terms...
I realize I could be wrong, and I know i've seen a history before, but
I'd like something to show/tell him when I next see him, so that he
knows that my idea of techno is quite different from early-90's
pop/club/dance hits.
 
hrm, whatever happened to the 'history of house music' series here,
anyway?

One source that is still available in paper is the "All Music Guide to 
Electronica" (Backbeat Books, SF, 2001).  Basic, contains biographies and 
reviews of producers, Djs and the like plus style essays and genre maps as 
well as a bibliography.

Many people have asked me to continue the series, and I hope to do begin 
again this summer.  BTW, an excerpt from House Music 101 will be included 
in the Summer edition of Fifth Estate.  I've just proofed and rewritten the 
piece.  FE is doing an issue on music and dance.

Love,

"Many persons have a wrong idea of what constitutes true happiness.  It is 
not attained through self-gratification, but through fidelity to a purpose."
-Helen Keller

heart of the world."
-Henry Miller

"Loyalty is the realization that America was born of revolt, flourished in 
dissent, became great through experimentation. Our tradition is one of 
protest and revolt, and it is stultifying to celebrate the rebels of the

	The thing is that people like popular dance music for a reason.
There is a market and will be always a market for crap music. The reason
is the simplicity if you don't have to think about it then it can be
easier to escape from everyday life. Most good dance music in the
underground even in sillier moments has a side of it that is more
thoughtful or at least more thought went into the creation of it. It
requires more brain power to process real music as compared to crap. It
is the true evolution of the lazy man or woman. If you don't have to
think then why exercise the energy. I know of a lot of producers major
names in the underground scene who have alias that they use when working
with pop stars they may not love the music but the paychecks are nice.
As a producer I have been tempted to try and make more commercial beats
under an alias so I could put a little more food on the table for my son
but I cannot bring myself to it. Well I am babbling now and have
probably stirred up all kinds of fun topics now you all can talk about
it and I will have something to read at work. Peace

I got a free movie pass to "House of Fools" because the promoters thought I would go out and tell all my friends how awesome it was on mailing lists and such... Well IT WAS Awesome and I am telling you to go see it. It was so good it actualy made me like Brian Adams again. It is about this Insane assylum in Russia that gets taken over by rebels in the Chechen war, and it sounds like it would be really sad, but it's really funny too! Guys if you take a girl to see this they will be impressed and think you are really sensitive, while you get to watch this insane hottie run around with guns and bombs and stuff blowing up! Its Great! It also deals with the healing power of music... WITH AN ACCORDION!

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

being well past my prime and loosing all of my estrogen from time to time, i am just grateful for plastic surgery. without things like breast enhancement and face lifts, i would really look like hell today. it is kind of scary, being kind of like a drag queen of sorts, and yet trying to maintain a healthy view of the world. at least i look so real, no one can tell that i won't be bearing children. for reals. adoption is in the cards though! i would hate not to have enough time to create. i would be miserable. also, on another subject, i found some really good cheap wine and some cheap saki, and i have gone through like a bottle of wine per week for a few weeks now. i don't know how much is too much really, and it is not my usual thing. i don't know if i should just have a special one glass per week, or the recommended glass per day. when i was having my blood pressure checked yesterday though, everything, including my pulse, which is usually racing because of nerves and caffine, was normal. i am completely healthy with the exception of  a few aches and pains. of course, i am deteriorating. i am old. :)

 I'd recomend the cdj 800, or the 1000 if you can
spend a little more. 

  The Dennon does have more features, but its alot
more complicated to figure out. Also the pitch control
is less acurate than the Pioneers.  After playing
around on it for about 20 minutes it became very clear
to me that I didn't like it at all, and I prefered the
Pioneers. Pioneer Cdj's  are pretty much the standard
for most clubs too.

  You should go to your local Guitar Center and try
them all out. I'm sure they will let you play around
on them for a while. Thats what I did and I ended up
picking the Pioneer 800 (although I didn't buy it
there). I love it!

 Hope that helps

Kevin James

I like the back room at tweakin (with listening) and ameoba (no

is becoming my favorite all around record store as I learn where to find
stuff).  all of the above are in sf.

> being well past my prime and loosing all of my estrogen from time to time,
i am just grateful for plastic surgery. without things like breast
enhancement and face lifts, i would really look like hell today. it is kind
of scary, being kind of like a drag queen of sorts, and yet trying to
maintain a healthy view of the world. at least i look so real, no one can
tell that i won't be bearing children. for reals. adoption is in the cards
though! i would hate not to have enough time to create. i would be
miserable. also, on another subject, i found some really good cheap wine and
some cheap saki, and i have gone through like a bottle of wine per week for
a few weeks now. i don't know how much is too much really, and it is not my
usual thing. i don't know if i should just have a special one glass per
week, or the recommended glass per day. when i was having my blood pressure
checked yesterday though, everything, including my pulse, which is usually
racing because of nerves and caffine, was normal. i am completely healthy
with the exception of  a few aches and pains. of course, i am deteriorating.
i am old. :)

I appreciate your feeling in this regard. I've had the privelege of meeting some very interesting people as well, with very unique and eye-opening stories.
 
Just remember one thing.... The world is a better place one person at a time!

i've been meeting a lot of very interesting girls lately from all over the globe. sometimes, i wonder what would make a wonderful sweet lady leave her home where there is clean air and possibly a good family and go somewhere else, and then, i read the news. there are constant bombings going on everywhere. little wars within small communites. children being murdered or put at risk for torture. poverty. i remember almost tossing away a small crust of bread once in front of a russian girl some time ago, and she was very, very upset with me, because her family had been spending a lot of time waiting for hours in line for loaves of bread of any kind, and i should be sure to eat the whole thing. i still toss away my burnt toast though. i really like beautiful girls a lot. especially when they are nice to me and when they are real. we don't live in a perfect world though, as i am sure you have noticed. i am thinking of a couple of girls i know now. i don't know if i'll be able to bring them to some of the places i like to go to, because the disrespect rate is so completely high just about everywhere, and if it is bad for me, i think it might be ten times worse for them. just my personal admiration of them. i suppose beauty is in the eye of the beholder. don't honestly know what these ladies see in me. wishing the world were a different place. :)

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Attention Spammers (NRR)

I agree.  Not only are spammners who spam your email address book evil, 
but so are those who spam your guestbook!!!  I had to close down my 
guestbook because all that was on there was spam!!  At one point, 
someone spammed my guestbook to such an extent with one posting about an 
event, that one had to scroll down quite a bit just to get through it!!! 
 Now, I'm quite alright with a little "word up ____, this is ____ 
artist/dj, hit up my site" but not three page-down's worth of detailed 
information about some massive.  the worst thing is i emailed those guys 
to tell them to not spam my guestbook, and in turn they added me to 
their spam email list!!!  
Now, I openly boycott all spam.  If you have a cool event that is 
underground and all about the music and you want me to know about it 
fine, but i'm not going to go to your club event either if you send me 
huge, banner-filled, graphical spam.  I highly encourage others to do 
the same.  It's not hard for me, because for some reason a majority of 
the spam for club nights i get is for events in Vegas, where I have 
never been =P

Toodipip for now =)

screw going tonight! wait for all the fan boys to go home and see it in
peace and quiet. you're less likely to see your local drama geeks dressed up
as their favorite matrix character. if you do go tonight. I recommend
heavily drinking before hand. that way the lines and people won't make you
want to kill and you'll just talk shit outload to everyone. It will be more
entertaining than the movie. =)

if your serious about the lipo thing, you have to know that if you don't also change your diet and exercise program, the pudgy parts will come back almost immediately.  also, i never put anything up my nose that isn't as full of pure oxygen as possible, and i recommend the same for most, except for the dude i saw lighting up a ciggie in his car this morning. he can die of cancer...puff away!!@! oh, re: r. dahl....i actually live in the peach. i love fuzz and bugs. party on...looking for a REAL rave. where's the electroclash, electrosmash, techno pumping, green light, heavy humming jam? i be there. where's my back in the day in the day, huh? i'm doing this to make the appropriate parties squrim. it is actually part of my job as resident prostitute. just kidding, sort of. i don't want to upset your family. snuff will upset your family. so will glue. breath clean air. find god. :)

Subject: Re: [sfraves] a history of techno/electronica in general?

a good book to check out on the history of techno is "Techno Rebels" by Dan Sicko.  Another is "Generation Ecstacy".
A pretty good movie is "Modulations" which has been on video for years and is now on DVD.

One thing to consider is the differences between the
originations of "electronica", "house" and "techno"...
electronica is a marketing term but you could say that it means
any kind of electronic music, and thats been brewing for most of
the last century.

"house" is argueably an outgrowth of disco but its generally
agreed that it came out of the black/gay chicago dance club scene
in the early 80's.  there's a couple versions of the story on
how the name came into being, i.e. started in a club called 
the Warehouse, or another is that rare italian disco tracks were
remixed into extended custom anthems for each club i.e. the "house" track.  A lot of the music your friend was saying he didn't like descends from this kind of 4 on the 4 pop/house music. 

"techno" got started in Detroit in the late 80's when they took house beats and added distinctively electronic sounds to give it a futuristic feel.  those records made by a few black guys in Detroit got really popular with the London party scene which was picking up on the Ecstacy thing via Ibiza and the next thing you know, the rave was born.  later came ambient, hardcore, trance and jungle...
and AphexTwin's label, WARP, was one of the early importers/imitators of the Detroit Techno sound, and is definitely in the vein of "Ambient Techno" (his early stuff that is!)

>>>hey all
I was having a discussion with a friend last night, and he said he
couldn't stand techno.
I asked him why, and what he'd ever heard that was techno...
He said that he couldn't stand it since it had been popular in the early
90's... 'You know, those songs like [Haddaway's] What Is Love or [La
Bouche's] Be My Lover'.
o.O
Is that really what most people think of as techno?
I said i would find him a history of techno as *I* understood it, since
he knows i like trance and EDM in general.

Where *does* that early-90's dance stuff fit in? I said it was more of
an updated disco than anything else... and that it wasn't related to
Aphex Twin [who he knows, and likes, but he says 'well no, that's
*ambient* techno'... errrr] or electronica as i understood the terms...
I realize I could be wrong, and I know i've seen a history before, but
I'd like something to show/tell him when I next see him, so that he
knows that my idea of techno is quite different from early-90's
pop/club/dance hits.

hrm, whatever happened to the 'history of house music' series here,
anyway?

later

A good book if you want to go WAY back would be Last Night A DJ Saved My
Life.  The book is more about the history of the DJ then the history of
house or electronica but its a good read if your interested in the subject.
The Authors are Bill Brewster and Frank Groughton.  Its kinda long (410
pages) but worth it if your REALLY into this sort of thing.

Yo wussup,
            If you plan to start your own production crew, this is for
YOU!! If you wanna make sum easy cash  and your tired of being broke for
parties then just sign up for this and all that goes on is you act as a
companies distributor of their goods (Well you DONT have to sell
anything, you just set up a site that has products on it and they pay you
for it!!)  I bet your thinking this is sum scam thats gonna rip you off,
but it doesnt cost you anything (What do you have to loose)? This FREE
to join program pays you $2000.00 per month, after only 90 days of
joining without you having to sponsor anybody or doing anything. But, for
every nine people you do introduce to the business, you will receive an
extra $2000.00 per month, so 
therefore, If you sponsored  nine people, you would be making $4000.00
per 
month. Hard to believe for most people "BUT" true. It cost nothing to
join so go 
ahead and see what all the fuss over this company is about.
 
                    E-mail me at   trancehed@juno.com

Umm, pyramid.  I saw this on nwraves, i'm sure it's on seraves too.  You probably don't even go to raves, just some pyramid scam person that thought they'd take advantage of really good people by acting like one of them.  I just hope you don't loose to much in the process.

parties then just sign up for this and all that goes on is you act as a
companies distributor of their goods (Well you DONT have to sell
anything, you just set up a site that has products on it and they pay you
for it!!) I bet your thinking this is sum scam thats gonna rip you off,
but it doesnt cost you anything (What do you have to loose)? This FREE
to join program pays you $2000.00 per month, after only 90 days of
joining without you having to sponsor anybody or doing anything. But, for
every nine people you do introduce to the business, you will receive an
extra $2000.00 per month, so 
therefore, If you sponsored nine people, you would be making $4000.00
per 
month. Hard to believe for most people "BUT" true. It cost nothing to
join so go 
ahead and see what all the fuss over this company is about.

I hate Oriely, but someone posted this on cannabisnews.com.  they're doing a survey on wheather or not marijuana should be decriminalized.  I think it would be really really funny if there was an unexpected outcome for such a conservative show, plus it might get some publicity for the cause.  Here's the link...

The question is on the right toward the bottom.  Try to get as many people as you can to vote if you wanna.
 
I wanna send this out to all the raves lists, but i feel all guilty like i'm  spamming or something, so if someone want's to pass it on, please do.

I might just be reading that wrong, but just in case, let me correct
something: WARP is /not/ Richard D. James' label. It was started in the
late 80's by Steve Beckett and Rob Mitchell in Sheffield, England. RDJ's
first release on WARP was as Polygon Window, about 4 years later.

By that time, WARP had already developed a completely unique sound with
artists like Seefeel, the Sabres of Paradise, Nightmares on Wax,
Broadcast, and The Black Dog; distinctly divergent from the Detroit
sound at that time. Before he hooked up with WARP, RDJ had already
released some of his work on R&S (and its sub-labels) alongside the
likes of Derrick May and Juan Atkins. There's some overlap there, but to
call the WARP guys imitators of the Detroit sound just ain't right. ;)

Subject: [sfraves] SRR: Handbills (and flyers) littering SF Streets and Signposts

Do you leave flyers on people's cars? Here's an article about the city's
perspective in cleaning up both the streets, including the flyers that
litter the ground from SF Nightclubs...

=09VIDEO: War on Handbills Fought in SF

Posted: May 8, 2003 at 5:35 p.m.

SAN FRANCISCO (KRON)  --  In the never-ending battle to clean up our
streets, a new war is being declared against those thousands of posters
and handbills pasted everywhere.

They're illegal. Critics say: it's free speech.

They can be seen everywhere. An empty lampost, a telephone pole or wall
just invites them. Hundreds of posters, handbills or advertisements
plastered throughout the streets of San Francisco.

They're stapled, glued, or pasted on.

Sometimes dozens of the same ad in one place. In time, they become
shredded or torn.

And it drives environmental officers crazy.

"They have no permit,=94 says Environmental Officer Jody Monahan. =93And th=
ey
wheat paste or glue to utility boxes, lamp posts, utility posts."

City public works crews spend untold hours cleaning off the illegal
missives, not to mention the costs to restore the damaged paint.

It is a big production to clean off a poster from one garbage can.

Environmental workers say dance clubs are also illegally leaving posters
on cars in The City's South of Market area.

They eventually end up on the ground.

City officials say there are legal ways to put up these announcements and
posters, but there are restrictions like how big they can be, where they
can go. And then there's the annual $20 registration fee.

The code requires a registration number on the lower right hand side of a
poster.

There's a 70-day limit. And besides a $20 fee, there's a $100 to $1000
security deposit for posting up to 500 signs.

The code also says any violations of the rules could result in fines from
$50 to $500.

And public works is now aggressively going after those fines. One of the
city's biggest offenders is the anti-war group International Action
Committee. It says its volunteers are told to be considerate when posting
the signs.

But they also believe it's a free speech issue.

"People will put it on whether DPW likes it or not,=94 says Bill Hackwell o=
f
the IAC. =93I know they find people doing it illegally. They cite them.
That's part of it. We end up in court. Big waste of time. We usually beat
them."

Environmental officers are working with the city attorney now to
strengthen the codes.

And, as for those posters for parties or dances. They'll also go after the
hotels or clubs where the event is being held.

The city says it=92s going after Hyatt for the cost of cleaning up flyers
advertising an event there. Free speech or not, in San Francisco, you're
going to pay to advertise.

Many cities have similar rules about posting notices. Recently the city of
Burlingame was challenged by a citizen who was angry over yellow ribbons
that were illegally tied on lamp posts in support of American troops.

The city simply declared a yellow ribbon week so they would be legal.

The citizen did not pose any further challenges.

haha... 
well, sucks for one there need be a question like that even posed-
cuz there is definitely a few of us here!  that said I suspect I've been doing it the longest- since 99, and have played the shit all over town at clubs and undergrounds, once at this back country event called Bruinslair, and twice so far up at Burningman.  I've opened up over at the Booty Bar when that shit was still going at Compression, and have represented at Incognita a few times too.

Also, for almost a year now I've been busting out a little bit of that at my weekly at the Skylark, which is currently every sunday night.  (We had some birthday party show up there two weeks ago and they were ready to get freaky.  Good thing I brought a few extra booty records that night!)

for examples of my style, check out http://ghettoblasta.net
the site is badly need of an update, but the mix links still work.

Can't forget my bro Jon Schatz AKA The Lord Of the Bling.  He tore it up at the last B-Family underground!  We've been known to throw down some booty tag team sets that are not to be fucked with, so keep a look out for that shit.

anyway, I've been really really keen on getting more folks interested in this music.  Anyone who's curious holla back and I'll put you on a mailing list and etc.  And of course, I'm available for parties just about anytime (for the next two weeks I'll be out of town in, of all places, Detroit!) 

p.s. Andy W, if you are reading this, YO DUDE! hit me back with a mix or something. I'll get you on at the skylark for sure.

PEACE, Rob AKA Baby Daddy

oh snap!  I almost forgot, there's also this other cat Domingo Yu AKA DJ Chino.  He recently moved out here from Detroit, and he is the real thing for sure.  Check him out at http://domingoyu.com/music or come visit the "DETROIT" night we're doing at the Skylark- he'll be hosting/DJing on Sunday the 25th.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] [nrr] matrix tickets

What *I* wanted to do, is go wait in line with a friend for the midnight
showing, even though I didn't have tickets.  Then I was going to have another
friend call me on my cellphone, and pretend to be on the east coast, where, of
course, it would have already been midnight three hours earlier, and everyone
would've already seen it.

Then, I would have had a very loud, obnoxious, yuppy-esque, three-way cellphone
"conversation" between myself, my friend in line, and my friend supposedly on
the east coast....

"Dude Alex, it's Jim in New York calling, he just got out of The Matrix... it's
2:30am there, you know..."

"Yeah... oh my GOD!!!  Guess what???  Jim says that Neo and Trinity are
actually BROTHER AND SISTER!"

"No... you see... Agent Smith *IS* the Oracle!  The whole "resistance" has been
his secret plan all along!"

"But wait... Cypher really DIDN'T die in the first movie...  The agents copied
him and turned him into those dreadlock dudes!!!"

"WOAH!!!  Guess who really *does* DIE at the end?!?!?"

Heh...  It'd be even funnier to have a microphone hidden on me, and ANOTHER
friend taping everyone's reaction with my camcorder, from a discrete distance. 
Of course, oh a movie night like last; Sony probably has it's own SWAT team,
complete with snipers, to take you down if you bring a camcorder anywhere NEAR
the Metreon.


cya,
john

Subject: [sfraves] okay one more! re: [sfraves] Who is the ghetto tech dj of the bay?

okay for real this time I had to plug one more just cuz I mentioned Incognita but I forgot that Sarah Delush aka DJ Saraphim also spins GT (tho I regret haven't heard her spin that stuff, just d'n'b which as many of you probably know she rocks.)

modern masterpiece my butt. I saw the first movie 11
times in the theaters. I won't see the new one ever
again. you couldn't even pay me to watch that crap.

sorry, just my opinion. the american sci fi wu xia
aspect is cool. you could rent it on DVD, skip all the
bits where people talk, enjoy the kung fu scenes and
have great fun. but the original had narrative punch
and mystical fervor. it meant something!

this new one -- BLEAH.

there was one thing I liked about it. they brought
some imagery of raving into the mainstream in a way
that suggested they had a clue. this is fairly
unusual! they presented it as tribal frenzy coupled
with organized resistance. I thought that was cool.

but the story? the pacing? the dialogue? the
characters?

the movie itself was (in my ever so vocal opinion)
lamer than a millipede with a thousand crippled legs.

Subject: [sfraves] cool book on computer music

http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1929685777/qid%3D1053051544/sr%3D11-1/ref%3Dsr%5F11%5F1/103-0322227-1273471

I'm in the bookstore trying to figure out whether or
not it's actually worth buying. I open the book to a
random page and read an explanation of how major third
detuning (ie four semitones) is a common technique in
Detroit techno.

then I'm like ooh baby.

These sorts of things always start up again when the economy is bad. I remember back in the 70's my parents were in amway, the soap was good stuff, but boy were my folks dumb! They called their "Home Based Business" Diamond Express Company, after the rank they wanted to achive in amway; we even painted a diamond at the end of a rainbow in our pool. They even had me selling it. I was 4! Then they endited the head amway distributors because it was a pyramid sceme.What a crock. And It's still around. I would rather collect cans in a shopping cart than get involved with this kind of crap.

I'll testify to that lol.  Had a couple of rather gay money fixated
roommates a while ago and one was absolutely convinced his "it's not a
pyramid scheme" dealeebob was going to retire him in 2 years.  Something
about toilet paper.  More along the lines of "i'm going to show you how to
make money by showing others how to make money, does that sound good to you?
But first i'm going to hypnotize you with me teeth!  Want some TP?"  lol.
Mother fucker still owes me three hundred bucks, too.  What a putz.

OK, I figured everybody knows this by now, but just in case you didn't, when you want to sign a guestbook or a site requires an email addy you obuscate it like this: say you were jon_doe@yahoo.com then you put in jon_doe@NOSPAMyahoo.com real humans can find you, bots cannot. And if you think there are real humans creating mailing lists for spammers, Then send me a dollar, and send a dollar to 5 friends...and you will be rich! ( OK for those of you who don't know: I am kidding about that dollar thing, send me $10!)

I just posted about it on http://www.democraticunderground.com and that
seemed to be getting some interest.  It's 54%-46% in favor so far.

I just posted about it on http://www.democraticunderground.com and that
seemed to be getting some interest.  It's 54%-46% in favor so far.

I've seen it twice, and my brain is SO broken right now.  Some questions
is answered, new questions are asked... and the new questions are doozies.

This is a movie that I think needs to be seen a few times.  The first time
you go you expect a surreal action-fest like the first one.  That's not
what you get, so you're disappointed, but the story and the ideas are
stuck in your head and they keep nagging you.  You see it again, focusing
on the ideas and implications, and you have a SERIOUS mindfuq to deal
with.

If Revolutions doesn't resolve my questions I'll need to check into a
mental ward come November.  =P

Very true, I'm going back again tonight to see it again.  I know theres tons 
of stuff that I missed the first time.  But theres also tons of stuff that I 
did get, and that enough is playing hell with my brain right now.

Huh?

Did we see the same movie?
I saw nothing but a computer-generated actionfest.
I mean-how much more wirefighting and bullet tracers do we need to see?

Yeah-the architect part was interesting-but shit-what "massive mindfuq questions" are still left?
I certainly dont see any-that's what the architect did-he laid it out exactly.

Subject: [sfraves] Being broke and parties..

For the Dood that sent out the Blantent Spam and tried to mask it around 
being broke and doing parties etc.. Trying to sympathize..

here is a tip for you and anyone else for that matter..

IF YOU DONT HAVE ENOUGH OF YOUR OWN $$ TO THROW A PARTY... THEN YOU 
SHOULDN'T BE DOING PARTIES. Simple as that.

I personally don't throw parties anymore because after taking a $4,000 
dollar hit on 2 parties I figured "Fuck I could have spent that $$ on some 
gear and pressed some tracks" and gotten alot further then some faint 
memories of parties that were a pain in the ass and a bunch of headache.

Macadio

Subject: RE: [sfraves] nrr: the matrix

I think we're giving too much away to the people who haven't seen it,
even though we're not really going into details but its enough.
Seriously though, I was craving the 3rd one at the end of the movie.
There are many unanswered questions that were "not by design" ;)  Watch
it again, things from the first one are answered in reagards to a
certain character which aren't touched on in Reloaded until the very end
sequences.  Other characters are still very much alive at the end of
Reloaded that were only shown for a few scenes, etc...  Reloaded made
more questions than answers for me and I'm dying for the third.  Of
course nothing is going to truly beat the mindfuq we were given in the
first... Yet.. Think... :)  I think you were expecting a shocking truth
like the first one and were so busy looking for it you missed a lot of
the subtleties.  Its almost following the format of another trilogy of
movies just a different storyline.

And they showed the exit to my house!  Go Whipple Ave!! :)

Huh?

Did we see the same movie?
I saw nothing but a computer-generated actionfest.
I mean-how much more wirefighting and bullet tracers do we need to see?

Yeah-the architect part was interesting-but shit-what "massive mindfuq
questions" are still left? I certainly dont see any-that's what the
architect did-he laid it out exactly.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Being broke and parties..


Having attended your parties, it wasn't a wholly bad deal. :)

I have this great memory of the sound guys flipping out while I was
playing a Neil Landstruum record at the FL at second and jackson...
they're like "what the fuck is going on with the bass" not even
considering it might have been recorded that way.

At one of your other events, I have a story I will never forget about the
world's horniest e-tard.  Good thing there were enough people keeping a
benevolent eye on her, cause without them, she would have been... erm...
pretty darn "popular".

I also met a very special girl at that party (not the horny etard, I
swear), which was the start of a great relationship (that I'm no longer
in, but nonetheless very appreciative of).  So don't sell the impact of
those nights you delivered to people short... a good party is an amazing
thing.

andyw

p.s. MacAudioooo... $4k and a few months of stress is NOTHING compared to
what a lot of people I know have dumped into making and promoting thier
music & labels.  Just a thought.

Yeah :)  But they were on the 101 in the freeway scene (futuristic than
bay area now of course) and they passed the exit for Whipple ave :)
Which means Neo was in Tahoe in the mansion scene.

that sounds pretty good now, considering that i am thirsty. i like those sweetie ale drinks too...like pear, and peach and oh, yes, the days of wine cooler love'ins. my boy would grab a six back o' brew for hisself, and for me, a 4-pack of wine coolers. i can't remember what brand, but the bottles were green, and it was our friday night ritual. ain't all bad. would probably do it again too. it's like the personal party that a man and a woman can have together. cheap champagne makes for good conversation too. no dogs allowed. :)

Subject: Re: [sfraves] nrr: the matrix

Watching the movie right now...

...a systemic anomoly...
...escalating probability of disaster...
...the function of the one is to now to return to the source allowing a
temporary dissemination of the code you carry reinserting the prime
program...
...the fundemental flaw is ultimately expressed and the anomaly revealed...

Those are the key phrases that I could pull from the scene that had anything
to do with mathmatics.

Hmmm.. My bad.. Maybe Shasta or is oregon that far.. If not it might've
been down in the big bear/mt. whitney area?  I have bad time/distance
perception.  I go by directions and when I'm there I'm there :)  Or it
could've been a completely made up city and had nothing to do with
California at all, just coincidences.  Wasn't the mansion really in
Alameda for filming? ;)

Black Rock City, LLC Uses "Burning Man" Trademark to Stop Commercial
Sales -- While Selling $225 Tickets Itself

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE / May 15th, 2003, 20:00 PST

Contact: Daniel Burton, (510) 504-8708, dan@spaz.org

BERKELEY, CA -- Black Rock City, LLC, the company holding the "Burning
Man" trademark has filed a VeRO request with eBay, resulting in the
removal of two auctions containing the phrase "Burning Man."  Using
the phrase "Burning Man" in connection with selling a commercial
product, it says, upsets participants in the festival, at which all
commercial sales are banned.  However, Black Rock City, LLC is itself
in the business of selling commercial products using the name "Burning
Man" -- expensive tickets to the festival, which currently retail at
$225 -- more than many of the artists who supported the festival in
its early years can afford.

"Burning Man itself has become a commercial product, and an expensive
one at that," says Daniel Burton, the eBay seller.  "It is
hypocritical of people who are selling $225 tickets to an event
supposedly based on a 'gift economy' to try to censor auction listings
that merely suggest the product is good for Burning Man somewhere, but
don't claim to be tickets or official merchandise."

The two listings, under the ID melchizedek_merchandise, were for pairs
of hand-made fairy wings "by Imagination Creations" and had titles
that read "Fairy Wings & Crown-Ren Fair/Goth/Burning Man" and "Red
Fire Fairy Wings-for Burning Man/Rave/etc."  Burton says he had seen
similar listings in the past and was just trying to tell people what
the wings might be good for.  He was surprised when he was contacted
by Jim Graham (ronjon@burningman.com), Burning Man's "Media Mogul,"
citing the trademark, and thought it was strange that there even was a
trademark for "Burning Man," an ostensibly non-commercial event.

Burton, who has had trouble finding work since he graduated from
college with a Computer Science degree in December 2000, says he would
like to go to Burning Man but cannot afford it.  A past Libertarian
Candidate for State Assembly (2000) and a self-described
"socially-conscious anarchist," he is a strong believer in free speech
and staunch opponent of over-reaching intellectual property law.

"The idea that any one group can own, control, and censor the words
'Burning Man,'" he says, "is completely counter to the original
anarchic spirit of Burning Man.  What happened to the concept that
there are no spectators, that everyone is equally involved?  What
happened to the idea that Burning Man is not just another carnival put
on by some production company where passive audiences pay for
entertainment?  If things have reached the point at which some
official organization puts up fences, charges admission, and censors
use of the words 'Burning Man,' things have effectively reached that
point.  Burning Man has sold out -- not to any corporation, but to a
market of wealthy yuppies and spectators itself."

"Burning Man would like to isolate itself from economic inequality --
but in the outside world economic differences have impact.  People
have to make money to subsist, and lofty notions of a 'gift economy'
won't make that money.  Black Rock City, LLC doesn't even offer
discounted tickets to low-income people, something that almost every
non-commercial social service organization does with its services.  I
was just trying to make enough money to pay rent by teaming up with a
struggling artist and selling her works online, and I'm barely
breaking even -- is this wrong?"

In fact, Black Rock City, LLC is not registered as a non-profit, but a
for-profit joint stock company, owned by six individuals.  Despite all
the talk about participatory decision-making, the LLC agreement makes
no mention of it and gives ultimate decision-making authority to a
council of managers.

"In other words, the participatory part can be eliminated at their
discretion," Burton says.  "There is no excuse for doing things this
way.  Other festivals like the Rainbow Gathering, Autonomous Mutant
Festival and so on have all operated as informal, horizontal networks,
without official hierarchies, for years, remained free, operated on
Federal land without permits, and avoided being shut down, all with no
signs of changing -- and mostly because of the determination of the
organizers, which I don't see in Burning Man."

Burton does not believe "Burning Man" is a term that should be
protected as a trademark and is considering a lawsuit to invalidate
it.  He contends that the term "Burning Man" was in common use
referring to more than just a commercial product long before it was
registered as a trademark.

"I've been around long enough to remember when Burning Man actually
was a sort of temporary autonomous zone," Burton says.  "From the very
beginning 'Burning Man' has always referred to the entire gathering
and the efforts of all who participate in it in creating the spectacle
- -- not just a select organization and the tickets they sell."

Besides this, he says, Black Rock City, LLC actually only holds a
service mark, a type of trademark which only protects services
rendered, in this case organizing festivals, and not physical goods.
"I'm not selling the same type of product at all and there's no way
anyone could mistake these wings for Burning Man tickets or official
merchandise," he says.

Burton plans to challenge the VeRO request on eBay, and says he will
use the phrase "Burning Man" in future listings.  If he can't sell his
merchandise on eBay, he says, he will offer it for sale elsewhere just
to prove his point.  If he can't use the web, he says, he will turn to
peer-to-peer file-sharing and e-mail.  He has other plans which he
describes as "a mix of civil disobedience, hacktivism, and other
unspecified actions which you can neither anticipate nor imagine," if
Black Rock City, LLC does not back down.  He has registered the domain
burningmantrademark.org, which is not online at the time of this
release, but his website can be found at
http://www.spaz.org/~dan/burningmantrademark/

Subject: [sfraves]  Being broke and parties.. (Thanks guys!)

Well leave it to Andy to put a positive spin on things..


And the two parties in question that he mentioned are ones that stick out in 
my mind when I think of past events that I have put on cause those 2 parties 
he is talking about actually did pretty well as far as turnout and being 
able put on other events (I.E profit)  As well as some other persons that 
have emailed me privately telling me about parties of mine they have been to 
that stood out in there minds. So I guess I should have stepped back from 
that for a sec and thought how past parties may have impacted friends and 
persons that I don't even know.. For that im pretty humble..

Thanks guys.

Mac

actually, none of the freeways scenes were filmed on actual freeways.

they were filmed on a section of freeway they built specifically for the movie here in Alameda on
the old navy base.

The entire film was shot in Australia and Alameda.

This is true.  They built pporx 1.5 miles of freeway on the old navy base 
runways.  Look at the condition of the road in the movie.   Its much nicer 
than anything we drive on.  Besides, when was the last time you saw a sign 
for 101 West around here??

Just got back from my first viewing -- excellent.  Buddhism and Gnosticism,

"Many persons have a wrong idea of what constitutes true happiness.  It is 
not attained through self-gratification, but through fidelity to a purpose."
-Helen Keller

"I know what the great cure is:  it is to give up, to relinquish, to 
surrender, so that our little hearts may beat in unison with the great 
heart of the world."
-Henry Miller

"Loyalty is the realization that America was born of revolt, flourished in 
dissent, became great through experimentation. Our tradition is one of 
protest and revolt, and it is stultifying to celebrate the rebels of the 
past while we silence the rebels of the present."
-Henry Steele Commager

For once, Geri, I can actually agree with you.

I've been on an old-skool techno and breakbeats kick recently.. and you
never hear that at parties anymore. :(

Maybe someone at Mind Control will 0wn me with some '92 techno anthems.

I will worship them like something very similar yet in no way related to a
god.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] nrr: the matrix


    did everyone fail to notice how the matrix dances around biblicable 
ideologies? Althought it may be a touchy subject for some, i think it's 
pretty obvious to see the connections.
 In the first movie Neo becomes aware that he is "the one" obviously this 
massiah type character. this is followed by a series of miricle-ish feats 
that leaves the audience (and even characters in the movie in disbelief). 
    Natrally we have a character that tries to betray neo (the guy with 
bloody hand) and a guy that believes in him when all others do not 
(morpheous), a true love (magdali... opps i mean trinity) and of course a 
huge following in the city of zion.
    Now it is allured to that the prophecy is a lie... used to control the 
masses into passivity. And we are left with this apacolyptic, doomsday 
feeling at the end of the movie.
     If the story keeps going in this direction... i wouldn't be suprized to 
see Neo somehow "sacrifice" himself, (perhaps inside the mainframe) to cause 
the freeing of the minds of the humans living in the matrix. Or perhaps 
"pieces" of his "energy" will live on within the people of Zion. 
    other things to notice... Smith seems to allure a satan-esk character, 
(he can control and become any common person) while the french guy is more of 
a "fallen angel" type and if you look closely at the painting that is on the 
tile floor durring the fight with the french guy's henchmen you will see a 
famous piece that is entitled "Gnosis" which is a greek word for the secret 
truth. 
    All in all it's easy to critisize the movies attempt to be hollywood and 
be on the cutting edge of new age philisophy at the same time. and you will 
have your people who will say this or that is lame or I don't agree with this 
or that... But damn you just gotta give it up to the Wachowski brothers for 
actually going through with the idea and sticking to it. This movie is by far 
the most bold blend of science, myth, religion and hollywood elements such as 
action, humor and drama that i have yet to see all at once within a two hour 
time frame.

p.s. even the term matrix before used as a computer term was an idea from the 
chinese I-Ching, also the Achient Mayan calender was a matrix.

p.p.s. there are even more suble insinuations in the movie that involve the 
idea of Vampires, Tribal/Rave-like celebrations, French wine lol, and even 
the idea of "God's perfection VS. the Goddess's intuition"

Just saw it last night...all I can say is: Holy
Crack!!! This was a mighty impressive movie, and I
feel the majority of people who enjoyed the first
installment will appreciate this one, too (and be
hungry, as I now am, for the final chapter, which will
be released in my birth month this year. Yay!).
There's plenty of action, beautifully-done special
effects (I have no problem with the use of wires
during the fight scenes...how else can they produce
such effects without going purely digital?), excellent
set design, plot development and interesting twists to
some critical story elements.

When I saw the dance sequence, I instantly thought
"they're raving!" *S* I'd love to see a UG crew put
together an event that emulates that dance sequence
(hint, hint...nudge, nudge...wink, wink), and I'm sure
some of the great crews are already brainstorming on
it *S*

Anyone have the soundtrack yet? Is it even more tasty
than what we here in the movie?

Such a well-done film. I hope everyone will go to see
it with no expectations, and enjoy the feast for what
it is...then it will be entertaining and satisfying
*S*

Peace and pass the popcorn,
Eric

Subject: Re: [sfraves] nrr: the matrix

not just christian myth--i think the Matrix emulates a lot of myth from 
all over the place--especially the epic.  the rave scene, for instance 
(which I thought was awesome, btw)--how many epics have you read that 
describe parties of monumental proportions before battles of monumental 
proportions in or around those walled up citadels?  Plus, Neo's journey 
reminds me of Gilgamesh, and his long journey--meeting with many 
different, and some ancient characters of all types to find the answer 
he is looking for.  Let's hope when he finds it, it doesnt slip from his 
fingers into the sea.

PS on a funnier note, remember the merovingian "cake" scene?  my 
girlfriend completely ruined it for me when we were talking about that 
movie, and she quite hoenstly said "ohhhhh, you thought it was an 
orgasm??  I thought it was diarreah!!!  lol

Okay I went to see it again last night, and not only did it not answer any 
questions i previously had, I have over twice as many.  The scene with the 
architect is crazy. Huge mind fuck.  The problem with the movie is that they 
give you too much info, so in your mind you try and put 2 and 2 together, but 
in that world it doesnt equal 4.  Crazy stuff...

i just wanted to add to this post, because what i have to say at the moment is sort of similar and relevent, and since i go out and meet real people a lot and have real interactions with them, and since i also don't consider every attempt to get my attention to be a beginning or an ending or a possible effect on my life and personal space, since i am not the one who is having the screaming raging issues within myself, i am quite comfortable expressing myself, and listening to my real friends without having to be rude, because, as many already know who have nothing better to do than sit around and spread their bad mood around, it is nice to keep good company with a really nice lady now, isn't it? and when you aren't keeping good company with a nice lady, maybe you won't be feeling so nice anymore, but what does that have to do with me? absolutely nothing. i am sorry if so many in the world are having troubles making friends, but just because someone else hurt your feelings doesn't mean that i am the one who did it to you. just because people have things in common with one another doesn't mean that the person who disrespected you when you were about 6 years old at school, and you never got over it, were mezmorized by it and let it totally shape your personality, like maybe your teacher who taught you to only speak when spoken to, or your parents or guardians who always told you that what you had to say was meaningless so you'd better shut up...just because maybe these things happened to you to make you who you are today doesn't  mean that i or a nice girl you meet out on the town deserves your disrespect. if you disrespect yourself forever, that is your choice, but there are plenty of people who have lives and love to share and who enjoy the company of others, and who also have pain, but who don't feel the need to attempt to inflict it on others. many know already that if you are hungry, you should eat, and that if you don't like your job, you should just go and get another one, for example. there are a  ton of smart sweet girls in the world, and just because you might meet some mean ones, purely by accident, doesn't mean that the nice ones aren't right around the corner. love and slutty dreams to you. ;)

Geri Dahl <eeelips@yahoo.com> wrote:i've been meeting a lot of very interesting girls lately from all over the globe. sometimes, i wonder what would make a wonderful sweet lady leave her home where there is clean air and possibly a good family and go somewhere else, and then, i read the news. there are constant bombings going on everywhere. little wars within small communites. children being murdered or put at risk for torture. poverty. i remember almost tossing away a small crust of bread once in front of a russian girl some time ago, and she was very, very upset with me, because her family had been spending a lot of time waiting for hours in line for loaves of bread of any kind, and i should be sure to eat the whole thing. i still toss away my burnt toast though. i really like beautiful girls a lot. especially when they are nice to me and when they are real. we don't live in a perfect world though, as i am sure you have noticed. i am thinking of a couple of girls i know now. i don't know if i'll be able to bring them to some of the places i like to go to, because the disrespect rate is so completely high just about everywhere, and if it is bad for me, i think it might be ten times worse for them. just my personal admiration of them. i suppose beauty is in the eye of the beholder. don't honestly know what these ladies see in me. wishing the world were a different place. :)

The Matrix seems to me to be, amongst other things, in the ancient 
tradition of the epic  journey of the soul (eg, the Iliad and the Odyssey, 
Spenser's Faerie Queene).  Matrix, however, deals with the "modern" spirit 
and its attempt to integrate technology with humane, non-quantifiable, 
soulful values.  Perhaps this is the creation of contemporary mythologies.

I believe the "religious" underpinnings of the work, however, incorporate 
both Western and other systems and includes a healthy dose of Buddhism.

One thing I find unsettling in these commercial works, tho, is the damn 
product placement.  How much did Cadillac pay to have their vehicles placed 
in the freeway episode?  Will this motivate young questers to drive Caddys?

Love,

"Many persons have a wrong idea of what constitutes true happiness.  It is 
not attained through self-gratification, but through fidelity to a purpose."
-Helen Keller

"I know what the great cure is:  it is to give up, to relinquish, to 
surrender, so that our little hearts may beat in unison with the great 
heart of the world."
-Henry Miller

"Loyalty is the realization that America was born of revolt, flourished in 
dissent, became great through experimentation. Our tradition is one of 
protest and revolt, and it is stultifying to celebrate the rebels of the 
past while we silence the rebels of the present."
-Henry Steele Commager

Subject: Re: [sfraves] nrr: the matrix

Just because this film doesn't "answer" certain questions that it brings up 
doesn't give anyone reason to crytizize it. These are deep philisophical 
questions being brought up that have never been asnwered in all of our 
history, and they are not going to just answer them difinitively within the 
movie. The Writers and directors themselves don't "know" the answers, they 
are just asking all the most intriguiging questions and using them to install 
suspense into peoples minds. It's not a "mind-fuck" and it's not disapointing 
and it's not a downfall of the movie, it's just simply the creators of the 
movie being clever and thought provoking. Just the fact that it makes you 
start thinking about such topics is the whole point of the movie rather than 
answering all your questions for you. 
    I dunno i just think it's odd that this movie has so many good aspects 
and yet the majority of people i talk to only comment about their frustration 
about not understanding it. Just think of it like poetry for christ's sake! 
lol it's a goddamn movie! lets give it credit for what it's worth and wait to 
see how the third one comes out.

Subject: [sfraves] Looking for an MP3 BPM counter...

So, with the release of iTunes 4, you can convert the ID3 tags of your
MP3s/AACs to the latest, which includes a field for the BPM of the track! 
Great, thinks I, for creating playlists to suit my mood, by autogenerating
playlists at the right tempo.

One problem... how to populate that field throughout my 19GB of MP3s/AACs in
the first place?!?!?!?  Does anyone know of an application that will do this?

Searching the usual sites, I already found two; but neither is acceptable.

iTunes-BPM Inspector expects you to tap a key or mouse button to the beat
yourself.  This is lame as hell, and obviously unacceptable for a 19GB
collection.

Ask the DJ TRIES to do it properly, but it is defective as hell.  How do I
know?  Well, there's not a happy hardcore song in existance that's only 80 BPM!

I KNOW that such things are possible.  I've SEEN the mixers that display the
BPM dynamically.  So does ANYONE know of an iTunes plugin, or even a
stand-alone program, that can help me out?

Thanks bunches!


cya,
john

Well, it happens.

Coughing up blood is pretty common among chronic clove and menthol
smokers.

So stop. Unless you're drowning in your own blood.

Then stop and go to the hospital. =D

Do you know anyone that it has happened to, or are you blindly perpetuating 
myth?  I smoked cloves in lieu of regular cigarettes (pack a day) for a 
number of years and not once did I cough up blood.

People's bodies react differently to such things. But if it's happening to 
you, you should defiantly quit. and if it doesn't stop, go to the hospital.

I think you might be misunderstanding my views of the movie.  I absolutely 
love this movie.  But there are so many aspects of it that I still cant 
figure out (one of the things i love about it).  I went and saw it wednesday 
and friday, and the second time, I was able to absorb more, and notice more 
because if wasn't in awe of the eye candy.  There is just so much more that I 
found the second time through, and that stuff is blowing me away.  By the 
way, stay through the credits, they show scenes from Revolutions after.

Cadillac actualy donated the vehicles for free.  At the time of shooting, hey 
had not been relleased and the realse date was supposed to be much closer to 
the release of the CTS.  After shooting and before the cars ended up in the 
compacter, GM officials were rumored to have been going through the trash to 
colllect random parts that had broken off, in order to keep the vehicles 
under wraps.  If you want to talk about product placement, go see X2.  
Cyclops apperently drives a Cobalt Blue RX-8.

Play the game too, you'll learn some more about the movie.  Or if you don't
want to play the game, you can ask me.  :-)  I just beat it (with Niobe at
least).

They designed the game amazingly well to work with the movie.

I think you might be misunderstanding my views of the movie.  I absolutely
love this movie.  But there are so many aspects of it that I still cant
figure out (one of the things i love about it).  I went and saw it wednesday
and friday, and the second time, I was able to absorb more, and notice more
because if wasn't in awe of the eye candy.  There is just so much more that
I
found the second time through, and that stuff is blowing me away.  By the
way, stay through the credits, they show scenes from Revolutions after.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Looking for an MP3 BPM counter...

Supposedly, Traktor DJ Studio 2.0 (traktor-dj.com) includes support for 
swapping or exporting
tractor playlists to itunes. When I get a large collection of new music on
MP3, I typically import the collection into winamp (using the "add->directory" 
menu/button) then export a playlist in either m3u or pls format from winamp.
Then I take that same playlist and import it into traktor (this is a quick
way of getting all your artist/album/song.mp3 files in all sorts of deep
directory structures into traktor -- which otherwise things you should
do things a directory at a time, manually).

In traktor, set the "autoload next track" preference, and make sure the
"stop at end of track" preference is unset. Then load the first song from
your playlist into Deck A, and hit play.... it'll then play through your
list of thousands of MP3's (I let it run all night and all day) and
try to determine the BPM's of songs. Traktor then writes the bpm of each
songs into the playlist, which you can then cut/paste or subdivide into
smaller playlists. I think traktor 2.03 has a
new feature for writing ID3v2 tags in MP3 files.

The only additional step you'd need to take, probably, would be whatever 
feature traktor uses to export to itunes. I'm sure there's a gaggle
of freeware programs one could compile and test and cobble together into
a script. My description is just regarding off-the-shelf windows usage.

Regarding the export to itunes ... since I don't use the mac or itunes, I 
haven't tried it out.

PS: you may have to set the max bpm in traktor's bpm counter preferences
to a higher value if you want it to recognize happy hardcore choons. Most
dumb bpm counters expect songs in the 60-140 range... so lets say you got
a 160BPM HHC choon playing... the BPM counters going to go... "hmmm 160
BPM, that's impossible... i must be triggering twice per measure ... I'll
just display 80 bpm instead"...

Having an electronic BPM counter keep count meens you need to inform
it of stuff like the BPM range, and the number of beats per measure.
Most computer BPM counters handle the range part... but don't adequately
handle, nor recognize, non-western-dance time signatures, e.g. the
rhythmic cycles of 16 (or 7, 11, 9, etc) beats in indian music, or
12 beat rhythm cycles in african musics....

This track has lyrics?

  In deep space,
  Abandoned.
  Any Crew?
  ...
  
  Negative.

That's the only "lyrics" I know of in it, but I haven't heard the "Total
Separation Mix".

shizat.

was extremely pleasurable to see everyone last night...and indeed, everyone 
was there.  from the omnipresent osby to the omniscient migurski and 
everything in between.

there is something special about hanging out near the water cooler listening 
to techno while sharing a 12-pack of old milwaukee that sends shivers down 
my spine.

thank god for the free earplugs as the techno was bangin and the 
jungle...well, if you were there you know.

and thank god for the free facemask.  now i don't have to worry about SARS.

tasty stuff.

Does anyone know how to get there from where I am?
I live in Concord.
I know the park is in Fremont, but I don't know where in Fremont.

I will welcome any clue that might help me out.

09-11pm EST - Inflictz - Inflictz is another local junglist who's been =

manipulation goes, and uses said skills to build dark, techy mixes =
spiced with a lil bit of that wikka-wikka.
11-whenever EST - Mystery Slot - Higgs will be back up in the studio =
tonight, so we might get some Dirtbox Kru taggin' goin on.  Whatever =

Actually what you're hearing in that mix is Running Down the Way Up by BT
(hybrid's mix) overlayed on top of Stage One - Space Maneuvers. Same chord
progression and my god is that a sweet mix. Go search on the BT lyrics and
you'll have your answer. =)

I saw the tracklisting of hybrid's set again and it does indeed list BT's
track and space manoeuvre's.

futurefest: behind the music
i recently noticed an advertisement for futurefest2003, below is some emails 
exchanged between james mondrogan & myself, brian frost, in regards to a 
bounced check for $500 he issued to me for my services at future fest 1 
(2000). not only did my check bounce, but every other artist from black 
locust, including others.  Im posting this because I think its necessary 
to let the public know what kind of people are running that outfit. I know 
some people are scheduled to play for them in the near future, and want you 
to be fully aware of who you are getting involved with. I know Im not the 
only one to be screwed over by these people, just be fully aware, and even 
boycott their events if you feel its justified. Sorry to stir up the drama, 
but shit like this hurts the scene more than it helps. It NEEDS TO BE KNOWN.

dear futurefest promotional extravaganza,

you probably dont remember me, since owing $$ to people and never paying 
them are quite common for your organization. but would it be too much to ask 
to be compensated for the $500 bounced check i received for my performance @ 
the first futurefest? remeber jimmy... i kept your dnb room in check when 
everyone showed up late, no mixer was in the room, and the sound went out? 
your 'stage manager', not to mention playing. and the fact that i had to 
drive some 2+ hours to get to that mudhole... on top of helping you 
promote???! thanks to you, i had to close my account because i had spent 
your check before it had cleared assuming (lord knows that was a mistake) 
that you kept your promises. so yeah, not only did i not get paid... but i 
ended up having to pay to play for you.

nice business ethics.
please respond if you have any .oz of dignity.

james david,

if i want money from someone? if i want? i've tried to contact trenz and 
jimmy over 30 times in the past 2 years w/ phone calls, emails, then having 
his phone shut off on me, having to track down his new one. sorry for 
inconveniencing you by 'asking' for what is rightfully mine 'a week before 
your party', how inconciterate of me. i'm beyond giving a shit about whether 
or not your feelings are hurt by insults. i can't believe you can sleep at 
night with all the people you've screwed (believe me, i've heard some pretty 
jacked up things). if there's any confusion, that was just an INSULT. oh, & 
hurting for money has nothing to do with you owing me what you do. I have a 
job and go to school full time, i do just fine. i can't believe you're 
trying to call me 'brite' by trying to collect, you have some nerve.

just pay me what you owe me.

Brianfrost


Frost,
email me a copy of the contract signed(scan it) and we will go ahead and pay 
it but not untell after the party(a week or two).As far as owing other 
people I'm pretty sure you think you know but you don't.We don't owe moneyto 
anyone.Some people that say we owe them Ither didn't do what they said fully 
or they were investers for a party.(not loans).I understand that what we do 
is very important to you, don't worry about us We all sleep great at 
night,well sometimes I guess I am up tapping a little ass.Well sleep well

and I hope you do good in school.Its very important

trenz,

#1 i dont have a scanner.
#2 that contract is far gone (lost)

if you can't pay me on good faith, knowing damn well you owe me the $500.. 
then
that's just fucked. email you a copy of the contract? you've got to be 
kidding me. just pay me.

fyi, Jon aka Rif (naughty vibez) is here sitting next to me reading this and 
would like to be compensated for the numerous parties in which he played 
foryou, but has never been paid.

please pay us what you owe us.
we're not going to send and lawyers or hit squads to collect.
just pay us!

brian frost
jon adamson


Hey Frost,

(fyi) First off I don't owe jon(riff) money at all,plus he hasn't played for 
me numorous times.Also all of the great posts you write on web sites don't 
help your cause,AT ALL.Obviously the money doesn't matter or you would have 
kept the contract.I think that you have gotten what you deserve after all 
the mouthing you have done.You have not tried to call jimmy nor have you 
talked to him in person since 3 years ago.No Contract NO money.Move on.

Thanks
p.s. You may have gotten the answer you were
looking for if you didn't insult me or the company the first time.If I do
owe riff he can email me himself.I think that riff has always been pretty
good to me.At least to my face which is better than nothing

Subject: [sfraves] (nrr) Quote of the Day (Mon)

I've got an early morning tomorrow and I'm not 100% sure when I'll be back on my email.  

You know the craziest thing I've ever seen when it comes to Vice City is people playing the game without 
a memory card.  I mean are they completely clueless?  Well, I guess I was clueless too.  

Anyway, here's another quote from Jan Brown on VCPR.  I don't know about you, but I think her, Thor, 
and Toni from Flash FM are the funniest personalities.  Did you know they hired a bunch of unemployed 
actors to play the parts?  

--

"Did you know that women in India protest by setting themselves on fire?  Hell, the next time my kids get 
out of line, I may just douse myself in kerosene ... and that's just the kind of person I am, opinionated and 
moronic."

Yeah. So there.

I smoked cloves for a long time myself. I think I coughed up blood *once*.

Other people smoke a couple and their lungs come spraying out their nose.

Not literally, but.

Yes, indeed, vast props to the Trust krewe for this one. The sound was,
indeed, impressive. I've never sat down on a chair and experienced my
teeth rattling in my skull from bass before.

Saw some old friends, a lot of smiling faces, and heard vast quantities of
immensely badass techno -- which I haven't heard in a while.

That location gives me immense nostalgia for the first parties I went to.

Hmmm-I dunno-I'm kinda mixed-

The main room sound was "impressive"-but through placement or EQ or Xover 
or whatever; it just sounded muddy to me the entire time-
I woulda stacked all those subs in the corner-sure it woulda made some dead 
spots but o man those sweet spots would ave been sweet.
And live-AndyW getting shifted to 6am was no good-he was a big part of why 
I was there.

Ah well-I liked every other aspect of it= and GODDAMN those scanners were 
all about the action!
I must own a couple of those!

it sure is fun to watch it all go around and come together and come to be, isn't it. even in the smallest act, there a big act of time travel to be found...moving forward and jumping back, but always coming together right on time! :) :) yeahhhhhhhhhh! i love getting my way. i ALWAYS get my way. it is my reward. :)

Ditto about Mindcontrol. That bass had DNA altering qualities. It was great

couple of years! Props to Trust! What a great way to start off my summer 
party season!!! See ya'll on the dance floors!

hey, i just threw a new mix together a few days ago, correction factor, it's 
posted for download on my website:
http://vehicle.me.berkeley.edu/~apot/mixes.html
i also spent some time learning soundforge and split the set into tracks so 
you can download the entire mix or the individual tracks. my first hard 
trance/nrg mix, been getting into it over the past several months and building 
up my vinyl collection. the sound quality's much better than in my last mix 
too, the insomnia sessions (trance, goa), which is also posted for dl on the 
same page.
track listing on the page next to the cover, a blend of my fav trance/nrg 
classics and new releases i'm just learning about.
i put alot of work, energy and love into this set and wanna share it with 
everybody. def dl, give a listen, lemme know what you think... =) promoters, 
friends, strangers, say wazzup. hit me up for a hard copy too if you need 
one...
anyway, enjoy... =)

Subject: [sfraves] Post mortem on a year in the bay. [with mindcontrol props]


Hey,

I'm about to leave the Bay having been here for a year, and thought I'd give a little wrap up on my year here, and how good it was in general.

Coming from Australia, with a pretty minimal rave scene, or at least nowadays, I wasn't really sure what to expect. After about a month, I finally thought it would be a good idea to subscribe to the sfraves mailing, list and this was certainly a well played move. From there I could subscribe to a lot of crew lists and music lists, and get a real feel for the bay area rave scene.

I can't remember the first event I went to, but I think the first sfrave related thing was incognita. Was a lot of fun, and cheap drinks too. Didn't really notice any sfraves players at the time.

Might as well just cut to the big memories.

First big event with the sfraves crew, and introduction to three people was the Snow Party on the 21st Feb up past Sacto. Truly phenomenal - jungle, in the jungle, as I was saying, although it wasn't much of a jungle, more of a woods. The three who travelled up in my car, Delia, Sean and Osby, were all greatly amused at the pride I had in my Oldsmobile Cutlass Cierra, now known as Oldsmatron for it's ability to take a beating and still keep going. Had a little incident sliding off the icey road into a tree that kept the punters alert [read: scared], and certainly was the most eventful trip to the site ever. Arrived a bit late, was totally banging. Being the clever Australian that I am, I hadn't brought any shoes with me, only sandals, and this being a snow party, there was indeed very chilly snow on the ground. After deciding that wearing sandals all night would result in losing my toes, I got my thermal underwear out of my bag and wrapped it around my feet. This was working fine until I stepped in a pool of mud out the back, and now had wet icey feet. So then I ran to the fire, heated up my feet, then rewrapped them in clothes and tied plastic bags around my feet. I think I must of looked a little crazy wearing huge plastic bags on my feet and running around in my australian tracksuit. The tunes were amazing, and the outdoors scenery was fantastic. I will always remember dancing to jungle, and being able to look up through the trees at DJ EMP with snow hanging off the branches of the trees just behind him. Fantastic.

Great props to: Delia, Sean, and the pro-driver Osby who put in a lot of hard yards behind the wheel
Unprops to: The guy from Sac who thought he was a mad drug user and who thought he was solely responsible for us getting there because of the sfraves post - "I'm still seeing tracers";
the guy who was telling me that I was a dick and I was going to have to go to hospital for my feet 'when the drugs wear off'. I'm not an idiot mate, and I'm capable of checking if my feet are going blue or not.

After this there are a buncha good times, mostly going to jungle events such as jolly green jungle - I liked the DJs in suits and the plants, and Faultline 3. Really loved faultline 3 - the inperspective crew tore it up, and they were really friendly to me and my friends as we had common foreigner vibe. Loved the crazy mashup style. Also went to Donut - liked the free donuts - and a bunch of stuff at the tenderloft.

But the next big props have to go to Mindcontrol. That was a truly cracking event. I had no idea what a wall of sound was meant to be, but now I know. I liked the space odyssey 2001 feel of the speakers blocking the DJ, and really appreciated all the extra effort of the ppl running around in lab coats and quarantines etc. At first thought it was a bit silly, but later realised was really quite a lot of fun. Met a good bunch of the trust crew and had some good chats, but I think for me the real beauty was the jungle room. Total darkness was no exaggeration, couldn't see a thing, but could feel the bass ripping through me. No idea who was playing due to the wall, but loved the crazy mashed up hardcore beats, never really heard any jungle played like that in my whole time here, and absolutely loved it. My super favourite was the track, not sure who played it [would be glad for someone to enlighten me], with the vocals going 'madness.... madness', truly beautiful as was losing my mind a bit at that point. Also huge props to the techno room - not much of a techno fan, but was a good insight into the original days of raving - a warehouse, lots of crazy good dancing with glowsticks and poi, everyone totally pumped, and a few really drugged out punters along the walls. Was really full too considering the size of the space. Not enough techno gets played in australia I think, especially in Sydney/Canberra, so was good for me to hear some pretty funky stuff. Big props to the last techno DJ, kept it going till 7am, and dropped some stuff at the end that I really like, to me it seemed more kind of disco style, and all I could think about was Beverly Hills Cop - good times.

Reading the list before going, was wondering why everyone was saying 'I know it's a bit pricey, but these guys put on a great show every time, and the speakers alone are worth it'. Too true, I would lend full force of my words behind any trust event - if they put something on, go to it.

--

I've had a really great year here in general. There is no way I could go to any events of the magnitude or quality of the parties I have been to here. There has always been a good vibe and crew at every event. Throughout the year on this list, I have seen people posting about how 'rave is dead', a sentiment shared by old schoolers in australia too. I think this is nonsense. To all those people I say this: remember that at any event you go to, now matter how massive or commercial or lame, that if one person discovers the magic of raves as a result, then it is worth it. I discovered the magic of raves in my year here, and I'm sure that many more people are discovering this every year. Not every youngster is a candy kid, and not every candy kid is a youngster. You are very lucky in the bay, you have people throwing events with very talented musicians every weekend, and you are at the heart of the rave movement. You are in driving distance to sacramento and reno, which regularly have cool outdoors events. People in the bay appreciate good music, and they are presented with it everywhere they look.

Thanks a lot for all the good times, and keep in touch. I'm sure I'll be back as soon as I can manage it.

Matt.

PS - almost forgot, Osby, Im intrigued to hear that I am a 'uber neo candy skater punk'. Not sure if this is applied to me, but found it funny anyway.

>BACKGROUND
>
>In 1998, the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) created
>the National Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign (Media Campaign). The
>Media Campaign was intended to reduce drug use among young people
>through the use of multi-media advertising and public communications
>strategies that included television, radio, and prints ads. Over the
>past six years, Congress has appropriated more than $1 billion to the
>Media Campaign, making ONDCP - and its primary private partner, the
>Partnership for a Drug Free America - one of the nation's largest
>advertisers.
>
>>From the start the media campaign has been embroiled in controversy.
>In addition to the numerous government studies finding the ads
>ineffective in reducing drug use, the Drug Czar's office has used this

>media campaign to bribe television networks to change their scripts
>and magazines to editorialize on certain subjects.  They were accused
>of violating federal law by manipulating measurement criteria to make
>the media campaign look effective, and faced Congressional heat over
>its decision to maintain contracts with Ogilvy & Mather - an
>advertising agency that has over-billed taxpayers for its work on the
>media campaign.  In addition, the recently canceled "drugs and terror"

>ads were roundly criticized from all quarters, including the
>Partnership for a Drug Free America, which called them off-strategy,
>and the Weekly Standard, which called the ads "propaganda worthy of
>the...Soviet Union."  The most recent anti-drug ads featuring teenage
>pregnancy and an accidental handgun shooting have been accused of
>promoting pro-life views and gun control.
>
>Congress took the first step last week in renewing the National Youth
>Anti-Drug Media Campaign, when the House Subcommittee on Criminal
>Justice, Drug Policy, and Human Resources, approved HR 2086, the
>"Office of National Drug Control Policy Reauthorization Act of 2003",
>a bill that renews the drug czar's office and the National Youth Anti-
>Drug Media Campaign. Chairman Rep. Mark Souder (R-IN) and Ranking Member
>
>Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-MD) both supported renewing the controversial
>ad campaign, despite the fact that the government's own studies have
>found them to be failures.
>
>Buried within Section 10 of HR 2086 are provisions amending the
>statutory ban on using the media campaign for "partisan political
>purposes" to allow the drug czar to use taxpayer money for partisan
>political purposes as long as the purpose is opposing drug
>legalization, including making marijuana legally available to AIDS and

>cancer patients. If enacted, the Office of National Drug Control
>Policy (which is ran out of the White House) could spend up to $195
>million of taxpayer money every year on radio, print, and television
>ads opposing medical marijuana laws and trying to defeat candidates
>that support more compassionate drug laws. It would also give whoever
>is President the power to use taxpayer money for political attacks on
>his or her opponents.
>
>The Drug Policy Alliance is urging Members of Congress to cancel the
>expensive ad campaign and spend the money on drug treatment, after-school
>
>programs and other prevention programs that cost less and are proven to

>work.  At a minimum, say experts at the Alliance, the propaganda
>provision should be taken out and the media campaign should be approved

>for only one year instead of five, consistent with recommendations of the
>
>Office of Management and Budget (OMB) that 2005 funding be contingent upon
>
>improved results.
>
>Government auditors and the President's budget submission for 2004 note

>that "The National Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign has not demonstrated
the
>
>results sought, and does not yet have adequate performance measures and

>related goals."  In addition, every study by the National Institute on
Drug
>
>Abuse (NIDA) has found the ads to be ineffective in reducing youth drug
use
>
>and could actually make youth more likely to use marijuana in the future.
>
>Even Drug Czar John Walters has admitted the media campaign is a flop,

>telling the Wall Street Journal "this campaign isn't reducing drug use."
>
>NIDA's most recent studies have found that the ad campaign not only fails
>
>to reduce drug use, but may actually make youth more likely to use
>marijuana in the future. According to NIDA, the ads may give youth the

>perception that drug use is common among their peers; and may also trigger
>
>what psychologists call "reactance" - the more someone is told what not
to
>
>do, the more they want to do it.  Other experts believe the ads are so

>ridiculous and over-the-top that young people dismiss them outright,
>assuming they're being lied to. NIDA's final evaluation of the program's
>
>effectiveness will be released later this year, presumably after Congress
>
>decides whether to renew the Campaign.

yah.

isn't it weird that a few teenagers in Detroit can
create a whole world making records, while legions of
grown-ups are still struggling after years and years?

in Urb they had an interview with the three original
techno dons, and they described the early days -- most
of it went like this:

Derrick May: and then I stole my mom's car.
Juan Atkins: and then you stole my mom's car.
Derrick May: right, we drove my mom's car into Detroit
and it broke down. so we told her it was stolen and
then I stole Juan's mom's car.
Kevin Saunderson: and then you stole my brother's car.
Derrick May: right.
Kevin Saunderson: you told me you had a license.
Derrick May: yeah. I was 14, but I had this fake ID
that kinda looked like a license.

somewhere in this tale of serial car theft is the
secret wisdom which will enable you too to succeed in
the music business. what did Derrick May do? he stole
cars from friends and family.

so, obviously, I need a ticket to the next Friends and
Family. (and if anybody knows where I can get a good
lockpick, that would help too.)

Yes, I was going to post a BSP later in the week.  Come-Unity will 
celebrate its twelfth anniversary party this Friday at the Mezzanine.  I 
don't know what the plans are beyond this, but the party should be a 
welcome reunion for those of us who have been dancing with Malachy and his 
crew all these years -- and a great opportunity for folks who have never 
been to experience the family vibe.  Come-Unity was, and is, SFs oldest 
house party.

Much love,

Apollo

With Patriot Act, companies forced to play informant on customers

Section upon section of the law imposes new obligations on businesses to 
produce the personal records of their customers, or to spy and snitch on 
their customers as a condition of operating. Million-dollar fines and 
criminal liability are punishment for noncompliance.

By ROBYN E. BLUMNER

05/18/03: (St. Petersburg Times) We all know homeland security is an 
expensive proposition. Assault-weaponed forces standing guard in front of 
all the bridge and tunnel entrances in New York City don't come cheap. And 
the cost for airport inspectors from the Transportation Security 
Administration to fill barrels full of confiscated cuticle scissors at the 
nation's airports runs upwards of $5.8-billion annually.

But what you may not have realized is just how much of the expense of our 
antiterrorism efforts is being borne by private industry. The USA Patriot 
Act, well known as a law that sacrificed civil liberties in the name of 
national security, may also be one of the largest unfunded mandates on 
private business since Social Security.

Section upon section of the law imposes new obligations on businesses to 
produce the personal records of their customers, or to spy and snitch on 
their customers as a condition of operating. Million-dollar fines and 
criminal liability are punishment for noncompliance.

For example, under Section 215, one of the more notorious parts of the 
Patriot Act - the one librarians have been raising a ruckus over - the FBI 
has the power to obtain library records, e-mail logs and entire business 
databases of all sorts just by claiming that the information is relevant to 
a counterterrorism or counterespionage investigation. Before the law, to 
obtain business records law enforcement would have to demonstrate to the 
secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act court that the records related 
to an individual who had connections to terrorism or a foreign government. 
But the Patriot Act strikes down these particularity constraints, promoting 
instead a fishing expedition. And since it makes no provision for 
reimbursing businesses ordered to produce the records, there is little cost 
to the FBI for demanding far more information than is necessary.

According to the December 2002 issue of CSO - chief security officer - 
magazine, 45 percent of the 797 businesses surveyed have given law 
enforcement or the government data on their customers, employees or 
business partners. Internet service providers, financial institutions and 
telephone companies especially are repeated targets. BellSouth, for 
example, received 32,370 subpoenas and 636 court orders for information on 
customers last year and has an entire team of people who do nothing but 
respond to law enforcement.

Tim Lynch, director of the Cato Institute's Project on Criminal Justice, 
who is concerned about this burden on business, recently wrote in Forbes 
magazine about a wireless carrier that received a subpoena in 2001 that 
listed 50 pages of telephone numbers. The carrier had five days to come up 
with customer records for every number listed.

And this is not the worst of it. There is another part of the Patriot Act 
that markedly expands the kinds of companies expected to spy on their 
customers. Banks have had to do this for decades, but the new law extends 
this responsibility to a vast array of businesses - anywhere there is a 
potential for money laundering - such as insurance companies, brokerage 
firms and even casinos, pawn brokers and jewelers. These businesses are now 
expected to know their customers' identity and financial habits, and report 
suspicious activities to the government.

The rules are so difficult to implement that a cottage industry of 
compliance products has come on the market. Mike Ernst, product line 
director for Sybase Inc., a California-based software company that offers 
Patriot Act compliance software, explains that his product will help 
companies thoroughly scrutinize every transaction with every customer in 
every part of the companies' business. "A bank may have an insurance or 
credit card division and is required to review a customer's activities 
across all these institutions," Ernst says. "You have to do a 360-degree 
customer review to make sure you're in compliance with the act."

He estimates Sybase's potential market for this software and technical 
guidance is 10,000 financial institutions - about 10 percent of all 
depository institutions. Multiply that by the $200,000 it costs on average 
to implement the Sybase system and you have a $2-billion market. And this 
is just a sliver of the number of businesses now obliged to act as spooks.

All this might be good news for Ernst and Sybase but it is not so happy 
news for private industry stuck with the bill, nor, of course, for the 
privacy of customers. Suddenly, nearly every business we interact with is 
acting as an extension of the FBI. And businesses that don't comply are hit 
hard.

Western Union and its parent company recently paid a combined $11-million 
to settle charges stemming out of its failure to have a system in place to 
report whether customers were wiring more than $10,000 in one day from 
different locations.

One would have thought the business-friendly Bush administration would have 
been a little more sensitive to the expensive burdens it was creating under 
the Patriot Act. But no. When it comes to eradicating Americans' privacy no 
price is too high.

"Loyalty is the realization that America was born of revolt, flourished in 
dissent, became great through experimentation. Our tradition is one of 
protest and revolt, and it is stultifying to celebrate the rebels of the 
past while we silence the rebels of the present."

I don't do drugs very often..and I am pretty much stone cold sober at parties, but I like my Binkies... My parents didnt belive in binkies...they were like "why should you give a kid a pacifier when they have a thumb?" My punk friend in high school, way back before we were ravers (her and me, I mean) used a binky to quit smoking, So I have been using one to quit biting my nails. I also like to pretend I am rolling so people will give me backrubs and lightshows, I save 20 bucks and a hangover that way.

MINDCONTROL was the bizniss!!!!!!  Completely mental
sound and thoroughly executed concept... it was
obvious that a lot of planning went into this one! 
Kudos to Ed and the rest of the Trust crew for showing
us how it's done.

i think that about sums it up. i have to live up to my fullest potential, and, thankfully, i have been. on the naughty scale, i am up 10000000.04 percent from just 10 years ago. that's pretty good, and really, i owe it to all of my favorite playmates. remember, we could all be porn stars, but really, we could all be astronauts too. they didn't make a doctor barbie, a basketball barbie and a flying in space barbie for nothing, so just get out there, and keep on representing and cross-dressing. amen. :)

Subject: [sfraves] Funkybaby's Art work for sale

After 10 years of promoting parties I feel that it is time to pass on the torch to the younger generations. I have already sold the Funkybaby sound system to Triable souls. And now I want to give the community a chance to purchase a part of the Funkybaby legacy. 
I am selling two of our very large black light banners.
They have been taking very good care of with no holes in them and the black light paint is not chipping. Both are on heavy canvas and are very large. 6ft by 12ft. with a 1/2" steel pipe at the top to support it.
Time, paint and canvas is well worth the $300pr I am asking for each of them, or best offer. But what you are really buying is the magic and vibe that is in each one of these pieces of art work.
Please e-mail me if you would like to purchase one or both of these  black light banners.
I can send you JPG's of the banners for your viewing.
Thank you one and all for being such a big part of my life.

Subject: [sfraves] Loving homes NRR

One closet candy kid seeks loving home.

If it turns out I'm staying here in the bay (which looks like it may be
the case) I'm gonna need to find someplace to live near SFSU. Closer the
better: I'd like to be able to walk to class. :b

I'm still considering student housing and whatnot, but living with ravers
might be a little more suited to my uh active lifestyle.

As such, I'm looking for a room to let come september. 420 friendly people
are a plus. Someplace where I can chip in on high-speed net access is also
a plus. Cheap is always exceedingly good, as I will be poor and living on
other people's money. People that don't mind noise kick ass.

It'd be nice to have parking.

About me: Obviously, I party a lot. I'm fairly social, but like to be able
to seal myself away in a room and retreat to inner spaces every now and
then. I'm as messy as a pig in shit when it comes to my own room, but I'm
pretty respectful when it comes to common areas and roommates. I am not
involved in any satanic ritual abuse cults, but am open to joining one.

If anyone has any ideas, lemme know. :)

~TRH

Richmond Civic was a legendary venue for massives circa mid-'90's.

It's like a big version of Santa Cruz Civic, or a very-small version of
Henry J. Kaiser, kinda sorta. Dual-level civic center, balcony seating, a
very wide hallway that runs the perimiter (good enough for a 2nd area,
social space), a few small side rooms. Fits 4-5000 comfortably, good lord
if they try to put much more in there.

Gatherings, FTT's Le theater de futur, Area 51's....great memories =)

...not sure how the venue will be now with the scene's "tainted" status.
As I remember the venue was lost after an Area 51 due to a combination of
tagging, OD's, and residential complaints....I think.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] atlantis @ richmond civic center? comments?

awww memories of a Dope venue... I recall a come-unity party there I think 
the first in a series of beneifit parties (at least the first real big one 
that is) And the old FTT's shit if it is there.. Im almost tempted to check 
it even though im not very impressed with the Atantis lineup but just for 
nostalgia.

But then again the scene isn't the same as it was back then so maybe it 
won't have that same impact?

Who knows but props on digging up an old space if it works.

Back when I lived near Detroit, I had a really crappy car, I called it the "ratmobile" It was great because nobody wanted to steal it when I parked it near the clubs downtown!
 
My Folks house in Howell is still for sale after they split up a few years ago... It has 4 Bedrooms, a finished basement, a pool , and a Jacuzzi, the mortgage is $1000 a month, ($20 more than I pay in rent now for a one bedroom in Fremont) My husband And I are tempted to move there and start a DJ/ artist commune because of it's proximity to motown, it would accomidate another couple and 2 singles easy...so if you want in on our pipe dream and dream of Detroit, email me privately.
 
isn't it weird that a few teenagers in Detroit can
create a whole world making records, while legions of
grown-ups are still struggling after years and years?

in Urb they had an interview with the three original
techno dons, and they described the early days -- most
of it went like this:

Derrick May: and then I stole my mom's car.
Juan Atkins: and then you stole my mom's car.
Derrick May: right, we drove my mom's car into Detroit
and it broke down. so we told her it was stolen and
then I stole Juan's mom's car.
Kevin Saunderson: and then you stole my brother's car.
Derrick May: right.
Kevin Saunderson: you told me you had a license.
Derrick May: yeah. I was 14, but I had this fake ID
that kinda looked like a license.

Subject: [sfraves] Blatant Begging: Anyone Have an Extra CHEAP Popsicle Ticket?

Laziness and frugality are not advantageous qualities when trying to
attend Skills massives.  Tickets for Popsicle 5 are now $42, and despite
my ardent desire to see and hear Art of Trance, Agnelli & Nelson, and the
Thrillseekers, I've waited to long to buy, and I'd rather not hemorrhage
that much cash.

If you have an extra ticket for up to $30 or $35 (yeah I know it's only a
$7 to $12 difference, but for some reason paying less than $40 makes me
feel like I'm upholding some nebulous principle) I'll gladly unload it
from you.

Please e-mail me at carter@kartre.net if you have one, or if you don't and
would like to flame me not only for attending this giant foo-foo fest but
for abusing these mailing lists to facilitate the commission of said
crime.

Yes, I'm practicing my Architect-speak.  =P

Thanks all.

Subject: RE: [sfraves] Lungs bleeding of smoking


Why wait for your lungs to bleed to stop? Best thing to do for your health
is to quit. I recently lost someone close to me from cancer, trust me, you
don't want to be stuck in a hospital w/ a trache in your throat..."

From=20Yale, one of the leading medical schools:
http://www.yale.edu/uhs/departments/health_ed/fooled.htm

Clove Cigarettes
=09They contain twice as much tar and two to three times as much
nicotine as all-tobacco cigarettes.
=09The anesthetic character of cloves leaves clove smokers
susceptible to many serious respiratory problems including infections,
pneumonia, difficulty breathing, and bleeding from the lungs.
=09These symptoms, unlike those associated with nicotine intake, can
occur after one incident of clove smoking.


From=20http://www.colostate.edu/Depts/HHS/APresDrugsTobacco.htm#a2

"...Are Clove cigarettes worse for you than regular cigarettes?

Clove cigarettes can be deadlier than cigarettes. This "natural" tobacco
does not have anything to do with being healthier. Often times the clove
cigarettes contain higher concentrations of tar and nicotine and the smoke
has greater levels of toxic agents such as carbon monoxide, hydrogen
cyanide, ammonia and carcinogenic hydrocarbons. Smokers of clove
cigarettes also have increased risk of emphysema, heart disease and cancer
of the mouth, lungs and throat. The anesthetic character of clove leaves
the smokers susceptible to many serious respiratory problems including
infections, pneumonia, difficulty breathing and bleeding of the lungs.
These symptoms, unlike those associated with nicotine intake, can occur
after one incident of clove smoking. One more thing to remember is that
most clove cigarettes don=92t have a filter so you get the "full effect" of
those chemicals! Bottom Line: There is no SAFE cigarette!"

"...The active ingredient in cloves is a chemical called eugenol, which is
a potent topical anesthetic. There have been a few cases of inflammation
of the lungs with clove cigarettes, and any inhalation of substances will
have an impact on lung airways=97which can cause irritation, spasm, and
coughing. It can definitely be more dangerous if a person has asthma."

Good luck and whatever you decide, here's to better health and happiness,

Cosmic Beats is throwing a party on Sunday (remember you have Monday off)

used which is how I found out. That would be my recommendation for the

if i could impart any sort of meaningful advice to anyone, i would have to tell you, just make sure that you don't miss the best parts. now, we all know what the best parts are, there's just a ton of 'em, so don't skip what might be really fun and exciting. if you do, you'll be so very sorry for the rest of your life. san francisco really is one big television show that runs exactly the way you dream it to be at all times. everyone is completely predictable, and you are in charge. mmmhmmm. :)

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

Just wondering if anyone has ever read the Hyperion series by Dan Simmons. All this discussion about the Matrix made me think of my favorite book series. It has many of the same themes as the Matrix such as the Machines using their human creators as organic computers for their own projects such as constructing a Machine "Ultimate Intelligence" or God and the conflict between the Human God and the Machine God. There are many religious tones to this series and like "The Matrix" doesn't really answer all the questions for you but leaves you exploring new questions instead. I highly reccomend it!

It's got something to do with the speed of the beats. It's hypnotic, 
tribal, and primal. That particular speed has worked for thousands of 
years, which is why you can spin in Arab music, Bhangra music, Aboriginal 
music... You can take all these different cultures and find the same beat, 
between 125-130 bpm. It's there in ecstatic, trance music, where people 
shake and spin until they reach a state of hyperventilation and psychedelic 
alpha-wave experience. In a sense (house) is regressive music. You're going 
back to the roots of why music was invented: to reach ecstatic and 
visionary states, in a communal tribal celebration.

Simon Reynolds, "Where 'now' lasts longer,"
in Blissed Out (London: Serpent's Tail, 1990)


COME-UNITY:  Twelfth Anniversary Party

WHEN: THIS FRIDAY, MAY 23RD

Mark Farina (OM Records)

MALACHY ON HOUSE

"When used with positive intention, Group energy has the potential to help 
restore the plan of Love on Earth...When you open your heart, and trust the 
whole group you dance with; when you feel love with everyone, and they 
return it, a higher vibration can be reached. This happens when a crowd is 
deep into the vibe of House...In the true sense of rhythmic movement, the 
effect is to align the physical, mental and emotional bodies with the 
Oneness of All that Is...Don't put out negative energy and feelings. Leave 
the old ways behind. Throw yourself into the winds of transformation and 
sow the seeds for a new world -- one where the human family is together 
again. When people respect each and care for each other as a 
community-organism...Spread the Peace!"

Come share another evening of unity through music and dance
with San Francisco's oldest house family.


Love,

Apollo

Subject: RE: [sfraves] Lungs bleeding of smoking

I know I know.  If only it were that easy.  I've tried to quit 6 times
now but keep coming back.  I think for me to pretty  much quit I'd have
to be away from society, news, alcohol etc for at least a year to fully
quit and want to stay quit.  My grandma died of lung cancer and I
couldn't even quit then although that was my longest attempt.  People
say (especially ex smokers who've quit cold turkey) that its so easy to
quit, just do it.  Well, unless your able to devote your mind fully to
it without other distractors getting in the way then its almost
impossble.  I suffer from chronic pain and migraines and most of the
time I'm completely out of it because my body shuts most of itself down
to deal with the pain.  Its almost cost me my jobs a few times much less
being able to concentrate enough to say 'No, I don't want another
cigarette.'  I wish there was a gene therapy treatment somewhat like
Clockwork Orange that took the choice away from me whether I want to
smoke or not.

Why wait for your lungs to bleed to stop? Best thing to do for your
health is to quit. I recently lost someone close to me from cancer,
trust me, you don't want to be stuck in a hospital w/ a trache in your
throat..."

>From Yale, one of the leading medical schools:
http://www.yale.edu/uhs/departments/health_ed/fooled.htm

Clove Cigarettes
	They contain twice as much tar and two to three times as much
nicotine as all-tobacco cigarettes.
	The anesthetic character of cloves leaves clove smokers
susceptible to many serious respiratory problems including infections,
pneumonia, difficulty breathing, and bleeding from the lungs.
	These symptoms, unlike those associated with nicotine intake,
can occur after one incident of clove smoking.


>From http://www.colostate.edu/Depts/HHS/APresDrugsTobacco.htm#a2

"...Are Clove cigarettes worse for you than regular cigarettes?

Clove cigarettes can be deadlier than cigarettes. This "natural" tobacco
does not have anything to do with being healthier. Often times the clove
cigarettes contain higher concentrations of tar and nicotine and the
smoke has greater levels of toxic agents such as carbon monoxide,
hydrogen cyanide, ammonia and carcinogenic hydrocarbons. Smokers of
clove cigarettes also have increased risk of emphysema, heart disease
and cancer of the mouth, lungs and throat. The anesthetic character of
clove leaves the smokers susceptible to many serious respiratory
problems including infections, pneumonia, difficulty breathing and
bleeding of the lungs. These symptoms, unlike those associated with
nicotine intake, can occur after one incident of clove smoking. One more
thing to remember is that most clove cigarettes don't have a filter so
you get the "full effect" of those chemicals! Bottom Line: There is no
SAFE cigarette!"

"...The active ingredient in cloves is a chemical called eugenol, which
is a potent topical anesthetic. There have been a few cases of
inflammation of the lungs with clove cigarettes, and any inhalation of
substances will have an impact on lung airways-which can cause
irritation, spasm, and coughing. It can definitely be more dangerous if
a person has asthma."

Good luck and whatever you decide, here's to better health and
happiness,

Karina

DANCEmusic Presents
Show Our Strength: Freedom To Dance 2
To Showcase the Unity of the Electronic Music Scene
May 31st at the Westwood Federal Building,
Concurrent Events Scheduled For NYC, DC and Seattle


Los Angeles, CA - Recently formed electronic music activist group the Dance
And Nightlife Coalition of Electronic Music, a.k.a. DANCEmusic, presents
Show Our Strength: Freedom To Dance 2 at the Westwood Federal Building,
11000 Wilshire Blvd. on Saturday May 31st from 1pm - 8pm. This free event
will feature LA's top DJs, speeches by members of the electronic dance
music community and other progressive groups, and tabling from a variety of
activist organizations. A consortium of artists, promoters, organizations,
vendors and other members of the electronic music community are sponsoring
the event.


Show Our Strength: Freedom To Dance 2 is a rally to showcase the unity and
power of the Electronic Music Community to our political leaders in
Washington and locally. We will take this time to share with the larger
community the concerns of our scene in this pivotal moment in US history.
We will demonstrate that we are organized, dedicated, active, Americans who
will not stand for the trampling of the civil rights of our vibrant and
creative community, under laws like the RAVE Act or similar future
incursions. Groups in New York City, Washington DC and Seattle are also
participating by holding their own events in this showcase of the strength
and positivity of the electronic music community.


The following DJs are confirmed for the event: Richard "Humpty" Vission
(Powertools - 105.9 FM), Deepsky (Kinetic Records/LA), DJ Motiv8 (Black
Eyed Peas), Liza Richardson (KCRW), Steve Loria (ICU Media), and Machete
(Respect/Junglist Platoon).


Organizations who are actively using electronic music as a platform for
social and political change will be tabling. DanceSafe (www.dancesafe.org),
EMDEF - the Electronic Music Defense and Education Fund (www.emdef.org),
NextAid (www.nextaid.org), the American Civil Liberties Union,
(www.aclu.org), Dance For Peace, Rock The Vote (www.rockthevote.org) and
others will be distributing info, signing people up for their mailing
lists, registering voters and more.


Additionally there will be a variety of speakers including Francis
DellaVecchia (DANCEmusic, former LA Mayoral candidate), promoters from
B3Cande, Rock The Vote's Executive Director Jehmu Greene, representatives
from DanceSafe and more to be confirmed.


The Los Angeles group who organized the successful Freedom To Dance event
last September, attended by over 600 people and all the local news media,
formed DANCEmusic in the wake of the RAVE Act. In coalition with groups in
New York City (Blakkat, the ACLU Drug Policy Litigation Project) Washington
DC (Ravers Against The Rave Act, BuzzLife, the Drug Policy Alliance),
Seattle (Northwest Late Night Coalition), and San Francisco (San Francisco
Late Nigh Coalition) the RAVE Act was defeated. Over 40,000 petitions were
sent to Senators and even more calls, emails and faxes were received on
Capitol Hill.


Unfortunately in recent weeks the RAVE Act's sponsor Senator Joe Biden
(D-DE) was able to sneak provisions of the RAVE Act into the popular AMBER
Alert Bill. Senator Biden, has angrily deplored the fact that his bill
faced "fierce resistance." Senator Leahy, one of two original co-sponsors
of the RAVE Act admits that the electronic music scene helped turn the tide
against the bill and told reporters the RAVE Act faced "serious grass-roots
opposition."


DANCEmusic is devoted to introducing and reinforcing the positive aspects
of electronic music culture to the community at large. We strive foremost
to protect our civil liberties in the wake of misdirected government
attack. We will work through the legislative process, litigation, and
direct action to promote the best elements of the electronic music
experience, including freedom to assemble and freedom of expression. We aim
to educate and mobilize a community united through electronic dance music,
and to broaden and deepen the political awareness of a new generation, so
that they may grow into a true voice in American politics. We will rally in
defense of our culture!


We look forward to a beautiful day of music and action on the lawn of the
Federal Building on Saturday May 31st.

you don't need to smoke after a good lay. a lot of people do that. they have sex, fabulous sex, and then they immediately light up a cigarette afterwards. in my humble opinion, if you are feeling aggitated enough to light up after the big bang, maybe you actually have enough energy for another go.  don't lie. be real. someone like me always wants another go. someone like me can't stand just laying there quietly, wide awake, going..."oh, hmmmmmmmmmmmmm, i wonder if it is okay to move now. why can't we have another go?"...just do it! :)

I quit last September - I've had drags off a clove about once a month 
recently, but nothing other than that.  cold turkey, by will power.

it's all good - cloves are tempting because that topical anesthetic and 
good taste.. but every time I take nicotine into my body I feel like crap 
the next day.

the cosmic beats party should be good!

in addition, spundae is having their annual memorial day party on sunday 
night.  lots of house music there (mark farina, jonathan ojeda, spesh, joey 
mazzola, etc).

and there are a bunch of popsikle afterparties/alternate-parties going on as 
well.  (brainfreeze 2 and hypergroove)

and then of course there's come-unity on friday.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] atlantis @ richmond civic center? comments?

That was the first Come/Unity malachy benefit party, which was epic, IMHO.
I guess that was about a decade ago now.

Although whatever was moving in the damn portapottie hole sure was scary back
then. I was so young, I prolly still believed in monsters!

I still have the Tapes somewhere. My girlfriend at the time drew one of the
tape covers that was sold with the benefit tape set, and I remember drawing 
little sketches of what turntables, soundsystem speakers, etc looked like for
her, cuz I'm a geek. :-) Heh... and then there's that one tape of Jeno, I
think it's on this collection where he was spinning, I swear, breakbeat. :-)

The more things change, the more they stay the same. (Yeah I could do it in
french, but then i'd be a snotty effete wanker, noh?)

PS: Do I dare eat a peach?

Subject: [sfraves] New to the scene

Hi there Ravers,
                        i am an old relic, age 38 who is new to the scene.
 i have never been to a rave before and have bought a ticket to popsicle 5
(the ads looked so cool) this saturday night.  i guess im asking did i
pick a good show to be my first rave? and, How can a person going alone to
a rave have fun?

I love techno i probably was one of the first people to buy kraftwerks
first album back in the late 70's early 80's.  I dig the beats of today's
techno, trance, and i guess house(don't know what that is).  i'm really
not into rap and such but like artists like Paul van dyk, and David Ralph.

I guess i need reassurance that i am going to a good rave when i step foot
in Popsicle 5, and will there be rooms where i can chill and hear some
awesome beats and gaze at foxy chicks?

peace


Mack

 In this third installment that concerns itself with death, Neo, Trinity,
and Morpheus--along with the rest of their battling posse--continue to come
against the machines that have systematically enslaved the human race in the
Matrix. Now displaying a greater confidence in his own power, Neo fully
realizes that he is a superhuman figure capable of amazing feats, and is
totally aware that he's able to see the codes of people and things with
which he comes into contact. Simultaneously more humans, who are struggling
to live in the real world, have awoken out of the Matrix. As their numbers
increase, the machines invade Zion, the center of human
resistance--considered the last real-world city.

Check out "Weak Become Heroes" by this English MC
named The Streets.  Catweasel told me he's been around
for a year or so, but I just heard about him recently.

"Weak Become Heroes" is a poignant, slightly sad tale
from the UK rave scene. 

peace,

How does one go about gaining info on starting up a business like Blake's on 
telegraph?  Has this RAVE act bullshit put a damper on this situation?  I'm 
not trying to do this anytime soon, but I find it very interesting.  I am 
sure a ton of you have played with the idea of having a lil venue where you 
can have a drink and dinner and listen to some cool, non-mainstream music.

How hard could it be??

thanks all

Subject: Re: [sfraves]Promoters and Biz minded peopleNRR

Harder than you think...

Given that I helped with Ascension @ Blakes for a while I got to hear about
all the problems. Ascension while it was still a Wed night event was able to
go until 3 or 4 in the morning. That was until some drunk guy jumped a
bouncer and the cops came. Now the Berkeley PD was keeping an eye on things.
They didn't like seeing a bunch of 18yo's in candy hanging out front all
night. To them that fashion equated to drugs. More pressure placed on the
event. I came in at this point and worked to change the format and target
and older, non-candy market. That was a direct request of the owner who was
getting hassled by the police. Everything went great with the new format and
we repeatedly sold out thrusday nights at Blakes. Hell we went over capacity
several times. At this point things were still 18+ which was great, but in
itself caused problems. The night was popular and there was a lot of
underage drinking going on. That's a threat to a liquor license which is
something as a bar/club owner you don't want messed with. Then there is this
thing with insurance. To insure an 18+ venue *with* a bar costs you tens of
thousands of dollars more a year. Liability is a bitch. Blake's discovered
that they didn't have the insurance to be 18+ and had to switch back to 21+
like they had been prior to a few years ago. That move in conjunction with
some other internal problems led to the demise of Ascension. Blake's
realized that this really hurt business and has since taken the steps to get
the insurance needed to be 18+ again.

Liquor license, food permits, music permits and so on are all required. It's
not easy and it can get damn painful depending on where you're located. Some
areas won't issue any new liquor licenses either. The only way to get one is
to take over an existing establishment that is already permitted. It's a
crazy business and a lot of work...

(oh and no, Ascension isn't coming back to my knowledge even with Blakes
being 18+)

Interesting.  I give blake's nothin but props.  They provided me a place to 
go when I was 18...one of the few places to go(aside from killasubz and 78 
minna).  I am just wondering, I know there are a lot of people who have 
pride for the east bay(me included), and I am sure they want to make it 
poppn just as much as SF is.

So aside from the 18+ issues.  What kind of money would you need to buy out 
a situated 21+ restaurant or lounge with a liquior license?

mike skinner kicks ass. mike skinner = the streets.
put on a great show at bimbo's this year. i've been in
love with him for over a year now, thanks to living in
london last year. he rocks. he started doing things in
his basement and was isolated from the london garage
scene by living in birmingham. awesome stuff.  worth
every penny, his lyrics are outstanding and very
poetic.  positive, yet realistic, and not cheesy.  one
of the best is "the irony of it all" peace--miss g

If you are desparate enough to try Clockwork Orange style gene therapy, you have a lot more options than "just quitting". Like any addiction, a few people can "just Quit" but *most* people can't, If you really want to quit, Hypnosis works, but it takes some effort and you have to be dedicated enough to keep going and go back when you relapse. You also might want to talk to a doctor about using an antidepressant like wellbutrin in combination with behavioral therapy, since ciggarete addiction is a chemical dependancy a lot of smokers need to regulate their saratonin artificaly for a while, so they stop associating the saratonin with the nicotine.  Behavioral therapy works a lot like hypnosis does, you have to keep doing it. It may sound expensive, but it's your body, and ciggarettes aren't cheap. I have also heard that Quitting smoking takes 7 to 10 attempts to be successfull for most people. If you want to change anything about yourself you have to have a concrete plan and falesafes, and plan on failing a few times, like me trying to lower my damn cholesterol...I MISS REAL CHEESE! so I keep my house full of berries, as a reward for not eating junk food. 
 
 
 
 
"I know I know.  If only it were that easy.  I've tried to quit 6 times
now but keep coming back.  I think for me to pretty  much quit I'd have
to be away from society, news, alcohol etc for at least a year to fully
quit and want to stay quit.  My grandma died of lung cancer and I
couldn't even quit then although that was my longest attempt.  People
say (especially ex smokers who've quit cold turkey) that its so easy to
quit, just do it.  Well, unless your able to devote your mind fully to
it without other distractors getting in the way then its almost
impossble.  I suffer from chronic pain and migraines and most of the
time I'm completely out of it because my body shuts most of itself down
to deal with the pain.  Its almost cost me my jobs a few times much 
less
being able to concentrate enough to say 'No, I don't want another
cigarette.'  I wish there was a gene therapy treatment somewhat like
Clockwork Orange that took the choice away from me whether I want to
smoke or not."

FYI...his name is Mike Skinner of the Streets....some call him Mike Streets. These kats are hot right now and are appearing at Every major festival around the World. 
 
They just played at Coachella 03' and will be performing at the Field Day Festival in NYC June 6 & 7. (www.fielddayfestival.com)
 
 The Streets just recently Played for COOLWORLD @ the 5th Annual ULTRA Music Festival in Miami during the Winter Music Conference.
 
 Needless to say they tore the roof off the place and then some. Coolworld is going to be bringing them out west soon as well.
 
 For more info on "The Streets" check out there home page

--=====================_1049885==_.ALT
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"; format=flowed

In yet another heavy-handed attempt by the government to squash opposing 
points of view, legislation before the House of Representatives would allow 
the nation's drug czar to use taxpayer dollars to oppose political 
candidates or ballot initiatives that support the legalization of medical 
marijuana.


Medical marijuana has significant medical benefits and is supported by the 
majority of the public.  We need to stop the federal assault on medical 
marijuana initiatives!

dissent, became great through experimentation. Our tradition is one of 
protest and revolt, and it is stultifying to celebrate the rebels of the 
past while we silence the rebels of the present."
-Henry Steele Commager

LINKING DRUGS TO EVENTS IS UNFAIR, SAYS RAVE COMMUNITY

Members of Calgary's rave community say they feel attacked and pigeonholed
by police and media reports about drug use at raves.

A nine-month sting operation targeted at the city's rave scene was
recently touted by police for a number of drug arrests and netting drugs
like ecstasy and ketamine.  Repeated phone calls to police requesting
comment on the operation were not returned.

Members of Calgary's rave community say linking drug use to raves is
unfair, especially because many feel a true rave scene has been stifled in
Calgary under the controversial extended dance bylaw -- much-anticipated
changes to the bylaw are still being developed.

Lucie Vlach, a member of a dance community organization who is working
with city hall on changes to the bylaw, says she was surprised by the news
of the drug busts because the bylaw has resulted in very few raves taking
place in Calgary.

She adds that the bylaw's requirement that promoters pay for off-duty
police officers to patrol raves is among the more contentious aspects of
the bylaw because that expense is too much for many promoters.  Such
expenses mean most promoters can only stage small, unlicensed events.

Vlach says the dance community has been pushing for changes to those
requirements, and she questions police motivations for targeting raves.

"I'm speculating, but maybe we're seeing all this in the media for police
to justify their presence at events," she says.  "I think some of this is
to show that ( police ) presence is needed."

Craig Booone, another member of Calgary's dance community, says he is
getting tired of the scene being labelled as a drug haven because drugs
are no more prevalent at raves than at schools and nightclubs, where busts
are rarely front-page news.

"If it was a Rod Stewart concert where everybody was smoking pot, you
wouldn't hear about it," Boone says.  "The police nick one or two dealers,
well, you're talking about one per cent of the community.  You can't hold
the other 99 per cent accountable for that.

"As far as the community is concerned, it's good riddance -- nobody wants
dealers around raves."

Vlach says it's wrong to assume that raves are a hotbed of drug activity,
and that such stereotypes further sully the reputation of those struggling
to make positive changes to the bylaw and create a true community.

"We may be the headache, but we're not the tumour.  We're getting easily
blamed because we're a small community," Vlach says.

"Rave culture and club culture and drug culture are not the same thing.
We're not the cause of the problem."

DRUG WAR ADDICTION

Just when you thought it was safe to turn on the boob tube, the Office of
National Drug Policy starts a new TV ad campaign.  The previous campaign
attempted to tie drug use to terrorism.  Among the more sinister ads was
one where an apparition of a dead girl tells a woman working in an office,
"you killed me," implying she died in a terrorist attack due to the
woman's "illegal" drug consumption.  Using the government's logic, not
only are all drug users aiding and abetting terrorist, they're murderers
too.  The latest ad campaign takes aim at internal dissenters and critics
of the drug war.  It features two men talking, one of them saying simply
to legalize drugs.  The response is, "so you want drugs sold to kids on
playgrounds.....," to which the original speaker says, "I guess it's not
such a good idea." To attempt to discuss the 30+ year drug war in a 30
second snippet is a serious attempt to insult most Americans intelligence.

The ad campaign does prove that, not only do bureaucrats and politicians
not get out much, but they also have too much time and money on their
hands.  These ads cost hundreds of millions of tax dollars to produce and
air, yet by the Office of National Drug policy's own admission, have
little if any effect on drug consumption.

Unlike the governments ads, lets seriously consider some of the causes and
effects of the drug war.  The first assumption made by the drug warriors
is that legalization will bring drugs onto our nations playgrounds.  If
the folks at the National Drug Policy Office would leave the office more
often, or venture out of the confines of their gated suburban
neighborhoods, they would see that drugs are not only being sold on
playgrounds already, but near schools as well.  Most of this happens in
lower income areas which crosses racial lines and is based purely on
economic and political conditions.  Naturally, the people living in these
areas have little if any political or economic clout.  Add to that the
facts that too many of the people living in these areas are on some sort
of government assistance, and sometimes view children as an added
government check, and you have the main ingredients for disaster.  This
attracts thugs seeking the high profits made possible by the "illegal"
status placed on these drugs by the government.  These thugs usually take
over corners, buildings and even whole streets making life much more
dangerous and difficult for law abiding citizens who have to live and work
in these areas.

The death and violence that accompanies the drug trade are due mainly to
the fact that drugs are illegal.  Young people are enticed away from entry
level jobs, with the lure of making thousands of dollars a week in illegal
drug trafficking.  Of course all this money will attract competition,
causing drive by shootings and other forms of deadly violence.  The
profits are so astronomical that even the possibility of death can't deter
those with criminal inclinations seeking a quick and "easy" buck.

The ads imply that those buying drugs are helping fund criminal
enterprises and, therefore, directly responsible for terrorism and murder.
If that ain't the pot calling the kettle black! The truth is that the only
thing keeping "illegal" drug prices and profits artificially high, is the
government's war on drugs.  The reason that criminal gangs and terrorists
around the globe profit from illegal drug sales is strictly because they
are illegal.  Those buying drugs in the inner city are no more responsible
for funding terrorism than those pumping gas at the local gas station.

Contrary to popular perceptions, drug use and addiction are not confined
to the poverty stricken.  Many of the customers of the inner city drug
traffickers are college age suburbanites, and sometimes even their
professionally employed parents.  Most of the individuals that purchase
drugs do not commit violent crimes, yet are susceptible to fines and
prison terms if caught possessing an "illegal" substance.  This, of
course, leads to overcrowded conditions in jails, too often allowing for
early release of violent criminals.

So, why would the government continue to pursue a policy for decades that
actually increases drug use and violence? To put it as succinctly as
possible, money and power.  The truth is that the drug war has created
huge bureaucracies hooked on tax dollars that fund their existence.  These
bureaucracies successes are not measured in the reduction of drug use, but
rather on the amount of money they spend and the number of arrests made.
In reality, they benefit more from an increase in drug use than from a
decrease.  They are just as addicted to taxpayer dollars, as street corner
drug dealers are to quick and easy drug profits or a junkie to his heroin.
The existence of dealers, addicts and bureaucrats are mutually dependent.

Power is also an incentive for the government continuing its war.
Politicians have used the drug war as an excuse to trample the second,
fourth and fifth amendments to the constitution, while allowing law
enforcement officers to profit by circumventing due process ( Zero
Tolerance ).  The drug war has spawned laws that allows the government to
snoop into everyone's business dealings and bank transactions.  It has
allowed our governments influence and money to spread beyond our borders.
Today, drug agents and military personnel are involved in anti-drug
trafficking operations all over the globe, including Peru where a
missionary and her infant son where killed during a US sponsored
interdiction exercise.  If one counts the number of peasant farmers
terrorized by guerrilla groups funded by illegal drug profits, the
casualties of the war on drugs rise astronomically.

Will ending the drug war end the problem of drug abuse? Absolutely not.
Drugs that alter a human's state of consciousness have been around as long
as humans have.  Legalizing certain drugs does not equal moralizing their
use or making them healthy to consume.  Strangely enough, the majority of
drugs that alter consciousness and mental function are legal and even
advertised on TV and magazines.  There are many biological and social
factors that lead to a person's desire for, or addiction to certain drugs.
History has shown time and again that all the laws in the world, or all
the law enforcement officers on this planet can not curtail some people's
appetite for drugs or money.

Will making drugs more available cause more use and or overdoses? No one
knows for sure, but ending prohibition did not cause any measurable rise
in alcoholism.  If anything it made it easier for all those who felt they
had a problem to seek treatment without fear of legal repercussions.  It
also ended the violence between bootleggers and gangsters that sought to
control the illegal flow of booze.  Who will be more vigilant of the
quality of his product and the customers survivability, a legitimate
business that can be sued or a faceless thug standing on a corner?

Speaking of prohibition, at least those that favored it were responsible
enough to follow the letter of the law by adding an amendment to the
constitution ( 18th Amendment ).  Fortunately, it was later repealed (
21st Amendment ).  Today's drug warriors have chosen to violate and
circumvent the constitution, sacrificing our rights in the interim.  Much
like ending prohibition, ending the war on drugs will vaporize profits for
criminals, ending most drug related violence and help to put an end to the
infringement of our constitutional rights.  Who knows? It may even get
drugs off our streets, out of the playground, and away from our schools.

( Editor's note: The author of this piece seems to have forgotten another
powerful incentive for government to continue the "war on [some] drugs
indefinitely.  They have given themselves the power to confiscate the
personal property of whomever they wish, even on very thin pretext of
involvement with drugs, often with no charges ever being made and
certainly not depending on any conviction of actual criminal activity.
This, along with the vast amounts of taxpayer money, makes the drug trade
extremely profitable for all levels of the government and they will do
murder and worse to prevent anything from challenging or changing this
situation.  The sad part is that the people of this country have been
hoodwinked into letting them get away with it.  Sad.  Susan Callaway,
Editor )

7.	You're a sex worker and I'm out of money.

6.	How dare you refer to the Polish Don Juan Soul Rapture as a "go".

5.	I'm a sex worker and you're out of money.

4.	Tribal council meeting right now, _hello_?!!?!

3.	I'm silently scanning the room for exits.

2.	I have "Club Tropicana" by Wham! stuck in my head, please don't

1. 	I'm cursing the guy who told me psycho girls are good in the sack.

PS: IMHO, if the guy you're with lights up a cigarette after sex, it is his 
way of saying there's no way in hell your getting "another go" because
cigarettes tend to go hand-in-hand (or rather gland-in-hand) with inability
to achieve erection, or maintain a substantial and non-boopy erection.

I AM WRITING IN CAPS SO YOU WILL KNOW MY REPLY FROM YOUR REPLY. IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH MY BIOCHEMISTRY OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT..OKAY, PEOPLE CAN SMOKE AND HAVE A BIG DING-DONGY DING THAT LASTS AND LASTS. I WAS JUST TRYING TO REMIND PEOPLE WHO ARE PARTICIPATING IN THE I WISH I COULD QUIT SMOKING ARENA, THAT REALLY GREAT FOREPLAY WITH MULTIPLE ORGASM MAKES EVERYTHING FEEL GREAT...MAYBE YOU WON'T NEED THAT CANCER STICK AFTER ALL...KEEP READING, I AM NOT DONE:

My advice to you is find a better lay, or bring more batteries for the 
Panasonic. 

I HAVE NEVER USED A VIBRATOR BEFORE. I HAVE ALSO NEVER HAD A BAD LAY. IF IT DOESN'T WORK, WE ALWAYS DO IT AGAIN A.S.A.P., BUT USUALLY IT WORKS, BECAUSE WHILE I AM AN AMERICAN, I LOVE SEX LIKE FRENCH GIRLS DO.

The guy sounds like a total asshole. But then
again, you always go for total assholes, and then complain about them on
sfraves. 

WHICH ONE? I AM NOT REFERING TO ANYONE PARTICULARLY. PERSONALLY, I HAVE HAD MEAN BOYFRIENDS, AND SUPER DUPER BOYFRIENDS. SOMETIMES, WHEN I START REFLECTING ON THE UGLY PEOPLE THOUGH, MEANING MEAN, BECAUSE I GENERALLY DON'T DO IT WITH AN UGLY GUY, I MIGHT SAY SOMETHING ABOUT IT, NOT TO COMPLAIN, BECAUSE I AM THE SORT OF PERSON WHO FIGURES THINGS OUT ON THEIR OWN, BUT TO JUST POINT IT OUT (meaning typical behaviors) IN GENERAL TO SAVE SOMEONE ELSE WHO DEALS WITH THINGS DIFFERENTLY THAN I DO A GREAT DEAL OF THE PAIN THAT I SEE PEOPLE GO THROUGH. ALSO, I AM ENHANCING MY CURRENT PLEASURE AND THE PLEASURE OF WHO I LOVE.

I think you like torturing yourself with dolts, then giving guys in
general a bad rap and a bad rep (trolling). You just need to find yourself an
appropriately undersexed computer geek and they'll probably be happy to stay
up all night with 99.99999% uptime.

NO, I AM NOT INTO SELF TORTURE. I KNOW YOU DIDN'T ASK, AND YOU ARE ENTITLED TO THINK. I SHOULD CERTAINLY HOPE THAT YOU WOULD. GLAD TO ASSIST IN THE FLOW. ANY MAN WHO KNOWS ME, LOVES ME. YOU PROBABLY DO NOW TOO. I WON'T HOLD YOU TO IT. I LOVE EVERYONE BACK, JUST LIKE MY AUNT, BUT SHE WAS MARRIED MORE THAN ONCE TOO. :) :) :) ALL DONE. GO PLAY WITH CUTIE PIE, LUCKY DOG. :)  P.S. I KNOW NERDS DO IT RIGHT. OF COURSE THEY DO, AND OF COURSE I WOULD KNOW THAT. EXPERIENCE EVERYTHING, NPM. 



PPS: yeah that's right you heard it here first.... "computer geeks are longer
and harder than the transatlantic cable and can keep it up to the 5 nines!"

Um, Mission Beach is good for Santa Cruz stylee Beach/Boardwalk type
stuff. Mexican is everywhere. Hillcrest has some good spots. But downtown
is where the majority of the nightlife is, so take your pick. Throw a
fifth in a big gulp and hire one of those bike-carts, and cruise the
clubs to get your drunk on.

Better yet, just contact Rodrigo <rod@viberation.com>, he'll hook you up
proper =)

> Terry?? HAve you left for Oregon yet?? Help!

Almost, car half-packed, camping gear in order, getting brakes done. Then
it's off to RAVE THE FUCK ON this weekend!! hehe.

You know, life is tough when you get up way way too early for something you 
thought you had to wake up for, but it gets moved back.  Even worse is when 
you're still tipsy from the night before, and the floor is moving.  

But you know, life's tough.  

I got this quote randomly off qotd.org.  You ought to go check it out when 
you get a chance, like NOW!

Subject: [sfraves] BSP: Anuerysm, Shortbus, 396, El Juan on An Epiphany Of Sound

Today we're featuring the DnB/Broken beats/craziness thing on An
Epiphany of Sound.  We're starting off with El Juan and then bringing in
Anuerysm, Shortbus and 396 for a morning of crazy beats.  If you're not
yet awake, YOU WILL BE!  Too bad we can only go for 3 hours.  But those
3 hours are this morning from 9a-Noon.  And of course we've got passes
to about 8 different events for the weekend.

Do listen in.  90.1 FM in the Bay area, or online at
http://kzsulive.stanford.edu

It's got something to do with the speed of the beats. It's hypnotic, 
tribal, and primal. That particular speed has worked for thousands of 
years, which is why you can spin in Arab music, Bhangra music, Aboriginal 
music... You can take all these different cultures and find the same beat, 
between 125-130 bpm. It's there in ecstatic, trance music, where people 
shake and spin until they reach a state of hyperventilation and psychedelic 
alpha-wave experience. In a sense (house) is regressive music. You're going 
back to the roots of why music was invented: to reach ecstatic and 
visionary states, in a communal tribal celebration.

MALACHY ON HOUSE

"When used with positive intention, Group energy has the potential to help 
restore the plan of Love on Earth...When you open your heart, and trust the 
whole group you dance with; when you feel love with everyone, and they 
return it, a higher vibration can be reached. This happens when a crowd is 
deep into the vibe of House...In the true sense of rhythmic movement, the 
effect is to align the physical, mental and emotional bodies with the 
Oneness of All that Is...Don't put out negative energy and feelings. Leave 
the old ways behind. Throw yourself into the winds of transformation and 
sow the seeds for a new world -- one where the human family is together 
again. When people respect each and care for each other as a 
community-organism...Spread the Peace!"

Come share another evening of unity through music and dance
with San Francisco's oldest house family.


Love,

Apollo

Seemed like Wicked had a problem where the Wicked faithful got stuck outside
waiting in a horrendous line while the joe schmoe's packed the place. I
really hope that the Come-Unity family gets there early, fills the place and
truly sets the tone for the night. That might sound a tad elitist, but it's
not meant to be. Wicked felt a bit off in the vibe the crowd gave off. It
wasn't what I normally expected from a Wicked party. Hoping for a better
feeling this time around (and hopefully some better performance from the
dj's!).

Like last time Andrew Phelan will be having a warmup session at his house (1
block away from the club). It would be great to get a group together early
and head over together. =)

Thanks everyone! I appreciate the reponses. Now it looks I have some areas
to look into. I kinda want to go to TJ since I haven't been there in 12
years. I'm not going down there by myself and will likely have another
couple with me. Things sketchy as hell given all the tension in the world?
Hmmm. Guess I'll have to call some people and find out.

Um, Mission Beach is good for Santa Cruz stylee Beach/Boardwalk type
stuff. Mexican is everywhere. Hillcrest has some good spots. But downtown
is where the majority of the nightlife is, so take your pick. Throw a
fifth in a big gulp and hire one of those bike-carts, and cruise the
clubs to get your drunk on.

Better yet, just contact Rodrigo <rod@viberation.com>, he'll hook you up

Almost, car half-packed, camping gear in order, getting brakes done. Then
it's off to RAVE THE FUCK ON this weekend!! hehe.

i realize it's a bit of a trek for most sfravers, but
for anyone who might be interested, there is a
festival taking place in downtown monterey this
weekend, may 24 & 25, from 11am to 6pm.

the festival features free admission, live bands
(rock, blues, latin, jazz, etc) and other
entertainment, international food booths, arts &
crafts vendors, fun-for-the-whole-family! etc etc. 
and last but not least, i will be there both days

Um, Mission Beach is good for Santa Cruz stylee Beach/Boardwalk type
stuff. Mexican is everywhere. Hillcrest has some good spots. But downtown
is where the majority of the nightlife is, so take your pick. Throw a
fifth in a big gulp and hire one of those bike-carts, and cruise the
clubs to get your drunk on.

Better yet, just contact Rodrigo , he'll hook you up
proper =)

Almost, car half-packed, camping gear in order, getting brakes done. Then
it's off to RAVE THE FUCK ON this weekend!! hehe.

I personally stopped going to the Wicked club events after a terrible 
experience at the DNA.  My advice to them was, and is, to do presales.

As for Malachy's Come-Unity -- it's always difficult to predict who will 
show up at a club event.  The tenth anniversary party at Barneveld was an 
excellent time, even though I thought there were too many people inside -- 
but most of the folks were family.

I have high hopes for this party.  The last Come-Unity was in a year ago at 
King Street.  As you know, it was a monthly for eleven years.  CU was 
originally held on the first Wednesday of each month and that kept the 
party focused on the passionate house heads.  But times change, and the 
number of dancers able to party until five on a Wednesday night 
declined.  I used to negotiate with my employers to come in at noon on 
Thursdays, but the 24/7 economy in the late nineties killed the Wednesday 
nite deal.

So they moved to the first Friday of the month.  Results were mixed.  Some 
nights one had the family.  Other evenings it was clubbers who didn't care 
about the music.  On the whole, though, the CUs at Mission Rock were 
quality events.  From Malachy's perspective, however, the costs were so 
high there that he could barely make a profit.

For me, this party was a monthly family reunion.  There were people who 
came to this event for over a decade, as I did, and dancing with them over 
the years brought much happiness to me.   I expect that many of them will 
be there Friday.

I'll probably help with set up on Friday, go home, and then head in around 
twelve or so.  The party goes until 6:30 am, so if I don't like what's 
going down then I'll go over to Club 6 and come back later.

Love,

Apollo

i am just reminding you to eat your veg. i thought spinach was supposed to be full of iron, but not hardly. it has a whole lot of vitamin a though, and a tad of calcium. you get a lot of vit. a in carrots too, and also, i recently heard a horror story of someone getting really sick from taking a vitamin supplement that was loaded with vitamin a. whatever. either way, you want to eat your leafy greens. they are supposed to have an anti-oxidant effect, meaning, could prevent cancer, since we are on the subject and since i am once again contemplating death. i am not depressed, but lots of times, i think, what is the point. i am going to die anyway. i've sure seen a lot of people just die, plus, we are all going, but if you eat well, maybe you'll feel better, and then when i die, you won't be sad, because you don't need me anymore. :) hahahahahahahahahah. that was my evil laugh. evil on line. i am going to go on vacation without you too. hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahah. i like it that way. :)

Subject: [sfraves] Live Mix @ Minimal Monday Online

Yo....

I just got my live mix from Minimal Monday (2 weeks ago) on a 5 gigabit/s drop:
http://www.egregious.net/comps/live_mix_5_5_03/
Hit it while I got it...

This is probably the grooviest set I've ever DJed. I still kept my 
aggressive mixing intact; some long ones too...

I'll see some of you out in SF Friday night hopefully... I guess keep your 
ear low to the ground.. ;)

Best,

Subject: [sfraves] Orbital on ER!

not sure if it was a re-run since i don't watch ER on a regular basis....but 
Orbital was on (kinda)!

some of the female doctors want to go out after work and one of them says 
"Orbital is playing at the (some bar/club)"

so three of them go to the club.  two are sitting while one has a glowstick 
in her hand (drug paraphenalia!  arrest that woman!).

they have brief stage shot with a guy who could be one of the 
hartnolls...can't see his face but he does have the signature flashlight 
things on his head.  i think it's "frenetic" playing in the background.

and the doctor played by ming-na wen stage dives at the very end.

i think it's kinda cool that they actually mentioned Orbital at all...and 
then were actually playing an Orbital song at the club.  i mean, they could 
have very well have used some other band or musical act...or even just not 
mentioned it at all and just gone to a club with generic dance music.

i don't really have a point with this...i just thought it was cool that 
Orbital was on ER.  =)

I spoke with them yesterday..They had put one of our dj's on their flyer
with out talking to us. I find it highly unlikely that they are  going to
pull their flyer though.

I need to find out who happy huggy productions is comprised of as well as if
they really have put flyers out for their next party. Aspects of the lineup
are VERY incorrect and those flyers will need to be pulled. No, I'm not
kidding. If you're involved it's in your best interests to get back to me

Subject: [sfraves] Anyone know anything re: Mission Rock tonight?

Ok, so there's this "Memorial Day Massive" bizness @ Kelly's Mission 
Rock tonight. It looks to be mostly hip-hop, but I wanna go because 
Andy from Groove Armada will reportedly be spinning... Now my question 
is, is this event legit? It's put on by Obscure Productions who A) 
haven't updated their web site since Halloween and B) promoted the 
"Daft Crew World Tour" w/ Thomas Bangalter a while back and then pulled 
it last minute.

I'm nearly broke and recovering from a cold - is it even worth my time 
to hike my ass up to the city for this? Or are they just shady?

  - omid

i sure hope that anyone who deserves to have a nice weekend will, and that anyone else won't. seriously...no one has asked, but just in case you've been wondering, yes, it is hard to be so patient and so smart, and no, i don't think i could spend that much time with my intellectual inferior, not for any reason, unless the person was in a coma. then, i would be interested. thank you. :)

Subject: Re: [sfraves] LA UG's this weekend ? ? ? (was re: happy huggy... :: WHO :: is this group)

it's okay... printed flyers are only used for littering the ground anyway

so if someone in the know has info on an 18+ ug in LA area this weekend you'd make a small group of
good people very happy.  not *tooo* picky... electro, breaks, dnb, techno, good hip hop, anything
interesting.   more music, less non-mutual backrubs.

big thanks !

 I dont think this would be the reason to leap forward in life. The djs are as 
played out as a 12 year veteran Thai hooker, who works two dicks like ANIMAL 
off the Muppets. Its awesome that they made it this far with those used up meat 
curtains. I have seen these uninspired djs and I would rather fast forward a 
few years to when I am 65, would you like to join me as these fucks wont be 
playing then. Where is the talent in the bay, these fucks arent talent but 
used up names that pull the yuppies in. Drinking cocktails chasing split tail 
(pussy) kind of chumps, I am not for the meat market shit. This is about 
progress not stagnant murky pond water.

played out as a 12 year veteran Thai hooker, who works two dicks like ANIMAL
off the Muppets. Its awesome that they made it this far with those used up
meat
curtains. I have seen these uninspired djs and I would rather fast forward a
few years to when I am 65, would you like to join me as these fucks wont be
playing then. Where is the talent in the bay, these fucks aren't talent but
used up names that pull the yuppies in. Drinking cocktails chasing split
tail
(pussy) kind of chumps, I am not for the meat market shit. This is about
progress not stagnant murky pond water.

We did an interview w/ Malachy on KUSF a year or so back. Pretty amazing shit. Unfortunately it's in Real Audio format and our new Internet host doesn't have a Real server, so it can't be accessed. I'm gonna convert it to MP3 one of these days and forward the URL to the list.

House Music 101:  http://livingart.com/raving/articles/housemusic101.htm

"Many persons have a wrong idea of what constitutes true happiness.  It is 
not attained through self-gratification, but through fidelity to a purpose."
-Helen Keller

"I know what the great cure is:  it is to give up, to relinquish, to 
surrender, so that our little hearts may beat in unison with the great 
heart of the world."
-Henry Miller

"Loyalty is the realization that America was born of revolt, flourished in 
dissent, became great through experimentation. Our tradition is one of 
protest and revolt, and it is stultifying to celebrate the rebels of the 
past while we silence the rebels of the present."
-Henry Steele Commager

Ok I will give you Mark Farina cause he had some good o.g ideas in 97. But like 
a lesser Mc Hammer let it die and try something new. Yo, age dont mean shit I 
could see twice the talent at an ug spot, with some down ducklings and have 
twice the space to shake some tail. While you're dropping buckets of cash 
towards a girl that wants Jeno. I would rather take my littlest duckling 
somewhere and treat her to some nice things. While you drop 20 for the same 
lame sound with gweeto's still that girl you just bought some watered down 
drinks for. 
 KDB 
Progression with the DUCK MINION POSSE!!!!!!!!!

Hmmmmmmmmm, i can kinda feel him on the 2.  More so Jeno though.  I've never really been impressed with him or his sets.  Mark he'l always hold a spot in my heart.  His cd's pretty much all rock, save a couple of them.  and for the most party he's at least a consistant dj.  The last handful of times i've seen him, i've had mixed feelings.  A few of them have been really good sets, but some of them have been really mellow and too downtempo for me, nothing to motivate me to dance which i dont like.  But so far as i've noticed it's up to par with most big name dj's.  they just dont motivate me to sweat my ass off dancing like they used to.  could be a product of their environment or the music they're picking...who knows.

Yh, I heard in Vegas that you can gamble, get loaded and walk the streets;
And I even heard a rumor that they might have strip clubs. I am not sure
what that means, but they must be hard to find...

Man, sucks to be you...try not to get bored. Maybe there is a barnes n
nobles, so you can catch up on reading...

lol.

Subject: RE: [sfraves] vegas

Yeah, totally..  For vegas, undergrounds are almost non-existant.  Take
nice clothes for the clubs they got there or they'll turn you away at
the door.  If you're under 21 the best way to party is to have a 21+
along for the ride with ya and get the yard o' margaritas and walk the
strip.  

Word of warning:  While it may look like fun, do not have sex with two
girls while smoking up, then steal a ferrari with a gun in it, shoot a
bouncer after touching some strippers and getting chased by goons.  It
tends to end your vacation short.

Check out Rubber at the Palms.  Seven (Alesium) is on the strip, and is
tight on Saturdays after 3am .  House of Blues Monday night.
Also for after after hours after 6am, check out Glo at Ibiza USA (across
from Seven on the strip)
Drai's used to be tight, but turned a little commercial. Havent been there
in a while.

Ps- these are all 21+ with fashionable clothes.

Expect long lines and at least $30-40 at the doors.
If you are looking the inexpensive route, try the Hard Rock center bar or
Baby's at Hard Rock, or just hang out in front of Rain at Palms the lobby is
literally a mad house.  Also Mandalay Bay is cool.  For a big weekend,
expect to drop some coin. They pump up the prices.

Peace.

just sharing...out and about, and of course, being studied like a bug. i can't stand it, but at least, i don't feel angry. there are tons of opportunities for me to show my boob job off lately, but, i have not really been taking anyone up on it. i have been telling people where they can go and share their boob jobs though. yep, as i glance in my periferal (sp?) vision, i am being repeatedly glanced at. someone is keeping the glancer company, but it doesn't matter...i, unfortunately, am the object of attention, and perhaps, even grosser, affection. gross. it is an unwavering stare. i am not even showing any skin wrapped in silicone or anything. shit, it must be friday. :) :) :) :)

Check out Spundae at the "House of Blues" on Sunday night! 

chris fenton <info@deafignition.com> wrote:Check out Rubber at the Palms. Seven (Alesium) is on the strip, and is
tight on Saturdays after 3am . House of Blues Monday night.
Also for after after hours after 6am, check out Glo at Ibiza USA (across
from Seven on the strip)
Drai's used to be tight, but turned a little commercial. Havent been there
in a while.

Ps- these are all 21+ with fashionable clothes.

Expect long lines and at least $30-40 at the doors.
If you are looking the inexpensive route, try the Hard Rock center bar or
Baby's at Hard Rock, or just hang out in front of Rain at Palms the lobby is
literally a mad house. Also Mandalay Bay is cool. For a big weekend,
expect to drop some coin. They pump up the prices.

Peace.

Friday, May 23, 2003 ** COME-UNITY:  Twelfth Anniversary Party **

It's got something to do with the speed of the beats. It's hypnotic,
tribal, and primal. That particular speed has worked for thousands of
years, which is why you can spin in Arab music, Bhangra music, Aboriginal
music... You can take all these different cultures and find the same beat,
between 125-130 bpm. It's there in ecstatic, trance music, where people
shake and spin until they reach a state of hyperventilation and
psychedelic alpha-wave experience. In a sense (house) is regressive music.
You're going back to the roots of why music was invented: to reach
ecstatic and visionary states, in a communal tribal celebration.

Simon Reynolds, "Where 'now' lasts longer," in Blissed Out (London:
Serpent's Tail, 1990)

COME-UNITY:  Twelfth Anniversary Party On the turntables: Mark Farina (OM
Records), Jeno (Wicked), Simon (Come-Unity; Future Dreams), Cosmik Jason
(Imperial Dub; Come-Unity), DJ Adnan (Tarantic; PR2) with Drum Fire (aFRO
mYSTIK; OM Records) 10:30pm - 6:30am, $10 before 11 PM, $15 thereafter,
21+ MALACHY ON HOUSE - "When used with positive intention, Group energy
has the potential to help restore the plan of Love on Earth...When you
open your heart, and trust the whole group you dance with; when you feel
love with everyone, and they return it, a higher vibration can be reached.
This happens when a crowd is deep into the vibe of House...In the true
sense of rhythmic movement, the effect is to align the physical, mental
and emotional bodies with the Oneness of All that Is...Don't put out
negative energy and feelings. Leave the old ways behind. Throw yourself
into the winds of transformation and sow the seeds for a new world -- one
where the human family is together again. When people respect each and
care for each other as a community-organism...Spread the Peace!" Come
share another evening of unity through music and dance with San
Francisco's oldest house family.

Saturday, June 7, 2003 ** Lo=F6q Hard at 111 Minna **

Lo=F6q Hard is the home of the four hour set. It's the only party in San
Francisco where you will find this kind of complete creative expression
from some of the best DJ's in the world. Four hours will bring out a depth
and intensity in DJ's you thought you knew. We're not talking about a
boring journey through a mediocre record crate, we're talking about four
hours of top-notch tunes from the cream of the crop who have more good
music than can possibly be shared in the average 1-2 hour set.

This month featuring: Spesh (Qo=F6l, Lo=F6q, Renaissance, Bedrock) Spesh is=
 an
American DJ/Producer based in San Francisco. He has been a DJ for more
than 15 years and performs regularly at top American club nights such as
Spundae, Release and as well as holding down his legendary weekly San
Francisco residency at Qo=F6l. Spesh's sound is an absolutely unique blend
of genres that come together in sets that evolve seamlessly from the
subtle, deep and hypnotic to huge and emotive and back again. In 2002 his
sought after sets have kept him in the clubs every weekend as well doing
guest mixes for various radio shows including John Digweed's Kiss FM
broadcast.

Friday, May 23, 2003 ** COME-UNITY:  Twelfth Anniversary Party **

It's got something to do with the speed of the beats. It's hypnotic,
tribal, and primal. That particular speed has worked for thousands of
years, which is why you can spin in Arab music, Bhangra music, Aboriginal
music... You can take all these different cultures and find the same beat,
between 125-130 bpm. It's there in ecstatic, trance music, where people
shake and spin until they reach a state of hyperventilation and
psychedelic alpha-wave experience. In a sense (house) is regressive music.
You're going back to the roots of why music was invented: to reach
ecstatic and visionary states, in a communal tribal celebration.

Simon Reynolds, "Where 'now' lasts longer," in Blissed Out (London:
Serpent's Tail, 1990)

COME-UNITY:  Twelfth Anniversary Party On the turntables: Mark Farina (OM
Records), Jeno (Wicked), Simon (Come-Unity; Future Dreams), Cosmik Jason
(Imperial Dub; Come-Unity), DJ Adnan (Tarantic; PR2) with Drum Fire (aFRO
mYSTIK; OM Records) 10:30pm - 6:30am, $10 before 11 PM, $15 thereafter,
21+ MALACHY ON HOUSE - "When used with positive intention, Group energy
has the potential to help restore the plan of Love on Earth...When you
open your heart, and trust the whole group you dance with; when you feel
love with everyone, and they return it, a higher vibration can be reached.
This happens when a crowd is deep into the vibe of House...In the true
sense of rhythmic movement, the effect is to align the physical, mental
and emotional bodies with the Oneness of All that Is...Don't put out
negative energy and feelings. Leave the old ways behind. Throw yourself
into the winds of transformation and sow the seeds for a new world -- one
where the human family is together again. When people respect each and
care for each other as a community-organism...Spread the Peace!" Come
share another evening of unity through music and dance with San
Francisco's oldest house family.

Subject: RE: [sfraves] vegas

Yeah, I lived there for a little while and that seemed to be the only
way to find anything good underground.  Most of the parties I went to
were just at rock quarries or house parties (with no EDM, it was all
about metal and extreme sports).  I went to a couple of undergrounds,
one at a strip club afterhours and another one at the Candy Factory when
it was around but for the most part people don't rave, its just too
risky..

you actually might be able to scrounge up something pseudo underground
if 
you check www.eternalbeats.net and are willing to do a little work...
but 
that scene is mostly kids (but they do party).

I usually delete junk emails as well, but, this was too funny not to share
...
Jack Triumph

 Oil Change instructions for Women:
    Pull up to Jiffy Lube when the mileage reaches 3000 miles (or
thereabouts :-) since the last oil change.

    Drink a cup of coffee.

    15 minutes later write a check and leave with a properly maintained
vehicle.


Money spent:
Oil Change $30.00, Coffee $1.00

Total $31.00


Oil Change instructions for Men:

    Wait until Saturday, drive to auto parts store and buy a case of oil,
filter, kitty litter, hand cleaner and a scented tree, write a check for
$50.00.

    Stop by liquor store and buy a case of beer, write a check for $20.00,
drive home.

    Open a beer and drink it.

    Spend 30 minutes looking for jack stands. Jack car up.

    Find jack stands under kid's pedal car.

    In frustration, open another beer and drink it.

    Place drain pan under engine.

    Look for 9/16 box end wrench.

    Give up and use crescent wrench.

    Drop drain plug in pan of hot oil: splash hot oil on face and arms in
process. Cuss.

    Crawl out from under car to wipe hot oil off of face and arms. Throw
kitty litter on spilled oil.

    Have another beer while watching oil drain.

    Spend 30 minutes looking for oil filter wrench.

    Give up; crawl under car and hammer a screwdriver through oil filter and
twist off.

    Crawl out from under car with dripping oil filter splashing oil
everywhere from holes. Cleverly hide old oil filter among trash in trash can
to avoid environmental penalties.

    Drink a beer.

    Buddy shows up; finish case of beer with him. Decide to finish oil
change tomorrow so you can go see his new garage door opener work.

    Sunday: Skip church because "I gotta finish the oil change." Drag pan
full of told oil out from underneath car. Cleverly dump oil in hole in back
yard instead of taking it to recycle.

    Throw kitty litter on oil spilled during step 18.

    Beer? No, drank it all yesterday.

    Walk to liquor store; buy beer.

    Install new oil filter making sure to apply a thin coat of oil to gasket
surface.

    Dump first quart of fresh oil into engine.

    Remember drain plug from step 11.

    Hurry to find drain plug in drain pan.

    Remember that the used oil is buried in a hole in the back yard along
with drain plug.

    Drink beer.

    Shovel out hole and sift oily mud for drain plug. Re-shovel oily patch
of ground and avoid environmental penalties. Wash drain plug in lawnmower
gas.

    Discover that first quart of fresh oil is now on the floor. Throw kitty
litter on oil spill.

    Drink beer.

    Crawl under car getting kitty litter into eyes. Wipe eyes with oily rag
used to clean drain plug. Slip with stupid crescent wrench tightening drain
plug and bang knuckles on frame.

    Bang head on floorboards in reaction to step 31

    Begin cussing fit.

    Throw stupid crescent wrench.

    Cuss for additional 10 minutes because wrench hit Miss December (1992)
in the left boob.

    Beer.

    Clean up hands and forehead and bandage as required to stop blood flow.

    Beer.

    Beer.

    Dump in five fresh quarts of oil.

    Beer.

    Lower car from jack stands.

    Accidentally crush remaining case of new motor oil.

    Move car back to apply more kitty litter to fresh oil spilled during
steps 23-43.

    Beer.

    Test drive car.

    Get pulled over: arrested for driving under the influence.

    Car gets impounded.

    Call loving wife to come make your bail.

    12 hours later, get car from impound yard.


Money spent:
Parts $50.00, DUI $2500.00, Impound fee $75.00, Bail $1500.00, Beer $40.00
Total-- $4165.00 -- But you know the job was done right!

Subject: [sfraves] popsicle 5

well, Popsiscle 5 turned out to be a great initiation into the rave world!

i'm tryin to find out the dj's who were playing all the way in the right
back corner of the concourse, those 2 dj's had me goin from 10-2pm
incredible tunes, so non-stop that i just about passed out. well if anyone
can help me out with the names of those dj's it would be cool because
thats the kinda of tunes i can dance all night to, hell the place was so
damn big and unmarked, i didn't what area i was in.


thx for all the tips and lookin forward to some more awesome tunes.

peace

Mack Smith

Subject: [sfraves] massive

i just came back from popsicle and i can't sleep, so i thought i would
share with you a rant that's been brewing my head all night...  i hadn't
been to a massive in years, and i had a good time - but there's something
about it that makes me uncomfortable.  a food court doesn't seem right
(though i can think of several occasions where it would have been
nice).   i was annoyed that i couldn't bring cigarettes or gum
inside.  but it's more than that - raves for me mean the love and the
DIY, a crew that is throwing a bare bones party just becausee they
love doing it.  kids in a warehouse, in the forest, on the beach.  the
last time i went to cyberfest a few years back, it was sponsored by Got
Milk?, or at least it's skate show was.  the radio staions that
sponsored popsicle are owned by companies like viacom and
clearchannel.  here i'm torn, because there is something so unique about
those huges raves, and skills wouldnt't have been able to put it on
without sponsors.  but i don't think big corporations should have a hand
in our scene.  i don't know, maybe i've just been to burning man too many
times...  in any event, i think i'm going to stick to the UG for a
while.  i don't like being searched, herded, and watched over by cops, or
even security guard.  we can take care of ourselves!  maybe i'm just
bitter because i didn't see the people i was supposed to meet there even once. 
;)  (i did meet a nice girl on the way home, though.  nice girl: if
you're reading this, email me.  ;)  i told you a joke about a pirate.)

as i was saying:

ravers, i call you to the streets in multitudes - to the hills!  now is
the time to take things into our own hands.  with new anti-rave laws on
the books, the underground is more important than ever.  you must go to
the smaller parties!  you must throw your own parties!  do it now, now is
the only good time to do anything.   throw them in the forest!  throw them
in your rich friend's loft!  you don't have to be a musician - you just
have to know what you like.

i'm not trying to insult folks who really dig the massives, but if you've
never been to a smaller party, you really should try it out.  it's much
more intimate.  and you can keep your gum.  granted, it doesn't have that
massive throbbing presence of a popsicle.  it also doesn't have cops,
door searches, vendors, and corporate sponsorship.  but even if you don't
care about that stuff, try it anyway - there are fewer people there but
you get to know more of them.  

anyway, next time i'll have to join the roll call.  :)  i think my friend
flaked out on me for some girl, and with that i wish him the best of
luck...

and total science kicked my ass - didn't there used to be two of them?  it
was good to see the local dnb peeps too.

j

ps.  if anyone would like to talk about an idea a friend of mine are
working on for an "open source" collective/mp3label, hit me back
privately.  we are both djs and producers, and envision a collective that
throws parties with djs and laptop rockers, and also releases music
(hopefully on actual physical media someday) by artists in the collective
in a free as in "speech" manner sort of like the GPL.  we think this will
foster cooperation and greater creativity,,,  join... us....

Subject: Re: [sfraves] popsicle 5

glad you had a good time...  i spent most the night in the drum n' bass
room, but according to the thingy they gave me at the gate, that would
have been:

10-11 bazooka joe & reckless ryan
11-12 tuff twins
12-12:30 ajax
12:30-1:30  disko shawn
1:30-2 paul the fanman

unless i'm mistaken about which room that is...

you should come to an underground party next time... :)  i'll introduce
you to some nice poeople.

goodnight,

Subject: RE: [sfraves] Simon Berry--that was the dude

I could make one.  I have almost all of those tracks on vinyl.  =P  Here are
some that I remember...

Turkish Bizarre (his track with POB)
Love Washes Over
Madagascar (the original)
Calling Your Name (his remix of the Jan Johnston track)
Do You Hear Me (his remix of the Indiana track)

Simon rocked the trance very very nicely.  It's not very often I get to meet
my "idols" but I did meet Simon, and got a pic with him.  Schweeeeeeeeeet...
a foo-foo trance DJ's dream.  =)

OK... LoL... I had a really Groovy weekend but part of still can't =
believe I did what I did & man.... it was all so confussing @ the =
begining!

OK.... there were like 2 Mondo events happening in the Bay Area on =
Saturday night: My Homeboy's Birthday in the South Bay & the SFLNC =
Fundraiser @ Studio Z!  I mean... when I found out about both of them =
being in the same night... I was kinda torn 'cause w/o a car... I was @ =
1 or the other... ooh my goodness.. so confussing!

Anywaze... @ the last minute... I was invited 2 like go 2 LA 4 this =
Candy Party which @ 1st I wasn't 2 sure about goin' all the way there =
for, but when I saw the line up... Hello 2Day... I saw Klute's name & =
well... I ain't talk 2 Klute since like the Sister Party @ MIssion Rock =
last summmer, so I really wanted 2 see him & oh man, we have Groovy =
conversations when he's around the Bay Area & we're like hangin' out =
somewhere =3D)

So I dunno.. I made this like total mondo decision 2 flake on my Bay =
Area commitments this once & do something different!  I mean... I felt =
soooo guilty about doing it... but this was my chance 2 jus' ummmm... =
lol... put some Hello 2Day in2 my life I guess...LoL!  I mean =
seriously... I was not gonna go @ 1st 'cause well... I really wanted 2 B =
@ the fundraiser & that Line UP was Mondo Yummy!  I also wanted 2 kick =
it w/ Sloth on his Birthday & all the Homie's who were gonna be @ that =
shindig!!  But I dunno... OK... any1 who calls me a Friendster Whore =
'cause I <3 Friendster will get the middle finger from me...LoL.... but =
I been talkin' 2 Friendsters on IRC alot & well... they actually twisted =
my arm 2 go down there 4 this party called 31 FLAVORS!!  Honestly... @ =
the last minute...I decided 2 like go, ya know!

So I took BART 2 Freemont Saturday morning & Ven =
http://www.friendster.com/user.jsp?id=3D40771 picked me up & we drove =
down 2 LA!!!  Met Up w/ like Atomic =
http://www.friendster.com/user.jsp?id=3D35418 & Ed =
http://www.friendster.com/user.jsp?id=3D195240 & a non Friendster Brian! =
 A a few hours later... we went 2 31 Flavors!!  OK.. so it was @ this =
venue called Qtopia & it's a cute place!!!  There are 3 rooms!! 1 side =
room had Foo Trance playing that later turned in2 Disco HOuse, a main =
room 4 Jungle & umm... Hip Hop, & another side room that played =
Progressive, Tek, & Melodic house!!  Oh Yeah... ran in2 Maggy =
http://www.friendster.com/user.jsp?id=3D145889 who I've been wanting 2 =
meet 4 months now & as soon as we saw each other... we gave each other =
this Mondo HUG =3D)

OK... it's kinda sad when like all three rooms train wreck @ the same =
time which kinda happened alot @ the begining =3D\   The Hip Hop DJs =
that went on were totally Weak... oh my goodness man... there was even a =
Hip Hop 2X4 which totally Sucked!!!  But the Mondo Groovy news was that =
the last 3 Jungle DJs that spun were so Awesome!!!  Totally DMAO when =
they spun!!!! , Oh yeah...Loved it!!!  But unfortunately, Klute didn't =
make it out & I was kinda bummed about that =3D(

But there were alota good House DJs there!!!  I'd go in 1 of those rooms =
occasionally & Groove 4 a bit!!  I even met some Groovy SoCal ravers & =
LoL.... I dunno... I kinda felt like I was @ a Sac party of something!  =
BUt it was fun though!  I mean.... honestly, for me when the Jungle got =
better, the party got better I think!!!  I mean... it was like another =
candy party, whatever, but it was kinda different & iteventually became =
funner as the night went through!! Ummmm... I guess alota local DJs were =
spinning there & alota of them got skillz!  I was jus' really sour by =
the oooh my gosh, that 2X4 Hio Hop whatever they tried to do & it wasn't =
all that HOnestly!

BUt it was Groovy havin' out lil' Friendster group hangin' out 2gether & =
makin' the most of something that sucked....LoL!  I mean... when the =
party ended @ 4AM... we hung out in the parking lot 4 about an hour I =
guess!  Ven popped in a CD that 1 of the House DJs gave him & we jus' =
kicked it!!  LoL... I occasionally would start dancing & I helped the =
crew Dude clean some of the parking lot & helped pick up litter =3D)

Oh yeah... I gave Atomic some SFLNC stickers like this small role & he =
brought w/ him to the party!!  Throughout the night.... we had like =
atleast 1/4th of the party kids wear "Dancing Is Not A Crime" Stickers =
on their shirts!  So in essance... I was still doing my share of SFLNC =
work ( I hope I did)!

BUt yeah... orignally, we were suppose 2 leave on Sunday... but Ven =
decided that we shuld leave on Sunday!  So like we went back 2 Atomic's =
pad & kicked it!!  I guess around like 1 something.... Ven & I left back =
 come here & man... I Love being back home, but I miss my Socal =

LoL... I'm still kinda in shock that I did all that & all w/in 32 =
Hours!!!! Interesting how it all happened!!!  YAAAAAAAAAY... it was =

kinda good, kinda sad, because people died, but for the future of your families, and your present day life....oh, another subject: people will do just about anything to legitimize themselves in the eyes of the popular beholder...they'll do anything even if it means compromising themselves and the quality of their own situation, and hence reciprocally (sp?), the situation of others too. this happens, and  when someone denies the truth and lives to tell about it through lies, the whole ship goes under, but you can still press on all the way. gotta fill that hole up some how, some way, right? :)

Artists Profiles

WARMDESK:
http://aposteriori.org/wdsk.html

Warmdesk is the project of chicago-based producer William Selman. The sound 
of Warmdesk has evolved from his earliest work of musique concrete and 
skewed rhythms into combining these elements into stripped-down minimal 
techno. Still present are the dubby textures and samples from everyday life, 
but now they coexist with smooth chords and rhythmic grooves. The desire is 
to create a multi-faceted "spray" of sound grounded by a pulse of beats and 
concrete sounds. Formerly a drummer, Selman's strategy is to allow rhythm to 
intuitively develop through repetition instead of the current obsession with 
changing its timbre and structure every measure.

Warmdesk has released material on several labels, including deluxe, bip-hop, 
static caravan and fallt. He has just released the "guero variations" cd for 
the well-regarded deluxe label (home of electric birds, blechtum from 
blechdom and matmos's early endeavors). The record is composed almost 
completely with sounds from the piano without actually playing the keys and 
according to the portland mercury's Dave Segal, it "makes musique concrete 
detritus shimmy and shake with glee." He is about to release a 12" on his 
own label with remixes by Stephan Mathieu and Ulrich Troyer. He is also 
working on a collaborative project of unapologetic dancefloor cut-and-paste 
with Forte Record's Matt Mercer. Selman is currently completing a master's 
degree in computer science.

ARK & SETY: (*content taken from Ark web site)
http://www.djouls.com/ark/

Ark is the artist who first brought the minimal style to many French. As 
soon as 1997 he issues on the Brif label "Siderurgie esthtique" and "De 
derrire les fagots", two EPs which were not much f a great success... It's 
logical, Ark is a precurssor, always light years ahead of his time.) (But he 
doesn't loose faith in his craft for that, and collaborates in 1999 with 
Herbert (UK) and Losoul (GER) on "Belle lurette". Everyone got skeptic 
listening to this new music and yet, as today Losoul or Herbert have became 
stars of the genre, they discover the sound of Ark!

PIN-UP MOTEL:
http://www.pinupmotel.com/

PIN-UP MOTEL is:
Dan Racanelli (Keyboards)
Jameson Edwards (Guitar, Vox, Keys)
Martin Przybyla (Guitar, Bass, Vox)
Alex Feldman (Drums)

ZYGOTE: (Prepared Audio)
http://www.bayimproviser.com/StephenRuiz

Stephen Ruiz (aka Zygote) uses the mechanized process of electronic music 
production and combines the expression of complex human feelings to create 
sound art. The tools of his output are computers, tape recorders, wires and 
other conduits of noise. His sound transcends the inhuman element of 
"technologically enhanced" production methods so vital in the world of 
electronic music producers, and in it's place submits raw and unfiltered 
emotion. While exploring the idea of personal expression through the cold 
exterior of machines, he takes the concepts of compositional indeterminacy, 
generative music and evolving cellular automata and humanizes them. The end 
result is populist music of emotional depth that illicits response via 
technology. Having trained in percussion and guitar, his compositional 
methods are rooted in structured narrative that are constantly being mutated 
under the pressure of new forms of expression.

Stephen has releases on Under the Radar Records and Alectric Records 
(Canada) and is the founding organizer of The "Under the Radar" experimental 
music and video events in San Francisco.

PETER NYBOER:
http://www.yowstar.com

Peter Nyboer is an audio and video artist and programmer living in Oakland, 
CA.  Recent work has been focused on creating commercially available 
applications for audio and video mixing using Cycling74's Max/MSP.  He has 
started to focus more on playing live music using his "Girl" loop mixer, 
playing in large and small improvisation ensembles in the Bay Area.  With 
source material such as answering machines, analog synthesizers, 
poorly-played clarinet, and thrift-store records, Peter makes sense of this 
sonic diaspora by processing it with similar effects, introducing rhythmic 
structure, and finding related tangents among the samples' native sounds.

Peter also performs live video for underground events and small clubs, often 
mixing and processing the visual details of the urban environment that are 
sometimes ignored by the passerby.  His applications can be found at 
http://www.yowstar.com and http://girl.yowstar.com

-------------------------------------------------------------
TWO YEARS AND RUNNING
-------------------------------------------------------------
Tuesday, June 3rd, 2003
Julip: 839 Geary (between Hyde and Larkin)

u.t.r.// 2 year anniversary event

DAT POLITICS:
Dat politics flash by the way of music but also texts some pixellised and 
pop snapshot focused on failed flirt and gastronomy, After work with 
innovative  and respectable labels as A-musik, Mille Plateaux, Skipp or 
Tigerbeat6, now the laptop-band collaborates with the electro-trash label 
from the Berlin-based trio Chicks On Speed to diffuse their domestic and 
terribly exotic new sonic adventures.

BLEVIN BLECHDOM:
Blevin Blectum - nee Bevin Kelley - one-third of Sagan, ex-d84 and formerly 
50% of Blectum From Blechdom. Currently Blevin plays solo and in Sagan (with 
fellow musician J Lesser and video artist Ryan Junell). Her first solo CD 
was released on Phthalo in 1999. Her second solo CD Talon Slalom was 
released May 2002 on Seattle's Deluxe Records. She makes electronic music 
with samplers and computers mostly.

LESSER:
Starting off with the templates of drum and bass but tweeking them beyond 
recognition, Lesser's music delivers crunchy snares and overdriven bass 
frequencies with a heaping helping of skeptical humor, gritty digital noise, 
and DIY instrument-building ingenuity. Soldering together new instruments 
out of the refuse of 80's mixers and synths, J Lesser avoids the standard 
sounds and strategies in favor of a confrontational, schizophrenic and often 
hilarious rethinking of conventional "intelligent: electronic dance music.

Lance Grabmiller
Born in Kansas City , Missouri in 1975. Studied viola, cello, alto 
saxophone, tenor saxophone and music composition (in that order) before 
putting all formal studies on hold with the discovery of his first four 
track tape recorder at the age of 14. Using various tapes, effects, objects, 
microphones, amplifiers, razor blades and any instruments that could be 
begged or borrowed, he created quite a din in the Midwest, most notably in 
his collaborations with Shannon Fields which included such bands as Alice's 
Offspring, Requiem (which included a revolving cast of dozens) and HSoA 
(with Martin Nieznanski), the last of which culminated in a gigantic 
performance noise nightmare that nearly destroyed the Gizmo in Galesburg, IL 
in 1994.

Co-organizer of the Under the Radar events.


DJ PERFORMANCES:

Wobbly:
Wobbly is a multi-talented artist who excels in music, painting, singing, 
writing, dancing and even woodworking. Once dubbed "Mr. High on Life", his 
colorful high energy is like electricity as it provokes intense emotion in 
his audience.

Wobbly is practical and youthful. He possesses charisma and magnetism. He's 
been a natural artist since early youth, but has restrained himself until 
recently, as his creative drive is pushing him to give to the world what 
lies inside of him. He developed himself as a portrait painter. This year, 
he's gone beyond that as he fulfills his philosophical nature in the avenue 
of music, writing and singing. He wants to live a long life and be creative. 
His fulfillment will not come until he's completed the full cycle of his 
inborn talent. His high creativity in all areas has funneled into music 
where he finds himself at this time, with his artistic ability as a painter 
having a profound effect. It appears as if his painting background shows up 
in his music as he paints pictures with his words. His broad background is 
embraced in his inspired voice.

Just a quick thanks to everyone that believed in what we were doing, and
came out.  Extra special thanks to the crew and performers that busted
thier asses, and contributed financially.  As we expected, we just
barely broke even, and it could not have been done it without your
support.

Once again, thanks!

See all you techno freaks at Mongrel Seed.

i had some ideas in mind earlier for what i was going to write, and then, well, now i am here, or wuz here, and i forgot what it was that was so funny.  i like to just sit and gaze at the photograph. makes me feel all warm and fuzzy, but, yesterday, i was full of love, but also, sort of ill, so i could only feel pleasure fading in and out. that really sucks. you know what i mean? like you know that such and such or so and so just does it for you, but the symptoms of whatever floating through your body make it hard to feel the good parts sometimes...glad that is over though. i mean, this morning was just grand, and even my fuzzy animal knows it too. gave her  a good brushing, now that she'll allow it..not hard, just soft, and only when she is not lurching over to bite. such a good natured breed. okay, if i remember what was so pressing, and time and god allow, i will post it later. :)

Subject: RE: [sfraves] Orbital on ER!

Orbital were brilliant in 1989. "Satan" was one of my
favorite songs in high school. But 1989 was a long
time ago. I hate to say it, but these days they almost
seem to have gone kinda LA. In addition to ER, Orbital
also appeared in XXX (the Vin Diesel movie), and they
did music for "The Saint" and "The Beach." Personally
I think that could be cool, I mean it was kinda cool
when Danny Elfman started doing movie music. But one
of the reasons it was cool was because he didn't ask
for the name Oingo Boingo to be listed in the credits.
Even BT has the good manners to do his movie music
under the name Brian Transeau.

Minor rant, sorry about that. For all that, I'm not
dissing Orbital. They reign supreme when it comes to
sound design and they never ever do exactly what you'd
expect. I dunno, I could go either way on this. Blah
blah blah.

Subject: [sfraves] NRR: Media Monopolies


Excerpts from several articles:
From:
http://www.alternet.org/story.html?StoryID=3D12451

"...A federal court ruling on Feb. 19 delivered a dramatic victory to
media corporations by eliminating important restrictions on media
ownership.  Analysts are predicting that mega-mergers of the past will
seem like small potatoes compared to the corporate deals that will be
possible under the new rules.

The decision "strips away a critical part of the few remaining checks and
balances on media conglomerate power," said Jeffrey Chester, executive
director of the Center for Digital Democracy.

The ruling weakens two of the main regulatory barriers that have limited
the power of television moguls. The first is a 60-year old Federal
Communications Commission rule that limits the number of broadcast TV
stations a single company can own. The cap is currently set so that a
single company cannot reach more than 35 percent of the national TV
audience. The second FCC rule prevented a company from owning both a cable
channel and a broadcast station in the same city.

The decision in the lawsuit =96 which was filed by four of the biggest medi=
a
groups, AOL Time Warner, Viacom, News Corp and NBC =96 declared these limit=
s
"arbitrary and capricious" and not in the public's best interest. The
cable/broadcast restriction was fully overturned and the station ownership
cap rule was sent back to the FCC for reconsideration.

Both financial analysts and consumer advocates agree that the court
decision =96 unless reversed on appeal or mitigated by congressional action
=96 will dramatically alter the media landscape. Media deals that were
impossible yesterday seem all but inevitable today. America Online can now
buy NBC. Comcast, which is planning to buy AT&T Broadband, could buy
Disney...

=2E..Consumer advocates, however, say the ruling will lead to bigger and
more powerful monopolies, accelerating the current trend of consolidation.
"The 'prize' these companies seek is a digital landgrab," Chester said.
Under these new rules, gargantuan media conglomerates will have the power
to control the flow of information and therefore shape public opinion. "It
will be freedom for a half-dozen major companies, not the public," Chester
said.

The ruling comes on the heels of other regulatory moves aimed at removing
barriers to media mergers. The FCC is currently considering a rule change
that will allow joint ownership of newspaper and broadcast outlets. A
recent study conducted by an alliance of public interest groups, including
the Center for Digital Democracy, the Media Access Project and Consumer
Federation of America, shows that fully two-thirds of all existing
newspaper markets and one-seventh of TV markets are monopolies.
Researchers also conclude that the elimination of the cross-ownership ban
will cut the number of independent newspaper owners by half.

Last month, the Bush administration also put forward a proposal that
critics say will weaken oversight of media companies. The measure would
shift oversight of media and cable mergers from the Federal Trade
Commission to the Department of Justice. Members of Congress, consumer
advocates, policy experts and two FTC commissioners have criticized the
proposal, saying the DOJ would be more lenient on media mergers than the
FTC. They also complain that the two Bush appointees who drafted the
proposal =96 FTC chairman Timothy Muris and assistant attorney general
Charles James =96 did it behind closed doors, seeking input only from
prominent corporate lawyers and not consumer groups...

PERSONAL EXPERIENCE IMPORTANT IN UNIVERSOUL

Three years ago today, a San Jose State University student's life changed
drastically after she slipped into a drug-induced coma.

In 2000, Erika Burhanudin, a senior majoring in graphic design, was having
a good time at a rave in San Francisco with some friends.  Attending raves
was something Burhanudin enjoyed doing.

Her manufactured good time was a product of her ecstasy high.
Burhanudin's momentary euphoria came to a halt after taking a sip of water
from a cup someone handed her.

"I remember drinking water, and right after drinking it, I started having
a big headache, and I wanted to throw up," Burhanudin said.  "When you're
on ecstasy everything is intensified by 10.  My headache became massive,
and I started freaking out."

Burhanudin described her "freaking out," as a panic attack.  She said
after vomiting on her friend and her body went numb.

"I felt like I was melting," Burhanudin said.  "I couldn't breathe, I
couldn't feel anything ...  I didn't even have the energy to speak."

Just then, a security guard came around, and her friends told him there
was something wrong with her, Burhanudin said.  The security guard shined
a light on Burhanudin's face and told her friends that her eyes had
already rolled back.

The security guard rushed her down three flights of stairs and the
paramedics and police were called, Burhanudin said.  She was rushed to a
San Francisco hospital.

"The last thing I remember was someone going, 'Are you all right' and this
big bright light," Burhanudin said.  "I knew this was my life flashing
before my eyes.  I remember thinking, 'I don't want to die yet.' "

Burhanudin said after seeing the bright light she slipped into a coma for
two days.  She said the water she drank was laced with gamma
hydroxybutyrate ( GHB ).

According to the U.S.  Drug Enforcement Administration Web site, "GHB is a
chemical that depresses the central nervous system.  On the street, it is
usually sold as an odorless, colorless liquid in water bottles.  Its
appearance is deceptively innocuous, but GHB is dangerously toxic.  GHB
generates feelings of euphoria and intoxication."

Burhanudin said the whole incident was a "life changing moment," and she
never went to a rave again.

Three years ago, Erik Otto, a junior majoring in illustration, felt his
life was not going in the right direction.

He was not attending school, he was selling drugs and he was into
graffiti.

"I got caught for graffiti three times, petty theft twice and grand theft
one time," Otto said.  "I was big into selling drugs - ecstasy, acid and
crank."

He could not hold down a job, and he used this as a means to justify
selling drugs, Otto said.

"I wanted to make quick cash, live life fast," he said.  "I liked the
whole status that came with ( selling drugs ).  People want to be around
you."

Otto said his life was full of, "false happiness," which he defined as,
"happiness that comes from material things, not happiness that's coming
internally."

After a few close calls with the law and his parents, Otto decided that he
no longer wanted to lead a life of drugs.

"A life of drugs is surrounded by evil, selfishness and greed," Otto said.
"Everyone's out to get you.  You can never relax."

Otto said he would tell himself that he would eventually quit, but it was
not until he attended a youth community program that he actually did.
There, he was able to hang out and talk about what he was going through.

"If it wasn't for the program ...  I'd probably be dead," he said.

Jason Ma, a former SJSU student, was living a similar life to Burhanudin's
and Otto's.

Throughout his high school years, Ma attended four different campuses
because he could not stay out of trouble.

He said he was selling and using drugs, and that he was heavily involved
with San Jose based Asian gangs.

During his junior year, Ma was confronted with death.

"Before a gang brawl, someone from a rival gang put a machete to my
throat," Ma said.  "We heard the siren from the campus police and we all
started running.  I was seconds from being attacked."

Facing death was not enough to keep Ma from living life in the fast lane.
A year later, he was caught stealing Armani and Valentino suits from his
place of employment at a Bay Area mall, he said.

After his case was postponed three times and was lost for six months, Ma's
case was dismissed and no charges were pressed, he said.

"They let me completely off the hook," Ma said.  "I don't know why.  I
took it as a sign from heaven."

Ma said he knew that he needed to share his experience with people his age
to show them that there is another way to live, and he decided to do so
through music and dance.

Universoul

Ma's new look at life got him thinking about ways he could inspire young
people, and in the process he came up with Universoul - an outdoor music
festival, he said.

The fraternity brawl that happened in January and Burhanudin's brush with
death were two of the main premises for bringing the event to SJSU, he
said.

"I had a vision that we really needed to have a major dance festival
without drugs and violence," Ma said.  "I want to show young people that
they can channel their energies in positive ways."

Ma calls Universoul, "A huge community effort to celebrate SJSU and young
people."

About 20 SJSU students, "from all walks of life," are involved with the
event, Ma said.

Burhanudin and Otto will be sharing a testimony in between performances.

"I'm really scared to share my story, but if it's God's will, so be it,"
Burhanudin said.  "I hope people who are thinking about doing drugs won't
want to and that there's a true happiness ...  after hearing my story."

Otto said it has been a struggle to change his life but that he is never
going to give up, and he hopes that young people will learn from his
experience.

"I don't want to preach, I just want to share," Otto said.  "I always had
a heart for people and want to help them out.  I think my story can be
inspiring."

Burhanudin and Otto said they first started going to raves for the music,
but that it slowly became about the drugs.

"I think Universoul represents the opposite of what raves have become,"
Burhanudin said.  "It is something positive and it steers people away from
drugs.  It promotes true fellowship."

"We want to get people back to loving the music," Otto said.

Ma said the event is about peace and unity through hip-hop and other kinds
of music, dance and art.

"We want everyone to unite as one in a safe environment," he said.
"Universoul is a positive way to give back to the community."

Subject: [sfraves] i made it back from vegas

like i expected, i made it back with 12 cents a twenky and enuff gas to make 
it to my house.
vegas what can i say it was fun, the only place where you can say cheers to 
a cop and he wount arrest you. yes that in it self was very weird. it would 
have been better if he would opend my beer. any ways most of my money went 
to the bartenders. to bad because of me not spending money at the stip bar 
many strippers went hungry, i feel bad because of that:(  bless them little 
angels  ) yeah i guess raving if you can call it that. is almost none 
existing in vegas. if you have the cash you get to go in first to all the 
so-called hip night clubs. if you love drinking, people watching and 
gambling then vegas is a great spot. i also should have stayed a little 
longer but the people i was with were killing my high so i opted to head on 
home. labor day is a few months away so i guess ill be taking that trip once 
again.....

well later party people

--=====================_3753585==_.ALT
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"; format=flowed

The Federal Communications Commission is reviewing a rule that would 
reportedly allow corporations to further increase their media 
ownership.  Diversity of ideas and opinions are key to the functioning of a 
healthy, stable democracy.  If a handful of corporations are able to 
control the media sources for the majority of Americans, this diversity may 
be threatened and lost.


Furthermore, despite the significant public interest in this issue, the 
Commission is meeting behind closed doors without public review or input 
from Congress on the actual rule.


It is critical that we preserve diversity and have public comment on an 
issue of this magnitude.

Thanks to all of you who shared the dance floor with us at Come-Unity on 
Friday night.

The vibe was excellent, lots of family and old friends, plenty of room to 
dance, and proper San Francisco house.

Although Come-Unity will not go back to a monthly schedule at present, the 
plan is to have future CU parties around holidays.  The next CU is 
scheduled for the July 4th weekend.

Much love,

Apollo

God Bless U!  Love, Your sister in Christ, Tami

Rejoice in the Lord always; again I will say, Rejoice. Let your gentleness be known to everyone. The Lord is near. Do not worry about anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God. And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.    Philippians 4:4-7

Please forward this if you agree...It's a little long, but I think necessary.  I know this is a rave listserv and not a marijuana listserv, so if my posting things like this offends anyone, please let me know and i won't post anymore marijuana/government stuff.

Please distribute this memo widely. Forward to family and friends who live in any of the eight states listed below. 
====================================================================== 
TO: MPP subscribers in the medical marijuana states* 
FROM: Alexis Baden-Mayer, MPP national field director 
DATE: Wednesday, May 28, 2003 
SUBJECT: Grassroots activity needed to get federal medical marijuana legislation passed! 
====================================================================== 
Wednesday, June 4, 2003, Ed Rosenthal will be sentenced in federal court for the crime of growing marijuana for sick and dying patients. Rosenthal had been acting in accordance with "Prop. 215," California's Compassionate Use Act, and with the express consent of the City of Oakland. 
On the day of Rosenthal's sentencing, hundreds of medical marijuana supporters across the country will be going to the home-state offices of their U.S. representatives to demand that Congress pass federal legislation that would keep law-abiding citizens like Ed Rosenthal out of federal prison. 
Please help us with our grassroots lobbying campaign. Reply to this e-mail or call me at 202-462-5747, ext. 114, today to learn what the Marijuana Policy Project is doing in your congressional district to push your federal legislator to sponsor federal medical marijuana legislation. 
Please look below to see if your U.S. representative is on our target list of federal legislators who have failed to support their states' medical marijuana laws. If you don't know who represents you in Congress, please take a moment to find out by entering your zip code at http://www.congress.org . 
Thank you in advance for taking action in support of medical marijuana patients and providers in your state.

Ah, but Zion has been destroyed.

But at the very end, Neo stops the machines with his hands outside the 
Matrix... so maybe Zion was just another level of Matrix?  And never really 
existed either?

"Its turtles all the way down"

Is there any real reality?  Or is it just one matrix layered on top of another?

My prediction is its going to all end with some kid playing a video

and go 'Woah... That was a weird dream.' Then go into work late and get

Ah, but Zion has been destroyed.

But at the very end, Neo stops the machines with his hands outside the 
Matrix... so maybe Zion was just another level of Matrix?  And never
really 
existed either?

Is there any real reality?  Or is it just one matrix layered on top of

Subject: RE: [sfraves] nrr: the matrix [with MAJOR spoilers, people, read with caution]

I thought the implication wasn't that Zion was destroyed, but that the
line of defenses had begun to fall... the ships were being destroyed,
but that Zion was still momentarily alive...

I also thought that Neo stopping the machines wasn't indicative of
another Matrix... rather, I thought that his returning to The Source
[code], where he met the Architect, somehow transferred upon him an
understanding and at least partial control over the machines in the real
world.  You'll note that Neo couldn't stop the bomb that destroyed the
Nebuchadnezzar. The bomb, I'd assume, had no 'program' that Neo could
manipulate, just a fuse.  The squiddys, though, are linked to the
Mainframe, and so somehow Neo had a way to link with their programming
and make them go haywire... though, the exertion needed to make this
link seems to have damaged Neo, indicating again that it isn't just
'another Matrix' in my mind.  

Gah

I need to see Revolutions...

Yeah, animatrix is gooooood.  Glad to hear its going to have a
depressing ending.  I don't think much in the way of plant life would be
up on the surface without the sun.  I really wonder how they pull off
the whole oxygen thing.  Maybe water plants?  If the machines haven't
destroyed the water too for cooling reactors or something.  I would love
to see a complete Primitivism aspect to the movie.  Maybe everyone dying
or ahem.... Adam and Eve? ;)

Saw the matrix last nite. Loved it! It's a total Mindf**k with a whole lot

TWO YEARS AND RUNNING
-------------------------------------------------------------
Tuesday, June 3rd, 2003
9:30pm, $7
Julip: 839 Geary (between Hyde and Larkin)

u.t.r.// 2 year anniversary event

DAT POLITICS:
Dat politics flash by the way of music but also texts some pixellised and 
pop snapshot focused on failed flirt and gastronomy, After work with 
innovative  and respectable labels as A-musik, Mille Plateaux, Skipp or 
Tigerbeat6, now the laptop-band collaborates with the electro-trash label 
from the Berlin-based trio Chicks On Speed to diffuse their domestic and 
terribly exotic new sonic adventures.

BLEVIN BLECHDOM:
Blevin Blectum - nee Bevin Kelley - one-third of Sagan, ex-d84 and formerly 
50% of Blectum From Blechdom. Currently Blevin plays solo and in Sagan (with 
fellow musician J Lesser and video artist Ryan Junell). Her first solo CD 
was released on Phthalo in 1999. Her second solo CD Talon Slalom was 
released May 2002 on Seattle's Deluxe Records. She makes electronic music 
with samplers and computers mostly.

LESSER:
Starting off with the templates of drum and bass but tweeking them beyond 
recognition, Lesser's music delivers crunchy snares and overdriven bass 
frequencies with a heaping helping of skeptical humor, gritty digital noise, 
and DIY instrument-building ingenuity. Soldering together new instruments 
out of the refuse of 80's mixers and synths, J Lesser avoids the standard 
sounds and strategies in favor of a confrontational, schizophrenic and often 
hilarious rethinking of conventional "intelligent: electronic dance music.

Lance Grabmiller
Born in Kansas City , Missouri in 1975. Studied viola, cello, alto 
saxophone, tenor saxophone and music composition (in that order) before 
putting all formal studies on hold with the discovery of his first four 
track tape recorder at the age of 14. Using various tapes, effects, objects, 
microphones, amplifiers, razor blades and any instruments that could be 
begged or borrowed, he created quite a din in the Midwest, most notably in 
his collaborations with Shannon Fields which included such bands as Alice's 
Offspring, Requiem (which included a revolving cast of dozens) and HSoA 
(with Martin Nieznanski), the last of which culminated in a gigantic 
performance noise nightmare that nearly destroyed the Gizmo in Galesburg, IL 
in 1994.

Co-organizer of the Under the Radar events.


DJ PERFORMANCES:

Wobbly:
Wobbly is a multi-talented artist who excels in music, painting, singing, 
writing, dancing and even woodworking. Once dubbed "Mr. High on Life", his 
colorful high energy is like electricity as it provokes intense emotion in 
his audience.

Wobbly is practical and youthful. He possesses charisma and magnetism. He's 
been a natural artist since early youth, but has restrained himself until 
recently, as his creative drive is pushing him to give to the world what 
lies inside of him. He developed himself as a portrait painter. This year, 
he's gone beyond that as he fulfills his philosophical nature in the avenue 
of music, writing and singing. He wants to live a long life and be creative. 
His fulfillment will not come until he's completed the full cycle of his 
inborn talent. His high creativity in all areas has funneled into music 
where he finds himself at this time, with his artistic ability as a painter 
having a profound effect. It appears as if his painting background shows up 
in his music as he paints pictures with his words. His broad background is 
embraced in his inspired voice.


Zygote:
Stephen Ruiz (aka Zygote) uses the mechanized process of electronic music 
production and combines the expression of complex human feelings to create 
sound art. The tools of his output are computers, tape recorders, wires and 
other conduits of noise. His sound transcends the inhuman element of 
"technologically enhanced" production methods so vital in the world of 
electronic music producers, and in it's place submits raw and unfiltered 
emotion. While exploring the idea of personal expression through the cold 
exterior of machines, he takes the concepts of compositional indeterminacy, 
generative music and evolving cellular automata and humanizes them. The end 
result is populist music of emotional depth that illicits response via 
technology. Having trained in percussion and guitar, his compositional 
methods are rooted in structured narrative that are constantly being mutated 
under the pressure of new forms of expression.

Stephen has releases on Under the Radar Records and Alectric Records 
(Canada) and is the founding organizer of The "Under the Radar" experimental 
music and video events in San Francisco.

i am not familiar with any of the folklore behind the titanic. i only know that is sunk. if you are refering to the possibility of one pretending to be another, i suppose that that is one example of how to adversely effect a situation. fortunately and unfortunately, there is pretty much nothing going on other than imagination in most situations, titanic backdrop or not. i just find it silly when there are so many followers of fiction when the truth is so much better. i mean, without the truth, there'd be no real love and no time for shopping. :)

Subject: RE: [sfraves] Re:nrr: the Music of the matrix

the track they played during the rave sequence [hey, it might as well
have been a rave... and one with a killer vibe, too!] was: Fluke - Zion
:)

given the title, I'd say it was done specifically for the film.

It's on the soundtrack [The Matrix Reloaded: The Album on the first disc
{out of two}], but unfortunately they cut out the cool drums from the
beginning almost entirely... I'd like to get the track from as soon as
the drums start until the song's actual end... ah, well... 

I just wanna know which of you lucky bastards got to be there during the
filming of that sequence, since it was done on the army base in
Alameda... I'm curious as to whether they had a real rave vibe during
filming, or if people just had to pretend to dance without any music
going.

Saw the matrix last nite. Loved it! It's a total Mindf**k with a whole
lot 
of spiritual analogies at least to me. I even got a little choked up in
one 
scene. I think someone posted about the "tribal dance party" scene.  I
want 
that soundtrack! is there a record out with that music?

A New Slice on Physics
Is the world we see trapped on a thin membrane separating us from vast other
realms? Some scientists say that would explain a lot.
By K.C. Cole
Times Staff Writer

May 17, 2003

Plato considered it first.

What if everything we hold dear is but a thin slice of some larger,
unreachable reality, like a flickering shadow cast on the craggy wall of a
cave? What if the moon and stars, your home, your thoughts, your cat, are
but projections on this wall - mere suggestions of unfathomable realms
beyond?

In the last few years, a mathematically rigorous version of Plato's
2,000-year-old thought experiment has been refashioning the way physicists
think about everything from subatomic particles to the Big Bang. The
universe we see, according to this scenario, is stuck on a thin membrane of
space-time embedded in a much larger cosmos. And our membrane may be only
one of many, all of which may warp, wiggle, connect and collide with one
another in as many as 10 dimensions. Physicists call this new frontier the
"brane world."

The idea could help solve a long list of outstanding mysteries. Among them:
What is the "dark matter" that seems to make up 90% of the universe? And why
is gravity trillions of times weaker than electromagnetism?

The revolution was set off in the mid-1990s when UC Santa Barbara physicist
Joe Polchinski determined through mathematics that branes were a surface to
which things attach, like hair to skin - except the "things" in this case
were the minuscule "strings" that may well be the fundamental ingredients of
the universe.

"I was just fiddling around with mathematics Within a week or two [other
physicists] had done things with it I hadn't envisioned. It was like taking
the stopper out of the dam. Things poured through."

Alan Guth of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, creator of the
currently accepted version of the Big Bang, said recently he felt a little
like Rip Van Winkle - picking up his head from a long sleep only to notice
that the landscape of physics he thought he knew had suddenly, drastically,
changed.

Stephen Hawking of the University of Cambridge, among others, envisions
brane worlds bubbling up out of the void, giving rise to whole new
universes. He ends his latest book, "The Universe in a Nutshell," with a
call to explore this "brane new world."

One might well wonder why such a seemingly bizarre concept has attracted so
many well-established physicists. The short answer is: desperation.

The laws of nature that describe the large-scale universe to an astonishing
degree of precision (Einstein's general relativity) are incompatible with
the laws that describe the small-scale universe with the same astonishing
exactness (quantum theory). This means either that one of these well-tested
theories is wrong (all but inconceivable) or that there is some larger, more
encompassing theory that somehow accommodates both.

To date, the only theory that comes close to marrying the two is "string
theory" - a mathematically elegant set of ideas that has swept the world of
physics over the last few decades. According to string theory, the basic
ingredients of the universe are not point-like particles, but tiny strings
vibrating in 10-dimensional space. Although still untested, string theory
has scored a spectacular series of theoretical successes, earning it an
ever-widening circle of admirers.

And yet string theory remains a realm apart from day-to-day physics - lovely
to behold but innately aloof.

For one thing, the strings are so small that it would take a particle
accelerator larger than the solar system to create the energies needed to
"see" them. This means, in effect, that strings can never be detected.

For another, the complex mathematics required to deal with the tortured
10-dimensional landscape is beyond the reach of most physicists.

Brane models change all that. Unlike in string theory, the extra dimensions
in brane worlds can be big, infinitely big. "It led to a whole new bunch of
possibilities that could be experimentally tested," said physicist Jim Cline
of McGill University in Montreal.

What's more, branes don't require the full range of mathematical tools
required for string theory, opening the door to new groups of scientists.
"You can use methods that are part and parcel of more traditional physics,"
said Columbia University physicist Brian Greene. "So a person who's not a
string theorist can jump into the field and make contributions."

This sense of promise was palpable last summer at the Aspen Center for
Physics, where string theorists and cosmologists - the scientists who study
the origin and structure of the universe - gathered for a workshop to
explore links between the smallest scales in the universe and the largest.
Brane scenarios popped up everywhere, enveloped in the thick fog of
uncertainty that clouds the birth of new worlds.

The setting was strangely church-like. The faithful sat in rows under spires
of white-barked aspens, their round leaves fluttering in the wind.

In front, a maestro in sneakers tapped out symbols on a blackboard, chalk
flying like fairy dust, black jeans covered in white handprints. There was
lots of talk about the infinite; lots of recitation and response. Everyone
strained to channel some larger reality through equations.

"Your bulk could contain many 3-branes," one physicist said.

"The 9-branes could still annihilate."

"I'm lost."

This was not your grandmother's physics. There were no objects in the usual
sense. No matter, no particles. Not even numbers. Only "instantons," "alpha
vacua" and multidimensional membranes wrapping around one another, traveling
down throats of black holes and bouncing back, transformed.

Even to physicists, much of this seems unbearably strange. But in physics,
strangeness comes with the territory. "When I first learned about quantum
physics as an undergraduate, it just about destroyed my mind," said Stanford
post-doctoral fellow Stephon Alexander. "And now, 12 years later, it's just
a tool."

There's actually nothing particularly new about the idea that space may
extend into unseen dimensions, or even that the world we know is somehow
trapped on a membrane.

Extra dimensions were such a hot topic in the 19th century that Victorian
schoolmaster Edwin Abbott wrote a famous science fiction novel, "Flatland,"
based on the notion that our limited perceptions prevented us from seeing
worlds existing right in front of our three-dimensional noses. Albert
Einstein made extra dimensions an integral part of physics when he used a
fourth dimension, time, in his theory of relativity in 1905. Ten years
later, he showed that this interwoven fabric of space-time could warp under
the influence of massive objects - "causing" the force we know as gravity.

Extra-dimensional membranes were kicking around in string theory since at
least the mid-1980s, but no one took them very seriously. One of the first
suggestions that the world we know might be stuck to such a membrane
appeared in a 1985 paper that was a parody of string theory titled "The
Super G-String" by V. Gates, et al., from the University of Cauliflower
(actually, physicist Warren Siegel of State University of New York, Stony
Brook). "It was based on a serious paper that was totally overlooked because
it was before its time," Polchinski said.

The branes playing such a large role in physics today are richer and more
mathematically rigorous than early versions.

Essentially, a brane is a discontinuity in space-time, a boundary where
things meet, like the surface of a pond where the water meets the sky.

"It's a defect in the quantum fabric," said Ruth Gregory of the University
of Durham in Britain. On one side of the defect would be the vacuum of empty
space. A vacuum with somewhat different properties might exist on the other
side.

Imagine our brane as pond scum - a thin film that divides the air above from
a deep (perhaps infinitely deep) body of water below. Most of what we
experience is trapped in the scum. But beyond is a whole other world of
currents swirling beneath the surface. Their motion might tug on our scum.
We'd feel it as nothing but a gentle disturbance, never dreaming of what
lurks below.

A brane doesn't always divide one thing from another. It may just be a
condensation of stuff, "a localized lump of energy and curvature that likes
to hang together," Stanford University physicist Steve Shenker said.

Either way, it's a place where things get stuck - like the scum on the pond.
"That was the revolution," said Harvard University physicist Lisa Randall.
"To realize that branes were honest-to-goodness objects."

Randall played a pivotal role in the revolution when she and Johns Hopkins
University physicist Raman Sundrum realized that branes could be infinitely
large and yet remain invisible.

The reason: We can't see anything outside our brane, because light can't
escape or enter it. We can't hear anything outside, because sound travels
through matter, and matter is stuck to our brane. We can't use radioactivity
to sense what's beyond, or even break through with nuclear bombs, because
nuclear forces are also firmly nailed to our brane. There could be a big
blue elephant sitting not a millimeter away in another dimension, but we
wouldn't know it's there because everything we use to "see" is stuck to our
brane.

Only gravity can't be glued to a particular brane. Gravity, as Einstein
revealed, is the curving of space-time itself, so it wanders willy-nilly
where it will, leaking off our brane into what physicists call "the bulk" -
the rest of space-time.

Brane scenarios offer an elegant explanation for why gravity is such a
weakling: Maybe it's not any weaker than the other forces. Maybe it's just
concentrated somewhere else in the bulk, or on another brane.

Explaining the wimpiness of gravity is but a taste of what this Brane New
World might do.

Consider another embarrassing problem that has stumped astronomers for
decades. At least 90% of the matter in the universe is AWOL. Or more
precisely, it is known to exist because of its gravitational pull (without
it, galaxies wouldn't hold together) but can't be detected by any other
means. The standard approach has been to populate the universe with exotic
new forms of matter, too elusive to be readily seen.

If our brane is but a small slice of a much larger cosmos, however, the
"dark matter" might be nothing but ordinary matter trapped on another brane.

Such a shadow world, Hawking speculates, might contain "shadow human beings
wondering about the mass that seems to be missing from their world."

Or take the mystery of why elementary particles always appear in triplets,
each set heavier than the next.

One possibility is that each triplet is the same particle repeating itself
on three layers of branes. They would have different masses on our brane for
the same reason as shadows on a wall can be different sizes depending on the
distance of the object that casts them.

"One of the neat things about the whole extra-dimensional idea," Polchinski
said, "is that all the physics that we see - all the kinds of particles and
their detailed properties - are reflections of some inner geometry."

As in real estate, value depends on location, location, location.

The physicists most entranced with brane worlds are cosmologists. Over the
last decade, a new array of telescopes and satellites has provided them with
sophisticated tools for taking the measure of the universe. What was once
little more than navel gazing is fast becoming a data-drenched science.

But cosmologists need string theory to understand the origin of the
universe, because laws of physics break down at the tiny distances and
immense gravity at play in the Big Bang. For now, cosmologists can see back
in time only so far, and no farther.

Consider the Big Bang. According to current theory, the universe sprang from
an infinitely small speck of space-time known as a "singularity" - a paradox
in the accepted laws of physics, which hold that nothing can be infinitely
small.

"A singularity is a euphemism for: 'Things have gone haywire Things make no
sense,' " said Greene, one of the coordinators of the Aspen workshop. "The
Big Bang singularity is an 'It doesn't make sense' on the most important
problem - namely, how did it all begin."

Branes can enclose the Big Bang singularity like a sheet of cellophane -
avoiding the problem of the infinitely small by giving the singularity some
dimension.

Not surprisingly, the string-cosmology connection that brane worlds brought
about is also producing something of a culture clash. Until recently, string
theorists have remained skeptical of the grand theories of cosmologists.
String theory is mathematically rigorous. Cosmologists are a wilder bunch,
willing to try out almost any model of the universe and see where it leads.

"We know how branes work," said string theorist Nathan Seiberg of the
Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J. "We know what are properties
of branes, and what are not properties of branes. [Cosmologists] violate all
the rules. Is this good or bad? I'm not sure. Because if they come up with
something which violates the rules of string theory but does all sorts of
other wonderful things, then maybe we in string theory will have a
motivation to look into it."

Branes already have brought a whole new zoo of exotic species into the world
of physics. There are skinny branes and fat branes; empty branes and full;
active and still.

"A brane which is wiggling a lot would translate to a brane that has
excitations on it, particles on it," said McGill's Cline. That would be a
brane with atoms, forces, us. "But I could also have a cold brane," he said.
"That would be like a cold, empty universe. The brane still has some energy
density, but there's no particles living there."

And while the term brane derives from membrane - a two-dimensional surface -
branes could also exist in every possible dimension. A string is a
"1-brane," for one-dimensional object. Brane worlds (like the one we might
live in) must by necessity be "3 plus 1" branes - three dimensions of space
plus one of time. But you can just as easily have a pair of 10-dimensional
branes bounding an 11-dimensional universe.

For now, no one knows whether the building blocks of the ultimate theory
will be strings or branes. "You can't really say," Polchinski said. "It's
kind of Zen-like, but in a very precise way."

Ultimately, brane worlds will stand or fall, like all science, on the twin
tests of consistency and experiment. Whatever bizarre brane worlds may exist
in some larger dimensional landscape, they can't change what we perceive.
The stars can't slip off into hyperspace. The cat can't be disturbed from
the couch. Physics has to answer to nature as we know it.

Experimental evidence could come in the next decade from two very different
realms. A new particle collider under construction in Europe could reach
high-enough energies to produce, say, a five-dimensional "particle" of
gravity - a telltale sign of brane worlds beyond. This particle might be
detected as energy missing from a collision because it "leaks" into an extra
dimension.

At the same time, cosmologists are figuring out ways to read the signature
of extra dimensions in the microwaves that pervade space as the afterglow of
the Big Bang; the effects would be subtle but detectable, with a new
generation of satellites.

"We just have to keep hoping that nature will be kind," Cline said.

In the end, there's always the chance that all these ideas will turn out to
be too, well, off-the-wall. "Who knows?" said University of Chicago
physicist Sean Carroll. But even if brane worlds aren't real, Carroll said,
"they will have taught us a useful lesson that we should have known all
along, which is that we don't have a clue to what's going on."

Polchinski, for one, believes that branes are probably real, even though he
isn't sure where the idea will lead. "It's possible that nature doesn't work
that way," he said. "But it's so rich with possibilities, if it's not good
for this, it's probably good for something else."

Well, not actually NOW.  He's still on his way to the studio, but he'll
be here shortly to bring you more tasty booty shaking beats.  We're
already in the process of warming up the decks for him, so do tune in.
90.1 FM, or http://kzsulive.stanford.edu

Peace.

Subject: [sfraves] People doing strange things with electricity 

 For anyone thats into making and breaking stuff,
dorkbot is happening again on June 4th. 

Here is the link
 http://dorkbot.org/dorkbotsf/

Here is the content

Tim Thompson - Key Kit: Happy Feet, Joy Balls, and
other Tune Toys 
Wireless joysticks, playstation dance pads, and
webcams are the devices that Tim Thompson has been
using lately to control his algorithmic music toys -
all developed using KeyKit, a freely-available
programming language designed for realtime MIDI
experimentation. A multi-window GUI with pull-off
menus and buttons was written using the language
itself, making it uniquely extensible. This talk will
demonstrate KeyKit using Tim's recent explorations and
musical toys. 

Tim Thompson is a software developer and musician who
has been developing and using KeyKit for more than 17
years. His website has a variety of interactive
web-based music toys which use KeyKit for their
processing. 
http://nosuch.com 

Dan Bornstein - A Little Bit About The Hiptop 
Danger makes a mobile communications platform known as
the "hiptop" which is currently incarnated as the
Sidekick, a handheld device that is both a cellphone
and internet appliance. 

Dan Bornstein works on the software that runs inside
the device, and he'll describe the system in general
and talk about the programming model and relatively
new developer program, and he will be happy to at
least take a stab at answering questions you might
have about the device. 
http://danger.com 

Dr. Aaron Wolf Baum aka Dr. Friendly 
Doctor Friendly will present a rocket-powered overview
of complexity and artificial life and how they relate
to love and art. This segue into a performance with
intelligent live self-generating graphics and sound,
followed by unstructured organism-audience
interaction. 

In 1981 the twelve-year old future Dr. Aaron Wolf
Baum, now Dr. Friendly, read astronomy textbooks,
programmed TRS-80s, wrote poetry, and wandered in the
woods.Next came a career in physics, culminating in a
Ph.D. from Stanford and a job in Silicon Valley
commercializing a technology he had pioneered. His
artistic vision was first realized in the Nebulous
Entity which irradiated the 1999 Burning Man festival.
Since March 2000 he has worked exclusively on
programmed sensory environment-instruments and science
fiction myth-making.

I saw dj rap at 1015 waaaay back when Learning Curve came out. Nothing quite
like seeing her in a white halter top, sweating like mad and leaving nothing
for my imagination. It was a live set promoting that cd which was
interesting to see. Can't say I've ever heard her dj really, but she can
sing quite well live.

Subject: [sfraves] RAVE Act Protests Nationwide This Weekend

--=====================_2195537==_.ALT
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"; format=flowed

Have you ever wanted to dance for a good cause?  Here's your chance.  On 
Saturday, May 31, protest gatherings will be held in cities across the 
country to call for repeal of the RAVE Act.  Click here to find a protest 
near you.  http://actioncenter.drugpolicy.org/ctt.asp?u=488&l=1849

A lot of you out there know what it takes to throw a good party - 
promotion, DJs or a band, a sound system, and a big crowd.  The same can be 
said for a good protest.  Help us make these events a success by showing 
up.  If you can't be at one of the protests on May 31, please donate today 
so that we can make sure these events make the biggest impact possible on 
Congress and the White House.

And to make sure our message is heard loud and clear in Washington, DC, do 
us a favor and call your Representatives and Senators to let them know 
about the protest.  To find out who your federal legislators are, use our 
legislative directory 
http://actioncenter.drugpolicy.org/ctt.asp?u=488&l=1850. Tell your Members 
of Congress that you support the protests against the RAVE Act occurring 
around the country on May 31st. Tell them the RAVE Act was passed without 
debate and without a full vote of Congress, that it violates fundamental 
civil liberties and that you want it repealed or amended to protect 
innocent business owners, public health, and free speech.

Because of you, the campaign to repeal the RAVE Act is growing.  Together 
we've raised nearly $16,000 on-line for our efforts.  However, that will 
only go so far in what's sure to be a long fight.  If you haven't already 
given to this effort, please do so now.

Like we said in our last e-mail about the RAVE Act:  If you're willing to 
shell out $10 to see your favorite band or listen to your favorite DJ, will 
you give $10 to protect the scene from this outrageous law? If you can give 
more, please do so. Please give at: 
http://actioncenter.drugpolicy.org/ctt.asp?u=488&l=1851

The Drug Policy Alliance is reaching hundreds of thousands of people with 
our campaign.  Since the RAVE Act was signed into law in April, we've:

-- Placed a print ad in an industry magazine that reaches 50,000 people;

-- Generated commentaries and news stories in Rolling Stone, Billboard 
Magazine, Circuit Noize, the Washington Blade, Newsweek, 
http://actioncenter.drugpolicy.org/ctt.asp?u=488&l=1853 the Miami Herald, 
and newspapers across the country through the Associated Press; and

-- Urged voters to call their Members of Congress on dozens of radio shows 
from California to New York.

We are working in coalition to repeal the law and we expect to get a bill 
introduced soon.  We are working to make the RAVE Act an issue in the next 
election and we are acting as a watchdog to ensure that the DEA and others 
will not trample on the rights of electronic dance fans.  Drug Policy 
Alliance is also working overtime to strip provisions from a House bill 
known as the CLEAN-UP Act that will destroy live music if passed.

Thanks for your hard work for this effort.  Please attend the protests, 
call your representatives, send a 
donation  http://actioncenter.drugpolicy.org/ctt.asp?u=488&l=1852 and keep 
spreading the word.

We would like to give a very special thank you to the groups that have made 
these protests possible, including the Northwest Late Night Coalition, 
DANCEmusic, the Culture Defense Project, and ROAR!: The National Dance and 
Music Rights Alliance.


Sincerely,

Bill Piper
Associate Director of National Affairs
Drug Policy Alliance

Ravers hit in 'E' bust
BY J.K. DINEEN
Of The Examiner Staff

     In the biggest local rave extravaganza since two died and four were 
hospitalized from ecstasy overdoses at the Cow Palace in January, 10,000 
glow-stick waving ravers sweated it out Saturday night at the San Francisco 
Concourse Exhibition Center.

     But last weekend the ravers had a few unexpected guests as well: 40 
undercover state and local narcotics cops who were kept busy throughout the 
night, arresting 41 ecstasy dealers and netting more than 1,000 pills.

     Even though police made constant busts in the middle of the vast 
pulsating party, billed as "Popsicle 5," ecstasy dealers continued to 
accommodate undercover narcs with brown "Mickey Mouse" pills and blue 
"dolphin" pills.

     "You would think that making so many buys, the word would get out and 
dealers would have slowed down, but I guess nothing was going to deter 
them," said Paul Mulligan, special agent in charge of the San Francisco 
office of the Bureau of Narcotic Enforcement.

     Although the party was "over 18," five of those either arrested or 
cited were juveniles, according to Capt. Tim Hettrich, who heads up vice 
and narcotics. Two young women at the party were taken away in ambulances, 
Hettrich said.

     "There may have been 500 or 600 juveniles in this place," said Hettrich.

     The Popsicle 5 drug sting was funded in part by a federal grant 
focusing on "high intensity drug trafficking areas" and was the first in a 
string of operations that will target raves. The program was prompted by an 
increase of ecstasy overdoses throughout the country, Hettrich said.

     Few of those arrested were San Francisco residents and only one had a 
previous arrest here. Most were from the South Bay, the East Bay and the 
Sacramento area. Ravers ranged from 18 to 25 years old; a large percentage 
were Vietnamese and Cambodian.

     Cops who participated in the raid say at least 80 percent were on 
ecstasy. Partiers sat in circles on the floor, taking turns making circular 
motions with their glow sticks. Bottled water -- at $4 a pop -- was 
ubiquitous as were the pacifiers that prevent trippers from the 
teeth-grinding that is a side-effect of the drug.

     Ecstasy produces some of the speedy effects of methamphetamines as 
well as hallucinations similar to mescaline, but milder. While many young 
people see ecstasy as a euphoric party drug, it disrupts both body 
temperature and cardiovascular system and can lead to hypertension, 
hyperthermia, heart and kidney failure. Research has also linked long-term 
use to problems with memory and cognition.

     "Anyone who says we are targeting a specific community is wrong -- we 
are targeting drug dealers," said Hettrich. "We are protecting these kids 
from themselves. They don't think so, but when you have kids overdosing all 
over the country from this stuff, their parents will be glad we are there."

     The raid prompted complaints form the San Francisco Late Night 
Coalition, according to Assemblyman Mark Leno and Supervisor Bevan Dufty. 
Both politicians say they received a call about police tactics and are 
still looking into the matter. The Late Night Coalition did not return 
several calls requesting comment.

     Popsicle 5 promoters "Mars, Mystre, and Dyloot" could not be reached 
for comment. A message on the promoters phone says, "Hey everyone, thanks 
for coming out to Popsicle 5 -- it was a wonderful event and hopefully you 
had a wonderful time."

     A veteran city DJ promoter called the event "a cheesy rave with 
horrible, horrible music catering to tweaked out kids" who can't get into 
over-21 clubs. He said Saturday's extravaganza drew a similar crowd as the 
January Cow Palace rave.

     "There is real danger, and real drug abuse in these," he said.

Sometimes truth is loud, and the other times it is very silent, but no
matter what the truth brings, it is always accompanied by a quiet pain.

I'd say it's sadder to see the article target vietnamese and cambodians. If
I summized the article it would be:

'A large percentage of the 10,000 ravers were underage vietnamese and
cambodians on ecstacy."

some things that i find interesting about this article are:


>January, 10,000 glow-stick waving ravers sweated it out Saturday night at 
>the San Francisco Concourse Exhibition Center.


actually, Skills did post up a "no glowstick" policy well before this event 
occurred.  i'm pretty sure that if they found them on you as you entered, 
they took them away.   i was at Popsicle, and i have to say that was the 
least amount of glowsticks i've seen at a massive in a long, long time.  and 
while plenty glowsticks did get in the party...i'm sure there were not 
10,000 pairs.

may have been.  with no data to back it up.


>Bay and the Sacramento area. Ravers ranged from 18 to 25 years old; a large 
>percentage were Vietnamese and Cambodian.


nope.  absolutely wrong.  i was at the party so therefore ravers ranged from 
18 to 27, baby!  =P

and what's up with the "large percentage were Vietnamese and Cambodian"?  
did they actually survey the audience?  and large percentage in comparison 
to what?  does that mean 5%?  50%?


>     Cops who participated in the raid say at least 80 percent were on 
>ecstasy.

the cops would say something like that.

I hate the fact that people look at these things
convinced that obviousely all raving promotes drug use
and that all ravers don't know how to take care of
themselves, when in reality usually people who go to
massives aren't really seasoned ravers and only go
because of how glorified they think raving is...

I'm glad, I think this article is 100% accurate. No more massives I say,
they aren't needed.
I personally like the UG crowds and parties allot more than the 10k people
that would
be attracted to a skills event. Looks like maybe skills might have made them
selves the
first target of the rave act.

My *dickhead post of the day*

If it weren't for massives you wouldn't have the crap being skimmed off the
top of this *scene* Massives draw the crap to the surface and allow you to
hold a ug event with less filler and all tastey meat. Nothing but giant
filtration systems for the party world. Yes I do feel that massives attract
a shitty crowd full of people there to get fucked up on drugs. It's not
about the music for the masses there. It's about how hard you're rolling...

I'm glad, I think this article is 100% accurate. No more massives I say,
they aren't needed.
I personally like the UG crowds and parties allot more than the 10k people
that would
be attracted to a skills event. Looks like maybe skills might have made them
selves the
first target of the rave act.

If it were for massives to begin with parties would of never had the
attention they do now. I hate having to jump through hoops
just cuz my event is classified a "rave". Most cops around the bay area
don't even have a problem with the small events, they show
up to almost like every party I go to now days and they end up leaving. Oh
well, no point in arguing..

hey deepfog, 

funny, I was in the airport last weekend and saw a
cover story in Scientific American (I think???) about
the probability of there being multiple universe
interwoven.  i had a feeling that would be of interest
to you.

I hope they make it public when they find the one
where the DMT gnomes live, because I have a bone to
pick with    those little bastards.

peace,

Hmmmm I don't really like the brane theories as of
yet-

Sure they make some math easier, and purport to solve
some apparent paradoxes;
But...
It does so in a much-harder-to-grasp way-
and it's a little too convenient-

Like- for the singularity paradox-
Brane theory solves that by moving the singularity to
a brane? Thereby uhm- not really making it a
singularity anymore?

Come on- saying that a singularity was just made of
"magic goo" is just as plausible...

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Ravers hit in 'E' bust:  This Morning's Examiner - nrr

I was pretty disappointed by Popsikle this time, myself.  And I'll probably be
looking for another party more along the lines of Amalgamation next time arond
(hint, hint: Ryan).  I can guaran-fucking-tee you that this article is NOT
"100% accurate".  The pigs' lies jumpped right out at me, just from skimming
it.

First off. bottles water was *NOT* $4.  Whatever problems Skills may have,
they're NOT coolworld.  Water was $2 for a bottle.  And they had free cupped
water from coolers (those big things witn the 5-gallon bottles) scattered
throughout the venue, which they KEPT FULL.  And they kept all the water
fountains and sinks turned on too.

> 10,000 glow-stick waving

As others have mentioned Skills was not allowing glowsticks... something which
I found annoting, considering that the ACLU *DID* already slap the pigs down on
the paraphanelia thing in federal court after the New Orleans incident.  I
think it's very important to never give an inch after we win these victories,
no matter how small.  Jason and Tom apparantly don't.  That's their choice. 
But glowsticks WERE disallowed.  Some got through security; but not enough for
10K people to be waving them.

> ecstasy dealers continued to accommodate undercover narcs with brown
> "Mickey Mouse" pills and blue "dolphin" pills.

The mice must be new.  But considering that you have to go all the way back to
october of LAST YEAR:

http://www.dancesafe.org/labtesting/pill-display.php?keywords=dolphin&color_id=&limit=25

... to a batch of Blue Dolphins that have ANY Ecstasy, and even THOSE were
fake: adulterated with caffeine; I call bullshit; and say that no, the "ecstasy
dealers" were NOT accomidating.  Sorry, but gas chromatography doesn't lie, the
cops do.  Bad piggie... no doughnut for you.

> "There may have been 500 or 600 juveniles in this place," said Hettrich.

Maybe... but did they card all thede people they CLAIM were underage, or did
they just make this number up.  Even if this accurate, this means, more than
anything else, that there are just people out there selling REALLY good fake
IDs; something that has nothing to do with the party.  The people checking IDs
at the gate were useing those readers that scan the mag-stripe when you swipe
the license.  Those are KINDA hard to fake.

> Ravers ranged from 18 to 25 years old

Another lie.  I was there.  I'm 27.  I think another poster on SFRaves
mentioned the same.  Oh, and if there were 500 or 600 juviniles there, how did
they become "18 to 25 years old" within a few paragraphs?

> a large percentage were Vietnamese and Cambodian.

Ahh... *NOW* the cops finally show their true colors...  It's not the poor
white kids who are at fault.  They're being corrupted by those dirty gooks.

> At least 80 percent were on ecstasy.

Bull... Fucking... Shit...  Even at E-parties I've been to at peoples' houses;
where the whole POINT was to get of people together to do E, I don't think I've
ever been in any one place where 80% were rolling.  Given the proportion of
fake bills that were going around at Popsikle, I don't think 80% of the people
could be have been rolling if they WANTED to.

> Partiers sat in circles on the floor, taking turns making circular
> motions with their glow sticks.

Uhh... well... yeah... it was so clausterphobic and hard to get around in there
(a genuine failing of Skills, this one) that, a number of times, I gave up
trying to get around and sat down in circles with people whilst sober.  Oh, and
there's the glowstick thing...

> Bottled water -- at $4 a pop

Pure, unadulterated, bullshit.  Nice one, mr piggie.

> was ubiquitous

It damn well BETTER have been, even if 100% had been dead SOBER.  You get
10,000 people into an enclosed area, get a good number of them dancing, and
you're gonna sweat away buckets just from standing around.  If you're dancing,
even moreso.  Ubiquitous is GOOD thing, no matter where you are.  Leave it to
the pigs to twist it around into something that's a problem.

> anyone who says we are targeting a specific community is wrong -- we
> are targeting drug dealers,

Bull... if that were true, why are you calling it the "RAVE Act" you
authoritarian motherfucker?

> We are protecting these kids from themselves.

Oh, now we're "kids" again, after you've already waffled from "500 to 600
juvaniles" to "Ravers ranged from 18 to 25 years old"???  Which is it?  Oh, and
by the way, I'm quite capable of looking after myself.  I don't need a
uniformed thug to play nanny for me.

> kids overdosing all over the country

Sigh... why lie when simple math can catch you in it?  Anyone with access to
the MSDS for MDMA (and therefore the LD50) could do some simple multiplication
and see that the only people likely to ever overdose on MDMA are dealers
swallowing their stash; a problem that's caused by the cops themselves.

> Popsicle 5 promoters "Mars, Mystre, and Dyloot"

Oh, Mars and Mystre are part of Skills now, eh?  That's news to me.  I thought
they ran their own production company, and record store, on the other side of
the bay... F-something...

> a cheesy rave

No arguement there.  Some of us LIKE cheese still, though.

> horrible, horrible music

Most of the MUSIC was pretty good.  The acoustics of the venus made much of it
sound absolutely horrible though.  The concourse was just NOT made to contain
six stages.  All the same DJs, at a better venue, even at the Bill Ghrahm,
would've made a good show.  But ugh... the concourse is just BAD...

> tweaked out kids

Oh, so first 80% was rolling, and now we're all tweakers?  Make up your damn
mind.

> who can't get into over-21 clubs

Or, people who CAN get into clubs, but don't want to because of exactly this
attitude.  The big reason I switched to raves, in the first place, was to get
away from the sleazy, eliteist, meat-market atmosphere propagated by clubs and
clubbers.

> drew a similar crowd as the January Cow Palace rave.

Eh... I know quite a few people, actually, who will happily go to a Skills
party, but will NOT support coolworld.

> "There is real danger

Oh, so more people died at Popsikle than at PNY, eh?  First I've heard. 
Strange that it hasn't been in the news or on any of the usual message boards.

> and real drug abuse in these," he said.

That's rich.  Compareing a rave to a club and citing "drug abuse" as a problem.
 Well, just what the *FUCK* do you think alcohol is, then?!?!?  If you want to
critisize the rave scene for being associated with Ecstasy, and be ANYTHING
other than a comple, total, 100% hipocrite, you have to do away with the (open
and enthuasticly sold) drugs (just STARTING with alcohol... don't forget things
like nicotine and caffeine as well.) in the club scene as well.  Otherwise,
you're just talking out of your ass.

Typical police propaganda.  It's totally dripping with lies.


cya,
john

I'm glad, I think this article is 100% accurate. No more massives I say,
they aren't needed.
I personally like the UG crowds and parties allot more than the 10k people
that would
be attracted to a skills event. Looks like maybe skills might have made them
selves the
first target of the rave act.

    Actually the way I interpreted the amber alert bill, the promoters of the 
party either have to know of the drugs or they have to have reason to know of 
the drugs. Now since skills did the responsible thing and concented to having 
undercover cops all over the party there who busted tons of dealers, you 
can't pin any legal fines or penalties on them. 
    I disagree about them saying 80% of people were on ecstacy at this party 
because I was there walking around all night, and I think after my years of 
experience in the scene I can tell who's is and who's not on ecstacy. I'd say it 
was more like 30% or 40% but as you know there is such a thing as a contact 
high, and I think that's what most of the kids on the floor doing light shows 
were experiencing. (in other words i think a lot of people "fake" being high, 
and have just as good a time) 
    I do agree with that the music got cheesy in the trance room, but I 
actually was filming this party and I can show you PROOF that about 95% of these 
kids were fucking LOVING this cheesy music, and although they might not be 
experiencing the same vibe and level of spiritual enjoyment that the rest of us get 
from our underground events, I have to stand my ground when I say I believe 
that these massives are slightly better for the kids than going to some 
meaningless pop concert or gangsta rap show or mosh-pitting rock show. It's a step in 
the right direction for the masses of american kids who would other-wise 
never even go to a rave or know what one was. 
    THINK ABOUT IT PEOPLE (and get your heads out of your asses)

How do you know that Skills gave consent for undercover agents?  An 
undercover officer/agent is just that, undercover.  They don't need permission or 
consent to somewhere and try to bust people or observe.  Undercover agents go to 
clubs/parties and purchase drugs and what not in order to get the club/event 
shut down.  Look into what happend at the Globe Theater in Loiusiana I believe.

 I'll be spinning some funky SF house and probably
some downtempo tonight at the
http://www.patisseriecafe.com (tonight, thursday),
which is right across from the cat club. They just
openned for dinner about 2 weeks ago, and the food is
fan-fucking-tastic. They have beer/wine and some vegan
dishes. A fine way to start your clubbing night if I
do say so myself.

how are you so sure that Skills "concented to having undercover cops all
over the place"? according to the article it was a "drug sting".

"The Popsicle 5 drug sting was funded in part by a federal grant
focusing on "high intensity drug trafficking areas" and was the first in a
string of operations that will target raves. The program was prompted by an
increase of ecstasy overdoses throughout the country, Hettrich said."

Yeah OK...

sfrp members have been busy (we have a lot of *hardcore* students in the
group that study their lives away). I feel something coming this summer.
Atleast I want to do something this summer because I'm feeling really
excited about summer two.kay.three! A campout would be damn nice or a few
outdoor parties...

I was pretty disappointed by Popsikle this time, myself.  And I'll probably

Subject: Re: [sfraves] BSP: ASR presents Gemini 05-31-03 :: !!GO!!

Free outdoor party this saturday night! For anyone that hasn't attended the
annual *Gemini* party that ASR puts on this is a must go. Always a good time
with good music (Jeremy wouldn't have it any other way). If you have another
party to hit up that night it most likely ends early (eg the party at "the
deli" in sf ends at 2am) and this part will only be 2 hours into things.
Come by and continue your evenings festivities under the warm night sky
we've been so fortunate to have had lately...

I'm bringing our house soundsystem out (swat.sound). For those that have
been to my houseparties you know what I'm talking about ;-)

As I recall this is the place that's kinda next door to S!tio (Incognita's
old home) Looked really nice and I drove by a few weeks back and saw a nice
crowd of people in there dancing. Not exactly what I expected from a
restraunt. Definately worth stopping by if you're in the area. I would say
the place has a lot of *charm* to it. Poly ain't too bad a guy either to
hear ;-)

I'll be spinning some funky SF house and probably
some downtempo tonight at the
http://www.patisseriecafe.com (tonight, thursday),
which is right across from the cat club. They just
openned for dinner about 2 weeks ago, and the food is
fan-fucking-tastic. They have beer/wine and some vegan
dishes. A fine way to start your clubbing night if I
do say so myself.

well, it tastes like grass, it smells like grass, and
it sure looks like grass. (I suppose it could be
banana peels.)

Free outdoor party this saturday night! For anyone that hasn't attended the
annual *Gemini* party that ASR puts on this is a must go. Always a good time
with good music (Jeremy wouldn't have it any other way). If you have another
party to hit up that night it most likely ends early (eg the party at "the
deli" in sf ends at 2am) and this part will only be 2 hours into things.
Come by and continue your evenings festivities under the warm night sky
we've been so fortunate to have had lately...

I'm bringing our house soundsystem out (swat.sound). For those that have
been to my houseparties you know what I'm talking about ;-)

This is a quote from someone I know and these were his thoughts on White
Castle hamburgers, which I have only gotten to ever try out of a vending
machine, but took one bite and threw them away because they had onions on
them.

I don't like onions very much, especially dried out ones.

Dude! the examiner is a RAG! I wish I could say that is like the worst reporting I have ever read, unfortunately, the metro is even worse, stupid media. I wish I could blame the Monopolies, but I can't do that either. Our press in this country is in a sad, sad, sad, state if this passes for Journalisim, its worse than Fox News! Simpsons=Good Fox News=Bad! DIE DIE DIE! 
Anyway, I love my Congressperson Pete Stark BOOYAA! Join the Aclu! They will tellyou whats up! I havent gotten a damn thing done today so I am gonna skip goin out tonight. Mabe I should get ajob at Taco Bell, at least I would have some MONEY. The taco bell in Fremont here has the nicest, smartest little middle aged indian and hispanic ladies I love it. It's not even like a Taco bell its like grandmas. BA! ADD ADD ADD POWER HEy BUSH! Give me my damn medicine! Stupid drug companies. Stupid uncontrolled free market. Stupid stars. I gotta be old to get my drugs dammit. I'm gonna go be a hobo.

from this article I learned:

There were 10,000 people at the party
8,000 people were high on E
10,000 people had glowsticks
They captured 12% of all the E
There were no overdoses.

What's the problem again?

you're a week too late my friend. Last week the nation had monday off and
thus sunday was saturday part II. This weekend there is a great outdoor ASR
party on saturday night. I'll say go to that, but sunday is a complete loss
on the ug side of things. Damn that whole monday-gotta-work thing.

Oh hell yeah! This is what I've been wanting! ASR throws the sickest
parties. Cool peeps, great vibes, if you only go to one outdoor party this
summer, make this the one. I hope to meet a lot of new people that night, so
come out and enjoy the best of what the Bay Area underground scene has to
offer.

Happy  :-)

well, i'm digging deep here today, i hope this is entertaining enough for you.  

are you ready?  

you sure?  

well ... 

here is your "polygamy quote of the day" (there really is a website for this) (this is proof, btw, that there really is something for everyone on the 
internet)

i'm sure after reading this you will be truly inspired (and be happy you don't live in the 13th century.)  now go back to bed.  it's friday.

"Besides the Europeans and natives, there was the scattered Dutch population. Natives and Dutch were not prepared to receive the Catholic faith. 
Among the former, superstitions, a sickening immorality, and polygamy, and among the latter, prejudices, and hatred against the Church of Rome, 
rendered for many years all the efforts of the missionaries apparently fruitless."

"KID LAW CAUSES CONCERT TROUBLE

Amber Alert Holds Liability Surprise

A new law slipped into last month's Amber Alert bill is threatening
concert promoters and club owners in Denver with huge civil and criminal
liability.

As a result, KTCL's Rave on the Rocks, one of the highest-profile
electronic music shows in the nation, is on shaky legal ground.

What used to be called the RAVE Act was renamed the Illicit Drug
Anti-Proliferation Act of 2003.  The bill is similar to legislation that
made it possible for cities to shut down crack houses as public nuisances.

The difference here is that a concert promoter or club owner could be
liable - - and could have the club seized in some cases - for criminal
activity at a show, including drunkenness, drug use or fistfights.  Under
the law, the promoter could be criminally liable for any illegal act by
anyone in the crowd.

Sponsored by Sen.  Joseph Biden, D-Del., the law was tacked on to the
Amber Alert bill by a subcommittee.  To stop the RAVE Act from passing,
legislators would have had to vote against the larger bill to help find
missing children.

Rep.  Diana DeGette, D-Colo., went on Denver radio this week and said "she
does not support the RAVE Act and was disappointed that the RAVE Act was
rolled into that, especially at the last minute with so little opportunity
for consideration," said her spokesman, Josh Freed.

Some Denver club bookers wouldn't even talk about the act, fearful of
drawing attention to electronic music in their clubs.

The name for KTCL's Rave on the Rocks is now up for a listener vote so as
to keep it out of the cross hairs of the new law.  Winning at the moment
is Party on the Rocks.

"We must adhere to the law, and we're going to do that," says Mike
O'Connor, KTCL program director.

"This event is nothing more than a typical concert at Red Rocks with one
difference: the instrument that's played involves mixing vinyl on
turntables as opposed to actually playing instruments."

"Short of strip-searching every patron, we have no idea if people are
going to slip something in and ruin it for the rest of us," O'Connor
continued.  "We have the same, if not more, security than for any other
Red Rocks event.  What we won't do is use the R-word.  The RAVE Act
definitely draws a distinction between a normal show and a performance
involving the R-word."

Actually, it doesn't, which opponents say is the problem.  The law is so
vague, said Bill Piper, associate director of national affairs for the
Drug Policy Alliance, that "it doesn't matter if you're playing electronic
music or hip-hop or jazz or any music.  It doesn't have to be a rave or a
music concert.  It could be a motel room, your home."

"The law is so neutral and so broad it would apply to any property and any
person controlling that property as an owner or event organizer," Piper
said.  "A lot of members ( of Congress ), we're finding, aren't even aware
of this provision."

Brandon Daviet of TuTone Entertainment is organizing a benefit concert
Friday at Cervantes Masterpiece Ballroom to help the Drug Policy Alliance
challenge the law.

"The law is unfair.  They can confiscate clubs for something that's not
their fault," he said.  "They snuck it through with no public hearings."

Rep.  Joel Hefley, R-Colo., who was a co-sponsor of the original Amber
Alert bill, was traveling in Prague, Czech Republic, and was unavailable
for comment...

Not that I want them to be arrested...  I thought that under this new rave 
act, that since there was E on the premisis and electronic music was 
playing, shouldn't the promoters be held liable?  I thought raves were 
officially dead by law?

hey i'm going to an east bay party but i live in the city.  does anyone know what would be cheaper: to split a room with my friend at a janky motel, or to split a cab back into s.f.?  we'd have to get pretty far into s.f. (ocean beach)  motels i thought would be between $20-$30 a person...not sure about cab fare, would they just end up being the same?  anyone who knows or has recommendations i would appreciate any advice. cheers all---bliss it out--- miss g

The fog rolls in, you know.  I hope the text is
aligned right)


Sometimes San Franciscos there--- other times its
not,
But when its there, its VERY there, and kids be
gettin hot.
Its scary when the barriers of consciousness are
dropped,
Awareness dares to test the snare where innocence is
caught.

So whats the point in sharing if youre barely
gettin squat?
And Gods a mighty bastard--- rarely spares you props.
Compare the air inside this room to what you done been
taught,
Declare your highest errors be a microscopic dot.

Its scary when your area is swarming with cops.
Its scary when your very prayer is buried on the
spot.
Its scary when your carelessness is married to a
thought,
like punch-drunk boxers swearing there, squaring for a
shot.

Its scary when the barriers of consciousness are
dropped--
The daring rise up carriers of everything thats not.
Sometimes San Franciscos there--- other times its
not.
But when its there, its VERY there, and chics be
gettin hot.

Shaolin Presents.Our BIGGEST party ever!

June 13, 2003

HIGH OCTANE <~~mini-MASSIVE

============================

 

LOCK N LOAD

The Lock N' Load project consists of two Dutch producers / DJs: Frank van Rooijen and Niels Pijpers. One fine day the Club Caviar boys came to visit the Lock N' Load studio, heard the old version of a song and offered to do a remix of it. In collaboration with Lock N' Load they delivered this stunning result and Niels decided to release "Blow Ya Mind". After all on Blue White Records, within a period of three weeks, it became the No. 1 club record in the Netherlands, and Europe followed soon after that, the United Kingdom was ready to be conquered. Through no. 1 positions in both the UK Club and UK Dance chart it had an amazing entry at 6. Help us welcome Lock N' Load to Sacramento.

Chris C.

Now firmly established as one of the Biggest and most popular DJ / Producers on the UK Hard House/NRG scene, Chris has masterminded the emergence and rapid success of his 3 Labels, Mohawk, Aztec and Nile. Positioning the former today as one of the genres top 5 marques. With over 30 single releases and 2 Albums to his name on various labels including Tidy Trax, Tinrib, Eve, Honeypot, Phoenix Rising, GBT, Bulletproof, etc...Chris' reputation as one of Britain's finest exponent of Hard House, both behind the decks and in the studio, continues to grow.

Whistler

Victor Cape a.k.a. Whistler shines as a highly respected DJ on the Pacific Northwest dance scene. Known for his tight mixing skills and uplifting personality behind the decks, Whistler blends energy and emotion from Hard Melodic Trance, Epic Anthems and Hard House to take his listeners on a dance floor rollercoaster ride. If being a DJ wasn't enough, he also manages Lovetribe which has quickly become one of the most well respected event productions in Seattle. It's been over a year and a half since Whistler's last performance in Northern California. So we're excited to bring him out for his first Sacramento performance!

Dragnfly Vs. Scepter

Shaolins two BIGGEST DJs go head to head to see who really is the SHAOLIN MASTER.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] oakland transport?

I was exploring the option of getting home from SF(I live in the east bay). 
I called a cab service and they told me 50-70 bucks.  Once I got to SF and 
was ready to go back home, the cab told me 150 bucks!  So luckily, my friend 
could give me a ride home.  It might be worth it to get a hotel, especially 
in the east bay, there are a lot of cheap places.

I've had to take a cab home from downtown SF to Oakland, and it usually cost
about $35. If you are going to an Oakland party, I would assume that it is
going past 2am, and probably all night, so why not just stay until BART
start running again? (http://www.transitinfo.org/BART/)

Subject: RE: [sfraves] oakland transport?

I suggest if you're anywhere near the airport, get a cab back into SF
there?  I think they have a $35 flat rate but that might only be to
downtown and not OB.  Depending on how late the party goes, cab to SF
(from the airport) then hop on the first N Judah out to OB.  Best place
to pick up the N without having to wait 30 or so minutes is Folsom and
Embarcadero.  A cab from anywhere else is going to cost you a hell of a
lot and a cheap motel split between two people would be much cheaper.

not quite..... the law says that promoters must reasonabaly know that there
will be drugs there.. and the state (and feds) wouldnt waste money on big
parties where everyone is searched before entereing... and where proper
permits are obtained.. they are going to go after the parties that I've been
to where I'm offered E by three diffrent people the second I get in..

Peace,

Subject: RE: [sfraves]How come skills hasn't been arrested?

Not necessarily true.  They took out the 'Ought to know' clause in the
final bill.  Unless any dealer was caught and said they were working in
conjunction with the promoters of the party or that the promoters knew
exactly who was doing it and still allowed it, then there should be
nothing thrown at Skills.  Its sounds like they made a concerted effort
to play by the rules, I wouldn't be surprised if the undercovers were
known to be there and were working with Skills.  If I was throwing a 10k
person party and knew about the law, I would be working with law
enforcement to play by the rules, an underground, probably not.  Not to
mention since there were 18unders sneaking in, well, I don't believe you
should expieriment with mind altering substances too much before your
body and mind has started slowing down on its physical growth.  When
you're that visible you have to do everything in your power to adhere to
the man so you don't get yourself and the owner of the venue who leased
it to you in trouble.  It means that you can't throw any parties anymore
and yer going to jail.  Obviously a lot of us aren't into massive's but
it doesn't mean people still don't go and that people still like to have
festivals with massloads of people be it for the money, or just the
sheer excitement of seeing thousands of people moving in unison or both.

Plus, with all those undercovers and off duty officers, who's left to
check on the underground. ;)

Just becuase the law is on the books, it does not mean they will use it
all the time.

I think what the Feds wanted this law becuase of the Crackhouse case they
brought against the New Orleans promoter failed miserably.

If there are re-occuring clubs with chronic drug problems, I fully expect
the feds to use the RAVE act.

And the fastest way to get the Feds attention is to start seeing kids in
emergency rooms from drug ODs.

I think if people continue to party smart and safely, they can stay under
the RAVE act radar.

At least, thats what I hope.

Subject: [sfraves] nrr: poem, "baby bird"

poem: baby bird
may 30, 2003

i was walking down
lighthouse avenue
when, in a moment,
i looked ahead
and saw a baby bird
lying on the concrete.

it was dead.

it lay there,
sprawled on the sidewalk,
naked of feathers,
bereft of its dignity,
lifeless and cold,
and i realized
that the baby bird's story
needed to be told.

i thought to myself,

"tiny little thing,
how did you come to be
so far from home?
you don't belong here,
lost and alone.

did no one ever tell you
that someday
you would have wings?
that you could fly away
and discover finer things?"

with a tear,
(and a napkin!)
i picked it up,
and moved it
over to the dirt,
and i hoped that
no one was around
to see my hurt.

"perhaps it's better
for you now," i thought.
"it's so hard to 
be a bird these days,
living in a world
that man made.

but,
on the other hand,
it is neither easy
to be a man.
so perhaps you can
forgive us.
we're doing
the best we can."

and with this thought,
my emotion gave release,
as i bid that bird,
"farewell.
may you rest in peace."

~sooz

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Ravers hit in 'E' bust:  This Morning's Examiner - nrr

The udercover feds are going after ecstasy dealers at massives.. what's the
problem here?????????? they didn't shut down the party.. they didn't go
after the promoters.. what are you complaining about here. the cops are well
in thier right to do what they did.... I'm soo tired of going to skills
parties and being run over by tweeked out cady kids.. and tripping over
light show pow-wows in the middle of the dance floor... GET DRUGS OUT OF THE
RAVE SCENE! I'm not afraid to say it.... If the "rave scene" doesnt wan't to
be targeted as a haven for drung use.. then why doesnt it speek out agianst
drung use at raves.... and if the scene supports ectasy.. then just say
it..... dont be passive agreesive about it saying "ohh the kids will just do
it anyway"... well you not telling them not to, your saying: well if you're
going to do it, do it at a rave...

I dont support it... raving is about music and people and DANCING.. not
about sitting on the dance floor in an E puddle. and if the cops want to
stop that with out making dancing illegal then more power to them...
according to this article they did just that...

SO.. all I'm saying is tell the truth.. be truthfull to your self.. don't
say "It's ok to do drugs at raves" and then turn around and say "why are
they targeting the rave scene for drung use"

and thats just about all I have to say about that.

Peace,
Mystic

Subject: [sfraves] NRR: Poetry day?  Ok 'If I were Robert Frost'

I used to be a rushing river
Crashing to and fro.
With twists and turns and gnarled rocks
Always on the go.

Rarely a moment of serenity
My life moved swiftly by..
Whirlpools and rapid falls
My shores were never dry.

Then some pesky farmers came
And set up a little dam.
They told me it was necessary
For the good of common man.

As time went by my waters slowed
The foam was all but gone
A comfortable pace I took in time
And flowed just right along.

But over time the farmers left
And the dam had been kept up
As debris and junk flowed along
And gradually got stuck.

What once was fast slowed to a crawl
Hope was all but gone.
My turbulence and beauty now
Were but a stagnant pond.

And now I lay here waiting
Dreaming of the day
When by luck or chance
The dam my stagnancy decay.

(on corporate america and growing up)

Subject: Re: [sfraves] oakland transport?

 I've always been hesitant to go to east bay at all,
because of bart stopping at midnight. Last week I got
stranded in Berkeley, and learned that AC Transit runs
to SF all night, once an hour. 
* AC TRANSIT RUNS ALL NIGHT * (no more excuses osby:P)
  
 It's about 3 bucks, when you get on a bus to get to
downtown Oakland, ask the driver for an SF fare, its
about 3$, and I think the SF bus picks you up at 14th
and Broadway.

Any promoter, and i do mean any promoter is subject to fines and possible arrest if they produce a party or event where drugs are rampant.
 
More so the venue of any establishment runs the risk of the same treatment and could possibly find themselves on a goverment black list.
 
And to answer the question of who pays for all this???? The promoter. Plain as day. For those that think the promoter doesnt know that there are under cover cops in the party, etc....welcome to reality.
 
The promoter is the person who is footed the bill at the end of the day for ALL POLICE services. 
 
I think it's childish to blame massive promoters, etc for all these drug & cop related problems. Massives is a word that was created in relation to big events. 
 
But in retrospect, these large music gatherings have been happening since before our scene even started. Before the Oakenfolds and Tiesto's, there was Jimi Hendrix & Janis Joplin and the promoters were Bill Graham & Kenny Fender.
 
They too were dealing with same politics and bullshit. There audiences were much like the people we see at parties today. Just a different time and erra, but there was still a major drug problem.
 
Large Festivals are not the problem. To blame skills or anybody else for the demise of our civil liberties is short sighted. But i guess easier then believing the problem is your girlfriend and her two best friends....

State trying to stem tide of plastic water bottles
Officials want to increase recycling rate
Jane Kay, Chronicle Environment Writer
Friday, May 30, 2003
2003 San Francisco Chronicle | Feedback


URL: http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2003/05/30/BA210518.DTL


Health-conscious Californians are consuming so much bottled water -- and 
just throwing away the plastic containers -- that state officials are 
warning that the trend threatens to clog landfills and harm the environment.

"It's common in California to see someone walking down the street with a 
water bottle in one hand and a cell phone in another," said Mark Oldfield, 
spokesman for the state Department of Conservation.

"The sales of single-serve water bottles and, in fact, all plastic 
containers, have been skyrocketing for the last five years. If they're not 
recycled, they're going to be around for a long, long time," Oldfield said.

The conservation department is launching a campaign to raise public 
awareness of the problem and convince consumers to do a better job of 
recycling. Separately, a bill recently introduced in the state Senate would 
improve the incentive for recycling by doubling the deposit.

California has one of the highest per capita rates of bottled water 
consumption in the United States, according to industry figures, although it 
trails behind European countries such as Italy and France.

But according to the state's report, only 16 percent of water bottles are 
being recycled, well below the overall container recycling rate of 60 
percent. The rest of the bottles -- more than 1 billion plastic containers a 
year -- are thrown away and end up in landfills.

In 10 years, the discarded bottles would be enough to create a two-lane, 6- 
inch-deep highway stretching the length of the 1,100-mile coast.

The water-guzzling public can change all that, says the report. If recycled,

the bottles can find life after death in carpets, soft foam, fiber-fill and 
clothing. Most water bottles are made of PET, or polyethylene terephthalate, 
the type of plastic that has the greatest recycled market value.

Coca-Cola and Pepsi, which distribute filtered municipal bottled water under 
the labels of Aquafina and Dasani, have asked for a greater amount of 
recycled raw materials to use in the production of new bottles. Coke is 
working toward its goal of using 10 percent recycled plastic in 25 percent 
of the bottles.

"There is a market for recycled PET in building materials and some clothing.

Recycled PET is a good, pure stream of raw material," said Bob Achermann, 
executive director of the California Nevada Soft Drink Association, which 
represents the major bottlers.

Achermann attributes the popularity of bottled water to its convenience. 
"I'm old enough to realize that people used to walk around without bottled 
water. We used to be camels before. Now we have to be hydrated."

Californians Against Waste, the lead environmental group lobbying for 
greater recycling, supports raising the deposit as a way to increase the 
state's overall container recycling rate. That rate fell from 78 percent in 
the mid-1990s to 60 percent in 2002.

Democratic Sens. Byron Sher of Palo Alto and John Burton of San Francisco, 
have introduced a bill that would double the deposit to 5 cents on 
containers less than 24 ounces. The deposit is returnable at reverse-vending 
machines and recycling centers.

The bottlers' association likes the part of the bill that changes the way 
its members pay a processing fee. But it opposes raising the redemption 
value. "If people want to raise (the deposit) to encourage recycling, we 
don't know if that will accomplish the task," said Achermann.

California's deposit is too low to create the proper incentive for 
recycling, according to the Container Recycling Institute in Arlington, Va., 
a group that analyzes success rates. To prove that a higher deposit works, 
the group points to Michigan, which puts a 10-cent deposit on carbonated 
beverages and has a 95 percent recycling rate.

"The saddest part about all of this," said Mark Murray, executive director 
of Californians Against Waste, "is that we should be cleaning up our water 
so people can just turn on the tap and they don't have to buy it."

i really hope everyone has a great party weekend. there are so many opportunities for you to have a great time without being lonely, bored or having not breathed in, inhaled, ingested or related to whatever you need to get you to that mental space that just takes you there...hell, maybe even doing something really co-dependent might attract just the thing you need to listen to that loud music without your earplugs on..maybe you are married...why not do a little bit of light outdoors, bring up the fear in your partner, might kind of increase your chance to up the birthrate at a cheaper cost than drugs. right on, america! hey, if your girl doesn't want to wed you, but you want her to without marrying her, .like you just need an ego stroke, but don't know how to get it, why not just bring out another date, invite her, scare them both with aids, and then have a child with someone else, and go to your grave telling yourself that life was just grand. right on! what is life and music without human toys. :)

Or, just bum a ride back into the city with someone.  I couldn't count how many

I'm pretty sure there's also a bus that runs over the bride 24/7 as well.

Subject: [sfraves] Need Known Djs For Portland OR July 4th show

I know there are some djs on these lists that are fairly well known and
hide behind aliases here so please if you would like to come up to
Portland shoot me an email. I am sorry this is not an open call for
up-and-comer's only established West Coast djs. I know there is a lot of
talent on these lists and soon we will have the chance to bring some of
you up here but unfortunately at this time we need a name that will draw
a crowd. And for any of you in the future who would like to come up here
email me and I will tell you where to send the CD. Peace

But see if anyone responds to your post between now and 4am tomorrow your

I think you're in need of more stimulation. I suggest lots of beer with some
porn playing in the background while you work. That always makes things
better. =)

yes indeedy. keep in mind that the rave act is
seriously questionable from a legal standpoint. the
last thing that the bullshit artists who put it
together need is to see some district judge throw out
a rave act prosecution citing any or all of the
numerous problems, both practical and constitutional,
with that particular law. it would only encourage the
ACLU to mount a serious opposition, and if there's any
law the ACLU could take down, among the blizzard of
bullshit laws we've had since Bush became "President,"
that's it. (the patriot act is even bigger bullshit,
but politically almost untouchable.)

so, because of this, imagine you're a Fed. you've got
this handy-dandy new law that sounds great but in
practice could easily explode in your face. so, where
do you use this law? in the single most liberal city
in the United States? or in some other place, like
Atlanta or Nashville, where the judges are less likely
to throw out your case?

Skills is safe, for now.

Subject: [sfraves] neobeatnik dot com goes THUD

to whom it may concern!

if you've been wondering what happened to all the new
music from me, well, I'm still making it, but my web
host is having issues from hell. I tried to upload a
bunch of tracks, a simple task that should have taken
four minutes, and I'm giving up after three &$@*%#!
days. the most I was able to do was get part of this
one online:

http://www.neobeatnik.com/richmond.mp3

actually it's almost the whole thing, the whole thing
was a big song tho. anyway, if you're wondering why
it's called "Richmond," it was part of a Bay Area
geography trio with two more songs called "Fremont"
and "Menlo Park." unfortunately neither of those two
survived the unusually harrowing upload process.

this is a plea out to the universal ruler: please don't make me. there's been plenty of that since before i was born. do i have to ask for the right to not have to? please don't make me..there, i begged, just in case i will be heard, and if not, i'll just keep my mind open to the possibility that there are actually a few healthy, kind minds floating around aimlessly who want total and complete revenge as much as i do. :)

Subject: [sfraves] Ranger on Patrol -  Saturday Events

Wassup party peoples

Tonight marks a new stage in my life.. my girlfriend turned 21 and now I can 
party like a rockstar again.

I am definitely going to Sen-Sei's Birthday bash with Jeno and sensei and 
Colemen  at Sno-Drift, the Orgy Crew's no cover party at the Shadow Lounge, 
Mark Farina at Ruby Skye, and Release at 1015 to see Eric Morillo (Ministry 
of Sound uk).

I am bringing three different outfits so don't expect to see me in the same 
gear twice.. hope to run into some peeps from the list (OSBY!!).

Have an incredible and safe night!

Ranger

subdued reassuring soothing tone

anyone have any idea???

thanks
