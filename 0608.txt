Direct from the horse's mouth:

...

Yes yes! The time has come to move to a venue a little more our speed: Darker, dirtier, grittier, louder, closer into the center of everything. Nickie's on Lower Haight is just the spot, and I've been eyeing it up and down for a while. So we snatched up Wednesdays really quickly, and we're running with it as hard as we can. And we just couldn't resist the name "Crooked," knowing the way things usually get at Nickie's. 

m.d.K, Erok, Marc(O) and I (the newly formed "Renegade Ferrets version 1.2") will be holding it down, bringing in very special guests from around the Bay and beyond every week. We go from 10pm 'til 2am at Nickie's, and, unfortunately, we can't keep the free door hook-ups that we used to have at @lpha - we've got to charge $3 at the door at Crooked. But come on, $3... that's less than the cost of a drink! And well worth it for the lineups we plan to put together on a weekly basis. 

For our premiere show, next week, August 9th, we're gonna kick it off with a lineup that's a bit of a preview of the type of night we want this to be every time (with an admitted bit of overkill on the numbers, since this one's special) - a few of our favorites all coming together for one wicked night of breaks: 

Kapt'n Kirk 
Ernie Trevino 
Ripple 
Satsi 
Evinrude 

So come out, have a drink with us, say hello, and help us usher in Crooked, a brand-new way to do Wednesday nights. 

Oh yeah, I almost forgot: 

GET BENT!!! 


Wednesday, August 9th 
CROOKED Premiere 
Nickie's BBQ 
460 Haight St. @ Fillmore, SF 
10pm-2am, $3, 21+ with ID

sorry to hear about your loss; i hope you find your records...
for future reference, it is commonly advised to call all major and local record stores that buy used music (rasputin, amoeba, etc...)
let them know the situation, along with some of the titles in your bag... if the thief is not wise and tries selling them, employees will be advised to make low-ball offers... you can then by back your music at a much-discounted price...
good luck...

Subject: [sfraves] stolen records
Date: Mon, 31 Jul 2006 11:43:14 -0700 (PDT)

hey guys,

friday night, word of mouth held a party in the
bayview area.  i'm tossing this request out to anyone
who might have attended, who might have seen something
- anything.  i was hoping after a couple days that i'd
hear word from someone that my bag was in a crew
member's car from strike and they just didn't see it,
but that hasn't happened.

my record bag is a black technics soft case with a
pair of silver sony's in the front pocket, and about
40 tech-house and breaks records with a few downtempo
in the front.  this soft case doesn't have any padding
- it looks more like a shoulder bag, and
on the front is technics written in white script.
it's also a little ripped up and abused but there are
no distinguishable stickers or writing on it.  this is
a small list of records that i can remember having in
there:

Alex Under - "Sorbere Cerebros EP"  [Trapez]
Ben-G - "Barnadango"  [Funkdango]
Jamie Anderson - "Counter Strike"  [Fixia]
Jake Childs & LBO - "Invisible Inc EP"  [Uniform
Black]
Chus Duran - "So Fresh"  [Funkdango]
Claude Young - "Electronic Dissident"  [Dust Science]
Bobby Peru - "Blood Money"  [2020 Vision]
Prefuse 73 - "92 Vs. 02 Collection" [Warp Records]
Tosca - "Dehli9" [K7]

it was in my back seat (i have a dark blue jetta with
a 'i hate your suv' sticker on the back). we arrived
at the loc. around 9:30pm to offload, and i'll be
honest - i didn't unload it from my car. i grabbed
larger items from the back, dropped them off, and when
i came back it wasn't there anymore - it was assumedly
brought to the location by a crew member and i left it
at that.  strike came around and it still wasn't
anywhere.

any information - anything at all - that you may have
about my bag would be greatly appreciated.  if you saw
it, where you saw it and WHEN you saw it would be
incredibly helpful.

you can reach me anytime via this email addy -

thanks,
shelley

Excuse me this is not a single event this is thousands of events.

(but you really have to look at the full spectrum of their actions and
initiatives... i grew up in times square, in the 80's... if you knew
anything about nyc or spent significant time there, then you'll know that
giuliani is responsible for turning that area from a decadent porn, hooker,
and drug den into a booming economic and tourist haven...)

This is not a tourist heaven , this is a corporate franchise today, there is
nothing interesting about , McDonalds, Disney, on and on, cheap broadway
thrillers. And the hoods are just around the corner. I was there in the 80's
, I liked  it . Its was so colorfull , and interesting ,free, a unique
place. 
By the way, whats wrong with "decadent porn" are you a christion moralist. I
think amsterdam has much more "decadent porn" than times square did. You
must be a voting member of the republican party, so naturally you would not
like these things. 
  But lets be fair, and give credit where it is do, Adolph would have been a
great cop. His guilty feelings about his father being in the Mafia and going
to Sing Sing for most of his childhood (his dad jacked the mail man, federal
offense). Rudolph should have never been mayor, but would have been a good
policeman with a liberal mayor, one more tastefull and resptfull for the
arts to keep him in line.
  I like the way the mayor of Berlin allways address's the attendee's of the
Popkomm festival with a welcome letter, to  all the participants and diverse
Independent techno labels. In Guiliani's eyes we were all "evil doers"
Love Parade in NY, I don't think so.

We're not talking about "explicit illegal activity" for events. We're
talking about places like the Cooler, Baktun, Filter 14 (jacky 60's)
,cbgb's, knitting factory and more clean fully legal venues being closed or
coming close to closure because of Adlophs policies.  In short you seen to
not really understand the depth of these problems. Which I why I write about
it because it amazes me how many people don't realize what happened there
and could happen elsewhere.

Ive personally have thrown close to 400 events in NY city, LEGAL events and
I know what I'm talking about. There are no exagerations in what I'm
writing.

Subject: [sfraves] Monitor speakers + stands needed tonight!

I need to borrow a couple powered monitor speakers, cables (RCA outs  
on the mixer), and stands for this evening.  I'm spinning for our  
neighborhood block party, and the "PA system" that we were supposed  
to use is totally inadequate.

Anyone have a pair I could use tonight?  Please give me a call on my  
cell - 415 255 9776

I can pick up around 6 pm and have them back by 11 or so.  I'm in  
Oakland.

Thanks!

Subject: RE: [sfraves] Renegade Violence Friday Night

I just wanted to cross-post the comments from the incident that happened at 
the WOM crews party Friday night which are effects from inner city late 
night parties in remote locations that should get everyone thinkign about 
the safety of the party-goers.. an important issue for sure.


This from tribe:

Gang violence at Friday's renegadeToday, 10:26 AM

On Friday night there was a renegade on the jetty near pound SF. Great 
party, good vibe, lots of friendly diverse people, top notch music and some 
excellent fire spinning. Around 4:30 several unfriendly local thugs stumbled 
upon the party with eyes wide like they had just found a liquor store with 
no attendant. They approached 2 party partygoers and robbed them at 
gunpoint. They took everything these kids had on them and before the 
incident was finished, one of them had been pistol-whipped across the face. 
While I did not witness the actual event, I did watch the aftermath unfold. 
The injured kid was pretty beaten up, and bleeding… his friends took him to 
the hospital and the party was shut down almost immediately. We got out of 
there as quickly as possible, shocked and disturbed by what had happened.

Nobody could have anticipated something like this and nobody is to blame for 
what happened. In reflecting on this situation it occurred to me that we 
spend a lot of time in dodgy neighborhoods (both inside and out,) off our 
heads, partying without a care in the world… and yes, that is what a 
renegade is all about. But, paying attention to what is going on around you 
and being able to react to safety concerns is of the utmost importance. This 
could have happened anywhere, to anyone and it’s very unfortunate that it 
happened on Friday. A major lesson learned is simple awareness of your 
surroundings at all times, especially when you are outside, at night, in one 
of the worst neighborhoods in the city. I think the crew throwing this party 
reacted in an excellent way by ensuring that the injured party kid got a 
ride to the hospital and shutting down the party as soon as possible. In my 
discussions of this on Saturday and Sunday I discovered that False Profit 
hired a security guard for their most recent renegade due to the 
neighborhood that they had chosen (hunters point area). It’s possible that a 
security guard may have prevented this situation – but it’s also very 
possible that they would have had no impact.

I am posting this on a few tribes with the intention of drumming up some 
conversation and awareness regarding safety concerns at parties around the 
city. I think it’s really important to discuss incidents like this and learn 
from them to improve the quality of our enjoyment and the safety at events 
like this. This was the first time I have ever even heard of violence like 
this at a party… sure, the cops have invaded our good times on occasion, but 
never a group of violent gun-toting gangsters.

That sucks.  Back in the day in Chicago promoters had to watch out all the
time, I knew a few that got jumped trying to leave the party with their
earnings and got beat really badly, shady dealings but then again that's
the risk you take when you take things underground I suppose.

Gangs, Politics & House Music: The History of Hip Hop in Chicago. 

An interview with Jitu of the pioneering hip hop group Ten Tray By Davey D

Nowadays it’s hard to turn on the radio and not hear music from one of Chicago’s many music superstars. Common, Twista, Da Brat, Shawnna, R Kelly, Doe or Die, Crucial Conflict, Lupe Fiasco, and of course Kanye West seem to have firmly positioned themselves on the nation’s airwaves. 

If you dig a little deeper and check out Hip Hop’s underground, you’ll discover that very few people are willing to roll up and do battle with esteemed Chi-town lyricists like M’Rald, Rhymefest and of course Juice. Others like DJ Third Rail and the late DJ Pinkhouse to name a few have not only made names for themselves as deejays not to be toyed with but also provided important platform for local artists.

Yes, the Chi seems to have established itself in the world of Hip Hop, but it wasn’t always like that. In fact much of the Chi-Town’s success is a direct result of organized effort by it’s pioneering Hip Hop community that grew frustrated from being locked out by the industry that saw Chicago, more as a consumer market as a opposed to a place where stars are born. 

Many within the music industry were only willing to embrace the nation’s third largest city as the Mecca for House Music and somehow managed to disconnect that music form from Hip Hop when in many ways the two are intertwined, especially along the lines of deejay culture. 

The battle to establish ‘Tha Chi’ within Hip Hop was about as brutal as its political landscape. Unsung heroes like Dr Groove, Lord Cashus D, DA Smart, Black Allies, Sugar Ray Dinky, George Daniels, World wide Posse, God Squad, The Chi Rock Nation, Ill State Assassins, and the late DJ Pink House all played crucial roles in organizing, pushing the envelop and seeing to it that the Windy City get its respect. They used to roll up on nightclubs, radio stations and even label executives demanding to be recognized. Many will forget that back in the late 80s there was a movement called the New World Order which brought many of Chicago’s Hip Hop community together as they fought for change and respect.

The needle has not been used much lately. Need a job. Tired of searching.
Tired of interviews. Tired of life?

The funds run red, the crops dry up, the poppies run out...

This pain in my gut. This pain in my gut. I have done it to myself with my
eyes wide open. Gosh, the stress is relentless. I owe but yet I'm owed.

Bought Biosphere - Substrata and listened closely. I found different
feelings and places. Different moods and colors. I highly recommend it to
anyone looking for a great ambient CD. Warm, yet cold, cold, yet fixed.

Finished two more tracks. My CD now has 14 songs on it. but no capital to
get mastered or pressed at this time. Is it even worth it anyway?

'Scissors for Lefty' play Friday in San Jose. Live 105 seems to be all over
them,. People should go.

Much love to all those that participate in this place and time.

Rocked good here on Treasure Island.  Nice swell with an after roller.

My GF was talking to my mom around the time.  Mom said she felt the quake 
hit, then 30 secs later my GF felt it here in SF.

Pretty wild.

that's our interactive remix-o-musical sound installation, the 
improbable orchestra.

http://www.improbableorchestra.com/

you can't have it!  ;)  but actually, we are beginning work on a home 
version.  if you've got any requests or feedback i'd be curious to hear 
it, since we're in the early planning stages of the next generation of 
the thing right now.

io is usually at burning man but may or may not make it out there this

Subject: RE: [sfraves] Renegade Violence Friday Night

That sucks big time.

Many years ago, I was at a warehouse party near Santa Cruz. They had a big
security guy working the door. A few local gangsters showed up and tried to
get but instead scuffled with the security and were sent on their way.

They came back with a rifle and started shooting through the warehouse's
closed roll up door. A few people took some bullets including one guy who
got hit in the head and died.

Subject: RE: [sfraves] Renegade Violence Friday Night

I was there too. J-Bot who then just went by his name,
James was spnning, and  I was leaning on the roll-up
door when the shots came through. One of my friends
got shot in the leg. I was the first person to get to
the guy who died, and my old friend Jason aka: snappy
did what EMT stuff he could.

That party left me tripped out for weeks. It occurred
in the late Spring of 1993.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Renegade Violence Friday Night

I remember hearing about this.  I lived in Santa Cruz (well actually Boulder Creek) at the time, although I the first rave I went to wasn't until later that winter.

With respect to the more recent events, its difficult to see how open parties at the beach can really be secured.  Perhaps the best security comes from more careful promotion of the event.

Peace,

Peter

I was there too. J-Bot who then just went by his name,
James was spnning, and  I was leaning on the roll-up
door when the shots came through. One of my friends
got shot in the leg. I was the first person to get to
the guy who died, and my old friend Jason aka: snappy
did what EMT stuff he could.

That party left me tripped out for weeks. It occurred
in the late Spring of 1993.

Of your mind becomes

Subject: RE: [sfraves] Renegade Violence Friday Night

I still have the newspaper article about what happened. The police caught
the guys who did it the same night. They were driving around Watsonville
with the gun in the car. 

There was no phone in that warehouse and a friend and I had to jump a fence
in the back and run to a neighbor's house about 1/4 mile down the road where
they called the police and ambulance.

I remember that someone was filming the party all night with a camera on a
tripod in the corner. Apparently, they used the footage at the trial as it
showed people getting shot-up.

Subject: RE: [sfraves] Renegade Violence Friday Night

OMG you guys.. Eric.. fucking trippin dude.  Man.. the whole concept of gang 
violence and raving just blows me away.  I have never known anything but 
plur and am so happy for it.. I think it is why I am still not jaded.. and 
more seriously.. I still think that although random.. there are things we 
can do to prevent and protect the community.. like planning parties with 
safety in mind.

I just cross posted that as a wake up call to event planners.. "please keep 
patron safety in mind"  we will love you for it all the more!

I was there too. J-Bot who then just went by his name,
James was spnning, and  I was leaning on the roll-up
door when the shots came through. One of my friends
got shot in the leg. I was the first person to get to
the guy who died, and my old friend Jason aka: snappy
did what EMT stuff he could.

That party left me tripped out for weeks. It occurred
in the late Spring of 1993.

I still have the newspaper article about what happened. The police caught
the guys who did it the same night. They were driving around Watsonville
with the gun in the car.

There was no phone in that warehouse and a friend and I had to jump a fence
in the back and run to a neighbor's house about 1/4 mile down the road where
they called the police and ambulance.

I remember that someone was filming the party all night with a camera on a
tripod in the corner. Apparently, they used the footage at the trial as it
showed people getting shot-up.

I was there too. J-Bot who then just went by his name,
James was spnning, and I was leaning on the roll-up
door when the shots came through. One of my friends
got shot in the leg. I was the first person to get to
the guy who died, and my old friend Jason aka: snappy
did what EMT stuff he could.

That party left me tripped out for weeks. It occurred
in the late Spring of 1993.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Renegade Violence Friday Night

Scottsdale is a trip.. lot's of redneck violence in all the surrounding 
communities.. that fact that they made it to a nice house isn't too 
surprising.. there are a lots of REALLY nice houses out there - cause 
compared to Cali it is cheap as hell.  My ex GF's dad is one of the best 
plastic surgeons in the south west and their house is in a neighborhood 
where everyone designs and builds their own homes custom, on some mountain 
everyone climbs. Yet his son has all kinds of violent friends and is a 
braller, while the other son died from H.  Now.. you tell me where to draw 
the line.

Point is.. you can't escape redneck/gang violence without first protecting 
community.   If everyone does their job of raising conciousness, looking out 
for others, planning for safety.. I think we won't hear much more about 
violence.. cause it seems to be on an upswning.. so let's stomp it out!

north scottsdale, which is one of the ritzy areas of town in phoenix.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Renegade Violence Friday Night

funny thing is, is that everyone thinks of the area of town that
myself and jack triumph live in (houses about 2 blocks from each
other) as a ghetto, yet I can't think of one act of violence within 5
miles of our houses since I moved out here in 2003.

West Side for lyfe.

checking them on the spot.  Eventually they were asked to leave and offered 
refunds.  I believe a fight started and all hell broke loose.  They were all 
shoved outside the venue and the door was locked but unfortunatly one of the 
guys who helps out and djs (Andrew K) was trapped outside with them.  They 
beat him up with a 2x4 and he was hospitalized for at the very minimum 
several days. He's ok now and was back on his feet pretty quickly but it 
really brings to light the dangers of us (party goers) being forced by the 
cities to throw renegade events in ghetto's.

Another event happened at the Crack House in Oakland where some gang bangers 
stole the cash box at the door and I believe fired some shots off.  These 
guys were locals and always seen hangin around the venue.  I actually 
believe there were several incidents there that compelled people to stop 
using the venue and in general brought great concern to partying in Oakland. 
PERIOD.

It just seemed like the gangtsa / ghetto people had finally figured out that 
they could swoop up on unsuspecting ravers or even force there way into 
events and do what they want.  Even when there was security present.

Its a very scary reality we have to deal with sometimes.

My g/f is busy with her final summer school project, and I've had my
head so far up my job's ass it's been impossible to keep my ear to the
ground.

So I turn to you, my bay area beat freq peeps, to bail me out once
again.  Where might I go to hear some tasty bass tonight and get
schwilly?

Subject: [sfraves] Violence and Liability....

Here's what I said in 1999 about Oakland shutting down
legal parties....

" Silver Pearl Records' Eric Spire voices the
conundrum: "It seems to me that they're trying to take
the liability away, but they may be increasing it.
They are not going to be issuing permits, but events
are going to happen within their city limits anyhow,
and they're not going to know about them." 

Going on to say that permitted events were safer,
because at least the event attendees had the
protection of the police outside the event. With no
permits, "thug" violence, muggings, vandalism, etc ...
are an obvious outcome.

.... I am also writing a little story about the party
in 1993 where the shooting happpened. I will post it
later.

"Americans like to talk about (or be told about) Democracy but, when put to the test, usually find it to be an 'inconvenience.' We have opted instead for an authoritarian system disguised as a Democracy. We pay through the nose for an enormous joke-of-a-government, let it push us around, and then wonder how all those assholes got in there." - Frank Zappa 

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become visible."

Simulating weapons of mass destruction? Thats a
fucking crime? How rediculous. So if I build a toy
bomb out of something I get thrown in jail? I dont

Using pure data as a source for sound and visuals, datamatics combines abstract and mimetic presentations of matter, time and space in a powerful and breathtakingly accomplished work. 

datamatics is the second audiovisual concert in Ryoji Ikeda?s datamatics series? an art project that explores the potential to perceive the invisible multi?substance of data that permeates our world. For datamatics [ver.1.0b], Ikeda presents a special surround-sound version of his datamatics concert. 

Projecting dynamic, computer?generated imagery ? in pared down black and white with striking colour accents, Ikeda?s intense yet minimal graphic renderings of data progress through multiple dimensions. From 2D sequences of patterns derived from hard drive errors and studies of software code, the imagery transforms into dramatic, rotating views of the universe in 3D, whilst the final scenes add a further dimension as four-dimensional mathematical processing opens up spectacular and seemingly infinite vistas. 

A powerful and hypnotic soundtrack reflects the imagery through a meticulous layering of sonic components to produce immense and apparently boundless acoustic spaces. 

datamatics? alongside the recently released and critically acclaimed dataplex album(raster-noton)? marks a significant and exciting progression in Ikeda?s work. 

Ryoji Ikeda 
Japan's leading electronic composer/artist, Ryoji Ikeda, focuses on the minutiae of ultrasonics, frequencies and the essential characteristics of sound itself. Since 1995, Ikeda has been intensely active through concerts, installations, and recordings, integrating sound, acoustics and sublime imagery. In the artist?s works, music, time and space are shaped by mathematical methods as Ikeda explores sound as sensation, pulling apart its physical properties to reveal its relationship with human perception. 

Ikeda has gained a reputation as one of the few international artists working convincingly across both visual and sonic media. Using computer and digital technologies to the utmost limit, his audiovisual concerts datamatics (2006 ? present), C4I (2004 ? present) and formula (2000 ? 2006) suggest a unique orientation for our future multimedia environment and culture. His acclaimed installations data.spectra (2005), spectra [for terminal 5, jfk] (2004), spectra II (2002) and db (2002) continue to diffuse Ikeda?s aesthetic of ?ultra minimalism? to the art world. Ikeda?s latest body of work, datamatics, is a long-term programme of moving image, sculptural, sound and new media works that use data as their theme and material to explore the ways in which abstracted views of reality ? data ? are used to encode, understand and control the world. 

He has been hailed by critics as one of the most radical and innovative contemporary composers for his live performances, sound installations and album releases. His albums +/- (Touch, 1996), 0°C (Touch, 1998) and matrix (Touch, 2000) pioneered a new minimal world of electronic music, employing sine waves, electronic "glitch" sounds, and white noise. Ikeda released his critically acclaimed, seventh solo album entitled dataplex (raster-noton), as part of the datamatics series, in 2005. 


The versatile range of Ikeda's research is demonstrated by his collaborations with Carsten Nicolai on the project cyclo. and with choreographer William Forsythe/Frankfurt Ballett, artist Hiroshi Sugimoto, architect Toyo Ito and artist collective Dumb Type, among others. 

Ikeda has exhibited and performed at many of the world's leading festivals and venues, including the Australian Centre for the Moving Image, 2005 (Melbourne); Centre Pompidou 2004 and 2001, Musée d'Art Moderne de la Ville 1999, and La Villette 2002 (all Paris); Sónar 1999 and 2006 (Barcelona); Architectural Association 2002, Barbican 2006, Hayward Gallery 2000, Millennium Dome 2000, Queen Elizabeth Hall 2000, Tate Modern Turbine Hall 2006 (all London); Auditorium Parco della Musica 2003 (Rome); ICC 1999 and 2005, Tokyo International Forum 2006 (Tokyo); Göteborg Biennial 2003 (Göteborg). In 2001, Ikeda was awarded the Ars Electronica Golden Nica prize in the digital music category and he was short-listed for a World Technology Award in 2003.

"simulation of a weapon of mass destruction"?  WTF?  Thye're claiming tha tby dressing up as zombies they were simulating a WMD attack?

And what's up with "zombie" parties?  These seem like a bad idea to me after Seattle.

Peace,

It sounds to me that someone in authority decided that these "homemade 
radios" looked like improvised weapons. I know that's total B.S. -- as if people 
would be dancing when there are more important things to do like tending to the 
weapons -- but that's the excuse. Looking like zombies isn't the purported 
crime here, it's having something that, absurd as it is, looks like an improvised 
weapon. 
I'd just like to see what they're talking about. If they have a boom box 
decorated to look roughly like a weapon, and it says "TO BE DROPPED ON WHITE 
HOUSE," the authorities would have something, although VERY flimsy, to hang on the 
people and use the EXCUSE of this WMD law to hassle the make-believe zombies. 
Even still, there are plenty of laws they could draw on, like laws against 
illegal assembly, lack of permits, amount of noise, complaints from the 
public,etc etc but jeeesus this sure isn't a WMD case. 
Maybe they overheard a zombie say "Whoa dude, this party is da bomb" ???

Howdy - thought this might be a good place to post regarding rideshare to BM, as I'm getting nothing from eplaya or craigslist.
   
  I am leaving either Tuesday afternoon or Wednesday morning, and returning to SF on Sunday. I have room for one person's gear and bike. I am looking for someone to share gas and driving. You must be responsible, reasonably sane, and...I think that's it. I'm just looking for a ride-buddy. This will be my fifth burn and I've driven there before. Solitude is nice but on a six-hour drive, lively conversation is preferred.
   
  If you or someone you know would like to discuss rideshare, please feel free to contact me at carpetelf@yahoo.com.
   
  I am renting a car, so if you are on the same schedule and conversely looking for someone to share your car, I can be flexible and go that way, too.
   
  Thanks much, Marla

Free parties return to UK




Police are attempting to stop upcoming 'raves'

Police have reported that free "rave" parties in are on the rise again in the UK.

Officers have explained that they have policed several events in recent weeks and are now attempting to find out the details of one massive, illegal party in particular, which is due to take place in the coming weeks.

Intelligence specialists are monitoring websites and party phonelines attempting to pick up word of further free parties and festivals.

An event, featuring the likes of The <http://www.nme.com/artists/klaxons>Klaxons, in a disused office block in London on July 21 was broken up after just one hour 

Meanwhile Devon And Cornwall police are concerned that ravers will attempt a party in the West Country following a recent event in Newquay that saw partygoers used a car rally as cover for a rave.

Meanwhile, officers in Davidstow near Camelford, watched as 5,000 people hold a party on a disused airfield, while Thames Valley police are using ASBO legislation to crack down on raves, The Guardian reports.

The Conservative government passed The Criminal Justice and Public Act Order in 1994 attempting to thwart the spread of dance culture parties. It gave police the power to tackle "A gathering on land in the open air...at which amplified music is played during the night."

However with the current rise of the new rave scene, it's believed fans are now also resurrecting free party culture.

"Americans like to talk about (or be told about) Democracy but, when put to the test, usually find it to be an 'inconvenience.' We have opted instead for an authoritarian system disguised as a Democracy. We pay through the nose for an enormous joke-of-a-government, let it push us around, and then wonder how all those assholes got in there." - Frank Zappa 

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become visible."

"No sage or savior has ever endorsed greed and gluttony as a path  
toward social justice or personal fulfillment.  These sane and  
enlightened people come to us from all cultures and all eras,  
sometimes knowing of each other but more often not.  Socrates and  
Jesus, Lao Tzu and Tolstoi, Gandhi and Martin Buber -- no one can  
find in their lives and words a jot of support for a political and  
economic regime that encourages the acquisition of wealth far beyond  
what is needed for the necessaries -- or even the restorative  
pleasures -- of life while consigning the masses to live and work in  
squalor."
-Stephen J. Fortunato, Associate Justice, Rhode Island Supreme Court.

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of  
the rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will  
gradually become visible."
-Jacques Attali in his seminal text "Noise"

http://www.startribune.com/462/story/572409.html

'Zombie dancers' spend their weekend in lockup
Minneapolis police arrested the group on suspicion of having =20
"simulated weapons of mass destruction," but no charges filed.
Chao Xiong, Star Tribune
Last update: July 25, 2006 =96 1:39 AM

Group members assess damage

DAVID JOLES, STAR TRIBUNE

In the middle of downtown Minneapolis Saturday night, police found =20
seven people clustered on a street corner, some pale-faced and =20
covered in fake blood and wearing tattered clothes. A few carried =20
backpacks with protruding wires.
It was, participants said later, a "zombie dance party," in which a =20
group of young friends dress in sometimes outlandish attire and =20
congregate in public places to dance to music from portable stereos =20
carried on their backs.
But when the dancers wouldn't tell police concerned about the =20
mysterious wires, give their names or provide identification, they =20
ended up arrested, held in jail until Monday afternoon on suspicion =20
of having "simulated weapons of mass destruction."
None have been charged.
Police say the group was uncooperative and intimidated passersby with =20=

their "ghoulish" makeup at a time when officers were on high alert in =20=

reaction to a bulletin about men in other states who wear clown =20
makeup while attacking and robbing people, said Inspector Janee Harteau.
"Given the circumstance of them being uncooperative ... why would you =20=

have those [bags] if not to intimidate people?" Harteau said. "It's =20
not a case of [police] overreacting."
Kate Kibby, who was one of those arrested, had a different opinion. =20
She said the group met at the Nicollet Mall light-rail station for a =20
"zombie dance party," which generally occur in public spaces. =20
Sometimes, she said, strangers join in. The parties have occurred =20
without arrest at the Mall of America and on light-rail trains, she =20
said.
The group -- six adults and a juvenile -- had just finished watching =20
a drum line near 6th Street and Hennepin Avenue when two officers =20
approached, asked for identification and refused to say why they were =20=

being questioned, Kibby said. "We should have had an explanation as =20
to why [they wanted our identification] and they weren't giving it to =20=

us," she said.
Christian Utne, one of the event organizers, said that happened about =20=

45 minutes after two different officers approached them on Nicollet =20
Mall and asked them to turn down the volume of their music. Those =20
officers then left the group alone, he said.
"It was absolutely ridiculous," said Utne. "Outrageous."
Kibby, Utne and police agree that group members initially did not =20
reveal their identities. But Kibby said the group -- not knowing what =20=

would happen -- did cooperate and follow the two officers to the =20
First Precinct.
The two original officers didn't appear to think the backpacks were =20
bombs, said Kibby, who said she had a messenger bag. They weren't =20
searched until after they arrived at the First Precinct, where she =20
said several officers appeared to be making fun of them, she said.
Police spokesman Lt. Greg Reinhardt said reports show that there were =20=

"four items that were used to simulate an explosive device."
Members of the group could still face lesser charges, such as =20
disorderly conduct, police said. Kibby said group members are =20
considering legal action.
"It was clear to us that they were trying to get a rise out of us," =20
she said.

Santa Rosa, for the moment.

I might actually be in San Mateo in a few days. If I don't move though, I

LOL

Sorry.  Grew up up there.  Don't get your hopes up.

Santa Rosa and most of SoCo considers the RAVE Act to be one of the books 
of the New Testament.  I rememeber in the arly 90s there were a few Raves 
out in the river area and the spin the media they put on them made'em sound 
like they were worse than some satanic cult gathering to slaughter 
animimals.  Like doing a little N2O was far worse than shooting Heroin in a 
dirty alley somewhere.

I was throwing some stuff in '99 up there in some unincorporated area.  We 
hbarred some undesireables from coming in so they calle dthe cops and told 
them that there were naked peopel running around.  We had the entire 
Sheriff dept show up that night, 25 cars plus 3 K-9 units.  This wasn't 
even a "Rave" just a party with about 200 ppl (ya ok, loud music, full open 
bar, and lot of wacky fetish people in PVC and Latex getting freaky in all 
areas of the house.  I think it might have been Liquid Latex 
night...   memory is cloudy).

You dont need to be a skateboarder to notice that. But you can't say that
about all of them. Some of them actually ARE out to help the community...
just way to few it seems.

haha yeah ... It's all because of them saying "Today's show is brought to you 
by the letter E"  And let's not forget the letter A, while we're at it.  

Vanna White on Wheel of Fortune was a major dealer. She was giving people 
vowels like A and E whenever Pat Sajak told her too.

Anesthesia Drug Rapidly Lifts Depression, Researchers Say


By Amanda Gardner

HealthDay Reporter 1 hour, 18 minutes ago

MONDAY, Aug. 7 (HealthDay News) -- A single dose of an anesthesia  
drug produced relief from depression in as little as two hours in a  
small group of patients for whom several other treatments had failed,  
U.S. government researchers report.

The researchers said, however, that the drug, ketamine, is unlikely  
to be used in the treatment of depression because of possible side  
effects, including psychosis. But the new finding does signal an  
important direction for future research.

Currently available antidepressants can take weeks to work. "That was  
similar to the sound barrier. We felt we couldn't pass it," said Dr.  
Carlos A. Zarate Jr., lead author of the study and chief of the mood  
disorders research unit at the National Institute of Mental Health.

He added, "Now the sound barrier is broken. That doesn't mean you can  
get on the plane and take off right away, but it means it's possible  
that we can come up with a treatment that works very rapidly. That's  
down the road."

Ketamine is novel not only for the speed of its effect, but also  
because it targets a new system in the brain.
"It's novel because all antidepressants that are currently available  
work on neurotransmitters that are monoamines like dopamine and  
serotonin. That's the focus of the current antidepressant  
armamentarium," explained Dr. Richard A. Friedman, director of the  
psychopharmacology clinic at Cornell University's Medical Center in  
New York City. "Ketamine involves a particular system of the brain  
called glutamate. It's the main excitory neurotransmitter in the  
brain," he said.

Depression is a chronic, disabling condition affecting almost 15  
million Americans -- almost 7 percent of the adult U.S. population --  
in any given year. Some 4 percent of people with depression will end  
their own lives, resulting in 30,000 suicides each year.

Unfortunately, about half of people with depression don't receive  
treatment and, of those who do get treatment, only about 40 percent  
get the best, "evidence-based" treatment. Some people still don't get  
better even with this type of treatment, however.
This is one of the first studies in humans to look at the effect of  
ketamine on depression, although previous animal studies had shown  
promising results.
For the study, which is published in the August issue of the Archives  
of General Psychiatry, 18 treatment-resistant patients with  
depression were randomly assigned to receive either one intravenous  
dose of ketamine or a placebo. Participants had tried an average of  
six antidepressant medications without success in the past.
Depression improved within one day in 71 percent of participants who  
received ketamine; 29 percent of those became nearly symptom-free  
within one day. Thirty-five percent of those receiving ketamine still  
showed benefits after several weeks. Those in the placebo group  
showed no improvement.

One week later, participants were given the opposite treatment,  
unless they were still showing a benefit from the ketamine.

"People had tried six to seven antidepressants on average and had  
been ill for 30 years. The current episode was three years in  
duration," Zarate said. "All people who went through this reported a  
tremendous relief of suffering."

Short-term side effects, including perception disturbances, went away  
usually before the antidepressant effect kicked in. Participants were  
given a relatively low dose, so they did not experience the more  
severe side effects.

Ketamine works by blocking the N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA)  
receptor, which receives signals for glutamate. Using ketamine to  
block glutamate's action on the NMDA receptor also seemed to have a  
secondary effect on another brain receptor, the AMPA receptor.

Zarate and his team are now looking at several ways to use this  
information for depressed patients. "We're looking to see if we can  
refine ketamine for clinical use by taking care of side effects," he  
said. "We're also looking at other drugs."

Just an FYI to all...

THIS IS THE PATRIOT ACT IN MOTION. WMD, is only used
in arrests where the PATRIOT ACT is being enforced.

AND... Most importantly, if someones make-up
intimidates a passerby, when will they arrest Black
men who scare bigotted white women? Or Indians who
people fear are terrorists.... BECAUSE THEIR
APPEARANCE TERRORIZED THEM.??????

This country is insane.... we have no freedoms.... if
your underground doesn't get busted this weekend, its
not cuz they dont know, its just that they were too
busy fucking up some other innocent persons evening.

Don't by naive about these laws. If they arrest you
under the patriot act, say you terrorized someone,
find a 7th degree of seperation on your phone bill to
a REAL terrorist, you'll be locked up, not afforded
YOUR PAPER given rights as an American, and left to
rot without representation, and they won't even have
to let anyone know where they are incarcerating you.

Yeah team.

E

PS... George bush will not stand to murder 100 cell
organisms, but loves killing adults. If a cock roach
ate a bundle of stem cells and he stepped on it, could
he be tried for murder? Maybe we can get the Berkeley
Micro Robot team working on that....

Another study that just confirms what everyone already knows. Just like DXM,
Dissaociatives are known to be great anti-depresents.

Funny that this e-mail arrives today. I just quit cold turkey 40mg prozac
last week (because I ran out). Today I tried to get a refill, but decided
not to get it because I found out it costs $700 if you don't have insurance
and, well, I don't have insurance anymore.

Subject: [sfraves] BSP: CROOKED @ Nickie's on Haight/Fillmore : WEDNESDAY NIGHT!!!

Yes yes! The time has come to move to a venue a little more our speed: 
Darker, dirtier, grittier, louder, closer into the center of everything. 
Nickie's on Lower Haight is just the spot, and I've been eyeing it up and 
down for a while. So we snatched up Wednesdays really quickly, and we're 
running with it as hard as we can. And we just couldn't resist the name 
"Crooked," knowing the way things usually get at Nickie's.

m.d.K, Erok, Evinrude and I (the newly formed "Renegade Ferrets version 
1.2") will be holding it down, bringing in very special guests from around 
the Bay and beyond every week. We go from 10pm 'til 2am at Nickie's, and, 
unfortunately, we can't keep the free door hook-ups that we used to have at 
@lpha - we've got to charge $3 at the door at Crooked. But come on, $3... 
that's less than the cost of a drink! And well worth it for the lineups we 
plan to put together on a weekly basis.

For our premiere show, this week, August 9th, we're gonna kick it off with a 
lineup that's a bit of a preview of the type of night we want this to be 
every time (with an admitted bit of overkill on the numbers, since this 
one's special) - a few of our favorites all coming together for one wicked 
night of breaks:


8.9.06:
Kapt'n Kirk
Ernie Trevino
Ripple
Satsi
Evinrude

So come out, have a drink with us, say hello, and help us usher in Crooked, 
a brand-new way to do Wednesday nights.

Oh yeah, I almost forgot:

GET BENT!!!

8.16.06 lineup:
Kris Kent
Thomas Kent
Hyjinx
Marc(O)


CROOKED happens every Wednesday @
Nickie's BBQ
460 Haight St. @ Fillmore, SF
10pm-2am, $3, 21+ with ID

Agreed: emusic is probably the best place to get a wide variety of music,
and it's both drm-less and legal.

Subject: [sfraves] Obsoleet ROLL CALL!

Who else is going to this great party? I don't go out to a lot of
parties, but the 2x4 action is going to be amazing, where else do you
get to see these sick DJs throw down against each other?

I'm realy stoked to see an actual SFR party, I know there will be a
lot of old and new heads there, looking forward to catching up with
everyone.

Whose with me?!

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Obsoleet ROLL CALL!

Aw shit I'm trying to quit drinking and you provoke me to dust off my Team 
Nico jersey and pads.  Hrm, maybe I can find an alternative ... SOME PEOPLE 
CALL IT A SUBSTITUTE, like in sports ... get it!?  HAH.

That would mean Team Lush is the defensive squad, and Team Nico is back on 
offense.  amirite!?

love always

ROLL CALL!
 
My name's Alida. (WERD!)
Not from Korea. (Say what?!)
Hope that you'll be there (Fer reals)
So I can meetcha! (TOUCHE!)
 
Er... in other words, I'll be there with whistles and  more whistles on. You 
know... the kind that go whoot whoot! just to annoy  the shit out of you jaded 
ravers. ; )
 
Seriously, I hope that you guys can all come. There's a few of you I still  
haven't met after all these years and I would love to get the chance to connect 
 with SFR folk, new and old alike. If past SFRP events serve as indication, 
this  will be a party to remember.
 
See you this Saturday! : D
 
Heart,
Alida

Just tell him where the good stuff is.  Better to steer than to try and stifle- c'mon, he's 13.

..if he's scamming your credit card to join sites, that's another story.

I was going to write something similiar to that myself, but was waiting on a concensus. Yeah, teach him about free thumb galleries & P2P. No need for the credit card to get maxed out just yet!
   
  On a more serious note, sounds like you're turning to this list for help. If your son is capable of utilizing a wireless router, I think the only thing any content filter would do is develop his hacking skills. If it's an issue, you can always unplug the router at night if it's outside of his room- but more importantly- perhaps it's about that time for the 'talk. Don't try to dictate anything to him, just ask if he has any questions or find a dude that he trusts to rap with him. Tell him that he's normal to be curious and not to feel shy about it, but at the same time there's a "time & place" for such subject matter just like dirty jokes or cuss words. What's important is that he learns not to embarrass himself and all will be well. Sometimes kids like to feel like adults, so if you teach him that it's an adult thing and how adults handle it, maybe he'll run with it. Hope that helps, I'm just guessing at this shit. 
   
  I wish my parents were on SFR. 
   
  Best,

Um, I think about this stuff all the time, as I see
billboards and adds for sex any time I move 10 feet in
Las Vegas.

It is innapropriate for a boy to see porn and sex at
his age. If he is to grow up with a normal view of
sexual relationships with women as well as a general
respect for women, block the porn with whatever
resources you can manage. Best of all, talk to him
about it, make him face it, make him see how
uncomfortable he is with it around you as his mother.
My therapist years ago told me that mothers, as mine
did, often abruptly lose touch with their sons at age
12 -13, because they don't know how to approach and
deal with their emerging sexuality.

This being said, I remember all my first sexual
experiences, the uncomfortableness of touching a girls
"boob," trying to "get down her pants," etc.... I had
no idea what I was looking for, what it would feel
like, and was often in awe or confused, or over
stimulated, etc.... ANd... so was she.

Point being, letting your 12 yr old get all the info
without going through the experimentation is like
handing a kid a speech to text converter and never
teaching them to write or spell...

Most important... to much porn to a 12 yr old breeds
bizarre expectations, dissociative sexual habits, and
probably leads to an increased chance of date rape in
the future. That being said, there is a HUGE
difference between seeing a naked woman in playboy,
and watching people FUCK.

My TWO cents.

Eric

Adriana,

I agree with Eric, I don't see any need for a 13 year old to be watching
hard core nrop and without a proper father figure showing how to properly
treat and respect women this could be a big cause of concern. I say check
out his history folder (or cache folder if he is savvy enough to clear the
history folder) and see exactly where he is going, then make a list of the
domain names. You can then go into your router and ban all the domains (like
www.whenharrywetsally.com). If you have a linksys router you can access it
by typing in http://192.168.1.1/ on a connected computer.
Also, is it possible to place the computer in a easily seen place, like the
family room? and Limit the time allowed.

I don't let my son use the internet unless I'm in the same room and made a
firm rule that he must tell me before he does any google searches for
anything.

Good luck!

High level alert over rave rebirth
By <mailto:krussell@london.newsquest.co.uk>Kate Russell

by RUBY ALI Landowners in Enfield have been warned to keep their property secure in the wake of the re-emergence of the illegal rave scene.

The warning has been issued by Enfield Council which is supporting a nationwide police operation to track and prevent illegal raves across the UK.

Illegal raves had their heyday in the 1980s and 1990s, typifying the drugs and dance culture of the time, where big warehouses would be used to hold illegal all-night parties.

The last illegal rave in Enfield was held in September 2002, when an empty warehouse in Lockfield Avenue was taken over and hundreds of residents were disturbed by the noise which could be heard as far away as Waltham Cross.

It is thought the resurgance in the illegal rave is due to stricter controls on the use of drugs in nightclubs (1). It is also being seen as a reaction to chav (2) culture' that is overtaking the club scene.

Assistant director of the environment Ray Brewer said: "We have not been troubled by raves in the recent past. On the last occasion an industrial site was taken over due to insufficient security.

"We have no specific intelligence but we do advise owners of large sites to check the security of their property and remain vigilant to unusual activity.

"The police and local authority have powers to take enforcement action and prosecution, but prevention is always better than cure."

The rave scene died out after legislation brought in by the Conservative Government in 1994 gave police greater powers of arrest and banned open-air gatherings on land where amplified music was played during the night. The scene was also associated with the drug ecstasy.

My notes:

(1)
Perhaps they are sick of the booze culture and the nauseating music and vibe it generates.

(2)  
Chav (also Chavette (female chav)) is a <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slang>slang term in wide use throughout the <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom>United Kingdom since <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004>2004.
It refers to a <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subculture>subcultural <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereotype>stereotype of people fixated on <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion>fashions such as flashy "<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bling>bling" jewelery, and genuine or knock-off designer clothing with the beige <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burberry>Burberry pattern (most famously the <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_cap>baseball cap which has since been discontinued by the company), and such brands as <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adidas>Adidas and <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nike%2C_Inc.>Nike and Lacoste.

"Americans like to talk about (or be told about) Democracy but, when put to the test, usually find it to be an 'inconvenience.' We have opted instead for an authoritarian system disguised as a Democracy. We pay through the nose for an enormous joke-of-a-government, let it push us around, and then wonder how all those assholes got in there." - Frank Zappa 

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become visible."

Subject: Re: [sfraves] nrr: interweb babysitter

on a slightly different tangent:

this might seem strange to some, but right around that age my mom did
something to demystify sex:

she bought me some of the most scientifically and graphically explicit
books on sexual functions and the human body.  full color diagrams and
cross sections of the penis, uterus, vagina and all that good stuff.
you remember those books you had as a kid with the little "pull here"
tabs and dials and switches?  these books had that too.  pull the
lever and see the sperm swim into the fallopian tubes!  turn and dial
and watch the color of the testes change!

like any kid, i was curious about sex and any porn i got my hands on
was a godsend.  but i always remembered those books and sex didn't
seem like this strange and mystical thing that was super taboo.

*shrug*

Subject: Re: [sfraves] nrr: interweb babysitter

Thats just brought up some funny memories... 

"Where did I come from" and "whats happening to
me"....

Those were the books I was given by mom as the "sex
talk."

My inept father's version of the sex talk...
"Do you have hair in your groin?" and "As you get
older, men need to where deodorant."

The books my mom gave me, along with sneak peaks at
the "joy of sex" were the training I got. I never saw
porn until I was an adult... unless the occasional
peak at playboy and national geographic count.

PS... I guess my point was less about it being this
mystical strange thing as it was to be an experience
that you should experience firsthand rather than see
how someone else does it first. Like the information
should be given, but the path found by the individual.

Subject: [sfraves] The rave scene and what it's all about?

Howdy folks! I'm new to this list, and new to San
Francisco. So much new-ness going on it's crazy!

My first E experience was about four months ago. It
was such a mind-blowingly fun experience, and it was
just myself and my girlfriend. Since then we've done
it a couple times, but it's still just been me and
her. I'm curious as to the rave scene, seems like it
would be fun with the right combination of chemicals,
but I'm not sure where a good place to start out is.
And all this talk of parties in Hunter's Point and
people getting shot ... frankly makes me happy to just
stay at home and walk around the city and stuff.

So, any advice?

a good place to start is within your self. the rave the scene is different things to different people. it is what it is.

advice:  get out, meet people (in person, that is), help out with  
some events.

if you're looking for chemicals, you should start here:  http:// 
chem.berkeley.edu/
(I hear the program is tough, but it's a good education and will open  
a lot of doors for you as a professional)

if you're looking for what the "rave scene is all about", nobody can  
tell you that. Find out for yourself.

My mom bought me that book too!  Haha.  That and "changing bodies, changing lives", which I can reccommend- a very matter-of-fact humanist book for kids entering puberty and wondering about sex.  It helped me tremendously.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] nrr: interweb babysitter

on a slightly different tangent:

this might seem strange to some, but right around that age my mom did
something to demystify sex:

she bought me some of the most scientifically and graphically explicit
books on sexual functions and the human body.  full color diagrams and
cross sections of the penis, uterus, vagina and all that good stuff.
you remember those books you had as a kid with the little "pull here"
tabs and dials and switches?  these books had that too.  pull the
lever and see the sperm swim into the fallopian tubes!  turn and dial
and watch the color of the testes change!

like any kid, i was curious about sex and any porn i got my hands on
was a godsend.  but i always remembered those books and sex didn't
seem like this strange and mystical thing that was super taboo.

*shrug*

if you are only going to raves because you want to do drugs and listen
to music, then the party doesn't matter.  only the drugs matter.

Yeah, I didn't write this clearly enough. I wasn't
asking where to start with the drugs, just asking
where to start with the rave scene. My apologies. Gosh
what a terrible foot to start out on (runs back to
internet cave).

I think to be into that sort of music is one thing,
but 'rave' is a very specific term, with modern
connotations that the experience is made more exciting
via intoxicants. It's like, if you're going to a bar
you're probably going to drink some alcohol. Does that
mean you only love alcohol and the bar isn't about
hanging out with your friends and meeting people as
well?

You're right about that. Generally rave = loud repetitive music + 
ectsasy (and about 50 other different chems). Old scruffy rave heads 
like the ones on this list don't like to talk about how important drugs 
are to the scene, but they are indeed very important.

Anyway, I'd recommend checking out groundscore.net and perusing the 
forums there for parties that look interesting. And, basically, just go 
out and meet people until you find a group of people that you like 
hanging out with. The rest of the culture will reveal itself eventually. :-)

To me the rave scene is about the music, its about the people. Would a rave be a rave without the music? Would a rave be a rave without the people? Some of yall might feel that its about the drugs and thats cool. Whatever works for you. Iv been partying since 99, Iv been going to partys to celebrate the music. To celebrate the peace, the love, the unity and the respect we have for one another................

Alex Laughlin <aldendy@gmail.com> wrote:  You're right about that. Generally rave = loud repetitive music + 
ectsasy (and about 50 other different chems). Old scruffy rave heads 
like the ones on this list don't like to talk about how important drugs 
are to the scene, but they are indeed very important.

Anyway, I'd recommend checking out groundscore.net and perusing the 
forums there for parties that look interesting. And, basically, just go 
out and meet people until you find a group of people that you like 
hanging out with. The rest of the culture will reveal itself eventually. :-)

Justin,

I'll state the obvious from everyone's point of view:

You're a cop.

Not only are you a cop, you're a poorly trained cop. You don't show up
on the premier San Francisco rave mailing list, and as your inaugural
post, discuss drugs and their usage. That's both stupid and moronic.

If you aren't a cop, your views of the rave scene have been obviously
skewed by the likes of Paul Van Dyk, Tiesto, and Keoki. There IS a
rave scene without drugs, and there are those who also like doing
drugs (which I personally don't partake in) generally do it behind
closed doors, and don't publicly speak of it, as it is a private event
in their lives.

Please, don't be offended by this. I'm only calling this as I see it.

Regards,

Subject: [sfraves] ride for 2 to Obsoleet from downtown SF

hi kids,

I'm trying to find a ride to Obsoleet for a couple kids coming from  
downtown SF (Turk & Leavenworth).

If you have room in your car and can help them out, give a shout.   
They just moved here from Minnesota, and don't have a car.

Thanks!
-Philip-

Subject: Re: [sfraves] The rave scene and what it's all about?

Are you for real?

I'm certain my views are fucked up, because I've never
actually BEEN to a rave. I just moved here from
Orlando, which really doesn't have much happening,
aside from the occasional Disney parade, and was just
interested in meeting some new people.

The first thing that pops into people's mind when a
'rave' is mentioned, is loud techno dance music,
dancing sweaty kids wearing obnoxious neon-colored
clothing, and ecstasy. So I wouldn't consider it so
freakishly out of the ordinary for me to mention such
a thing. I'm not aware of how huge this list is, it
seemed like a nice, tight-knit community that I wanted
to participate in.

You can claim it's deeper from your obviously more
experienced viewpoint. We don't all have that. It's
something I wouldn't mind earning, but if I'm going to
get gangfucked by the old guard, that doesn't sound so
pleasant. 

Where's the friggin' LOVE?

Wow, I don't think I have seen more vitriol pointed towards someone 
joining a mailing list.
Raving must turn you into a complete dick. That's what I just took away 
from this whole exchange.

I agree. Instead of flaming this person perhaps we
should be educating them? How are we ever going to
move forward within the scene if we dont? No new blood
and the scene does not go on. Perhaps we should be
educating the n00bs instead of scaring them away. If
we don't then they are just left with the
steroetypical definition of a rave instead of what it
really is.

Since this started with an inquiry about parties...I remember this thread
from 06/27/06 - I hope AndyW doesn't mind me re-posting this, because I
think it sums up partying/raving really well.  The original discussion was
clubs vs undergrounds...

Subject: Re: [sfraves] The rave scene and what it's all about?

i have mixed feelings about this.

the guy has never been to a rave.  he's done E with his girlfriend and
enjoyed himself.

now, he wants to go to a rave and do E.

to me, that has very little to do with raving and everything to do with drugs.

ps.  there is plenty of new blood coming into the rave scene every day.

Exactly Bam. All the more reason to educate him to
enable him to understand what it is all about. Far to
many people have that misconception about raving, and
it usually stems from the media.

Some policemen have e-mail addresses.

However in this case that seems unlikely: http://www.onetrick.net/contact.htm

and he appears to be a normal person who is not a police officer.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] The rave scene and what it's all about?

Oh snap!  I think I like the new kid!  I've been feeling pretty bitter and
jaded lately and for me I've always been one who likes going to parties
for the music and the energy it provides so I'll take a different route
with this email since those topics have been covered.

I think we're is misinterpreting Justin here.  He's new, he's done the
drugs, he's sitting at home, he and his girl want to expierience new
things and in a few replies we've made him feel like he shouldn't go out,
he should continue to stay at home and not explore all SF and the Bay Area
has to offer for what we on this list love it for.  Electronic music,
freedom of expression and striving for a better community.

So Justin, as far as electronic music goes, are there already styles you
like?  Does the idea of small parties with a typically close knit group of
people interest you or do you wanna go to huge overdone parties with tons
of international talent, local talent, circus clowns, fireworks and jungle
gyms. Would you feel more comfortable in a dance club or parking your car,
hopping in the back of a shuttle bus with a bunch of people you don't
know, then getting dropped off at some place, tromping through a forest
then find a party in the middle of nowhere.

This list is old as time itself almost, those that have been around for a
long time have come to be wary of anything dealing with open discussion
about drugs due to the bad press the electronic music scene has gotten
because of them.  Not to mention these things are of course watched by law
enforcement due to its longevity and because of how well known it is now.

As far as rave, doesn't everyone on this list call them parties now
because of Justin's description of what the term rave has come to mean? ;)

I like the music, but I haven't had a chance to really
become an expert in it. Seems like the kind of thing
that really needs to be experienced with a croud, and
ear-bursting sound systems, so you can really feel the
music rocking through you.

Wow, both those sound like a lot of fun. I find the
problem with a lot of typical dance clubs is they're
full of kind of jocky/fratty douchebags doused in
cologne just looking to have sex with whatever they
can get their hands on. I've been hoping that this
party scene is something that's a little more devoid
of that kind of 'goer.

Just as long as I don't get shot by unruly gangmembers
at some point during the night, that's really my only
requirement.

I can certainly understand that! Didn't mean to cause
alarm.

Parties, gotcha :)

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Raves are still cool!

my idea of a "raver" is someone who is SO into the scene that it's  
just absurd.  Osby, for instance.

Social Networking Site to the Rescue! 

He's on myspace and looks completely "for real" to me. Has blogs about 
apartment hunting, little videos embedded, hundreds of "friends." If cops are 
putting that much time into creating a false identity, they really need to get out 
to the donut shop more and start experiencing life! 

I won't know until I meet this person, but I think he just made a faux pas in 
his eagerness to introduce himself.

Justin -- when you go to parties, smile and introduce yourself, say where 
you're from, and you'll get to know a lot of people in no time at all.

All you ever needed to sell those records were some pretty breakdowns and 
a tranceline, gosh, lern2sellout n00b.  Put down the marketing manual and 
harness the power of your shit arpeggiator, rip some samples off 
braveheart or lord of the rings or some shit and Heavy Rollz X-tremE 
trancE SamplEz (pre-edited, just drop em right into Acid or Fruity 
Loops) cd volume 2!

Way to be shit hosers.

Bam... you can get a small helping of techage here:

http://music.cloudfactory.org/deluge/dirty_andy.mp3
That's a proper techno session with NYC's DJ Dirty and yours truly.  
Although DJ Dirty skips out about 15 minutes into it to go mack on some 
beastie at the bar or something.  This is probably one of my favorite 
recorded sets of me actually... if you turn it up loud enough, you can 
hear the dancers cheering through the needle at the quieter bits.  You 
see, there used to be like 5-6 people who thought I was kewl.

Right about the middle, it's full blown, unhyphenated tech bullshit.  Um, 
I miss sets like that.  And I end it with one of my favorite tracks ever 
(hint, it's not "techno" proper) :(

That said, I'll see what Li and I can whip up tonight.  Heheheh.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] nrr: interweb babysitter


By age 13 I had written a war dialer, kept a file of unidentified modems 
locally in an encrypted file that I'd pick off when I was bored, was a 
member on several notorious BBSs, had written 6502 assembler routines so 
my Apple's tape out could record a full compliment of various c-drop tones 
(that I then carried around on a portable cassette tape player in my 
backpack, yay free long distance and phone booths that only cost the first 
nickel) and had copies of the Anarchist's Cookbook and the Army's 
Improvised Field Munitions Manual.

And all in all I had *great* parents.

Your son is getting to the age where it's important to talk to him like a 
young man, not a liability.  His mind is about as powerful as yours now, 
it's just wisdom he lacks.  Oh, and his bloodstream is inundated with with 
a hormone(drug) that has caused more violence and death than religion.  I 
think one of the most vulgar things about our society is the way we treat 
the young and old, sectioning ourselves off into "generations" and 
discarding the wisdom of the old and the energy and alternative viewpoints 
of the young.

If you don't want him seeing that stuff, you will fail.  If you can find a 
way to talk to him about how that industry is all sorts of whack, and how 
women in the real world aren't necessarily into that (most aren't honestly 
into getting choked, fired upon by the milk of 20 businessmen or double 
anal, etc), you might get a better result.  Tell him you don't want to see 
it or find it, and hammer home the real ethics of respect.  Honesty will 
do more for your relationship with him than control.  A 13 year old dude 
is gonna wanna see boobies, welcome to earth.  You don't get to pick who 
he is gonna be, but you can stay with him thru the process of getting 
there.

And yeah, if you try to install all this crap whackware, you'll just teach 
him to cherish porn more, and he'll probably grow up to be a 
sysadmin/network engineer/scary pervert/ghettotech dj.

<3,
andyw

p.s. I don't envy being where you are, can't be easy.  I was a holy 
frikking terror between about 13 to um... still I guess and I am scared to 
death that this is genetic.  In fact, I think I'll go get a vasectomy now.  
C-ya!

Amen to that. You can try all the banning and ska-da-da you want and the
little fucker will still get at his porn. :) I mean, all of us that grew up
with BBSes and the internet were exposed to porn at 12 or 13... and we
turned out fine!!!

pictures of women huffing cock.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] The rave scene and what it's all about?

i'm 25, and without having counted, i'll say i've been to 20-30
raves/parties/spiritual gatherings in the bay area in the past year
and a half.

sometimes i spill my guts to strangers, sometimes i say nothing all
night. sometimes i dance, sometimes i sit against the wall. sometimes
i do drugs, sometimes i don't. usually i lose myself in the music,
sometimes i don't. but i always cast off my day-to-day concerns about
mailing the rent check by the 3rd and, am i out of fabric softener? i
really should get more fabric softener.

what these nights (and sunrises) are about, to me, is the energy and
community. on the subway on weekday mornings, for example, everybody
seems insular and disinterested. but at parties--these kinds of
parties--people run around smiling. you can put your hand on anyone's
shoulder and say, "haha, look at all this; this is crazy!" and yeah, i
like when someone with huge pupils tells me something that they never
even felt comfortable thinking about.

i really believe that in these environments, we release some
intangible essence of ourselves. some call it the "vibe". whether i'm
dancing or just sitting in the corner alone, i'm trying to take in
that vibe, that energy and broadcast my own. that's why i go: to
connect.

also--and i'm not being wry when i say this--i like being in a crowd
that's not drunk.

i'm a quiet guy, i spend most of my time alone, but a rave is just
about the only place i feel comfortable in a room full of people. they
are chances to step outside myself and, you know, just fill up a dozen
water bottles, hand them out to strangers and say, "hi, i usually keep
to myself, but..."

Subject: Re: [sfraves] The rave scene and what it's all about?

haha, good memory. yes, that was me, the new guy. my mind was blown
and i just wanted to talk to some people who understood. i remember
you welcomed me warmly.

i also remember looking at the flyers i got from my first party (dots,
2005) and thinking, "10pm to 6am? nobody would stay awake that long.
this is ridiculous!"

some tips:

1) pee before you go inside

2) buy water before you're thirsty

3) have pockets with zippers/buttons

4) bring a pen and paper

5) read about 5-HTP

6) think about your experiences! reflect, integrate, grow, teach

7) do not tell the toll booth operator we are all beings of pure light

justin, send me an email if you want to meet up one weekend.

Thought the venue had a neat clandestine feel to it, with Security Master 
Tenchi at the gate and low lighting outside. Inside, wow, Terry's visuals were 
really pretty. Pretty decorations. That was a very nice setup. I loved the bank 
of 27+ computer monitors in front of the DJs, with flowers set on top of them 
and between them. 

That mean guy Osric was there, scowling at everybody. Grrrr. I did meet some 
nice people, though. I was tired and stayed in one place most of the time, but 
I enjoyed the music and the atmosphere. I enjoyed the set by Marc(o) and Bam 
a lot. 

Who else went? 
JonnyR

Subject: Re: [sfraves] OBSOLEET - who went, how'd you like it, etc? 

Sitting here at work this morning, still groggy from
Saturday nights events I just can't stop smiling.

I want to thank each and everyone of the people who
attended. Without you there would have been no party,
and there would have been no great vibe. Thanks to the
people who hung out with me and made me smile and
laugh all night. You guys made my party.

Thanks to Scott Hampton for going to that punk party
down the street and promoting with me. :D And thanks
to Tina, after we found out it was the wrong party,
driving us to the club down the street hehe. You guys
definitely made it fun!

Thanks to SE/30 for zooming me back to the bart
station Sunday morning! LOL Crazy Mofo!!!!

Thank you Dragn'fly and Terri for remiscing with me
about the old days in Sac. LOL So good to see you guys
there. You have been there through my whole raving
"career", and I love you guys<3

And last but not least, thanks to all the old heads
who made it out. Seeing you again is like being
reunited with family, and I love you all.

This party has made me feel alive inside again. I
haven't felt this way in a long time. It was magical.
I'm so happy I feel satisfied with the scene again.
Its so addicting and great. I'm still totally high off
of it. Yay for raving! I love you guys!

FUCKING PLUR!!!!!

Subject: [sfraves] Obsoleet - whew! (and photos)

i have been a part of many, many events.  i think with evil breaks
alone, i've thrown nearly 20 events in the past 2 years or so (jesus,
that's kinda scary).

but this was one of the prouder moments i've had.  this was a class
act crew and a spot on party.  i mean rave.   it was a rave god
damnit.

i probably said this when i was drunk and babbling, but to chris jax,
justin hale, andyw and li...you guys are my vinyl slaying heros.  that
was some serious choonage you done thrown down.

and now, photos from veanne:

It was my pleasure to tag with you again Brandon (we always seem to play 
some rad shit together), and an even bigger pleasure to have played for the 
SFRP folks. They all did an OUTSTANDING job with this party. I'm super 
impressed with how quickly they put togetehr the quality party that 
happened. Sick.

My hat is off...

Raised in Vienna and schooled in the ways of quality techno in Dallas
in the late 90's, Bernhard Pucher has been DJing and producing for
some of the world's most respected labels (including his own Iron Box
Music) for nearly a decade. These days he lives in London and, when
not performing throughout the world, creates electro/industrial-tinged
tracks as Confutatis, moody minimal techno as EchoPilot, and
deliciously sinister dancefloor tech-house as Brian Aneurysm. Catch
his unique style in this SF debut performance.  www.briananeurysm.com


plus special guest just added!


JASON SHORT  (aka DJ Sattva)

Recent Miami transplant Jason Short (formerly known as DJ Sattva)
caught our attention last year when we heard some of his outstanding
DJ mixes.  His heady, deep, and dirty blend of minimal and tech-house
has landed him recent slots opening for Matthew Dear and DJ Traxx, as
well as a permanent spot on the always-solid FunkyCozy roster, the
collective that's brought SF the likes of Damian Lazarus, Pier Bucci,
Matt Tolfrey and many more.  www.funkycozy.com

==== BIOGRAPHY ====

Bernhard Pucher has been producing electronic music for almost a
decade. He started buying records in '96 and ended up getting into
production within the same year. Inspired by the local dance
community, he started working on his craft in his home town of Vienna,
Austria.

In 1998, he moved to Dallas, Texas where he experienced a completely
new environment for electronic music. He met a lot of people who were
not just into dance, but also into more experimental forms of
electronica, including down tempo, industrial, breaks, and hard
techno. This new environment shaped his style, and with the help of
his friend Stefan Anion, he started getting into playing live as well.

But by 2000, a drastic shift happened. He started teaming up with
mutual techno lover Eric Estornel (aka Maetrik, Mariel Ito) who then
introduced him to a form of music he had not properly experienced
until then: Minimal and Electro. That influenced his musical style so
much that by 2001 he started his own label IRON BOX MUSIC. With his
background in industrial and heavy metal, his minimal sound started to
take shape in its own way.

In 2005, his journey brought him to London, by then with many
releases, remixes and appearances under his belt on labels like Ai
Records, Sub-Static, Spectral, Traum, Morris Audio, Ware, Onitor,
Poker Flat, Tangent Beats, and of course his own label, Iron Box
Music.

==== REVIEWS ====

Brian Aneurysm - Succubus - Sub-Static

Sub Static return with humorously named Brian Aneurysm who drops 4
tracks of straight up techno hijinks for the heads. Brian hails from
Texas - past releases have been on his own, so hot it hurts, Iron Box
techouse label, as well as Poker Flat and Ware. After his venomously
brilliant double ep "Amplified" (sub static #28), the Texan has now
upgraded his sharp-edged techno funk wrecks to an ugly assed nasty
jacker on the title cut, which doesn't even have to be played
backwards to spread its seductive poison. Diabolic stuff, and great
material for the more darkside inclined clubsound. Damaging.

Echopilot - Fragile EP - Morris Audio CitySport Edition

Produced by Brian Pucher (aka Brian Aneurysm) under his Echopilot
guise, this is akin to taking one part minimal Richie Hawtin and one
part quirky Derrick Carter and one part silky Timewriter; and blending
them together into a deep, minimal concoction.  Simple rhythms,
eclectic (and sometimes disturbing) vocal samples, jazzy stabs and a
ton of atmosphere come together to take you on a journey through the
mind of a mad scientist. This is about as funky and tricked out as
anything you are likely to hear, and one of the best productions of
the year to this point. Exquisite Stuff.

Brian Aneurysm - The End of Logic - Iron Box Music

Bernard Pucher comes back under his alias Brian Aneurysm, opening the
year harder than ever before with a minimal techno stomper. He is
known for his dark and twisted minimal, but on this record, he
combines that with his love for good old techno, and creates an
energy-laden EP called THE END OF LOGIC. The original is distorted,
thick and crunchy with a twisted vocal ...you know, the kind we've
come to love from Brian Aneurysm. The B-Side offers 2dollarEgg-style
thump tracks that combine great production with minimal flavour
resulting in dancefloor mania.

So what.... ;P

http://www.egregious.net/media/
for a bunch of sets over the years...  Recommended: The EGR 8 Year set.. 
This is the real stuff..

I also drop the minimal & electrotech; though I like those areas at times 
it seems they are the extent to which most Bay Area peeps can handle... oh 
does it go further than that!

Vegas / Defcon this year was really fun...  Hopefully I'll get the 
recording back soon. Got some of the best DJ photos yet...  And got some 
interest from folks all over the place regarding techno and the surround 
stuff I'm into..
Some picts here:
http://www.egregious.net/events/2006/defcon14/

For a nice reprieve... Do check out Soma-Tech II, a free underground in 
downtown SF Sat / August 19th. I'll be dropping some tasty new 
industrial-techno roughly 12:30am to 1:30am...

I hope the hell I live in SF "proper" out here on Ocean Beach.  Otherwise the thousands of dollars in property taxes I pay each year to the alleged SF tax assessor (who just raised the assessment) must be going somewhere improper ;-)

Hey Hey,

I'm going to be in the Chicago area soon and I was
wondering if any of you knew any resources as to where
I could find a good party while I'm there. I tried to
subscribe to midwest raves through hyperreal but no
go. Any suggestions as to sites to check out for
events, or venues?

Whatever you do, hit up the Green Dolphin Room on a Monday night for the
longest-running deep house night in the city. Diz rocked it when I was there
last week.

Also, The Note has good music on Thursdays, and Smartbar has Tintonton on
thursday & Jon Tejada this Friday.

Good luck, and have lots of fun. I totally dig Chicago.

Chicago doesn't have many raves anymore...they all end up getting shut
down.  Check out midwestraves.com - you might be able to find something
there.  I just moved out a here a year ago from Chicago...I'll be back there
for a couple weeks at the end of this month - when will you be back there?

I can ask my friends if they have heard of anything big going down...

If there were to be a ug, it would be probably be in the ghetto or the burbs
(like Harvey).

I'm going to be there the weekend of the 8th - 12th of
September. I would prefer an underground cuz I would
love to check out the scene, but any club night would
do as well.

Thanks for the pointers!

I typed the wrong link - sorry about that, it's actually midwestravers.com

I'm leaving Chicago on September 9th...too bad.  I will ask around though
for you and let you know of anything.  Are you going to be alone or with a
group of friends??

(don't want to send you to a scary part of town alone)

Haven't been Peter.  Sounds good.  Also, if you like Cajun try Cajun

Muther fuck.  Why did you have to remind me.  CP has been missing from my 
life, I am shit (used to live some 10 blocks away).

I'm totally gonna go this weekend, and load up on jalapeno cornbread, 
refried turkey, some southern sides and anchor steam.

I LOVE THAT PLACE SO MUCH.  They invited me over for their party they 
throw during Bay to Breakers last year, so frikking awesome.  Earthy as 
possible ambience with completely off-the-chain food.  The main guy that 
runs it is a CCA grad who just loves to cook, loves southern culture and 
honestly just seems to love life.

Also, check on the counter, to the right there is an ancient Xerox copy of 
a recipie book that is the most incredible thing I have ever seen as far 
as cooking books go.  Squirrel head pie, how to clean and hang a racoon 
and other classics.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] chicago raves?

Damn I just got back from Chicago last night!

It was great. Chicago is an amazing city. I haven't been there since 99 and 
boy did my memory not serve me well. I am thoroughly impressed.  Played a 
small club on thursday (which reminded me of many smaller SF clubs) called 
Vertigo.  The whole bar was painted in themes of Hitchcock movies (Birds, 
Vertigo, North by Northwest, hitchcock himself) it was awesome.

Then I played in the Penthouse of "Vision" on Saturday.  That club was 
amazing.  5 stories packed full of people.  Armin Van Horn who I'd never 
heard of was playing in the main room and he deffinatly rocked it.  I would 
say if you are going to be in Chicago don't miss this place.  Also from what 
some of my friends in Chicago say don't miss "Sound Bar".  Its a bit more 
upscale, but super dope.  We walked by it but didn't go it.

Chicago has a huge day party coming up that goes from Noon to Midnight with 
the likes of Tiesto, Deep Dish, Dave Clarke, Bad Boy Bill,  Benny Benassi, 
Junkie XL and more.  The event is called PURENATION and is on September 2nd.

Sander Kleinenberg is playing Vision on August 19th, Theres a campout called 
"Outlawed and Ecstatic present Campout" that looks pretty good thats on 
September 2-3.

And dont' forget Earthdance is on September 15,16, & 17th.

A few sites to check out would be www.midwest-edm.com also 
www.midwest-underground.com there's some good info on those forums.

:)

Jaron's World: The Murder of Mystery

How Silicon Valley joined the superstitious fringe as the enemy of =20
open inquiry.

By Jaron Lanier

DISCOVER Vol. 27 No. 09 | September 2006

Last week I had a jarring conversation with one of the most =20
influential figures in Silicon Valley. Me: I wish more kids were =20
learning to be musicians. He: In 10 years computers will be able to =20
use a combination of artificial intelligence and massed data from the =20=

Internet to generate music better than human musicians. We can =20
already use these techniques to choose hit songs more accurately than =20=

record executives. Musicianship will be an obsolete profession by the =20=

time today's kids grow up. There might be good reasons to teach kids =20
music, but creating a new generation of professional musicians is not =20=

one of them.

This was one of those moments when I wondered at what's become of =20
computer culture. The remark was the kind of thing Marvin Minsky, the =20=

legendary MIT professor and one of the fathers of artificial =20
intelligence, used to say to me when I was a young researcher to piss =20=

me off and make me think. But there were unmistakable layers of humor =20=

and irony in Marvin's provocations. Many of today's Silicon Valley =20
thought leaders seem to have embraced what used to be speculations as =20=

certainties, without the spirit of unbounded curiosity that =20
originally gave rise to them.

Ideas that used to be tucked away in the obscure world of artificial =20
intelligence labs have gone mainstream in tech culture. The basic =20
tenet of this new culture is that all of reality, including humans, =20
is one big information system. The meaning of life, in this view, is =20
making that system function at ever-higher "levels of description." =20
People pretend to know what "levels of description" means, though I =20
doubt anyone really does. A Web page is thought to represent a higher =20=

level of description than a single letter, while a brain is a higher =20
level than a Web page. An increasingly common extension of this =20
notion is that the Net as a whole is or soon will be a higher level =20
than a brain.

There's nothing special about the place of humans in this scheme. =20
Soon computers will get so big and fast and the Net so rich with =20
information that we will be obsolete, either left behind or subsumed =20
into some cyber-superhuman something.

Silicon Valley culture has recently taken to enshrining this abstract =20=

idea and spreading it in a novel way. Since implementation speaks =20
louder than words, ideas can be spread in the designs of software. If =20=

you believe the distinction between the roles of people and computers =20=

is starting to dissolve, you might express that, as some friends of =20
mine at Microsoft once did, by designing features for a word =20
processor that are supposed to know what you want, such as when you =20
want to start an outline. You might have had the experience of having =20=

Word suddenly determine that you are creating an indented outline at =20
the wrong moment. While I am all for the automation of petty tasks, =20
this is different. =46rom my point of view this type of design feature =20=

is nonsense, since you end up having to learn more than you would =20
otherwise in order to manipulate such software's expectations of you. =20=

The real function of the feature isn't to make life easier=97it is to =20=

express a new philosophy.

For decades I've been complaining about antihuman computer culture, =20
and I frequently end up attracting some unwelcome allies. I seek to =20
influence young technical people=97and I think I have been able to do =20=

that=97but I also seem to excite some other folks who get it all wrong. =20=

I'm not the slightest bit Luddite. I don't believe that something =20
natural is necessarily any more meaningful or true than something =20
artificial. I'm actually a raving technological utopian!

A description of my particular utopian thinking will have to wait for =20=

another month's column, but I believe the most beautiful =20
possibilities come from treating people as mysterious wells of =20
meaning and using technology to find new ways to connect people to =20
each other. The important point is that while I'm willing to go very =20
far in imagining what information technology might be like in the =20
future, I don't assume that I know quite what a person is, and =20
therefore I don't attempt to reduce personhood in my designs.

These days I feel as though I'm walking on a tightrope, with a crowd =20
of ravenous faux robotic nerds on one side and a gaggle of =20
sentimental antiquarians on the other. I try not to fall to either side.

In a sense, this is a continuation of old battles sparked by the =20
Enlightenment. You can imagine some of the traditional religious =20
enemies of the Enlightenment on one side of the rope. The least =20
likable have always been those driven by the power that comes from =20
perpetuating church empires built on the fear of death. This was and =20
remains the setup for popes and bishops who would bother to persecute =20=

a Galileo or ridicule a Darwin.

Of course, there are also many religious or spiritual people who =20
understandably wonder about questions related to death and who worry =20
whether meaning, beauty, and other deeply human qualities can survive =20=

the cold scrutiny of rational inquiry. If a new technologically =20
informed worldview isn't attractive to such people, I think =20
technologists ought to change their culture to make it more =20
welcoming, and that is particularly true for product designers.

There are also lunatics congregating on the other side of the =20
tightrope: those who are treating the mere appearance of rationality =20
as a fetish. Communists loved to overrule science, for instance, even =20=

though they cloaked themselves in language and even clothing styles =20
that were supposed to evoke rationality. In the Soviet Union, the =20
ideas of Trofim Lysenko, an anti-Darwinian pseudoscientist, were =20
preferred over reality, contributing to disastrous agricultural =20
policies. Similar things are happening today when business interests =20
suppress global-warming research.

You can always tell when an idea comes from fake rationalists. The =20
telltale sign is a premature decline in mystery, specifically the =20
kind of mystery that can be tackled through testable hypotheses. =20
Intelligent design falls into this category. If you believe a =20
biological structure is nothing more than a fashion decision made by =20
God (or an alien), there's nothing you can do to explain it beyond =20
that; you're done. While it might at first seem to enshrine mystery, =20
intelligent design actually insulates us from the endless, intriguing =20=

mysteries of nature by providing one answer in advance for everything.

It would have been possible to treat Darwin's insights in exactly the =20=

same way. A lazy, nonscientific Darwinian could say "Everything =20
evolved" and be done with it. Some of my misguided colleagues do just =20=

that when they say things like, "Computers will inevitably evolve to =20
correct flaws in our posthuman visions, such as the fact that =20
software is endlessly buggy and needs to be fixed by human programmers."

The reason Darwin's ideas are so powerful is that there was another =20
option. His ideas opened a type of path not opened by intelligent =20
design: methodically challenging the initial base of ideas and =20
refining it until it becomes something far more specific and useful. =20
Biology benefited from an intellectual revolution provided by Darwin =20
but has in many ways left him behind. Biologists now deal in genes, =20
viruses, and a world of other objects and ideas Darwin didn't know =20
about.

Lately the problem of premature mystery reduction has cropped up more =20=

than once within technical cultures. The tone taken by some string =20
theorists reminds me of what I'm criticizing in recent Silicon Valley =20=

thinking (see "Tangled Up in Strings" on page 68).

Is reality a giant information system and people just arbitrarily =20
defined portions of it? Wrong question! Information theory is =20
tremendously useful, but it doesn't tell us anything until it's been =20
used. The idea that you might someday understand something is =20
different from actually understanding it, or even knowing the right =20
questions to ask. The big idea behind the new fake rationality is so =20
diffuse that it's useless, except as a cultural badge.

That brings me back to my misguided colleague and his ideas about the =20=

future of music. There are a multitude of mysteries prematurely =20
reduced by his point of view. We don't know what music is, exactly. =20
We don't know much about how the brain works. We don't even have good =20=

experimental methods to tell when we're bending over backward to make =20=

a computer merely seem smart.

If I really believed that science was reducing the mystery of life, I =20=

would feel claustrophobic, but just the opposite is true. The more =20
science I learn, the more mysteries I learn about, and the richer =20
life becomes. I wonder if a technical culture that was better at =20
avoiding premature claims of mystery reduction would find more =20
friends among the sensitive, "spiritual" people I referred to =20
earlier. Some extreme religious people will probably never embrace =20
science, but I often wonder if the harshness of the way some =20
scientists talk about the nerd future is driving reasonable people away.

Avoiding a premature decline in mystery is also a great principle for =20=

making better software. You don't have to pretend to know what music =20
is to give musicians new ways to work together, but you do have to =20
believe that human musicians are important. The genuinely radical =20
ideas in computer science come when people work honestly within the =20
boundaries of what we don't know.

    Cajun food? In San Francisco? Don't kid yourselves. The only real 
Cajun food is served in little dirty ass shacks in rural Louisiana by 
dirty ass Cajun people that say things like "sha." So, unless your food 
is covered in spices and has been cooked by someone who thinks 60,000 
people in a swamp constitutes a big city and contains crawfish in some 
way, it's not real Cajun food. It's a bastardized Californian version of it.

    Sorry for the rant, but being from Louisiana I've eaten a lot of 
Cajun food, and I can say with a fairly high degree of certainty that 
you can't find the real stuff out here.

    Fools.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] The rave scene and what it's all about?

    Even if the food is cooked exactly the same way it's still not the 
same. The ambiance is different, you don't get the same culture. 
Further, the air and water are different here, which has a big impact on 
the way food is going to taste. You may have had *some* crawfish out 
here, but it probably wasn't included in almost every dish. And even if 
you've had crawfish here, it's not the same as crawfish that was pulled 
out of the swamp the same day you're eating it.

    I also seriously doubt you've ever had boudain here, which is 
another Cajun staple.

    Lookit, I lived in Louisiana for seventeen years, I know all about 
some Cajun food and culture. The food is just not the same without the 
culture. You can't get the culture with your food out here. Not that you 
can even get properly cooked Cajun food here.

I had such a great time at Obsoleet! The whole night felt like a lesson in
SF Rave history, and indeed I was schooled. Sorry I missed your set, Marco =
=96
now I owe *you* dinner. Thanks to Bam for introducing me to so many people,
Justin Hale for talking me into my little indiscretion, and Osby for taking
the money shot. AndyW tastes like techno.

The lineup was dope =96 not very often I get to hear so many genres at one
party (oh and the sound was good too) and I danced all night. Huuuuge love
to the Fingermonsters =96 together you form a super house robot. We must ma=
ke
you voltron-like interlocking costumes. And yes, Heaven Scent was the
perfect end to the dance party.

Double yeys for all the hardore people who made it out to dance in the park
on Sunday. Pomegranate mimosas are grate. Or something like that.
Props.

I'm thinking about hitting the GGL/Sunset underground...

Any other possibilities?

Anyone know anything about the two bands that are playing at that party?  Landshark and something else I forget.

Peace,

Peter

We've got an all night 80's party at Endup tonight.  Not a rave per se, but 
it does go from 9pm - 6am and then right into T-dance all day until Super 
soul sunday ay 8pm until 4am...

So, sat night to monday morning straight through is fairly rave minded...  ;)

Another option for Saturday...

Brian Aneurysm (aka EchoPilot) @ Kontrol, Rx Gallery

Check out this track!  If you dig it, you'll probably like the music.
It's just like a 2 minute teaser (small file) but you'll get the idea.
I personally think this is one of the sickest cuts to come out in
awhile! (It's actually from 2003 I think, but I just stumbled across
it last year.)

http://www.kontrolsf.com/AUD/EchoPilot_-_Emptiness.mp3

minimal techno and tech-house.
deep, dark, heavy, and pretty.

good shit.

Shatter I'm probably heading underground, but the End Up is always on my list.  You never know when you'll, err, end up there.

However, since I'm in a bitchy mood and need rant about something, I have to say I don't get the whole 80s night thing.  

I used to go out dancing in the eighties in LA and I heard most of this stuff 10 million times.  It wasn't that great.  Bleh.

I don't get it either, but when it packs 500-600 into the house, who's 
complaining.

What was funny last year was that it wa sthe first year that people born in 
1984 could actually go to 1984 at Cat Club thursdays.

Figure that one out.

Dare I say it on SF Raves, but .... in addition to these fun club events and 
live shows and whatnot ...  there actually is a RAVE Saturday night and nobody 
has mentioned it. It's put on by the same people who did Scooby Snax 1 and 2. 
The lineup includes Crackerjack, Go-Zania, Michael Liu, Liam Shy, Sideshow, 
and a bunch of other people. The Info Line (updated) is (925) 262-8217.  It'll 
be a full house, I'm sure.

I'd heard about this one...anyone have any info on the promoters?   I'm not too excited about the $20 door charge.  

I also note the info line is 925, does that mean this is in Contra Costa somewhere?  I don't think I'm going to be driving over there...

Peter

P.S. What's with the Scooby Do references?  Isn't that played out yet?

Subject: Re: [sfraves] lovefest blog coverage

Evil Breaks, Strategik and Afterdark will be having a rocking float in
the parade.  Just wait until you see what we've got.  I promise, it
will blow your mind.

And afterwards, Evil Breaks, Opel and Tantra will be throwing an
incredible afterparty at Somarts with a mind blowing lineup of breaks,
progressive house and psytrance.

Content-Type: text/plain; charset="US-ASCII"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Hi, I know a lot of you are into graphic arts and might have a favorite 
printer to recommend (preferably East Bay). 

I designed a color brochure for a small business. Just a simple 8.5 x 11 
sheet folded in two places, color on both sides, on white stock. I used Corel 
Print House and saved to Photoshop PSD format. (Unfortunately I don't have 
Photoshop itself or any actual professional design programs. I'm just an amateur 
helping out a small business.)  

The client is looking for a quote on:
100 brochures
500 brochures (or whatever number gets a better price than 100 brochures)

Thanks, pls email me at jonnyr@aol.com  if you have any recommendations. 
JR

Raised in Vienna and schooled in the ways of quality techno in Dallas
in the late 90's, Bernhard Pucher has been DJing and producing for
some of the world's most respected labels (including his own Iron Box
Music) for nearly a decade. These days he lives in London and, when
not performing throughout the world, creates electro/industrial-tinged
tracks as Confutatis, moody minimal techno as EchoPilot, and
deliciously sinister dancefloor tech-house as Brian Aneurysm. Catch
his unique style in this SF debut performance.  www.briananeurysm.com


plus special guest just added!


JASON SHORT  (aka Sattva)

funkycozy . coalition of the killing . auralism records

Recent Miami transplant Jason Short (formerly known as Sattva) caught
our attention last year when we heard some of his outstanding DJ
mixes.  His heady, deep, and dirty blend of minimal and tech-house has
landed him recent slots opening for Damian Lazarus and DJ Traxx, as
well as a permanent spot on the always-solid FunkyCozy roster, the
collective that's brought SF the likes of Pier Bucci, Matt Tolfrey,
Damian Lazarus and many more.  www.funkycozy.com

==== BIOGRAPHIES ====


BRIAN ANEURYSM

Bernhard Pucher has been producing electronic music for almost a
decade.  He started buying records in '96 and ended up getting into
production within the same year.  Inspired by the local dance
community, he started working on his craft in his home town of Vienna,
Austria.  In 1998, he moved to Dallas, Texas where he experienced a
completely new environment for electronic music.  He met a lot of
people who were not just into dance, but also into more experimental
forms of electronica, including down tempo, industrial, breaks, and
hard techno.  This new environment shaped his style, and with the help
of his friend Stefan Anion, he started getting into playing live as
well.  But by 2000, a drastic shift happened. He started teaming up
with mutual techno lover Eric Estornel (aka Maetrik, Mariel Ito) who
then introduced him to a form of music he had not properly experienced
until then: Minimal and Electro. That influenced his musical style so
much that by 2001 he started his own label IRON BOX MUSIC. With his
background in industrial and heavy metal, his minimal sound started to
take shape in its own way.  In 2005, his journey brought him to
London, by then with many releases, remixes and appearances under his
belt on labels like Ai Records, Sub-Static, Spectral, Traum, Morris
Audio, Ware, Onitor, Poker Flat, Tangent Beats, and of course his own
label, Iron Box Music.


JASON SHORT

Jason Short began spinning and producing underground dance music in
1997 in San Francisco.  He soon after relocated to Florida, where he
earned a degree in Recording Engineering and began producing with some
friends as Biogenesis.  His productions caught the attention of
Xplosion and Nepol Records, and eight releases and several remixes
followed. After obtaining his degree, Jason wanted to return to the
roots of house music and moved to Chicago in 2001.  Inspired and
focused, he flourished in the studio and soon found himself djing all
over Chicago.  In 2002, Jason met Hac Le while fighting over the same
vinyl at world famous Gramaphone Records. The two immediately formed a
synergistic musical bond and began dropping mean 2x6x2 (2 mixers 6
turntables 2 djs) tag-team sets which quickly gained them critical
acclaim and a monthly residency in Mexico City with Global Trip.  In
2003, Jason headed to Miami to reconnect with Marc Smith of Biognesis
and work on their next project, Coaltion of the Killing, and develop
their new label, Auralism Records.  He has spent the past two years
honing his skills as a musician, dj, producer, and engineer, traveling
regularly to play with the FunkyCozy crew in San Francisco.  His
vibrations from the decks range from twisted, bass-heavy, floor-moving
techno to flowing, melodic, glitchy downtempo and experimental.  The
sounds are psychedelic and deep, glistening with serotonin-inducing
shimmers and infectious rhythms that push your body into motion.

==== REVIEWS ====

Brian Aneurysm - Succubus - Sub-Static

Sub Static return with humorously named Brian Aneurysm who drops 4
tracks of straight up techno hijinks for the heads. Brian hails from
Texas - past releases have been on his own, so hot it hurts, Iron Box
techouse label, as well as Poker Flat and Ware. After his venomously
brilliant double ep "Amplified" (sub static #28), the Texan has now
upgraded his sharp-edged techno funk wrecks to an ugly assed nasty
jacker on the title cut, which doesn't even have to be played
backwards to spread its seductive poison. Diabolic stuff, and great
material for the more darkside inclined clubsound. Damaging.

Echopilot - Fragile EP - Morris Audio CitySport Edition

Produced by Brian Pucher (aka Brian Aneurysm) under his Echopilot
guise, this is akin to taking one part minimal Richie Hawtin and one
part quirky Derrick Carter and one part silky Timewriter; and blending
them together into a deep, minimal concoction.  Simple rhythms,
eclectic (and sometimes disturbing) vocal samples, jazzy stabs and a
ton of atmosphere come together to take you on a journey through the
mind of a mad scientist. This is about as funky and tricked out as
anything you are likely to hear, and one of the best productions of
the year to this point. Exquisite Stuff.

Brian Aneurysm - The End of Logic - Iron Box Music

Bernard Pucher comes back under his alias Brian Aneurysm, opening the
year harder than ever before with a minimal techno stomper. He is
known for his dark and twisted minimal, but on this record, he
combines that with his love for good old techno, and creates an
energy-laden EP called THE END OF LOGIC. The original is distorted,
thick and crunchy with a twisted vocal ...you know, the kind we've
come to love from Brian Aneurysm. The B-Side offers 2dollarEgg-style
thump tracks that combine great production with minimal flavour
resulting in dancefloor mania.

Subject: [sfraves] burning man ride/camp?

hi people,

this my situation: i have my ticket for burning man, but i don't know
anyone else who is going. this means i have no ride, no camp, no
anything (except, you know, the gear). last year (my first time) my
plans came together at the last minute, but this year--not as much
good fortune. so i'm looking for someone or a group to go with. anyone
want to scoop me up? i'm totally eager to contribute
gas/food/supplies/glowsticks/etc. oh, and chocolate. i work for a
small company that makes artisan chocolate, brownies, marshmallows,
graham crackers (playa s'mores!)... all kinds of yummy stuff. i'm also
a semi-pro photographer with pro equipment. i would document all the
goings-on and give everyone CDs. anyway, yeah, that's me. i live in
san francisco. if you want to call me, my phone number is 443-506-8970
(that's a baltimore area code).

Subject: [sfraves] OH yeah... late WR's: Full Melt, Telic Day Party,

So a few weeks back, when i la la la la la la la about Full Melt.. well.
.it was a Dope night.. i have to admit.. it was Reallyl Dope... & yes.. I
did bartend for 1/2 that night ;)  I mean... i kinda got mondo yucky 1.2
way through the night, & kinda got put outta commision.. literally :(

But before that.. it was Dope... I mean... like i got there early for set
up.. set up my bar... what was mondo way Groovy Bad Ass was well.. me &
Ripple went to go pick up the headliners, Pinch & Distance, @ the radio
station... then after that.. we went out to eat @ McD's (the line @ In N
OUt was way long) & for like an hour.. we just like talked & ate & like
Pinch & Distance.. really Awesome "English Mates" :)

Now the trippy part about the party was... the main room was aaaaaall
Grime & Dubstep... I mean.. 1 DJ threw down some 2 Step in the middle of
his set.... I think that was SubTek... but it was just trippy... & every1
who was there was totally feelin' it:)  The 2nd room had breaks & that was
fun :)  It was a Dope party & like aalmost eeeveryone from every scene was
there almost :)

Oh yeah.. there's pictures of me & my sisters in the album 'cause there

Statyed there 'til about like 8 something & like Ms DJ D gave me a ride to
Oakland where i went to the OtherWorld Shindig for the Label Record

OK.. 1st off.. this Dude i met like a year & 1/2 ago, Uriah, who i talk to

Bobby Burgess <bobbyburgess@gmail.com> wrote: hi people,

this my situation: i have my ticket for burning man, but i don't know
anyone else who is going. this means i have no ride, no camp, no
anything (except, you know, the gear). last year (my first time) my
plans came together at the last minute, but this year--not as much
good fortune. so i'm looking for someone or a group to go with. anyone
want to scoop me up? i'm totally eager to contribute
gas/food/supplies/glowsticks/etc. oh, and chocolate. i work for a
small company that makes artisan chocolate, brownies, marshmallows,
graham crackers (playa s'mores!)... all kinds of yummy stuff. i'm also
a semi-pro photographer with pro equipment. i would document all the
goings-on and give everyone CDs. anyway, yeah, that's me. i live in
san francisco. if you want to call me, my phone number is 443-506-8970

Full Melt.. probably one of the sickest parties I have been to in a long 
time.. could not tear myself away from the main room for more than 5 
minutes.  Ripple's set was one of the most amazing sets I have ever heard, 
period.  The K probably helped.. but ya.. it was wicked fucking good shit!

My favorite part of the night was around 5am.. the walls were all blacked 
out, no light, co2 pumping into the room, lasers going off in every 
direction, music dripping from the ceiling in tangible sticky ways.. and 
then there was this one woman, cute as hell, in braids and a little school 
girl dress.. prancing around like she was on a horse.  I like to call her 
PonyGirl.  At one point she was galloping in place in front of me, looking 
back to make sure I noticed, and then galloped off.. omg.. I just wanted to 
ride her so bad..lol!

Ya.. I was fully melted after that night.. drivin home at 6am :)

Episode 15!  Can you believe it?

We're looking forward to another killer show!

Expect some deep, dark, heavy, pretty and intense minimal techno and
tech-house blended together in a very unique way.  Fans of our Troy Pierce
show in January will definitely dig!  If you're not afraid of a little
darkness in your funk, you're in for quite a treat. Make sure to check out
the ridiculously awesome EchoPilot track (in the audio section below) to get
a taste of what you're in for.

Also of note is that the art this month is really worth seeing!  Great
stuff.

Hope to see some of you there.

morris audio . immigrant . triebstoff . tic tac toe

Raised in Vienna and schooled in the ways of quality techno in Dallas in the
late 90's, Bernhard Pucher has been DJing and producing for some of the
world's most respected labels (including his own Iron Box Music) for nearly
a decade. These days he lives in London and, when not performing throughout
the world, creates electro/industrial-tinged tracks as Confutatis, moody
minimal techno as EchoPilot, and deliciously sinister dancefloor tech-house
as Brian Aneurysm. Catch his unique style in this SF debut performance.

plus special guest just added!


JASON SHORT  (aka Sattva)

Recent Miami transplant Jason Short (formerly known as Sattva) caught our
attention last year when we heard some of his outstanding DJ mixes.  His
heady, deep, and dirty blend of minimal and tech-house has landed him recent
slots opening for Damian Lazarus and DJ Traxx, as well as a permanent spot
on the always-solid FunkyCozy roster, the collective that's brought SF the
likes of Pier Bucci, Matt Tolfrey, Damian Lazarus and many more.

==== BIOGRAPHIES ====


BRIAN ANEURYSM

Bernhard Pucher has been producing electronic music for almost a decade.  He
started buying records in '96 and ended up getting into production within
the same year.  Inspired by the local dance community, he started working on
his craft in his home town of Vienna, Austria.  In 1998, he moved to Dallas,
Texas where he experienced a completely new environment for electronic
music.  He met a lot of people who were not just into dance, but also into
more experimental forms of electronica, including down tempo, industrial,
breaks, and hard techno.  This new environment shaped his style, and with
the help of his friend Stefan Anion, he started getting into playing live as
well.  But by 2000, a drastic shift happened. He started teaming up with
mutual techno lover Eric Estornel (aka Maetrik, Mariel Ito) who then
introduced him to a form of music he had not properly experienced until
then: Minimal and Electro. That influenced his musical style so much that by
2001 he started his own label IRON BOX MUSIC. With his background in
industrial and heavy metal, his minimal sound started to take shape in its
own way.  In 2005, his journey brought him to London, by then with many
releases, remixes and appearances under his belt on labels like Ai Records,
Sub-Static, Spectral, Traum, Morris Audio, Ware, Onitor, Poker Flat, Tangent
Beats, and of course his own label, Iron Box Music.


JASON SHORT

Jason Short began spinning and producing underground dance music in 1997 in
San Francisco.  He soon after relocated to Florida, where he earned a degree
in Recording Engineering and began producing with some friends as
Biogenesis.  His productions caught the attention of Xplosion and Nepol
Records, and eight releases and several remixes followed. After obtaining
his degree, Jason wanted to return to the roots of house music and moved to
Chicago in 2001.  Inspired and focused, he flourished in the studio and soon
found himself djing all over Chicago.  In 2002, Jason met Hac Le while
fighting over the same vinyl at world famous Gramaphone Records. The two
immediately formed a synergistic musical bond and began dropping mean 2x6x2
(2 mixers 6 turntables 2 djs) tag-team sets which quickly gained them
critical acclaim and a monthly residency in Mexico City with Global Trip.
In 2003, Jason headed to Miami to reconnect with Marc Smith of Biognesis and
work on their next project, Coaltion of the Killing, and develop their new
label, Auralism Records.  He has spent the past two years honing his skills
as a musician, dj, producer, and engineer, traveling regularly to play with
the FunkyCozy crew in San Francisco.  His vibrations from the decks range
from twisted, bass-heavy, floor-moving techno to flowing, melodic, glitchy
downtempo and experimental.  The sounds are psychedelic and deep, glistening
with serotonin-inducing shimmers and infectious rhythms that push your body
into motion.

==== REVIEWS ====

Brian Aneurysm - Succubus - Sub-Static

Sub Static return with humorously named Brian Aneurysm who drops 4 tracks of
straight up techno hijinks for the heads. Brian hails from Texas - past
releases have been on his own, so hot it hurts, Iron Box techouse label, as
well as Poker Flat and Ware. After his venomously brilliant double ep
"Amplified" (sub static #28), the Texan has now upgraded his sharp-edged
techno funk wrecks to an ugly assed nasty jacker on the title cut, which
doesn't even have to be played backwards to spread its seductive poison.
Diabolic stuff, and great material for the more darkside inclined clubsound.
Damaging.

Echopilot - Fragile EP - Morris Audio CitySport Edition

Produced by Brian Pucher (aka Brian Aneurysm) under his Echopilot guise,
this is akin to taking one part minimal Richie Hawtin and one part quirky
Derrick Carter and one part silky Timewriter; and blending them together
into a deep, minimal concoction.  Simple rhythms, eclectic (and sometimes
disturbing) vocal samples, jazzy stabs and a ton of atmosphere come together
to take you on a journey through the mind of a mad scientist. This is about
as funky and tricked out as anything you are likely to hear, and one of the
best productions of the year to this point. Exquisite Stuff.

Brian Aneurysm - The End of Logic - Iron Box Music

Bernard Pucher comes back under his alias Brian Aneurysm, opening the year
harder than ever before with a minimal techno stomper. He is known for his
dark and twisted minimal, but on this record, he combines that with his love
for good old techno, and creates an energy-laden EP called THE END OF LOGIC.
The original is distorted, thick and crunchy with a twisted vocal ...you
know, the kind we've come to love from Brian Aneurysm. The B-Side offers
2dollarEgg-style thump tracks that combine great production with minimal
flavour resulting in dancefloor mania.

Although I can walk to Stern Grove from my house, since we are going out tomorrow night I'm not sure I'll be doing much walking Sunday.  I think I might crawl over to Bunny Meadow for Shiska Beats later tho.

What does Marc(o) look like?  You can scope this picture: http://netamp.com/artists/marco.php but I'm not sure I would have recognized him from that.  

He'll be the guy carrying the whiskey. ;)

Peace,

Peter

Oh wait, here's a much more accurate photo: http://mylai.com/seered/morphis/obsoleet/images/DSC_0492.jpg

Sort of a cross between Elmo and Brad Pitt only with better facial hair. ;)

Although I can walk to Stern Grove from my house, since we are going out tomorrow night I'm not sure I'll be doing much walking Sunday.  I think I might crawl over to Bunny Meadow for Shiska Beats later tho.

What does Marc(o) look like?  You can scope this picture: http://netamp.com/artists/marco.php but I'm not sure I would have recognized him from that.  

He'll be the guy carrying the whiskey. ;)

Peace,

Peter

Subject: [sfraves] BSP:  Zombie Mob Saturday!!!!

--=====================_6729093==.ALT
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"


<http://eatbrains.com/>http://eatbrains.com/
 
The details: Saturday, Aug 19th, zombies will be storming the corner of Market and Sansome at 2:30p. We will then walk/limp/crawl to Powell Station by 3:00p. There will be a big massacre on Powell between Market and O'Farrel. We'll Pick up stragglers at Union Square by 3:30p. See the <http://eatbrains.com/mob2006/images/mobmap.jpg>Map 

How to participate: Plant yourself somewhere along our route. Show up in plain clothes minus anything of value. Wear a small piece of duct tape (or similar) clearly visible on your torso. Attract our attention somehow. (screaming "aaaiiieeee! zombies!" is good for this). We will attack you, cover you with blood, shred your clothes, and slip you a makeup kit so you can create new zombies. If you want to show up already in zombie gear, great. Just join the mob at any time. 

Rules - Don't attack people who haven't clearly indicated they want to be attacked. Don't get blood on bystanders or their things.

House Music 101:  http://livingart.com/raving/articles/housemusic101.htm

"Americans like to talk about (or be told about) Democracy but, when put to the test, usually find it to be an 'inconvenience.' We have opted instead for an authoritarian system disguised as a Democracy. We pay through the nose for an enormous joke-of-a-government, let it push us around, and then wonder how all those assholes got in there." - Frank Zappa 

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become visible."

Before burning man each year, several of us collect folks' 10 and 20 pound
racing nitrous tanks and fill them with pure environmentally friendly sulfur
free NO2 for off street racing purposes out at the black rock desert, or any
off street track. (vehicles on public roads are not permitted to have NO2
tanks installed to boost performance)

NO2 powered art cars with dedicated 10 and 20 pound tanks deliver much
greater performance gains than vehicles utilizing the tiny cream charger
storage devices which cost 5-10 times more.

If you are a "racing" fan and understand what we are providing for racers in
the bay area, please drop an email off list.

<http://eatbrains.com/>http://eatbrains.com/

The details: Saturday, Aug 19th, zombies will be storming the corner of
Market and Sansome at 2:30p. We will then walk/limp/crawl to Powell Station
by 3:00p. There will be a big massacre on Powell between Market and
O'Farrel. We'll Pick up stragglers at Union Square by 3:30p. See the <
http://eatbrains.com/mob2006/images/mobmap.jpg>Map

How to participate: Plant yourself somewhere along our route. Show up in
plain clothes minus anything of value. Wear a small piece of duct tape (or
similar) clearly visible on your torso. Attract our attention somehow.
(screaming "aaaiiieeee! zombies!" is good for this). We will attack you,
cover you with blood, shred your clothes, and slip you a makeup kit so you
can create new zombies. If you want to show up already in zombie gear,
great. Just join the mob at any time.

Rules - Don't attack people who haven't clearly indicated they want to be
attacked. Don't get blood on bystanders or their things.

tech-house blended together in a very unique way.  Fans of our Troy
Pierce show in January will definitely dig!  If you're not afraid of a
little darkness in your funk, you're in for quite a treat. Make sure
to check out the ridiculously awesome EchoPilot track (in the audio
section below) to get a taste of what you're in for.

Also of note is that the art this month is really worth seeing!  Great stuff.

Hope to see some of you there.

Raised in Vienna and schooled in the ways of quality techno in Dallas
in the late 90's, Bernhard Pucher has been DJing and producing for
some of the world's most respected labels (including his own Iron Box
Music) for nearly a decade. These days he lives in London and, when
not performing throughout the world, creates electro/industrial-tinged
tracks as Confutatis, moody minimal techno as EchoPilot, and
deliciously sinister dancefloor tech-house as Brian Aneurysm. Catch
his unique style in this SF debut performance.  www.briananeurysm.com


plus special guest just added!


JASON SHORT  (aka Sattva)

Recent Miami transplant Jason Short (formerly known as Sattva) caught
our attention last year when we heard some of his outstanding DJ
mixes.  His heady, deep, and dirty blend of minimal and tech-house has
landed him recent slots opening for Damian Lazarus and DJ Traxx, as
well as a permanent spot on the always-solid FunkyCozy roster, the
collective that's brought SF the likes of Pier Bucci, Matt Tolfrey,
Damian Lazarus and many more.  www.funkycozy.com

==== BIOGRAPHIES ====


BRIAN ANEURYSM

Bernhard Pucher has been producing electronic music for almost a
decade.  He started buying records in '96 and ended up getting into
production within the same year.  Inspired by the local dance
community, he started working on his craft in his home town of Vienna,
Austria.  In 1998, he moved to Dallas, Texas where he experienced a
completely new environment for electronic music.  He met a lot of
people who were not just into dance, but also into more experimental
forms of electronica, including down tempo, industrial, breaks, and
hard techno.  This new environment shaped his style, and with the help
of his friend Stefan Anion, he started getting into playing live as
well.  But by 2000, a drastic shift happened. He started teaming up
with mutual techno lover Eric Estornel (aka Maetrik, Mariel Ito) who
then introduced him to a form of music he had not properly experienced
until then: Minimal and Electro. That influenced his musical style so
much that by 2001 he started his own label IRON BOX MUSIC. With his
background in industrial and heavy metal, his minimal sound started to
take shape in its own way.  In 2005, his journey brought him to
London, by then with many releases, remixes and appearances under his
belt on labels like Ai Records, Sub-Static, Spectral, Traum, Morris
Audio, Ware, Onitor, Poker Flat, Tangent Beats, and of course his own
label, Iron Box Music.


JASON SHORT

Jason Short began spinning and producing underground dance music in
1997 in San Francisco.  He soon after relocated to Florida, where he
earned a degree in Recording Engineering and began producing with some
friends as Biogenesis.  His productions caught the attention of
Xplosion and Nepol Records, and eight releases and several remixes
followed. After obtaining his degree, Jason wanted to return to the
roots of house music and moved to Chicago in 2001.  Inspired and
focused, he flourished in the studio and soon found himself djing all
over Chicago.  In 2002, Jason met Hac Le while fighting over the same
vinyl at world famous Gramaphone Records. The two immediately formed a
synergistic musical bond and began dropping mean 2x6x2 (2 mixers 6
turntables 2 djs) tag-team sets which quickly gained them critical
acclaim and a monthly residency in Mexico City with Global Trip.  In
2003, Jason headed to Miami to reconnect with Marc Smith of Biognesis
and work on their next project, Coaltion of the Killing, and develop
their new label, Auralism Records.  He has spent the past two years
honing his skills as a musician, dj, producer, and engineer, traveling
regularly to play with the FunkyCozy crew in San Francisco.  His
vibrations from the decks range from twisted, bass-heavy, floor-moving
techno to flowing, melodic, glitchy downtempo and experimental.  The
sounds are psychedelic and deep, glistening with serotonin-inducing
shimmers and infectious rhythms that push your body into motion.

==== REVIEWS ====

Brian Aneurysm - Succubus - Sub-Static

Sub Static return with humorously named Brian Aneurysm who drops 4
tracks of straight up techno hijinks for the heads. Brian hails from
Texas - past releases have been on his own, so hot it hurts, Iron Box
techouse label, as well as Poker Flat and Ware. After his venomously
brilliant double ep "Amplified" (sub static #28), the Texan has now
upgraded his sharp-edged techno funk wrecks to an ugly assed nasty
jacker on the title cut, which doesn't even have to be played
backwards to spread its seductive poison. Diabolic stuff, and great
material for the more darkside inclined clubsound. Damaging.

Echopilot - Fragile EP - Morris Audio CitySport Edition

Produced by Brian Pucher (aka Brian Aneurysm) under his Echopilot
guise, this is akin to taking one part minimal Richie Hawtin and one
part quirky Derrick Carter and one part silky Timewriter; and blending
them together into a deep, minimal concoction.  Simple rhythms,
eclectic (and sometimes disturbing) vocal samples, jazzy stabs and a
ton of atmosphere come together to take you on a journey through the
mind of a mad scientist. This is about as funky and tricked out as
anything you are likely to hear, and one of the best productions of
the year to this point. Exquisite Stuff.

Brian Aneurysm - The End of Logic - Iron Box Music

Bernard Pucher comes back under his alias Brian Aneurysm, opening the
year harder than ever before with a minimal techno stomper. He is
known for his dark and twisted minimal, but on this record, he
combines that with his love for good old techno, and creates an
energy-laden EP called THE END OF LOGIC. The original is distorted,
thick and crunchy with a twisted vocal ...you know, the kind we've
come to love from Brian Aneurysm. The B-Side offers 2dollarEgg-style
thump tracks that combine great production with minimal flavour
resulting in dancefloor mania.

I'll be there with my wife.  I'm an old schooler without  much hair.

I think I'm going to wear a sort of redish orange shirt with some Buddhist monks on the front and like a swirly thingee...and my sweatshirt has the dharma protector Mahakala on the back.

So say hi!  We'll be on the dance floor around 12am...

Come on house heads I know you are out there.

Anyone else gonna be there?

Peace,

Peter

So say hi!  We'll be on the dance floor around 12am...

Come on house heads I know you are out there.

To: SFRaves@hyperreal.org


<http://eatbrains.com/>http://eatbrains.com/

The details: Saturday, Aug 19th, zombies will be storming the corner of
Market and Sansome at 2:30p. We will then walk/limp/crawl to Powell Station
by 3:00p. There will be a big massacre on Powell between Market and
O'Farrel. We'll Pick up stragglers at Union Square by 3:30p. See the <
http://eatbrains.com/mob2006/images/mobmap.jpg>Map

How to participate: Plant yourself somewhere along our route. Show up in
plain clothes minus anything of value. Wear a small piece of duct tape (or
similar) clearly visible on your torso. Attract our attention somehow.
(screaming "aaaiiieeee! zombies!" is good for this). We will attack you,
cover you with blood, shred your clothes, and slip you a makeup kit so you
can create new zombies. If you want to show up already in zombie gear,
great. Just join the mob at any time.

Rules - Don't attack people who haven't clearly indicated they want to be
attacked. Don't get blood on bystanders or their things.

"Americans like to talk about (or be told about) Democracy but, when put to
the test, usually find it to be an 'inconvenience.' We have opted instead
for an authoritarian system disguised as a Democracy. We pay through the
nose for an enormous joke-of-a-government, let it push us around, and then
wonder how all those assholes got in there." - Frank Zappa

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become
visible."
-Jacques Attali in his seminal text "Noise"

Subject: [sfraves] track ID

ok I think I have the track but im not sure? I may have just heard it a 
million times.

It's a house track sort of anthemish.. I guess somwhat Disco-ish as well. 
You would hear Dan or Glaude rocking it for sure.. The main chrous goes like 
this.

"Baby I don't know what I should do.... You *sure* make me feel like loving 
you"

Female Diva-esque vocal

Note: Not sure if it says **sure** or something else..

So yea House addicts holla atcha boy with the producer and track name.. I 
know one of you guys knows it or even has it.


Thx,

Macadio

"Americans like to talk about (or be told about) Democracy but, when put to the test, usually find it to be an 'inconvenience.' We have opted instead for an authoritarian system disguised as a Democracy. We pay through the nose for an enormous joke-of-a-government, let it push us around, and then wonder how all those assholes got in there." - Frank Zappa

"Americans like to talk about (or be told about) Democracy but, when put to the test, usually find it to be an 'inconvenience.' We have opted instead for an authoritarian system disguised as a Democracy. We pay through the nose for an enormous joke-of-a-government, let it push us around, and then wonder how all those assholes got in there." - Frank Zappa 

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become visible."
-Jacques Attali in his seminal text "Noise"

Memorial </a><br><br>
On August 21, 2005 my father died. He was a great and gentle man who left
his mark on the world forever. During the past year my family and I have
discussed many ways in which we could carry on his work and his legacy.
<br><br>
We have decided to establish the Bob Moog Memorial Foundation for
Electronic Music, with a few carefully chosen objectives, each tied to
his life and work.<br><br>
Today, we invite you to join us. Please visit our new website
<a href="http://www.moogfoundation.org">www.moogfoundation.org</a>
<br><br>
Sincerely, <br><br>
Michelle Moog-Koussa<br>
Director, The Bob Moog Foundation <br>

MoogCasts | Documentary Podcast <br><br>
We're developing a documentary series that features artists playing Moog
Music instruments. <br><br>
This first episode features Perpetual Groove, a rock n' roll band, with
every member playing at least one Moog. <br><br>
What's a podcast? That's on the site, too. <br><br>

Subject: [sfraves] Tranceportal day party thanks

Hi everybody!

We wanted to send our thanks to everybody who came out to hang with us last
last week in a meadow full of trance.  Somewhere around 2-3pm a bunch of you
came by, and with your help we were able to raise $350 to help out Josh Wolf
(http://freejosh.pbwiki.com) which we have already sent to Liz.

The website has been updated with party photos and recordings of all the
DJs.  Visit http://www.tranceportal.org, you'll find them in the events
section.  Thanks Skye and Evi for all the photos we were able to add into
the gallery!

It was great to seeing so many old friends and tons of new faces, we had a
lot of fun and hope to do it again soon!

Subject: [sfraves] Oh Yeah.. quick WR of last weekend :)

So last Saturday was kinda upsetting, but like mondo fulfiling @ the same
time :)  Like I got flaked on hardcore not once, but twice by the same
person who said that I could work for him so i could make some fast cash
by helping him clean like these mansions in Fairfield.. la la la... then
he was gonna take me up to SAc & I was suppose 2 go 2 Heavyweights that
Drop Heavy was throwin', but oh well... never happened...

So anywaze.. there's somethning I'm involved in right now TV show-wise i'm
not allowed to talk about yet... but like the Executive Producer called me
Sat evening & told me that I was gonna be working on that night, so score
:)  YAY!!!

So the 1st place we shot was @ BamBuhda Lounge (Phoenix Hotel) wherre
there was a SF House Collective Fund raiser shindig & I interviewed the
promoter Scott.. it was a Groovy shindig actually.. i mean.. outta all the
time i've been by that place.. i never went like inside 'cause i was like
promoting for 1015 dealie... but WOW... So nice!!! :)  It was funny.. like
i didn't expect to know anyone there.. then this girl like yelled my name
who I remember meeting from the old skool Blakes Ascension days... so that
was kinda Groovy.... I totally forgot her name... & it was hard to see who
she was in a 1/2 pitched dark room only lit up by din red lights... but
regardless... it was Dope seein' her again :)  LoL  Hello 2day :P

The next stop was SOMA-TECH :)  Now it took us a while to get there 'cause
it was @ a "hidden" underground location... now when they say Hidden...
they meant it... it took like an hour & 1/2 to find the location... like
me & the production crew went  to all the clubs were i knew the like
bouncers & they didn't even know where the street was... but like ok... it
was still Groovy catchin' up w/ them 'cause it's been rare that I been in
SOMA lately.. lol... oh yeah.. i even saw Oli & Big J @ Butter, but they
had no clue what i was lookin' for...

So after Cat Club, 1015, Caliente, Paradise, we went to like DNA & I
talked to Barry there.. lol.. we went in the club & did a google serch..
Hello 2day.. we found it!  So we got there... Hello 2Day.. it was the same
place where old skool SFR peeps Kimba & Seraphim used to live.. their old
wherehouse they used to live in :)

We kinda got there late... Catharsis spun already & Kuzse spun already..
so waaah :(  BUt when we got there... Christian Fuller (i think that was
him) was spinning this Yummy Techno... I mean.. it was kinda like Poppy
Misstress Barb kinda Techno... but it was fun!!!  LoL.. the dance floor
was packed & it was fun... saw sooooooooooooooo many old skool faces i
ain't seen in a loooong time there & it was fun hangin' out w/ a sloshed
Catharsis!!! :)  It was also fun makin' new Friends there which i really
hope to see again @ some point :)  Man... Awesome talks w/ people!!  I
mean... the attendance was probably more than it was suppose 2 B 'cause it
was in the Heart of SOMA.. the warehouse... so lik3e  I'm sure some like
passer byers like heard the Yummy Grooves & decided to check it out!!  But
it was really am Awesome crowd :)

Outta everywhere we been on Sat.. i only took picktures @ SOMA-TECH & i
kinda regret that :(  Oh Well... anywaze... here they go :)

http://s96.photobucket.com/albums/l188/YummyBeats/SOMA-TECH%208-20-2006/

I wish i made it on Sunday to the park... but yeah... my thoughts were
there :)  Love U Bam... Glad u had a Groovy Bday weekend dude :)

Subject: [sfraves] BSP: UPDATE!!!! THE PHAT CONDUCTOR joining us at Crooked tomorrow!

(This is straight from my fellow Renegade Ferret Evinrude...)

Oh man! Gotta love the last minute 
international-peeps-in-town-for-Burning-Man sets, right?

Needless to say, we're pretty damn stoked to be hosting The Phat Conductor 
at Nickie's tomorrow. This 2Wars/A Revolution Records recording artist (and 
one of Urb Magazine's "Next 100" picks) is one of Toronto, Canada's leading 
figures in breaks, regularly doing gigs in Canada, the UK and the US. He'll 
be doing a live laptop set at Crooked.

>From his site (thephatconductor.com - check it for some mixes, too...): "Old 
School, Nu Skool, Home School... it doesn't matter. With an ear for the 
future and an eye on the dancefloor the man behind Ice-9 brings you lush, 
organic electronics, funky bass grooves and a live performance to tell your 
grandkids about..."

So yeah, this is AWESOME! Come check it!

And on top of all that, the original plan is still in effect, as well. I 
certainly don't want to overshadow the fact that Aaron Jae and Donna Matrix 
are gonna be in the house as well. They're two of my favorite DJs around, so 
all in all, all I can say is "Damn. Now THIS is a Wednesday night lineup!"


Crooked
Wednesday, 8/23

Subject: [sfraves] weekend report (of sorts)

Hi All,

My wife and I finally made it out this past weekend.   Unfortunately because of the logistics of getting a babysitter we don't always have a choice about what night to go out.  That meant missing Mighty Breaks on Friday, and so we decided to attend a Sunset/GGL (Green Gorilla Lounge) "underground" called Fully Loaded at Gingerbread.

Now I don't want to be accused of being hater here.  I consider myself to mostly be a house head, so I was looking forward to this party.  I've been a fan of both crews for years and I've attended numerous Sunset and GGL parties previously.  However, I did not like this party.  The venue was alright, featuring relatively safe parking ($3) across the street, decent bathrooms and acceptable sound.  When we got there M3 was spinning some half decent house.  I enjoyed the projections and so forth.  But it wasn't too crowded and the vibe wasn't really clicking.  

After a while of chilling, it was time for one of the bands, Bobbie Marie, to play.  I'm pretty openminded musically and I like a lot of different styles.  I like live percussion and instruments at aprties too.  However, I don't know if I just didn't get this band, but I thought they were awful.  Sort of bad industrial/punk crossed with Devo-esque vocals also done badly.  Almost immediately the downstairs dance floor was cleared,and we (and most everyone else) fled upstairs where Sharon Buck was spinning some nice funky tracks.  People upstairs were dancing while the hideous grating of nails and chalkboards continued downstairs.  For a bit it seemed like the upstairs might go off, but then suddenly the crowd began to thin out.  Apparently the downstairs was now open again as the second band, Landshark, set up.  We migrated downstairs, hoping the vibe would solidfy, but it just was even more diffused.  We decided to leave and go elsewhere.

Headed over towards the Aspire 8 yr. party which we found easily.  While looking for parking we saw a lot of very sketchy characters leaving the venue and lurking around the side streets in the area.  I didn't really think parking there was such a great plan. We were probably over reacting, but we decided to move on anyway.  I headed for Kontrol over at the Rx Gallery, but it was after 3AM and by this point and my navigation abilities were shot.  I couldn't find the Rx.  And my GPS navigation system seemed more like the controls of an alien spacecraft than anything else. After a few minuted of futile searching in the Tenderloin, we realized that the CD in my car was sounding REAL GOOD right about then.  So we decided to head for the beach and just enjoy the rest of the evening/morning sans party.

Ok, we had a good time anyway, but this wasn't a good party. In fact I'd say it was a good example of how to have a bad party.  Wrong people, wrong music, wrong venue.  Timing of set changes badly managed.  Weird drink system that encouraged people to drink more than they should (you had to buy 3 drinks at a time for $10 including juice, water, soda, etc.)  Bleh.  I liked the venue however.

We had intended to head over to Golden Gate Park for Shishkabeats Sunday, but we were so sleepy.  Yawn.  We could hardly... Yawn... get out of bed.  Yawn. Snore.

Peace,

Peter

The 1st band you described sounds like pretty much every band/sound that 
gets played over at the Rickshaw. I highly recommend that NO ONE ever goes 
to that hipster nightmare of a place.

Landshark - that's Lance Desardi's band. Wewre they worth a fuck, or just as 
lame as "band # 1" ?

I like Lance Desardi's mixes and some of his tracks.  I've heard some Landshark remixes that I liked.  But by the time they were setting up, we were ready to leave.  The party wasn't going anywhere.  So in the end I didn't hear Landshark.

The whole scene reminded me of this party we had in college circa 1980 called the Step On My Face party aka Beat Me, Fuck Me, Make Me Write Bad Checks.  There were even some guys in drag, but I didn't get the impression that they were actually drag queens.  It was more of a put on or something.

The 1st band you described sounds like pretty much every band/sound that 
gets played over at the Rickshaw. I highly recommend that NO ONE ever goes 
to that hipster nightmare of a place.

Landshark - that's Lance Desardi's band. Wewre they worth a fuck, or just as 
lame as "band # 1" ?

Actually the members of Bobbie Marie & Landshark were mostly the same. A few
guitarists less for Landshark, and Lance doing vocals instead of keyboards.

I have to say, it was what I'd call "hipster house." Landshark was pretty OK
- they did play "tie me up" which of course, rocked. Sadly, they played that
towards the end of their set, and after a lot of my friends had  left. Alas.

The music picked up a lot after that - Anthony was dropping the heat and
then galen finished up (and played a track that anthony had just played 20
minutes prior).

I looked for you to say Hi, but the guy in the orange shirt said his name
was not Peter, but could be whatever I wanted it to be. After that I gave
up.

Yep, the drink situation was pretty wonky, but with a few friends, we all
kept nicely toasted. I rocked my earplugs, and I had a pretty good time
overall.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] weekend report (of sorts)

Actually the members of Bobbie Marie & Landshark were mostly the same. A few
guitarists less for Landshark, and Lance doing vocals instead of keyboards.

I have to say, it was what I'd call "hipster house." Landshark was pretty OK
- they did play "tie me up" which of course, rocked. Sadly, they played that
towards the end of their set, and after a lot of my friends had  left. Alas.

The music picked up a lot after that - Anthony was dropping the heat and
then galen finished up (and played a track that anthony had just played 20
minutes prior).

I looked for you to say Hi, but the guy in the orange shirt said his name
was not Peter, but could be whatever I wanted it to be. After that I gave
up.

Yep, the drink situation was pretty wonky, but with a few friends, we all
kept nicely toasted. I rocked my earplugs, and I had a pretty good time
overall.

ok folks, i just re-subscribed a second ago, so forgive me if this has
already been discussed, but....

I just noticed that Karina posted some "goodbye cruel world" message last
night on MySpace!!  WTF!?!

somebody PLEASE tell me this was just some kind of a twisted joke or a
myspace hack or something!

does anyone know if she's ok?

i'm honestly just assuming this was just a very f'd up hack of her account
or something, but man....SUICIDE IS NO JOKING MANNER!!!

sorry if i'm spazzing out, but something like that should never be taken
lightly. if anyone knows what's up, please let me know.  i don't even know
Karina that well, but i know i don't want her dead!

thanks.

What exactly did she say?  There's a difference between depressed ramblings=

Anyone know her home address?  Someone should go check on her or notify the=
 police if you think she's serious.

Yea, yesterday she was looking for someone with a truck to help her move the

for a truck to that. And I never saw that bulletin either...

Hmm.  Seems like someone should try to contact her, bc she might just have =
meant she's signing off of MySpace.  Bu tI agree with Greg, this isn't some=
thing to be taken lightly.

Did she post anything on Tribe.net or elsewhere?

If someone calls the cops and she's fine, they might still 5150 her or sear=
ch her house.  Assuming they find her of course.

Anybody seen her recently or know her well enough to go visit home?

Peter

Seems like one doesn't go through the trouble of moving right before doing away with themselves, but what do I know.

Anyone know where her new residence is?

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Karina

Here's a posting to Tribe.net from 2 days ago: http://sanfrancisco.tribe.ne=
t/listing/Help-w-Moving/san-francisco-ca/c88d139d-5100-4369-9555-c979085895=
3a

Looks like she's moving to Mountain View.

However, her previous two postings were seeking employment and seeking no c=
ost legal counsel.  That doesn't sound too good. =20

On the other hand she also posted on the 22nd, "I love the fact that I am v=
ery Oral" which sounds relatively good I think.

Ranger responded to her postings on Tribe...anyone heard from her after the=
 MySpace posting?

Peter

Hmm.  Seems like someone should try to contact her, bc she might just have =
meant she's signing off of MySpace.  Bu tI agree with Greg, this isn't some=
thing to be taken lightly.

Did she post anything on Tribe.net or elsewhere?

If someone calls the cops and she's fine, they might still 5150 her or sear=
ch her house.  Assuming they find her of course.

Anybody seen her recently or know her well enough to go visit home?

Peter

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Karina

Also, Thievery Corporation's MySpace account got hacked the other day, and 
the people posted all sorts of annoying shit and BS bulletins - maybe since 
this is showing up nowhere other than MySpace it's another hack-job?

It'd still be nice to hear directly from Karina, but things seem a little 
fishy...

If you've known Karina Powers for any length of time, you know she's the =
last person who would ever commit suicide.  Think about all the uphill =
battles she's fought and hasn't once stopped taking huge strides up the =
mountain.

I'm disappointed in all of you.

Most of us don't know her that well Nico. I've only met Karina once FTF.

Maybe you should contact her just to confirm you are correct.

Peter

If you've known Karina Powers for any length of time, you know she's the last person who would ever commit suicide.  Think about all the uphill battles she's fought and hasn't once stopped taking huge strides up the mountain.

I'm disappointed in all of you.

Hey man, I'm the one that started this thread, and I will admit that I don't
know Karina well at all.

All I know is that I saw what looked to possibly be a suicide note and
thought it better to be safe than sorry.

>From what I do know of Karina, I agree she doesn't at all seem the type to
just give up.  But that's exactly what I thought of my highschool Humanities
teacher too.  Depression and circumstance have ways of clouding
otherwise healthy minds.

I'm willing to wager 90% odds that this was just a hack or a cruel joke, but
let us not forget this is a human being's life we're talking about.

I'd rather you be disappointed that someone over-reacted than be heartbroken
at the loss of a loved one and the fact that no one cared enough to try to
do something about it.

Do you not agree?


-----> Greg

I received a personal message from her on MSpace a few weeks ago indicating that she was moving -- being forced out of her home I gathered -- and she didn't know where she would end up.  I'll check and see if I can find the message.  As I recall it had some interim contact info.

extent as well....

I've known Karina for like 6 years now & i her hippy ways wouldn't allow
her to off her life like that.... I do think she does Love life too much
to do that...

I don't think anyone would hack on her account & leave a message like that
either...

Concentrating on the basic element of life: air/breath and synapse firing
their pulses of electricity, the loud thought flying by, getting deeper with
every looping rhythm. The noise of life suddenly makes the basics disappear
as if they were never there, but in the end, we all return to the basics and
continue on breathing.

Prozac sucks ass, I never knew how crappy the withdrawal would be. The 5-HTP
doesn't seem to help, if anything just amplify my emotions. I am five blocks
away from returning to dxm after being sober for the last year and a half
sitting here with pinkeye in both eyes, a fever, soar throat, and lack of
will to live. Being dissociated would be a lovely way to die,



but not today.

Relax- If I sent a message like that I'd want somebody to wonder if I was OK.  People wondering and worrying and trying to contact Karina is a healthy thing, until we all find out what's going on.

Looked like at least a cry for help, to me,

IMO, thinking of a person as "someone who would or would not commit  
suicide" is very dangerous.

In any case, "Goodbye cruel world" and then not hearing anything from  
her when she is quite a frequent poster on all the social-network  
sites she's on, and her cell being disconnected?
I dunno Nico, I see that as a reasonable cause for concern.
I don't think anyone's painting her in any bad light at all- it's  
just that- concern.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] You're all drama queens WAS: Karina

I think the point of Greg's posting was that someone might be able to contact her or check to see if she was OK, not a silly attempt to create drama.  Lord knows we all have enough drama these days.

I shouldn't speak for Greg, but if she posted the note on MySpace, and at this point there's no reason to assume otherwise, then she might be thinking about doing something dumb and there might be a chance to intervene and help her.

If she's fine, then no harm no foul.  None of us that "don't even know her" will think anything less of her.  I'm not clear why you think we would.

Apollo stated that she was being forced out of her home.  That's a very unpleasant piece of business and could lead the strongest of us to despair.  

Lets just confirm that she's OK and not start a flame war over this please.

Regards,

Peter

I'm certainly not trying to start a flame war.  Far from it.

But I can already imagine Karina's reaction to her getting a call from one

Hey, least he cared enough to say something. That's called
kindhearted, not irresponsible. You're just being mean.

Cool, Call her and find out so that the entire SFR community knows for
sure. I know I'd personally appreciate that.

Well, being as she's a moderator and maintainer on here, I think it's
a perfect forum to find out. He sent an email directly to the list
that he knew she'd most likely respond on. if she had responded with
an expanation, it wouldn't have been this big a deal. Don't be like
that.

Good for you. If you ever put up a note or say something that could
potentially sound like suicide, depression, unhappiness, I'll make a
mental note to not go out of my way to find out what's wrong with you,
or even acknowledging the situation.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Karina


I got this from her in a bulk a few weeks ago:

z0phreak0z:  I hope all is well with you and I  give you much wishes for 
happiness and peace. I'm moving on the 31st and may be without internet 
access for a bit. My exact destination is not determined at the moment 
though I will hopefully will be settled over the next month or so.  I can 
be reached at karina@area.com and 650.716.7169 - keep in mind there may be 
some delay in my responses but I'll do my best to get back to you. Have a 
wonderful weekend and thanks for your friendship. I send you much love 
always in all ways and Namaste!!!!

On the 15th I got a Happy B-Day message (my internet B-Day)

I think the Irony is that when she tries to do something nice for people, 
she get's berrated, shot down, belittled, and made to feel like the lowest 
form of life on the planet.

Yet, if people think she might kill herself (why on earth would she 
POSSIBLY want to do that) then suddenly everyone cares and shows 
concern.  Did anyone care 6 months ago when she lost her job?  Did anyone 
care when her health wa sin shambles?  Anyone bother to call when she had a 
working phone?

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Karina

Well, as I said I don't know Karina and I've in fact only met her once.  If you are refering to the "SFraves benefit" I don't agree with everything you did regarding that  or how that was approached.   But that doesn't mean I wished her illwill or that I  didn't try to help her.  As it so happens I did pass her resume on to the hiring manager for a QA position at my company.  They hired someone else recently and weren't looking to hire anyone at this time.  But I passed it on anyway.  FWIW my current job doesn't involve hiring or managing people so I couldn't help directly.  

I've repeatedly tried to help people on this list when they were unemployed or looking for better gigs.  The people I've offered help to know this is true.  I've been there myself not long ago and I resolved to try and help others because no one tried to help me.

My employer is not currently hiring since the company actually will run out of funding at the end of November,  but if anyone sees any jobs they are interested in at Stanford University, especially the Stanford Graduate School of Business, please let me know.  My wife works there and we'll try to help.  Naturally I can't promise anything and you'll still ahve to go through the interview process etc.

I've previously posted this offer to the list at least twice.  

Regards,

Peter

I got this from her in a bulk a few weeks ago:

z0phreak0z:  I hope all is well with you and I  give you much wishes for 
happiness and peace. I'm moving on the 31st and may be without internet 
access for a bit. My exact destination is not determined at the moment 
though I will hopefully will be settled over the next month or so.  I can 
be reached at karina@area.com and 650.716.7169 - keep in mind there may be 
some delay in my responses but I'll do my best to get back to you. Have a 
wonderful weekend and thanks for your friendship. I send you much love 
always in all ways and Namaste!!!!

On the 15th I got a Happy B-Day message (my internet B-Day)

I think the Irony is that when she tries to do something nice for people, 
she get's berrated, shot down, belittled, and made to feel like the lowest 
form of life on the planet.

Yet, if people think she might kill herself (why on earth would she 
POSSIBLY want to do that) then suddenly everyone cares and shows 
concern.  Did anyone care 6 months ago when she lost her job?  Did anyone 
care when her health wa sin shambles?  Anyone bother to call when she had a 
working phone?

Many of us here DO care about Karina.  I've known her for years, in sickness and in health.  Personally I think the guilt trips being thrown about on this list are shoddy indeed.  I've sent Karina a message and contacted one of her last relationships to see if he could get hold of her.

I see the list has changed little, actually, gotten a lot worse. More drama 
than I care to have in my life, and judgemental as hell!!! (speaking to the 
people making blanket judgements of "hipsters") Don't they have a list for 
adults?

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Karina

Word up - Peter tried to help me when I was job searching, I can vouch for 
that.

I'm not a super-techy, so my "help" wouldn't have actually been much help.

As far as the whole SFR Benefit...Karina and I talked, there was no 
animosity over the situation.

I spoke with her a few times when her phone was working, but I must admit it 
wasn't a constant communication.

Just because people did (or didn't) do all the things you mentioned, doesn't 
make anyone's concern less valid. Now let's stop all the bickering and get 
back to the issue at hand, which is trying to make sure a fellow SFRaver 
isn't in trouble...

Word.

I don't wish death on anyone.  except the stupid.  which Karina is 
not among - even if we see some things differently.

If you are refering to the "SFraves benefit" I don't agree with everything you did regarding that  or how that was approached.   But that doesn't mean I wished her illwill or that I  didn't try to help her.  As it so happens I did pass her resume on to the hiring manager for a QA position at my company.  They hired someone else recently and weren't looking to hire anyone at this time.  But I passed it on anyway.  FWIW my current job doesn't involve hiring or managing people so I couldn't help directly.  

I've repeatedly tried to help people on this list when they were unemployed or looking for better gigs.  The people I've offered help to know this is true.  I've been there myself not long ago and I resolved to try and help others because no one tried to help me.

My employer is not currently hiring since the company actually will run out of funding at the end of November,  but if anyone sees any jobs they are interested in at Stanford University, especially the Stanford Graduate School of Business, please let me know.  My wife works there and we'll try to help.  Naturally I can't promise anything and you'll still ahve to go through the interview process etc.

I've previously posted this offer to the list at least twice.  

Regards,

Peter

I got this from her in a bulk a few weeks ago:

z0phreak0z:  I hope all is well with you and I  give you much wishes for 
happiness and peace. I'm moving on the 31st and may be without internet 
access for a bit. My exact destination is not determined at the moment 
though I will hopefully will be settled over the next month or so.  I can 
be reached at karina@area.com and 650.716.7169 - keep in mind there may be 
some delay in my responses but I'll do my best to get back to you. Have a 
wonderful weekend and thanks for your friendship. I send you much love 
always in all ways and Namaste!!!!

On the 15th I got a Happy B-Day message (my internet B-Day)

I think the Irony is that when she tries to do something nice for people, 
she get's berrated, shot down, belittled, and made to feel like the lowest 
form of life on the planet.

Yet, if people think she might kill herself (why on earth would she 
POSSIBLY want to do that) then suddenly everyone cares and shows 
concern.  Did anyone care 6 months ago when she lost her job?  Did anyone 
care when her health wa sin shambles?  Anyone bother to call when she had a 
working phone?

There's plenty o' drama in the geriatric raver world.  Trust me.  The little bit of it I hear about accidentally is more than enough for me.

Hey and lets not be judgemental about those necrophiliacs now!

Short version:

No, I'm not refering to a specific time, more a total of times, over the 
course of time.

It's typical with most humans and I'm not singleing you out, or being 
specific to you or anyone else.  The only time humans become concerned or 
compassionate is if they think somebody died, or somebody did die.  The 
rest of the time we all shit on each other.

All,

I just received a reply from my original MySpace response to her.

I won't go into details, as this is her personal life, but let's just leave
it at that she's going through a very rough time right now and i'm sure she
could use all the love and support she can get.

She left me her number, but i tried calling and her voicemail was full.

I just responded to her last message, but havent heard back.

for now, just know (thank god) that she's ok.

If you were a real 'raver' you'd give a rats ass who was there or why they 
were there. You'd be there for what ever reasons you were there. Period. Don't 
judge and don't be judged. My personal perspective is its all about the music. 
You don't know them and they don't know you. How do you know they are there or 
are into the scene to "see and be seen"? When I was on the list way back in 
the day, everyone I met in person from the list use to think the same damn 
thing about me. Until they got to know me. Everyone thought I was a pretty boy. I 
am, but that doesn't define who I am. Good people and bad people run in all 
circles, including ravers, house heads, trance babies, etc...

Point is, make a conscious decision to be different. Don't be like that. Its 
just a pet peeve of mine and a big turn off. There have been so many people 
who have come in and out of my life that if I had stopped to judge I would have 
never been blessed with what they had to contribute to me. You might find a 
diamond in the rough also.

Yes...I also received a response from Karina Greg.  Her life, as you say, is very difficult right now.  One can hope and pray that all will be well with her soon.

Your point about not judging people?  I got the point.  

I know Marco so I know that's not how he his or what he was saying.  Maybe you are being judgemental yourself?

Haven't you ever encountered people that thought they were too cool, too hip, just too damn good looking, to even appear slightly to be having a good time at a club or party?  Maybe they really are having a party in their pants, but the rest of us will never know.  I find it to be somewhat of a downer personally to be around a bunch of people with dour faces at a party.

If I notice this situation, and don't find it enjoyable, does that automatically make me judgemental?  Hmm.

In another online community I belong to there is a saying "Assume goodwill."  The idea is that in the absence of strong proof to the contrary, one should always assume good will from others in the community.  But the idea of assume goodwill cuts both ways.  Your are right that we should assume goodwill from the utlra cool posers and pseudo-hipsters that wouldn't give many people on this list the time of day.  After all they are probably just lonely and looking for a real human connection, but totally clueless about how to find one and afraid to find out what would happen if they did.  

But by the same argument we should assume goodwill from those that criticize them.  They're just practicing discriminating awareness.  

I've found "assume goodwill" to be a very challenging and insightful little mantra.  Try it yourself and you might find the same.

Peace,

Peter

How much of it has to do with raves?

I'm seriously interested, this is not intended as some sort of snarky comment.

"Americans like to talk about (or be told about) Democracy but, when put to the test, usually find it to be an 'inconvenience.' We have opted instead for an authoritarian system disguised as a Democracy. We pay through the nose for an enormous joke-of-a-government, let it push us around, and then wonder how all those assholes got in there." - Frank Zappa 

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become visible."
-Jacques Attali in his seminal text "Noise"

Well, wow.  I guess we don't see eye to eye.  

I never said I was judging anyone by their clothes or their skin or their gender.  You just sort of made that part up didn't you?  What I'm talking about is people's attitude.

I don't care if you are black, asian, a middle aged white guy (like me) or whatever.  I don't care if you're gay or straight, tall or short.  So long as you are there to have a good time.  I wish there were more wildly mixed parties than there are mostly these days actually.

Part of the reason I go to parties is to meet and dance with other people from all walks of life.  Its not at all about being focused on my self as you put it.  In fact, for me its totally the opposite.

One of the best things I've gotten from dance culture, both at both raves and clubs, is that I've gotten to meet and dance with all different types of people froma ll over the world.  The reason I go out rather than staying home and playing records myself is these other people.

What I'm saying is that if people aren't at a party to have a good time, if they're posing or just there to show off their clothes or get laid or get drunk/wasted, if they're already drunk/wasted and aggresive out of control, or simply tired and depressed for whatever reason, if the flow and set timing of the music are off, if there's just no energy in the room, then its probably not going to be a very fun party.   Still I'll always give it a go.  But personally after a few hours of that I'm going to be further on up the road.  If that makes me jaded, then so be it.

Peace,

Peter

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Gravers (was Karina)

I would say it's about 75-80% politics and 20-25% music/raves.
But I would also say that there's less traffic there vs. the more 
traffic that apollo thinks.  Looking at my folders of saved messages for 
Aug, they're looking fairly similar, but that's just what I saw as 
worthy of keeping around for at least a little while. :)

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Getting old now. :)

Hey I'm glad you can live with it, since the alternatives would be bad! Be careful tho, my list postings can kill.  Heh.

I like drunken idiots so long as they are dancing and smiling and having a good time.  If they are lurking around the edge of the dance floor, nursing their drinks and their anger, or obviously looking to "get lucky", I'm much less favorable.

FWIW I'm very happy Karina is alive and well, and lets all keep focused on trying to help her find a good gig or whatever else she needs right now.

Peace,

Peter

P.S. 36 is young my friend.  Only in the rave scene do people in their 30s think they are "geriatric."

Peter, I can live with this response. Attitude is everything. But I still 
have a problem with general classifications of people. And thats what I heard. I 
didn't mean to imply you judged by clothes, skin, or gender, just saying I 
don't. 

One of my biggest enjoyments of the dance culture is meeting peole as well, 
and when there is a drunken idiot around, I avoid them, however, I enjoy being 
a drunken idiot from time to time myself! :) Never out in public though....

I appreciate the dialogue and keeping it civil. Its not often you can have 
that and have it not get carried away or have people getting all butt hurt. Its 
truly a way for me to have personal growth. I thank you for that. 

If you're a myspace whore like I've become stop by and say hello. 
www.myspace.com/cuandoque

And not to lose focus on what started this. Karina, glad to hear you're ok if 
you stomach reading this. Say hi girl! Its been way to long.....

Peace, 

M2

Well, depending on how you go about it.

At the party in question that spawned this thread, when I went to the bathroom for like 2 minutes, a guy had already moved in to try and hit on my wife.  And he wasn't like smiling or joking and happy about it.  When I came back he didn't smile and say, "My name is so and so, isn't it funny that I was trying to hit on your wife?" as frequently happens at parties inmy experience.  He just frowned and seemed angry.  Then he suddenly stood up and left.  He never said anything to either one of us.

Hassling women at parties is not cool.

I understand that the people that act this way are also suffering, but that doesn't mean I want to hang out with them.  You call that "judgemental", I call it discriminating wisdom.

Regards,

Peter

Don't get me wrong here. I'm with you on this one 100%. I've kicked guy's=20

this is not being judgmental for me, not in the least. Just blanket statemen=

I've stepped in many of times. Not a problem for me at all.=20

If it happens often at Parties, its only a complement for you. Embrace it fo=

Well, depending on how you go about it.

At the party in question that spawned this thread, when I went to the 
bathroom for like 2 minutes, a guy had already moved in to try and hit on my 
wife.  And he wasn't like smiling or joking and happy about it.  When I came 
back he didn't smile and say, "My name is so and so, isn't it funny that I 
was trying to hit on your wife?" as frequently happens at parties inmy 
experience.  He just frowned and seemed angry.  Then he suddenly stood up 
and left.  He never said anything to either one of us.

Hassling women at parties is not cool.

I understand that the people that act this way are also suffering, but that 
doesn't mean I want to hang out with them.  You call that "judgemental", I 
call it discriminating wisdom.

Regards,

Peter

"Pete Ashdown: I have a friendship with Brian Behlendorf, who helped
set up Wired's first venture on the internet, Hot Wired (now Wired
News). He was also in charge of Organic and continues to be a member
of the Apache Foundation -- a founding member of the Apache Foundation

scene, because a lot of the early rave scene was connected through

concentration of that in San Francisco. So I came out to San Francisco
frequently during that time."

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Karina

Considering Petere's last house party had people in age range from about a 
year old to about 60 +, with just about every ethnic background there (with 
maybe the exception of someone middle eastern, but I could be wrong about 
that), straight AND gay people, and a mix of both regular folks and ravers 
alike...I'd say...well...I think that says enough, doesn't it?

Don't get me wrong here. I'm with you on this one 100%. I've kicked guy's 
asses for this! Some guys don't know when to stop or to have respect. Is this a 
result of him being a "hipster" or just being a fucking asshole idiot? 
---

Good point:

The current SF definition of "hipster" is:

Skinny kids with vintage tees/levis/conductor hats/chucks/dunks/cut up goodwill clothes/funny haircuts/ironic moustaches or haute-couture versions of these (depending on the presence or absence of high-paying tech job/trust fund).  They listen to dance rock, minimal techno, electro-house, IDM-y pop and mashups and ride track bikes and mopeds around.  A lot of them are vegan, a lot of them eat giant steaks just to fuck with the vegan ones.

They are, by and large, nice, totally nonviolent (unless they're being violent in an ironic way), and mainly guilty of cliqueish behavior.  Their only "macho" issues are occasional beer/coke abuse spurred on by friends' excesses.

They are not the people hitting on anybody's wife, getting huffy on the dancefloor, or anything.  By and large, they're off having fun.  They u may act a little too cool for school now and then but they're not causing trouble.

The people Peter's talking about are.....

(wait for it...)

Guidos/Marina Men.  

BIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIG difference.  These are the meatheads you speak of.

You forgot the part about typicalling inhaling gobs of cocaine whenever 
available.

What's funny is I filter through a lot of different scenes/circles, and 
find the smack talk humorous.  Basically swap names and it's all about the 
same.  It's worthy of creating some for of web based Mad Lib type of page 
just for fun.

However, regardless of the scene, if you put on Gnarles Barkley everyone 
starts grooving.

Go figure.

If there isn't the occasional "OMG...  Vlad was't wearing ANY black 
saturday night!  I saw him.  No eye liner either.  He also forgot his 
fangs.  He's totally being kicked off this list!" I would be very disappointed.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Rave DJ Running Against Hatch in Utah

Pete used to be in charge of Playskool I believe in SLC (which was one of
the only steady rave warehouses, most all other raves happened out in the
desert or the forests).. it was unfortunately shut down before I started
partying in 95 but I hear it was quite the good time and a huge change
from church dances or tipping cows! ;)  My brother got to go but my
parents wouldn't let me go with him.  Pete also ran/runs XMission.  Utah's
biggest indie ISP.

Recently, President Bush notified the press that he would attend Orrin
Hatch's fundraiser dinner.  In response, Pete Ashdown is holding a dinner,
free of charge for 150 people at the Alta Club.  He says Bush and company
are welcome to attend it too.  This dinner is out of his own pocket and he
hopes that the people who come will donate a bunch of money to a charity
of their choice to combat hunger.  In fact, I think pretty much all of
Pete's campaign is being financed by himself.

recently hit in St. Louis. some cologne-soaked gold-chain wearing Guidos,
and some just generally weird and creepy dudes, aka...

"GUIERDOS."

Vlad ... I remember when his email was something like "Rayvonie"  Rave On E

hasn't been a reliable big venue at all.

In addition to the main stage of live music, PTTP also features morning yoga, an open-air art gallery, a healing arts tent, a DJ tent, vendors and food booths, an eco village, kid's zone, valet bike parking by the SF Bicycle Coalition, and  tabling and forums by social, environmental and political organizations.  A second stage has been added for this year.  The festival begins at 9am with morning yoga, and will last until 5pm.

There are a few different versions out there. I have the original release and also a two record set with some remixes including the Maui extended version and an a capella.  That's the one to have IMO.

I've seen copies at Ameoba as well as the usual specialty stores, Tweekin', etc. but that was a while ago.

I saw Dubtribe live in the basement of Club 6 a few years back and they performed this track live.  That was a fun night.

I don't care that people own red cars.. but I still notice 
them.  Being observant isn't the same as being judgmental.  Being 
judgmental certainly doesn't necessitate jealousy, or vice versa.

Um.  What do you call the quoted text above this line then?  Hint: 
Try deleting parts of the email you feel no response is necessary to.

I don't recall anyone stating that hipsters should be put to

Well, it's good that you have a sense of humor, but doesn't it make 
more sense to alleviate your ignorance rather than just laugh at it?

You make assumptions about yourself?  It's possible to assess 
likelihood from visual observations.  Hey, the house is burning down, 
I should probably leave.  Hey, there's someone in the club acting 
funny, they probably have a motivation for doing so.

Bummer.  Discrimination is often based on plentiful facts, not a dearth.

Sweet!  So when you wake up, and I'm robbing your house, remember, 
you're there for sleep!

Classification != judgement.

We're all human (class)
Many of us here are ravers (class)
I'm a technophile (class)
White people are dumb (stereotype)
People that wear red are dumb (judgement)

Subject: [sfraves] Dragnfly THROWING a Halloween UG?


Say wha?

Yeah... It's something I've always wanted to do but circumstances never fell
into place.  Well it seems as though the tides have changed so here I am
seeking info from you guys to guide me in this venture...

Basically...

The date I have available is Oct 28 - Saturday. 

Anyone know of anything else being planned already on that date? At least on
the ug/warehouse tip? 

If I ain't steppin on anyone's toes... Then I'm gonna go for it, but I'd
love ot hear from you first so hit me back asap if you know of someone's
toes already sticking out there...

I thought the 80's hair-band look is coming back BIG.

Ironically drinking cheap beer may never go out of style (unfortuanatly...)

Streight guys wearing woman's jeans is probalby well over.

But yeah, isn't San Francisco weird?  How you can identify someone at a club
from either being from the North side (Marina/pac heights) or the South
Side (mission/haight) in about a second?

Mission:  They buy clohs 3rd/4th hand for cheap.  Trashed looking, faded, 
dirty, etc.  That's hip.

Marina:  They buy cloths at Abercrombie & Fitch that look old, wore out and 
aged and pay designer prices.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Semi BSP: Mix...

That track is by Artcrime - can't remember the track title offhand, but I'll 
look it up this weekend and get it to ya.

I realized listening to that mix how fast I play sometimes, hehe. It's 
dedinitley not a "chill out" thing...better for a long road trip where you 
can open the throttle up a little.

Thanks for the feedback tho!!!

Not to be a buzzkill - but if no one has seen it, my boy Larry has a pic 
remake of this done...

I'm getting him to send it to me.

Not that it couldn't be re-done a million and one times and still be fun.

Like I care.

Groove knock'offs - dime a dozen.

Groove was built around SFR (of sorts), so we're the *real* deal.

Osby, forward and onward, Hello 2day!!!!!!!!

P.S. there's this hella funny spoof. Groove: BBQ, I'll dig it up.

At MEAT @ DNA they have the mixers and decks in a BBQ on stage.

They also grill up meat outside.  All the gogo dancers are covered and 
blood splatters.

Fun club.

Partying like it's 1989? These days, as rave veteran Sarah Champion discovers, the kids are as young as 12, the drug is laughing gas, the venues are forest glades and the music is harder and faster. One thing hasn't changed, though - trying to keep one step ahead of the police

<http://www.observer.co.uk>The Observer 

Is this it? We pass a Little Chef and turn off the A road into a shadowy lay-by. It's the second to last Saturday in August, yet as dark as November with a steady drizzle. Our beams illuminate a chain of parked cars. One flashes in welcome, as if to say, 'Yes, you're here.' We take a slot near the rear of the convoy. A figure in a rain jacket moves along the line, urgently barking: 'The police have blocked the road, we've got to go now.' A 100 or so shapes emerge from steamed-up vehicles, bass blasting from each. The buzz is infectious, everyone primed for action.

This is the culmination of a day's frantic texting and posting on internet forums. I had to find out for myself whether there was any truth behind the headlines declaring a rave revival this summer. Their eyes on the drinking mayhem in our cities, the police appear to have been caught off guard in the past three months by a series of well-organised raves that arrived out of nowhere. In May Cornwall police broke up a party of 2,000 in Davidstow, seizing £3,000 in cash, drugs worth £40,000 and 12 lorries loaded with sound equipment. More raves followed. Was this another summer of love? Or a bunch of old clubbers who never went away, joined by bumper crowds due to July's heat wave? As a veteran of the 80s scene - both as a clubber and dance music journalist - I was curious.

200 riot police break up illegal rave 

· One officer suffers severed finger, eight more injured 
· Patrol car set on fire as CS gas used to disperse 1,000 

Paul Lewis
Monday August 28, 2006
<http://www.guardian.co.uk>The Guardian 

Two hundred riot police from five counties used CS gas, dogs and batons to disperse 1,000 ravers at an illegal party in Essex on Saturday night. Riots broke out in a corn field next to the village of Ickleton, near Saffron Walden, as partygoers clashed with police in scenes reminiscent of the zenith of the free party movement in the late 1980s. 

The violence, which flared up sporadically until early yesterday, was sparked when a small delegation of officers tried to negotiate the break-up of the party but met "unprecedented and ferocious" resistance, police said. A police car was set on fire and nine officers were wounded during the clashes, with injuries to police including a suspected broken collarbone and a severed finger. At least two revellers were also injured.

Subject: [sfraves] WR: My Hella Funny Flip Friday Night...

So like my 1st Cousin from Australlia, Mitchie,  was here like since last
Wed night to Sat night... Hello 2day

http://i96.photobucket.com/albums/l188/YummyBeats/Mitchie-s%20Visit%20August%202006-%20Fam%20stuff/zebulon008.jpg

... like last time i saw her was like over ummmm... i dunno.. hella years
ago... last time she spent like 2 weeks here & I had a car & we went out
everywhere :)  This time... she went out 2 Days in a row w/ my Uncle, none
of us really got to spend time w/ her.. la la la... my Mom was even sad
that she didn't get to take her Shopping...

So anywaze.. Friday... my like ok.. see.. my mom has like this misplacing
her emotion bullshit thingie goin' on & she always misdirects her shit to
other people when she's feelin' like crap... so Friday she totally took it
out on me 'cause she was hurt that she well.. what i mentioned above... so
I dunno..i kinda got outta the house early & went to the City 'cause Mr
Paulie Paul (Flash) Gordon sent out a myspace BB that he was gonna be
spinning @ this food place/ bar thingie in SOMA on Natoma called
Zebulon... "interesting" i thought.. so yeah.. it's been 4ever since we
kicked it...

I got there & like as soon as i well.. OK.. 1st off... I saw like all
these mondo yuppies hangin' out there... like outside... so i was all like
ummm... OK... but i heard these Yummy deep house beats from inside.. so i
went in & looked around.... people eating this Froo Froo Shee Shee food...
well.. i peaked @ the menu b43 i walked inside & like other people havin'
drinks... ok... then i looked up @ the Balcony/ Loft Thingie & saw Paulie
all up there mixing... LOL.. Hello 2day.. & pointed @ him & smiled & he
pointed back & waved a record @ me.. LOL.. it was Dope...

So I like manuvered my way through the crowd.... this place was packed w/
people eating & drinking & the tables were so close together... next thing
i know.. i hear someone call my name & it ended up being my cousin
Angeline who i ain't seen in a few months (another 1st cousin) & we talked
for like hella minutes about Mitchie & stuff... it was Dope & unexpected
'cause YAAAY.. REUNION!! :)  But yeah man.. it was just funny as hell
bumping into her &* like seein her lil' social group of Homies & shit :)

So I made my way up to the loft thingie where Paulie was... we talked & I
met the promoter of the happy hour House thingie... lol... He's CooL..
Ummm.. let's call him Tom for now... Tom for now.. really nice guy...
actually.. originally from Sac then moved to the City to further his
career as a house DJ...  Sweet! :)  Then i met more people, all House
Heads & 1/2 of them from Sac too :)  So that was Dope!  Actually... i
found out that Zebulon was their Remedy preparty meet up... so yeah.. i
met 1 of the crews that hit up Remedy.. Lol... it was Wicked!  They are
all Groovy people! :)

So I'm down in the 1st floor of the Resturaunt/ Bar place... talkin' to
another one of the Remedy Preparty OG from Sac Chicas... let's call her
Fancis for now... she was tellin me that Zebulon is a Filipino owned
joint.. just then... 1 of the owners, Ed, came by & gave us like 2 cups of
ooh.. ummm.. this expensive wine.. forgot the name... then Francis for now
introduced me to Ed... so we talk & talk... ok.. now check this shit
out... 'cause i knew he looked familiar & i asked him what high school he
went to.. then I told him my cousin Mylee went to that school... & he liek
ok.. the whole time we're talkin', he had this like kinda perplexed look
on his face... so when i told him Mylee's last name was Pascual.. he
tripped out..

Turns out my cousin went to a different high school & he knew 'cause he
was married to her.. Heeeeeeeeello 2Daaaaaaay... so like yeah.. this Owner
Dude, Ed, is my cousin... so we talked about all the recent family parties
& if he went & i went & la la la la.. trippy shit man... I mean.. we ain't
seen each other in like man.. amost as long as i ain't seen Mitchie... so
yeah... this was heeeeeella trippy :)  So yeah.. i kinda milked the whole
"well I'm related to the owner" card & got free drinks the whole night :P 
I mean.. he let me.. so i did!!!  LOLOLMAO  But yeah.. for now... Zebulon
is primarily like a lunch/ dinner/ drinks place.... mainly opened during
happy hour wait...

http://www.zebulonsf.com/

but yeah... Ed's workin' on getting the proper liscences & permits to make
that place run longer then 10PM on the weekends & I told him I'll help him
w/ that & stuff since I still got that SFLNC knowledge in me still & know
a few people in City Hall in the City who could help things :)  So when
this becomes a legit venue y'all... u know what's gonna go down :P  Hello
2day!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

BUt it was a fun night... the music was Sick... Paulie's set was Yummy the
1st time.. he strait just went with this "Sexy" deep loungie house vibe...
then Tom for Now got on next & played some like alota Tribal & Proggy
House... Then Paulie got back on & played some like ok... Salsa, Basanova,
Sexy House, some really deep proggy Breaks.. I mean.. deep deep, & some
SExy House Covers of 80's songs :)

Oh yeah... in the morning.. like Mitchie woke me up @ 9AM for Breakfast
(Bless my Awesome Cousin)& by like 9PM..i was getting tired (add to that a
big ass mexican dinner that i didn't get @ Zebulon 'cause that was b4 the
Cousin connex & all the food there is no less than $7)... So i stayed 'til
like 10 then walked to bart...

OK.. here's where things get more interesting.. kinda... so i go walk up
to market & have to like cross the street... so i'm walkin' across the
cross walk & a cab seriosly like almost hits me.... like stopped @ the
point where it almost like tooked out my leg if he drove further... so I
hit the hood of his cab hard & flipped him off... then he said something
to me in like whatefer language.. then i said FUCK YOU hella loud!  right
then, when i got to the other corner.... someone yelled out "OSBY" in a
passing car... so i waved back hella laughing after that then went to
bart.

OK.. The End.. lol.. fun night :)

"Americans like to talk about (or be told about) Democracy but, when put to the test, usually find it to be an 'inconvenience.' We have opted instead for an authoritarian system disguised as a Democracy. We pay through the nose for an enormous joke-of-a-government, let it push us around, and then wonder how all those assholes got in there." - Frank Zappa 

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become visible."

My friend used to live in the UK back in the early-mid 90's and he told me
about an awesome rave he went to inside a cemetery crypt. It got so hot
inside the sealed room that the walls were all wet from the sweat and steam=
.
Since it was in the crypt, you could not tell or hear anything from the
outside at all. Pure UG fun with no undesirables showing up.

It's time for another rendition of Dirty, and this time Evil Breaks is

cause, this lineup is completely wicked, with a price and venue that
you just can't beat. This will also be one of Chris's last tours for a
while as his work visa is about to expire. 2 rooms of nasty is what
you can expect, with a great vibe and even better music.

Chris has established himself as a popular DJ and has toured all over
Europe as well as the USA, Asia and Australia. His mixes have been
aired on radio stations such as Radio1, Kiss, Ministry, Groovetech and

steady stream of releases on a number UK based breaks labels including
TCR, Botchit + Scarper, Forged, En:Vision, Secret Agent, Track,and his
own Record Records amongst others, earning him a reputation as a
master of well-crafted left-of-centre dancefloor tunes.

His remix work includes tracks for Forged, Botchit, Cup of Chi,
En:Vision, Passenger,and most recently as Roxiller on Sober,
Functional and Broke Records.

a) 80s hair bands sucked when it was the 80s.  more so now.  you have no 
idea how much it pained me to have a guy who always dressed better than 
me, a brilliant producer, etc, show up one night with a mullet.  that 
said, I need a haircut at some point... bad hair + pink guitar... I'm 
cruisin for a bruisin.  i should write a song called 'the real 
america is in rockies' and make some money off Coors.  maybe they'll pay 
off my K car.  just kidding, no way could a K car still be running 
nowdays.

b) cheap beer has a price that is greater than any savings.  I can get 
looped on Stella Artois and I wake up dehydrated.  if I do the same with 
Miller, I feel like I was poorly treated and at the mercy of a vengeful 
god who shoots hangoverbolts from his sour malty fingers.

c) it's ok for a guy to wear women's jeans.  if it was an honest mistake.  
like, woke up after some freaky deaky, and just grabbed the wrong pants 
and somehow managed to get into them.  It's like a badge of honor.

d) i don't care where someone lives, but damn I meet some annoying people 
when I go out sometimes.  that said I've actually met some cool people 
lately.

e) Troy, I love ya man, but get your processes in check.  hint... go to 
our beloved home server and run 'top'.  you're so #1, #2, and #3 right 
now.  time to kill -clickclick9mmfullclip that crazy renegade process 
bidnis *pew*pew*pew*.

p.s.	george, I would vote for pedro, he was cool.

Rave reviews of bygone youth

SUSAN MANSFIELD 



MATT STOKES: PILLS TO PURGE MELANCHOLY ****

COLLECTIVE GALLERY, EDINBURGH 


THE papers are proclaiming the return of the rave. Young people are once again holding illicit outdoor dance parties, keeping one step ahead of the law. This brings an extra layer of resonance to the work of Beck's Futures winner Matt Stokes, whose vast ongoing project Real Arcadia remembers the first rave era, in particular a series of cave raves which took place in the Lake District on the cusp of the 1990s. 

Real Arcadia audibly spills out of the main room at Edinburgh's Collective Gallery in this, Stokes' first solo show. There are museum-like glass cases full of ephemera - flyers, membership cards, cassette tapes, newspaper cuttings. There are snapshots from the time enlarged and framed, and a set of speakers (part of an exact replica of the cave sound system) pounding out beats by DJ Grogg. 

There is a powerful sense of youthful idealism in the handwritten flyers, the designs on the cassette sleeves individually coloured-in by the DJs, the promise of "robot lightning" and "terror strobes". All this dedication contrasts with the self-righteousness of the locals quoted in the newspapers, claiming that the "safety of the party-goers" was their first priority when they were probably more worried about getting their flowerbeds trampled on. It's a classic generation gap of youthful rebels versus middle-aged establishment, and in that sense it is timeless. 

In another sense it's sharply rooted in time, a time which seems distant, despite being only a few years ago. There's a snapshot of a raver wearing a home-designed "Rave in the Cave" T-shirt just like the one in the display case next to it, faded and stained with age. He can't have been more than 19. Where is he now? A respectable thirtysomething with kids and a job? Or one of the rave generation who succumbed to drug abuse and never resurfaced?

There are no other possible outcomes but middle-class life or total dissolution?  :-)

"Americans like to talk about (or be told about) Democracy but, when put to the test, usually find it to be an 'inconvenience.' We have opted instead for an authoritarian system disguised as a Democracy. We pay through the nose for an enormous joke-of-a-government, let it push us around, and then wonder how all those assholes got in there." - Frank Zappa

Guns N Roses announced they would go on tour again.  Their BA shows 
sold out in less than 2 hours... and they're months away.  I was 
tired of that shit in HS, I dunno why anyone wants to relive it.

Thanks Apollo,

I'm doing better now. I started my new job and think I'm done with the
Prozac Withdrawal and flu. For awhile there things seemed darker then I had
ever felt before. I promise I didn't send that e-mail to the list looking
for attention, I was intending it to be more of a "what's up with Steve"
type of thing so people would understand why I had been so silent for the
last few months.

I really appreciate all the kind words and e-mails.

I love all my friends on SFR.

Hi,

I have a problem. I watched a Tiesto liveset on winamp. It was called DJ
Tiesto @ Homelands, Matterley. I don't know if this is right or not but that
set was amazing. Can anybody help me in getting the tracks. Also, can anyone
tell me which is the best place in the bay area to buy DVD sets for live
trance concerts.

Any help in this regard will be greatly appreciated.

Regards

A.  All events will bomb because everyone is at Burningman!

1. Creativity and innovation always builds on the past.

3. Free societies enable the future by living in the past.
4. Ours is a less and less a free society.

Am I the  only one that gets massive chills and practically comes to tears of

I DO! :D

I  remember the first time I saw it I was watching it
with a few people VERY  unfamiliar with this scene and I kept going "yeah it
is like that!, I can  feel it!" and they kept saying, "wtf is wrong with you,
this movie is  dumb". I guess I get too emotional from music. At the end when
Digweed  plays heavenscent I jump up and start yelling and  shit.




I went and saw the movie with my family on my sixteenth birthday. I totally  
gushed the entire time and still do everytime I see it.
 
I'm seriously down for a "SFR watches Groove together" movie night. Who's  
volunteering their house?? : )

I love being in the city this weekend.  Its like a vast, silent, urban

Easy taxis!   I will rule my empty domain like a king!

Hi! Welcome to the list!

For me, parties (raves) are about electronic music and watching and feeling
peoples interaction to that music. Music is so emotional and nothing beats
being in a crowd of strangers all feeling something similar from a
particular sound. A DJ can control your night and bring you up and down OR
ruin it by having poor taste in record selection or sequencing and leaving
you in a low (luckily you can always go to another room or wait for the next
DJ to come on).

Music and parties have nothing to do with drugs, but like anything else in
life can be either enhanced or destroyed by it's use.

See you around!

Subject: [sfraves] NRR: Terrorists "drive taxi cabs in the daytime and kill at night"

Go Montana!


Burns Says Terrorists Drive Taxis by Day
- By MATT GOURAS, Associated Press Writer
Thursday, August 31, 2006

(08-31) 07:00 PDT Belgrade, Mont. (AP) --

Republican Sen. Conrad Burns, whose recent comments have stirred
controversy, says the United States is up against a faceless enemy of
terrorists who "drive taxi cabs in the daytime and kill at night."

During a fundraiser Wednesday with first lady Laura Bush, the
three-term Montana senator talked about terrorism, tax cuts and the
money he has brought to his state. Burns is one of the more vulnerable
Senate incumbents, facing a tough challenge from Democrat Jon Tester.

He has drawn criticism in recent weeks for calling his house painter a
"nice little Guatemalan man" during a June speech. Burns, whose
re-election campaign is pressing for tighter immigration controls,
also suggested that the man might be an illegal immigrant. The
campaign later said the worker is legal.

Burns, 71, also had to apologize after confronting members of a
firefighting team at the Billings airport and telling them they had
done a "piss-poor job," according to a state report. In July, the
Hotshot crew had traveled 2,000 miles from Staunton, Va., to help dig
fire lines for about a week around a 143-square-mile wildfire east of
Billings.

At the campaign event with Bush, Burns talked about the war on
terrorism, saying a "faceless enemy" of terrorists "drive taxi cabs in
the daytime and kill at night."

Bush described Burns as a strong advocate for Montana farmers and families.

"In Washington, Senator Burns is a respected voice on the issues
facing rural communities in Montana and across the nation," Bush told
Burns supporters.

She also said Burns has been important in helping the president on key
initiatives, such as tax cuts, and has supported the troops fighting
in Iraq and the war on terror.

Its interesting that this comes to light at the same
time of as this:

http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2006/08/30/state/n130540D11.DTL&hw=arabic+shirt&sn=001&sc=1000

I know that this kind of discrimination has been going
on since 9/11 but its just ridiculous.

That place smells unsanitary and requires a monastary's worth of
incense to make it bearable on any given night. I'd warn any potential
buyer.

Our enemy is the Islamic fascists or Islamic extremists, terrorism is just a
form of fighting similar to guerrilla warfare. Anyone can be a terrorist
(Timmothy Mcvay), but the ones we need to concentrate this war on are the
Islamic fascist types (you know the ones that say they want to kill everyone
that isn't muslim). Obviously, this guy was just making a statement with his
shirt and was not a threat, just as all the loud UCSF students aren't a
threat. That was a nasty breach of his civil rights as an American citizen.
So how do we fight the IF's? Profile? Hope they all go to Iraq? What are we
to do as citizens that want to protect our country from attacks?

So what ever happened to the news about that dude that went GTA with a 5000
lbs SUV through Fremont and SF? Wasn't that a terrorist act performed by a
Muslim? Why no news? Is it because he isn't White? Oh, I see, he had mental
issues.... sure, just like that guy that shot all the people in the LA
airport that we never heard about also. Funny how all that is covered on the
news is about some white girl that died 10 years ago.

I don't think the hit and run rampage in SF requires
the brand of terrorism. Terrorism in definition is a
violent act presented by a group for some sort of
statement or cause. That hardly qualifies when the guy
stated he did it just because 'he wanted to'. I think
people generalize far too much when they call any act
by a muslim or someone of arab decent terrorism. That
word is thrown around far too much imo these days, and
is used to incite fear in the masses by the
government.

Subject: [sfraves] Hey guys..

I'm gonna sign off of the list for a while. I'm not seeing anything
that's really catching my interest on here anymore. Being as most of
my views politically and personally are very different than everyone
else's, I feel like quite the outcast.

Things have changed a lot since I signed back on almost 2 years ago
now, and I don't feel the urge to really continue on here. I'll sign
on if I end up coming out to the bay area, but being as most of the
posts on here are political in nature, and usually just piss me off.

I'm just not feeling it anymore. Something's missing. Hell, I haven't
lived in the bay area in about 3 1/2 years, and haven't been out to
visit since early '05.

If you want to get in touch with me directly, feel free to send me an
email at antitux@gmail.com, or hit me up on aim/yahoo with the sn
antitux. I've also got myspace and livejournal, but I'll let you find
those yourselves. Probably won't take too long.

Anyhow guys, Just wanted to say "Hi" and "Bye".

Later kids,

Sad to see anyone go, but I totally hear you.

Are Bam , GAMMA & I the only folks that ever post BSP's ???

How's about party reviews? I know Peter has done that - but apparently one 
can get skewered for even stating their opinion on a party they went to.

CD reviews??? Does that EVER happen?

And as far as mix reviews...I have received exactly ONE response about the 
mix I posted last week...so I guess not.

*sigh*

Stupid politics are teh ghey.

Posts like this are LETTING THE TERRORISTS WIN

Lol yeah I haven't posted much recently either I've been shifting to more
music based lists, love you guys but there's not a ton of content on here of
late which is .05% my fault or whatever the % is for subscribers.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Hey guys..

Apollo posts some BSPs.

I think a lot of information has migrated over to bay raves, Tribe, and MySpace.  I think some new thinking is in order to attract more peope to this list.

Also, I rarely see house music events posted here.  I guess house is sort of out when it comes to the rave scene now, but there's a pretty vibranty house music scene in San Francisco and for the most part its not promoted here.

I've tried to post non-BSP part announcements, i.e. from flyers I get, in order to make the list a more complete reference for what's happening.  But then again, its sf-raves not sf-clubs.

Anyway...

Isn't everyone at Burning Man?

I thought I was the only person left in San Francisco.

I thought you were going Marco.

Peter

Are Bam , GAMMA & I the only folks that ever post BSP's ???

How's about party reviews? I know Peter has done that - but apparently one 
can get skewered for even stating their opinion on a party they went to.

CD reviews??? Does that EVER happen?

And as far as mix reviews...I have received exactly ONE response about the 
mix I posted last week...so I guess not.

*sigh*

Stupid politics are teh ghey.

Honestly - I *want* to go to BM at SOME point, but by and large I can think 
of a million and one better places to spend a week's vacation than at the 
"playa".

Like -ANYWHERE not in this country for example, lol.

But yea- SFRaves is not enough rave these days. Hopefully the SFRP heads 
will help fix that...some good ides are in the works (as you well know 
Peter!)

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Hey guys..

i think if the majority of people on the SFR list have not attended
more than 4 raves or underground or unpermitted parties with
electronic dance music in 2006...then there is something severly
wrong.

that's only 4 parties in 8 months, but i think i actually believe that
the majority on the list hasn't done that.

shame shame...

I got an excuse as to why i havent attended more events.  I may not be there
in person, but i'm always there in spirit...drinking, smoking, yelling,
screaming and most likely getting naked or close to it.

Its not necessary anymore I dont think with tribe,
myspace etc. but still nice to have. It's lost its

Wow. Just wow.

"Our 'enemy' is the Islamic (read: Arab) 'fascists' or Islamic (read: Arab)
'extremists' . . ."

That's pretty fucking racist, fool. How many white muslims do you know?

Further, read this for an example of how your line of thinking is racist and
has created a police state right here in the good old US of A:

Subject: RE: [sfraves] Hey guys..

I dunno - everyone has a diff. perception, so you just cannot please 
everyone all the time. Period.

And why should you have to? Cuz people's feelings might get hurt? WAH. 
Builda bridge and get over it I say.

Lord knows that even despite my most diplomatic attempts, I have been told I 
should just "not cause any trouble" for stating opinions or voicing concerns 
about things. This has applied not just here on SFR, but on Groundscore, 
MySpace, etc.

(of course, I do talk a heap of shit at times, I don't deny that, hehe)

Point is tho - that you can only be so tactful or diplomatic so much of the 
time...there's always gonna be SOMEONE with hurt feelings.

Although I don't go to public parties much (no money nor time), I do attend
personal raves in my head at least three times a week. These raves usually
occur in front of my turntables with myself dancing to my own mixes or with
headphones on laying in bed in the dark exploring the inner rave in my head.

No, this list is still valid.

Listen up everyone! we have been just informed
That there's an unknown virus that's attacking all clubs
Symptoms have been said to be - heavy breathing
Wild dancing, coughing
So when you hear the sound - WHO-DI-WHOOOO!
Run for cover MUTHAFUCKA!

Well, I still do not see how it is racist. Maybe 99% of Islamic
Fascist people just happen to be of Arab decent, but that doesn't have
anything to do with the fact that we are at war with them.

I bet 99% of catholic preists that sexually abused kids are white and I
think they need to be prosecuted, is that racist also? Do you get my point
here? Just because a group happens to be of one race does not mean one is
racist for wanting to protect themselves against them.

You're applying your narrow views of what a terrorist is to a specific 
race/nationality type. That's racism buddy!

If you look up the definition of a terrorist in the dictionary, I'm sure it 
doesn't specify a race.

Just sayin'...

"We are at war with them!?!?!"

ARE YOU FUCKING INSANE?

Maybe *you* are at war with them, but as far as I'm concerned there is no
'them' to be at war with.

This is the basis of racism. I can't say that I'm surprised you don't see
it. You being known for a particularly virulent form of facist ignorance.

Well, how would you define war? There is a specific group of people out
there (Islamic extremists) that want to kill you and destroy your way of
life and they are actively looking for ways to do it.

 So that is not war? If they destroyed all the LSD and MDMA precursor
chemicals and your family would you still not be at war with them?

 I don't care if the "IF's" are black, white, yellow, red, or orange. Race
has nothing to do with it. If they happen to be of a certain race, well it
will just make them easier to find and profile, but that is about it.

Subject: [sfraves] BSP: LOVE INFUSION - Lovefest Afterparty - 4 rooms of sound

speaking of partying, this is one party that i'm really really excited about.

1)  it's our afterparty for Lovefest (yes, formely known as Love
Parade SF) and the party last year that Evil Breaks was a part of was
a fucking blast!

2)  we are working with 3 other crews that i have a huge amount of
respect for:  Opel, Tantra and the Ambient Mafia.  these are some
class act crews and very talented folks.  Opel and Tantra have thrown
some AMAZING events over the last few years.  the combination of all 4
crews is going to be fantastic.

3)  the lineup is HUGE!!!  Rennie Pilgrim, Hyper, General
Midi....these are gigantic names not just in the breaks world but in
the cross-genre global dance music world.  this really is one of the
biggest breaks lineups in SF for the entire year, no joke.

4)  we have SWAT sound and Viberation visuals in our room.  you know what's up.

5)  it's at SOMARTS bitchez!!!!

limited $20 presales are online at groovetickets:

Subject: Re: [sfraves] BSP: LOVE INFUSION - Lovefest Afterparty - 4 rooms of sound

Yea...these days I just gotta get my fix of fresh blood.

I have seen all the cats on y'alls lineup a rack of times. All solid fucking 
DJ's/producers.

Sucks there couldn't just be some mega-breaks party somewhere with every 
crew involved. And by "mega", I mean something like "For the Love Of Breaks" 
times 10.

Yea, but "all breaks" encompasses SO much.

Psy-breaks, nuskool, tech-funk, funky, electro, miami bass, baltimore 
breaks, D&B, dubstep, 2step, hip-hop, etc.

You sayin' that's a BAD idea?

How about getting beyond breaks, trance and electro while we're at it?

Stay tuned for a new unter/uber-ish party for those wanting to go back

Ping me your details and I'll add you to the info list.

i think if the majority of people on the SFR list have not attended

that's only 4 parties in 8 months, but i think i actually believe that
the majority on the list hasn't done that.

shame shame...

>From an interview with author and screenwriter Peter Schneider which I read=
 today which I think is relevant and interesting:


 MM: Were the Red Brigades terrifying? =20
 PS: I always wondered, because I knew personally the first generation of t=
he Red Brigades. I knew them all. I know how it worked. As a matter of a fa=
ct, there are quite striking parallels between Islamic terrorism and the br=
igades. =20
 MM: What are the parallels? =20
 PS: The parallel is this culture of death. And the fact that in order to e=
nd up with this decision to kill and be killed, to commit suicide and take =
as many with you as you can, this logic is not one with the poor and suppre=
ssed of the world. It is an elite phenomenon. It has more to do with nihili=
sm than with any religion. To call it Islam is already misleading, because =
these guys are crazy politicians, ego-maniacs, disguised as religious fanat=
ics. It has nothing to do with religion. They're just criminals and fanatic=
s, total ego-maniacs. It's about egoism, solipsism, and not so much about r=
eligion. The war in Iraq has nothing to do with the fight against terrorism=
, it is a total deflection from this fight. The real danger is not these te=
rrorists, though they are dangerous, of course, but that millions of people=
 in the Arab world see them as heroes and identify with them. This is somet=
hing that you cannot heal with military campaigns. Here you must work with =
diplomacy,
 aid, politics. We have to ask ourselves: why do so many people identify wi=
th these idiots? =20
 MM: For Camus, "a nihilist does not believe what he sees". I visualize an =
economic war. =20
 PS: Yes, but we should not underestimate ideology. If people are now led b=
y Islamic fanatics, by priests, who tell them what to do, and if they do it=
 early enough, a boy of eight will start saying: "Yes, I want to be a suici=
de bomber, I want to be a suicide bomber. Allah is big in the world." It is=
 not only about economics. =20
 MM: Isn't culture a form of self-protection? =20
 PS: Absolutely. Culture is the most important thing we have to protect us =
against these forces. =20
 MM: Then why are governments withdrawing from culture? =20
 PS: This whole Bush thing is a culture of hypocrisy. This is all wrong, wh=
atever they say is just a lie. They say: "We want to care for the poor." Th=
ey act in the opposite direction. What is fascinating is that most of these=
 guys, who from my point of view are total liars, still believe they are ac=
tually good people, doing good, and that what is in their interests is good=
 for everyone in this world. They still believe that. They have a wonderful=
 insensitivity. They are unable to see themselves from another perspective.=
 Americans are very proud that this is the most mixed culture in the world,=
 but you only know the American version of otherness. You only know the Ame=
rican version of an Italian. You only know the American version of the Iris=
h people, of a Mexican, of a Spaniard or an Asian.

The term "fascist" gets thrown around a lot, and often it's misapplied.

fas=E2=80=A7cism=E2=80=82 /=CB=88f=C3=A6=CA=83=C9=AAz=C9=99m/ - [fash-iz-uh=
m]
=E2=80=93noun
1.(sometimes initial capital letter) a governmental system led by a
dictator having complete power, forcibly suppressing opposition and
criticism, regimenting all industry, commerce, etc., and emphasizing
an aggressive nationalism and often racism.
2.(sometimes initial capital letter) the philosophy, principles, or
methods of fascism.

Terrorism is specifically when non-governmental groups attack civilian
concerns.  So in some sense terrorist and fascist are mutually
exclusive.  There's clearly a lot of gray area, (for instance, a
fascist state providing support to a terrorist organization, or a
group of terrorist who want to take over a government to impose
fascist rule) but blowing up passenger jets for the purpose of
instilling fear in the populace of another country is not really a
fascist act.

And on one of the other points--there are millions of non-arab muslims
in the world, both extremist and otherwise.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] has SFR lost relevance?

I think this is true about mailing lists in general not just sfraves.  However, the lsit could do with a bit of promotion, and if there was more content only available through the list, i.e. like a really useful activity calendar, then people would come here to get that content.  In the absence of that its just digestive rumblings from the peanut gallery and the much welcomed BSPs and party reviews.

Its not necessary anymore I dont think with tribe,
myspace etc. but still nice to have. It's lost its
energy really. As mentioned before few really post
about parties or music, and I think thats why.

I'm just glad to hear that DJ Funk is going to be in town at Mighty...just
sad I'm going to miss it.  He would spin at undergrounds here in Chicago
back in the day..."Let me see yo' check stub...git yo' own check stub"....ah
memories!

BTW, I've been to many of the UGs in SF the past 8 months, and they are all
quite similar...mainly focused on breaks...which I love, but I like more
variety at parties...can't WAIT for Lovefest...and I don't have a car, so
getting across the bay is quite difficult for me, so only the UGs in SF
proper...

It's cool to hate on Tiesto. :)  I like him, though.  Good luck on your
