Subject: [sfraves] east bay advice, life advice

hey there nice people -

been lurking here quietly for years, but now i've got to ask the community 
for some advice.  i recently moved to north oakland from sf with my 
longtime girlfriend, who then went through a major life overhaul and is 
now set to move out.  she's taking charge of her life, moving into an 
awesome artist warehouse community, and i'm very proud of her, but 
unfortunately this has happened at the expense of our relationship, at 
least for now. i'm pretty busted up about it, and it's causing me to 
reevaluate my own life.  i've got some plans, but classes don't start 
until the fall, and at the moment i'm stuck in a kind of limbo.  need to 
widen my horizons.  i've fallen out of touch over the years with most of 
the artsy/hippy/party people i used to know, and most of my current close 
friends are approaching heavy marriage/career/kids mode at this point... 
so i guess my question for y'all is this: any advice on things to do in 
the east bay (what with the bridge closures and my preference for biking, 
sf seems kinda far away these days, but i'm not ruling it out of course)? 
parties where i can dance and meet nice people, art things where i can 
get involved, building, making things, music things where i can get 
involved (i produce digi-dub and other electronic music, know a ton of 
theory, play the guitar, dj some), opportunities for activism, for 
learning, even bars or clubs worth visiting. just looking for new ideas, 
new input, maybe some operating instructions for an artistically 
fulfilling oakland existence.  ;)  any suggestions, advice, hints, or 
treasure maps would be most appreciated.  thanks,

-jacob

ps. personal hellos to those of you that i've met.  hi, danny!  hi, larry 
from philly, if you're out there!  hi, people whose names i've forgotten!

Subject: Re: [sfraves] east bay advice, life advice

There's still a ton of stuff to do over here in the East Bay. The parties 
are a little scarce unless you like undergrounds, but there are some things 
happening. Oasis in Oakland has regular Thursday and Sunday night house 
nights...my crew Otherworld also does a monthly there. Jupiter in Berkeley 
does a nice electronic event every Thursday as well - not really a dance 
thing per se, but a "have some beers and conversate whilst listening to 
beats" kinda deal.

Beyond that, there are some really cool watering holes here with decent 
crowds...The Mallard in Albany is my favorite, but the Ivy Room is cool, 
Acme  in Berkeley is a nifty spot, Blake's on Telegraph in Berkeley is cool, 
the Ruby Room in Oakland is nice as well.

As far as art, Berkeley is chock full of artists, artist collectives, places 
to do art for free (Albany Bulb is a really cool outdoor spot where anyone 
can go create things!), etc.

If you'd like, sometime you can meet up with me and I'll take you around to 
some of these spots, or just meet so you can get the lowdown from me...

ez.

The Artfag Mafia threw a great event at NIMBY about a month ago.

Anything where you have to sign a release on entry is good fun in my 
book!  And their ride is pretty nice too, if you believe in those 
powered vehicle things:

Also, don't miss the Fire Arts festival in July at the Crucible (and 
just check out classes available at the Crucible in general, 
http://www.crucible.org for the schedule.)

hey there nice people -

been lurking here quietly for years, but now i've got to ask the community 
for some advice.  i recently moved to north oakland from sf with my longtime 
girlfriend, who then went through a major life overhaul and is now set to 
move out.  she's taking charge of her life, moving into an awesome artist 
warehouse community, and i'm very proud of her, but unfortunately this has 
happened at the expense of our relationship, at least for now. i'm pretty 
busted up about it, and it's causing me to reevaluate my own life.  i've got 
some plans, but classes don't start until the fall, and at the moment i'm 
stuck in a kind of limbo.  need to widen my horizons.  i've fallen out of 
touch over the years with most of the artsy/hippy/party people i used to 
know, and most of my current close friends are approaching heavy 
marriage/career/kids mode at this point... so i guess my question for y'all 
is this: any advice on things to do in the east bay (what with the bridge 
closures and my preference for biking, sf seems kinda far away these days, 
but i'm not ruling it out of course)? parties where i can dance and meet 
nice people, art things where i can get involved, building, making things, 
music things where i can get involved (i produce digi-dub and other 
electronic music, know a ton of theory, play the guitar, dj some), 
opportunities for activism, for learning, even bars or clubs worth visiting. 
just looking for new ideas, new input, maybe some operating instructions for 
an artistically fulfilling oakland existence.  ;)  any suggestions, advice, 
hints, or treasure maps would be most appreciated.  thanks,

Shiet Marco, you live in richmond.  The cheapest gas (and richmond folks can
vouch for this!) is cruising around with a shortened garden hose and
syphoning off your neighbors!

Subject: [sfraves] final vinyl philosophy

i was thinking about what was said about vinyl and what was the reason 
why electronic music was first introduced via vinyl.. and came to the 
rationalization that vinyl is just cooler in general.

i know people will bring up the argument "well we didn't have burning 
capability and massive storage hard drives back then."
that is true but we also had the capability to play cds in much the same 
way all mobile djs play now... and by all means the cd decks by tascam 
back then were very state of the art and paved the way for pioneer cdjs 
to dominate. looping, start/ stop cues and all this trickery that people 
have now via cds and mp3 programs.. which were also around circa ten 
years ago. so then why the hell we'ren't we making dub plates on cd..? 
and playing cds back in the day when the technology was there?

my theory of that has to do with the indy music scene back then and the 
origins of electronic music djing.  by the late 80s & early 90s 
everything was on cd and to alot of people at large, vinyl was a joke. 
that is unless you talked to disco heads, hip hop djs, and indy rock 
collectors. independent distributors were making a modest means and 
artists from any sort of electronic act besides synth pop and industrial 
acts couldn't get signed to the majors. the independent scene was 
gaining steam in the underground and all indy collectors who were loyal 
to the independent scene  HATED the majors. since people hated the 
majors so much and hated alot of the things associated with them S/A CDs 
and cassettes, vinyl and all the things associated with it were coveted. 
limited pressings, rare artwork, bonus posters and stickers, who owned 
the vinyl last, color vinyl pressings, super limited acetates and test 
pressings made the indy scene rule compared to the banal cd.. especially 
when they canned the long box. `;)
    i also feel that the djs in the traditional realms of disco and hip 
hop were also impressing new legions of followers such as mad mike at 
Underground Resistance, frankie knuckles at the warehouse, and all the 
djs at the hacienda including laurent garnier. these djs saw the power 
of vinyl and the culmination of independent unheard music unleashed on 
the masses. hop hop mega mixing, live re-edits, and adding drum machines 
to the mix was kicking people's asses. now i'm hearing, 'wait, i can do 
that on my lap-t..' no. -these people were doing it in the face of an 
audience that thought vinyl was dead and bringing it hard and bringing 
it live, all the while giving respect back to the underground whence 
their vinyl came from. for people it was like an epiphany.. making 
something new out of something old.

    alot of the old music back then was made on junk. the history of 
techno was founded in a city of junk called detroit. adopted and 
nurtured ina cold war hell called berlin and rebuilt in dreary london. 
to me this music was a way out of the bleak and mundane with a promise 
of the future. and that promise was made on mostly defunct analog gear, 
digital keyboards were the way of the future back then. but alot of the 
heads made music on dead gear bringing life to new ideas with the old. 
for example, who the hell has heard what the digital roland tr-707 drum 
machine sounds like (you frontline assembly heads keep quiet)?

    i think there is a certain euphoria that comes from watching records 
spin (marcel duchamp 's dadaist piece 'wheel' attests to this. he said, 
"i just like to watch it spin") and without their presence in full 
analog resolution its just not as cool i think. like what's cooler and 
more psychedelic, the square edged /numerical enforced city,.. or the 
analog countryside? countryside everytime. its like the underlying 
meaning of electronic music is more about natural loops, rotation, 
subtle change and patterns. alot of the early electronic music focuses 
on this. arpegiators and  sequences of phlanging rounded sounding 
effects were used  quite alot. the reference to looping patterns and 
change is all in there in the grooves of vinyl and i really think that's 
super cool. there's art, there's subtlety and respect to the past while 
acknowledging the future.

i know i probably didn't get alot of things right in this so please 
forgive.. and i respect digital production and respect digital djing 
when its done right. but i wanted to say my peace about why i thought 
vinyl has been traditionally regarded as cooler than the digital format. 
i also know there is also a revolution going on in electronic music 
hailing the digital reformation.. i'm not blind. giving props to the 
computer and the future, that is also cool.. but to  disregard the ideas 
and principles of what electronic music was founded on is a bit short 
sighted. i would hope that in the future people will bring the idea of a 
hybrid concept that was also around at the time of the late 80s called 
digalog. its kind of like living in the suburb of trippyness, with the 
convenience of the city a short hop away and the country in your back yard.

respect,
sean ocean
aka dj disconnect

Better get some jet boosters installed on your broom!  I hope they record

Good luck with your ride!

Killer lineup, looks to be an awesome event, but...

Girls in sexy outfits get $5 off at the door?  I don't have a particular
problem with this, it just seems a little inconsistent with what I think of
as the point of having a female-dominated lineup.

And anyway, aren't we past using female talent as a promotional gimmick?
Have an all-female lineup, sure, that's great--but making that the theme of
the event seems a little late 90s to me.

Maybe I'm being overly judgmental.  Just my 2 cents.

Lite Brite is pretty cute too, she played at a party Marshal and I did sound
for down in Santa Cruz.  She was really sweet and fun to talk to and even
more fun to look at.  I know that's the dirty ol man side of me comin out,
but damn.  I despise HHC myself, but if i got something to look at, and a
good stiff drink in my hand, i can almost forget about the headache i'm
getting.

I'm so there. This is just like the dreams I'd have as an adolescent boy
after watching 'Lost in Space'. If I see some girl lookin like ole mrs
robinson there just might be trouble.

but for real. DJ Irene was on my List of DJs to See.

Just hope this party isn't all fucking clubby, like many have been recently.
I've had well enough of that atmosphere; that's what you go to kiddie raves
to /avoid/. Damn.

i'm sure I'll see ALL of you there. esp. Van and Chester the molester. =D

MYAGI (aka Sole Claw)  w/ MC Uprock - Money Shot Recordings / Splank! / 
Funky Cactus (Toronto, Canada)
www.myagimusic.com

"Myagi aka Sole Claw aka Andrew Mavor has shot up like a rocket over the 
last year. Representing Canada internationally, he has played from Seoul to 
San Francisco, Halifax to Brighton, Taipei to Toronto, and has become touted 
as the next major North American breaks don. Comparisons to the other big 
names of the scene seem obvious, but don't really do justice to the range of 
work Myagi has put out, as his releases have varied from hip hop big beat 
infused party breaks through to jackin house and techy big room floor 
fillers.

Dropping a guitar in favor of a synthesizer well before finishing high 
school, Mavor's musical journey has landed him across the board support. The 
late John Peel (the Peel Sessions) used a Myagi track to open his show. 
Front 242 have sent kudos on a track ("Sole Claw - Smartbomb") that was 
licensed to Fingerlickin for the Plump DJ's album "Saturday Night Lotion."

The string of red hot releases that followed have landed him sets on the 
BBC, the CBC and Crystal Method's Community Service and support from 
everyone from Adam Freeland and Meat Katie through to Fatboy Slim and Freddy 
Fresh. Myagi's multi-genre approach to dance music has matured into a true 
journey through b-boy and rave culture, mashing up past and present in one 
of the most high energy, pounding experiences a club could play host to. His 
shows at clubs like The Guvernment in Toronto have led to high profile gigs 
internationally, including such highlights as Fabric in London, Fusion in 
Taiwan and San Francisco's Love Parade, where Myagi played three parties in 
12 hours.

His upcoming releases include remixes for Ursula 1000 (coming out on 
Thievery Corporations label ESL), hip hop don Maestro (as in Fresh Wes), and 
a giant remix for Ricky Stone. He has two tracks licensed to JDS's "Beats N 
Bobs" compilation on Functional Breaks, more remixes in the works, and a 
release schedule that puts most labels to shame. Touring constantly, Myagi 
is one of the hardest working men in the North American dance music, and, 
with his profile rising at an extremely rapid pace he has quickly turned 
himself into a staple of the global breaks scene. "

Forget everything you thought you knew about breaks in San Francisco...you 
ears are about to be flipped!!!

FREE before 10pm!!!!

Next time try drinking three, but each hand can only hold one.  The third must remain in your mouth at all times. Unless you have three arms of course...

Yay, thanks for the plug, Bam =)

We just got back, it was total *omigod* RAVE! No, really! Gave me 
flashbacks from 10 years ago...oh, so THAT's what I looked like!

In all seriousness, once you got past that, it was a really fun party, 
everyone was really into it =)

That crew has some serious balls pulling that off in the middle of the 
south bay, and it's nice to see a part of the scene that's not jaded.

I saw Drumcell at the DNA Lounge during Shane's thing.  They were hella 
good, can't wait to hear them on a decent sound system.  If you're 
techno, then you should make plans to attend.

Two things I always bring camping that I've never regreted carrying are:
 
 1. pint of Jack Daniels
 1 bottle of hotsauce
 
 These seem to always come in handy...
 
 Peace,
 
 Peter

             Study finds no marijuana-lung cancer link 
  
  
---------------------------------
    Marijuana smoking does not increase a person's risk of developing lung cancer, according to the findings of a new study at the University of California Los Angeles that surprised even the researchers.

They had expected to find that a history of heavy marijuana use, like cigarette smoking, would increase the risk of cancer.

Instead, the study, which compared the lifestyles of 611 Los Angeles County lung cancer patients and 601 patients with head and neck cancers with those of 1,040 people without cancer, found no elevated cancer risk for even the heaviest pot smokers. It did find a 20-fold increased risk of lung cancer in people who smoked two or more packs of cigarettes a day.

The study results were presented in San Diego Tuesday at a meeting of the American Thoracic Society.

The study was confined to people under age 60 since baby boomers were the most likely age group to have long-term exposure to marijuana, said Dr. Donald Tashkin, senior researcher and professor at the UCLA School of Medicine.

The results should not be taken as a blank check to smoke pot, which has been associated with problems including cognitive impairment and chronic bronchitis, said Dr. John Hansen-Flaschen, chief of pulmonary and critical care at the University of Pennsylvania Health System in Philadelphia. He was not involved in the study.

Previous studies showed marijuana tar contained about 50 percent more of the chemicals linked to lung cancer, compared with tobacco tar, Tashkin said. In addition, smoking a marijuana joint deposits four times more tar in the lungs than smoking an equivalent amount of tobacco.

"Marijuana is packed more loosely than tobacco, so there's less filtration through the rod of the cigarette, so more particles will be inhaled," Tashkin said in a statement. "And marijuana smokers typically smoke differently than tobacco smokers -- they hold their breath about four times longer, allowing more time for extra fine particles to deposit in the lung."

He theorized that tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, a chemical in marijuana smoke that produces its psychotropic effect, may encourage aging, damaged cells to die off before they become cancerous.

Hansen-Flaschen also cautioned a cancer-marijuana link could emerge as baby boomers age and there may be smaller population groups, based on genetics or other factors, still at risk for marijuana-related cancers

shouldn't we be playing that old game of "I'm Going to a Picnic"? 
you know, where one kid says what he or she is bringing, and the next person 
adds something, and has to remember what the first one said? Then the third 
person adds something and has to remember the first two? 
The way I remember it is:  if you fuck up, you have to take a big chug of 
beer. Molson, eh? (my first year of college was not far from Canada so that's 
why). or you have to smoke a huge rip. Then it gets harder and harder to play. 

"I'm going to Stilldream, and I'm bringing
a cooler, tunes to play in the car, sleeping bag, a flashlight.... "  etc 
Repeat until the car is full! 

I'm really looking forward to the party. The pics are going to be on a new 
site, sfraving.com as soon as we have the site up and running. 
Hurray!

i was only able to swing by for a teeny tiny bit, but for the tad bit
that i was there, the house music was chunky and funky.  i even snuck
up beside the DJ to trainspot a record, the music was that good (and
house is not even my groove thang).  if someone can direct me to more
events with house music like this, i would be much appreciated.

congrats to andrew and crew on a successful event.

i was hoping to swing by bodhisativa, but the bridge fiasco made that
near impossible.

Chuck Love started playing the flute, the coronet, the guitar and started singing, in which he no doubt has an amazing voice, all while he was mixing records!!!!!!!!!  WTF  I didn't know it was gonna be like that!  Then I absolutely loved Andrew Phelan and Origami, so lovely!   I agree more parties like this, the house sounds were beautiful, deep and sexy all nite long!

that i was there, the house music was chunky and funky. i even snuck
up beside the DJ to trainspot a record, the music was that good (and
house is not even my groove thang). if someone can direct me to more
events with house music like this, i would be much appreciated.

congrats to andrew and crew on a successful event.

i was hoping to swing by bodhisativa, but the bridge fiasco made that
near impossible.

Subject: [sfraves] a mix from Stone Lions

Stone Lions:
http://stonelions.net/music/Thump%20Rock%20Mix%20-%20Volume%20One.mp3

Stone Lions (Marine Parade/StoneLions.net) - UK

Stone lions is the first solo project from world-respected producer
Damian Taylor, (not to be confused with German wonder-kid Daniel
Taylor). Damian was deeply involved in the last Prodigy and Freeland
albums and is currently co producing the new Freeland album with Adam.

His debut as Stone Lions 'Snow over Arizona', is a deep rolling
musical masterpiece and very true to the original Marine Parade sound,
remember 9 Nickel? The dub mix is a heavy sound-system onslaught
designed with Adam's Fabric sets in mind.

For more about Stone Lions:

Stone Lions will be playing at Bassdrop!

Subject: [sfraves] Advice on Vancouver scene for aspiring raver friend? 

-------------------------------1149534458
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="US-ASCII"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Hi, I have a friend in the Vancouver area who wants to check out some  
parties and doesn't know where to start. I told him if he goes to one party,  he'll 
get flyers, but so far he's just been to clubs and hasn't found the right  
vibe (yeah it's the same in Canada as it is here! Unless you find the right  
clubs) 
I did a little searching on the Internet but didn't find anything focused  
enough (too many entries for club events). 
Does anybody have recommendations for things like good crews in the  
Vancouver area, local stores that sell vinyl, venues to avoid, anything like  that? 
I remember in 1999 or so that Vancouver had a good reputation for parties,  
but I haven't heard recently. 
I'm half tempted to fly up there and help my friend find the good parties!  
Sounds like a fun vacation. 
Thanks, if anybody has advice for my friend.
JonnyR

was sooo fucking off HOOK!  Heavyweight Dub Champions blew everyone away, I 
have not seen anyone roll around in the dirt in years until this 
party...Sunday's pool party was supposed to be a surprise with having El 
Circo's sound system but up there but the fire marshall ordered everyone to 
pack up and head out.  Thomas' set was sweet, same with Tracy and Ooah, 
Lorin of course. My liver hates me, but we are working out a deal.  Everyone 
was very cool.  We had to close down the party to people who were on there 
way at 9pm saturday night, over 1500 peeps in attendance! but it was still 
golden.  Drum procession was over an hour long and lots of fun....
Props to Little John, Alia and the rest, wolfie and wally with security.
Everyone did a lot of work and it showed.  The most incredible set up  for a 
campout I have ever seen,  Fire tornados, poi, fire breathers, boobs 
everwhere...and then ther was Leslie Ayres making weird, yet yummy drinks
I need water  :P

Was only there for Saturday night- a lotta folks gettin down.  However,
didn't really feel most of lorin's set til the end- but man- lil john laid
it down- I don't understand why everyone left?!  I was pretty amazed at the
setup this year opposed to last- however, it felt like people were not into
it as much as they were last year.  I would've liked to have been at the
party from friday til sunday evening- but sometimes life has other
responsibilities than partying!

It was a cool novelty, but now every freakin' party you go to there're 
people spinning the damn things. It's becoming just as bad as glowsticks on

Subject: [sfraves] Keep those mix CDs hidden!

Here (http://www.courts.state.va.us/opinions/opncavtx/0250053.txt) is a  case where the police in Danville tried to use observation of potentially pirated CDs in someone's car as probable cause for a search which uncovered marijuana.  Note the CDs in question  were identified as pirated simply because they were in "thin cases" and had "homemade labels".  While this case was over turned on appeal, it is clear that police have been given some sort of training by the recording industry in identifying "bogus" CDs.  Other officers may attempt to use observation of such "contraband" materials as probable cause or simply just as an excuse to hassle people and search them.  Those of you seeking to avoid unwanted attention, might want to keep your mix CDs under cover. 
 
 The discussion of the definitions and legal status of mix CDs near the bottom of that page is also interesting IMO...
 
 YMMV.
 
 Peace,
 
 Peter

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Keep those mix CDs hidden!

Well, the case was over turned on appeal but the police did get a conviction in the local court first.  It looks like the law is on the right side here for now, and simple possesion of home recorded CDs is not probable cause.  That doesn't mean that the officers out there are aware of this case however,and they have clearly gotten some sort of "training" from the RIAA or their representatives.  If you read that decision you can also see the bias against EDM and dance music:
 
 
 That In this case, the officers had probable cause to believe the CDs in McLaughlin's vehicle 
failed to "conform to the provisions of  59.1-41.4."  See Code  59.1-41.5.  Testimony from the 
Commonwealth's expert, a former police officer experienced in such things, established that a 
trained officer would easily recognize these CDs to be pirated "DJ mixes" subject to statutory 
confiscation.   Packaged in their characteristic "slimline" cases, illegal "DJ mixes" do not 
identify the manufacturer by "true name and address" as Code  59.1-41.4 requires.  Making 
exactly the same assumption underlying the statute itself, the officers could reasonably conclude 
that intellectual property thieves do not provide such detailed self-disclosures.  
The officers also had ample reason to believe that whoever manufactured these "DJ 
mixes" likely did so (at least likely enough to satisfy probable cause) for the very purpose of 
distribution. 
That is, if its a DJ mix CD, its probably illegal.
 
 Peace,
 
 Peter

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Keep those mix CDs hidden!

Yes well not surprisingly the RIAA training sessions didn't require legal accuracy in the presented materials.  They are pushing their agenda which is anti-piracy and, IMO, also anti-EDM.
 
 Its clearly not illegal to posses home recordings and you can't know if any individual home made recording is illegal simply by looking at it.  You are going to need to listen and then analyze the track listing and licensing.  The RIAA is of course fully aware of this, but apparently this knowledge didn't prevent them from teaching the police officers otherwise.  Having had some dealings with these people I am not surprised at all. YMMV.
 
 Peace,
 
 Peter

As long as you aren't selling mixes or don't include a tracklisting, they're 
legal. Once you bring money into the situation or put that TL on the mix, 
things change.


Not that ANYONE ought to be selling their mixes anyway - it's not only rude, 
but illegal as all hell. If your shit ain't on a major record label, then 
you need to eat the costs like the rest of us...

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Raindance...

Yea my friend Nick and myself were one of the people turned away.  Talk 
about being bummed.  I don't live that far from Tahoe at all so it was quite 
the drive.  After 4 hours + driving and getting there, getting turned away 
was one of the last things I was expecting.  Got out of our car and 
stretched our legs with the door staff for a few minutes.  Then turned back 
around and decided to stop by the Space Girls party in Sunnyvale.

I was crushed.  Can't believe we got that close and had to go home. Shitty 
thing is that we were going to get pre-sales but neither of us has a credit 
card and when our friend was going to buy them for us on wendesday we found 
out that she had to be present for pick up of the tickets so we said screw 
we'll get them at the door. DOH!

Oh well...

Paul

Raindance was pretty freaking amazing.. especially since Diego and the El 
Circo crew were my neighbors.. if you get a chance ask him for a copy of his 
new disk.. crap is the Latin Hip-Hop breaks mix good - will become quite the 
new direction for many I am sure.  Lorin just seems to get better and 
better.. what a soundtrack to a magical night.. HeavyWeight Dub Champions 
are a freak of nature.. their shit is so tight it came out like diamonds.  
The dirt roller.. bwahaha! My friend saw him rollin in the dirt the next 
day.. as he was trying to impress some girl and totally called him on his 
shit " Hey I know you.. youv'e done this before :)" haha Needless to say she 
blew his game.. but you gotta give props to the brutha for trying.

I got dialed into a crew from Sanoma called FutureResident(.com) and a 
beautiful woman whom I hope everyone gets to meet as some point in their 
life named Caroline.  She titles herself a futurist, creating lifestyle 
branding for individuals and helping to shape their future by seeing far 
down the path. I think i am in love again. Oh the love!

My friend Kara who tought me to spin Poi was in a gorgeous feather headdress 
and dancing capoeira to a full on 15 peice tribal drumming section from 
Santacruz.  She is a founding member of one of the bay areas premiere fire 
arts performance troupes called Nocturnal-sunshine 
(http://www.nocturnal-sunshine.com/) good shit.

By far though, the best part of this party was the POOL PARTY with  Joclynne 
throwin down the funky techno while the sun was blazin and hundreds of 
scantily clad and naked peoples imortalized one of the most epic scenes I 
have ever witnessed party side.  Wow! Oh the love!

Well i am gushing now... but what a great time.. everyone was sad it didn't 
go the extra day.. but thanks to the santa cruz and LA kidz for throwin 
down.. can't wait till next year!

we are taking over a whole resort, complete with bathrooms, showers 
and dance floor porta-potties.

This is a FREE gathering, (i.e. No Entrance or parking/camping Fee) 
which means it is what we all make it. To support this gathering 
please LEAVE NO TRACE and prepare to clean up after yourself and to 
urge your neighbors/friends to do the same

create a sacred, mystical setting for us to experience true freedom 
and bliss. If you have decorations, want to volunteer time, anything 
that you think would make this gathering better or safer

Please welcome all the new family members that are traveling from 
across the world to present their music and artistic creations for us

"No sage or savior has ever endorsed greed and gluttony as a path 
toward social justice or personal fulfillment.  These sane and 
enlightened people come to us from all cultures and all eras, 
sometimes knowing of each other but more often not.  Socrates and 
Jesus, Lao Tzu and Tolstoi, Gandhi and Martin Buber -- no one can 
find in their lives and words a jot of support for a political and 
economic regime that encourages the acquisition of wealth far beyond 
what is needed for the necessaries -- or even the restorative 
pleasures -- of life while consigning the masses to live and work in 
squalor."
-Stephen J. Fortunato, Associate Justice, Rhode Island Supreme Court.

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of 
the rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will 
gradually become visible."
-Jacques Attali in his seminal text "Noise"

Many friends and loved ones have been lost. I personally am sucking it up and running the AIDS Marathon this year. I am not much of a runner and have knee issues but I am grateful for my health and hope that I can help bring in money to battle this horrible disease.

National Day of Slayer

6.6.06 isn't a date that comes around very often (once per  
millennium, to be exact), and while plenty of stupid horror movies  
and terrible albums will be released for the hype value of the day  
that bears "the number of the beast", we here at NDoS decided that  
this would be a perfect day for Hessians across the country to come  
together and engage in something upon which we can all agree -  
listening to Slayer! Also, do you really want those evangelical Neo- 
Cons to have all the fun with their "National Day of Prayer"?

Subject: [sfraves] nrr: Looking for new home by 7/1

Wow, so I got this note in the mail saying my lease was up july 1st, they 
want to raise my rent from 1700$ to 2550$!!!! I feel bad for the new roomie 
as he just got settled in, oh well.
WTF, obviously, I would reather try and pay a mortgage...but that wont 
happen either.
Me, 28 in july (happy bday to me) working as a loan officer in Levi's Plaza, 
I am a homo, and fun.  A lot of you know me.  I am looking for a nice SF 
room or space to rent.  I prefer lots of sun/garden type atmosphere with 
great people... I have a lot of things but I am assuming that will be put 
into storage or sold.  If you have any leads, please feel free to contact 
me.  I would like to pay around 800/mo or so.
Thanks,
Danny Picard

Got a HUGE kick out of acapella version of angel of death. Done by those 
that did the music for Katamari Damacy.

Not even close to the awesome that is seeing slayer on 666 -- but I'm 
going to Frontline Assembly tonite! :D

fyi, if anyone is interested ...

message from the washington post magazine

< To commemorate the upcoming 5th anniversary of September 11th 2001,  the
Magazine intends to publish a special photography issue featuring memorials
to victims of the attacks in New York, Washington and Pennsylvania. The
memorials can be located in this area or someplace else in the country or
the world and can range from the very personal, such as body tattoos or a
mural or message painted on a car, to large-scale monuments, murals,
gardens and sculptures. The more unusual or visual, the better. >

Subject: RE: [sfraves] crush-o-matic funkness

Thanks to everyone who made it out and kept the dancefloor rocking until we
shut at 7.  Chuck was amazing I've never seen anyone combine so many skills
behind the decks let alone as seemlessly as he does it.

Bam you must have been talking about when Deron and Mike Frugaletti were
playing, Mike is part of DHP and Deron runs Stompy they have Jason Hodges
coming in on Friday at Mighty he's really really good and in a similar
style.  The Stompy/Sunset parties at Cocomo on 3 day weekends are the best
club event in the city by far, if you've never been you have to go, great
venue great energy.  Stompy is one of the few really pushing the jackin'
style of house in SF right now.

Well, according to the ads, we have a choice between someone who
worships Satan, and another person who eats cute little puppies.

No wonder turnout is so low!

Of course you don't fall under rent control if:

Rent Control Coverage
San Francisco's rent control law covers most rental property in San
Francisco. If you live in San Francisco, you are covered by rent control
unless you fall into one of these major exceptions:

1. You live in a building constructed after June of 1979. This "new
construction exemption" is the biggest exemption in SF and can not be
changed locally because it is mandated by state law.

2. You live in subsidized housing, such as HUD housing projects.

3. You live in a dormitory, monastery, nunnery, etc.

4. You live in a residential hotel and have less than 28 days of
continuous tenancy.

Well, according to the ads, we have a choice between someone who
worships Satan, and another person who eats cute little puppies.

No wonder turnout is so low!

My boyfriend and I are planning a trip to San Francisco to check out the party scene!!  We will be up there from Jul 27 to Aug 1 and we wanted to know what parties (underground mostly please!) that would be going on at that time so we can fully enjoy the San Francisco expierence.  We both live in So Cal and party down there quite a bit, but mostly with underground and crews that we know.  If anyone can help me out I would greatly appreciate it!

Washington - Grammy-winner Billy Preston, often described as the fifth Beatle for his work as a keyboardist with the group, died Tuesday at age 59 in Scottsdale, Arizona, media reports said. 

Preston collaborated with the Liverpool rockers on the albums Let it Be, Abbey Road and the White Album, but also worked with the Rolling Stones, Eric Clapton, Ray Charles and Bob Dylan, to name a few. 

He was signed by Apple records in the 1960s and followed up his collaborations with a string of solo hits, including the Grammy- winning Outta Space, as well as Will It Go Round In Circles, Nothing From Nothing and Space Race. 

Preston died in a hospital in Scottsdale after falling into a coma on November 21, from which he would never emerge, after medical complications that included kidney failure.

"Look at every path closely and deliberately.  Try it as many times as you think necessary.  Then ask yourself and yourself alone one question.  This question is one that only a very old man asks.  My benefactor told me about it once when I was young and my blood was too vigorous for me to understand it.  Now I do understand it.  I will tell you what it is:  'Does this path have a heart?' If it does the path is good.  If it doesn't, it is of no use."

 I've field tested some similar budget menus not that long ago.  OK, its not exactly the most gourmet menu, but it does include "hoe cakes"   You can't go wrong with hoe cakes...

Cool, Philip.  I wish I'd had a book like this back when I owned some land.
 
 Do they include growing the ingredients for hoe cakes?
 
 We must keep our priorities straight.

it's doable...but i think with the prices at some bay
area stores it would be a lot more than $45 :\

My friend just bought a house complete with a backyard featuring fruit
bearing trees for all the major fruits and some veggies. I thought this
feature was a much better selling point then then the 3 car garage.

Now if I can just get him to plant some poppies, you know that illegal act
that Thomas Jefferson was guilty of.... growing poppies.

Next we'll have to source some acetic acid.

Then Jail.

oh well, guess we'll just stick to feeding the families with home grown
food.

Subject: [sfraves] Hyperreal Donations Time!

Hey everyone,

Some of the other hyperreal lists are pitching in cash (via PayPal) for 
hyperreal's next upgrade, I figure SFR should jump on the bandwagon too.

Steph is handling donations, I spoke w/ her and she said she'll handle 
donations from SFR too.

So come on and be cool, everyone knows that the cool kids donate to 
hyperreal, and you want to be cool, don't you? ;-)

-terry

>From Steph:
-------------------------------
Hyperreal's getting upgraded soon, so it sounds like a good time to do 
another round of donations!  The server houses not
only this list but SFR and many others as well, so if you could even spare 
a few bucks please go ahead and paypal it to me at 
steph@hyperreal.org.

thanks all!

The Extra Credit presents:

FIELD DAY!
July 14- July 16, 2006


Pining for the days of Summer Camp? Well, pine no more! The Extra
Credit will be throwing a campout located three hours from the Bay
Area to bring back those golden summer days of yore. Enjoy games like
Capture the Flag, Red Rover, Tug o' War, Kick Ball, and many more.
Groove to Downtempo, Trip-Hop, Hip-hop, IDM, and little bit of House
from two different stages. Roast S'mores and pop popcorn over an open
bonfire. Stop by our outdoor theater for a screening of the best 80s
movies under the stars. Prepare to become ecstatic with glee in a
bygone era of Pixie Stix, lemonade, and PB&J sandwiches. FIELD DAY! is
near!

More info coming soon....

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Feed a family of four for $45 a week

Gardening fucking rocks!!

In the garden we grew last year I planted somewhere in the
nieghborhood of 6,000 poppy seeds, but I started WAY too late in the
season and not one damn one of them took.

grrrrh!!!!!

For those of you that have gmail the sunflower that I'm using as my
avatar pic is one that I grew ourselves, as well as these lovelies:
http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v377/fabucat/Fruits%20And%20Vegetables/
http://tinyurl.com/lj949

here's a description of what we had growing between June and September:

So far, this year, we've got the following crops:

Cucumbers

Corn, Silver Dollar and Yellow

3-5 varieties of lettuce to include:

Arugula
Romaine
Endive
&
Mustard

Tomatoes to include:

Cherry
Roma
Beefsteak
&
Heirloom

Zucchini
Broccoli
Asparagus
Eggplant

Okra! Okra! Okra!

Peppers, Green and Purple

String Beans
Wax Beans
Italian Green Beans

Parsley
Sage
Rosemay
Thyme
Oregano
Basil, green and purple
Cilantro

Acorn Squash
Squash Squash
(see Misc Silly folder , Joel, you should really like this one, feel
free to pass it along to your friends on the internets.)

Pumpkins

Watermelon
Cantaloupe

Sunflowers, little ones and some fucking spectacular  12'-15 footers

and....

Catnip, because they're GOOD Cats!

Whew.

Until I actually sat down and wrote this above list out, I had no idea
that we had this much going on.

Wow.

This is really cool.

Of course, me being the Bizness Man that I am, there is a matter of
expense involved in all this.

The greatest being is the labor costs involved, but since we do that
on our time, we'll just write that one off.

Next is the water, especially this year since it's so dry, and
according to our bill for this summer, we're about $150-200 over
normal useage for a household our size.

Then comes the seeds, which at most was $50.

So the break-even point for this cornucopia of ours is between $200-$250usd.

That's pretty good, considering that it's a little over a month's
worth of groceries at the Safeway.

Added bonus, the time we're out in the garden is time that we're not
cruising Safeway's aisless getting visually assaulted by all that
Madison Avenue Product Packaging Come-ons that infest every shelf.

Anything that helps preserve my Mental Health Bandwidth and away from
flashy, eye-catching, logos that peddle toxins passing themselves off
as "food" is awesome.

Ya think?

Now, with a garden like this, there is a lot to keep track of.

For example, the Okra, Okra, Okra!!!

Jesus H. Christ on a shingle, does that shit grow fast.

If I ever get into Time Lapse Photography, they'll be an excellent
subject to do that sort of thing with.


Fucking awesome, kills me I'm NYC and in school so I'm not doing this this year.

the great thing about papaver somniferum seeds is that you don't really  
need to plant them.  just go nuts and spread them around everywhere,  
and wait for the rain.

if you planted them too late, there's a good chance that about half of  
them will sprout next spring. once they get established, they spread  
like crazy.

I don't care about that, personally. Though, I'd rather donate in a

If hyperreal isn't a 501(c) corp. it should become one.  There are many advantages including the ability to apply for grants from foundations and <gasp> the government.  It also avoids bad tax consequences for individuals that accept "donations" only to find out later that the IRS think these are "personal income".
 
 I've started two 510(c)3 corps FWIW...

Okay, before this conversation degrades into a discussion about tax
shelters, Darwin & Nazis, please donate!

There are several hundred people on this list, if people could just
throw in $5 that would be grate! There are no ads, no annoying
'partner' newsletters and most of all, it would be appreciated and put
to good use.

Thanks again to Brian & Co for their dedication and time to keeping
Hyperreal and other lists alive.

Absolutely, but I still don't know whom to make the check out to (Hyperreal Inc.?  Brian?  Terry?) or for that matter where to send it!

Okay, before this conversation degrades into a discussion about tax
shelters, Darwin & Nazis, please donate!

There are several hundred people on this list, if people could just
throw in $5 that would be grate! There are no ads, no annoying
'partner' newsletters and most of all, it would be appreciated and put
to good use.

Thanks again to Brian & Co for their dedication and time to keeping
Hyperreal and other lists alive.

We'll be setting up at one of our favorite outdoor locations this friday.
The party is a very, VERY short drive from SF (on the same side of the bay),
so if you're just getting out from a club or underground at 4am, you may
want to cruise on over!

Hey all,

Just wanted to let you know that tomorrow we've got
Space Cowboy extraordinaire Ernie Trevino joining us
at Broke-Ass Thursdays tomorrow. Ernie is seriously
one of the most talented DJs I know, and I'm sure he's
gonna kill it with his slammin' tracks and
butter-smooth mixes - we really hope you can come
witness this turntable badass in action with us.

Ask the bartenders for this week's drink specials, or
check the specials board. Usually, it's an imported
beer for $3, and a shot special.

Broke-Ass Thursdays are always free, the first beat
drops at 9pm, and we go 'til 2am. @lpha bar is located
at 3848 Geary, at the corner of 3rd Ave. We hope to
see you there! 

-Evan

1. Creativity and innovation always builds on the past.
2. The past always tries to control the creativity that builds on it.
3. Free societies enable the future by living in the past.
4. Ours is a less and less a free society.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Hyperreal Donations Time!

A few answers (best I can do):

Hyperreal is not a 501(c). Not exactly sure why, but given Brian's vast 
experience with corportions, incl. 501(c), and LLC's, I'm sure there's a 
reason.

Donations are *not* tax-deductible.

I'm not sure exactly what the upgrades are, aside from a new 2u box.

from Brian:
"Since 2003 or so, Hyperreal has been a dual-PIII 1.2Mhz box with 2GB of 
RAM and 160GB of RAID-ed hard disk space running
FreeBSD 4. About every 3 years I buy a new box, whatever is the latest and 
greatest that can run in a 2U rack mount space, and
I'm making plans to buy just such a new beastie."

I can find out specfics for the gearheads on this list.

Lastly, as mentioned in the original posting, PayPal donations to:

hope this helps,

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Hyperreal Donations Time!

A few answers (best I can do):

Hyperreal is not a 501(c). Not exactly sure why, but given Brian's vast 
experience with corportions, incl. 501(c), and LLC's, I'm sure there's a 
reason.

Donations are *not* tax-deductible.

I'm not sure exactly what the upgrades are, aside from a new 2u box.

from Brian:
"Since 2003 or so, Hyperreal has been a dual-PIII 1.2Mhz box with 2GB of 
RAM and 160GB of RAID-ed hard disk space running
FreeBSD 4. About every 3 years I buy a new box, whatever is the latest and 
greatest that can run in a 2U rack mount space, and
I'm making plans to buy just such a new beastie."

I can find out specfics for the gearheads on this list.

Lastly, as mentioned in the original posting, PayPal donations to:

vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv

steph@hyperreal.org

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

hope this helps,

"Breaks DO Kill" ?

Hrm...didn't he already release one called "If Breaks Could Kill" ?

If so, that kid needs some new mix titles, lol.

The last mix he put out I heard people raving about was his Remix mix - 
should be on his site: www.aaronjae.com

MYAGI (aka Sole Claw)  w/ MC Uprock - Money Shot Recordings / Splank! / 
Funky Cactus (Toronto, Canada)
www.myagimusic.com

"Myagi aka Sole Claw aka Andrew Mavor has shot up like a rocket over the 
last year. Representing Canada internationally, he has played from Seoul to 
San Francisco, Halifax to Brighton, Taipei to Toronto, and has become touted 
as the next major North American breaks don. Comparisons to the other big 
names of the scene seem obvious, but don't really do justice to the range of 
work Myagi has put out, as his releases have varied from hip hop big beat 
infused party breaks through to jackin house and techy big room floor 
fillers.

Dropping a guitar in favor of a synthesizer well before finishing high 
school, Mavor's musical journey has landed him across the board support. The 
late John Peel (the Peel Sessions) used a Myagi track to open his show. 
Front 242 have sent kudos on a track ("Sole Claw - Smartbomb") that was 
licensed to Fingerlickin for the Plump DJ's album "Saturday Night Lotion."

The string of red hot releases that followed have landed him sets on the 
BBC, the CBC and Crystal Method's Community Service and support from 
everyone from Adam Freeland and Meat Katie through to Fatboy Slim and Freddy 
Fresh. Myagi's multi-genre approach to dance music has matured into a true 
journey through b-boy and rave culture, mashing up past and present in one 
of the most high energy, pounding experiences a club could play host to. His 
shows at clubs like The Guvernment in Toronto have led to high profile gigs 
internationally, including such highlights as Fabric in London, Fusion in 
Taiwan and San Francisco's Love Parade, where Myagi played three parties in 
12 hours.

His upcoming releases include remixes for Ursula 1000 (coming out on 
Thievery Corporations label ESL), hip hop don Maestro (as in Fresh Wes), and 
a giant remix for Ricky Stone. He has two tracks licensed to JDS's "Beats N 
Bobs" compilation on Functional Breaks, more remixes in the works, and a 
release schedule that puts most labels to shame. Touring constantly, Myagi 
is one of the hardest working men in the North American dance music, and, 
with his profile rising at an extremely rapid pace he has quickly turned 
himself into a staple of the global breaks scene. "

Forget everything you thought you knew about breaks in San Francisco...you 
ears are about to be flipped!!!

FREE before 10pm!!!!

Hi,

Everyone expected House Republicans to give up efforts to kill NPR and =
PBS after a massive public outcry stopped them last year. But they've =
just voted to eliminate funding for NPR and PBSunbelievably, starting =
with programs like "Sesame Street."

Public broadcasting would lose nearly a quarter of its federal funding =
this year. Even worse, all funding would be eliminated in two =
years--threatening one of the last remaining sources of watchdog =
journalism.

Sign the petition telling Congress to save NPR and PBS again this year:

http://civic.moveon.org/publicbroadcasting/


Last year, millions of us took action to save NPR and PBS, and Congress =
listened. We can do it again if enough of us sign the petition in time.

This would be the most severe cut in the history of public broadcasting. =
The Boston Globe reports the cuts "could force the elimination of some =
popular PBS and NPR programs." NPR's president expects rural public =
radio stations may be forced to shut down.

The House and Senate are deciding if public broadcasting will survive, =
and they need to hear from viewers like you. Sign the petition at:

http://civic.moveon.org/publicbroadcasting/

Thanks!

P.S. Read the Boston Globe story on the threat to NPR and PBS at:

It is a good thing that these are 21+ events...  The way the scene has grown 
has headed towards responsibility, granted not all 21+ are that way, nor are 
all peeps under 21 are irresponsible...but for the welfare of the party it 
is best and plus, there are still parties called popsickle  ;)

And sfraves...

In fact you should assume that every bit sent on the Internet is comprimised at this point.  Don't openly publish stuff on the Internet that you don't want to make public.  Especially someplace like MySpace which is owned by Rupert Murdoch now.  Read the fine print in their user agreement and see what rights they claim to your publications.

Regards,

Peter

They claim full rights.  So, upload a song, it's theirs. :(

Also, note that in Myspace (and other site) profiles can be searched by  
name. So, you might have a job interview and they type in your name and find  that 
you go to parties every weekend or whatever. 
A couple ways around this: 
When you first got onto myspace, you might have typed in your real name,  but 
there is actually no need to do this. Go in and change your name. I just  
left in the first letter of my last name. Then, nobody can search for the  
profile by name. 
Another way is to say in your profile that you're under 15 years old. Then,  
only your friends can see your profile. 
Some friend was warning me that companies are typing names into myspace to  
see what comes up, and then I read something about it in the newspaper.  
Companies are not allowed to ASK a lot of things in an interview, but if you  post 
information yourself and they happen to find it, it's fair game, and you  might 
not get that job. 
 
Another way: put in your pr

i know ruby skye can draw alot of people but still having a major act like that on a thursday night kind of surprised me... they're on tour though so i guess the booking was meant to fill an open night but their next performance is in israel so who knows...
anyway, i missed it last night as i was at catalyst cocktails for electron's opening night... i'm not a very big fan of infected's music anymore... i feel like after *classical mushroom* their style really went downhill even though they had some nice tracks on *bp empire* and *converting vegetarians*
glad you had fun though... =)

Actually there's currently a big fuss over this exact issue:

http://publishing2.com/2006/06/07/billy-bragg-walks-away-from-myspace/

And myspace's response:

Myspace.com spokesman Jeff Berman says, 'Because the legalese has caused some confusion, we are at work revising it to make it very clear that MySpace is not seeking a license to
do anything with an artist's work other than allow it to be shared in the manner the artist intends. Obviously, we don't own their music or do anything with it that they don't want.'

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Save PBS & NPR

Honestly, I think the company better start coming up with some better
programming fast then. I don't listen to NPR.

Plus, there's always advertising revinue they can tap into, which
they've blatantly refused to.

Honestly, I'm one of those people who hates PBS and NPR anyhow. This
has nothing to do with politics, and has everything to do with the
fact that it doesn't speak to me on any level whatsoever anymore.

They no longer have the nature market, since discovery, tlc, etc took
that away from them. There's tons of alternative

PS. PBS didn't come up with sesame street, Jim Hensen did.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Save PBS & NPR

Fresh Air is hands down one of the best interview shows out there. I 
have heard everything from politicians sweating bullets from some of the 
difficult questions presented to spongebob being goofy. This American 
Life is a touching and powerful portrayal of everyday people and the 
ways they negotiate the world. Marketplace takes more of a worldly, 
democratic approach to money and finance, as opposed to the usual 
sources that takes it from the spin that greed comes before all else.

Spark on PBS is a bay area artist series that presents in depth 
documentary video on painters, filmmakers, sculptures, fire artist, 
eclectics, and galleries. You think local news presents in depth clips 
about the local arts? Not any that I've seen.

 I don't believe there is a wider breadth of programming in existence 
than whats on NPR and PBS. In america, at least.

I happen to adore NPR. I love Car Talk. Not because I have any real interes=
t
in cars or how to fix them, but just because its an awesome show. I agree
that Fresh Air is killer, and This American Life is the most amazing show
I've ever listened to. In addition, I absolutely love Prairie Home
Companion. There is nothing out there that can even compare to it.

PBS puts out Frontline, which is the last honest and educated documentaries
out there. I also have a soft spot for Nova (the nature and science show).

The fact that there are no advertisements is what initially drew me in. The=
y
are also what keeps me there. I'd rather not have my brain spammed with
Cheeto's and Count Chocula. My boyfriend and I make regular donations, and
we are just regular people with regular jobs.

I make fun of myself sometimes because I used to think my dad was such a
dork for listening to that stuff. But at the old age of 23, I am already in
love with it.

The only people that say they "hate" NPR and PBS are the ones that haven't
watched it. People (especially Americans) tend to "hate" things that they
don't understand or refuse to learn about.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Save PBS & NPR

The problem with 'selling out' to advertising revenue is that advertisers
can start pushing their agenda's on you once they know you depend on their
money.  From there they can sway and put pressure on people to play or not
play certain kinds of content with the threat of pulling advertising from
it.  Typically when this is threatened, its not just one sponsor but an ad
agency's pipeline of advertising that gets pulled.  This is why
listener/watcher sponsored media is so important.  Say PBS starts working
with an ad agency who handles something like chevy or ford.. then PBS
decides to have some indepth reporting about Microsoft and antitrust cases
but the ad agency also handles Microsoft.  Microsoft could (and would) put
pressure on the ad agency to either pull their contract with PBS or force
PBS to not air or change an episode.

 No downtempo in sight for this one, but a sure fire crazy party.
  
 
 
  
 For our biggest Funkycozy yet, Damian will be back in San Francisco doing another exclusive set for us @ Mighty. For those of you who got to check out Damian at our last Funkycozy, he played some phenomenal music that you're not likely to hear at your regular parties. We're really excited that he is back in town. We have an excellent lineup of Funkycozy and Kontrol residents to kick things off - so make sure you don't miss out and get yourselves a pre-sale ticket now!

Greetings and Namaste,

The time has come once again for the legendary and much anticipated northern
California underground outdoor music festival lovingly known as GEMINI. This
gathering is dedicated to unifying our bay area, USA, and international
global music family. Artists from all over the world and many nations have
committed to creating an intentional community located in our own private
town called Belden, 3.5hrs NE of San Francisco (full directions from all
areas below) . That's right, we are taking over a whole resort, complete
with bathrooms, showers and dance floor porta-potties.

This is a FREE gathering, (i.e. No Entrance or parking/camping Fee) which
means it is what we all make it. To support this gathering please LEAVE NO
TRACE and prepare to clean up after yourself and to urge your
neighbors/friends to do the same Please CARPOOL to save room for camping and
for the environment. =)

We are calling out to any and all participants who would like to help create
a sacred, mystical setting for us to experience true freedom and bliss. If
you have decorations, want to volunteer time, anything that you think would
make this gathering better or safer Please contact: Richard
(wichdokta@hotmail.com)

Please welcome all the new family members that are traveling from across the
world to present their music and artistic creations for us enjoy. The new
energy is going to be very welcome on the dance floor. 
This is going to be something a very unique and special gathering.

We proudly present 3 stages of different music for your listening pleasure.
a dance stage, chill area and we have a whole stage of live rock n roll,
jam, hip-hop, "techno" and reggae style bands during the day and early
evening to bring back that old GEMINI vibe. PLEASE
NOTE: Renegade sound systems will not be tolerated, you will be shut down
and kindly asked to leave the gathering. Spread the word to all family and
friends about this UNIQUE and SACRED gathering and the amazing new venue. So
get ready to have a great time and collectively transform this town into a
"PSYCHEDELIC CITY".

"No sage or savior has ever endorsed greed and gluttony as a path toward
social justice or personal fulfillment.  These sane and enlightened people
come to us from all cultures and all eras, sometimes knowing of each other
but more often not.  Socrates and Jesus, Lao Tzu and Tolstoi, Gandhi and
Martin Buber -- no one can find in their lives and words a jot of support
for a political and economic regime that encourages the acquisition of
wealth far beyond what is needed for the necessaries -- or even the
restorative pleasures -- of life while consigning the masses to live and
work in squalor."
-Stephen J. Fortunato, Associate Justice, Rhode Island Supreme Court.

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Weekend Adventures

Favorite quote this weekend: "Don't blow up the spot - park accross the 
street"

Man was this weekend rediculous.. wtf is up with acid totem these days?? The 
beach spot was mad.. ripple was there with gamma who hooked me up with a 
ticket for stilldream (still don't know if I can go).. spun some fire with 
opulent temple at ocean, and got to hang out with some new girlfriends.. 
yeah for being single for the first time in seven years :)  Then Sat was THE 
ROOTS!!! with Blacklicious (hell ya) followed by NK7.  Man was it hot as 
hell in there.. nice touch with the fans though and the music was 
incredible.  That party was phat..  Isacc was working door and he is by far 
one of the coolest mofos on the planet, and I met this whole russian 
collective.. well thier girlfriends anyway.. but that smoking / chillroom 
was the bomb for quite a while.  Bounced, went to Detention, and proceeded 
to get very drunk in the hot tub.. and then got lost upstairs in a blanket 
fort :-) Yes.. home at 8:30am every day this weekend.. time to rest.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] RIP Billy Preston


Whaaa, just saw this.

Billy Preston was one of those people who could sing a song you didn't 
like so much and turn it into something amazing.  Same melody, new tune.

Check the George Harrison Memorial Concert DVD for an amazing instance of 
this ability, his solo and verse contribution to the cheeseball 
supergroup's performance of "Isn't it a Pity" are just godly (and leave 
Eric Clapton looking like a mumbling no talent hack).  Amazing voice, the 
kind of beaming presence that makes you just want to spend a day with him 
asking questions and just listening and the guy could play the shit out of 
a Hammond B3 Organ, Clavinet and Fender Rhodes like few have or ever will.  
A true gospel, blues and rock virtuoso without ever betraying himself or 
the songs he played (well, some of the 70s organ pop cover compilations 
are pretty bad, but even they found their way into sample heavy albums 
like "Check your Head" by the Beastie Boys [even though Mario Caldatto is 
a badass keyboard player himself and was present for those sessions]).  
His discography reads like a list of high points of the bands he worked 
with, some of the most lasting work of the 20th century.  He wrote "you 
are so beautiful" for joe cocker.  Played keys for Sam Cooke, Little 
Richard, Beatles and their later solo projects, Aretha Franklin, Jackson5, 
Sly Stone, Eric Clapton, Neil Diamond and Bob Dylan (in most cases on 
their strongest work).

much respect to a life well lived,
andyw

p.s.	extra kudos for putting out an album in 1965 entitled "most 
exciting organ ever".

p.p.s.	check out the "12 songs" release by Neil Diamond if you haven't... 
it's actually quite amazing (Rick Rubin produced, came out last year)

BIOS:

RYAN CROSSON
Born and raised in Metro-Detroit, Ryan discovered electronic music in his
late teenage years. After strictly DJing for a few years, he took the next
logical step by beginning to produce his own music in Fall 2003.  Drawing
from artists like Plastikman, Matthew Dear, Stewart Walker, and a heavy dos=
e
of Magda DJ sets, Ryan focused his attention on percussive programming,
dubby basslines, and dark atmospheres.  By expressing a tireless work ethic
in the studio, Ryan was soon noticed for his efforts by local Detroit label=
,
Beretta Music.  Not long after this, Ryan signed music to Cologne based
label Trapez Limited, just one year after he began writing music.  The EP
release on Trapez LTD. titled, "Say So " was well received with many
positive reviews from a plethora of international artists. In the Summer of
2005, Ryan played his first international dates with impressive live
performances in Berlin, and Cologne.  He has recently taken on a production
alais, "Berg Nixon" under which he was honored with a track on the latest
M-nus compilation, "min2MAX", as well as scoring a pair of remixes for the
latest Troy Pierce 12", "25 Bitches". Current influences include Pierce,
Ricardo Villalobos, Matthew Dear, and Guido Schneider. Talented and driven,
this young Detroit native is making an impact internationally with his
music.   Look for upcoming releases and remixes in the coming months from
Ryan on Minus, Beretta Grey, Telegraph and Trapez Ltd.

LEE CURTISS
Lee has always found sanctuary in the corners of his mind, for in the
corners you will find your true nature and true creative being. His mission
is to free people from the confines of the music they are accustomed to
listening to and elevate electronic music to the next level. He found
himself fixated on music from an early age, constantly learning more about
music as he taught himself to play several instruments over time. When he
found the dance music scene, he immediately moved away from rock oriented
instruments and gravitated toward electronic music. He was completely
fascinated by the anonymity of artists, the raw power of the music and how
it made the crowd move with every churning rhythm until it seemed everyone
was ready to lose their minds all at once. After traveling to Detroit and
Chicago he realized that he had something to contribute to this music and
began collecting records and DJing in 2000. Two years later he had amassed
enough knowledge and equipment to commit to producing full force. He soon
relocated from Grand Rapids to Detroit where he broadened his musical scope
and continued sharpening his skills. His music has become a heavily German
influenced form of minimal with an unorthodox approach to textures and
rhythms, using lo fidelity to create elements of disarray surrounded by
crunching beats, tweaky synthlines, held together by bubble gum sticky bass
lines. With a recent 3 month tour of Europe behind him, a track on the new
Audion Fabric mix, and upcoming releases on Spectral Sound, Underl_ne, and
Milnor Modern, Lee Curtiss is an artist clearly on his way up and showing n=
o
signs of slowing down.

You know, I actually had a rather unexpectedly remarkable Friday night. Started at UndergroundSF to join my friends in visiting their oldest and dearest friend Jen from Maine  - http://www.popgirl23.com/. We were just about the only people there, and we danced our asses off all over the floor while she played some lovely house. Fun!
   
  Then, my friend Rocky was throwing his first ever underground in a warehouse space on Brannan and 7th. ForestGreen played, and Popgirl again, and my friend Scott played some hard 90's acid trance from Denmark, I think. 
   
  This was, without a doubt, the most underground underground I have been. It was literally in a stinking, moldy basement full of cigarette smoke, blinking lights and strobes abound, and packed with 18-year old candy ravers absolutely rolling their asses off. My friends and I are all in our 30's and arrived sober. We were hugged and giggled upon as soon as we arrived, and looked around delighted and agog at the spectacle of pacifiers, toys, blinkies, stuffed animals and dry humping all over the floor. Conga lines of b-boys in baggy pants, pretending to sit in the 'car' that someone was 'driving', little girls with animal backpacks holding hands and staring at the twirling lights, a gorgeous young thing who danced with me with melting brown eyes and a bambi smile, puddles of people on the filthy floor, the endless blinkies in my face as I danced, mistaking my energy for anything other than natural adrenaline. It was like raver preschool. I say this with love - seriously, it
 was hilarious. I haven't seen a pacifier on the dance floor in years, and it was like - oh god, just took us all back. We were the only sober adults who could talk to the police when they arrived (just a friendly party, no worries, no closure!), we danced hard and handed out gum and water bottles, and just looked at the new generation of kids doing their thing on a Friday night. We stayed until the smell got the best of us and left the young'ns to party the night away in the dank basement. I'm very proud of Rocky - he did a great job. 
   
  Freaking pacifiers - heelarious! Ah, to be that young again..

Subject: Re: [sfraves] who raved this weekend?

You know, I actually had a rather unexpectedly remarkable Friday night. Started at UndergroundSF to join my friends in visiting their oldest and dearest friend Jen from Maine  - http://www.popgirl23.com/. We were just about the only people there, and we danced our asses off all over the floor while she played some lovely house. Fun!
   
  Then, my friend Rocky was throwing his first ever underground in a warehouse space on Brannan and 7th. ForestGreen played, and Popgirl again, and my friend Scott played some hard 90's acid trance from Denmark, I think. 
   
  This was, without a doubt, the most underground underground I have been. It was literally in a stinking, moldy basement full of cigarette smoke, blinking lights and strobes abound, and packed with 18-year old candy ravers absolutely rolling their asses off. My friends and I are all in our 30's and arrived sober. We were hugged and giggled upon as soon as we arrived, and looked around delighted and agog at the spectacle of pacifiers, toys, blinkies, stuffed animals and dry humping all over the floor. Conga lines of b-boys in baggy pants, pretending to sit in the 'car' that someone was 'driving', little girls with animal backpacks holding hands and staring at the twirling lights, a gorgeous young thing who danced with me with melting brown eyes and a bambi smile, puddles of people on the filthy floor, the endless blinkies in my face as I danced, mistaking my energy for anything other than natural adrenaline. It was like raver preschool. I say this with love - seriously, it
 was hilarious. I haven't seen a pacifier on the dance floor in years, and it was like - oh god, just took us all back. We were the only sober adults who could talk to the police when they arrived (just a friendly party, no worries, no closure!), we danced hard and handed out gum and water bottles, and just looked at the new generation of kids doing their thing on a Friday night. We stayed until the smell got the best of us and left the young'ns to party the night away in the dank basement. I'm very proud of Rocky - he did a great job. 
   
  Freaking pacifiers - heelarious! Ah, to be that young again..

i am a huge proponent of the idea that old ravers need to be
reintroduced to the young raver vibe every so often.

it's a kick in the pants to stop acting jaded and elitist and to
remember a more innocent time of fun.

Define "old ravers"?  Geriatric or what?

I went to this 3 day camp out thing way out in the middle of no where. It was kick ass. I got there and was like wtf is this. There was Psy trance and some other stuff and some other stuff. So I'm walking around and I go to the psy trance sound stage, they were playing some good beats. Out of no where some hippie dude comes up to me and puts his hand out, I was like he wants to shake my hand? I put my hand out and he slaps this friggin fat ass nug into my hand and walks away. I was like whoah, this is the most kick ass thing thats ever happend to me. He asked me if I wanted anything to eat, I got like an Orange it was coo. I came hella unpreparied. I basicly just came with the clothes on my back. Me and my friend were post to get there at like 10-12 am on friday night but didnt end up getting there till 5am on sat. We were gonna stay there for just 1 night. THe trip there was crazy the nearest store was like 40-60 miles away, I didnt think it was that so I was assed out. So
 after that guy gave me that I start walking around chopping it up with other people, I was so happy when the guy gave me that I wanted to share that experince with everyone else around me. I went around and smoked out everyone I possibly could. I was gone. After a while I went to the spot where my friend set up camp. Me and a group other people were posted there for a good bit. There was people from all over the fucking place, out of the state, people not from the us. Everyone had good vibes. I was chillin by the camp fire and some girl comes up to me and asked me if I wanted to chill I was like aight. We head over to the chill area and she starts feeding me food! I was like what! what! It was like I was in heaven. The thing that tripped me out the most was that everyone left there stuff out in the open. No one jacked anything from anyone. Like everytime I go to a partie you had to keep your shit on lock down or you would lose it. This partie was different. The only thing
 that was being taken were good vibes, good vibes being taken and passed around. Going to these types of parties gives ya a different perspective on things. Everyone should just be chill, hugs and hand shakes for everyone! Its nice to know theres people out there like this. I'm gonna stop typing and get some breakfest. Everyone have a good week.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] who raved this weekend?

I'm ready!  There's just one problem: no babysitter.

Maybe the old schoolers can trade the candy ravers for some babysitting services?   Hmm.

No pacifier sharing puleez!

Peace,

Peter

P.S. Actually none of my kids has ever used a pacifier but that's not funny.

i am a huge proponent of the idea that old ravers need to be
reintroduced to the young raver vibe every so often.

it's a kick in the pants to stop acting jaded and elitist and to
remember a more innocent time of fun.

My friends and I are all in our 30's and arrived sober.

Conga lines of b-boys in baggy pants, pretending to sit in the 'car' that someone was 'driving', little girls with animal backpacks holding hands and staring at the twirling lights, a gorgeous young thing who danced with me with melting brown eyes and a bambi smile, puddles of people on the filthy floor, the endless blinkies in my face as I danced, mistaking my energy for anything other than natural adrenaline.

 it

We were the only sober adults who could talk to the police when they arrived (just a friendly party, no worries, no closure!), we danced hard and handed out gum and water bottles, and just looked at the new generation of kids doing their thing on a Friday night. We stayed until the smell got the best of us and left the young'ns to party the night away in the dank basement. I'm very proud of Rocky - he did a great job.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] who raved this weekend?

You know, I actually had a rather unexpectedly remarkable Friday night.
Started at UndergroundSF to join my friends in visiting their oldest and
dearest friend Jen from Maine  - http://www.popgirl23.com/. We were just
about the only people there, and we danced our asses off all over the floor
while she played some lovely house. Fun!

  Then, my friend Rocky was throwing his first ever underground in a
warehouse space on Brannan and 7th. ForestGreen played, and Popgirl again,
and my friend Scott played some hard 90's acid trance from Denmark, I
think.

  This was, without a doubt, the most underground underground I have been.
It was literally in a stinking, moldy basement full of cigarette smoke,
blinking lights and strobes abound, and packed with 18-year old candy
ravers absolutely rolling their asses off. My friends and I are all in our
30's and arrived sober. We were hugged and giggled upon as soon as we
arrived, and looked around delighted and agog at the spectacle of
pacifiers, toys, blinkies, stuffed animals and dry humping all over the
floor. Conga lines of b-boys in baggy pants, pretending to sit in the 'car'
that someone was 'driving', little girls with animal backpacks holding
hands and staring at the twirling lights, a gorgeous young thing who danced
with me with melting brown eyes and a bambi smile, puddles of people on the
filthy floor, the endless blinkies in my face as I danced, mistaking my
energy for anything other than natural adrenaline. It was like raver
preschool. I say this with love - seriously, it
 was hilarious. I haven't seen a pacifier on the dance floor in years, and
it was like - oh god, just took us all back. We were the only sober adults
who could talk to the police when they arrived (just a friendly party, no
worries, no closure!), we danced hard and handed out gum and water bottles,
and just looked at the new generation of kids doing their thing on a Friday
night. We stayed until the smell got the best of us and left the young'ns
to party the night away in the dank basement. I'm very proud of Rocky - he
did a great job.

  Freaking pacifiers - heelarious! Ah, to be that young again..

Subject: [sfraves] BSP: BASSDROP - Deep Impact, Stone Lions @ BOCA

Bassdrop
Wednesday June 21st, 2006
@ Boca (414 Jessie St.)
9pm-2am
21+ w/ID
only $5


You know how Evil Breaks does it. Super cheap with sick talent. Help
us kick off our new monthly @ BOCA with not one, but two amazing
headliners. We've taken over 3rd Wednesdays and from now on, hump day
won't be so bad. Ed209 to follow in July, and Carbon Community to
follow in August.


Featuring:

Deep Impact (Broke/Lot 49/Super Charged/Plastic Raygun/Cyberfunk) - UK

Deep Impact (aka Mark East) is a DJ/Producer from the UK who
originally started out as a Drum & Bass DJ way back in 1994, mainly
DJing in clubs and on the UKs extreme sport circuit with fellow DJ, DJ
Dust (Sie Dyson). Around 1999 the pair were hearing more and more of a
new sound that was emerging in the UK called Breakbeat and decided to
team up in the studio to have a go themselves, the subsequent track
was called "Give It" which was signed to Plastic Raygun.

Mark continued to produce with Simon moving to Brighton based
Supercharged to record tracks like "Methods" and "I Love Music" along
with remixes for The Freestylers. But unfortunately due to family
commitments Simon would have to quit, the pair's last work together
would be the mix album "Heavy Weight Breaks 2" and after a tour Simon
hung up his headphones.

Mark continued to DJ and produce and went on to write tracks such as
"Carpet Muncher" for Cyberfunk, "Rock Tha House" with fellow heavy
weight Distortionz and set up his own label Broke Recordings which
would see him team up with the Autobots for tracks such as "The
Spanish Tune" and "Bomba Latina" as well as his current outing and
IDJ's single of the month "Ultrafunkula" and "Rockin' With The Best."



Stone Lions (Marine Parade/StoneLions.net)

Stone lions is the first solo project from world-respected producer
Damian Taylor, (not to be confused with German wonder-kid Daniel
Taylor). Damian was deeply involved in the last Prodigy and Freeland
albums and is currently co producing the new Freeland album with Adam.

His debut as Stone Lions 'Snow over Arizona', is a deep rolling
musical masterpiece and very true to the original Marine Parade sound,
remember 9 Nickel? The dub mix is a heavy sound-system onslaught
designed with Adam's Fabric sets in mind.



Along with dj's:

Aaron Jae (Evil Breaks/XM Radio/AaronJae.com)
Athena (Evil Breaks)
Emerge (Disfunktion Crew/Breaks FM)

Interesting Article referenced on Slashdot today:

"MacWorld summarizes an article published in the U.K., stating that 
Apple's iPods are made in China by women who work 15 hours/day, make 
$50/month, and have to pay half of that right back to the company for 
housing and food. The article also claims the workers live in 
dormitories where they are housed 100 per room, and are not allowed 
visitors."

Subject: [sfraves] Tickets for Stilldream

yesterday in SF and they still have some of the early bird $20.00 tickets 
availible.

* ATTENTION: groovetickets.com sales will be stoping tommorrow night @ 11pm 
so we can get the will call situated and ready for the event on Friday.  So 
get them soon!

LOL, house is like techno, but made for people who are older and "gayer".

LOL, ghetto tech is like techno for people with big ass fetishes and fast 
metabolisms.

Not true at all, I just was out 11 months ago.

That was great!

On the same note:

 I have always been a huge anti speed kills oponent. If you look at all the
traffic accident statistics and use common sense, the number one (by
far) cause of crashes is not paying attention.

 and going too fast for a specific situation is not paying attention.

sorry for the rant, but the NTSB is a piece of shit waste of our taxes.

On the same note:

 I have always been a huge anti speed kills oponent. If you look at all the
traffic accident statistics and use common sense, the number one (by
far) cause of crashes is not paying attention.

 and going too fast for a specific situation is not paying attention.

sorry for the rant, but the NTSB is a piece of shit waste of our taxes.

"Look at every path closely and deliberately.  Try it as many times as you think necessary.  Then ask yourself and yourself alone one question.  This question is one that only a very old man asks.  My benefactor told me about it once when I was young and my blood was too vigorous for me to understand it.  Now I do understand it.  I will tell you what it is:  'Does this path have a heart?' If it does the path is good.  If it doesn't, it is of no use."
-Don Juan

"A nation of sheep will beget a government of wolves."
-Edward R. Murrow

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become visible."

For the Psytrancers out there, Mubali (Mistress of Evil) will be playing

Come out and get your Mubali fix before he takes off on another world tour.

(CNN) -- Large quantities of drugs were found inside merchandise from at =
least two Home Depot stores in Massachusetts, and authorities are =
investigating, police said Wednesday.

A contractor late last week discovered two 50-pound "bricks" of =
marijuana wrapped in plastic bags inside a bathroom vanity he had =
purchased at a Home Depot store in Tewksbury, said Chief of Detectives =
Lt. Dennis Peterson.

The estimated street value of the marijuana is around $145,000, Peterson =
said.

Similar incidents have occurred in other parts of the state.=20

A plumber purchased a vanity in western Massachusetts on Monday in which =
he later found 3 kilograms of cocaine and around 40 pounds of marijuana, =
with a total estimated street value of $250,000, according to the =
Southwick Police Department.=20

Southwick Police Lt. David A. Ricardi said the item was purchased at "a =
local hardware store" but would not confirm it came from The Home Depot.

According to Peterson, a third individual discovered large quantities of =
illegal drugs inside Home Depot merchandise.=20

Peterson would not provide the details of that incident but said it was =
part of the overall investigation and that Tewksbury police were working =
with their Southwick counterparts and the federal Drug Enforcement =
Administration (DEA).

Tewksbury police and DEA officials conducted a search Tuesday of about =
12 Home Depot stores statewide and found other bathroom vanities that =
contained drugs, Peterson said. He would not elaborate on how many drug =
caches were discovered in the search.

In each incident being investigated by Tewksbury Police, all of the =
merchandise boxes originated from a Texas location and were distributed =
through one Massachusetts warehouse, Peterson said.

"I'm sure the packages were being shipped to the distribution center and =
someone was supposed to intercept them," Peterson said. "So that person =
[who was supposed to intercept the packages] either wasn't on duty that =
day or the packages were marked wrong."

The Southwick and Tewksbury Police Departments both said The Home Depot =
was cooperating fully with their investigations, and no one employed by =
the company is a suspect at this time.=20

Both departments also said none of the customers who purchased the =
vanities that contained drugs are suspects.

In a written statement, The Home Depot said, "The company is cooperating =
with authorities as they investigate this matter, and we will support =
law enforcement in any way possible to help bring those responsible to =
justice."=20

Well, after living in Montana for a year, and Alaska for a summer, "no;" I probably would not be surprised.

  Peace

Well - let's put it like this. I was busted in VA (right next to DC) for TWO 
misdemeanor counts of "possession" of marijuana for two EMPTY bowls...

You can LITERALLY be jailed for having A seed...that's right - ONE.

So, I'm not surprised at all that there aren't more growers in the DC/Metro 
area...lol.

I think it's (delightfully) ironic because Home Depot makes such a big deal  
about having a strict drug policy. 
 
There are signs you can see before you even go in saying that everybody is  
drug tested, to the effect of "you can shop here comfortable in the knowledge  
that no drug users will be interacting with you." 
 
OK, I don't want anybody to be really high while driving a forklift in my  
direction. Definitely don't want people in that job getting high AT work.  
Before? Maybe, depends how many hours. At home at night, and on weekends?  Totally 
their own business. 
 
If they have a forklift accident and then the company wants to test them, I  
guess that's ok. But even still, I'd want proof that drugs contributed toward  
the accident, not that they smoked a blunt three weeks ago. 
 
I've had some management training, and the company (a very large one) said  
they don't do drug testing largely because they feel alcohol abuse is at least  
as much of a problem (I'll drink to that, lol), and nobody has the nerve to  
start testing every employee for alcohol use. 
 
They therefore go by job PERFORMANCE -- if you're doing your job well (and  
safely), what's the problem? Go after the people who are fucking up, FOR 
fucking  up, not for arbitrary reasons that will make conservative customers happy. 
 
I am happy  conducting a personal boycott of Home Depot and any other  
companies that feel they have to trumpet their anti-drug policies as a way of  
gaining business. They have to know that their support of these policies costs  
them business as well. 
 
(Sadly, Home Depot has bought Yardbirds, one of their competitors.  
Alternative: patronize the local lumber company and hardware store.)

Also ironic how many growers shop there. heheheh

about having a strict drug policy. 

There are signs you can see before you even go in saying that everybody is 
drug tested, to the effect of "you can shop here comfortable in the knowledge 
that no drug users will be interacting with you." 

OK, I don't want anybody to be really high while driving a forklift in my 
direction. Definitely don't want people in that job getting high AT work. 
Before? Maybe, depends how many hours. At home at night, and on weekends? Totally 
their own business. 

If they have a forklift accident and then the company wants to test them, I 
guess that's ok. But even still, I'd want proof that drugs contributed toward 
the accident, not that they smoked a blunt three weeks ago. 

I've had some management training, and the company (a very large one) said 
they don't do drug testing largely because they feel alcohol abuse is at least 
as much of a problem (I'll drink to that, lol), and nobody has the nerve to 
start testing every employee for alcohol use. 

They therefore go by job PERFORMANCE -- if you're doing your job well (and 
safely), what's the problem? Go after the people who are fucking up, FOR 
fucking up, not for arbitrary reasons that will make conservative customers happy. 

I am happy conducting a personal boycott of Home Depot and any other 
companies that feel they have to trumpet their anti-drug policies as a way of 
gaining business. They have to know that their support of these policies costs 
them business as well. 

(Sadly, Home Depot has bought Yardbirds, one of their competitors. 
Alternative: patronize the local lumber company and hardware store.)

Heh, if only. The rest of this country is not like here at all. If you 
get caught with any amount of drugs in any of the red states the cops 
grow a giant boner for you and generally beat the shit out of you and / 
or arrest you. Both have happened to me in Southern states.

Honestly, I'll take a beating over going to jail any day. What really 
sucks is when you get the shit beaten out of you and then still have to 
go to jail. Shit's fucked up out there, kids.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Home Depot drug smuggling OOPS!

Nope - I didn't.

Hey - they raided my house - not much I coulda done about that. That's just 
how it works back in VA and places like that....

Cops can even go INTO a bar you're drinking at, escort you outside, make you 
blow a breathalizer, and if you're over limit - BAM! "Drunk in public" 
ticket.

You think I'm kidding? Go spend some time in that neck of the 
woods...although, they don't take kindly to you same-sex humper types ;)

Anyone know how I can get a hold of the people that leased that space?  I 
have a friend who wants to throw a video game contest in a warehouse space 
that is more upscale and that place was perfect.

Thanks,

So some of you out there are probably thinking, "Yeah, yeah, Kontrol again.
Fun party usually, but I don't even know who the hell these guys are! Why
should I spend my Saturday night and my hard-earned scrill going out to hea=
r
some music I don't even know if I'm going to like?

Well, good question. But here's your answer. Down towards the bottom of thi=
s
posting is some free music to download. Including a LIVE PA by each of this
month's featured artists. Download that shit. Seriously. Burn it to a CD if
you've gotta, and play it on the nicest soundsystem you can get your hands
on. Turn it up. Turn it WAY up. Hell, smoke 'em if you got 'em.

You hear that shit? Yeeeeaaaaah. Now that's what I'm talkin' about. Now
listen to the other one. Mmmmmm hmmmm. Fuggin' tight. Now imagine these two
guys working together, laying down thick, bumpy beats, precision bass
grooves, and layering loops and effects over each other. Getting the idea?

Bottom line: Saturday is going to be sick. Dark and dirty, intense and
funky. I'm honestly super duper stoked for this show, this will likely be
one of our best nights of music yet. If you're bored of hearing the same ol=
d
thing week after week, do yourself a favor and come check out some
state-of-the-art LIVE techno from the city that stated it all. You'll thank
me later.

BIOS:

RYAN CROSSON
Born and raised in Metro-Detroit, Ryan discovered electronic music in his
late teenage years. After strictly DJing for a few years, he took the next
logical step by beginning to produce his own music in Fall 2003.  Drawing
from artists like Plastikman, Matthew Dear, Stewart Walker, and a heavy dos=
e
of Magda DJ sets, Ryan focused his attention on percussive programming,
dubby basslines, and dark atmospheres.  By expressing a tireless work ethic
in the studio, Ryan was soon noticed for his efforts by local Detroit label=
,
Beretta Music.  Not long after this, Ryan signed music to Cologne based
label Trapez Limited, just one year after he began writing music.  The EP
release on Trapez LTD. titled, "Say So " was well received with many
positive reviews from a plethora of international artists. In the Summer of
2005, Ryan played his first international dates with impressive live
performances in Berlin, and Cologne.  He has recently taken on a production
alais, "Berg Nixon" under which he was honored with a track on the latest
M-nus compilation, "min2MAX", as well as scoring a pair of remixes for the
latest Troy Pierce 12", "25 Bitches". Current influences include Pierce,
Ricardo Villalobos, Matthew Dear, and Guido Schneider. Talented and driven,
this young Detroit native is making an impact internationally with his
music.   Look for upcoming releases and remixes in the coming months from
Ryan on Minus, Beretta Grey, Telegraph and Trapez Ltd.

LEE CURTISS
Lee has always found sanctuary in the corners of his mind, for in the
corners you will find your true nature and true creative being. His mission
is to free people from the confines of the music they are accustomed to
listening to and elevate electronic music to the next level. He found
himself fixated on music from an early age, constantly learning more about
music as he taught himself to play several instruments over time. When he
found the dance music scene, he immediately moved away from rock oriented
instruments and gravitated toward electronic music. He was completely
fascinated by the anonymity of artists, the raw power of the music and how
it made the crowd move with every churning rhythm until it seemed everyone
was ready to lose their minds all at once. After traveling to Detroit and
Chicago he realized that he had something to contribute to this music and
began collecting records and DJing in 2000. Two years later he had amassed
enough knowledge and equipment to commit to producing full force. He soon
relocated from Grand Rapids to Detroit where he broadened his musical scope
and continued sharpening his skills. His music has become a heavily German
influenced form of minimal with an unorthodox approach to textures and
rhythms, using lo fidelity to create elements of disarray surrounded by
crunching beats, tweaky synthlines, held together by bubble gum sticky bass
lines. With a recent 3 month tour of Europe behind him, a track on the new
Audion Fabric mix, and upcoming releases on Spectral Sound, Underl_ne, and
Milnor Modern, Lee Curtiss is an artist clearly on his way up and showing n=
o
signs of slowing down.

I met Markiss and his girlfriend at a Sunset last summer.  She was properly impressed with my two youngest sons.  Markiss and crew are very nice people!  They even sent me some photos of Bennett blowing bubbles after.  

Too bad the KZSU signal doesn't make it to downtown SF, at least not on my car radio.  Dammit!

Peace,

Peter

yep...  after untold hours of machine-shop time, my team and i have
cobbled together a couple of robots for this year's ROBOGAMES!

http://www.robogames.net/

it's this weekend in SF, at fort mason...  all day friday, saturday and
sunday.  there's all sorts of robotics stuff going on, from combat robots
weighing up to 340lbs each to fully autonomous bipedal kung-fu robots!

here's a listing of the different classes and entries:
http://buildersdb.com/view_bots.asp?eventid=132

my team has two robots entered...  one in the beetleweight combat class
(3lbs), BOT-0.57721 and one in the featherweight class (30lbs), BOT-6:00.

it's a ton of fun, and a really cool place to see all sorts of technology
in action.  if you go, give me a holler on my cell phone and i can come
out and meet you:  408.718.3707

alota goths & stuff.. so yeah.. it hit me it was Wed night & BAGG..
YAAAY!!! :)  Anywaze... like I saw Stephie & ummmm... Evan i think his
name is.. they drag me in,.... I see Omar & kick it w/ him .. i heard that
my big Bro Chazz was there, but i missed him by an hour...

yeah... BAGG kinda got more Poly than i remember from when i went there
last... lol.. Hello 2day.. it was fun.. oh oh oh.. i also saw my Girl Roxy
who works for Glass cat i just found out like lastnight.. LoL

Oh yeah.. I met Shatter lastnight.. I'm pretty sure I knew him from B4 but
like 4gt or soemthing & I was sure that when i saw him.. i was just gonna
strait up hate on him.. so after yellin' out 2 the crowd outside "OK..
Who's Shatter?" & the bouncer Dude claiming it was him.. LoL.. then I
re-met Shatter & I dunno man.. LoL.. I just got soo much like well..
Groovy energy, I couldn't hate.. but i sstill called him an Asshole & he
said "Damn right I'm an Asshole"!  Hello 2day

OK... so there are a few bouncers there from other club that I used  2
kick it w/ them @... LoL.. so yeah.. it was kinda funny 'cause like 2 of
them i've known for over like 8-9 years now :)  LoL.. It was fun hangin['
out w/ him again :)  I mean.. this dude was my Big Bro over @ 1015 like
for a loong time & liek alwyas took care of me (next to Rudy :)  The other
bouncer dude I've known for a # of years also & it was just weird seein'
him again & Dope @ the same time :)

So the music @ was Groovy... all new wave, no wave, & IDM stuff.. it was
fun!!! :)  There was even a booty club house track that dropped that i
caught & started laughing when i heard it 'cause it was BAGG... i never
heard booty club house the ummm.. 3-4 times i been there..

Yeah.. i kinda got sucked in2 hangin' out w/ a Poly Family there & got
bit.. whatever than means, i dunno.. but it was fun & they were really
CooL people!

Then after that, i went 2 Omar's pad in downtown & lkike chillled there
when bart opened.. then when i got 2 El Cerrito Del Norte, there were 8
cop cars like outside!  wooop woop :)

I'm still kinda high from  kickin' it w/ Warner Drive.. I Love those

Subject: [sfraves] NRR: My Wed Night Adventure.. Hello 2day


So like Tuesday i was like well.. i got this invite on myspace from this
dude & he was all sayin' that his band ummmm..... http://warnerdrive.com
was playing @ 330 Ritch... I mean... I admit, i have a habit of adding
tall people to my list on myspace 'cause tall people are Groovy!!!  So i
added this dude, Johny when i saw him on the new people thingie on
myspace.. LoL... http://www.myspace.com/jonnyfl

Anywaze.. so yeah.. he told me that his band was performing & I dunno... i
mean.. his band does have a mypace profile also & I weas thinkin', "Oh
Great, another myspafce band"... but then i thought about it again &
thought like if he was willing to like personally invite people to his
show on myspace as compared to all the other bands who just send out those
myspace invites & say come to my show it's gonna be really Groovy la la
la... i kinda got curious & emailed him back.. we ended up having this
like hour long myspcae note chat 'then he gave me his ### 'cause they were
driving up from LA & I called him.. so yeah.. i kinda scored a GL on the
Warner Drive list.. LOLOLMAO... hello 2day... I mean.. i've also been on
this Indy Rock high since doin' that stage thingie for Masonic/
Groundscore stage @ HSF on Sunday... so yeah.. this was perfect for
getting that fill :)

OK.. but when i got there.. . i found out that it was an Indy Rock kinda
showcase dealie... 1st up this ummm.. well.. OK... Jewel-esque sing
Carolina perofmred this guitar accoustic set... then this like Pop rock
band played next.. ummmm... Philede no no no wait... ummm... Springfield,
then this Metal Rock band played, totally for their name, then this Brit
Rock band played, forgot their name.. then Warner Drive played..
finally!!!!

Like up until that point... we spent those like few hours like talkin' &
stuff, like I got 2 klnow them pretty good, & I was like uuugggh, they
perform last & I decided that well... I might as well miss BART gon' home
'cause I just wanna make sure that Warner Drive ain't some Emo Punk
Wannabe Poser Rock Band!  I mean.. lol... yeah.. it was fun like chillin';
w/ the "headliners" 'cause Pete, the bass player/... hella funny Dude!!!
:)

OK... so ummmm.. lemme see... Like Waren Drive.. they're just fucki'n
strait up good old Yummy Rock Music... probably a lil' Thrashy Punky Metal
sound on the edges.. but yeah... I wouldn't know what type of sub genre
io'd class them as other than just Hard Rock Music!!!

ummm.. so like the band member... since Sunday, I've like faslen in LOVE
w/ Bass Players 'cause I mean.. they all fuckin' ROCK!!!  So yeah. ..Peet,
the bass player, he's your like crazy, bad mouth, loud ass, way lous he
dowsn't need his mic to sing, probably drunk on stage, animated, band
member... the lead singer Johny who is just so fuckin' Dope is a cross
between Freddy Murcury, Steven Tyler, & Richard Simons on Stage w/ the way
he like seductively moves around on stage... the ummm.. I guess lead
guitar player, but he's the only one playing guitar, so i dunno.. but
yeah... guitar player Chris.. he's the like comic relief through actions
of the band well.. that's what it seem like to me anyway.. i mean.. I also
thought he look like a gansta Ewok w/ how far his bandana went down to he
head & he has like these mondo bug eyes :)  But it's like Mondo Cute! :)
Lastly, the drummer Matt, he's like the agro, bite your head off if you
talk to him, pissed off to the world kinda person I thought 'cause he was
like in a raunchy mood waiting too long to play... but when he got
behindhis drums & they played.. oh yeah.. he was a mad man on his drums!!!
LoL.. then he was like in a better like after, approachable mood after
that & apoligized for being an Asshole to me earlier :P

Collectively, Warner Drive gives a good fuckin' Stage show.. in between a
few songs they did these funnny ass skits about like why the next song was
written or what dunken inpriation made those lyrics!  Ummm.. they didn't
have like a whole lota time on stage for this showcase, I do have 2
FAvorite songs & like they performed like somewhere betweem 7-8 songs...
lol.. like ok.. remember those like 80's videos rock band video cliches
where like the guitar players are side by side & do that rowing motion w/
their bodies?  Well I finally saw that Live!  LOL... Hello 2day.. I mean..
it was Cheesy as Fuck like seeing that being done like LIVE, but I Loved
it!!!  LoL.. it actually  look pretty Groovy!!! :) Hello 2Day!  Ummmm...
yeah...

Totally mondo audience interaction.. there was a few times when Peet or
Johny would come in the audience & like sing/ play bass to people in the
crowd :)

So after their show ended & the Rock Showcase was over itself.. I kinda
helped Johny & them pack up their shit in their Uhaul pullie thingie & we
kicked it for like an hour longer :)  It was fun! LoL... I gotta say.. I
Love Warner Drive now!!  I do!!! :)  Hello 2Day... it was worth missing
the last BART trasin to get home & camp out in the City for some 5 hours!
But I really Do Love these guys mondo lots & Wow.. I'm like this huge
mondo fan right now! LOLOLMAO :)

So we said out bye, gave them hugs, like Johny was scared that something
wqs gonna happen to me & wanted to be sure they like drove me somewhere
"safer", but it was all good 'cause i seriously on ly had like 2 hours 2
kill b4 BART opened... so I walked & walk & somehow ended up @ Bondage a
Go-Go.. Hello 2day.. 'cause when ok, wait.. I makin' this way 2 mondo
long.. i gotta make another post :)



Pictures posted soon :) oh yeah...   http://www.myspace.com/warnerdrive

Subject: [sfraves] NRR: My Wed Night Adventure.. Hello 2day


So like Tuesday i was like well.. i got this invite on myspace from this
dude & he was all sayin' that his band ummmm..... http://warnerdrive.com
was playing @ 330 Ritch... I mean... I admit, i have a habit of adding
tall people to my list on myspace 'cause tall people are Groovy!!!  So i
added this dude, Johny when i saw him on the new people thingie on
myspace.. LoL... http://www.myspace.com/jonnyfl

Anywaze.. so yeah.. he told me that his band was performing & I dunno... i
mean.. his band does have a mypace profile also & I weas thinkin', "Oh
Great, another myspafce band"... but then i thought about it again &
thought like if he was willing to like personally invite people to his
show on myspace as compared to all the other bands who just send out those
myspace invites & say come to my show it's gonna be really Groovy la la
la... i kinda got curious & emailed him back.. we ended up having this
like hour long myspcae note chat 'then he gave me his ### 'cause they were
driving up from LA & I called him.. so yeah.. i kinda scored a GL on the
Warner Drive list.. LOLOLMAO... hello 2day... I mean.. i've also been on
this Indy Rock high since doin' that stage thingie for Masonic/
Groundscore stage @ HSF on Sunday... so yeah.. this was perfect for
getting that fill :)

OK.. but when i got there.. . i found out that it was an Indy Rock kinda
showcase dealie... 1st up this ummm.. well.. OK... Jewel-esque sing
Carolina perofmred this guitar accoustic set... then this like Pop rock
band played next.. ummmm... Philede no no no wait... ummm... Springfield,
then this Metal Rock band played, totally for their name, then this Brit
Rock band played, forgot their name.. then Warner Drive played..
finally!!!!

Like up until that point... we spent those like few hours like talkin' &
stuff, like I got 2 klnow them pretty good, & I was like uuugggh, they
perform last & I decided that well... I might as well miss BART gon' home
'cause I just wanna make sure that Warner Drive ain't some Emo Punk
Wannabe Poser Rock Band!  I mean.. lol... yeah.. it was fun like chillin';
w/ the "headliners" 'cause Pete, the bass player/... hella funny Dude!!!
:)

OK... so ummmm.. lemme see... Like Waren Drive.. they're just fucki'n
strait up good old Yummy Rock Music... probably a lil' Thrashy Punky Metal
sound on the edges.. but yeah... I wouldn't know what type of sub genre
io'd class them as other than just Hard Rock Music!!!

ummm.. so like the band member... since Sunday, I've like faslen in LOVE
w/ Bass Players 'cause I mean.. they all fuckin' ROCK!!!  So yeah. ..Peet,
the bass player, he's your like crazy, bad mouth, loud ass, way lous he
dowsn't need his mic to sing, probably drunk on stage, animated, band
member... the lead singer Johny who is just so fuckin' Dope is a cross
between Freddy Murcury, Steven Tyler, & Richard Simons on Stage w/ the way
he like seductively moves around on stage... the ummm.. I guess lead
guitar player, but he's the only one playing guitar, so i dunno.. but
yeah... guitar player Chris.. he's the like comic relief through actions
of the band well.. that's what it seem like to me anyway.. i mean.. I also
thought he look like a gansta Ewok w/ how far his bandana went down to he
head & he has like these mondo bug eyes :)  But it's like Mondo Cute! :)
Lastly, the drummer Matt, he's like the agro, bite your head off if you
talk to him, pissed off to the world kinda person I thought 'cause he was
like in a raunchy mood waiting too long to play... but when he got
behindhis drums & they played.. oh yeah.. he was a mad man on his drums!!!
LoL.. then he was like in a better like after, approachable mood after
that & apoligized for being an Asshole to me earlier :P

Collectively, Warner Drive gives a good fuckin' Stage show.. in between a
few songs they did these funnny ass skits about like why the next song was
written or what dunken inpriation made those lyrics!  Ummm.. they didn't
have like a whole lota time on stage for this showcase, I do have 2
FAvorite songs & like they performed like somewhere betweem 7-8 songs...
lol.. like ok.. remember those like 80's videos rock band video cliches
where like the guitar players are side by side & do that rowing motion w/
their bodies?  Well I finally saw that Live!  LOL... Hello 2day.. I mean..
it was Cheesy as Fuck like seeing that being done like LIVE, but I Loved
it!!!  LoL.. it actually  look pretty Groovy!!! :) Hello 2Day!  Ummmm...
yeah...

Totally mondo audience interaction.. there was a few times when Peet or
Johny would come in the audience & like sing/ play bass to people in the
crowd :)

So after their show ended & the Rock Showcase was over itself.. I kinda
helped Johny & them pack up their shit in their Uhaul pullie thingie & we
kicked it for like an hour longer :)  It was fun! LoL... I gotta say.. I
Love Warner Drive now!!  I do!!! :)  Hello 2Day... it was worth missing
the last BART trasin to get home & camp out in the City for some 5 hours!
But I really Do Love these guys mondo lots & Wow.. I'm like this huge
mondo fan right now! LOLOLMAO :)

So we said out bye, gave them hugs, like Johny was scared that something
wqs gonna happen to me & wanted to be sure they like drove me somewhere
"safer", but it was all good 'cause i seriously on ly had like 2 hours 2
kill b4 BART opened... so I walked & walk & somehow ended up @ Bondage a
Go-Go.. Hello 2day.. 'cause when ok, wait.. I makin' this way 2 mondo
long.. i gotta make another post :)



Pictures posted soon :) oh yeah...   http://www.myspace.com/warnerdrive

I'm a Buddhist so I can't agree to this bit, "A Temple member in good standing is anyone who has faith in the one true God of the Bible"  And I don't really dig the whole deal with using a religious organization for non-religious goals (see also Rhythym Society)  Personally I'm not really sure I believe this is a real religion at all.  I expect judges might see it that way as well.  We'll see if it stands up in court.  I also note that this won't help the thousands already in jail for minor marijuana offenses.

Peter

well then, what constitutes a "real religion" to you?

I think the Church of LDS is bunch of hooey, but if they wanna have a  
church, that's their business as far as I'm concerned.

that's a slippery slope you play on when you start saying what a  
"real" religion is or isn't.

that's a slippery slope you play on when you start saying what a 
"real" religion is or isn't.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] 420 church

I'm not trying to say what is and isn't a religion, but I don't like the id=
ea of pretending to be religious to achieve some other goal whether that's =
legal, political, of financial.  Personally I don't think any of the member=
s of this church were praying to a weed smoking version of Jesus before the=
 supreme court decision.  Maybe I'm wrong and I could be convinced otherwis=
e.  =20

In the absence of such evidence it just seems to me that this is a phoney r=
eligion constructed to issue "get out of jail free" cards.  I don't really =
have a problem with people doing what they have to in order to avoid jail f=
or marijuana offenses, but personally I'd rather see full legalization and =
amnesty for those already incarcerated.  I'm not sure that this sort of thi=
ng doesn't make that more unlikely actually.

Anyway, the Rastafarians come to mind as a previously existant religious gr=

Subject: Re: [sfraves] 420 church


I'm not trying to say what is and isn't a religion, but I don't like the 
idea of pretending to be religious to achieve some other goal whether that's 
legal, political, of financial.  Personally I don't think any of the members 
of this church were praying to a weed smoking version of Jesus before the 
supreme court decision.  Maybe I'm wrong and I could be convinced otherwise.

In the absence of such evidence it just seems to me that this is a phoney 
religion constructed to issue "get out of jail free" cards.  I don't really 
have a problem with people doing what they have to in order to avoid jail 
for marijuana offenses, but personally I'd rather see full legalization and 
amnesty for those already incarcerated.  I'm not sure that this sort of 
thing doesn't make that more unlikely actually.

Anyway, the Rastafarians come to mind as a previously existant religious 
group that actually does use marijuana as a sacrament.  They should be 
protected under the supreme court decision for sure.

"Ganja (Marijuana) is considered the 'wisdom weed' by Rastafarians, 
as its use helps one to gain wisdom. Rastafarians use it as a 
part of a religious rite and as a means of getting closer to their 
inner spiritual self, Jah (God) and Creation.               Ganja 
is also seen by Rastafarians as the herb of life mentioned in 
the Bible. Rastafarians use of ganja is justified by the following 
Psalms 104:14 that says, 'He causeth the grass to grow for 
the cattle and herb for the service of man, that he may bring 
forth food out of the earth.'  Rastafarians also say it was 
found growing at the grave of King Solomon in the Bible.


               Rastafarian consume it through smoking and eating (not 
recomended).                  The smoking of Ganja is a part of a religious 
ritual. When there                  is a large "reasoning" gathering of 
Rastafarians, a                  Chalice, which is a large smoking pipe, may 
be passed around and                  smoked. This is similar to the passing 
around of a communion cup                  by some Christian denominations. 
These gatherings are also called                  Nyahbinghi (also the name 
of a Rastafarian sect: Theocratic                  Priesthood and Livity 
Order of Nyahbinghi)."

Peace (and Ganja),

P.S. Wikipedia actually has a pretty good page on the Rastafari movement (i=
ncluding correcting me about calling it "rastafarianism" which I won't do a=
gain phew!)  but no word about how the recent supreme court decision would =
impact the previous statements by the government against the legal religiou=

I'mwondering if anyone is exploring this angle now?

I'm not trying to say what is and isn't a religion, but I don't like the id=
ea of pretending to be religious to achieve some other goal whether that's =
legal, political, of financial.  Personally I don't think any of the member=
s of this church were praying to a weed smoking version of Jesus before the=
 supreme court decision.  Maybe I'm wrong and I could be convinced otherwis=
e.  =20

In the absence of such evidence it just seems to me that this is a phoney r=
eligion constructed to issue "get out of jail free" cards.  I don't really =
have a problem with people doing what they have to in order to avoid jail f=
or marijuana offenses, but personally I'd rather see full legalization and =
amnesty for those already incarcerated.  I'm not sure that this sort of thi=
ng doesn't make that more unlikely actually.

Anyway, the Rastafarians come to mind as a previously existant religious gr=
oup that actually does use marijuana as a sacrament.  They should be protec=
ted under the supreme court decision for sure.

"Ganja (Marijuana) is considered the 'wisdom weed' by Rastafarians,        =
          as its use helps one to gain wisdom. Rastafarians use it as a    =
              part of a religious rite and as a means of getting closer to =
their                  inner spiritual self, Jah (God) and Creation.       =
        Ganja                  is also seen by Rastafarians as the herb of =
life mentioned in                  the Bible. Rastafarians use of ganja is =
justified by the following                  Psalms 104:14 that says, 'He ca=
useth the grass to grow for                  the cattle and herb for the se=
rvice of man, that he may bring                  forth food out of the eart=
h.'  Rastafarians also say it was                  found growing at the gra=
ve of King Solomon in the Bible.


               Rastafarian consume it through smoking and eating (not recom=
ended).                  The smoking of Ganja is a part of a religious ritu=
al. When there                  is a large "reasoning" gathering of Rastafa=
rians, a                  Chalice, which is a large smoking pipe, may be pa=
ssed around and                  smoked. This is similar to the passing aro=
und of a communion cup                  by some Christian denominations. Th=
ese gatherings are also called                  Nyahbinghi (also the name o=
f a Rastafarian sect: Theocratic                  Priesthood and Livity Ord=
er of Nyahbinghi)."

I ws just quoting - personally I don't base my spiritual beliefs on bunch of 
stories that have been watered down by different people over a couple 
thousand years and trust them as fact.

While yer bullshittin' - I don't believe in a divine being other than "the 
self" either. Sort of like the Cathar sect of ancient Christianity - I 
woulda been burned as a heretic back in the day...lol.

determining sex by hair color.

Because you know, it hadn't been modified or translated at all
through the years to suit the needs of any powerful institutions...

Keep an eye on my wives for me while I'm down enjoying some temple

BIOS:

RYAN CROSSON
Born and raised in Metro-Detroit, Ryan discovered electronic music in his
late teenage years. After strictly DJing for a few years, he took the next
logical step by beginning to produce his own music in Fall 2003.  Drawing
from artists like Plastikman, Matthew Dear, Stewart Walker, and a heavy dos=
e
of Magda DJ sets, Ryan focused his attention on percussive programming,
dubby basslines, and dark atmospheres.  By expressing a tireless work ethic
in the studio, Ryan was soon noticed for his efforts by local Detroit label=
,
Beretta Music.  Not long after this, Ryan signed music to Cologne based
label Trapez Limited, just one year after he began writing music.  The EP
release on Trapez LTD. titled, "Say So " was well received with many
positive reviews from a plethora of international artists. In the Summer of
2005, Ryan played his first international dates with impressive live
performances in Berlin, and Cologne.  He has recently taken on a production
alais, "Berg Nixon" under which he was honored with a track on the latest
M-nus compilation, "min2MAX", as well as scoring a pair of remixes for the
latest Troy Pierce 12", "25 Bitches". Current influences include Pierce,
Ricardo Villalobos, Matthew Dear, and Guido Schneider. Talented and driven,
this young Detroit native is making an impact internationally with his
music.   Look for upcoming releases and remixes in the coming months from
Ryan on Minus, Beretta Grey, Telegraph and Trapez Ltd.

LEE CURTISS
Lee has always found sanctuary in the corners of his mind, for in the
corners you will find your true nature and true creative being. His mission
is to free people from the confines of the music they are accustomed to
listening to and elevate electronic music to the next level. He found
himself fixated on music from an early age, constantly learning more about
music as he taught himself to play several instruments over time. When he
found the dance music scene, he immediately moved away from rock oriented
instruments and gravitated toward electronic music. He was completely
fascinated by the anonymity of artists, the raw power of the music and how
it made the crowd move with every churning rhythm until it seemed everyone
was ready to lose their minds all at once. After traveling to Detroit and
Chicago he realized that he had something to contribute to this music and
began collecting records and DJing in 2000. Two years later he had amassed
enough knowledge and equipment to commit to producing full force. He soon
relocated from Grand Rapids to Detroit where he broadened his musical scope
and continued sharpening his skills. His music has become a heavily German
influenced form of minimal with an unorthodox approach to textures and
rhythms, using lo fidelity to create elements of disarray surrounded by
crunching beats, tweaky synthlines, held together by bubble gum sticky bass
lines. With a recent 3 month tour of Europe behind him, a track on the new
Audion Fabric mix, and upcoming releases on Spectral Sound, Underl_ne, and
Milnor Modern, Lee Curtiss is an artist clearly on his way up and showing n=
o
signs of slowing down.

Man Charged With Having Crack in Sundae
Friday, June 16, 2006

(06-16) 14:12 PDT Richmond, Texas (AP) --

This banana split was topped with something more potent than just a cherry.

A motorist was arrested and charged with possession of a controlled
substance after he was caught with two rocks of crack cocaine he had
stashed in his ice cream dessert.

Oscar Martinez, 41, of Richmond, had been pulled over by police
officer David Bentley late Sunday after he failed to stop at a
pedestrian crossing on the campus of Wharton County Junior College.

Bentley discovered that Martinez had a suspended driver's license and
an outstanding traffic warrant.

Richmond police spokesman Sgt. Lowell Neinast said Martinez told
Bentley that he wished he could finish the banana split he had in his
car.

When Bentley saw the melting banana split on the front floorboard of
Martinez's car, he noticed that it was topped with a square-shaped
object that turned out to be crack cocaine.

"One of the crack rocks was sitting right on top of the bananas,"
Neinast told the Fort Bend Herald-Coaster. "Once he found the first
crack rock, he figured there were more inside. He emptied it out and
there it was."

Martinez was arrested and charged with driving with a suspended
license, a traffic warrant and possession of a controlled substance in
a drug-free zone, a third-degree felony. He was released from the Fort
Bend County Jail after posting an $8,500 bond, Neinast said Friday.

"I've been doing this for 20 years and I could give you all kinds of
stories, but this is really one of a kind," Neinast said. "But true."

Recent book from McGill-Queens University Press:


Fight, Flight, or Chill: Subcultures, Youth, and Rave into the Twenty-First Century
Brian Wilson
http://www.mqup.mcgill.ca/book.php?bookid=1957

Rave is one of the first distinct and significant youth subcultures to emerge since the early days of punk rockers and skinheads. A middle-class culture renowned for drug use, computer-generated "techno" music, and all-night dance parties, rave has been described as everything from a drug cult to a neo-hippie community. Brian Wilson uses his ethnographic research on rave during the mid and late 1990s in Southern Ontario to discuss the ways in which young people participate in social and cultural life at the turn of the millennium.
Fight, Flight or Chill explores the extent to which raver youths' experiences are constrained or determined by individualistic, high-tech, mass-mediated Western culture in which alienated and unfulfilled youth are apparently more at-risk for escapist and thrill-seeking behaviours. Wilson considers how raver youth creatively and proactively subvert these constraints in novel and empowering ways - from political activism to symbolic and stylistic expressions of resistance to community-building efforts. He also discusses the globalization and political economy of rave and youth culture and examines the ideologies that underlie simple solutions to the complex concerns over young people today.

"Look at every path closely and deliberately.  Try it as many times as you think necessary.  Then ask yourself and yourself alone one question.  This question is one that only a very old man asks.  My benefactor told me about it once when I was young and my blood was too vigorous for me to understand it.  Now I do understand it.  I will tell you what it is:  'Does this path have a heart?' If it does the path is good.  If it doesn't, it is of no use."
-Don Juan

-Edward R. Murrow

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become visible."

Alright everybody the moment we have all been waiting for: The most 
anticipated event of the summer is back! <<<STILLDREAM>>> 6 Year 
Anniversary Campout June 16, 17 & 18th, 2006 <<< Synchro >>> - 
Netherlands (Tip World, Avatar, Novatekk, Atomik, Transient) Synchro or 
Jeroen, as he is formerly known, is one such man who over the years has 
continually produced a rare blend of trance, leaving a lasting 
impression on both his listeners and viewers.In 1997 he was signed to 
the trance label TIP Records, where he released a swag of stomping 
tracks, such as Kitchen Sync, Power On, See Ya Later Oscillator and 
Human Oscillator. Since Synchro released his first album Science 
Friction on TIP, his booking have subsequently picked up 400%.Synchro 
has seriously explained how making music means so much to him. And the 
rush that it gives him to play live and DJ. He quotes Tony De Vit 
saying: Its a real high when you play a track and the whole house 
goes bananas and you can multiple that by a hundred if its a track you 
made yourself. <<< Terry Mullan >>>- Chicago, IL (Catlyst Records, 
Kontrast, EAM) Music has always been the driving force in Terry's life, 
from Jazz band to DJ'ing it was only a matter of time before Terry made 
his career in music. Dj'ing has taken Terry all over the world, where 
he's been exposed to many different styles of dance music. Feeling 
miffed by the overwhelming popularity and sheer amount of vacuous music 
in the dance scene, eventually led Terry to take a stand for his sound. 
Starting a label that specialized in the sounds of Chicago and funky 
music was the only plan. As a DJ Terry knew that there was no way the 
sound would be denied when presented properly. With his faith in the 
music, Terry planned to turn people on to these sounds. Facilitating 
this vision was easier with friends like Richie Hawtin and John 
Acquaviva who ran Plus 8 Records. <<< Patrick DSP >>> - Toronto, Canada 
(www.patrickdsp.com, Hardsignal, Hydraulix, Cluster) Patrick 
Gharapetians dreams of becoming a superhero were thwarted the day he 
was caught shoplifting by his parents. Not to let this deter him from 
his dreams, he decided to pursue another avenue to help save the world 
- not from the usual suspects and evil villains, but from mainstream, 
over-played generic cookie-cutter music. He foresaw boy-bands and 
teeny-bobber girls taking over the world and he knew he could not stand 
idly by and let that happen. Since then he has dedicated his life (at 
least the musical part of it) to the other side of good - Evil. <<< 
Keith MacKenzie >>> - Florida (www.illeveneleven.com, Zone, Afterdark) 
Having earned a reputation for workin the bassbins proper w/ his 
upfront selection of breakbeat pressure, Keith MacK has solidified 
himself as a cornerstone in the US breaks movement. Being apart of DJ 
Icey's legendary Zone Records and an original member of Afterdark 
Records, as well as recently starting his own imprint..illeven:eleven, 
Keith continues to push forward w/ his cutting-edge sound, while at the 
same time providing a positive vibe towards the dance scene. His 
releases include collaborations w/ artists such as infiniti, dj fixx, 
and brian van dalen have made him not only a dancefloor favorite, but 
also popular w/ breaks dj's worldwide. <<< Dyloot >>>- San Francisco

Wednesday, August 02, 2006 * BOOM FESTIVAL Magic *

Date & Time:  Wednesday, August 2, 2006 - Wednesday, August 9, 2006 4:00 AM
Heya, All! We would like to share with you information about a very special
global arts, music and culture-gathering that incarnates biannually in
Portugal. Boom Festival takes place in a stunning outdoor location on the
shore of the Lake Idanha-a-Nova, approximately 2 hours North-West from
Lisboa. Bringing together the latest in psychedelic sights & sounds,
phantastic art installations & workshops, this week-long event is a harmonic
convergence of people, energy, information, and philosophies, from planet
Earth & beyond. Synchronized multi-dimensionally with the full moon of
August, the next Boom-Festival is taking a bio-dynamic approach by
incorporating a variety of sustainable techniques, and Earth-based forms
throughout its infrastructure. Reflecting a harmonic balance of the organic
and the cyber-technologic, Boom 2006 maps the metaphysical framework in
accordance with Peace, Love, Unity and Respect. A very magical event indeed!
5000 BOOM Festival 2006 Early Bird Tickets are available now. They are only
70 Euro for 7 days. Getting there is no big deal. Reasonable flights to
Lisboa can be purchased on most of the European Budget Airlines, and
Transatlantic flights from America are also quite cheap. The Boom has
organized busses that take you directly from the international airport to
the sacred womb of the vacation party paradise. This year, Boom-festival has
extended its length to ONE WEEK! Great news about the timing of BOOM 2006 is
that it's not happening in conjunction with Burning Man, so the devoted
"Burners" have a chance to partake on European creative community
expression. BOOM is similar to Burning Man, but with a lake & great sounds!
Not to be missed ... For more info, please visit: www.boomfestival.org

"coming back from the dead to live in magical happy-land forever with his pops"

While some people take that story literally, its also possible to view it as a deep spiritual metaphor.  Perhaps the true meaning is something more along the lines of the following:

The universe, the sum total of all existence, is one; and our seperateness from it is an illusion we create for ourselves.  In the end, at death, the illusions fall away and we return from whence we came.  We rejoin the entirety of what is, from which really we were never apart, much like a son returning to his father.

In Buddhism people talk about the "child light" rejoining the "mother light"... 

As far as Scientology, I think its really about controlling people and making money and much less about spritual health and well being.  I could be wrong. 

However, their e-meter things look like a cheap voltmeter I got from Shack ten years ago. All the "demonstrators" lined up at the tables near Union Square waiting to plug people in, seem to be just a little bit confused or something...  Besides their alien story is just damn weird. 

Are you clear yet?  

Sheesh.

Regards,

Peter

In the words of Sean K (Rantradio.com)

Either there is this galactic being named Xenu that is evil and going to 
dominate the universe and is chasing after us, aliens, who are now 
inhabiting the bodies of primative earth creatures, and only L RON and the 
scientologists can save and protect us from him...

Or...  the scientologists are a UFO CULT

and if the scientologists are right, then I'm backing Xenu because he will 
give me MECHA to hunt down and destroy them!  1 million years to reach 
enlightenment, or mecha?  I'M WITH XENU!

or something to that effect

Tired of the same old duds being peddled by the usual
fashion industry suspects?  Well it's time to wake up
and smell the underground!  The Cloud Factory Design
Collective is back on the attack with its 8th Annual
Fashion Performance: "S/heva: Venture into the Fashion
Divine," to be held in San Francisco on Saturday, June
17, 2006 at Studio Z.

Watch as S/heva destroys your preconceived notions
about fashion rules and limitations, blazing new paths
to the heights of wearable art!  Behold brave new
creations by this inventive, many-armed collective,
rooted firmly in the underground, yet always reaching
out in new directions to entertain and inspire!

S/heva will ignite your imagination with a wild
variety of designs, from kicky patchwork fur and
vibrant dancefloor creations, to flowing goddess
threads.  Find the perfect outfit for your most
outrageous exploits, whether you're running from the
paparazzi, taking a twirl at your local gin joint, or
spending a day at the races.

After the show, pick up some up-to-the-minute,
one-of-a-kind goodies in the Designer Sample Sale,
then grab your dancing shoes and hold onto your booty
as DJs Monty Luke and DingDong lead S/heva dancing
into the fire! Remember, this cycle of hyper-creation
only comes around once a year, so don't miss out!

Well, by using the Internet at all, you are relying on electronic
hardware built in China under the exact conditions. 

So, if this bothers you, please disconnect your internet now.

Look, the available pool of labor in China is shrinking, and workers
enjoy more flexability, better pay, and more work options now then
they ever did before.  Chinese workers use the Internet to find out
which factories pay and treat their employees the best, forcing all
factories to improve their conditions and pay.

Thanks to American demand for devices such as iPods, China has an exploding
middle class that is pulling itself up from poverty.

Its no secret that most consumer electronics are made by poorly paid workers in other countries. That's mainly China right now.  

The by products of production of consumer electronics include highly toxic materials which are often dumped into the environment and some products contain toxic materials that end up in landfills too.  Most batteries contain toxic materials for example.

And most of these devices have an expected lifetime of less than 3 years...

Might make you think differently about it next time you by an iPod or whatever. 

Peace,

Peter

Hi, I tried to subscribe to the Sacraves mailing list and got back one of  
those Daemonic emails saying there's no such thing (including "Host unknown  
(Name server: sacraves.hyperreal.org: host not found"). On their web page, there  
were calendar entries to Dec 2005 but nothing since. 
Does anyone know if they have a new site or something?  Thanks

Anyone out there have to deal with CHP and window tinting?

I got pulled over a couple of weeks back and they pig wrote me up for having
no front license plate (cvc 5200) and a restricted view (cvc 26708a).  My
car has not had a front license plate in at least 10 years, and neither
myself or the previous owner recieved a ticket for that.  I'm willing to
deal with that one, i'll contact DMV and have them send me out new plates.

My problem is with the restriced view.  I have nothing in any of my
windows.  the only thing it could be is the window tint.  The tinting is
factory.  the rear, rear side and front side windows are tinted.  When he
pulled me over my front driver side window was completely down, so he
couldnt have seen the tint there.  When he pulled me over, i rolled down the
passenger side window to talk to him.  Maybe he saw that window on his walk
up, but in any case, he didnt test my window tint to see if it was within
the boundries (i think it's 88% according to ca dmv).

Has anyone had to deal with this?  Can i tell them the dude never tested my
window tinting and therefore has no basis to write me up on that?  If i
don't get these corrected, i owe $352.  If i do get them corrected i still
owe $157.  I'd like to be able to get this done at little to no cost to
myself.  Like i said i'm willing to get new plates and go through whatever
it takes to do that, but the window tinting i think is a little too much.
Or at least have them come out and test the windows to make sure it's within
the boundries, like i said it is a factory tint job and if you're going to
sell a car in california you shouldnt be able to sell it with windows that
are too dark.

well, he ought to be able to come up with some reason for citing you  
with the restricted view citation.  i wouldn't assume it's anything  
but do my research on tinted windows and fight the ticket.  maybe  
it's possible he won't even show up to court and you will win the case.

It was definitely a grate time!

"That right wing motherfucker" (another person's quote, not mine) was a 
no show.  So I covered most of his set, with 4matt starting early and 
taking the remaining 30 mins.

It was definitely a grate time!

Actually, it's been proving that religions like Vegetal, Sainto Daime or 
Native American Church are "bona fide religions" and/or their 
practitioners the same which has been the crux of the matter in American 
court cases regarding their "use of sacraments".  Once you prove that, it

the constitution pretty bad to prevent it.

Of course this administration has already done it's share of twisting

wrong.

(d) Notwithstanding subdivision (a), clear, colorless, and 
transparent material may be installed, affixed, or applied to the 
front side windows, located to the immediate left and right of the 
front seat if the following conditions are met:

(1) The material has a minimum visible light transmittance of 88 percent.

(2) The window glazing with the material applied meets all 
requirements of Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 205 (49 
C.F.R. 571.205), including the specified minimum light transmittance 
of 70 percent and the abrasion resistance of AS-14 glazing, as 
specified in that federal standard.

(3) The material is designed and manufactured to enhance the ability 
of the existing window glass to block the sun's harmful ultraviolet A rays.

(4) The driver has in his or her possession, or within the vehicle, a 
certificate signed by the installing company certifying that the 
windows with the material installed meet the requirements of this 
subdivision and identifies the installing company and the material's 
manufacturer by full name and street address, or, if the material was 
installed by the vehicle owner, a certificate signed by the 
material's manufacturer certifying that the windows with the material 
installed according to manufacturer's instructions meets the 
requirements of this subdivision and identifies the material's 
manufacturer by full name and street address.

(5) If the material described in this subdivision tears or bubbles, 
or is otherwise worn to prohibit clear vision, it shall be removed or replaced.

NOT wrong! I have had friends cited and unable to plea even with the  
best attorneys aiming for a defense precisely for not following the  
details Sarillon correctly but perhaps misunderstandingly quotes from

Subject: [sfraves] nrr: looking for large room or studio in SF

Me, 28 in july (happy bday to me) working as a loan officer in Levi's Plaza, 
i don't have golden credit. have to put that out there, saves time. Cancer, 
sag rising, moon in libra. I am a homo, I am pretty fun. I am looking for a 
nice big SF room or studio space to rent. I prefer lots of sun/garden type 
atmosphere with great people... I am an artist, respectful of housemate 
styled dj, promoter, news junkie, reiki master, meditator, and full of 
laughs. I love wine tasting and going to the farmers market. I love to go 
out on the weekends be social. Would love to find a housemate who is fun and 
creative. During the week i like to be a bit of a hermit, watching my shows 
(giant's games-hell's kitchen) and reading...sometimes working from home. I 
have a lot of things but I am assuming that most of it will be put into 
storage or sold. If you have any leads, please feel free to contact me. If 
you can forward this note to anyone you know who may need a housemate, that 
would be great! I would like to pay around 800/mo or so. negotiable however. 
Looking in any area of SF (castro, noe, hayes, cole, soma, southbeach, 
dogpatch, portrero pref'd) Please no control freaks or whak jobs, kind of 
over all that :)
Thanks,
Danny

Hey Everybody

Breasts Not Bombs is Back!

Since I will be performing my one-woman show 
OH MY GODDESS! at THE MARSH, 1062 VALENCIA ST, SAN FRANCISCO
THURSDAY JUNE 22ND THROUGH SATURDAY JULY 14TH  AT 8 PM

THIS IS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO DO OUR BREASTS NOT BOMBS DEMONSTRATIONS IN THE 
BAY AREA

THIS IS TO ANNOUNCE OUR FIRST OF THREE ACTIONS

FRIDAY JUNE 23RD
NOON
THE MILITARY RECRUITMENT CENTER IN OAKLAND
21ST AND BROADWAY

We are heartbroken over the story of US Soldier Suzanne Swift who has not 
only suffered the emotional injuries of an unjust war, but further damaged by the 
indecencies of soldiers in her own unit. She has refused to return to Iraq 
and was arrested by the Military and taken to Fort Lewis in Washington.  This 
and the ongoing indecencies of the Military under George Bush and Donald 
Rumsfeld, from Haditha to Guantanamo Bay brings us into the streets again to make the 
most powerful,, positive non-violent statement we can think of.  We welcome 
women and men to bare their Breasts to define what is decent in this world 
(mothers, babies, kindness, nurturing, feeding, education, etc.) and what is not 
(torture, massacres, warprofiteering, raping female soldiers, etc) Bring signs 
to indicate what you feel is indecent.

The right to demonstrate bare breasted in protected under the First Amendment.

If you have further questions about the legality of this demonstration feel 
free to contact me at mothersmilk@mcn.org

My benefactor told me about it once when I was young and my blood was too vigorous for me to understand it.  Now I do understand it.  I will tell you what it is:  'Does this path have a heart?'

Subject: Re: [sfraves] 420 church

Back in the early 1980's when I was running with what was left of the
Yippies there was this ancilliary organization called 'The Church of
The Realized Fantasies' run by a guy that called himself 'Pope Mickey'
that was actually a front for NYC's first marijuana delivery service.

Our phone number was 777-CASH and our motto was 'We Deliver.'

We had an office above the McDonald's in Union Square and were the
first to use pagers, though those were the ones that when they beeped,
that's all they did, beep, which meant you had to call your office to
see who wanted to talk to you.

Also around this time there was a storefront church in the East
Village that was selling the same sacrament cited in the first Chief
Justice Robert's Supreme Court decision, DMT, for $35 a gram, though I
don't think it's the same group of people cuz their's was a smokeable
blend versus the tea that this group uses.

The East Village group had a freaky religion based around the drug
that kind of centered on Jesus being the serpent in the Garden of
Eden, don't ask, too complicated.

I posted this SC decision to a bunch of groups when it first came this
February out but nobody responded, or noticed I guess, so it's cool
that this guy is doing something with it, but honestly I don't think
he stands a snow cones chance in Aruba of putting this over, but I
wish him luck.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] SRR: legally, can a police officer tell you that
  he's not a cop?


 From what I know, unless he's in uniform, or on the job, no, he 
doesn't.  Unless he is acting a capacity as a peace officer, they are under 
no obligation to tell you who they are or what they do, any more than 
anyone else is required to divuldge that information.

I can say that if they do act as a police officer, while off duty, they get 
put through the ringer from superiors, lots of report writing, and 
depending on teh situation, will get a write up from their superiors, even 
if they are in the right.

In the case of if you are asking somebody if they are a cop, and are 
working as a cop (eg undercover) they do not have to divuldge that 
information.  It woudl sort of defeat the purpose of undercover operation 
if all you had to do was ask somebody if they were a cop.  They cannot 
however break the law directly in orde rto bust you.  That's 
entrapment:  eg- offering a hooker cash to have sex with them.

In the situations I deal with (club security) it's illeagal to solicite 
somebody for drugs within the bar.  Typically an undercover agent may go 
into a club and do just that.  Now, if we catch them doing it, or anything, 
they are ejected form the club immediatly (ABC violation if we don't).  If 
they are a cop, we have the full authority to eject them from the 
club.  This is the rather humor catch-22 of somebody asking you for drugs 
in a club.  They could be looking to score, and they could be an undercover 
looking to make a buy, bust and cite the club for allowing drug 
trafficing.  This is why we always ask patron to notify security if anyone 
solicites them for drugs.

Does this happen?  Sure.  The beauty is that you may very well be snitching 
on an undercover cop.  That's an irony that makes me smile.

Bottom line is, know who you are dealing with in all situations.

I helped get a couple "suspicious" guys thrown out of TELIC one time!  
(Former scout:  that was my good deed for that day.)  They were  unfamiliar and were 
asking too many people if they could get hooked up. Security  asked me to see 
if they asked me the same thing, yep, and within a few minutes  they were 
asked to leave. 
 
On the other extreme, I know for certain that there was a DEA agent at the  
door at some of the Sweets Ballroom parties in Oakland a few years ago. I  
never heard of the DEA doing any entrapment there; I think they just wanted  to 
gauge the situation and saw that although there was partying, it wasn't  out of 
control.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR: PS2 + games for sale/trade...

Hey all...

When I 1st posted I really didn't consider the value of the games I had w/ 
the package. They're worth almost $200 alone, And they really haven't been 
played more than a dozen times at most. Obviously I am not gonna jack the 
price up that high for you folks, but I think $120 is a more reasonable 
price for the whole kit and kaboodle. I could sell the system seperate for 
$80 - but it'll just be the system + controllers.

Sorry for the confusion and wishy-washyness - my poorness and my upcoming 
move into the city compel me to make as much as I can within reason...

It's still a steal. I can list this on eBay and make a helluva lot more if I 
want...

Best of luck, Danny!  After seeing your posts the past couple  years, every 
time you needed a roommate for that fantastic Island  dwelling, I'm kind of sad 
to see that now you're cast adrift, looking for a  new place, new roommates, 
a whole new situation. I know your next place will be  great, too, though. 
Your intuition will guide you. 
 
People -- I think Danny would be a great roommate or tenant ... hook him  up!

Content-Type: text/plain
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

This week, we've got TWO very talented, wicked breaks selectas joining us for Broke-Ass Thursdays. Needless to say, we're all fired up! 

Again from dspaz (thanks d!): 
"Money just can't buy the onslaught of bass Erik Hz can provide with his bagful of tech funk, and breakbeat guru Jay Vigor doesn't discriminate when he rocks a dancefloor proper. Residents Evinrude and m.d.k. will be keeping the crowd happy by churning out the dirty breaks, so join up with the crew and shake it with 'em for free." (DKD) 

Ask the bartenders for this week's drink specials, or check the specials board. 

Broke-Ass Thursdays are always free, the first beat drops at 9pm, and we go 'til 2am. @lpha bar is located at 3848 Geary, at the corner of 3rd Ave. We hope to see you there!

Bassdrop
Wednesday June 21st, 2006
@ Boca (414 Jessie St.)
9pm-2am
21+ w/ID
only $5


You know how Evil Breaks does it. Super cheap with sick talent. Help
us kick off our new monthly @ BOCA with not one, but two amazing
headliners. We've taken over 3rd Wednesdays and from now on, hump day
won't be so bad. Ed209 to follow in July, and Carbon Community to
follow in August.


Featuring:

Deep Impact (Broke/Lot 49/Super Charged/Plastic Raygun/Cyberfunk) - UK

Deep Impact (aka Mark East) is a DJ/Producer from the UK who
originally started out as a Drum & Bass DJ way back in 1994, mainly
DJing in clubs and on the UKs extreme sport circuit with fellow DJ, DJ
Dust (Sie Dyson). Around 1999 the pair were hearing more and more of a
new sound that was emerging in the UK called Breakbeat and decided to
team up in the studio to have a go themselves, the subsequent track
was called "Give It" which was signed to Plastic Raygun.

Mark continued to produce with Simon moving to Brighton based
Supercharged to record tracks like "Methods" and "I Love Music" along
with remixes for The Freestylers. But unfortunately due to family
commitments Simon would have to quit, the pair's last work together
would be the mix album "Heavy Weight Breaks 2" and after a tour Simon
hung up his headphones.

Mark continued to DJ and produce and went on to write tracks such as
"Carpet Muncher" for Cyberfunk, "Rock Tha House" with fellow heavy
weight Distortionz and set up his own label Broke Recordings which
would see him team up with the Autobots for tracks such as "The
Spanish Tune" and "Bomba Latina" as well as his current outing and
IDJ's single of the month "Ultrafunkula" and "Rockin' With The Best."



Stone Lions (Marine Parade/StoneLions.net)

Stone lions is the first solo project from world-respected producer
Damian Taylor, (not to be confused with German wonder-kid Daniel
Taylor). Damian was deeply involved in the last Prodigy and Freeland
albums and is currently co producing the new Freeland album with Adam.

His debut as Stone Lions 'Snow over Arizona', is a deep rolling
musical masterpiece and very true to the original Marine Parade sound,
remember 9 Nickel? The dub mix is a heavy sound-system onslaught
designed with Adam's Fabric sets in mind.



Along with dj's:

Aaron Jae (Evil Breaks/XM Radio/AaronJae.com)
Athena (Evil Breaks)
Emerge (Disfunktion Crew/Breaks FM)

Many of you may be familiar with Jim Gilliam and his film work.  He's  
a remarkable person on many levels.  What moves me most about Jim's  
life is that he dances in the face of great loss, disease and the  
likelihood of death:  http://www.jimgilliam.com/dancing/

"No sage or savior has ever endorsed greed and gluttony as a path  
toward social justice or personal fulfillment.  These sane and  
enlightened people come to us from all cultures and all eras,  
sometimes knowing of each other but more often not.  Socrates and  
Jesus, Lao Tzu and Tolstoi, Gandhi and Martin Buber -- no one can  
find in their lives and words a jot of support for a political and  
economic regime that encourages the acquisition of wealth far beyond  
what is needed for the necessaries -- or even the restorative  
pleasures -- of life while consigning the masses to live and work in  
squalor."
-Stephen J. Fortunato, Associate Justice, Rhode Island Supreme Court.

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of  
the rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will  
gradually become visible."
-Jacques Attali in his seminal text "Noise"

How about having a demonstration called " Breasts not beasts" and
demonstrate against Islamic terrorists that tourture and kill our people
instead. Seems like it is a little more of a pressing issue then our stupid
president and his poor handling of the war. Also, doing anti military and
playing up all the bad things our militarty does just adds fodder and
support for the enemy. We need to play up the positives since this is a huge
psy war. Lets keep things in proper perspective.

Without being too specific, we were notified at endup that some customers 
were dealing.  Now, It's a two sided coin.  Sure, maybe they are, and maybe 
somebody just wants to be bitchy and get somebody thrown out.  This is the 
case with creeping too.  We have to see it, for the most part.  Unless the 
customer is somebody we feel we can trust 100%, or we know them, then we 
take everything witha  grain of salt.  It's kind of like the girl that out 
of the blue says "That guy grabbed by ass, throw him out!"  Maybe he 
did,maybe he didn't.  Statisticaly if he did, he'll do it to somebody else, 
so we watch and see.

Well, long story short, we got a report from somebody, some time later 
(months) that they wer enot only dealing, but dealing some bad shit that 
was dropping people.  They were shortly caught and have been 86'd.  This 
goes along with even if you know the person, that doens't mean they are 
always safe.  Buyer beware.

There are several clubs that have cops on staff.  Typically the cop is 
looking for extra work, so they moonlight doing security.  The interesting 
thing is if they find something on somebody on a door search, they arn't 
obligated to arrest them anymore than any other security.  However when 
they are on duty, they can act on that information in the future (eg- 
traffic violation and decide to search your car and your person at length) 
because they obtained that information about the suspect legally.

Thanks, Shatter, for the info on this. 
To clarify a bit, when I said "I helped get a couple 'suspicious' guys thrown 
 out of TELIC one time!" it might have sounded like I meant dealers. 
Actually,  I meant people who seemed to be cops. They were too insistent about finding 
 someone with something to sell:  "Come on, man, you must know  somebody who 
can sell us some great rolls of e!"  
 
Uh, no, gentlemen. Out they went, not to return.

Yea - I fully question and avoid folks who ask tons and tons of questions

"Great Rolls of E"!

there needs to be a term for the engrish-speak that undercover cops  
do.  i've had some suspicious characters approach me at parties and  
ask some pretty goofy questions, to the point where I started busting  
up laughing at them.

No shit...

I have heard E called all sorts of wierd shit:

"Pills of E"

"E pills"

"X pills"

and a myriad of other terms.

I think any time you have to say more than "Do you know where to get any 
E?",  you look like a fuckin' NARC.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] SRR: legally, can a police officer tell you that he's
 not a cop?

    This reminds me of a party I went to in DC once. I was candyflipping 
that night, it was around Christmas and that fuckhead Pleasurehead had 
the gall to play an anthem trance remix of Jingle Bells. That was a lot 
to deal with, so I decided to go to one of the chill rooms and relax for 
a bit. So I sat on this couch and kind of stared off into space.
    Then, I looked at the wall in front of me and watched it go black. 
As it turned black, a green and yellow strand of DNA formed in the wall 
and started to spin around. I was watching this with great interest when 
someone tapped me on the knee. I looked down to see who it was and I saw 
a guy who said: "Hey man, do you know anyone that parties with that LSD?"
    His face was swirling around in all kinds of weird ways, but I still 
somehow knew he was a cop. "No sir, officer," I said with a hint of 
contempt.
    Damn pigs.

Well, if you look at the last 10 years or so, the murders pile up right 
quick. I'm not talking about just Iraq, but all of the engagements of 
the US military in the last decade or so.

The exact numbers are irrelevant in any case, what matters here is that 
it's US soldiers that are killing way too many innocent people. Further, 
it does no one any good to act like they're justified in killing women 
and children for the sake of their supposed freedom, or to pretend that 
a certain level of innocent people dying is 'acceptable.'

Murder is murder my friend, and the US is bathing in it right now.

Just cuz you have the US military backing you does not justify killing, nor
does killing in the name of Allah.  And if you question the number of those
killed on the wrong end of the US' muzzle,  tallying numbers from Korea and
Vietnam alone will put you in the range of 2-5 MILLION combatants/civilians
killed.  And by no means was Ronald Reagan's War on Drugs and War  Terror
which  focused on Latin America a humanitarian effort.  The effects are
still being felt in many Latin American countries today, the re-emergence of
revolutionary Bolivarism and strong resentment against the US Government and
corporate interests meddling in the region.  The US has done some
extraordinary things, especially with europe after WWII, but it has also
managed to destroy entire countries and leave the people fighting over the
scraps, like in nicaragua.

Subject: [sfraves] Stilldream mini-review 

-------------------------------1150847323
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="US-ASCII"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Stilldream 06 was my first Stilldream party, and it was amazing. The crew  
really went all out with the planning and execution. The music and vibe were  
excellent. A few thoughts: 
 
-- People came from all over! Sure, some from the Bay Area, but lots from  
Sacramento, Reno, Arizona, eveywhere. Even some people from Pittsburgh, PA;  
Finland; Russia; and Ukraine (not that they made a special trip, but it's still  
very cool). 
-- Music was nonstop and excellent. There was really a good variety, from  
hard techno to Woodstock hippie music (Sunday morning). 
-- The last four miles really ARE a very tough drive. I think I'll want to  
rent an SUV next time, even though my Tercel made it without any damage. Be 
sure  to make it there in the DAYtime, drive very carefully, and be sure your  
insurance is up to date. 
-- It wouldn't work to try to shuttle people up the hill because there's no  
way for vehicles to pass on that road. Everybody has to be drivng the same  
direction. 
-- Between 6 and 9 car break-ins. The perps were caught, thrown out, caught  
trying to get back in, and eventually Arnie announced they would go on the 
"Walk  of Shame." I heard this going on but was too tired to get up and see. I 
heard  people booing and Arnie saying not to throw things at them. Then they got 
thrown  out for good. Frontier justice! 
-- It was very, very hot in the daytime. Wasn't too cold at night. 
-- There were indeed a few substances around, like, uh, beer (only for 21  
and up, of course), and yeah ... well you know. Lots of happy ravers. 
-- There were not enough porta potties, and they got REALLY nasty very  
quickly. There was a lot of poison oak on the outskirts, so going back into the  
bushes wasn't much of an option. 
-- Some raver's car hit the only water pipe on the first day, which kept  
people from using the showers, and the crew wasn't able to set up the water  
slides and misters they had planned. 
-- My pics will go on the Stilldream site but i don't know exactly when. I  
took about 250 pictures and some video clips; I'll be getting those to GAMMA  
shortly. 
-- Psyched about next year!!!

Stadanko works for me.

Exactly my point.

Had they asked around that much and the venue NOT done something, they 
could have been brought up on a fine/shutdown.

Regardless of your feelings towards recreational drugs, they have to be 
kept out of the clubs, or we will not have any clubs.  period.

I mean, its' pretty simple.  Do whatever your going to do, outside of the 
venue, ESPECIALLY if they have an In & Out policy.  Don't bring it 
in.  Leave it in the car, do it before you get there, whatever.  Respect 
the club, the owners, the promoters, the DJs, the security, the bar staff, 
etc etc., by not putting their jobs at risk.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Best Club in LV ??

1) Baby's closed at the Hard Rock 2 years ago.
2) Rain is at the palms and totally lame.
3) Pool party at the palms... great if you like
steroid looking guys and hookers.
4) Rehab sunday at the har rock pool is fun... but see
warning o number 3
5) THE ONLY clubs you have a chance of hearing decent
music are ICE ( which is off the strip and has
TERRIBLE management) and Empire Ballroom Afterhours
(which years ago was called Utopia)
6) If you wanna do bottle service and dress well...
your choices in order of possibly having fun are : TAO
at the Venetian, PURE at Caesars, and TRYST at Wynn.
7) Things to note: Clubs here change over faster than
out-of-towners understand. What was cool 3 years ago
is definitely lame now. with the exceptions listed
above, you are going to hear the same
hip-hop-radio-house-all-ammerican-swag-a-lag music
everywhere.The palms has the lamest club scene in town
PERIOD.

Oh yeah... and I live here and go out all the time.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] SRR: legally, can a police officer tell you that he's not a cop?

Yeah, same here.  I's a quick: "Nah, sorry.", and then I make a point  
of being elsewhere fairly soon.

For some reason though, whenever I go out partying, I just seem to be  
a magnet for people both looking to sell, AND for for people looking  
to buy pills.  Even though I've never dealt, and I can't recall the  
last time I bought at a party, it's been so long; but both buyers and  
dealers seem to flock to me.

My personal favorite, though, was at one of Skills' Popsicles....  It  
had to be about the most obvious undercover in the world.  What it  
said to me was:  "Hey bro!  You look pretty OG.  Know where I can  
score some X?"

W !
T !
F ????

I don't know what is more funny and/or pathetic.  The fact that the  
pigs used a friggin *GAME* that depicts made-up SoCal gangbangers in  
the early '90s to try to figure out how us "punk kids" talk in the  
real-life SF rave scene in the mid '00s....  or the fact that even if  
this WERE San Fiero, instead of San Francisco; that it thought I  
would looked "OG"!

(Question for people who've both played GTA and seen me at parties  
before...  If "OG" were real-life terminology, would what *I* look  
like at the average party fit the bill?  I think not!)

If I had been more fast-witted, I guess I should have replied: "You a  
buster." like I was a character in the game as well.  Instead I just  
said my usual: "Nope... sorry", walked away, and totally failed to  
contain my laughter about ten feet later.  I almost fell over, I was  
laughing so hard.


cya,
john

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Best Club in LV ??

Shame about Baby's - my boy Sinestro had a residency there once upon a time. 
Utopia (years ago) was a cool joint - wasn't it right down the street from 
the Hard Rock? My memory is fuzzy as shit...

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Best Club in LV ??

Baby's got replaced by a club called body english...
They must pay off the fire-marshall, cause they pack
like 3 times what is comfortable in the place, and
again, its a really big steroid and hooker crowd.

Utopia back in the day was fun, and so is afterhours
at the NEW Empire Ballroom... Its actually on the
strip, basically a few big blocks from the hard
rock.... but you have to remember that you cannot see
it from the street. I think its behind a walgreens
pharmacy.

Not in the least.

I know of quite a few of the regulars who are all on E, who have admitted 
as much to me, or coke, speed, whatever.  They all leave it outside the 
club.  Hell, I'm pretty much quoteing THEM when I say "leave it outside, do 
it outside."  They make frequent trips outside, do their thing, and come 
back on in, and keep havinga  good time.  I've never thworn any of them 
out, never caught them with anything, because they love the place, the 
scene, the venue, and the staff.

I mean, if you can go out to your car anytime you like, why take any risks 
with having your night blown if you get caught?

Hey man,

Watch out, you better give it back, or else THIS will happen to you:

http://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/21/nyregion/21sidekick.html

To read the 3 week old saga in its entirety, check this out:
http://www.evanwashere.com/StolenSidekick/

Sorry to hijack the thread, as a segue, anyone who attended Stilldream 
care to discuss the *caught* car theives being paraded on the stages in 
front of anyone?

Sorry, another hijack....dumbshit aside, I heard Stilldream was an 
*awesome* party =)

Subject: Re: [sfraves] a few pictures from stilldream

I didn't actually make it this time.  But I still stand by what I  
said on the subject over at bayraves, where there's a tossup between  
"They deserve a beatdown" and "They've learned their lesson through  
the embarrassment of being caught."...

They should've been stripped naked and duct-taped to trees.  Then you  
station a staffer there to make sure no actual violence takes place  
against them; but trowing rotten eggs, vegetables, and feces is A-OK.

Then, after the last person is out, call the cops from a payphone  
somewhere and let them know what the SOBs had done, and where they  
can be found.


cya,
john

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Best Club in LV ??

Eric,

Is there still a little afterhours place of the strip called 1030 there?  My wife and I ended up there a few years back.  It was all locals and a pretty fun scene.  Party didn't start until 4AM, but once it did it was rocking.  Good funky house.

Peace,

Peter

1) Baby's closed at the Hard Rock 2 years ago.
2) Rain is at the palms and totally lame.
3) Pool party at the palms... great if you like
steroid looking guys and hookers.
4) Rehab sunday at the har rock pool is fun... but see
warning o number 3
5) THE ONLY clubs you have a chance of hearing decent
music are ICE ( which is off the strip and has
TERRIBLE management) and Empire Ballroom Afterhours
(which years ago was called Utopia)
6) If you wanna do bottle service and dress well...
your choices in order of possibly having fun are : TAO
at the Venetian, PURE at Caesars, and TRYST at Wynn.
7) Things to note: Clubs here change over faster than
out-of-towners understand. What was cool 3 years ago
is definitely lame now. with the exceptions listed
above, you are going to hear the same
hip-hop-radio-house-all-ammerican-swag-a-lag music
everywhere.The palms has the lamest club scene in town
PERIOD.

Oh yeah... and I live here and go out all the time.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Best Club in LV ??

There are really only two places that are strictly
afterhours now:

1) Good ole DRAIS at the barbary coast. Sweaty
underground location, that on occasion has great music
by local dj's.
2) the much bigger and more comfortable new Empire
Ballroom... which is definitely the hot spot at the
moment.

I think the club youare talking about may have been
held at a place called "Seven".... but im not sure... 

And... everyplace in town is pretty much open til 4 or
5... and the afterhours places open between 12 and 4
am....

Subject: [sfraves] VOTE for your favorite DJs in drag!

Hey all!

I've been selected as a candidate for SisterSF's annual
boys/girl in drag party on 7/22.  I've been asked to spin
ghettotech if I'm selected.  

And you know how hot I look in a dress.  And I'll probably
strip while I spin.

So vote already!  Just pick your favorite 8 DJs you'd like to
see/hear.  ;)

Hi guys,
   
  I am a permanent lurker here on SFraves. Some of you know me, some of you don't. One of the things that originally attracted me to the whole rave scene was the compassion and community that you all exude. I am currently trying to raise donations for the AIDS Marathon and would love it if some of you could help me out. I am not much of a runner but I thought I would try to push myself and raise money for such a worthy cause.
   
  Here is the link to my page http://www.aidsmarathon.com/participant.asp?runner=SF-4113&EventCode=HN06
   
  Even if you can't donate, words of encouragement help. I'm not really a morning person either and getting up at the crack of dawn to run is tough. Anyone else here doing the Marathon?
   
  Thanks a ton,
  Amber

Subject: [sfraves] Teknique gets Silky



I know some of you lurkers live up here and so this is for you...  

Hmmmmm.... Houseandtechno-flavorisindahouse

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------

Teknique - the original bi-weekly held at Bo Jangles was the place to be
during the spring Sunday nights in 2000. In addition to the nutter residents
(D'John, DJ Pat & Dragn'fly - oh and Josh), Teknique was known for bringing
in some sick ass talent to these parts; amongst them Jerry Bonham, Chris
Jackson, Amber & Andy W and others. Ahh... the memories... 

In the end, Bo Jangles burnt down and our little night came to an end...

But..

"theyyyyy'reeee baaaack":

At least for one night, so come out and join us for this reunion of sorts...


And since we have Mek as our guest tonight, we've decided to double this
event up as a "Stilldream Decompression" party.
So come on down and have a few with us.

TONIGHT!

Wednesday, June 21st, 2006

While we still haven't quite recovered from last year, we're back to 
resurrect one of the most out-of-hand spectacles our eyes have ever 
witnessed. We don't know quite how to describe it........mostly cause we 
don't remember a lot of it. But whatever........
Our system is located on Castro, between 17th & 18th, next to the Castro 
Theatre.......they will probably be asking for a $3 donation at the 
gate........

Cya there. Rest up....

Via Sinistrae- Ecstatic Dance Ritual

Shed your false skin and be liberated=20
in the forbidden wisdom of immortality

The sexual energy is Life.=20
Rise as the serpent and the eagle, the spirit united with the flesh
as we dance the dance of existence, death, and change.

The evening will include a full continuous mix of live electronic music =
by Trip Tech=20
(from ambient to tribal, from experimental to trance),
and continuous video projections coupled with a Magickal Invocational =
Ritual.

This is the real thing.

Life unhindered, death unmasked , in a dance older than form.

Friday - June 23, 2006 7:30pm - 10:30pm (No one will be admitted after =
8pm)

At the Gatehouse at Fort Mason Center, San Francisco, California, 94123

FYI,
The other hippie J.C. will be in L.A. during this one. (Just because

We're actually almost 2 hrs into our 24hr Solstice Marathon at KZSU.  So 
get to celebrating proper style if you haven't yet already, damnit!

No details available at kzsu.org.  But I'll provide them if you spank me 
nicely.

No details available at kzsu.org.  But I'll provide them if you spank me

You know...  "How much farther north do I have to move to get away =20
from this shit?"... is a thought that went through my own head =20
several times today.  If this were acceptable, I could just go back =20
to florida and live much more cheaply.  I just got out of a cool bath =20=

myself.  The AC is out at work, and by the time I got home I felt =20
like the floor of a movie theater.

If there is a god, maybe he really DOES hate fags.  According to the =20
forecast, it's supposed to continue to be putridly hot, under the =20
vile glare of the accursed day-orb, all bloody weekend!  And, to my =20
recollection, Pride weekend has suffered this horrible weather every =20
year since I've lived here.   *sigh*   What I wouldn't give, right =20
now, for a more normal nice and cool, moist and foggy and cloudy, San =20=

Francisco weekend for Pride.

I swear.... when I finally conquer the world; top of the to-do list =20
is to find a way to destroy the damned sun.

exactly.. SF IS NOT THAT HOT.  Get your ass to ocean beach if you really
feel like a few 90F days are gonna make you melt.  You'll turn into an ice
cube in matter of minutes in that water!

nickie's, 460 haight st, sf, ca, usa, the metaverse constantly reforming
itself inside will wright's mind

see I wasn't even trying to kid you last time about turning up the heat.
like moths to a flame the reinvesting masses swarmed to flutter to the
rhythms of our skilled selektas, and a hot time was had by all. the tempo
turned so high and the beats dropped so thick that charlie nearly had to
spray everyone in chocolate syrup just to keep us from combusting. and what
a shame that would have been. so let's pick up where we left off, shall we?
without further ado...

:: Smoove (Newsbreakz) ::
your girlfriend's favorite dj returns from his interstellar cruise ship
tour, after being last spotted in kansas city wrangling every last drop of
red state riddims out of the cowtipping masses. you know how he do, so just
make sure to welcome him back home right.

:: DJ Unagi (Word of Mouth / Just Us Productions) ::
a southern california transplant back for a second revolution at the
dividend wheels of steel. expect this repeat offender to serve up a fresh
plate of breakbeats glazed in soy marinade and grilled to perfection.

:: Daneekah () ::
from down south to down under... a relatively fresh face on the san
francisco scene, australia's latest and greatest makes her first appearance
on the dividend stage, bringing her trademark slamming, frenetic mix of
dancehall and electro-breaks guaranteed to move your feets.

Above the Sky 2 Round 2
June 24 2006

As many of you know, Mother Nature decided to throw a fit and rained-out our last party. But not being the sort of people who take a beating and stay down, we decided to throw a make good party. Originally we had planned to exactly repeat the last show's lineup, but due to some scheduling conflicts (that's what happens when you put together a party on short notice) we've made some changes. We think you will agree, though, that this lineup will be just as much fun as the last. So without any further babbling on my part, here's the new lineup for Above the Sky 2 Round 2 June 24th :

LINEUP :: ORDER OF APPEARANCE
ACTUAL RAFIQ Trip-Hop
:: the dRow .San Jose
DJ ABC Nu-Jive + Rare Grooves
:: SCUnderground .Santa Cruz
DJ UNAGI Breaks
:: Word of Mouth \ Justus productions .San Francisco
DJ DICE Breaks
:: Straylight \ Just Say Agency .Monterey
DJ RIPPLE Breaks
:: Subscience \ BreaksFM.com .San Francisco
MICHAEL LIU Psytrance + Breaks
vs
OFFICER BUNCH Psytrance
:: Illumination Records \ Secret Psychedelica .San Jose
:: Ooze System .Sacramento
MUBALI Dark Psytrance
:: Straylight \ Trishula Records .Berkeley

exactly.. SF IS NOT THAT HOT.  Get your ass to ocean beach if you really
feel like a few 90F days are gonna make you melt.  You'll turn into an ice
cube in matter of minutes in that water!

Just ti=o keep ya all realz.. 111 degrees F. in Las Vegas today.. I stepped 
off the plane and felt like I was in a freakin oven.  Rode the tram twise 
just to stay cool.. then wauted outside for s fuckin shuttle for 20 minutes 
and thought I might actauly break a sweat :)  Good thing I use right guard!

Vegas is bad ass mofos.. I am going to visit spires at Trust for locals 
night on guest list - thank you Eric!  Can't wait to post ya'll about some 
Ranger adventures to rock the party!

Just for primers.. after dinner.. the girls leading the tradeshow I am at 
for my company just happened to walk onto this strobe flashing disco bus, 
chanmagne weilding disco bus that sitts 20 in style, with plasma monitors, 
and ice / bar installations on all sides.  Grabbed a few mopre bottles form 
the liquor store and rolled back to the vanetian lounge.  Oh.. forgot to 
mention.. the frealkin bus had two (2) brass stripper poles, and we were 
honey heavy!  Damn.. nice way to hit the strip.  Per! LOL.. wait untill my 
story of tomight.. anyone else in LV.. let;s kick it!

Stay cool Bay Area.. it's still 20 degrees cooler there than here!

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Vegas Baby Ya! - Update

Tryst is amazing..  you know how endup has this little waterfall outside.. 
okay.. imagine about $500 mill to beef that up to a 100 foot three level 
casading actual water fall.. with a pool at the bottom and the whole thing 
is lined against the outside walls with white lounge tables.  Then throw in 
about 10 bars, stripper poles, hot hot hot hot women, and some pretty nice 
people all around all after the same thing.  The sound was great, the 
lighting excellent,

I was supposed to be on the guest list, and when I rolled up to the spot 
there were like 300 people clammoring to get in.  I heard from two people 
that the way in is 1) know someone, and 2) through the doormen.  Once I 
dialed in who was working the list.. it was all  gravy.  I made sure to go 
to the cash machine for $100 in fives, and then started handing em out like 
candy.  Ya.. that worked.  Sometimes rolling solo is so much easier.. there 
is no group complication and it is just easier for people to deal with you.  
I kinda had the feeling last night that is what got me in the door since I 
found I wasn't on the list.. yeah for style points.

It was funny how people (girls) that danced on the platforms had to be 
smokingly hot to be up there.. or they would be asked to leave.  It was 
funny how I had to know somebody in the group to be dancing by their table 
or I would be asked to leave.   People are straight up - who do you know, 
why are you here (on a thurday night).  At the end of the night, the only 
people I really vibed on was this married chica and I don't do that.. but I 
am down for meeting new people so I still made the connect.  I also learned 
how to play three card poker and won $80 for my first time gambling.. easy 
to stop when your up right?

More later, I have a headache :/

Saturday, June 24, 2006 * FunkyCozy @ Anu *

Sat June 24th 9pm-2pm With Guest Hac Le (playcomusic chicago) rezzies: 
Jon Beech Sinukus Tim McCormark and new rezzie Jason Short <BR> Here we 
go for another FunkyCozy - whew, I thought we just had one... erky! 
<BR> Thanks to everyone who made it out to Damian Lazarus last Thursday 
- twas a riot. <BR> <IMG src="www.sinukus.com/images/hac....jpg"> <BR> 
<BR> We're flying in Hac Le ( playcomusic.com/ ) from Chicago for an 
extended stay. Hac has emerged with a distinctive musical style - 
fusing his previous West Coast experience with the local Chicago House 
and Techno scenes. Known for his contrast of light and dark emotive 
soundscapes, Hac has captivated crowds across the country with his 
energetic, chunky, throbbing beats, performing in Chicago (Crobar, 
Transit, RedNoFive), Los Angeles, Milwaukee and Mexico with some of the 
best talent in the industry such as John Digweed, Moshic, BT, The 
Crystal Method, Taylor, Sandra Collins, Paul Van Dyk, Deep Dish, Pako & 
Frederik, Hector Romero, James Zabiela, Kazell and Hernan Cattaneo. 
<BR> <BR> Recently, Hac was recognized by one of the top DJs in the 
world. His mix was hand picked by John Digweed out of over 1,800 
entries as the winner of FutureMusic's Next Big Thing DJ contest. John 
Digweed was so enamored by Hac's winning entry that he decided to 
feature the mix on an episode of his internationally syndicated Kiss 
100 radio show. Hac was also flown out to Denver to open for John 
Digweed's and Desyn Masiello's Endless Summer Tour at the world famous 
venue, The Church. The media exposure has catapulted Hac's name and 
sound onto an even larger international stage.

Wednesday, August 02, 2006 * BOOM FESTIVAL Magic *

Date & Time:  Wednesday, August 2, 2006 - Wednesday, August 9, 2006 4:00 AM
Heya, All! We would like to share with you information about a very special
global arts, music and culture-gathering that incarnates biannually in
Portugal. Boom Festival takes place in a stunning outdoor location on the
shore of the Lake Idanha-a-Nova, approximately 2 hours North-West from
Lisboa. Bringing together the latest in psychedelic sights & sounds,
phantastic art installations & workshops, this week-long event is a harmonic
convergence of people, energy, information, and philosophies, from planet
Earth & beyond. Synchronized multi-dimensionally with the full moon of
August, the next Boom-Festival is taking a bio-dynamic approach by
incorporating a variety of sustainable techniques, and Earth-based forms
throughout its infrastructure. Reflecting a harmonic balance of the organic
and the cyber-technologic, Boom 2006 maps the metaphysical framework in
accordance with Peace, Love, Unity and Respect. A very magical event indeed!
5000 BOOM Festival 2006 Early Bird Tickets are available now. They are only
70 Euro for 7 days. Getting there is no big deal. Reasonable flights to
Lisboa can be purchased on most of the European Budget Airlines, and
Transatlantic flights from America are also quite cheap. The Boom has
organized busses that take you directly from the international airport to
the sacred womb of the vacation party paradise. This year, Boom-festival has
extended its length to ONE WEEK! Great news about the timing of BOOM 2006 is
that it's not happening in conjunction with Burning Man, so the devoted
"Burners" have a chance to partake on European creative community
expression. BOOM is similar to Burning Man, but with a lake & great sounds!
Not to be missed ... For more info, please visit: www.boomfestival.org

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Vegas Baby Ya! - Update

Ah yes.. can I just say that life away from the strip is no less self 
indulgent in LV than it is on.. especially when your chilling with Mr. 
Spires.  I love it when ravers take it all the way.. from love of beats, to 
DJ, to producing, and then over the top to a whole new level.. ya that is 
where Eric is these days  its a whole new game.

Check it - going out Friday was classic LV for me cuz I when I think LV I 
think dinner, gambling, cocktails, and strip clubs. Nothing I couldn't right 
home about but it definitely involved a few seedy places, lot's of scantily 
clad women, kicking it with the boys, losing about $200 and travelin off the 
strip to hang out with some new friends.

Jumping to the good stuff - I lost my partners in crime at 3am and decided 
to call up Mr. Spires.  Of course he has a $1000 bottle table right in front 
of the stripper poles at Tryst, kickin it with several very kind peoplz and 
his girlfriend who bartends at one of the hottest clubs in town.. that's 
Tuesdays plan :)  He comes out and gets me because I am a cheap bastard and 
didn't want to spend $30 bones for an hour before they closed.. and then we 
all roll over to Eric's new flat in west LV.

This house is right out of freakin arch digest.. classic modern desert floor

Eric has some kick ass art.. wanna sell me a painting bro?  I was listening 
to a disk he made a few years back.. bomb ass Proggy House, and he is 
building a studio to do more production work.. hit this boy up for his 
labeled goods ya'll.  Anyway.. rollin onto the spot with these kidz is mad 
fun and I just want to say how bomb it is that we have eachother in SFR 
land, because you are all the freakin shit.. and always will be!

Holy fucking shit...I had one of the best times of my life at the =
Revolution campout this past weekend.=20

Got to the site around 10pm - got semi-situated by the fire w/ our =
mobile bar and started the partying...

Shawn Allen kicked things off quite nicely, and then things got trippy =
with Chris Yap playing what sounded suspiciously more like psytrance =
then techno, hehe. El Juan and Shank tore it up, as did a few others =
that I won't be remembering due to the quantity of liquor I had consumed =
by that point.=20

About that time, I snuck in two hours sleep in the car - then woke up to =
sunlight...

The spot in the daytime was amazing...beautiful location right next to a =
lazy creek that has natural pools in it. When the heat of the day was =
full on, the bulk of us were down at the pools, naked, half naked or =
otherwise...smoking up, quaffing drinks (or whatever other potent =
potables were around).=20

The word I'd use for the spot/vibe would be "idyllic". People were just =
beaming with happiness all weekend long. Sharing with their friends, =
laughing, loving a nice weekend out in the woods.=20

During the early portion of the day, there was some great hip-hop and =
downtempo-y house & breaks w/ Marin, Hickory and someone else I am =
forgetting - then evening segued into some tasty house & "eclectica" w/ =
Cubik & Origami. (amazing set you two!) Then some more breaks w/ Mark =
Ameba, who played one of my all time favorite Bassex tracks much to my =
happiness.=20

Not sure if there was someone after him, but by the time night got on =
(and after a short music-less interlude for some art shenanigans), Donna =
Matrix got things seriously cooking with one of the BEST sets I have =
ever heard her play. At several times during her set I heard records I =
sold her be dropped, and I had to smile at knowing she was getting good =
use of them. After her was honestly one of the BEST sets I have ever =
heard...and I mean EVER. Brian Seed (aka DJ Brian) from the Moontribe =
crew played one of the SICKEST sets ever. It harkened back to the old =
days of crafting a set that  "went somewhere". House, breaks, techno - =
heavy on the psychedlic side of things...it really took us all on a =
journey, and nest to Miranda's set (Donna Matrix), it had the most =
people up and dancing around the fire all night. Midway through the next =
guy's set, I was tired and pretty tore back, so I popped a nap in, and =
then awoke about 2 hours later to more of the same vibe...

Stayed up all morning long drinking and toking and having good =
conversation with friends/family. Around 11am we had a nice little =
grilled meal, then packed up and headed back, as some of our crew =
actually had to work on Sunday.=20

I will be going to next year's campout for sure...slightly better =
prepared and taking an extra day to enjoy the spot.=20

This was definitely one of my best times in California...

~Marco

Wow, this place sounds like an awful waste of money.  I thought "ultra lounges" in the city were bad...  

Bottle/table service is the wackest thing since Hypercolors..  I just can't imagine why anybody'd feel like a pimp just because they paid $300 for a $20 bottle of liquor and the sainted right to sit at a tiny table.  I can throw a wicked house party for 30 people for not a whole lot more than $300.  I guess if one has enough money that $300 is a trifle and they'd rather sit and mix their own drinks than go, say, dance, or trouble themselves by going to, say, the bar for a drink, then, hey, that's a great entertainment value!  Meh.  Exclusivity by design, not by function.  It's like selling gold-plated turds.

"Hey, have you seen my new Fendi turd?  It's dipped in platinum!  Cost a cool 2 Gs.."

"Yeck, I think I can smell it through the coating.  Fendi, though, huh?  Pretty fly.."

"Yeah, it's from the 'Affluent Effluent' series, the girls LOVE IT."

"Oh yeah, I think I'm going to pick up their new donkey piss-filled zirconium-encrusted money clip soon."

"Score bro!" *hi5*

Personally, I think megaclubs with megaqueues and guest list politics are the penultiwack.  I've played a few of them and inside it's always the same- moneyed idiots that can't dance and the golddiggers that magnetize to them, all surrounded by bad architecture, tasteless attire, and vibe in the sub-zero range.  For all of their external bling, most of these places have substandard dj booths, pay performers horribly, and offer paltry niceties to the talent- but that's just a dj's perspective.

Anyway, not to rain on your parade- it was just funny that you seemed to have a good time and like the place despite a "if you dance by my table and you don't know me you're getting the boot" attitude..  Just sounds like postureville to me.  Glad you had fun though.

Tryst is amazing..  you know how endup has this little waterfall outside.. 
okay.. imagine about $500 mill to beef that up to a 100 foot three level 
casading actual water fall.. with a pool at the bottom and the whole thing 
is lined against the outside walls with white lounge tables.  Then throw in 
about 10 bars, stripper poles, hot hot hot hot women, and some pretty nice 
people all around all after the same thing.  The sound was great, the 
lighting excellent,

I was supposed to be on the guest list, and when I rolled up to the spot 
there were like 300 people clammoring to get in.  I heard from two people 
that the way in is 1) know someone, and 2) through the doormen.  Once I 
dialed in who was working the list.. it was all  gravy.  I made sure to go 
to the cash machine for $100 in fives, and then started handing em out like 
candy.  Ya.. that worked.  Sometimes rolling solo is so much easier.. there 
is no group complication and it is just easier for people to deal with you.  
I kinda had the feeling last night that is what got me in the door since I 
found I wasn't on the list.. yeah for style points.

It was funny how people (girls) that danced on the platforms had to be 
smokingly hot to be up there.. or they would be asked to leave.  It was 
funny how I had to know somebody in the group to be dancing by their table 
or I would be asked to leave.   People are straight up - who do you know, 
why are you here (on a thurday night).  At the end of the night, the only 
people I really vibed on was this married chica and I don't do that.. but I 
am down for meeting new people so I still made the connect.  I also learned 
how to play three card poker and won $80 for my first time gambling.. easy 
to stop when your up right?

More later, I have a headache :/

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Vegas Baby Ya! - Update

I hear what your saying.. and yes I am having a good time.. why?? Because I 
am investing in the people I am hanging with, and creating vibe amoungst the 
gold plated turds.  You sound like your hatin on the scene for the same 
reason people seek out the scene.. like it's cool for you to blast something 
so far away from where you are now.

I make vibe happen no matter where I am at - smelly warehouse basements, 
sitting on bass bins in clubs, campouts, parking lots, house parties.. 
Vegas!  Where is your diversity?  It sounds like you reject shit cuz you 
can't access it.. dive and be present my friend.. it will take you a lot 
further than your hatin crap in life I can attest!

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Vegas Baby Ya! - Update

Wow do you miss the point....

10 people go out together, everyone pitches in a
hundred dollars, no one cares if you dance next to the
table, you'd probably be invited to stay if you did,
and everyone has a good time.

Its funny how people make assumptions about things
they've never tried....

And..... for the most part, we all hate bottle service
too... Just one of the things you have to lerarn to
deal with if you want to go out here... And guess
what, its gonna take over SF too, because they (The
club owners) make so much more off it.

Lastly, I had a great time meeting Sean, we all
enjoyed his company.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Vegas Baby Ya! - Update

Since we top post here:

What would happen if there *was* a club with good architecture, great
fashion and awesome vibe? It seems whenever that happens, the same
people as below hear about it, take over and everybody leaves for a
new 'cool-but-not-cool' place.

I agree w/George on all points, but I would have no qualms owning one
of those wack clubs and taking their money - why argue with demand,
idiotic or not? :)

I just can't imagine why anybody'd feel like a pimp just because they paid $300 for a $20 bottle of liquor and the sainted right to sit at a tiny table.  I can throw a wicked house party for 30 people for not a whole lot more than $300.  I guess if one has enough money that $300 is a trifle and they'd rather sit and mix their own drinks than go, say, dance, or trouble themselves by going to, say, the bar for a drink, then, hey, that's a great entertainment value!  Meh.  Exclusivity by design, not by function.  It's like selling gold-plated turds.

I've played a few of them and inside it's always the same- moneyed idiots that can't dance and the golddiggers that magnetize to them, all surrounded by bad architecture, tasteless attire, and vibe in the sub-zero range.  For all of their external bling, most of these places have substandard dj booths, pay performers horribly, and offer paltry niceties to the talent- but that's just a dj's perspective.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Digital download recommendations

http://www.waxdj.com

has hundreds of mixes for download or streaming. I highly recommend 
them, but I will say their sorting database sux, so moving through the 
list of available music or sorting by type or other common sorting 
techniques is pretty non-existent. But if you don't mind the tedium 
there are some real gem mixes on there.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Vegas Baby Ya! - Update

Figure I'll address both replies at once:

I'm not hating for the point of hating.  I frankly believe that table and bottle service is killing club culture, and I love clubbing, so it kills me to see this happen.  Open and shut.  Before this started creeping into clubs around here, by and large clubs were places you could go, with or without friends, with or without much money.  You could go, see great music, meet fun people, spend a little money on drinks or whatever you want, sit wherever you want, etc.  Clubs were designed to bring people together and foster social interaction.

Table/bottle service not only serves to cloister folks off in their own little worlds.  It also sets up a dichotomy of class where there never was one before- those who can afford the luxury box, and those who can't.  The social interaction aspect is de-emphasized, as is the music appreciation/dancing side of things.  The dancefloors at these places are smaller because many folks are just off doing their table thing and the sound systems are often terrible.  Some clubs have no seating at all besides at the rented tables.  What happened to having a place to take a breather after a couple of hours of hard dancing?  Oh yeah, get out the wallet.

The world, IMHO, is bifurcated enough.  Clubs always have stood as social blenders and transporters to another world- places to go to FORGET THE OUTSIDE WORLD for a little while.  When have-and-have-not segregation creeps into the picture, the "corporate" world creeps in with it.  Not only must you "dress to impress" (who?), you've got to pony up the scrill just to sit down.  Your needs as a consumer are not thought of.   It'd be like buying a Mercedes and finding out as the sale closed that the driver's seat is an extra grand.  

---

"Here are your keys, Mr. Morris, enjoy!"

"Hey, there's no driver's seat..  Where do I sit?"

"Sit?  Hmm, on the floor, I suppose, how should I know?"

"Normally there are things called seats in automobiles- drivers and passengers use them to sit in."

"Oh, you must be speaking about the Premium Posterior Support System!  Its padded, adjustable cushions provide exceedingly pleasurable seating for the driver who must have only the best.  Also included in this package is a seat belt, which can be of great help in keeping one's face out of the windshield in an accident!  That'll add one thousand dollars to the selling price.  A very good pick, sir!"  Etc etc...

---

Do you honestly think that comfortable places for people to sit and enjoy cocktails are something one should have to pay more (past the cover) for?  The clubs I go to have great seating, great drinks, and great music (better than most ultra lounges by a long yard).  The people who dreamed this sort of thing up are laughing all the way to the bank, folks.  I hate to stick in yet another dramatization, but this is how that conversation went:

---

"Yo, Vinnie, times are tough, how are we gonna get things going here?"

"Shit, I dunno..  Hey, you know all those booths we got that people like to sit in with friends?  How about if we put up signs that say 'by reservation only', and charge people a couple hundred bones to sit there?"

"Whoa, the crack must have been fresh this morning, Vinnie- why would anybody pay to sit down?"

"Well, we'll take all the rest of the chairs out, first off- and we'll redesign the club and the promo to imply that if you don't got a table, you're dirt, and you'd better start saving your pennies.  You know how those rich guys love to feel more important than everybody else- they'll love a chance at exclusivity in a place where they're usually too unclued and uncool to hang out!"

"Hey now, that's pretty smart- but if they're paying that kind of dosh just so sit down, they're not gonna wanna get up all the time.."

"..so we'll sell em a bottle of liquor we pay $10 for for another couple of hundred bucks, and throw in some 'complimentary' juice and soda, too!  That way the bartenders won't even have to service them!"

"Shit, you're a genius, pass that crackpipe.."

---

You go to a club with friends, you have some drinks, you are comfortable and you have a great time.  Would you have a better time if you paid to sit down, or if you had a nice place to sit down that didn't cost money?  I don't know about you, but when I go out, I go out to mingle, to meet new people, to dance, to enjoy my city's culture.  If I want to sit and down a bottle with some friends, I'll do it in my living room, at 1/10th the cost, where I can choose the music myself and hear my friends talking.  Call me crazy...

I create vibe wherever I go, too, Ranger, but I find it easier to have a good time when I'm not staring down both barrels of typical western money culture.  I throw parties, I've thrown raves, I have a monthly club event- hating on the scene?  No.  Hating on the corporatization of the scene?  Sure.

Hit me back when your favorite fancy restaurant starts handing you your filet mignon in a cone of newspaper and tells you it's gonna cost another $100 for a table and a place setting.  It's worse than corruption of a positive thing- it's simply terrible business and customer service.  At this point, all one can do is vote with one's dollar, and that's what I do.  As we speak, there are still plenty of prime places to club in SF that haven't fallen prey to this nonsense.

To each their own, and I'm happy that you're having fun and mean no disrespect.  If you must deal with this in the places you like to go, then more power to you and I commend your positive attitude- but don't try and tell me you think this is a positive trend.  Getting more for your money is never a bad thing.

Remember when you used to find out that the rave you were at had free fruit and water?  Wasn't that a nice feeling?  Would you rather have paid for it?

Wow do you miss the point....

10 people go out together, everyone pitches in a
hundred dollars, no one cares if you dance next to the
table, you'd probably be invited to stay if you did,
and everyone has a good time.

Its funny how people make assumptions about things
they've never tried....

And..... for the most part, we all hate bottle service
too... Just one of the things you have to lerarn to
deal with if you want to go out here... And guess
what, its gonna take over SF too, because they (The
club owners) make so much more off it.

Lastly, I had a great time meeting Sean, we all
enjoyed his company.

And again I say...I <3 George. Especially after him and Matt tore it the 
fuck up at the campout this weekend.

Good times.

Oh yea, and there was no table or bottle service at the campout...in fact, I 
only paid $20 to party all weekend...

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Vegas Baby Ya! - Update

You're right, it's a great business idea!  I guess I protest more because I don't want to see clubs that *don't* extort like this edged out or forced to conform by clubs that do this.  Already there're a couple of places I used to love that are not worth visiting anymore due to this phenomenon.

The part I didn't touch on is the effect on the clientele this trend has had.  I'm not one to make generalizations, but my experience is that (my definitition of) people I like to club with don't really love hanging out in these places.  That's fine right now, but what if this was de rigeur?  Clubbing would be permanently changed, and in my opinion, not for the better.

Since we top post here:

What would happen if there *was* a club with good architecture, great
fashion and awesome vibe? It seems whenever that happens, the same
people as below hear about it, take over and everybody leaves for a
new 'cool-but-not-cool' place.

I agree w/George on all points, but I would have no qualms owning one
of those wack clubs and taking their money - why argue with demand,
idiotic or not? :)

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Vegas Baby Ya! - Update

Hey... I actually totally agree with the
"hate-on-bottle-service" ideals... BUT... since there
is no choice here, you have to make the best of it,
and we do...

You have to look at it this way for us:
Drinks are $18 a piece.
Door is $30
So, door and 3 drinks with no place to chill is about
$100.

Table service gets you a place to chill, way more than
you can drink, and costs about the same...

Yeah it sucks, but if you go with a group of solid
friends, meet new people, and have a good time, it
works out just fine.

Finally, I agree about table service killing the vibe
in places like SF... its nitrous to the party... But
here, people dance on the chairs, the tables, the
poles, whatver... rather than make everyone sit down,
people make the best of their rented space....

Its all what you make of it.

Hey... I actually totally agree with the
"hate-on-bottle-service" ideals... BUT... since there
is no choice here, you have to make the best of it,
and we do...

You have to look at it this way for us:
Drinks are $18 a piece.
Door is $30
So, door and 3 drinks with no place to chill is about
$100.

Table service gets you a place to chill, way more than
you can drink, and costs about the same...

Yeah it sucks, but if you go with a group of solid
friends, meet new people, and have a good time, it
works out just fine.

Finally, I agree about table service killing the vibe
in places like SF... its nitrous to the party... But
here, people dance on the chairs, the tables, the
poles, whatver... rather than make everyone sit down,
people make the best of their rented space....

Its all what you make of it.

E

And again I say...I <3 George. Especially after him and Matt tore it the 
fuck up at the campout this weekend.

Good times.

Oh yea, and there was no table or bottle service at the campout...in fact, I 
only paid $20 to party all weekend...

Subject: Re: [sfraves] thread kill -  Vegas Baby Ya!

I am stoked this thread has gone where it has.. great discussion on culture, 
business, and trend.  I know that I do not hold Vegas up as my standard to 
the end-all-be-all of musci and party culture.. and I don't think ANYONE 
here does either.. because many of them came from SF and threw some of the 
biggest massives at Home Base and yes.. they (I was not yet partying)  all 
know eachother and continue to watch the scene evolve, the same us us 
revelors ~ some for the music, some for the culture, some for profit.  Hey - 
it's all part of the game.. like they say.. don't hate the player!

I write for diversity.. I am not here to criticise.. where would my 
experiences lead me if I did.  I would be too critical of this or that, I 
would only hang out in the living rooms of my DJ friends because of course 
they are all bad ass mutha fuckin DJs.. with free music and great vibe.  And 
I do.  But I also want more and less at times.. I want diversity, new crowds 
experience.. good and bad.. no matter what the price at times cuz sometimes 
it's free.. and sometimes it costs a lot more than money.  Pick your 
battles, dig deep.. be engaged wherever you find yourself.

Anyways.. I think that just about wraps up my reports for Vegas.. because 
now the real fun begins for the weekday parties.. the good local shit.  And 
as they say.. what happens in Vegas.. won't be makin it back on SFR :)

I'm all right with a little dig.. no worries.. just trying to share a little 
vibe with ya'll ~ make of it whatever you like.. but now you know a little 
bit more about Ranger.. aka Rock Baby LOL ((-]

You're right, it's a great business idea!  I guess I protest more because I 
don't want to see clubs that *don't* extort like this edged out or forced to 
conform by clubs that do this.  Already there're a couple of places I used 
to love that are not worth visiting anymore due to this phenomenon.

The part I didn't touch on is the effect on the clientele this trend has 
had.  I'm not one to make generalizations, but my experience is that (my 
definitition of) people I like to club with don't really love hanging out in 
these places.  That's fine right now, but what if this was de rigeur?  
Clubbing would be permanently changed, and in my opinion, not for the 
better.

Since we top post here:

What would happen if there *was* a club with good architecture, great
fashion and awesome vibe? It seems whenever that happens, the same
people as below hear about it, take over and everybody leaves for a
new 'cool-but-not-cool' place.

I agree w/George on all points, but I would have no qualms owning one
of those wack clubs and taking their money - why argue with demand,
idiotic or not? :)

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Vegas Baby Ya! - Update

Does Vegas no longer do the "free liquor while you gamble" thing?

Cuz I went to Vegas w/ $50 and was PLASTERED the whole time I was there, 
just for plunking some quarters in the slots from time to time and sitting 
next to the closest bar possible while doing it. I tipped of course, but was 
never charged for cocktails. We basically just did that the whole time, and 
when we were good and wasted, THEN we went out to the clubs...hehe.

Subject: RE: [sfraves] Vegas Baby Ya! - Update

Lol you seem to think this is a new phenomenon or something, nightlife in
general and clubs specifically have often been just as much about
exclusivity as inclusivity.  Bottle service has been around for a loonngggg
time my friend, so has the VIP room, the coke room, the guestlist, etc.

There are places in SF that cater to all tastes and very few venues do
bottle service or enforce a dress code, for people that enjoy that
atmosphere enjoy do your thing I will go do mine, plenty of options around.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Vegas Baby Ya! - Update

I don't think he thinks this is a new phenomenon, but one that is becoming 
more prevalent, and therefore making clubbing (in general) more on the side 
of "lame" than "cool".

It's just another reminder of the growing class divide...and in a place 
where you're supposed to be having fun and dancing and whatnot, that's a 
shitty place to be reminded of it.

Sheesh.

Yes, they do, it's just not consistent.

I guess if you are on a uber budget you can loiter around the slots, 
pretend to gamble and get free drinks, but sometimes the cocktail 
waitresses just dissappear and you're stuck waiting forever. Plus the free 
courtesy drink usually suck.

You can usually get much better free drink service at say, a $25 blackjack 
table. But that only works if you're winning, or at least breaking even.

I like the locals dive bar approach.

I remember going to a rave (not club) in Vegas that Siphon had a gig at, 
can't remember where, but they had this dive bar attached to it. Nobody 
except us went in because they either didn't know about it, or they 
weren't 21 (it was kindaofa kiddie-rave)

Long story short, the bartender rigs the pool table so we can play for 
free, charges us like $2-3 for top shelf, and gives us a bunch of free 
rounds. Four of us drank *all night* for less than $60.

I've paid $60 for a round of 3 drinks at the Bellagio.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Vegas Baby Ya! - Update

Yea...I do remember some casino's being more inconsistant about the free 
drinks. And thus my methodology of going to the Fremont street area (or "old 
Vegas") and hitting the Golden Nugget or one of those old casinos - they 
tend to pour a little more heavy and bring drinks more frequently - plus 
they let you get multiple coktails sometimes...

I dunno, like I said, I brought $50 with me, and even though a friend paid 
for my meals, that $50 got me slots gambling and many a free cocktail. 
Anyone who knows me knows I drink a lot, and I was fairly trashed the entire 
two and half days...so something was working in my favor, lol.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Vegas Baby Ya! - Update

THats kinda a funy question..

Of course they still give you free drinnks when you
gamble, cuz they usually make more off you losing
money than they pour in booz. Plus, the more you
drink, the more you usually lose... So it still might
be cheaper to buy $18 drinks in the club at the end of
it all.

Subject: [sfraves] Table/Bottle service  Was: Re: [sfraves] Vegas Baby Ya! - Update

I know it's not new, but it's certainly growing in popularity, and I think that sucks.  Good clubbing, to me, is still about inclusivity.  A good club is just a couple of steps away from a good underground party, ideally- with better infrastructure and legitimacy.  All of these see-and-be-seen "services" are the work of entrepreneurs and marketing people that strive to reap the financial benefits of social pressures and class divisions.  Bottom-feeding behavior of the lowest level, and unfortunately, very American.

So yeah, that attitude and its trappings may be age-old, but that doesn't mean they belong here.  Just 5 years ago I could count the number of places in SF that trifled with this foolishness on one hand, and none of them were considered real nightspots- they were considered caches for the rich.  

But yeah, hey, to each their own...  ..until all of my favorite clubs become marina-chick/fidi-guy clutches, and then, by gum, it's gonna be WAR.  (or time to move)  ;)

Lol you seem to think this is a new phenomenon or something, nightlife in
general and clubs specifically have often been just as much about
exclusivity as inclusivity.  Bottle service has been around for a loonngggg
time my friend, so has the VIP room, the coke room, the guestlist, etc.

There are places in SF that cater to all tastes and very few venues do
bottle service or enforce a dress code, for people that enjoy that
atmosphere enjoy do your thing I will go do mine, plenty of options around.

HAHAHA...that's why I never went past the quarter slots until I had won some 
loot, then I played roulette, then when I was back at $50, I went back to 
the slots, got more free booze and started all over....it was a great method 
for me!

Here's another gross thing about bottle service...

Since they require you to buy a bottle for evry 4
people, there is almost no chnace of finishing the
liquor... So what do they do? They "marry" the
leftovers into their bar stock , thus selling the
liquor twice.

I would be very interested in studying the demographics of dress-shoe  
clubs in both Vegas and San Francisco.  The former would be heavily  
tourist oriented I would think and therefore Vegas clubs would  
attract those who spend heavily for a few days...not locals who work  
in the tourist business. Where do the locals party?  Do bar tenders,  
etc., accumulate enough wealth to spend hundreds of discretionary  
dollars each weekend in clubs?

San Francisco, IMHO, is becoming more like Vegas.  With the middle  
class disappearing all over the Bay SF entertainment will focus more  
on the discretionary dollars of tourists than those who smoke some  
weed and drink free water all night.

Raves began here when, amongst other irritations, the communal dance  
folks got tired of the clubs.  Raves ended when those involved saw  
opportunities to make bucks...like the clubs.  My partner collected  
boxes of old fliers from late eighties early nineties SF underground  
gay and mixed parties we used to attend.  All of them were hand  
written and run off on color papers.  Some were stickers one would  
paste on one's black motorcycle jacket:)  Then came the late  
nineties.  Four color fliers.  BIG.

"No sage or savior has ever endorsed greed and gluttony as a path  
toward social justice or personal fulfillment.  These sane and  
enlightened people come to us from all cultures and all eras,  
sometimes knowing of each other but more often not.  Socrates and  
Jesus, Lao Tzu and Tolstoi, Gandhi and Martin Buber -- no one can  
find in their lives and words a jot of support for a political and  
economic regime that encourages the acquisition of wealth far beyond  
what is needed for the necessaries -- or even the restorative  
pleasures -- of life while consigning the masses to live and work in  
squalor."

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Table/Bottle service  

Actually, some places will let you walk with the
bottle if it's capped, others will hold it for the
next night, but all of them don't tell you this and
certainly make no effort to let you know...

My biggest thing about the bottle service requirement
is this:
One bottle per four people guarantees that everyone is
drunk. Forcing you to order enough liquor guarantees
that there is no sober driver. They are responsible
for cutting you off if you've had to much... Thus the
paradox of requiring you to order enough to get drunk,
while legally having to cut you off when you've had
too much.

Personally, I would rather have to pay a "table fee"
and get bottles for a reasonable price, rather than
have the table price built into the bottles. On big
weekends, like fight nights, nascar, Car shows, etc...
they bump the bottle requirment to a minimum of 3
bottles, PERIOD, regardless of how many people are
with you.

Luckily, my friends and I know someone in charge at
nearly every establishment, and because liquor reps
are constantly pushing their new thing, we usually get
a buy 1 get one comped deal, which makes it about
$400-500 for a group of 8 or so... which really aint
that bad at the end of the night.

Like I said though, this model is moving everytwhere.
When I moved here, I couldn't believe how lame the
clubs were. Music wise, most still are. I thought the
SF style would come here sooner or llater, but it
seems the reverse is happening, including the shitty
music format.

It's one of those things that sucks, but is coming no
matter weather you want it or not...Kinda like trance
hitting SF in the late 90's... It was horrible, we all
imagined that it would never take over the groovy
house vibe in SF... but it certainly did.

About 5-7 years ago my wife and I went to a small after hours place off the strip called 1030.  The only people there besides us were locals from the service industry getting off the late shift.  I think there was a $5 cover, but the drinks were cheap and there was no bottle service that I saw.  Just funky SF style house, smiling, and dancing...

I guess that place is gone now...I think the Boston Grill took over that space.  But I think other places like this must still exist.  Maybe not...

Peace,

Peter

I would be very interested in studying the demographics of dress-shoe  
clubs in both Vegas and San Francisco.  The former would be heavily  
tourist oriented I would think and therefore Vegas clubs would  
attract those who spend heavily for a few days...not locals who work  
in the tourist business. Where do the locals party?  Do bar tenders,  
etc., accumulate enough wealth to spend hundreds of discretionary  
dollars each weekend in clubs?

San Francisco, IMHO, is becoming more like Vegas.  With the middle  
class disappearing all over the Bay SF entertainment will focus more  
on the discretionary dollars of tourists than those who smoke some  
weed and drink free water all night.

Raves began here when, amongst other irritations, the communal dance  
folks got tired of the clubs.  Raves ended when those involved saw  
opportunities to make bucks...like the clubs.  My partner collected  
boxes of old fliers from late eighties early nineties SF underground  
gay and mixed parties we used to attend.  All of them were hand  
written and run off on color papers.  Some were stickers one would  
paste on one's black motorcycle jacket:)  Then came the late  
nineties.  Four color fliers.  BIG.

sorry - shoulda been more clear.  i'm looking for new releases, not DJ=20=

mixes.

i got a pair of CDJ-800s last week, and i'm trying to get past my vinyl=20=

addiction. i heard that bytes are much less harmful to your body (no=20
back strain from carrying your wax to gigs), and a lot cheaper. :-)

sorry - shoulda been more clear.  i'm looking for new releases, not DJ
mixes.

i got a pair of CDJ-800s last week, and i'm trying to get past my vinyl
addiction. i heard that bytes are much less harmful to your body (no
back strain from carrying your wax to gigs), and a lot cheaper. :-)

Bingo to Apollo for stating the obvious yet not often enough said.

These events are gatherings, where the promoter, the DJ and the attendee 
melted away and all became participants.  Where the rules and societal 
mores gave way to a simpler ethic, one that embraced personal freedoms, 
and a result that at worst was a lame night out, at best was a life 
changing experience.  So many nights were I came with $5 to get in and 
that's all I worried about, walking home in the san francisco morning 
light aware, in love, bulletproof.  Other nights where I brought sound.  
Other nights where I shared music.  Mornings where people would offer to 
carry my records, not because I was a DJ, but because they looked heavy.  
Afterparties where we fell asleep on each other and woke up to the same DJ 
playing Brian Eno 8 hours later.  Bringing fruit to parties and just 
handing it out in the chill room.  The communal wail of one person yelling 
in joy and having everybody else join in, we became rays shooting out of a 
sun nobody could see but all knew was there.  Tangible energy arcing 
across the sky, the future promising if only because it might be 1% of the 
way we felt right then.  We took such good care of each other and some of 
us still do.

The opposite of a proper rave or underground gathering is the VIP club.  
I don't even want to fucking hear about it.  Take your velvet ropes and 
shove them up your ass, and with gusto.  For them to have value it means 
people coming out and being told "no, you're not good enough".  Not what I 
signed up for, not at all.  I don't care what the criteria is... if it's 
who you know, what color your skin is, how much dick you suck or how much 
money you appear to have... it's fucking retarded.  The world needs 
another stuck up club full of hair product guidos and platinum sluts with 
mouths like groupers like I need a hernia.

Take your fucking SUV driving, platinum money clip lying to get laid ass 
and get the fuck out of here.  You're the opposite of getting it, we built 
this in spite of you because we wanted the music, and the dancing and the 
synergy of human energies without all that shit.  You broke rock, you 
broke disco, you break everything you touch, you are dead cities and 
capitalism and face lifts and dishonesty and fear personified.

I want to dance with the ugly people, the poor people, the outsiders, the 
freaks, the nerds, the new kids in town, the people who don't know the 
right people people.  I don't want to enjoy my obviously overpriced bottle 
of what have you in the vip lounge, I want my ass kicked by music, mind 
ripped by intensity, and if I meet some friends for life hell yeah.  I 
prefer big brains to gold chains and I prefer it when the beat is greater 
than the ego.  Make me beg at a velvet rope, search my body for shit that 
is mine, and call me a VIP?  I'm a man who doesn't buy that shit for a 
minute, fuck off.  The only service that shit provides the world is taxing 
the stupid, you're all fucked in the head.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Table/Bottle service



When Eric hooked our crew up with Pure guestlist, we had
a great time.  Without bottle service, you could either wander around
aimlessly or dance.  The music on the main floor was terrible.  However,
on the upstairs patio, there was a nice little soundsystem with fantastic
music.  With the warm desert night breeze blowing on us, and the Strip
lit up all below us, we really felt like we were having a prime
Burning Man expereince.  Our crew totally got the upstairs soundsystem
jumping, all the bottle service people seemed too uptight to dance.  The
DJ was totally loving us.

We felt like we earned our free entrance by really getting a proper party
going on the patio.

Of course, when we finally got tired, there was no where to chill out,
so we just went back into the casino.  Vegas Baby!

Bingo to Apollo for stating the obvious yet not often enough said.

These events are gatherings, where the promoter, the DJ and the attendee 
melted away and all became participants.  Where the rules and societal 
mores gave way to a simpler ethic, one that embraced personal freedoms, 
and a result that at worst was a lame night out, at best was a life 
changing experience.  So many nights were I came with $5 to get in and 
that's all I worried about, walking home in the san francisco morning 
light aware, in love, bulletproof.  Other nights where I brought sound.  
Other nights where I shared music.  Mornings where people would offer to 
carry my records, not because I was a DJ, but because they looked heavy.  
Afterparties where we fell asleep on each other and woke up to the same DJ 
playing Brian Eno 8 hours later.  Bringing fruit to parties and just 
handing it out in the chill room.  The communal wail of one person yelling 
in joy and having everybody else join in, we became rays shooting out of a 
sun nobody could see but all knew was there.  Tangible energy arcing 
across the sky, the future promising if only because it might be 1% of the 
way we felt right then.  We took such good care of each other and some of 
us still do.

The opposite of a proper rave or underground gathering is the VIP club.  
I don't even want to fucking hear about it.  Take your velvet ropes and 
shove them up your ass, and with gusto.  For them to have value it means 
people coming out and being told "no, you're not good enough".  Not what I 
signed up for, not at all.  I don't care what the criteria is... if it's 
who you know, what color your skin is, how much dick you suck or how much 
money you appear to have... it's fucking retarded.  The world needs 
another stuck up club full of hair product guidos and platinum sluts with 
mouths like groupers like I need a hernia.

Take your fucking SUV driving, platinum money clip lying to get laid ass 
and get the fuck out of here.  You're the opposite of getting it, we built 
this in spite of you because we wanted the music, and the dancing and the 
synergy of human energies without all that shit.  You broke rock, you 
broke disco, you break everything you touch, you are dead cities and 
capitalism and face lifts and dishonesty and fear personified.

I want to dance with the ugly people, the poor people, the outsiders, the 
freaks, the nerds, the new kids in town, the people who don't know the 
right people people.  I don't want to enjoy my obviously overpriced bottle 
of what have you in the vip lounge, I want my ass kicked by music, mind 
ripped by intensity, and if I meet some friends for life hell yeah.  I 
prefer big brains to gold chains and I prefer it when the beat is greater 
than the ego.  Make me beg at a velvet rope, search my body for shit that 
is mine, and call me a VIP?  I'm a man who doesn't buy that shit for a 
minute, fuck off.  The only service that shit provides the world is taxing 
the stupid, you're all fucked in the head.

I know you're out there! I work at a small company that uses Windows Server 2003 as our server, then a few small LAN's that it operates. My comp & the others are on Windows XP Pro.  
   
  Is there any way to tell if I'm being monitored? More specifically looking for a keylogger or something that would say  when & where I go online. Any advice? I do believe that I have administrative access to the server. . . 
   
  Thanks,

At the end of the day, you can not trust anything that you do not have  
exclusive access to and is not physically locked down.

Use your own laptop.
Keep it with you at all times.
And use TOR.

p.s. if you are being monitored, they'll also know you downloaded this soft=

 install from the CD.

A tad disturbing, but great for researching ebay sellers, and especially
stalking celebrities, when used in conjunction with google maps.

Andy,

While I agree with the rave-ideals speech... The San
Francisco underground/dj scene is the most elitist,
politcal, shit talking, hating scene in the world.
Worst of all, it is way more "exclusive" than any club
I have ever been to. Furthermore, I would imagine you
NEVER goto clubs, because as far as I know, 99% want
you inside rather than turning you away for any
reason.

The whole "velvet rope" thing happens in new york and
hollywood... not here... just a line like any rave...
wait and you get in.

Its unfair to shit on everything other than what you
like.

Most companies cache and log what internet sites have been accessed by what
internal IP. This information would most likely be stored on the gateway
server and only seen by an admin. I have found that getting to know your
companies IT department and buying them lunch and throwing them a six pack
every once-in-awhile is in your best interest.

Keep in mind that they can monitor all the web sites that you go to
that don't use https (SSL). And a lot of traffic from anonmyizer.com
is a red-flag - I can tell when users are doing this kind of proxy or
bouncing it off a home server.

So right now, your GMail traffic is passing in the clear. In the
address bar, change that 'http' to 'https' and hit Enter, and your
GMail traffic will at least be encrypted.

I know they talk mad shit on lists there.... But in
SF, its all peace and love to your face, then how can
I stomp you out before you blow-up and get my gigs in
your back... I'd take the direct hating any day, at
least you know who to watch out for that way ;)

And I wasn't really talking about the SFR list when I
said that... Allthough, I have spent plenty of time
talking shit about how lame the white collar crowd at
release was back-in-the-day... So Im a hypocrit too.

you have to fork over $200 for some wine and a couple hours of sitting on
your ass. ;)

Keep in mind that they can monitor all the web sites that you go to
that don't use https (SSL). And a lot of traffic from anonmyizer.com
is a red-flag - I can tell when users are doing this kind of proxy or
bouncing it off a home server.

So right now, your GMail traffic is passing in the clear. In the
address bar, change that 'http' to 'https' and hit Enter, and your
GMail traffic will at least be encrypted.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] politics was: Table/Bottle service

Naw man...my venting doesn't get anyone anywhere. It'll just cause more fuss 
than anyone needs in their lives, and honestly, part of what I was irked at 
has been squared away already anyway.

But I *will* reiterate how fuckign AMAZING Brian Seed's set (DJ Brian from 
Moontribe/Moonshine) was at the Revolution campout this past weekend. He was 
so on point....it's unreal. The guy knew how to read the crowd at every 
turn, and was just using our collective asses like his sick little 
techno-puppets.

He makes it into my "top 10 sets ever seen" list VERY easily....

That's not completely fair IMO.  This Sunday Sunset+Stompy at Cafe Cocomo for example.  That's only $10...

Green Gorrila has been throwing some affordably priced undergrounds...

Levende lounge has been hosting some decent house DJs and has the dreaded bottle service, but I didn't feel unwelcome or whatever the one time i was there and I didn't drink anything.

YMMV

Peace,

Peter

Well. The groovy house vibe is certainly alive and well... at clubs where
you have to fork over $200 for some wine and a couple hours of sitting on
your ass. ;)

yeah I know, I COULD just pay attention to every post,
but even I don't have that kind of time.  So I have
this new guy in town and he's looking to go out, and I
haven't been to a party in DAYZZZZZ.  So can somebody
hook me up with what's going on this weekend?   Or
week?  Or...Month...

Subject: RE: [sfraves] Table/Bottle service

You can find house in this city every single day of the week at tons of
venues from bars to lounges to clubs, and there's at least one house based
underground happening every Friday and Saturday on the weekend.  If you want
to bitch about here don't move anywhere else in the US.  ;)

Subject: Re: [sfraves] nrr: something fun for today...

i wasn't tryin to be saucy (to you anyway - to danny, yes, i was  
being saucy!).

are you looking to be a career DJ scenester guy?  i dunno - i thought  
maybe you were getting into real estate like Greg Sandler and, <cough  
snort ahem> DANNY, in which case career suicide would actually be a  
bad thing.

breaks are gonna go out of style soon enough, and all those fuckers  
will move on to the next "trance", whatever it might be, so you can  
still be a career DJ.  keep the faith.

Haha...word man.

And no - scenester is by far and away the LAST thing I wanna be known as. 
But Djing is a passion...maybe not a career in the monetary sense of the

Preach on!  Halelujah!

I'm so psyched about playing at a little july 4th shindig.  Doesn't

BUT, you can go in and out and have drinks in the car.
You don't have to be in the middle of the dancefloor
to hear it rockin' at DNA and the que is rad cuz you
meet the BEST people outside! Have some sixlets and a
refocus a little and those negatives can turn
positive!

AND.. its not everyday that Dan the Man gets billed to
play pre '96 tracks. Thats the treat for sure. I'm not
really going for any other reason and I gotta drive
from the South Bay!

Sometimes i think its better to regret what i've done
rather than regret what I haven't done.. maybe that's
just me.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Alumni!!!

Yea, but I saw Dan tag w/ Scott Henry doing all pre '96 shit a couple years 
back...which was doubly as good.

And I can't imagine going in and out of DNA will be easy...especially with 
the insane queue that happens on Alumni nights.

I may still go...but I just don't like wall to wall people venues, and the 
high drink prices suck ass.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Alumni!!!

I dunno - I am not impressed with the drinks there. I much prefer Butter.

OOOH - now THAT gives me an idea. Butter is FREE. Maybe I can go to DNA, 
leave to get drinks at butter, and then come back. They make HELLA strong 
drinks at Butter...and they're way cheaper.

What to do...what to do.

Subject: Re: Re: [sfraves] Alumni!!!

I dunno - I am not impressed with the drinks there. I much prefer Butter.

OOOH - now THAT gives me an idea. Butter is FREE. Maybe I can go to DNA, 
leave to get drinks at butter, and then come back. They make HELLA strong 
drinks at Butter...and they're way cheaper.

What to do...what to do.

I used to have this shirt I got at Solid Grooves with little elf-like smiling E pills on the sleeves that would be perfect.  Wonder if I still have it somewhere...

What is "raver attire" tho? That could be anything...I mean, I'm a raver and 
I wear normal clothes, lol.

I bet that argument won't work at the door tho. LAME.

Guess I'll have to break out the JNCO's and sweater vest....

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Alumni!!!

The last few times I was at 1015 I had a fucking BLAST. Seems like they are 
finally in a better spot for events/staff and shit.

I like DNA actually - just hate their lame drink prices. As a professional 
lush, these things matter to me...

I say we all bring a flask or a mix drink extra and leave it out in the 
car for later. THEN, when we meet up, we all go have drinks out on 
harrison. Like the good ole DNA days!

Have too much nostalgia on my hands,

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Alumni!!!

If I wind up there, you know damn WELL I will be shitfaced before even 
walking in.

Although, and old skool party almost seems worthy of "gettin' my thizz-face 
on" for, lol.

But dammit...SMOKE BREAKS at Alpha Bar is still FREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!

Both perhaps.

Damn - in DC I had a glaring LACK of things to do every weekend. Now in SF I 
have TOO MUCH to choose from. I guess it's either feast or famine. TIME TO 
PIG OUT!!!!

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Alumni!!!

I haven't been to either club for a while, but I was really excited when DNA first re-opened.  Remembering the bathroom from the original DNA, walking into the new clean, fresh, puke free, and fully operational facilities was a real welcome surprise.  Last time I was at the DNA, there was a homeless guy with a live chicken on his head wandering around the line area.  A few months later, in the pricey Neimann Marcus catalog aka The Book, there was a picture of a high fashion model with (you guessed it) a chicken on her head.  

Whacked.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] beach party saturday

I'm sure you all know this already, but just in case,
can I tell you that the Ranger knows how to party like
a rockstar!!! I have no idea how he made it to work
everyday while going out to whatever was the local
hotspot here in Vegas EVERY night...

When I told him I was too old to keep up with that
pace, he let me know that he was 2 yrs older than I...


Rock On... Glad you made it home in one piece... and I
hope you are still employed ;)

I mean... I usually get my drinks there for free anyway when i'm @ DNA,
but if it's that much of a problem... then go across the street to Butter,
get drinks there for Cheaper, then go back to DNA :)  & when you're @
Butter.. Tell Big J & Oliver that Osby says hi :)

I agree w/ JustinHale btw... good points.. LoL.. 'cause i'm like kinda the

serene dream
quantum possibility
reflecting serendipity through infinity
synchronicity through serenity
our ability to see, beyond what is in front of thee
galaktic mirror reflection
inner engineer genetic dissection
presence manifested in form
above and beyond the norm
key tribal rhythm arrayed nodes dream
Beyond the gleam of light refracted from the inner seam
to all those who deem
everything we see and seem is but a dream
within a dream

Wednesday, August 02, 2006 * BOOM FESTIVAL Magic *

Date & Time:  Wednesday, August 2, 2006 - Wednesday, August 9, 2006 4:00 AM
Heya, All! We would like to share with you information about a very special
global arts, music and culture-gathering that incarnates biannually in
Portugal. Boom Festival takes place in a stunning outdoor location on the
shore of the Lake Idanha-a-Nova, approximately 2 hours North-West from
Lisboa. Bringing together the latest in psychedelic sights & sounds,
phantastic art installations & workshops, this week-long event is a harmonic
convergence of people, energy, information, and philosophies, from planet
Earth & beyond. Synchronized multi-dimensionally with the full moon of
August, the next Boom-Festival is taking a bio-dynamic approach by
incorporating a variety of sustainable techniques, and Earth-based forms
throughout its infrastructure. Reflecting a harmonic balance of the organic
and the cyber-technologic, Boom 2006 maps the metaphysical framework in
accordance with Peace, Love, Unity and Respect. A very magical event indeed!
5000 BOOM Festival 2006 Early Bird Tickets are available now. They are only
70 Euro for 7 days. Getting there is no big deal. Reasonable flights to
Lisboa can be purchased on most of the European Budget Airlines, and
Transatlantic flights from America are also quite cheap. The Boom has
organized busses that take you directly from the international airport to
the sacred womb of the vacation party paradise. This year, Boom-festival has
extended its length to ONE WEEK! Great news about the timing of BOOM 2006 is
that it's not happening in conjunction with Burning Man, so the devoted
"Burners" have a chance to partake on European creative community
expression. BOOM is similar to Burning Man, but with a lake & great sounds!
Not to be missed ... For more info, please visit: www.boomfestival.org

Friday, August 11, 2006 * Sound Asylum by Mizumo Music and Dj Denise *

vocals by Audio Angel (celebrityjunglist). Lasers & lights by STIM-U-LIGHTS.
18+ event located in the heart of San Francisco. Access to full bar for the
