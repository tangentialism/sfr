Subject: [sfraves] Re: Why energy seems missing

	It would be ridiculous to say the rave scene declined all because of 
rent control. However I think rent control has (ironically) over the 
long haul contributed to driving up rents in the city, and to the 
extent that people have to spend more of their time working to pay for 
the cost of housing, that does negatively affect the scene.

	The population trends in San Francisco versus the U.S. over the past 
forty years certainly do not disprove this hypothesis. If anything, the 
fact that SF lost population while the country gained it would be more 
compatible with a scenario in which something about SF was causing the 
city to be out of sync with the national trend. For instance, lack of 
affordable housing due to a decreasing or barely increasing supply. Nor 
does comparing how much Gavin Newsom and Matt Gonzalez spent per vote 
have much relevance, since both of them favor rent control. I voted for 
Gonzalez, by the way.

This sounds like the reasoning of a Talk Show Host (conservative).

use, too many whites are getting away with drug sales, too many whites
are getting away with trafficking in this stuff. The answer to this
disparity is not to start letting people out of jail because we're not
putting others in jail who are breaking the law. The answer is to go out

Subject: [sfraves] Planet New Years 2004 REVIEW

Last night was too sick and twisted. Planet B did one of the best sets I've ever seen... The audio and graphics where clean, thanks Cool World for this event... 

I'd give a 99% rating for the night... However, when we where standing in line to get searched, the rent-a-cop took all my glowing flashing lights, my gum, and bottle of water. I was rather upset over this. Only because I had spent $40.00 on them.. (was not cheap) 

I was proud of myself though, for taking 2 non-techno-goers out to a massive "rave" event... I felt like I had total control of the night. Your party was well organized...... 
I loved how the clock counted down to midnight. The Luniz did a sick ass hip-hop show, damn did they get down...

The speark sound system was fucking great... I swear.. I felt the music FLOW...
---- "Here's to the night"  
Thanks Guys-----

What this says to me is that too many whites are getting away with drug
use, too many whites are getting away with drug sales, too many whites
are getting away with trafficking in this stuff. The answer to this
disparity is not to start letting people out of jail because we're not
putting others in jail who are breaking the law. The answer is to go out
and find the ones who are getting away with it, convict them and send
them up the river, too."

Subject: [sfraves] anyone alive out there? / NYE wrap up

so, how was NYE for you all?

araya and i went to Wish @ Otherworld. i give it a 9 out of 10. they 
had an excellent breaks lineup in the 2nd room, and trapeze 
performances by Kiran and Sandy. oh yeah, and DDR played too. ;-)

after leaving Wish (at 6 am or so), i dropped Araya and our friends 
Sara and Rick off at the house, then went over to SomArts for the 
after-hours action. i showed up thinking it would be breaks playing, 
but i was there early enough to catch the end of the psy-trance (which 
i like, but am not totally crazy about). but then, a great thing 
happened - a guy going by J-Flea started laying down records, going 
smoothly from Dr. Spook's last record into 135 bpm funky, dark breaks. 
all of a sudden, all the trance kids were grooving to breaks, and they 
just kept on going. :-)

I left SomArts around noon, woke all the kids up and made them get 
dressed (which took the better part of 4 hours), and then we all headed 
to Cafe Cocomo for Stompy Stomp. after about 2 hours, we decided to go 
back home to eat, and then come back later. when we got back, the place 
was PACKED, and Galen was rocking the place. what a scene! people 
dressed to the nines - wigs, platforms, costumes... we stayed until i 
literally could not dance anymore, which endded up being 10 pm.

24 hours straight.  today, i pay for it. :-)

hope you all had fun too.

Saturday, January 10, 2004 ** Capricorn presented by Elektrosorcery **

Capricorn, whose constellation is known as Capricornus, is one of the
oldest of the astrological interpretations. Ruled by Saturn, its symbol is
the goat. This is sometimes depicted as a sea borne hybrid or Dolphin. The
image is often an animal with the body of a goat and the tail of a fish.
In one tradition the image represents the god Pan transforming into a sea
creature. A representation, perhaps, of the extremities found within this
Astrological sign. The Capricornian is generally a serious character
possessing a wry sense of humor. Independent, steady as a rock, Capricorn
reflects earthy qualities that range from clever to vacuous. Mostly
cautious, confident, strong willed, reasonable and hard working,
Capricorns are a rock upon which to build.They are capable of great
endurance; a whatever it takes, for as long as it takes persistence.
Reliable in any profession they undertake, but lacking in originality,
they usually excel in following up on what someone else has started. With
Capricorn DJs: DYLOOT, UPHONIC, COVERT, SUNDANCE KID, and more to be
announced. $10 presale $15 at the door.

Saturday, January 17, 2004 ** Cold Phusion Winter Music Festival by BR
Productions, Next Level Promotions, and KCRH 89.9FM **

 he COLD PHUSION Winter Music Festival! Line-up TEASER!!! COLD PHUSION
will feature over 40+ Artists performing on 4 MASSIVE stages of sound! THE
WARP BROS: The legendary Warp Brothers - DJ's Oliver Goedicke and J=FCrgen
Dohr. It did not take a long time and their first single Phatt Bass hit
the German market and made it to the top 3 in the dance charts! Shortly
after this they entered the Sales-Charts Europe wide up to the #2! No
wonder that they draw the music business attention, with placing a solid
techno-track in the sales-charts.Shortly after their uplifting style
flooded Europe, the wave swept over to the US, Canada, Australia and
Japan. You might somehow compare the style of the Warp Brothers to Prodigy
or Chemical Brothers but the truth is that they created their own creative
and unique sound, like you can read in an article of the Face magazine.
Although the Warp Brothers are friendly people - they are in possession of
a lethal weapon, which is called Harder House. Remarkable is their success
in the UK sales-charts #9 and Top 10 positions in several Sales -Charts.In
Denmark they were rewarded with gold. Undoubted the Warpies as they are
keenly called by their fans turn it up on stage! DJ DRC: San Francisco's
Pioneer DJ DRC has relocated to New York City and is geared up to take the
Electronic Music Industry by storm. With her Mixed Album "UNDEFINED" in
the works and a list of releases on IMIX, Vision Music, Off World, Merge,
Twin Soul and her own label Undefined Musik, DRC equivocates the
expeditious pace of her new stomping grounds. Her original music is also
featured in two movies, "Vision of Vibe" with Carl Cox and "Intellect"
being released this February 2003, featuring Paul Van Dyk and many others.
DRC's latest single SEEKER can be heard on the SPANKEE clothing line
websight. With all this under her belt and more, it is obvious DRC has
already had her finger on the pulse of the Big Apple/ Manhattan. DRC

SOMA Sessions Fourth Fridays @ AsiaSF

For the inaugural session we bring you, all the way from Manchester UK,
the sounds of:

MARCUS INTALEX (Soul:r, MIST - UK)  Marcus Intalex is known across the
globe for his infectious, smooth style of Drum 'n Bass. Only a few years
after his first production efforts in 1995 on Flex and his own Intalex
Productions imprint came anthems such as "How You Make Me Feel," "Love &
Happiness" and "Universe," which firmly positioned Marcus as one of the
world's top D&B personalities. Today, Marcus and longtime studio partner,
S.T. Files continue to blaze trails as M.I.S.T. with their wildly popular
Soul:r label. With over a decade of experience on the decks, SOMA Sessions
is proud to welcome back to San Francisco one of the UK's most in-demand
Drum 'n Bass DJs.

METHOD ONE (Cov.Ops, method-one.com)  By 1994 Method One was both an
acclaimed DJ and and experienced rave promoter in Philly. By 1996 he was
also an established producer. Recording with partner Kaos as Atlantiq,
Method One signed tunes to labels like Good Looking and True Intent while
holding down DJ residencies at Konkrete Jungle and Dieselboy's Platinum.
Since relocating to the Bay, Jason continues to wreck dancefloors with his
diverse DJ sets and release top-shelf tunes on labels such as ASC's Covert
Operations.

Friday, February 6, 2004 ** *Oneiromancy* presented by Oneiromancy **

Doing things different from other crews, admission to this event will be
free of charge. We are working on the lineup, but as with all our events,
we want to extend a special invite to all the new DJs who have never
played an event. We are setting aside a number of timeslots, in various
genres, so if you are dying to get out there to play, email me at
wavelength_sf@yahoo.com, with the subject "Oneiromancy" Be sure to include
contact info, links to demos (if you have one), and genre. I know everyone
plays every genre, but if you could limit it to one, that would help. I'm
going to randomly draw names to play for each genre, so DJs who play a
genre that is under-represented will have a better shot. Its all random: I
dont care if we are friends, enemies, whatever. I'll post the list the day
after christmas, so thats the deadline. Oh yes, and unlike other times,
hardcore DJs will definatly get slots at this party. Hope to see you guys
there. (look for the full lineup the day after christmas. ) More info TBA.

Saturday, January 10, 2004 ** Capricorn presented by Elektrosorcery **

Capricorn, whose constellation is known as Capricornus, is one of the
oldest of the astrological interpretations. Ruled by Saturn, its symbol is
the goat. This is sometimes depicted as a sea borne hybrid or Dolphin. The
image is often an animal with the body of a goat and the tail of a fish.
In one tradition the image represents the god Pan transforming into a sea
creature. A representation, perhaps, of the extremities found within this
Astrological sign. The Capricornian is generally a serious character
possessing a wry sense of humor. Independent, steady as a rock, Capricorn
reflects earthy qualities that range from clever to vacuous. Mostly
cautious, confident, strong willed, reasonable and hard working,
Capricorns are a rock upon which to build.They are capable of great
endurance; a whatever it takes, for as long as it takes persistence.
Reliable in any profession they undertake, but lacking in originality,
they usually excel in following up on what someone else has started. With
Capricorn DJs: DYLOOT, UPHONIC, COVERT, SUNDANCE KID, and more to be
announced. $10 presale $15 at the door.

Saturday, January 17, 2004 ** Cold Phusion Winter Music Festival by BR
Productions, Next Level Promotions, and KCRH 89.9FM **

 he COLD PHUSION Winter Music Festival! Line-up TEASER!!! COLD PHUSION
will feature over 40+ Artists performing on 4 MASSIVE stages of sound! THE
WARP BROS: The legendary Warp Brothers - DJ's Oliver Goedicke and J=FCrgen
Dohr. It did not take a long time and their first single Phatt Bass hit
the German market and made it to the top 3 in the dance charts! Shortly
after this they entered the Sales-Charts Europe wide up to the #2! No
wonder that they draw the music business attention, with placing a solid
techno-track in the sales-charts.Shortly after their uplifting style
flooded Europe, the wave swept over to the US, Canada, Australia and
Japan. You might somehow compare the style of the Warp Brothers to Prodigy
or Chemical Brothers but the truth is that they created their own creative
and unique sound, like you can read in an article of the Face magazine.
Although the Warp Brothers are friendly people - they are in possession of
a lethal weapon, which is called Harder House. Remarkable is their success
in the UK sales-charts #9 and Top 10 positions in several Sales -Charts.In
Denmark they were rewarded with gold. Undoubted the Warpies as they are
keenly called by their fans turn it up on stage! DJ DRC: San Francisco's
Pioneer DJ DRC has relocated to New York City and is geared up to take the
Electronic Music Industry by storm. With her Mixed Album "UNDEFINED" in
the works and a list of releases on IMIX, Vision Music, Off World, Merge,
Twin Soul and her own label Undefined Musik, DRC equivocates the
expeditious pace of her new stomping grounds. Her original music is also
featured in two movies, "Vision of Vibe" with Carl Cox and "Intellect"
being released this February 2003, featuring Paul Van Dyk and many others.
DRC's latest single SEEKER can be heard on the SPANKEE clothing line
websight. With all this under her belt and more, it is obvious DRC has
already had her finger on the pulse of the Big Apple/ Manhattan. DRC

SOMA Sessions Fourth Fridays @ AsiaSF

For the inaugural session we bring you, all the way from Manchester UK,
the sounds of:

MARCUS INTALEX (Soul:r, MIST - UK)  Marcus Intalex is known across the
globe for his infectious, smooth style of Drum 'n Bass. Only a few years
after his first production efforts in 1995 on Flex and his own Intalex
Productions imprint came anthems such as "How You Make Me Feel," "Love &
Happiness" and "Universe," which firmly positioned Marcus as one of the
world's top D&B personalities. Today, Marcus and longtime studio partner,
S.T. Files continue to blaze trails as M.I.S.T. with their wildly popular
Soul:r label. With over a decade of experience on the decks, SOMA Sessions
is proud to welcome back to San Francisco one of the UK's most in-demand
Drum 'n Bass DJs.

METHOD ONE (Cov.Ops, method-one.com)  By 1994 Method One was both an
acclaimed DJ and and experienced rave promoter in Philly. By 1996 he was
also an established producer. Recording with partner Kaos as Atlantiq,
Method One signed tunes to labels like Good Looking and True Intent while
holding down DJ residencies at Konkrete Jungle and Dieselboy's Platinum.
Since relocating to the Bay, Jason continues to wreck dancefloors with his
diverse DJ sets and release top-shelf tunes on labels such as ASC's Covert
Operations.

Subject: [sfraves] From NYC 2 SF 2 LA?!?! Read up..

Ok,

So I've been really hating on cali nightlife. So far, SF began looking a
little dindgy, but the Richie Hawtin @ MEzzanine night was hot. As time
went on, I realized SF is one of the electronic music capitals of this
country still, werd. Still can't touch NYC, but its not far off.
Seriously, a few more weeklies, get ruby skye to ditch the dress code or
another club to book their djs, and you're a few steps closer. Anyways, I
just moved to L.A. Man, this club was so fucking tacky tonight. God. I
wanted to puke! It was full of beautiful socal girls, but I could barely
talk to them knowing that they were at that horrible club on their own
free will? Someone please tell me Avalon/Giant is at least ok? They get
some descent talen now and again, but whats it like?!?! Ahh, this will be
one of my last threads, so uhhh, if any of you know me keep in touch via
this email, otherwise, enjoy SF Nightlife!

also, while contemplating a new format for the readers for the new year, it is notable that most are still asleep even while awake. consider that most won't be sort of back to normal, or rather the state pre-new year's celebration, which also, might not have been anyone's personal best, until sometime early next week. it is important to keep this in mind when hiring a driver. :)

Subject: [sfraves] Gatekeeper's Conference Now Going On

My shuttle arrived safely at SFO around 9:30 pm on January 1st.  We are 
currently having a Gatekeeper's Conference down in Santa Cruz, and I 
will be shifting operations to the Berkeley area Monday or Tuesday.

My preliminary inspection of the city on Thursday night was that 
everything seems to still be intact and as I left it before, but I'm a 
little concerned about Geri's postings, they seem to be making a little 
too much sense, when we've gotten accustomed to the incessant 
non-sensicle babble over the years.  Now it's possible that's just a 
phase, but we're not ruling out the possibility the real Geri Dahl was 
kidnapped by para-military right-wing demagogues and replaced her with 
someone else.  Other than that, though, the streets seem full of the 
usual annoying riff-raff, and I guess, for now, that's "normal".

But anyway, if anyone would like to report any suspicious activities, 
either contact me, or Osby, the current gatekeeper on duty.

Subject: [sfraves] New Year's Eve at False Prophet

--=====================_28599013==.ALT
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"; format=flowed

We have two traditions in my family for New Year's Eve.  The first involves 
placing coins outside on the doorstep or other nearby location to assure 
one has money for food and shelter for the coming year.  We also believe 
that the vibe experienced on NYE will continue throughout the year.  Well, 
if the extraordinary vibes I felt at the False Prophet NYE party were 
prophetic this is going to be one fine new year.

This was one of the best undergrounds I've been to all year long.  The 
theme was "Two Thousand Fourest: Winter Kingdom," and costumes were 
encouraged.  I've become somewhat cynical about wearing costumes to parties 
lately because, invariably, if I show up in gear I am one of a handful of 
people thus attired.  But I decided to do what the party givers requested 
and showed up dressed as a woodland creature:  a spotted leopard.  Seems 
people are getting creative again, because the warehouse was filled with 
pans, faeries, hunters and other foresty types.

For a free, invitation only party the production values were very 
high.  The downstairs dance area was filled with amazing electronic trees 
and other visual delights.  Upstairs there was a chill area constructed to 
look like a cave.  It was multilevel and quite realistic.  Much attention 
to detail everywhere.  The countdown to the New Year was illustrated by 
photos projected on the wall of people forming the numbers.  All of it was 
a true labor of love, and I really appreciate the care with which this 
non-commercial party was thrown.

Music.  Really rocked.  Booty shaking breaks and drum 'n' bass delivered by 
Ben, Sheztek, Jauncey and Smooch among others.  Everyone on that floor 
danced and danced to the end.

I knew very few people at this event so it was a chance to meet new dancers 
and sample the vibe of yet another of the diverse dance communities in this 
town.  Wasn't a person there I didn't like.  Much respect, love and 
sensuality in that group.  Left the party and walked into the drenching 
rain feeling refreshed, reborn and reinvigorated.  Can't ask for more.

Thank you 43 House for this wondrous beginning to the new year.  The 
underground is indeed quite alive and better than ever.

Happy New Year All.

Love,

Apollo

Subject: Re: [sfraves] nrr: Found tan/white Pitt, is it yours ?

okay she's gone. . .

I took her to the doggie grinder. . .they asked me if I wanted any pieces of
her but I had enuf already. . .

nah, shes at the friends of fairmont animal shelter and they'll keep her for
five days and then she'll be up for adoption.  .. if you're interested
inquire there. of course I'll check up on her .. .

sad givin her up like that, but I'll check her and thats the most likely
place someone will look for her. cool girly tho, she just walked next to me
wherever, and when I grabbed my keys she just jumped onto the passenger side
ready to go. . . didn't eat my kittie or anything badd like that but you
could tell she was sad n lost. . .

hehe, funny how I'd be more likely to do that for a doggie than a person. .
.

Hey all,

did someone happen to lose a gorgeous girly pitt bull somewhere in the bay
area ? She looks about a year old, doesn't mind cats or other dogs. . .
sweet lil thing. . .

She just kinda came over and has been sleeping in my truck for a while. I'm
trying to keep my cat from attacking her.

I guess cuz I have one of those things where I get along well with animals,
she just figured that wherever I am is a cool place to hang. She follows me
everywhere, but I can't take her cuz I have a cupple pitts here already.
Otherwise hell yeah I would. She's either trained really really well or its
just me. . .

let me know asap if you can help
thanks

aK

 ODJ :.


Wassup peoples!  Dirtbox Radio got off to a late start this evening, as I
was out on a mission with the one like Joe Migraine to purchase top secret
VW parts.  Agent Sunshine is on teh decks currently, and Davey A and
myself will be goin on the late slot after him, 'round 11ish.  Big shout
to Joe for holdin down the pre-show show!

To link up, simply go to http://dirtboxradio.com/listen.html and hit up ze
links.  The webcam is currently flaking out on me, and 7 hours of car
travel has weakened my drive to give a flying fuck.  So, no staring at our
sexy asses this week :)

We'll have Freefall and Rogers on here again, so no worries there :)

Hope ya enjoy the rest of the show, and there will be some new archives up
this week!

Subject: [sfraves] thump radio tonight...on KUSF and on-line...

aloha all,

first off, happy new year to all of you from thump radio!  hope you had an 
amazing holiday and that your new years eve was as fun and whacked as mine.  
:)

tonight on the kusf show, thump radio presents the live set from PSYSEX when 
they performed for us back in 2003.  with live drums, this is a ripping set!

also, some new music from sir eel (a dubby-diggy side project), new hux 
flux, some beautiful etnoscope from sweden, a ripping set from DJ KRI, other 
new fun-ones, and a healthy dose of atmos and olli wisdom/spacetribe to get 
y'all in the mood for next saturday's thump when they both perform live at 
the DNA.

also, another edition of GOAgain (where we pull out a GOA classic and let 
'er rip)...with a rather obvious first choice...and you can call in and vote 
for more goa, or vote to move on to new freshie psytrance from the future... 
415.751.KUSF.

also, we'll be giving away tickets to (((THUMP))) with atmos and olli next 
weekend - listen for the time to call and then dial 751.KUSF...one 
line..always busy, keep trying.

90.3 FM KUSF 8p-12midnight, or on-line (streaming info at 
http://www.thumpradio.com/kusf903.cfm)

may the thump be with you.

greetings.

I'm a self-admitted trance head... from the bay area

but don't go to trance parties any more, because I can't stand most trance 
scene these day... with the commerical music that gets played, and e-tards 
crowding the main dance floor... fights, bad attitudes... people who can't 
handle their own substance.

If any one out there knows of any good event hit me up. Or else I guess I'll 
have to organize one myself.

Cheers,

NomadicSpirit

as a concerned raver, i think this means we need more outdoor parties so 
that when the quake hits, we don't have to duck and cover and worry about a

Here, here! I totally agree with you. I remember the last minor quake, a few
months ago, and I was outside, in the park, walking the dog. Didn't really
notice much except a slight sense of dizziness.

But when I got home, I heard the whole story from my roommate--he said it
felt like a truck hit the building.

Now imagine a huge one hitting, when people are crowded in a non-permitted
warehouse. That could be a real catastrophe, don't even want to think about
it.

Long live outdoor parties! They are great when the rainy season ends!

of a dilemma. I've wanted to go to a rave since I was in high school (I'm

hope now that I will just find one to go to. I've come to the realization 
that if I want it to happen, then I have to take matters into my own hands 
and plan it myself. Seeing as how I've never been to a rave, I thought that 
I would turn to all of you for advice.

My first problem is location. My friend tells me that he knows of a 
warehouse, and I know of a couple too, but I'm not sure if they would be 
ideal. The other option that I see at this time is a local art gallery. I 
know the owner, who's a rather eccentric gentleman, and he throws crazy 
parties all the time, but nothing quite up to rave caliber. Aside from me 
just knowing the owner, my friend is the events manager, so there's a very 
good chance that we would be able to use the space. It's not huge, but I'd 
rather that it be packed than have people huddled in the corner of a 
warehouse. There're also the obvious issues, if we use a warehouse, of 
heating and electricity. These things would be guaranteed if we used the 
gallery. It's a very well known place, though, so I'm not sure if it's a 
good idea. This is where I need the help: is it better to have it in an 
almost completely unknown place, or somewhere more promising but very well 
known??

My second problem is music. I know that there are a couple local djs who 
would be more than happy to spin for us, but I'm definitely a perfectionist 
and I'm not sure that they have the experience to live up to my standards. 
If I'm going to plan this I want it to be good. The other option is to find 
a dj from somewhere else and bring them here. This is unquestionably the 
more expensive option, but I think that it would probably be worth it in the 
long run.

Any kind of feedback would be awesome. I'm lost without it.

Thank you,
Ryan

My boys in NYC produce. One of them has some hot shit! He djs too. Opened

I do give some props to the SF scene, for sure. The L.A. scene seems
pretty wack, except for the women. Dancers here ain't shit either!

well, in the many years of partying, some of my most memorable parties were in either warehouses in the middle of bfe, or out in the woods.  and if you get a bunch of people going, once people start dancing, heat is not an issue.  ive spent all nights at parties out in the snow all night and been fine.  dancing produces a massive amount of body heat, and after an hour, the place will be warm.
 
as for the dj's, the final decision ends up coming down to the money you are willing to spend.  be aware that with dj's outside of the area you normally have to cover airfare, transportation from the airport, hotel plus dj costs...
 
and one more bit of advice, before throwing a party, you should really think about trying to find a couple to go to.  it is possible to throw em, but there are a ton of little things that you don't really think about unless you've experienced it.
 
hope this helps a bit ;)

What I find funny is the fact that the stats say a major quake will
happen in the next 28 years; sometime. It is like looking at a line of
28 people and saying 1 of you has hemorrhagic fever and we don't know
who or even better it is like the terror alerts. So does this put us at
an Orange Earthquake alert. Time to shit your pants for the 28 years and
when it never happens say "It was better to be safe than sorry" LOL=20

Jason=20

What this says to me is that too many whites are getting away with drug
use, too many whites are getting away with drug sales, too many whites
are getting away with trafficking in this stuff. The answer to this
disparity is not to start letting people out of jail because we're not
putting others in jail who are breaking the law. The answer is to go out
and find the ones who are getting away with it, convict them and send
them up the river, too."

- Rush Limbaugh. October 5, 1995 show transcript.

"Opinions are my own only, and do not necessarily represent those of
KZSU Radio or Stanford University." (or words to that effect.)

Subject: RE: [sfraves] frustrated rave planner

Hmmm.. you might think about throwing a house party. Not necessarily a 
'house music' party, but more like just a party in a house type thing.. I'd 
lose the word RAVE in your vocabulary altogether, the word comes with an 
incredible amount of fear to those that only know about it thru the media.

I'd definately include all the "rave" elements if you can.. DJs, a sound 
system of sorts, and maybe some sort of visual stimulation, nag champa.. 
lol. Just be different than your run-of-the-mill college kegger parties..

I'd start small and try to gain some experience with throwing parties and 
the things that potentially can happen. Then if you like what's going on, 
you can build.

just my two bits..

Subject: [sfraves] (Review) Anon Salon 

     A few weeks ago at Sticky I met a girl who told me about a band called
Sound Tribe Sector Nine (www.sts9.com) who would be headlining an Anon Salon
party on New Year's Eve called Sea of Dreams
(http://www.anonsalon.com/seaofdreams04/index.html) The party was fairly
expensive, but I was excited to go to a new place to hear new bands and djs,
and party with people who don't know me at all.
     To sum up this party, I can only say "Hello 2Day!!! OMG So Dope!!!" I
would describe my night as a magical, spiritual experience. I got my palms
read by a man who was missing several fingers. I met many, many people who
had traveled from far away for this party. I danced and danced and danced. I
spun my poi, and figured out several moves that had been eluding me. I
connected with many people who have their eyes open, such as the little girl
with the long red tail who helped me fetch water for a couple that was
rolling hard on the floor. I can remember one point when I was in the middle
of the dance floor, and I looked around me at all the shining, happy faces,
the lights, the colors, the hypnotic music that STS9 was creating, and
couldn't imagine life being any better. I resolved that this year I will
make more of an effort to seek out new crews, new parties, new scenes. It
was so easy for me last year to go to parties like Sticky where I knew at
least 1/3 of the people there, but I always have a blast when I leave my
friends behind, go exploring and make new friends.
     I would highly recommend checking out anything that Anon Salon or STS9
does, and I will be sure to post any info that I get.

Happy New Year everyone!

Happy  :-)

I went to STS9 a few months back with my gf. If there had been more people
there and more energy (LOL - yes I know it's a BIG stoner group) it would
have been really cool. Regardless I perched myself in the balcony to the
left of the stage so I could see what the group did on stage. They like
Reason a lot. Ran into Boomerang and Leslie there. My gf went to the NYE
party last year and has always said it was pretty amazing. If it was the
Avalon Ball Room again this year then the location is equally beautiful on
its own.

Do you get the feeling that a lot of us are just tired of our same circles
and the same people? Seems that a lot of people are going seperate ways and
looking for something new. The scene that a lot of us knew is gone and a lot
of the faces with its passing.

It was at the Avalon Ballroom and the adjacent Regency Center Ballrooms. And
yes, I have been tired of the same old thing. I realized on NYE that I don't
dance enough anymore, and the reason is that I haven't been going to places
that uplift me and make me move. I go to places where I know lots of people,
and have fun hanging out, but I don't spend much time in the middle of the
dance floor with my eyes closed, giving myself up to the music. There are so
many circles in this tiny Bay Area, and we are mostly unaware of each other,
but there are amazing people everywhere if you leap outside your comfort
zone and seek them out. And when you find something new that rejuvenates
your spirit, bring your friends with you that they might find that spark in
their lives again too!

Happy  :-)

Subject: [sfraves] Looking To Buy [DJ Keoki Records]

-------------------------------1073345841
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="US-ASCII"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

I have been having the most hardest time trying to buy DJ Keoki's music on 
Records, I have been up and down on many online record stores and still I find 
no luck with his music being online. 

Here is a list of online stores that I have checked so far. 

http://www.satelliterecords.com
www.virtualvinyl.com

-i need more online shops also i really am dyeing for keoki records-


I coming asking the people of SFraves for help. Hoping that someone might 
have his wax for sale or even know where I might be able to buy it at online. I 
trust online record buying more then going to a store just because the fact I 
know it will be in good shape :-) also I am willing to drive if you might of 
saw his music at a store. 

Well, thanks a lot.

Subject: [sfraves] post-New Year's Eve wrapup: Richard Humpty Vission & Planet NY

Hi, I've noticed a tendency on SF Raves for people to argue or debate about things at upcoming massives, but then the event passes without anybody mentioning a word. We were going on and on about whether Karl Bartos could represent himself as "Kraftwerk" at Cyberfest in July, but there was not one mention after the party that he didn't even appear at all! So, our debate was for naught. (I don't know why not, maybe the poor ticket sales led to Coolworld asking him not to come after all?)

We recently had a thread about whether Richard Humpty Vission was a worthy headliner for a New Year's Eve event. I remember he was not at the top of the lineup at Cyberfest a few years back in Fresno, so maybe Coolworld doesn't see him as a headliner, but perhaps lower anticipated ticket sales kept them from booking a bigger name (like Paul Van Dyk at Planet NY a year ago -- even though he played only 30 minutes!!!). 

Anyhow ... I thought Richard Humpty Vission was supposed to be on for the countdown, but he didn't arrive until much later, and there were a lot of equipment problems. I believe that St John was spinning during the countdown to midnight. There were people just marking time on stage, trying to rev up the audience, while he got set up. I'm not even sure if he spun at all, because I got restless and went to another room. 

So ... I don't think anybody really had a chance to see if he was a worthy headliner. hrmphh. 
I think the "coolworld sucks" mantra seems to be catching on, because each of their parties seems to attract fewer people than the one before. 
yeah i know, i should have gone to "Wish" or something else. Next year.

I felt much personal loss when the old school house community I loved 
pretty much disappeared in the last couple of years.  Come-Unity was an 
island of sanity and comfort for me each month and a place where I could 
see people I've known for ten years.  The Gathering is gone.  Wicked, it 
seems to me, is on its last beats as a collective.

Change is inevitable, however.  I've been around for a long time in the 
dance community and I've observed death and rebirth every five or so 
years.  Thus I've learned not to be too attached to any scene or genre, and 
really try to keep my mind open to the new and the flow of life.

If nothing would ever change we would all be bored as hell.  When change 
comes it may initially make us uncomfortable or sad.  People do 
leave.  Music changes.  But the underlying vibe, I think, has been pretty 
consistent over the years.  Dancers from each generation, I've found, are 
lovely people:)

It is a new year, and there are new people and energies in the 
community:  a time to meet new friends;  explore diverse dance scenes;  and 
fall in love with the community once again.

Love,

Apollo

Yes, and I think it's a constant thing: Those people six years in
or so will feel jaded and tired. The new batch of ravers seems
as enthusiastic as we did back then. Of course they're not as
*relevant* as they haven't yet made a zillion friends or bought
gear. But give them time... and they will be running the place
:).

well then, if you haven't gone out, i suggest that you do so

stagnated.  but there's always that little hole in the wall

Mmy guess is that the events just weren't good enough to merit any
rave reviews (*chuckle*). I could be wrong though.

Are you really that surprised? :)

I wouldn't say it was for naught. I hope enough people followed the
discussion long enough to make an informed decision about whether or not
to go based on the promoter's marketing practices. People that decided
not to might feel a lot better knowing that Bartos didn't even show.

Billing Karl Bartos as "Kraftwerk" was bad enough. That he didn't even
show should really make people think twice about going to massives
because of a single act. But where they lack in quality, I suppose those
events certainly excel in quantity...

Cheers,

They have damn near anything you can want...not just dance music either, 
rock, jazz, blues...whatever....and if you can't figure out how to use it, 
you're a 'tard.

SOMA Sessions 

Drum 'n Bass >> Fourth Fridays @ AsiaSF 

Friday January 23, 2004 

For the inaugural session we bring you, all the way
from Manchester UK, the sounds of: 
 
MARCUS INTALEX (Soul:r, MIST - UK) 
Marcus Intalex is known across the globe for his
infectious, smooth style of Drum 'n Bass. Only a few
years after his first production efforts in 1995 on
Flex and his own Intalex Productions imprint came
anthems such as "How You Make Me Feel," "Love &
Happiness" and "Universe," which firmly positioned
Marcus as one of the world's top D&B personalities.
Today, Marcus and longtime studio partner, S.T. Files
continue to blaze trails as M.I.S.T. with their wildly
popular Soul:r label. With over a decade of experience
on the decks, SOMA Sessions is proud to welcome back
to San Francisco one of the UK's most in-demand Drum
'n Bass DJs. 

METHOD ONE (Cov.Ops, method-one.com) 
By 1994 Method One was both an acclaimed DJ and and
experienced rave promoter in Philly. By 1996 he was
also an established producer. Recording with partner
Kaos as Atlantiq, Method One signed tunes to labels
like Good Looking and True Intent while holding down
DJ residencies at Konkrete Jungle and Dieselboy's
Platinum. Since relocating to the Bay, Jason continues
to wreck dancefloors with his diverse DJ sets and
release top-shelf tunes on labels such as ASC's Covert
Operations.

I always have a different word on my cell phone,
reminding me what kind of "mood" I am in.  No more
than three weeks ago the word for at least six weeks
or so was, "diversify."  I think if we all try this a
litle more often,we would be amazed at how much more
variety life has to offer us than we give it credit
for.  Stepping onto different dancefloors hasn't been
easy; but, I am certainly glad that I have, and will
continue to do so until my botty can shake no more.

Love,
Karyna

Just in case you're wondering the new word is
"Evolve."

--part1_89.c60983.2d2c9b63_boundary
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="US-ASCII"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

U know I have to admit, when i first got the flier to this party i had a bit 
of that... *rolls eyes* feeling. like o my god matrix revelry oookkkk because 
i remember sugesting to someone who was planing a party to make it matrix but 
then we decided it was too cliche and people wouldn't like it. because a lot 
of people didn't like the last two movies and what not. Anyhoo, out of a string 
of bizare coincidences my friends and i (including Osby!) ended up attending 
this party. & of course we showed up in costume and got in for $10, there's no 
way were gonna pay $20 for that bush and van ness venue. so we show up at the 
party, & low & behold... it actually kicked ass. The decorations were bad 
ass, they had a projector in one chill room playing all the matrix movies with 
sound and everything, i enjoyed that. In another room all of the walls were 
compleately decked up in matrix code, which was just awsome. and all the other 
rooms were just all black and with everyone in costume and what not they managed 
to give a matrix feel all night long. I'm not big into DJ's per se, i just 
like good music so i couldn't tell you who's sets were good that night but i do 
remember Tamim's set was off the hook. and it was impressive to see micheal lui 
once again. I have to mention that none of us ingested a single drug and we 
had a blast, we even went to an after party in emeryville and met a lots of 
cool people. I'm taking this party as a sign that the scene is back in effect. 
Granted, yes people do not as often come up and give you hugs and let u play 
with their lil fuzzy toys while they express how much they love you. Granted yes 
you may catch a few mean mugs from some thugs or get bumbed into by a group of 
rambunctious pre-teens while you're trying to dance, but all & all the music 
is still good, it's still fun to dance, still meeting lots of cool people & 
we're still on the edge of something very different than what everyone else does 
on their fri-sat nights. i'm proud of all the old school heads i keep running 
into since the 90's, all the people who just keep going, who've endured 
through all the talk of "the scene is dying/dead" and what not. Anyways... not to 
keep ranting, this is just my review for the party. Good job guys... whoever 
threw this party i already forgot their crew's name, elektro... something er 
other, u know who u r. 
     moral of the story is don't doubt a party that seems "cliche" at first 
because it just might actually kick ass in the end. - Jaze

Don't tell anyone, but I was there.

I was pleasantly surprised. I've been to a few parties at that venue, and
I'm more than willing to say J outdid himself this time. Good signs
for 2004, right?

Also: do any of you realize how *fun* it is to leap/cavort/dance about in
a big overcoat? I highly recommend it.

Peas,

if you haven't already, be sure to get "KeokiClash" on CD - it's just
brilliant!

best mix-CD that came out in 2003, imho.  :)

his CD that came out in december, "Kill the DJ," is dope, too.  how often
do you get to hear the ramones on a mix-cd?  =)

awesome story, AUDiOTACTiX!  LOL!  hilarious.  :)

respect,
mary :)

I have been having the most hardest time trying to buy DJ Keoki's music on
Records, I have been up and down on many online record stores and still I
find
no luck with his music being online.

Here is a list of online stores that I have checked so far.

http://www.satelliterecords.com
www.virtualvinyl.com

-i need more online shops also i really am dyeing for keoki records-


I coming asking the people of SFraves for help. Hoping that someone might
have his wax for sale or even know where I might be able to buy it at
online. I
trust online record buying more then going to a store just because the fact
I
know it will be in good shape :-) also I am willing to drive if you might
of
saw his music at a store.

Well, thanks a lot.

seconds.

Its the internet, learn to use it!

on that note, I heard a funny story years ago and this is the palce to see
if anyone knows it to be true...

Back in the day, there was a party in Golden Gate Park, djs and what not.
At this party there was a guy walking around with a selling mix tapes out
of a cardboard box, he is approached by someone asking if he had any Keoki
mix tapes, the guy selling the mix tapes says "No, Keokis ego is too big
for my little box" the guy yells at the person selling tapes "IM KEOKI!"
and aparently it was.

Bwahahaha, so has anyone else ever heard that? I love it!

They have damn near anything you can want...not just dance music either,
rock, jazz, blues...whatever....and if you can't figure out how to use it,
you're a 'tard.

Subject: RE: [sfraves] Matrix Revelry Review

I had more fun at that party than I've had out in a long time... the decor
and the abundance of costumes really did it for me.  I was a bit hesitant
to wear my suit to a rave, but it emerged unscathed... smells like smoke
now, but no rips or stains.  =P

C.

PS - Thanks to all those pictures of me scowling like Smith, I now realize
I have to (1) stop smoking, (2) drink less coffee, and (3) get some of
that tooth-whitening stuff.  LOL

Subject: [sfraves] cell phone stroke

Basically my cell phone had a stroke and I lost a bunch of phone numbers and 
other important information. I just got a new phone but I don't have all the 
info from the previous one, so if I had your number/information, or if I am 
supposed to have your number/information, pm or email me so I can program it 
into the new device.

-Joey

PS, camera phones rock (my new phone is a big pimpin' camera phone).

--=====================_18177628==.ALT
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"; format=flowed

It's refreshing to see party reviews on this list again:)  Party on 
dancers...good for the body and the soul!!!

Those of you into old school hip hop and electro funk -- Afrika Bambaataa 
will be at Club 6 on Saturday.  Already bought my tickets.

  Afrika Bambaataa is one of the three main originators of break-beat 
deejaying, and is respectfully known as the "Grandfather" and "Godfather" 
of Hip Hop Culture as well as The Father of The Electro Funk Sound. Through 
his co-opting of the street gang the Black Spades into the music and 
culture-oriented Zulu Nation, he is responsible for spreading rap and 
hip-hop culture throughout the world. He has consistently made records 
nationally and internationally, every one to two years, spanning the 1980's 
into the next Millennium 2000.

Due to his early use of drum machines and computer sounds, Bam (as he is 
affectionately known) was instrumental in changing the way R&B and other 
forms of Black music were recorded. His creation of Electro Funk, beginning 
with his piece "Planet Rock," helped fuel the development of other musical 
genres such as Freestyle or Latin Freestyle, Miami Bass,Electronica, House, 
Hip House, and early Techno.

See you on the dance floor.

Love,

Apollo

i saw bam play @ the DNA a couple of years back...  he's a surprisingly
good DJ, though when the tried turntable tricks he tried were a little out
of his league at the time.

but this sounds like a show definitely worth seeing!

Hmmm, very interesting. Now, the truth about me.

I fully acknowledge that I am a "backslider," immersed in the counterfeit
music, because I am a preacher's kid gone wild!

I'm not usually one to pitch a fit.......but.......I don't think I have ever been so disturbed....insulted....and all around offended by the thoughts and beliefs of another human being in all my life.  To be told that I am "walking in Satan's path" just because I listen to music and appreciate an art that doesn't "praise the lord" is GOD DAMN recockulous.(<-----Like my new word)  What kind of fucking religious freak could fathom the idea that art is evil, based on the fact that it is not saying "Amen......Thank you Jesus" at the end of every measure.  Now, I don't practice "mainstream" religion......I don't go to church, nor have I ever read the Bible......but this crock makes me ashamed to have  even been baptized Roman Catholic............HOLY SHIT.......(thats all I have to say about that)
RAVER 4 EVER........LET THE BEATS PLAY ON!!!!!!!!!!!!

Subject: [sfraves] *bsp* forever young!

about a month ago i breathed word about an 80's party.
 mark you calendars for 01/31/04 cuz it's going down! 
your chauffeurs into the den of swank, hair product
decadence, and voracious fashion statements will be:

sticky (ambient mafia, sf)
DJ R (bz, stargaze, sf)
naru (stargaze, SR, la)
shazbot (moksha tribe, newstylesound, sf)
drop (bz, ambient mafia, sf)
dj aryn (aec, viberation, sf)
indigo (ambient mafia, sf)
dj bam (invibe.com, sf)

upon arriving, we'll escort the willing to a photo
setup where the lovely araya will capture that
auspicious, sappy moment before your makeup runs and
there's nothing left of your dignity.  there will be
punch (i highly recommend you try some) & trashy
snacks, but remember this is a BYOB affair if you need
*more* than that.  as a reminder - dress the f*ck up! 
it's fun, easy, relatively cheap, and you won't be
alone ;)  you can recreate this party to be the prom
you never went to because chad, the page-haired poet
who led debate class, didn't ask you to go, or this
can be the moment where you cry up to the 80's gods
'damn i look fine in my stone-washed hammer pants and
screw you all if you who made fun of me when i sang
along to NKOTB's 'step by step'.  ah, the
possibilities are endless :)

this event is going on for 3 reasons.  i f*cking love
the 80's (troll away), any excuse to get everyone
under one roof and have a good time is a damn fine
reason for getting out of the house, but most
importantly, we're raising money to help the epiphane
crew pay off the fine they received at their last
event.  tickets are only $5 which can be purchased via
paypal on the evite i'm sending out;  donations are
definitely encouraged if you'd like to pitch in more. 
i've already gotten some email addresses, but if you'd
like to go, email me privately so i can add you to the
roster.  this venue is limited to 150 capacity so get
on this now before we fill up!

happy new year to everyone, here's hoping you
recovered nicely ;)

something  i noticed when i did inspection of the berkeley area and 
dropped by primal records was that the selection of records, the number 
of flyers on the table, and the number of non-dj people have all 
decreased.  you can really tell.  now it seems like they're doing ok as 
a record store, at least i hope, and from their website it seems so, 
but that's my way of seeing that the scene has really shrunk.

but maybe that's a good thing!  for one thing, osby won't have so many 
irresponsible raver citations to write!

Hi Jeff,

An-ten-nae throws an excellent breaks party periodically at 550 
Barneveld.  I hear they are doing these quarterly, but who knows.  "Get 
Freaky," as the event is called, has been a big success.  As for 
progressive house, wait for a Jack Triumph announcement:)

Info at www.an-ten-nae.net

Love,

Apollo

*wets pants*

The 1st time I saw Bam was back in '99 @ Buzz in DC. He fucking destroyed 
the place, and had little white ravers' jaws-a-droppin' left and right. No 
one else can drop electro, hip-hop, funk, go-go and whatever else he wants 
with such skill. Not technically the best dj, but he rocks the party...my 
ass is gonna try and get out there and catch the electrofunk king!!!

Subject: [sfraves] .: Tons of New DNB Mixsets from Dirtbox Radio :.


Yeah, so I've been slackin recently and not posting up new mixes.  Below
are listed all of the new mixes available on Dirtbox Radio since 12/07.
Checkem out, as well as many others, at dirtboxradio.com/archives.html.
At the peoples' request, I've been leaving the sets as one big file, so
you don't have to download like five million files to hear a whole set.
You'll have to cut 'em up to burn them on CD, but it's pretty easy :)

Happy Hello!
     I hope that everyone had a happy New Year. 
 
This week on Daytrippin' we join our resident DJ's Buckner and Sean Davis as we welcome:
 
Villo of Balance Record Pool, Fade Records, and ProtonRadio.com
 
Please Read his Bio below as taken from www.ProtonRadio.com
 
Villo-  Villo's first professional steps in the music world are traced back to the summer of 1988, when in company of two junior high school buddies began mixing tapes, DJing for his own classmates and eventually the majority of high school party needs for the greater metro area of Puebla City, Mexico. The earliest events Villo did were sweet 16 birthday celebrations and private parties, quickly progressing to a few Teachers' weddings and larger music venues. 

By 1992, he had built a strong reputation and in April got his first residency inaugurating Club Rokola, in the neighboring state of Guerrero. The next club to have Villo was Freeday in Puebla City, where with Miguel Campos he started playing a daily residency in the early summer of 1993. At the same time Villo also started a vinyl-only record selling company with Ger Disco's Sergio Gutierrez. By the end of the year, Villo and Miguel where also playing in D'Paradise on the weekends and for PROZOUND, their own company. Raising the service and musical quality in a town renowned for it's nightlife proved smart, soon the two were performing frequently and for crowds of up to 5000. In 1995 Villo began putting together and DJing Puebla's very first underground parties. Villo also started a residency in Club Oxigeno, the first trance/techno Club in Cholula, with guests like DJ Klang and Tini tun. 1995 was the dawn of his famed New Year's parties. 

In 1996, he made his ELECTRONLY Thursdays parties happen at Puebla's Nazty Club. It was this year that he met Freddy Ramirez, a veteran DJ and producer who was creating PROmueve, the top DJ pool in Mexico. January 1997 had Villo in Mexico City to DJ as opening/closing act for Los Druidas, as well as in the Mexican college circuit. That June he started a residency at club Indalo in Cholula; by the end of summer Villo had started Mundo Submarino, a monthly party with various venues throughout Puebla. By 1998 Villo was DJing out of state more often while playing the intense college circuit in Cholula, and Mexico City. In 1999 he kicked off the new Kiffi Cafe and continued the Thursday alternative night with sets over 8 hrs with a musical range that went through house, ambient, jungle, progressive and hip hop beats. By the summer he was doing Fridays at the Casis Club in Puebla, and gearing up for fall, he DJed as opening act for Latin pop star Aleks Syntek on the Liquid Moon National
 Tour. This year also marked the official debut of his music productions, and he released an album with six tracks under his Purple Star label. He also worked alongside Freddy Ramirez to bring DJDance'99 in November, the first dance music event in Mexico for the industry's professionals, held in Acapulco, Guerrero. New Year's 2000 event lasted three days and Villo played a special 12-hour set from 10pm to 10am. 

In early 2000 Villo moved to Orlando, where he became part of the Balance Promote Group alongside Chris Fortier and Jimmy van M, and started playing the US club circuit while taking care of the day-to-day business at the Balance Record Pool. In 2001 he launched his label, PurpleStar Records in the US, with some of his productions already being played by many of his peers and held a monthly residence at Orland's premiere club 'The Groove', where he shared the decks with DJs such as Parks and Wilson, Noel Sanger and Dave Cannalte. In 2002 his song 'Monopo' (Stereounderground) was played extensively by Jimmy Van M in the Delta Heavy national tour with Sasha and Digweed, and was selected to be in the worldwide famous Import Club (May02) series from PromoOnly ; it was bought by EMI later that year. Villo along with studio partners Beaumont Stanford and Jeffrey Organes (the trio goes by the moniker Stereounderground) completed their first full length album, Human Codition; which has been
 very well received by DJs and producers alike. November 2002 saw the launch of The Balance Record Pool Show, every Friday 6-8pm EST in NYC's www.protonradio.com where people all over the world have a chance to listen. 

2003 has been a year full of excitement so far; with a handful of remixes, Villo's sound is going further. Stereounderground's remix of Sasha's album track 'Boileroom' has been played all over the world and all the major festivals by DJs like Hernan Cattaneo, blowing up dancefloors. Villo is also part of the www.floridahousemusic.com crew, and has started a new show Saturday nights on Proton called 'L8 Night Mix', with crime and production partner Dave 'Atnarko' Ross. Their remix work on Teknology is just a taste of things to come, with other remixes already lined up for the end of the year. This summer John Digweed asked Villo for an exclusive mix for his KISS 100 weekly show, and the mix was broadcast on July 11th. Production and DJ wise, this has been a year full of new sounds, a glimpse of what's to come yet. Playing for a decade and a half, clubs, afterhours-parties and exotic exterior locations his trademark deep uplifting music, anytime and anywhere you listen to Villo on the
 decks, is guaranteed to be a memorable one.

Subject: [sfraves] SRR...love parade, the parade of love

happy new years to everybody!  i'm here in michigan
where it's now in the negative degrees with about a
foot of snow on the ground...brrrrr...

so, anyway...i might be in europe this summer and want
to possibly check out love parade, or any other edm
type events.  i went to the detroit electronic music
festival last year, and it was great, but i'm probably
going to have to miss it if i'm abroad.  hopefully, i
can make up for it with an equally cool european
experience...

but, i have some questions.

first of all, i can't find any site that actually says
when love parade happens.  anyone have some info about
this?  i have gathered the first of july from
www.loveparade.de and my minimal knowledge of german. 
but it wasn't very clear.

second of all, has anyone been to love parade?  is it
worth it?  has anyone been to any other european
events that i should check out?  also, are there any
clubs in london, glasgow, edinburgh, leipzig, berlin,
barcelona that are good to go to?

finally, is anyone planning on going abroad this
summer?  i'm going alone (most likely) and would love
to meet up and go partying with someone.

ok, so, thanks a bunch!

"Security is mostly a superstition.  It does not exist in nature, nor do 
the children of humans as a whole experience it.  Avoiding danger is no 
safer in the long run than outright exposure.  Life is either a daring 
adventure or nothing."
-Helen Keller

Subject: Re: [sfraves] post-New Year's Eve wrapup: Richard Humpty Vission & Planet NY

 > We recently had a thread about whether Richard Humpty Vission

Actually, I like RHV a lot.  Last time I saw him spin, I had a really 
good time, and enjoyed his set a lot.  And I wouldn't been disappointed 
at all if he were the headliner for a NYE party I had gone to.  Thing 
is tho.... last time I saw RHV play, I saw him for $15 (presale, I 
dunno the door price).  For $15, RHV is an awesome headliner.  He'd be 
kickass.... worth every penny.  I loved to see him spin before.  I'd 
love to see him spin again.

But I'm not going to pay coolworld prices for someone I can see 
elsewhere for $15.

And that's assuming that I trusted and respected coolworld enough to go 
to their parties, which I don't.  But there's no need to get into that 
again.

And aside from RHV, the only DJs I would have had much intrest in 
seeing were local to the bay area.  And I can see them at many other 
parties, which: are much smaller, priced with a recognition that the 
dotcom boom is over, have a friendlier and more intimate 
atmosphere/vibe, are thrown by local promoters instead of a 
corporation, treat their patrons with the respect and dignity we 
deserve, and actually go on ALL NIGHT ('Cuz going home at 2am, 
ESPECIALLY on New Years Eve, is just fuken lame.).


cya,
john

Religion has no place in raves.

The raves are cool because you can be religious or non-religious and still
have fun.

 I believe whoever wrote this has probably never been to a rave and is
curled up in a corner hiding behind a bible like it's some sort of shield.

Notice how it says "Pictures from a rave" and not "Pictures from a rave tha=
t
I or we have been to."

Ravers tend to accept anyone, regardless of age, race, or socioeconomic
background. (Oh shit say it aint so Billy say it ain't so!!!)=A0 This
acceptance is good.(Oh good! I was worried for as sec.) =A0 However, many
young people seeking acceptance are drawn into the Rave and end up in using
drugs, (Uh-o, people being individulaies, thinking for themselves and being
responsible for the own actions....Oh shit what is this world coming to!!!)
=A0 associating with those who use drugs, and / or getting involved in
spirituality that is demonic. (Thinking for one's self, yeah I'd say that's
at the top of my list of demonic things.)

"They believe"  (Golly gee! It sounds like I'm part of a cult.  I'm scared
please hold me.)

Under the guise of Peace and Love, the devil is using music and drugs to
deceive masses of young people just as he did in the 60's and 70's.  (I
think somebody needs a hug.)

The power propelling the Rave movement is the music. (Man, those silent
raves really blow chunks!)

All the angels and lucifer sang and shouted together for joy when God set i=
n
motion the laying of the earth's foundation. (Cool!)=A0 But regardless,
singing / music in praise to God was the chief occupation of lucifer prior
to his fall.=A0 Never forget that. (Forget what?)=A0 That's the chief occupatio=
n
of all the angels. (Ravers um my bad I mean demonic dancers dance and sing
to celebrate God, life, or whatever they want.  Gee that's just horrible!)

The Bible reveals very clearly that music is a creation of God for the
purpose of praise to God.  (Yawn...BORING!!!!!  Music was created has a
means of expression and not just for brown nosing to God.)

The biblical evidence is clear.=A0 Music was created by God for the purpose o=
f
the worship of the One (suck up!), the True (suck up!), and the Almighty
(suck up!) ( Worthy (suck up!) God (Suck up! suck up! suck up! suck up!)

Um question:  If  I worshiped myself than that would mean I was worshiping
Satan and if I'm worshiping Satan than I'm not worshiping myself.  Sence I'=
m
not worshiping myself therefor I'm not worshiping Satan, correct?

RAVES ARE FILLED WITH SPIRITUAL MUSIC LEADING MASSES IN WORSHIP...BUT IN
WORSHIP TO WHOM? (Well me of course.)

Be honest, when you're listening to music or singing, when you are done wit=
h
it, will there be any inspiration to turn to God...to worship God...to turn
to His Word. (Life is my bible and music notes are my words.)

Satan and the fallen angels now inspire music in many different styles as
they seek to divert worship from God. (If you go to Samgoody they have many
selection and each one called "Popular".   Life would be so boring with onl=
y
one type of music.  What if the one song was that Jack in the box tune when
you crank the handle.  How would you like to hear that for the rest of your
life?)

There is music for every group, every age, every taste, and every culture.
(Thank you Satan.)

(I wonder if these people even listen to music.  Do they plug their ears
when birds sing?)

Mood-altering drugs are one of the main attraction in=A0the Rave scene. The
so-called "club drug" most commonly associated with Raves is
Methylenedioxymethamphetamine, or MDMA, commonly called:=A0 Ecstasy.=A0 It is a
synthetic drug created that temporarily alters the mood and mind but may
permanently damage the brain.  (Reading too much of this crap can also ruin
ones brain, so what your point?)

Is their a danger?
Rave parties involve many dangers that promoters would like to keep
undisclosed.=A0 Because of the easy availability of illegal drugs, it is not
uncommon to hear of validated cases of:=A0
=A0   =20
*    Drug overdose
*    Dehydration
*    Heat exhaustion
*    Heat Stroke
*    Brain damage
*    Depression
*    DUI=20
*    Death

    =A0(IF you don't know how to take care of yourself than don't go to
raves.)=20

The wages of sin is death -- Romans 6:23 (Does that mean if I don't sin I
wont die?  I wish I was told that sooner.) :`-(

 I remember many times that I gave or sold someone some ecstasy to "share
the love."=A0 The reality is that I was sharing a substance that destroys the
mind of those who consume it.=A0 Is that love?  (Yes, yes it is and what they
do with it is up to them.)

The Bilble say: Do not love the world nor the things in the world.  (Love
the world and the things in it.)
IF anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him. (Why is Go=
d
a male and not a female, or a (hermaphrodite?  If God created the Earth tha=
n
why is it wrong to love something which was created?)
For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh and lust of the eyes an=
d
the boastful pride of the life, is not from the Father, but is from the
world. (I have a lust for life.  To be saved should I stand in one place
with my eyes closed for the rest my life?)
The world is passing away, and also its lusts; but the one who does the wil=
l
of God lives forever.  (The will of God, that's another way of saying
servant to God.  I'm not God's slave.)

Are Raves Spiritual?
(Quote:) "Many young people who have no previous interest or awareness of
spirituality start to develop an interest in religious matters after
attending a few raves."=A0=A0 WHY?=A0 Because Raves are a spiritual movement !!
(Wait hold on a sec.....does that mean raves are good or bad? I'm confused.=
)

People coupling drugs with music experience trance states at parties that
often will lead to an interest in spirituality. -- THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED TO
ME PERSONALLY.=A0 I stumbled onto spirituality after attending Raves. (Is thi=
s
person sarcastically promoting raves, or putting them down? Is spirituality
evil or good?)

At a rave, the DJ is a shaman, a priest, a channeller of energy- they
control the psychic voyages of the dancers through his choice in
hard-to-find music and their skill in manipulating that music, sometimes
working with just a set of beats and samples, into a tapestry of mind
bending music. A large part of the concept of raves is built upon sensory
overload - a barrage of audio and very often visual stimuli are brought
together to elevate people into an altered state of physical or
psychological existence."
(That's lovely.)

What's wrong with spirituality?
The problem with the "New Age" spirituality in the Rave movement is that it
is the work of satan ( the devil ).
(If you stumbled onto spirituality at raves then that means you worship
Satan and you are a hypocrite.)

THE SPIRITUALITY=A0 FOUND=A0 IN=A0 THE=A0 RAVE SCENE IS DEMONIC=A0 AND=A0 ALL THOSE=A0
WHO=A0 DO NOT REPENT=A0 AND=A0 PUT=A0 THEIR=A0 FAITH=A0 IN=A0 THE ONE=A0 TRUE=A0 AND=A0 LIVING=A0
GOD,=A0 WHO CREATED=A0 THE=A0 HEAVENS=A0 AND=A0 THE=A0 EARTH,=A0 ARE=A0 IN=A0 IMMINENT=A0
DANGER=A0 OF=A0 BEING ETERNALLY=A0 SEPARATED FROM GOD --=A0 IN=A0 HELL  (At least we
will go out dancing and enjoying the pleasures of life while you hide behin=
d
words that are not your own and let life pass you by.)

I became involved in "New Age" mysticism / religion.=A0 Little did I know at
the time, it was all demonic!!
(*evil laughter* Woohahahaoooohaahaha!!!!! We fooled you good!)

Salvation
When I was 25,=A0 the true God of the Universe, the Lord Jesus Christ,
intervened in my life.=A0 He showed me the reality that the New Age Religion
is a religion based on false gods.  (Just how did he show you those things?=
)

This website is funny because it reminds me of a heated debate i once had 
with a friend of mine who is a hardcore christian. See i always felt very 
strongly that the rave scene was this gathering of masses, in tribal spirit, the 
essense the vibe the spirituality all accumilating growing growing growing 
throughout the populance of the world, which could eventually have potential to 
overthrow the establishment and create a new utopian world (new age of aquarious 
type of deal) most ravers tho would argue that raves are supposed to be 
underground and they're supposed to take u away from the worlds proplems not fight 
against them as   a "movement". Anyways when i brought this idea up to my friend 
(the christian) he was disgusted by it. the thought of raves accumilating 
massively throughout the world, because to him, this was discribed in the bible 
like in revelations or what not. it was said that nations would unite under a 
false prophecy, and this would be a sign of the anti-christ. the drugs the 
orgies the false sense of utopia, we were supposedly warned of all of this and 
we're supposed to know it means the end is near. me i don't buy it, it sure as 
hell interests me because it's so intense, i'd like to study it more or have some 
of ya'll sfr's enlighten me if u have knowledge on this topic.... but if i 
were inclined to believe anything as of now, i'd say that christ was manifested 
in the spirit of raving because it's like setting people free. to say that god 
was disgusted by raves, sounds like a hidden agenda to me...

Religion has no place in raves.

The raves are cool because you can be religious or non-religious and still
have fun.

 I believe whoever wrote this has probably never been to a rave and is
curled up in a corner hiding behind a bible like it's some sort of shield.

Notice how it says "Pictures from a rave" and not "Pictures from a rave tha=
t
I or we have been to."

Ravers tend to accept anyone, regardless of age, race, or socioeconomic
background. (Oh shit say it aint so Billy say it ain't so!!!)=A0 This
acceptance is good.(Oh good! I was worried for as sec.) =A0 However, many
young people seeking acceptance are drawn into the Rave and end up in using
drugs, (Uh-o, people being individulaies, thinking for themselves and being
responsible for the own actions....Oh shit what is this world coming to!!!)
=A0 associating with those who use drugs, and / or getting involved in
spirituality that is demonic. (Thinking for one's self, yeah I'd say that's
at the top of my list of demonic things.)

"They believe"  (Golly gee! It sounds like I'm part of a cult.  I'm scared
please hold me.)

Under the guise of Peace and Love, the devil is using music and drugs to
deceive masses of young people just as he did in the 60's and 70's.  (I
think somebody needs a hug.)

The power propelling the Rave movement is the music. (Man, those silent
raves really blow chunks!)

All the angels and lucifer sang and shouted together for joy when God set i=
n
motion the laying of the earth's foundation. (Cool!)=A0 But regardless,
singing / music in praise to God was the chief occupation of lucifer prior
to his fall.=A0 Never forget that. (Forget what?)=A0 That's the chief occupatio=
n
of all the angels. (Ravers um my bad I mean demonic dancers dance and sing
to celebrate God, life, or whatever they want.  Gee that's just horrible!)

The Bible reveals very clearly that music is a creation of God for the
purpose of praise to God.  (Yawn...BORING!!!!!  Music was created has a
means of expression and not just for brown nosing to God.)

The biblical evidence is clear.=A0 Music was created by God for the purpose o=
f
the worship of the One (suck up!), the True (suck up!), and the Almighty
(suck up!) ( Worthy (suck up!) God (Suck up! suck up! suck up! suck up!)

Um question:  If  I worshiped myself than that would mean I was worshiping
Satan and if I'm worshiping Satan than I'm not worshiping myself.  Sence I'=
m
not worshiping myself therefor I'm not worshiping Satan, correct?

RAVES ARE FILLED WITH SPIRITUAL MUSIC LEADING MASSES IN WORSHIP...BUT IN
WORSHIP TO WHOM? (Well me of course.)

Be honest, when you're listening to music or singing, when you are done wit=
h
it, will there be any inspiration to turn to God...to worship God...to turn
to His Word. (Life is my bible and music notes are my words.)

Satan and the fallen angels now inspire music in many different styles as
they seek to divert worship from God. (If you go to Samgoody they have many
selection and each one called "Popular".   Life would be so boring with onl=
y
one type of music.  What if the one song was that Jack in the box tune when
you crank the handle.  How would you like to hear that for the rest of your
life?)

There is music for every group, every age, every taste, and every culture.
(Should I thank God for kicking Satan out of heavean, or should I thank
Satan for creating the
different styles of music?  Oh wo is me, I'm so confused!)
(I wonder if these people even listen to music.  Do they plug their ears
when birds sing?)

Mood-altering drugs are one of the main attraction in=A0the Rave scene. The
so-called "club drug" most commonly associated with Raves is
Methylenedioxymethamphetamine, or MDMA, commonly called:=A0 Ecstasy.=A0 It is a
synthetic drug created that temporarily alters the mood and mind but may
permanently damage the brain.  (Reading too much of this crap can also ruin
ones brain, so what your point?)

Is their a danger?
Rave parties involve many dangers that promoters would like to keep
undisclosed.=A0 Because of the easy availability of illegal drugs, it is not
uncommon to hear of validated cases of:=A0
=A0   =20
*    Drug overdose
*    Dehydration
*    Heat exhaustion
*    Heat Stroke
*    Brain damage
*    Depression
*    DUI=20
*    Death

    =A0(IF you don't know how to take care of yourself than don't go to
raves.)=20

The wages of sin is death -- Romans 6:23 (Does that mean if I don't sin I
wont die?  I wish I was told that sooner.) :`-(

 I remember many times that I gave or sold someone some ecstasy to "share
the love."=A0 The reality is that I was sharing a substance that destroys the
mind of those who consume it.=A0 Is that love?  (Yes, yes it is and what they
do with it is up to them.)

The Bilble say: Do not love the world nor the things in the world.  (Love
the world and the things in it.)
IF anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him. (Why is Go=
d
a male and not a female, or a (hermaphrodite?  If God created the Earth tha=
n
why is it wrong to love something which was created?)
For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh and lust of the eyes an=
d
the boastful pride of the life, is not from the Father, but is from the
world. (I have a lust for life.  To be saved should I stand in one place
with my eyes closed for the rest my life?)
The world is passing away, and also its lusts; but the one who does the wil=
l
of God lives forever.  (The will of God, that's another way of saying
servant to God.  I'm not God's slave.)

Are Raves Spiritual?
(Quote:) "Many young people who have no previous interest or awareness of
spirituality start to develop an interest in religious matters after
attending a few raves."=A0=A0 WHY?=A0 Because Raves are a spiritual movement !!
(Wait hold on a sec.....does that mean raves are good or bad? I'm confused.=
)

People coupling drugs with music experience trance states at parties that
often will lead to an interest in spirituality. -- THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED TO
ME PERSONALLY.=A0 I stumbled onto spirituality after attending Raves. (Is thi=
s
person sarcastically promoting raves, or putting them down? Is spirituality
evil or good?)

At a rave, the DJ is a shaman, a priest, a channeller of energy- they
control the psychic voyages of the dancers through his choice in
hard-to-find music and their skill in manipulating that music, sometimes
working with just a set of beats and samples, into a tapestry of mind
bending music. A large part of the concept of raves is built upon sensory
overload - a barrage of audio and very often visual stimuli are brought
together to elevate people into an altered state of physical or
psychological existence."
(That's lovely.)

What's wrong with spirituality?
The problem with the "New Age" spirituality in the Rave movement is that it
is the work of satan ( the devil ).
(If you stumbled onto spirituality at raves then that means you worship
Satan and you are a hypocrite.)

THE SPIRITUALITY=A0 FOUND=A0 IN=A0 THE=A0 RAVE SCENE IS DEMONIC=A0 AND=A0 ALL THOSE=A0
WHO=A0 DO NOT REPENT=A0 AND=A0 PUT=A0 THEIR=A0 FAITH=A0 IN=A0 THE ONE=A0 TRUE=A0 AND=A0 LIVING=A0
GOD,=A0 WHO CREATED=A0 THE=A0 HEAVENS=A0 AND=A0 THE=A0 EARTH,=A0 ARE=A0 IN=A0 IMMINENT=A0
DANGER=A0 OF=A0 BEING ETERNALLY=A0 SEPARATED FROM GOD --=A0 IN=A0 HELL  (At least we
will go out dancing and enjoying the pleasures of life while you hide behin=
d
words that are not your own and let life pass you by.)

I became involved in "New Age" mysticism / religion.=A0 Little did I know at
the time, it was all demonic!!
(*evil laughter* Woohahahaoooohaahaha!!!!! We fooled you good!)

Salvation
When I was 25,=A0 the true God of the Universe, the Lord Jesus Christ,
intervened in my life.=A0 He showed me the reality that the New Age Religion
is a religion based on false gods.  (Just how did he show you those things?=
)

I mean... it wasn't as packed as that venue usually gets & I think that's what I enjoyed... it was like good size crowd, Groovy energy... met some Awesome people that night & ran in2 a few people I ain't seen in a while!!  WHAT UP TRHATTER! =)  LoL... it was hella funny 'cause like there were a few people there that said, "Osby, What are You doing here?" Hello 2Day... I was there 2 dance! =) =P

OK.. there were like mondo DJs spinning that night... but my fave sets were Michael Lui... he spun this Bad ass set like ya know... he 1st started spinning BreakBeats!!  OK... YUMMMMM!!!  LoL.. .it was actually funny 'cause I went behind the tables & picked up his head phones 'cause I wanted 2 mix the 1st record of his set... but like i soooooo didn't know where the head phone switcher thingie was on the mixer, but her, i gotta pick the 1st record though!!  It was Dope... 'cause he kept the Break beats goin on 4 a long time then ofcourse he slooooooowly went in2 his Psytrance stuff... it was a fun set!!

Ummm... Peter-Go-Zania & Leon Cook played this Groovy set... OK... from what I remember... there started out spinning a lil' Jungle @ the begining.. then I heard a ?Trancecore? track.. then they like totally went dtrait up in2 Happy Hardcore most the rest of the set!!  I LOVED IT!!  It was so fun dancing!

I also like Owl's set! She stayed like on the dark trance tip & I don't think i remember her spinning like any like industrial tracks in her trance set like she did that 1 time b4 when i saw her spin last...

But overall.. the party was fun! I had fun seein' alota familiar faces, groovin' the night away, oh oh oh, then there was a lil' after party thingie @ oh oh oh... so like there's this dude i met like @ a party mondo back in the day... lol... i didn't see him again 'til that night & it was so Dope catchin' up... so he had like this lil' get 2gether @ his pad after the party... i bought some food @ the gas station & some sour peach circle thingies... LoL... so i ended up sharin' my pizza pocket w/ people there & my sour peaches candy w/ every1!!  Oh yeah.. I also discovered that I fuckin' rock playing Mortal Combat on X Box! =) LoL

So yeah... Sat night/ Sunday morning was fun times... there was a lill' drama that kinda went on la la la & well.. I should mention that Blondie Tard only remembers me when she's like rollin 'cause when she ain't... she's kinda mean 2 me sometimes & don't remembner me... LoL... but she wasn't the major cause of drama... jus' thought i'd mention her...

OK... have a good Midweek & I shall see most of y'all on Thursday I hope.. I dunno where I"m gonna be yet... but yeah!

Good Times!

Take Care,
Peace-> ObY {8O)

Yes... what Phillip said and toss in the fact that gba hasn't even been
living here up until a few weeks ago.

I've seen plenty of breaks based events or that have a heavy breaks flavor.
First thing that comes to mind is Saturday nights at The Top in Lower Haight
(Webster@Haight). It's put on by some high quality dj's.

Progressive house - SF - Progression at 26 Mix (every 3rd sunday i think?).
There is another event in the south bay that's progressive. Look for people
like Macadio or Jack Triumph and you'll find progressive house.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] BEE//ES//PEE :: ForeverYoung :: 80's.LUBBERS !!

GO TO THIS PARTY. You can't get any closer to living out a movie like 16
Candles and starring all of your favorite 80's icons. Long Duck Dong, Yahoo
Serious, Michael Anthony Hall, and others will be in attendance. Only 150
people get to go so this will be just like that old prom from way back when
your date puked up dinner on your rented tux then proceded to get half naked
and do the Localmotion. Or was it the Roger Rabbit? Hmmm...

Basically if you're a fashion victim that's buying into the 80's revival
look and loves *electro-clash* you'll be in heaven. You'll get to see the
original clothes and hear the original music. So no matter if you were only
5 years old when the 80's hit their peak, you can turn back the clock and
get a taste of what your older siblings had. =D

Only $5??

about a month ago i breathed word about an 80's party.
 mark you calendars for 01/31/04 cuz it's going down!
your chauffeurs into the den of swank, hair product
decadence, and voracious fashion statements will be:

sticky (ambient mafia, sf)
DJ R (bz, stargaze, sf)
naru (stargaze, SR, la)
shazbot (moksha tribe, newstylesound, sf)
drop (bz, ambient mafia, sf)
dj aryn (aec, viberation, sf)
indigo (ambient mafia, sf)
dj bam (invibe.com, sf)

upon arriving, we'll escort the willing to a photo
setup where the lovely araya will capture that
auspicious, sappy moment before your makeup runs and
there's nothing left of your dignity.  there will be
punch (i highly recommend you try some) & trashy
snacks, but remember this is a BYOB affair if you need
*more* than that.  as a reminder - dress the f*ck up!
it's fun, easy, relatively cheap, and you won't be
alone ;)  you can recreate this party to be the prom
you never went to because chad, the page-haired poet
who led debate class, didn't ask you to go, or this
can be the moment where you cry up to the 80's gods
'damn i look fine in my stone-washed hammer pants and
screw you all if you who made fun of me when i sang
along to NKOTB's 'step by step'.  ah, the
possibilities are endless :)

this event is going on for 3 reasons.  i f*cking love
the 80's (troll away), any excuse to get everyone
under one roof and have a good time is a damn fine
reason for getting out of the house, but most
importantly, we're raising money to help the epiphane
crew pay off the fine they received at their last
event.  tickets are only $5 which can be purchased via
paypal on the evite i'm sending out;  donations are
definitely encouraged if you'd like to pitch in more.
i've already gotten some email addresses, but if you'd
like to go, email me privately so i can add you to the
roster.  this venue is limited to 150 capacity so get
on this now before we fill up!

happy new year to everyone, here's hoping you
recovered nicely ;)

Well hell, I think it was just going to be a an overdrawn boring series of 
spam; but I like your idea and I think we should run with it.  It will make 
Ms. Dahl's posts a little bit more tolerable.

Subject: [sfraves] Matrix Revelry Review


U know I have to admit, when i first got the flier to this party i had a bit
of that... *rolls eyes* feeling. like o my god matrix revelry oookkkk
because
i remember sugesting to someone who was planing a party to make it matrix
but
then we decided it was too cliche and people wouldn't like it. because a lot
of people didn't like the last two movies and what not. Anyhoo, out of a
string
of bizare coincidences my friends and i (including Osby!) ended up attending
this party. & of course we showed up in costume and got in for $10, there's
no
way were gonna pay $20 for that bush and van ness venue. so we show up at
the
party, & low & behold... it actually kicked ass. The decorations were bad
ass, they had a projector in one chill room playing all the matrix movies
with
sound and everything, i enjoyed that. In another room all of the walls were
compleately decked up in matrix code, which was just awsome. and all the
other
rooms were just all black and with everyone in costume and what not they
managed
to give a matrix feel all night long. I'm not big into DJ's per se, i just
like good music so i couldn't tell you who's sets were good that night but i
do
remember Tamim's set was off the hook. and it was impressive to see micheal
lui
once again. I have to mention that none of us ingested a single drug and we
had a blast, we even went to an after party in emeryville and met a lots of
cool people. I'm taking this party as a sign that the scene is back in
effect.
Granted, yes people do not as often come up and give you hugs and let u play
with their lil fuzzy toys while they express how much they love you. Granted
yes
you may catch a few mean mugs from some thugs or get bumbed into by a group
of
rambunctious pre-teens while you're trying to dance, but all & all the music
is still good, it's still fun to dance, still meeting lots of cool people &
we're still on the edge of something very different than what everyone else
does
on their fri-sat nights. i'm proud of all the old school heads i keep
running
into since the 90's, all the people who just keep going, who've endured
through all the talk of "the scene is dying/dead" and what not. Anyways...
not to
keep ranting, this is just my review for the party. Good job guys... whoever
threw this party i already forgot their crew's name, elektro... something er
other, u know who u r.
     moral of the story is don't doubt a party that seems "cliche" at first
because it just might actually kick ass in the end. - Jaze

this is a fictional piece that we are starting this year...a weekly installation that will either change each week or continue from week to week depending on how good it gets. this week's is a brief character sketch:
 
joe weaved in and out of the crowd, hat in hand, a smile on his face, a yearning in his heart...it had started badly and ended worse, but a night out should fix that...it used to anyway. he had a burnt out lighter in his pocket that she'd given him many years ago. he knew that he needed someone, but not her this time, that was for sure. hopefully, the music would be to his liking. hopefully, he'd just blend right in. he lowered his head, and put his hat on top, tipping the brim down nice and low...:)

yo daniel,

i did "open my fucking eyes":  you've been complaining about SF
nonstop since you got here.  

tell you what:  let me know what kind of music you like, the
type of people you hope to meet, and i'll do my best to
personally take you out and show you a good time in the city.

deal?  if you don't have fun, feel free to rip on SF all you
want.  i think most of my friends will agree that i know how to
have a good time...

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Uhh.. Richard Humpty Vision as a headliner?

Damn...and you just can't argue with that. The man is offering to take you 
out personally...that's pretty damn cool.

I haven't been out much here, but the few times I've made it out, I've had a 
great time. Way better than back in DC as far as I'm concerned. Not to try 
and sound like I'mtaking sides or anything, but I've partied in New York a 
rack of times, and while they have some phat venues and dj's there, the 
crowds are a bunch of shitheads for the most part (unless you're talking the 
Sunday afternoon House weeklies). Any of the huge "raves" put on there are 
filled with underage dust heads and tweekers, not to mention shady ass gangs 
roving through the parties. The clubs are generally euro-trash to the nth 
degree...I don't know why anyone sweats New York....

So I'm in town this week for Macworld (any SF ravers bopping about the 
show?). I'd love to get out from the hotel to hear some tunes, any 
suggestions this week? I'll most likely hit Mark Farina at mezzanine on 
Friday, but what else is happening?

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Uhh.. Richard Humpty Vision as a headliner?

y'know, i thought it was pretty good too, but only part of it.

first, what was up with all of the electroclash people?  that
was just funny.  lots of muff, too.

i thought ellen allien (sp) was not so good.  not so much, no. 
richie got bangin' a little over halfway into his set...the
first half was not up to par with what i've heard in the past.

if you were there, you might have seen me sitting behind mr.
hawtin on the little stairs leading up to the DJ booth (on the
right).  best seat in the house.  ;)

if you want more of the stuff of that nature, then we're
totally on the same page.  i'll keep my eyes open and let you
know.  techno is strong in the bay area:  you just need to know
where to look.

Bush Grabs New Power for FBI

By Kim Zetter  |   Also by this reporter Page 1 of 2 next =BB

02:00 AM Jan. 06, 2004 PT

While the nation was distracted last month by images of Saddam Hussein's
spider hole and dental exam, President George W. Bush quietly signed into
law a new bill that gives the FBI increased surveillance powers and
dramatically expands the reach of the USA Patriot Act.

The Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2004 grants the FBI
unprecedented power to obtain records from financial institutions without
requiring permission from a judge.

Under the law, the FBI does not need to seek a court order to access such
records, nor does it need to prove just cause.

Previously, under the Patriot Act, the FBI had to submit subpoena requests
to a federal judge. Intelligence agencies and the Treasury Department,
however, could obtain some financial data from banks, credit unions and
other financial institutions without a court order or grand jury subpoena
if they had the approval of a senior government official.

The new law (see Section 374 of the act), however, lets the FBI acquire
these records through an administrative procedure whereby an FBI field
agent simply drafts a so-called national security letter stating the
information is relevant to a national security investigation.

And the law broadens the definition of "financial institution" to include
such businesses as insurance companies, travel agencies, real estate
agents, stockbrokers, the U.S. Postal Service and even jewelry stores,
casinos and car dealerships.

The law also prohibits subpoenaed businesses from revealing to anyone,
including customers who may be under investigation, that the government
has requested records of their transactions.

Bush signed the bill on Dec. 13, a Saturday, which was the same day the
U.S. military captured Saddam Hussein.

Some columnists and bloggers have accused the president of signing the
legislation on a weekend, when news organizations traditionally operate
with a reduced staff, to avoid public scrutiny and criticism. Any
attention that might have been given the bill, they say, was supplanted by
a White House announcement the next day about Hussein's capture.

James Dempsey, executive director of the Center for Democracy &
Technology, didn't see any significance to the timing of Bush's signing.
The 2004 fiscal year began Oct. 1 and the Senate passed the bill in
November. He said there was pressure to pass the legislation to free up
intelligence spending.

However, Dempsey called the inclusion of the financial provision "an
intentional end-run" by the administration to expand the administration's
power without proper review.

Critics like Dempsey say the government is trying to pass legislation that
was shot down prior to the U.S. invasion of Iraq, when the Bush
administration drafted a bill to expand the powers of the Patriot Act.

The so-called Patriot Act II was discovered by the Center for Public
Integrity last year, which exposed the draft legislation and initiated a
public outcry that forced the government to back down on its plans.

But critics say the government didn't abandon its goals after the uproar;
it simply extracted the most controversial provisions from Patriot Act II
and slipped them surreptitiously into other bills, such as the
Intelligence Authorization Act, to avoid raising alarm.

Dempsey said the Intelligence Authorization Act is a favorite vehicle of
politicians for expanding government powers without careful scrutiny. The
bill, because of its sensitive nature, is generally drafted in relative
secrecy and approved without extensive debate because it is viewed as a
"must-pass" piece of legislation. The act provides funding for
intelligence agencies.

"It's hard for the average member to vote against it," said Dempsey, "so
it makes the perfect vehicle for getting what you want without too much
fuss."

The provision granting increased power was little more than a single line
of legislation. But Dempsey said it was written in such a cryptic manner
that no one noticed its significance until it was too late.

"We were the first to notice it outside of Congress," he said, "but we
only noticed it in September after it had already passed in the House."

Rep. Porter Goss (R-Florida), chairman of the House Intelligence Committee
that reviewed the bill, introduced the legislation into the House last
year on June 11, where it passed two weeks later by a vote of 410-9. The
Senate passed the bill by unanimous consent on July 31.

Goss's staff said he was out of the country and unavailable for comment.
But Goss told the House last year that he believed the financial
institution provision in the bill brought the intelligence community up to
date with the reality of the financial industry.

"This bill will allow those tracking terrorists and spies to 'follow the
money' more effectively and thereby protect the people of the United
States more effectively," he said.

But Rep. Betty McCollum (D-Minnesota), who opposed the legislation, told
the House, "It is clear the Republican leadership and the administration
would rather expand on the USA Patriot Act through deception and secrecy
than debate such provisions in an open forum."

Despite her remarks, however, McCollum voted in favor of the legislation.

A number of other representatives expressed concern that the financial
provision was slipped into the Intelligence Act at the 11th hour with no
time for public debate and against objections from members the Senate
Judiciary Committee, which normally has jurisdiction over the FBI. Sen.
Patrick Leahy (D-Vermont), the minority leader of the Senate Judiciary
Committee, along with five other members of the Judiciary Committee, sent
a letter to the Intelligence Committee requesting that their committee be
given time to review the bill. But the provision had already passed by the
time their letter went out.

"In our fight to protect America and our people, to make our world a safer
place, we must never turn our backs on our freedoms," said Rep. C.L.
"Butch" Otter (R-Idaho) in a November press release. "Expanding the use of
administrative subpoenas and threatening our system of checks and balances
is a step in the wrong direction."

Otter, however, also voted in favor of the bill.

Charlie Mitchell, legislative counsel for the American Civil Liberties
Union, said many legislators failed to recognize the significance of the
legislation until it was too late. But he said the fact that 15
Republicans and over 100 Democrats voted against the Conference Report of
the bill indicated that, had there been more time, there probably would
have been sufficient opposition to remove the provision.

"To have that many people vote against it, based on just that one
provision without discussion beforehand, signifies there is strong
opposition to new Patriot Act II powers," Mitchell said.

He said legislators are now on the lookout for other Patriot Act II
provisions being tucked into new legislation.

"All things considered, this was a loss for civil liberties," he said. But
on a brighter note, "this was the only provision of Patriot II that made
it through this year. Members are hearing from their constituents. I
really think we have the ability to stop much of this Patriot Act II
legislation in the future."

Subject: [sfraves] so long

well, ok, i'm just joking about all this gatekeeper stuff.  or am i?  
who knows?  i just think it's kind of funny to appoint yourself to 
different things in life.  don't you?  now i was sooo lazy this time, i 
spent most of my time in the cruz.  so next time i'll connect with more 
people.  or will i?  is there anyone out there in the land of 
sociability that's able to really keep in contact with more than about 
5 people at a time?

The pictures coming from the Hubble telescope are just incredible.  Send 
shivers up my spine:)  And how about those stereoscopic pics from Mars?

I am up here in Portland OR and pretty much stranded. I am sure my
neighbors are laughing at me as I try to get my cheap ass cable chains
on my tires. What's worse is when I get them on drive half a block and
lose one and don't realize it until I pull into the gas station that
sucked. I went back and could here a neighbor outside chuckling. Damn I
grew up in AZ and I really have no idea about chains. When I lived in
the bay I never went to the slopes so I never had to worry about chains.
And what's worse is with cable chains you cannot go faster than 30 mph
which you really don't realize how slow that is until you are stuck
doing it. Well just thought I would share my snow experiences with you
all. We had 5 inches of snow on Tuesday and then freezing rain all
yesterday and last night. It looks like the area should thaw tonight and
tomorrow. Peace

 

Jason

Subject: [sfraves] SFR t-shirts - tonight at Sublounge

I'll have the remainder of the SFR t-shirts at Sublounge tonight.  If 
you haven't seen them, they're based on the original SFR shirts, but 
updated to be Y2K-compliant - printed on top-quality 100% 
sweatshop-free (made in LA) American Apparel shirts. I have many 
colors, and almost all sizes, from a small babydoll t's to XXL men's 
t's. $20 each, or 2 for $36.

I'll be at Sublounge from 9 - 12, and behind the decks from 10-11:15.  
stop on by!

-Philip-

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

hello, just a reminder for the new readers that this is soley a fictional read here. for fun and hopefully, less boring times, we are introducing a weekly fictional column here. this week's read has been a brief character sketch...kind of an interesting fellow, so we might stretch out his life through next week, depending  on how the creator(s) feel about it:

the club was filled with purple light and an echoing magnetic haze of sound fused with sweat and movement. joe slumped low in the corner at his favorite table. things began to look up in his world just momentarily and then moved back down into darkness. strange. this release he felt. he couldn't stop thinking about the theme to "the crying game" either. secretly, it was one of his favorites. he'd always kept that to himself. :)

--=====================_17312243==.ALT
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"; format=flowed

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

::The Birth of the Entertainment Commission:::::

Last July, we saw the reality of the Entertainment Commission that we 
helped to conceive and create. Yes, you CAN change City Hall, and the 
Entertainment Commission is proof. The seven-person EC (whose president is 
our chairperson Terrance Alan) reviews entertainment permit applications 
the first and third Tuesday each month.

The public is welcome to attend as this panel representing neighborhoods, 
police, planning, medical services and the entertainment industry considers 
how to permit entertainment businesses and events and keep neighborhoods 
safe and secure. This new system is much more responsive and broad-based 
than the old process, and though procedures are still being created, it's 
clearly a good idea.

To learn more, and for upcoming meeting schedules and agendas, as well as 
minutes of past meetings, visit their website at 
http://sfgov.org/site/entertainment_index.asp. Better still, make the time 
to see the EC in action by attending a meeting. This new structure is a 
great thing for our city, and we hope it will become a model for other 
cities as well.


::Advocates for Nightlife and Entertainment at City Hall and in Sacramento:::::

Our Legislative Director, John Wood, works to represent the interests and 
perspective of the nightlife community at City Hall. This year, successes 
include:

- Castro Halloween - We worked in conjunction with the Entertainment 
Commission and Supervisor Bevan Dufty to transform what had become an 
unruly and often dangerous event into an organized, peaceful and fun 
San-Francisco-style party again. It was a beautiful thing, and many 
volunteer organizations participated, raising funds to benefit many 
nonprofit organizations in the city.

- Loudspeaker Permits - It may seem a small thing, but it was only fair; we 
pushed for a re-interpretation of permit fees so that free non-commercial 
events now pay the reduced non-profit fee rates for Loudspeaker permits.

- One-Night Permits - This has been a high priority for us because many 
great entertainment events happen in venues that aren't regularly used for 
entertainment, such as galleries or safe warehouse spaces. We helped 
develop rules and regulations to allow the issuance of one-night 
entertainment event permits for these kinds of venues.

- Ins and Outs - The SFPD had routinely been inserting "no ins and outs" 
stipulations into extended hours permits, and we successfully argued 
against this policy. The Entertainment Commission has adopted a policy of 
allowing ins and outs unless there is a clear need to restrict them for a 
specific venue.

- 18-and-over Venues
We worked with the San Francisco Youth Commission to create legislation 
that will all venues licensed for 18-and-over to apply for extended hours 
permits. Supervisor Bevan Dufty has introduced this legislation to the 
Board of Supervisors, and there will be public hearings in January. Visit 
www.sfgov.org/site/youth_commission_index.asp to learn more about the Youth 
Commission.


::Changing Last Call for California:::::

Many of the major destination cities in the U.S. allow alcohol sales after 
2am, including New York City, Miami, Chicago and New Orleans. We want 
California's major cities (San Francisco, Los Angeles, San Diego and San 
Jose) to be competitive in attracting more tourism to the city, and there 
are statistics that indicate a later last call is much safer on the roads 
as well. We have developed a proposal to allow these cities to choose to 
extend "last call" for on-site alcohol sales. Check out 
www.sfbg.com/38/13/x_sonic_reducer.html to see what the Bay Guardian has to 
say about it.


::Club Summit:::::

We've begun planning a "Club Summit" for the spring where entertainment 
permit holders, promoters, nightlife employees and clubgoers can learn 
about recent changes in entertainment policy, meet Entertainment 
Commissioners and other city officials, and work together to transform San 
Francisco back into a world-class entertainment city. If you want to make 
sure to be in the invite list for this event, send an email to 
leslie@sflnc.com and we'll put you on the list.


::For Your Benefit::::

We'll keep working to build our membership, from individuals and 
businesses, and through other means -- whatever it takes. Part of this is 
because we need to raise money to keep going - and one of the most fun ways 
to do that is to ask promoters to do benefits for the SFLNC. We'll be 
contacting you to invite you to participate in a month-long event to raise 
awareness and money for the SFLNC and our work. But you can beat the crowd 
-- send an email to leslie@sflnc.com if you'd like to designate one of your 
club nights or events as a fundraiser for the SFLNC. It's a great way to 
participate in our work.

And if you're someone with a website or email list dedicated to 
entertainment and nightlife, we'll be asking you to link to our site as 
well -- the more we can spread the word, the more we can accomplish.


::A Membership Organization:::::

We became a member-based organization in 2003, and we want you to join. 
It's an easy and affordable way to keep us going -- since we're YOUR 
political action committee. Just visit http://sflnc.com/index/donate/ and 
join today. Yes, every member does make a difference!


Made it this far? Thanks for reading, and for your continued support of the 
SFLNC. See you on the dancefloor in 2004!

Subject: [sfraves] UPLIFT at the SUBLOUNGE


I had a great time at Uplift at the Sublounge tonite. It was a much
needed break from the stress that has been dealt with lately.

But on that note, I want to send huge amounts of negativity to the
person that tonite thought it was cute to steak the yellow and black
knitted hat of my girlfriend.

DON'T YOU KNOW IT WAS HER HAT SHE KNITTED HERSELF TO HIDE THE FACT THAT
SHE IS A CANCER PATIENT???

I hope you feel a huge amount of shame as you gaze at it with no sense
of connection to it in the morning -- I mean seriously, what kind of
stupid excuse do YOU have for stealing it from a goddamn cancer
patient?! 

I hope you think long and hard about what you did and that you have the
moral integrity to return it. 

Thanks.

-tim.

Tim, I am glad you had a good time at our event,,,as far as the previously 
mentioned incident, I am sure that the person who did that was unaware of 
the circumstances.  As far as sending out negativity, try sending love to 
that person who *may not understand*  My father had cancer and I understand 
how emotions and anger can get involved, but please try to see the best in 
people....I know it is hard sometimes, some people are just so unaware, it 
is up to us to show them what we *are capable of,
with love,
The guy with the orange scarf,
Danny Picard

I am assuming I got put on their mailing list because I am on SFraves, I 
don't mind at all tho, the party looks tight.  Have you heard about this 
party?  Just wanted to know what y'all thought about it.  Also, what are 
your experiences with the down low lounge?  They are havin a hiphop/reggae 
thang on saturday that looks cool.  Two east bay spots that seem coo!

Subject: Re: [sfraves] UPLIFT at the SUBLOUNGE

I had a great time as well; Unfortunately I wasn't to stay as long as I
would have liked. I guess that happens when you catch a ride with someone
else.

Great place, almost scary basement, lol and was awesome to see Will, Andy,
JC, Joey Frisco, my man Ossby, DJ Bam and that crazy dancing cat Jeff whom I
met from Seattle. Got to meet a lot of new friends...There is a definite
feeling of family at this event and everyone is welcomed very warmly.
Looking forward to next week, great event guys. I will be sure to drive
myself so I can stay longer. Good tunes; everything from breaks to jungle to
progressive, all bangin on a nice sound system.

That really sucks about the hat. Best wishes on the recovery process of your
lady. I don't think it is a bad thing to show your anger tim....it is a
really screwed up situation, especially considering and all. Without hate,
you cannot have love. Even if the person in question didn't realize the
circumstances, that is no excuse for stealing regardless..not real sure I
follow your point Danny. Stealing is never explainable, or excusable. It
ain't cool to be a jive turkey so close to Christmas.

Anyway, in closing, I hope the hat is returned, and I have give this event
big thumbs up.

Well maybe not, but my partner in crime is gonna be laying down some =
sick ass progressive beats, as a guest dj, tonight at AsiaSF, with the =
hosstribe crew. Which means Floorcraft and his cast are gonna be out =
representing as well. Yahoo! - Definitely gonna make it out to see him. =
Will's sets are always laid down flawless, his song selections a step =
ahead, and the vibe he emits when playing is inspiring. If you have =
never experienced an Illiaster set, I'm sorry. So if you are looking for =
cool folks and the best tunes of the night, I am betting on this party.=20

Anyway, come out and say hi. I'm the tall guy they call jack. I believe =
there is no cover, so consider yourself on the guest list if that makes =
you feel better. It does for me ;)

Here is some info on the event.

Subject: [sfraves] Request: Mix Tapes (specific artists) 

This might be a long shot, but along with my CD and Waxx collection, I
also still listen to mixtapes (there's still a tape deck in my car
too baby)

I am looking for the following mix tapes (*willing to
purchase/trade)

Carlos,Powerhouse: High energy house with some dj tricks.

Carlos,Illusion: House and ravey techno/house, scratching.

Carlos,MDMA: Very nice house, vocal yet energetic.

Carlos,Love is the Law: side one is house and acid trance, side two is
smooth house, dj tricks include equalization manipulation.

Carlos, Deep: As the title suggests this is not a scratching high energy
Carlos, this is a sensitive warm tape.with no cover.

Dan,Live Mixes: Double pack from Organic, Funky Techno Tribe and
Come/Unity. Big hits; high energy house and some acidy stuff + vocals. 2
for$16.

Dan,Double pack1&2: One tape is a tribute to James Brown, funky with
tracks and mixes using JB. The live tape is more ravey funky techno
bits-o-breaks. 2 for $16.

Dan,Doublepack 3&4: This one is high energy Dan, not hardcore but not that
housey. 2 for $16

Dan,Jolly House Jams: Big flavorful house !

heard. House and ravey techno and back again , alot happens in this 90
min. of high energy.

Dan,S.F.Housing Project:

Dan,House the Discoteque:

Dan,Wicked Burning Frenzy: In his own opinion , the best hardcore tape he
ever made, Breakbeat hardcore techno.

Dan-Ron D Core,DX2 #1: "the Anthem" and other harcore rave hits and wistle
blowing madness.

Dan-Ron D Core,DX2 #2: Tape includes original release by Dan and X-pando.
Both sides hardcore techno, Dan has more breakbeat.

Dan-Ron D Core,DX2 #3:

Doran, 2010: Pretty trance of the kind that might get played at the 2010
olympics.

Doran, Innocence: Pretty trance with spine tingly moments of bliss!

Doran,Paradigms: Trance this time a bit dryer and more serious.

Doran, Eternity: This is a step further than the pretty trance he usually
mixes. This is an excursion into Nu-energy Mount Olympus Style Ambrosia!

DRC,the Jungle:from '92 tribal house with an edge.

DRC,Psychotropical: This has more trance and less house and very tribal
with some exotica flavor.

DRC,Irontale:The hardest yet. Hard tribal techno with an industrial flair,
moments of breakbeat, cyborg on cover sez it all.

DRC,Ritual Addiction:tribal-trance with an exotica flavor . Some house
too.

DRC,Eargasmika: Tribal trance/house deep not sappy , intricate yet not
manic.

DRC, In Between Worlds: Trancey German sounds with an anti-heroin theme.

DRC, Programed: Drc said this was stuff she has been playing for the last
year. It is banging acid trance with some high-energy flavor near the end.

hits of '93. Nice package and coloured tapes.

Dutch,The Funky Void:Trancey ravey tape. Sounds of the good 'ol days.

Garth, No Rest For the Wicked: Cd of good moovin funky disco tribal acid
house.

mixed in.

Garth, Superjams: Sunrise session Wicked '96. House with Disco and Funk
flavors lots of guitar, horn, keybord musical stuff. And it's Phat too!

kind of heavy.

Garth, Live Come/Unity 10/2/96: This is the Garth you either hate or you

mental.

continued from yesterday and before...a fictional piece:
 
joe always wanted to know what it was like to be someone else, but then he realized that it would not be possible for him to ever be anyone other than himself. it is not that he ever wanted to be her, but he always felt that if he were her for at least a day, maybe he would have understood better, and then maybe this wouldn't be happening now, but as well, he couldn't say that he was sorry to be where he was at this time, and that meant that things were changing for the better inside of him. :)

Subject: RE: [sfraves] UPLIFT at the SUBLOUNGE

Thanks all.. it really was a great event, even with AndyW spinning
house.

It's just that the night was marred by the loss of a hat which, if you
were to see it, obviously was spent a great deal of time in making.
Regardless of the situation, I think if you lost something that you made
yourself for no other reason than leaving it on a barstool for a minute
while running to the bathroom -- well I think you'd be a tad bit angry
too.

whoa - had i known she needed a hat, i would have given her the

good to see everyone (except jack truimph - i didn't see him

there's lots of girly-boys singing disco anthems upstairs.

--=====================_11345323==.ALT

Newsbrief: Chicago Suburb Seeks to Ban Glow Sticks from All-Ages Clubs 1/9/04

Last month, the city council in the Chicago suburb of Elgin gave 
preliminary approval to a local ordinance that would ban pacifiers, glow 
sticks, and other "drug paraphernalia" from clubs in the city that cater do 
an under-21 crowd. The measure must pass another vote at the council this 
month.

The measure is an effort to rein in Ecstasy use. The move arises out of the 
city's experience with The Mission, a club the city allowed to hold 
alcohol-free parties for 17-to-21-year-olds for a limited time last year. 
Patrons had to become club members to enter. Police arrested eight people 
for Ecstasy or look-alike drug sales during that period.

"Obviously, not everyone that has these items is on Ecstasy, but it would 
be helpful to keep these things out of the club," Rick Kozal, Elgin's 
assistant city attorney, told the council before it voted initial approval 
by a 5-1 margin on December 17. Glowsticks and pacifiers are drug 
paraphernalia, Kozal claimed.

The proposed ordinance is probably unconstitutional, Graham Boyd, head of 
the ACLU's Drug Policy Litigation Project, told the Chicago Tribune. "It's 
one thing if the venue's operators decide to ban certain legal items on 
their own," Boyd said. "It's another thing when the government is calling 
for such a ban." Boyd successfully argued a suit in New Orleans overturning 
a judge's ruling that such items must be banned as part of a settlement in 
a rave club case there.

But at least one Elgin council member didn't see any government imposition. 
"If you want to come to the club, you have to be a member," said John 
Walters. "If you want to be a member, you have to agree not to bring these 
items to the club. If you don't want to do it, no one is going to stop you 
from sitting at home and waving a glow stick in front of your face."

The next vote is scheduled for January 14.

I'm into trains ... I'm surprised they kept mail trains going in the UK for 
so long. The US stopped sorting mail on trains in the early 1970s. (I remember 
having to write "Via Air Mail" if you wanted mail to go by air instead of the 
default, by rail.)  A great deal of mail in the US does actually move by rail, 
but it's merely carried in sealed cars and not sorted en route. 

Despite the fast, modern transportation we enjoy today, I understand that 
until sometime in the 1950s (?), most parts of the US received two mail 
deliveries a day! On the other hand, now we communicate so much via e-mail and fax that 
there would probably never be a need again to deliver more than once a day. 
lol Imagine SF Raves as a literal mailing list ... getting copies of letters in 
the mail from people on the list, mailing in replies, and waiting to see if 
anybody responds! 

hey ... everybody have a safe weekend!

OK everyone,

I've sent out the evite for this event, so everyone
should have their official invitation to doll/man it
up in costume for our 80's cheese affair.  Every DJ
has been doused with an 80's moniker, so here be the
official lineup:

DJ Small Wonder
aka drop (ambient mafia, BZ, SF)

DJ Rock Me Amadeus
aka naru (SR/Stargaze, LA)

DJ Long Duck Dong
aka redstickman (ambient mafia, epiphany, moksha
tribe, SF)

DJ Bitchin Camaro
aka dj bam (invibe.com, SF)

Der Kommissar
aka DJ R (Stargaze, BZ, SF)

DJ Lloyd Dobbler
aka indigo (FnF, UW, SF)

DJ Yahoo Serious
aka dj aryn (aec, SF)

DJ Short Circuit
aka shazbot (Moksha Tribe, newstylesound, OAK)

Hope to see some of you at Freeform at Asia SF
tonight, it's going to kick off and the rumours are
definitely true - illiaster is a kickass DJ.  He puts
quite a lot of dedication and thought to his sets so
you *know* it'll be something to definitely enjoy.

May you all have a beauteous weekend, and again -
shoot me an email if you'd like an evite :)

Subject: RE: [sfraves]  [Looking For Booty House records]


Belle Isle Tech is *classic* ghetto tech.  Right up there with the first
couple "the bomb" series from DJ Godfather and some of the on air mixes
from WJLB's Gary Chandler.  It's NOT booty house, booty house is more like
DJ Funk does.

Booty house sounds like *gasp* house.  Swingy funky house, often with that
hard house kick and overall Chicago sound.  Think older UC, Dance Mania,
coming in at 120 to 140 bpm.

Ghetto tech (or Accelerated Funk as DJ Assault likes to call it) is
faster on vinyl, and often played on pitched up turntables.  Pressed at
140 -155 bpm, in practice it's often fast enough to mix in some jungle,
or split the beat with some 80 bpm hip hop.  Databass, booty bar,
ElectroFunk labels are all strong leaders in this genre.

For a set mixing both genres a bit (as well as some electro and miami bass
and of course old school rave and children's records) and examples of some
of the genre mashing described in teh GT example, check out this live mix
from a campout two years ago (and keep any technical complaints to
yourself... suffice to say I woke up nowhere near my tent eaten alive by
ants and had a limited recollection of the evening):

http://saturn5.com/andy/mp3/andyw-booty_at_oode.mp3

Lately, people have been also using the booty house name to describe the
work of artists like Peaches... but the music is neither house nor ghetto
tech and sorta creates it's own genre on the edge of the electroclash
movement.

I'll shut up now.

Why would it be a joke? There's schools to learn to use every other

exclusive club anymore. :)

Subject: RE: [sfraves] [Looking For Booty House records]

Well...alot of Belle Isle Tech is ghettotech, but there're definately some 
booty house tracks on there too, because there are some straight up house 
tracks in the set. "Sex On The Beach" being the track that most obviously 
comes to mind. But even "Ass & Titties" is a much housier track than 
something like "Don't Try To Play Me Homie". Either way, it's a nice comp.

Subject: RE: [sfraves] UPLIFT at the SUBLOUNGE

I want to retract all the nasty stuff that I mentioned last night. You
know you gotta protect the people you love, hence I felt hurt a little
when something comes up missing like that.

Anyways, because of the kindness of you all the hat was found. Thank you
all for your support and love!!

Subject: [sfraves] SFR Calendar: 01.09.04

Dreams are postcards from our subconscious, inner self to outer self,
right brain trying to cross that moat to the left. Too often they come
back unread: "return to sender, addressee unknown." That's a shame because
it's a whole other world out there--or in here depending on your point of
view.
    Dennis Koenig and Jordan Budde, Northern Exposure, Roots, 1991

He felt that his whole life was some kind of dream and he sometimes
wondered whose it was and whether they were enjoying it.
    Douglas Adams (1952 - 2001), "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"

Those who dream by day are cognizant of many things which escape those who
dream only by night.
    Edgar Allan Poe (1809 - 1849), "Eleonora"

Saturday, January 10, 2004 ** Capricorn presented by Elektrosorcery **

Capricorn, whose constellation is known as Capricornus, is one of the oldes=
t of the astrological interpretations. Ruled by Saturn, its symbol is the g=
oat. This is sometimes depicted as a sea borne hybrid or Dolphin. The image=
 is often an animal with the body of a goat and the tail of a fish. In one =
tradition the image represents the god Pan transforming into a sea creature=
=2E A representation, perhaps, of the extremities found within this Astrolo=
gical sign. The Capricornian is generally a serious character possessing a =
wry sense of humor. Independent, steady as a rock, Capricorn reflects earth=
y qualities that range from clever to vacuous. Mostly cautious, confident, =
strong willed, reasonable and hard working, Capricorns are a rock upon whic=
h to build.They are capable of great endurance; a whatever it takes, for as=
 long as it takes persistence. Reliable in any profession they undertake, b=
ut lacking in originality, they usually excel in following up on what someo=
ne else has started. With Capricorn DJs: DYLOOT, UPHONIC, COVERT, SUNDANCE =
KID, and more to be announced. $10 presale $15 at the door.

 their wildly popular Soul:r label. With over a decade of experience on the=

UK's most in-demand Drum 'n Bass DJs.

METHOD ONE (Cov.Ops, method-one.com)
By 1994 Method One was both an acclaimed DJ and and experienced rave promot=
er in Philly. By 1996 he was also an established producer. Recording with p=
artner Kaos as Atlantiq, Method One signed tunes to labels like Good Lookin=
g and True Intent while holding down DJ residencies at Konkrete Jungle and =
Dieselboy's Platinum. Since relocating to the Bay, Jason continues to wreck=

Subject: Re: [sfraves] bsp  doc martin & get undergroud sat. 1.17.04

Me too! I wanna go. I got a doc martin CD at the Sticky party and have been
enjoying it ever since.

But how is club 6? Is there adequate room for the crowd?

I almost ended up there accidentally one night when I was trying to find Anu
(across the street).

The big bouncer at the door was really nice to me. I guess he wanted my
business that Thursday night.
But he said to come back. Now's my chance to dance!

Subject: RE: [sfraves] that madame mercury (JCF) commercial

this was posted on bayraves and written by DJ Oops, a friend of Sherry's and 
one of the people that made the PSA.

"greetings everyone... my name is Paul and I am one of the persons that was 
responsible for the creation of the "Follow your bliss" PSA. Public Service 
Announcement. I was the camera man and also assistant prodcer.
I would like to say that it feels very disheartening to hear that some 
people think that Madame Mercury has sold out.
When the concept of the "Follow your bliss" was created it was after 
learning that Madame Mercury after a hiatus from DJ'n dropped almost 
everything in her life at that time and put all her energy back into Dj'n. 
Back into sharing her energy and music with the community that showed it to 
her from the begnining. Essentially she "followed her bliss". She did what 
made her happy. After realizing so, my friends and I did the same. We all 
made life altering changes in life that will hopefully bring us happiness. 
If you're going to do something. Do something you love, right?
So... my friends and myself got the notion to put something in motion. Being 
as my friends and I are invloved in media(i.e. some are editores, camera 
men, director of photography). The editor worked on the "Burnt" PSA and was 
excited to do another with his own style. So we brainstormed and came up 
with the idea of a PSA and you all know the theme. Well.. we presented the 
idea to Madame Mercury and she gave us the go ahead. We filmed, we edited. 
Then it was time to find a Non-profit organization that would sponsor us. We 
tried and tried but to no avail we didn't find one. Then the editor in a 
last attempt wrote a letter to the Joseph Campbell foundation telling them 
about our PSA. They liked it, they sponsored us and now we are talking about 
it. This was all done from the heart. No one got paid. No one is asking you 
to join anything. We just want to share the notion of "following your bliss" 
.. do what you love... no matter what it may be.
So thank you for taking your time in reading my thoughts and take care.
-Paul"

Subject: Re: [sfraves] that madame mercury (JCF) commercial

I never even saw the commercial, but I heard about the madam mercury and
"follow your bliss" part. . .

sometimes the message isn't as complicated as others might think. . .

I figured, shes a longtime dj, in a commercial mentioning following your
bliss. . .
it was on dharma n greg the other day, dharma wanted greg to follow his
bliss so greg quit being a lawyer to be a chef, etc etc. . .

just basically a public service announcement sorta thing, like the be cool
stay in school stuff using someone who's done that and also has a
recognizable name amongst their target audience. . .

but the dr. pepper commercials. . . those really don't make sense. . . did
you know that dr pepper used to contain prune juice, and was recommended for
keeping someone "regular". . .
I think an old teacher of mine told me that, but then again he also sang
this "starkle starkle lil twink" song a lot. . .

we are tired, but we are going to give it a shot here, and continue this fictional piece, if ever so briefly:
 
even though it was the weekend, it wasn't in joe's world. as a matter of fact, he couldn't remember the last time he had the kind of weekend that people talk about when they mean "weekend"...maybe those people were lying too when they'd tell him what a great time they'd had and what he'd missed. maybe she wasn't ever that special in the first place. he lifted his drink and filled his mouth with sweet sugary juice and some sort of alcohol. where did this one come from? couldn't remember for the life of him. joe had all sorts of friends and acquaintances. :)

Subject: [sfraves] UPLIFT WAS SO DOPE!

OK... Hello 2day... 1st off... i felt guilty 4 not goin' 2 Bad Kitty... but like well..  it was Thursday, my school is literally 2 minutes away from sublounge... so i went there!!  Seraphim, girl, U know I'll C U soon! =)

Anywaze... i had the time of my life on Thursday night @ uplift... i mean... seriously it kinda felt like an extension of New Years @ Wish almost 'cause alota people I huumg out w/ @ Wish was there!!  So yeah... it was totally family oriented that night & well... gosh it was fun!

Music was Awesome... when I got there.. Kinkers was playin' this Awesome Strait Breakbeats set!!  Loved it!!  B4 like I went 2 school that evening... I saw Britney Spears on VH1 & I was kinda thinkin' about her new song all throughout class & well.. during Konker's set... I felt like I had 2 dance like I was in 1 of her videos 'cause I had like all this mondo energy... Fun Fun.. oh yeah... him & I were slow dancing during Ambers set btw... fun fun =P

Then I oh oh ohoh oh... I finally officially kicked it Joey Fiasco!!!  Love That Dude!!! You got Awesome energy man!!! =)  But the whole night was pretty much filled w/ alota Fam like I said & U all know who U were ;)

Then Turquiose,er, I mean, Magenta, no no no... I mean... Indigo jumps on the decks & totally get's off playin' this Awesome Breakbeats set!!  YUUUUM!!  Then he popped in some hoip hop tunes toeards the end of his set & ok... i noticed he played like a remix remix remix of this old 80's rap song.. but well.. i dunno... i can't explain it 'cause well... he didn't get it when i tried asking him about it.. la la la... Hello 2Day Indigo =)

What trip me out the most was Andy's set... he was spinning Tech House like ummm... Wow... it was Awesome!!!  OK... the most trippy thing was well... downstairs in the basement... they were spinning like proggy house most the whole night... then there was this track that the DJ down there spun of this well Andy & the DJ downstair spun the same song @ the same time & it was fuckin' trippy as hell! I mean... it was jus' like this mondo surreal experience... Anywaze... Hello 2Day... Andy's set did get yummier as he went on.. he mixed in some break beakbeats & by the time his set ended... he was spinning some Ghetto tek!!  Loved it!

OK... now Amber's set was Crazy... she had a bag fulla fun tracks!! I mean... she was pretty light on the acid that night... but ooooh mt goodness man... Hello 2day... she totally got the floor when she spun 80's music!!  Hello 2day... Here comes the rain again!!! Loved it!!!  Oh my goodness man... 

JC was spinning the same time & well... he told me prior 2 his set that he had a bunch of yummy trance & techno records... but everytime I went down there.. all i was groovin' 2 was trance... i didn't hear any techno =(  Groovy set non the less!!

Like i said it was a bad ass night!!!  I'm Glad U got your hat back Eva!!!  Oh yeah... that night i got invited 2 join a cult.. loooooong story!!  LoL...

Good times! =)  I <3 U all! Have a mondo safe weekend... ok? =)

Subject: Re: [sfraves] nrr: odd superhero question

Wonder Woman's rope (I think) also forced people in it to tell the truth,
and her bracelets could deflect bullets and stuff.
Uh and she had an invisible jet.

Dunno bout Lucy.  I think the show was Greatest American Hero.  That shows
main premise was he had powers thrust upon
him and didn't know how to use them properly, or he found a suit with powers
and same result regarding use of powers.

hey did wonderwoman ever have any real special powers besides strength and
her lasso which was basically just a rope anyways. . .
like from the old ass tv shows. . .
was lucy lawless's name lucy's real name ?

and what was that show that used to be on where this guy somehow got all
sorts of special powers but when he saw the color red everything went away.
. .was it Great American Hero ?

? just a random thought

Yeah that's exactrly what I was looking for: a good mid-week weekly with 
that warm, faimly vibe. The fact that it's a progressive/breaks night 
certainly helps too.  :)

Sorry I won't make it to Progression, I'll most certainly make a point 
of it next time I come to town.

Personal note @ Jeff :
    My apology for not making it to FreeForm last night. Hope it went 
well. Anywhere else I can catch u b4 Tue?

Personal note @Danny:
    I would have stuck around longer if I had known it was your party. I 
called you Wed, the least you could do is to call me back and say "Hey, 
BTW I'm doing this party....."

Anyways, it was good to meet y'all. Hope to run into some of you this 
weekend.


- Jeff

Subject: Re: [sfraves] nrr: odd superhero question

the greatest american hero...the suit came from aliens and also came with an 
instruction manual, but he lost it immediately after gettting the suit.

what was the name of that show where the kid got super powers and could 
levitate but not fly...so he'd levitate and used cans of hairspray (or 
something) to propel him through the air?

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Changes, (was (Review) Anon Salon)

Sorry if I respond to this thread a little late.

I'd like to add that change is the very essence of our scene. UDM grew 
out of the desire to change music as we know it, from timbres, to 
structures to textures. But we're human, we grow to attach to what 
become familiar and reliable to us (whether you're a househead, junglist 
or trancewhore). We tend to go to the same parties regularly because 
we're going to have a good time. As a person become a regular at certain 
parties/events/genres, they also become detached to everything else 
there is out there.

It's up to us, the participants, to look for new music, throw new 
parties, and represent. This is particularly true for newbies, who are 
typically enthuiastic and open-minded. The "scene" to them usually is 
MUCH BIGGER than for us the old-skoolers, who usually limit ourselves to 
a certain niche.

If you're tired of the same people and cirlces, then go out and look for 
something new. There are plenty of ppl faithly throwing 
weeklies/monthlies regularly, waiting for you to discover them.  :)  
Make new friends, hear new music. That's what the scene is about.

The scene do run in cycles. There's also the 5-yr swinging popularity 
cycle b/w clubs and one-offs. I've only been to SF for a few days, but 
it seems that the club scene here is shrinking, while there seems to be 
a small momentum towards one-offs, monthlies and mid-week weeklies.

The scene nationally has been on a steady downturn since 2001, so I 
expect there will be another explosion again soon. It'll probably take a 
new genre (or a diversion of a trusted genre) to set the scene off 
again. There's a steady momentum behind nu-skool breaks, and the d'n'b 
scene is finally moving away from the tired techstep formula, and 
progressive tribal has the potential of reviving the progressive house 
scene by introucing a new focus to rhythm.

Keep an open mind, and support the music and the parties and the people 
that you love. As long as we all do our parts, the rest will happen in 
due time.  :)


Pz.,

DIRTYWORDS.TMP&type=printable

a new bill is going to be pushed through congress to make seven words  
banned from all public airwaves... this would make howerd stern pretty  
damn boring...
some text in part...
"
Rep. Doug Ose of Sacramento has seven dirty words very much on his  
mind, courtesy of such free speakers as U2 singer Bono and Nicole  
Richie, the rich kid co-star of "The Simple Life.''

Fed up with recent repeated instances of broadcast TV networks allowing  
language that many people would deem offensive to be aired live, the  
Republican House member has introduced a bill that spells out the seven  
awful words that would be banned from the public air waves in all their  
forms and all their meanings -- "including verb, adjective, gerund,  
participle, and infinitive forms,'' as the bill says."

buyer beware this comp is solid but it doesn't have the popular version of Ass'n'Titties but an early one.  (sorry M!)

AndyW!!! spot on description of GT and such.  much respect and also for your set back at Bad Kitty. I remember you dropping Phonecia right into some Dance Mania shit <---LIKE, ARE YOU FROM THE D?!

regarding records- us not being in the midwest- the best places to find ghetto house and ghettotech that I know of are... Open Mind (check their used bin in the Dance Mania folder), B.P.M., Ameoba, but much better is online.  here's a good spot to look:

http://www.twilight76.com/

by the way, for a really good online mini documentary on Booty House, check this out---> http://www.ruben.fm/videos/ghetto.mov
It stars Funk, Deeon, Milton, Jammin Gerald and Slugo...
thats pretty much all the names you need to know for ghetto house!

peace,
Baby Daddy

ooooh... i spent long hours at BPM when they had their last 50% sale...

Victor (the owner) is great - he's got a habit of buying a case of 
Heineken and giving them to people while they're listening to records.

Subject: [sfraves] Skills

NOT the rekkid store.  BUT, tonight I was at an event, and I finally
decided to watch the "headliner" and I was less than impressed with
their skills (thus the subject line.)  I mean, waiting for the breakdown
in a song and then mixing the next track in, often not on beat, in less
than eight measures?????  What's up with that??

I mean you know me.  I like to sit there for a couple of minutes plus
playing around with a combination of songs.  And I'm sitting here
watching that.  How dissappointing!  I'm kinda left to wonder if it's a
genre thing.

I won't say any more, for fear of spilling the beans.  But.......

-- 
What this says to me is that too many whites are getting away with drug
use, too many whites are getting away with drug sales, too many whites
are getting away with trafficking in this stuff. The answer to this
disparity is not to start letting people out of jail because we're not
putting others in jail who are breaking the law. The answer is to go out
and find the ones who are getting away with it, convict them and send
them up the river, too."

- Rush Limbaugh. October 5, 1995 show transcript.

Subject: [sfraves] .: Dirtbox Radio 1/11 | DJ Twist | Hooligan :.


Y'all know whatchu need?  Some Dirtbox Radio.

How do you get this Dirtbox Radio?

Easy, you tune into Destroyer.net or Jungletrain.net tonight (and every
Sunday night) from 7pm 'til 12am+ EST.

This week we've got a little bit of breaks in with your DNB, brought forth
by DJ Twist, in his first appearance on Dirtbox.  Dude mashed up twice at
ALIAS battles, and has been gettin airplay in a good number of spots
around here, so rest assured he'll throw down.

Also comin' out tonight is one of the original Dirtbox Kru members:
Hooligan.  It's been a while since he's been out on the show, but no worry
- Hooligan always comes correct with the nasty dark techstep with a
sprinkle sprinkle here and there of something off the wall.

Timeslots:
07-08pm EST - Intro Hour w/ ODJ
08-09:30pm EST - DJ Twist
09:30-11pm EST - Hooligan
11-12am+ EST - Outro Hour w/ ODJ

No Jerel here this week, as he's up in PA takin care of some shit.  He
should be back next week.

Audio, Video, and Chat links for the show are always available at
http://dirtboxradio.com/listen.html

Make sure to check out the new webcam.  This one's actually legible :)

Here's a sneak peak at our upcoming guest slots (some dates may change,
check website for updated slots):
Jan 18: Bizar, Haaps
Feb 01: Akasha, Shade
Feb 08: 2Charming Crew
Feb 15: RsonisT, Ransom
Feb 22: Cam One, Psykofly
Feb 29: Taysty, Simetra

If you'd like to play on Dirtbox Radio, or have us air a mixset or track
of yours, just send an email to myself (odj@dirtboxradio.com) or Jerel
(jerel@baked.net), and we'll sort ya out.

Aight then, I'll see you cats at 7pm.  Take it easy!

Jackson aka ODJ

Partners in Crime, www.DirtboxRadio.com, Trividual Productions, ALIAS

Subject: Re: [sfraves] joe's tale...continued...:) nrr

okay. . .

well I gotta critique ya just a lil here. . .
I've been reading these, and I always got a's on my book reports I'd make up
in english. . . so I figure I qualify sort of. . .

first, telling a story (well a good story). . . isn't just "telling" a
story. It's more like capturing the entire experience of the event with
words, so to bring the events feelings, thoughts, actions n such to life for
the audience.
You need to be more descriptive. Don't jump from scene to scene, but slowly
flow thru them. Is Joe naked with his hat on ?  Howd he get dressed ?
Your story is missing a lot of important information. Especially from day to
day. . .

Whats the point of the story ? Usually near the beginning of the book you
can somewhere read pieces that somewhat hint as to the point of the journey,
etc. . .
Is this the day to day life of JOE ? Surely he eats, slipps in the bathroom,
has neighbors, made toast and caught his house on fire. . . maybe joe needs
a gay stripper roomate who always comes home with drama. . .

I think one of the major reasons people get annoyed with stories like these,
because it seems like "off the topp of my head" 5 seconds of thought when it
comes out so short and not really thought thru. Take more time to develop
your story and then write it. Don't be afraid to describe EVERYTHING. . . in
fact, thats always more interesting. . .

and I guess all of this only applies if you're NOT writing a childrens book.
But then still. . .joe could be this sly party squirrel or something like
that.

put some effort into it mann. . . from reading your writings for years, I'm
totally confident that you have a good mind for creating stories n such. . .
you just need to develop em more and flow thru better. . .

make it fun for us too. . .

: )

What this says to me is that too many whites are getting away with drug
use, too many whites are getting away with drug sales, too many whites
are getting away with trafficking in this stuff. The answer to this
disparity is not to start letting people out of jail because we're not
putting others in jail who are breaking the law. The answer is to go out
and find the ones who are getting away with it, convict them and send
them up the river, too."

- Rush Limbaugh. October 5, 1995 show transcript.

KZSU Radio or Stanford University." (or words to that effect.)

That's a big reason for the impending bill -- to ensure that the "offensive" 
words can't be used in any context, despite what another government agency may 
allow.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] joe's tale...continued...:) nrr

Well said, and good advice.  Here's a bit from the beginning of perhaps the
best 1st chapter ever written, as an example:

The Deliverator belongs to an elite order, a hallowed subcategory.  He's got
esprit up to here.  Right now, he is preparing
to carry out his third mission of the night.  His uniform is black as
activated charcoal, filtering the very light out of the air.
A bullet will bounce off its arachnofiber weave like a wren hitting a patio
door, but excess perspiration wafts through it like
a breeze through a freshly napalmed forest.  Where his body has bony
extremeties, the suit has sintered armorgel: feels like
gritty jello, protects like a sack of telephone books.
    When they gave him the job, they gave him a gun.  The Deliverator never
deals in cash, but someone might come after
him anyway--might want his car, or his cargo.  The gun is tiny, aero-styled,
lightweight, the kind of gun a fashion designer
would carry; it fires teensy darts that fly at five times the velocity of an
SR-71 spy plane, and when you get done using it,
you have to plug it into the cigarette lighter, because it runs on
electricity.
    ....
    The Deliverator's car has enough potential energy packed into its
batteries to fire a pound of bacon into the Asteroid
Belt.  Unlike a bimbo box or a Burb beater, the Deliverator's car unloads
that power through gaping, gleaming, polished
sphincters.  When the Deliverator puts the hammer down, shit happens.  You
want to talk contact patches?  Your car's
tires have tiny contact patches, talk to the asphalt in four places the size
of your tongue.  The Deliverator's car hsa big
sticky tires with contact patches the size of a fat lady's thighs.  The
Deliverator is in touch with the road, starts like a bad
day, stops on a peseta.

Subject: [sfraves] (nrr) a very strange dream last night ... 

ok, ok, ok, so i had this really *weird* dream last night.  first of 
all, i set my alarm for 5:30, intending to get up early and have 
breakfast before work.  well, i stayed up late and it turned out i just 
hit the alarm clock off button, and went back to sleep.  and that's 
when i had the weird dream ...

i was starring in a tv show with leonard nimoy, you know, mr. spock?  
well he wasn't mr. spock, or so i thought, he was playing, i guess some 
normal dude, and god only know what i was doing there.  then all of a 
sudden, he said, "curious.  i have surmised that we are actually in a 
star trek episode ... i looked at him like what the hell is he talking 
about ... then all of a sudden, we all changed into vulcans!  i 
remember there was someone else there, and i had to give them a little 
counseling, like saying "you know, i think he may be on to something, 
he may be right, we really are in a star trek episode ... but it'll be 
ok."

and then the dream was over, i was woken up by the second alarm at 6am.

i think there's two reasons i had this dream, one i watched enterprise 
last night, which i haven't in a while, and i went to a friend's house 
who has a sega dreamcast, and he has a *really* strange game called 
Seaman, where you grow this fish looking thing into a life form that 
crawls out of the water, presumably like our ancestors did, i guess.  
anyway, that game had leonard nimoy's voice in the beginning.  has 
anyone played that?  how bizarre, huh?  any dream interpreters in da 
house?

anyway, it's 50 degrees today, but it should be dropping down to 20 and 
snowing by thursday.

Hello SFR friends!
 
I want to thank you all so very much for a wonderful turn out last Thursday! I can really feel our party coming together and a true "family" feeling emerging. It's so great to be meeting everyone from the list and realize what beautiful shining stars you all are, inside and out. There truly is a feeling of home here that I have been searching for ever since I left Florida and very happy to have found it once again. You guys are the best and I look forward to many more parties and adventures with you! Keep on shining and don't let life's little dramas ever get you down. 
 
love and light~
heidi

Subject: [sfraves]Technics: How would you ship them?

Have any of you had to ship your technics to Europe?  I am wondering what 
service I should use, and how I should pack them. I have the original boxes, 
so I can use them, I just don't want my tables damaged!

Thanks.

I'd use the original boxes as they were designed for exactly that purpose.
If you decide not to use the boxes, make sure you pack the platter seperately
from the rest of the deck.  If you ship it on the spindle you can really
end up horking the spindle.

Cheaper, possibly, but, it just seems like such a pain in the ass, I'd like 
to hear what the rest of y'all think bout this.  Besides, I feel kinda 
connected to my tables considering I bought them just this summer...and for 
a great deal!

Subject: Re: [sfraves]Technics: How would you ship them?

heya

I've shipped like civic parts n stuff to japan and dealt with australia,
canada, europe. . .
You can do the stuff online att like www.ups.com or www.usps.com

overseas shipments cost almost twice the price with UPS rather than USPS
since it has to be 2 nd day air or faster

usps to japan for about 50 or so pound was like $71, and he recieved it in
around 2 weeks. .  .
UPS was $186. ..

To pack em,
first I'd get some good bubblewrap and a good box that fit both of em,
level, sort of on top of eachother.Put both tables in some type of plastic
bag for dust n such, then wrap both tables (with covers I assume, put the
carts in their cases or something, and secure everything) in the bubble wrap
covering all sides. Then padd the bottom of the box a lil and drop it in.
Put some more bubble wrap on top of that and then use a square sheet of
cardboard the same size as the box (lXw). . .on that, make sure the table
fits snug yknow. . .add some packing something or other to take up the
space. . .
So with the other table, put a lil bubbleshit on the carboard sheet. . . and
drop the other table in. . . pack as necessary. . . if you have ortofons or
something just put them in the cases and somewhere in the box. . . pack it
really tight, like so you shake the box and nothing moves. . .

then tape the hell out of it, but not so as to attract suspicion of
terrorism or anything like that. . .

Theres a company, THARCO, that makes "corrugated shipping containers". Its
like a couple blocks from where I live.I cant find their catalog but just
call 411 and get their number. It's in San Lorenzo. They're open 24hrs, and
accept small orders of just a couple boxes to bundles. . . if you want a
really strong box use the doublewall ones they have.
figure,
a single Technic, is what , like

  a.. Width: 17-13/16"
  b.. Height: 6-5/8"
  c.. Depth: 14-1/4"
  d.. Weight: 26.4 lbs
So get one box thats like 22x18x18, and a sheet of semi-thick 22x18" sheet
of cardboard. . .
guess like total weight of around 54lbs. . .
the cardboard will cost like $3-4, n all sorts of places have bubblewrap and
tharco prolly also has all sorts of packing materials. . .

you can get shipping quotes on both the ups and usps website.
be sure to insure it for like 8-900 or so. . .
Theres post offices and ups stores everywhere too. . . you'll probably have
to fill out all sorts of forms n such. . . you can prolly do it all for less
than $95.

but you can skip most of that if you just go to your local friendly audio
shoppe and beg them to give you two boxes from demos or something like that.
. .

: )

Subject: [sfraves] Bam!!!

--=====================_27185540==.ALT
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"; format=flowed

I haven't seen Afrika Bambaataa perform for some time, and having Bam come 
to the intimate environment of Club 6 was a very big deal for me.  Angel 
has been doing wonderful things with that venue:  the Legends of House 
series; quality hip hop and turntablist parties; and a variety of other 
musical styles, both old school and new, that make 6 a place where many 
things are coming together musically.

This was one of the best-attended parties I've ever been to at 6.  Dancers 
were jammed onto that hot, sweaty floor.  A few rather aggressive types 
near the turntables, but for the most part the crowd was respectful...and 
enthusiastic.

It has been some time since I've been to a dance event where people were 
waving their arms, screaming as each new track was laid down, and singing 
to lyrics.  Yep...lyrics:  some going back more than twenty years.  The 
often disco infused hip hop, breaks and electro were so refreshing.   Music 
that people really dance to.  Funky.  Soulful.

Bam comes from the same roots that I do:  that maelstrom of musical 
innovation that was NYC in the seventies.  Hip hip and disco leveraged off 
of the same musical roots, as did house music later on, and there was much 
intermixing of black R&B and the like on all underground seventies dance 
floors.  Larry Levin, myself and some friends often went to sound system 
and MC battles in the Bronx where Bam and his Zulu Nation crew would go off 
against other now famous hip hop artists.  At one point he promoted a party 
as I recall with Kool Herc.

Hearing Bam again, and seeing the reaction of the crowd, was, as I told a 
friend on the ride home, like Paul being struck off his horse on the way to 
Tarsus.  I have been becoming progressively bored and disenchanted with the 
direction most "progressive" dance music is taking lately.  Much of it is, 
yes, technically solid as are the performers but it seems as though soul 
has been replaced with an icy intellectualization of the whole dance floor 
ecology.  As one producer in Boston wrote on another list recently:  "I 
hate dancing.  I like to rave."  He writes and produces "dance" music.

This personal epiphany has been building over the past few months.  I go to 
"Get Freaky" and see displaced psytrance people dancing wildly to Adam 
Freeland who is spinning...well...can one really say "breaks?"  That set 
was all over the place, and at the same party was a hip hop room.  Kids 
digging Jesse Saunders and singing along to "I Want Your Body."  The new 
Steve Lawler release has remixes of stuff I haven't heard for years.

So I'm going back to my roots again.  As with most musically innovative 
times, those who wish to move forward build on the past.  Only one being is 
alleged to have made something from nothing.  In the beginning there were 
no genres.  Time for me, at least, to start seriously looking at the music 
that made and makes people shout and dance.

Love,

Apollo

Subject: Re: [sfraves]Technics: How would you ship them?

oh yeah,

in order not to hork the spindle. . . you should remove the platters and
wrap them seperately. . .I forgot the'yre not screwed on. . .
buy a couple more single sheets and pack them in between those. . . make the
box a lil taller. . .

yknow I horked my knee a couple times. . . I have a video of one of em. . .

shit, if ya want, just give me like $45 + shipping, and drop the tables off
to me. . . I'll ship em and supply you with the tracking info n such. . .

Subject: RE: [sfraves] Bam!!!

Good to hear he had that effect on the crowd and yourself...Bam has that way 
about him, he just melds everything into dancefloor funk and gets people 
moving. I'm happy to see alot of producers now are shedding the "genre" skin 
and playing with different sounds, because (at least all the music I've been 
buying lately) is more funk oriented, and made to move asses and 
dancefloors. Everything from breaks ot house, and even progressive has a 
much more gritty and sexy sound...made for that primal energy.

Gotta love that....

Subject: RE: [sfraves] [Roll Call] California's Premier Winter Music Festival

i think it's pretty funny that this is being billed as a "premier festival" 
when the only headliners that i can recognize as not being local (or from 
LA) are the Warp Brothers.  atleast 2/3 of the DJs listed have played one or 
more times at a local party in the last month.  so what will make this a 
festival?

i mean, i'm sure people will have fun...but will it really be that much 
bigger or better than any of the other events that go on in the bay all the 
time?

I don't get it.  This lineup is nothing to write home about (and mind you,
it has a couple of my friends on it... but "premier festival" material
it's not).  Hell, a couple of the DJs hailing from LA are using the same
DJ names as established DJs from years back, but it's not them!

Are you on someone's payroll as a 'street marketer' or something?

well, if michael gets nekkid around him, maybe he'll pack his bags and 
move back to whence he came.

there's always hope.

Whether raves stays underground or not people like you and I will interact 
with others outside of raves. And by being a positive example you are infact 
making an impact.

Raves are great, and so are the cool people that make it happen(that 
includes the people that shows up).

This website is funny because it reminds me of a heated debate i once had
with a friend of mine who is a hardcore christian. See i always felt very
strongly that the rave scene was this gathering of masses, in tribal spirit, 
the
essense the vibe the spirituality all accumilating growing growing growing
throughout the populance of the world, which could eventually have potential 
to
overthrow the establishment and create a new utopian world (new age of 
aquarious
type of deal) most ravers tho would argue that raves are supposed to be
underground and they're supposed to take u away from the worlds proplems not 
fight
against them as   a "movement". Anyways when i brought this idea up to my 
friend
(the christian) he was disgusted by it. the thought of raves accumilating
massively throughout the world, because to him, this was discribed in the 
bible
like in revelations or what not. it was said that nations would unite under 
a
false prophecy, and this would be a sign of the anti-christ. the drugs the
orgies the false sense of utopia, we were supposedly warned of all of this 
and
we're supposed to know it means the end is near. me i don't buy it, it sure 
as
hell interests me because it's so intense, i'd like to study it more or have 
some
of ya'll sfr's enlighten me if u have knowledge on this topic.... but if i
were inclined to believe anything as of now, i'd say that christ was 
manifested
in the spirit of raving because it's like setting people free. to say that 
god
was disgusted by raves, sounds like a hidden agenda to me...

Subject: Re: [sfraves]Technics: How would you ship them?

I've owned a few pair of 1200s since I learned to spin when I was 15.  I sold 
the first pair before I left for boot camp.

I took my last pair with me on the plane.  I took one of them as a carry on, 
and the other was inside a softsided luggage surrounded by clothes.  They BOTH 
were contained inside airline approved hard cases.  These are heavy but they 
protect the turntables.

The time before this last move, I took one on as a carry on inside the flight 
case, and a friend brought the other one over with her when she came on a later 
flight.

Subject: [sfraves] Hearing on Youth Entertainment Crisis 

--=====================_1188228==.ALT
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"; format=flowed



WHAT:  Call for Action!

WHERE:  City Hall, Room 250

WHEN:  Thursday, January 15th, 5 pm

WHY:  San Francisco has few entertainment options for youth under 21

Hello!


My name is Liam Shy and I am the Youth Action Coordinator for the SFLNC.  I 
am also on the San Francisco Youth Commission, a city commission designed 
to advise the Mayor and Board of Supervisors on youth related issues in San 
Francisco.

I am 19 years old and a DJ.  When my favorite producers come to San 
Francisco, they only play in 21+ clubs.  Why?  Because there are almost no 
18+ entertainment venues in San Francisco and the few that exist have to 
close at 2 am.  Other major US cities, such as  New York, Los Angeles, and 
Seattle all allow 18+ parties to go past 2 am.

Last year, Mark Leno introduced legislation sponsored by the SFLNC to allow 
18+ entertainment events to go after-hours.  The legislation was passed by 
the Board of Supervisors but was then vetoed by then Mayor Willie

Brown.  This year the Youth Commission has made passage of this legislation 
one of its top priorities and we have worked with the SFLNC and Supervisor 
Bevan Dufty to produce a new draft of legislation to allow for 18+ 
after-hours events.

In December, the Youth Commission passed a resolution declaring San 
Francisco in a "public health crisis" over the lack of safe recreation and 
entertainment options for youth under 21.  As we all know, fun and safe 
recreational spaces help to keep youth out of trouble .  The serious 
deficiency that exists in San Francisco negatively impacts the mental and 
physical health of our youth, especially youth in at-risk communities.

There is already a serious deficiency in fun programming for young 
adults.  This will only get worse if proposed cuts in the Recreation and 
Parks Department budget become a reality.  In fact, the only youth led late 
night program, a City sponsored Hip-Hop dance party called Park Sessions, 
has already been put on hold.  If we don't stop the disproportionate cuts 
to Rec and Parks, hope of bringing back Park Sessions or creating new 
programs will be lost.

This hearing will be a chance for us to show City Hall how important 
recreation and entertainment is for youth!  Everyone is encouraged to 
attend and speak out on their vision for youth recreation and entertainment 
in San Francisco.

"We are the voice of the future, but that doesn't mean we can't change the 
present!" -Youth Commission Rec
and Services Committee

Sweet! Alot of their newer stuff has been pretty damn good. Of course I've 
only heard a few releases from their upcoming "Legion of Boom" cd. 
Specifically the track "Starting Over" which is like buttah...as is the 
Elite Force remix of it. Good stuff.

Subject: [sfraves] BSP: An Epiphany Of Sound tomorrow

Progressive is the word of the week.  (So I guess I'll also have to
point people of the other progressive persuasion to these tribes on
tribe.net: http://bushisthefakepresident.tribe.net,
http://secularhumanism.tribe.net).  Anyway, keeping with the word of the
week I'll be hosting DJs Jack Triumph and Illiaster for two hours (yeah,
a shorter show this quarter) of assadelic progressive house on An
Epiphany of Sound tomorrow between 9a and 11a.  DJ Illiaster provides
the nitro kickoff to the show at 9a and then Jack Triumph follows at
10a.  No coffee necessary (except in writing this BSP.)

Ticket giveaways for you wonderful peeps, as usual!  Be sure to tune in
at 90.1 FM in the bay area or online at http://kzsulive.stanford.edu if
you can't pick us up over the air.  Maybe I'll force them to each play a
track or two from my crate to see how they work it!

Talk atcha tomorrow!

What this says to me is that too many whites are getting away with drug
use, too many whites are getting away with drug sales, too many whites
are getting away with trafficking in this stuff. The answer to this
disparity is not to start letting people out of jail because we're not
putting others in jail who are breaking the law. The answer is to go out
and find the ones who are getting away with it, convict them and send
them up the river, too."

Subject: [sfraves] Original music contest

Say, does anyone remember a link to a contest where some record
label (I think) was looking for original music submissions for a
compilation album that they were planning to put out?  I just searched
forever and can't find any reference to it, and I can't find any
reference to it in the archives.  Did I dream it?  I DISTINCTLY remember
that the length of the track had to be 4:20 or less (from my memory of
what was on the web page.)

-- 
What this says to me is that too many whites are getting away with drug
use, too many whites are getting away with drug sales, too many whites
are getting away with trafficking in this stuff. The answer to this
disparity is not to start letting people out of jail because we're not
putting others in jail who are breaking the law. The answer is to go out
and find the ones who are getting away with it, convict them and send
them up the river, too."

- Rush Limbaugh. October 5, 1995 show transcript.

"Opinions are my own only, and do not necessarily represent those of
KZSU Radio or Stanford University." (or words to that effect.)

What this says to me is that too many whites are getting away with drug
use, too many whites are getting away with drug sales, too many whites
are getting away with trafficking in this stuff. The answer to this
disparity is not to start letting people out of jail because we're not
putting others in jail who are breaking the law. The answer is to go out
and find the ones who are getting away with it, convict them and send
them up the river, too."

Yeah, remember, he used to go by Sparcotrip.

What this says to me is that too many whites are getting away with drug
use, too many whites are getting away with drug sales, too many whites
are getting away with trafficking in this stuff. The answer to this
disparity is not to start letting people out of jail because we're not
putting others in jail who are breaking the law. The answer is to go out
and find the ones who are getting away with it, convict them and send
them up the river, too."

Subject: [sfraves] WARP downloads

http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/6/34896.html

"Pioneer British electronic label Warp Records has struck a blow for
computers users by making its entire back catalog available for download
- unencumbered by the toxic DRM restrictions that the pigopolists insist
on."

-- 
What this says to me is that too many whites are getting away with drug
use, too many whites are getting away with drug sales, too many whites
are getting away with trafficking in this stuff. The answer to this
disparity is not to start letting people out of jail because we're not
putting others in jail who are breaking the law. The answer is to go out
and find the ones who are getting away with it, convict them and send
them up the river, too."

- Rush Limbaugh. October 5, 1995 show transcript.

"Opinions are my own only, and do not necessarily represent those of
KZSU Radio or Stanford University." (or words to that effect.)

aslo if you guys are calling me raciest then how come i have this nice 
beautifully girl in my life that is Indian and Japanese. And I live in that overseas 
in Japan it was a blast. 

:-)

I was not saying this to be mean or to dis respect any nation or color I love 
Japanese, chines, etc., and all the colors ... sorry if that was raciest how 
I said it but I did not mean to do no wrong... 

Also yes I am sparcotrip :-) from SFraves... and yes my image should be on 
there and why did you get sparkles?

I remember his picture on the SFr site:  "oooh!  I've got
Sparkles coming out of my fingers!"

seriously though, calling Japanese people "japs" is like calling
Vietnamese "gooks," and Chinese "chinks" or "chinamen."

Warren, maybe somebody knows the answer, but sfraves.com has nothing to do 
with THIS SF Raves, the mailing list.  sfraves.com is a commercial site; 
sfraves@hyperreal.org and this mailing list are not.

Because it's sfraves.org

SFRaves.com was an attempt I think by Vitaly (of VORG fame) to create a
rave related virtual community they could profit from... and present their
events in a better light.  Kinda like some other rave community resources
out there.  But I won't spill the beans cause it's so easy to figure out
on your own anyway.

i didn't call you a racist.  all i said was i'd appreciate if people on the 
list didn't use that word in refernce to people of the same ethnic 
background as myself.  but hey, you or anyone can use whatever language you 
want, i can't stop ya.  i was asking.

and i don't know about your girl, but i don't think she or her parents would 
much appreciate you referring to japanese as "japs."  can you imagine that?  
goin over to your girls parents place and bein like "whuttup japs!?"

oops.

Oh, if I had to guess, I'd say that both of the above statements are 
complete bullshit.  You got caught making racist slurs on a public 
list, and now you're making up lies in order to try cover for your 
sorry ass.  Michael is 100% correct.  Referring to Japanese people as 
"japs" is exactly like calling black people "niggers", jews "kikes", 
italians "wops", arabs as "towel-heads", and plenty more.  All of these 
are the hallmark of racist trash who have no place anywhere on the 
internet, or in any civilized society.

This reminds me of a rather heated arguement I got into, elsewhere, 
earlier this week; over my observation that the statement: "I am not a 
homophobe/racist/sexist/anti-semite/etc., BUT" (emphesis mine), is 
almost invariably the preamble to a statement that is reprehensibly 
homophobic, racist, sexist, anti-semetic or etc.

People who *really* are not racist/homophobic/sexist/etc. don't have to 
tell anyone as much.  They simply don't behave or speak like one.


cya,
john

I've generally found that just because someone is fucking someone from a =

but that's a whole nother can o worms...I've never tried living inside a =

B.S.  It's gotten to the point where you have to appologize (i.e. I'm not
racist, but) before you tell
a good joke anymore.  We're all brainwashed by Political Correctness to the
point that anything
that might just maybe possibly be "insensitive" is a no no.  What you're
saying may be true sometimes,
but certainly not all the time by ANY stretch of the imagination.  We are
not all the same, and the
sooner we all get to grips with this FACT the better off we'll all be.  Most
differences are a good
thing, and keep life interesting and unique.  There's nothing wrong with not
being blind to them,
and there's a LOT wrong with ignoring them just to pretend everyone's the
same.  Any person
with common sense should be able to suss out the derogatory / racist etc.
motivated speak from
the rest.  Any person who can't and gets offended at the drop of a hat needs
a clue.

Ha.. I have heard em all.. Joekenfold, Studio DJ, etc..

But I have never seen him live so I am stoked to go.. it has been like 2 
years since my last show.. I feel like I am in a 12 step program.. hello.. 
my name is Ranger.. and I am a recovering raver.
I hope it kicks much ass.

I bought these tickets online that you can print out, so sweet.. what a 
great idea.  Drop in some cardstock in the color laser printer and they look 
really dope.. they will probably think they are fake.. lol.

Anyone else going?

Not gonna hate, 'cause he is big-time (isn't that what most dj's want, the
big venues?) - but, I saw him at once in a blue moon, decent set...but the
worst shit is the he had someone hand him his next record, like he was too
big to go through the bin himself...he plays alright, little trancey for my
taste. Hope you enjoy.

totally NRR, but does anyone have suggestions for online shopping cart 
providers for a very small business?

not something like paypal where shoppers navigate away from your page, but 
something that you can integrate with your pages so it looks somewhat 
professional.

LOL now that is just good..

People in the midwest and east coast come up with some of the STUPIDEST DJ's 
names you can ever imagine.. But pickle juice is pretty good.. hehehe.. I 
don't care how good you are.. I personally (if I were still doing parties) 
would never Book a guy that goes by pickle juice it just sounds stupid..


hmm other good midwest DJ names I have heard:

DJ Acidpimp
DJ donut
DJ Donut Humper
Doormouse  (Though he is a Solid Jock)


and any other DJ name that has a drug reference in theme..

DJ E
DJ Extasy
DJ X-tasy
Mr. E  (heheh ok I had to throw that one in, but it stood for Mr. Eric "AKA 
Mystrie")

I will agree with you on the line you said "But the PC thing is fucking weak" 
it is really weak to bitch over Internet bullshit such as people are. I did 
not do not wrong in my book it was just a mess up and now people are saying all 
this over me saying Jap *short for Japanese" 
I love everyone the same and would not want to do no harm.

Well, I am off to put my nose in the Records and mix my pain away from this 
list is becoming drama field and I am a reason from some of the drama but I did 
not mean to bring any harm. 

:-) 

*sights*............... "I love you SFraves E-mail people"

-warren

Gonna have to agree on that there...this country is WAY too oversensitive 
About labels. I do think that people take shit too far sometimes, but the PC 
Thing is fucking weak.

Subject: [sfraves] bsp-TECHNO BOMBINGS SCHEDULED THRU WEEKEND!!! 


Just looked at my calendar, and oh dear... it appears Techno Bombings Are
Scheduled throughout the weekend, please stay indoors and close to a
speaker awaiting further instructions.  That's right boys and girls, after
a bit of a hiatus from proper techno asskicking sessions, I'm making up
for it this weekend with a spazzed out closing set on Saturday (new club
featuring a diet of techno with a side of techno-hyphenations... I'm
almost sure America can handle it!) and a peak hour treatment on Sunday
served with a side of Clarity and appetizer and dessert sets from
Progression's resident pr0gmongers.  Monday's a day off for many of you so
I don't wanna hear no whawha.  Do the right thing, your ass needs techno.

Saturday = HUGGER-MUGGER @ Lit

DJs:   Juan Segovia(tech-on)
Andy W (viberation/refined music/tech-on)
Chameleon (high jinx/tech-on)

Lit Lounge is located at 101 6th St. at Mission, San Francisco. Admission
is Free so there is NO excuse!
Tunes from 9pm to 2am.
http://www.tech-on.com


Sunday = PROGRESSION @ 26 MIX

AndyW (viberation/resourcerecords/refinedmusic)
Clairity (Teknotika SF. )

Subject: [sfraves] nrr - i rode a segway (review)


i rode a segway @ disneyland a few weeks ago.

http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B00007EPJ6/qid=1074295654//ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i8_xgl23/102-9719423-6680102?v=glance&s=electronics&n=507846


it was everything i was hoping for and more.  it only took me a about a minute to get used to the balance and controls.

i totally loved it!  it was so fun.  now all i can think of is how can i save up $4500 so I can buy one.

it was very responsive and intuitive.  the interface was as basic as can be.

my one regret was that i did not get to test it on the different terrains that it is designed to handle.

to the future *lifts glass in a toast*

you must have ridden one of the refurbished ones.  they did a recall because when the batteries got low, they tended to "buck" the user off as the gyroscope didn't work so well.
 
i still want one, but i'll wait til they're a grand or so.  should be about 3 years.

PUNK THE VOTE
Glenn BurnSilver, Fort Collins Weekly
With punkvoter.com, punk music star Mike Burkett seeks to
change the shape of American politics. But will a few
thousand societal outcasts make a difference? Burkett
thinks so.

"Security is mostly a superstition.  It does not exist in nature, nor do 
the children of humans as a whole experience it.  Avoiding danger is no 
safer in the long run than outright exposure.  Life is either a daring 
adventure or nothing."
-Helen Keller

"Beware of being too rational.  In the country of the insane, the 
integrated man doesn't become king.  He gets lynched."
-Aldous Huxley, Island

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the 
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become 
visible."
-Jacques Attali in his seminal text "Noise"

As many of you may know already, Mirage first appeared as a Wednesday club =
night here in San Jose. Unfortunately, as with many nightclubs in the scene=

e night vanished just before winter. Recently, we were told that Mirage wil=
l once again take shape in February. All who were involved with Mirage will=
 return to help recreate the magic and build a safe-haven for its reappeara=
nce. As the prophets give us more information, we will forward the details =
to you. Returning to the source of power are Mirage resident DJs: Michael L=
iu (Illumination Records), Denise (Sound Asylum), Dragn'fly (Shaolin), Maje=
re (Elektrosorcery), and Proteus (Vibe Rite). Crisp clean concert sound pow=
ered by Logik Pro. Much more information to follow on this all ages event..=

Subject: [sfraves] SRR: House parties...

Tonight was another reminder of why I love house parties. Good ol' Jack 
Triumph persuaded me a week or so ago to meet him in Fremont for a lil' 
shindig his friend's were throwing, and it turned out ot be a fun time. Of 
course the fact that I to to spin made it that much better ( I've only been  
spinning maybe once every month or so since i got here due to faulty 
equipment and tight budget). Either way tho, it was a fun time...and godamm 
if JT doesn't pull out all the stops. He's got a great and varied track 
selection, and the skills to play 'em. It's always a pleasure.

Anyhoo...my night ends on a good note! Hope to see some of you's out and 
about tomorrow night. Perhaps at either the Old Skool jammy at DNA, or maybe 
at that super hush hush (not really) breaks party happening in SF.

Subject: [sfraves] top of her game, miss jane :) nrr

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

hello, this is simply a continuation of a fictional piece that we are using our space to post, for your pleasure alone, of course:
 
she was at the top of her game, as they say. freshly cropped do, short and friendly, a little tired and bleary eyed, but things were definately different now. laura picked up the telephone, sank back into the old brown couch, and dialed with a smile when she heard a familar footstep on the stairs. she was at the top of her game, and today, she would not be giving it up to miss jane. she sunk down low in her seat, shut the phone off, and didn't hardly stir. :)

Subject: [sfraves] 12 Hr Adventure w/ a =) Ending: Sat Night!

OK... so I wake up like around 1 something & get this mondo message on my answering machine... it like totally took me hella long & alot repeats of the message 2 figure out it was Atomic (atawmic on SFR) who left the message, so i called him right away!  He told me that like he was on his way 2 my pad already & I was all... "Oh Wow.. OK... Bad Ass!!"  'Cause he said there was this Awesome shindig he wanted 2 go 2... la la la... so he comes over & we go...

4:30 PM ~~> We leave Skills & got presales 4 Cold Fushion... long story short (wait... can i really tell a short story?)... we got 2 Chabot College after this mondo drive all around Berk, Oak, & Hayward 'cause well... info line was updated & we were kinda goin' of Tom's (Slik) directions... so i called him @ the store & told him it wasn't @ the 1st place he said it was & he did this huge search online & found the location & gave us directions (It was so Groovy seein' him & talkin' 2 him again! We sooo had sooo much 2 catch up on =)  So yeah... we got there & like well..i dunno man... we stayed 4 like 3 hours i think & that whole time... all they had in all the inside rooms was like trance.... nothing wrong w/ that at all... it's jus' that well... shouldn't it be like diversified esp like @ an early time since ya know, people could choose like what room they wanna spin in?  I mean.. well... yeah.. it pretty much broke probably during the last part of our stay there 'cause well
 ... 1 room had jungle, another had NRG, another had house (w/ these awesome circle dancers)  

BUt another thing that kinda sucked was sound... 1 of the rooms was the gym... another was the cafateria... another room was a huge hallway room thingie... so yeah.. there was mondo reverbage in the rooms & it kinda made the bass do that echo bounce stuff like crazy... I mean... it was bearable 'cause i had ear plug which made it sound kinda normal... well.. maybe i'm prejudging 'cause we were there still early & left early & there wasn't that many people yet 2 fill the room to drown out the reverb echo stuff... but yeah.. that was a prob... i esp felt bad 4 Arson when he spn 'cause well... his jungle kinda sounded like trance 'cause it got 2 bass heavy in the room & the bass echo made his Jungle sound like trance... LoL  

But on the vibe tip... i did see alota people there & that made me happy!=)  yeah... i did dance a lil' also...

so then like we headed over 2 Sublounge 4 that Jungle thingaround like 10 Something PM... there was 1 DJ there that i really liked ummm... kid bippy i think his name is who was really Awesome =)  I also met some people og the Groundscore MB there... but i dunno... there wasn't that many people there & Atomic & did play video games 4 like 3/4th of the time there... it was still early though, but we left & headed out 2 Amnesia 4 Hemisphere...

OK...that was fun!!  LoL... it was crazy packed there... I mean.. this is like the only 3rd Hempishere i been 2 as long as it's been goin' on & I dunno... Valencia on a Sat night is pretty crazy, so yeah.. there were looooooooooooooooots of people there... it was fun tryin' 2 dance in therem but it was so mondo hard man... saw hella faces there & damn man... ziggy was Dope on the mic when some dude was there spinning.. i dunno who it was... but i guess Atomic wasn't feeling the vibe & there were hella people there who came from DNA & hella people who were still gonna go there from Amnesia... so Atomic suggested that we should go... & we did

Around 12:30- 1:00 AM we get 2 DNA Lounge 4 the 10 yr Anniversary thingie... Good Fuckin' Shit man.. heeeeeeeeeeeeeeella people in there... i mean... i have never been 2 DNA & it was that packed, well... maybe 1 tim.. no... it was waaaaay packed & man.. crazy!!  Jeno was on the decks & he was rockin' it fuckin hard man... jus' alota good ol fashion house & I think he mighta thrown in some breakbeats in there... but it was So Dope!  It was Groovy, i talk 2 him after his set & he was like caught up on the haps w/ each other... he told me this story about his son & how he's in a basketball league & how like he hmmmm... i couldn't get parts of the story 'we were talkin' right next 2 the monitor... but he said somehthing about it was like a Rave @ his son's game or something hmmm.. maybe he was talkin' about DNA... LoL

I also got 2 kick w/ Felix Woof Woof the dog & that was Groovy 'cause i don't see that dork enough.,... I was hella bummed that we missed his set... 

Hmmmmm... I danced a lil' here & there @ DNA... but I dunno man... there was jus' 2 many people there & stuff & it was hard 2 totally get my groove & be free on the floor like I wanted 2... I dunno... maybe I bein' a bitch or something... la la la... 

But serously though... I saw so much family there that night... I even saw people i ain't seen in soooooooooooooooooo long there it was Dope!  I mean... it kinda got 2 a point where like I started getting kinda teary eyed happy 2 C so many faces 2gether & stuff, but it was so damn <3 warming!

OK.. but what really totally mondo got me so more teary eyed happy was well.... early in the night @ DNA... there was this Dude there i kept poppin in2 & looked mondo familiar... hmmmmm... ok... so i'm outside like smoking & talkin' 2 people & bump in2 this guy again... i look @ him like strait in the eye & lol... the 1st thing he said 2 me was, "Finally U talk 2 me after i been seein' u 2night" & I was like "huh... Im confused... i know u.. right?"  Then we like hug & he asks me what my name is...

"Osby... I'm Osby Dude" I said as were hugging.\

"Ooooo shit, dude... what the fuck man.. long time so see Bro" he said as he hugged me tighter.

"Huh?" I said w/ a small laugh. "U still ain't told me your name homie."

"Osby... it's me Rocky!  Remember from waaaaaaay back in the day?" he said.

"Hello 2Day.. Oh Fuckin' A man.. Rocky!" I said like totallly happy!

See.. Rocky was some1 i started partying w/ when i started 9 years ago... we ain't seen each other  in like 7 years & shit so like Hello 2day... it was like sooooooooooooooo Awesome seein' him again after this whole time & it's kinda like full circle, symbolic, & ironic that him & I bumped in2 each other @ an event that celebrated the 10 yr anniversary of the DJs who spun or something like that... but yeah man... it was Dope!  I mean... Atomic & I were on the edge of leafing @ that time... but man... running in2 Rocky again... we kinda stayed like 1/2 hr- 45 minutes longer jus' talkin'!

4:30 AM... we on 80 almost 2 Hercules... I was still kind teary eyed happy in the car after bumpin' in2 Rocky... but yeah... it was a Bad Ass night =)  Man... i wish i brought my camera! =\  But yeah... Hello 2Day...happy ending... ok.. time 2 sleep.. my parents are down stairs havin' breakfast now & I should get some zzzzzzzzzzzs... Good Morning!

Take Care,
Peace-> ObY {8O)

Subject: [sfraves] Congress to Ban Marijuana Reform Ads - TAKE ACTION

ACTION ALERT: PROTECT FREE SPEECH AND YOUR WALLET

*** Congress to ban private advertising in support of marijuana law
reform *** At same time, Congress to spend $145 million in tax money on
govt.  anti-marijuana ads

In December, Rep. Ernest Istook, an Oklahoma Republican, snuck language
into a federal spending bill that will effectively ban private
advertising on buses, subways, or trains in support of marijuana law
reform - including campaign ads in support of medical marijuana ballot
measures. Worse still, the same bill also spends $145 million in
taxpayer money on anti-marijuana government propaganda. This federal
spending bill passed the U.S. House of Representatives late last year,
and the U.S. Senate will most likely vote on it next week.

If you haven't faxed your Senators yet, please do so today. While there
is only a small chance that we can stop this bill from passing (the
reason why drug war extremists snuck this censorship provision into it),
we need to show Congress that voters are outraged. We need to show that
we have your support and the support of the American people.

ACTIONS TO TAKE

1) Fax your Senators and tell them to protect free speech. You can fax
them for free at
http://actioncenter.drugpolicy.org/action/index.asp?step=2&item=13704&ms=achpfsad

2) Forward this alert to your friends, family, and co-workers. We need
thousands of Americans to fax Congress.

MORE INFORMATION

Every year Congress passes 13 federal spending bills providing money to
various federal agencies. Sometimes the House passes a spending bill
that is different from a bill the Senate passes. When that is the case,
Congress appoints what is called a "conference committee" to reconcile
differences between the two bills. This conference committee then sends
a final version of the bill to both the House and Senate for one final
up and down vote, with no chance for amendments. Members of the
conference committee frequently add controversial things to the spending
bill at the last minute, knowing that their colleagues won't vote
against an entire spending bill just because one thing in it is
controversial.

This year Congressional leadership decided to reconcile multiple
spending bills within one conference committee, producing a single
federal spending bill (known as an "omnibus" spending bill) to send to
the House and Senate floor for a final vote. This tactic allowed them to
slip in all sorts of controversial things they could not otherwise pass
into law. They know that Members of Congress are unlikely to vote
against such an omnibus funding bill just because they don't like some
of its parts.

During conference, House and Senate leaders loaded up the omnibus bill
(HR 2673) with dozens of controversial provisions. One such provision,
added by Rep. Ernest Istook Jr. (R-OK), would prohibit any transit
system that receives federal funds from running advertising for groups
that want to decriminalize or legalize marijuana. If enacted, it would
prevent drug policy reform groups from buying ad space on buses, trains,
and subways around the country. It would prevent us from getting our
message directly to the American people.

At the same time, the omnibus bill gives the Office of National Drug
Control Policy (ONDCP) $145 million to run anti-marijuana ads next year.
ONDCP has already spent taxpayer money on television commercials
comparing drug users to terrorists and claiming that smoking marijuana
will make you a pregnant rape victim, make you shoot your neighbor, or
make you run over little kids with your car. This year's ads could be
even more outrageous.

The omnibus spending bill was approved by the House last year and the
Senate will likely vote on the bill sometime during the week of January
19. Because the bill cannot be amended to remove the controversial
provisions, the only way to prevent them from becoming law is if a
majority of the Senate votes against the entire omnibus bill. While this
is very unlikely, it is possible.

The Drug Policy Forum of Massachusetts Coalition is urging voters to
contact their U.S. Senators and tell them to vote against the omnibus
spending bill because it was put together in an undemocratic manner and
contains provisions that suppress free speech.

You can fax your Members of Congress for free at

Not gonna happen.

It's so outrageously unconstitutional it'll be tested and never even
make the Supreme court. *Boy* will the judicial opinions be fun to
read, too. I'll keep an eye out for this one.

Stuff like this doesn't bother me. What bothers me, is some damn
idiot Congressman is stupid enough to waste time on it. There are
much bigger problems on our radar.

So why is it you have to do a patent search before you get a patent,
but Congress doesn't have to have a constitutionality test before
that pass idiot laws that can't *possibly* stand? Oh, don't answer
that. (sigh)

despite a huge alcohol and tobacco lobby, there are limits on how they can
advertise.  it's easy to limit consitutionally guaranteed freedoms if
we're doing it for the children or national security.

This is a little different, (if I userstand right) it's not about
about restricting alcohol advertisements but rather about
restricting speech (advertising) of any group lobbying to change
marijuana laws.

I've wondered for a decade what marijuana product ads would
look like...

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Congress to Ban Marijuana Reform Ads - TAKE ACTION

I really doubt there'll be much effect from something like this. It sounds a
lot like how during the Ed Rosenthal trial, how the court was attempting to
ban any defense of "for medical use" from any of the cases arguments. .
.Eventually tho the courts people lost their powerful message (Ed
Rosenthal), and lost the court battle as it rightly should.
I never watch news, but when I do see some type of newsx, or read about it,
it's all about corruption and judges trying to make up their own rules for
personal vendetta's . . .

Decision seems to me to somehow be ultimately decided by the state, which is
good. I think us people have lil power over national court and gov't
decisions, states seem to be more influenced by the taxpayers. . . but thats
just my thought.

Lil do people know but Nevada actually Legallized marijuana by popular vote
for a couple months. For a short time there was a somewhat commercialized
distribution of cannabis, street vendors, stores. . .There were several
commercial packaged cannabis products that were available. Just for a lil
bit tho. And this was maybe like 7-8 years ago. That tho, didn't really have
anything to do with medical use. . .it was reg sales. . . like cigs. . .

OCBC has a ton of info that's constantly updated about the local area
cannabis acts and the national movement.  Court trials, things like that.

The cool thing about all of this is that all the advocators, protectors,
fighters for the cannabis movement and medicinal use acts. . . they're
almost all totally local.
It's like the cannabis producers of the country, in the top 2-3 would be
"Oakland/ Bay area CA"

yknow when you're randomly driving and you smell like skunk green in the
air. . .

when is the last time you saw an actual skunk. . .

: )

Well, not sure what flavor of Kool-Aid everyone was into last night, =

the beginning of the night with a rough interpretation of techno and =
Ossby literally walking in as Jack was thinking 'man wouldn't oss dig =
this leftfield track'. Perhaps it was clairity and andyw laying down =
wicked [actual] techno sets, or Illiaster's 'creamfield's or bust' set. =
It could have been Bam sneaking in the back door so he didn't have to =
show his ID and then complaining the drinks were weak, lol. It could =
have been any number of people that I didn't expect to see, showing up =
to support; or, it could have been a great closing night to our little =
nino 'progression'. Whatever it was I think everyone agreed it worked.=20

Thanks for sending us out on a Bang. Much love out to our guests =
Clairity & AndyW for giving us evil progressive people an education in =
Techno.

Triumph and Company regenerate Feb. 27th for our new monthly on Friday's =
@ 26Mix, with special guest DJ Floorcraft. And yes, we are still calling =
it Progression; I think seeing as we're moving, it couldn't fit more.

ok ... i just added mine with a picture, and yes, i admit, it's about 3 
years old, and i'm too fat right now to have my current photo up there! 
  so wish me luck .. now two things, one, i could have sworn i put a 
profile up there before, second, i guess i just figured out that this 
profile list is different from the profile list on the sfr calendar 
side ...

Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in his own words:

Nonviolence means avoiding not only external physical violence but also 
internal violence of spirit. You not only refuse to shoot a man, but you 
refuse to hate him.

- Martin Luther King Jr.


I said to my children, "I'm going to work and do everything that I can do 
to see that you get a good education. I don't ever want you to forget that 
there are millions of God's children who will not and cannot get a good 
education, and I don't want you feeling that you are better than they are. 
For you will never be what you ought to be until they are what they ought 
to be.'

- Martin Luther King Jr., 1.7.68


I submit that an individual who breaks a law that conscience tells him is 
unjust, and who willingly accepts the penalty of imprisonment in order to 
arouse the conscience of the community over its injustice, is in reality 
expressing the highest respect for law.

- Martin Luther King Jr., "Letter From Birmingham Jail ", 4.16.63


In the end, we will remember not the words of our enemies, but the silence 
of our friends.

- Martin Luther King Jr., "The Trumpet of Conscience", 1967


We must learn to live together as brothers or perish together as fools.

- Martin Luther King Jr., "Remaining Awake Through A Great Revolution ", 
3.31.68


Whatever career you may choose for yourself -- doctor, lawyer, teacher -- 
let me propose an avocation to be pursued along with it. Become a dedicated 
fighter for civil rights. Make it a central part of your life. It will make 
you a better doctor, a better lawyer, a better teacher. It will enrich your 
spirit as nothing else possibly can. It will give you that rare sense of 
nobility that can only spring from love and selflessly helping your fellow 
man . Make a career of humanity. Commit yourself to the noble struggle for 
human rights. You will make a greater person of yourself, a greater nation 
of your country, and a finer world to live in.

- Martin Luther King Jr., 4.18.59


Our scientific power has outrun our spiritual power. We have guided 
missiles and misguided man.

- Martin Luther King Jr., "Strength to Love", 1963


A nation that continues year after year to spend more money on military 
defense than on programs of social uplift is approaching spiritual doom.

- Martin Luther King Jr., "The Trumpet of Conscience", 1967


Even if I knew that tomorrow the world would go to pieces, I would still 
plant my apple tree.

- Martin Luther King Jr., quoting Martin Luther


Freedom is never voluntarily given by the oppressor; it must be demanded by 
the oppressed.

- Martin Luther King Jr., "Letter From Birmingham Jail ", 4.16.63


I submit to you that if a man hasn't discovered something he will die for, 
he isn't fit to live.

- Martin Luther King Jr., 6.23.63


I refuse to accept the view that mankind is so tragically bound to the 
starless midnight of racism and war that the bright daybreak of peace and 
brotherhood can never become a reality... I believe that unarmed truth and 
unconditional love will have the final word.

- Martin Luther King Jr., Nobel Prize Acceptance Speech , 12.10.64


If you succumb to the temptation of using violence in the struggle, unborn 
generations will be the recipients of a long and desolate night of 
bitterness, and your chief legacy to the future will be an endless reign of 
meaningless chaos.

- Martin Luther King Jr., "Justice Without Violence", 4.3.57


It may be true that the law cannot make a man love me, but it can keep him 
from lynching me, and I think that's pretty important.

- Martin Luther King Jr., Wall Street Journal, 11.13.62


Never succumb to the temptation of bitterness.

- Martin Luther King Jr., "Strength to Love", 1963


Rarely do we find men who willingly engage in hard, solid thinking. There 
is an almost universal quest for easy answers and half-baked solutions. 
Nothing pains some people more than having to think.

- Martin Luther King Jr., "Strength to Love", 1963


The first question which the priest and the Levite asked was: "If I stop to 
help this man, what will happen to me?" But... the good Samaritan reversed 
the question: "If I do not stop to help this man, what will happen to him?"

- Martin Luther King Jr., "I've Been to the Mountain Top ", 4.3.68


The ultimate measure of a man is not where he stands in moments of comfort 
and convenience, but where he stands at times of challenge and controversy.

- Martin Luther King Jr., "Strength to Love", 1963


The hope of a secure and livable world lies with disciplined nonconformists 
who are dedicated to justice, peace and brotherhood.

- Martin Luther King Jr., "Strength to Love", 1963


The time is always right to do what is right.

Subject: [sfraves] event idea : music production get together

i think i proposed this idea awhile back, but i wanted to put it out there 
again.

for those of you that produce music or want to produce music, would you be 
interested in having a get-together of sorts where people can bring thier 
computers, tracks they've made, etc to share with one another?

say, on a saturday or sunday afternoon sometime?  if people chipped in a 
couple bucks we could get some beer, chips and snackies.

i have access to a space that we could do it.  might have to get a few 
folding tables and some chairs though.

anyone?

Subject: [sfraves] tribal house/drums/meditation music suggestions?

I am not sure what I am looking for.

It has to have great rhythm. Primal, meditative.. chanting is good.

I am looking for good birth music, I am having my daughter at home in March 
and last time I gave birth my typical house/jungle CD collection just didn't 
cut it. I ended up having my husband replay some african drumming cd over 
and over again.....

Anyone have any suggestions for good tribal rhythmic music?

thanks in advance!

Subject: [sfraves] One night in SF: attitudes vs. progressions

Sunday night I got invited to the premiere of a Bear party called Maul, but I almost got thrown out of the den. I guess I need more inhibitions.

This monthly (at the Cherry in SOMA) has house music and dancing. It was hot inside and the vibe was unfriendly. Lots of guys had their shirts off, though, and I was prepared for sweaty dancing because I had shorts under my jeans and a muscle-T, too. 

So at one point I guess I wanted to get mauled. I took my pants off, a big mistake at this party. Now if this sounds crazy, keep in mind that this was a gay bear party and everyone was shirtless. Plus I was wearing tennis shorts, not boxers (totally street legal). I started dancing until someone actually picked up my folded pants nearby. Dont know what they were looking for but I was upset about it.

So I grabbed my stuff, left the floor and headed to the chill room. I relaxed on the sofa. No one else was around. It was comfortable and I was tired. I cooled down, put my pants back on, and just sat there, quietly. Suddenly, the bouncer arrived in the chill room doorway. He asked if I was the guy who was lying around getting naked. I said, Yeah, whats up, I was in my shorts. Its hot in here. He said, The people up front have a problem with you. We have cops around here. 

I was fully dressed, so I just said, Hey, Im not cruising, whats the big deal. Im going to another party anyway.

They must have problems with hustlers and the vice squad. I left and Mr. Bouncer said, Come back next month. I just grinned because sometimes San Francisco does not seem liberated to me, just uptight. 

So I went over to 26Mix on Mission Street for the last Progression and had a damn fine time with the good people in a vibe of extreme comfort. Jack greeted me inside with a warm hug. Osby did the same outside (with Dahlia). Later, Brandon showed up and so did lots of other peeps! We had a good crowd. And AndyW was spinning the hard banging techno! Man, I had so much fun, dancing like a fool, but I didnt take my pants off this time.

I just wanted to say that I am so glad to be a part of the Sfraves communitywhere I always meet my people and have excellent dance adventures with no attitudes, just good intentions.

Please remember to greet new faces, and be friendly to strangers who might show up at our events. It makes the world a better place. PLUR, and keep your pants on in San Francisco.

Greg VP

Why not indeed, I'm kind of an anonymous member of
this mailing list, may be I should post some links to
my tunes.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] fill out/update yer profile!

What a great idea! People, jump on it! It's a new year, after all!

Recently, I was browsing through all of the profiles, reflecting on what a
talented, interesting group of people we have in the SFR community.

If I had my own company I would want to hire everybody.

I just had a photo shoot with a local photographer so I will create my
profile this week.

Subject: [sfraves] Refried Beans, Progression Review, & wet pants

So Sunday was like well... I really wanted 2 start working on my paper this weekend 4 school.. but well... i didn't... LoL

So after goin' 2 a lil' Fam Gathering w/ Atomic, then goin' 2 the airprt 2 pick up George NewStyleSound w/ Amber, I got dropped of @ 26 Mix 4 Progression... but I got hungry & like totally ate @ this MExcian resuraunt 1st like next door... mmmm.. yeah... I kinda stuffed myself there... but yeah... Delia was with me...  then I went in 2 26Mix & Jack Triupmh was on the decks playin' his proggy house but ok.. Hello 2Day.. when I got in... he said "Osby, This next tRacks 4 U" & he busted out this HELLO 2Day, so damn yummy Breatbeats track that I fuckin' Creamed over man!!!  Loved it!!!

Clarity went on next & spun this really Dope minimal techno set that I Loved!!  Oh MyGoodness man... it was really CooL 'cause like well... her set was pretty steady w/ this constant Groove... then she got kinda more heavy w/ he Tachno beats towards the end of her set, but still playin minimal stuff... Loved it!!!

Then ok... LoL.. Andy Went on & played house.. I mean.. it was like chill kinda house @ the begining i guess... but as his set progressed... his beats were getting harder & welll.. he may of slipped in a techno record or 2 in there... I could sworn i heard some electro in there... but i definetly heard some Ghetto Tek!!  I Loved his set!!

It was a fun time there @ Progreesion... alota people showed up & it was fun hangin' out, Mondo Groovy Vibe... the most trippiest thing was seein' 1 of my old bouncer homies from Blakes there after like hella years & shit man... it was Trippy 'cause we ain't seen each other like in 2 years & he happens 2 B homies w. Mr Triumph... so Dope!  BUt yeah.. it was a Groovy Vibe & I'm excited 4 the next 1!

Unfortunately... i didn't stay 4 AndyW's whole set 'cause well... Jaze came by & well... there was a car load of our friends who came along & couldn't exactly come inside... so we went 2 the beach instead, kept a pre lit fire burning, played in the water, & hung out w/ these guys from Europe who likes West Coast rap!

This has been 1 of the most Awesome Weekends I've had in a long time... I'm in all honesty... I'm still buggin' that I saw Rocky again after 7 years & man... so Dope... & yeah... I'm happy I got 2 hang out w/ Atomic again after a while... so yeah... I still thik i need 2 catch up on my sleep 7 work on my paper 4 class.. so Have a Groovy week every1! =)

Take Care,
Peace-> ObY {8O)

Its March 6th - 10th.
http://www.wintermusicconference.com

I know this list is mainly for SF, but I know a lot of you participate
in this so I thought I'd see what's up :)

I'm getting ready for WMC again this year, planning the Sisters
Unite IV Showcase, the Sister International Annual Meeting, and a few
other things. I think this year is going to be a lot of fun!

I'm also available for electro, breaks, and d&b gigs in Miami March 5th
- 10th. 

Let me know if any of you are doing events out there or planning on
attending!

Peace.

even though henry was the plainest of the plain, he had taste, and that made him interesting to tasteful people. it also made him the target of not so tasteful people for what he supposed was their reasoning, just the same, he only dated fashion models. :)

--=====================_6703358==.ALT

I received the email below from Patrick, who is on the list but couldn't 
post this.  The link will take you to an article published in the Chronicle 
this morning about an unethical local rap "promoter" who leaves in his wake 
destruction and, often, death.

I'm familiar with the guy's modus operandi.  Awhile back I asked an 
Armenian friend if I might rent his Church's hall in SF for a party.  I was 
told that had it not been for Cockerham I would have had a chance at the 
rental.  But there was gun play and a shooting when he threw a "thong 
party" there, and 2,000 people showed up for a venue that holds 500.

Dude's bad news for the legit, quality hip hop and rap community and makes 
obtaining venues more difficult for us all.

Love,

Apollo

"Security is mostly a superstition.  It does not exist in nature, nor do 
the children of humans as a whole experience it.  Avoiding danger is no 
safer in the long run than outright exposure.  Life is either a daring 
adventure or nothing."
-Helen Keller

"Beware of being too rational.  In the country of the insane, the 
integrated man doesn't become king.  He gets lynched."
-Aldous Huxley, Island

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the 
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become 
visible."

What this says to me is that too many whites are getting away with drug
use, too many whites are getting away with drug sales, too many whites
are getting away with trafficking in this stuff. The answer to this
disparity is not to start letting people out of jail because we're not
putting others in jail who are breaking the law. The answer is to go out
and find the ones who are getting away with it, convict them and send
them up the river, too."

- Rush Limbaugh. October 5, 1995 show transcript.

KZSU Radio or Stanford University." (or words to that effect.)

Subject: Re: [sfraves] WMC 2004

Is it just me, or WMC is getting more commerical and more retarded every 
year?

I remembered Ultra 2000 as if it was yesterday. I'd never seen so much 
excitement, and it was surreal to be dancing on the beach, with the sun 
shining over the beautiful Alantic.

Then when I went to Ultra 2002, it was like every other SoCal massive: 
confusing, aggravating, and a lot of standing around. Like any SoCal 
massive, it took half an hour to get from one stage to another.... The 
crowd no longer had any passion whatsoever, it was replaced with pure daze.

In any case, the afternoon pool parties were the best, chill and 
laid-back. I still like to talk about how John Digweed walked into the 
11th St Diner when I was there having breakfast @ 6am, or that time I 
ran into Peter Rauhofer on the street.... It might be more of a 
hit-or-miss nowadays, but WMC is still probably the most unique 
experience second to Burning Man.

I've been debating if I wanna go to WMC this year. If anything, it's a 
good excuse to catch up with my old friends @ BeatCamp.

Hope u'll have good time down there.

- Jeff

Hi, I made a photo album on Yahoo with some pics from Cold Phusion. My Yahoo 
address isn't on SFR so I forwarded it to this address. For some reason there 
are links on the page that don't work, so just click on the picture to get to 
the album. 
It wasn't the greatest party in the world, as you've probably heard by now. I 
still had fun though. The 3x6 sets were good because of the interaction 
between DJs. It was cool to see a live singer (Carrie) performing to James Dub's 
beats. Also, it was a nice change of pace to see live bands, but it was cold 
outside and I didn't stay out there very long. Tek Threat and RayD8 scratched in 
between the band performances, and they were good. Sound wasn't so hot inside 
-- like Osby said, it bounced around a lot. It would have been better with 
more people, for sure. Despite the hype on Bayraves, the event was not very well 
attended. Having more people there would have helped the vibe. 
I also went to the after party in Oakland -- just the downstairs of a 
familiar venue -- and that was fun. Went until about 5 am. Got some pictures of that, 
too, in the album.

Subject: [sfraves] nrr:  RIAA sues 532 more people

Record industry files 532 'John Doe' suits against music downloaders
TED BRIDIS, AP Technology Writer
Wednesday, January 21, 2004
2004 Associated Press

URL: sfgate.com/article.cgi?file=/news/a/2004/01/21/national1225EST0557.DTL

(01-21) 09:38 PST WASHINGTON (AP) --

The recording industry on Wednesday sued 532 computer users it said were 
illegally distributing songs over the Internet, the first lawsuits since a 
federal appeals court blocked the use of special copyright subpoenas to 
identify those being targeted.

The action represents the largest number of lawsuits filed at one time since 
the trade group for the largest music labels, the Recording Industry 
Association of America, launched its controversial legal campaign last 
summer to cripple Internet music piracy.

Music lawyers filed the newest cases against "John Doe" defendants -- 
identified only by their numeric Internet protocol addresses -- and expected 
to work through the courts to learn their names and where they live.

The recording association said each person was illegally distributing an 
average of more than 800 songs online. Each defendant faces potential civil 
penalties or settlements that could cost them thousands of dollars.

The resumed legal campaign was intended to discourage music fans emboldened 
by last month's federal appeals court decision, which dramatically increased 
the cost and effort to track computer users swapping songs online and sue 
them.

"Our campaign against illegal file sharers is not missing a beat," said Cary 
Sherman, president of the recording association. "The message to illegal 
file sharers should be as clear as ever."

All 532 lawsuits were filed in Washington and New York -- home to Verizon 
Internet Services Inc. and Time Warner Inc. and a few other prominent 
Internet providers -- although the recording association said it expects to 
discover through traditional subpoenas that these defendants live across the 
United States.

The RIAA said that after its lawyers discover the identity of each 
defendant, they will contact each person to negotiate a financial settlement 
before amending the lawsuit to formally name the defendant and, if 
necessary, transfer the case to the proper courthouse.

Verizon had successfully challenged the industry's use of copyright 
subpoenas, one of its most effective tools to track illegal downloaders. The 
U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia ruled last month that the 
recording industry can't use the subpoenas to force Internet providers to 
identify music downloaders without filing a lawsuit.

The court said that copyright subpoenas available under the 1998 Digital 
Millennium Copyright Act "betrays no awareness whatsoever that Internet 
users might be able directly to exchange files containing copyrighted 
works."

The RIAA will shows those damn IP addresses who is boss!

They think they are so cool, with all their digits, and their
little dots.  When the RIAA are done with them, they will
multicast their friends to make sure no other addresses
make the same mistake.

Ook ook!  Eeeeep!!!

No SJ-to-SF haul for me tonight, but many happy salutations to Dina +
Terri.  The ten-year anniversary gift is supposed to be, what... tin? 
That's all you get after ten years?  I don't think I've ever gotten past
LINT.  =P

Congratulations!

The archives from this past Sunday's record-breaking show are up.  We hit
a 126 listener peak, and Jerel and I played a nasty 10 hour set w/
Evancipation hoppin in for a bit and dropping some fresh dubs.

I'd link up everything here, but honestly that shit took me a long time to
encode & list, so I'm far too tired.  Everything you want is here:

dude,

i don't "think" I've punched myself in the head until I fell over, but if
it's anything like laying with your head in a car trunk while you used tons
of spray-glu to dynamat the trunk, all while taking breaks to spray paint in
the garage without a mask . . . then it must be cool. . .

sparkles (kinda like glitter) just make everything better (some might say
bearable) don't they. . .

OK i was in some store in LA today looking around at music and I saw so much 
wax I never saw before.

well my question's are simple i think.. *scratchs head*
-all these are about dance records-

"i do not want to use www.google.com for my answers i want to get them from 
the Bay area DJ's or people that know there music"

1.) what dose (radio edit) mean
2.) what dose (club edit) mean
3.) what dose (dub edit) mean?

oh that was the first bunch of questions. 

next is this

What are 5 good records for 2004 late 2003 that people will most likely 
groove out to in the clubs or in an event?

also should i buy WHo da funk - shiny disco balls?

Thanks.

quoth DJBigDaddyG@aol.com:
> 1.) what dose (radio edit) mean

A "radio edit" is typically shorter, and usually lacks a breakdown.

> 2.) what dose (club edit) mean

A "club edit" usually includes lots of filters and cheesy, over-used
disco samples. The kick is typically emphasized over other elements to
make it more "dance-friendly".

> 3.) what dose (dub edit) mean?

There's no general rule to describe the "dub edit". Back in the 80's
every song had a dub edit, and most of them were just really long
versions of the original with less vocals, more delay and reverb, and a
variety of "dub" percussion samples thrown in at opportune moments. More
modern dub edits tend to be less literal, and more true to the mantra of
real dub music: stripping the song down to its most basic elements, and
giving it atmosphere, depth, and "space".

I be damned if I know what people want to "groove out to" at clubs these
days...

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Good Records 2 Buy?

1 - Usually the shortest of all 'edits' meant for play on radio...I can't
say I would never, but I have never played a radio edit while at a gig
(maybe just my inability) Most of the songs with these 'edit's' originated
on the radio, example; Monica 'get it off' - That kid chris edit...typically
heavy on vocals and not much else...if they made it tooo intricate, the
poppy peeps just might not get it. lol.

2 - I would take 'club' edit to usually dictate the major remix of the
'radio edit', umm como se dice Paul Oakenfold?...to be honest the only time
I see these edits are for people like Madonna and Pink, 50 cent, etc. Club
edit, to me, derives from a popular song that they want to cross over to the
dance floors and they will throw in, like Shaun said, as many bells,
whistles, scream's, etc and just annihilate the song...Again, at least for
the style of tunes I buy, probably not the strongest mix on the record.

3 - Ahhh the dub, now we are getting into some good stuff...Not sure about
the history of the dub, but to me it usually means the heavy bass,
subliminal driving mix. Subtle changes and strong drive

As far as what people are gonna groove to, dude that's your job. lol...I
guess it would depend on the event and style of music that the crowd is
looking for...Being a progressive dj, some tunes that have worked for me as
of late:
1. Wyatt Earp & Jonas Temple "Frequency"
2. Trafik "Your Light" Luke Chable Remix
3. Van Bellan & Greed "City Lights" Mathew DeKay Remix
4. Maquai "Get It On" Original Mix
5. Scrambler "Free" LoStep's Class of 95 Remix

.and as for the 'shiny disco balls', you can have my copy...it's only
function these days is as a bookend. take care.

The last thing I would recommend is not to search out these 'radio', 'club'
edits, but to find producers who's remixes you like and search for other
things they do and there own original productions...this will start you off
on a 'kevin bacon 7th theory' type deal and you will discover a lot of new
people once you start developing your style.

Subject: RE: [sfraves] Good Records 2 Buy?

Dude...the best advice I can give you is, grab stacks of vinyl, sit at a 
listening station, and listen to shit until you hear records you like. You 
might want to imagine how they'd sound with other records you already have, 
but all in all, you should just buy what you like or what you think you'd 
like to spin. The rest comes with time. Who cares what tracks are hot, and 
which aren't....it should be 1st and foremost about what makes YOU wanna 
groove. Most likely that will come across to whomever you play for. If a dj 
hates his vinyl, bnut it's "dancefloor friendly" chances are the only people 
that will like it at all are people you don't want at your party, lol.

The record lables that put out dnace music will force the RIAA to ceace. If 
this goes far enough, deejays will backlash and just stop playing the labels 
who support the RIAA crack-down.

It's hard enough for most EDM labels to stay afloat these days. Even a 
minute drop in record sales will drive most of them under.

However, I bet this has a lot more to do with Funkmaster Flex wannabees than 
EDM jocks. It's probably the hip hop labels that want to smash the mix CD's. 
Because these days, they no longer rely on an underground to stay viable.

AUDi,
Gavin

Don't worry about it if you're not selling them.

And don't worry about it if all of the tracks on your cd are from
independent dance labels.  They aren't part of the RIAA...usually these
roundups apply to hip hop DJ mix CDs with lots of major label radio tracks
on them...

Do you really think that's fair to the producers who
actually *made* the music that you play?

In my mind it works like this:

My track on your promo/free mix CD + tracklisting = OK

My track on your promo/free mix CD + NO TRACKLISTING =
NOT OK

My track on your for-profit mix CD without my
permission = NOT OK

By not listing the tracks and giving credit to those
that made them, you're really doing a disservice to
the people who keep you in business...

(JMHO BTW)

Subject: RE: [sfraves] Bullshit!!! (Dj's vs. RIAA)

I do not make demos for profit, shit I rarely make demos anyway, I know that 
there are certain things that are okay to do and not okay to do regarding 
duplication of tracks, and demos.  That is very apparent.
The thing that bugs me is the freedom, (which I have been told this country 
has been all about) has slowly been taken away...from not being able to 
dance at certain place, to not even be able to get married to someone you 
love depending on sexual preference, to not being able pee in the forest off 
a highway without getting a fine of 700$ freely, it is just a long list of 
subtle dissapointments that make me upset.  I am  looking at the bigger 
picture.
If I were producing tracks, I would love that other people sought after them 
as a valuable creation of mine, however I was unaware of the politics 
concerning that there are *certain* groups or labels that belong to the 
RIAA, and not all of them...
hope that clarifies where I am coming from...
(I am sure someone will now misread the whole "freedom" thing that I said 
and turn it into a lame "this country" tangent on the list.  Please don't.  
Reread what I wrote
with love and concern,
Danny Picard

Subject: [sfraves] fwd re: Dj'vs RIAA

>From AndyW--
I think unlicensed for profit mix cds suck, and that's what this
'crackdown' is all about.  Don't kid yourselves, the product we are
talking about here are mix cds, made of other people's music, with little
going on in the way of mixing (tracks played almost in their entirety),
often pulling $16-$20 at the register... with the bulk of that money going
to someone who spent a few hours banging it together.  Compared to the
tens/hundreds of hours in making a good track, I just think it's not fair
unless the original artists/labels approve (and there is a mechanism
people use for this referred to as clearing or licensing and it's existed
for almost as long as Djing and sampling have been recognized as an
artform).

As a producer, the gloves come off when I see a cd in a store where
someone else is charging for a track I made.  That's when DJs step outside
the realm of fair use with the interntion of promoting themselves and get
into fucking me out of my own track's success to the clanging of cash
registers.

The real question here is fair use, and I don't think unlicensed cds sold
for profit at stores should fall into that category.  If someone is giving
away a mix that contains my song in an effort to express what it is they
play, I'm ok with that.  Hell, it's kinda fun to type "mutor threshold" as
a google search and see where my last EP pops up in a top ten, or a track
listing for some aspiring DJ in Japan.

The problem with a lot of this is that people are stating how greedy the
RIAA is without realizing that there is a lot less return for them doing
this than for the DJs who charge for other people's music without making
any effort to compensate the original artists.  This isn't the borg suing
IP addresses, it's actually the kind of stuff they're supposed to be
doing.

I don't wanna put Moonpup in jail for selling me a couple mixtapes behind
the Acme for $5 a piece in 1996, but many record stores actually see far
more profit from mix cd sales and rave ticket sales than actual vinyl
sales these days... and if those mix cds aren't taking care of the
original artists there's a problem (a lot of people argue that labels
don't give enough money to artists when it's their own album so
conventional logic dictates this must be even worse, right?).  Cause as
much as you might love your favorite DJ, without people making original
tracks we'd get really bored pretty quick.

SOMA Sessions
Drum & Bass Fourth Fridays @ AsiaSF

Friday January 23, 2004 - Opening night!

MARCUS INTALEX (Soul:r, MIST - UK) 
Marcus Intalex is known across the globe for his
infectious, smooth style of Drum 'n Bass. Only a few
years after his first production efforts in 1995 on
Flex and his own Intalex Productions imprint came
anthems such as "How You Make Me Feel," "Love &
Happiness" and "Universe," which firmly positioned
Marcus as one of the world's top D&B personalities.
Today, Marcus Intalex and longtime studio partner,
S.T. Files continue to blaze trails as M.I.S.T. with
their wildly popular Soul:r label. With over a decade
of experience on the decks, SOMA Sessions is proud to
welcome back to San Francisco one of the UK's most
in-demand Drum 'n Bass DJs. 

METHOD ONE (Cov.Ops, method-one.com) 
By 1994 Method One was both an acclaimed DJ and and
experienced rave promoter in Philly. By 1996 he was
also an established producer. Recording with partner
Kaos as Atlantiq, Method One signed tunes to labels
like Good Looking and True Intent while holding down
DJ residencies at Konkrete Jungle and Dieselboy's
Platinum. Since relocating to the Bay, Jason continues
to wreck dancefloors with his diverse DJ sets and
release top-shelf tunes on labels such as ASC's Covert
Operations.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Bullshit!!! (Dj's vs. RIAA)

dont foprget that although the label that put out that track your spinning
may be small and somewhat underground, but the original track that for
instance the vocals might have come from may belong to some company that
DOES belong to the RIAA.... or maybe its a remix of an old track  and the
remixer never actually got a license to remix it....

so although you may only play tracks from independent dance labels; you may
not be as unaffected by this as you intially thought.

It's the same argument- up to a certain level it's
tolerable, beyond that it's not-

I personally don't use *any* of anyone else's samples,
and most people I know are the same way.
A "sampler" is not just used for stealing other
people's stuff you know...

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Bullshit!!! (Dj's vs. RIAA)

I don't think this is an issue the riaa should be getting involved
with.......unless a record company complains about someone profitting
directly from the sale of mix with their copyrighted material on it.

Because electronic music isn't completely mainstream where else would people
gain access to the tracks that are being produced?  DJ mixes!!!!!  This is
like free promotion for both the producer and the dj!

And yes, I agree tracklistings should be provided.  But even when someone
gets a hold of a mix of mine that didn't have the tracklisting on the actual
cd they email me and ask what the song is.  If thats not good promotion then
i don't know what is......

Another thing that doesn't make any sense is that a lot of these record
companies are producing tracks utilizing copyrighted melodies and samples
WITHOUT gaining permission......so its hard to imagine that the dj would be
held responsible when it the record company releasing and profiting from the
sale of the track.

I think the riaa is just fucking bored, all they have been doing lately is
trying to find ways to restrict what people do on the net and in the
entertainment industry.  I don't think it would be that bad for musicians
and actors to make a little less money, isn't it true that once you become a
celebrity you get free things constantly?  So they obviously don't need that
much money and should just let it be....=P

Subject: RE: [sfraves] Bullshit!!! (Dj's vs. RIAA)

The major labels I am sure are complaining that their sales are dipping
due to the smaller labels taking sales. Dance music not being mainstream
is a problem because the majors have no control and cannot exploit many
of the artists like they can with other more mainstream music. So in
turn they lose money. If the artists signed to major labels learn that
they can escape contracts that defy physics then they will leave the
majors for greener pastures. The RIAA is not funded by small labels that
are barely afloat. They are funded either directly or indirectly through
major labels. So when your paycheck is scared what do you do but protect
it. The RIAA is attacking djs because the major labels see the dj
culture as a threat to their livelihood. That is just my opinion but you
know I really could be wrong. 


One question I have is this. For all artists on SFRaves if you are
signed to a label that you have no stake in financially what percentage
of each record sold ends up in your pocket. I really want to know.

this is a continuation of a fictional tale:
 
so, henry knew he was the envy of all people, especially with that lady on his arm, but he still went out anyway. he had many admirers among the crowd, but no one admired him more than his pet dog, georgie, which is also why he went home early. :)

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Bullshit!!! (Dj's vs. RIAA)

in short, there is sort of an artificial market limit. i'd say anywhere 
from 750-2000 copies sold of a record in the UG dance scene is a 'hit'. 
you'd probably make anywhere from 250-2000$ for it. it's better to own 
the label; if you don't you probably aren't getting any sort of 
royalties on numbers sold.
it's an extremely volatile market. it's better to blow your wad on a 
nice rmx or track from an established artist in order to position your 
label better with the distro's and record stores; which translates in 
more records sold to punters. it's just like the dj scene in this 
sense. the top 5 percent are making the money and making the beats. 
there is a lot of room for other artist and labels, it's just really 
hard to get your label out there and doing healthy from month to month. 
most label owners have daytime jobs. unless your the owner of 
metalheadz, or NRK, or TidyTraxx you are hustling doing something else.
the real money as an artist is getting your track signed for a mix cd 
from some huge dj. then you can cop a large amount or start talking 
percents and points.
your miles will vary of course for everything....
im agree with andyW, but i also agree with the fact that it sells more 
records in the long run. if you can afford to get a glass master done 
and nice graphics, then you can afford to pay for the tracks. if your 
burining 25 cd's at home with your colour printer making DIY and 
selling them for a few bucks for cost of materials or giving them out; 
may the force be with you...

This is the same fight that's been happening for decades  with the record
companies/'recording industry' associations. The RIAA or its equivilant is
always agonizing over every little penny it can get its hands on when the
economy is tight. They used to shit themselves over records  being played
in public venues.

don't worry. the RIAA is becoming passe. Pretty soon those greedy old
bastards will be replaced by new greedy bastards. ;) The smart ones among
us will become those new greedy bastards and the rest of us will despair,
and the next generation of kids will shake their fists at those greedy
rave-generation profiteering gluttons... :b

Danny,

	Is this for real? A $700 citation for peeing in the forest? That is 
absolutely outrageous. Please supply details (as many as possible) so 
we can get the word out so we can make the pricks look like... well, 
like who they are.

Subject: [sfraves] RE: Bullshit!!! (Dj's vs. RIAA)

I'm just wondering WTF these labels/producers were thinking when they 
put their tracks out on vinyl, in the first place, if they're going to 
get all lawsuit-happy over DJs mixing and playing them.  It seems 
pretty obvious to me....

I mean...  who the hell buys vinyl just to sit at home and listen to it 
alone and in private on a single record player and no mixer?!?!?  
(Though I'm sure SOMEONE will point out that they do so, just to prove 
me wrong....)  For that, we have CDs and MP3s!

Isn't the whole POINT of vinyl that DJs are going to mix it together, 
and play it out at a party?  And if they're not getting gigs yet, damn 
straight they're handing out mix tapes/CDs to anyone who'll take them.  
Why the hell ELSE, other than the DJ-and-1200-friendly user interface, 
WOULD you release your tracks on a low-fi, analog (ugh!), 
degrades-every-time-you-play-it, ruined by moderate heat, easy to 
break, more expensive to make than CD, and less space efficent, format 
like vinyl?!?!?


cya,
john

Not just vinyl either...12" DANCE SINGLES for chrissakes....

I'm sure it's less the producers who bitch than the greedy ass record execs.

Tom Morello (formerly "Rage Against the Machine" and now "Audioslave") on 
the recording industry:


"Explain how the basic record deal is not artist friendly.

Today if you sign a record deal with any of the majors or indies, this is 
what happens. They give a budget to make your record. Say it's $100,000, 
which they lend you. You make your album. You spend some of the money on 
guitars, and some of it on a recording engineer. Now your record contract 
says, for the sake of argument, you get ten cents on the dollar  which is 
not an unusual amount  and the record company gets ninety cents on the 
dollar. Now that $100,000 they gave you to make that record, you owe them 
back. You pay them back with your ten cents on the dollar. So they're in 
the black long before you've broken even. You might sell half a million 
records and be in debt to your record company. Unless you reach a certain 
threshold where you can increase that ten cents, artists are just dicked 
all the way around.

Prior to Rage Against the Machine I was in a band called Lock Up on Geffen 
records. We had the exact same deal that I just told you about. I'd go back 
to Libertyville, and people would think I was a millionaire, and I could 
not afford Ramen. I was on a $7 a week food budget with my big record deal."

Same would go for smoking paraphernalia it is supposed to be used one
way but we all know it is for another purpose. It is setting people up
for failure and ensuring jobs for the bureaucracy.

I'm just wondering WTF these labels/producers were thinking when they 
put their tracks out on vinyl, in the first place, if they're going to 
get all lawsuit-happy over DJs mixing and playing them.  It seems 
pretty obvious to me....

I mean...  who the hell buys vinyl just to sit at home and listen to it 
alone and in private on a single record player and no mixer?!?!?  
(Though I'm sure SOMEONE will point out that they do so, just to prove 
me wrong....)  For that, we have CDs and MP3s!

Isn't the whole POINT of vinyl that DJs are going to mix it together, 
and play it out at a party?  And if they're not getting gigs yet, damn 
straight they're handing out mix tapes/CDs to anyone who'll take them.  
Why the hell ELSE, other than the DJ-and-1200-friendly user interface, 
WOULD you release your tracks on a low-fi, analog (ugh!), 
degrades-every-time-you-play-it, ruined by moderate heat, easy to 
break, more expensive to make than CD, and less space efficent, format 
like vinyl?!?!?

Well, in audiophile circles, vinyl is oftentimes considered far
superior to CD in its sound quality.  That's why these fools are paying
$5,000 for their home turntables!  Transient response is faster than
any digital medium, or even analog tape, for one.  A well-cut vinyl
record can sound a lot more alive, big, and in-your-face than a cd-r'ed
track, unless some serious work goes into the mix/mastering to bring
some of that color into the sound.

So yes, they do wear down and are fragile and all, but there are
tangible reasons why people like to hear them- I always get the cold
sweats fantasizing about what one of my tracks is going to sound like
when it gets back from the vinyl pressing plant- it always adds
something. :)

On the RIAA thing, I agree with an earlier poster- go ahead and use my
tracks on a free promo mix if I'm credited, but if you're going to sell
the thing than forget it- the originators of the wax you spin need to
get their due.  The $1.50 I make on a record (that I put out myself!)
doesn't compensate for the thousands a big dj pulls in for a commercial
mix cd, sorry.

My tuppence,
George C.

Gay Marriage Poll Gets Annulled

By <http://www.wired.com/news/feedback/mail/1,2330,769,00.html>Daniel 
Terdiman<http://www.wired.com/news/feedback/mail/1,2330,769,00.html>

<http://www.wired.com/news/culture/0,1284,61982,00.html>http://www.wired.com/news/culture/0,1284,61982,00.html

02:00 AM Jan. 22, 2004 PT

When the American Family Association posted an online poll last month 
asking its constituents their position on gay marriage, it thought it was 
engaging in a straightforward exercise.

The conservative organization supports a constitutional amendment defining 
marriage as strictly between a man and a woman, and it planned to forward 
to Congress the results of 
<http://www.afa.net/petitions/marriagepoll.asp>the poll, which it expected 
would support its position, as evidence of Americans' opposition to gay 
marriage.

But the <http://www.afa.net/>AFA never counted on the power of the 
Internet. And once the URL to the poll escaped its intended audience, 
everything went haywire. As of Jan. 19, 60 percent of respondents -- more 
than 508,000 voters -- said, "I favor legalization of homosexual marriage." 
With an additional 7.89 percent -- or 66,732 voters -- replying, "I favor a 
'civil union' with the full benefits of marriage except for the name," the 
AFA's chosen position, "I oppose legalization of homosexual marriage and 
'civil unions,'" was being defeated by a 2-1 ratio.

"We're very concerned that the traditional state of marriage is under 
threat in our country by homosexual activists," said AFA representative 
Buddy Smith. "It just so happens that homosexual activist groups around the 
country got a hold of the poll -- it was forwarded to them -- and they 
decided to have a little fun, and turn their organizations around the 
country (onto) the poll to try to cause it to represent something other 
than what we wanted it to. And so far, they succeeded with that."

Of course, no such poll can be said to represent an accurate picture of 
popular opinion. But, clearly, the AFA had hoped Congress would take the 
numbers it planned to produce as exactly that kind of evidence.

Now, Smith says, his organization has had to abandon its goal of taking the 
poll to Capitol Hill.

"We made the decision early on not to do that," Smith admitted, "because of 
how, as I say, the homosexual activists around the country have done their 
number on it."

So what happened?

Against the wishes of the AFA and its members, the poll leaked to the 
outside. And soon, people like Gabe Anderson began posting it to blogs, 
social-networking sites such as 
<http://www.friendster.com/index.jsp>Friendster and sundry e-mail lists. 
When Anderson 
<http://gabeanderson.com/life/2003/12/18/marriage_poll.php>posted it to his 
blog on Dec. 18, 2003, the anti-gay-marriage position was leading, with 
51.45 percent of respondents opposing gay marriage or civil unions.

But with his posting, in which he alerted his readers to the poll, Anderson 
-- and many like him -- began to unleash the democratic power that the 
Internet promises, and which organizations like the AFA must have 
forgotten: the ability to bring people together to fight for, or against, a 
cause.

"I definitely think that if an organization like the AFA wants to conduct a 
poll like this, they open up themselves to more than they expected," said 
Anderson. "I think it's a great example that the Internet can effect change 
and have an influence if there is a cause."

Surely, by now, with the rise of organizations like 
<http://www.moveon.org>MoveOn.org and Internet-fueled political campaigns 
like Howard Dean's, such results should surprise no one.

But the AFA seems to have been caught by surprise, and is now trying to 
gain new currency from the outcome.

"Hopefully the results of the poll will be a wake-up call," said Smith, "to 
realize the need for us to get more focused and organized and to do what we 
need to do."

But in the meantime, the AFA and organizations like it will have to get 
used to the idea that if they want to use the Internet as a tool, they had 
better understand how it works.

"I think it's pretty cool," said Anderson. "It's empowering that the 
Internet can have this kind of effect. As an individual, your first 
reaction is, 'I don't know if I can make a difference.' This is a good 
example of helping people who are historically apathetic (to say), 'Maybe 
my vote will matter, too.'"

&quot;We're very concerned that the traditional state of marriage is under threat in our country by homosexual activists,&quot; said AFA representative Buddy Smith. &quot;It just so happens that homosexual activist groups around the country got a hold of the poll -- it was forwarded to them -- and they decided to have a little fun, and turn their organizations around the country (onto) the poll to try to cause it to represent something other than what we wanted it to. And so far, they succeeded with that.&quot; <br><br>
Of course, no such poll can be said to represent an accurate picture of popular opinion. But, clearly, the AFA had hoped Congress would take the numbers it planned to produce as exactly that kind of evidence. <br><br>
Now, Smith says, his organization has had to abandon its goal of taking the poll to Capitol Hill. <br><br>
&quot;We made the decision early on not to do that,&quot; Smith admitted, &quot;because of how, as I say, the homosexual activists around the country have done their number on it.&quot; <br><br>
So what happened? <br><br>
Against the wishes of the AFA and its members, the poll leaked to the outside. And soon, people like Gabe Anderson began posting it to blogs, social-networking sites such as <a href="http://www.friendster.com/index.jsp">Friendster</a> and sundry e-mail lists. When Anderson <a href="http://gabeanderson.com/life/2003/12/18/marriage_poll.php">posted</a> it to his blog on Dec. 18, 2003, the anti-gay-marriage position was leading, with 51.45 percent of respondents opposing gay marriage or civil unions. <br><br>
But with his posting, in which he alerted his readers to the poll, Anderson -- and many like him -- began to unleash the democratic power that the Internet promises, and which organizations like the AFA must have forgotten: the ability to bring people together to fight for, or against, a cause. <br><br>
&quot;I definitely think that if an organization like the AFA wants to conduct a poll like this, they open up themselves to more than they expected,&quot; said Anderson. &quot;I think it's a great example that the Internet can effect change and have an influence if there is a cause.&quot; <br><br>
Surely, by now, with the rise of organizations like <a href="http://www.moveon.org">MoveOn.org</a> and Internet-fueled political campaigns like Howard Dean's, such results should surprise no one. <br><br>
But the AFA seems to have been caught by surprise, and is now trying to gain new currency from the outcome. <br><br>
&quot;Hopefully the results of the poll will be a wake-up call,&quot; said Smith, &quot;to realize the need for us to get more focused and organized and to do what we need to do.&quot; <br><br>
But in the meantime, the AFA and organizations like it will have to get used to the idea that if they want to use the Internet as a tool, they had better understand how it works. <br><br>
&quot;I think it's pretty cool,&quot; said Anderson. &quot;It's empowering that the Internet can have this kind of effect. As an individual, your first reaction is, 'I don't know if I can make a difference.' This is a good example of helping people who are historically apathetic (to say), 'Maybe my vote will matter, too.'&quot; <br><br>

Too bad those cases suck my ass. Mine dropped a grand total of 3 feet off of 
a table and broke (the front plate thingy about popped right off). Also, you 
can't store them in overhead storage on a plane. I prefer a nice heavy 
padded soft-bag personally.

use, too many whites are getting away with drug sales, too many whites
are getting away with trafficking in this stuff. The answer to this
disparity is not to start letting people out of jail because we're not
putting others in jail who are breaking the law. The answer is to go out
and find the ones who are getting away with it, convict them and send

Recently you've stored one in an overhead? I was told I had to check mine as 
it couldn't fit under a seat or in the overhead. Maybe it depends on the 
airline...

I dunno, the idea of ever checking my records again is way too scary. I have 
had too many "incidents" with my stuff going in the cargo holds. I prefer to 
carry on everything these days...

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

Dear NRDC BioGems Defender,

Over the next few weeks, President Bush and his congressional allies 
will try once again to ram their disastrous energy bill through the U.S. Senate. 
They fell only two votes short in November and they've vowed to make passage 
of the bill their top priority now that Congress has returned from recess. 

This bill may be the worst piece of legislation you and I will see in 
our lifetimes. It would pick your pocket, despoil your natural heritage, 
endanger your family's health and smother your hope for a more secure energy 
future. We ignore this bill at our own peril.

Let me tell you our simple plan for thwarting this shameless attack on 
our environment and pocketbooks. If millions of Americans each took one 
minute to protest this bill, it would cause every senator who is tempted to vote 
for it to think twice about doing so.

You can make this happen within the next few hours by doing two things:

First, go to http://www.savebiogems.org/takeaction.asp?src=RR0401
and send your two senators an email or fax, telling them to vote 
against this pro-polluter energy bill. Then, forward my email to at least four of 
your friends, family members or colleagues.

I am emailing this message to 500,000 BioGems Defenders and other NRDC
activists. If each one forwards this message to just four more people, 
we will generate a national tidal wave of opposition before this day is over.

And that won't be a moment too soon. This disgraceful bill would pick 
our pockets to hand out billions of dollars in taxpayer subsidies to the 
oil, coal and nuclear industries. That's their long-awaited reward for making 
big-time contributions to the Bush-Cheney campaign. They profit while the rest 
of us pay the price -- in tax dollars and environmental degradation.

This bill gives the energy giants a free pass to drill their way 
through our last wild places, burn more dirty coal, build a new generation of risky 
nuclear power plants and dramatically increase air pollution that would sicken 
the vulnerable -- especially children and seniors -- for decades to come.

It would establish oil and gas development as the dominant use of our 
federal public lands, open national parks to the construction of electricity
transmission lines, exempt polluters from core provisions of our clean 
air and water laws and waive liability for the producers of the toxic gasoline 
additive MTBE -- even though it has contaminated at least 1,500 public water 
supplies in all 50 American states.

You'd be hard-pressed to come up with a more backward-looking, wasteful 
and self-defeating energy "plan" than this one. At a time when the federal 
deficit is soaring and we're going to war in the Persian Gulf oilfields, the 
White House wants to stick us with the tab for prolonging our destructive 
dependence on fossil fuels, foreign oil and dangerous nuclear technology.

This is not a national energy policy. This is corporate welfare, pure 
and simple. Estimates of the bill's corporate tax breaks range from $23 
billion to well over $100 billion with loan guarantees included. No surprise 
there. Big energy companies cooked up this raid on the federal treasury during 
hundreds of secret meetings with Vice President Cheney's energy task force and 
their allies on Capitol Hill.

It's one thing to gouge taxpayers. But to claim this rip-off is in the 
national interest, as the White House would have us believe, is a slap in the 
face to every working American.

Poll after poll shows that the vast majority of voters -- of both 
parties -- understand that we simply must reduce our out-of-control appetite for 
fossil fuels if we ever are to secure energy independence. That means turning 
American rooftops into the Persian Gulf of solar energy. It means producing cars 
that get 40 miles per gallon. It means constructing efficient buildings that 
use half the energy of the average American office without sacrificing 
comfort.

Making this transformation to a super-efficient, low-pollution economy 
would save consumers upwards of a trillion dollars, spare our last wild 
places from destruction, improve our health, slow global warming and reduce our 
dependence on undemocratic regimes overseas. It's a no-brainer to anyone living 
outside the White House.

But unless millions of Americans speak out right now, the enactment of 
the president's energy bill will doom us to an apocalyptic future of 
blighted wilderness, poisonous air pollution, devastating climate change and 
endless wars over fossil fuels.

Please make your voice heard. Go to
http://www.savebiogems.org/takeaction.asp?src=RR0401
and tell your senators to obey the will of the American people, *not* 
the dictates of giant energy corporations! Call on Congress to create a 
sustainable and affordable energy path.

And please be sure to forward this message to at least four other 
people. Believe me, millions of Americans are just waiting for a simple way to 
stop this madness and lend their support to a sane and hopeful energy 
future.

Sincerely yours,

Yeah, as recently as this summer.  The bigger overheads work.  The
commuter jets, no work. (I don't know overhead dimension details off the
top of my head though.)

Good suggestion!  The one time it was "lost" it still did end up getting
back to me.  Unhappy times in the interim to say the least.

-- 
What this says to me is that too many whites are getting away with drug
use, too many whites are getting away with drug sales, too many whites
are getting away with trafficking in this stuff. The answer to this
disparity is not to start letting people out of jail because we're not
putting others in jail who are breaking the law. The answer is to go out
and find the ones who are getting away with it, convict them and send
them up the river, too."

Friday, January 23, 2004 ** DJ Revolution of the World Famous Wake Up Show =
**

DJ Revolution | BIO

Revolution began his career at the age of 13 on some dusty, old, mismatched=
, beltdriven turntables his grandfather pulled out of the attic.

After hooking them up to a mixer ol' grandad built from scrap metal in his =
garage,
he started selling Top 40 and rock mix tapes to his sixth grade class. When
he first heard The Adventures of Grandmaster Flash on The Wheels of Steel w=
hich
had already been out a few years - his whole idea of what a DJ was turned u=
pside
down.
Since then DJ Revolution has spent 15 years perfecting his craft on the 120=
0's.
You'd be amazed at how much one can do with records in 15 years, and Revolu=
tions
has done just about everything you can think of. Spun 'em, scratched 'em, j=
uggled
'em, sampled 'em, collected 'em, produced 'em, sold 'em, distributed 'em, p=
romoted
'em and so on. But in 1996, after sending an outdated mixtape to King Tech,
he could add one more item to the list of things he's done with records; pl=
ayed
'em on the Wake up Show.
Two weeks after Tech contacted DJ Revolution, Rev was on the show doing reg=
ular
guest spots. In 97', when a friend and crewmember Prince Ice left the show,
Rev took over the wheels, and has been holding 'em down ever since
A side from his duties on the air he has lent his now infamous scratch tech=
niques
to countless records and his production skills to many established artists.
Revolution jhas also released 2 of his own Full Length LP's (In 12's we tru=
st/R2K)
and 1 with his partners Sway &amp; Tech (This or That).
He now owns and operates his label Millenia Music, on which he will continu=
e
to make classic contributions to the hp hop world thru the material it puts
out.
However, no matter how involved in the business of Hip Hop DJ Revolution be=
comes
he will always be most comfortable standing behind two 1200's

Saturday, January 24, 2004 ** Charles Feelgood - "CD Release Party" **

Charles Feelgood | BIO

Legendary for his role in the birth of the electronic music scene in the Ba=
ltimore/Washington DC area, Charles Feelgood has built a solid reputation a=
s a DJ in the international dance music community through his ingenious rem=
ix skills and dynamic brand of funky disco house.

Cultivating a fascination with music since childhood, Charles Fields grew u=
p listening to Motown, disco and funk, genres that heavily influenced his p=
ersonal style as an artist.

"I used to stay up late listening to my dad play records and decided that w=
as what I wanted to do," says Feelgood. His first foray into the world of d=
ance music was in the late '80s, throwing small-scale parties under the nam=
e "House of Fields".

An integral part of the Baltimore/DC style since day one, Feelgood is often=
 credited with putting the scene on the house music map. In 1992 he joined =
forces with fellow DJ Scott Henry to launch Fever, a club event that introd=
uced the sounds of electronic music to his hometown. The first event of its=
 kind in that region, the night exploded in popularity almost immediately, =
attracting upwards of 25,000 people. Featuring such top-notch, internationa=
lly renowned talent as Paul Van Dyk and Carl Cox, the biweekly event ran th=
rough May 2001.

Maintaining a seven-year residency at Fever helped springboard Feelgood's e=
minently danceable brand of bangin' hard house to widespread exposure acros=
s the East Coast. His popularity quickly bloomed thanks in part to his lege=
ndary series of mixed tapes, "Time to Get Ill." He soon developed a club-he=
avy touring schedule that regularly took him to famed clubs such as Sound F=
actory, Spundae, Shampoo, and Cro Bar, along with numerous other venues on =
the West Coast, Canada, Europe, Asia and South America.

In 1993, Feelgood launched his own label, Charm City Recordings, to create =
an outlet for his original material. His releases on the label found modera=
te success, but ultimately, launching his own label proved to be a crucial =
stepping stone for exposing his material to more famous imprints.

Following a successful mixed CD release in 2000 on Warner Bros. offshoot F-=
111, Feelgood joined forces with North America's premier electronic music l=
abel in 2001 to release the well-received "Can You Feel It," followed later=
 that year by an installment in the djmixed.com series.

According to Feelgood, the secret to a great mix CD is recreating the club =
experience on vinyl. But despite the immense popularity and critical acclai=
m his mixed CD's have received, he still prefers to produce original record=
s for the artistic freedom it allows.

Constantly in demand all over the world for his ability to light up dance f=
loors with his disco-flavored sets of funk-drenched house, Feelgood has rec=
eived numerous accolades in his thirteen-year career. These include being n=
amed Baltimore's Best DJ, and being included in the top 40 of BPM Magazine'=
s 2002 top 50 DJ list.

Acclaimed for his ability to seamlessly transition between club and rave at=
mospheres, Feelgood notes "I definitely try and take the listeners on a mus=
ical journey - I like to start out slow and funky and push for a harder end=
ing, a continuous rise."

"I'm far from a purist," he adds. "I incorporate many styles into a single =
set. I play everything from disco-influenced house to a capella tracks and =
tech house, and I especially love bootlegs."

Looking to expand more into the realm of production, Feelgood has retreated=
 into the cut hut studios to concentrate full force on producing original m=
aterial. Look for a slew of released in 2002, with his highly anticipated f=
ull-length studio album to be released in summer 2004. Charles next mix alb=
um "Across America" will be in stores May 05, 2003 on the 611/System Record=
ings Imprint.

The consummated dance floor rocker, Feelgood sums up his musical mission in=
 one sentence: "I just want the name implies, to make people have a good ti=
me and go home with a great feeling."

Thursday, February 12, 2004 ** Gene Farris @ The Lotus Lounge **

Gene Farris | BIO

Gene Farris is the sinister minister of dance music=B9s changing sounds. Fa=
rris=B9s global DJ track record and extensive discography of over forty pro=
ductions are definitely a testament to the true Chicago house sound. Farris=
's unique dexterous DJ style that includes extended sultry, melodic blends =
with tuff beats makes him a party favorite around the world. House music is=
 Farris's undoubted passion that also drives his full flavored, colorful st=
udio creations. Farris's deep roots in house music and strive to be the bes=
t keeps him on the global electronic music industry's cutting edge.


Pushed by local kids in his South Side neighborhood of Chicago Gene Farris =
caught the DJ bug at the tender age of twelve. Inspired by the likes of Ron=
 Hardy, Prince, and Roy Ayers Farris began blending a mixture of funk, disc=
o, and soul combined with eighties' pop icons such as, Duran Duran. One may=
 still hear hints of disco in his style.


Even in his early years Farris was constantly on the move. By making mix ta=
pes for his neighborhood buddies and selling them at many famed Windy City =
record stores like Gramaphone, Farris's spinning skills quickly developed. =
Not only did Farris's style evolve, his reputation rapidly grew. After many=
 late nights 'beatn' down neighborhood block parties, Farris earned his chi=
ldhood dream slot warming up for legendary Ron Hardy and Ron Carrol at the =
epic AKA Club.


As the early nineties approached, Gene Farris became a major player in the =
thriving Chicago dance scene. Wanting to hear more diverse house music Farr=
is inevitably began to produce his own tracks. His first production style w=
as tuff, loopy and tracky House. At the time Cajmere (of Green Velvet) just=
 started a new label named, Relief Records. Close friend, Ron Trent, urged =
Farris take his hard hitting tunes to Relief Records. Trent thought Farris'=
s tracky sound was perfect for the early Relief.


House music history was made when Farris took his demo to Relief Records. H=
anging out in the Relief office was another young Chicago DJ called Sneak, =
who also just made his first demo. Farris and Sneak both had their tracks s=
igned. The "Farris Wheel" EP was Farris=B9s debut release for Relief in 199=
4. Gene Farris, alongside like minded musicians such as DJ Sneak, Paul John=
son, Derrick Carter, DJ Rush, Ron Trent, Boo Williams and Glen Underground =
formed the new wave of notorious, soon to be globe trotting Chicago DJs and=
 producers.


The "Farris Wheel" EP was the beginning of a prolific production career. Ge=
ne Farris=B9s discography highlights works released on dance music=B9s most=
 respected labels such as, Defected/Fluential, Soma Records, Siesta Music, =
Force Inc., Formaldehyde, 83 West/ Camouflage, Communique, Defmix, Static, =
and more.


Being a leader in the industry, Gene Farris started his own label, Farris W=
heel Recordings, Inc. in 1998, with "The Copa Cabana" EP. Among the label=
=B9s many loved EPs is FWR 008 "The Spirit" - Gene Farris featuring Sneak r=
emix. In February of 2001, Gene Farris unveiled Farris Wheel Recordings's s=
pin-off, Farris Wheel Limited. Farris's concept for the new imprint is to s=
teer away from saturated samples and feature more original, organic product=
ions. Farris Wheel Limited artists are incorporating live feeds into their =
melodic soulful beats. Also, 2003 will see the release of the Farris Wheel =
imprint's first CD compilation of the its own catalouge mixed by Gene Farri=
s.


Currently, Farris continues his travels around the globe DJing for his fans=
 throughout the United States, Canada, and many European countries like Cro=
atia, Holland, Israel, and Russia. However, Farris still finds time in his =
busy schedule to devote in the studio. He is is working on a full length al=
bum of original music for release in 2003. Farris's motive for the album is=
 to push beyond the barriers of the current house music sound. Farris alrea=
dy collaborated with many remarkable dance musicians such as renowned house=
 vocalist, Robert Owens and a fresh New York City production favorite, Onio=
nz (just to name a few).
When asked about his future in music Gene Farris passionately replies, "Hou=
se music is my one and only true love. I've been with her for over sixteen =
years and never plan on leaving. She's my peace... me and the music."


As the critics continually applaud his greatening accomplishments, Gene Far=
ris and his Farris Wheel Recordings empire continue to thrive.


The international demand for the elite Chicago House sound has kept Gene Fa=
rris busy gigging around the globe for over the past ten years. Then Februa=
ry 2003 saw the release of Gene's "Textures" mix CD and 6-track vinyl, acco=
mpanied by his "Textures" world tour, and features and reviews in Jockey Sl=
ut, Muzik, Mixmag, Seven Update, Mojo, DJ, IDJ, Blues & Soul, Echo, Muzik.c=
om, Xpander.nl, Burn It Blue, Worlddj.com and many more.


"Textures is a tasty affair, lots of layers, lots of passion, lots of origi=
nality. Deep, sexy, organic house music with that essential Chicago touch. =
A collection to inspire...5/5" DJ Mag

------------------------------------------------------------------------
This Reclaim The Streets event is being used in part to help bring together=
 the SF "activist" community, with the underground artist/performer communi=
ty, and the late night dance/music communities. =A0We all experience first =
hand the increasing intrusiveness of state repression. =A0Art, performance,=
 music, dance, these are the things that celebrate life and should be held =
up and revered in our society. Instead however, it is these very things tha=
t are constantly trying to be squashed. =A0If you want to have an art exhib=
ition, a performance, a concert, or a party, you have to jump through all s=
orts of bureaucratic hoops, pay for all sorts of permits, and then IF they =
approve of things, you are allowed to have your event. What happens if you =
don't have the means to meet all of their ridiculous standards? What if you=
 don't have the money to pay for all of their permits? Your options include=
 not having the event at all, or having it anyway illegally. And so we have=
 these unpermitted events. Often. And almost as often we have them shut dow=
n by the police. Or they just come in and harass people. For what? For enjo=
ying life? For celebrating that which makes us human? But we're experiencin=
g it more and more. And now they have the RAVE act at their disposal too. A=
nd it is going to continue to get worse until we rise up and say "Enough!"
=A0
So that is part of what we're doing with this RTS. Showing that if you
won't let us have our events in our own spaces where we aren't bothering an=
yone, than we are going to take it to the streets and have our events there=
!
=A0
For more info about RTS itself, you should go straight to the source. These=
 two links are from the London RTS group which began RTS originally way bac=
k in the day. They're a bit long, but very worth reading.

As many of you may know already, Mirage first appeared as a Wednesday club =
night here in San Jose. Unfortunately, as with many nightclubs in the scene=
, the venue was sold and new owners came in to change the club into a blues=
-rock bar. Mirage with its family and friends enjoyed a fun 2003 run and th=
e night vanished just before winter. Recently, we were told that Mirage wil=
l once again take shape in February. All who were involved with Mirage will=
 return to help recreate the magic and build a safe-haven for its reappeara=
nce. As the prophets give us more information, we will forward the details =
to you. Returning to the source of power are Mirage resident DJs: Michael L=
iu (Illumination Records), Denise (Sound Asylum), Dragn'fly (Shaolin), Maje=
re (Elektrosorcery), and Proteus (Vibe Rite). Crisp clean concert sound pow=
ered by Logik Pro. Much more information to follow on this all ages event..=

ion of Mirage, please get in touch.

Subject: RE: [sfraves] RE: Bullshit!!! (Dj's vs. RIAA)

i don't think any indy dance label is going to sue anyone other than some 
fool dj that decides to press up pro cd's with the glass master and selling 
it for 12$ each. on the other hand, it's too much for the label to loose not 
to have the local dj's playing their records and putting them on mix's for 
handing out to punters and promoters.
labels know this and allow it just since it will drive sales further. it's 
really that simple.
also, the RIAA is not interested in small labels. there is no money there. 
they are on all the large mainstream labels jocks; and that includes the so 
called 'UG dance labels' that are off shoots from sony, virgin, capitol, 
ect....
as far as dj's go about they're mix cd's it's just a matter of putting 
decent liner notes on either the webpage that the mp3 resides on, or the 
graphics for the cd shell. the label, the artist and song title is more than 
enough to make any UG label happy! now im all for lawyers if i see the track 
on some professional cd thats at ameoba selling for 12$ even if it's a local 
dj. sorry, but it takes money to put out vinyl and copyrights mean just 
that.....

everytime i travel by plane i use my trusty technics bag. it fits overhead 
and if you sit in the emergency row, it fits underneath the seat in front of 
you..... flight cases are just too much trouble. way back before 9.11 i used 
to bring my flight case and would always sweetalk the stewardess to put it 
in their private storage. worked everytime. don't think you can do that

Subject: [sfraves] Fiberglass Coffin (was re: cheap record cases)

Just thought i'd put this out there:

I'm in the process of building myself a ultra-retro-moderne DJ coffin 
out of fiberglass. If anyone's interested in the design/build aspect of 
it, or if maybe you're in the market for a lightweight, super fucking 
cool looking coffin (custom colors!), hit me up off-list. I'll be 
posting photos of my progress as it happens.

all this talk of cheap record cases reminded me of why i started this 
project. i couldn't find a sturdy coffin worthy of being a piece of 
furniture in my living room - i don't dig the cheap black carpet look.

hey,

if you can work fiberglass then you can prolly also work carbon fiber. . .

a carbon fiber case would be pretty damn sick. . .

: )

I have limited experience making car audio sort of stuff with fiber glass. .
. never thought of coffins tho. . .hmmmm. . .

If experience tells, then carbon fiber would have less resonance
problems, too.

well, i want the slick newly polished car look to it, so the underlying 
material isn't too important, other than providing the strong outer 
layer.

the interior will be a whole lot of foam, so there shouldn't be 
resonance issues.

Subject: [sfraves] .: 1/25 Dirtbox Radio | Hooligan | Grimm Reeper | JB Mix :.


Whoops, I forgot to send out the emails...  here 'tis, tonight's Dirtbox
Gameplan.... ->

07-08pm EST - ODJ & Jerel - Yer faithful hosts bang out some ch00ns to
open up the show.  Got a few new dubs for the night as well, from the
likes of Akasha, Evancipaiton, and Eskmo.

08-09:30pm EST - Hooligan - True master of the mix, Hooligan is kind
enough to grace us with his presence once again.  Hooligan rocks a good

whats up

so I suppose the diffirences between the mk3's and the mk 5 is the blue =
lighting and a +/-16% pitch control instead of the 10%. . .=20

is that all ? I heard the tonearm was upgraded a bit but didn't find out =
exactly how. . .=20

anyone interested ? I'll have them available in the next couple days.

if any SFR people are interested, let me know asap and I'll give you =
guys a discount. . .

say like $885+tax (shipping if applicable) for two -SFR only

msrp is $749 as usual for each one.

if you want, I'll add a set of ortofon dj carts for an extra 215+tax
or a set of ortofon pro carts for $190+tax
or I can find you what you want.

let me know if you're interested. . .

take care all

aK

Sup peoples,

I used some snowed-in time this morning to put up last night's Dirtbox
Radio sets.  I'm feeling too lazy to list the links here, but if you go to
www.dirtboxradio.com and click on the archives link, they're all right
there.  DJs of the night include Hooligan, Grimm Reeper, Evancipation, and
your hosts ODJ & Jerel.

Biggup again to everyone who listened!  If you'd like to play on Dbox or
submit a mix or track to us, just hit us up - holla@dirtboxradio.com

Subject: RE: [sfraves] WR pt 1: Friday night: Over The Top

That was a really fun party, which is nice considering it started off 
looking like some sort of high school thug gathering. The house/breaks room 
was going off all night. The Kent Brothers were definately on point, as well 
as that AaronJae kid (the cd he gave me is pretty dope too). I had a blast, 
and so did my boy from LA. It was nice meeting some people off of 
here...Osby, Sean, Spencer...whoever else I'm missing (hey, we killed a .750 
of Jack in less than an hour, cut us some slack!).

The highlight of my evening was hanging out with the two pimps (literally). 
Those guys were a fucking riot!!!

It was a nice weekend....

Subject: [sfraves] nrr:  pope blesses breakdancers

the pope is a b-boy

http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/01/26/1074965471823.html

http://news.scotsman.com/latest.cfm?id=2452304

http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&u=/ap/20040126/ap_on_re_eu/vatican_break_dancing_1

Pope John Paul II presided over a performance of break dancers today, who 
leapt, flipped and spun their bodies to a dance beat from a tinny boom box 
in the Vatican.

The 83-year-old pontiff seemed to approve, waving his hand after each dancer 
completed their moves, then applauding for the entire group, from a cultural 
organisation in his homeland of Poland.

"For this creative hard work I bless you from my heart," he said.

During the show, one dancer - part of a Polish group that helps poor and 
marginalised youths - planted his head on the inlaid marble floor of the 
Vatican hall and spun to loud applause from his group and from Vatican 
officials. Another performer flung his body around in a series of spins and 
handstands.

As a young man, John Paul himself performed in the arts, albeit as an actor. 
Watching from a raised throne today, the Pope appeared delighted, as he 
often is by his interactions with the young and with his fellow countrymen.

"Artistic talent is a gift from God and whoever discovers it in himself has 
a certain obligation: to know that he cannot waste this talent, but must 
develop it," John Paul said.

"Be faithful to beauty and be faithful to goodness," he said.

Earlier today, the Pope encountered another group of young people, when 
members of an Italian Catholic youth organisation attended - and 
enthusiastically cheered - his weekly remarks in St Peter's Square. A few 
were invited into his papal apartment, and helped him release doves from his 
window.

The Pope, who suffers numerous ailments but appeared relatively strong 
today, ad-libbed a response to the other kids cheering below his window. "I 
love you all. I love you very much," he called out.

DJ Equipment Reviews says the MK5G adds the +-10% <-> +-16% pitch
control. Here's their review of both, from:

(http://www.dj-equipment-reviews.com/technics/technics-1210-mk5.html)

The Intro

Technics have raised the standard once again with the release of
their latest DJ turntables: Technics SL-1210 MK5.

The Good

Technics have kept in all the upgrades that featured on the
SL-1210 MK3 decks including the pitch reset button (so the pitch
fader doesn't click into place at the zero spot), and added in a
few extra nice ones that keeps them top of the pile when it comes
to professional DJ turntables.

The body of the turntable now has its underside made from hard
rubber providing excellent sound isolation. There's also a brake
control feature which allows you adjust how long it takes to
stop a tune with the break button..pretty cool for DJ's who like
to throw a few different effects into their set...beats just
switching the turntable off, at any rate.

In the advanced version the SL-1210 MK5G turntable, Technics
have added a feature that brings them up to speed (literally)
with other DJ turntable manufacturers such as Vestax, who have
been incorporating wider pitch ranges into their turntables.
The MK5G's will let go from +/-8% to +/-16% at the flick off a
switch, giving the DJ greater versatility in the range of tunes
he can play.

The Bad

I think the only criticism would be that they could have
placed the pitch range switch slightly better; I managed to
catch it a couple of times accidentally. That said, its not
long before you get used to these beautiful updates on the
famous Technics turntables.

The pic in the review isn't even of the new decks.. I don't even see a point
in the mk5's. The mk5g's are the way to go.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Review: Long- Oakenfold at Ruby Sky Friday

I wanted to write something briefly about my adventure since I have never 
heard anything good about an Oakenfold show, except by my girlfriends 
college roommate who saw him spin for her very first party.. which she of 
course flipped over.. and became somewhat etarted ever after..lol.

First, I really like the venue.. except that I almost didn't get in because 
of the "dress code" which is not stated on any of the ticketing information 
or flyers for the party.  That would have really sucked ass if the door girl 
wouldn't have let me in.. but she did and for that.. mad props.  Matter of 
fact.. the people that run the club seem really tight.. they are like low 
key.. you never hardly see them, and they don't mess with ya.. except when 
your girlfriend tries to molest the gogo dancer.. then they tell you to tell 
her.. to stop!  That was pretty funny actually. All in all, they let me use 
my atm card at the bar on tab.. and gave me great service all night long.. 
given there were like 1500 people in there.

We get there at 11:30 and went straight up to the front of the stage.. our 
timing was impeccable because Behrouz had been spinning since 9 and everyone 
was really tired of listening to him (albeit an upbeat set I am sure) so the 
front stage was relatively easy to get to.  We positioned ourselves left 
front stage and in like 10 minutes Oakenfold came on and the place exploded. 
  The gogo dancers where left and right stage.. one was right in front of 
us.. and you have to give props to those girls.. they were hot.  At this 
point everything started to feel ahh soo nice!  And my girlfriend, I 
discovered, can pickup asian girls like flies on honey.. needless to say 
dancing is much more fun when your riding the train :P

About an hour into his set, which started out all very epic and large 
sounding.. you know that housey anthem style he likes to play.. I noticed he 
was changing it up a bit.. He was catching on to the crowd and actually 
mixing at the boards.. he was getting his own records and interacting with 
the crowd.. the beat started to sink, almost heavy and saturated, and he 
made eye contact with me, dancing on my girlie, and her four asian friends 
in the front.. Then he did something amazing, the track was spinning a 
feverish beat, he was mixing in something else, and then shut off the table. 
It wound down on the is really naughty sounding, grinding rhythm that made 
everyone in the place freak straight up, and let out a collective OMG!.  
He laughed, and looked away and kept rocking the place for another hour like 
that.. and I have to say.. sic sic sic.

This was a pivotal set, a time that I wont forget so I guess I have to say 
that Oakenfold is everything live that I expected him to be, and more!  Yet 
he played for only 2 hours.. what was up with that.. I guess leave em 
wanting more.  All in all a good set, but I think I will wait till Ibiza 
this summer before I try to see him again.. he needs to have a big system, 
and big stage, and a big crowd to really go off.. I notice a lot of major 
DJs dont really bring it until they have to.. were the smaller labeled 
locals can rip it up anytime.

Cheers!

that pssl info is the same as I've seen everywhere else. . .I noticed the

where the initial panasonic webpage was where they picked up this info. . .

btw, I could always special order the 1210 mk5G's
the price for two of those would be about $1,060+tax, and it would only take
me a couple days to get them.

I also have the new vestax pdx2300's and the price for 2 of those would be
about $ 980+tax
the vestax are actually my personal favorites.

Subject: [sfraves] SKRR: Disco Blood Bath found... Finally!

OK.. so 4 the past 2 1/2 years, on the suggestin of Shane, i went out on a book hunt 2 find the book "Disco Blood Bath" w/ no success... that book is like sooo outta print, even used book stores didn't carry it...

So last year i saw something on TV that i totally brain farted until i did research again on the net... there a movie that's gonna be released Staring Seth Green & Maculy Culcan called "Party Monster" based of the book called "Party Monster" renamed after it was rereleased originaly titled "Disco Blood Bath"... HELLO 2DAY... 

so yeah anyway... I got the book last Saturday & I'm already 100 pagews in2 it... it's kinda sad though 'cause I was in the middle of reading "Good Peoples" by Marco Major & i'm reading "Party Monster" by James St James.  Before that I was reading Amnesia Moon by Johnathan Lethem!

Oh yeah... so the Movie is gonna be released on Video & DVD on Feb 10th, but the Documentary of Party Monster  is out already since like last year...

Oh yeah... 1 more thing... Disco Blood Bath was rereleased in 1999 as Party monster... that's why I coudn't find it...

Shane... if you're reaeding this... :::Osby does happy dance::: Dude.. I finally got it!!!  I miss U FooL!

Take Care,
Peace-> ObY {8O)

Subject: [sfraves] Manni's B-day party 

--=====================_10009603==.ALT
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"; format=flowed

We arrived at Manni's birthday party around 12:30 am.  The party was at a 
relatively small warehouse space on Folsom that has been used off and on 
for underground events for as long as I can remember.  The current owners 
are two cool guys who run a video editing business upstairs.  This space is 
excellent for small, intimate gatherings.  Manni's party was not small or 
intimate.

Since we arrived after midnight we were charged $15.00 a head, which I 
thought was pricey...but, hell, it WAS Manni's birthday.  After we got 
inside and I took one look at the large crowd inside my first reaction was 
to bail.  Almost immediately, however, we were greeted with hugs from a 
number of friends, some going back to the FMR days, so we decided to plunge 
in and deal.

After standing in the refreshments line to score some beers for over twenty 
minutes, an aggressive woman and her entourage plowed past us and battled 
her way to the bar.  Stuff like this really pisses me off and I was ready 
to go off on this woman when she turned around and offered to buy us 
whatever we wanted since she had crashed the line.  OK.  I thought this was 
cool.  A woman not only of decisive action but of heart.  So armed with 
free drinks we sloshed our way through the masses to find a spot to 
dance.  Literally, a spot.  This was one of those deals where you're lucky 
to find a body-sized space where you can move up and down with occasional 
sideways action if your neighbor is friendly.

The crowd was a mixture of the old house music community and 
the..."others."  The old school house folks know how to party, indeed.  But 
having come up through the early days of raving here they practice respect 
on the dance floor.  In a crowded venue this respect and desire for unity 
can make or break the vibe.  The "others" are people with self-interested 
personal agendas who have little regard for those around them.  While a 
respectful dancer will move with grace and a smiling face through a crowd, 
gently touching those he/she wishes to pass, the "others" push and shove, 
displacing dancers so that, often, they can have animated conversations on 
the floor when they could taken this to the back of the room where there is 
no dancing.  Since this was an event at an unpermitted venue I assumed 
there would be few of the "others."  Unfortunately, there were more than I 
would have liked and there was a...clash of values.  The peaceful and 
loving can't win with blatant aggression.  You can, tho, ignore it and 
focus on the music and the good folk.  And that's what I did.  That, and 
many bowls.

I ignored the woman dancing with her back to me and pounding my ribs with 
her elbows.  Break dance circles are a welcome addition on a spacious dance 
floor.   Here it was a Draconian act of selfishness.  Especially since the 
dancers were less than mediocre.  But...I ignored the many times I was 
pushed against the wall, and had my feet smashed, and you know...it 
worked.  I actually had a good time.  Anger management:)

Truthfully, I was swept up by the music.  I haven't heard Garth in 
awhile.  Last time I experienced him was at a Wicked and his set was, IMO, 
undanceable.  Garth has always been something of a wild card.  The guy can 
be brilliant and innovative.  He loves to experiment.  Sometimes it works, 
and then....  But at Manni's b-day he was on!!!   His music has 
evolved.  Genre busting.  Lot of "acid funk," as it were, and one thing 
Wicked always did well was funk.  Deeply moving, and I moved as best I 
could to this psychedelic booty music.

We inched our way, finally, to the DJ booth about halfway through Garth's 
set and stayed there until the party ended.  Jeno closed the evening.  He 
did three sets that night:  first in SF, than out to San Jose, and then 
back for Manni's.  I have much love for this man.  I owe all of the Wicked 
collective enormous respect and gratitude for showing me what is was to 
"rave,"  but Jeno has always been closest to my heart.  Needless to say his 
set was the perfect ending to the evening.

Manni had a good time.  Guy was stoned, dancing, and takin' in the 
love.  And so did I, all things considered.  The old friends and the music 
made it for me and I left at six happy and refreshed....and dripping in sweat.

Love,

Apollo

Apollo,
That was an excellent review. Thanks for the update.

I also get quite impatient when I am at a crowded event. (that is, when I
don't have enough room to dance).

You captured the "anger management" aspect quite eloquently.

Patience is indeed a virtue. I'll bring a bowl with me the next time I'm at
a popular party!
I'm sure it will help me move into a mellow, sweaty, groove, hehehe!

Of course, I like to use my long, tall arms and rib right back at those
"pounding rib dancers"! But I haven't tried my aerobic, high leg kicks yet
(for the circle jerks).

Greg VP

on the dance floor.  In a crowded venue this respect and desire for unity
can make or break the vibe.  The "others" are people with self-interested
personal agendas who have little regard for those around them.  While a
respectful dancer will move with grace and a smiling face through a crowd,
gently touching those he/she wishes to pass, the "others" push and shove,
displacing dancers so that, often, they can have animated conversations on
the floor when they could taken this to the back of the room where there is
no dancing.  Since this was an event at an unpermitted venue I assumed
there would be few of the "others."  Unfortunately, there were more than I
would have liked and there was a...clash of values.  The peaceful and
loving can't win with blatant aggression.  You can, tho, ignore it and
focus on the music and the good folk.  And that's what I did.  That, and
many bowls.

I ignored the woman dancing with her back to me and pounding my ribs with
her elbows.  Break dance circles are a welcome addition on a spacious dance
floor.   Here it was a Draconian act of selfishness.  Especially since the
dancers were less than mediocre.  But...I ignored the many times I was
pushed against the wall, and had my feet smashed, and you know...it
worked.  I actually had a good time.  Anger management:)

Truthfully, I was swept up by the music.  I haven't heard Garth in
awhile.  Last time I experienced him was at a Wicked and his set was, IMO,
undanceable.  Garth has always been something of a wild card.  The guy can
be brilliant and innovative.  He loves to experiment.  Sometimes it works,
and then....  But at Manni's b-day he was on!!!   His music has
evolved.  Genre busting.  Lot of "acid funk," as it were, and one thing
Wicked always did well was funk.  Deeply moving, and I moved as best I
could to this psychedelic booty music.

We inched our way, finally, to the DJ booth about halfway through Garth's
set and stayed there until the party ended.  Jeno closed the evening.  He
did three sets that night:  first in SF, than out to San Jose, and then
back for Manni's.  I have much love for this man.  I owe all of the Wicked
collective enormous respect and gratitude for showing me what is was to
"rave,"  but Jeno has always been closest to my heart.  Needless to say his
set was the perfect ending to the evening.

Manni had a good time.  Guy was stoned, dancing, and takin' in the
love.  And so did I, all things considered.  The old friends and the music
made it for me and I left at six happy and refreshed....and dripping in
sweat.

Love,

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Manni's B-day party

I guess we should have stayed longer. All I know is that the music was not
on spot when we got there at 12:05am. Paying $15 for a UG that had no
decorations and charged for refreshments bothered me. The saving grace was
seeing some friends and talking for a bit. I rarely bother to go out these
days since quality events have seemed to have taken a nosedive into the
ground. Around 1:30 the music got better and then suddenly it went back to
way too deep SF dubby house (think of a Sunset party around 3pm on a Sunday)
for the peak time slots.

I agree that the crowd was mixed. A lot of random club folk that came
pouring in as the bars shut down elsewhere. I think I pretty much stood in
one place the whole night in a daze trying to figure out that party. I like
that space and it has been around for a long time, but it never used to get
packed like that nor with such a club crowd. It would seem that if we had
stayed later and the music did in fact become a bit more *energetic* that
things would have been a lot better. However the 2 hours I stayed were just
*ew*  I'll go back to hibernation again once the 80's Prom Party this
weekend is over. =)

Subject: [sfraves] Manni's B-day party


We arrived at Manni's birthday party around 12:30 am.  The party was at a
relatively small warehouse space on Folsom that has been used off and on
for underground events for as long as I can remember.  The current owners
are two cool guys who run a video editing business upstairs.  This space is
excellent for small, intimate gatherings.  Manni's party was not small or
intimate.

Since we arrived after midnight we were charged $15.00 a head, which I
thought was pricey...but, hell, it WAS Manni's birthday.  After we got
inside and I took one look at the large crowd inside my first reaction was
to bail.  Almost immediately, however, we were greeted with hugs from a
number of friends, some going back to the FMR days, so we decided to plunge
in and deal.

After standing in the refreshments line to score some beers for over twenty
minutes, an aggressive woman and her entourage plowed past us and battled
her way to the bar.  Stuff like this really pisses me off and I was ready
to go off on this woman when she turned around and offered to buy us
whatever we wanted since she had crashed the line.  OK.  I thought this was
cool.  A woman not only of decisive action but of heart.  So armed with
free drinks we sloshed our way through the masses to find a spot to
dance.  Literally, a spot.  This was one of those deals where you're lucky
to find a body-sized space where you can move up and down with occasional
sideways action if your neighbor is friendly.

The crowd was a mixture of the old house music community and
the..."others."  The old school house folks know how to party, indeed.  But
having come up through the early days of raving here they practice respect
on the dance floor.  In a crowded venue this respect and desire for unity
can make or break the vibe.  The "others" are people with self-interested

I recently was given some earplugs and the thought never crossed my mind to 
use em.  I have been in plenty of situations where Im at a venue and the 
music is blasting...  I say to myself, "My ears will be ringin in the 
mornin!"  It just seems like an akward thing to get used to...not to 
mention, my drunk ass will probably forget to take em out when some fine 
chica is talkn to me.

I'm not a DJ and I don't know any of the specifics, but let me recall 
something that was on SF Raves a few years back. Greg Sandler, a house DJ who used to 
run (own?) the Harmonics record store in Santa Rosa and threw the Harmonics 
parties, suffered a great deal of hearing loss due to years of spinning. He got 
special DJ earplugs that filter out the "bad" frequencies, and I believe 
there was at least one round of surgery, but after taking some time off and having 
something of a comeback, Greg has retired from DJ'ing. I hear he's in real 
estate or some other field that doesn't require working in such a loud 
environment. 

When Greg was posting regularly to SF Raves, he was urging DJs to get the 
special DJ earplugs. I don't have any info at all about where to get them; all I 
can do is pass on his recommendation. 
Greg, if you're reading this, sorry if there's anything I didn't get right, 
and I hope you're doing well.

really pretty bad right now and the thought of losing enough hearing
where I could not play music just makes me cringe. I have taken the

plugs. Oh and as for the women talking to you. When you wear earplugs it
is almost easier to hear which means no thinking they are asking for sex
when they are really saying they need to leave at 6. Peace

I use the inexpensive foam kind you can buy in bulk packages from 
hardware stores for $2, but normally only wear them when I'm off the 
dancefloor (or when the deejay's playlist isn't worth hearing 
impairment). It means the difference between my hearing recovering by 
the time I wake up the next day versus a dull ringing noise that can 
last a day & a half. No interference with the fine chica interaction 
factor, though their conversations with me tend to not last beyond "Cool 
shirt, where did you get it?" or "Is this the line for the bar?"

Hi, thanks Chet, yes I believe the earplugs at the site  
http://www.earinc.com/p2-specialty-musician.php are just like the ones Greg Sandler was 
recommending years ago. They're made to fit each individual ear and block a measurable 
amount of sound. 
While the simple foam plugs do protect your hearing somewhat, I think they're 
really for casual users (i.e., ok for ravers, who can move away from the 
speakers) but not suitable for people who are exposed to constant sound at high 
levels (DJs, musicians, and even music teachers!). 
And ... for all you ravers ... please don't spend too much time right in 
front of the speakers! Yeah it feels cool to have the bass thumping through your 
body, but do you really want to be deaf when you get older? Do you want to be 
like Beethoven, able to feel the music he wrote but not to hear it? When I'm 
walking past a speaker, I'll hold my hand up to protect the ear that's closer to 
the speaker. 
Love the music -- and keep loving it!  Preserve your hearing.

i always wear them when i prepare well.  it doesn't my enjoyment of the music whatsoever.

also, this may be just my opinion, but i was at the doc martin event right next to the speakers and i forgot my earplugs.  i experienced no ringing.  the sound never hurt either.
which leads me to believe that quality of sound engineering relates directly to damage.  now, who was the sound company???

anyways, earplugs. use them.  if you plan to live forever like i do, hearing is a cool sense to hang on to.

JOnas

p.s.  i have partial deafness due rock concerts and speaker humping in my youth.  i don't want to lose anymore functionality.

Depends on the venue and the sound system. I've put in earplugs before and
the sound quality drastically dropped, muffling it to the point where
there was no point, if you dig. I usually only wear them if i'm at a club
or a party with a 'OMGWTFD00DBIGFUKINSOUNDSYSTEMOMGOMG' kinda theme going.
Unless there's towers of speakers, there never seems to have been a point
for me...

then again, my hearing's already starting to go.

Subject: RE: [sfraves]Earplugs?  Do you use em?

If the sound is muffled when you wear earplugs it is just allowing you
to hear a shitty sound system. Earplugs block out dangerous sound waves
not all sound. Most sound companies do not know a thing about eqing but
if it is so loud most people cannot tell. Once you pop in earplugs you
hear the true quality of sound. I find dj mixes are much clearer with
plugs in. You hear the records not the distortion of the sound.

Depends on the venue and the sound system. I've put in earplugs before
and
the sound quality drastically dropped, muffling it to the point where
there was no point, if you dig. I usually only wear them if i'm at a
club
or a party with a 'OMGWTFD00DBIGFUKINSOUNDSYSTEMOMGOMG' kinda theme
going.
Unless there's towers of speakers, there never seems to have been a
point
for me...

then again, my hearing's already starting to go.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] out-of-sight friday night

A Thump at 550 is the only way to go to a Thump party. I'm just not cool off
the DNA lounge for a Thump event. I think the first Thump I ever went to was
the Double Dragon at 550 night. It was pretty damn cool and well worth the
$20 I paid at the time. I remember thinking that $20 for a club was stupid
but then I walked in and realized there were 4 rooms and shit was going off.
If I didn't have setup for the 80's Prom that night I would totally go. Yes
I know it goes all night but I'm saving my energy! =)

Not usually. The various collectives I'm in have been around a
while, and the sound engineering has gotten spectacularly good. The
systems sound clean, have fat bass, *and* the volume is less than
earplug level, except right in front of the drivers.

better than 100 big bucks from a stranger, it is the one and only vintage style chanson du jour!!!! bringing it on, because if you were never a rocker before today, welcome to the club, and if you were, here is what you needed to get through it:
 
this is WHITESNAKE "SLOW 'AN EASY".....
 
"so take me down slow 'an easy...make love to me slow 'an easy...i know that hard luck 'an trouble are heading my way...so rock me till i burnt to the bone...rock me till i'm burnt to the bone"...:)

The Details:
The proceeds from this event will assist in paying off a big fine from
when the Epiphany party was busted.  Tickets are only 5 dollars - you
can buy them:

- Via paypal (with a $1 service fee) at this link: 
http://home.earthlink.net/~st_indigo/retro/retro.html

or..

- At the door

**** NOTICE!  If you buy tickets via paypal, you'll need to bring your
ticket receipt with you for admittance! **** 

Since this event is limited to 150 people, it's important for you to
rsvp so we know how many ultra-super-bitchin' retro-freaks to expect. 

Be sure and get your supermodel fashion photo taken by the lovely Araya
on the way in, then freak out with yummy punch, trashy snacks, and a
pile of cheap, meaningless toys.  You are encouraged to BYOB, ('long as
you share with us!)  Visuals by Viberation and a great local graffiti
art show will dazzle the eyes!  You may even be compelled to wear
sunglasses.. at night. 

This may just be your last chance to finally do prom night right, and
pogo madly to the beat of a bygone era.  Comon, comon, come get your
flourescents on!  Be smart, kids- respect the venue and its tenants. 
Brace yourself for a mondo-insano party and email scarpetta80@yahoo.com
for more info BEFORE IT'S TOOOO LATE!!!!

Psych! Jinx! 1, 2, 3, 4...

	LOL!  Nice one, Jason... Seriously, I don't like to go out without my 
earplugs either. I'll often bring a few extra pairs in case others 
going with me or people I run into may want some. Asking for them at 
the clubs and parties you go to -- and if the people running the space 
don't have them available, talking to them a little bit about the 
dangers of hearing loss -- will also help give the issue of ear 
protection a higher profile in the scene.

Groove on,

Oh cmon ryan, didn't you just get back from a week snowboarding???

Sounds like you have extra energy to spare. :P

A LOT of people are looking forward to the event this Friday at 550 and
with good reason. Neuromotor is going to be so RAD. I saw him play at a
campout this summer and the energy mixed with the urgency of the music
created quite an event!

A Thump at 550 is the only way to go to a Thump party. I'm just not cool
off
the DNA lounge for a Thump event. I think the first Thump I ever went to
was
the Double Dragon at 550 night. It was pretty damn cool and well worth
the
$20 I paid at the time. I remember thinking that $20 for a club was
stupid
but then I walked in and realized there were 4 rooms and shit was going
off.
If I didn't have setup for the 80's Prom that night I would totally go.
Yes
I know it goes all night but I'm saving my energy! =)

Subject: [sfraves] NRR: Voting in the Democratic primaries

Public service announcement: if you are not registered either
"Democratic Party" or "Decline to State" in time to vote on Super
Tuesday, March 2, you will not be able to vote for a 2004 Democratic
presidential nominee.

The California Secretary of State's site does not go out of its way to
advertise this fact. It's explained backhandedly under the obscure
heading, "Decline to State,"
(http://www.ss.ca.gov/elections/elections_decline.htm)
and a little better in the dumbled-down but informative "Easy Voter
Guide,"
(http://easyvoter.org/california/nextelection/2004-primary/index2.html)
which is a joint project of the Secretary of State's office and private
civic organizations.

For the horse's mouth, see the California Elections Code provisions
(http://leginfo.public.ca.gov/cgi-bin/calawquery?codesection=elec&codebody=&hits=20)
in the 2100s and the 13100s. Especially Sections 2151 and 2152 here
(http://leginfo.public.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=elec&group=02001-03000&file=2150-2168).

Registration must be 15 days before the election. See Sec. 2102.
(http://leginfo.public.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=elec&group=02001-03000&file=2100-2124)


Don't forget, "Decline to State" is a valid option.

-- 
What this says to me is that too many whites are getting away with drug
use, too many whites are getting away with drug sales, too many whites
are getting away with trafficking in this stuff. The answer to this
disparity is not to start letting people out of jail because we're not
putting others in jail who are breaking the law. The answer is to go out
and find the ones who are getting away with it, convict them and send
them up the river, too."

As much as I hate the Demopublicans, with the Republicans stealing the
Democratic Judicial Committee members' files, I really think not
supporting whoever the Democratic candidate is and making sure that
George Jr. follows in his dad's steps as a one term prez would be a bad
choice.

and find the ones who are getting away with it, convict them and send
them up the river, too."

- Rush Limbaugh. October 5, 1995 show transcript.

"Opinions are my own only, and do not necessarily represent those of
KZSU Radio or Stanford University." (or words to that effect.)

Actually the advantage of the "professional" earplugs isn't so much in  
the amount of protection they provide, as the frequencies they  
attenuate.  Those little foam earplugs actually reduce the noise level  
MORE than most of the pro models.  The ones DanceSafe distributes these  
days are rated for 32 dB IIRC, while the ER-20s on that site only  
attenuate 20 dB.  (Remember, the decibels scale is logarithmic.  An  
increase of 10 dB represents a 10x increase in the intensity of the  
sound hitting your ears!.)

The difference is, that the foam earplugs only reduce the intensity of  
some frequencies, mainly the higher ones, leaving the bass to go ahead  
and flow through you.  That's why the music sounds muffled and washed  
out.  This is just fine if you're just the raver at the party.  But if  
the DJ or soundguy is hearing some frequencies more or less than  
others, that can lead to some really fuxored settings and some really  
fuxored sound.  The "pro" earplugs, therefore, aren't designed so much  
for reducing the intensity of sound; but making sure they reduce all  
frequencies as close to equally as they can; so that the DJ/soundguy  
can get some protection, but still hear the music "correctly".

(Though I'm convinced that *I* am so used to having earplugs in at  
pretty much every party that my brain compensates automaticlly; even to  
the el-cheapo foam earplugs.  After the first few minutes of having the  
earplugs in, the music starts to sound "right" again.  And if I take  
them out for something later, it sounds all tinny to me, like the DJ is  
using way too much treble.)

Incidently, the OSHA standard for permissible noise exposure over an  
8-hour workday is 90 dB.  That's equivelent to a household blender at  
three feet.  To contrast, the last time DanceSafe took its sound meter  
to a Skills party (Popsice 4 at the Bill Graham center) the levels in  
the middle of the main room were routinely in the 120-130 dB range.  So  
yeah, I'd say that earplugs are pretty much a necessity.

More information about the decibel scale can be found here:

--=====================_1874355==.ALT
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"; format=flowed

The 2003 Darwin Award Winners:

1. When his 38-calibre revolver failed to fire at his intended victim
during a hold-up in Long Beach, California, would be robber James Elliot
did something that can only inspire wonder. He peered down the barrel and
tried the trigger again. This time it worked.....

2. The chef at a hotel in Switzerland lost a finger in a meat cutting
machine and, after a little hopping around, submitted a claim to his
insurance company. The company suspecting negligence, sent out one of its
men to have a look for himself. He tried the machine and also lost a
finger. The chef's claim was approved.

3. A man who shovelled snow for an hour to clear a space for his car
during a blizzard in Chicago returned with his Vehicle to find a woman had
taken the space.
Understandably, he shot her.

4. After stopping for drinks at an illegal bar, a Zimbabwean bus driver
found that the 20 mental patients he was supposed to be transporting from
Harare to Bulawayo had escaped. Not wanting to admit his incompetence, the
driver went to a nearby bus stop and offered everyone waiting there a free
ride. He then delivered the passengers to the mental hospital, telling the
staff that the patients were very excitable and prone to bizarre fantasies.
The deception wasn't discovered for 3 days.

5. An American teenager was in the hospital recovering from serious head
wounds received from an oncoming train. When asked how he received the
injuries, the lad told police that he was simply trying to see how close
he could get his head to a moving train before he was hit.


6. A man walked into a Louisiana Circle-K, put a $20 bill on the counter,
and asked for change. When the clerk opened the cash drawer, the man
pulled a gun and asked for all the cash in the register, which the clerk
promptly provided. The man took the cash from the clerk and fled, leaving
the $20
bill on the counter. The total amount of cash he got from the
drawer...$15. (If someone points a gun at you and gives you money, is a
crime committed?)

7. A thief burst into a Florida bank one day wearing a ski mask and
carrying a gun. Aiming his gun at the guard, the thief yelled, "FREEZE,
MOTHER-STICKERS, THIS IS A F*** UP!" For a moment, everyone was silent.
Then the sniggers started. The security guard completely lost it and
doubled over laughing. It probably saved his life, because he'd been about
to draw his gun. He couldn't have drawn and fired before the thief got
him. The thief ran away and is still at large. In memory of the event, the
banker later put a plaque on the wall engraved with the words:

"Freeze, mother- stickers, this is a F***-up!"

8. Seems an Arkansas guy wanted some beer pretty badly. He decided that
he'd just throw a cinderblock through a liquor store window, grab some
booze, and run. So he lifted the cinderblock and heaved it over his head
at the window.
The cinderblock bounced back and hit the would-be thief on the head,
knocking him unconscious. The liquor store window was made of Plexiglas.
The whole event was caught on videotape.

9. As a female shopper exited a New York convenience store, a man grabbed
her purse and ran. The clerk called 911 immediately, and the woman was
able to give them a detailed description of the snatcher. Within minutes,
the police apprehended the snatcher. They put him in the car and drove
back to the store. The thief was then taken out of the car and told to
stand there for a positive ID. To which he replied, "Yes, officer, that's
her. That's the lady I stole the purse from."

10. The Ann Arbor News crime column reported that a man walked into a
Burger King in Ypsilanti, Michigan, at 5 a.m., flashed a gun, and demanded
cash. The clerk turned him down because he said he couldn't open the cash
register without a food order. When the man ordered onion rings, the clerk
said they weren't available for breakfast. The man, frustrated, walked
away.

A 5-STAR STUPIDITY AWARD WINNER!

11. When a man attempted to siphon gasoline from a motor home parked on a
Seattle street, he got much more than he bargained for.
Police arrived at the scene to find a very sick man curled up next to a
motor home near spilled sewage. A police spokesman said that the man
admitted to trying to steal gasoline and plugged his siphon hose into the
motor home's sewage tank by mistake. The owner of the vehicle declined to
press charges, saying that it was the best laugh he'd ever had.

"Security is mostly a superstition.  It does not exist in nature, nor do 
the children of humans as a whole experience it.  Avoiding danger is no 
safer in the long run than outright exposure.  Life is either a daring 
adventure or nothing."
-Helen Keller

"Fascism should more properly be called corporatism because it is the 
merger of state and corporate power."

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the

Subject: [sfraves] inside the tomb [a poem - not necessarily rave related]

i still remember the sights,
the smells of earth,
with green grass and sunlight
touching my hair

i learned to spin
my own tomb
to hide away from
the world
so no one could
see the pain
of wings breaking
through my back

and the struggle
of tearing free
from my own construct
to rediscover life,
transformed.

a distant voice
calls "a new dawn,
a new day,
come out and play
with the other
butterflies"

and heart weary
as the fresh air
burns my eyes
i find
that i can fly

(happy wednesday)

This is misinformation.  dB IS logarithmic, but the scale is a factor of 2x
for every 6 dB.

If you attenuate by 6 dB you are reducing the sound by 1/2.  If you attenuate
12 dB, you are reducing the sound by 3/4.

campaign and now he has to pay it back with his own money that he has pleanty of? 
perhaps he was contemplating using the money that was raised after his campaign 
to pay it back, but now that he knows that he would get sued if he did that, 
his decision has been made for him. now he doesn't have to choose he just knows 
he has to use his own money to pay back the loan. is it that surprising that 
he's pleased with the court's decision? what's going? who is the hell would be 
angry about this? all if have to say about this article is "DUR" that's right 
"dur"

Are you sure?  'Cause both links I found say that it's a log10.

I could very well be wrong.  I knew that it was a logarithmic scale, 
but wasn't 100% sure that it was log10.  That's why I googled for it, 
and posted those links; both of which say it's log10.  Usually if two 
or more links from the front page of a google search agree with my 
recollection, I assume I remembered right.

It doesn't really matter though.  Either way, there's no getting around 
the fact that the sound levels at most parties are well above safety 
standards.

log10 does not mean it is a factor of 10.


#include <stdio.h>
#include <math.h>

int
main(void)
{
	float n = 2.0;
	float m = 6.0;
	printf("factor of %f -> %f dB gain\n", n, 20 * log10(n));

Subject: RE: [sfraves] [hohners] FW: Cap'n Crunch passes on to groovier pastures (fwd)

WOW! so sad :(
i remember crunch from all the early parties. he used to post his travel 
diary to the list back in 95 when he did consulting for firms all over; the 
most memorable was his travels to australia. he wrote a great deal about the 
early jungle scene there on SFR. upon returning he was one of the first 
regulars to attend stareye's and my weekly jungle party 'nuff respect'. he 
was truly knowledgable about the music, and i might add was probably the 
first person in the bay area hardkore into happyhardcore...
he was always in his tye-died purple shirt dancing furiously to all the 
beats thrown at him and the crowd at just about every party i ever spun 
at/attended. he had more energy than people half his age.
not the least, he was truly a nice person once you broke through and started 
to talk to him. i will miss him as much as anyone else; and mourn the loss 
of one of the first bay area junglists....

Thanks bro....I hope you can make it out.  A fellow concerned listee from sacraves alerted me to the mistake.  Apparently the link is spelled in "CAPITALS."  To access my web page go to the same address but spelled in lower case letters.  Thanks again for the heads up, hopefully we'll see you on Friday.

Subject: [sfraves] BSP: Osteen on An Epiphany Of Sound today (9a-11a)

Hola,
Today I'll be presenting DJ/Producer Osteen on An Epiphany Of Sound
between 9a and 11a.  He sits in the Progressive Trance lot, so expect a
perfect beginning to your day.  Also, since he's produced a fair number
of tracks also, he promises to mix in these originals along with the
set.

Do listen in.  The usual ticket giveaways are in store too.  90.1 FM in
the bay area, and online at http://kzsulive.stanford.edu

Peace, out.

What this says to me is that too many whites are getting away with drug
use, too many whites are getting away with drug sales, too many whites
are getting away with trafficking in this stuff. The answer to this
disparity is not to start letting people out of jail because we're not
putting others in jail who are breaking the law. The answer is to go out
and find the ones who are getting away with it, convict them and send
them up the river, too."

he does have a thing for boys and the infamous "work
out". ho is a great guy, helped me out years (early
90's) ago in a time of need.

i read this is a mistake. a different capt. crunch. i
have known crunch for 14 years or so and i know he is
not married. this is supposed to be a different capt.
crunch.

Is it maybe the guy on the cereal box?  that would really be a shame. 
he seemed like such a nice guy, and his cereal was good, too.  a little 
sugary, but good.

.needing to vent.

Is anyone else completely sick of online record stores? I place an =
order, 7 days later it hasn't shipped yet and they still can only fill =
half the order. Not to mention the 2 weeks it takes to ship by horse and =
buggy. Nobody can keep shit in stock, and even if it says in-stock, you =
get an email days later saying it isn't.=20

I always had a good experience with Groovetech (RIP); They were quick =
and never emailed to say something I had ordered wasn't in stock. I =
don't mind a company being out of stock on something's...but be honest =
about it. The worst is thinking you are going to get a tune you have =
been searching for, then only to find out you aren't...what a horrible =
customer experience that is. I can tell you I cringe everytime I order =
from satellite, cause I know only half my order is actually gonna make =
it. But these jokers like satellite, dancrecords.com, [insert other =
wannabe record site here], never have anything except shit people don't =
buy anyways. "Oh really you have advanced promos of someone no one has =
heard about, that the label probably gave you, GREAT!~" [sarcasm]

Even companies like 3Beat, which I am willing to pay the hefty shipping =
charge to get good tunes, are inconsistent.

Are there any 'real' stores in SF that focus on =
tribal/progressive/breaks? Believe I would rather support the local =
scene/economy if someone knows of an outlet I can tap into. I am sick of =
ordering online...And you know what the worst of it is...they wonder why =
we are all downloading mp3's - CAUSE WE CAN"T GET THE TUNES. No it isn't =
right, but, [insert solution here]=20

[sighs] Thanks for letting me vent SFR. Right now I feel like the =
weather outside...muggy.

I've been very satisifed with Dancerecords.com (out of Emeryville) and
Dancegrooves.com (out of... uh... Holland).  Dancerecords.com usually gets
my order to me 2 days after I've put it in (with free shipping over $50)
and I think an order has been incomplete due to stock issues only once, if
ever.  Dancegrooves.com can take a while longer (7+ days after the order)
but the two times I've used them I've gotten the complete order.

Neither of those sites may be the best for prog/tribal/breaks, but they're
great for my fluffy trance needs.  =P

Subject: Re: [sfraves]Earplugs?  Do you use em? (what did you say !?!?)

:.note: for those non-techs, skip to the plug recomendation towards the end.:.

john,

you're confusing Log10 with Log10(10).  "Log10" is the formal method of writing Log(base10) in
mathematical formulae, which is just an operation, not an equation.  because Log10 is the most
common logarythmic function, most texts use simply "Log" to refer to it, and any other base must be
explicitly stated. only if you see a definite space between the "Log" and the "10" portion, can you
assume that the base is "10."  otherwise, it is the operation Log(base10).  Just as Log(base  e)x is
shorthanded as Ln(x), Log(base10)x is shorthanded as simply Log(x).

Log 10 = Log10(10) = 1

now for your decBels question...

the Bel is defined as the ratio of two power levels A and B:

y = Log(B/A), so to find deciBel, it is 10Log(B/A)

so if earplugs "a" and are 6dB of attenuation, plugs "b" are12dB attenuation,  and "A" and "B" is
the amount of acoustic energy they block (respectively), then to find how much more acoustic energy
is blocked by plugs "b" than plugs "a", we can represented this by the equation:

("b"dB - "a"dB) = 10Log(B/A) => 6/10 = Log(A/B) => B/A = 10^(0.6) = 4

=>> plug "b" blocks 4 times as much accoustical energy as plugs "a".

just as an fyi, if "a" and "b" were 30dB and 33dB, the answer would have been 2, or double the
accoustic power... that is left as an excersize for the reader :P


RECOMENDATION:
and with that out of the way, i can highly recommend the ER-20s.  the attenuation is very good while
not killing all the high frequencies like foam plugs, and they are cheap.  the only problem i've had
with them is that they come in only one size, so if your ear is very small (lke mine), you may
experience some discomfort after many-many hours of use.  otherwise, big thumbsup, and they come in
colors for you candy types who give a sh*t about those things :)

http://www.etymotic.com/musicians/er20morec.html

now if only i could remember to bring them with me !

tim, i'm assuming your an electrical engineer (or an exhuberant 1st year EE major ? ;) 'cause  your

Subject: Re: [sfraves] ATP: SRR: Online Vinyl Buying aka Foaming at the Mouth

hehe

yeah yknow I thought about selling like mainly records before. . . I didn't
really see how I could realistically keep all of the information of the
website updated often enough, or keep good track of what was where when
there were hundreds and hundreds of part numbers, and order numbers, and all
of that.
I kinda wondered how most of these other places do it.

godd it must be a paperwork nightmare. . . .

: )

.needing to vent.

Is anyone else completely sick of online record stores? I place an order, 7
days later it hasn't shipped yet and they still can only fill half the
order. Not to mention the 2 weeks it takes to ship by horse and buggy.
Nobody can keep shit in stock, and even if it says in-stock, you get an
email days later saying it isn't.

I always had a good experience with Groovetech (RIP); They were quick and
never emailed to say something I had ordered wasn't in stock. I don't mind a
company being out of stock on something's...but be honest about it. The
worst is thinking you are going to get a tune you have been searching for,
then only to find out you aren't...what a horrible customer experience that
is. I can tell you I cringe everytime I order from satellite, cause I know
only half my order is actually gonna make it. But these jokers like
satellite, dancrecords.com, [insert other wannabe record site here], never
have anything except shit people don't buy anyways. "Oh really you have
advanced promos of someone no one has heard about, that the label probably
gave you, GREAT!~" [sarcasm]

Even companies like 3Beat, which I am willing to pay the hefty shipping
charge to get good tunes, are inconsistent.

Are there any 'real' stores in SF that focus on tribal/progressive/breaks?
Believe I would rather support the local scene/economy if someone knows of
an outlet I can tap into. I am sick of ordering online...And you know what
the worst of it is...they wonder why we are all downloading mp3's - CAUSE WE
CAN"T GET THE TUNES. No it isn't right, but, [insert solution here]

[sighs] Thanks for letting me vent SFR. Right now I feel like the weather
outside...muggy.

My information is based on sound pressure level, not power.  SPL more
closely corresponds to what we hear.

And for the record, I'm a software geek. :)

Subject: Re: [sfraves] ATP: SRR: Online Vinyl Buying aka Foaming at the      Mouth

I've been to Dance Records shop before and they're on top of things. A lot
of local dj's used to (some still?) work there and shipping is fast. Jay
Walker was a former employee of the place (reason I was there) and got a lot
of his stuff from work. I count them as a local shop since I could walk to
their place.

Else - Primal in Berkeley (across from skills), BPM in Hayes Valley (SF) are
some good shops too if you want to avoid the Skills store.

It appears that a lot of people are going to our party and more so than =
we anticipated. A good thing because it's going to make Saturday that =
much more of a blast! However, we're securing admittance to all presale =
ticket holders and whatever is left after that will be at the door with =
no increase in ticket price. We have set capacity at 150 (so you're not =
packed in the place) for this event. On Wednesday we sent out emails =
containing the presale priority information resulting in a surge in =
sales. I highly suggest that if you plan on showing up late (raver.lag) =
that you get a presale. I don't want to have to tell friends that they =
can't get in due to the party being full.

Please tell your friends that plan on going about this! Door policy will =
be strict to protect the venue.

See a lot of you on Saturday! =3DD

:: r :: (yahoo.serious)


:: UPDATE ::

Due to an overwhelming response for this event, we
encourage those who plan on attending to purchase
their ticket via paypal on this webpage:

http://home.earthlink.net/~st_indigo/retro/retro.html

Presale ticket holders will be ensured admittance,
however we will have to turn away those looking to
purchase at the door if we fill to capacity. Paypal
sales will be discontinued at 3pm on Saturday 01/31.=20
Best advice is buy presale and get there early!"

this is a continuation of a superior fictional drama:
 
henry was always saying little thought provoking things to his favorite lady friend...that is why she always liked to sack out on his couch while he played with his dog. she never thought about anything past or future with him. she just liked his company. henry looked over at her every now and then hoping for some sort of reaction. hers were always the best, he thought. he also thought that she looked really cute tonight, and while he enjoyed quietly spying on her world, he also liked direct contact, and so he always made a point to see her and say things directly to her that he new she would like to hear, because he was like that.  he was also really excited about things like a cleaner environment, and he thought these kinds of things always started at home. henry thought about a lot of things. :)

Whats up everyone!  This is a more personal invitation to come out to Mach1 this weekend.  I'm really working my butt off to throw a great party every weekend for all of you out there to enjoy, but I need your help.  Please...help me, help you.  I have six weeks....thats right, just six weeks to changes this bar owner's prospective about raves, ravers, trance, and techno.  So Come on out and show your support for our scene.  This party is free every Friday night, there's jammin' beats all night long, it's at a totally 
un-COPulated venue, and the best part......IT'S FREE.  So get out here, dance up a storm, and show some love for what every DJ, promoter, producer, and party kid is trying to do.  To all my Frisco folk, I know it's a long way to go to party, but really, it's only 45mins in light traffic.  And to anyone who gets to smashed, come talk to me, I'll find you a place to go "after party" with cool people. You can make some new friends, sober up, and catch a few Zzzzs.  To all my Sacramento party kids and bar hoppers, GET OUT HERE!!! Show us all what the "Rave Capitol of the World" (straight from hyperreal.org) has to experience.  So that's my plea everyone.  Help me, help you have a kick a** Friday night.  Oh...also any Djs out there (SF, Sac, Mod, ect...) if you are intersted in playing out anygiven Friday, shot me an e-mail, I'm always down to give the hook up.  Thanks everyone!!!!!

hey gram,

i feel your pain with regard to support, but if you don't post
any information regarding the party (ie: infoline, DJs) then we
don't know what's up.

your link to the directions are working on your page, but the
flyer link is not.  just a heads-up...

in other news, we're hard at work for *forever young*, and
we'll be rockin the decks 80s style all saturday night in SF. 
hope to see some of you there.

Man.....everyones getting spoiled...I remember when you didn't know where the party was until the back of the U-HAUL opened. Joking of course.....not about the U-HAUL though.  All the event info is posted on my web site under Mach1, but since you asked:
Location: Brown's Corner Bar&Grill in Woodland (about 15 from Sacramento)
Time slots: 9pm- Dj Eddie Summers
                 10pm- Special Guest (This week: Dj Eep)
                 11:30- Dj Gram
Directions are posted at:  http://www.freewebs.com/djgram  
or, on yahoo maps look up: Intersection of: Main St. / Road 98 Woodland, Ca 95695
 
 I really hope to see a lot of the sfraves listees out there, I've been on the list for a long time and have met quite a few of you, but not as many as I would like to.  
"DjBigDaddy" thanks for the head check bro.

Ahh yes, I knew someone would ask for an info line number....there isn't one.  I figured, This is a weekly party, and most all of the promotion is online or local message boards so I just posted all of the info on my web site.  I don't know.....what do you guys think some of you have a lot more experience throwing partys than I do.....ya think I sould have one?  I just really didn't see a point.  I dont know.....everyone tell me what you think.

Subject: [sfraves] SRR: Evolution of the DJ Crossfader

http://www.rane.com/note146.html

http://www.rane.com/rosie.jpg

"Rosie" is the first known DJ mixer, circa 1965. Courtesy EMP.

Origination:
"...The DJ mixer crossfader was originally developed as a control for
implementing smooth fades from one program source to another, but where
did the idea come from? Fading between two independent sources was first
accomplished by DJs using two separate controls, often rotary controls.
They would maintain constant acoustic energy (equal loudness) in the room
while carefully fading from one program source to another. Some expertise
was required to accomplish this effect accurately and consistently. It
became obvious that if a way could be found to fade from one source to
another with a single control, the task would be much easier and
repeatable for the less experienced..."

HALLUCINOGENS COULD UNLOCK MYSTERY OF THE BRAIN

Some Debate Practical Uses Of Ancient Practice

Long before Timothy Leary and Ken Kesey and the counterculture generation
discovered hallucinogenic drugs, the Indians of western Mexico were using
peyote to commune with their gods.

Anthropologist Peter T.  Furst, who spent 30 years among the Huichol
people, says that Indian shamans have been using hallucinogenic plants as
a doorway to the divine for thousands of years, likely following a
tradition carried by their ancestors over the Bering Strait.

And now, some U.S.  scientists are exploring how these substances might be
used by doctors to battle anxiety, mental illness and alcoholism.

"These compounds hold tremendous potential for helping us understand how
the brain functions, and they have untapped potential for healing," said
Charles Grob, a psychiatry professor at UCLA Medical School.

Some early studies suggest that LSD can ease the sense of dread that
people feel when they are dying.  "There were some very interesting and
promising results," said Grob.  He recently secured approval from the Food
and Drug Administration to continue this line of inquiry using the milder
drug psilocybin, the active ingredient in hallucinogenic mushrooms.

"We're really on the threshold of a new era of formal and very tightly
controlled sanctioned studies with hallucinogens to study their safety and
efficacy," Grob said.

An ancient practice

In Philadelphia, a new show on peyote-inspired Huichol art opened this
month at the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Anthropology and
Archaeology.  Furst, curator of the exhibition, said these are religious
images, created with the ritual use of the cactus plant.

"There's a difference in nature between people who use this for religion
and those who are part of our counterculture," said Furst, 81.  A
German-born Jew, he moved to England and then the United States in the
1930s.  A vaguely European accent gives him a serious, professorial air.

After writing for Stars and Stripes during World War II, Furst worked as a
journalist for United Press before studying cultural anthropology.  He
made a specialty of studying shamanistic peoples and wrote numerous books,
including "Hallucinogens and Culture."

He maintains that nearly all hunter-gatherer societies practiced
shamanistic religions, which often used hallucinogens or other
mind-altering techniques to see gods, the underworld, the meaning of life.

Though he left the Penn museum a few years ago to live in Santa Fe, Furst
returned this month for the opening of the exhibit, "Mythic Visions," a
display of a Huichol artform known as yarn painting.  In depicting complex
arrays of dancing deer, snakes and other figures, the artist tries to
evoke the visions he experiences with peyote.

Small bands of Huichol travel for 300 miles to a desolate spot deep in the
Chihuahuan desert to hunt for the squat, round peyote cactus.  Furst said
he participated in Huichol peyote hunts and ceremonies and found the plant
extraordinarily unpalatable.

Archaeological finds in Texas show remnants of peyote that date back
around 7,000 years.  Even earlier finds show a hallucinogenic seed
associated with remains of giant mastodons and other Pleistocene animals
that go back at least 10,000 years.

Furst said he believed it was likely the Huichol and other tribes brought
a tradition of hallucinogen use from Siberia before they entered the
Americas more than 15,000 years ago.

'Divine inspiration'

Others see evidence for shamanism in early Europe.  "Shamanism emerged at
least 40,000 years ago and is reflected in Paleolithic rock art," said
Michael Winkelman, an anthropologist from Arizona State University.  "Not
all societies depended on hallucinogenic plants but where they found them,
people built up institutions around these substances," he said.  "They are
seen as a source of divine inspiration."

On Good Friday 1962, some researchers at Harvard gave a small group of
divinity students either psilocybin or a placebo.  Psilocybin, then legal,
works much like peyote.  "Eight of the nine people who got the drug
reported they had had the most profound spiritual experiences of their
lives," Winkelman said.

Hallucinogens act on receptors in the frontal cortex, sometimes called the
executive part of the brain because it's used for higher reasoning, he
said.  They also act on a part of the brain called the thalamus, Nichols
said, which works to help us distinguish what's novel and important.  That
may explain why people on LSD can become mesmerized by a flower or by
their own hand.

Effect on alcoholism

John Halpern, associate director of substance abuse research at Harvard
University and McLean Hospital, is investigating the possibility that
peyote prevents alcoholism in American Indians.

In a study he plans to publish within the next several months, he compared
cognitive and psychological health measures among Indians who were
alcoholics, those who regularly used peyote, and those who used no drugs
or alcohol.

Halpern said he can't reveal his study's results yet, but he will say he
sees no evidence that peyote damages the brain.  "There's no history of it
being addictive, or trafficked or abused," he said.  Peyote can be
dangerous if people use it to get stoned and then do stupid things, he
said, but that's not what happens in religious ceremonies.

Others, such as David Murray of the Office of National Drug Control Policy
in Washington, see more serious risk.  Working among the Navajo, he said,
he found long-term peyote use was "counterproductive to education and
social mobility."

Because the peyote comes from a natural plant, he said, "you're taking in
a powerful chemical stew," with some toxins in addition to the
psychoactive ingredient.  "It is, without question, a risky undertaking."

Subject: [sfraves] infoline, was, Re: [sfraves] A PLEA TO ALL FRIENDS, PARTY KIDS, 

hey Gram,

yeah an infoline is actually key in my opinion.  

first, it is another permanent medium for which to promote your event.  i personally call all infolines just to see what kind of energy, clarity and professionalism the crew or person has.  i remember martin's msgs from the gathering.  i would call over and over to listen to his hyped up messages.  i would get all amped up before the party!

second, who has wireless or onStar yet.  some do, but i would say most don't.   but, most people do have a cell phone or can stop at a pay phone.  i write the directions down to a party on paper, but sometimes i lose the paper on the way there.  at this point i call the infoline.

third, some people don't use the internet.  you don't want to leave them out of the good times you are providing.

i really think your sincereity and enthusiasm is really great.  you are doing a good job.

i am very interested in your event.  i would like to play techno for you one of these fridays.  I have great energy and I can help you make this a wonderful event.

Sincerely,
JOnas

Hi, here's a link to an interesting AOL-Time Magazine "match guide" that 
surveys you on your views on a number of issues and then tells you which 
candidates are closest to you in viewpoint. It includes all 7 of the remaining 
Democrats as well as GW Bush. 

I think this sort of thing is useful because it encourages people to think 
about the issues and not just go by emotion or be swayed by false logic.

did dj's actually use crossfaders in the 80's ? In all the old movies they
seemed to use more of a control panel with like pushbuttons. . .

by far the best fader I've ever used, is the infinity fader on my numark
prosm3 mixer. The no-friction design with the adjustable slope is the
quickest, smoothest, easiest adjusting fader that's never degraded in
quality.

takes some getting used to but after that it's just a bad ass f'ken mixer. .

Hi everyone!

I will be playing live on Thursday (the 29th) morning from around =
9am-11am pst on KZSU 90.1FM Stanford University radio.

I will be playing an all turntable, non-stop, progressive trance set. If =
you don't live in the South Bay you can listen on-line by clicking here:

http://www.kzsu.org

Be sure to listen in because I'm going to try and sneak in some of my =
original work.

If you miss the set, no problem, it will be recorded and posted in MP3 =
format later in the week here:

http://www.mixtapehost.com

Thanks for your support!

Steve Osteen

well thats good to hear.

RAIGAMBRE (rye-g=E3m-bre) - roots, stability, tradition

"Raigambre's Latin-funk fiesta is one of the best musical bets around town.=
" -Chris Macias, Sacramento Bee, Friday, October 10, 2003
This group of talented musicians has been in the Sacramento music scene in =
various forms (Los Gallos, Motivo, etc.) for quite some time now. However, =
since May of 2001 they have come together under the name Raigambre. They bl=
end several different musical genres such as salsa, Afro-Cuban rhythms, fun=
k, and Chicano Groove. Another unique quality of Raigambre is the represent=
ation within the group. Members come from various backgrounds such as Mexic=
an-American, Native-American, and Caucasian.

If someone were to ask what Raigambre's message and purpose is, your averag=
e listener and fan would answer "dancing and a whole lot of energy!" While =
that may be true, Raigambre's songs contain very deep and serious messages.=
 "Caradura" (Hard Face) is a song that describes the expression on the Azte=
c people=92s faces as they fought to keep their land. "Se=F1or Ignacio" (Mr=
=2E Ignacio), a Cumbia-driven song, depicts a tale of a migrant farm worker=
 who has cancer yet still works hard to feed his family regardless of his i=
llness and low wages.

According to Chris Macias, Sacramento Bee Pop Music Writer, "Raigambre is s=
haking up Sacramento=92s nightspots with its earthy grooves and musical che=
mistry." In addition to being nominated for a SAMMIE (Sacramento Area Music=
 Award) in 2002 and again in 2003 for best Latin music group, Raigambre has=
 appeared on the Tony Tecate Show on KSFM 102.5 and MTV=92s Sorority Life, =
as well as playing in numerous festivals such as Festival De La Familia (Sa=
c.CA), Heritage Fest (Sac.CA), Picnic Day & Earth Day (Davis, CA.) and KSFM=
=92s Cinco De Mayo Fest (Sac.CA).

"Raigambre=92s biggest strength is that the band possesses a clear sense of=
 its own sound; it knows exactly what it should sound like, and that gives =
the music a sense of self-assurance," says Sacramento News & Review=92s Chr=
istian Kiefer. With influences such as WAR, Poncho Sanchez, and their own b=
lend of "Afro-Cuban, Chicano groove", Raigambre brings back to the music sc=
ene the tradition of deep rooted music.

Thursday, February 12, 2004 ** Gene Farris @ The Lotus Lounge **

Gene Farris | BIO

Gene Farris is the sinister minister of dance music=B9s changing sounds. Fa=
rris=B9s global DJ track record and extensive discography of over forty pro=
ductions are definitely a testament to the true Chicago house sound. Farris=
's unique dexterous DJ style that includes extended sultry, melodic blends =
with tuff beats makes him a party favorite around the world. House music is=
 Farris's undoubted passion that also drives his full flavored, colorful st=
udio creations. Farris's deep roots in house music and strive to be the bes=
t keeps him on the global electronic music industry's cutting edge.


Pushed by local kids in his South Side neighborhood of Chicago Gene Farris =
caught the DJ bug at the tender age of twelve. Inspired by the likes of Ron=
 Hardy, Prince, and Roy Ayers Farris began blending a mixture of funk, disc=
o, and soul combined with eighties' pop icons such as, Duran Duran. One may=
 still hear hints of disco in his style.


Even in his early years Farris was constantly on the move. By making mix ta=
pes for his neighborhood buddies and selling them at many famed Windy City =
record stores like Gramaphone, Farris's spinning skills quickly developed. =
Not only did Farris's style evolve, his reputation rapidly grew. After many=
 late nights 'beatn' down neighborhood block parties, Farris earned his chi=
ldhood dream slot warming up for legendary Ron Hardy and Ron Carrol at the =
epic AKA Club.


As the early nineties approached, Gene Farris became a major player in the =
thriving Chicago dance scene. Wanting to hear more diverse house music Farr=
is inevitably began to produce his own tracks. His first production style w=
as tuff, loopy and tracky House. At the time Cajmere (of Green Velvet) just=
 started a new label named, Relief Records. Close friend, Ron Trent, urged =
Farris take his hard hitting tunes to Relief Records. Trent thought Farris'=
s tracky sound was perfect for the early Relief.


House music history was made when Farris took his demo to Relief Records. H=
anging out in the Relief office was another young Chicago DJ called Sneak, =
who also just made his first demo. Farris and Sneak both had their tracks s=
igned. The "Farris Wheel" EP was Farris=B9s debut release for Relief in 199=
4. Gene Farris, alongside like minded musicians such as DJ Sneak, Paul John=
son, Derrick Carter, DJ Rush, Ron Trent, Boo Williams and Glen Underground =
formed the new wave of notorious, soon to be globe trotting Chicago DJs and=
 producers.


The "Farris Wheel" EP was the beginning of a prolific production career. Ge=
ne Farris=B9s discography highlights works released on dance music=B9s most=
 respected labels such as, Defected/Fluential, Soma Records, Siesta Music, =
Force Inc., Formaldehyde, 83 West/ Camouflage, Communique, Defmix, Static, =
and more.


Being a leader in the industry, Gene Farris started his own label, Farris W=
heel Recordings, Inc. in 1998, with "The Copa Cabana" EP. Among the label=
=B9s many loved EPs is FWR 008 "The Spirit" - Gene Farris featuring Sneak r=
emix. In February of 2001, Gene Farris unveiled Farris Wheel Recordings's s=
pin-off, Farris Wheel Limited. Farris's concept for the new imprint is to s=
teer away from saturated samples and feature more original, organic product=
ions. Farris Wheel Limited artists are incorporating live feeds into their =
melodic soulful beats. Also, 2003 will see the release of the Farris Wheel =
imprint's first CD compilation of the its own catalouge mixed by Gene Farri=
s.


Currently, Farris continues his travels around the globe DJing for his fans=
 throughout the United States, Canada, and many European countries like Cro=
atia, Holland, Israel, and Russia. However, Farris still finds time in his =
busy schedule to devote in the studio. He is is working on a full length al=
bum of original music for release in 2003. Farris's motive for the album is=
 to push beyond the barriers of the current house music sound. Farris alrea=
dy collaborated with many remarkable dance musicians such as renowned house=
 vocalist, Robert Owens and a fresh New York City production favorite, Onio=
nz (just to name a few).
When asked about his future in music Gene Farris passionately replies, "Hou=
se music is my one and only true love. I've been with her for over sixteen =
years and never plan on leaving. She's my peace... me and the music."


As the critics continually applaud his greatening accomplishments, Gene Far=
ris and his Farris Wheel Recordings empire continue to thrive.


The international demand for the elite Chicago House sound has kept Gene Fa=
rris busy gigging around the globe for over the past ten years. Then Februa=
ry 2003 saw the release of Gene's "Textures" mix CD and 6-track vinyl, acco=
mpanied by his "Textures" world tour, and features and reviews in Jockey Sl=
ut, Muzik, Mixmag, Seven Update, Mojo, DJ, IDJ, Blues & Soul, Echo, Muzik.c=
om, Xpander.nl, Burn It Blue, Worlddj.com and many more.


"Textures is a tasty affair, lots of layers, lots of passion, lots of origi=
nality. Deep, sexy, organic house music with that essential Chicago touch. =
A collection to inspire...5/5" DJ Mag
"The first collection from respected Chicago producer Gene Farris' Farris W=
heel Ltd...As good a house mix as you are gonna hear this month...4/5" IDJ =
Mag
"It's deep jazzy, stylish, sexy and soulful, showcasing fast rising talents=
 in the Farris Wheel Family such as Roomsa, Audiowhores, Greenkeepers, Behi=
nd the Groove and Boo Williams. It's damn fine house, nothing too heavy, ju=
st good party tunes from funk to disco and jazz to soul, it's all here as G=

------------------------------------------------------------------------
This Reclaim The Streets event is being used in part to help bring together=
 the SF "activist" community, with the underground artist/performer communi=
ty, and the late night dance/music communities. =A0We all experience first =
hand the increasing intrusiveness of state repression. =A0Art, performance,=
 music, dance, these are the things that celebrate life and should be held =
up and revered in our society. Instead however, it is these very things tha=
t are constantly trying to be squashed. =A0If you want to have an art exhib=
ition, a performance, a concert, or a party, you have to jump through all s=
orts of bureaucratic hoops, pay for all sorts of permits, and then IF they =
approve of things, you are allowed to have your event. What happens if you =
don't have the means to meet all of their ridiculous standards? What if you=
 don't have the money to pay for all of their permits? Your options include=
 not having the event at all, or having it anyway illegally. And so we have=
 these unpermitted events. Often. And almost as often we have them shut dow=
n by the police. Or they just come in and harass people. For what? For enjo=
ying life? For celebrating that which makes us human? But we're experiencin=
g it more and more. And now they have the RAVE act at their disposal too. A=
nd it is going to continue to get worse until we rise up and say "Enough!"
=A0
So that is part of what we're doing with this RTS. Showing that if you
won't let us have our events in our own spaces where we aren't bothering an=
yone, than we are going to take it to the streets and have our events there=
!
=A0
For more info about RTS itself, you should go straight to the source. These=
 two links are from the London RTS group which began RTS originally way bac=
k in the day. They're a bit long, but very worth reading.

As many of you may know already, Mirage first appeared as a Wednesday club =
night here in San Jose. Unfortunately, as with many nightclubs in the scene=
, the venue was sold and new owners came in to change the club into a blues=
-rock bar. Mirage with its family and friends enjoyed a fun 2003 run and th=
e night vanished just before winter. Recently, we were told that Mirage wil=
l once again take shape in February. All who were involved with Mirage will=
 return to help recreate the magic and build a safe-haven for its reappeara=
nce. As the prophets give us more information, we will forward the details =
to you. Returning to the source of power are Mirage resident DJs: Michael L=
iu (Illumination Records), Denise (Sound Asylum), Dragn'fly (Shaolin), Maje=
re (Elektrosorcery), and Proteus (Vibe Rite). Crisp clean concert sound pow=
ered by Logik Pro. Much more information to follow on this all ages event..=

Anyone else get their email addy harvested by these punks?

What this says to me is that too many whites are getting away with drug
use, too many whites are getting away with drug sales, too many whites
are getting away with trafficking in this stuff. The answer to this
disparity is not to start letting people out of jail because we're not
putting others in jail who are breaking the law. The answer is to go out
and find the ones who are getting away with it, convict them and send
them up the river, too."

- Rush Limbaugh. October 5, 1995 show transcript.

"Opinions are my own only, and do not necessarily represent those of
KZSU Radio or Stanford University." (or words to that effect.)

Hey to all you party people, this is not about raving, just random =
thoughts on our carnal world.

We have an 80's party tonight. Does anybody remember the song, "Images =
of Heaven" by Peter Godwin, circa 7/80 to 1982. He said that the song =
was about "untouchable Madonnas for medieval knights" or "hello boys =
supermodels for Jack the Lad."

Here's a sample of the lyrics that he wrote:

Somebody filled me with photos of you and there's nothing I can do.
The media made you, there's nothing I can do, cause you don't exist.
Just images of heaven that take me to hell
Images of heaven, or something for sale
oh, images of heaven, images of heaven

A powerful song, indeed. And in the Internet media age, we now have =
sites for quick meetups.

Recently, I signed up for one (for men), posted a profile and a pic, and =
got a few responses. So I tried to create an image of something else, as =
an experiment. I posted my favorite picture of a hot personality from =
long ago.=20

And immediately I was flooded with many responses, which is food for =
thought about what we are seeking in this culture.

Even if it's a trick of the light, we still love to believe in the image =
(in this case, a muscular model with white, smiling teeth). That's why =
we are inundated with sexy subliminal advertisements. Just wait until =
Superbowl Sunday. Or any day, for that matter.=20

I think I will just keep on dancing and try not to think too much about =
this concept! It's a bit disturbing but true. Oh well, enjoy the 80s =
shindig!

Hope they play my song!!!

Greg VP

give DJ Gram some respect."

Team set? hm... yea... Trance :-)

hehe

so for the longest time now I've been dealing with a 99 civic that blew =
it's engine and a 91 chevy puckup that had a tranny that died 2x. . . .

Funny thing, my truck sat around for like 2 yrs, and when I replaced the =
trans there were all these other lil issues I had to deal with. I had it =
rewired to tow a car trailer (which I aquired), then the lights all =
stopped working. I finally replaced all the parts to get the lights =
working and even installed my stereo again. Then it died. I used to romp =
around the lil foo foo hood here and people knew me as the guy you could =
hear coming from a few blocks away. 12-14 spkrs, 4 10's, 1 6x9's, 2 6", =
2 1", and these lil plate speakers powered by the sickest phoeniz gold =
amps I've ever seen. about 2000W total. . .now it's only about 12-1400. =
. .=20

my civic tho, damn I can't wait to drive it.=20
It's a d16y8 sohc vtec 1.6L motor. It "was" stock and is sort of stock =
at the moment.
Since I started shopping ebay for parts to fix it (which btw is the way =
to go to save money). I've rebuilt practically the entire car. Heres a =
lil list of what I've done (i dig talking car stuff to people).

btw, san leandro honda has a cool website with all the part breakdown =
schematics that you can order from and print out for help if you can't =
figure out where what hose or whatever goes where.
btw#2- If you're looking for car parts, one of the funnest places to go =
to is the row of junkyard car lots on Depot Rd. In Hayward. A lil while =
ago they seperated the lots and theres 2 import lots with mostly =
honda/acura, one with mostly vw/volvo, etc. . . and a couple others. =
It's fun to go scavenger hunting for car parts and then haggling with =
the guy to lower the prices. More than likely I'll prolly just buy =
another d16 or b16 motor (they run from like $300-500). And on EBay, =
things like MAP sensors and Knock sensors sell like crazy. . .so if one =
happens to fall in your shoe or something, you shouldn't toss it in the =
garbage.

Motor mods-
  a.. Motor was completely rebuilt. JDM (japanese design manufacturing) =
pistons n rods (which are domed, not flat, and raise compression a =
couple points). all new rings, etc had to be changed.
  b.. Brand new crankshaft (after I had the other one reconditioned like =
3x). I've gone thru 4 sets of motor bearings (which aren't really =
bearings) that didn't fit and every time I torqued things down the motor =
wouldn't turn over whatsoever. . .till the last time when I took the =
numbers off the rods n crank and got bearings sized for those =
specifically.
  c.. I have 3 or 4 stock cams, which I need for smog. One broke apart =
at the gear end, one broke apart at the distributor end when I put the =
dist. on 180degrees off.
  d.. A stage 2 crower cam and skunk2 n obx adj cam gear (i'll prolly =
use the obx). (you should hear the car idle with this in, it sounds like =
a pumped camaro). You need the adj gear cuz the aftermarket crower cam =
required a 4 degree valve timing advance.
  e.. Racing valve springs and billet retainers (which I need for the =
high rev cam)
  f.. Lightened crank pulley.
  g.. Aem power pulley set.
  h.. ACT Prolite Flywheel (8.2lbs vs the stock 2x as heavy flywheel)
  i.. ACT Heavy duty pressure plate and and stage 2 street/strip fiber =
pad)
  j.. Stronger Fuel Delivery with an STR fuel rail
  k.. AEM adj fuel regulator with liquid guage
  l.. Accel High Flow fuel injectors (and 2 sets of the stock ones)
  m.. I just bought a stage 2 port/polished head thats port matched, =
intake/exh. This will be the 3rd head I've picked up, one from the =
junkyard, one from ebay, and the stocker was ported by myself, but the =
aluminum was kinda tore up from tightening/loosening bolts so much.The =
ported one comes with cam, springs etc. . so I'm curious to see what =
kind since the guy didn't mention much about the cam, and I was mainly =
just interested in the ported head.=20
  n.. I cleaned the ports in my intake manifold a lil, had to replace my =
MAP sensor/Knock Sensor/Throttle pos sensor/vtec pressure switch. I =
cleaned up/smoothed out the throttle body assembly and matched it with =
the intake mannie port.
  o.. A gorgeous set of headers by SSAutochrome (an ebay company)
  p.. OBX racing cat
  q.. APEXi N1 Design muffler
  r.. All the exhaust will be connected with 2.5-3" pipe by RPM mufflers =
in hayward
  s.. Engine supported by stronger polyeurethane bushing/mounts
  t.. I "had" a dope lil oil pan from moroso, but even tho everyone told =
me it would fit my car they don't actually make a pan for the D16 motor =
(if someone knows someone who custom makes these let me know)
  u.. JDM JUN Racing obd1 ecu with a skunk2 eprom (which I think might =
be for a B16 motor but it works great still)
  v.. Some new wiring here n there, some custom things like valve cover.
  w.. Single piece obx style chrome cold air intake (I actually made one =
of these to suck in air from the Right bumper vent (which I cut out days =
ago).The one I bought sucks from the same place, but is a smoother one =
piece design.
  x.. Theres one piece I can't find anywhere on any other car like mine =
that's called something like an Air Helper Valve. . .I don't know why I =
have it but I haven't found a d16 motor with the same thing yet. =
Supposedly it senses coolant temp and lets air flow from the crankcase =
into the intake at higher temperatures. I think I can just plug it up. =
??
  y.. I'm waiting for a stock oil pan to come in the mail. They're cast, =
and a piece broke off my old one.=20
  z.. I had to replace the stock oil pump (which is a pretty simple =
contraption). I wish I did this with the first rebuild, because =
aparrently it was the major cause of the first engine issue and i didn't =
realize I needed a new one till I took the engine apart like 4 more =
times (which I've gotten pretty good at). My engine initially seized cuz =
oil wasn't making it all the way to cyl#4 (the farthest one), or up to =
the camshaft area.  So pretty much everything seized after a lil while =
of driving with an engine knock I couldn't find till I seized the motor. =
I could just imagine how much a dealer would charge to fix it.
  aa.. Putting everything to the ground is the shifting upgrades I made =
(simple but they make hell of a difference). =20
  ab.. Polyeurethane shifter bushings.
  ac.. Skunk2 Weighted short shifter and shift knob
Chassis/Body/Suspenion-
  a.. Tokico struts on all 4 corners
  b.. Racing Dual Spring Coilovers (which are SOOOO much better than the =
single spring setup, which I also have a set of). The dual springs make =
sure you don't have the slop from the spring to spring cap gap. More =
controlled.
  c.. In the rear I installed a nifty lil camber kit which I bought off =
some dude on ebay for like $8. A great idea actually. . .he put together =
a set of shims (heavy duty washers) and longer bolts, that changed the =
angle of the rear control arms. It works awesome. . .that guy had a good =
idea from selling a couple bolts and some washers on ebay.Adjustable =
