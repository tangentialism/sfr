stuff in there.

Acid Over, by Simon Reynolds, with Paul Oldfield

	House music is so impersonal, minimal and repetitive it seems to
take effict beneath the level of conscious hearing, sweepoing you up by a
process of `molecular agitation'.  Acid house is the purest, barest
distillation of house, the outer limit of its logic of inhuman
functionalism.  With acid, black music has never been so alien-ated from
traditional notions of `blackness' (fluid, grooving, warm), never been so
close to to the frigid, mechanical, supremely `white' perversion of funk
perpetrated by early eighties pioneers like D.A.F. and Cabaret Voltaire.
	Acid house is not so much a new thing, as a drastic, terminal
culmination of two tendensics in house: the trance-inducing effects of
repetion and dub production; a fascination for the pristine hygiene and
metronome rhythms of German electronic dance.  Pure acid tracks like
Tyree's `Acid Over' recal the brute, inelastic minimalism of D.A.F. - it
consists of nothing but a bass synth sequencer pulse reiterated with
slight warps and eerie inflections.  Other tracs parallesl the obscure
innovations of bands like Suicide, the Normal (`Warm Leatherette'),
Liasons Dangereuses (very big in Chicago), Die Krupps (proto-metalbashers
and an early incarnation of Propaganda).  Ex-Sample's `And So it Goes'
combines cut-ups (`Heroin Kills'), unidentifiable bursts of distorted,
sampled sound, and human cries torn from their context (agonies of ecstasy
or distress), in a manner not unlike Front 242.  Reese's `Just Want
Another Chance' sets a guttural, Cabaret Voltaire monologue of desire over
the spookiest of Residents synth-drones, an ectoplasmic bassline fourtimes
too slow for the drum track.  `Strings Of Life' by Rhythim-Is-Rhythim
(a.k.a. Derek May, a prime mover on the acid scene) takes the sultry swing
of Latin disco and clips into a spasmodic tic that's deeply unsettling;
his `Move It' is a perimeter of trebly rhythm programes that restlessly
orbit the black hole where the song should be, and strangely recalls one
of those lost, desolate Joy Division B-sides.
	Weirdest of all is `Acid Trax' by Phuture, the record that started
the whole fad off.  The `Cocaine Mix' starts with a treated voice midway
between a dalek and the Voice of Judgement that announces, `This is
Cocaine Speaking'; spectral eddies of a disembodied human wail
(reminiscent of nothing so much as PIL's `No Birds Do Sing') simulate the
soul languishing in cold turkey; then we're launched on a terror-ride that
again reminds me of PIL's `Careering' or `Death Disco'.  `I can make you
like for me/I can make you die for me/In the end/I'll be your only
friend.'  If disco was always ment to be about escapism, acid is about
no-escapism.
	In this, acid house takes after the white avant-funk of the late
seventies/early eighties, its concept of disco as trance, a form of
sinister control or possession.  The flash and dazzle of disco classics
like Chaka Khan's `I'm Every Woman', Micheal Jackson's `Off the Wall'
album, or anything by Earth Wind and Fire, is replaced by a clinical,
ultra-focused, above all inhibited sound.  Expansive and expressive
gestures are replaced by a precise and rigorous set of movements,
_demands_ on the body; flamboyance and improvisation by a discipline of
pleasure.  Perhaps there's a kind of `liberation' in submitting to the
mechanics of instinct, soldering the circuitry of desire to the circuitry
of the sequencer programmes.
	As for the connotations of `acid', all involved in the Chicago
scene deny that hallucinogenics have anything to do with the sound.  The
name comes from the slang term `acid burn', which means to rip somebody
off, steal their ideas (i.e. sample their sound).  However many club-goers
take Ecstasy, a drug related to LSD which provides its euphoric sense of
communion (and aphrodisiac effects) without causing hallucinations.  
	House has been bordering on the psychedelic for some time anyway,
with the spaciness of its dub effects, its despotic treatment of the voice
and its interference with the normal ranking of instruments in the mix
(encouraging `perceptual drift').  On one mix of Nitro Deluxe's `On a
Mission', a single phrase of female voice is vivisected, varispeeded and
multitraced into a sychedelic babble of sub-phonemes and vowel-particles,
becomeing an airborne choir of lunatic estasied, a locust swwarm of
placeless peaks and plaints spirited free of their location in a syntax of
desire.
	On the Kenny Jones mix of Ralphi Rosario's `You Used to Hold Me',
stray sibilants from Xavier Golds's vocal flake off to bob inhumanly in
their own parallel slipstream, until her vocal is absorbed into the
backing track, with one spasm of passion turned into a jack-knifing rhythm
effect.  On the `Devil Mix' of Master C & J's `In the City', Liz Torre's
voice is distored and distended in a manner uncannily akin to the The
Butthole Surfers!
	With pure acid house, however, it's not really a question of
acid-rock's 24-track techinicolour overload, of a dazzling, prismatic
opening of the doors of perception , but more like a contraction or
evacuation  of consciousness.  Not a matter of being saturated by TOO MUCH
but of being compelled to focus on TOO LITTLE, reduced to a one-track
mind.  If people do drop a tab or two to `acid house' they must have
strage digital visions, enter Mondran phantasmagorias, Spirograph inner
orbits.
	What the berserk strobe-flicker of acid house is most reminiscent
of is an episode from `Star Trek': miscreants are punished by bing
subjected to a strobe-like flaing lightbox which clears the brain, leaving
them suggestible and capable of being literally re-formed.  But one
deviant is left in the machine, brainwashed but unprogrammed, lost in a
terrifyingly blank catatonic limbo.
	Like D.A.F.'s new savagery, like psychedelia's orgiastic
utopianism, house incites a superhuman/inhuman insatiability.  With the
jettisoning of the song/storyline, sex loses narrative and context,
becomes asocial and fantastical.  There's no sense of trajectory
(courtship/seduction/foreplay/union), no sexual healing, no communication,
no sense of `scene' in Baudrillardian sense (dramatic relations between
human agents).  Instead there's an ob-scene explicitness, a a graphic
depiction of a fantastical algebra of pornotopian configurations.  Sex
turns in to a series of quadradic  equations, flesh becomes spectral. 
Nothing is ever resolved:  house is the beat that can never satisfy or be
satisfied.  The stutter-beats, the costive basslines, sound neurotic: the
music's a repetition complex, a symptom of some unstaunchable vacancy of
being.  Every bar of the music becomes an orgasm, making the idea of
climax meaningless.
	And where acid rock imagined utopia as a garden of pre-modern
innocence, acid house is futuristic, in love with sophistication and
gtechnology.  Acid house imagines a James Bond/Barbarella leasure paradise
of gadgetry and designer drugs.  House is a kind of pleasure factory (an
orgasmotron, in fact) and as Marx wrote, the factory turns human beings
into mere appendages of flesh attached to machinery.
	If house, acid, new beat, etc, are radical, it's a radicalism
that's inseparable from their simple effectiveness, pure pleasure
immediacy.  Here's a pop culture based around the death of the song,
minimalism, repetition, departure from the stability of the key and
harmonic structure in favour of sonority and sound-in-itself.  No need for
interpretation, context or rhetoric, all the things that people turn to
the music papers for.  No delay, no mediation, but a direct interface
between the music's pleasure circuitry and the listener's nervous system.
	Nobody even cares who made the music, which is why the personal
appearances of the `stars' are so farcical (most clobgoers continue to
dance with their backs turned to the stage, while the band mimes to the
record).  Does this make the scene dehumanized and impersonal?  You could
argue, as some do, that it's a realizaionton of one interpretation of
punk: not `anyone can be a star' so much as `no more stars', a
deconstruction of stardom (most new beat or house `stars' are merely
fronts for the producer).  There's a similar kind of deconstruction to
that wreaked by seventies glam:  the gestures and iconography of showbiz
are exaggerated amplified and disconnected untile nothing is signified but
a style that can only be sustained here...There's just intensity whout
pretext or context (just the music).
	And this is a blank generation if ever you saw one, sucked into
house's void and left adrift, prttily vacant.  But if the scene is
`democratic', it's with a capitalist inflection;  the music is pure
product, consumer-tested on the dancefloor, with an inbuilt obsolescence
factor.  Some tracks are monumental constructions, Brutalist ziggurats you
could gaze at in wonder for a lifetime.  But in a club, it's compatibilyty
rather than difference that rules, with a seamlessness that has you happy
as a nodding dog.

For what its worth, Brian gets my all around endorsment as all-around
nice, reliable guy.  His cats are indeed sweet and he keeps a clean
space.  I'd be glad to have him as a roommate if I still had a room
to rent.

Wow, you really put the need for all ages events into perspective for me.
I knew in my heart they were important, but now I understand in my head.
There realy is a dearth of cross generation social events.  There will
always be a generation gap but the valley doesn't have to be an empassible
goarge like it is now.

Thanks,

Favorite CD's So Far:

1. Ethnotechno - Sonic Anthropology Vol. 1; Wax Trax.  A variety of
   techno styles featuring "ethnic" or "world" style vocal samples,
   instruments, rhythms and melodies.

2. New Young American Primitive : ZoeMagik Records (415)641-8023.
   Trancy/tribal consistantly good all the way through.  Probably
   the single best techno group I've heard to date.

3. One A.D. - Waveform Corp.  A collection of ambient techno with
   a more than passing beat.

Where I buy them:

Tower Records, but only if its on a listening station.

City Discs in Greenbrea, Marin County.  They don't have a lot of techno, but
they always have something new, and best of all, They let you listen before
you buy and have a satisfaction guaranteed return policy to boot.  You can
also order something and choose not to buy it if you don't like it.  The
store has a great vibe too.

Does anyone know if there are stores like City Discs in the city?

Keep in mind that these village dances & celebrations are an integral
part of those cultures, i.e. they represent the spiritual and community-
building aspects that are a normal part of their everyday lives. 
 
Although raves may represent an ideal of community and life celebration, 
I have to question whether they are useful for preparing children for 
dealing with our current culture.  Without the guidance of a wise guide, 
it might prove to be very difficult for a child to integrate the rave 
experience with other aspects of our reality.  Which isn't to say that 
kids shouldn't go to raves on their own.  What I'm saying is that if 
people go to raves to escape the reality-at-large, then this is a very 
different activity from the ecstatic celebrations that have gone on in 
other cultures.

Of course, just being part of a subculture can be a wonderful thing.
But is this subculture going to take care of you when you can't pay the
rent?  Is it going to provide suitible paths leading to spiritual,
emotional and intellectual fulfillment?  Is it going to help make the
world a better place?  Perhaps it doesn't matter.  To many (most?),
raving is just a way to have fun when you're not at work or in school.

In a way, the TV program directors, and other media authorities have
become society's village elders - preparing (brainwashing?) youths
to become a conforming member of our society.  Hopefully, the rave
scene can provide direction for how ravers (of all ages) can integrate
the rave experience into a fulfilling and enriching lifestyle.  And 
hopefully, such rave-influenced lifestyles can integrate and effect 
some positive changes to our world culture.   I hope that those to whom 
raving is nothing more than a way to have fun can find things in the world 
that are enriching in other ways - unless of course they feel that there 
really is nothing more to life other than having fun.

Raves are a subculture.  A teeny tiny part of our whole culture.
This distinction seems lost on a lot of folks.  I don't think we have
to be talking about just kids here.

I think the positive spin on this would be similar to how some people
view their drugs - it gives them a "happiness reference point" - a glimpse
of how they can feel.  But the drugs wear off.  And no rave lasts forever.
I believe that maybe One such a reference point experience is valid and
after that it turns into escapism.  A slippery hill.  Picture me rolling
my eyes as someone trys to validate their drug usage with this little
story - one we've all heard a Thousand Times ...

Well, I sorta think this applies to just about everything in terms of
raising a child.

> Which isn't to say that 
> kids shouldn't go to raves on their own.  

You bet - kids all have to have their "out on their own" experiences and
I think raves are great for that.

No No Maybe 
and that last one reminds me of Cher for some reason

here's why I like the all age raves only occasionally - cuz I feel
some responsibility not to Blow Their Innocence Out of the Water just
cuz I've heard it before.  Presumably, raising a kid is all about
re-experiencing the world with them.  I don't have kids.  I'm 
Too Busy selfishly Experiencing the world myself to spend 
time re-treading the same old thing.  That's me.  Now.

My time is infinitely valuable.  Despite the "joy" it might
bring me to see life through their eyes - I have no interest in puppy
pile counseling sessions.  Too high people who want to chat.  Deep
philosiphizing.  I want to party with a bunch of folks who are
Down - so we can shake it, Together. (ComeUnity)

Wow, here's a big dose of reality from Lee.  In a way raves are an escape 
from reality for me, but it also helps me connect to reality at large. 
Raving helps me understand more about the joy of connecting.  Coming home 
from atomic pig I couldn't help thinking about all the connections that 
went on.  
Because of the safe loving enviroments of raves, I'm learning 
that giving love brings love.  Love or that place we get a taste of where 
we are all connected can help us alot dealing with all aspects of 
reality.  At least speaking for myself, it does for me.  Raving helps me 
cellabrate existence, and it helps me acknowledge and see the beauty of 
our togetherness and see the beauty in our separateness.  There is more 
of a sence of separateness for me in the realities outside of raves.  
Loving that separateness (which raving is helping me do) helps me get 
things done like the rent being paid.  I think it is important to 
celebrate our individual existence and taking care of it is one way that 
I do that.  
For to deny my indivual importance is to deny a part of the whole.  Every 
part is important to the whole.

Lee makes some great points here, only deleted some to help keep it from 
being too redundant and assuming you already read it.
I'd be interested in hearing from others how raving has enhanced and help 
improve your life outside of raving.  I'll understand if no one responds 
to this request because as I think about it, I realize that it is very 
difficult for me to put into words.  For me  the benifits of raving goes 
way beyond what words can express.  That is probably one on the reasons I 
rave, to express those benifits and joys without the limitations words.

If you like Leftfield, you should also check out a group called Morganistic. 
Their CD is an import and the cheapest place (and only place) I've seen it,
it cost $26 for one CD.  It's got a greyish CD cover and you'll look at it
and go AMBIENT definitely AMBIENT, but NO WAY it is aggressive trance.  Very
european if you like that.

BTW, the place I saw it was Alien Records in Austin, TX.  If anyone wantes
their number let me know.

	$35??? I got it for about $24 a couple months ago.  I bought it 
from Solid Groove in San Jose(GREAT place).  They have a lot of interesting 
stuff. Another good CD if you're into ambient-type stuff is FSOL's 
Lifeform.  I think it's a bit old, but the music is beauiful =) I didn't 
like the Young American Primitive CD either, but maybe i'm just 
different...   ;)

Dear Erin;

	Breath deep, like the song from Cabert Voltaire 2x45, letting your
belly fill up first with your chest filling up last, and then just let in
go, like dropping a ball off a bridge that your standing on; suspended
over a huge green gorge, and just watch it go. This recomendation on
breathing comes from a massage therapist.

that's basically cuzz unless you're a promoter, there's nothing that you 
can really do about it.  even for a promoter it's still hard cuzz it's 
sooo difficult to find a space that will allow you to throw an all age 
party.  things just suck!!  I remember this summer how i was soooo 
excited to finally turn 18.  now I had freedom!! YEAH FUCKING RIGHT!!!  I 
still can't go to come-unity, wicked, spundaes or other hella cool 
parties that are out there.  age limits suck but there doesn't seem to be 
anyway around them.  me and Elf T bitch about thiss stuff all the time.  
It's one of the reasons why sunset was always soooo good.  everyone could 
come.
btw, I checked out your web page, it's got some cool shit on there.  
maybe ya should add some more pointers like to techno stuffs etc.  
where'dya get all that stuff on finals, and pick up lines etc????

Subject: wow

So, I had the most intense experience of my life this weekend, I think.  
Of course, no way to even convey it, but you know that.  I went to the 
most HARDCORE HARDCORE party you can imagine.  I can't even believe that 
that kind of a thing is called a rave and so are the little pparties in 
SF.  They are so different.  We had to literally push and shove our way 
in to this huge castle/military-related building (HUGE), inside which 
were thousands of fucked up kids and security guards pushing you on 
through and not letting you wait for you friends who got held up in the 
"line" (more like a pulsing mob).  I walked in and could not believe my 
eyes, ears, and every other sensory detector I have.  Only slightly 
baked, I couldn't even tell if I was tripping or what.  I was already 
hearing sounds and seeing things I never thought possible.  At first I 
thought there was no way I would trip, but then decided it was so intense 
that I better see just how intense it could be.  The A was incredible 
(just 1 and we were all "GONE" :)  Lasers, lights, music.  I want to take 
you to one of these hardcore New York parties.  I went with somepeople I 
didn't know very well, and I was definitely wishing at some points that 
there were someone there I knew and loved.  But I'm also really glad I 
did it on my own.  I met a few cool people, but couldn't really socialize 
much.  See, this was the first time I REALLY tripped, you know--HARD.  
The first time I really felt restricted by my human form and stuff.  And 
felt like I was liquid.  As I sat on the filthy floor and watched the 
party, I didn't know whether to be delighted that this sort of thing goes 
on and "society" can't stop it and has no idea what it is, or to be 
digusted and sad at seeing all these dirty people, most of them really 
young, and skinny from taking too many drugs and going out every night.  
Some of Howard's friends came in for the weekend and it was their first 
rave.  They were in for a lot more than they expected.  I also "wigged" 
for the first time, but it didn't last long.  I felt bad, though, because 
I wasn't with people who knew me well.  I'm going to go.  But if you come 
visit me here sometime, I want to go to one of these with you (if you 
want).  It's just so intense, I can't even believe it.  I felt like such 
a San Francisco wimp.  Don't worry, I like the lovey-community SF parties 
better than these NY ones that just make you not be able to believe what's 
going on and feel like you're about to explode (and the bathrooms were 
grosser than you can imagine).  But it's an experience I will never forget.

Keep in mind that these village dances & celebrations are an integral
part of those cultures, i.e. they represent the spiritual and community-
building aspects that are a normal part of their everyday lives.

Lee
---------------------------------------
I'm no anthropoligist, but I would guess many such traditional dances and 
celebrations emerge in a way similar to how raves have sprung from our 
mass/world culture. Imagine a few young members of a tribe sneaking out 
of the village after dark, "borrowing" the drums of their elders and 
dancing fervidly, with clumsy experimentation invoking the spirits 
they've always been instructed to fear, coming back in the morning 
bleary-eyed with big smiles, planning their next meeting. As they grow to 
fill the positions of their elders, could they forget the most estatic 
moments of their youth? Wouldn't some of it find its way into the 
village's rituals?

Maybe this is bourgeois white-boy glamorization, but maybe you see my 
point.

Hello to all the sfravers,
Some of you may have read my posts, but none of you excluding Mr. vekatz
actually know me.  Anyways, my 18th birthday is this summer and I'm planning
on throwing a party for everyone.  If anyone has any suggestions, such as DJs
or even a space, it would be greatly appreciated.  Of course I am rather
broke like most of the world, but that goes without saying.  Thanks ahead of
time :)

Love Always,                        Energy

	Hey L.A.!!!! I've got one, no two words to say. Thank you. Doc 
Martins b-day jam at the Glam Slam was incredible.  I'm sorry but my notions
 of your town were smeared by the kind of mentality that would have oj from 
morning to night. personally i like mine (oj) in the wee hours of the 
morn to the later hours of dawn. But hey i cant blame your town for the 
nation wide phenomenon of mesmerized lifeless souls watching the 
alternate reality box everday.  I only have good things to say here.  

	The setting was perfect.(overhead shot) first interstate bldg and 
bonaventure hotel to the nw.cut. pan left. enter doors. 
(imagine) Wicked vibe in L.A.  Wicked vibe in L.A. (surprise. so 2* said 
makes it real) Open with steve loria, build it up with dubtribe, 
overwhelm us with jeno, and then drive us hard into the morning with the 
thunderous spinning of doc martin. What more can i say, thank for setting 
me straight, the vibe is everywhere it just has to be found. Thanks to 
everyone who made it worth the trip down south. peace and craziness see 
you at community.
                               E.

Dear All;

	Yes; I like what people have to say about dance. What I'm curious 
about is where we men decided that it was to macho to do these 
traditional dances. Like I used to wear those bells around my leg; you 
know those bells that India womyn wear and some dead heads. These were 
worn at times of celabration, and the men traditionally performed the 
dances. What ever happened to that; and why do we(men) traditionally always 
expect the womyn to do them. What part of society or what society or time 
period was this deemed to macho to do. It really didn't become ok to 
dance by yourself until the late 70's early 80's thanks to that Gen X 
song; dancin by myself; nothin to lose, nothin to prove just dancin by 
myself. also it really hasn't been ok for men to dance with other men 
until now. Inquiring minds want to know.

Dear All;

	Is it illegal in San Fran to have people over 18 but under 21 in 
the same place if alcohol is server even if their not drinking. I 
remember some punk clubs used to separtate the bar from the stageor the 
dance floor. If you wanted to drink you needed to show  ID at the bar and 
you were given either one of those arm bands or a special stamp. This way 
more people could get in to see the band or dance. I don't see any of 
that here in SF it there some law on the books that saids you can't do 
the above mentioned.

Dear all:

        I have been forced to live on the  east coast for about half a year
now, and have noticed a big difference in net activity between two email
groups, ne-raves and sfraves.  Now don't get me wrong, I LOVE San
Francisco.  Actually, in my opinion New York and its raves are nothing
compared to a good SF rave with some close friends.  But people here are
more informative about events.  They post weekly letters on the list
summarizing what people are going to which rave, who can give rides, and
who can drive.  There is just a lot more pre-communication of rave
information.

        The coolest thing that they have is a Rave-O-Matic on the World
Wide Web, maintained by DJ Mars(Marshall Villarosa).  This is amazing.  It
has raves lined up for the next three months going on all over the north
east coast.  It is beautiful.  I really commend him for maintaining the
page.  If you want to check it out, just to see what i mean, the address
is:

                http://www.lehigh.edu/~a176/techno.html

Just click on the rave-o-matic button and *flash*, you're connected to
hundreds of events!  It's just mind-blowing!

        I guess the point of my whole letter is that maybe we should try
and have a more informational newsgroup, and focus on meeting each other
and increasing the love of the entire rave scene.  A Rave-O-Matic for the
SF area would be great too, if someone had the time to maintain it.  I am
unable to, so i thought I'd just throw the idea out to the masses.  But  I
would be willing to help anyone who had the desire to start one up.

        I am coming back home this weekend, and am planning to go as many
raves as possible during my 2 week break.  I have a car, and would love to
give people rides if they are going where I am.  As now, I don't know
what's going on, due to my extreme geographical distance and separation
from the underground information flow in SF.  I know for sure that I am
going to Harmony on MArch 10.  the location is supposed to be beautiful,
and the people throwing it are awesome too.  DJ's are yet another reason to
go to that one!  I might go to Basics too this weekend(i think that's when
it is).  So if anyone is interested, please email me.  And if anybody else
thinks that offering rides before raves is cool, then do it =)  I have
noticed that on both newsgroups(east and west coast), people are upset with
the lack of intimacy and amiability at raves.  Well, this is a small step
back in the right direction.  I want to make a difference =)

Luv you all,

Rob McCord

Dear Rob;

	Your words are neither lame or incoherent; maybe misspelled but 
i'm an x -engineer and can't spell anyway; and neither can most ravers; 
and most ravers don't care about spelling. 

	Your words however show a great amount of caring and love for 
the scence and are quite inspiring; i thing you posts are just fine. 
Don't worry about what other people think; unless you want to kiss ass; 
TO THY OWN SELF BE TRUE, and the rest will take care of itself.

	People respect, trust and like me because I speak from the heart
and say what I really feel;  & think, the world needs more honesty and
less BS; there enough of the latter out there. For all the trashing I got 
last week; I got twice the letters of support; in either the public or 
private. We all have insecurites about posting; these posts go out to 
100's of people, the eyes of those people are upon our writing. But those 
are human eyes; flawwed by bad experience and environment; I will never 
trash you for a mistake; for to err is human; and I make a lot of 
mistakes every day. I/we feel we were not placed here to judge our fellow 
person; but I feel to support and help each other fight the enemy within. 
Listin to the song by the same name off the Rush CD Grace Under Pressure; 
there is much wisdom to be found in the words of Neil Peart. In fact I 
give them to you since I have the Cd right here and they were cool enough 
to give the lyrics.

	The Enemy Within;

	Things crawl in the darkness
	That imagination spins
	Needles at your nerve ends
	Crawl like spiders on your skin

	Pounding in your temples
	And a surge of adrenalin
	Every Muscle tense-
	To fence
	The enemy within...

	I'm not giving in
	To security under pressure
	I'm not missing out
	On the promise of adventure
	I'm not giving up
	On implausible dreams-
	Experience to extremes-
	Experience to extremes

	Suspicious looking stranger
	Flashes you a dangerous grin
	Shadows across your window-
	Was it only a tree in the wind?

	Every breath a static charge-
	A tongue that tastes like tin
	Steely-eyes outside-
	To hide
	The enemy within....

	To you - is it movement or is it action?
	Is it contact or just reaction?
	And you - revolution or just resistance?
	Is it living, or just existence?
	Yeah, you - it takes a little more persistence
	To get up and go the distance...

Anytime I get scared and am decideing whether or not I should share 
something with someone or do something thats a little scarey, I remember 
the words to this song. I hope that was helpful:)

Well I have been going though the sfraves directory, and its really sad to see
that we don't have recent pictures of sfravers on line. (BTW, thanks for the
Crunch JPEG, but you may want to consider ftping it to hyperreal.com/incoming/sfraves or incoming/images). I know that this isn't the type of group that
jumps in front of a camera and takes a million pictures (well, susie might :)),
but I'd really like to see the sfraves web pages like the other regional mailing
list pages. I'm sure it would even help if some people have their pictures on
line so others can recognize them at parties and such (since we no longer
have buttons or badges). I think the only one who wears their badge still is 
Larry Ching. Which I think it's great.

Anyway take pictures (even random ones at raves:)), scan them in, and upload them. I'm sure that a couple of years from now, it would be great to look at the E-Bee and remember all the wacky memories of Milton waving (and he will prob. still be waving) the E-Bee around. :)

Well,   This evening,  I go to my last rave in the Bay Area,   so
I'll see y'all at Come/Unity this evening.    So,  this is your last
chance to see me.    Tommorrow evening,  I'm leaving for Australia
for 1 to 3 months.   

I'll probably send a prepared farewell message sometime tommorrow...

acshully, there was a point in time when they did give out armbands.  at 
2 am, if ya didn't have an arm band they threw you out onto the streets 
(cuz I'm sure that it's *much* safer for us kids to be wandering the 
streets than dancing inside!!)

Dear Sfraves;

	Rob's and other people private posts to me prompted me to write
this. Theres supposed to be at least 300+ people on this list and we only
hear regularly from but a small group; I'ld say less than 30%; I sit here;
at the doorway to a universe and wonder what beautiful/ugly,
inspiring/depressing, humorous/sad, intelligent/dumb words we never get to
hear from all the other people out there on this list. It makes me sad and
angry; and I do have tears in my eyes; that there are people out there
that have something meaningful to say; a feeling, a thought and are scared
that someone will trash them because they don't like, or understand what
there about or tring to say. These unheard thoughts and feeling could
change us all, start a revolution, make us all look at something in a new
and very special and wonderful way; or bore us, depress us or make us
angry. 

	I'm a raver because most of all; above all things I embrase new
experience, there are many worlds, dimensions, and universes to explore
out there, that we can touch, see, feel and be a part of. I'm not so
fragile that what you will say will crush and destory me. Today I give no
one that power. 

	But instead because of The Enemy Within(specifically fear), thoose
insecure critics of the world, the biggest and worst critic ourselves, WE
CHOSE not to do things that could propell us and the people we touch
further and farther than we've ever gone before. To push the extremes of
reality, to go where internally or externally where no human has gone
before. I know those words sound tacky; but I believe in them and carry
them with me always. 

	Maybe I was a raver before;  I was anything else; I just beleieve
in pushing the envolpe; never content to stay where I'm at for very long;
there's always something new and different to experience. I wanted to be a
jet piolet; something about going three times the speed of sound just
excites the hell out of me; to pull 5 or 10g's, god I eveny those guys;
but I'm sure even that wouldn't be enough for me, and they wouldn't let 
me because of my poor eyesight. 

	I guess the point I'm tring to make is; that I really would like
to hear from all the other people out there on the scene, whatever you
have to say is ok by me; as long as your not trashing me or anyone else. 
So if no one told you today or ever that your feelings and thoughts are
important; let me be the first. To the people on the list who never post 
I say this,
 
"your feelings and thoughts are important to me and I will always give 
them the attention they deserve, because you are a fanatsic human being 
and what you have to say is important to me; I can say this without ever 
having met you or talked with you before because mine are and your no 
different than me."

	I say this because there so many people out there saying the
opposite, that we don't count, that what we have to say isn't important or
wrong, and I what to be part of the solution not the problem I feel there
needs to be a voice of positivity out there;  we all accept the negative
so quickly; but when someones positive; the first thought for a lot of us
is oh they must want something from me;  thats so sad, but unfortuately
its true sometimes. 

	Ya know I went on a group house interview tonight, and I said to
the group of people there that I much more interested in hearing about
your feelings if I'm doing something that bothers you. As I was saying it
I looked into the eyes of the people I was talking with; and I just saw
that; its hard to explain;  but its like the lites came on inside each
person. This is why I do it; I enjoy seeing someone smile because their
humanity is recognized, accepted and appreiated. I going to sign off 
today; its late. I just hope I get to hear from more of you whether in 
private or publicly. 

	Oh one other thing, I would like to thanks Brian B at Hyperreal 
for letting the list run itself. It takes a very speicial person to have 
a lot of power and not use it; to just let things be, even if its the way 
he thought it would or wouldn't be, Thanks Brian B at Hyperreal.com your 
one of the people on the scene that make it very very special and me very 
proud to be a part of it :)

I think one of the reasons a lot of people don't post is because we have
regulars here who often don't give anyone else a chance to.  By the time
someone gets the courage to contribute something, there's a good chance
that you or myself or someone other geek who happens to be sitting at a
computer all day has already beaten them to it.  I bet that if some of us
bandwidth hogs chilled out from posting so much, others would come out
of the woodwork to express their points of views a little more.  Just a 
thought.

Okay, so here's a post from me, someone who doesn't that often.  The 
above statement is ONE reason why I don't post that much.  By the time I 
am able to respond to a particular subject, many times it has already 
been talked out, IMO.
Also, I'm a person of few words, and responding to a whole letter with 
"Yeah, I feel that way, too" or "Gee, that's AWFUL" is simply bad 
etiquette.  So many times everybody else says pretty much what I was 
thinking, so I wouldn't NEED to post.
Lack of time is also another reason.  By the time I read thru all the 
mail and write my personal e-mail, it's time to go to class!  Many 
students on this list, I'm sure are, in the same boat.  Incidently, I 
have the day off from school (but not work!) and that's why I have extra 
time today.  

take care everybody!
luv,
Amy

 Swervedriver- did  a good portion of the sound track for Road Rash 3DO a vid 
game that me company produced. I like them they are dreamy/swirly sounding. I

re: Lee's and Nate posts on tribes:

The key word here is integration. 

We go to these parties, and once in while, (some more than others) have an 
experience of consequential importance on our lives. We come to an 
UNDERSTANDING.  

Do we leave this experience at the party, or do we take our experience, 
our understanding, with us into our daily lives? 

I believe we all need to ask ourselves this question. For if we aren't 
integrating -learning- from our experience, then what's the point?

We integrate this energy, this understanding, into ourselves and our 
lives, and set by step, we change the manner in which we interact with 
others.

This then encourages the ones we interact with to do the same.
(y'know, give a smile and you'll usually get one back)

Get my drift?
 
We stay positive, believe in ourselves and the energy within us all, 
and I'll just bet we can straighten out this mess we call civlization.

Just gotta have faith.

Later...

-Jonas

Please be sure to ask for permission before putting someone's picture
on a public archive. Besides being illegal (invasion of privacy), it
could cause a lot of damage for people working for conservative
companies, teens with oppressive parents, etc.

Note that this is not a comment on Cindy (hi!). I just wanted to point
out something that could get overlooked.

I was wondering if someone could give me a brief synopsis of any and all
outdoor events happening in the Bay Area in the next few weeks.  I am
completely in the mood!

Thanks -

And some of us are just quiet people who most often would rather

  We're living in a gorgeous warehouse space at the Vulcan Foundry -- an

 It'd be cool to have some like-minded technophiles for neighbors!  Here's
the deal -- it's a 2 level unit with a kitchen, bathroom, 2 lofts, and an
enclosed soundroom/darkroom.  About 1700 sq. ft., and $750 a month in rent.
 The manager's name is Michael, at 510-436-4256, and you can tell him that

Well,   today is the day where I leave you fine and wonderful folks
and head out into the unknown,  unexplored world (At least by me).

It is VERY IMPORTANT that while I'm gone,   that all of you keep
the scene alive.   It's also important to spread as much luv and
energy as possible.    

As I leave this evening,   I will skip Friday completly,  and
arrive on a Saturday,   ready for Field of Dreams in Sydney.

I already have an internet account set up,   and I'll still be 
on the net,   instead of reporting on Bay Area raves,   I'll be
reporting on Sydney (And other cities) raves.

There will be about 20 hours (From 7 pm this evening,   until 
Friday Morning at about 3 am) when I won't be able to get on the
net.

As of about 4 pm,   I'm heading out to the airport,  in preparation
for my departure at 7 pm.   Till I return,  sometime between 1 and
3 months from now,   It's been WONDERFUL Party'ing with you fine
folks.    

Cheers

	OK, y'all, sorry if I'm in error in assuming that this is of
semi-general interest, but I've gotten enough replies from interested
people to think that this is worthwhile. I also think that it's
worthwhile to set up some sort of exchange for 1200s, which I'm now
volunteering to run. Please see the end of this message for my ideas
on how this will probably work.
	I've called about 10 or 12 places so far, and the news is far
from encouraging. A lot of places that used to stock 1200s do not any
longer, and those that do have jacked up the prices considerably. I
think that what's happened is that Matsushita has finally realized
that they've got a guaranteed money-making machine with no real
competition and have constricted the supply of new turntables, thus
spiking the supply & demand curve way towards the demand end. I can't
say I blame them, but it makes it a pain in the butt for those of us
on a tight budget. I guess if I was really on that tight a budget I'd
be off buying Geminis or LinearTechs, but that's neither here nor
there.
	Pro Sound & Stage considerably tightened their price-matching
procedure recently: if you quote them a competitor's price, the
competitor has to both _have_ the product and have it _in stock_ in
order for Pro Sound to match their price. This is just a small note of
warning to those who, like me, like to give Pro Sound money but don't
like to pay $439.95 for a 1200.
	Here's a list of places that actually quoted me prices, from
least to most expensive:

	Uncle's Music     (800)328-6253         $389
        Sam Ash           (800)472-6274         $429
	Pro Sound & Stage (800)945-9300         $439
        Manny's Music     (212)819-0576         $449

	I called a bunch more places, but as there is nowhere for me
to look to find phone numbers around here (no StreetSound or URB or
whatever), I'm sorta hindered. Most of the places I called just
laughed hollowly when I asked them if they had 1200s. If somebody
wanted to be really kind, they could (PLEASE! PLEASE!) type some of
the numbers for other music places in and send them to me. That would
be saintly of you. I'm also trying to find the phone number for Full
Compass music in Wisconsin, which somebody mentioned had a really good
price a few months ago.

MY IDEAS ON THE DJ EXCHANGE

	You've all seen the Internet CD/Vinyl Wantlist, haven't you (I
bet Lazlo has ;)?  It's sort of a buyer's market for rare musical
items. I was thinking that that would be a good way to administer the
buying and selling of used DJ gear -- have buyers post a price they'd
be willing to buy at, have sellers post the price they'd be willing to
sell at, and let everybody haggle it out in an intermediated forum. It
could extend to all sorts of stuff, because the market for old Numark
mixers and Sony MDRV6 and 7506 headphones is almost as tight as the
1200 market. The free market works best when it's greased a little
bit.
	I think it'd also be nice if we had a semi-up-to-date list of
what various music stores around the country are charging for things
like 1200s, 1210s, the new Vestax tables, and Sony headphones. It's a
lot easier to part with the kind of cash it takes to buy serious DJ
equipment if you know you're getting the best possible price.
	I'd be willing to set up a page on my web site to handle
this. All I would really need is information from people about price
quotes and their buying/selling prices for gear. Does this sound like
a good idea to people? I won't bother unless I get a pretty
affirmative response (like, say, more than five people). This would be
a free service for y'all, done by me mainly because I think it's
something that would be useful.
	Anyway, I've choked your mailboxes enough, so I'll depart at
this point. Remember, I need

	o Phone numbers for DJ supply stores
	o Information on where good deals might be hiding
and	o Your votes for whether or not you think a DJ service would
	  be worth having.

thank you for your time,
ozymandias

Yeah... these two reasons fit me to a T.  Also, there's the fact that although
I've been reading this list for more than a year, I never seem to make it to
any raves.  I think my life is just too busy.  Ah well, I'll be in Austin,
Texas this weekend and will be attending an all night crash worship show
while I'm there.  Not quite a rave, but probably as much fun....

I don't think there is any stigmata to being a lurker.  I'm perfectly happy
in the role.  Hopefully, though, I will eventually get out and meet a bunch
of you regulars.  While you probably don't know me at all, I somehow feel that
I know a bit of you from what y'all write, and personally, I heartily approve
of the lot of you.

> hearing from others how raving has enhanced and help 
> improve your life outside of raving. 

OK, here goes a little background for persepective:  went to a few 
raves with a friend a couple o' years ago (been meaning to get out 
again but combination of overwork, shyness, and life problems keeps 
me close to home...don't want to bring my downer side o' life to a 
party!)

What I got from those few experiences is a profound sense of 
connectedness with people, especially people whom I had never met 
before. I carried that feeling into my daily life _ a faith or 
emphasis on being positive, seeking the good in all things, the 
desire to seek out and celebrate the goodness in all people. Then the 
interconnectedness with nature, the world at large, all things. 
Karma-ish? yeah, kinda. Spiritual? definately. Beautiful? of course!

> raving goes > way beyond what words can express.

_like great art, great music, great _


take care,
Alissa

You can do that.... they did it at shoreline for Lollapalooza, and for 
a dead concert I went to. They gave out those wrist bands.... of course I 
was offered to be sold one for a measly $5..... I didn't buy it though.

Alright, I know I'm probably being a jerk, but damn, it takes a long time 
to go through my mailbox as it is.... Please if you do post, don't post 
junk, and have a descriptive Subject line so that I know to delete it 
immediately.  PLEASE! I don't have the time to read about unix questions 
and what type of shirts people wear to raves... I know I'm gonna get 
flamed for this. Oh well.

at the same time, if some of you "bw hogs" did chill out the list might 
slow down to a trickle.  there have been many days when I open my mailbox

for a person who just got done talking about how you wanted for people to 
be more accepting of everyone, it's kinda funny to see you turn around

I knew I would get something like that... I shouldn't have phrased the 
msg the way I did... I meant pretty much that un-related stuff shouldn't 
go on this list, and That helpful subject lines are nice.  I'm probably 
being a hypocrite, but hey, who isn't?

That's totally what I feel!  No matter who you are, you feel a sense of
"connectedness" with all those around you.  Your energy becomes part of a
greater circle of energy and love.  You feel free to be who you have always
wanted to be, because nobody is judging you.  They're experiencing the
exact same rush of happiness =)  And when you leave the rave, you carry
that free spirit and high energy out with you.  You incorporate it into all
facets of life, making things a little bit better.

I have also gotten really close to nature.  The world around us is just so
beautiful.  The variety of plants and animals living with us blows my mind.
They are all coexisting in harmony, a feat humans have been unable to
fully achieve.  I find it really sad that congress does not share my
feelings.  Their new legislation is aimed at severely cutting back or
eliminating most of the environmental laws we have for the sake of
business. The Clean Water Act and many others are going to be toned down a
lot if they get their way, making way for lots more pollution.  All this
for the capitalistic dream of earning more profit.  IT is sad.

Well, the point is, that raves have allowed me to "touch base" with reality
and humanity.  Capitalism sucks.  People are beautiful.  People ought to
tell other people that they are beautiful more often.  The love and bonding
experienced at raves needs to be carried out into the world.  We are the
visionaries, and it isour job to slowly change society.  There was a
Women's movement, a sexual revolution, and many other giant steps made by
previous generations.  It is now time for the next revolution, the one back
to realizing the beaity of humanity.  To quote from Star Terk, Deep Space
Nine, "Greed is Dead."  There were a couple other good ones too, but i
forgot 'em.

The thing i hate about words, is that that is all they are, words.  I hate
writing about making change, because the whole time i am sitting on my
butt, doing nothing.  I better end my letter with this then.  Help extend
our experiences outside of the rave subculture.  All it takes is a smile to
start with, maybe a hug.  LOVE!!!  I'll begin by sending a warm, fuzzy,
energetic loving hug to all of you =).  Share it with others!

Luv,

This is an apology for my previous message... I stated that I knew I 
would be flamed, and I was right, but I wasn't prepared for the amount 
and speed of the flames I recieved.  If you don't know what I'm talking 
about, don't worry about it, just ignore this.  I'm sorry that I said 
what I said, but please stop flaming me about it. Thank

What is the connection? one may ask (well this "one" did:)

One thing I'm sure of is that we all *love* the music. Whether it's techno or
trance or house or whatever.. I personally am *addicted* to the music. 
I (and some others I have talked to) get goosebumps sometimes during a 
set or even driving down the road listening to our latest mix tape. 
One dj friend last week said that he sometimes cries..actually gets 
tears in his eyes.. when he hears some music.. or watches an awesome
dj do a superb mix. The only thing that I would have gotten this emotional
reaction heretofore was something like Beethovens 9th "Ode To Joy"...

Anyway... when I hear some great song that gives me this emotional reaction,
I sometimes look around at people and u smile and get that smile back. You
both know what ur smiling at.. then I feel the connectedness that
Alissa talks about... mebbe they feel the same "goosebumps" I do. 
And then I realize
that here we all are, from vastly diverse backgrounds, "ageless ravers" like me,
young ravers like Zack/Elf/Vladimir, people that would normally have little, if anything, in common all having the same reaction to a dj's mix...

Now thats cool :)

I've been reading the list for quite a while and I, too, have never posted.
Maybe it's that I never seem to have the time or money to make it from
Santa Cruz to all the Bay Area events (Friends and Family parties being a 
*major* exception, of course - and just when is the next one of these 
going to be? Seems like we're overdue.) Maybe it's just that the 
embarrassment of riches already here makes what I could post look 
irrelevant. As it is, I'm happy to simply read and appreciate...

I think the "levelling of the playing field" that is the result of E-mail and
posting to BBS's is still an alien concept to many. That is why lurkers
exist. But never underestimate the value of lurking to lurkers. We/they learn
so much, contribute if/when appropos, but otherwise stay out of the way.
We/they respond to the E-petitions when circulated, forward particularly
compelling posts to friends for their digestion, etc. Lurkers may not be
vocal, but they still are active.

And, don't worry. The day will come in the life of every lurker when it
becomes time to step out to make a point on a certain issue.

Kind of like what I just did..  ;-)

so tru!  Someone was saying that kids aren't allowed at raves cuz they 
don't need to pay or take responsibility for their misdeeds.  hey rich 
people with lawyers don't have to pay or take responsibilities for their 
misdeeds either.  Maybe they shouldn't be allowed out past curfew.....

Dear Sfraves;

	Due to various disagreements with the phone company over a fallen tree 
on my telephone line, I will not be able to be called at my 510-254-0933 
number until sometime Friday. I 'm using a hacked phone line right now 
and don't want to get caught. So e-mail me if you need me to call you 
with a good time to do it. Thanks.

I know these concepts come up a couple times a year, but I'm always glad to
see when they do.  It restores my faith that people are still doing this for
the right reasons.  Okay, we *all* love the music: that's a given.  But it
gives me renewed strength to hear from others who see this as more than a
party.  Hell yeah it's a party!  But hopefully at least some of those
emotions you feel will carry over into your everyday life.  That energy and
love is what's going to change the world, not the government.  It happens
one person at a time and if you don't think it makes a difference, you're
fooling yourself.

3 years ago I was bitter... a real cynic.  Somehow I got pulled into raving
and it changed my attitude and my whole life.  Don't tell me that most of
you weren't affected positively in some way by raving.  What changed you?
The music?  Maybe.  The people?  Most definitely.

Keep this in mind in your real life.  It takes so little to keep the
positive energy flowing and so much to fuel the negative.  More and more
people are opening their eyes everyday.  Have faith.  Have fun.  It's GOING
to happen.

I had another fine time at come/unity, although I think I liked the last 
one better.  This one was a little too crowded for my taste earlier in 
the evening.  I would have went later if I knew they would stay open till 
6am.  I think its great they stayed open that long, a nice unexpected 
surprize.  Thinking the party would end soon since 4am probably kept alot 
of people on the dance floor for the last 2 hours without a rest. I know 
it did for me ,not wanting to miss the last couple of songs.   Of 
course having a water pipe burst in the chill room downstairs causing it 
to close probably got more people on the floor.  Unfortunately there was no 
water to drink near the end, being that they had to turn off the water.

On a brighter note, there were some great times sharing the vibe with 
others who I felt had a great loving vibe coming from them.  I don't know 
if its me or the people in the scene (hopefully both) but lately people 
I don't know are being really friendly.  Feel like I'm getting to know more 
and more people.  For me theres been  less of that clichess feel I've 
heard others complain about in the past.  People seem to be reaching out 
more.  I can feel the love spreading, and recycling.  I'll second what 
somebody said recently, there certainly is some kind of karma thing going 
around.

Are you still doing body work on speed ?
what ever it is ...stop.
If you post less about Rush lyrics and posting about posting maybe some
one else might fill the gap.
I already know one person who unsubscribed due to the blather you post 5

Yeah, whatever Allen.  Brian is scaring everyone off the list.

Truth is, everyone does it. You do it, I do it, Milton, Peter, Lee,
Greg and Cindy, Ethan, Jayson, Zach - EVERYONE WHO POSTS adds to
the traffic and singling out Brian is a lot of shit.

The traffic on this list is not overwhelming but the decision to read it
lies within the subscriber.  The big part of that decision is whether or not
the content has value to that person.  I've seen a lot of delicious content
fly by on this list and very best of it had nothing to do with raving and
had everything to do with people.  Of course in my eyes, rave=people and its
all connected.

Now maybe it seems silly that something as dumb as techno music and a wierd
little mailing list with too much traffic might be about people.  But to
someone like me whose been rejected by the church, despised by the
government, and feared because of strangeness, this is the only community
I've got.

Rowl, ftttt,

Warning-warning Will Rogers Warning-

This is just a poorly written story- none of these people or places are real- 
I have not had related experiences- I just wrote this late at night about 
four years ago- Don't panic-



 I was alone again, nobody to hang with. Everybody was up north skiing they 
had a cabin and are up partying all weekend. What to do my flat is a mess the 
floor in my room is littered with invites to parties that I have been to, or 
will be going to in the future. Thumbing through invites I find a party for 
tonight CRASH it's called the invite reads " CRASH Friday March 26th with Jay 
ERIN FLIP WIG and Shon-e 410 269-0640." Right I call the number same old 
stuff the voice on the line screams "meet at the Plasma room for instructions 
from ten to two all night party no bust guarantied." I shower um warm water 
brings back thoughts of delights long past and over due again. Tonight I feel 
alone its almost refreshing to be like this. I have spent so much time with 
friends. I need to go out on my own, like I used to before I became so 
social. Time to spark a bowl and get high lately I have been getting the best 
green around it is so sweet. What to wear bright red baggy jeans no to much. 
How about baggy blue GAP one's with a dark purple hooded pullover. 
 Out the door to Plasma down Market on to Fourth I brought the E didn't I, 
best check. In my back pack is seven tabs of pure Ecstasy not the stuff you 
can buy in the clubs this is right off the chem floors clean and no speed. 
It's not like me to E alone but tonight I want to be forced to meet new 
people and not have to rely on old friends. The clock on the CD player reads 
midnight I slide the pill in my mouth as the music fills the car with it's 
pounding rhythm. Alone in the night the car and I glide softly into Orbit. 
 
 Outside, Plasma it is real crowded it's going to be a big party no doubt. 
Shit I don't want to come on to E in line here do I, to late I already took 
the pill. Oh that's the part I don't like about it. The come on is so 
explosive for me and I like to be in a place where I can kick it for the 
first twenty minutes or so. In line the people look alive the woman 
especially there outfits are so flowing with there bright orange and purple 
colors and there hair most of which is cropped in the 1920's style or long 
and straight. It's happening my heart is so soft and my body is open to all 
that surrounds me. Each pour of my skin is tingling and my vision is 
fluttering the lights are brilliant but a little to much. People are smiling 
at me like they know and I smile back like right it's smooth I am sorted and 
it shows. 
 A face I can recognize "Hi Adam" he whispers to me what's his name yea hi 
Eric " I am on the list if you have a ride I can get you in." "Right where is 
the party" I ask. " it's at the Attic 178 King ST." Yea I dig it I have been 
there before that place is a trip you have to climb about twelve flights of 
stairs just to reach it." "So can you give me a ride or what Eric says." 
  
 Ridding there in the car Eric talks a mile a minute as the vibe of the House 
music brings, takes us both on a trip through the city that appears to be so 
alive to me that I can feel each groove in the road. "So Adam can you see the 
Moon, no you can't know why cause it's blocked by dust from Nuclear bomb 
testing in Nevada." The winds blow all sorts of stuff around Adam, for 
instance the remains of all sorts of dead creatures are being blown all about 
as we drive. Think about it? Well this guy Eric is flipid what is he on about 
now. "Listen Adam if I was in my forties now I would be studying to find 
myself a new job, something completely different then what I do now." "What 
do you do now." I ask. "Oh I Rave, you know sell shit, you know stuff." 
"Yea!" I replay like a twelve year old on vacation at DisneyLand. 

CRASH:
It is good to be here the thumping of the bass has carried me on to the dance 
floor. From the moment I entered, I felt this presence like someone would be 
coming my way. I am floating with the music my arms stretched out wards to 
everyone spinning endlessly I am in perfect motion, with the sound entering 
every inch of my soul. My eyes open to find the outline of a figure dancing 
in front of me. She is long and thin with straight shoulder length black hair 
that is parted down the middle. Her eyes are as blue as the clearest sky's 
which reflect endlessly with the lasers whisking about in the background. Are 
eyes lock together, something that is not permitted in today's world eye 
contact. She brisks by my side and say's " Hooked are you". I twist to her 
side and reply " on what." She turns away from me and smiles, I look into her 
eyes again and they call me in. They tug at my heart and she walks away. What 
the fuck.

I follow her and she jesters me on with her hand. She leads me up some stairs 
to the roof of the building and we walk outside. The evening is nice and 
contrary to what Eric said earlier you can see the moon and it is near full 
at that. "What's your name, and do you have any more" She asks. "My name is 
Adam and what do you mean do I have any more." "E do you have any E your eyes 
it says it in your blue eyes your on E."  "Right I am going, and I would be 
glad to give you one but what is your name." My name is Claire." I dig into 
my backpack and pull out a tab and a bottle of Crystal Geyser a Raver's best 
friend, plus some gum cause my teeth are grinding a bit. She takes the pill 
and we go and sit on the cat walk over looking down town. Claire asks. "When 
you were young did you ever run and jump into the wind with your umbrella 
open. Do you remember that, didn't you feel like you could fly for ever in 
the wind. I have that feeling right now like I could jump off of this roof 
top and fly through out this city like a witch or something." "Um like right 
sometimes I feel like a diver swimming in an endless mass of green ocean, 
completely naked and free." "Adam, Adam I am starting to peak oh? oh! yes can 
I kiss you Adam can I." I grab her into my arms and we meet softly touching 
lips once and then parting and then slowly drawing each other in again our 
tongues glide in and out of each others. My body feels hers next to it, I can 
feel her every curve and at once can all of a sudden feel her heart beat, I 
need nothing else but to hold her next to me. I start to nibble on her neck 
and can taste drop lets of sweat the kinda sweat that the E brings, and I 
feel a closeness with her unlike I have with any of the others before her.  

We hold each other for hours it seems, feeling the cold air and talking about 
love, life, death and everything that comes between. The sun starts to rise 
and like the wind I feel a rush of life as the pounding music fills the roof 
top. A girl dances like a tap dancer in a trance all around us. She has two 
huge braids of hair flapping in the wind and is wearing Pippy long Stocking 
pants. How weird? Claire watches the girl like she is in awe of her, now that 
the sun is appearing I can see Claire's brilliance she is of light complexion 
in her mid twenties and has the most intense blue eyes with thick eyebrows 
that make her appear very smart. She has a scar on the left side of her chin 
that gives her an interesting flaw. She is very thin and could be a speed 
fiend but I don't want to pass judgment with all things considered. 

She asks me. "What do you want to do today, do you want to go to the after 
party at the bEnd Up." "Yes I reply that will be fun, it looks like it's 
going to be a sunny day and the bEnd Up will be a gas, no doubt." "Do you 
have a car Adam." "Yea I can get us there." Saturday it's noon at the bEnd Up 
and the Queens are out in force dressed in  tight shorts, with leather hats 
on, and dancing in the sunshine. I can't stop laughing at them no matter how 
hard I try. "What are you laughing at Adam." "That guy look at him in the 
dress with makeup on and fake tits, and hairy legs what's up with that? I've 
had enough Claire, I think I'm done fully cooked know what I mean." "Yea you 
want to leave then." I drive Claire home, we kiss and exchange numbers I am 
not disappointed I don't want to go in with her, really?

Riding on the hwy. I feel so high, the lights still glisten as I listen, to 
the sounds pass through me. Life surrounds me, people in there cars  only 
look straight ahead. I am beginning to feel tired and am coming down. At home 
I slide on down to bed to rest. I have not been feed at all today. Um the 
lights are fading "who are you" a soft voice from behind asks I turn and face 
a woman smoking a long cigarette she is wearing a silk black gown that goes 
down to her ankles, she has a hat on with some sort of feather in it and 
looks like someone right out of Harlem in the flapper days. Hi sunshine, I 
reply my name is Adam what are you up to."  My name is not sunshine I am a 
lady not some sort of image in your little boys mind." "Oh pardon me?" "My 
name is Claire she whispers at me" "Haven't we meet before" I ask.  She 
glares at me and then softly let's out a smile. "No I think not. Come with me 
Adam let's go to the Palace." "What's that about." She grabs my hand and we 
walk down the ally she is cold I can feel her nails tug at my skin and they 
are oh so cold. She has a very round face with dark eyes she is pretty, but 
not really my type, she is dark skinned and evil looking no doubt everything 
she has on is black, I bet her whole fucking wardrobe is black. 

Outside the Palace: People are cued up along a brick wall they all smoke and 
the men they are very fancy, I have never seen people like this ever, all in 
black each one of them. They have on long coats white shirts and ties with 
shiny dark shoes. People wave and talk to Claire as we pass on by. I can't 
even glance at the women they are way to much to look at with there fish net 
stockings and cool hats. "Let's go in Adam". 

We enter into a  room that has the feel of a fancy restaurant with waiters 
cruising around fanatically. Claire tugs at me and pulls me down the corridor 
to a stairway leading down stairs. An old guy is at the bottom of the stairs, 
he waves at Claire and smiles we rush by, and Claire say's softly "Hi 
Charles". " A night of the fullest sorts Claire", the old guy chatters. 
Claire says nothing to the guy and we head down some stairs. At the end of 
the stairs is a old looking wooden door, Claire bangs on the door three 
times. A slot in the door opens and a mans voices utters "a pear in the likes 
of order." Claire replies, "it's nice to fly so high." 

The door swings open and a rush of strange smelling smoke leaves the room as 
we enter. The basement is filled with people dancing and lounging about. They 
appear to be smoking opium pipes and the scent is very odd. The music is 
right out of the 20's, the clothes that the people are wearing are very 
flashy. The lady's hats all have feathers and there not wearing much else. 
Men and women are rolling about all over the place. Claire brings me over to 
a couch in the corner of the room. We sit down and an old Chinese man comes 
over and offers us a pipe and some opium. Claire pays the guy and fills the 
pipe. "Have you ever gotten down and done opium Adam", "no I don't think so" 
I say. "Oh you're in for some fun." 

I take a long draw off the pipe and let out a line of smoke in the air, a fast
 rush fills my mind and my body slowly let's out all it's steam. I am empty, I
 have no muscle left. The room around me is spinning and filled with laughter.
 I can see woman floating by, but I can't make out there faces everything is 
in outlines, like a coloring book that needs filling in. Claire is licking at 
my earlobe and I am getting hard? What's going on? Her tongue is racing down 
my neck, I grab at her thigh and she pulls my hand inside her dress. She 
climbs on top of me and lifts me inside her. We ride each other slowly as 
people dance and walk on by. Nobody pays us any attention, as I climax with a 
loud laughter! Claire leans far back, bending backwards toward the ground. She
 then thrusts forward in fast motion and swings at my neck. She has a razor 
blade! She pulls to the side and then slashes the blade across my neck. I can 
feel each drop of blood fall from me

I can feel Claire above me breathing down on me. I open my eyes and she is 
there next to my bed, looking at me with her crisp blue eyes. "Why did you 
leave me, you could have asked to come in. You always leave me!." "How did you
 find me" I ask. "You are listed, I just sort of let myself in." Claire lifts 
her arm from behind her back and I can see in her pale hand a bloody razor. I 
look down to the ground as droplets of my blood fall to the floor. "You never 
cared did you Adam."

Yes yes yes!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I *KNEW* that this was going to be that mysterious Equinox party 
mentioned on the sfraves guide!  I asked for that weekend off a month ago 
from work and have told everyone I know to go, so I have a bunch of 
friends to take with me!  This is one party I'm *NOT* missing.  I haven't 
gotten to go to a rave since December 18th, and I am biting at the bit - 
ready to unleash 3 months of pent up energy at the best party this 
spring!!!  YYYYYYYYYYYYYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY!!!!!!!!!!

luv to all,
Amy

On the other hand, Brian.  Maybe we just haven't had a catalyst that has
brought us together before the rave scene. 

I'm pretty confident that if we all sat down and shared stories (which is
kind of what we do on-line), we would find out that we all have a lot in
common, and the music is the denominator that has brought us together.

Doesn't it seem that Ravers tend to be of the same breed?

Breed:  a number of persons of the same stock.

Ravers make good soup!

from the KAREN half of this account ...


Further comment on Alissa's (?) comment on friendliness at raves!  I don't
know about the scene in sf but up here in vancouver bc I find that I can't
stand club at all any more.  Why?  TOO CLIQUEY!!!  Everyone is totally
concerned with image and getting laid.  Now I enjoy getting laid as much as
the next girl but I'd rather not have to wade through a bunch of dorks at a
club to do so...and as for image, sure it's fun to look cool but the
clothes do not make the person, neither does the hair, the tattoos, the
piercings, the brandings, or what have you.  And at a rave I find that I
feel totally relaxed and free to go talk to whoever I want about whatever I
want without worrying about being taken the wrong way.


YA ALL KNOW WHAT I MEAN???

peace

I have occasionally posted (well, ok, VERY occasionally), but mostly I lurk
because I don't really know any of the regulars on the list. I haven't
really gone out very much in the last year and a half... but as always, I
keep saying to myself that "I'll go this week." My girlfriend doesn't
really like ANY form of dance music, and doesn't really like clubs, which
is why I don't really go out much. But I've subscribed to this list for
almost a year (about the time I got e-mail), because it has good
information and a good community of users with much knowledge to share.

I used to be really into the scene, in 1992-93, before it got really
commercial and trendy (That's another reason I stopped going...). As far as
I can tell, it has gotten away from that vibe somewhat, which makes me want
to get into it again.

So that's where I'm coming from...

I will probably be at basics (if not there, wicked) this saturday, my
cousin from Ireland is in town for a while and wants to check out the
world-famous SF club scene. So, if you see a large group of people talking
with an Irish accent, go up to them and ask for Brian. Introduce yourself,
and maybe I will get to know some of the wonderful people on this list. And
then I won't lurk so much...

Respect,
Brian

Hello Friends,

	We would like to take another moment to tell you a little more 
about ourselves...

	About two - three years ago, a group of ravers, (our close 
personal friends from San Jose,) came to the conclusion that being a 
raver and putting in our positive energy as party goers was not enough. 
We decided that we wanted to do more for the scene. More than giving 
candy, hugs, etc. (although those things are really important!) We 
thought the most that anyone could do for the scene was not just to 
attend, but was to provide parties. 

	So, thus born, Harmony. The name harmony means so much to us. It 
signifies everything that we believe in, everything that we are about. 
In our party, there are several different people with several different 
ideas, which are used to create one idea. The idea is a place where all 
ravers, (regardless of age, race, creed, color,) are welcome. No matter 
where the parties are we vow to never exclude anyone. (a.k.a., 21+) One 
thing that annoys us, is when you look at a flyer, and say perhaps, oh, 
Justin Robertson, The Dust Bros., Doc Martin, etc. are performing, and 
you get all psyched to go, and what do you see... At the bottom of the 
flyer, in little tiny print, 21+. No one should ever be turned away from 
an event - period.

	The scene is not about classifications, it is about coming 
together as one culture to expand our awarness about eachother, to 
eachother. 

THE SCENE IS ABOUT POSITIVITY, AND THAT IS WHAT WE ARE ABOUT... 

	Friday, August 13th, 1993 was the date of our first party. 
Everything was going great until we lost our location. It turns out that 
the person that we rented land from, didn't actually own the land. You 
can figure out what happened after that. Your basic, pulling your 
hair out, going nutbar, disaster!!!! So, it was of to Santa Cruz to 
attempt to throw an outdoor party...

	We got busted at the beach, moved to a field on Swanton road, 
given to us by one of the ravers that stuck it out through the waiting 
and turmoil. The party went off! It was sooooo beautiful. People 
dancing, laughing, sharing, and smiling. Dionysus Dreams stuck it out 
and did an ambient area in the forest next to the field where Carlos 
tore it up. 

	Anyways, that was our first party, our first dream. And we have 
done three other parties since then, and with great success. Great 
success to us means that people are happy, not that we made money or 
even broke even. Come to think of it, we have lost big money at all of 
our parties. We don't care!!!!! That is why we do this, because we are 
in it for the scene, not the greed. 

	It is kinda hard not to throw another party when we have ravers 
calling us saying, "Harmony, where are you guys? When's the next one?" 
So, we are doing it again. 

	Friday, March 10th is Harmony and we encourage everyone to 
particpate in making this the best one yet! This is our first indoor 
party, ever... That means we have all the posibilities in the world! We 
have the most beautful location that we could ever dream of. We can't 
tell you where it is on sfraves, but write to us at the address on this 
posting and we will personally write you back with more info.

	Friday, March 10th - 8pm-6am

	HARMONY

     Between listening to my stomach gurgle at the thought of 'Fractals

     generally a much nicer and friendlier type of person in general! Heck, 
     some of the nicest people I've met and friends I now have are through 
     raving as the catalyst! Great point!

Hey Allen,

Thanks for the SPUNDAES=Canonball Run III review. I finally got it
Wednesday night. It made me burst out laughing on the dance floor.

Dub Tribe had a lot of energy

It's not _that_ bad.  I don't go to the clubs to get laid, I go to dance 
and on weeknights the clubs are the only places you can dance.  We're not 
fortunate enough to have weeknight parties here.  Now back to your

Dear Sfravers;

	278 11th Street is a nice place to rave; it has real potential,
but I feel lacks a committed staff. I went there last saturday night, it
was a small but good party, ran into Peter F. 

	It has a pool table that is much more functional than the one at
1015 Folsum. An outside upstairs that would be dynamite in the warmer 
months; reminding me of Simion's in Gainesville, FL. It has a pool 
underneath the dance floor, lots a potential there for a rave pool party. 

	But the party ended at 4am sharp; which meant that 278 11th Street
threw you out into the streets. That particular night there was no were
else to go. I was stoned out of my mind on whatever. I think that if your
going to throw a party, and you're well aware that people who come to them
do party, that the party should last long enough at least 6am so people
have a chance to come down so that they can either walk home in the
twilight, or be safe enough to drive home or go to the End Up or alt. after
party. 

	It's a really cool and neat place, but come on guys; stay open
later. I see that you guys are open to 5am this time, but I will warn
ravers that go there, expect them to close it down at 5am. I don't want to
make the people throwing the party responsible for our actions inside, but
I feel in should be law that if you throw a rave, on the weekend, that the
party should go to at least 6am. I wasn't very happy and neither was Peter
F. at 4am with no place else to go, I just went to the End Up and stayed
outside until they opened, boring!!!!. Again to make it very clear the
each one of us is responsible for whatever we snort, drop, shoot, smoke,
rub into your bellies whatever, you are responsible and should only do
what you're cabable of doing and still be able to take care of your self.

ps If you go let the management know how you feel about them closing, in 
my opinion early, and I feel they will listin to us, they seem like good 
people.

Glad to see you've kept the determination to continue.

Now if we could just find out how to put in the water supply...

Well it's 4:00 in the morning and TONY is on his way back to S.F.

He spun a free party here in sac-town and boy-oh-boy, did he ever make
the wax melt..

for those of you going to BASICS....... If he is one-fourth as good as
he was in Portland, Oregon for KINDNESS, and one-half as good as he was
here in sac.........You are in for a very special treat. Listen
carefully to the fantastic mix of new tribal trance and old acid house
he has been conjuring up for for a spell to make even me dance for 2-1/2
hours straight...


Have Fun

My friends are in town from NY tonight, and we wanted to go out somewhere
interesting. However, one of them forgot his ID, he has absolutely nothing
(that rules out wicked and basics, no?) Is there any good parties going on
tonight that won't stress on the ID problem? My friend is 24, he doesn't
look young or anything...

Any suggestions?

Thanks,

My friends are in town from NY tonight, and we wanted to go out somewhere
interesting. However, one of them forgot his ID, he has absolutely nothing
(that rules out wicked and basics, no?) Is there any good parties going on
tonight that won't stress on the ID problem? My friend is 24, he doesn't
look young or anything...

Any suggestions?

Thanks,
Brian Benitez

Dear Sfraves;

	I had one of the most mixed nights I ever had in a long time, 
maybe never. I went to All Together Now and 278 11th Street. My jourey 
starts out at final desination of All Together Now.

	WE arrive at the party location after going to one map point to 
find the police, yuk what away to start a night. So we go back to the map 
point and tell the good people of Kinetic, it looks like your busted. I 
having a truck which could assit in getting the PA out off of the bay 
jetty was asked to help and did, We arrive back at the map to find out 
the cops didn't care about the party they were looking for someone with a 
gun. Well, the people of Kinetic run back to the map point and I say and 
help do the previerbial door. Ever go to a party and get asked to work 
the door? Well, anything fo r the scene, I start checking tickets for 
about 2 hours, its about two ao'clock know. I watching these motorhead 
dudes race up and down the streets bringing the police back. The police 
say over there PA leave or will tow you cars, so I do unable to find out 
about what happened to the party.

	I go to 278 11th Street, its looking like a real suck of a night 
folks, and when I get to 278 11th Street, a club supposed to stay open 
till 5am closes at 4am, ah!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. Thats all I'm going to say 
about 278 11th Street.

	In total desparation, while on the most killer E I've been on in
awhile, I return to Kinetic's location at the end of Coral Street and what
do I find, the most coolest party I've been to all year. I got there when
Bog was spinning, check him out, him and his girl friend Anie are great
people. The location had been undisturbed by the police on the 2nd
incident, yeah!!!! SFPD. Give em credit where credit due. I got to pretty
much watch the sun come up over the bay, with an aircraft carrier to by
right about .25 miles away, and a large dock crane about 200 yards to
left, the beautiful bay in the center with a killer PA basting the most
awsome Techno and Trance, I've heard in a long time, and a very warm fire
after we raided the Saveway for cardboard and Duraflame logs, yes outside.
This is why I came here, an beautiful outdoor rave at an imprompt to 
location, great works guys sorry for the sarcassum in the begining, I 
guess you guys really mean your name, ALL TOGETHER NOW!!!!!!

My friend <davis> and I had a wonderful night at All Together Now.  We met at
her house which was just a few blocks from the map point.  We walked to the
map point, saw a lot of people just hanging out, and were told the party got
busted.  Anyway after about a half hour, someone came back and said no, the
party was on.  So we got our tickets and maps, and walked back to our car
together with three new friends who needed a ride.  I was delighted to see
that the location was the same as the last Sunset of 1994 - a great place 
with a wonderful view of the bay.

When we got there, things were still a little tense because of the cops who
were checking us out, but they were semi-cool and at least let us stay there.

We walked out to the point on a dark trail through the grass, past a
brightly lit factory with starkly surreal smokestacks stretching into the
night sky.  A group of happy energetic ravers were dancing to the music, 
sitting around the fire keeping warm and exploring our little peninsula.
The tide was high when we got there, so the point that I remembered being a 
couple hundred feet wide was just a narrow finger of land surrounded by dark
waves, with us in the middle dancing.

The lights of the city shone like jewels in the night, with the Bay Bridge
gleaming like a string of pearls stretching off into the distance.

As the night passed, we became aware of the gentle and powerful planetary
rhythms.  The earth, sun, and moon did their eternal dance and we danced
to our own rhythms as the waves rolled into the shore and the tide slowly
receded, exposing the wet slippery rocks that were under water at the
start of the evening.  The planet turned, the night passed, and the sun 
slowly rose in the east, painting the sky with its approach.  A fiery red
glow turned to gold as the sky grew brighter and the colors spread across
the sky welcoming us to a new day.

We cleaned up the site and gave hugs and smiles to everyone as the world
reawakened from its sleep.

As I returned to the car, I became aware of another rhythm.  The fields
which were dry and brown at the end of last summer were being renewed
again in the growing warmth of the approaching spring.  Beautiful golden
poppies reflected the golden light of the sun and the fragrant fennel
plants were sprouting new growth even as the last of last season's seeds,
dry and brown, still clung to the old stalks.

When the five of us, plus another friend who needed a ride got back to
the car, we tensed as we were approached by a cop.  "What's up?", he 
asked.  "Just watching the sunrise", I said.

greg

ps:  Hugs to everyone, especially Brian D. who I got to meet for the
first time last night, after seeing all his great posts here.

Dear sfravers,

	This was a comment that didn't necessarily piss me off but 
inspired me to say a few things, tell a little story..
Any way the inspirational quote was from Jason Weber to  Lee Fogal that 
was carbon copied to sfraves.  The quote read,"Last time I gave my 
opinion on sfr i think i got every E-popping frat boy in california.  Well 
I am not exactly sure what Jason meant buy this but it was especially 
significant to me for a few reasons.  
	The story sees a college freshmen out on his own for the first 
time.  The freshmen (obviously that is me) goes out and rushes a 
prestigious fraternity. Lamda Chi Alpha to be exact..Now before you hit 
delete please read on...
	So during this first year I happen across a small rave in Santa 
Cruz.  It was small scale and I felt a little out of place ,although I did 
love the music very much.  My friends and I danced sober and I before I 
left I was given a mysterious phone number. The next day I called the number.
One thing lead to another and I experienced my first mind-blowing rave.
The gathering at the richmond civic center.  Needless to say it was quite 
a experience.  Ouch candy flipping is hard on the old system.  Anyway I 
returned to what I now consider cowboy land in comparison to the Bay 
Area ,San Lius Obispo. At this point in time I was still rushing the 
fraternity.  I asked a few of the brothers how they felt about those rave 
parties in San Fransisco.  A summary of a few of thier replies:
"Those people are wierd"
" They have all those earinings in their body , thier just strang and 
wacked out"
	This was obviously a major turnig point in my fraternity life.  
Fraternities tend to accept members I think that kinda think like they do.
Anyway to make a very long story short ,like I haven't talked enough, I 
ended up being dissasociated from the fratenity.  They felt like "I just 
wasn't ready to be a part of the house".  The truth is that my true 
feelings of feeling odd for not being around a group of people that 
excpted raves really really showed through and it came out in my 
interaction with the fraternity.  I don't plan to rush again because I now
know I don't really belong in the Greek Scene.  I hope that the readers 
of Sfraves will sympathiize with me on this subject very much and 
understand that the warm positive vibe ,chemically induced or not, I loved 
so much at raves is much more congruent with my inner personality than a 
Keg party.  I have to say that I have nothing against Keg parties but I 
have such a more positive fulfilling experience at rave parties.  I also 
hope that this message is accpeted as it is my debut message to the 
sfrave community.. My final question for all that I would greatly like to 
recieve feed back on is,  Is it is wrong to want to move and change my 
environment to be closer to this community that I truly love more than 
the current position.  Responses by all are extremely welcomed.  As of 
attending the Gathering I can never make it to the bay area enough to 
continually partake in these rituals of unity, acceptence, and most of all 
love.
	Universal Love and Peace to All ..Dan.

	A.K.A.  (to some)  X-rave virgin

The Trip
========

6:21:03 AM  3/3/95 - SF time

Well,   here I am,   sitting on the plane with my laptop,   flying
across the Pacific.   I just woke up after 7 hours of sleep.   And
after learning that we are not even half way there yet...   OhMyGawd!
the realization of how long this flight is,   is just now hitting me.
Turbulance is really bad.    Very rough flight.   Hard to focus my
bleary eyes on the keyboard....

There is this neat TV monitor on the plane,  showing us our progress,
and displaying outside temperature as -43 degress BELOW ZERO outside
the plane,    so far,  we've flown about 6000 miles,  and as I'm
typing this,  we just crossed the Equator....   I'm now OFFICIALLY
in the Southern Hemisphere.   Anyway,  the stewardess just handed me
the most grotesque sandwitch I've ever seen.    I nibbled on it
until I realized that it wasn't editable.    

After partying at Come/Unity,  tweaking my brains out,   I wanted to
get as tired as possible (For me,  thats extremly difficult to do).

Anyway,   I'm powering down my laptop and going back to sleep.   At
least I'm going to try...    Got plenty of flight time left to finish
this piece of programming code later....

-------------
10:53:25 AM  3/3/95
-------------

Well,   We're getting closer now....   Still about 700 miles out,  and
I slept another 6 hours.    I feel really refreshed now,   and the
stewardess is now preparing breakfast.   We just crossed an island,
I think it's Tahiti...  (Scuse spelling).    I plug in my walkman
and hear just one FM station.  Announcer is speaking French...

Lots of clouds below me,  and the sunrise took place about 5 monutes
ago.    Hmmm!!  A very LONG sunrise...   Sun is to our left,  and
back sorta behind us.

I see no sign of land,   once we crossed this set of islands where
there appears to be a tropical reef.   For the past 8 hours,   I've
been crossing the tropics.    Really awsome blue sky.   I've never seen
it so blue.    Really deep dark blue sky.

Well,   more later,   as I'm fixing to run some code through the compiler
now and prepare to test it out.    WOW!!  I slept like a baby...  Normally
I don't sleep on planes,   but after Come/Unity I wanted to get myself
so tired that I COULD sleep.    It WORKS.   Dispite the horrible jet lag
I thought I would have,   in my brain,  it FEELS like morning.    I just
had about 5 extra hours in my evening.    Figuring out the time difference
is really easy.   Subtract 5 hours,  and ADD a day,  and you get the
Sydney time.    Cool!!    or just ADD 19 hours.

About to land in Sydney now,   the pilot announced that I have to shut
off my computer before landing...

7:50:53 PM  3/3/95 - Calif time.

Well,  I have been picked up at the airport by Martin Degroot,  i'm
currently at his place at the moment,   and I picked up a power plug 
for the mac,  and am now plugged in,   and I even have a phone adapter
to modular plug for built in modem.

I might be sending this from my apana account,  because telnet isn't
yet activated.

At 4 pm Saturday,  (my time) 9 pm your time (friday) I meet the rest
of the AusRave folks at a cafe,  then go to a pub and have a beer.

Weather here is raining,  although warm (About 75 degress F) so I brought
the rain with me.

This evening,  it's Field of Dreams...

Sabatage report
===============

Greetings from Australia...   This is my FIRST rave report from 
Sydney,  and after learning that advance tickets for Field of 
Dreams sold out weeks ago,   and the door price was $70.   Yukk
so we went to Sabatage.    Sabatage was held in a hot and very 
sweaty night club that had little or no chill out opportunity,  ad 
because of the Mardi Gras,  was literally packed shoulder to 
shoulder,  and the only direction I could move is up and down.

Not sure who the DJ's were,   but the music was totally insane 
acid trance,  similar to Goa type of music.    My Australian hosts 
are really great wonderful people,   and it wasn't long before I
they realized the energy level I exist at.    I wasted no time,  
getting out to the dance floor,   as I was getting down to the 
serious business of raving.    The energy level here is totally 
insane,   but the music seems sorta softer at the higher BPMs.
As I was dancing around,   Phil Smart (A DJ that recently did a 
gig in San Francisco recognized me.   It blew him away,   and we 
talked for a while and meminisced the SF rave he spun at recently.

But this rave was really housey,  which surprised me.   Weather 
here still rainey,  although warm and very humid..   As the 
evening wore on,  I got more aggresive on the dance floor,  
spreading as much luv as possible,  and got lots of smiles 
returned back.   The scene here is very similar to the SF scene, 
but the people here are far more polite.   

At about 4 am,   Phil Smart went on the turntables and went 
insane,  playing about 60% of the songs so familiar to our own SF 
scene.    Then he played my all time favorite "feel so good",  and 
I upped the energy level several notches and really got down and 
wicked.    By this time,   most of the local club crowd had left,  
and I really had lots of room to really fly around.

My Australian hosts were totally amazed at my high energy level,  
as they sat outside for a while.   Phil really ripped it up big 
time,   especially after he played "Feel so good".

The rave ended at 7 am,   and we wandered around Sydney,  looking 
for a breakfast place open that early in the morning,   and took a 
cab back to Simon Rumbles place and chilled.

It's now evening,   and I'm over at Bills place,   watching TV,  
and typing in this report.    Now,  I'll post this as soon as a 
line is available.

Cheers...  Lots more to come...
C. Crunch from Down under...

Syrian Rue is a ground seed which contains the active ingredient harmaline.
It is in the family of Harmala alkaloids. It is generally used to 
potentiate other psychedelics like LSD but can produce EXTREME nasuea and 
vomiting if you take too much. (I know this from experience).

The harmala alkaloids are MAO inhibitors and you should be careful not to 
mix them with certain substances like alcohol or amphetamines.

I highly recommend the book _The Essential Psychedelic Guide_ by D.M. 
Turner (1994, Panther Press,SF) which can give you the full story on many 
substances and the proper safety precautions. I've seen it at Ameba and 
other fine alternative establishments in the Bay Area. An added bonus is 
a beatiful cover graphic by Nick Philip.

Intelligent use of psychedelics can catalyze evolution but they must be 
understood in the right context and used with respect. Happy trips:)

peace,
ronan

Dan, thanks for the story.  To give you feedback on your story and 
question, I can't say what is wrong or right for you, but I can really 
identify with the feeling of wanting to move closer to this community.  

I attended my first major rave about 3 years ago.  It was called freedom 
harvest.  It was on a beach, and to this day is still probably my 
favorite all time rave.   I had enjoyed dancing for some time prior to 
going to that rave, but dancing at that rave with the vibe that was there 
made dancing out to be much more to me.  I can remember thinking, the 
people here aren't just dancing, they seem to be meditating together and 
the music was everyone's shared montra.  That feeling of love and 
connectedness and the discovery of this beautiful psychadelic community 
made me feel like I needed to be closer.  It already felt very homey to 
me, more than where I was living for the last 12 years.  I had already 
thought about moving to sf but after that rave I suddenly found myself 
visiting more and looking for a job here.
Welcome to sfraves Dan.

Would anyone in the SF area be interested in doing volunteer work for the 
local high school debate teams?  They need volunteer judges for certain 
competitions on Saturdays.  The catch is it's all day, I think you get 
free lunch.  Anyone want more info just mail me.

Wicked or basics, wicked or basics, wicked has been good to me so there I 
went.  It's just not the same without the Crunch bouncing around.  Not 
terrible but it could have been better.  Let's just say I got kicked by 
the security guy because I was trying to stay awake and failing.  WHat do 
they have against sleeping anyways?

i know there has been a lot of debate about or staple rave lighting

ahhahahahhahahaha

this is from the examiner (sf) Feb 28, 95 page c-7

"THEATRICAL 'FOG' CAN INDUCE ASTHEMA

     Artificial fogsed in theater productions can induce asthema attacks, 
doctors said Thursday.
     Australian doctors Peter Nolan and Philip Masel warned asthmatic 
actors to be wary of exposure to the substance.
     'We recommend that amateur groups that use such devices should 
forewarn any members of the potential for such exposure to aggravate 
asthma,' they said in article in the British medical journal Lancet.
     The article cited the case of a 15-year-old-girl with mild asthma 
who sufferd an attack while rehearsingfor a school play in which

dan, your letter struck a very familiar feeling that i had four years 
ago. after going to toontown for the first time i hella wanted to leave 
davis, where i was attended UCD. soon i found myself in san jose and was 
a part of the family of sfravers. problem is that four years later i 
find myself thinking about having finished school there. all the peace, 
love, and harmony that sf had to offer gave way to feeling cynical, 
deppressed and angry that i allowed myself to so fully swept away. people 
will argue that this is a cynical reply and that it has no bearing 
whatsoever towards sf or raves, but i strongly feel that one has to set 
aside the lovey feelings, the drugs, and the vibes and truly think what 
he/she can get out of this before making such a strong decision. chances 
are the first feelings of all this is so fucking brilliant it leaves you 
blinded to the real world. and unfourtunatley its the real world that 
matters most of the time. i hope this doesn't bring you down any. and by 
no means is this a suggestion or warning; its just my story.
peace dj thad

ok i guess i should jump in on this one...

as a high schooler i knew alot about acid house parties and techno 
culture..i then went to a few parties and shipped myself off to dc to go 
to The American University...there i found the net and raves/ravers...i 
became an active ne-raver and still having ties to sf..an sfraver...also 
i helped co found the dc-raves list...i am a member of a global community of 
net-ravers...infact i still remeber when i was first given an sfraves pin 
or neraves badge and welcomed to the "family" or the first time i logged 
on to vrave...

after a while i started questioning why i was in dc so i moved back to 
sf...during that summer before i moved back to sf i traveled around the 
east coast...never staying in a hotel...always with a net-raver...(and 
finally ended up near nyc at laura's house) 

finally getting back to sf...i went on a binge partying spree...i like to 
go out a few times a week...this proved productive when i met a lot of 
people from all over (especially what i like to call the thursday night 
crowd or the your sisters house/(what was the name of that party that 
jonah used to have on thursdays at the troc with the trance music ...the 
name has slipped my mind temporarily..ahhh) but now the novelty of 
partying every night has warn off and i go out occasionally...

i have made quite a few good friends (shouting over loud music or chatting 
away with on the list or vrave) and got back into school (sfsu)...and have 
mellowed out quite a bit...slowly i am becomming a net.geek...

I learned one thing along the way...don't let raving take over your 
life...sure it can be part of your identity but certianly not all of 
it..cuz (gosh i am full of cliche's) what you put into raving (bringing 
stuff to share, diy parties, hugs, whatever) you will get back in ways 
you don't expect...(hell, i never realized i wanted to be an information 
arts and conceptual design artist)

i have found my involvement with the net-raver community positive...it 
lead me to many things i may never have known about or done...but only you 
can know what is best for you...

(infact sfraver old-timers might remember a certian closing of mine..ehheheh)

partyon...susie (:

p.s. no fair saving this and sending it to my grandkids...heheheh

Hiya,

	I aint from San Fransico, but I come down there ocassionally and 
I enjoy reading the posts....I particulary like this thread so i think 
ill add my two cents......I will never forget my first taste of a real 
rave (well if I go on partying like some of these crystal smoking drug 
dumpsters I might), I went apeshit....this was what I had been searching 
for all my life (sounds pretty fucking dramatic but pretty true) and the 
music blew me away....and then I was given a little pill that blew me out 
of the galaxy...it made the music sound so fucking heavenly...I had been 
reading NME and the like about Acid house parties and Raves from England, 
thinking to myself I need to be at this shit....there had only been a 
handfull of records that blew my mind (Meat Beat Manifesto, 808 
State-Newbuild, RSW-In Dub......) and then all of the sudden I was 
hearing all types of shit that was so wicked....holy shit, i thought....I 
remember being psyched for weeks when I saw a new flyer for a killer 
rave....but while all this shit was going on I was stuck in Eugene Oregon 
at the University of Oregon....no one I knew down there even knew about 
these "Raves" and the music and I was going stir crazy....friends would 
call me from Portland to tell me about the warehouse party they were at 
last night while I was sitting in a dorm room with a bunch of dorks 
drinking as many beers as I possibly could....I needed to be beamed up 
back to Portland, so I dropped out of U of O and moved back....and now 
three years later many freinds from U of O have graduated, while I have 
been booted from Portland State University still just barely a Junior, 
working in a restaurant with a bunch of people who have made some wrong 
turns in their life too......I am not saying I regret my moves I just 
want to get thru school now (or pretty soon) while still following the 
music and the raves.....I don't think everyone has to become a suit to be 
"successful", I just don't want to end up like the guy I work with who 
tonight was saying "I should make it out of here in a few years" from our 
shitty job, and this guy is 34 years old, and he is bussing tables with 
me (he got fucked up on cocaine during his twentys)...
I have seen friends get into crystal meth and fuck themselves up 
hardcore...and I have seen others that raved real hard for a year and a 
half and got out of it...and others who have been raving for 4-5 years 
while still keeping their shit together....the only person who can keep 
you from going where you want to go is yourself....it is good to have 
some goals and to keep yourself in check....that is all for my Sunday 
Sermon....

>It's just not the same without the Crunch bouncing around. 

Hey!!  I'm there dude,  in spirit of course....

Just curious,  where was Wicked this time?    Also,   where was
Basics?

Sorta non rave related material follows,   but today I put in
a good days work for my boss on the E. Coast.   I sat at my friends
table,   hacked out a considerable amount of code and even kept
the compiler from gagging.   Now I got a well fed compiler...:-)

Took my first walk around Sydney... Currently am in the Darlinghurst
area,  and walked around the botanical gardens,  gawking on all the
beautiful birds,  and strange animals.   No Kangeroos yet,  as those
are found in the bush,  far from the city.    I found a great gym
only a block away from where I'm staying.

At night,  they have huge bats flying overhead.   Wing spans about
same as eagles.    Strange!!   There are so many tiney little
differences...   But the one that really throws me is they
drive on the LEFT side of the road.   I just got to remember to
look RIGHT when I cross the street  :-)

Weather here is same as Hawaii...  Rains a lot,  humid,  very
warm nights.    This last sunday,  they just got off of Daylight
savings time.  Now,  they are 18 hours AHEAD of Calif time.
That means,  I go out raving 18 hours sooner....  Drool drool!! :-)

I met Simon Rumble,  who is a great person.   Him and Michael Dagn
are really dedicated AusRavers,  and remind me of Brian Behlendorf
and the other SFRavers.    People here are so polite...  Very layed
back.    There is a very large Gay scene here,  and it's definately
MAINSTREAM and very acceptable by almost everyone.   Even the 
mainstream TV commercials depict Gay lifestyles...

Food here is absolutly great.    Lots of Italian restaurants around
here,  foccacia very popular and inexpensive.   Also,  there are many
coffee shops.   Slight differences... Radio shack = Tandy,   
Burger king = Hungry Jacks...

After my workout tommorrow,  I plan on exploring the Kings Cross area
to check things out over there.   It's a short walk from here.

TV here sux just like American TV,  but more British programs.   A
british program "Bottom" is quite popular here.

One other thing,  my best friend Aaron and Craig are now on internet
but have problems joining sfraves,  although just before I left,
I mailed my request to majordomo@hyperreal.com to subscribe,  but
no sfrave mail at this time.   The address is:  nebula@netcom.com
and I telnetted in to see if they got it,  but none yet.   Would
whoever maintains this list check into this?   I did get mail
back,  saying that the request was sucessful,

Telnetting here is Slow...  So I'm having all mail forwarded to
crunch@sysx.apana.org.au so I won't have to telnet.  Probably
helps reduce net bandwidth anyway.

As soon as I get payed,  I might sign up with a commercial provider
for a backup.

Tommorrow (Tues),  I'm to be interviewed on a radio show.  Then
on Wednesday I'll be meeting the Clan Analogue crew.   I'll report
on them after I meet them at the Bently pub on Wednesday.

Anyway Enuff for now,   just tell me how Basics was pleeze... Where
was it?

Hmmm!  It'll be interesting to recieve the sfraves calander on Fridays
instead of Thursday.

Anyway,  nuff from Down Under...

Cheers,  73's and other types of goodbys...

Thank you for posting this Susan.  That fog has always annoyed my lungs.  If
I want fog, I'll go outside, but that chemical fake fog crap is pretty tough
to take.

     Hello Folks,
     
     Well, another --greeeatt-- Wicked passed us by this last weekend, and 
     here IMHO is the report card:
     
     VENUE:C+           To me the basement of DV8 just doesnt do it! Its a  
                        tad too crowded and the low ceiling isnt as       
                        conducive to the great open air feel of warehouses 
                        or the other clubs. Security seemed to be nice 
                        though.
     
     ORGANISATION:A+    Very clear instructions on the Wicked line.. as 
                        well as a very cool DV8 dude who kept telling 
                        everyone, " This line is for Wicked only!" This 
                        kind of stuff helps, as my worst nightmare wouldve 
                        been ending up at Release....
      
     MUSIC:A+           WoW! Ive been to better overall Wickeds, but this 
                        Saturday's had the BEST (wOWzOWIEzOKNKERS) and very 
                        consistent music sets from all the dj's. Markie got 
                        it pumped up early, and then Jeno and Garth kept if 
                        flyin'!!! And of course only as Thomas can, bump 
                        and grind funk, house, and jeez .. even reggae      
                        closed out the musical extravaganza at 7:30.... 
                        Definitely a great dancing night!
     
     VIBE:A             Ive been to Wickeds with a better vibe.. but then 
                        this is totally comparative, because even a Wicked 
                        with a good vibe is AMAZING! Overall, the smiley 
                        happy people were again in great abundance! 
     
     All in all, it was just another great Wicked! As always, YMMHV ( your 
     mileage may have varied.. :) ). Rave on folks! Hope Basics was fun 
     too...
     
     (: blinky blinky off :)

Subject: Brief non-music review of Wicked; and then some
Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

A bunch of SF Ravers gathered at Hamberger Mary's prior to Wicked.  It was
a great way to start bringing this really special community feeling outside
the clubs and into the world.  The best part was seeing the same people
later at Wicked and sharing a special smile and hug that says "I like you
even when we aren't dancing with Evelyn."  ;^)  It's something we all
agreed should be done more often, maybe for F&F Equinox,,,

Wicked seems to attract great people and this time was no exception.  Lots
of smiles and unsolicited hugs being spread around.  The music was just as
great, but I'll pass the baton onto to a more exprienced critic for that
review.

The only negative was, as Sy posted:

VENUE:C+           To me the basement of DV8 just doesn't do it! It's a  
                        tad too crowded and the low ceiling isnt as       
                        conducive to the great open air feel of warehouses 
                        or the other clubs. Security seemed to be nice 
                        though.

I agree.  To add to the crowdiness, the military-style mesh netting
hindered movement around the floor even more.  Not to cap on the promoters
and/or set designers, but in a limited space, the netting only limited it
even more.

Remember people: tip your DJs with a smile, a hug, a tip of the hat, a wink
or a primal scream.

Thanks all!

Tony@Xinet

P.S. Bonus question of the night (10 pts.):  Who was the freak dancing in
the cow-pattern pajamas?  "I'll have what he ordered..."

P.P.S.  To Dan who wants to move here to be part of the scene:  Strike a
decision based upon equal parts emotion, logic, feasability, and reckless
abandon.

P.P.S.  Fog machines only make a stuffy room stuffier; I'm willing to
sacrifice enhanced visuals for breathable air.

I'm done.  (Whew!)

I couldn't drag myself way out to Basics on Saturday, but I did 
manage to get to Wicked.  I would agree with the previous posts 
about the location.... too low a ceiling in the basement of DV8 
makes it stuffy.  That space also attracts a very "clubby" crowd.  
Despite these two negative points (I guess the second one might be positive 
for some people) I had a great time.  The music was much more 
house than the acid/trance I've been hearing lately.... good for a 
change, but I'll be looking foreward to hearing Carlos rip it up 
again.   									

Peace and love,
Andrew

Greetings from Vangroovey...

I was wondering if anyone could e-mail me a description, account, or info
on the rave that was busted up in SF this New Years.

Also, can you identify a SF DJ that played in Seattle this weekend. He was
kinda short, asain, neck-length parted bobbed haircut... spun a mix of
house and trance. Your choices are: John Howard, Harry Who, Liquid, or Matt
Mau.

And finally, can anyone tell me how I can get myself one of Brad's tapes up
here?

thanks,
lar

I'll preface my review with the obvious for you peace and love
folks ... this is All my opinion


basics
why the hell did I drive to Vallejo? (ethan)
was this the most boring party I've ever been to?

Drugs - I was offered drugs a dozen + times.  Out near the parking
lot I was flyered and offered E.  When I ignored him.  IN A RAISED VOICE
he offered me the drugs again AS I WAS WALKING AWAY.  This ridiculous
kind of indiscretion Only happens to me at 18 and over or all age 
parties.  This is the same party that had the cops at their map
point in the fall??

Beggars - Some guy was begging for his charity near the ticket window.
He gives me a sticker with some clever slogan like "looking for the eternal
buzz" (I ran home a slapped that witty refrain on my fridge ...) and
then this clueless guy Doesn't Take NO NO NO NO NO for an answer.  
Salvation army santas and sf homeless are universally more
polite than this joker was.

Chairs - there were no chairs.  no carpets.  no benches.  only cold
cement floors.  for $15 fucking dollars they could have thrown some patio
furniture into a little cafe-like lounge area.  how about umbrellas, candles,
ashtrays, or maybe some flowers?  This was not a damn warehouse breakin
or outside summer freebie.  This was a big budget basics.  My weary
fucking ass no longer considers cement a fun place to chill.

Space - I wanted room and a change of pace from the city clubs.  It
was a great big fairground exhibition hall.  Maybe 2/3's of it was
partitioned into the dance area.  Lots of Generic Uninspired Cliched
visuals.  A laser.  Too many black lights.  The only places to dance and
at the same time escape from the boring/annoying (blck lights) visual effects
were way off near the Bathrooms or equally high traffic spots.

People - were really into Sitting Down in the middle of the dance floor.
there were cool beautiful clever fun people at this party.  they were 
out-numbered 10 to 1 by surburban kids.  Further annoying moment -  
some guy comes up and shines two flashlights in my eyes.  i plead
guilty to thinking this was fun in third grade.  he coulda asked
first.  i don't blow smoke into people's faces just to get there
reaction ...

NO SUSTAINED ENERGY or DANCING
spun threw on a few rave anthems that got everyone cheering like
a rock concert encore - i have no problem with excitement over a song
you really like - the excitement, unfortunately, lasted only as long
as the song.

For those of us who were torn between Wicked and Basics, and decided upon
Wicked, we're itching to know about Basics.

The silence leads us to believe that either it was SO GOOD you're all still
there, or it got busted and you're all in jail and can't post.  If it's the
former, I'll quit right now and join you, and if it's the later, I guess we
should start rounding up bail money...

Inquiring ravers want to know...

Sounds like Matt Mau.

Assuming you're referring to Brad of Mother Earth Sound System, you can 
get his latest, "Basstrip Gaia" as well as any other MESS DJ tapes by 
contacting me, Scottie, and arranging for me to mail it to you.  We 
haven't really done any mail order stuff before, and prices are 
definitely negotiable...$8 for one and $14 for two, we'll take care 
of postage.  If you'd like to send a check straight off, my mailing 
address is 2545 Hillegass Ave. #33, Berkeley, CA 94704.

While speaking of Brad, props are in order for his rockin' set at Basics 
last Saturday...ditto that for Ethan...and much respect and "thank you" to 
Martin for giving this local talent the exposure it deserves!!!  Keep it 
fresh!


Peace + respect,

Of course, if you're talking about Brad, that could also be the man like
Brad Vachal, of Portland.  He's got tapes available at Platinum Records
(503/222-9166, 115 SW Ash).  His choons choices tend toward the slower

Hi,
Just a quck note [to fulfil a promise,actually:)] to say that
the dj Jeff from sacremento  at the party last friday at 
16th and folsom was really cool, and enthusiastic and made us
dance like crazy. It was a very good feeling, since there werent
a lot of people around, and so there was ample space. It
was very nice of him to continue playing, although it seemed
as though the organizers were waiting to close down. 
He kept playing, almost for an hour after that and enthusiastically; 
and although I am not well versed in the genres of music, 
and the titles of the albums, the beat was something that I 
enjoyed dancing to, and i think he deserves a larger audience.
So if you see him listed again, check him out.:)
and with that,
thats the end of this praise letter:)
regards,
-harsh

Hello all friendly SF-ravers,
 
	A Grande Hello from Van-Land!

I've been lurking about this list for a few weeks now and seeing as I'll 
be in San Fran in two days I'd really like to hook up with some of you 
(seeing as I know no one, am coming alone and have never been to the 
Mecca that is San Francisco).  I received the calander, but as I 'm 
unfamiliar, for the most part, with promoters I don't really know what to 
expect or find.  (hint hint advice greatly appreciated :)).  
	This little nw-raver is sure lookin' forward to hooking up with 
some sfravers for the next week.  

Big hugs and :)'s

monika

Although some of the previously mentioned things were true,
there were too many people sitting in the middle of the floor,
there wasn't a real ambient room, a few other things maybe that
weren't perfect, I have to say that I didn't really care.
I had one of the most amazing experiences of my life at this party.
The lighting and sound system was perfect for creating a mood of
simply exploring the music and your friends without so much of the crap 
that goes around at most raves.  The music was almost all beautiful,
and I found certain pockets of energy in the room where we were really 
dancing harder and with more intensity than I ever have before.
I never stopped dancing and kept meeting people and getting such
smiles out of them the likes you see once on a blue moon.
So, if you were looking for entertainment, maybe this rave wasn't
all that entertaining.  But if you were looking to dance and
take yourself to new heights through the beauty of the music and
people's energy... well this party did that for me much more than
any has for a long while.

still grinning like you wouldn't beleive...
-john.

See everyone at Harmony next friday.

Dear All;

	I sent a letter to Dave & Valimir appolloizing for not being able 
to spend more time with them at Basics, because I was doing massage. When 
I do massage on people, my client is the most important perosn in the 
world to me for the time my hands are upon them. Dave sent me back some 
really cool suggestions on how I should setup my massage space at events, 
additions welcomed. I just thought they were sooo cool I had to share them 
with you.

Hi Brian

I liked your setup.  I'll just guess your financial situation is
similar to mine so maybe you are limited in what you can bring but
here is what I imagine - 

a nice big carpet
a chair or two (confortable ones)
a small table with a lamp on it
maybe some magazines
some kind of standing doctor's office looking curtain
wall behind ya - does that one make sense?
a nice frame for your certificate (try thrift store)

REally go for broke.  Make it a full "set".  A trippy space that'll
draw people to watch and hang out.  More of this is desperately needed
at big parties like Basics.  Of course, it wouldn't really work too well
at some of the clubbier city parties.

What kind of "crap" are you refering to?
I can't imagine any type of shit that wasn't piled to the fucking
roof at this party.  I don't say this to take away from anyone's
experience.  And I met a few really nice folks there.  But it
strikes me really Clearly that I've been to some VERY GOOD 
and VERY LOUSY parties lately.  Like there is no grey

I'll definitely havta disagree with the previous post about Basics.  
Basics, although not absolutely spectacular, waz really good.  It was in 
this huge indoor space in Vallejo which was quite a drive from San jose.  
The decorations were pretty cool (the banners) but were all really close 
together which left most of the area in emptiness.  The muzik was 
awesome!! especially Tony's set.  Tony just ripped everything apart.  
Although most of the people I saw were dancing constantly through the 
whole party, everyone seemed to go completely wild when Tony was on.  
when he played Rythm Construction even people who had been sitting down 
jumped up and went crazy.  The vibe was really good.  Lots, and lots of 
friendly people.  Free Water!!  
	right, behind the dj, there were these red lights that made a 
verical line but if you shook your head from side to side, these lights 
would make different picture! Wow!  how do they do that??
overall, i had a really good time at basics (because of the vibe, and the 
incredible muzik!) but I do agree that they could have spent some $$ on 
making the space look better or to bring us something new and unexpected.

Hey all!

Just thought I'd throw this out there.  How about setting up a way of meeting each other at Organic.  Either by location or by having a way of identifying ourselves.  I, for one, would love to meet all of you!  Will someone second my motion?

Any ideas?

Love and Peace

Getting to grips with the Politically Correct hug

By Sean O'Neill

THE "non-threatening hug" was demonstrated yesterday at a workshop at
the Green Party conference. Instead of the full frontal embrace, which the
party regards as menacing and sexually predatory, the Green hug is altogether
more gentle and supportive. A how-to-hug leaflet will follow for those who
could not attend the Weston-super-Mare workshop.

The initial touch should be applied to the shoulders or the middle of the back
- definitely not to the waist (too sexual) or the head (too patronising).

Next, an arm is placed around the shoulders, applied only from the side. It may
be enhanced by a light yet affectionate squeeze. The final phase is the embrace
from the front without the bodies touching. Arms should be placed around
shoulders "rather like a pair of Greek dancers".

Mr David Taylor, 37, the Greens' principal speaker, said: "We Greens are quite
touchy-feely types. But because you go to a Green Party conference it doesn't
mean you want to be hugged all the time. The idea was to deal in a somewhat
light-hearted way with quite a serious issue: one related to sexual
harassment."

Mr Taylor, director of an adult education centre, said: "There is nothing more
threatening to a woman than when a strange man leans over while she's sitting
down, kisses her, pats her on the head and touches her hand in her lap.

"Even a conventional hug can be seen as an invasion or sexually oppressive."

Mr Taylor, one of 70 Green men now instructed in correct hugging methods, said
the training would come in useful in an increasingly physical Britain.

"The English are becoming more tactile generally. There's a lot more kissing
going on."

The politically correct hug was choreographed by Ms Miriam Kennet, 35, an
engineer and member of the party's executive.

She said: "Hugs are meant to be compassionate, not passionate. Basically, it's
not right-on to invade another person's space during a hug. Many men are
totally oblivious to the fact that women are being threatening by what they
simply see as a greeting."

Ms Kennet said the bear hug favoured by world leaders was "uncomfortable and
overbearing", while the traditional handshake was far too formal.

"If the hug is done correctly it's the most incredible feeling. A Green hug is
saying: 'We are working together and I want to support you and I want you to
support me'." Ms Kennet added that men who hugged incorrectly could end up
feeling "lonely, confused and rejected" if a woman reacted negatively to their
embrace.

Basics was, well passable.... 
It was held at the Vallejo Fairgrounds. It was $15 and there was one 
room, which immediately dissapointed me. Anything $10 and over and I 
think you deserve a chill space. For the most part it was hard, cold 
cement, although they did have one section of carpet and some pillows. 
The sound was not too hot, being too boomy(space not conducive to sound 
quality) and in my opinion, slightly underpowered. Visuals get an A+ 
however, as they had a laser setup in addition to a few screens with 
stuff running. I was also not impressed with the DJ'ing(man I am sounding 
down on this....) There seemed to be a lot of cut mixing, letting a song 
run it's course, before putting something else on. This made for a choppy 
vibe as nothing really flowed much. They did have free water, and 
inexpensive juice. About the biggest plus there was, was the availability 
and quality of the party accoutremount.... :)

All in all I have been to better BASICS, and feel that maybe I shouldn't 
have been so lazy and drove the extra 30 min to Wicked.

        I think that when it comes to a choice as big as this one you must
follow your own intuition and everything will work out alright.  I had a
very similar experience in my life. In fact it is a tremendous coincidence.
I to was part of a fraternity, in fact it was Lamda Chi Alpha.  I was
going to school in Ft. Collins, co. which is about two hours north of
Denver.  Anyways, I visited the East Bay and realized I was living in a
fantasy world. I just decided to move, to get away and allow a change in
myself.  That was about two years ago and since that time I have
experienced much change and personal growth. I think you were quite lucky
to have discovered raves before you ended up in the emotional wasteland of
a Fraternity.
        As far as measuring how your decision will affect you in the "real
world" I think that you must decide what is real, the love you feel at a
rave or getting a job.  Don't let your fears dictate your choice. I know
this is a bit fragmented, but I hope you are able to understand it.
Love,
GABE

Subject: Detroit PD wants to abolish Detroit Parties (please read)
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I still haven't gotten all the details yet, but Saturday night's party at
1515 Broadway (originally scheduled for 1315) was busted _hard_.  Everyone
there was ticketed: adults for "loitering", minors for violating curfew.
The cops apparently forced everyone to the floor, searched everyone, asked
for ID, the whole third world police state trip.

We weren't there -- having read the silly scare piece in the Detroit News
the week before, we figured that the PD would pick this weekend to make a
big "show of force", and unfortunately we were right.

Channel 7 cameras were there as the bust took place, which indicates to me
that the PD had this planned as a media event from the very beginning.
The clip I saw showed officers with _guns drawn_ ordering people to the
floor.  The report on the 11PM news of course followed the city's party
line to the letter: "this was an unsafe, overcrowded building, we found
drugs there", etc.  They _did_ mention however, that no alcohol was found,
which makes the idea that they busted it because it was an illegal "blind
pig" very suspect.  The cop on the news said "This organization is very
mobile -- they moved the party from another location down the street
earlier in the day to avoid us, but we found them anyway."  Ha -- this
organization, as if party goers and organizers are some sort of sinister
Mafia-like cabal with a planning hierarchy and structure...  whatever.

The other comments by the cops only confirmed how truly clueless they are
about the whole thing: how the parties were a "new phenomenon" they were
going to put a stop to, and how they were something for "out of towners"
(neglecting to mention, of course, how many of the DJ's and musicians
live and work in the city.

In a nutshell, thanks to a rash of sensational press coverage, the city
is coming down with both jackboots on _your right_ to freely assemble and
dance to the music of your choice outside of a club environment.  I'm
going to get contact information later for officials at city hall and
police headquarters so that we can all make our views heard.  If you've
ever attended a party in Detroit, or enjoyed music from a Detroit artist,
you need to speak up to preserve what we've built here.

Show them that there's more to life than busting parties and scarfing down
jelly donuts.

I got a EP from Solid Grooves recently that I really like. The artist
is Wallstar ( Bates/Twichett ) , on the Immortal Records label. The
title is "Shadow Overture E.P.". The cut I really like on it is 
"Shadow Overture" , and the other cuts are good , although with 
different moods. 

 "Shadow Overture" has an ostensibly slow , dubby beat , but the ragin' 
conga/tabla percussion bubbling away over the bass beat kicks the actual
dancing rythmn way up in the BPMs! Add a grand yet simple melodic line and
atmospheric twitterings that sound like a gossipy audio oscillator on
speed. 

 So - can the musically knowlegible out there recommend similar 
tribal/trancey/trippy tunes I could hunt for?

Greetings!

First off, many thanks to all of you came to hear me, I *really* appreciate
the support; helped out a lot too...  I played one of my better sets ever.
I'm remastering the tape and adding some material to the back side (it's
110 minutes :), so look for it at ameba and primal soon :)

All in all I have to confess to being fairly disappointed in the party as
well. My main gripe was the sound; it was totally insufficient for the
space and, while passable standing directly in front of the dj, was
absolutely atrocious throughout the bulk of the building. And yes, I have
to agree, $15 with no chill space is really a bit much especially when most
areas sounded as bad as they did.

Really I think the space was just too big (spacially and fiscally) for a
basics and hence got skimped on a bit. When the gathering was there they
used a *much* bigger sound system (plenty :) and had a chill space, but
then again that night, the whole place (everywhere) was packed...

However, after spending every day since December 17th trying to find the
right space for Friends & Family, and only having just done so, I'm
prepared to be a little bit more forgiving than I might otherwise be;
finding spaces, especailly 18+ spaces (let alone all ages!), is an absolute
fucking nightmare these days... and, when it comes right down to it, few
people are really willing to take on the risk and the effort associated
with trying to pull this shit off... which doesn't mean we shouldn't hold
them to the highest of standards and judge them, harshly if need be, on
their merits but, all that aside, I'm glad people are at least throwing
parties; many people did have a great time; I saw the smiles on their faces
:)

I would also encourage everyone to let promoters know how you feel about
their parties. Give em a call... rant, rave, call it like it is. Honest
feedback is *really* important; I certainly welcome it, and I'm sure martin
does as well.

take it easy

Well after 2 hours of contract negotiations last night, we do have a deal,
though I gotta tell ya, I'm really fucking tired of arguing with people
that want to sell water; this deal almost fell through on that issue.

So, as it stands, they will sell "premium" chilled water, juices etc. *and*
we will provide free water at tables immediately adjacent to their "bars"
one upstairs, one downstairs...

Bust-wise, if we were to get shut down before midnight we'd pay $500,
by 2am, $1000, after 2:30 am the whole amount; to quote Lamont, "I'm not
renting you the space by the hour..."

Though really I'm not too worried about getting shut down.

On the good side, they are hoping to have the all the junk downstairs
cleared for us and maybe even a new paint job; they're moving the gallery
to that room :)

So, that's the news... I hope it's palatable enough to everyone; I did the
absolute best I could.

Take heed of his warning. I know of one person who was just a bit
careless on the dosage, and ended up having a horrible 7 hour out of
control terror trip. Not only can too much induce nausea, it can
qualititavely modify the experience in very bad ways.

Read about it. Start slow, with conservative dosages.

Apricot? I guess that would suck.

Artificial fog is cool, especially when laser beams go through it :).
Glycerine based fog isn't too bad as long as it's used lightly, and
with breaks. And of course it can exacerbate an allergy attack, like
cigarette smoke and 100,000 other things.  I feel that (a) that's
tough; if you don't like it, leave, and (2) venues with fog machines
should have that fact posted ahead of the cashier.

Hi, I'm a student at the University of California at Santa Cruz.  I'm an 
anthropology/psychology major and the opportunity has come up for me to 
do an ethnography on the culture (or sub-culture) of my choice.  I 
figured what better choice than rave culture.  It's got music, it's got 
dancing, its got ecstacic trance, it's got community, all the makings of 
a tribal culture with a few technological twists.  Most of all though, it 
sends some of the most positive messages you can find in today's world.  
With that in mind I was wondering if a few sfravers (especially those who 
rave for the reasons above) might answer a few of the following questions 
(as briefly as you want) and e-mail them to me.  

1. A few general statements about why you like to rave.

2. Comments on the relationship between rave culture and technology.

3. Is the music the most important aspect of the culture?  What do you 
like about techno and other electronic music?

4. How important are the drugs for promoting the rave vibe?

5. The rave culture is very different from the hippie culture of the 60s 
(though many philosophies are the same).  Any contrasts/comparisons 
(especially the apolitical nature of rave culture).

6. What changes has the movement gone through since you've been part of 
it?  What are the effects of commercialization?

7. Do some raves have more of an ego vibe than others?  Is there a sharp 
distinction between the underground movement and the popular/commercial 
scene?

8. Where is the movement heading?  Will it survive or will it die when 
the music and fashion inevitably changes (like the hippies)?

9. Anything else you'd like to add?


Thanx and blessings  in advance to all any/all who reply.  I'm 
mazlo@cats.ucsc.edu

Unity is the key,

mazlo

I have some experience with safety issues concerning disco fog because of a
stage production I did.  We wanted to put a person in a large burlap sack
with a fog machine (picture a large amoeba shape wandering around the stage
emitting plumes of smoke).  A safety mask was required because of the
concentration levels of the stuff within the sack...

I don't think that the concentration levels of disco fog at a club are going
to be a health concern, unless of course you go right up to the spigot and
take a huge disco fog bong hit.  I haven't tried this yet.  I guess though
that there are probably some people out there who would be naturally
allergic to it.

Remember, don't hog that spigot, mango. Pass it around.

Geez Sean, that seems a little harsh considering fog is just to enhance
visuals.  To say, "that's tough; if you don't like it, leave..." just
doesn't seem very conducive to the culture we're trying to promote.  In
fact it sounds like something a bouncer might say upstairs at DV8, or maybe
the Sound Factory.  I mean, without the people, Sean, you're standing alone
in an empty room with no music...think about it...

Wondering if maybe the fog machines can be turned off after a certain point
in the night, like when the place gets packed,

Tony @ Xinet

I sell fog machines and used to have asthma problems.

I probably use a fog machine as much in an 8 hour day of work as they
did at the three year gathering at the armoury in three hours(mind you,
I work five days a week.)

I'm no worse for the wear, but the only thing you have to be concerned
about is the old oil based foggers. they suck. the new alcohol and
glycerin based ones are safe with a minimum amount of clean DRY air.
they make different size foggers for different size occasions. If
promoters or the visual personell heed to this specifications, then no
one should suffer from these machines.

my comment about dry air was that the fog produced be machines will
condense water at a lower temp than normal. This condensation will enter
the lungs and cause a simular reaction to a mild asthma attack. The
problem can be solved simply by drinking some water and holding your
breath for 15 seconds or so(this will cause the water in your lungs to
heat to body temperature and evaporate when you exhale).

        If I answer do I get a copy of your paper?  I'm sure you'll get 
answers from other people more into the scene, but it really interests me...

> 1. A few general statements about why you like to rave.

        intense experience, positive vibe, good music

> 2. Comments on the relationship between rave culture and technology.

        acceptance...  sometimes even love.  I don't think it goes as far
into worship as rock&roll though.

> 3. Is the music the most important aspect of the culture?  What do you 
> like about techno and other electronic music?

        the music is the focus but there is much more to the culture.
Take away the PLUR (peave love unity respect) and the culture would be
gone.

        I like the music because it explores new ground, and is more
purely musical than most other modern music.  and of course the rhythms
are good for you.  Also the relationship between the DJ and the crowd
can really amplify the energy (the best techno is mixed live).

> 4. How important are the drugs for promoting the rave vibe?

        drugs are a form of technology, and are accepted just like
the music, visuals and environment/space.  moderate use of alcohol is
pretty important though I think.  Also I think there are many other
drugs which reduce the vibe (the harsh ones and the other downers).
We all know which ones enhance the experience (used properly).

> 5. The rave culture is very different from the hippie culture of the 60s 
> (though many philosophies are the same).  Any contrasts/comparisons 
> (especially the apolitical nature of rave culture).

        I think the fundamental idea of personal freedom is the same.
I don't think all hippies were/are political; on the contrary most reject
politics per se (is rejecting politics a political act?).  Another hippie
stereotype is rejection of technology; even thats not so straightforward
though -- I think the "hippie ideal" involves "appropriate technology".

        Check into the evolving relationship between the Rainbow tribe
and the ravers.  Also, the Deadheads.  Look for ravers in tie-die.

> 6. What changes has the movement gone through since you've been part of 
> it?  What are the effects of commercialization?

        I havent been in it long or deeply but it does have to deal with
more commercialism now.  It's being handled well elsewhere in the world
though...  its almost mainstream in Europe for example, and the music is
popular in latin america.  I'd even say the primary (native) culture in
many parts of the world is rave-like.  the USA's puritanism still causes
problems, especially combined with greed (unscrupulous promoters).

> 7. Do some raves have more of an ego vibe than others?  Is there a sharp 
> distinction between the underground movement and the popular/commercial 
> scene?

        the club/bar scene is different from the rave scene.  more trendiness,
less freedom in club types.  no two parties are alike though, and some clubs
can be cool.  This is obvious, right???

> 8. Where is the movement heading?  Will it survive or will it die when 
> the music and fashion inevitably changes (like the hippies)?

        hippies are still alive (rainbow for instance, also look around santa
cruz).  ecstatic dance has been around for millennia.  part of the rave
is pagan, or at least not fundamental "christian" (I think the original
christianity was co-opted by power-hungry assholes)....  so I'd say there
has been a little fad in some parts of the world for the last 2000 years
which has devalued ecstatic dance, but we're getting over it.
Civilization can survive without oppressive religions...

        I can't wait to party off-planet (in orbit, not with the aliens
necessarily), and I'll bet most people who choose to go "up there" will
accept technology, and lots will believe in freedom...

Andrew

PS I was going to send this personally, but after typing it all in I thought
        I'd "de-lurk" for a moment...

That wasn't written very well. Let me try and restate:

Venues that use fog machines (or even those that tend to be thick with
cigarette smoke) should be required to state so somewhere before
patrons pay to get in.

At the same time, I don't think all those people who love laser shows
(which need some fog), and industrial shows, which sometimes use tons
of it, should be deprived of it because some people can't tolerate it.
Perhaps a compromise could be worked out so that people who *love* fog
and those who hate it can both get a chance.

Well...I don't exactly know where to start...I decided to post, because I
read the thread about Lurkers...and after the past couple raves I've been to,
I decided I wanted to meet some of the other SFRavers (besides the chance
meetings, when I ask 'are you on SFRaves?', and then when asked if I am...
have to tell them, 'uh...I'm a lurker')... I've been going to raves for about
a year, and I just LOVED them from the first moment...I got on SFRaves at
approximately the same time...have been reading the posts regularly...and
have sometimes felt the urge to post, and yet never did, because usually it
would be an "I agree," and it seems pointless to post things like that.
 Also, I'd never introduced myself (and felt a bit lame at the prospect) <and
yet here I am!>...   And there seems to be a core group who all post and know
one another, so it seems a bit intimidating at times...So, I guess I just
wanted to say "HI",and I would really like to meet some of you, especially
since I KNOW that I am regularly dancing or sitting right next to you-and it
would be so much more fun if I could actually KNOW some of you, and talk to
you!  =)  

As for the person who asked how to get on the BPM mailing list...all you have
to do is call and ask (at least that's what I did).

As for Harmony, I'm so HAPPY because it's RIGHT by where I live (Santa Cruz -
another reason I feel silly posting, I feel there is a sort of <don't get all
offended> animosity (?) towards ravers in Santa Cruz, <maybe just the raves
IN Santa Cruz...I don't know> and I could be wrong, but just some things I've
read....)  and the spot is SOOOOOO Incredible, I really encourage you to go,
if you wanna make the trek down here...

Anyhow...thanks for listening to my blatherings, I'd love to talk to some of
you...
=)

Dear Sfraves;

	I read many fine comments on effects machines, and here's my 2 cents 
worth. I promise to keep it short, and do the doctoral disertation stuff 
that I 'm used to.

	Laser's need fog, people who want to have sex at raves need fog, 
fog doesn't need anything, it works just fine by itself.

	A low wattage laser, the type used in effects, target
aqusition/guildance, super market check lines  ..etc, will if a direct hit 
does occur with the human eye, place a permanet microscopic mark on the 
retina. All milarty(MIL) personnel are required to wear expense gogles to 
either elimiate or minize this undesirable effect of low wattage lasers. 
No one know's whether or not this is harmful to the long term health of 
the eye, it depends on which experts you talk with and they even 
disagree. I'm not advocating going out and staring into one of these 
devices, I suggest you follow your mothers immortal words of wisdom; god 
only gave you two eyes, don't mess with them.

	If you've ever had a direct hit, believe me you are very aware of 
this. You see the brightest thing in your eye next to a nuclear exposion, 
or the second coming of christ.

	As far as fog machines  go, I think these devices are great. I 
don't have any respitory problems though. They provide great cover if you 
are ahhh involved with someone you care about for that moment. Someone 
mentioned the alcohol type, and yes these devices are much easier to use 
than the dry ice machines, what a pain in the ass thoose things are, and 
big and heavy to. 

	So there my 2 cents worth. To save bandwidth yes I used to design
guildance and target aqusition stuff for our goverment. After desert storm
I really couldn't justify what I was doing. We did a great job, keeping
the American death toll down, but destoried over two million of another
race of human beings. I would never tell anyone not to do what I did. But 
for myself I chose not do be a part of that anymore. Saddam deserved 
everything anything he could get, not his people, I just wish he could have 
felt, just a small % of all that firepower.

	I'm for life today, that proably why I'm a raver!!!!!!!

I really like dry ice fog because it stays low to the ground and it feels way 
more neat-o than the other leading brand. Next ambient room I do I want to  
use dry ice and flash powder. Is there anyone out there experienced with safe 
indoor pyrotechnics?

Hello you beautiful people - 

	This is my first time posting so I thought I'd start by saying hi and 
telling you a bit about myself.  My first party was a toon town in March of '92, but I
didn't feel as if I was a part of the scene until a few  months later.  All I remember
was being blissed out dancing freely with not even a trace of my consciousness being
directed at myself (for the first time since I was a child I'm sure).  Suddenly I 
stopped, noticed humdreds of people around me seemingly in a similar state, noticed the 
morning sun and moisture in the air, noticed the water surrounding us (we were on a
peninsula - it was almost an island), noticed an exquisite man with blue hair freaking
out beautifully to the beat, oh yeah the beat... then the music came back into my
reality I began dancing again, looked around one more time, realized I loved everyone 
and suddenly understood that the rave experience was much more than I ever hoped it 
could be.  I left that party feeling as if I was part of something, part of something
more beautiful than I had ever hoped for.  A few months later at Vision (remember this
one?  humongous warehouse, the best music ever, drum circles, thousands of people, 
probably the most amazing vibe I can rememeber) I had another profound, timeless, 
ecstatic, seemingly divine experience.  I won't try to explain this one it was 
completely ineffable, let me say this: I emerged a completely new person and the 2 1/2
years since then have been spent attempting to integrate into my life what was learned
in those few seconds.  This scene has been extremely influential in shaping the person
I am always becoming.  I'd like to thank everyone for making it what it is.  Thanks for      
the memories and I look forward to what the future has in store for us... plenty I'm 
sure.  I mean our scene is looking pretty damn good, don't you think?  It's had it's 
ups n  downs, but here we still are, strong as ever.  And the vibe? yeah the vibes still
here, maybe not as breathtaking and electric as it used to be, but definitely more 
constant, more mature, ya know?  And in this sense it's even more powerful than it used 
to be.  
	Anyway, although I've been a part of the scene for 3 years and have 
had a modem for a year, I've only been on the net for a couple weeks (kinda silly 
huh?).  Maybe you know me.  My name's Sean, I'm from Sac, have long blond hair, fair 
skin, glasses, sideburns, goatee, septum ring, hopefully a smile but you know these
things can't be forced.  Just thought I'd say hi.  I'll be on SFRaves for about 2 weeks
then I'm off to drift around the country for 6 months before returning in September to 
transfer to UCSC.

		Take care, love you, thank you, BE STRONG (it's your choice)
 					
						Sean,	   


P.S. - I'm listening to Break It Down (Garth) and I still get chills!!!!!

Hello all

	I'll be leaving the area for 5 or 6 months in a few weeks to 
wander around the country.  I'll miss the SF scene immensely and am
definitely not ready to say good bye to the rave scene altogether, so 
if you have any info on people or stores I could contact in other 
cities in the US or Canada concerning their local scene, please 
let me know.  Thanks a bunch.

Maybe I wrongly took offence to this but on a post about basics Dave wrote:
"there were cool beautiful clever fun people at this party.  they were
outnumbered 10-1 by suburban kids."

I'm a suburban kid, I know many other "beautiful clever fun people" who are
also from the suburbs.
What I'm getting at is if raving is about peace love unity and respect,
stereotyping people is hardly respect.  Stereotyping is were bad things
begin, which lead to the erosion on unity and peace.  Without those there is
no love, and therefore no philosophy of raving, in other words raves are
useless.
I'm sure Dave didn't mean to insult anyone though.

By the way, thanks to all who gave suggestions for my party.  I'll keep you
all updated :)  See you all at Harmony.
Love Always,
The Elf Queen

Hey Kelly!!!
I'm really glad that you "came out"!!
I don't post that often either.
If you will be attending Friends & Family, I will be there, too. <a big 
hint for all those reading this who will be there as well>
I want to meet all kinds of new people - the more the merrier in my book! :)
Especially some gals - I've noticed that this list is mostly male - which is
*nothing* wrong with that - just an observation.  But I like meeting 
girls, too! :)

See you all on the 18th!
Only 10 more days...yaaa!
luv,
Amy

thanks Lee for the great sleuthing work.  Normally I avoid alt.rave, and
I'm not surprised this showed up there first.

So, is this latest brainstorm from the Zippies supposed to be the Studio 54
of "raves", or what?   <hee hee>

well actually i can imagine several _more_ threatening things to a woman

A good sign that they are getting a lot more E. :)

Not.

Agreed.  I don't mean to belittle a serious issue, but when people
act stupid and say stupid things you have to laugh.

As part of a culture that is filled with hugs and kisses,
i think it's a good idea to pay attention to things like this,
but the goal should be more to be aware of the reactions the
person that you are hugging has than to presume you are oppressing them.

And i don't think it's just a man ---> woman thing cuz i know
i've been hugged much more intimately than i wanted by men & women.

Checked out 1015 on Fri., curious as to how 4 clubs in one would feel. Hmm,
feels kinda oogy. =)  You gotta walk through the disco death chamber to get
to the housier parts and the crowd was a dressed up, feel up kinda crowd.
There was some good music both in the main room and downstairs (until the
water pipe broke). Mostly house, fairly commercial, although Jeno played
some decent stuff. Left before Tracy went on, but heard good things about
her set.

Got to Basics at about 2am on Saturday. First impression - nice visuals,
nice crowd, uh, but about that music, now....Evidently Spun forgot his funk
credentials at home, and I wasn't into what he was playing. Half the crowd
was sitting down in the midst of the dancefloor - looks like some massive
e-wave caused everyone to drop to the floor spontaneously. =) Tony went on
and totally hyped the energy about 300% - you could feel it. He played a
ridiculous acid set. Jon Williams did a good job of keeping everyone going
and Josh finished it up with some decent house. Most surreal moment: Tony
walking by and patting me on the stomach.

It wasn't stupendous, but it was a nice party.

No, its a the first in a series of parallel university edutainment events -
aimed primarily at the those not familier with the rave movement. - like
our parents!!
 The plan is to use this as a petridish for growing wider community support
for fullblown rave orientated Megatripolis Events in May.

Lets cut the class, race and age barriers -

If Sex is what will turn the boomers on - then let it be smartsex chemicals
-which open way to other smarter things. Dan Joy's new book is truly
amazing if you can get past ones own squeamishness with things sexual
By my estimate, SEX (& lower pelvic chakra) is the BOOMERS achilles heel -
and I for one do'nt have a problem with it.

Pro-Sexual = Life-Affirmation

I happen to know Dan Joy. He's somewhat infamous in No. & So Cal fringe 
culture. Though he is a very bright guy and a good person deep down he is 
a bit frayed around the edges. Don't think F+F will have too worry to much 
about the competition :) At least Fraser & Co are trying something 
different. I'm all for diversity.

Hmmm... Other than seeing friends there, I thought Spuns set was the only
good thing. He's pretty much dropped out most of that familiar
hip-hop/brakbeat Spun sound we were used to in favor of realy good house &
acid, which realy shows off his skills. In my opinion he's the *only*
dj thats consistantly realy good nowadays, he blows all the other guys
lame house sets out the box. Tonys set was cheese compared to Jason (imho). Oh
well, different strokes for different folks, I just couldn't bare to hear
my favorite dj get ripped. :)

This is not a flame, but I find the above statement a bit presumptuous
considering that Fraser & friends so far haven't been able to generate
much support for their rave vision from the current rave community here.

I agree.  But when ambiguity is used as a tool for manipulation, people
sometimes get resentful.

Really? Which community are you talking about  the rave-elite?
Fraser is one of the few voices arguing for a broader rave culture.

Idea is that humans are ambiguous creatures at best, which also explains
the paranoid backbiting that sparked here way before fraser even arrived in
America as well as the personal mistakes and random chaos that shadowed
some of the Zippy Events. But the mote in your eye phrase keeps coming to
mind. What I would really like to know is this: are you really arguing that
this is all just an attempt at manipulation, an evil conspiracy?

Really?  When I spoke to Fraser at the first SF Megatripolis, and mentioned
the possibility of bringing out some Detroit DJ's, his response was along
the lines of "No thanks, we only spin trance, hard trance".  How broad is
that?

Dear All;

	My 2 cents for the human body, good stuff so far, like Leni saids 
Ya Gotta Let Love Rule!!!!!!!, AMEN. As far as it being in their 
achillies, you may have been more right than you expected. According to 
Eastern Medical practice with reference to foot reflexology, the sexual 
organs or simulation there of though massage is located at the achillies 
heel, or cal-kae-eous region or the foot, or bootom of foot for those lay 
persons. Beware of a person who wants to give you a foot massage, they 
may have more in mine that just rubbing your feet.

Well, I suppose fraser should really answer this one, but I'll give you my
2cents anyway

your gripe sounds like its really just an issue about choosing the
appropriate tools and not a question of  width of culture.
- pose the question to yourself as a raver organisor- should we bring in a
couple of rock n' roll bands? or likewise bring in some Detroit DJs? etc
etc

If you were trying to achieve a group trance dance with limited space and
trying to introduce a music form that had not received much coverage
wouldn't your priority be to get the appropriate music onto the dance floor
first. THEN tackle the question of whether or not to have ambient, gabber,
jungle etc areas ie in an expanding  party?

Good news is that Fraser should be online soon to answer all these
intriguing questions

If sfravers will allow him to voice his point of view without dumping
parental-rebellion shit all over him first?? lets expand rave rights to the
very young (as a recent long thread concluded )as well as the very old or
are the over-30 year olds still the Enemy? lets ask Bob Dylon to answer
this one.

Dear Sfraves;

	In a previous post, I mentioned Anti-Laser Goggles. If anyone 
knows of a really good Army Navy store in the Bay area I would appreiate 
hearing about it. Thesae goggles are really cool to wear as sunglasses, 
protect you from laser light, and look really cool, a little trendy 
perhaps but cool none the less.

	Also, when I lived in Florida there was this Army Navy store that 
had Fighter Piolet Helmets for sale, they were like $400. I was hopeing 
to find one out here cheaper so I could wear it to raves, preferablly 
with the O2 bottle so I can rig up a N2O hook up. I know I'm sick, but 
when you have as many initalls after your name as I do, you have to find 
neat and challeging ways to burn brain cells. If all else fails I have a 
friend in the milatary who's coming to work at the Nation Langaage 
Defense Center, so I thing I will be able to get one from him. THe 
helmets are sooo cool, and I can't thing of a better purpose for a device 
thats designed to enable death and desuction to be turned into a device 
that getsyou high.

	So if anyone knows of a really good army navy store please let me 
know. Thanks!!!! :)

To which David replied:

I'm talking about the SF Bay Area ravers, the people who actully go to 
raves and to varying degrees perpetuate the so called rave culture.  Most 
ravers that I know ended up not supporting supporting whatever it was 
that the Zippies claimed to represent.  After the 1st freebee, 
Megatripolis failed to attract Bay Area ravers to their party.  Other
attempts by the Zippies to promote their ideas were met with derision
in this and other forums, for whatever reasons.

Personally, I like a lot of what Fraser Clark has to say.  But ultimately,
what good are words if you can't get people to act on them?  He couldn't
promote harmony amongst his own Zippies, Megatripolis flopped, and
now you tell us that he's going to entice our parents with sex to get
them to attend upcoming Megatripolis parties with us.  As cynical as I
am sounding here, I really do like many of the ideals that Fraser spews.  
I even think (perhaps in ignorance) that he is sincere and not just on an
ongoing self-promotional campaign.  But he just doesn't seem to know how to
get in touch with the actual, living, breathing rave culture that already 
exists here.  

Raving isn't about helping subculture celebrities sell their books 
(though I find nothing wrong that).  It's about coming out of yourself
to share and connect through music and dance.  Fraser promotes himself
as "zippy extraordinaire", but I have found that most of the people
who really understand what our community is all about are all the 
*ordinary* folks who have managed to generate an amazingly unambiguous 
vibe for quite a few years now.

Apologies to SFRaves for resurrecting this debate.  Hopefully, Megetripolis
will get it right when they come back in May.  In the meantime, Janie & I 
are looking forward to dancing with some of you at Ultrasonic, and of 
course, at Family & Friends on the 18th.

I agree .. but this seems merely cutting open the bag and letting the

Lee, speak for yourself - or does living on the left coast also mean
risking a lynch mob. There is no such thing as "them" or "they" there is
only YOU YOU YOU. So speak for yourself or join the Youth for Joy.

I suppose putting on a totally free event for 3000 people doesnt account

Judge Jury and Executioner all roled into one - come on "for whatever

We have no leaders, Lee - in fact most of the so-called zippies had not

So, in your utopia, I do'nt get to have my fifteen minutes of fame? Well,
lee come and join my version of Utopia, where everyone gets to be a Sincere

But he just doesn't seem to know how to

Probably, frasers no spring chicken and america is as different from
England as Mars is to Venus.

Why not? - Why can't I combine both -selling a book (esp. one that helps
our alternative culture) and raving, or is this another crime - thou shalt
not make a living and party at the same time ( like my mother told me, -
can't have my cake and..... etc) I don't buy this.

 It's about coming out of yourself

and when we are not connecting, we'll just carry on dissing as before.
Please add some political perspective to this friendly scene you've just

Sure, but cf my comment on everyone is a star!

It seems that twhat really pisses YOU off is the idea that i and many
others might be infiltrating the little cushy sf"scene"  with a global
perspective - Like woody allen says "I wouldn't want to belong to a club

Well, lee, I hope we can work this out, really!
its awfully depressing to have ones lifework dissed just because you're not
an insider in a small town (like yourself).  As a last word on fraser - I
bumped into an old head from the sixties whose comment was - he's still
sprouting the same stuff after 20 years, at least he's consistant. - Lets
hope we all have some consistancy of idealism and purpose when we are 52.

Excuse me pardon me -- and I'm sure Robert can defend his point much better
than I -- but I was talking with Robert right after the conversation he
mentioned and we were both shaking our heads about the unwillingness to
even consider arrangements to bring in the very people who basically
invented the sonic tools that have evolved into the hard-trance and
faster techno styles.  I mean, we're talkin' *Detroit* here, right?

And certainly there would be logistical and monetary issues involved 
with booking the people Robert knows.  But let's face it, they virtually
never make it to the West Coast except for Richie Hawtin once in a great
while, and we're less rounded musically because of that, I think.  And
after my brief visit to Detroit last summer I'm determined to help 
support what the Detroit DJs and musicians and producers are doing
because many of them really are still truly devoted to the music,
wherever it takes them stylistically. 

But even all this is beside the point.  I want to avoid undue flamage,
but let me make this one point and then get out.  I'm all for diversity
and different types of events, like Chemica Sutra.  There's a pressing
need to develop beyond the two-turntables-mixer-amp-sound-system-and-a-
couple-of-lights type of party.  But I am not interested in buying into
the hype, and ultimately the ego-worship, demanded by Fraser and David
Dei and the other self-proclaimed Zippies.  

As one of my current favorite tracks makes clear, this is about going
*beyond* the ego.

One more thing.  Lest there be any misunderstanding, I am not at all
upset or alarmed that Chemica Sutra and the Friends & Family events
are on the same evening.  Instead, I would encourage those who can
to check them both out.  There was some concern that the December 17
F&F would conflict with the Gathering and Stompy events the same night,
but it turned out fine, all three parties were happenin'.  There is
more than enough room to grow in the SF scene.

I can't speak for anyone else involved in F&F but I rather suspect this
view is widely shared.

thanks for the plug

The thing to remember is that the Parallel University is conceived as an
educational/experimentational/expeditionary  and intimate event  which we
hope to replicate around the bay and geared towards different age and
financial groups - so we anticipate a bigger lower cost event at a later
stage, along with other great topics like Dancing down the System - Theory
to Praxis 101 etc. This is a modular concept that can easily be
incorporated into other events or a Megatripolis Full Blown Rave situation.
Basically we want to push the educational aspect of raving. So I would
reccomend F&F for those who want a full rave, and our event for those
wanting an introduction to Sex Chemicals and other nutrients and so on - I
do'nt see why we cant increase the scene this way, by bringing the
underground into the overground in a way that maintains the essential
life-affirming information.

Lets not get into a flame war over this, but rather concentrate on the
synergy of new angles on a long running theme.

No, because that implies that "hard trance" is superior, or at least 
"more appropriate" than the others, which is silly.  The question is: 
which garners more "respect" and partygoer loyalty - a reliable constant 
dollar for dollar groove or an experimental-yet-always-more-or-less-high
quality party?  Ie., does Fraser see a possibility for ambient nights, or 
for even varying the type of music over the course of the night?  
Robert's quote would tend to indicate not, though one could also say that 
was hearsay.

Basically last summer both he and his ex-compadre Zippies arrived in San 
Francisco amid much fanfare and hope and open minds, and many of the 
people on this were underwhelmed.  If you weren't on SFRaves then, you 
can check the archives at http://hyperreal.com/raves/sf/archives/ (now 
set up with continual updating) for a historical note.  Basically I don't 
think anyone is taking away Fraser's right to say what he wants and plan 
parties and such, but his words haven't quite been translated into action
as effectively as we all had hoped.

Dear Sfraves;

	Please excuse me, I've been living in a media vacumn and am only
vagully familar with Zippies and much less with chemica sutra. So not to
be rude, or ignorant, I'm not angry just curious, with the desire to be
enlitened, and if your going to fill my mail box with this stuff, I would
like some clear background info on these topics, like what is the and are
zippies, are they a political group, what do they stand for ..etc. Or if 
you could point me to a source that I could obtain this information on my 
own that would be cool to, also include info on chemica sutra, which 
sound kinda interesting. Ok, again not angry just curious, anyone can 
respond, and I ask that you post publically because I'm sure their are 
other out there with the same ?'s. Thanks :), enquireing minds want to know.

	I agree that Harmony is at an awesome location!  Words just can't 
describe how cool it actually is.  I am definitely going, and would love 
to meet you and any other sfravers planning to attend.  

	For those of you that are hesitant to go because it is so far 
from San Francisco, let me assure you that it will not be a trip made for 
nothing.  The location is wonderful, and the people putting the rave on 
are only interested in spreading the love through raving.  All that's 
needed now is a bunch of ravers with open hearts and minds, and this 
thing will be wonderful!  Hope to see everyone there =)

Ahh!!  Here I am,  Keeping track of TWO rave scenes, 12,000 KM apart
from each other --  Neato...  

And I have a few comments to make Re: Zippies/ Frazer and the lot...

It may sound like I may be defending Frazer,   but let me speak my
peace....  Here we have a group of British dudz,  supossedly making
a tour to the USA,  and they're no doubt not that familiar with the
American scene,  let alone the SF Scene.    I'm experiencing this
right now,  here in Australia.   Although I'm taking a somewhat
different approach with my entry into the Australian scene.

When Frazer and crew left for the USA,   there probably was little
effort on their part to try and understand our scene before they made
their trek...  Probably due to the lack of Internet connectivity they
had before they left.   For instance,  Frazer didn't subscribe to
SFRaves 6 months before coming to USA to get a flavor of our scene.

I cannot emphasize the importance of trying to understand a local
scene before making an entry into it.    For me,  it was a godscend..

I found out about the Australian scene through alt.rave,  and I've
always wanted to learn more about Australia,  so I joined the AusRaves
mailing list 6 months BEFORE coming over here.    At first,  I studied
their calander of events,   and read with such relish their rave reports
to get a flavor of what it's like.   After that,  I started asking questions
about the scene,  and got to know the promenent people like Simon Rumble,
Michael Dagn (Maintainer of the Ausraves calander) etc.

Never hearing a single note of the types of music until Grant brought
over a tape of Green Achrs,  did I ever know what their music was all about.

Now I do....ONLY after actually coming over here to exerience a real Australian
rave for the very first time.   I got to say,  I like the music over here
MUCH BETTER than in the SF scene.   There is FAR MORE variaty in music,
and the format for the music is very logcally layed out to promote
really good vibe and dancing environment

First,  they usually start off with medium speed (140 -150  bpm trance), for
several hours,  then up the energy level with Happy Hard core (160 - 180 bpm)
range.   Then around 5 am or so,  they slow things down to Housey sounds and
the more familiar tunes the SFRavers are used to.    This kind of variaty
is really great....  It serves all types of ravers,  from the slower housey
types to the faster harder types.  I think it's long overdue for the SF Scene
to start doing something like that,  but not necessarily copying the Aussies.

Then,  along comes Frazer...  and Jupiter bash...   with the faster harder
trance from Goa Gil and others.....   At first,  I didn't really like the
faster stuff,  and wasn't really secure about dancing to it.   But being
a little new to dancing,  I ADAPTED by experimenting with newer dance
movements to keep up with the faster pace.  As a result,  I feel comfortable
with anything from Acid Jazz (Remember Boogie Buffet?) all the way up to
Gabber (240+ BPM).

SF mainstram scene has aways been sorta housey..  Now this year,  we're
finding a LOT more variaty,  check out Atomicon!!   They are really great!
Lots of variaty,  but I think their format could use some improvement.
For instance,  my first Atomicon ended with Gabber...  I think they should
either start off with Gabber and work into Hard trance,  and end with House..

These are my opinions,   but it makes sense.   After 5 - 8 hours of dancing
the faster stuff,   lowering the BPMs towards the end,  keeps the people
on the dance floor,  because people are tired by that time and prefer the
Fatter and slower housy stuff.

When Megatripolus opened up at the Troc,   one of the things I really
dug was the variaty...   At first,  it was housey,  then acid trance from
Goa,  followed by Hardcore,  then back to house.   I think it was very well
formatted, and the decision to have the first Megatripolus be FREE,  
certainly throws away ANY ideas I had that Frazer was into greed and
commercialism.  After that,  they charged a reasonable $10 door charge.  

And now....  remember Santa Cruz...   By about that time,  Angus/Pinkus
crew sort of had a falling out with Frazer.  Don't know the details,
but things for the Zippies really started to fall apart.   Remember 
Pinkus's speach "By definition..  blah blah!!".   I really was'nt
that happy to hear him ranting and raving about such drival shit...
where he literally took the microphone away from Fraser.   There was much
disagreement among them,   and their un-familiarity with our scene AND
anti-commercialism we ALL have,  has marked the zippies as highly commercial
and self serving.   But,  the publicity of their coming to the Bay area
has turned off a lot of SFRavers,  mostly in part to this publicity
and apparent commercialism.

The other thing was the interruption of the dancing,  which is typical
for UK events.    Here,  thats just not done.   Again,  it was his
unfamiliarity with how we do things here.    For me,  I find it quite
annoying to have the music interrupted when my head space is into dancing.

I met Frazer at the Wyoming Rainbow gathering for the very first time.  He
didn't know me from diddly squat... But it became very clear how dedicated
to the scene I was,  as I pumped an amazing amount of energy into my
dancing (Mostly to keep warm in the below freezing evening).

   As we sat by the fire in the freezing cold Wyoming morning and I 
briefed frazer on our scene here in the SF area.    He had already 
chosen SF as one of his points on the tour,  so I did my very best to 
brief him on our scene.   I told him about the SfRavers,  Friends
and Family parties,  and briefed him in on our mainstream events
like Wicked,   and Martin O' Brian productions like BASICS,  VISION,
etc.    Unfortunately,  Fraser had little control over Angus and 
Pinkus and the others.  At least these were my impressions.   We 
really clicked with each other.  We are essentially the same age (51),  
renigades from the 60's and the "Love generation" but seperated by 
8000 miles.

Dispite the closeness of our modern global society,  distances STILL play
a large part in making differences in our respective scenes.  I'm finding
this out here in Australia.   I find MANY similarities,  but there 
are also many differences.

At any rate,   lets give Frazer a fair shake and as soon as he gets on the
nets,  invite him into OUR scene,  and let him know in no uncertain terms
what *WE* like (Luv,  togetherness,  and happyness) and dislike (greed,
commercialism, and bad press).  That way,  we can all get along together.

Re:  sex on the internet....  C'm on you people,  lets not give our
legislators any more reasons to put tighter controls on our freedom
of speech...  We are already getting more than we bargained for with
this Exon crap....!!

Nuff said...   (As he places the asbestus flame barrior in anticiption
for the inevitable flamage...)

One other thing.... I know that F&F is coming up soon,  and it may be
too late to get him to spin,   but I highly recommend DJ Mars to be placed
in the lineup.   I think that David Minuk (davidmin@crl.com) knows the
person that knows Mars.  Mars spun at Atomicon,  and his energy is highly
worthey of F&F and vice versa.

About a year before his death Abe Lincoln wrote in a D.C. newspaper


"A hypocrite nevr learns respect, especially of ones self. If he
hypocrisizes about the most important fundamentals of our new
America(ie: freedom of speech, freedom of opinion((especially the
freedom to let OTHERS voice their opinion)) right to bear arms, freedom
of ASSEMBLY) he becomes worse then those who oppress us, because he
himself doesn't beleive in those fudamentals. If all of those who see
his hypocracy can show him truth, then the hypocrite becomes an
American. Americans are no better in any form but to that wich they can
honestly say they beleive in their own heart"

I had this quote here in my computer when I did an english paper in
college.

What I'm trying to say is that sometimes we uorselves can easily become
this hypocrite because we ourselves sometimes feel like the world is
against us.

I think that Mega-Tripolis sounds great in any respective if it can
allow one of those hypocrites(boomers) to see truth in a rave culture.
Everyone here talks about unity, but as someone mentioned earlier in
another message,"is that a stereo-type"
                                       (ie:BOOMER,SUB-BURB KIDS)
Remember that we don't care about stereo types. Ask Amy Starkey. She
knows me and she knows that I don't care if there are ten "GANG-BANGERS"
walking around the GATHERING. I go right up to them and introduce myself
to them. I want everyone to be part of this so called rave culture. I
wouldn't worry about getting mugged at the ATM, or dodging bullets while
in the inner city. I would be more concerned about how I'm gonna set up
sound this friday at common ground here in Sac.

Let's not loose grips on why we started raving. If you beleive it was to
dance or to do drugs in mass quanities, why even metion love, peace,
unity, togetherness, or VIBE. I've only been in the seen for a little
over a year. Don't see this message as a new kid on the block thing.
Because I do sound for 90% of the gigs here in Sac. I've talked to a lot
of the old timers, and they all say the same thing,"It's all about the
people."

in reply to crunch's post:
yes, the megatripolis crew started off with a free event, which was all 
well and good and i had a great time, but $10 for a weekly is far too 
steep for me and most of my friends... (not all of us have lots of extra 
cash laying around for toys and parties)... and at the troc?!  the only 
way i'd use that space is if i could lock all their security in the 
closet with a quarter of poisoned crank (those boys need rehab - as well 
as an attitude adjustment!!!)

peace and love and all that ;)

my reference to "shit" or your reference to "fuckers"?

Well.. my humble apologies David in not taking your sensitivities into account.
Please allow me to rephrase the "line of shit" sentence more succinctly:

Do *you* really believe that this is an attempt to get ravers` "parents"
into the rave scene? Or..are you just brainwashed?

Please let us "call a spade a spade". This is a commercial venture. And,
believe me, I have no problem with that. I wish it success. However, 
it is indeed a far stretch of the imagination to state that this is an
attempt to involve parents in the rave scene. Naturally, I have the greatest
admiration for *your* ability to make that stretch, being that I, personally,
am not that competent.

warmest personal regards

brian

Personally, I'm thrilled that, in addition to dream, there will be another
event in SF that night; two parties are not nearly enough to accomodate the
hordes of twisted and equinoctially enthused ravers I expect to manifest
that evening :)

this one.

Well, I'm not Bob Dylon but I am 30 and I can tell you that I've gotten strange looks from the "average" raver.  They look at my friends and I as if we're strange for being at a rave.  The  EXPECTATION of younger ravers is that people over 25 or 26 SHOULD be conservative.  It seems that it is their EXPECTATION that we should be the enemy.  But I can tell you from personal experience that the over 25 crowd is almost without exception the one group at a rave that is there for the SOLE purpose of being with friends, dancing, and promoting a sense of community.  I don't know about you, but I havn'
t seen too many over 25vers posturing or scamming or walking around with "fuck-you" attitudes.  Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying that anyone under 25 is doing the above, but it is from that group that the negative elements spring.

Every once and a while, a "kid" between the ages of 16-19 comes up to me and asks me my age. When I tell them they are surprised thinking I was old but not that old.  Then they smile and say, "Man, when I'm your age I hope I'm still raving."
Me too.

Stamp out prejudice of EVERY kind.

Love and Peace

I'm glad to see I'm not the only geriatric raver out there.  I'm 36 and I'm
definitely in the upper age range of most of the events I go to.  But this
is what I would have been doing if they had these 10-15 years ago.  Back
then, if you wanted to get out and dance, the only thing available was the
vibeless meat-market club scene.  The closest thing I had was when all my
buddies and I would skip school and go out and build a fire in the woods 
and sit around partying and watching out for cops.

Kids today don't know how lucky they are.  Why when I was a kid we had to
walk 10 miles in the snow, barefoot, uphill both ways to go to a rave.

The Zippies could have been one of many perspectives in S.F. , a city in 
which all things live forever.Unfortunately conquering S.F. as part of a 
grand sceme to conquer all of rave/hippydom backfired. 
Our city sometimes seems behind the times to outside visitors, but the truth is, 
we are not desperate for the next big thing. Better Luck next time.

San Francisco is the only city in which you *will* walk uphill both ways to
get to a rave!

But, you know what, I wouldn't want to be anywhere else... ;^}

Dear Greg;

	Your not alone, I'm 32, age is only a statement of the mind. 
Captain Crunch is 51, so don't feel bad. Every scene needs wisdom, this 
is were we come in, I know so much more than I did when I was in my 20's.
Am aslo able to deal and look at things with not so urgent of a 
perspective. Everything takes caree of itself in the long run. I don't 
miss those days of desparation, coupled without my wisdom that I have 
today. I chose to still live on the edge today, but today I wear a 
parachute :)!!!!!!!. Also to quote Judas Priest's "you don't have to be 
old to be wise", just to be fair.

You know what the most amusing and peeving thing anyone ever said to me was?

Early last year we were at Warehouse Jam here in van. b.c. and for some
reason the subject of age came up.  I said something about not wanting to
turn 25 and this guy asked "well how old are you?"  I said "24" and he said
"wow, it's so cool that you're still partying at your age."

ERCKLE!!!!!!!

oh well . . . now i'm turning 26 on the 15th and that all seems so long ago
. . .

later

peace

I seem to remember that Tribal Funk used to be all about creating an
alternative to those $20 parties.  I could dig out the fliers over Spring
Break and check but I'm pretty sure.  This must not be the same people it
started out to be.  This pricing doesn't quite cut it as an alternative to
$20 parties.  Not to bag on Tribal Funk but maybe there is some merit to
changing your name if you are going to change your principles or ideals...

When I was true "raver age" I used to go to the original discos...:)
all dressed in cool polyester (mmmm... ) shoulder length hair and 
sideburns below my ear lobes (hey...they're back in fashion now:) 
The dj would play a tune.. THEN tell u what it was!
"And that was Donna Summers with xxxxx. And now for a slow song for those lovers out there.." 
("shit.... Im still trying to get laid for the first time...whats this love crap?")
'course that was in Ireland...a good catholic cuntree!

We didn't know that we could dance without a girl... really!!... no-one told
us... 'course the girls could dance without boys.. they went to the nuns
school and had different teachers, I guess the nuns told them it was safer too!

Cool!  I used to have a dark blue polyester leisure suit - at least
it was made by Levi's  :)  And my Dad made me buy it for a job
interview - my preferred attire was blue jeans and flannel shirts.

Seriously though, I was a raver with no place to go.  I remember
getting high and dancing alone to my Gary Neuman / Flock of Seagulls
records and tripping in 1975 while listening to Brian Eno, the inventor
of ambient music.  I wasn't like all the other kids.

Aren't you jumping to conclusions here a bit?  Why not ask the Tribal
Funk people (who are here) whether their principles have changed?
At the very least, it seems to me a weekend-long party might *cost* more
than a single-night one to put on.

Not really jumping to conclusions just posing some serious questions
(IMHO).  I might add that I think you are confusing Tribal Funk and Tribal
Future that same weekend.  I got no hint that the Tribal Funk party would
last for more than one night from the post or the calendar while it was
clear that Tribal Future will go on for two days.  I just have some pretty
strong feelings about people in our scene saying one thing and then
changing their mind under the same guise, I feel it is kind of like false
advertising...if someone doesn't find out it's $20 after 12am and they go
with $15 thinking that Tribal Funk doesn't charge $20 for a rave then they
are screwed...I'm not upset but I think we need to make people accountable
for what they say.

peace and love drenalin

ps it would be great if someone from Tribal Funk would stand up and speak
for themselves if they are on this list, in fact I would expect it if they
are reading.

yeah, 20 iz a bit much for a party but it iz *only* after midnite.  why 
not arrive early??  also, TF has always been cool about their time. last 
time at the cow palace, they stamped peoples hands in line so even if ya 
got to the casheir after, the said time, ya could still get a discount.  
Also, i wouldn't say that TF iz goin' back on their word. over time TF 
has been throwin' lots of parties. this iz the fourth big one but most of 
them have been small and extremely inexpensive events. in fact, a whole 
lot of them were free. unfortunately, TF iz not yet big enuff to draw the 
*huge* crowds (like funky techno, gathering etc,) so they can't afford to 
have really low prices at their big events.  when TF throws one of their 
big parties, they put * a lot* into it.  in fact, they've managed to lose 
money (lots of money) at all of their big parties.  basically, i'm just 
tryin' to say that if ya wanna provide people with a big quality party, 
ya gotta get the money from somewhere.
late....

To those of you that complain about not having enough in your mail box to 
read here is my response to Jeremy Rhoten's survey.  Enjoy!

Hi jeremy, here you go-_

>1. A few general statements about why you like to rave.

1.  I like to rave to hear the original music, meet a wide variety of 
people and most of all to expand my mind.  Its also a great form of 
entertainment.  I especially like raves because they are so far from the 
idea of Keg parties which I never have really liked.  Sure you find 
people with attitudes but the majority of true genuine ravers are 
extremely cool people.  They don't judge you on looks, mannerisms, the 
way you dance, the way you were your hair.  I imagine some people judge 
others at raves but generally anything goes.  At first I felt really out 
of place at raves but soon realized that I wasn't.  Anybody can attend, I 
mean anybody, the important thing to realize is what they are about.  They 
are not about finding some member of the opposite sex to have sex with, 
as some of my friends seem to think, they are not about doing a shit load 
of drugs, as many parents, including my father think, they are about 
getting back to the basics, to reaching that astral plane, chemically 
induced or not, that allows you to see people, that are also in the search 
for a feeling of connectedness with either the universe, other people, or 
themselves.

>2. Comments on the relationship between rave culture and technology.

2.  First of all let me tell you that there is an extremely good book 
that talks specifically abou this.  It is called "Cyberia" I forgot who 
it was by but if you are interested it has some very very very very 
relative stuff to say about technology in regards to rave culture.
The rave culture has virtually been around since the beginnig or 
civilization if you look at from the perspective of what it hopes to 
achieve.  Rave culture is in essance a religion.  Once you commit 
yourself to the ideals that raves perpetuate you can't forget about 
them.  The drugs are a part of the technology just like the music.  The 
Technology allows us to reach a "temporary" state of euphoria.  the 
lights, the defeaning music, the smoke, are all ways to physically create 
this artificial euphoria.  And it is "artificial" and "temporary" 
if it is viewed as lasting only as long as the party lasts and the music 
keeps pumping and the peolple still have any physical energy left.

>3. Is the music the most important aspect of the culture?  What do you 
>like about techno and other electronic music?

3. I have a very interesting view on electronic music.  Hear let me give 
you an example that will put it into better perspective for you. My friends 
and I were getting pretty high one night and I decided to play some 
decent european stuff.  A little ambient and some faster stuff.  They had 
never been to a rave and had no reference for what the music was supposed 
to do for them.  They complained that it was created with artificial 
instruments,i.e., synthizers, sequencers, turntables, etc.. They said 
they wanted to hear stuff made with natural instrumrents.  You know 
instruments like guitars, drums, etc.  Well I told them that was fine 
because I knew they had never experienced what true techno induced.  It 
is a mantra.  A way of shutting out the world.  The volume, the hard 
hitting repetitive beat doesn't allow room to really sing or think about 
anything.  When I listen to techno ,house, any of that stuff, My body 
moves, my mind doesn't get filled with images.  I feel emotions but I 
don't feel sad or happy just there at that moment much like what any good 
yogi attempts to achieve.
The only thing that I think about when I am really into the music and not 
at rave is being at that rave and dancing with all those people.  it 
brings me back to that feeling of unity but emptimindedness that I 
experienc there.  Just look at a raver in serious dance.  That's what he 
is doing. Dancing, he not thinking about his the fight he had with his 
girlfriend or the job that controls his life.  
	My friends didn't understand the music.  The instruments are 
nature.  We as humans are a part of nature just like any other aspect of 
nature.  Our  consciousness about ourselves as beings on earth balances all 
the beings,ie plants animals on the 
planet, universe, whatever, that are not conscious of thier own exixtence. 
	Techno only manipulates music to take us to higher states. Just 
as the instruments have been a manipulation of technology to create 
advanced sounds and rythm, "real" authentic techno, not club muscic, 
allows us to relate to higher states of mind that take us back to that 
part of us inside that needs no satisfaction, confirmation, or 
possession, it just lets us be there now at that moment in time alive and 
living, a celebration of life at a higher level.  This can be 
accomplished with or without the drugs. I have done it with both.  They 
are equally as cool.
>4. How are important are the drugs for promoting the vibe?

4.  The drugs can do a number of things.  It depends on what you take.  
If you are talking about MDMA I will relate my experience.  This drugs 
closes off that part of my brain that says, hey that person is wierd, hey 
that person is ugly, hey that person is a dork, hey that person is 
stupid. It silences that prejudice that is inherent in the pysical 
manifestation of the human brain.  They don't call it exctasy for 
nothing.  If you truly understand the experience that it can induce you 
see that this state of mind is possible to be achieved.  Its just that 
since the time we where born we have been trained to have all these labels 
and 
attach them to people as we see them with our eyes not with our spirit.  
some people take X and don't change, they virtually stay the same way 
when they are sober.  They haven't taped into that part of them that 
loves unconditionally.  
	The very bad side of X is the dependancy factor that I believe 
can result and you end up needing the drug to feel this way all the time.
Just a serious reminder.......These are purly my opinions, they are 
obviously not facts that I know of or that have been researched and proven.
>5.The rave culture is very different from the hippie culture of the 60s
>(though many philosophies are the same). Any contrasts/comparisons
>(especially the apolitical nature of rave culture).

5.  Rave Culture like the 60's
	People are on a search for happiness and connectedness to 
something higher than what is possible in day to day society, at least in 
Western Society.  Different drugs but same idea,  free love, respect, 
freedom from presumed athority, e.g. the government their bosses, the 
realities of life.
 
Differences...
The music, dancing by yourself and not being considered wierd, more advanced 
equipment for simulating euphoria, Ie lazers, some cool electronic 
visuals , ambient music, although the sixties did have some trippy shit!   
>What changes has the movement gone through since you've been part of it? 
>What are the effects of commercialization? 
6.  Have not been part of the 
movement long enough to really see an 
evolution occur in the rave scene.  Although I do have one thing to say
I saw an article on "Christian Raves".  This is kinda of a strang idea 
because the rave was ofcourse drug free. which is good but I'm not sure 
exactly what kind of music was played.  I do think that this also was a 
little out of the true rave ideal in that it established a theme to the 
dance.  The religion Christianity has a lot associated both good and bad.
But raves are a place where nothing matters in context to preconcieved 
ideas.  Raves allow you become primordal.  Like I said to get back to 
that emptiness and find whatever you want. I really don't think they 
should have any connection to any one type of association.  Be it racial, 
ethiical, religious etc, you just dance....

>7.  Do some raves have more of an ego vibe than others? Is there a sharp 
>distintiction between the underground movement and the popular/commercial 
>scene?  
	I can't say that I know that much about the commercial scene 
because I am not old enough.  I do know that I went to tiajuanna one time 
with some friends to some discotechs.  I am not knocking that scene or 
any thing but I really hated it. I honsestly don't think that the have 
even heard of a "vibe" in many commercial esatblishments.........I dunno, 
thats my assesment....

>8.  Where is the movement heading? Will it Survive or will it die when 
>the music and fashion inevitably changes (like the hippies)?

Well as far as I can tell many fashions are established at raves.  It 
will probably evolve just like any other fashion.
As far as the music goes aren't Jimi hendrix, The Doors, 
still listened to and followed to day in a certain respect.  If those 
guys were still around people would go to their concerts.  I don't see 
the entire population of the rave culture disappearing so someone will be 
making music and someone will be listening to it.  People will stay in 
the scene for life and many will be involved in the rave scene as a part 
of their life cycle only being envolved for a while.

>9.Anything else you'd like to add?
	That's  all folks!

Peace Dan :)

I just got into my office from the lab,
what a miserable day it is out there,
and much to my surprise,
a message awaited me on the phone,
I surely thought it yet another request to do more work,
but instead it was an injection of high energy house
music.

Thanks to that lovely individual who was thoughtful
enough to think of me this AM.

Ron.

actually, in 60's/early 70's Brazil, the equivalent of amerika's "never
trust anyone over 30" was "nunca confie em alguem com mais de 32 dentes"

trans::never trust anyone with more than 32 teeth

Certainly a better indicator than age!

So, does this mean the upcoming show in March is SF is being performed by
an imposter, cashing in on BDP's name?

The flyer is advertised as "The black dog", not "Black Dog Productions".

I know the event is being promoted by Reflective Records, Clear, and the
Ambient Jungle (SF).

Any comments?  I'd like to not show support for somebody trying to cash in
on another band's name, but I'd really like to see Spacetime, Single Cell
Orchestra, and Velocette anyways.  Ethical dilemma, hmmm.

Looks to me like the Black Dog are having a little fun with us. Plaid is 
merely the name under which two of the 3 (4?) members record. Look at 'Bytes.' 
See all the Plaid tracks?

 I'm 40 , and I know exactly what you mean! I did my freedom dancing at rock
shows , and singles bars were a poor alternative if there wasn't a good
group playing. I was in my teens and low twenties during the first disco 
age , but I didn't like it - I was a "rockist" then , and was disdainful of
disco *. I still hate stupid brainless metronome beats , unless they're 
accompanied with some mindbending harmony/atmospherics. Hard tribal and
acid trance is my preference now ( at least that's what I think the music
styles are called (!) ).. 

 ( * On the other hand , I did like Donna Summer's "I Feel Love" )

 I wish HARMONY all the luck - with this weather , they'll need it. The
last message on the phone line said that it was somewhere on Highway 
9 between San Jose and Santa Cruz. The ambient room is suppost to have
a creek running through it - I hope the room's still there!

 I will probably chicken out , unless a weather miracle occurs. The 
phone message said that a new message with directions would be on the
answering machine at 5PM.

I will *probably* be going to Harmony tonight and I'll have space for
one or two (no more!) people in my car.  I'm in mid-peninsula, so I
can't go to SF or E. Bay, but if someone in my area wants to go, email
me soon with your phone #.

I'll probably leave here between 8 and 10 and stay late.

oops, I forgot to offer an alternate route for those die hards 
who ARE going! 

Try 101 south to 152 West into Watsonville. Then take 
Hwy 1 North. From here you'll still need updated status about 
Hwy 9, but you might be able to get through. 

Turn on that grandma driving style!

Well, Harmony is definitely cancelled for tonite.  :(

I just called the info-line and they say all the roads are closed or
too dangerous to drive on.

Too bad - I was really looking forward to it - hope you all find somewhere
else to have a good time.

Just because a bunch of Acid heads can run a few good parties in England, 
that glorious land where money and skill of organization comes second 
place to having a good time.  And that was the problem was it not?  They 
all made loads of money and thought: "We are much more ahead musiccally 
then those pesky yanks; lets go over their and we will go down really 
well.  Wrong!  Once the novilty wore off the cold hard facts was that 
they had not got what it takes to keep it going.  What ever one might say 
about Wicked or Community these were paerties started by and still run by 
British people and they are still going strong.  In England, the music 
played at raves here would send your average British raver to sleep so 
the scene here is very different to how it is here.  Britisah people who 
come over here liek the scene because it is different to London.  But the 
Zippies thought that they could just replicate the scene from London to 
SF and they were wrong.
As regurards Frazer he is a totally cool person who has never done of 
said anything more then he has lived up to.  His integrety and respect 
that he deserves is boundless.  It was all the other people on the 
original Zippy tour that fucked it all up.  That's what happens if you go 
on the road with dope fiends!  I hope that Frazer can continue to do what 
he was doing in London: bringing forward the philosophical side of rave 
culture to the fore-ground.  He is in a good position to do this too 
because un-like other's he has not lossed it mentally and, as he is 
intouch with young people on a daily basis, he has not lost touch with 
reality or forgotton the main purpose behind his mission.  I whish him 
all the luck in the future.

8th house was Super Freaky Drug art Fashion techno party last night.
Probably the most far-out so far.My favorite part was Das(big city orchestra) 
playing records not slid down the spindle, but wobbling on top. 

Russian river Tribal Future may be postponed due to campsite flooding.

Next Friday is looking ominous. Black Dog, xogenix, Brothers and 
Sisters, and a wicked full-moon.

And then Saturday there is that party with the purple and yellow flyer with 
the cog/smiley face on it.

my entree into the august forum of sfraves shall be by way of a general
confession and attonement before you all.  and it's thanks to kevin that
I'm here and now free to admit that maybe I/we *did* somewhat overexactly
focus on a particular london form of a Thing (the Rave Spirit?) that in
fact has an infintie number of possible forms within it, all of which we
shall see over the last years of this millennium..
in other words, that I *did* try too hard to repeat what we were doing over
there in megatripolis.london without enough attention and sensitivity to
adapting it to the local conditions.

but there's no sense being too smarmy. for I fear that my mission for at
least the next few months will be to play the intitially unpopular raver
conspirator / cheerleader -coach and ancient marinerto help you see the
Mote in Thine Own Eye and the sheer throobing aching need for you to
ACCELERATE NOW BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE,  so I'd better move on sharpish to
any of a hundred other opinions on this subject, this comparison of the
cultures, that you won't at first like nearly so much.

like, for example, and offered purely as a possible Talking P0oint for
everyone, I'd generalise that, nevertheless, Sf goes for party (AND THERES
NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT)  but the zippytrance evnt is more like a group
conspiracy to apply certain scientific shamanic technologies (repetitive
beats, synched lights, UV future strangeness etc) to bootstrap the whole
group to the next evolutionary level.  DISCUSS.

As a general answer to some of kevins post, the zippy meme, as actually
evolved and currently being lived by real people (many long before I ever
verbalised the re-paradigmed lifestyle) was not and is not a quickbrew
instant fad whipped together by me and a few mates to make a fast buck over
the summer and then disapear.  that's how it's supposed to work over here
and it does except that , ONCE OR TWICE in a generation's lifetime a new
wave comes along that smashes all those habitual patterns aside.

the zippy thing started a good half dozen years ago and definitely does not
dissipate with a few early blows, or a certain level of criticism.  by the
time this sumer gets rolling most people will rightly remember the things
that *were* achieved last year and can become the markers for starting this
year, and will start to forget what *didn't happen*

and thanks, kevin, for the vote of confidence.  all I can add is this:  I
AIN:T NO SAINT - you have been legally warned.

and, finally for now, my first apperance before you all, I must correct the
impression kevin gives that "all the others" fucked it all up.  there were
very honorable exceptions,  and we just were not in a numerical majority
after I decided to make the pronia zippy tour a collective.

exceptions are ZANA, a great spirit and heart and back for now in england
with her brood of 3 daughters.  RONNIE, who filmed the whole crazy tour
from megatripolis london to the end of megatripolis west.  MICHAEL JOHN of
the american rainbow family who worked with me in megalondon and on the
tour from start to finish and through into mega west.  and KATE.  and GABE

Dear Sfraves;

	I went to Harmony lastnight unfortuately before all the bad news 
appeared on the internet. Yes I ran into a 2 mile long backup due to 17 
being closed at 9. So I then tried 9 to attempt to get to this event, am 
I a die hard or what.

	I'm from the East Coast and things like mud slides and nonstop
rain, well we don't have those things back east. Well here I am, me, my
Cherokee, 808 State on da box pumpin, and this mountain on 9(a place were
I've never been before), where I'm now stuck both ways due to these
wonderful and exciting mud slides you guys have out here. But it was
really cool, I was moving and so was the mountain, so we were in Harmony
together pun intented.

	Well I finally got off the mountain and made it to Harmony only to
find the electricty out and no one around, argh!!!!!. So I paged Greg and
he told me the unfortuate news. So here I am wired on the most non-drug
energy I've ever been wired on, a mountain coming down around my ears,
with nothing else to do, and what do I do. I go to Greg's house party that
he just invited me to in San Jose, who said theirs no god. 

	I then loaded up the Jeep with some party stuff left at the 
place, and went on my way to San Jose, through more mud slides and fallen 
trees. Well anyone who said that the people in San Jose don't have a good 
vibe and a lot of love are full of shit!!!! I had been on some of the 
worst road conditions I've ever seen, and I'm coming from ice storm land 
folks, and by the time I reached the party I had been on the road for 6 
hours. I was welcomed with a couple of great hugs, warm smiles, and that 
beautiful love vibe that pur-me-ates this bay area. After I decompressed 
from da road, I setup my massage table on an exchange basis, you give me 
10 and I'll give you 10, and had a great time the rest of da night, with 
pleasent raver dreams......

  Simply put...it's the funnest thing to do. The people, the music, and 
the real reason we're here...the people make the party, those humble 
servants or cosmic guides who partake in the vibe are dreaming and working 
at the same time. Bliss is capable at many levels. Positivity. Some of 
my  real friends were, for the first time in their lives , happy and 
accepted completely as individuals. As simple as  agreeing on the 
changing textures of the cliffside, something to build on.

An intriguing prop...global unity in that that common vibe happening all

  Not the most important, the people make the party, but the driving

Smiles everyone for many more safe journeys. The music is the shit, as

 Anybody could say there first party was a CoolWorld...It was in this

 The scene, no matter where evolves according to multiple major set of 
actions. I only know the San Francisco. Sharing can hurt at times but we 
learn, and try to give an example for the next group of swing tings.

I will have a new set of SFR buttons @ FF6, so if U don't have it, be there.

If U have an idea for a new logo and U can draw it or print it, U can make
the button yourself, I'll bring some empty one.

Otherwise I'll print more of my SFR/Peace sign (but I really don't have time to
choose better colors ): 

If U wan't to know how it does look like, check the Hyperreal archive.
I don't remember the right path, but there should be a file called SFR94.gif
or something like that in a 'image' directory.

So, see U next Sat,

	Raffaele

I think the idea of any one person or group saying they are attempting to 
"bootstrap..."  is rubbish. In order to move "a group to the next 
evolutionary level" you are claiming knowledge of what that level is, which
has a tendancy to make one sound very self-important. Any scenes "level"
is created by the members of it. It is not the other way around, and I for
one bristle at the idea that anyone claims knowledge of what particular
direction it should go, and that I need to be spoon-fed that direction.
Personally, I don't think the "scene" is, or has ever been about sex. It 
is about love, and/or friendship with people from a variety of different 
backgrounds, without regards to sex,age,color, the way you dress, etc... The 
truly equal opportunity "scene." If this were not the case, the "underground
" would have degenerated into a bunch of gangbangers looking for chicks 
on E to fuck, which I have seen happen to much of the "commericial" or easily
accessible scene.

Again, that is your lifestyle. Live it and relish in it if it works for 
you. I don't think anyone has a problem with that. Do your own thing, but 
I don't think it appropriate for anyone to say that this is the lifestyle 
we should all live. I am not looking for a philosophy or the politics for 
my life, especially from a source of so much enjoyment. Rather be with 
friends and dance than learn what the proper things to do become a card 
carrying "zippie."

This is a prime example of the group creating the vibe, philosophy, or 
actions, and not the other way around. The tour was a result of who was 
attracted to you and or your "cause." If it didn't follow your utopian 
vision, then thems the breaks and welcome to the real world.

I don't understand the necessity of raising any one person to a higher 
status in the group.  It sounds way too cultish, which again is not my 
view of the scene. And if the tour or your project flop(s)(ed) then it 
because not enough people share your views, or feel they need to be 
shown. The impression I get, at least of the San Francisco people, is that 
we are not together to push any one way of life. We get togther to share 
the company of others that love the music and know the rush of a "good 
vibe." Politics , lifestyles and views of "proper" rave culture aside. I, 
and most the people I have come into contact with already know where 
they're at and where there going. Thanks anyways, but I have a philosophy 
for living my life.

                                                   Peace,
                                                    Black Adder

Hey All,

My friend Poppy needs some help with something she stumbled across. I 
hope you can help her out. Please disseminate. Thanks!

Here's what she's got:

WHO'S REALLY RUNNING OUR WORLD?
A campaign organized by the Earth Island Institute

1994 marked the 50th anniversary of the founding of the World Bank and 
the International Monetary Fund, global financial institutions which have 
failed miserably in their goals of promoting global prosperity and 
stability.  

They have needlessly fostered environmental degradation, and 
through their economic "adjustment" programs, have pushed societies to 
cut spending on health care and education in order to repay impossibly 
large debts.  For example, from a UNICEF estimate: "about 500,000 
children die each year from austere conditions (in part imposed by the 
IMF and World Bank)."

Definitely of concern is that our U.S. tax dolllars are going to support 
institutions not open to public scrutiny or citizen input.  We, the 
undersigned, call for a moratorium on funding for the World Bank and the 
IMF until these institutions become democratic and accountable,  and 
promote sustainable and equitable people-centered development.

well, my night at the 8th House turned into quite a tragedy, thanks in 
part to the promoter, the maker of the "funny punch," and a "friend" who 
stupidly od'ed on various substances...

8th House was held at the cat's alley bar & grill, a bar space with a 
dance room in back.  first complaint: not enuf seating in front when we 
got there, and the back room was still closed, and they were showing 
really gory (sp?) films with annoying industrial music.  

i had heard there would be some "funny punch" at the party so i went to 
check it out.  the server estimated that about a cup would be ok to 
drink, and my friends and i stupidly believed him.  
let's just say we got more than we bargained for, so 
we left and took a taxi home.

however, my "friend" had bought a shot of yohimbe from the bar girl, who 
HAD NO CLUE WHAT IT WAS AND THOUGHT IT WAS A SMART DRINK.  not good.  
yohimbe is an MAO-inhibitor, which means that it SHOULD NEVER BE COMBINED 
WITH ANY AMPHETAMINE-TYPE DRUG, or food with aged protein, which includes 
mdma, cheese, beer, wine, pickled herrings, snails, chicken livers, yeast 
products, figs, raisins, pickles, sauerkraut, coffee, chocolate, soy 
sauce, cream and yogurt, not to mention speed, acid (i guess), etc.  our 
friend had had two ephedras and a chocolate chip cookie, as well as 
punch.  yikes.

(btw, asevereoverdose heightens the blood pressure and can lead to 
pulmonary edema, circulatory collapse, or intracranial hemorrhage.  info. 
from *Psychedelic Shamanism*, by Jim De Korne.)

so we got home and he began sweating, getting the chills, babbling 
incoherently and twitching.  he then started freaking out, becoming 
paranoid, overly sexual (yohimbe is an aphrodisiac), and violent.  we 
called a friend to help, but b4 he arrived our od-man stripped naked and 
tried to run out into the street several times and we had to restrain 
him, and at one point he trampled on my foot and broke a bone.  we calmed 
him down and got him lots of water and bananas, which helped and he is 
ok.  HOWEVER,  i am hobbling around with a cane and in pain and i don't 
know when i'll be able to dance again or even walk very far.  

so, the moral of the story is: don't take funny punch at parties, even if 
you know the person serving it, unless you are sure of how much of 
whatever is in it;  do not take yohimbe unless you have researched it, 
and never serve yohimbe at parties.  philip infinity (the promoter of 8th 
House) was totally irresponsible to have served it without any warning or 
instructions, and he will be called on it.  

i really believe that more damage could have been done (for instance, had 
he been a violent person he could have attempted to rape me), and in a 
way i'm "lucky" to have escaped with "only" a broken foot.

Okay okay; point taken about the fact that raves over here are muxh more 
concerned with making fast buck then they are in England.  But explain 
some thing to me.  I was envolved, for two years, with a sound system 
that nobody had ever heard of yet we would a minum of 1500 people on a 
week end and we were the prime catalysts in organizing the Castle MOrton 
festival which was, with out a doubt, the biggest free rave in te 
histotry of the planet.  It was, of course, all free some we made up from 
it from selling sweeties: enough to be able to expand the sound system, 
sought every one out, and have a lot of money left over for ourselves.  
Was it not the same for Megatripolis?  Remember, your speaking to an acid 
dealer from way back (fnaar, fnaar, fnaar!).  I hope so because that is 
the way it should be.
Incidently, have you not noticed the fact that their are very few 
Scottish people over here compared to English or Londoner's?  "Every where 
you go, always take the weather with you."(?)
But if only you had been their, on that beautiful sunny day in a quiet 
area of our equivilent of Golden Gate Park.  And their were people of all 
ages, all colours, workers and dossers; beauty and love all around 
hanging out, playing drums, talking; friends who had not seen each other 
for a while were re-united.  ANd while their were only about 100 people 
every knew each other realy well and for quite some time.  We were at an 
important rest stop on our journey through life.  Us against the world, 
the State, the grown-ups.  And at one point their was a cool breeze and 
all noiticed it; and we were all high and felt so happy in ourselves and 
with each other and this wind had come to relieve us in the heat.  I felt 
like crying feeling so lucky to have friends and be around people that 
felt the same way that I did.  And that, my friends, is, in a nutshell, 
the Zippy vibe.  Anrt't you sad that you will never experience it?  
("England, oh my England.")  Ah well, at least we have Sunset (hopefully)
And that is the main difference.  In England everybody, like Frazer and 
Tom, is family.  All for one and one for all.  But here anybody can stab 
you in the back at a momments notice and the result is everybody is very 
edgey and nobody trusts eachother.  Result: people work against eachother 
rather with each other; there are to many crossed signals.  I mean, just 
from the time that I have subscribed to this network I have seen bitching 
and ego trips going on that would make a bunch of new york queens 
jeolous.  You know what I mean?  "Your so vain, you probably think this 
song is about you!"  All the great dj's like each other, it's just these 
bastard promoter, club owners and secruity personel that are the 
problem.  Soloution?  Need to think about it.
Said my poeace now.  I love Frazer, and I love the whole ethic of the 
entire Zippy movement.  I was theiright from the start when we were 
having raves of fifty people in houses that were condemed and everybody 
thoiught we were mad.  I would not be the person that I am with out the 
influence they have had, for overwheming positive good, on my whole being.
But not I, like the Zippy's must move on and take it to te level.
Much love and respect T.

Just got a # for an outdoor party on the beach somewhere today.
415-927-5650
I don't know who is throwing this party or who the djs are, but it does look 
like a nice day for a party.

        My friend/business-partner and I are planning on expanding the
28.8 kbps network link into our small community-based ISP to a 56k
link sometime this summer and hope to move the system into a more
permanent location before we actually get a digital line to the house.
        We are looking for someone who would like to sublet a room in
a 4BR (or a 3BR + 1 office) house that we plan on finding to move into
in May. Whoever is subletting the room would be allowed to hook up
their computer(s) to the ethernet connecting to our netlink. (We
-hope- it will be a 56k digital line this summer but we can't
guarantee it. At this point we have a fulltime dedicated 28kbps link
into the net. As we continue to expand our net will increase to
fractional-T1 and eventually full T1.)
        We realized that it would be a good idea to look for someone
to rent a room to because we would like a place sufficiently large to
look professional and even hold some small parties in and don't really
have the money to just find a large enough place with only two
people. We are also interested in finding a location which we'll stay
in for quite some time (given that installing a dedicated digital
circuit is expensive and timeconsuming we don't want to move often..)
and hope that once whoever move in decides to move out another of our
friends who would like to join the project but doesn't have the
resources at this time will be able to join with us and move into the
location.
        (You would pay 1/4 of rent and utilities..)

Thanks,

Dear Sfravers;

	Just a follow up to my last post. If you know anyone stable, and
kind I'm still lookin for a new home. I don't have to rush out of my
current situation so I have time and want to find da right place, and
people. 

	My current situation isn't working because of operating hours
conflicts, in other words I keep odd hours typically 11am to 2am weekdays
and later on weekends, and this is a low keyed boarder type house where
I'm a high energy positive person. Also, theres no sense of community or
household here, and people aren't very positive or polite, I mean not even
a please or thanks, just demands. But it is a friendly parting and I get
all of my security deposit back, and a good reference. 

	I don't smoke cig's; but don't care if you do. I have two male
siamese cats that are very friendly and loving; they are litter trained
and declawed and nuetered. I keep odd hours; like most ravers do; I have
an upper limit of $550/month with utillites included.  I'm very quiet,
considerate and communicative; you can see that from my posts. 

	I love people and always do things to try and help out a roommate; 
80% of the time I'm never to busy to help, talk with, do bodywork on a
fellow housemate, or do whatever.  I'm a licensed massage therapist, have 
a BS in Electrical Engineering, and am a Certified Electronic Technican. I
really don't have a geographical preference as long as its close to San
Francisco. I have a computer and spend a lot of time logging. I don't have
a problem keeping my cats in my room; as long as its big enough.  I will 
need to get a separtate phone line for my computer, and can install it 
myself.

	I like chores to be scheduled and devided up in the house, food
can either be communal or separtate, no meat ok. I'm neat, I put the
toilet seat down, and rinse the shower out after I use it. I like things 
to be tidey, but am not the type of person to get down on their hansd and 
knees with a tooth blush to clean the floor. Unless thats the only way to 
get it clean. I would hope my fellow housemates would do their chores 
within 72 hours of its scheduled date.

	I'm open to trading work whether it be massage or engineering
((appliance/computer repair, house wiring(telephone or power), car work
...etc)) for rent and do it very cheaply. For example a licensed electrican
gets about $75/hr, on a trade I will only charge $25/hr and it most cases
I exceed housing specifications, without added or unnecessary cost. As 
far as house wiring goes I can do everything from PG&E point of entry, 
top of mettercan pole, through main circuit breaker panel to the rest of the 
house.

	I don't like mean, rude, excessively drunk, selfish, dishonest,
inconsiderate, violent, illresponsible people. I expect that the rent I 
pay is and even derivative of the total rent; unless my room is either 
bigger or smaller; I'm not willing to sublet and pay for someone elses 
rent just because they hold the lease. 

	I like to have everything on the table, if you need references
from me, to see id ...etc no problem just ask. I feel that trust must be
built not just given, and this is acomplished I feel through being honest,
open, verifiable and accoutable. I expect to see a copy of the lease and
the utillity bills each month. If I move in and things can't be resolved 
though discussion than I would have no problem moving out, it is my 
believe that if I move into your household, and am causing friction to 
the point where we both can't resolve it without major lifestyle changes 
then its me that has to go.

	As housemates I'm much more interested in how you feel about 
something that I may be doing thats bothering you, rather than shouting, 
character assination, or expectations that I'm suppose to change.

	I have some living room furiture; most kitchen appliences,
blender, microwave, toaster ..etc. A great stereo 100watt+, with 150+
CD's; a great computer 486DX2-66 with 500megs of harddrive space. Lots of
artwork everything from fine $$$ to stuff I found on the street. I also
have my own car. 

	If any of this sound interesting to you please either call me at 
510-254-0933 Ct Active or e-mail me at the addresses list below; placing 
the word roommate in the header to get my prompt attention.

This was nice all ages party that took place in
a roomy warehouse in SF.  Except for the free water, this
was basically a no frills affair.  Warm friendly people who
danced and smiled.  Good sets by ray, monty & tracy.  I was really
enjoying ethan's spacier trance set when we got shut down by a couple
of polite SF police at around 5. 

The only thing that annoyed me was the video projection behind the
DJ - Surely they could have found something better than a tape of
the Star Wars trilogy.  Those closeups of Mark Hamill's face just didn't 
do it for me.

After hearing about a party on the beach by sloat, I decided to take a 
motorcycle ride down the coast to check it out and meet some friends.  At 
first I had some doubts about whether this rave on the beach would 
actually happen, and if it did, how long would it last.  The last party 
on the beach I went to got busted in less then an hour.  I rode up about 
1:30 into the parking lot.  Found some ravers, but no music.  One of the 
ravers said music would be there in about half an hour.  So I rode around 
for awhile.  When I came back, the rave on the beach was cranking out 
some music that instantly drew me to it and got me dancing right away.  
There wasn't alot of people dancing, but that didn't matter much to me, 
being able to dance in the outdoors and with the ocean.  

Other raves I've been to there have been alittle further down the beach 
away from sloat, a little more secluded.  It was great to see people 
walking by some stopping to check it out, some dancing a little as they 
did so.  

There was also a group of people who were cleaning up the beach.  
Initially I thought they came for the rave.  I found out later from a couple of 
fellow ravers who decided to help them out, that they were suppose to 
meet some kids there, but the kids never showed up.  One of the fellow 
ravers told them that there are some big kids here that might be willing 
to help.  With that they came over and danced with us and got some of us 
to help clean up alittle. 

I danced for about 3-4 hours before I unfortunately pooped out.  It was 
now 6pm with the party still going, a fire was being made and Galen was 
supposedly due to come on if people were able to withstand the cold.  
Having had my fill, I rode home feeling great riding down the beach with 
the vibe of the still running through me.  My motorcycle sounded like 
some techno base and beats as I cruised home.

[Blatant Self Promo alert]

If any of you have a few moments to spare on Thursday during the day, I 
will be spinning a set at Ameba (in the upper Haight) this coming Thursday,
in the late morning or early afternoon.  I would very much enjoy your
company, and i know the fine folks there would enjoy your company, too.

Also, since i am in self-promo mode, I also expect to be doing one of the
opening sets at Friends and Family this coming Saturday, and would surely
love it if you could come by early.  More information on the party can be
found in the SFR calendar.  I hope you'll all come early (to enjoy everyone's
contribution, not just mine)!

I know, it's a late response, but I guess info about good music never grows
too oldx

Anyway, I have recently returned from London, so I will divide this up into
domestic and import titles. Some titles are repeats from other responses,
most likely, but this should serve to reinforce their
value/importance/quality, etc. etc.

DOMESTIC (or easily available here)
Underworld - Dubnobasswithmyheadman
Sabres of Paradise - Haunted Dancehall
My Life With The Thrill Kill Kult - Kooler Than Jesus (old, but fierce)
Orbital - Snivilisation
Art Of Compilation CD11 - Art Of Mix (Another oldie, but I like it still...)

IMPORT (maybe not-so-easily available, but worth a tryx)
FSOL - ISDN (limited edition of 10,000 copies)
Trance Atlantic
Trance Europe Express
FACT (Future Alliance of Communication and Tecknology (sic) - Carl Cox

I can lend no intelligence as to where you might be able to buy any other
these gems because I live in NY. But my music side lives through SFRAVES. The
Net anihilates distance!

Questions? E-me!

http://www.hotwired.com/, of course :)  The article you probably want is 
http://www.hotwired.com/Lib/Wired/2.05/features/zippies.html
Jules was on the trail of writing a part 2 last summer when the "Vivid

I remember when I was in school in Ireland. (NO.. it wasnt THAT long ago :)
many exam/test questions were posed as follows:

A statement of opinion followed by the command : "Discuss". The purpose was
to show what u knew about the subject.

Seeing that same format here give me the impression  that Fraser 
believes himself to be the teacher and sfraves the class undergoing an
examination :)

What is this next evolutionary level?  If I dunno what it is I dont want
a bootstrap, thanx. However, if Fraser is talking about the "next evolutionary
level" that is referred to by mystics/transpersonal psychologists etc., I'd
sure like to be bootstrapped into that... 'cos it takes a lifetime of work
otherwise, and even then it may never happen. And if u can bootstrap me, cool,
'cos I'd rather party than work any day :)

A small correction here:

Yohimbine is not a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI).  It is a CNS
stimulant, a selective antagonist for alpha 2-andrenergic receptors,
and is associated with increased norepinephrine release. It has been
studied in the laboratory in combination with MAOIs, which inhibit
norepinephrine degradation.

It could, given a large dose, or given with an MAOI, exacerbate the
effects of other drugs to an unknown degree.

If your friend was given an MAOI, it was likely harmaline, a potent
MAOI of about 5-8 hours duration which is easily extracted from
locally growable harmala seeds. Yohimbine must be brewed (extracted)
from yohimbe bark, which must be imported and is fairly expensive.  I
would expect an effective dose of genuine yohimbine to cost at least
several dollars.

All the other caveats apply. For the general public, I'd say that if
you can't recite off the top of your head what an MAOI does, what it
is contraindicated with, and how it synergizes with various other
substances, then you'd best stay away from it until you can.

Sean

PS. MDMA is a short-term selective MAOI to which the above precautions
do not apply.

Thanks to everyone who came - I hope you had a good time. We apologize for
the early ending at 5:00 - there was some miscommunication between the
residents of the space and their neighbors.

Extra special thanks to Ethan for SoundVision and his hard work, energy,
and motivation.

(Sorry about the visuals Lee - I dropped the ball on procuring tapes from
 Area 17 in LA. We'll have the real deal at the next event)

Look for another party in April, most likely in San Jose.

I cannot refute what you are saying here if it indeed is quoted from a
reputable source.  I have however read several books that speak of yohimbe
as being an MAOI.  Your quoted article is perhaps more recent though.  Was
Yohimbe just recently found to *not* be an MAOI?  I have read many places
that say it is, including the package of yohimbe bark sitting in front of me.

> from yohimbe bark, which must be imported and is fairly expensive.  I

Actually, I can buy yohimbe bark here in Texas (legally) for a few dollars
an ounce which is more than enough for at least a dozen doses.  It is
clearly labeled as an MAOI on the package by the people who import it and
package it.  Again, perhaps this information has only recently been refuted,
but I'm not about to go mixing yohimbe with anything, whether it's an actual
MAOI or not and I still tend to think that it is.  You are the first of many
sources I've heard to say that it isn't, you understand my skepticism. 
Thank you very much for the info though.

That's good advice certainly.  I'd just generally stay away from MAOI's
period though unless you really know what you're doing.  I have no idea why
anyone would serve and MAOI at a bar anyway.  That's the stupidist thing
I've ever heard.  Did they not think people would be drinking or taking
anything?  That's just plain idiotic.  My 2 cents.

then you're torching the environment, whether you know it or not.

the la times today mentioned that the EPA has to be called in to
  clean up meth labs when they bust them, because of the amatuerish
    and haphazard way in which toxins are handled.  in most cases,
      they just get dumped.

I've been here only a couple of days, but there's an upcoming event
that I'm curious about, so here goes.  Is anyone else planning to
go to the Chemica Sutra event?  I saw one of the organizers' names
go by here, so I assume the invite's been posted here sometime ago.
I'm thinking of going,and it'd be nice to meet some other sfravers
if that's happening.  It's spring, time to move, groove, feel.
Thanks for any bits.

> 1. A few general statements about why you like to rave.
Well,  for one,  it's great exercise!!   and not only do I get an awsome
workout dancing,  but I get to socialize as well.   Before I was seriously
raving,  I was not that social,  nor did I ever go out much.   Partly
because I was a little self conscous about dancing.

> 2. Comments on the relationship between rave culture and technology.
When I started going to the first Toon Town raves,   there was a lot of
technology present.   Computer graphics,  electronic music,  and other
electronic and computer thingies.    I think these things spun off
from all the parties put on by large companies at computer trade shows.
Early on,  when these parties first started,   they were funded by 
large companies,  who hired the DJ's,   negotiated for venues,  etc.
Eventually,  these evolved into the later Toon Town parties.

> 3. Is the music the most important aspect of the culture?  What do you 
> like about techno and other electronic music?

Well,  the music certainly plays a large part of it,  and tends to be
the fundimental tribal vehicle that carries one along through the trance
state of mind.

> 4. How important are the drugs for promoting the rave vibe?

Drugs are certainly something that can help promote the trance state,
but it's important that people use the drugs wizely and not abuse them
or use them for the wrong purposes,  or take them in wrong combinations.
It also depends on the specific drug,  it's potency and purity.
It also depends on the specific drugs one indulges in.   

> 5. The rave culture is very different from the hippie culture of the 60s 
That is certainly true.... The music is different,  the drugs are also
different.   In the 60's  MDMA wasn't around then,  but acid was also a
lot stronger then todays standards.

> 6. What changes has the movement gone through since you've been part of 
> it?  What are the effects of commercialization?

Well,  for one... it's getting harder and harder to locate good venues,
mostly in part due to the authorities cracking down on good parties.
Also,  events are over commercialized in a very big way,  as promoters
are getting more greedy,  charging far more then they have to.

Certainly they do.  But the people who are really dedicated to the scene
often can tune out the ego factor and cancel out the bad ego facter. 

> 8. Where is the movement heading?  Will it survive or will it die when 
> the music and fashion inevitably changes (like the hippies)?

Well, I certainly hope the movement continues,  as this to me is the
best thing that came my way since the "coolaid acid test of the 60's"
and has been a wonderful remedy to my social problems in the past.

How about some old Disney stuff - Snow White & the 7 Dwarves, Fantasia (the

Dear Sfraves;

	Hi all!!!, hope you are all well & content. Due to the
nonfinancial sucess of myself professionally practicing massage therapy at
raves, the number of events uncovered, the number of people desiring
therapy, my limitations as a human provider, that I'm currently looking 
to organize other therapists out there on and off the scene, so that we 
can bring qualified, diversified, ethical, loving, respectful, responsible, 
massage/touch therapy to the people at raves, for an affordable cost. 

	I would like at this time to invite other ethical massage/touch,
and other alternative healing/art professionals to contact me so that we
can organize & network togther, in cooperation not competition, so to
provide a wonderful generation, with quality, affordable, touch &
alternative therapy/art at raves. To make our parties not just a place to
burn brain cells, but to celabrate life, heal & love one another in a way
thats both affirming and respectful of each others self. So that raves can
go further down the path to becoming a true festival of life, diversity,
healing energy and love. Jimi Hendrix believed that music would eventually
be a healing art, that it would penatrate the body like rays and heal. I
believe we can do this though, touch, dance, art and music. 

	Just the mear act of you reaching out and placing your hand on
some elses body, brings pressure, heat, and energy to that area. The
pressure pushes clogged lymph, and waste products into the drainage system
of the body of the person being touched. The heat makes the connective
tissue which surrounds our entire body more liquidifed, meaning the layers
of muscle tissue side across each other more easially. Also making our
bodies celluar matrix more liquidifed, which means immune cells can move
around the body easier, requiring less energy to do their healing &
regenerative functions. With removal of the touch/pressure fresh blood and
nutrients come into to that area and feed the tissue and the cells. As far
as energy goes, no one really knows what happens when the energy fields
that surround each of us, uniquely characterize and polarized by our own
individuality, state of being and genetics, comes in contact with
anothers. All I know is that when someone with a loving, respectful, kind
intent reachs out and touchs me, I get the warm fuzzies and feel great,
ENERGY!!!!. 

	To become one with ourselves and the people around us, though 
respectful affirming touch, dance, music, astrology, art, science, 
technology, food, drink, and alternative substance ...etc

	I really want this to become part of our celabrations, I see a 
need and a desire for it. To provide people at our events with quality, 
responsible, certified first aid care, drug overdose or bad trip care, 
and of course good reventative & feel good therapy as well. We deserve to do 
this for ourselves, and I feel we can make it happen, As long as greed 
doesn't get in our way!!!!!!

	I do massage at raves for the love of doing massage at raves, to
be a part of the scene, to touch and provide people with a little bit of
love and care. Yes I charge a very small fee for these services, that fee
is at a rate of 65% less than what I normally charge. If I were to do it
for free, and I do give a lot of massage away, I would have a line out the
door, and would be exhausted both mentally and physically in an hour. 
What I do for people who can't afford to pay the $5.00 is I do 10 minutes
for 10 minutes, in others words you rub me for 10 minutes and I'll rub you
for 10 minutes. I don't care about the precision of your strokes, all I
care about is whether your hearts in the right place, whether you care
about the person your hands are on, thats what does it for me. 

	So if you are a promoter, or a massage/touch/alternative healing
arts person and are interested in either having or joining me and my
partners respectively please contact me at 510-254-0933. I'm available for
most benefit work, any AIDS or environmental benefits get 120% of my
proceeds, 120% not a typo. But only do it for the love of raving, the scene, 
yourself, and the beautiful people of this area.

Hey All,

Just spoke with Mars (Marz?), and he wanted me to post, so here ya go:

Friday, March 17: 	Xogenix
			Hyperparty-Cybertrance
			The first of its kind Interactive Party

			"If trance is your religion, then come to our Temple"

			8p-4a, 21+, $7	
			
			Info Line for this and future events: (415) 541-5019

		 
Mars(z?) says that this and future events are focused as an "alternative" 
to the familiar house/techno/jungle/acid/trance/hip/trip/slip... (whew!) 
etc. stuff. He wouldn't elaborate on just what KIND of music will be played.

He's got my curiosity. Looks like I got a busy weekend ahead. ;)

Later...

-Jonas

Ummm Where do you think the MA comes from in MDMA? Or is this a blanket

Hello all you beautiful sfravers,

	I'll start by saying it's wonderful to be back on line! Thanx to 
Brian Darkness for posting that little announcement about my netcom 
account problem! 

	First things first! Harmony last friday was postponed as some of 
you know, because of the horrible storms that rocked california last 
weekend! We had the hardest time trying to figure out what to do. But, 
in the long run, (at about 5pm.) we decided to postpone the party 
because it was not safe for people to drive up to the location. We did 
not want people getting stuck overnight if the roads got blocked again 
after the party would have started. (By the way, the roads did get 
blocked again overnight!.) We did not want to run off generators, (the 
location lost all power until sunday afternoon!) But most of all we did 
not want anyone getting hurt! So it was a unanimous decision... We are 
truly sorry...

	So to make it up to you, we are planning the best make-up party 
that we are capable of! It is going to be in the same beautful location. 
(No, the river didn't wash the building away!) We are now able to put in 
more time to make the party even better than what we planned for march 
10th! We are also working more harmoniously with Craig Larson to set up 
a spectacular visual light show! Randy and the crew from Dionysus Dreams 
are setting up a bigger and better ambient area. (Before we were only 
using a small portion of one of the rooms for an ambient area, now we 
have the whole thing! Reconstruction was taking place that week of march 
10th.) We are making more props for the party, (some got destroyed at 
Trent's house party!) We are using different dj's this time! So far we 
have Trent, Ethan, and Galen! More are to be announced...Pretty cool...

	This party is planned for march 31st. Three weeks away, I can't 
wait! 

	I wanted to say a great thanx to all of you who made it to 
Trent's house on friday. That was a pretty bad ass party! Trent kicked 
serious butt! And, we recorded it on DAT, so he might get it on tapes 
or something.) I had a great time, and loved meeting all of you! I thank 
you for supporting us and understanding our situation...

Peace, love, and harmony to all,

Shroomy


Ps. I want to say in our world today, we all need to live together, work 
together, and exist together. In times of crisis, (Loma Prieta, 
Hurricane Andrew, floods, etc.) we all come together as one. A society 
with one purpose, to help the misfortuned. We all come together in 
harmony to get things done. Those times are the most destructive times 
in the world, but then they are also the most beautiful times. To be 
able to see hundreds and thousands of people working together to help 
eachother is the most beautiful occurance in time. Participating is even 
better! So remeber that in order to survive as a culture, as a world, we 
must work together and help eachother as much as possible, not just in 
times of crisis! Living together, in harmony, is the key... Spread the 
love!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

C-YA @ F & F!!

Latest info from RAVE HEAVEN!!

Well,  It's now Wednesday here in Australia,  and Tuesday in the USA,,
and this is yet another wakey rave report on an interesting weekly
happening in Sydney,  Australia.

In the Darlinghurst district in Sydney which is similar to the Castro
in San Francisco,  there exists this pub called Bently's
on Crown St.   And every Wed evening,  a group of very interesting
musicians called Clan Analogue,  which is a collective of talented
musicians,  hold a "get together/ dance party" with DJ'd music,  and
live acts.

I'm not sure of the DJ's name,  but he started off with hi-nrg house,
slightly faster than the normal pace of the SF scene.   About an hour
later,   the most insane hi-energy acid trance started to fill up the
dance floor.    I decided to do this one sober - And as usual,  the
music pumped in just as much awsome energy into my body that L and E
could have done.   And at the prices of "E",   doing it sober was
really neat,  and absolutly necessary.

All around me,   I was pumping in energy into the dance crowd,  and to
be honest,   they just aren't used to seeing a old 52 yr old dude from
America dancing like a maniac.    It seems that the club scene here has
a really interesting vibe.   One thing I noticed missing are the Gangsta
types.   They just don't exist here.   Or if they do,   they are doing
a good job of hiding.   Very few Black people here.

I've come to the conclusion,  Sydney is RAVE HEAVEN!!  And I encourage every
self respecting raver to get down,  Down under...   These guys really know
how to party...   And I'm being deluged with people asking me about the
SF scene.    When I say it's Housey,  they say "Cool,  but we like more
variaty".   House music takes a 2nd stage over here,  but in the club
scene,  it's mostly house.

Almost everywhere I go,  I hear techno...  in the shops,  on people's car
radios,  in the clubs,  and on the radio.   Especially on the radio.   

There are no stations that dedicate ALL their time to techno,   but it's not
that hard to find it on the dial perhaps about 50% of the time.   For instance,
on 2SER FM,  they have it from 2 - 4 pm every day.

They also got community stations here,  and one in particular is 
Radio Skid Row...   A low power station,  serving the center of Sydney
with about 60% techno and alternate programming.

On thursday evening at 1 am,  I was invited to be interviewed on the radio
and talked about the SF scene.   It was recieved very well,  had many people
call in and ask me questions,  as well as give messages out to listeners.

Vic Zitser,  a DJ,  hosted the program,   and before the radio show,  we
sat behind his turntables at his pad and I got a chance to spin some
Happy Hardcore,  and Acid trance,  and he showed me how to gradually "up"
the tempo from 130 bpm to 180 bpm in a totally seamless way.   A very
interesting DJ trick.   I wish OUR DJ's would do things like that.

I also met Bernie,  the dude putting on this birthday bash,  and he
reminds me of Frazer Clark...  

It appears to be very common for DJ's to start off relativly slow,  say
around 140 BPM,  and gradually increase the tempo to 190 BPM in a single
2 hour set.  

Happy hardcore,  totally absent from the SF scene,  primarily due to it's
faster BPM range of 160 - 180,  is just not yet accepted in the SF scene,
at least in the mainstream.

I have to say,  it's really neat,  and incredably ennergetic.

On the air,  we talked and plugged "Bernie's Birthday Bash" a party thats
to take place tonight at "The Pavilion".    Other parties scheduled tonight
are....

As you all can see,  there are just too many parties for this one heavy
raver dude to swallow in one evening.   But I was able to manage to get
on Bernies,  and Symbiotic's guest list,  so will probably check out
at least these two.

Almost all the parties take place in Sydney city center,  and are all
within the 1 km area.

There is one thing thats really annoying...  It's those "0055" numbers
given out on the flyers.  They are similar to our "900" numbers,  but
when you call them,  you can get soaked for about $5 per call,  and
it's really annoying when they have a 3 minute entro of just music
and another 5 minutes of narration before the directions are given
to the venue.

Last night,  I got a hotel in Kings Cross,  and WOW!!  Whatta trip Kings Cross
is on a Friday evening.   There are strip tease joints and barkers constantly
pulling people into their venues.  Cover ranges from $25 for strip acts,  and
of course dancing.   Most of these play house in the 120 BPM range.   Boring!!

I dosed up a tab,  and the "Cross" as it's called is really something to behold.
First off,   establishments can sell booze 24 hours a day.   There is NO 2 am
closing time.   The ALL stay open all night long,  at least until 6 am,  and
mostly till 8 am.   Drinking age here is 18 and over,   and ID checking is
lax at best.

After leaving my hotel,  I decided to go back to Club-77 to hear Phil Smart,
Sugar Ray,  Jumping jack,  and Nick Fish.   When I arrived,  Jumping jack was
spinning house,  and I heard all the familiar songs heard in SF.    It was
like I ever left.   Later on,  Phil smart got on,   and guess what...  I heard
the laughing song...  So it's played here as well.   :-)   The name of this
weekly is 'LOADED",  and behind the turntables are a really cool Mural showing
a loaded gun with a smile on it's side and a bullet coming out (Also with
smile).    For a club,  the vibe was totally insane.   I got tons of smiles,
and people coming up and dancing next to me.

I think the Aussies are starting to get a feel for the absolute dedication to
the scene that I represent.   Although I've been nursing a cold when I arrived,
it hung on for almost a week,  and I felt like my energy level was at an all
time low.   

Jumping Jack finally went on,  and spun the most awsome acid trance I've heard
since Goa Gil....  Yow!!  I went totally insane and almost completly forgot that
I really wanted to try and get some sleep.    But as it always turns out,
sleep is something I always sacrafice when I have such a good time.   One dude
who calls himself "Stickey" came up to me and gave me a big smile and thumbs
up.   The dancing energy though was rather low for Calif standards but when
Sugar Ray went on,   WOW!!  What a increase in energy....  Everyone was cheering
and yelling just like back home.

The Club 77 is a rather small venue,  and it can get hot and stuffy in there
but I managed to find the air conditioner vent and a great spot to dance
and stay cool.

Later on,   Sugar Ray came up to me and asked me who I was,  and where I came
from.   I filled him in on the details,  and after I told him I was writing
about the rave scene,  he consented to an interview.   Sometime soon,  I'm
going to sit down and talk to him about the Australian scene in detail and
write up more stuff and publish it in SFRaves, alt.rave,  and AusRaves.

So,  later this afternoon,  I'm going to interview him at BPM records.
YEA!!  They got a BPM record store HERE as well.    I don't think they
are affiliated with the BPM store in SF.

I'm sitting here in an American Cafe in the Cross,   where I discovered they
serve American Pancakes (A rarity here in Australia).

Well,   I gotta prepare some Email to upload later,  when I can find a phone,
so I'll break off here...  It may be as late as Wednesday before I'll get
the chance to upload this.

---------

WELL,  I wasn't able to scarf up a freebie and get into Restoration,  but
bought a ticket anyway.   When I arrived,  they had two arenas set up,
one playing house which I avoided,  because coming from SF scene,  we
get all the house and garage anyone would ever want.   So I headed directly
for the Hard Core arena and loosened my body up a tad with some pretty insane
breakbeat with Sasha behind the turntables.   I was practically the only
one dancing,   so I decided to go down George St about 5 blocks to check
out Bernies Birthday Bash.   I then learned that the Vibe tribe party was
to be in Alexandria's Graffitti hall of fame,   which was way too far to
make it on foot.    So I called Mike Dagn to tell him that I couldn't
make it,  unless someone was to give me a ride.

Unfortunately,  I didn't recieve Addey's message until long after the
party.    Sorry about that!!   But I don't have access to a home phone
anymore so I was only able to check my Mail a few days later...

As I was looking for the Pavilion entrance,  I asked a few young Aussie
dudz where "the Bash" was,  and they said "You go to raves?"   I said
"Yup!  I live to rave...."  they asked how old I was,  and after telling
them,  they said "Far out...  We need older people here in our scene".

I then told them I came from Restoration,  and it waas just starting up,
and they said that they were planning to go over and check it out.

When I arrived at the Pavilion,   things were just getting set up,  and
their dress code didn't allow shorts,  but luckily I popped over to Bill's
pad and changed,  then came back..

Bernies party was a real slow starter,  but I met this dude who was to
be heading over to Vibe tribe at about 4 am,   but was unable to connect
as I explain later...

Bernies bash provided me with some wonderful Happy Hardcore which is
totally non-existant in the SF scene (whotta drag),  and now I know
why they call it that.    I was bopping around the dance floor with
this huge smile on my face,  groovin to the insane pace of 170 - 180
BPM's just getting off big time.    My Aussie friends must have thought
I was totally insane,  as I was chasing the lazer beams all over the
dance floor like a total insane idiot.   Sorta like a dog chasing
a flashlight beam  :-)

I had been partying the evening before at the Loaded bash at Club 77,
but my energy level for the 2nd allnigher was really cranked up and
was totally peaking all evening until the end.    Ahhh!!  These double
all nighters really get me going.... 

The Lazer show was really cool,   and the fog machine provided my eyes
with superb eye Kandy....

After a while,   I wanted to walk around Sydney for a while and head back
to Restoration,  and by the time I arrived,  things were going in full
swing.   I imediately wasted no time and got down to the most insane
acid trance I've heard since hearing Goa spin.   I met those same Aussie
Dudz I met at the Pavilion on the dance floor,  and they couldn't believe
the energy I had.   

I was certainly the oldest dude out there,   as almost everyone was younger
than 25.   But I didn't let that stop me from really getting on and groovin
big time.   People around me were totally blown away as I poured on the
energy and good vibe.   WOW!!  My cheeks still hurt from all the smiling
I've done.

I headed back to Bernies Birthday bash so I could catch my ride to the Vibe
tribe,   but for some reason,  Bernie's bash ended early, and there were
rumours that Vibe tribe might get busted.    This scared off my ride,  so
my opportinuty for a ride to Vibe tribe was reluctantly removed,  and
I had no choice to either head back to Restoration,   or do this special
workshop that involved watching the sun rise at the beach.

Not having an opportunity to go to a Sydney beach,  we head out to Bondai
Beach and watch the sunrise experimenting with a massive dose of "A".

The sunrise was awsome,   and after that,  we walked around the many coves
and inlets as well as gawked at the beautiful homes,  and jogging pathways
along the beach.   The cliffs were totally amazing....  The water was
amazingly clear,   very clean and sanitary beaches here.   I haven't
seen such clean water since I visited the tropics.  The brown cliffs,
carved by ions of years appeared to be sculpted by some insane artist.

After the sunrise,  we ate breakfast,  and took a bus back to the 
inner city.

--------

After returning,  I chilled in the Botonical gardens and went swimming
in a local salt water pool.    As I was lying on the grass,  this Ibis
bird was poking it's long curved bill into the ground barley 6 inches
from my face as I was lying there.   One thing thats really startling
is the abundance of exotic birds,  and how close you can get to them
without them flying away.

In 2 weeks,  I plan to take a trek up into the Blue mountains,  and
this upcoming Friday,  an outdoors rave is scheduled.

Even though the two substances aren't unrelated, the methods used to
produce them are different, so MDMA manufacture is not necessarily as
damaging. In addition meth is much easier to produce, therefore it's more
likely that amateurs and others not familiar with proper chemical safety
procedures are involved in its synthesis.

How about some old Disney stuff - Snow White & the 7 Dwarves, Fantasia (the 
dancing brooms and mops would be perfect), etc.




I vote for Barbarella, too

hey all,
this is completely off the subject of sfr, but i 
just *had* to share the great experience i had in introducing raves to 
some of my friends out here in cow-ville Davis:
last weekend i brought 8 die-hard dead-head friends to their first rave 
(it was in sacramento). the vibe was not going on, most people left by 
3am, and it was over-priced. but, if i've learned anything since moving 
up north and getting "into" the sf rave scene, it's that you can't 
just expect a positive vibe to just happen, you gotta help create the 
magic--so i brought lots of fun stuff to share and tried to make some smiles.
at any rate, it was really great seeing my friends really turning onto 
this rave (despite its flaws) and going *nuts* dancing to Dj Dan and 
curiously looking at Dubtribe, with their equipment strewn all over the 
floor, and asking, "jason, how do they *make* this trippy music?!?!" it 
was so wonderful seeing them smiling and playing/meditating in the chill
room...
all i have to say is THANK YOU sf ravers for showing me that raving 
is all about a good vibe! my experiences at the "best" L.A. and S.D. raves 
are nothing compared to even the *worst* party up here. the vibe is the seller!
here's a tid-bit from one of my friends:

> It was definately an unforgetable 
> night.  I have never experienced anything like it. RAD RAD RAD!! I wanna

> AMAZING!

peace n' stuff
jase
ps see ya @ FF (even though ph-ph is only 15min away. sorry, i'm addicted)

Altered States.  Kind of a BS movie though, if you eat Amanita Muscaria
shrooms all you're going to get is sick, no trip.  I hate when hollywood
doesn't do it's research.  People could get hurt.  I like the guy running
around in the monkey suit though. ;) hehe.

Altered States... loosely based on Lilly's work with hallucenogens and
sensory deprivation.

(we said koyaanisquatsi, right?) (please forgive my mangled spelling on that
one)

Please! no Saturday morning stuff!  Please, please, please...well, maybe
Scooby Doo, Bugs, Road Runner, you know, the classics; but no modern
"stuff."  Next thing you know we'll have Power Ranger representatives
looking for endorsement opportunities.  (Not that Disney wouldn't come
knocking at the drop of a needle.)  Here's a scary thought: Barney.  AH! 
Who wrote that!  Damn these hands, damn them!

How about:   The Omega Man, Laurel and Hardy, Three Stooges, Little Rascles
[sp], Harold and Maude (My personal favorite movie!), Simpsons' episodes (I
would surely lose it if I looked up from a heavy Lee An enduced trance and
saw Homer sitting down to 100 individually wrapped slices of cheese...=^}

I'll slink away now...

Tony

13.    THE WIZARD OZ   !!!
	(Pee Wee's stuff and Dorothy and the gang count double maybe 
please?  ;) 
14.    add Baraka to the 'sqatsi films ?

    suggestions:  Mary Poppins, Auntie Mame (Rosalind Russel Version), 
Peter Pan (Tinkerbell!), Faster Pussycat, Kill, Kill (take that, 
lecherous geezer man- fierce hifgh camp killer Amazons- Tura Satana!),
Black Orpheus, Beyond the Valley of the Dolls (for "this is my scene and 
it freaks me out!" alone), The Adventures of Baron Munchausen (and any 
Monty Python/terry Gilliam?), Priscilla, Queen of the Dessert ("I will 
survive!" in Vegas in space style drag in the outback honey!), 
Orlando, Marlon Rigg's "Anthem"- black gay male defiant Chicago house and 
snap diva's short video rallying cry), Satyricon, The Wiz (Dorothy and 
company again, souled up-?), Latcho Drom (gypsy wail and romance), Harold 
and Maude (no dancing, but the vibe!), Female Trouble (or is John 
Waters too much?), City of Women, La Dolce Vita (or too decadent and 
too much Marcello Mastioni/bachelor ego?), someone said 2001, right?, 
Planet of the Apes!, Breakfast at Tiffany's (go Holly Go Lightly, party 
girl and "screaming reds/blues" moods woman!), Rocky Horror Picture 
Show...the list goes on and on...

(and i'm sorry if most of these belong on a house queen and club kid or 
gay favorites list, we just find em carnivalesque, not very "faceless 
techno bollocks" at all)    ;)

Dear Sfraves;

	I read something recently that bothered be greatly, and am now I 
think emotionally clear enough to write about it coherently. Someone 
mentioned that at times there have been groups of men/boys going around 
raves, with the intention of gang raping womyn on E.

	When I read this I cannot express in words the level of outrage, 
shame as a man, and anger I felt. As men we cannot allow behaviour such as 
this continue in our time. We as men must put a stop to this senseless 
destruction and violation of our fellow womyn/sisters. I remember cring 
when I read about the mass raping of womyn over in Bosina.

	I've seem the end results of such horrible behaviour, a life 
still living but utterly destoried. I just cannot understand, and will 
not except behaviour from another man, and will fight them anyway I know how.

	If you know someone who has particpated in such acts please turn 
them into the authorites, because they will do it again. We must stop 
these sick people before they destory another life.

	Yes, I do understand that people who do this have often been 
abused themselves, and often by womyn. Their belief systems are so 
perverted from the hurt and pain that they are it, that they feel 
justified in their actions. As men they are also often not able to access 
the emotional safety valves that normal healthy people have available to 
them, for coping with extreme trauma.

	But this is still no excuse to go out and do the same thing to
other beautiful innocent human being. I as a man & as a human being say
that this must stop and that we as men can put a end to rape in all its
forms in our time.  But to do this we must not tolerate it from our
contemporaies, and must report it to the authorites, insist that our
legislators make strong effective punishments, provide preventative and
after the fact consuling for both victums and perpetrators, and education 
in our schools.

	I remember talking with a freind of mine who was recently date
raped, she was such a beautiful care free person who loved and trusted
everyone. After she was raped, when she wasn't in a disassoicated state,
she was just afraid, afraid of men, people, and what hurt the most, even
me. We sat their and cried together. I hope I never have to do that again.
As a male massage therapist I have to deal with this fear a lot. A lot of
my womyn friends say they walk around in fear. When I first started
becoming aware of the level and severity of this I almost couldn't believe
it. I would encourage men to ask womyn about this, encourage men to become
more aware that are sisters live in a state of rape fear. 

	On the other hand I would encourage parents to teach both genders
of their children how to fight and defend themselves, not just the boys. 
I would encourage womyn to learn how to defend themselves if no one has
ever taught them to. Of course I would always stress violence as a last
resort to saving ones life or self. 

	I'm sorry I realize this isn't totally rave related, I feel its 
important to talk about these things, To make people more aware, for this 
is all I can do as a fellow human being, is make people more aware. I 
feel if you bring awareness into people's lives the rest will take care 
of its self. I hope this made you think & feel, I hope that you feel just as 
outraged as I did when I first read about Gangbangers. I hope as men, that 
we put a stop to this in our life times. Thanks.

Dear Sfraves;

	I read something recently that bothered be greatly, and am now I 
think emotionally clear enough to write about it coherently. Someone 
mentioned that at times there have been groups of men/boys going around 
raves, with the intention of gang raping womyn on E.

	When I read this I cannot express in words the level of outrage, 
shame as a man, and anger I felt. As men we cannot allow behaviour such as 
this continue in our time. We as men must put a stop to this senseless 
destruction and violation of our fellow womyn/sisters. I remember cring 
when I read about the mass raping of womyn over in Bosina.

	I've seem the end results of such horrible behaviour, a life 
still living but utterly destoried. I just cannot understand, and will 
not except behaviour from another man, and will fight them anyway I know how.

	If you know someone who has particpated in such acts please turn 
them into the authorites, because they will do it again. We must stop 
these sick people before they destory another life.

	Yes, I do understand that people who do this have often been 
abused themselves, and often by womyn. Their belief systems are so 
perverted from the hurt and pain that they are it, that they feel 
justified in their actions. As men they are also often not able to access 
the emotional safety valves that normal healthy people have available to 
them, for coping with extreme trauma.

	But this is still no excuse to go out and do the same thing to
other beautiful innocent human being. I as a man & as a human being say
that this must stop and that we as men can put a end to rape in all its
forms in our time.  But to do this we must not tolerate it from our
contemporaies, and must report it to the authorites, insist that our
legislators make strong effective punishments, provide preventative and
after the fact consuling for both victums and perpetrators, and education 
in our schools.

	I remember talking with a freind of mine who was recently date
raped, she was such a beautiful care free person who loved and trusted
everyone. After she was raped, when she wasn't in a disassoicated state,
she was just afraid, afraid of men, people, and what hurt the most, even
me. We sat their and cried together. I hope I never have to do that again.
As a male massage therapist I have to deal with this fear a lot. A lot of
my womyn friends say they walk around in fear. When I first started
becoming aware of the level and severity of this I almost couldn't believe

My point is that quite a few of the same highly toxic and corrosive 
chemicals are involved, and are just as easily mis-handled. I think it is 
silly that people put themselves on a pedestal in regards to their drug 
usage.

i dream of castrati...standing sweetly at a party, gang-bangers never 
more, just sweet screeching-along-with-the-diva castrted boy/men!...

Diamanda Galas, her wild women with steak knives routine, at a rave
(well almost, a few years ago at Fusion club at the Oasis, Niki Rivera i 
think it was spun some gigantic Galas-like voice booming something about 
waking up, possible life on Mars, and desires unbound- briefly, between 
house/techno/high energy). Fabulous!

Brian, my in the haze of emotion response to your eloquent horror, you 
said it! (Rorgive me for invoking Lorena Bobbit notions for raves, but 
that's how i feel toward gun, violence, hate pain spewing  freaking 
idiots of any sex, especially male, at parties...watching this stuff 
happen in a utopian peace aspiring scene is really hard to take...
"oh yes mum, it can really be as fucked up as any other crummy scene, 
PLUR shattered by a few testosterone ridden neanderthal freaks, ok 
mum."
	I don't know the L.A. or local rave-turned-riot nightmare 
stories, but i remember the horror of M.E.S.S.'s tiny Candlestick Park 
water front party disruption- being surrounded for a few minutes by 
rival gangs ponding on eachother and beating the faces of some of us 
merry partyers who kindly asked them to either stop harrassing the women, 
stay and dance with us, or else leave.  No gunshots from these packed 
guys, we were relieved, but still, the fear.
	Wrong turf, bad luck, no matter how happy the house being 
spun at the time, oh well.

re: gangrapes of women at/after raves

scary shit!  i'm curious - where did you read this?  a small part of me 
is skeptical, wondering if it came from a conservative source, but 
of course it's just the same old "fratboy" sexist 
shit, different drugs.

it sucks, but people carry all their nasty baggage with them to parties, 
of course.  i wish raves were a complete escape from capitalist 
hetero-patriarchy (to use bell hooks' term), and sometimes they are, but 
most often not.  i know, i know, there's no overnight revolutions, in 
consciousness or otherwise, but it still totally sucks to have to deal 
with abuse anytime, esp. at a rave, and i'm really saddened to hear about 
that.

Actually, Black Dog is 'The Black Dog.' Check out just about any release 
except Bytes. It'll say 'Black Dog.' Far as I unnahstood it, Black Dog 
Productions is the umbrella name for BD and all their related/spinoff 
groups. Bytes was more-or-less a compilation (a very nepotistic one, but 
a compilation nonetheless). BDP includes Plaid, but doesn't necessarily 
mean that they're the true Black Dog. 

If it's fake, then I certainly wouldn't figure Black Dog themselves to 
be behind it. Would you want to lug your gear 5000 miles to play a show 
you've scared everyone away from? And since the Spacetimers got a danka 
on Bytes (if it *was* for them), I figure they'd know the difference.

*late news flash*

I heard from Miguel (single cell orch) that there was some problem or 
confusion with getting Ken Downie into the US. He didn't know if he was 
actually here or not, but said that someone would be posting a message 
(or apology as the case may be) to the net shortly.

Either way, I'm still going. SpaceTime, Velocette and SCO are well worth 
the admission. I tend to believe that this is more of a miscommunication
or accident rather than a scam. And I certainly can't say I'm not a Plaid 
fan either.

jmar. woof.

uhh... i really don't like to see most movies at parties...esp.sci fi 
ones, etc.  bo-ring, IMHO.

koyaanisquatsi (sp?) is great, remember they had it playing in the chill 
room at the Buyers Club benefit, but it's like, how can you be all happy 
and partying when witnessing such misery and pain?

i guess movies in chill rooms are ok, tho'.  i would just hate to be 
dancing and watching a narrative film.  (tho' i really like michael 
clay's trip to europe on video!)

anyhow, i'd prefer raunchy porn, i guess.  something pansexual with lots 
of body types.

a member of that band Green Day at the podium accepting a "Bammy" music 
award, staring at the crowd with the phallic statuette thing in his mouth...

(i only saw the photo, ok, but _that's_ subversive! and sex-positive.
people say "punk is dead, house or polka or whatever reigns more smartly" 
but those obnoxious punk smarty pants can really impress sometimes, or 
testify to compelling other scenes.
Or at least this is for the folks on this list who use "cock-suckers" as 
an insult, as if they were sex-negative faceless techno bollocks...)
just some more sprightly faggotry for ya :)

The Chemica  Sutra Technoerotic Expedition is a Megatripolis Parallel
University Event. Space
 is extremely limited with only room for 150 people so all those
considering attending - come early to avoid disappointment.  For those
unable to make it  Chemica Sutra will be followed in April by  a second
Parallel Univeristy Event featuring Dan Mapes'  and the Cyberlab 7 Safari
Across V.R.  Zen & Now. More details will follow. The Parallel University
for those who don't know, organises Infinity Treks, using ancient & modern
visionary technologies, to the points where seemingly parallel universes
meet. We claim to do this in as human and subversively edutaining a manner
possible. Intelligent Raving, in a nutshell. See you there!
Love,
        Fraser   x  x

There are a lot of us out here who have been going to Grateful Dead concerts
for years.  Most of us weren't around for the Acid Tests, but wish we had been.

We love to dance.  We NEED to dance.

Does anybody what a dissgusion about hardcore in the UK?
I'm a student in Newcastle and so :-

1) Theres not much happening ( apart from a event every couple of 
months.
2) As soon as you tell other students you like "Dance Music", all I 
seem to get is made fun of!

Is there an e-mail address for Eternity or M8 magazines??

Somebody speak to me.

I enjoy expressing my opinions, but I have no illusions about the
importance of my words.  What we say, like the propaganda on rave flyers,
means little compared to our actions.  Ultimately, it is our behavior
towards one another, the way in which our intentions are executed and
*felt* by others that will determine whether our "meme" or ideas propagate. 

And speaking of successful propagation, this is quite a symbolic weekend 
we have coming up.  

- We have the 4-year anniversary of the Full Moon Rave thanks to the 
Wicked crew who came over here from the UK to help mold and establish the 
SF scene and have continued to perpetuate a tradition of insanity and
transcendence through music and dance.  

- The one year anniversary of Friends And Family will celebrate the heart 
and soul of the kind of renegade raving that Ethan, Bryce and others have 
been quietly sharing with us (for 2 years actually) out of their love for 
people and for the ideals of individual freedom.

- Another free Organic Party in Golden Gate Park thanking us, the 
house/rave community, for helping them perpetuate the joyful vibe that
has continued to make their parties a success over the years.

- And in 2 weeks we'll have the first Sunset party of the year from
relative newcomers, the Pacific crew, who melted our hearts last year
with their selflessness and caring intuition about what it means to
make good intentions a reality.

I won't be able to go to all of these events, but will continue to
support these people in my own small way, whenever I can.  I am confident
that the SF Bay Area rave scene will continue to grow and evolve, with or
without my (or anyone's) words.  Promoters/sound systems/clubs/philosphers 
will continue to come and go for a variety of reasons.  The ones that 
contribute positively to our scene, promoting unity and love, or whatever
it is that people want and need, will succeed through the actions that do 
just that.  It's that simple.

Lee

Joe's point was that although the molecules are nearly identical,
the manufacturing process is not really that close.
Which means that different chemicals are used and in a different manner.

The point about meth labs is that they are all over the place.
In a ten minute drive through a local neighborhood
i probably pass a good 10 to 20 (or more?) meth production places
mostly being done in hotel rooms where the disposal of things is 
done by dumping fumes up the faucet in the sink and the rest
down the drain of the bathtub

MDMA production obviously doesnt happen like this
or i would know a lot more E dealers and producers
than i do speed dealers and producers.

MDMA is usually being made by people who know what they are doing
because it is a much more complicated process.  People
who arent doing it in hotel rooms and therefore are
more careful about what they do with their waste so they dont get caught.

well, i'm not sure where brian got his info but this *does* happen.  I've 
been to 2 raves personally where someone got raped.  The shit lousy 
excuse for security that they had at these raves never noticed, nor did 
anything to report it (probly out of fear that the party might be busted) 
althgo there was plenty security around. (i guess that the only thing 
that these guys are good for is to take away people's pens and water 
bottles).  Especially sad iz that fact that one of these instances (at 
16th and Heroin of all places). the victim was on 3 or 4 hits of fry and 
several E's.  She totally bad tripped and started screaming random 
incoherent frases.  when the secuirity tried to restrain her she bit and 
snarled at them.  Basically she completely flipped out.  I just can't 
believe or understand how people could be willing to do this to a poor 
innocent girl.

This may seem a little off the subject of SF Raves, but I think that I is 
entirely within the realm of what we are all talking about.  Developing a new 
community which transcends the problems of our current hierarchial, dominator 
culture.  I am working on my senior thesis and I am focusing on our end of the 
millinea culture.  Specifically, I am examining the writings and prophecies of 
Terence McKenna and Timothy Leary, the development of a new language, and the 
'end of history'; cyberspace, VR and the culture developing in the rave 
scenes.  If anyone has read McKenna or Leary's most recent works, has any 
comments, opinions or just wants to discuss these ideas, I'd appreciate the 
help. 

Thank You!!!

No, his message had nothing to do with MDMA. In a response, he clairified 
by stating that he would prefer that ALL nasty chemicals stay in 
industrial areas, and not in peoples' back yards. The only reason I 
griped was the title of the message. I was just pointing out that 
another substance that is widely used, uses many of the same 
ingredients. And many of the same chemicals are used.

Not necessarily true. Catch the piece on the news a few months back about all
the fixins' for a batch of MDMA being stored in mid summer in a storage 
facility(nice metal one?)

Who is to say where every batch is created? I don't know, and no offense, 
I don't believe you do either.

Again, my point is simply that chemicals can and probably are disposed of 
improperly by some makers of chemicals besides Methamphetamines. I doubt 
every happy e-lab spends the money on taking their waste to a toxic 
disposal facility. Or acid lab, or whatever......

There's some pretty tripped out older movies too, e.g. 

"The 5000 Fingers of Dr. T" (or something close to that) starring the 
little kid from Lassie -- Tommy Rettig.

i guess i'll assume the security was haze theatre staff...
did any other partygoers try to do anything?  fucking pathetic...
shit, we really need to communicate about this kind of stuff when it 
happens so we can take action against the rapists, if we know who they 
are, as well as the "security" staff ... by "take action" i mean we could 
boycott the venue as well as making a lot of publicity around it: get it 
into all the "underground" magazines, hand out flyers, etc. - bascially 
hold these people accountable for their actions or, as the case may be, 
inaction.  

please, if anyone sees anything like this again, post it to sfraves, and 
email me at litterbx@priscilla.ultima.com.  

shit, this makes me so fucking angry.

hmmm... i really DOUBT that we'd ever see any kind of rape or attempted 
rape at friends and family, but sexual harassment MAY be a problem (i'm 
not saying it IS a problem at F&F becuz i've never witnessed or heard of 
any myself, but it's not out of the realm of possibilities.)  maybe we 
(people who organize parties), when we're getting a security/peace keeper 
team together, need to be better prepared to deal with "unwanted 
elements" (sexual harrassers (sp?), heterosexist taunters, etc) at our 
events - meaning, we'd better be prepared to escort them out.  

i had to deal with a situation once at Your Sisters' House where a guy 
was harassing his ex-girlfriend.  i had been leaving, but i stayed around 
and asked the woman if she needed any help, and stayed around until she 
felt safe.  i also told her if she had any more trouble to talk to one of 
the other ysh staff, trusting that they could deal.  i guess my point is 
just that shit like this can happen anywhere.> >

And besides, a real live going-off rave is about a million times more
fun and perhaps even more "spiritual" (if that's your cup of meat) than
any recent dead show. Thought I can't say, since I haven't been to any
ones recently (i usually just dance in the parking lot) because every
time I go, I ask myself why I bothered. Hell, nowadays I'd probably get
more vibe whiffing the toxic hair-goo from de lady-in-front-of-me's
bouffant at the Neal Diamond show...

Lately I feel that Jerry has become one of those disneyland
audioanimatrinic-lincoln-speaks characters and the overall show is
dragging and lagging. On the other hand, I've been to some screamingly
headmelting epiphanies/shows in the early '80's e.g. Greek Theater at
Berkeley, Frost Amphitheater @ Stanford, H.J.Kaiser in Oakland, etc.
and of course my first dead show (10/92 @ Frost) where I caught a real
nice "vibe" from a relatively small crowd of 10,000 partiers ...
sometimes I haul out a soundboard tape or two to remind me of the
intensity they were capable of.  (Please bind, gag, and hog-tie me
before I start soundin' like yer grampa, ok?)

Today, I'll take raving, thank you very much.

PS: If you want to check out a Rock/Jazz/Blues/Funk/R&B-oriented group
that completely blows the Dead away (and from whom the Dead
took/popularized many a song/sound) check out "The funky Meters" on Sat
March 25 at the Fillmore. They are truly incredible, and I'll never
forget the funky stanky booty wagglin' communal vibe (to say nothing
about the amazing amount of spleefs being passed between strangers in
the audience) of  the Meters shows at the Covered Wagon in '89, or
their shows in New Orleans at the Jazz fest, etc. I can't promise this
will be the same, because they're missing original members from the
original "The Meters", e.g. guitarist Leo Nocentelli and original
drummer Joseph "Ziggy" Modeliste (one of the great new orleans
drummers). Fortunately Russell Batiste (from a great new orleans
drumming family, and it shows) is an incredibly funky beatmaker, and
Art Neville (keyboards, also a key player in the Neville Brothers) and
George Porter Jr (Bass) will do just fine, if they're feeling "on" and
haven't partied too much. Hell, these guys were on their way up up and 
up until they started partying too much during their first big break
opening up for the rolling stones US tour in '74. ... Now they're back,
older, wiser, and funkier...  These guys pretty much define funk,
especially of the down-south new orleans, stylee so if yer into it,
Niels-bob sez check it out (and play "name the Meters sample used in a
lot of modern funk/dance/rap oriented music").

PPS: I'm unfortunately going to be out of town for both F&F this
weekend and the Meters show I talked about above...

I'm sure most of you were at Let Freedom Rave, but if anyone attended 
"Freedom:  A Virtual Reality Celebration with Timothy Leary" on that 4th could 
you please let me know.  I am interested in what it was like, what you felt 
the message was, how was the vibe and the role that Leary played.

This makes me sick, the way you blame it on security, as if it was their
fault.  WHAT DID YOU DO ABOUT IT?  Don't ever put blame on someone else
when you did nothing yourself.

        My personal favorite trippy movie has to be "Forbidden Planet".
I'm glad "Yellow Submarine" was mentioned...  also I saw an animated
"Alice in Wonderland" one morning that really made me wonder what the
makers were thinking of...  nothing dr. dodgson (?) hadn't thought of
I'm sure tho...  very trippy ideas to pump into the saturday morning 
cartoon crowd.

Not to diss the many cool australians out there, but far too many of
the australians that I have met while travelling have come off as
complete racists. To say nothing about the way australia treats/talks
about the aborigines, or the low social status of aborigines in
Australia. (I'm not saying amerikkka treats it's american indians,
eskimo, or black population any better, really...)

W/r/t the message below, perhaps there's not a lot of blacks at raves
because they're economically locked out, or wouldn't be welcome by the
average austrialian? Or perhaps the aborigines are sick of all those
damn digeridoo samples :-) and prefer their own communal/ancestral
dancing rituals to raves??

FYI, the movie "Romper Stomper" (produced by my cousin D.Sharf in
Australia) is an interesting, though grittily **disturbing** and
**realistic** examination of racism in Australia, though the racism is
perpetrated mostly on asians via the nazi skinheads that "star" in this
movie. It is available on video tape in the US, though they actually
edited out some of the Sex & Violence for the US video release (???). I
guess some censor got confused between the concepts of "cinema verite"
and "dangerous ideas" -- then again, perhaps too many morons in the US
would take this movie at face value, as an avocation of the nazi
skinhead lifestyle. THis movie does not glorify violence and racism....
It deglamorizes, and magnifies the stupidity of people caught in that
trap....

I'll just shut up now, because reality doesn't have anything to do with
movies, no matter what that mo-ron Newt Gingrich has to say about it.
(Hey amerikkka -- you all should watch "Soilent Green" to learn about
why de-regulation of food products is a good idea -- think of the profits
man! the prophets!). :-)

Great comments, Niels.  I tend to agree about the Dead, though I still
go quite a lot.  There have been some excellent Dead shows over the
last year; I think Sunday at Vegas (despite the heat) and Sunday at
Eugene were the real standouts for me last year.  But though I still
like the scene and have many friends, the shows and the scene are very
same-y these days, and the outdoor parking lot scene has totally
deteriorated into a messy, ugly, depressing thing as anyone who wandered
around the lot during the Atomic Pig this time could see.  The lift 
I got after leaving the show and walking through the lot and getting
back to our little sound system scene there was palpable.  (On the other
hand, here in Portland we expect that at least for one glorious weekend
at the end of May we can make the old vending/hangout Dead scene work
like it should, of course with the addition of suitable sound system
and DJ enhancements :)

I'm pleased to hear the Meters are playing around again, and bummed
seriously that I'll probably be up on the Russian River for Tribal Future
that weekend.  

Niels talks about sounding like yer grampa, well, maybe I'm *in* that
category.  The second record I ever bought was in 1969 and it was
the 45 single "Cissy Strut" by the Meters which is still totally cool.
It was sampled -- hell, practically copied completely -- by the Stone
Roses for "Fools Gold," and you know how cool that is (although it's
getting so old-fashioned I saw someone dissing one of the Hardkisses
for playing it at a party on the east coast recently!).

As an aside, the *first* record I ever bought, right before the Meters,
was "Time Is Tight" by Booker T and the MGs.  They were the house band
for the Stax label in Memphis and put out a bunch of very popular
instrumentals under that name too.  And here's where it all comes
full circle.  Just about my most recent purchase is a 12" called
"Love Is The Key" by Blind Truth on Platinum Records (a UK label, and
I bought it at Platinum Records, the Portland DJ store :), with remixes
by DJ Camacho and Coke, the ubiquitous Danny Tenaglia and . . . Booker T!

c u in the future

Okay, as long as you're going to mention trippy animation, does anyone
remember the animated feature from the 70's called "Watership Down" with all
the bunny rabbits with the british accents?  I went back and watched that a
few months ago and besides being very surreal, it has quite a powerful
message in it too.

I've just heard through the grapevine that the full moon is 
tonight instead of Fri.  Is this true?  I heard from a pretty 
reliable source. 

I really hope it's Friday.  A lot of people I know have made plans 
to attend Fri. but won't be able to if it's tonight.

I wouldn't go off so hard okn the boy now...maybe you are a big guy.  But

are a little less mature and experienced than some people.  We were in 
teh restaurant when this guy starts harassing a bum and gets more and 
mkore aggressive.  In the end he assaulted the man who was the victim 
while my friends and myself watched not wanting to get involved.  It was 
obvious who was the victim, being he was somewhat helpless and very 
timid...but in the end you find yourself thinking what you could have 
done, but will it make things worse or better you'll never know, would 
two or t hree people have gotten beat up instead of one...maybe the

Excuse you, but i was never around *while she was getting raped*.  i 
didn't find out until afterwards when my friends were trying to talk her 
down right before she tweaked out.  and anyways, that's all besides the 
point.  why the fuck shouldn't i blame security?  don't you think that if 
it's your fuckin job to provide *security* then you should maybe do your 
job instead of just being a jerk??  i sure do.  i think 100% that 
security should be waaaayy more responsible in this type of situation 
than small little raver kid.  sorry that i'm not superman and shit.

Just in case you haven't heard, the full moon party is tonight.  I've
just heard from a number of sources.

I'm not sure what the policy is about posting information about the 
location of the party, but I'll take my chances.  This is what I just
heard from a reputable source (whether it proves to be right time will
tell)....

That's interesting, considering the full moon is tomorrow night, 
Thursday the 16th. Check the newspaper.

	There is a Full Moon Rave tonight.
	The party will be at a remote outside location along the coast.
	Reach out and touch someone and you will easily find the party.
	Please don't arrive at the site before 2 am, really, all you
	will do by coming early is draw the police.

	If you do find the party, please don't post exact directions
	on the net, it will just bring 3000 people and the whole thing will
	get shut down.




		Pray to the Moon when she is round,

		Luck with you shall then abound,

		Whatever you seek for shall be found,

		In sea or sky, or solid ground.

While I can understand the need for secrecy do you think you could be a 
bit more specific then along the coast?  Also, please bear in mind that 
the "devil slide"area of route 1 is closed so I would imagine that some 
people may need directions.  You help is apprciated.

 That was "Alice" , directed by Jan Svankmajer. I first saw this surreal
interpretation of the Alice story at on of the sfraves-related berkeley
parties near the Berkeley campus. I was able to rent it from a Blockbuster -
not all the Blockbuster stores carry it.

 Highly recommended for chill room use! May be too distracting for the 
main dancefloor.

Hello SFRAVERS!
 
I'm new to E-mail and decided to join this discussion group.  I LOVE
high energy dance music of all sorts.  I'm from Chicago (the Inner
City) and I do lean a little more towards House music.  But Techno,
Trance, and especially Hardcore really does it for me.
 
Right now I'm at St. Norbet College in De Pere, WI.  I'm going crazy up
here.  Looking to leave real soon.  A couple of years ago, I went to
San Fransisco.  I luved it!  Right now I am thinking about finding some
way to san fran.  Next to Chicago, San Fransisco is where I want to be.
 The music lives in these cities.  Maybe in June, we will see.
 
 Hope to here from some cool people real soon!

Yes, I was at both Let Freedom Rave (dope-ass party!) and Freedom/Virtual
Reality.  Well, the main problem with the Virtual Reality party was lack of
people! (think everyone was crashed out from the night before)... All the
virtual reality stuff was cool, in addition to the whole production itself
(lot's of cool stuff to DO at this party) but there was absolutely ZERO
vibe... sorry!  The whole timothy leary thing did not cut it either..... 
looked like they were having some technical difficulties.... when he came
up on that huge video wall nobody could hear what he was saying...... nice
try but no c-gar!

peace-out

Pete

I just thought of a show I haven't seen since I was about 6 - it was called
Les Contes de la Rive (stories of the riverbank) and it was all live action
rodents!!!!!  There was a hamster named Hammy, a guinea pig named Grandpere
and a white rat named Moustache and they all lived together in a waterwheel
house.  Grandpere had a plane, Moustache had a diving bell ...  does anyone
else remember this?  Or was it just some weird Canadian thing I grew up
with?

peace

I hate to say this, but after reviewing the movie list that Brian compiled
(kudos Brian), if flaming the Star Wars trilogy hadn't sparked this whole
thread, it probably would have been suggested.

You can't please all the people, all the time.  Unless...

We set-up 64 projectors and show them all at the same time.  Wouldn't that
be unique?!  Shit, the solution was so obvious.  

Turning from one to the other,

Tony

P.S.  Brian, what about the Simpsons???!!!

hey, is there anyone out there with a video mixing rig or an amiga?

'cause.....

   we could take each movie in the raver's list, find 2-5 minnits ov
     the verry weirdest segments, and splice/mix'em together to create
       a screaming video collage; it could be hours long and intensely
         watchable, if done correctly....

   howzabout each person volunteering to take one movie, copy their
     favorite segment onto a short tape, and then sending the tapes
       in to the video guru with the mixing equipment????

  Xogenix wins my vote for worst timed techno-party of the month -- head to
head with Black Dog on Friday.  Could be real cool, though.  The
lighting/video/decor is going to be intense -- very focused and
techno-fetishistic.  The dj lineup should be:
     Minor (me) 9-11
     Graeme LaPaix 11-12
     Tim 12-2?
     Mars 2-4?
  I'm planning on playing my favorite blend of dark growling trance.  Tim &
Mars have got a bunch of really fast (150-160bpm) psychedelic hard techno.
 Hope there are enough technoheads in town to pack both of these parties.
 Xogenix, like Black Dog, though, is 21+.  The voicemail # is 415-541-5019,
the flyers are worth finding -- circuit boards, vacuum tubes, & capacitors
labeled with the number.  We'll see ...

Actually, I just remembered one of the trippiest movies ever, that had me 
rolling on the floor laughing... 

		The Frog Prince

		with Kermit the Frog

There's this one scene where all these frogs are singing, except they're 
puppets, and they're moving around in this strange fashion, kinda 
in-your-face-I'm-a-frog... well... you have to see it for yourself...

Oh... and what about for trippy TV, I don't know why I didn't think of 
this before...

		The Banana Splits

I mean come on... the original Trip TV Show.

Greetings Friends!

I wanted to take this opportunity to share a few, important, last minute
thoughts with you on the upcoming party :)

Please remember that this is an *underground* event; hanging out on in
front, playing car stereos loud, running naked up the street ;) etc. can
really kill stuff like this, so please, please, please consider the
environemnt and your actions carefully... we really need everyone's help in
pulling this off.

Also, we will be using a map point, so even if for some reason you know
where the party is, *please* use the map point :)

We do have a limited capacity of around 750 including crew, so please get
to the map point early, it will open at 9:30 and be shut down when we reach
capacity.

As many of you know it has alway been a primary goal of F&F to be ultra low
cost. The cost of this party is from $5 to whatever you can afford and/or
feel like contributing, however no-one will be turned away (from the map
point) for an honest lack of funds.

On the other hand, F&Fs are *always* benefits, and *everyone* involved --
djs, musicians, artists, staff -- all work for free. In this case we are
benefitting two very worthy causes (info on them will be available on-site)
so if you can contribute more than $5, please do.

So nice that the sun has come out to add a little support to the spring
theme :) Looking very forward to seing you all saturday!

:)

take it easy
ethan

When I see a native american raver, we will be able to discuss whether or
not the american rave movement is racist or not. So far, I don't see any,
let alone any discussion as to why not.

How about:

non-racist:  holds no prejudices for/against any ethnic or racial group

Does this work?

 Hey I'm working on something along those lines but I don't have all the
 movies together yet so I won't unvail these efforts at the current
 F&F...

 I do have more than an hour of old B&W stuff Dr. Strangelove, Dracula,
 Invisible man, 50 foot woman, Killers from space ....

 We try to please - and I am taking notes on the favorite movies....

I did not take offense to David Dei's remark about Native American
Ravers.  I would like him and everyone else to know that I'm am half
Native American and half Puerto Rican.  When I get to San Fran you will
get a chance to see a Menominee/Peurto Rican Raver.  I plan to have
loads of fun with my life.

Hello everyone, long time no talk to much less see.  I really just wanted
to continue lurking, but I knew that eventually all it would take to bring
me out was something like the above.  Considering the political climate and
the anti-non-white sentiments rampant in this country at this time, I have
no other recourse than to fight.  Especially against stupid remarks, no
matter how innocent, like the one above.

I don't really think Crunch understood the implications of his words.
Crunch has never shown ME any sign of predjudice, although I know he has
some like we all do.  But this insistence on the code word gangster,
gangsta, etc. is very tiring.  And quite suprising considering the realtive
high IQ's of the folx here on the list.

Listen up, the word is a code word for anybody who looks like me (African
American), or people who have a relatively high melanin content as compared
to the average European (read Latino/Hispanic).  It is not used to describe
gangs of Whites, or people of European ancestry.  That's how it is.  You
may decide to use this word, and if so, you should expect that unless you
start naming particular gang names, that I, and others, may take offense to
it.  Use your words as you choose, but consider WHO you're really talking
about.  And be prepared for the consequences of your actions.

There has been much discussion about "gansta types" by defining those
qualities of dress that TV has pumped into some peoples head.  This has
been the way people have skated around the real meaning of the code word.
Fact is people use it to describe people of color exclusively.  You may not
mean it in such a fashion, but that is how it's currently used.  Today I am
dressed in baggies, a xxlarge sweatshirt, and Dickies (the ORIGINAL "gang"
shoe).  To most, I would be dressed like a "gangsta".  My income, values,
and current job, dictate that I am as yuppie as you can get.  Yet the only
thing people will see as I walk across the street is that I am dressed like
a "gangsta", and I am black.  I spend half of my life fighting these
predjudices, and the other half in fear of persecution by those who throw
around labels so easily.  This sucks...unless you are a minority, you would
not immediately understand.  But I digress...

I am sick and tired of black/latino being associated with violence and
general mayhem.  It's the same shit many of your grandparents used to
beleive about blacks and other minorities just two generations ago.  I see
the vestiges of racism are still strong, and vibrant, even in "our" scene.
Truly sickening...

Look Crunch & others who insist on using this stoopid word without any
backup as to what you're talking about.  You ain't met no fucking REAL
gangstah's.  They ain't got time to go to raves, and hunt you out.  You
ain't got nothing for them, much less them for you.  If you did run across
a few gangstah's consider yourself lucky to be alive, and that you were not
part of some ridiculous initiation ritual.  I doubt you'd be alive to talk
about it.  You ain't seen no gangstah at no raves.  You've seen some youths
who got bored, like many do, and decided to take their boredom out on
you/your event, whatever.  This will continue to happen as the youth of
this country are cut out from even the basic liberties of free assembly.
But rest assured, if they were gangs, many would not be alive to talk about
it.  So please give this bullshit a rest.

As for the "vibe" of Australia...maybe you should spend some time amongst
the ORIGINAL peoples who are shut out from their system Crunch.  Maybe you
oughta read some history about the places you visit Crunch.  Just as
Amerikkka engaged in genocide so that you could have a Full Moon party
without the natives getting restless, that Great Rock in the Pacific was
invavded by the dregs of England, and subsequently settled through equally
genocidal methods.  There is little doubt why they call Australia
Amerikkka's "Sister Nation/Country".  The correlation you draw about
gangstas and blacks is equally disturbing.  Especially since the most
deadly gang is the cops, the Congress, and of course our President. You're
52, and the signs that you have not outgrown your generations prejudices
are obvious.  I take complete offense at your characterizations of blacks
as gangstah's and demand a public apology for your outrageous statements.
I would also hope you learn something about the country you're visiting
other than partying with the opressors.

Rinse your brain....

Peace out,
John

=======
Since I started talking:  I hope all goes well for F&F this weekend.
Congrats on the anniversary of your event! May you guys and your Friends &
Family have many many more!!!!

Peace out one more time! :)

EXCUSE ME?  what exactly are you saying here?  are you implying that 
unless someone jumps in "to the rescue" i will think they're an ass?  i 
understand that there are times when people can and cannot intervene, but 
if one cannot intervene one goes to get someone to help.  one does NOT 
continue "partying."  

anyway, i'm not saying that anyone should feel "guilty."  guilt 
accomplishes nothing.  you learn from your mistakes, if any were made, 
and go on.  what's important AFTER an attack is to help the survivor, 
warn others and hold those responsible accountable.  and if you're doing 
security at a party, one of your responsibilities is to keep the space 
safe, which means intervention, whether it's yourself and others or 
calling the cops if need be, tho' i hate to say it.  

in love and @,
monicat

I beg to differ - up here in Vancouver, myself and my friends use the 
word "gansta" to describe ANYONE, regardless of race or color, who acts 
or dresses in the manner commonly associated (in this area) with real 
gangster behavior.  Of course, having no real gangs here like they do in 
LA and other big cities, our perception of gangsters is created by movies 
and television.  I personally have referred to whites as "gangstas", and 
will continue to do so, as it's a word that seems appropriate and one 
which these "gangstas" refer to themselves as.  I know when I say it, 
there are no racial connotations implied...

That's how it's currently used by SOME people, not all.

Just a little bit harsh, don't you think?  I'm sure Crunch and others 
don't claim to have met any REAL gangstahs...the fact is, some people try 
very hard to cultivate this image, and wear the label of "gangsta" with 
pride, even if they have no clue either as to what REAL gangstahs are 
like.  Being a minority member myself, I understand your anger, but in 
this case I think it's a little misdirected.

Genocide: the systematic extermination or destruction of an entire people 
or national group.
The very fact that American natives are around to fight for their rights 
today indicates to me that genocide wasn't carried out.  Yes, the 
treatment they've recieved has been abysmal, but I think genocide goes a 
bit too far...

Oh please!  Now, like many others on this list, I have problems with 
police now and then, but I'm still pretty fucking happy that they're 
around.

Yeah, and there are still Jews in Europe, so I guess Hitler was a nice guy.
OK, that's harsh, but be real, we're living in a world that has more than
its fair share of assholes. You don't think distributing blankets infected
with smallpox or forcing entire tribes of people on thousand mile marches
with hardly any food or water was genocide? Maybe I misunderstood you.

Sorry to be negative, and I'm not just aiming this at Jim, but I have a hard 
time reading some of the stuff I've seen on the list lately. We've got a 
lively thread about the environmental impact of meth labs when the worst speed 
freak in the world probably fuels a fraction of the damage to the environment 
that is done by an average automobile owner.

I want to go on, but I won't...

Obrave: Hope there's time to go out to a party soon. I'm having trouble 
matching the list up with my experience of all the wonderful parties I've
been to in the past. Maybe I'll get lucky next time I'm out and be able to 
gripe with some of you face to face ;)

If genocide isn't the right word than I don't know what word you would use
to describe what happened to the Native American people.  What word would
use to describe the death of the 10 million people who lived here before we
did.  It wasn't a complete extermination of every Native American but it
was an extermination of Native American culture and ideals.  The US did
more than treat Native Americans abysmally, they took their land away, took
their children and put them in boarding schools, and they took their
culture away.  Today Native American reservations are among the poorest
areas in the US.  You must come to terms with the fact that the United
States was built on the graves and backs of the people who lived here
before.  We broke  every treaty we signed whenever it was suitable to us,
we must understand what happened, otherwise as the ol' cliche goes "those
that do not learn from history are doomed to repeat it".  Please read up on
your history, it is importent, real peoples were killed, and real people
are living in complete poverty due to our racist culture.

LOVE,
gabe

John is correct,  I certainly didn't intend to offend anyone.... Sometimes
I don't get enough time to proof read material I intend to post.   Because
obtaining home phone access is very problematic for me,  untill I get
my OWN phone on 28th of March.   When phone access opportunities arise,
I take them.   Thus is why my postings are irratic.

>As for the "vibe" of Australia...maybe you should spend some time amongst

Well,  John,  it is my intention to meet some of these ORIGIONAL people
of Australia,  as plans are now being made to visit Kakadoo park,  
Alice Springs,  and get to know the locals.

>Maybe you oughta read some history about the places you visit Crunch.

I already have,   and spent a long time getting to know the AusRavers
over Email 8 months before coming over.

Anyway,  I want to apologize for anything I may have said on the above
topic and lets start talking about how cool the new Friends and Family
will be,  and hope that the flooding clears before the Russian River
thingie get cancelled.    I haven't got all cought up reading the mailing
list,  because my opportunity for getting this up here is going away
in about 15 minutes,  so I'm now shortening this,   and look for some
GREAT reports on:

Friday March 17th
         -Quandamoora (Sea Spirit)  by Green Acres
          Doof J's: Black, Amino Acid, Mandy (Byron Bay), Abel, Nick (Prana)
          Live: D3 (Dij-Drum-Dj), Gyrostatics, Cosmic Free Way.
          Doofcore Decore by mother nature
          $15 atd.  venue info: 88.9 or flyer.
          
Sat - "The Happiest  people in the world"

My proble so far,  is that I'm trying to obtain some Vinyl with some
locally produced stuff to bring back with me.    It is unfortuniate
that I found a huge MUSIC GAP between here and the SF scene.

I got Tracey some air time on a univerity station om AM on 1008Khz
(The use 9 khz spacing down here).  It only had 300 watts but covered
most of Canberra.   I also got it some airplay on an alternate station
called "Skid row radio".   While I was on the air,  I wasa talking about
the SF scene.   The station had no taping facilities available,   so hope
to hook up with someone who might have taped it off the air.   It's
on 88.9 Mhz,  FM.

On the crowded bus trip back to Syney,  I got cought up with my SFRave
mail.

Gotta go...

Ah, yes, as a part-time punk I can tell you that there's a lot of punk/rave
cross over.  Even lots of straight-edge punx in the rave scene (I was one once).
Queers should note that there are 3 different queer-punk events going on
Friday alone - including Green Day faves Pansy Division at 924 Gilman.
I heard that local punk gods Rancid may incorporate a jungle influence on
their next recording.  Not surprising to me - it's not a huge leap from ska
to jungle.

Quick note to SF people:  See ya at F&F!  Let me know what you think of my
new Netscape 1.1-enhanced page!  See below for URL.

Wow, lots of out-of-towners on the list these days!  Welcome.

Not much hardcore in these here parts west of the Sierra.  The house and
trance scenes are tops, though.

You can also subscribe to mailing lists serving the Midwest (mw-raves) and
the UK (uk-dance).  Gopher hyperreal.com for details.

To get Uk-dance, send a message to listserv@tqmcomms.co.uk with the word
s*bscribe the first word in the body, substituting a u for the *.

I'll be in the UK for Tribal Gathering, but I realize it's a long way from
Newcastle.

Hmm, good mags, I see them occasionally. You could probably get an answer on

Sorry, no one can do that for you (although you *can* get help).

Basically, you have to experience and root out your mental conditioning.

   SOLAR CEREMONIES SET FOR MARCH 21, 1995 
 ELDERS CALL FOR WORLDWIDE CONVERGENCE OF SPIRITUAL INTENT

 Please consider this message as a call for human beings to unite in
spiritual intent for peace, unity, and awakening.   March 21, 1995 is a
critical opportunity to strive through prayer and ceremony to bridge the
gaps between the continents, religions, cultures, and races for all ages. 

   The moment of Sunrise on March 21, 1995  marks an important opportunity
for prayer and ceremony according to the Mayan people of the Yucatan
Peninsula, Mexico -- as with the event called Harmonic Convergence on
August 16, 1987, which was also identified via their calendars.   Mayan
Daykeepers and traditional elders say their sacred texts and calendars
identify March 21 as especially important for respectful attention from
human beings in the Americas and around the world.  They have asked that
all who feel called to do so take a stand for unity on this date, and
strive to awaken to fulfill their sacred destiny: "to stand in peace as
true sons and daughters of the Cosmic Light."  It is time, Traditional
Maya Elders say, to live out our true solar destinies in good relation
with the whole circle of life. 

   By the use of their ancient calendar cycles -- widely recognized as
more sophisticated and accurate than the Gregorian calendars now used by
the Western world -- the Maya appreciate that the 1995 Vernal Equinox, and
the Sunrise following it, are the completion of a teaching that they have
held and passed on for many generations.  The moment of Sunrise marks the
end of two cycles of Kal'Tun (two cycles of 260 years), and initiates a
time when ancient and hidden knowledge is to be reawakened. The Maya say
they understand it as the end of the "age of belief" and the start of 
"the age of knowledge."  Don Hunbatz Men, Mayan teacher and Daykeeper,
emphasizes that this information is for everyone, not just the Maya.

The Path of the Sun and Mayan Prophecy

 Watching from the Earth,  the Sun travels 182 days to the North and
returns 182 days to the South again every  year.  This is the cycle of the
Solstices. The midpoint of this cycle is another cycle of East and West
called the Equinoxes. On the Equinoxes, the Sun crosses a center point and
makes an exact 90-degree angle directly over the Pyramid of  Ku'Kulkan 
(El Castillo)  at the sacred site of Chichen Itza on Mexico's Yucatan
peninsula -- a place that some say represents the turtle's head on the
continent known for millennia as Turtle Island (North America).  The
relationship of the Sun to the Earth at this sensitive point creates the
world-famous phenomenon of a dramatic shadow of 7 triangles.  The
triangles of solar light and shadow  represent the potential awakening of
7 centers of the human body --  the wheels of subtle spiritual light that,
in the Orient,  are called Chakras.   This natural event happens every
Vernal and Autumnal Equinox, but it is in the Spring of 1995 that the
reawakening of the cosmic human may  be activated. This is indicated in
the paraphrased Mayan prophecy below, as given by Hunbatz Men.

 In the year 1475, before the arrival of the Spanish, The Supreme Maya
Council revealed the long-held vision of an ancient Solar Grandmother
named X'Nuuk'K'in  that a calendar cycle of twice the Kal'Tun of 260 years
had to go by in order for the Solar Culture to flourish again for the
benefit of all humanity.  In the spring of 1995, this 520-year period will
be completed. Thus, 1995 is a decisive year, the prophecy advises, and the
human race will have to enter the path of cosmic light if it is to remain
a thinking species.  Humans will have to seek the path of initiation on
Earth and in Heaven. "Through Solar Initiation human beings will be able
to see the luminosity of the Great Spirit...through Solar Initiation, the
sleeping body of humankind can be awakened... Hunab K'u (Creator) will
flash like lightning that will pierce the shadows that envelop the human
race. Let us prepare to receive the light of knowledge."

 Many traditional elders among the Maya understand this event as an
opportunity for initiation into a luminous consciousness -- the awakening
of  humanity into an Age of Knowledge (Itza Age).  Via the magnetic grid
of energy that envelops planet Earth, and the many sensitive spots on the
Earth often referred to as Sacred Sites, the elders say the solar
ceremonies in Chichen Itza will anchor a unifying intent to activate
humanity.  This intention can be strengthened and magnified by people who
come together elsewhere around the world in prayer and ceremony, at sacred
sites as well as in their backyards and public gathering places.  This, it
is said,  will initiate a potent healing process for all.

  Traditional Maya spiritual elders will make prayers for peace, unity,
and awakening on March 21, in fellowship with a group of Tibetan Lamas and
also with pilgrims of all nations and faiths.   Sisters and Brothers who
are unable join in physical form may join in Spirit.  A Council of 
traditional Mayan Elders has asked people of good heart--no matter their
race or their spiritual tradition--to join in prayer  at the Vernal
Equinox, and at Sunrise, local time, on the morning of March 21, 1995.  We
are asked to unite   with the understanding that we are all connected, and
all live in the same house: the house of Mother Earth. We all breathe the
same air, and drink the same water.  We must live in honor and respect. 
They ask all to pray -- in whatever tradition calls their hearts and minds
 -- for peace, unity, and awakening.

 Letters of prayer and good intention may be sent to: The Center for Mayan
Studies APDO 7-014 Merida, 7 Yucatan, Mexico. These letters will be
anchored in a sacred site during this ceremony.

A Solar Meditation You May Wish to Try

 Prayers and good intentions from all traditions are welcomed to help
create a unified field of spiritual intention on March 21.  If you wish,
you are welcome to perform the simple ceremony outlined below, as given by
spiritual elders among the Maya.

 In their tradition, the Maya had and have an intimate relationship with
the Sun. They understand that the information/energy we require to live
comes from the Creator through the Sun.  They further understand that the
Sun can help to heal our physical and emotional illnesses. In these times
when humanity receives so much information and energy from sources other
than the Sun, the elders say, we must begin to remember how to work again
with the Sun.   Everyone is encouraged to initiate solar meditations and
related events at Sacred Sites or in the areas where they live at Sunrise
- March 21, 1995. Below is a ceremony you can perform in unity with others
from around the world at that time.

 Face the rising Sun and begin to meditate. With respect, ask the Creator
in your own way (Hunab K'u, or "One Giver of Movement and Measure" in the
language of the Maya who hold the knowledge of  Chichen Itza) for
permission to reenter cosmic memory. Ask to be reawakened to the ancient
knowledge of the cosmos. As the Sun begins to rise look directly at it. 
Please use discretion here:  just one second of pure sunlight directly in
the eyes is enough, more can be harmful.  Then close your eyes and begin
to say the name of the SUN in your language, or in the Mayan language
(K'IN).  Catch your Spirit by holding your hands out in front of your face
as if you were holding a sphere.  As Om-m-m-m  is a name of the Universe,
K'IN is a name of the SUN.  It sounds like, "K'ieeeeeennn" with a distinct
'E' sound.  You may need to practice this. When you do it properly you
will hear the sound of the Sun in your ears and in your head.

  Say K'IN  7 times into your hands for your body,  7 times for your
spirit, and 7 times for the healing and awakening of the Earth and
humanity. You will feel the energy in your hands, and hear the sound of
the SUN in your heart.  Now offer the blessings of your Spirit on the
Earth by bending down and placing your palms flat upon the Earth. Allow
your Spirit to enter the Earth and send your blessings and intentions to
walk on Earth in a sacred manner that will awaken yourself and others into
right living once again.  So Traditional Elders among the Maya have asked.

sounds like an easy distinction;

 anti-racist is a racist against racists; assumes all racists are

 non-racist lets peeple be peeple...

i'm the character whut started the meth environmental thread;

hell, i'd love to suggest that everyone on the list stops driving their
  cars and solely rely on public transportation and bicycles, but what
    real impact doya think that would have?  
not a lot more than getting meth users to demand cleaner production
  facilities, yesno?

No genocide WAS carried out, right down to biological warfare (small pox
infested blankets), The very fact that American Natives are around to fight
for their rights today has more to say about the strength and resiliance of
the tribes and their culture then on the actions of the good ol' USA.

Yes until about 30 years ago, it was ILLEGAL (yes illegal) to practice
or instruct people in certain native american religons and I'm not just
talking about the peyote rituals.  To my knowledge they were the only group
to have their freedom of religon rights totally ignored.

Yes, EVERY Treaty with every Native American nation has been broken by the US
yet our culture has the audacity to coin terms like "indian giving"

Yes especially people who call themselves Ravers, 

Did you know that a little over 100 years ago, people were murdered by the
US army for dancing?  Yes this is correct, maybe someone on the list
who knows the story better than I do can tell it because I think it
is really relevent from a vibe/history point of view of what power
and fear sacred dance can bring about.  Can someone (who knows) 
recount the story of the Ghost Dance and the events that lead upto an 
included the massarce at Wounded Knee. ?

There will probably be a big flood of responses to this one, so I hope 
I'm not just adding excess traffic to the list.... but Galen's Continium 
has to be one of my all time favorites (his Pacifica tape is great too). 
The most recent tape I have that I really like is Carlos' UFO (powerful 
acid/trance).  DJ Dan's Weed Wacker is another favorite along with 
Dutch's Escapades in Trance.

Hope this helps.....I'll look forward to seeing everyone at F&F.

I just got a copy of Continuum from a friend.  It is soooo damn good!  
Makes me feel like I'm dancing on a beach...totally cool.

Being a diehard Tony fan, I must say that ALL his tapes are incredible.  
I got a copy of his set from Kindness in Portland recorded on Feb. 25th.  
*Hard* core acid trance that makes you feel like you're not even on earth 
anymore.  It holds you hostage with a steel grip. :) ILIKEIT!!

I have to step in. yes, funny punch is a problem, you should ask first.
yes, MAOIs are bad news if used wrong, but acid is safe with them,
phsiologically, see, acid, shrooms and dmt do fine with MAOIs. Yer friend
just couldn't handle the stronger trip created thru the yohimbe.

Yohimbe ALONE is great, if you avoid those foods. Take 250mg vit.C 1/2
before, and anothe 250 with it(prevents puking and makes it smoother), and
you will either dance and feel great or toss in bed and do the humpty
horiz-dance forever. I reccommend it, but only after someone has read the
warnings in psychedelic shamanism. I feel the cloud 9 people are too lax on
warnin when they sell it, and yes, people should not distribut it at
parties on that massive a scale. Someone might lie and take E or speed and
find their lungs full of fluid and their body full of death. And Geraldo
will be able to do another special on us.

When I handed out Rue at F&F, it was only a pinch, not enuf to have a MAoI
effect, just enuf to make teeth floresce in the blacklight, and only I
myslef took enuf of it alone to experience its pure effect. If someone
wants to mess around with an MAOI, the should bring it themselves.  If one
gives it out, like at the party you mentioned, shit will happen.

INFORMED consent was lacking, i guess. Glad you helped yer friend out, that
really shows how much you care for them. Hope if I ever lose it, that I
will have good friends around, and won't hurt anyone either physically or
emotionally.  But about F&F, why don't you work the door with me, I'll sign
yer cast! You could do the Ski Diva thing.....:)

I dunno, since Maui is gone from SFR, I'll have to defend the white stuff.
Look, doesn't it seem like a little too much media hype over drugs again?
Our life-styles of a disposable society creates more individual pollution
than any meth lab. Our detergents, our soaps, our huge wasting of water,
all that plastic and cardboard and glass that our food comes in, we are
poisoning our world and now we point our finger at meth labs???

So pot smoking leads to carpet spraying of ozark forests and coke to
massive deforestation in Columbia, thru our government's war on drugs.
Eating processed or chain-food burgers leads to amazon forest being
replaced by quick-fix cattle ranchers, chicken to massive animal abuse,
milk to erosion due to soy plantations in the third world to supply dairy
feed, jeans to exploitation of immigrant women, stereos and shoes to sweat
shops in Taiwan, and now the internet is the vehicle of kiddie-porn and
bestiality, so let's log off.

Prolly most things are more complex than some reporter without a clue and
deadline to meet.

But I could be wrong:)

I would strongly recommend any tapes put together by Billy Nasty. I am 
over here in Santa Cruz for a year from England and have brought with me 
about 20 or so of Britains finest - Sasha, John Digweed, Danny Rampling, 
Jeremy Healy and the cream of the crop is Billy Nasty. So if you see any 
of his tapes around a purchase would certainly be in order especially the 
Journeys By DJ one. If you want you could send me some blank tapes and I 
could record you a few.

Hi there SF Ravers,
 
When I get to San Fran, I want to check out the hottest spots.  Not the
mainstream tourist attractions, but the little places that makes SF
magical.  Shops, streets, restaurants, etc.
 
I would also appreciate any ideas or opinions about clubs that I should
check out when I get there.
 
I would appreciate the help from the wiser bunch.

About genocide and (farther down) raves:

My full name is Jocelyn Ward Cordell. Ward is a family name,
derived from Mary Jane Ward, the english name of the 
daughter of White Cloud, former chief of the Creek tribe 
of northwestern Florida/southeastern Alabama. 

When General Jackson moved his Union troops southward through 
this area to preserve the union, he/the union delivered an ultimatum 
to the Creek tribe to leave their land. As an agricultural 
tribe, they asked to be allowed to remain on their land until 
their crops could be harvested. Their refusal to immediately comply 
was termed "hostile" and they were killed. There are no full-blooded 
Creek left. There is, however, an honorary statue of General Jackson
in the heart of the Vieux Carre in New Orleans. 

My mother told me about my history first when I was fairly 
young (about 8). when I asked her to recount it later (about 13),
she denied it and denied having ever told me about it. Then 
when i was 17, she suggested I apply to colleges as a Native 
American (i didn't). Who can I ask about my history now?

What happens if we see genocide as a socio-psychological event 
instead of a physical one?

Despite the fact that the government labels my mother as a 
"legal minority", she locked the car doors when we passed 
"minorities" on the street- we had many car-bound, 
power-lock wars. And I still love her. I finally asked her 
if it was the Lopez's (good family friends) or Jackie (a black long time
friend & co-worker) we were passing, would she still lock them out? 
I then asked her to lock the doors in the garage as soon as 
she gets in the car, and she does. And I still love her.

This, to me, is where raving can (does?) help race relations. 
The love is strong enough that we can choose to inform and educate 
someone about her/his hateful habits, rather than ostracizing or 
alienating that person. The other power of rave, like racism, 
is that it is an international meme.  

To that end:
I highly recommended finding and reading some Frederic Frantz essays.
Frantz was a psychiatrist in Africa who studied (in an attempt to heal) 
and wrote about the psycological effects of colonization on African 
natives. Also, check out some essays by Ngugi wa Thiongo who addresses 
the colonizing of the mind. For those of you who prefer fiction, try:
any novel by Ngugi(Kenyan, Gikuyu) or Chinua Achebe (Nigerian, Ibo tribe)
IMHO, Ngugi is one of the only modern revolutionary writers. Start with 
Devil on the Cross.

When Rain Clouds Gather by Bessie Head (Rhodesian)

The River Between (can't remember the author)

Waiting for the Barbarians by Coetze (Dutch? writer in Africa)

In the Castle of My Skin (can't remember author, but it's about 
the West Indies)

The Grass is Singing (can't remember, female African author)

any novel by Nadine Gordimer (South African Communist)

State of War by Ninotchka Rosca (Phillipino, my second all time favorite)

First all-time favorite: The Beautyful Ones are Not Yet Born by 
Ayah Kwei Armah(Nigerian?)

Exile and the Kingdom by Camus

Ain't I a Woman by bell hooks

Biographical, written as fiction: try Down Second Avenue by 
Ezekiel Mphalele (autobiography about living in an Aparteid ghetto in SA)

plays: 

anything by Wole Soyinka (traditional Ibo tragedies)
The Tempest by W. Shakespeare

Take care-

Jocelyn

I was just being picky with wording, that's all.  It's just that 
throughout history, conquering races by and large HAVE taken it upon 
themselves to completely exterminate the conquered.  Thankfully, this 
didn't happen to North American natives (or Jews, since it was brought 
up), and...call me too optimistic, but I believe that eventually natives 
will get, if not what they are due, at least some form of reparation.  
I'm not downplaying what they've gone through (or didn't have that 
intention, anyway), I was merely pointing out a case of hyperbole being 
used to try to make a point...

It was not.  If it was a complete extermination, then you and I would 
have no idea of even the existance of native North American culture, 
which we do.  I AGREE 100% with you about the treatment they have 
received - I know the situation.  I have native friends and have heard 
from them all that you mentioned - I'm just saying that the fact that I 
have these friends means that it wasn't genocide.  I guess it was just 
nitpicking by me.  I had no intention of downplaying the plight of 
natives (North American or elsewhere)...

Once again, you may consider this a picky point, but the use of "us" and 
"our" only applies if we retain these attitudes and viewpoints, no?  Our 
forefathers, maybe, but not "us"...

Just wonderin' if there's any chance that a full moon party will be 
happening tonight.  I'm aware that there was a small party in Santa Cruz 
on Wednesday night, but I also heard -- i'm not sure how reliable a 
source -- that there will be another full moon party held tonight.  Can 
anyone confirm this?  I, and a lot of other people who were caught off 
guard by the timing of the wednesday party, would love to know.  

Thanks,

Kyung Rok

Dear Sfraves;

	Something happened last night while doing a massage exchange, not 
that it's not happened before or won't happen again.

	My client went into what I call the Budda State, that state which
even while I'm working on you, your not necessalily in touch with me, the
room or space/environment around you. This state is similar to a state
induced by narcotics, but not the really the same. Because its natural,
and I think man has reached his ability to mimic endomor-in like
substances, at least for the next century. 

	This natural state of being I have experienced on the massage 
table often, it requires you the client to be able to let go. It helps if 
you have a good therapist, a lot of trust in them, and patiences with 
youself.

	Eastern religion has talked about obatining this state , and that 
if requires many life times to accomplish, but I feel it only requires a 
little while, to be able  to experience it for the short term.

	They talk about this feeling, as being a constant state of being. 
I'm just talking about feeling like this for up to an hour or soo. 
Another important diffenece, is that Eastern states are self created 
without the outside assitance of a massage therapist. This is an 
important statement about the value of the self and respecting that.

	If not an expert on these states or Eastern religion, but I know 
some of what I said hear is close to being acturate. So please don't jump 
on me, if I made a mistake. 

	This is a wonderful, non-drug feeling if you ever had the chance 
to experience it. Its not something that I can give to you at a rave, its 
ruined if you are on drugs while I'm doing it, Thsese things I do know. I 
would highly recommend for people to try to obatin this for themselves. 
It only took me a short while going to see a therapist once a week, its 
another slice of alternative reality thats more than worth the green. 

	These states are always enhanced by proper breathing, and we 
americans don't know how to breath for health. We breath so shallow, like 
we almost don't have time for it.:)

	Go to a massage professional of your choice, stay away from the 
yellow page ad's, especially in SF, you will proablly get propositioned, 
rather than get a good massage, and learn about alternated state of being, 
thanks.

	I'll be at black dog Friday, at of course Friend & Family late 
Saturday. I' almost had a indenpent therapist or two at every event this 
weekend, but due to personal emergencies they had to back out. Look for 
me and a new person Lisa, doing massage with me. Please, and this goes 
out especially to the men, respect her for who she is, a professional 
massage therapist, nothing more, and please welcome her to our scene. 
Also look for bodywork at most of the upcoming events in the future, this 
is my gift to the scene, to organize therapist and bring them to you.

ps I would like to apoloize to any promoter that I promised I would have a
therpist at and didn't come through to do things behond my control, I"m
sorry. This was my first weekend tring to cover multiple events and things
weren't as organized as I would have liked. I will work these bugs out,
its a personnel problem. I again hope to have a massage therapist at every
event, this is my promise, to you the Techno scene of SF. I hope to rub you 
all the right way hehe, sorry couldn't resist my massage therapist humor:)

Where are all the african-american ravers? where are all the
native-american ravers?
Lets stamp cultural elitism out of the rave movement and make the whole
thing as inclusive as possible.

Hi all-
I hope this is readable - my computer is really really screwed up right 
now, so I'm guessing what I'm typing.

Anyways, I just got my Interview  Magazine in the mail today and there is 
a really good article on some women dj's from england and the east 
coast.  You all may find it interesting, so I thought I'd pass on the info.
Anyway, see you all tomarrow night at F&F...
luv,
Amy

I know I'm preaching to the choir but I hope it's obvious to everyone that
if drugs were legal, we could regulate their production...

P.S. I still don't like speed but I don't think its the evil bad vibe
machine many ravers believe it to be.

The answer is simple.  Abolish cars and legalize meth so everyone can 
have the energy to ride their bicycles 40 miles to and from work every 
day.  Clean meth, clean air...

Fraser: (and everyone else:) - only people whose addresses are listed
as being on the sfraves mailing list can post to sfraves.  This
prevents a lot of noise (like "svbscribe me" messages and spam attacks)
from being sent to the list.  "fraser@megatripolis.org" isn't listed 
as being on sfraves, I presume David Dei is forwarding mail to 
you.  However, I can make exceptions, and I do that by adding your 
name to another file here on hyperreal, so I don't have to forward these 
manually.

kevin, just a quick reply to one of your points.  no, we made a very 
serious decision at the time we opened Megatripolis/London that we were 
NOT going to get involved in the usual rave binary system (do the dance 
AND the drugs)  In some ways I agree with you that it is right, but we 
decided that we were much too serious and longterm about all this to risk 
blowing the whole thing at some point.  if you keep going long enough all 
that karma comes back on you and blows up in your face.  notice I'm not 
saaying it would have been immoral or anything, just contra-indicated for 
our strategy.  OK?
and thanks again for the good things you've said about me.  people over 
here seem to think the zippies appeared last summer as a scheme for a 
fast buck.  I've never made a fast buck in my life but I've always been 
honest about saying we need BILLIONS to complete our work for the planet 
(NOW watch 'em tear into me!)

Subject: Re: Chemica Sutra, Zippy an' everything 

the zippies were not trying to be "the next big thing".  Zippy is a
cultural meme about harmonising your hemispheres (Hippy + Tecno) both
inside yourelf and on your planet. and , whatever you want to call it, 
how could anyone argue against that?
  the truth is that nearly everyone in the rave scene IS a zippy -
whatever you choose to call it.  Zippy has been going for longer than the
SF rave scene and there are more zippies in the world (UK, Europe,
Australia, New Zealand, US) than there are people living in San Francisco. 
so what?  who's competing?  why is everyone so paranoid? nobody's trying 
to conquer you, mate.  we're trying to help us all and the planet by 
making the tecno-organic balance the next dominant meme.  and don't tell 
me cultural viruses don't compete - tell the people who run the planet now.

peace, love & cooperation

The only problem I have with this thread ( and with JS Lee who started it )
is that there is usually an assumption that there are "guilty" peoples
( usually found by their skin color ) and innocent people. Specifically,
whites in this case are guilty of perpetrating genocide .....   This is 
just a bull shit restatement of blacks are guilty of... say being in gangs...
I look white but my Great grandmother was full blood cherokee. My grandfather
has spend his life on public assistance near Yuba City as an alcoholic. 
Am I white or Indian? Neither. Both. 

Now assume the Germans were guilty of genocide on the Jews. Well it might be
karmic justice.. Turning to Deuteronomy Chapter 7 ( Preacher Clay assends to
the pulpit - please laugh :-)  )...  Speaking of the seven nations of Canaan
7:2 And when the lord thy god shall deliver them before thee; thou shalt 
smite them and UTTERLY DESTROY THEM...... there are many other old verses
that indicate to me that early jews were both capable and commanded by their
god to practice genocide (attmpted genocide ) or whatever. So were they
innocent lambs brought before the germans ?  

Will we continue to blame people for the sins of their forefathers. Did 
blacks in africa never attempt genocide against other blacks?  Indians never
against indians in americas ? Is anyone truly innocent ? Or for that matter
guilty ? 

What bothers me most is that JSL starts a thread complaining that whites 
use these "code words" for blacks and people of color and then he proceeds
to PREJUDICIOUSLY condemn whites he doesn't know OR ask for what he in his
prejudice "thinks" they are saying...  based mostly on the fact that it
is a "white" that is talking...  Yes racial prejudice is alive and well but
on BOTH sides. And yes, genocide has been attempted BY many peoples of all
colors....

Now let's stop the shit slinging and turn our minds toward F&F and 
celebrating together whatever our color, size, sexual oriention or past
nationality. Let's simply be who we are together and not blame each other for
the sins of the past that ALL peoples carry not just whites....
 
More than enough said I'm sure....

Hey All,

Just remembered...

Baraka is playing at the Red Vic (on Haight) this week. 

For those who aren't familiar, Baraka is "a cinematograhpic quest to explore 
the meaning of the Sufi word Baraka, which translates roughly as 'the essence 
of life from which the evolutionary process unfolds' (or-the breath of life). 

A lot of the movie focus' on tribal/spiritual/religious cultures.

A nice prelude to Sat. nite, dontcha think?

Later...

-Jonas

brian,
thanks for making things somewhat clearer, though I still don't quite 
understand why megatripolis,org isn't listed.  how does david do it?  
one further point.  your letter was somewhat double-meaning in that you 
said how you could make exceptions but didn't actually say you were 
making one.  are you?  have you?  if so, thanks very much indeed.  if 
not, would you please?
and what does spamming mean?

fraser
PS  whenI post and it asks "send it to everybody else?" does that mean 
post it publicly as I've been assuming?

nexsys:{geoffw}66-> webster genocide
geno.cide \'jen-*-.si-d\ n : the deliberate and systematic destruction of a 
   racial, political, or cultural group

The definition doesn't say anything about how successful you have to be;
to have the motive and to begin to carry it out seems to be enough.
Maybe you have to get use to the fact that the truth sometimes is shocking,
and that "evil" is almost never perpetrated by people who will acknowledge
that what they are doing is evil.  Most people in Nazi Germany didn't go 
around saying "Yeah, we are gonna kill all the Jews", alot of people started
to think that the Jews were a threat to their well being and should be
"curtailed", by the time the camps started happening people still didn't
believe that there was anything sinister going on, and while it was happening
people thought these were internment camps for dissidents, and terrorist and
that maybe a large amount of them happened to be Jews (it figures, they were
told earlier that the Jews were the source of all of their woes, I believe
it was Jewish Bankers and Communist!), remember, there was a war going on
and most governments are granted special powers during wartime.  But do you 
for one minute think the German people thought that their Government 
was committing genocide? Most didn't know or  didn't WANT to know.  
Much like the situation here in the USA, the fact of the matter is that 
the US government (we the people of the United States) carried out 
"the deliberate and systematic destruction of a racial, political, 
or cultural group" AND IS STILL AT IT!

OH yeah? what part of "us" only applies, the only people who can get off are
maybe people who are not american citizens, people it's time "we" become
responsibe for what "our" government is doing, has done, and will do to "us".
Native American, Immegrae and american-born alike.  You must realize also
that history is the story of the "ones who win".  This doen't mean you should
feel guilty about what happened, your right, you weren't around, but it is your
responsibility to seek and confront the truth and to do what ever you can to
insure that such things don't happen again.

[lots of stuff deleted]

Dear Fraser,

	I've never met you, but I've heard a lot about you.  It seems
on the surface at least that we have a lot of the same ideals and want
a lot of the same things to happen.  I've gone to a couple of your
events and found them to be interesting but not the most mind
shattering experiences that I have been exposed to (and believe me,
there HAVE been some mind shattering experiences that have taken place
here in SF).  I hear from friends that I respect that you are a "sound
bloke" and an all around good person, but there are some things that
always seem to bother me when I hear about the Zippies or other things
associated with your name.  Rather than talk a bunch of shit about how
you are, I'll just share my feelings and hope that someplace we can find
a way to communicate:

	The first thing that really bothers me is the nagging feeling that
	I get that you seem to think that you are coming here to "show us
	how to do it right".  Well there is always room for improvement and
	I'm more than willing to entertain any ideas you may have for 
	improvement but you must realize that this is the Bay Area, I myself
	live in Silicon Valley, I am old by raver standards (being  38), and
	have been a computer Hacker since I started programming assembly 
	language on an IBM 1130.  There are many "technoshamans" in the Bay
	Area, infact it could be said that the Personal Computer Revolution
	was a direct off-spring of the First Summer of Love.  In any event
	many of the things that you intend to "bring" to us have been here for
	several years, some have been tried at parties with varied success
	other things will be tried in the future.  Be aware that we welcome
	your contribution but it doesn't seem to me that you bring anything
	special.

	The other thing that bothers me is your delivery.  I think a lot of
	the people (at least on this list) tend to believe in "leadership
	by example", I for one have had enough of following "the Great Man"
	in the I-Ching sense of the word; people here will listen to you
	and align (not follow) with your purpose based upon your actions and
	the results that you produce.  We are pretty much a non-hierachical
	bunch and tend to respond well to people who have proven mastery over
	their own destinies and can produce specific mesurable results,  If
	you throw a party and people clearly have the experiece of being,
	focused, uplifted of catalyzed, they will return, and bring friends
	and spread the meme so to speak, there have been some LEGENDARY parties
	here and there will be many in the future, we are open to having you
	be a part of that, but you can't run it and you can't control it, it has
	a life of it's own regardless of what hype or spin you put on it.
	All I seem to hear from your direction is "over here! Follw me!"  
	My question to you is, "Why?"

	Many of us are very dedicated to the "Scene", some of us go out every
	night, some are DJs, some are party promoters,  Many of us are busy
	building social, physical and virtual infrastructures so that some of
	the experiences that have touched us can last and impact the world at
	large, we do this quietly because we know that the swiftest most
	deadly meme is the one that The Empire doesn't hear coming.

	We are future.

	We are everywhere.

        this movie is amazing...I've seen it 4 times and my breath is still
taken away at many points in this movie.what about the building that's has
a silver, gold and bronze room (where is this anyone? I asked an art
history professor and she guessed Iran/Iraq)and I can't get over the beauty
of the scene of the lone man with the bowl of water that rings his bell
after each step. (i've heard this is a ritual, that the water represents
drops of blood or drops of life and if you drop one you'll miss that much
or something to that effect-if anyone knows details on that let me know,
i'd be interested to learn the exacts of it all.) Also this movie is
primarily focused on third world countries and the middle east...not the
usual spots in Europe and the US. That's one of the things I really liked
about this show.

        Check it out!!!!!!!!

    p.s. a promo for southern utah which is one of the few american spots

It seems he has a problem with me (as he clearly stated).  I would like to
point out at this point, the lack of direct quotation.  I did not state
that anybody was guilty.  I did state that the comment was PREJUDICIAL and
nothing else. Remember, what I was talking about was the use of the word
gangsta as it is commonly used.

It is statements like the one above that really get under my skin (no pun
inteneded).  This person is starting a very personal attack. Instead of
clearly attacking my ideas, he tries to attack me.  Whatever, this is just
more of the SAME OLD SHIT.  Attack the person, and not the idea.  How very
Amerikkkan.

Clearly a lack of understanding of history.  I will not attempt to educate
this person about genocide.  The fact is the Germans were guilty of
genocide against anyone who did not fit the classification of Aryan.
Please review your history.

This statement does not deserve more attention.

Where did I blame anybody for anything other than using a prejudicial remark?

Geez...as the great orator Roanld Reagan once said "...here we go
again...". I complained my friend, that the use of the word gangsta is used
in this society against people of color.  I left it wide open as to it's
usage, and did not blame whites SOLELY for it's use.  You read into
something that was not there.  I left in the possibility that ANYONE could
use the word, it was not an exclusive perview of whites to use the word.
What I was syaing was that the use of the word, by anyone, was a direct
affront against people of color.  You assume that only whites have such
prejudices.  I made no assumption as to the user of the word.  Re-read the
post.

I made no compalaints about whites, I made a complaint about the use of a
word by a particlar individual.  He apologized for using it, I accepted and
the matter is now closed.  I based my virtiol on the FACT that the word is
prejudicial, and that it's use was given no thought, or reason.  I blamed
Crunch for it's use, and people in general for it's propagation and use.  I
blamed no particular group of people for it's use.  But you would not know
that since you did not read the post, and are engaging in a personal
attack.

You do not want to pick a fight with me, sir.

The problem I have with people like Mike is that they don't read posts.
The second problem I have with people like Mike is that they prefer to
continue a thread publicly that I now consider closed.  The problem I have
against people like Mike is that they spend alot of time not making direct
quatations to support their counter-point, and engage in much unsupported
conjecture.  The problem I have with people like Mike is that they lack a
historical perspective.  People like Mike start nasty flame-wars.  One of
which I am ending.

I'll be brining a pal and his girlfriend to their first rave for

 I'll be wearing my round clay peace token around my neck - one of the

In reading all these posts about perceived differences between different

I think it is appropriate at this stage to mention the South African Rave
Evolution. - which is a story with lots of twists and turns, ( an event
timeline story is archived at hyperreal) about how it is possible for an
entire nation of people to change their perception and evolve from
Apartheid to an inclusive, democratic, non-racial society that not only
protects peoples rights against discrimination on the basis of race, class
or creed but also sexual ORIENTATION (ie even the transgendered)

If Sfravers would like me to do a couple of postings on this interesting
subject, then let me know - would'nt want to take up bandwidth with
relevence.

- david dei

PS: It is not good enough to be merely anti-racist (against racism) one has
to incorporate a non-racial (not defined by race) perspective where race is
no longer a factor.

Yes we can get along! Because we are a group of very wonderful people who
are experiencing something unique. We are a part of a community that is
struggling to understand and experience ideas as complex and loaded as
racism and genocide. I think one thing that is obvious is that we are
talking about these things. A lot of people don't have an oppurtunity to be
a part of a community that is trying to grapple with these issues.  It is a
very wonderful, pure experience that is happening. And we can, and are,
learning from these communications. I think that raves are inherently
non-racist in the nature of the experience. The love I feel their seems so
pure that it cannot be based on race or gender, its pure, but we aren't in
that all the time. We have to our jobs, and our school, and our day to day
lives.  Yet, I think that what is going on is an attempt to come to a
higher understanding about these things. I know I have a learned a lot from
this thread, I learned about the Creek tribe and their treatment by the US
government, I learned about the way people perceive genocide,  I learned
about what it is like to have people perceive you as a criminal because of
the color of your skin, I learned about how all of this can overwhelm
people and cause them to think we are saying that all white people are
evil.
        Racism is truly something that is difficult to understand because
so much of our thoughts are internalized without discussion and further
thinking.  So naturally some people get tense, and reactionary when such
tender topics are touched upon. It is all part of coming to a better
understanding about the world we live in, and our history, and ourselves.
We should try to get through to an understanding about the way we exist
today and how we got here.  And every step forward we take is truly
wonderful and miraculous experience. Much that we experience is geared
towards keeping us in our reactions and our misunderstandings. You see it
on the newspaper, and our tv, and in our political system.  All of this
manages to keep people from coming to real understandings about what other
people think. A better understanding of the issues facing our world and
ourselves will not come from "Nightline", it will come from our community
of wonderful loving people talking with each other, sharing our
experiences, feelings, and knowledge about how we percieve the world. It is
difficult but it can only bring us closer to a truer understanding of the
people that we love so much at raves, and beyond.  So we must be honest, we
must say how we feel and object when we are hurt by something someone has
said. It will work out as long as we try to understand more than react.  We
can move further towards letting the wonder and strength of the love that
we feel at a rave into our very being and thought. Good luck!

With hope and love,
Gabe

Okay, John, I clearly understand your point and I know that I personally 
_have_ learned from this and will not lightly throw the word "gangsta" 
around.  I must ask, though, about your use of the word "Amerikkka" - 
being a Canadian and not fully white, it doesn't really bother me, but 
don't you think that the white American readers of this list might be 
taking offense to the term?  The connection of a person with the kkk is 
very offensive, I'm sure just as offensive as the word "gangsta" is to you...

Jim

spelling "Amerikkka" this way is meant to criticize the STATE, not every 
single individual who happens to be white and born here.

My heart goes out to all those involved at f&f, especially Ethan.  The 
party was romping, a little crowded, but such a nice vibe.  There were so 
many smiles and warm looks everywhere I looked.
Not long after I went near the door to get some air, I noticed a few 
police officers.  Some words were exchanged, and the next thing I saw was 
4 cops grabbing, handcuffing and hauling away a raver.  Shortly after 
that the party was shut down.
I want to thank those involved at the party, and Ethan especially who I 
heard taking full responsibility, and getting cited.  Ethan please let me 
know the amount of the citation, so I can help out.

Two part report:

 Friends & Family Sardines
 The telephone info line was so busy that I didn't get through until
9:30PM. I used some of the time before that to buy some bananas and 
peppermints for the party. Arrived at the map point to be greeted by the
sight of a huge line ( for a map point ), about 35 bodies long, and people
arriving every minute. Bought my ticket and map w/DJ lineup from Susan
and Ethan. Drove to the site and parked within a city block of it.

 I got there soon enough to beat the monster lineup that was to be my
major bum memory of this event. Inside , it was very nice! Upstairs and
downstairs dance areas and an interesting chill area in the rear of the
upper story. The crowd and the DJs were both in top form!

 It started getting pretty crowded , and some of the flaws of the
space began to show themselves. Some of the sofa-mattresses put out on the
floor for the comfort of the guests were placed along the path between 
the top of the stairs and the chill room , which narrowed the walkway
and thereby increased congestion. 

 Only one set of stairs between the upper and lower stories , and a normal
4-foot wide stairwell at that. The foot of these stairs were located at 
the only doorway to the site , meaning that the folks coming downstairs
and going upstairs were bumping into the stream trying to get in and out
the door.

 Last , but not least - from the phone message , 650 tickets were going
to be sold . Either more than this were sold , a lot of folks got in for 
free , or the holding capacity of the place was seriously overestimated.
By about 11:45 , the doorway admissions had to be limited to one in only
after one out. If you had wandered out to get some fresh air before this 
policy went into effect ( like me ) , you got an unpleasant surprise 
when you tried to get back in. Adding to this the disinterest in establishing
queues by the folks waiting outside, and you get a very bothersome 
atmosphere outside. I even snarled at one guy who tried to push past me,
and then grabbed his belt and pulled him back behind me! ( Only immediatley
afterwards noticing that he outsized me by an uneasy margin ...). 

 Just as I got back in , the promoters got the garage door open , which
they used to handle the in/out crowd , while reserving the doorway
for the newcomers with tickets. 

 I decided that the population density was too high for me - I went straight
for my bag and left , with the intentions of sleeping in my truck for
awhile , with the hopes of a later crowd reduction. I woke up at about 3AM,
and asked some folks walking by the truck how the party was going. They
told me the bad news that the police had shut it down. A drive-by verified
the presence of at least 5 patrol cars on the main street near the site .

 SUMMARY: Great fun while I was inside! Bummer when I stepped outside. Got
  to see a lot of nice SFRavers , some who I had never met in person before!
  
 So , I went to All Together Now ...

 It was held in what seemed to be a small SOMA industrial site that was in the 
middle of remodelling - open , bare walls and unpainted wallboard. At least 
that's  what it appeared to be with the lack of lighting - really dark. The
front  room was devoted to house and techno , while the back room had jungle 
(!).  Very dancable jungle too - it was the first time in my limited exposure
to jungle that I heard something I could dance to. And it's a lot of fun
too! I guess they were spinning very Jamaican dub-by jungle - I must look
for this stuff on CD or vinyl ( any DJ got a good tape out locally yet? ). 

 Steamy atmosphere , lots of empty rooms for chill space. Mellow crowd. Ailing
sound systems ( the jungle room had to shut down because of sound system
failure , and the front room had a mono stack setup and one stack with no
sound coming out of it ).

 In order to relieve the steamy atmosphere , somebody had opened the back 
garage door. Through it , I could seem some driving into a garage in the 
building across the street. It looked like semi-residential property in
back , which meant sleeping people ( and the guy who had just come home ).
I had a promonition ...

 Sure enough , the police showed up a half-hour later. I decided to leave 
for home - it was about 4:40AM anyway , so I had a full night. Went to
Sparky's for breakfast , and down to Sunnyvale to my computer terminal!

 Summary of "All Together Now" - Educational! Steamy! Dark. Lousy sound.

 You know you must be getting to be an old raver when you meet your nephew
at a rave! ( Happened to me last night at Friends and Family . He got a
laugh out of it too .. ).

 Since Ethan has to eat the cost of his citation upfront , how and where
will we send our $$ to help Ethan recover from this financial misfortune?
If it's anything like the initial $350 Oyster Bay fine , he'll need the 
$$!!!

What a party ! And once again far too crowded - only this time we TRIED to
prevent it. It's clear that we would have filled the Berkeley space that
fell through. 

The little that I wandered around I heard great stuff from deaks, a bit of
some tasty ambient from wbl. Amazing ambient room layout - we have to give
you people more room to work your magic - I've seen none better except for
lack of space. The alter was great!!! Was this a lot of New Moon's input ?

Downstairs the "techno room" took off. Bryce was OBVIOUSLY having a great
time during his set --- Lee built the energy from there -- Alex and Ethan
what can I say ? All were just phucking phantastigorical ! The walls were
just running with water. I was standing in a small pool trying to make its
way to my barrier strips. Thank you Lee for finding me some rags to fight
the flow :-)

People were smiling, dancing, talking, hugging, giving away candy, shouting,
whistling.. I noticed the floor upstairs was bouncing like a trampoline 
under the estatic pulsing of dancers.

This was very definitely the best F&F yet except of course for its far to
sudden and rude ending. I was thinking how dead a typical bar scene is 
compared to the pulsing joy of revelling ravers I felt last night. People
need many more celebrations like this to keep their sanity and balance in
an often insane and unbalanced world ! 

And finally, I want to really send a special thank you to Ethan and Bryce
the founding fathers of F&F.. Your work and vision do you justice and I for
one appreciate it greatly. It's pure pleasure doing visuals for your-our
events!! Now I know what I've worked on visuals these past few years for.
I'm far richer for my association with this group than money would ever make
me.....

Thanks all
Ameba, Cloud Factory, New Moon, Pacific and of course all our Friends & 
Family

You really make it happen !

Mike

Hello,

This Thursday night (March 23) from 9:00 pm until 11:00 pm, Channel 9 
(KQED) is airing a episode of "Mystery", a British whodunnit series.

The episode, entitled "Cherubim and Seraphim" is about a British police
detective whose niece takes a new drug called "Seraphim" at a "party"
(a rave or house party, although neither term is ever used) which
causes her to have an experience so profound that she commits suicide
afterwards.  Most of the two hours is about the investigator trying to
discover what the scene is about and why she committed suicide.

In my experience, this program is unique in that depicts fairly
accurately, BOTH the parental and un-hip adult point of view AND the
raver point of view -- although the latter is rarely given first hand
by the ravers themselves - instead they are voiced as discoveries by
the investigator ("I was so miserable at age 15 that it didn't occur to
me that they might be doing this [party] because they were happy").  In
that sense, it is different from the usual wholesale condemnation of
partying that is usually found in such programs.  In fact, during the
first hour or so, it looks like it is going in that usual direction...

The depictions of the raves seem pretty accurate too (for one thing,
they have map points, etc.) [although I've never been to one in the
UK].

Recommended if you are interested in either media depictions of raves,
or are interested in the mental processes of people who are opposed to
such things.  Entertaining, but not particularly uplifting. :-)

respect to all,

Ken

My second rave, and a night to remember.  The Vibe was present and
among us.  Met a lot of cool people, got a good dose of happy
steamy gladness, celebrated in a major way!  Thanks and kudos and
big good karma to everyone involved, organizers and ravers.

My first F&F, and also alas my first bust.  I look forward to the next
ones, and I'd also like to know what went down legally and financially
so I can help out.  I'm really happy to have been part of this one,
short and sweet though it was.

Rob

dEAR sFRAVES;

	Hi to all the new and old faces, I got to meet at F&F. From Rob 
to Larry to Amy:), and all the other ones I know I"m forgetting. 

	Ethan of F&F ended up getting hit with like 5 citations, I image
he will have some fines to pay after his court apperance. I'm not sure
whether he will be looking for moral and finacial support when he is
scheduled to appear, but I would like to pledge by time and some money to
help pay for any court costs/fines that are a result of the legal system 
doing its job(last statement to be read with sarcasum and disgust).

	I'm not sure whether or not it would help, but I image if we 
filled the court room that day, that the judge may think twice about 
anything excessive, but I would like to leave that up to Ethan's 
descretion, due to that its him who received the citations. All you need 
to do is ask Ethan and I'll be there, I have a lot of spare time and 
resources right know, and WE WILL PREVAIL.

Gosh, what can I say?  My heart goes out to all involved with Friends and 
Family.  You did a fantastic job and if the party was to have gone on all 
night, it may have well been one of the all time *best*!
I think Ethan may have been spinning downstairs right before the but - or 
wa it olar?  Whoever it was was laying down the *shit!!*  Holy christ it 
was gripping me like a steel vise.  Incredibe.  I WANT MORE!!

Josh Bates *gave* me his mix tape.  Very cool, Josh, thank you.  I 
listened to it on the way home and it was *really* good.  Got to meet 
Brian Darkness, Larry Ching, and Brian who signs off as "hugz"  (sorry, 
Brian, I can't think of your last name!:) and Mike - a lurker (come on 
out, Mike!  You are so cool!)  And where was Milton?!?!?  All of the 
Sacramento gang I came with were all looking for you everywhere.  Tis a 
mystery................And I missed Peter Fogel - oh well, next time, right?
 After the bust, me and some 
friends went oover to my friends house in Berkeley and chilled there the 
rest of the night.  I have to say that I was rather concerned for all 
those people who were still severely in an altered state after the bust 
and they had to drive somewhere.  I hope everyone was careful out there.  
Thank god my friend, Greg was there to fdrive my car.  
Friends and Family will *always* have my support .  I hope this isn't the 
end.  

luv,
Amy

 If it wasn't apparent in my original long post , I want to say upfront
a big THANK YOU to Ethan and the rest of the "promoters" involved in
putting on this great party ( Friends and Family One Year Anniversary
and fundraiser ). All my criticisms are intended with all love and
concern for more and better parties in the future!

The Happiest people in the World
================================

Well,   this is to be my first Mainstream Rave in Sydney,  and thanx to
Steve Bancroft,   I got on the guest list.

On thursday,  I learn the rave was to take place about 45 km south/west
of Sydney,   way out in the suburbs.   I was supposed to meet the bus that
was to leave the Central terminal at 9 pm.

On the bus,   I meet one of the ravers that heard my radio program on
Skid Row radio.  This kid was blown away that he actually met me in person.

There is no doubt,  I am the OLDEST raver in Australia...  according to
most people I met.

The bus pulls into an industrial complex,  with scattered homes nearby,
and I though that it was going to get busted for sure,  because of the
close priximity of homes in the area.

As I leave the bus,  I could barely hear the music inside as the first DJ
was spinning Happy Hardcore.    Remember,  here in australia,  Happy Hardcore
is MAINSTREAM!!   but that not ALL you get.    There were 3 other parties
going on in Sydney this Sat evening.    One thats not more then 100 meters
from my doorstep in "the Cross",  held at "Le Girls" nightclub,   but got
word is was mostly house.

The Fridays Green acres was cancelled,  due to the outside area being flooded
due to recent rains.

Anyway,  back to the "Happiest People".   I saved my E's and A's for this
party,   and wanted to be especially happy to insure the party lives up
to its name.

This was a Kiddie rave,  as named by the AusRavers,   and I can certainly see
why.    Age ranges from 18 - 24,   and few people with the exception of me,
were much older.

I could hear the kiddie girls giggle when I walked by as these people aren't 
used to seeing older people at these gigs.

The venue,  is a warehouse,  with a chill out tent in the front parking lot,
and clothing and shirt sales Kiosk and hot dog booth set up.    Inside,  the
area was all the dance area,  with the speaker system in the back,  although
they could use some additional speakers in the front,   I suspect they were
concerned with noise,  as it got visited by the police several times,  which
resulted in the noise getting turned down several times.

After midnight,  they allowed ins-and-outs,  and people were congregating
outside in great numbers.   I saw a few police cruisers drive by,   but
no serious problems.

Inside,  I was getting off big time,  groovin to the insane 180+ BPM pace
of Happy Hardcore.  Gack!  One song they played in particular was played
3 times that evening.   It was a cool song,   but VERY POPULAR when it
was played.   It even gets a lot of Air play on the radio.

I went to this rave alone,   but was almost immediatly approached by people
saying "You were at Restitution,  weren't you?"  I said Yup!  "Better get
used to seeing me here for a while!"  he gave a thumbs up and said,  "It's
really great to see older people here".   At first,  people were somewhat
suspicious of me,   but once they saw me out on the dance floor,  groovin
and hoppin around like a mad Kangarooo,   they really dug it.

Eventually,  they got the lazers fired up,   and WOW!  What visuals.   Almost
all large mainstream raves have really great Lazer effects that really make
the visuals really insane.

All throughout the evening,  the music stayed ABOVE 170 BPM range,  and as
the pace quickened,   it got as high as 250 BPMs and at that stage its all
arms and little leg work....   As a new DJ went on,   it would start at about
170 BPM,  and gradually would increase during the DJ's set.

All DJ's did a wonderful job of seamlessly mixing the Hardcore songs,  but
there must not be that many Happy Hardcore songs out there,  as several got
played several times throughout the evening.

I have to say one thing about (HHC - Happy Hard core),   it's Happy,  and 
while on E,   it's really blissful,  trancey and you just can't help but keep
a big fat smile on your face.    Oh Yea!!  people here also use pacifiers  :-)
Tee hee!

As the evening wore on,   I really stepped up my energy,   as I ussually do,
to the amazement of my Aussie friends.   They just dan't get used to seeing
an older person having so much fun.

Later on,  I met this other older person,  perhaps in his upper 30's,  and
he thought that HE was the oldest until he met me.

This rave was to end at 10 am  (WOW!!  14 hours of continious dancing)  -
Now we're talkin a REAL RAVE....  Tee hee!!

At one time,   someone said,   lets go up and dance on stage,   but I was 
having a really trancey time where I was,   Eventually, I grabbed him and
pointed to the stage,  and headed towards it.

People I passed,  literally pulled me up there,   but one of the staff told
me to leave,   as I left,  others were ragging on the staff guy,  saying
"Bring this guy back up there!",   so  headed back and danced the entire
set until there was a break.

At that time the girl was behind the turntables,  playing some insane hard
acid trance with little or no breaks in the beat.    I literally WENT OFF!
and everyone hopped up on the dance floor.  I've never seen so many smiles
from so many people in one place.

I would estimate about 1500+ people attended,  if you include about 100 or
so hanging around outside.

At about 10 minutes before the party ended,   I started walking along the
side,  pulling people up to the dance floor....  "C'm on you slackers,   get
up and dance  - this is the last song!"   Most people were too tired to get 
up and stand,  let alonne dancing.    I even pulled up this one dude that
ribbed me when I went to chill,  earlier he said "Chilling already?"   I said
Yup!   Gotta cool down...   The heat and humidity rivaled Friends and Family,
but climate here is awfully hot and humid to my standards anyway.

Then,  towards the end,  I saw him sitting down,  so I grabbed him and said
"Lets go... slacker!  time to get up and dance yo ass off!"  He shook his
head in bewilderment,  as I had been up there solid for more than an hour,
but couldn't possibly even think of not dancing to this insane acid trance.

He finally got up,   and several more complied,  and I think I got about
15 - 20 more people up and dancing towards the end.    Everyone really
dug it...   Towards the end,  thie youg girl came up to me and said
"Aren't you tired?"   I said "I don't know the meaning of 'tired'".

At one point,  about an hour before the rave was to end,   someone was
sufferig from an overdose,  and mentioned that he had mixed speed with acid.

Unfortunately,  speed is used here,  all too often,  probably because of the
high cost of A and E.

When the rave finally did end,  the music stopped and everyone cheered the
DJ,.  and the promoter came up and announced the names of the DJ's.

Finally,  one more song was played,  and yup!  You guessed it,   it was that
HHC (Happy Hard core) song tha was played earlier.

As people were filing out,   many were coming up to me,  asking where I was
from.....  I told them that I was from SF,  and many asked how long
I've been raving....   I said...   I'm from Old School!!  WOW!  I haven't
seen or experienced such great respect and appreciation for me being there
grooving with these fine people.    

More next time...

Dear Sfraves;

	Hello, I'm going to be going in for some very serious elective 
maxillofacial surgery in about a month. The surgery will take place at 
Doctors hospital in Pinole, were I will be for several days recovering. 
The procedure I'm having done is a maxillary os-de-otto-me & a 
mandible sagital spit. In lay terms, their going to cut and move up 
and back my upper(superior) jaw(maxilla), and cut and move forward my 
lower(inferior) jaw(mandible). I will also be in braces by the middle of 
next month. This will correct a long time severe over bite and a source 
of both physical and emotional pain.

	The bone structure and of course the way I appear to people will
change from the nose down. So I will look like a different person, and
hopefully for the better. I'm very scared, but its the only way to correct
it. My rotten family is "too busy" to come out here and spend time with me
and help me though this. This hurts & angers me greatly, but I will not
let their lack of love stop me, from what I need to do for myself. 

	The risks of the surgery are some degree of sensation lost to my
face. There's a nerve called the mandibular nerve which is responsible for
sensation in your face, especially around the mouth. It runs down the
lower jaw and enters into your chin through a little hole called a
foramen. This nerve needs to be stretched a little bit, and hopefully
won't break or tear. 

	The biggest concern is how I'm going to look afterward, will I 
like what I see ..etc. My jaw/face as a child was a source of tremendous 
emotional pain, being called names like beaver ..etc. Also, if something 
were to happen to me while I was on the table, there are still things in 
this life I haven't tried yet or done.

	But on the positive side I could end up looking better, I will be 
able to eat food properly, and stop doing damage to my esophagus & 
stomach. Of course I will also end up having a great smile.

	So once again I ask for your support when its time for me to have 
my surgery, My doctor wants me to have a partner to help me though it. I 
would be willing to pay this person for some of their time. I image I 
would need someone to work closely with me for a week or so, and you would 
have access to my car. The person shouldn't be very screemish as far as 
being around someone in a lot of pain, or being around a man crying or 
expressing strong emotion, or alergic to pussy cats, meow. My jaw will be 
wired shut for about 2 weeks and I'm told possibly longer.

	So anyone interested in supporting me through this please contact 
me at my email address listed below or call me at 510-254-0933. I'm 
moving to Berkeley this week so me number going to be changin, the old 
number will having a forwarding message on it. Support can also be a 
card, e-mail or a visit in the hospital, any and all are always 
appreiated, very deeply heart felt, and never forgotten :)

	   Peace, Love & Thanks From Across Cyberspace

went to Utah exactly three years ago! Bueatiful sites. Really good snow

worse then the drive I took to Oregon last month.

Note: The salt flats are more then just an extraordinary site, they are
one of the best natural landmarks that we have in north america.(but the
drive still sucks alot (that drive includes the rest of the way to CA))

Lagging and lollygagging as usual I got to the map point way too late and 
just found a bunch of people wandering around thinking the same thing and 
wondering what to do now.  Oh there is a little note - another party at 
the Begin Again location! Now what was the address??  thinking thinking 
what did I read about so many good reviews... bryant something... almost 
the troc but not quite  is all I remembered.  After a brief wander I 
heard the music!  No I didn't see the light, I heard the music!
"Is this the party?"
"Yeah it's upstairs and a left and a left"
"Whoa!" (joey lawrence style)
Nice office space!  (whoa!)
computers everyehwere! (whoa!)
huge comfy ambient area (whoa!)
free! (whoa!)

techno?  trance?  what was it? I don't know.  It wasn't F&F  but this 
was a very interesting party.  vibe?  this may have been one of those 
examples of DJ controlling the atmosphere - people are dancing to some 
solid grooves at a steady pace, nothing spectacular ,but enough bass to 
fill your soul.  Dj handoff - the big screeching halt... silence... intro 
to some voices muttering something backed by muzak. was this somoe kind 
of joke?  I dunno.  "bye bye crowd!  bye bye thanks for dancing, scurry 
along now!" and that they did.  People wanted to love the moment, I could 
tell there were just enough smileys but the music was robbing our 
momentum. 

otherwise it was a pleasant party.
A suitable shinding.

Walrus

Dear SF-Ravers,

     I'd like to start by saying thank you to Ethan. You have my support. Not
many people would be willing to take the risk you did.

     To others out there, most of them not on the net, I would like to
apolagize for some actions(and lack of) at F&F.(personal apologies will
follow). I'm guilty of making my personal feelings more important than
others.

Now for the important part.

     Although I personally went to F&F with at least 6 friends from Sac, I
drove alone with the intention of crashing at MILTON's. I was totally looking
foward to the whole night. When I pulled up to the map point, things started
out great. My friends Chris, Lalomi, and Blanka were right behind me. Wendy
and Rohnda were already in line and the I bump into some friends from the
city. I was already an hour behind the schedule I wanted to be but no probs.

When I arrived the party was bumpin in a big way. Although the ambient room
was a little to be desired the layout seemed to be nice and cosey. I decided
to go sober(lotsa reasons) and glad I did. I couldn't stop dancing. I kept
going up and down between the two floors, trying to decide wich one I like
beter.

At about 2:15 in the morning when I started to release all my energy on
dancing(That guy upstairs was tearing it up soooooo good), the system turns
off.

This is the start of my worst time ever. I go outside and find everyone.
Wendy's friend Rhonda turned up missing. We found her by the dumpster. She
was afraid of being arrested. Wendy took Rhonda home so that left me with 3
friends. still good in my book. We tried that party on howard. Some guy tried
to sell me crack in front, and they were charging $5. Since we had no money
for either(just kiddin) the only other thing was dream. Since 2 of the three
friends were frying(and were under 21) they went back home.

It was already 3:20 but I knew my friends Peter and Jen would be at dream for
sure and milton wouldn't be home before 6 or so. I went to Dream and found
out it was $10. The bouncer wouldn't let me get my friend to borrow five more
bucks to get in, so I went atm searching. I spent almost an hour trying to
find an atm machine that worked. I went as far as fell before turning back.
I decided to go back to dream to leave a message with my friends. I tried the
door one more time. The guy beleived me and used my ID as coll. against the
other 5 bucks. After taking care of that I relized I should have gone home at
3. The vibe had a score of 0. only about 30 or so people. 2 really drunk
girls hit on me(I was def. in no mood for people drinking).

Because I was sober I really needed to talk to someone(I like to talk alot
when i'm sober(ask anyone)). But none of these people would suffice. I called
Milton at 4:45 and he wasn't home. I left dream at 5:30 and decided to go to
golden gate park and rest for a few before driving to his house.

Here is where it gets really bad. I parked and leaned my chair back. I must
have fallen asleep right away because a half an hour later a cop was knockin'
on my window. He asked me step out of the car. He ask if I was sober but he
didn't believe me because my eyes were droopy. He put me in the back of his
car(were it was freezing) and began searching my car. He found two NOVA's in
my ashtray(NOVA is like herbal x)and he then arrested me for possion of an
illegal substance and for under the influence(both bull)we stayed there
and waited for another cop. I protested both counts to the second cop and
told him that it was a bullsh*t search. After about an hour and fifteen
minutes of waiting a third officer let me go because he also felt the search
was illegal. I was sooooo tired and needed to sleep. But the cops told me to
go back to Sac. right away. I didn't argue.

I almost fell asleep on the road. I forgot all about milton and went driving
home. I went real slow and stopped at denny's for food and coffee. It's funny
how you realize you ignored someone only when you feel incredibly lonley
yourself. I didn't get home till 10:30 or so. I slept until 8. I blame the
bad night only on myself.

Thanx for reading this message. I know a lot of you skipped it. If just one
person reads it. I'll know because I'll feel it.
Thanx again ethan.

Clearly you either went to different rave thren me or you were on so many 
good drugs that you would have had a good time in a concentration camp!
F&F was, with out a doubt, the most badly organized party organized in SF 
in recent months.  To many people, to smal a venue; pathetic!
This is sad because a lot of people come from far and wide for this 
event because it is all agaes.  Hopefully next time they'll know not to 
bother.  People have got better thing's to waist $5 then on drivel like 
this even if it is for a good cause.
In short, a comp[lete bloody farce by all concerned!  (Sorry Ethen!)
REMEMBER: WANTING TO HAVE A GOOD TIME AND ACTUALLY HAVING A GOOD TIME ARE 
TWO COMPLETELY DIFFERENT THING'S.

Kevin has a bad night:
>Clearly you either went to different rave thren me or you were on so many 
>good drugs that you would have had a good time in a concentration camp!

A little harsh i think. I went and had a great time dancing to some good
tunes and NO i did not take any drugs. (although i've heard that tired "they
must be on drugs, why else would they be having fun" cliche many times
before).

>To many people, to smal a venue; pathetic!

It was way too crowded which eventually drove me away but i found a nice
little spot up near the DJ area downstairs that provided more than enough
room to dance that worked for me just fine for about 3 hours. Plentiful warm
big smiles and a great vibe. But it was nearly impossible to move around,
just way too crowded. I guess it didn't kill the party for me anyway.

>REMEMBER: WANTING TO HAVE A GOOD TIME AND ACTUALLY HAVING A GOOD TIME ARE

> ...concentration camp!....most badly organized...drivel...comp[lete bloody

It's pretty obvious you were not out to have a good time, and by the sounds
of your descriptives YOU must have been at a different rave. It wasn't the
end all of parties and had some problems but I had a great time, and you
know, i really didn't even have to try.


peace,
martin

Man, I have to definetly disagree that it was a waste. Although WAY too 
many tickets were sold for the venue size, the vibe in the place was out 
of this world. You can't even get into a movie for $5 bucks these days. 
Three DJ's, visuals, and NICE people, for the three or four hours it 
lasted was well worth the 5 dollars. I don't know what party you were at 
but it wasn't F&F....

                                                 Black Adder

P.S. The only thing that really bugged the shit out of me besides the 
overcrowding was the D.J.in the ambient room (allen?) who started playing 
a demonic-sounding reading of the signs of armaggedon from the Old 
Testament with some chick screaming in the back ground. That selection is 
a one way ticket to a bad trip...

I drove up from SJ to got to F&F, but arrived too late! 
I know I'm going to be jealous reading all of the marvelous 
posts about how wonderful and memorable it was. 

I was "seat dancing" in my car all the way home- 
hope you all had a magnificent time!

To celebrate the theft of my motorcycle last thursday I decided to skip
Organic's Saturday GG Park party and work on my taxes instead.  After
a few hours of trying to comprehend my net economic worth to society,
I suddenly noticed that the sun had come out.  Screw it; off to
the park.  

This was the first band shell party to be set up in the renovated
band shell, and it was fun dancing up on the stage.  I didn't find the
raised DJ setup to be a problem, i.e the separation between us and our
shamans seemed minimal.  Jeno was typically engaging and Graeme followed 
with a good set as well.  Another beautiful day in the park.  I hear that 
we can look forward to celebrations there every other week once the summer
starts.

* * *

Janie & I arrived at F&F early and were impressed by the setup.  Tasty 
visuals everywhere, water, candy, murals, literature, eucalyptus trees, 
blinking lights... Was this a labor of love, or what?  I really liked 
the various philisophical slogans that were put up "Underneath 
everything we are all connected (paraphrased)" and the like.  Basic 
fundamental stuff that helps remind us why raves are more than just 
excercises in hedonism.  The 2 main sound systems - SoundVision 
dowstairs and  Pacific's up - have never sounded better to me, like 
they were tuned perfectly for this space.  The ventilation was also 
quite good - as crowed as it got, it never seemed too hot.  

Like all F&Fs, the party got going early, reaching critical mass before
11.  Bryce started things out downstairs with some intense hard trance.
And who was the first DJ upstairs?  A little funkier, and quite 
excellent.  By 12, the party was packed.  This cramped our ability to 
dance freely but the incredible vibe compensated for that.  Everyone 
seemed totally into the music, shouting, clapping, raised hands.  And 
people pretty much stayed put, not a lot of the constant shoving and
unfocused moving about that often destroys the sense unity at many large
crowded commercial parties I've attended.  

Yes, the venue was oversold; the only real flaw in the equation.  With
a crowd stuck ouside (and very visible from the street) I had 
premonitions of a bust.  But by around 2, things had started to thin out
just enough to allow easy in&outs.  I had no trouble finding room to 
dance downstairs by the DJ where Ethan was going off like a madman.  I
really felt like this event was a historic moment for the underground
scene.

Then a small army of policepeople joined us and just didn't seem to be
able to get into the spirit of things.  They seemed cordial enough
once it became clear that we weren't going to be any trouble for them.  
The firemarshalls sure didn't look  happy.  Maybe having this party across 
the street from the firehouse had something to do with that.  Have to admit
though, this *was* a firetrap - but there's little that can be done about 
that.  People of all ages are *desperate* for the chance to come together 
and share their love of music & life with each other.  Until our society 
provides safe and caring environments for that to happen in, we will do 
what we can to fill the need.  We're not just talking about the need for 
some cheap fun.  Raving is quite spiritual for many of us; a (dis)organized
religion to some.

I stuck around with a few others to help clean up, break things down, 
load, etc.  Ethan was calm and cool about everthing.   In my book he's 
a fucking hero.  Bryce chatted with the police, explaining to them
our side of things, building bridges...  There is some hope that Ethan
won't get slammed too hard, thanks to our cooperation and the lack of
any violence, destruction, or major hassles.  All we can do is wait
and see.  

It was 4ish and I still had some energy in me, so I went over to the 
Cyberlab7 party.  It was laid back and uncrowded,  a great place to 
dance off excess energy and wind down.  I really enjoyed the DJs in the 
main room and danced quite a bit. There were a few F&F refugees who 
were also fortunate enough to have gotten the word on this.  

Upon reflection, I also thought about the FMR i missed this week.  The 
demand for good equal-oppurtunity vibeful parties far outstrips the 
supply in this town.  If your try to accomadate everybody, things get out 
of hand.  If you try to go further underground, people get left out.  It's
hard to always guess at the best workable balance.  For those who got 
bummed out by the unfortunate turn of events - there was at least 
something to be learned:  Shit happens and a backup plan is your friend. 

Anyway, thanks to the entire F&F crew for a great 4 hours.  Ethan - you 
know you've got friends who are prepared to help.  If the $ situation is 
really bad, perhaps a killer benefit party might be in order. :)

     Wheeee Heee!
     
     -Another- great thanks to Ethan and Crew for putting on a great rave! 
     The vibe, both upstairs and downstairs was INCREDIBLE! Pure 
     unadulturated frenzy! And the music! WoWiE! I had such a great time 
     dancing my head off ;) ,,,, I didnt really even get a chance to chat 
     to anyone. :(  Plus, the amount of people *was* definitely 
     claustrophobic at many points. Regardless, a great rave with all the 
     great spirits! Hmm, now where was that man with that e-bee? :)

Well Ill speak for Deaks...he wasn't on anything :) And he brought the 
house down with his set. There were an amazing number of smiling faces
all around when he was spinning.

Even tho this party got busted tons of people said how wonderful it was,
even when we were asking people to leave.. they'd say something like :
"No problem.. great party!"
"Best party I've been to all year"

So from what I can tell Kevin, u were in a minority, a *small* minority.
A lot of people put a *lot* of work into this party for free. And I mean 
a *lot* of work, including Deaks who worked his butt off. For $5.. i'm sorry
you didn't get ur money's worth.

There was a problem with overcrowding.. but an honest attempt was made to 
solve this problem before the event..."the best laid plans of mice and men":)
People actually went to Kinkos and made copies of the tickets...
But another way of saying this was that there were just *too* many smiling
faces there... dat's ok with me :)

All I can say to u Kevin... if u didn't have fun there (shit I had fun and I
was outside for most of it..AND completely sober :) ...
 
..then there's something missing inside you, man!

This is sad because a lot of people come from far and wide for this 
event because it is all agaes.  Hopefully next time they'll know not to 
bother.  People have got better thing's to waist $5 then on drivel like 
this even if it is for a good cause.
In short, a comp[lete bloody farce by all concerned!  (Sorry Ethen!)
REMEMBER: WANTING TO HAVE A GOOD TIME AND ACTUALLY HAVING A GOOD TIME ARE 
TWO COMPLETELY DIFFERENT THING'S.

Dear Kevin:

Well, my friend, it is apparent from your post that you did not have a good
time at Friends & Family.  Gee, that's too bad.  You see, if you have a bad
time at a rave that people truly put their hearts into -- in organizing,
producing, and spreading a good vibe (I mean, come on, boxes of Blow-pops,
free fruit, water!!) and taking the wrap when it gets busted -- then I fear
that you may never enjoy a rave again.  I agree it was hot, it was crowded
and it was not close in proximity to everyone who came, but tell me Kevin,
how many raves have you been to (good raves that is) that have not been
hot, crowded and right next door to everyone who went?  And you cap on the
five dollar cover?!  I won't even acknowledge that...

In short, I know the people who worked on this event.  They did it out of
the goodness of their hearts, for three months, for *YOU*.  I will not
tolerate you bashing them unjustly.  You speak for yourself, Kevin, not the
whole.  Sounds like you were an island in an ocean of good vibes.  You are
right, there is a diffence between wanting to have a good time and actually
having one, and there's also a diffence between having something
constructive to say about an event and being a complete and obtuse asshole!

Now as for my take on F&F:

Thank you, thank you, thank you...Ethan a group of us spoke later and
agreed that we will fight this with you to the end.  It goes beyond this
one bust.  It bites at the core of our existance as an alternative social
scene, our cohesive group, our family.  

It was clearly evident that the organizers were in this wholeheartedly. 
Yes there were limitations to the space, but every means available was made
to work around them.  The chill-room especially had a nice, warm glow to
it. Which is why I wanted every one to "appreciate this!"  Great visuals by
Michael Clay, great set by Lee An...

Unfortunately it was busted.  Your higher spiritual power only knows what
would have happened if it had gone on all night.  :^}

Having warmed up the Blue Cube prior to the event, Greg was only too kind
to let me run around and tell people to go there to work off their
respective buzzes.  And it turned out great, for a spontaneaous event. 
Thanks to everyone who showed up.  We were proud to provide the
opportunity.  And "thanks!" to Greg (and his sleeping roommate) who let us
invade his place. We didn't have a DJ spin, but Kenneth Paul stepped up to
the tape deck and soaked us all in some really great ambient stuff while
the masses lounged around and enjoyed the memories of "the good ole' hours"
at F&F.  I must publicaly thank Ofra for the massage of my life!  I'm sure
others had equally stimulating experiences...  ;^} ;^}

All in all, we had over 100 people spend some quality time in the Cube,
which, for those history buffs, was the site of Friends & Family #2.  We
felt it only fitting that the evening should end up there.

Thanks again, everyone, for making it a night to remember...Oh, and Kevin,
please share the site of the next event that *YOU* organize, because I will
certainly be the first in line for a non-crowded, air conditioned, close to
everyone's home, all ages, less than five dollar for a good cause, free
fruit/water/candy, cool set-up, great sound, great line-up, great
chill-room rave any day of the week!


Tony

P.S. Hey Amy the English major, ("word of the day is hyperbole") send me a line.

Hey, all!

Does anyone know whether the Russian River cleanup party 
is on? postponed? thanks...

&

I screwed up on the name of a recommendation I gave-
it's Franz Fannon, not Fredric Frantz- thanks to Steve for 
asking if I was sure I got it right!

&

That's one of the other things I love about the rave/house scene:
it creates a time and space where it is difficult and sometimes dangerous 
to divorce the personal from the political. Sorry to hear about 
the F&F bust, but I'm glad so many of you had a good time despite 
the adversity. Ethan, if/when you need me, I'm here!

P.S. Ob: history 

Geoff said: You must realize also that history is the story of 
            the "ones who win."

from Salman Rushdie's Shame:

"The ancient Greeks," he said out of the blue, making her spill the ash 
of her cigarette-tip, "kept, in the Olympic games, no records of 
runners-up." 

Then he dresses quickly, but with the meticulous dandyism that she 
had always loved, and left her for good; that sentence was the 
only explanation she ever got. 

But in the years of her isolation she worked it out, she knew that 
history had been waiting for him to notice her, and a man who 
catches history's eye is thereafter bound to a mistress from whom he 
will never escape. History is natural selection. Mutant versions of 
the past struggle for dominance; new species of fact arise, and old, 
saurian truths go to the wall, blindfolded and smoking last cigarettes. 
Only the mutations of the strong survive. The weak, the anonymous, the 
defeated leave few marks: field-patterns, axe-heads, folk-tales, broken 
pitchers, burial mounds, the fading memory of their youthful beauty. 
History loves only those who dominate her: it is a realtionship of 
mutual enslavement."

He says it better than I could.

Greetings Friends!

Well, I'm not sure quite where to start...

I guess first off my sincerest and most heartfelt apologies to any of you
that had a negative or less than positive experience saturday night.

Perhaps a review of what happened (as best we can ascertain) followed by
some interpretation and conclusions may help to clarify the nights events
and at least my position on them...

The short version is: A number of things some within our control and some
beyond our control resulted in crowds of people that *way* exceeded our
expectations and, unfortunately, our ability to manage them effectively.

*We* did not, however, oversell our stated capacity. 740 tickets were
produced, 20 were sold in advance, 50 were held at the door to handle
people that skipped the map point and 670 were sold at the map point. The
crew present totalled approximately 30 people. Thus, but for the events I
will discuss in a moment we should have had 770 people which we as a group
had decided would fit in that space albeit tightly.

However, as noted above, hundreds and hundreds more -- anywhere form
250 - 500 found out where it was and showed up with a variety of stories
both true and false that our overwhelmed door people then had to attempt to
decipher.

This was the result of a few things the details of which we're still trying
to sort out. We do know one thing though: I personally, in a fit of total
madness forgot a stack of prolly 100 maps (but *not* tickets!) at the map
point which was shut down and locked at that point. That door should have
never opened again but it did. There was a band recording inside that got
sick of people continually banging on the door and opened it. What happened
next is still a bit vague however one thing is certain: that stack of maps
went out the door somewhere around midnight. At around 12:30 one of our
staff showed up at the map point and someone very definitely not part of
our group was giving out those maps and may have been selling them. Our
staff person took that stack from them at that point. So it apears that
there was about a half hour window in which those maps were either given
away or sold. By our estimate about 30 people showed up at the site
claiming that they had been sold a map.

In addition to this there were reports of people at kinkos counterfeiting
maps, tickets and/or fliers. As you might also imagine loads of people were
observed trying to transfer stamps from one hand to another. Very sweaty
conditions inside were making valid stamps extremely difficult to verify,
let alone fakes.

So, between roughly 12 and 2, there were was a huge crowd of people outside
the door unable to get in. Some of these were people that had been inside
and decided to go out; some of these were people hoping to buy a ticket at
the door, some may have been sold fake "tickets" and some were clearly
bullshit artists with a variety of stories. I personally saw *no one* that
had a real ticket and was unable to get in.

At about 2:40, most everyone was inside. Unfortunatley the real (and mostly
white ;) gangstas, responding to a tripped burgalry alarm next door, then
arrived not at all expecting what they found. The party was then shut down.
Had that alarrm not been tripped, I (and many others) feel we would have
made it.

But it was, and one of our doormen at the time, Jeff, was put in a choke
hold, handcuffed and arrested. He has been charged with "Obstructing an
Officer", and "Assault and Battery on a Police Officer". I was issued five
misdemeanor citations:

 o No Dancehall Keeper Permit
 o No Place of Entertainment Permit
 o No Cabaret Permit
 o Exceeding The Stated Capacity of the Building
 o Blocked Fire Exit

So, those are the facts as best we can determine so far. I'd like to start
by responding to Tristan's (the kevin keiper account) post cos I think it
frames the main issues fairly well. (Tristan I suggest you start signing
your posts, lest people mistake your sentiments for kevin's).

Yes, we made mistakes but I think you're still missing the point. F&F has
always been an *attempt* to make raves (or whatever) something other than
products to be payed for and consumed. F&Fs have always been ultra low
cost; they have always been benefits at which everyone always works for
free, and *no one* has ever been turned away cos they didn't have the
money. We are trying to *facilitate* NOT FOR PROFIT *community*
celebrations.

Yes, the space was too small for the 1000+ people that showed up. Yes we
were unprepared to deal with 1000+ people. Yes, it was fucking hard do get
in during peak hours. And yes, I understand your frustration and your
anger, and yes, I am sorry.

BUT, YOU had the opportunity to *not* view the whole situation as a bad
product that you were having a hard time consuming. YOU had the opportunity
to see that we were having a hard time. And so my friend, YOU also had the
opportunity to *help us*, had you cared to. Lord knows we could have used
it.

Time and time again life presents us with situations where what is *is*
never mind whose fault it is, and pointing fingers at that point simply
does no good. With a little help and a little patience we could have pulled
this one out.

Nevertheless it brings me great joy that lots of you and others did have a
very good time. So, many, many thanks to all of you for your love, support
and energy.

As I'm sure many of you are curious, here's what happened fiscally: luckily
all of our expenses were covered and, depending on the final disposition of
our security deposit there will be somewhere between $1500 and $1900 left.
This will hopefully cover any fines that Jeff and I are liable for in
addition to benefititing the two groups we intended to benefit.

So once again thank you for your support fiscally and otherwise. I hope you
felt your contribution was well placed. If not, then my apologies once
again. There will be more parties, should you object to or be unable to
afford the donation at any of them, we will (as always) happily let you in
free.

I'll keep the list up to date on our legal proceedings. When and if we need
it, Jeff and I would certainly appreciate your support should you feel so
inclined.

And last but not least, many, many thanks to everyone that helped try and
pull this one off. There are truly too many to list. You all know who you
are. If we're not gonna try it who is? Right Fucking On. Nice job everyone.

lost of love
ethan

Clearly fellow SF raver's were at a different party to then the one that 
I was at last Saturday.  The one I was at was WAY to small for the venue 
in comparrrison to the number of tickets they sold.  The dj line-up, 
while immpressive, was blighted by the fact that, while it lasted, they 
had all decided to play the worst set of their lives.
This has to have been the most badly organized party on the SF 
underground in recent years.  This was a shame because a lot of people 
had travvelled a fair distance and had been looking forward to the party 
for a long time.  Let me give them a word of advice: NEXT TIME DON'T BOTHER!
And that goes to all the organizer's (sorry Ethen) and the people who 
went their. 
REMEMBER: REALLY WANTING TO HAVE A GOOD TIME AND ACCTUALLY HAVING ONE IS 
NOT THE SAME THING!

But I hope that people went to free Organic party in the park that was 
held Saturday day.  Now that's what a party should hbe like.

Clearly you either went to different rave thren me or you were on so many 
good drugs that you would have had a good time in a concentration camp!
F&F was, with out a doubt, the most badly organized party organized in SF 
in recent months...
------------------
As far as the  the overcrowding, my (our) sincerest apologies. It was 
rumored early on that someone had taken the B&W ticket 
to Kinko's and run off 300 counterfeit copies - a pretty significant 
number when you consider only 750 were originally printed. This was 
confirmed when the tickets taken at the door were counted. Now that we 
know that there's people out there sad enough to counterfeit $5 tickets to 
a benefit party, we can take preventative steps in the future. Again, sorry 
if you were held at the door or if the population inside was 
uncomfortable. It was not our intention.

Other than the crowding, however, everyone else (including myself!) 
seems to agree that this party >went off<! Fucking amazing sets by so 
many of the DJs! People showed up with a vibe that brought it all 
together, "let go, and took the next step," and reminded you why people 
throw these parties in the first place. 

Also... Kevin, your comment about "good drugs" shows a real lack of 
understanding of what this scene is about. Deaks and many others carried 
the vibe to its full effect with good old water and positive attitude. And 
(even though this may be as cheap a shot as your original comment) if you 
think drugs make a bad party good, then you've probably never tried any.

Ironic side note... while the SFPD was committing the resources of eight 
officers and a van to breaking up our party, someone a couple blocks 
away was busting the window of my car to get the stereo.

You know, that first post from keiper's account (whoever it was who
actually wrote it) was sort of bearable, but this kind of trashing
in the second posting deserves, in my humble opinion, this much
attention:

wow!  yeah, me and my girlfriend were in line for the bathroom when you

i beg to differ with that mode of thinking on the grounds that it might 
encourage negative thinking to the people that are reading this 
statement.  

i didn't make it to f&f, because i was late.  i instead tried to go to a 
basics, which was actually 2 weeks ago...on the way there, my accelerator 
cable stuck, and i almost died...but i ended up at denny's and saw zak 
and jordan...we hooked up for a bit...then i drove back to santa cruz 
with very little sleep...i really wanted to have a good time, and i did!

I am one of those who "travelled a fair distance"
I travelled from Portland for F & F, and it was WELL WORTH IT. I had a 
wonderful experience and my heart goes out to all of those who put it 
together, those who I met and those I didn't! Thank you! I would fly 
down again without a 2nd thought. Please don't let posts like the above 
discourage you from continuing to put together events like F & F. DO 
BOTHER. It is appreciated.

Friends and Family was awesome before its untimely shutdown. For 
atmosphere it surpassed any rave I've been to over here and in England as 
well. We introduced a couple of our friends to a rave and we couldn't 
have picked a better one to start them off at, they had the night of 
their lives they said. Deaks played a great set which got the place going 
really nicely, and then Tim Mcknew took it up a gear and played a 
fantastic set which luckily the cops didn't interrupt until the very last 
tune. Mcknew set the upstairs on fire and I think that the cops may have 
arrived because his set was Too Good. Anyway it was a tragedy that it got 
busted but while it lasted it was amazing despite the fact there may have 
been a couple too many people in there. Well done to all those who put so 
much effort into it and I cant wait until next time, and I hope it comes 
around before the middle of June because I shall be returning to the U.K. 
and I would love to get one more Friends and Family in before I go.
             Cheers
             Dan Wilson
p.s. Friends and Family tour of England to come in the future? No busts 
guaranteed.

Subject: F&F: Flight of the Bumble Bee or Oops!!!!.........
Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk


.......................back to the drawing board............


(Scene)......

Imagine, if you will, a little hive (Kommotion), and little a half-mad,
swarming party of bees can't get a ticket sweest, ambrosia, or rave-honey (to
which they are addicted) is being served for $5.OO.

In their increasing agitiation, they swarm about the location, getting
increasing louder and angrier..."buzz,buzz...Where's the party?....buzz,
buzz,"Got an extra ticket?".....buzz, buzz,..."Who can get me
in?"....buzz,buzz,.."I'll make some clone-tickets," thinks one enterprizing
party-bee......

Meanwhile........back at the Big Hive......a large swarm of honey-hungry
raver-bees are seething and jostling about the entrance to the hive, whose
walls are already thud-shuderring, humming, and pulsing with rave
energy!!!!!!

!Buzz, Buzz, "Let me in" they cry, wail, and cajole at the door
bees....zzzzz......zzzzzz....zzzzz.......zzzzz....

Inside, the raver-bees who made it, seem to be willing to put up with any
slight, minor, trivial, or unimportant aspect of a party; room to dance,
places to chill, places to piss, ventilation, security or escape in case of a
fire.......

The buzzing desire for rave, or transcendence via drugs and dance suppresses
any notion or safety for themselves and others......

* A powerful scene.....Yes.......One in which this party-bee was also
campletely taken up in......no excuses.........But, give consideration,
thoughtfulness, and  wisdom it's due......*

...... "What came first?  The fire laws or the fires?......

Without sounding heavyhanded, there are thousands of dead garment
workers, and operators of sweatshops or thought "I won't happen here,

it won't happen this time..." who would answer from the grave.

.....back inside the throbbing beehive....an underage raver passes out in an
aisle way from too much alcohol. (It could have been any drug, he could have
been dead...) Other rave-hungry bees are beginning to step over, and on him
to get into the next room. 

His friends drag him on top of them because there is no room...could they
have gotten him out of the building in a hurry if necessary?

But, the music.....yes, the music.....so powerful, enthralling, sweeping
everyone up into a pandemonium, and (I'll say it)  an ecstacy of emotion
through dance.......Yes, that music could have brought the house down....and
that's what scared me.

......(IMHO) there has been too much criticism, and not enough wisdom,
knowledge, and self-reflection....recently. I'm for a

"Friends, Family and Not Flames...." campaign........

 Is the sheer greatness, or magnetism of the music enough to justify so great
a risk?

 Here @ Sfraves, we have often installed themselves selves as the great
experts or "arbitors of taste," when it comes to raves. We have shredded,
dismantled, dismembered, and second-guessed, other parties or promoters;
i.e., Cool World, for failing to provide adequate security, a safe
envirnoment, etc......

..For the ocean of criticism we have dumped on others, I think that a drop of
self-criticism is due here.....

"One is never so generous with criticism when it comes to one's self......"

I do regret what that party might have been. It will probably enter the
annals of legendary parties for the brief 4 hours anyway....which says even
more about how great it was......

Moral of the Flight of the Bumble Bee: The Pleasure Principle meets the
Reality Principle--The SF Law and Police

 (In hindsight only)...I think we should have had the balls to shut the party
down ourselves!!!!!!!

That certainly would have been Sf rave historic if we had closed it down...
Backed everyone out...Cause we promised on the tape we would close the party
at 650 people, and we didn't do that..........But's it's what we promised on
the phone tape message....

In future, I think we should have the REAL  friends and family buy the
tickets in ADVANCE, take pre-cautions with the tickets, Count people at the
door, and keep our integrity......

The fact that the party is a regenegade seems to me a flimsy excuse to risk
lives and damage our reputation.......

As a disclaimer, this is not a finger-pointing for what people did, it is
only a reminder of what the "sins of omission" could result in. The party was
legendary in my mind, and in my experience of it. We should condider
ourselves lucky. The people at the recording studio would have been right to
call the cops and bust the party. We were interfering with their legal right
to make music......(But, I think if they had heard ours, they would have
joined the party too!!!!!)

If we don't put in correction  for the next party, (I forget who said it to
me)..

we should change the name to "Friends & Family and Everybody Else and His
Brother."

 .      ....Forever in Flames...

                                          I am, ...as always,....... your
humble 
                                           servant,

I was one of the unlucky ones (well, me and a group of friends anyhow) who
didn't make it up to the city in time for F&F.  We arrived  at around
12:30ish and there were some people milling around front who told us about
the lack of tickets.  <sigh!>  So we went to (I think) All Together Now, for
a couple hours, which was so-so...and then went to F&F at around 3:30ish, to
see if it had thinned enough so we could get in, and were told that it had
gotten busted.   SO BUMMED!  So my question to the people who put F&F on is
this;  (and I know you just got fined, and the party got busted, so perhaps
this isn't the best time to ask, and I am NOT trying to be insensetive...just
curious), will there be another one put on anytime soon?  In a larger
location, etc?    I was at the last two, and was SO anticipating this
Saturday, and was so SAD that we had missed it, and so...I just wanted to
know if there had been anything in the works??
Thanks so much!

The full moon offically occured about an hour before sunrise.  I looked in 
the paper and if I am correct it said that the full moon was around 4 or 5 am
since the party was grooving hard at that time, Garth was playing, it was 
phat.  During Garth's set my friends watched whales that were chilling just
on the other side of the cliff.

The vibe was definately on and I think the whales could sense the energy.
This was truely one of the best experiences that I have ever had at a Full 
Moon.  I have to say, 4 years, and still going strong.  

Hopefully we will see you next month.

I would disagree,  I think he's rather inconsistent. When he's on it's great
but he's not always in top form.

i usually just like it or hate it.

Speaking from past experiences, meth and coke are just not part of the 
rainbow.  Untill you see/experince the dark side of these drugs I guess that
you will never understand.  The government seems to import a lot of coke
from Columbia.  They seem to like substances that box people in (heroin,
coke, speed)  

Whenever at a party with a lot of tweekers it seems like Ego Rave to me.
everyone just seems to be waiting for something and in a hurry.  Maybe this 
accounts for the gang rape that B.D shared with us.

>So pot smoking leads to carpet spraying of ozark forests and coke to
>massive deforestation in Columbia, thru our government's war on drugs.
                                                                                                                   
Where did you get this information?  I don't know if the ozark thing is 
correct.  The Hemp movement isn't just about getting high.
Ever think that maybe our goverment is spraying those forests because they
'suspect' that there is pot growing there and it's easier to kill everything first
then investigate whether or there were plants there.

No flames intentioned.

i hear doc spin every week and have more or less for over a year
when he's good he's damn good.. a large part of the
la scene is (well, was..) built solely around him

when's he's bad.. he's okay.. he can get in a rut,
but if he's doing a special gig or somethign he usually goes all out

he plays MOSTLY tribal stuff but has recently been playign
a lot of trancier stuff...
his forte is definitely house, divas and all, but he's good with
most of the more popular techno styles

Sorry that Mark and I weren't there for the party.  We've heard some 
interesting tales though.

Being that I was scheduled to dj at 4:15 am, We were at home trying to get 
some sleep, which we did.  I set my alarm for 11pm but it failed to go off 
resulting in my not waking up till around 2:30 am.

We hopped a cab and arrived at the party around 3 am.
The party had been shut down (bummer, I had a special set planned for this 
one).  I hope that there will be a future F&F and the possibility of getting to 
play.  After this Mark and I got another cab and went to grab a bite.  It was
so beautiful out that we decided to walk home from the castro.

I hope that everyone had a good time regardless.

For those of you that would like to hear Galen and I, We will be playing at
Brothers and Sisters @ 1015 Folsom on Friday the 24th.  For anyone who is 
interested, Mark and I will have Free Passes for anyone that wants to come 
down and catch a groove with us.  The Passes should be available by 
Wednesday.
The Line-up:  Corey 10-12
                        Galen 12-2
                        Garth 2-4

>I need comments on dj Doc Martin from L.A.

>Thanks in advance

>E-mix

I first heard Doc Martin spin in 1989 when I lived in OC and he was playing 
New Beat at LA wharehouse parties.  LA ravers have elevated him to diety 
status.  I heard him in SF a few years ago at "Mr Rogers Neighborhood" and he 
played the classic "Wicked" style trancy house that we all know and love.  It 
was a good set but not the mind boggling noise that one would expect 
considering his reputation. I heard him spin again at Sound Factory when he 
opened for Sasha. Sasha was late and Doc spun for a good 5 hours (thats 
endurance), but again nothing truly special.

I think that he is suffering from severe DJ burnout.  There is no Art to his 
sets, its like he just goes through the motions.  Great music but no vibe.  He 
has a mix CD out that he did for Urb magazine.  I haven't heard it, it might 
be pretty good.  The playlist has alot of good classic stuff on it like 
"Spirit" by phuture (good stuff!).  I've seen the CD at housewares, they would 
probably play it for you if you ask.  

Better that you be the judge, after all, one man's e is another man's etc, 
etc.


See Ya.

What was the program about anyways?  Did it present an extremely biased
opinion depicting raves as underground havens for drug addicts and killers?
I hate the people who create those programs.  If you give a brief
synopsis, I'd appreciate it.

Thanks =)

   I know plenty of people have already expressed their opinions 
about this party...I'd like to say that I really had a good time
while it lasted...And I definately don't regret going.  I believe
everyone involved tried their best to throw an incredible party
(and were quite successful)...It's really unfortunate that 
things turned out the way they did, but we can always look forward
to the next party.  Thanks to _everybody_ that helped out  =)
   
    To those who helped clean up:  did anybody happen to find
a Fugi disposable camera and a stuffed Super Grover (Sesame Street)?
My housemates lost them  =(  if anybody found them, please let 
me know.  thank you very much...

well, too bad f&f did not last all night.  *sigh*  a lot of planning
and heart went into it, but due to overcrowding unfortunately things
did not go as planned.

in my mind, it will always be what someone (philip, maybe?) dubbed it
the night of:  the Japanese bullet train party.  i have never in my
life seen so many people jammed so tight into a place before.  it was
absolutely terrifying at first, but then i started to kind of like it.
i guess you all remember the orginal complaints about the kommotion
parties?  that they were too crowded!  do you remember the anonymous
complaint to the fire marshall about this particular thing?  whew!

a very weird dynamic was operating that night:  even though people were
crammed in like sardines, it seemed like nobody wanted to leave.  people
kept advising eachother:  better not go out or you won't get back in!
also, once i got used to the press and the heat, i started kind of liking
the vibe of being part of the bullet train, rocketing at the speed of
light to goddess-knows-where.

the music i heard that night was infused with insane energy..the dj's
were responding to the crowding, i bet.  and the ambient room was outa-
sight.  thank you new moon!  (i didn't help set up so i am not being
a narcissist here)

all that said, i thank our lucky stars that the worst that happened was
that the party got shut down.  like i said, i was terrified that any
second somebody was going to start freaking out.  but the vibe held,
thank you thank you thank you.

here's my suggestions for the future..i hope they help:

(1) raise the price, but let people who want to help set up, break
down, get in for free.  $5 (was that the price?) is too little.

(2) don't encourage people to get there early anymore.  

(3) make sure you have experienced door people working the door...
(or at least folks with thick skins who can keep smiling no matter what)

(4) sell half as many tickets as you think the space will hold and
get ready to take people's money at the door.  because the night of, the
location WILL get out!

well, i know many of you of course disagree with my suggestions, (i'm
betting the price one will rankle) but they are just one girl's ideas
so please don't be offended.  all in all, i thought it was an absolutely
incredible party while it lasted, despite the various problems.

oh yes, one more thing:  i think it's time to move ff to the richmond
civic center.  (hee hee!)

seeya!

That's what I took his post to mean anyway.  But here's some more info.  A
lot of you have probably heard it before and I certainly don't mean to be
preaching to the choir.  Just seemed like a good time to bring it up again
to think about.  Take care.

Hey all,

Checked out a new weekly last night @Il Pirata (16th&Utah).
Kudos to Ann for explaining to me that I needed to go out ;)

I heard this one referred to variously as "Every Sunday" or 
"Every Fuckin' Sunday"; take your pick.

We got there about 11pm? I really wasn't paying attention. Very mellow
crowd; old and new faces. Got to hook up with a few people I haven't seen
for months, yay! We left b4 closing, but it was supposed to go until ~3:30.

The space is a small bar/restaurant, it looked like there were maybe 50 of
us there at most; a little less than full and much less than crowded.
The front was well lit without being over-powering; think family bar instead
of chill room. Mona tripped it out a bit, though. The effect was nice; there's
supposed to be a different twist on it every week. Harlan did his visual magic
in the dance room; it went down smoothly with the audio.

Spent most of my time talking but caught some of the music; lots of slow and
slower hip-hop beats as the evening wore on. Markie dropped the needle on 
something I've never heard before, but I'm not out often, so maybe someone on
the list has. *Real* slow back-beat, mostly bass and drum w/o cymbals, 
occasional soft offbeat kicks from a high register glass-bell like synth and 
some light use of what sounded like highly processed (wah and echo) 
reggae samples. Is this ambient dub? Someone point me at a suitable record 
store bin if you can tell me what it is! This is nice to dance to, especially 
when you're tired. It provides alot of room to move around in.

Sorry to hear about F&F, didn't make this one, but every one of them I've been
to in the past was a blast. At least now you know you can fill a bigger space!

Random past and present thought connection from the list:

	Getting a suitable space is the number one problem for everything.
Rising rent costs force people onto the street (you could flop in a downtown
hotel for $50 a month or less as recently as 15 years ago). Most of us spend 
most of our $$$ on rent, probably. We need space for parties... <segue to
the effect of technology on rave culture thread> ... in the future every place
of business will be used for something 24hrs/day. Offices in downtown high
rises will become dance floors as portable computers/phones and foldable
partitions are tucked away... floor 24, crash out, floor 25, chill room,
floor 26, hard-trance... every bedroom will have sound proofed walls as a
matter of course... no more noise complaints ... someone pinch me, ok?

POint well taken but don't forget Ethen that I was part of the biggest 
underground sound system in London for 21/2 years.  We did illegal 
parties every week where we would get at least 1,000 (and sometimes up 
to five thousend) people a week and we never made the mistake of having 
to small a venue.  Not to sound patronizing but maybe you should talk to 
a British sound system about throwing break-in's because you clearly need 
a few pointer's (or, more to the point, is it the people you were working 
with?) in how to do it.  Firstly, never have the map point at a well 
known place: always have it in a very obscure location.  Secondly, once 
you at capacity shut the doors and only let people out through the exit 
door which should never be the same as the entrance door.  Thirdly, 
always have a lawayer present at the rave so that when babylon come you 
have some one their who know's if what they are doing is illegal.  There 
Are other rules but these are the main one's.
Look at the Rock Against Reagen tour of the early eighties which was also 
a totally illgal tour that never got busted once mainly because they 
obeyed the above rules.  It worked very for us too.  So please bear this 
in mind so that you can start playing at parties that are worthy of your 
considerable talents and dedication to the SF scene.
Yours, Tristan

having been on sfraves for the past month, i've been truly inspired by 
the way everyone helps each other out. the support that everybody gives 
to each other is second to none, considering noone has to even care at all.
this os my chance to ask for help. about a week ago i loaned my 
turntables and my skillz to my 'friends' for a house party. i figured no 
problem, since they're my tables i can just relax and have a good time. 
right.you see, i happen to love jungle; the drum n bass. been into it for years 
now. well my 'friends' didn't take so kindly to the music. after i got 
kicked off my OWN tables, i wuz told i wuz lucky i didn't get my ass 
kicked. i took it all in stride, altho i was so pissed at these closed 
minded fuks. my 'freinds' started telling me that jungle isn't music, its 
a bunch of noise, and that everyone hates it.
this angers me so, cause i know people will love this if they are just 
given a chance to hear it. 
this is where sfraves come in. if you are a promoter, or know a promoter,
 
email me and i can hook you up with my mix tape. 

peace, dj thad

Everybody wanted to have a good time; this does not mean that the party 
went off.  As far as the drug thing goes I don't take them anymore but I 
used to and I know the fustration that comes with taking your E only to 
get their and it being to crowded to dance and then it getting stopped; 
that's what I meant by that comment.  And yes, parties where 
everyone are on good drugs does make for a bvetter party although I 
have A better time at raves now then I ever did before and I have 
never been so straight in my life so I can see that this may be a 
bit of a patronizing attitude.  (Anyway, drugs are so week in this 
town, aprt from pot, that it is not really worth the bother).  I guess 
thisa is what happens when young people are limmited to where they can go 
because it is so rare that there is a chance of them going to a decent 
rave that they are just desperate to have a good time.  I found the whole 
atmosphere their very artificial which is the trade mark of a bad party.
Yoursd, Tristan

Dear Sfraves;

	As I read more and more about what happened to F&F, the more & 
more angry I become. All I have to say to the anti-event people who 
committed such an unthinkable, low life, rotten act, you can run, but you 
can't, hide. Their are 200-300 people out their who know who you are, 
that know what you look like, and eventually, when you find your sorry ass 
at a party, someone will regonize you, you stupid chicken shit jerks!!!!
I cannot say what will happen to you, but just a suggestion, I would 
leave this scene and never come back. I hope I run into your sorry ass in 
a dark alley somewhere, TRASH!!!!! You sold out one of the kinder, 
gentler parts of OUR scene, I hope you enjoy the money, try not to OD on it.

Tact is the better part of valor and I guess I failed on this point.  I 
should remeber this for next time.  I was not/am  angry about it all just 
dissapointed.  I did not like the music but I can see that other people

Dear Robert J;


	If defense of the promoters, Ethan M., the F&F staff, and myself, but
I'm just curious. Did you not see the fire extingushers, did you not see
me, maning the first aid station, certifed by the american red cross?

	I don't know to many events that have first aid available from a
qualified person. The only time first aid seems to be available at events
is when I show up, not to blow my own horn, but its true. 
	
	F&F's was the first event where an actual first aid area was
provided for. WHich included a full first aid kit, bendine, gause,
banages, blood pressure cuff, thermometer(with cover), saline solution(eye
injury), latex gloves, and don't laugh, super glue(because it bonds skin
instanly, and in a life threating situation it can save you),...etc 

	I take offense to say that we weren't prepared and ready for
accidents, some people just aren't tuned in. We had more stuff there than
most big corporations provide in their messly little first aid kits, I
know I worked for several, and couldn't even get a bandaid. If you gonna
make comments like that make sure you first ask the people who were
responsible for providing those services, and also open your eyes, if you
saw the massage table you found the first aid station, with a working fire
extingusher next to it. The F7F staff knew where everything was, and who 
to go to in the event of an emergency, and I never left my massage table 
once the night started, not even to dance!!!!

Subject: Singer Wanted For good House...
Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

I hope no one minds me posting this...  It is rave related, just not the
common post.  I figured SF Raves would be a good start to find a singer who
is really into the vibe of clubs and/or Raves.  Im currently looking for a
singer to do some Trance and House projects.  I really want a female singer
but I would not be totaly closed to a male...  I just would prefer a female
vocalist.  I have been writing  dance music for many years but this will be
the first time I will be using a vocalist (besides in a rock group format).
 I have 3 projects I am currently working on: 1 acid house/ Trance, 1 Deep,
and 1 ambiant beat (someone who is capable of Enya type stuff would be
interesting for this one).
Anyone interested (or if you know someone who might be) please E me or
call... (although humans at my house do NOT take good messages but the
machine does so...)
Thanks,
Rob

None of this would have done any good if anything serious had happened.
Normaly I don't realy care for fire codes, but there was a very dangerous
situation going on in that building. I'd estimate that there were 600+
people crammed upstairs with the only exit being the already crowded
stairs. It was very obviously completely out of their control & although I
was very pissed about getting stuck outside for an 1 1/2hr breath of air
it was a very good call by them, even though having 200 people hanging out
outside is not very inconspicuous. The thing that realy got me was that it
was a limited capacity party, which IMHO realy sucks, most hardcore people
don't show up before 2am let alone 11:30, I think they should have found
a bigger & safer venue. There were alot of unfamiliar faces & most of my
friends slacked to hard to get there on time. On a good note there was alot
of energy, they did a very good job decerating the place & it was only $5.
Thanks to all the people that *atleast tried* to put on a good cheap party.

Dear Josh;

	I must admit I never saw the upstairs, but downstairs didn't seem
that crowded, and yeah I told you I never left my massage table. So when
you say crowded, do you mean the first 25 rows at a Grateful Dead Concert,
or Metallicca, or do you mean crowded like any given Wicked.

	I agree a building colaspe, no we couldn't handle, but multiple
cases of dehydration, or heat prostration, a bad trip or two,
lasserations, bruses, yes, especially if I had someone steady to count on
tranfering people to a hospital ER.  It requires some really dedicated,
clear, responsible people. Even though I'm trained to be able to deal with
everything up to and including a heart attack(CPR), I don't want to ever
have to be that clear and responsible.

	As far as what I think of the building, I us to be a Test Engineer
and I really don't know that much about structural stuff. But in human
factors engineering the average human is considered to weigh 150lbs(if any
one has an ISO Standard Handbook on that I would appreiate the exact
fiqure)(I'm such a geek):), whether or not the building could safety
withstand:

	(150 * the number of people upstairs * modified by the fact that
	their moving * modified inversely by the short duty cycle of the
	load on the structure * modifeid inversely by the fact that the 
	load is spread out)/2000 = the number of tons on the 2nd floor. 

Who's really to say but a Structual Engineer whether it was really safe or
not. It was one of the old buildings, the kind that they don't make
anymore, its withstood a few earthquakes, I image we weren't in danger of
what we call in the test eng. biss, a catastrophic failure, but this is
California were I've decided anything can happen. And besides if it 
wasn't dangerous it wouldn't be any fun. :)

	If any thing I thing people had a better chance of getting killed
due to the fact they had to drive a car before they were ready. Just my
clammer thoughts. The fact is no one got hurt, at least no one came to see
me for first aid. I think its great that we can put 750 of us together and
have fun, and love and respect each other.  That even though some people
tried to destory a good time, most had one any way. Thats whats important
and no matter what happen-ed/s I hope we never lose sight of that.

Brian, we're really glad and appreciative that you lent your
safety skills to the party.  But I still think you've overlooked the
main danger, which was fire.  Even with a fire extinguisher, you
main not have been able to get there in time considering the crowd
and ensuing panic that might have occured.  Despite the no smoking
signs, we witnessed people smoking and flicking their ashes on the
mattresses they were sitting on. =:-O

This problem is not unique to F&F.  Current laws make it nearly
impossible to find cheap, safe, all nite, all age indoor venues.  
Another reason why outdoor renegades are preferable.

Lee

Yes, another thanks for that space. I had no idea where we were, but it 
was dark, musical, and friendly.

I don't know if the F&F crew are up for hearing suggestions, but I'm 
going to take my chance.  
A major problem of the night was the copying of tickets.  When I went to 
Basics last November, they had a special stamp on the back of the 
ticket.  Maybe if all the tickets were numbered on the back - up to, what 
was it, 750? - then no one could get in without a numbered ticket.  Add 
to that maybe a mark with one of those invisible ink markers that you can 
only see under a black light, so that if anybody trying to forge numbers 
on the back of the ticket will get yet another surprise.  The only 
problem with doing all that is that it takes alot of time to do, but I 
think it could work.  Just my 2 cents worth for the day.....


luv,
Amy

  gopher://gldfs.cr.usgs.gov:79/0quake

this shows all the earthquakes worldwide for the past 24 hours...

whut i wuz wondering, is: 

  are there any gopher gurus out there who could help me throw together
    an automated gopher retriever?  i'd like to plop it onto hyperreal
      and then produce a worldwide plot of the data on my homepage....

do you think that by saying over and over that you had a shitty time that
people will 
be led like lambs to agree with you? 
we that got involved really tried. your continuous babble about your
"holier than thou" 
skill level at party throwing only makes us wonder why your efforts weren't
a part of the process: 
were they? 
 
a post went out to SFR asking for any help throwing this party. we took
what showed up 
and made the best effort we could, AND IT WENT THE F*CK OFF, if you ask me.

Maybe brian mcgonigle's suggestion to use the rich. civ .ctr. is a good
one. FNF is 
obviously experiencing an unexpected growth spurt(ask ethan about raising
kids) with all 
its attendant pains, but your self-serving, whining posts are just salt in
wounds that need 
to be healed so we can get on with planning a worthy successor to this
loving effort of so many 
giving people. 
FNF needs the help of folks like yourself. quit being the consumate
critic...get in on the game. 
your energy wuold be much better spent. 
peace&positivity, 
GREG

Tact is the better part of valor and I guess I failed on this point.  I 
should remeber this for next time.  I was not/am  angry about it all just 
dissapointed.  I did not like the music but I can see that other people 
may like it  Sorry!
Tristan
-------------------------------------------
No problem! I got just a bit overwrought too. We're all passoniate about the
things we love! Perhaps we can all take comfort in that in this area there's
many people throwing very different parties virtually every week. It also, ahem,
seems I may not have gotten my facts straight vis a vis the ticket
counterfeiting. Guess that's what happens when you speak for the group (the F&F
collective) without the group's consent.
take care!

In the mist of a somewhat of a tragidy with the cops breaking up the 
party, it was really nice to see the way all the ravers dealt with the 
police.  As I helped clean up and the cops walked around taking pictures, 
conficating evidence, I was appreciative of the reactions of all those 
present.
Things could have been much worse, if people decided to meet the cops 
with attitude.  They looked plenty prepared with a van and the number of 
them to really have made the shutdown real ugly.  Those that were present 
stayed cool, continued with a peaceful vibe despite the disappointment.  
Thanks to everyone's peacefulness, I think helped nuturalize an intitial 
aggressiveness from the cops.  I don't think it would have taken much, 
for things to escalate into a much worse situation.  
As dissappointing as it is for me to see the cops show up at our raves, 
its nice to see some good relations take place with them, hoping it will 
help cut down on future hassles.

Please don't be angry. Yeah, it's a pretty awful thing to counterfeit
tickets for--a benefit for two such worthy causes--but please don't
let anger dominate your feelings over it. Remember it for all the good
it served, for the wonderful times had, and, should things work out for
the best, that it will still benefit these causes.

We're not about resentment. At worst, we learned a lesson, and we'll
do better next time. At best, we've seen how our community pulls
together in times of trouble, and it really warms my heart to see it.

I talked with Ethan in person last night, and (sorry if I embarrass
you) his impish grin is as impish as ever, and his enthusiasm is
still, well, very catching :).

So _smile_ when you think of F&F :) :) :). Karma will take care of the
people who do bad things; we want to focus on doing some good things.

:)

Sean

PS - Think a bunch of computer technodweebs can work solutions to
things like queueing and ticket counterfeiting? Mmmmm... could be... :)

I just got to my e-mail, and was curious to see what the response would be
to the party...

I just had to add my two cents.

GREAT FUCKING PARTY, even in spite of the shutdown. Even though I don't go
out all that much anymore, I haven't seen a vibe like that in years
(obviously this was my first FNF), since before the days of Toontown...

I don't really understand the point of criticizing the people who so
obviously put a lot of heart and soul into it, the overcrowding situation
was clearly out of anyone's control. It's a shame that there are those
willing to take advantage of good intentions.

Though I doubt anyone who counterfeited tickets is on this list, a message
to you: you don't get it, try something like the DV8 next time you can't
get in somewhere... It was made abundantly clear that the map point would
be sold out early, that the party would be crowded so get there early.
Those words weren't just for show or to try to get people to come out a
little earlier.

And another thing... standing outside a party waiting to get in is no fun,
especially if you've already bought your ticket. It's a frustrating
situation to be sure, BUT IT HELPS NO ONE to clamor and try to force your
way into the door. Most especially when the only point of access was in
such a crowded spot to begin with.


Now that I've vented, I'm really bummed that I didn't get to meet anyone
from the list Saturday. It was just to damned crowded. I still had a great
time though, maybe we can meet another time.


A BIG THANKS and kudos to those involved with making it happen.



-Brian Benitez

I too wanted to extend my thanks to Greg for opening up his place on 
Saturday... and to Tony for the invitation.  I had a great time 
chillin'  ....met lots of great people, good music, and great red lights. 
Thanks again.

I am posting the message below on behalf of the entire group of people
who produced Friends and Family.  Thank you for your patience.



============================================================================

Greetings, friends and family!

As many of you know, the Friends and Family anniversary went off in San
Francisco last weekend.  You probably also know that we were shut down
by the police.  The event had much going right, and some things went
wrong.  The Friends and Family collective will be making a statement
about the party in the next few days.  Since we are a diverse group of
people, we ask for your patience while we collectively prepare our
statement.

In the meantime, we thank everyone who participated in the event.  We apologize
to all who were inconvenienced or turned away.  We also request that anyone
who has any information or was a witness to the behavior of the police at the
event to please contact us at the address ( fandf@ultima.org ). If
you'd like to make a comment to the Friends and Family collective, please
send us email at that address.

Thank you very much.

The Friends and Family crew

To all,

After reading many of the reviews, I have concluded that much of what I would
say here has already been said.  I would like to add a few words, however, to
let those involved in the planning of it that *yet another person* (me) thought
it was one of the best events they've seen.  I brought 9 people along; for many
of them it was their first rave.  They all thought it was truly an amazing
thing.  To quote a friend of mine, who looked on wide-eyed across the dance
floor: "I never knew something like this was possible!"

For those of you who made it to the BLUE CUBE (my home) for the post-bust,
ad-lib after-party, I thank you all for coming and relaxing with us.  It truly
was a peaceful gathering, even though the space was crowded and entropy
abounded.  We managed to support over 100 people in a two person house!
  
Special thanks to Melissa ('ello, me love) for excavating the downstairs with
me.  Props to Tony and Ed for being crowd control and general, all-around cool
folks.  (and yes Tony, I "appreciate this!")  Hello to Sy, Eva, Brian M., Brian
T., Gaby & Bill, Amy & Paul (great tape!), Ken Pau ('nother cool tape!), , Rob
L., Scott & Sarahjane, Mark & Char, Mike "Spydah!" B., Brian H., Katie, Dan, Rob
O., Cindy, Rocky, Peter ("Chairs as currency... think about it!") and ESPECIALLY
those at the helm, Ethan & Bryce, who have *the vision*.

Let's do it again!

Greg Harrison

  Perhaps you guys could put together a tape collection of F&F's and use

Hello All,
	Just a bit of knowledge I felt should be passes on. While I was at frie
friends and family(having a blast in my santa hat) I bought some E.
Well the point is it was REALLY SHITTY I know that when you buy from 
people you dont know you take a risk but i thought i would pass this on.
The guy i bought from was named Al he was the older 40ish guy walking 
around selling E and Cid with the derby thing. I pretty sure it 
wasn't just me because alot of my friends told me they were still
waiting for it to kick in 3-4 hours later. He seemed to dissapear later though.

(Hmmmmmmm) Anyhow maybe it was a bad batch, maybe he was conning all of us,
all I know is I 'll never buy from him again.or let anyone i love either.
Lots of Love
		Mike

Thanks to Dan Trocha for posting the information on the Global Solar
Ceremonies.

Two of my friends and I decided last night to get up at 5 am and
go out to the Baylands Nature Preserve in Palo Alto to greet the 
sun as it rose.  We were afraid it would be raining or overcast, 
so we were glad to see some patches of blue sky when we looked
outside at about 5:30.

We brought drums, a flute, other miscellaneous instruments, and
some sage to burn.  We offered prayers of thanksgiving and peace,
then began drumming as the sky slowly grew lighter and the waking 
birds flew around us singing.  Another person came as we were 
drumming and joined us in welcoming spring to the earth.

As we stood drumming and looking across the bay to the green 
mountains, the sun burst through the clouds and filled our eyes
and hearts with its fresh morning light.

We stopped drumming and turned around to see a rainbow forming 
over the foothills.  It seemed to begin at the Stanford radio-
telescope and ended on the shore near the bay.  As we watched,
it slowly grew larger, arching across the sky, turning into a
double and then triple rainbow!

We were filled with its beauty and took it as a sign that our 
prayers were heard.

peace,

greg

If you thought that that was a great party then you clearly have no idea 
what a good party is and therefore hold an opnion that is not worth the 
time of day.  TRISTAN

I've done it, a lot of us have done it before, so no scolding.  But *don't
do it!*  "Just say no" to buying anything at a rave.  You will get 100% pure
SHIT everytime first of all.  Second, the more selling that goes on at
raves, the more undercover cops there will be, the more busts there will be,
the more this stigma of raves being drug parties will grow, the more parties
like F&F will get shut down due to "probable cause".  NOT that this was the
case this time.  But you see what can happen.  It's a good idea to take care
of business before hand.  Be careful... have fun.

I feel really sorry for you Daniel.  You must have gone to some 
un-believeably shit parties in England because there is no reason that 
you would be saying that.  Did you not ever go to MEgatripois of any 
Spiral tribe or D.I.Y. or Tonka parties?  Absoloutly no comparisson.
But then again I am biased because I hated the music on Saturday; it was 
week.

Now that was a great party.  You see this is the kind of vibe I'm talking 
about.  Open air, all ages, no cops or heat, free; the sea, friends.  You 
know what I mean?

	Yikes,
		Didn't really expect that type fo response. I know that buying
at raves is unpredictable at best and I am definetly old enough to weigh the 
risks and make the choice.  My only motivation for posting was to save as
many people as possible from wasting $20.  I have seen this particular guy
around at a lot of events and wanted to know if I was alone in my 
experiance or if others had it happen to them also. I understand what you 
mean about the reputation of raves and their association with drugs; my 
dilema is that like many ravers out there I dont know anyone from whom I 
can get Ex from. Besides even if raves were commenly known to be solely
drug parties this "commen knowledge" in no way constitutes probable cause.
:) On a happier note: Even with bunk Ex F&F had to be my favorite rave
ever (overcrowding considered) the vibe was absolutly incredible etc.etc.
It seems that the previous post discussing ways to avoid busts and so on 
 did have one question to pose to Ethan and other  promoters. On the hyperreal
drugs.Faqs I found an article discussing deaths in england associated with MDMA
usage by the Journal of medicine.(issue # forgotten) It associated these deaths
largly with a constricted overcrowded enviroment and usage of MDMA. Has anything
like this happened in the US? I'm sure you had this on your mind last Sat. Lets 
learn from the experiance. luckily no one was hurt .--sorry started wandering.
<---sorry started wandering.
	Anyhow great rave, and great effort by everyone setting it up.All of us
Most all of u  
of us that were there had a very memorable experiance.

I think, by now, that we're all aware that you didn't really like the
latest F&F. So why the continual messages about it? Are you trying to get a
rise out of someone? This list is not the place for it...

Please, GIVE IT A REST already - we all know you didn't like FnF, you 
don't have to keep repeating it or deride those who did happen to like 
it.  You're starting to sound like a 6 year old, "my parties are SO MUCH 
BETTER than your parties so nyah nyah nyah"... it's starting to sound 
like you really did like it but just can't admit it :) Please, that's not 
what this is supposed to be about.

   I was wondering who else out there got the biggest, phattest contact 
high ever at F&F?  This includes people who were not sober and were taken 
to the next level by the energy.

   After I finished my set, I could barely walk down the stairs to do 
security because my body was so elated from everyones energy.  It was 
also a very pure energy.  All the effort put in to the party was sincere 
and honest and done purely out of love.  This left a trail of beauty, not 
only in tangible things like the music/visuals etc., but on an emotional 
plane as well.  
 
   Even though this party was busted and overcrowded, I think the amount 
of energy that was there tells us we should continue expanding.  I think 
1000 people is the perfect number for a micro-massive party.  I think we 
are going to experience an amazing summer.  I think there will be some 
massive outdoor parties, we should try and fill the bandshell!  I also 
think the need for spaces will be taken care of with wherehouse 
locations outside of SF.

   I've gotta stop rambiln now, it's time for crass... :/

   Peace
   Love,
   Ernie... ..  .

Tristan,

Why are you such a dick?

I've been reading your posts, and really, I believe you fell into the wrong
list.  I don't know what your damage is but trying to alleviate your
unhappiness by trying to tell others that they don't know what happiness is
about or what happiness feels like -- it's really sad. People enjoy what they
enjoy, they don't enjoy what they don't enjoy.  Don't knock it.

It's already an ugly world in a lot of ways, and if someone can enjoy a given
situation without it having to be perfect, then that's a wonderful thing.

Ifeel sorry for YOU, Tristan, because you seem to be the one lacking an
understanding of what life is about -- or even what a rave is about.  

peace out,
jeanette -> moonchild

[ Not exactly rave related ]

 Can anyone recommend a CD with good obvious bass in the 30HZ region?
I need to make a test cassette to go and test car speakers with, and
if I have the CD , I could also bring it with me. 

 Please , no audio test CDs - something musical that I'd enjoy besides
it having a phat bass sound! Doesn't have to be techno/house/hip-hop
either - electronic music or anything else with deep bass and good
music .

 Email your recommendations to me , and I'll post a summary list!

only place that i could think of asking.  my friend just got a modem and 
she wants to hook up to the internet.  what's a relatively cheap way of 
doing this.  preferably monthly charges instead of hourly.  also, 
hopefully a service that connects to www.  pleeze help me out via e-mail 
cuz i'd rather not fill up sfr anymore!  thanx!!

Uh, a little common sense should tell us that posting particulars of people
who may have sold drugs at raves is A BAD IDEA IN A PUBLIC FORUM LIKE
THIS!!!!!

The intention of helping others to avoid your experience is noble, but this
ain't the way to do it. It may well be harmful to the scene...

It might also not be the best idea to broadcast your personal purchase of
drugs in a public forum...

Wow... ur such a friendly fellow, Tristan, u must be really happy :)

Man, u just don't understand Friends and Family.
There was a vibe there that you personally didn't get. That was your
problem .. not the party's. Hundreds of others did get it.

I'm sure you've experienced great parties in the past. And this,
in your opinion, was not even close. Fine..we've all been to parties
that just didn't click.. and we've probably all been to parties where
we didn't like the music.

But your ego is getting in the way of your brain, Tristan.
You still think that you're right and everyone else must be wrong,
because they don't agree with you. Face it man, most people had a great time
there. People that have as much/more party experience as you, as well as 
people who were at their first party. 
 
Now you've added a little constructive criticism (not much) in the 
last 2 days.. but a little modesty would go a long way in getting 
your point across. And judging from your posts.. you probably have
a lot to be modest about.  (to quote a churchill)

And I'm sick of hearing how great it is across the pond. 
I grew up across the pond, and nowhere beats San Francisco, dammit :)


warmest personal regards,

brian

I'm the friend that hadn't  ever heard Doc before and it is indeed true:  
Doc Martin is a angel sent from heaven to guide and protect ravers from 
bad vibes and bad mixes.  He was flawless, working three turntables at 
once with ease.  I think that the awe and worship that we here up in Van 
Land appear to give up to DM stems from the fact that we seldomly get the 
chance to hear him.  San Francisco you are spoiled!

To All,
	Yep it's the Al thats short, My friend told me he usually sells
good stuff but i got screwed so I just thought I'd tell everyone. By the 
way posting drug experiances on a public board is not illegal nor does it
constitute probable cause cause this could all be some fictional tale:)
not likely ;)

Be that as it may, it's still enough for some astute observer, who might
happen to be a cop, to take notice and start looking for something that
_is_ probable cause. There are undercovers at raves - you're now doing
their job for them. I know people who have been busted at parties. I'd
rather not know any more...

C'mon, think a minute here. If you have a problem with a product, complain
to the merchant. And never expect to get top quality stuff from $$$$ hungry
dealers at raves...

I felt it, too.  A seriously jammin' contact high from all those folks who
were without a doubt on e, or something equally delightful.  or maybe just
experiencing a contact high themselves.  anyway, it got amplified over and
over.  it was incredible.

but then, lots of times people think i'm on e when i'm actually not.  there
have been many times when just thinking about the feeling of being on e
brings me back to that state of mind.  most of all i love the feeling of
joy, without the speedyness, that i can have when i'm around xing ravers.

so now you know why i go!

i agree about the contact high phenomenon.  i experienced it as soon as i walked
through the door.  I think that my aticipation of this event, coupled with the
great music right off and being aware of the love and  effort that went into
making this community event, sent me off on a great rush... just dancing in that
first hour of the party was enough to make me feel "altered" in a serious way,
no kidding!  you can refer to it scientifically or spiritually or
metaphorically, but SOMETHING was going on there that felt amazing...

	I would not call the relations with the cops nice. I have a 
friend who is sporting a well smart bruise to illustrate the point, and 
two friends that sat in front of the police station grumbling while we 
got stoned-walled as to what had happened to him. A cop creating a 
situation in which a s/he can claim assault creates reason, in my mind, 
to believe the relations were not so good....
	I will admit I do not take too well to American police; from most 
of my experience, they have been beefed up bullies who live upon the 
pedstal that the title of Peace Officer gives them (with a few 
exceptions. I most say I have met a few who were laid back and did what 
they were supposed to do and no more, didn't try to bully or harrass, 
some have been helpful, but those have been the exception in my 
experience). Granted, I did not receive such an ornament of affection 
when their flashlights shone in my eyes and their sneers lept out from 
their faces as I made my way to the stairs to leave, but that same kind 
of glint, that, just one fuckin dodgey move boy, and I will beat you to a 
pulp look was there (which of course made me giggle, which brought more 
sneers, which brought quickness to my feet)....

	Och, good glimpse of sanity here. I thought Tristan's first post
did catch something of what I had felt when I got to F&F, in that while
people were yelling and hotting and having a gooding time, there was
something kind of missing, that was a slight artificalness to it as the
swarms of walking people would invade the area of those trying to dance. 
Sure there were a lot of "smiling faces" and the such, but there was a
good amount smiling-faces-who-do-not-make-eye-contact as well. And I tend
to look at smiling faces off in their own universe or harboring the fear
of looking at the people with whom they are partying, at least somewhat
superficial. What I noticed later was it was a just a different vibe then
the stomping parties that go off in the far away UK. They are based on a
slightly different vibe even. And going between the two can be difficult, 
especially when everyone around you is going, fuck yeah, it doesn't get 
any better than that... Right.
	Fraser got ridiculed for trying to bring that here and when he
tried to defend it a little, people labled him as a profitteer. Tristan
came out really confrontationally in my opinion, and got a wave of critism
in his face.  That might be all well and fine, but the type of critism
that was uttered was often followed by a "I feel sorry for YOU" speech
which I will admit, I think have nothing to do with feeling sorry for
someone, but instead feeling slightly better about oneself; when there is
no place for such egotism when one is a criticizing another for being
"egotisical".
	I read something in XLR8R, a bit back about SF being a closed 
mind place. There is a set style, and anything different will get the 
piss taken out of it (or soething to that effect) beyond the point where 
it is just fun and games. I think Megatropolis was a demonstration ground 
of that. I seem to remember a lot of Tristan-like comments being flung in 
Fraser's general direction (like the price thing, the venue... even the 
sound and music being shite - far too fast...) If you happened to think 
Megatropalis was a load of shite and flung words at the list expressing 
your disdain, Tristan may be a mirror you should like at for a bit. 
Especially in an openminded community.

The story goes that during some interview or other with Niels Bohr 
(one of the quantum mechanics guys) the reporter happened to notice
a horseshoe hanging over the doorway of the Bohr Barn (turned upright,
so the good luck wouldn't fall out, naturally). When asked if he believed
in such things, Mr. Bohr replied, "No, of course not, but I'm told it
works whether you believe in it or not." 

Is there such a thing as a contact high? "No, of course not, but I'm told it
works whether you believe in it or not."

I missed a critique of my set that was posted here.
I guess that Vangelis track with the woman moaning "I got my voice" might 
have been scary to all you lotion-crazed chill folks. I'm sure you all thought I 
was playing some evil industrial tracks. Truth is It was mostly 70's space 
rock. But yes, the first track I played was "coming up your ass" by 
Whitehouse, and I knew you wouldn't like it.

Dear Sean;

	No you didn't embrass me, I'm sure Ethan grin hasn't diminished, 
neither has mine. Don't worry, I not letting anger and resentment dominate my 
feelings, just a healthy expression of something I thing we're all 
feeling to varing degrees about the alledged anti-event people. I feel I 
had to express it on the net, it was a rotten thing for them to do, but 
its behind us now. I can only look forward to the next, new & improved, and 
better than ever F&F.

come, come, brian, u "humbly" suggest that tristan's acting "like an 
arrogant little kid"?!  stop it!  whether we agree with tristan or not, he 
has made it clear that he is xtremely experienced in these matters and 
knows what he's talking about.  I was having a totally glorious time at 
the Chemica Sutra that night so I can't comment, but this is no childish 
opinion by someone who doesn't know any better, that's been made entirely 
clear.  stop this bitching, ok?
one of the problems we all share together is that society forces us 
out on the edge and then we get forced into blaming each other.  let's 
put most of the blame where it deserves to be - on the repressive kind 
of society we live in, and ;let's not turn against each other.
fraser (someone who's had at least his fair share of "blame").  :-)

I really hope you are right, peter, but it is my definite impression that 
the word is coming down from on high (and I DO mean a hell of a lot 
higher than just the mayor of this little city) to stomp down hard on the 
burgeoning rave scene.  pleasant freindliness will soften the blows but I 
don't honestly think it will stop them.  RC (Rave Culture) is spreading 
so fast that the authorties are realising that ignoring it (phase i) is not 
going to stop it, so now we're into phase 2.
maybe I'm wrong.  tonight I'm sending out a question on alt.rave to get 
some reports on how other cities are faring.  will report back

thanks to dan and now thanks to greg.  my own vision of this summer 
happened at the sunday bandshell event in golden gate park about a month 
ago.  when I saw all those lovely people from age 12 to 80, mixed ravers, 
hippies and punks, I had a vision of this summer as Summer of Love Part 
Two/Rave style.  a message will go out to the planet from SF this summer 
that will have global effects.  could say more but fear being flamed for it.

If there's one consistantly subversive soundsystem around, its got to be
SPAZ. Popped in for a dance last night - and the Equinox, and found an
intimate, free (donations -only) intimate event that gave me that shiver up
the spine feeling of participating in a real "underground" experiment.
Whoever was DJing was kickin out the hardest fastest trance/aboriginal
druming rythmns I've heard in a long while. With  free water and
subversively entertaining literature to boot - puts some of the bigger
operators to shame.

Here are some people who have definitely got the message of what it is that
we are doing - WE ARE RAVING TO DANCE THE SYSTEM UNDER. THERE IS NO OTHER
REASON WE ARE DOING IT, THIS IS OUR WAY OF SAYING I LOVE THE WORLD AND I
DEMAND AN ALTERED STATE.

Folks, its time to get out there an into every concievable venue possible -
a whole bunch of mustard seed small events undetectable, alive fertile,
places, we need to be free. Soon we will have to demand the same rights
that were extended to rock 'n roll in the fifties. BUT right now, we are
under attack. Like those who listened to the rolling stones once upon a
time long ago, WE TOO are fighting for our very survival as a generation of
love. We must awaken to our mission, to our FUNDEMENTAL RIGHTS to Dance
wherever, and whenever the whim takes us.

FOR IF WE CANNOT DO THIS, WE CANNOT BE FREE.  AND I FOR ONE WOULD RATHER
DIE than have my very humanity stripped from me, for if I cannot dance, I
cannot consider myself to be human.  Lets open our eyes to what is
happening  - the emporer wears no clothes, the state is conducting a
concerted campaign to strip our freedoms basic ones like

DANCING ON THE GRASS
DRINKING FRESH WATER
FROLIKING AMONGST THE PLANTS
WORSHIPPING NATURES BOUNTIFUL FERTILITY

If we are willing to defend a basic right, one which is fundemental to
being in tune with nature, then we can have no doubt as to our
rightiousness, and the universe will surely look upon our fight with pride,
and assist us. OPEN OUR HEARTS AND EMPTY DOUBT.

IT IS NOT A CRIME TO BE A VISIONARY, NOT IS IT A CRIME TO LOVE NATURE
WE DANCE TO MUSIC, WE DANCE TO THE BASIC RYTHMNS OF NATURE, TO NINETIES
DRUMMING BEATBOX RITUALS
AND WE DO THIS BECAUSE WE ARE HUMAN

Dear Lee;

	Agreed, I meant to talk about that but forgot. Anything that 
would have paniced people would have definately bin a disaster. But I 
think that could happened at a number of common rave locations, for 
example 1015 Folsum has steep stairs, leaving up and downstairs one level, 
and poor lights.

	I keep hearing all these stories of indivual stupidity at F&F, Ya
know Lee sometimes I wonder about people, I would hate to be the heavy and
have to tell people at parties not to do things like smoke on a mattress,
people need to be more responsible when there out at an event such as F&F,
and not so self centered. Its all together, because one person's 
illresponsible actions can ruin it for us all.

	Although I think when the cops came 750 people kept their cool and
didn't panic or riot. I think thats the most positive statement that we 
can make about our scene, and I do think the authories will see that and 
acknowledge it. I would hope Ethan would make that point at the hearing, 
because I thing its a valuable one.

	Anyway, I do agree with you, the possibilty of a very dangerous 
situation did exsist, and it seems that some people weren't helping make 
it any better. But I can only speak for myself when I say, I would do it 
again in a second. :) Hope you and yours are happy and well, good night 
and have pleasent raver dreams.

B. Darkness

forget it, daniel. I have to agree with Tristan on this one. I've been to
one F&F event (PLEASE DON'T MISUNDERSTAND WHAT I AM ABOUT TO SAY BECAUSE I
AM ONLY TRYING TO BE HONEST) and I thought it was absolutely lovely,
wonderful people-friendly vibe, with a great sense in the atmosphere of a
potential shared idealism ... and it melted my heart because it reminded
me of the rave scene in Britain 3 or 4 years ago.  unless you took 400 SF
ravers with you most people just wouldn't see the point.  the scene there
has moved on massively - remember that the whole thing has got gigantic,
political and socially idealistic over there.  seems to me your time is
now coming and some SERIOUS FUN is coming all our ways as RC goes beyond 
party mode. 

just where in Britain have you been staying? Megatripolis (while I was
there anyway) had 1500 people EVERY WEEK with this kind of vibe PLUS lots
of older Hippy & New Age people too, and a huge ambient room where
everybody lay around on cushions and played with computers, massaged each
other etc etc, PLUS a huge hippy market that made it all look like a
Magickal Palace PLUS a room with serious lectures on everything radical
under the sun PLUS therapy workshops PLUS tons of political/social fliers
and stalls PLUS, oh I could go on. 

I am not knocking anyone, F&F has the best vibe of any rave I've been to 
in the US, and the people involved are clearly going to be very important 
socially and politically over the next year or two, the very heart and 
mind of the scene .. but it's important you guys keep some kind of 
perspective, that's all.

I am/we are NOT dissing you, but what should we do?  keep mum?  surely 
you want information, specially now with so many important issues 
beginning to raise their heads.  love you all,  fraser.

Sorry Mike, didn't mean to come on so strong.  Sorry for the bandwidth on
the list but I wanted to make a public apology not for the content of my
post, but the fact that I could have worded it better and not directed it so
much at you.  I certainly didn't mean to single you out or anything.  Thanks

Hey David-

Beautiful, man. Simply beautiful.

You're right. We must stand up for what we believe. The elite minority 
that control this country feel threatened, and rightly so, for we undermine 
all that they hold dear to.

We as a culture are a powerful force. I feel an energy brewing inside 
that I can no longer supress. 

The elite minority's days are numbered.

Freedom.

Freedom.

Freedom.

Freedom.

Hey you guys,

	got burned or not, outting someone on a public network is 
	_really_ stupid.  Just think, if someone did that to you and
	you were pulled over and even though you don't deal or anything
	and the cop found something on you that could send you to PRISON.

	Come on guys! Think, this is NOT funny and you are doing no one
	here a service!  I personally have been paid a visit by police
	at my home at 4 am because a stupid fuck like you reported that 
	there was drug activity going on in my house (there was another tall
	large black man that lived directly under me who I believe they
	mistook me for) fortunately all of my neighbors and my landlady
	(whose office is near by) could vouch for my integrity, Being accused
	of drug dealing is a SERIOUS MATTER, you can cause a person to
	loose everything they own and not even be found guilty.

	Why don't you get a clue and think before you put your hands on the

it's not only F&F that's experiencing exponential growth.  the whole of RC
in america is.  R&R resistance is finally starting to break down.  again,
think seriously about the Richmond centre.  not to go out on a limb or
anything, but *I* would be very willing to help get that together. fraser

when we kicked off Megatripolis/West last year (only 6 months ago) I said
to Mark Heley, my partner at the time, that, if it worked, we should lok
at the Richmond Ctre as a jumping point.  he looked at me like I was mad
or a megalomaniac.  I went to Funky Techno there a month ago and was
re-convinced.  I think F&F AT THE RICHMOND is a great idea.  and don't
argue that the place is a big impersonal confeence centre - what was the
venue of this last F&F event?  WE make the place what WE want it to be. 
what SF needs IMHO is a big regular gathering point of ALL the tribes,
that's when things start to seriously come together and change. fraser.

kevin is responding to the feedback.  what is wrong with that?  it is 
called communication.  we don't always expect to agree.  god knows *I* 
have been accused often enough of expecting everyone to agree with us

tut tut, moonchild.  stop all this bitching.  moonchildren don't put
people down because they don't agree with them. tristan has not insulted
anyone personally so don't unsult him back on a prsonal level.  disgree
with his statement, sure, but he never questioned anyone's happiness.  his
point has been all along that there is a geographic and historical
situation that he wants to point out.  his closest to a criticism is that
a lot of really good people really loving each other does not necessarily
mean that the rave was well organised, that' s all - argue with that is
all.  :-)

Maybe Fraser has a point here, even though maybe F & F shouldn't be the focal
name, it might be a good jumping off point.  The Richmond Civic center has
been used for large "gathering of the tribes" type events, the most successful
and awsome one being the First benefit for Malachy (Unity).  It was one of the
few times that most of the promoters in the city co-operated :) for one
good cause.  Don't know if the climate is ripe to do it again, it was really
hard top get everyone to co-operate before, could be even harder now.
But still if you want to try your luck it might be a good interface point,
the police are right across the way, and they are use to these types of
events.  The last Area-51 was a really nice party,  It's sorta hard to
generate a steady "Vibe" in such a large space and goddess knows we 
San Franciscians MUST have our Vibe :) 

but hey... maybe with a 50 kilowatt Luv Phaser...

Dear Sfraves;

	With all this talk about them and us, I just have to go out on a 
limb and share a personal experience with you all.

	After Black Dog last Friday night I found myself in a house with a 
bunch of English DJ's and friends. I was the only one with a different 
accent and felt really out of place. At that point this thought darted 
into the front of my mind, if I feel out of place here with these 
beautiful people, god they must feel even more out of place than I do, 
being in a country of non-orgin, so I just sat their and took in the 
feeling. Tring to image how I would feel if I was over in England going 
to raves. I imaged after a while that I would really desire something that 
reminded me of home, and if I had the opportunity would try and change the 
scene, if I were involved to fit my tastes a little better.

	This isn't England, I think thats obvious, we here in SF do 
things are own wonderfully unique way. I'm most recently from Gainesville 
Florida where the scene is strong, but as different as SF is to England ..etc

	One thing that is SF is I feel that we do try and embrace 
diversity in all its forms. Diversity by its nature is different, most 
people are uncomfortable with change and something that's different. Even 
the most seasoned raver I image can fall into a rut of rave man-nag-omy, 
(sorry my dictionary packed).

	The point is, (Lee always likes it when I get here), I think we
all know what are differences are. I would really like sfravers, and the
english ravers on this list to take the time and express how we are all
the same, I think this is much more a worth wide effort, than whats been
going on, just my 2 cens worth. I know how I would feel if I was in a
strange place/country, thanks for your time, and pleasant raver dreams to 
you all. :)

as you may have heard, there was yet another wrongful arrest and 
brutalizing (brutalization?) of a party staffer at a rave this past 
weekend - this time at friends and family.  it comes as no surprise, 
considering the way the cops treated partygoers and organizers at the 938 
harrison street new years ball/Visual Aid benefit earlier this year 
(beating/brutalizing people, levying false charges, confiscating 
equipment and money...)  

these are not isolated incidents, but are simply more attacks in a 
crusade by mayor jordan, along with Southern Station and moneyed 
interests, to quelch soma parties in order to proceed with gentrifying 
the neighborhood, as well as to put an end to, or at least exert more 
control over, our underground and subversive gatherings.  prior to the 
two above examples, there have been raids on DV8 and gay male "underwear 
parties," as well as new enforcement of anti-nudity laws at the folsom 
street and dore alley fairs.  clearly, these are related, and are 
attempts to enforce a hegemonic anti-sex, anti-youth (and anti-fun!) agenda.

the police break up our parties and brutalize us because they can get 
away with it.  in terms of brutality, the only way a citizen can get any 
compensation or justice is thru a civil lawsuit, and even then the money 
comes out of the city's general fund (for hospitals, etc.), NOT out of 
the police budget.  in addition, officers who are found to have committed 
acts of brutality are still promoted!  the Office of Citizen Complaints 
(OCC), is a sham, made up mainly of ex-cops and ex-DA office employees 
who can only make suggestions to the police chief as to dealing with 
abuse of power - brutality is treated as a managerial problem and then 
swept under the rug.  

we need to organize to fight this and make changes.  i am sick of seeing 
my friends attacked, i am sick of fearing for myself and basically being 
treated as a second-class citizen if i am at a party, and i am sick of 
worrying if my party is going to get busted.  i think it is time that we 
as "ravers" and people with progressive/radical visions make links with 
other communitites under attack by the police in this city.  

i am working with a group right now called Action for Police 
Accountability (APA), formed by some of us who were present at the New 
Years Raid, and consisting of a range of individuals active in 
Streetwatch/Empty the Shelters, public housing tenants organizing, the 
IWW (Industrial Workers of the World) and the Gray Panthers.  we are 
small now, but full of energy and ideas.  i encourage anyone interested 
in APA to please email me for more information. 

 in addition, i'm 
interested in connecting with other people to form a loose group/network 
of "ravers" to organize specifically against the south of market (and 
city-wide) anti-rave/anti-sex, etc. crackdown.  if you are interested, 
please please please email me.  ideas of what we can do include (but are 
most definitely not limited to!) spreading info. among a larger group of 
ravers on what to do in dealing with police, getting terrance hallinan 
(supervisor) to actually do something substantial to support us, making 
our RIGHT TO DANCE AND CELEBRATE LIFE an issue politically (and i do not 
just mean electoral politics here), having creative protests/raves, 
participating in the upcoming Food Not Bombs festival/encampment in U.N. 
Plaza during the U.N. celebrating, having fun (always a priority!) and 
whatever else we think of and can implement.  

i know that one of the most subversive things we can do is to continue to 
organize underground parties, but the more we get pushed around the 
greater our need to react publicly as well in an organized, nonviolent 
manner.  

next tuesday, march 28, the Board of Supervisors, with support from APA, 
is holding a hearing on police brutality and what we can do to make 
changes (legislatively) in terms of police dept. procedure and civilian 
oversight.  this will also be a forum for people who have experienced or 
witnessed police brutality to speak out.  i am planning to make a short 
statement about the soma crackdown and recent events.  the hearings are 
at 10:00, and we are holding a rally beforehand at 9:00, and i am 
encouraging everyone who can to attend.  (oh, BTW, they're at 401 Van 
Ness, the War Memorial Bldg.)     in the future, APA will be holding 
town hall mtg speakouts and rallies as well.  

again, i really think that what with all the publicity around the 938 
harrison raid that this is our opportunity to make our right to dance an 
issue.  

in love and @,

Dear monicat

	You know I'll be there, and will fight them with the tools
available to us technology, computers, the internet, and what the cops
fear most the VIDEO camera, I would like to suggest to all door crews in
the city running raves to have a VHS video camera in arms reach of every
main door, a VHS camcorder is such a small investment that makes such a
powerful statement. Or do the citzens watch thing only make a VHS 
camcorder standard equipment, they can't lie when its all other CNN, and 
the other networks. DO it  DO it DO it

I think that when Tristan commented on needing a lawyer at raves, he hit a
valid point.  I know that we as a group can change laws if we voice
ourselves loud enough, but sometimes you need a little something extra to
get your foot in the door of change.  Having a well-known lawyer at a rave,
and maybe a video camera, would allow us to fight the system using the
system to its fullest extent.  You need somebody fluent in the lingo of the
law that can address all problems that might arise.

Also, from the way that raving is portrayed on television nowadays, many
people are brainwashed into thinking that it is a bad element in society.
Ravers might be considered as druggies and idiots in the eyes of the court
if they were to testify without a really good lawyer.  Having that lawyer
at the rave, paid to take notes on any disruption in the flow of the night,
would give us the edge we need by having a player in their game seeing
things from our perspective.

I know money would be the big setback in this idea, so I leave it to
somebody else to figure that out.  Perhaps if instead of charging $5 at the
rave they charged $7-10, the rest going to pay the attorney.  It would work
if someone tried.  With the increase in busts by police, I see less and
less options to deal with them except by playing the game.  Play it for all
it's worth, and get them caught in their own traps.  Rent two lawyers,
three, whatever it takes to get police to step back and say, "wait a
second....this is not as easy as it used to be". Just like what happened
after Rodney King(although this is a lame example).  Police abused their
power until they were placed in check.  We must place them in check here.
We all have rights to.  It's time we began to try and secure them.

Luv ya =)

I would just like to suggest that we not over-react to Fraser Clark
lecturing us about how to do things.  There are always plenty of people
telling us "how they do it in the UK."  I think we know perfectly well
about all that.  We are doing things as they ought to be done in
San Francisco.  We are learning from our mistakes, we are being honest
about them, but we are also being appreciative of each other.

Grant slack, and it shall be granted thou a thousand times over.

it would be EASY to get the right vibe there.  when I attended the Funky
Techno event (DIGITARIA) I "saw" all those boring corridors FILLED with
hipy markets and every social/political stalls (including blanket stalls)
to overflowing and all these thousands of rainbow ravers (what we call
zippis) flowing through them, communing and then back to the dncing. 
EASY. and right. "we" are MUCH bigger than the old Richmond Centre.  I've 
actually been thinking (and talking a bit) bout how there should be, 
during the UN celebrations, a United Raver Nations Gathering (URN) either 
there or, if the strike is on, why not have it at Candlestick - I bet 
they could use the bread!  If we invited teams from other countries it 
could even last all week.
just a thought (but thoughts at the right time have wings)

I totally understand the us vs. them attitude with respect to ravers
and the police/government and our need to demand our right to celebrate 
life in any way that we choose.  Just a few points though:

At F&F, we were breaking the law.  The police were responding to a
burgular alarm.  People often die at crime scenes.  Cops had no way of
knowing what exactly was going on; someone at the scene of a crime
who is slowing them down even slightly could be contributing to a life
threatening situation.

Humans are flawed.  Just as cops can be unjustly brutal and often abuse
their authority, we've seen ravers destroy property and nature, even
steal from each other.  Most cops I've spoken too see us as relatively
harmless - but a major nuisance nonetheless.  Most cops that have busted
parties that I've been at (and that's a lot) have not been brutal at all.
They are usually responding to a complaint.  There is good and bad on both
sides.  And a lot of misunderstanding.  And very different perspectives.

One theory about raving that I've respected is founded on Hakim Bey's
concept of Temporary Autonomous Zones (TAZs); events that spring up in
the cracks of society (like during the night in an abandoned warehouse),
and then disappear without a trace.  A  TAZ can be a selfgoverning and 
does not have to obey society's laws or follow the norms dictated by the
power brokers at large.  The purpose of a TAZ is not to overthrow the
status quo, but to exist in spite of the status quo.  Peacefully.  A TAZ
doesn't battle the environment, it exists in harmony with it.  

Until that burgular alarm got triggered, F&F was in harmony with
the world.  Once the TAZ nature of the party was compromised, it was 
over... Until next time that is - because fortunately there are still 
cracks we can exploit.

If you want raving to be a part of the sociopolitical process, then you
have to start playing along with the existing sociopolitical games.  That 
means following the laws and/or changing the laws.  That means becoming 
visible and attracting even more attention.  That means trying to win
friends and creating more enemies.  That means defining who we are and what
we are trying to do and fighting among ourselves to reach a consensus and
getting people to act as a group which usually means having leaders to
follow and establishing our own authority structure and becoming a lot
like "them".

Our ideals are valid, but I personally feel that the less confrontational
method of spreading our vibe in the cracks of the power fabric will 
ultimately (perhaps not in our lifetime) be more effective, while better 
preserving the ideals we claim to represent.

I'm all for fighting police brutality aboveground and trying to get unjust
laws changed, but I'd prefer that the rave scene not be the main impetus 
for it.

I would like to preface this response by apologizing for the very 
negative tone:

1) If the British scene is so much cooler go the fuck back, and leave all
us American losers to our pitiful little parties.

2) Step off your pedestal.

Dave, Fraser,
I do agree that initially our relations were not good, resulting in a 
ruffed up arrest.  After that things got better.
Just being angry and despising those in authority and seeing them only as 
opponents, I don't think will help.  I do see them as being obstacles and 
opponents at times myself.  There is much more than that here.

This is where the power of the vibe comes in.  The one that nutrualized 
the initial response from the police.  For that vibe, that unconditional 
love goes deep.  It goes to a place that connects us all, brings us 
together, lets us feel its great to be alive, and gives us a sense of 
harmony amongst all the chaos.

That love can be powerful.  Look at the impact it has had on most if not 
all of our lives.  I know I feel fortunate to have been exposed to it as 
we all have to some degree.  Something that creates changes is sometimes 
feared by those that don't understand the beauty behind it.  It is our 
differences and the threat of changes that the authourities fear and try 
to contol.  The love underneath is not.
 
The love that runs through all of us when truley and unconditionally 
shared can help reduce that fear.  For in that experience of love the 
fear of what one has to lose, deminishes as so much is gained.  It is 
that unconditional love and vibe when expressed and shared will help us 
all.  

For some people raving is a great party, for others raving is a great 
party and much more.  Through raving some of us find a vibe which 
connects us to a core within, which is a shared core.  Through this 
shared core a sence of harmony can spread, and we will feel more free to 
dance.

Having been reading all the messages zipping around the net about the bust
of F&F, I thought I'd sneak in my 2=A2 worth ...

At Dreamscape here on the 18th we saw LOTS of cops floating around outside
in their cars, but they seemed to realize that security had things under
control and left us all alone.  I think the secret is to have the
organizers & security guys (or girls) work together with the cops instead
of having everyone give a bad attitude.

I don't know if Canadian cops are more laid back than US cops or what but
if they haven't busted the party by 4:30 they're not gonna bust it at all!
We've been trying to figure out this phenomenon for ages ...

ANYWAYS - I seem to be rambling around here so I better go get back to
work.  I hope to meet some of you at Wicked in Portland if yer going (HEY
TONY!!! COME ANYWAYS!!!!), I'll have my nw-raves badge on ...

peace

Tis all true! Soundgod (little Andrew) is a good friend, who I have not
been with recently, and was looking forward to his company at and after the
party.

I never got in! And when I went to the map point, trying to get the shmuck
selling maps as tix, I returned and everyone is gone, and mah bud jeff in
jail. Me and his boyfriend run back to the station to try to bail him and
let him know he is not alone. 

My sunday morning (about 8hours) was spent in this mission. I missed
soundgod, Todd (infinity), Amy, oh hell, everyone!

But at least Jeff knew we wre working to get him out of the loneliest place
on earth. Thanx to all who tried as well, especially Bryce's advices,
Darknesses' concerns and desire to pay bail, Heather (SC) as well, Cf crew,
and hell, ME!

Whoosh, what a night!
 The Bee, the Frog, and me......

No need to certify yer credentials to back up yer opinions, I'm sure you

I also ran into a like minded fool at the map point at 1:30 am, saying:"you
gotta let me go. I don't care if it's sold out! I'm from portland! I'm big
in seattle! How long have you been doing house music? I've done it for 4

seems it did yer ego no good. Same for you, keiper.

Why identify yerself and yer consumption?

If you have advice on this market, WORD OF MOUTH. You also compromise the
freedom and safety of those you mentioned.

Remeber as well (and this may or may not apply to the cited dealer) if
someone sells to mke mone, THEY MAY DEFEND THEIR MARKET REPUTATION AND
FREEDOM at very severe costs. Don't fuck with them like this, nor should
you point a finger on a forum as open as ours. you may find yorself having

How much longer do we need more neo-imperialist attitude or butt-kissing
from all these "oh, when I was in engalnd"  or "that's what  a real rave
is" damn, and this boy is ragging on sfr while bragging about the
libo-lounge with a bud-light neon in the window or a flacid/exclusive FMR?

Deaks! Time to get an accent!
Tim! You need a crew cut and side burns!
Bryce! You need a colorful heroin addiction story!
Ethan! You must develop an attitude!
Me! I need a dry, wry sense of humor and a desire for women with flat buts,
big chins, pale skin, blue veins and no hips. (oh, here come the flames!)

I really enjoy sf, I'm shure I'll enjoy british raves, I'll bet LA is fun,
and Portland rocks while Seattle must kick ass, Chicago glows and NY
smiles.

                          Seems tristan doesn't.

Lotsa love,
 Miltn and the E-Bee....

ps: "TRISTE" is portuguese for sad, tristan. 
PRICK is english for self-agrandizing, chest-beating, bragging,
over-inflated,
need-to-tell-everyone-why-I'm-great-in-case-they-didn't-get-it, TRISTAN.

If he knows his shit, does it give him a right to be an arrogant little

> stop this bitching, ok?
did you not read tristan's post, fraser? Let's dot the "i"s in bitching.

besides, Brian's not a bitch. He's a ho.

YIKES EVEN MORE<
		The responses i have had over my initial posting are incredible
along with letters of support, flames, and even threats, I have heard from the   
support, flames, threats? , There is a lot of paranoia out there about big
brother permeating our culture and taking us all to jail.  Come on lets grow
up a little. You are right announcing that he/she sells bunk is dangerous
however selling bunk or misrepresenting a drug is just as if not more
dangerous if not more.
I'm glad some of you evil souls care to address me as a stupid "fuck" however
have you ever taken the time to www to the hyperreal board.  I guess the fact
that there is a major section devoted to getting proper information out about
illegal drugs is stupid also? Of course not, I am more than able to fend off
attacks by the police regarding my posts, But the most painfull thing is facing
ravers who feel they are in charge of group chat control and carry on their 
duties at someone else's expense. Your right the next time i see him i will
be more than willing to ask about the bad shit i got but keeping silent 
about the whole thing sure isn't helping in the meantime. im sorry someone
came to your apartment about a bad tip they had however you had legal recourse
did you take it ? if not why? dont blame me for your problems. if you are so
sensitive i suggest you stay off vrave about 3-4 in the mornging sat or sun you
might find some more people exercising their freedom of speech.

Please do send me some more information about Action for Police
Accountability and your hopes for a "raver-action-network" ...
I'm really interested in your thoughts on this issue.
At all the raves I've been to that have been busted,
the police have treated ravers with so much
contempt - hard looks, provoking and threatening comments,
aggressive posturing, etc. etc...

It's such a slam in our faces - they interrupt an evening of
exuberance, sharing, joy, the thrills of music and dance and closeness
with other human beings, with their annihilating intolerance.
I've felt so bruised each time this happens, but I've
always wimped out in regards to taking any type of *action* -
the style/tactics of the police's type of oppression taps quite
easily into my oh-too-accessible feelings of despair, of being
"too small to count" against a "them" that seems to be so dang LARGE.

However - Monica's post on this issue reminded me that one of the
most important things I have learned (and am still learning)
from raving is how to feel *brave* - to root out my fears and expose them,
balancing their pain with thoughts of clarity, letting my heart relax
& fill with love. Then - to try to speak, and act, and *be*
within the space of honesty and calm that this creates....

My first thought upon writing this last sentence is Embarrassment -
I feel corny, and sort of cringingly ashamed, like I'm doing something
wrong, voicing something so obvious. But this is fear! - me policing
myself with my own thoughts.

"Fear" and "police" are so linked, I think - police intolerance
fills me with sadness because it feels all too familiar - an external
manifestation, or mirror of my own internal paranoia, dis-ease,
uncertainty whirling off past measured and rational doubt to some dark
black-hole vaccum, sucking me away - sucking the TRUST in me away...

Scarier when it's cops, maybe, because it's a social sanction of control.

I'm going off, I know, forgive me - it's my first letter to you
guys and I must feel like I have to say *everything*  :)
I do know that these sentiments have been expressed before.
I wanted to voice my approval for Monica's words & ideas,
and to connect -
and to share -

(Thanks)
  Rhea

Right On ! I second that motion. From the first moment I heard of, about,

sure the scene in the UK had its great points and is a load of fun... but 
with Frasier's derogatory attitude towards the "Oh-so-childish" SF Scene.. 
I too can only recommend him to 'go the f*ck back'.

Again... sorry everyone for the negative attitude...

Go Milton!   
But where was the guy in 89, man...AAAHHH!
How many of us feel we missed out of some kinda heyday in the late 80's 
Chicago or U.K.?
(But how many of us were getting down in our homes to house tracks played 
over Malcolm X speeches played on college radio or KPFA, or grooving to 
Dee-Lite, and feeling inspired or just plain giddy for the first time in 
years, way back in 1990, man...)
No seriously though, that's my and my friends story, even though we 
didn't go out and get connected till 91-92.

Im sorry if i'm doing it too, self/exact date placing is tedious but hard 
to avoid i guess, when we feel we weren't there as long as the others.
Hell though, i'm just gald we got there/here at all...they speak of waves 
of djs, fans and dancers "catching on" or shaking their bootie house love 
thing.
Yer scene and vibe has persisted, ripened, it ain't no fad!!  You keep on 
workin it long before and/or after tweakers like Mr. Portland thing have 
polished their ego into dust.
Ok i'm going back to hang out with my bitter old beloved queen  
too sick or self conscious to dance freely friends, but i hope to rejoin 
you again soon, hopefully names and my own name and dates the farthest 
thing from my mind.

Wah!
>I'm glad some of you evil souls care to address me as a stupid "fuck"

boy, you gotta take criticism and advice. No-one is evil here, and you are
way outta line. You say you'll cover yer ass, fine, but don't put OURS on
the line as well. 'Bout much juvenile attitude as yelling 'I got pot'
outside a party. We need not call anymore attention to ourselves, and I
don't need to have you make my presence on sfr be associated with illegal
substances.

If you are comfortable with exposure, fine. Respect our desire to not
attract undue attention. 15 years in a fed pen is enuf reson for someone to
kill you or beat the shit out of you. That'll keep my mouth shut, and it
does.

If someone asks me "is Mr.X's shit good?" I'll say what I know. I won't go
around telling peope who don't want to know.

Everyone knows that dude has weak x. Welcome to the club, einstein. Now
stop feeling cornered, we love you, you just need to stop being defiant and
yelling "DRUGS" at the top of yer lungs. Maybe, if yer quiet, people wo't
be afraid to tell you where the shit is.

Sheesh!

I hate the sound at Richmond--which is something nobody has really  
touched on concerning this most recent F&F.  I thought the sound was 
pretty damn good (particularly if you were near the speakers ;).  Not too 
loud, and the bass was hard and crisp.  The bass at Richmond is like 
wading through a swamp.  With snow shoes on.  At night.  With your eyes 
closed.  Upside down.

Actually, if anything summer 1992 fulfilled that vision, so this would 
have to be Part Three/Four/etc....  Now I get to play old-timer!  :)

Groovy!
I don't care for punk or Rancid, but it's funny how both adverse in some 
ways, but what kindred spirits punk and dance scenes can be.
I used to try and imagine how many of us were punkers once, or how many 
of had never been part of a "scene" till house stuff; how many peopel are 
are eclecticists, into a lot of things, or exclusive, feeling that this 
and that don't mix, unless you're a watered down vegetable, who 
knows...i'm no pop sociologist
  
About "punk goes jungle" for a record anyway, are you putting us on?
Ska, groovy, but will it be considered watered down, fake jungle, by 
jungle purists, whether of the happy house, reggae vibe type jungle 
enthusiasts, or the more "gangsta rap"/ego m.c. aggro type jungle- just 
two crowds who have different notions about what jungle 
means or could be?
(more fuzzy music questions, i'm sorry, can't help it)

A music press recently commented upon the tiredness of a Dee-Lite 
concert in January and their futile attempts to remain contemporary by 
"going jungle" for a song or two.
 (poor things, i wouldn't care, i'll always love them)
But contemporary conshemporary, ya know?
 (help, where are my Rosemary Clooney or Flock of Seagulls records!)
:O
P.S. the beauteous love-godlings My Bloody Valentine are rumored to be under 
the influence of jungle, but someone said that's just what they're 
listening to and won't neccesarily sound like at all maybe.

Ok, enough non-rave stuff for now, but My B.V. i know has gotta pop up 
here with no complaint once in a while, no?   Loveless songs anyway, the 
vibe, the vibe!  and i did hear "To here knows when" fluttering once 
sweetly in a chill room, boy did that make me happy.    Kiss kiss

Subject: Taping the Police with Video Cameras, Damn Lawyers, etc.
Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

The San Francisco Police, especially during SOMA busts, will routinely
seize videotapes and film, and will beat and/or arrest the one doing
the filming.  Although these seizures are almost always illegal, no
one is held accountable. In addition, recordings that may convict the
police are routinely erased or otherwise destroyed, while those that
support the police are kept and used as evidence.

These are the facts of life. So if you record a bust in progress, be
prepared to physically beaten and possibly arrested, have your
equipment confiscated, and to have your film or tape destroyed if it
shows the police in the wrong. We are talking gang violence, and this
gang doesn't have to follow their own rules.

My advice is: Unless you are beaming the video signal to a remote tape
machine, or unless you have small army of damn lawyers to defend you
right there, don't bother taping the police. You'll likely be beaten
and arrested on a fake charge, your tape erased or lost, and even if
the charges are dropped, you may not get your gear back for a while.
At worst, your tape might be used in court against the promoters or
some of the guests. Best thing to do is immediately stop recording,
and deliberately but not hurriedly box the camera and secure any
tapes you have made so far.

The future may hold some hope, though.  At the raid of Terrance's AIDS
benefit, police illegally seized at least one camera and film. This
caused enough protest that the police chief said that officers would
be briefed on the rules regarding seizing recording devices. While I
don't expect this briefing to even happen, much less that it would
make a difference, the incident and protest does at least draw public
attention to the issue.  Further *loud* public protestations (like
perhaps picketing the police office) after further incidents may draw
more news media attention, and actually result in some change.

I dunno, I would take that personally.

He did suggest that only those chemically altered could have found 
happiness there.  I'd call that "questioning".

No, it's really a lot more simple than that.  Tristan didn't have a good 
time, and couldn't stand it when other people posted that they did have a 
good time.  No England vs. San Fran comparisons necessary.  Tristan 
himself posted a glowing review of the last full moon out here.

If that was all he was saying, why does he need you to make it clearer?  
He certainly seemed to be saying more than that, and while nettiquette 
suggests that one views what others write in the best, most forgiving 
light, statements like Tristan's were pretty unambiguously harsh.

Um, Fraser, you may want to peruse exactly what Tristan wrote, for I think
you might change your mind about blindly defending him.  I'll pull just one
passage of wisdom that wasn't (cough, coough) criticism:

I would say that his statement was not only criticism of both Nathan and
the organizers of F&F, it was a tasteless metaphor...

It is obnoxious, insulting material such as the above that leads generally
peaceful people to get upset;  especially considering that was the tip of
the flameburg.

can any ambient and/or guitar drone fans inform me of SF Bay Area djs or 
chillout or ambient or club nights which feature sentimental guitar drone 
as well as electronic tracks in their mixes?
(maybe we could meet there someday, i'll bring cupcakes or something)
(i never made it to "Flow", haven't even made it to the Gardening club 
yet, have only experienced a few chill-rooms, little out of it me)

For example, Spectrum tracks, among Namlook's Air stuff, or stuff with 
the feeling of Underworld's "most 'ospitable", or Orbital's fabulous 
"Belfast", or the kind of atmosphere Dubtribe's chill-room can create.

Geez, I don't check my email in fourteen hours and suddenly there's no 
less than six posts w/my name in the title! Fraser, is this a 
manifestation of pronoia? How does pronoia reconcile with ego-death in 
Zippie philosophy, anyway (seriously)?

BTW, I was at the first SF Megatripolis, and I liked it - lack of 
ventilation, less than perfect sound, weird water policy, and all! I didn't 
agree with all of what was put forth in the lectures (stopping the music 
in the middle was an adjustment, at first I thought it was a bust!). I didn't 
like all of the music. But in addition to the ideas and music I did like, I 
appreciated the effort and the strive to experiment. F&F, though very 
different, embodies those same qualities for me.

I think there's a culture clash going on here (as if that's not the obvious), 
but larger than SF rave vs UK rave. Rave in america is capturing the 
hearts and minds of those who want to be a part of but not be lead. There 
are plenty of protestant envangilists here to pick up the leftovers. 

Bootstrap us in? OK! Fall in line? Never!

Look at our politics - we tend to hate our leaders. Look at our favorite 
college professors - through the museum of ideas, they gently push from 
behind, never lead from the front without looking back. Like a kid with a 
chemistry set, we like to think we're discovering, even if we know plenty 
of people have already been there.

I'm not saying it's good/bad, advanced/behind, it's just there.

My favorite rave? The DJ's the interface, not the brain, he can't help it 
any more than you can stop dancing. The floor's crowded, no start, no end, 
no middle. An amorphous blob absorbing energy as it travels along. Starts 
at the bottom of the spine and builds and whoosh! up through your head! 
Sorry if that's already passe. Hell, I still buy baggy jeans!

We all have positive contributions to make. Fraser, even you! :-> 

love to all!

Glad to hear you agree.  As proprietor of the machine responsible for the 
publication of that information I understand the risks.  However, I think 
it'd be a whole different league if somone wanted to start up a "bunk E 
dealer blacklist" with names and addresses, or Mary Dealer wanted to 
start up a WWW page with an order form for different chemicals (click 
*here* for MDMA, click *here* for LSD...).  I really think posting the 
names (even just the first names, which could be false) to a public 
mailing list is a really bad idea and associating it with hyperreal's 
publishing of real drug information is abhorrant.

Um, apparently you haven't heard this, but the system of justice in this 
here You-Nited Stay-tes isn't quite as clean and perfect as you think.  
People are arrested and property (money, houses, cars) confiscated even 
before charges are brought against you.  Before you even get near a judge 
or jury your life and livelihood can be permanently obliterated.  I'd 
like to hear more about your plans to be "able to fend off attacks by the 
police"...

Man, is there something in the Bay Area's drinking water this week or 
something?  Did that raw sewage released by the floods get into our 
Snapples?  Everyone seems mightily On Edge.  Go listen to an ambient 
compilation or something :)

Subject: How to deal with the Police
Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

Last revised: 3/22/95

I've been to many many parties where the police showed up. Some were
busted, and some were left totally alone. This posting is based on my
first-hand observations both as a guest and as promoter, from talking
with other guests and promoters, and from talking with the police.

This advice is not designed to maximize the expression of one's
constitutional rights. The police can stomp on these at will, and
unless you have a _lot_ of money, you have no chance of successfully
fighting for these rights. Instead, this advice is designed to
maximize the chances of a good interaction with the police, and to
minimize the chances of getting shut down or arrested.

- Assign an ambassador.

  Decide who will talk to the police if they show. Ideally, this
  person should look at least 25, be friendly, cooperative, a fast
  thinker, and should not be intoxicated in any way. Get this person
  as soon as you see any police at all. They should meet the police
  outside and be the first person they talk to.

  Someone else should go inside and immediately check around and let
  people know the police are there, but that things are cool.


- Cooperate fully.

  Always do what the police tell you, and do it as quickly as
  possible.  If it will take a minute or more, tell them you are
  starting on it _right_now_, and that it should take X minutes to get
  done. Show a genuine willingness to carry out their orders. There is
  a certain amount of uncertainty in every situation they deal with;
  if you show them competent, immediate cooperation, their stress
  level will reduce dramatically.

  If they ask to come inside and look around, tell them "Sure, no
  problem at all." If you don't, then they will find some reason to
  shut the party down. Go with them if you can, and reassure guests
  and party workers that it's cool. The more relaxed you and everyone
  else is, the more relaxed the police will be. For all they know,
  they're walking into a riot. Show them a peaceful celebration.


- Be friendly to the police.

  Be absolutely friendly. The police have to deal with aggressive
  drunks, idiots, people who shouldn't drive, angry people, etc. all
  the time. They won't know what they're dealing with when they pull
  up, but if you are friendly and reasonable, they will love it.

  Introduce yourself. Ask them if everything is okay. If they ask
  what's going on, just say it's a big party you and your friends are
  having. If they ask who's responsible, say you are. If you want, you
  might explain that it's a cooperative effort, but still maintain
  responsibility. The police don't want to talk to 20 people. They
  want to talk to one.

  Treat them as guests.  They came by to check up on things, or maybe
  you screwed up and let it get too loud.  You didn't *think* you were
  doing anything wrong, but if they say you are then be genuinely
  regretful.


- Be truthful.

  Tell the truth as much as you possibly can. Nothing pisses off the
  police like a liar, and they can spot lies easily. And to them no
  one is as pathetic as someone who takes the easy bait they often
  hand out. The truth is often a point of view: One person's concert
  is another's punk drug fest. We're having a party, a celebration. If
  they ask if it's a rave, say something like: "It's not a rave; it's
  a house party, raves are much bigger and crazier." Or something like
  that.

  DON'T admit to illegal acts, or admit the blatant knowledge thereof.
  The answer to this is "No."


- Agree.

  Agree with the police as much as you can. Police have monster egos;
  if the average person hates to be wrong, imagine how much the police
  hate it. If they call you on something, fess up, and be regretful.
  If they say it's too loud, say "Damn! I was really hoping we
  wouldn't bother anyone." Or if you're on the wrong public land,
  "Yeah, we figured it might be risky coming here; it's just that this
  small group can't afford the permits." You get the idea.
  

- Negotiate.

  Once the police understand that things are under control, that your
  party is peaceful (if chaotic), don't be afraid to ask for lenience.
  Would it be okay if we turned it down and had someone check outside
  every so often to make sure it doesn't get too loud again? Can we go
  for just another couple of hours? Is there anything we can do so
  that the party can continue? Don't insist, just ask (or plead). It's
  sometimes surprising what they'll grant you.


- NEVER CONFRONT THE POLICE.

  Never ever try to block their way or stop anything they are doing.
  Don't lose your cool, grumble, or even look the slightest bit
  annoyed. You will lose. Give them any attitude at all, and they will
  beat you, arrest you, and charge you with assault on a police
  officer and obstructing a police officer. Then they will then shut
  the party down no matter what, even if it has all the proper
  permits. More people may be roughed up, and they will issue as many
  citations as they can possibly think of.


- SEARCHES

  Always grant police permission to look around the party space. Never
  grant permission for a personal search or a car search. "I'd rather
  you didn't. I really don't like other people touching my property."


- ARRESTS

  If you are arrested or otherwise restrained, don't answer any
  questions except your name. Say "My lawyer told me to never ever
  talk to the police unless I talk with him first." Stick with that no
  matter what. At that point, you can probably only hurt your legal
  stance by talking. It may also improve your chances of being simply
  let go. When in doubt, be silent.

	The original sample comes (I think) from an old Fat Boys
song. The only song _I_ know that uses the sample is Autechre's
"Lowride". Autechre, being British, are presumably not from the Bay

Heh :)  I'm almost positive it was not Autechre--they are more 
bleep-bloop electro sounding.  The cut I have in mind is  more chunky 
breakish.  Hmm, any others?

The sound at RCC can be good... I've heard it. It gets bad when they
try to go too loud and the reverberations make everything muddy. This
gets back to the concept of "enough" volume. A properly phased
4-corner system can sound really good.

It's a sample from a hip hop track, but I imagine you're referring to the
second Bass Bin Twins record.

Of course they have to call the EPA; the police can't just throw a
container of thionyl chloride, sodium borohydride, or many of the
other corrosive, poisonous, and water-reactive reagents into the trunk
of the police cruiser. They have to be put into proper containers and
shipped carefully.

Whether any of these would be poisonous after being "dumped down the
sink" is another issue entirely. Most of them you wouldn't pour down
the sink unreacted because they would explode or start fires or
produce clouds of deadly gas (like chlorine).  What gets washed down
the sink is mostly by-products.  Whether or not these are toxic has
not been stated, though I imagine an adventurous chemist could figure
what they are.

If you're interested in the Material Safety and Data Sheets for a lot
of chemicals, visit <gopher://atlas.chem.utah.edu/11/MSDS>.

The real villian is the FDA and our legislators, who create the
illegal market in the first place. Legal commercial production would
(probably) be less messy and risky.

Umm. So were we :)

If you had been here in '92 then you would realize that the same energy
that was responsible for the summer of love in '67 was here in full effect
in the summer of '92, so far nothing has come close to the vibe that was 
released that summer, but there's always hope.

In short Fraser, you have a lot to live up to if you think you can
single handedly top the summer of 92 ;>

People like living in a democracy rather then under a dictatorship 
because they think they have more personal freedom so they a re willing 
to die for it.  And yet we the people still live like slaves.

wow!  Why hasn't anyone thought of that before??  such a simple and yet 
effective tool.  there's nothing that gets citizen's more pissed off than 
watching police brutality on tv.  that's the only way to get people to 
notice.  the rodney king thing would have become a faint memory if not

Now their, at last, is some good constructive critisim.  If you take his 
suggestions, plus the ones' I made at earlier date Frind's and Family 
could go back to being one of the best parties arounbd like it was when I 
went their when I first go here (1 1/2 years ago).
And this is why I got so angry abiyt last Saturday night: because Frinds 
anf Family used to be the best party in SF but last Saturday was a total 
fuck -up.
This will be my last ever posting reguarding friends and famiily.

Actually, joy is the natural state of the human mind.

Thus, we only need all these "techniques" in order to temporarily pull
back the cloud of conditioning and inhibitions that prevent us from
experincing this all the time.

Being around other joyfull people is the most time-honored way of doing
this.

( sung to a fire and brimstone repent repent dirge)

In a perfect world of divine justice, every american would have a "my
country consumes 75% of the worlds resources" tattooed on their forehead.

You should all be ashamed of yourselves. Its like one week, this list is
tallking about harmony and the next week its dissing any target it can lay
its hands on. YOU ARE ALL AN EXAMPLE of the schizofrenic society you live
in, which is one of those  in where we see " this is my brain as a human,
this is my brain when I channel surf."

I am quite prepared to unsubsribe from this list, and continue my activites
elsewhere if this methamphetamine enduced tirade goes on longer.

Quite frankly I have a hard time just finding an argument why the entire
American Continent should not be wiped off the face of this earth, so lets
just forget this little episode of unbridled xenophobia.

While we go about examining the mote in each others eye, let remind
ourselves that there are none more guilty than ourselves, so lets all drop
this shit and get on with changing the world and RAVING or are we just
another brand of rock n roll?

videotaping the cops is a great idea - unless they grab the camera and 
beat you up (and destroy the film).  yes, this is illegal, but...

i DO, however, have to take issue with sean casey's suggestion that if 
you have a videocamera and you see the cops coming you should hide it 
away as soon as possible.  this should basically be up to the individual, 
as they are taking the risk.

Dear David,
   Just because you're a little mad from the recent flamage must you
insult the ENTIRE list with the tired old UK is better and you are
all on meth bullshit flamebait. It is probably clear to most on SFR that
things will be fine here without your input as self-appointed
visionary/legend in your own mind. It has nothing to do with xenophobia,
only this tactless, self-important attitude which IMO is rubbing the list the
wrong way. Note that you don't hear anyone flaming other (big) UK contibutors
to our scene.
   What in the hell does group flaming all americans have to do with
pronoia?  What makes you think that the members of this list are
stereotypically american? (heavy consumers, TV watchers, etc). Please 
return from the land of the clueless.

peaceout,

Lurker Lane

can everyone *pleeeeze* stop all this arguing?? posts here have gone from 
insults, to insulting people who make insults, to insulting people who 
insult people who make insults!!!  how long can this go on??  really, 
it's time to just drop this whole thing and clear the slate.  the uk 
scene is hella cool, the sf scene is hella cool and that's all there is 
to it. no need to insult people's scenes, and no need to insult people 
who like acertain scene better.  this issue has been dragged waaaaay too 
far!!
SMILE!!!!!!!

Dearest List,
   I regrettably was unable to remain calm while making a few little points.

I am also in favor of throwing some vic's vapor rub under the nose of this
bickering and negativity. I guess I wanted to be the first vigilant
defender of mom, apple pie and the american rave to respond to this assault
on the very fabric of what it means to be an american (teehee!). 

back into the lurker's lair...

Lane

P.S. See ya @ stompy stomp!

surely in this case it's Kevin who's the horse that's getting beaten but
refuses to be dead.  ?:-) 
and I do grant and have already that he hasn't been the coolest and most
"polite" of people.  actually I think the old anglo saxon is causing a lot
of these cultural problems.  are the pagan Brits just too foulmouthed
maybe, given to just a bit more unkempt colorful speech? we're used to it
and don't notice.  
that's probably worth a thread all to itself, might unravel soem of these
kinds of problems, but it's not the thread I'm going to get into now. 
however, just to expand this thread one more inch, I'd like to quote what
an american buddy of mine in europe once told me: "ya know why there's
this bit of an anti-yank thing over here?  it's because our fathers bought
your mothers for a night for a pair of nylon stockings after the war." 
>:-) (smiley raver in hat)

the point I *would* like to develop a litle further is about "cool" becuse
that's really kevin's problem here.  "cool" is probably the most populr
saying in US culture right now.  now the last time the word "cool" was 
the in-thing was in the mid sixties just before "Hippy" burst upon the 
scene.  at parties everybody used to
stand around posed and "cool" and then suddenly one day the door burst
open and the hippy stumbled in, promptly fell flat on hir face while
mumbling some cosmic theory, got up, and babbled about Life and the
Evolution.  the Hippy was *hot*. it was all too real for him to be "cool".
that is what I think is happening to american culture right now.  RC (Rave
Culture) is the leading edge of that.  the cool thing for kevin to do
would be to withdraw.  but he feels too *hot* about this stuff, it's too
important to him to pretend he doesn't care any more. a couple of years
ago I heard a zippy raver protesting to an older New Age type:  "I'm
talking about saving the fucking planet and you're wasting bandwidth
complaining about me swearing!!!?" 
(not true about "bandwidth") 
fraser.

well here's my view (and if you want it in writing that I'm not trying to
enslave or colonise you or limit your freedom or something you got it):-
Megatripolis allows no negative images anywhere.  we've debated this for
years and it's perfectly clear to me.  while I'm perfectly aware that art
should include the light and the dark our conclusion is that we get the
harsh dark up the ass 6 days a week and the aim of a truly healthy club is
to redress that bzlance to the healing light as much as it can in the
limited time that it has. but, of course, you do wot u like, mate! :-) (do
I *really* need to add that every time I say something I stronlgy
believe?)

I'd like to back you on this point, michael.  I am getting so many private
e-mails thanking me for helping a break-out from this very "  group chat
control" that seems to be going on here (and indeed tends to go on in any

yes, that's dollars.  I thought americans invented it:  you sell more and 
the price can come down.  you stay small and elite and the price either 
goes up or, if it doesn't, we'll eventually run into the ground broke.  
I've seen that happen so many times it's not funny.

ok, it's a fair cop.  I guess what I should have emphasised was the 
:"global" aspect.  what herstory will record will be when the world 
noticed it.  hence the subject title: "Global Solar Ceremonies"

well, I really don't want to say this but if competition has to be the
name of the game for the moment ... the Brit Summer of Love Part 2 was in
1988.  but I still say that Herstory will record the year the planet
NOTICED it.  fraser

While there is definately no way to top the size of that summer, I'd say
it shouldn't be to hard to top the "vibe" aspect of it. I myself would
prefer a small intimate "summer of love" full of dedicated people, then
the big one full of people going out because it was the new "cool" thing
to do, that we got in '92. How many of those so called dedicated "ravers"
do you see going out now. While there is no doubt the summer of '92 went
the fuck off energy wise, I beleive the dedication to the way of life was
missing.

yes, cool down david, no need to attack everyone on sfraves.  I know it's 
hard to see why some folks get so touchy but my reading is that more than 
half of the mail I'm getting is thanking us for raising some serious 
issues.  that's more than the president ever got so nobody's getting flamed.
fraser
PS  Not once did david even mention the uk scene. he talked abou much 
bigger issues than whether a cabal of self-appointed spokespersons 
*liked* us or we *liked* sf raving.  but I must say that inviting us to 
leave for our own island couldn't be more xenophobic.

yes, vladimir, let's move on to more positive stuff. others can point you
to internet stuff on the zippies more accurately than I, a mere internet
beginner.  but I could start with a definition of zippy.  a zippy is
someone (ANYONE, whether he's ever heard of me or anything) who, seeing
the imbalance between hir 2 hemnsipheres, HIPPY & Tecnoperson (Raver), is
trying to harmonise hir hemispheres, both in hirself and on hir planet. 
Rainbow Ravers.  it's not something you JOIN and, in my experience, most
thinking ravers, on first hearing about it, realise they already are
zippies. so all it does is help focus what we're all about.  and 
sometimes it helps you see allies where you never suspected them and also 
sometimes helps you see that so-called freinds & allies are, in fact, 
not.  a "capitalist pig" business man who's doing a yoga class is as 
much a zippy as a hippy who's starting hir own little hemp business, see? 

could go on and on, but ask another question, and let's see if we can't 
slowly move this ship into calmer and more focused waters.

I *love* apple pie, I'd probably like yer mom, and it is the greatest 
comfort to me in my "old age" that the american rave is blossoming and 
growing so massively that I can relax about myplanet which I also love. I 
hope we are now near the end of this phase one and would point out that 
at least we've been arguing about IMPORTANT THINGS so nobody should feel 
ashamed and everyone should apologise.
I'll forgive you if you'll forgive me (and the others)  I'll certainly 
let you be in my dreamif I can be in yours.

While you are right that we should not blame each other, blaming the
straw man "society" is also not going to get you anywhere.

What is wrong is simply the attitude of "blame" in the first place.

By my count, it would be Part Five (67,88,92,94 have all been proclaimed

????? What are you talking about?  I don't see where competition comes into it 
at all. I was just stating a fact that anyone who was there at that time knows
that that was OUR second summer of love, (I think herstory will prove this
fact as well).

Unfortunately your just a little too late.

YES.  Ok, that is the one I was referring to.  Do you happen to know 
where the Bass Bin Twins reside currently?  A promoter friend in 
Texas is flying them (or him?) in for an event there soon.

	become aware, and to reach out to other aspects of itself,
	sometimes the urgency of forming and having a gathering has
	caused certain safety aspects to be over looked.  It is the
	purpose of RaveMed to step out and fill the gap that can make
	these gatherings safe, healthy, fun and enlightening.

	RaveMed is designed to train participants to be more
	responsible and aware of the safety and well being of
	themselves, the people around them, and the community at large
	(which ultimately includes the entire planet).  Participants
	receive training in CPR/First Aid, Drug Awareness, Aids/HIV
	awareness, basic ecology, and crisis counceling.  Introductory
	elements of all of these principles are taught over a 1 month
	period on 4 successive Saturdays (8 a.m. to 5 p.m.) with two
	evening classes per week in between the saturdays (Monday,
	Thursday, 7 - 10pm).  On the forth saturday the group goes on
	an "Expedition" to a state park or other remote area to
	practice what they have learned, to perform some service (like
	cleaning up a beach) and to have a graduation ceremony.  It is
	the goal of the program to train a group of individuals that
	can be available, free of charge as a safety team for all night
	dance parties in urban as well as remote venues.  It is hoped
	that the skills learned in the program will not only benefit
	the "Rave" community as a whole but will be taken out into the
	world at large. It is also hoped that through this program a
	bridge can be built between the Rave Community at large and
	other elements of society who have it in their charter to look
	after the safety and well-being of individuals.  Our work and
	effort is based on the premise that there is nothing wrong with
	dancing all night, it is the birthright of every individual
	on this planet, as long as it is done with the safety and
	respect of the participants and the community at large.  To
	this end, we dedicate this program.

	Here is a very preliminary outline of what will be taught:


	Week 1:
		Monday:	Orientation, history, affinity groups
	      Thursday:	What is responsibility, rave related safety, sound/laser
	      Saturday:	CPR/First Aid instruction

	Week 2:
		Monday:	safety drill, CPR practice
	      Thursday:	anatomy of consciousness
	      Saturday:	Drug Awareness training

	Week 3:
		Monday:	Drug emergency drills, legal issues
	      Thursday:	Interacting with authority, Police officer visit
	      Saturday:	Crisis Counceling, Strategic Questioning

	Week 4:
		Monday:	Drills, expedition planning
	      Thursday:	expedition planning
	      Saturday:	Expedition, ecology workshop,clean-up, graduation
		Sunday:	Clean-Up group sharing, ecology workshop






	If you can help out in anyway shape or form PLEASE contact me,

	Geoff at ravemed@nexsys.net. Specifically we need people who
	are certified CPR/First Aid instructors, Drug Awareness instructors
	people with experience in crisis counceling, lawyers, police
	officers willing to talk openly before a group and many others.
	If you can donate anything to the cause please contact me at the
	e-mail address above or at (415)965-2384.

if anyone out there thinks we are all slaves under this democracy, let's
  think back over whut we mite've done the past week....


   were you able to go wherever you wanted? were you able to drive a
     car down any street? (construction zones not included)

   were you able to go to the store and buy any type of food for your
     family so they could get proper nourishment?

   were you able to say what you wanted to whoever you wanted? (this
     list is a prime example of that)

   when you went home, were all the neighbors recording your every move
     so they could relay that to neighborhood fink squads?

   has anyone in your family vanished without a trace after annoying
     the government?

   if you want to change your career, do you have to ask the government
     first?


let's face it; in a lot of third world (and even some first world) 
  countries, these above conditions occur daily!
it's true that sometimes authorities here overstep their bounds, but
  there's usually a public outcry at the very least; in a authoritarian
    state, you don't get no chance to outcry unless you want something
      to get chopped off yer body

by and large, things aren't too bad here in the US; of course, that
  shouldn't encourage apathy like you see in the suburban dream, where
    people think they've already "got it all"......

It was suggested that the cops would seize any video equipment and beat up
the operator thereof.
Would their behavior be the same if the operator had some kind of press
credentials?
Even if they were from something like Wired magazine?

7)a whole house decorated almost exclusively with rave memorabilia 
8)about 20 lbs of flyers(very few duplicates),dating back as far as
1990,from all over the world.

Unless it were a local TV news station I don't think it'd make much of a 
difference.

It may have ended short but it was beautiful.  I took five rolls of 
pictures.  They cost me almost a months pay to develop! :) Just kidding 
maybe if I only worked three hour weeks...I took a bunch of them to 
Ameba.  Ameba is on Haight and is a totally hip store with some cool 
people working there (and hanging out there:) thanks Allen).  So try to 
make it down there and I'm sure Allen will share the pics with everyone.

---------------Original Message---------------
The healing aesthetic, which is often touted by new age/ hippy/ ravers
(which I like to think includes me), I think is complimented by art which 
provokes thought through de-contextualizing components of a 
"harsh-reality".Monsters have arrisen from the bowels of the peace/love 
aesthetic because it was dogmatic rather than tuned-in.

I spoke people from Megatripolis who were visiting San Francisco, they 
seemed like wonderful grounded people, who said they were glad you were 
here. Are you the good vibe Big Brother?

hee hee hee

it was pretty crowded in the ambient room when allen went on and i guess
he just couldn't resist playing something that er, might, um, create a
little more space in there.

unfortunately i didn't get to hear it, because i was recruited by mona to
pass around some incense stickes.

um, does anybody know what that big bucket of brown liquid was?

love,

ann

ps by the way, i requested some harsher tunes than what he played so
you guys escaped the "worst"

Hey David,

Thanks for calling for an end to this inane crosstalk. Seems kinda 
pointless.

If anyone here really cares about what this movement is capable of, they'll 
take your words into consideration.

Let's drop the bullshit, people, and get to the business on how we can 
REALLY affect change within our culture so that we may affect change 
within others.

Fighting among ourselves is an age old tactic authority has 
encouraged for countless generations. Let's not give them any help.

Love and Respect to All,

granted, i have a better life here in the u.s. than i might in a third 
world country (unless of course i were part of the priveleged elite in 
that country).  however, things ARE bad here in the u.s. - look at the # 
of homeless, look at the money spent on "defense" and what's left over 
for social programs...

i don't think we are "slaves in this democracy" - but i do not think this 
is a democracy!  real democracy is participatory, and is inconsistent 
with capitalism - we all do not have equal voices here, and it should be 
obvious who controls our government.  

oh, and regarding a "public outcry" at injustice - usually there's one 
only if people involved have the time, and the resources, and the 
know-how to organize, and even then most of the press may censor it.

in love and @,

i don't think it has to do at all with having a "foul mouth."  this pagan 
american has a particularly harsh tongue at times, and does not mind 
cursing in the least.  HOWEVER, i do mind rudeness and disrespect - one 
can be "foulmouthed" without being unnecessarily insulting.

 kevin (tristan?) doesn't have to withdraw from discussion.  he just 
needs to not be so rude and to learn to communicate better.

okay, what exactly is a negative image?  i don't know the song "coming up 
yer ass" (but if someone wants to play it for me that would be rad!), but 
if it has to do with buttsex, how is that negative?  buttsex is a 
wonderful form of sexual activity ...

so what is a negative image?  we could agree that "violent" images are 
negative, but sometimes there's a grey area: for instance, images of 
consensual sm ... violent to some, ecstatic to others...

myself, i prefer life-affirming "images" at parties.  but sometimes a 
good dark techno set (provided the vibe/atmosphere at the party is not 
dark), which moves into joy and celebration, is what i need!

WELL THEN WHAT SHOULD WE CALL IT?
I hereby declare a competition for the naming of the child we are about to
birth this summer - globally.
LOVE has a good ring to it, but the media need to have an easy entry point.
Lets see, if we can tie this in with the UN 50 anniversary - United Nations
of Love? (calling it UN OF RAVE is too exclusive) any ideas??

I think I'm missing stuff since I haven't gotten flyers for over a week
now; so far Tribal Funk looks like the biggest event of the weekend.
It's supposed to be $15-$20 however.  Brothers and Sisters should have
good music if you can ignore the subset of 1015 patrons who won't be there
for the music.  I may head out to Pure Space tonight and get more flyers
and post an update tomorrow...  Most of the new stuff here is stuff
people have been sending me - thanks!  (you know who you are)

yes! Does anyone happen to know where I can contact people, without 
having to use my computer at work, who are actively taking steps 
towards making recreational drugs legal? (I wanna start *doing* 
something about it instead of just silently dreaming about it!)

Thanks!

Fraser...

You've also got private e-mail (from me) telling u otherwise.
It's well recognized around here, and for what any reasonable person
would consider good reason, that the topic Michael addressed was 
inappropriate on *any* public forum.
I would probably consider you to be a reasonable and intelligent 
person, which tells me that now you are beginning to act like a demagogue.
However, demagoguery won't work on the majority of this crowd, in my opinion.
So far you've tried the authoritarian approach, and now the demagogue
approach. I suggest that you try the "humble and modest" approach.

brian

Anybody who thinks the SF rave scene is not xenophobic is, quite frankly, 
talking out of their arse.  I have been going to raves here for over a 
year and a half and I could probably count the number of African 
Americans I have seen on my finger's (all right, that is a slight 
over-statement).  (And, as everybody is probably sick of hearing this 
(particually if you are American) again) It's not like that in England.  
Here everything is segrergated and the rave scene is no exception.  In 
England white people go reggae and hip-hop clubs with-out thinking 
twice but here I don't even know where decent hip-hop clubs and reggae 
clubs/parties are.  This is because the music at raves here is segragated 
as well where as in England we played raggae, acid jazz, old funk/rock; 
different floors, different kinds of music.  That way different people 
turn for the different music and then have the oppotunity to get into the 
other kinds of music their as well.  There used to be a club in London 
where their was a goth room, a raggae/dub room, a techno room, and a 
retro chill-out room (and many a great raver was born out of that scene; 
let me tell you.....).  This is how you get a mixture at parties because 
the strength of any scene comes from the power of the excellence of it's 
music and different kinds of music attract different kinds of people.  
But nobody here is interested in doing that.  And why should they when 
their are thousands and thousands of white trash kids just lining up with 
their $10
And this go's to heart of America.  In England we have a much more sense 
of us (ie the poor) against them situation whereas here it is poor white 
against poor black, poor white against poor white, rich black verses rich 
white and so on; not good.  All of my friends are very cool but even only 
they have one or two friends who are African American.  In England half 
my friends where African English yet here I have only ever met the 
Africans Americans that my friends know.  Why?  Because when I go out to 
raves all I meet are white kids because they are the only ones who go to 
raves here.  If a club/space was used for the idea I mentioned above I 
feel that, with-in a year that the SF scene would be long way down the 
path to solving the problem.  Don't forget that until the Acid House 
scene of 1986 that we in Britain got over this problem and this was one 
of the ways that we did it; it worked in 1986 and it particually worked 
well in 1991 when the techno scene in England was starting to kick off.  
Because don't forget that acid house/rave music was mostly written by 
whites as well (they were certainly the caterlyst) and the African English 
got into it at a later date.  It is a good idea; it worked before.
David is quite right with what he was saying.  Right on!
Yours Tristan.

         all right, geoff, if you want to continue being comepetitive
(while ,
          denying any knowledge of it) *you* missed the party - by about 4
          years.  actually what's interesting is the other posts which
          criticise the particpants in the early sumers of love because 

          the same thing happened in UK after '88 (viz "where are they
now? 
          quite a lot of them seem stuck in the past and resisiting any
new
          things.  it was the same in london when we started megaT - 
the cool 
          hip early summer of lovers resisted it - they were into 
keeping the 
          scene small and trendy and elite.  I'm into seeing it become 
the 
          biggest mass social/spiritual movement this planet has ever 
seen.  
          just an *opinion* of course, I don't want to make a law 
against , 
          other folks' religions.  (do I *really* have to keep putting 
in such 
          rejoinders?!)  fraser

I think you are probably right, dave.  I noticed in the original Glabal 
Solar Cenemonies posted by Dan that this new age of knowledge was 
preceded by the age of belief and wondered if a lot of these 
very-touchy-seeming comments I've been attracting every time I open my 
mouth is people rebelling against the age of belief.  if that's the case 
may I make it clear (yet again) that I would be totally stupified (not to 
say bored stiff) if people "followed" what I'm saying.  think and then, if 
eventually convinced, act. but I'm certainly not going to stop saying 
what I *know*.   fraser

Is some west african (and I believe also south african) cultures a child
is not named until at least three days after their birth :) (being
from S.A. you probibly knew that), we don't have to wait that long but
I think we can spare a little time, let's see what she looks/scts like first :)

>property (money, houses, cars) confiscated even > before charges

I'd just like to tell ya'll a little story about something that 
happened to a friend and me about a week ago:

It was 3am and my friend was leaving my house. My dog and I were 
walking him out to his car. We were chit-chatting, saying goodnight, 
etc. The police were around the corner and up the street a 1/2 block 
conducting a neighborhood sweep. A cop, in  car, was leaving the 
sweep but saw us from his car. He screeched to a halt, jumped out of 
his car with billy club in hand, and told us not to move. He asked 
what we were doing and we told him. He asked for IDs. Mine was 
upstairs in my apartment and I told him that. He confiscated cash 
from both my friend and me. He took $110 from my friend and the fresh 
$20 I had stuffed into my pocket after going to the ATM a few hours 
earlier. He was able to confiscate this cash because we were standing 
on the street at what is considered by the "norm" to be an odd hour 
to be awake and standing on the street, and because my neighborhood 
is a known "crack" neighborhood.

To my knowledge there is no curfew in Oakland. I have no warrants, 
I've never been arrested for anything, my ID is current (but he 
wouldn't let me get it from upstairs), I live in the building in 
front of which my friend and I were standing, my friend had an 18x24" 
sketch pad under his arm...an unlikely item for a crack dealer to be 
carrying, I think. Yet the Oakland police confiscated our cash and 
now I have to take a copy of my paycheck stub, with a date no more 
than a month old, downtown for verification and then they will mail 
me a reimbursement check...10 working days after I produce my paycheck 
stub!

Who is the criminal in this picture?! And I wonder what the cop might 
have done to us had it *not* been so obvious that we are not crack 
dealers?

Dont you get it? This exactly what we don't want, more buzzwords for the
media. What good would it do us? Can a word or phrase realy describe this
accurately. If you haven't noticed already the media is not there to help
spread your message, they give people what they want to hear &
unfortunatly the mainstream would rather hear about drug-filled parties
than "zippies". Even if the media did paint a good picture of it I beleive
it would do more harm than good. Sure, in my utopian dreams I to see
hundreds of thousands of people with the same vision going off, but if it
is to be more than just another big fad it must grow very slowly.

And this makes it xenophobic?  Hmmm... what's your definition for

There's plenty of them... but generally you don't hear about hip-hop on a 
rave board.  Duh.

What problem?  It's not a necessarily bad thing... And since you haven't 
gone to the Hip-Hop clubs around here, obviously you haven't seen the 
races mix very nicely there.  What are the hip-hop clubs like in England?

Mmmm... not so true... there are plenty of African-American Detroit 
Techno stylists who were around in the beginning like Carl Craig and Juan 
Atkins.

Subject: A Blast from the Past

In view of all the snarling on the list here the last couple of days,
I went back and looked at some of the archives from the spring of 1993
(available on hyperreal).  While there were disagreements and so forth,
what strikes me is how heartfelt the feelings were about the scene then,
people really trying to think clearly and express their thoughts about
the changes occurring at the time and the reasons for us to be involved.

We can't keep saying the same things over and over again, that's not
what I'm after here.  My point is, let's keep our attention on what's
happening now and avoid the personalized attacks and especially the
generalizations ("all X are Y") which overshoot the point one has to
make and elicit equally overbroad counter-reactions from those who
feel (often incorrectly) that they are being attacked.  

It was just about two years ago that Malachy was badly injured in a car
wreck on the way back from a Full Moon massive.  I still think that was
a pivotal moment for the SF house/techno/rave/underground, because it
meant he could no longer shoulder the burden of being the focal point
for underground events, which was becoming overwhelming in any event.
And that led, in many ways, to Friends & Family and many other good
things that have happened in spite of the difficulties we've been through.

Right now, it's just about springtime, even up here in rainy Portland, and
I'm looking at the very faint outlines of a rainbow right outside the
window where I'm typing this.  It's a reminder to me that here we are
on this planet, it's the only one we've got, and we owe it some attention
and each other some respect (if not complete agreement!), or what's the
point?

I'm not surprised to see Tristan extolling the virtues of UK society
in the sense that there is more racial integration there.  At some
levels this is true and some it is not; it is also true that there
is far more overt racism and violence in Britain.  It's not for nothing
that Gary Clail declaims against "bigotry, intolerance and *racial*
intolerance" in "Human Nature."  

Furthermore, to claim that the rave scene in the UK circa 1986 brough
the youth of different races together for the first time is simply
nonsense.  That era played an important and heartening role, in my view,
to restrengthening ties of a historical nature that go back through the
Mod and Two-Tone era of 1979 (when I was last in Britain), Two-Tone being
the record label and an explicit recognition of the multi-racial 
characteristics of the Mod Revival of the time featuring bands like The
Selecter, and the broad support at the time across racial boundaries for
bands like The Clash (remember "Guns of Brixton" and even "White Riot"
and "White Man in Hammersmith Palais") and dub poet Linton Kwesi Johnson.

For more on all this, consult Dick Hebdige's seminal little book, "Cut
'n' Mix," which is not only an excellent backgrounder to the UK music
scene but also does a musical/cultural analysis better than almost
anything non-academic I've read.

And you don't have to stop in the late 1970s to trace these developments.
You can go back further to the era of the original Mods and
Teddies, and even the original Mod anthem, "Skinhead Moonstomp," when
there were no racist skinheads, just kids who preferred to shave off their
hair the way that others of the time were growing it long.  

I'm not going to teach the cultural history of Britain to those who were
born and have lived there, of course; but I am trying to get across my
limited historical knowledge on this issue.  I am very wary of overwrought
claims on behalf of the house/rave/techno/underground, feeling as I do 
that the changes and advances that it has already made and continues to
make are amazing and valid enough in themselves. 

Most of the analysis I've read says that social divisions in the UK are
far more determined by class than race, but that race continues to play
a complicating role as always in these matters.  

While in San Francisco many events attract mostly a white audience, many
others have more of a mixture; that's one of the things that attracted me
to this scene to begin with, and it's still the case to some degree at the
clubs.  Although it is definitively a *club* night with little raver
overtones, I think that the Friday night combined clubs at 1015 Folsom are
heading in a good direction, with the totally cool hip hop Dig club on 
the upstairs floor (we had Charlotte just freakin' totally last Friday,
meanwhile my friend DJ Collage who did the chant on Dub Tribe's "Mother
Earth" is chatting up the lyrics to "Original Nuttah" right in time
with her beat, which just made me crack up), the original disco-city
crowd in the smaller downstairs room, Mark Farina spinning outstanding
trippy jazz and house for Zendada in the basement, and Tracy, Simon,
Jeno and Spun twisting our minds and jackin' our bodies under the aegis
of Mark Ameba and Brothers & Sisters in the main room.  And like I said,
despite the fact it's a *club* crowd, it's mixed by race, gender, age,
presumably sexual orientation and everything else.  Not a perfect mix,
but a mix.  And the same can be found in varying degrees at DV8 and the
Sound Factory too.  

The point is,

You've got to remember, we're all part of the same family.

phred

By the way, Tristan is dead wrong about one thing.  There were definitely
important white producers in the early acid house scene, but here I think
the definitive thing you can say is that house and acid house came out
of Chicago, New York and (branching off into the real, early techno)
Detroit, then London, primarily out of clubs that catered to a large
degree to the black gay disco crowd.  Like any generalization, this is
not entirely true, but it's a realistic way of summing it up.  Let's 
give credit where due, but let's not forget that house music, and all music,
belongs to no single person or group, it belongs to us all, and it's up
to us to listen, learn, enjoy, teach and create it as fits our own
circumstances.  I hope we can put *this* particular issue to rest.

 My definition of freedom extends beyond whether I am able to drive a car
to the store to by food. Having food and a car does not mean you are a free
person.  Here are just a few things that I can't do as citizen of the US:

1. I can't choose what I would like to ingest in my body to alter my
consciousness.  In fact, if I am suspected of using or selling these
illegal chemicals and plants the government can tap my phone, search my
house, etc. If I am found guilty of having illegal plants or chemicals then
the government can put me in a jail cell as well as seize my house, car,
computer or anything else they would like. Millions of dollars are spent
trying to catch people who use these chemicals or plants.  Nearly 10
million people have been put in jail since the 60's for marijuanna alone.
Most of these were for possesion of under an ounce.  That is not freedom.

2. I can't feed the homeless.  More than 700 people were arrested last year
in SF for feeding the hungry and the homeless. If you want to know more
about this than I suggest looking into Food Not Bombs.  They are arrested
almost every day for feeding people who need food.  It is a sick and
depraved to throw people in jail for this offense.  This is not freedom.

3.I can't get married to someone who is the same sex as I am.  The
advantages of having the government sanction your marriage are many. People
get tax breaks and other benifits if they are married.  This is the
governments way of trying to control the lifestyle that people choose to
live. It is not the act of a government that wants people to be free to
make their own decsisions.

4.I cant join the armed forces(although I wouldn't want to) and announce my
sexual preference if it happens to be the wrong one.

5.There are also 7 words which I cannot say on radio or TV without the FCC
fining the broadcaster hundreds of thousands of dollars.  Offensive or not
people should be able to broadcast whatever they like on public airwaves
even if that includes "offensive" material.

These are just a few of the things that we cannot do that are prohibited by
law.

I think what you mean is a toltalitarion government not authoritarian. We
do definetly have a authoritarian government, but not a totalitarian one.
But their are cases where the distinciton is little. Take for instance,,
Judy Bari of Earth First! She was driving through the streets of Oakland

passenger.  The FBI then proceeded to launch a massive investigaition of
her and Earth First(a total of 700 pages were compiled). Sounds a little
suspicious doesn't it?
        As far as conditions in third world countries. Many of the people
in these countries suffer at the hands of their government.  We should be
aware that many of these repressive government get economic as well as
military aid from the United States. And in many instances the US has
stepped in when the people in these contries tried to take control of their
government. If you need examples you should read about US foreign policy
from a source other than a newspaper or a television.

If you think things aren't bad here perhaps you should look into the eyes
of the next person you see hungry on the streets, or perhaps you should
take a tour of a prison, or a stroll through some poor neighberhoods.
Please do. It is very importent that people come to an understanding of the
world we live in. I also recomend a movie about thought control in a
democratic society. It is called Manufacturing Consent, I highly recomend
it. It might even change your life.

What I find absolutely amazing about the post below is that it is a really
good example of the conventional wisdom in america that goes "racism here -
duh, what problem, we got black artists, we got hip hop whats the problem"

If we want to have an intelligent discussion about xenophobia and racism in
america, then lets start by putting some of the puzzle together.

Can anyone answer the following question - why are there american-indian
reservations? From my experience, I can see absolutely no difference with
aparthied which was a system of "seperate but equal" development, and the
situation here.

In fact, I recently posted an in depth analysis of the SYSTEM as I see It
on the Well, which I really think you should all read because it seems that
SFRAVERS have a naive if anything understanding of the true implications of
Segregation. So I will post this for everyones benefit, so that at least we
can begin to aware ourselves of what it is that we are doing - Now please,
bare with me if i seem overly eager to get my views across - my only
defense in this instance is this - THE PLANET MADE ME DO IT.

In the interests of a better understanding of what it is that we are
fighting, herewith PART ONE of UNDERTHROWING THE STATE OF UNJUSTICE -
Apartheid Geography - its Global.

The basic premise of Apartheid, or apartness, was a policy of seperate
development. Hendrik Verwoerd the man who coined the term (and who went
fishing with my grandfather) believed in a meritocracy. "The merit which
counts is not only the merit of the individual ... the merits of races and
groups must also count.." he maintained. And so a masterful plan was
developed whereby people were classified by race, and would live "seperate
but equal" lives. Each race group would have its own homeland, and an
entire country was segregated and partitioned along racial lines.

This new system of Grand Apartheid  in which indigenous nations would
receive limited self-government on reservations or homeland areas was then
replicated and patterned in the South Africa's urban centers necessitating
intricate city planning in the modernist vein. Entirely  new suburbs were
created and mixed areas destroyed, as Lewis Mumford had already invisioned.
These perfect garden suburben utopias were seperated by natural and
artificial obstacles. Barriers such as highways, industrial areas and
natural boundaries such as mountains were also factored into the equation.

Surrounding the urban city center, which had now been converted into a
giant-size modernist hell (with mammoth layout and elevated highways) were
the suburbs postioned in concentric circles, accessible by only one or two
exits off anonymous highways. White areas had the choicest zones, with
suburbs or townships for coloureds (people of mixed race) further out, and
black townships at least an hours drive from the centre being the most
isolated.

 For an example of this Apartheid townplanning one has only to tour the
city of Los Angeles. There one finds suburbs clearly seperated along class
and race lines, with the richer and whiter areas such as Beverley Hills
occupying the high ground and lower class, black areas such as South
Central isolated from these higher areas by the major arterial freeways
like Earthquake prone Santa Monica freeway.

The idea is an intriguingly basic one - By creating seemingly natural
barriers to personal contact, like sheer physical distance, you effectively
prevent the possiblity of intraclass contact. So a yuppie is unlikely to
bump into a South Centralite  going about his business in Santa Monica or
Beverley Hills. The result is a seemingly natural sheen of orderly
existance. As Hobbes has noted, everyone feels as if they have a place in
the socius or body of society. The king or president appears to draw his
natural authority from his position as palace dweller. The Whitehouse,
conveying semantic authority coded via its very archetecture and physical
location.

Power in turn flows through the internal geography of the legislature, its
tiered seating, its positioning of the speaker and parties as in a Royal
Court, diluting outwards into increasingly less important levels. Senate to
House of Representatives to State Legislatures and feudal lords to the
instruments of coercion such as police, military, psychiatrists to card
carrying voting citizens, to prodigal citizens to illegal aliens and
finally to citizens of neighbouring countries and peripheral zones.

The illusion of orderliness is completed by the maintenance of permanently
disenfranchised outsiders. These Economic and Geographic serfs of the Third
World can never enter the inner sanctum of authority, the security
council/whitehouse. More importantly, they are not even aware of their
position, for the illusion at this most basic level is complete.

 Military Strategy dictates that in order to rule a people, one must first
divide and then conquor., the basic ballgame invented by the Caesers of the
Roman Empire is seen in the establishment of feudal warlords or fascists
these tithe collectors (from those who carry the fasces or ritual sticks of
power) carry out the will of the president/king/emporer/security council,
insulating the emporer from rebellion. Any attempt at uprising is doomed to
failure, as the riots in Los Angeles and Central American conflicts so
clearly demonstrate.

NEXT: Why the underthrowing of the system in South Africa, being but a
branch of the global tree, gives us a key to underthrowing the entire
bushel.

CHEMICA SUTRA REPORT 

Last Saturday, near the end (about 4 am) of the Megatripolis Parallel
University's first event of the Spring, the CHEMICA SUTRA Technoerotic
Expedition (a book rave launch of the new Better Sex Through Chemistry - A
Guide to the New Prosexual Drugs by John Morgenthaler and Dan Joy) we
asked DJ Cathy of KSFS Radio to go around the guests, discreetly
recording their impressions of the evening. 

The transcripts of these interviews are starting to come in and we found
them so inspiring and illuminating that we thought it might be a good idea
to publish some of them here.  Especially so as our announcement of the
first Chemica Sutra Expedition on sfraves 3 weeks ago, and of our hope to
bridge some age gaps between RC (Rave Culture) and the surrounding, older 
generation, drew some criticism and some doubts. 

Let's start, then, with a father and son who attended *together*.  It was
the father's second attendance at a rave, the son's first. 
________________________________________________________________________
RICHIE:
"it was a beautiful celebration of a lot of different things coming
together.  firstly for me it the gapping of the generations, the merging
of different levels. 

what the whole gathering was about is that we all live in different
dimensions, we can be very articulate about explaining the qualities and
the effects of certain drugs but we can also *express* them.  and we can
be liberated in the fact that other people can express what *we* cannot. 
there are those who are perfected in certain areas and we realise that our
different individual styles and spirits are all expressions of one dynamic
united field of vision. 

this parallel university was kind of focused on the erotic .. sex is
limitless, and pleasure indefinitely prolonged is what part of us wants. 
but sex can be fragmentary, casual, it can have no meaning, the meaning
here was the spirit of the people, the community. 

the party brought all that out by people being very contented with their
own different realms of expression, expertise.  some talked about their
pharmacological knowledge, others danced, there were exotic dancers, belly
dancers, there were erotic slides to inspire the mind.  the dancefloor for
me was the metaphor for dissolving ignorance, for moving through different
chambers and finally flinging yourself into the dance of the spirit. 

it all worked together, certainly for me, like we were pioneers finding
mood chemicals that might enhance, but not being dependent on those,
seeing that dance is the way to get your body in motion, the dancing on
the floor was like the integration of all the different knowledges put
into the form, the ecstatic rhythm of dance. 

so it was a divine mosaic of the wonderous personality of the people
promoting a consciousness of ourselves as limitless, that we can enjoy
ourselves, be comfortable with ourselves, but always guided by a focus. 
when sensation is informed by knowledge it definitely moves into a realm
that everyone can enjoy." 

________________________________________________________________________
The second is with Belinda, from Spain, who said she had attended many 
raves in Spain but never anything like this: 

"this amazing house is just a beautiful place to have a party like this,
because there's a lot of feeling and years in this place.  everyone was so
full of feeling, the atmosphere was so, how you say it, user-friendly? 
the dancefloor was wonderful.  the music was great. it was a really good
party.  just wonderful. and really different."

IMHO the difference is that most people here don't make the distinction
between black & white. I don't notice a lack of any racial group because I
don't label them with the color of their skin. I think there's a problem
with purposely trying to get more people of a certain sex/race to go out,
it seems kinda phony.

If you're getting into the race thing... Basically all of the artists who
started house/techno/acid-house were African-American. I honestly can't
name one white originator from Chicago, Detroit or New York, can you?

but it *is* growing slowly, josh, for me it's been going on since 1988.  
and the zippies did very well with the media last year, so much so we got 
criticised by *our* side for our success in that area.  and, as for the 
media giving people what they want to hear, perhaps you haven't noticed 
yet but people are *ready* for some good happy news after all this system 
collapse and "depression" stuff.  exactly what helped spread the Hippy 
meme in the sixties. don't you *want* to see this positive cooperative meme 
spread as far and as wide as possible?   fraser.

I'll admit to not knowing all that much about the 60's, but it seems to me
that the media played a major role in killing the Hippys. It was no longer
special to be a Hippy because there were all these suburban kids growing
their hair long, smoking pot & saying "peace & love" without knowing what
it *realy* meant. The media has changed SO much since then, it pretty much
dominates all the information the masses get & has gone to the extemes of
exploitation. It realy scares me to think of what would happen to the
scene if it got so big that is was extremely common media/commercialism bate.

I guess this is the Tristan everyone talks about.  It would be nice if he
had his own id.  Just call me nuts for protocol.  Between he and Fraser I
don't know which gets the Ultra CrackerJack Award for Genius. If not that
then they are surely Blue Ribbon Winners...in any case, we know there are
few who can have more to say than I.  So without haste, I analyze the
critic.

>Anybody who thinks the SF rave scene is not xenophobic is, quite frankly,
>talking out of their arse.

Thanks for telling me how to think.  Thanks for criticisizing my thought
before I had a chance to think it.  Man, that gave me much more time to
think about other things....

There is much more to the SF rave scene than can be represented by any one
club, group of people , etc.  It is a MECCA, where even people like you can
make a difference.  For good or for bad.  You seem to criticize without
offering any real solution.  Just plain complaints, and continuing to do so
long after your point was made.  From your first post everyone knew where
you stood.  I think we're smart enough to understand the subtely of your
statements...give people some credit.

The fact is, you have made statements with relatively little history or
understanding of the place you attempt to critique.  You have no sense of
the place, and  are far to busy trying to mold everything to your liking,
instead of trying to find your own vibe or flow.  You basically violate the
ethic by trying to pound things into peoples heads over and over.  And
making little attempt at understanding why you're getting such viceral
reactions.  Relax man, it's only a party...you take yourself way to
seriously, so much so, you not only become irritating, but farcical (is
that like popsicle? ).

Huh? MANY people on this list might consider you a newcomer.  But looking
at the various responses, most if not all, never mentioned how long they
have been in the scene here in SF.  By my standards great restraint ;).
Suffice it to say most people on the list have been around long enough to
know what they like and dislike.  And they, unlike many others, have made
an attempt on their own, and from my view w/o profit in mind, to create
THIER vision of what dance/music culture is all about!  If you don't like
it fine.  You can criticize it, although it would be much more helpful if
you gave suggestions, even helped out.  But it seems some bug crawled up
yer butt, and you have no intention other than to disrupt, and cause
commotion (with a c).  Quite counterproductive, as well as a waste of time.
The 'scene' here is way past that type of counterproductive behaviour.  I
don't find the same level of backbiting as I did a year ago.  People have
generally gathered into their camps & posses and formed thier own tribes.
And generally, things are moving along, slowly right now, but moving.
There are still many diehards and many converts that catch da beat.
There's litlle DJ/Promoter spy vs spy anymore, excpet in limited quarters.
And people are getting along, or at least making an attempt.

As for African Americans at parties, once again, you speak without
understanding the FULL history of the matter.  Most of all, since you
exhibit no sense of SF history; you didn't note an increase in the number
of brothers and sisters going out.  Alot of things had to change about the
scene for this to happen.  And from my view, it's going to get bettah!
People have already begun to act on this problem, along with other
problems.  The tribes will eventually gather if any part of this 'movement'
is real.

>(And, as everybody is probably sick of hearing this
>(particually if you are American) again) It's not like that in England.
>Here everything is segrergated and the rave scene is no exception.

I really despise people who criticize a country without living there for
significant periods of time.  And what do you know of American
sensibilites.  It is due to staments like these that many have said, in one
form or another "Welcome to California, now LEAVE!".  I'll have a big heart
and forgive this statement, since he obviously doesn't know that the music
came from the black gay scene.  History would have precluded him from
making such ignorant banter.  He , because he is so new to SF, has never
been to a Five Foot Tongue, or even the legendary Toon Town.  Therefore he
would not know how many blacks, latinos, whites, etc., gays, strights,
bi's, tv's, aliens, were at many of these events.  And from the START they
were all MIXED affairs.  Things have stratified a bit, you're partially
correct, but it was not always so.  And todays condition is on the mend
(ravewise, country wise I have my doubts at times).

>In
>England white people go reggae and hip-hop clubs with-out thinking

So because you don't know where everything is, it is obviously not
happening.  First I'll call you clueless, but true to form, I will try to
help.  Try Jazzid-Up (or is it Mushroom Jazz), on Folsom on Mondays.  Also
try Pepper, the maybe defunct Butter, better yet Dig!..or you could do the
boat party...'sup to you.

He doesn't consider the POSSIBILITY that maybe it's already been done.
Especially in the LA underground.  There have been crossover parties here
as well, but it's easier, due to the density to have two seperate clubs,
rather than two sharing the space.  SF doesn't have the type of buildings
for such an event, and promoters ego's are still a bit to large to gather
any two houses togehter.  That may take a bit more time.

>And why should they when

>And this go's to heart of America.

A quote from the Movie BladeRunner is in order:"He's the kind of man that
use to call a black man, nigger."

You're quite judgemental, prejudicial, and racist. There is little wonder
why it was so easy to defeat old King George.

>In England

[cut!]

Person, I really hate it when people criticiize something without at least
making an attempt to understand it.  You are a brute, and have little
regard for the feelings of others, much less the hard work that many do.

You don't know what's going on here or in RealitySF, sicne you haven't been
here long enough to catch the beat.  You went to F & F , didn't have a good
time, said your piece...and continued to say your piece.  We heard you
twice the first time.

Next, you and others who have an equally naive sense of SF and the Bay
Area, try to negate it.  And consider it a place where you can teach the
natives a lesson.  Your King gave that shit up over 200 years ago, so why
don't you?

Fact is, F & F  had enough heart to carry out what they FIRST SET OUT TO
DO, create parties that unfied people and considered all as it's brothers
and sisters, all the while making it accessible to people.  And I might
add, at very low cost.  Mistakes were made, certainly, but don't try to
tell people how bad of a time they really had.  How in the hell would you
know? Being so busy being upset about being at a party you don't like.  You
spend much time in wasted emotional cycles.  You didn't have a good time,
yet others did.  That's pretty much it.  They have accepted your opinion,
and respected it.  Why don't *you* respect others opinions.  Thats how it's
done in SF man (ala Sammy Davis Jr.).  Get a clue.

I am sorry if my viceral response upset anyone, that was not my intent.  I
wish people would act more than talk.  Gotta give F & F credit for walkin'
the walk. And takin' hella people for the ride...right on!

Saudi 5,
John

Hello folks -
 Since the level of intellectual activity seems to have increased on
sfraves lately , maybe I can add my question to the stewpot.

 It has occured to me before , while at a rave , to wonder if the few
ravers-who-by-visual-appearence-seem-to-be-of-african-american-heritage-
but-maybe-they-are-just-visiting-so-I-cannot-call-them-african-american-
for-absolutely-sure----oh-screw-!-let's-just-say-black present had ever
tried to ask their non-raver black friends to come to a rave? What
happened? 

 Larry "Asian-American---oh-screw-it-!-just-call-me-GOLDEN" Ching

 ( actually much more subdued in real life - it seems to be a silly 
   evening! )

Listen -the system lied to us, when we got wise to the black/white thing,
they changed the rules - they called us african-american, asian-american,
illegal alien. but one thing they did'nt call us was HUMAN.

Once upon a time I grew up in a country where they called a black man - a
kaffir, then they called him a non-european, then they called him a
"plural" then they called him a "communist" then they called him a "black",
until only last year, they called him south african.

You can  change the words, but you can't change the principle.

So I say yo MR RACIST, yes, you are a racist not because you talk about
black or white, not because you don't label, but because you refer to THEM
not US - you EXCLUDE instead of INCLUDING, you SET YOURSELF APART.

JOSH says "I don't notice a lack of any racial group because I
don't label them with the color of their skin."
                  ^^^^^
but you label THEM  nevertheless as OUTSIDERS.

NOW please do not attempt a defence, because I do this only to illustrate
what should be clear to you and all other ravers, that this system of which
i speak is more complex than we imagine, we each have but a piece of the
puzzle, which is why we need to seriously discuss  HOW we are to CHANGE. I
am totally assured as to all your intentions. We do things only for the
best reasons, but the problem is not with having the right intention, but
instead with lifting the veils from our eyes and Seeing the injustice
around us.

It is totally clear to me that American Apartheid is alive and well and
breeding quitely in the minds of this MTV generation. so it is about time
that we rid ourselves of our patriotic numbness and redefine ourselves as
GLOBAL CITIZENS - with a duty to seek out injustice wherever we find it,
and to STOP the shit in a constructive way.

INjustice is not merely a point of view of another channel as equally valid
as the channel you're currently watching. It is real, and has real
consequences. I recently made a posting dissing americans in general,
hoping that at the very least there might be some voice willing to consider
the opinion that there is something gravely wrong with what is happening
here. All I received back was anger - how dare I generalise, as if the
opinion that this country consumes 75% of the worlds resources were just an
opinion, that might only hold valid for some US citizens.

Well, this POV did'nt work for the germans in ww11 - "what, you have
absolutely no recollection of anything amiss fraulein?And you never
participated in the holocaust?"

the idea of collective guilt is an interesting if unpopular one, which I am
quite prepared to defend. As I am quite prepared to defend my position
regarding my experience in South Africa.
In fact, only once my generation of south africans set things on track down
south, did I feel able to begin participation in other struggles such as
the american one, for I too remained responsible for the success or failure
of the society into which I was born.

SO my SF friends - DO not be alarmed if I continue to badger you all UNTIL
YOU BEGIN TO ACCEPT A BIT OF THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR PUTTING RIGHT THE
WRONGS COMMITTED BY THIS COUNTRY EVEN IF THEY WERE COMMITTED BY A PREVIOUS
GENERATION because our dystanies are all intertwined.

I know David Dei was trying to embellish a point, but it is beyond my
understanding why he would label someone on this list a "racist".

I'm about at the point where I want to ask Brian to close the list down
for a couple of days to give the loudmouths here a chance to rethink
what they are doing.  

The point, as a current favorite track of mine goes, is to move BEYOND
THE EGO.  

As I often do when confounded by the ego-centric spoutings of my fellow
humans, I check in with the wisdom of Robert Nesta Marley:

   Until the color of a man's skin 
   Is of no more consequence
   Than the color of his eyes . . .

I know everyone here subscribes to that future.  Now *think* how you
are going to get there, and think about how you will do so through your
thoughts expressed on this very list.  

If everyone shouts, nobody gets heard.

Gol darn, I'm getting tired of waving this Rod of Correction around!!

Sorry guys but there's no way I'm gonna tolerate being called a racist on
this list.

Yeah sure man I'M A RACIST. I differentiate between living-humans & those
pitifull non-living-non-thinking-humans, I make my own damn vocabulary & I say
their races. I have some patience with them but you're starting to make me
wish this was a segragated list. I can just see how you would respond if
called a racist "I got plenty of black friends, I helped free the brothers
in South Africa". Do you include yourself in the race you call Black? You
say "us" right? I do not include myself in any racial group, I could never
say "us jews", or "us whites", implying that the "them" be a group of
people defined by their race. It may be a flaw of mine that I do consider
some people outsiders, in one way I consider everybody outsiders afterall
their not inside me, but they are always given a chance to become
"insiders" & are not placed in/out-side the group based on pety things such a
race.

You ignorently call me a racist & expect me to just take that as the truth.

(Alot of pretentious bullshit deleted for readers sake)

Yeah, and you said "You Americans" like we were somehow more responsible
for it than you. Look you're living here now & you are supporting the
wastefullness just as much as me, so you should also tatoo you're
forehead with that unaccurate statistic.

Oh Dave baby, you're such a stud. I just get so hot thinking about how
you conquered the evils of South Africa & then so kindly moved on to save
& enlighten our country with your oh-so-large brain, I bet it aint the
only large piece of anatomy in your possesion. Thank you so much, we
couldn't have done it without you. I'll sleep sound tonite knowing the global
citizens for justice are here to protect me & maybe if I'm lucky I'll have
one of those fun dreams with you in it. Maybe we could get together some
time, email me privately if you don't mind associating yourself with a
young, stupid, skinny boy in search of the next Messiah.

Well the jet lag is just sorting itself out, and I'm missin' ya
already.

I'd just like to say a massive thanks to all you guys over there for a
totally top weekend.

Went shopping all day Friday, got me two pitch (tempo) cd deck and a
portable DAT machine and saved myself nearly a thousand pounds ($1500).
Then of see Black Dog, wow what a night, haven't heard "Tour De France"
in a club in long time *awesome*. Bumped into an old friend that I
hadn't seen in two years by total coincident, we looked like a couple
of schools girls, screamimg at each other. His name is Darrell or Mr
Pleasure as I found out, say hi if anyone knows him.

Then of to Alcatraz, yes I had to do the tourist thing, it was supposed
to be a work trip.

And then you guessed it, Saturday night, Friends & Family, wow, wow,
and extra triple helpings of wow. Absolutely banging, what an atmosphere.
I brought a couple of work colleagues along and although some of them
couldn't quite get their head round the music, they all commented on how
friendly the thing was. I must of left before it was busted and boy was
it packed. Thanks to those in the queue that let me back in to get my
coat, derr thick or what.

As for F&F in the UK if anyone wants to drop me a mail we could do a
club swap, I was talking to some friends over here that run a few doo's
here in London and they're right up for a session over there. So how
about it, F&F meets Bumpy Campers.

So long for now, and remember ya got to get out of it, to get inta it
;-)

Cheers

 It's that modern American self-segregation thing. Recrational integration 
happens voluntarily ; I predict this type of voluntary segregation will 
decrease , but not disappear , when the various ethnic sub-cultures in this 
nation have more effect and input into defining regional cultures. 

> Listen -the system lied to us, when we got wise to the black/white thing,
> they changed the rules - they called us african-american, asian-american,
> illegal alien. but one thing they did'nt call us was HUMAN.

 "the system" == the people who came up with and promoted the use of
                 the terms african-american, asian-american ( and don't
                 forget euro-american !) (sounds like something that
                 requires metric tools...) ????

 By now the writer of this paragraph about "the system" has been informed
by other folks via email about the history of "*-american" labelling and
catagorization in the US.   
   
> You can change the words, but you can't change the principle.
 And , apart from "the system" using labelling to hide unfair/toxic 
behaviour against a peoples - there's also the failure of labelling
in and of itself to change the way people feel about a group. It was very
educational for me , 10 years ago , to hear some teenagers use the word
"gay" as a perjorative term for weird behaviour. All the effort expended
by well-meaning gays and straights to replace "homo","faggot", and "queer"
with "gay" didn't change the hate of the gay-bashers , just their 
terminology. The principle was unaffected.

 Let me try a paraphrasing here - "I have called one particular person , 
Josh, a racist , in order to get enough of a rise out of you folks so
that you would be illuminated to the rightness of my positions "

 "HOW *we* are to CHANGE" - at least he's willing to admit he needs some
 changing too ... ( or maybe his "we" is like Josh's use of "them" ?)

 Firstly my point was in no way meant to piss Iain off and I`m sure that 
was understood.
 It was not merely being pedantic, but an important political point. 
Ireland was invaded by Britain, because Britain could not maintain 
control over it as just another colony it was forced to bring it under 
the direct control of the state, thus forming the U.K. with the act of union.
 This act was one of direct political control over another country, and 
therefore is an important point to understand. Or maybe the Irish people 
who have suffered under the boot of British oppression for 200 yrs and 
continually fought against it should just shut up and stop being pedantic?
                           Doug the think before you speak Anarchist.
P.S. FTQ :-)

Oh boy, I guess the time has come. What is this, the first rave Infomercial?

"Gee, I started going to Megafloplis(TM) "raves" and within a month I 
lost 30 pounds, my whites are whiter, and my dog doesn't have any more 
fleas!"

I like an UNBIASED review on any party. I heard from ZERO people about 
Chemica Sutra that are on Sfraves. Did anyone on here go? Would anyone 
want to? How bout some REAL reviews?  

Finally, couldn't you have least had the savy to get a crony to mail these 
testimonials, so they wouldn't sound like so much masturbation via E-mail?

Gee that's nice, attack a statement and then tell the author not to defend 
themselves. Your argument is flawed. His message refers to members of any 
racial group as "them" in reference to judgement. It didn't sound like it 
was a matter of the use of "us" vs. "them" but rather "me(as an individual" 
vs. "them." Your argument denies the possibility of the individual as a
seperate and distinct entity WITHIN a group.

All of these thoughts about raving, what it is, what it isn't.  The 
agreements the disagreements.  Do I know what it is?
Not really.
All I know, and I don't know much, is that when I go to a rave with some 
attitude about how the rave should be and I see things contrary to my 
preconceived rightousness of raving I find that I'm not having that good 
a time.  I might ask myself, am I at a rave?  or is this just some party.

As I start to ask myself these questions I take notice of my confusion, 
as I realize I don't have any definite answer.  As I embrace my confusion 
I start to get a sence and feeling of clarity.

I start to realize, that raving for me starts within myself.  In that 
exploration I start to acknowledge my feelings and accept what I'm 
experiencing.  Through this process of loving my experience, I start to 
experience harmony amongst my feelings, whether they relate or contradict
one another.  As I then look around me, I then feel that everything I see 
is part of raving.  I feel GREAT!  Everything is dancing, and it is 
beautiful to see the different styles of dance.  For even with the 
differences, there are similarities.

Wow, some journey, sorry if I went off on a tangent.  I still don't know 
exactly what raving is, when I look inside myself everything I find, 
whatever that is seems to be a part of it.

I want to thank everyone for their contributions about what raving is for 
them.  Some I feel good about.  Some I feel some resistance, which then 
reminds me that raving is also an exploration.  

Finding peace and harmony amongst my acceptance and what I resist.  I'm 
not exactly sure how to do all that, but its seems that raving helps.  
For me raving is more than a dance party, but a way of life, and much 
more.  So much more that I can't say what it is.  

When I experience that harmony amongst the differences, there is a 
feeling of extacy.  It is so wonderful when I am in that place in myself 
and someone else is at that place in them, there is an incredible feeling 
when our paths meet because we are in the same place.  It is that feeling 
of sharing that brings me extensive JOY.

much as i hate referring to ANYONE by race, here's an observation:

  in LA, the crowds at large raves (plantasia, circa, etc) seem to
    be VERY mixed, lotsa latinos and afro-americanz;

  in SF, it seems to me that the crowd is a lot more hi-tech than in
    LA, and is naturally skewed towards the white/asian groups of
      people . . . .

yesno?

   Nor I -- though I do like the idea that:

                   TO RAVE IS TO AFFIRM

   I mostly attend the Golden Gate Park raves. Usually I bring my 
juggling equipment, because juggling to techno/house/whatever is an 
energizer. I also like being able to contribute something back, since 
everyone else is pitching in their energy by djing, dancing, passing 
around potato chips, or just smiling a lot.
   Going to a good rave is a lot like stepping into a bath of strong
rhythms and good feelings that emerge from a community moving together
in synch.

hey, i never said that life in the us was absolutely perfect and that
  there were posies popping up in the sidewalks everywhere; i wuz just
    trying to draw a contrast between the extremely lucky life that most
     of us have versus the extremely nasty conditions over 1/3 of the
      world's population lives in.
  if you think the homeless and hungry in our streets have it bad off,
    let's look at the squatter cities (CITIES of 100,000+) of people
      living in cardboard boxes around cities like Manilla, Rio, Mexico City,
        Guatamala City, Johannesburg (correct me on this one if i'm wrong)
          Delhi, etc.  
  in these places people don't sit on the corner begging for quarters
    from yuppies; THEY GET SHOT AT if they show their asses anywhere
      near the proper parts of the city. kids are hunted down for sport
       in brazil; they inhale bags full o'
         glue and other inhalants just to kill reality.
  which brings this already-too-long screed to ingestion of substances.
    (bigtime IMHO)  i'm not coming out on either side of the legalization
      issue here, but people really have got to look at chemicals as a
        LUXURY when there are millions dying worldwide of disease and
          starvation.  true, there are homeless dying in newyork of
            TB, but how many cholera cases do you see????

Richie Hawtin, dunno if you want to call him an originator but he has 
done a lot of good for those scenes.  But that doesn't detract from 
Josh's point.

                                Sy is right!

May our scene always drool and play with a rattle!
I love the sandbox!
I wanna play doctor!

My PJs are snug an cumfy!
I need a surrogate momma!
An poppa!

My older brothers an sisters love me
And play with me when I'm down!
And when i have toys, everyone plays with me too!

But I hate bullies, and I came here to escape that.
They found us,but we've gotten bigger
And maybe we'll go to court and get our sandbox back........

Excuse me!  Where in my post did I say that there is no racism problem?  
I looked through it, and no where in there did I say such a thing.  What 
I *did* say, is that there is no inherent racism in the rave scene as far 
as I've seen, and I've been on the scene for at least 3 years.

I strongly feel that there *is* a racism problem in our society, but I 
also feel like we as a country are making progress on this problem.  If 
anything, I'd say that the vibes of happiness and love that stem from 
raves help anti-racism on all sides.

What do you think?

So you think that we should refer to all of us as us?  But I think that 
each culture should be its own "them", and have its own identity!  That's 
why I would refer to any other race as them, because they each in turn 
have their own culture, and cultural identities.  And every culture is 
different.  But this doesn't mean that we can't live together.  Right?  
What do you want the White Culture to do?  Accept all others as the 
same as them, or accept all others as different but equal?  I vote for 
the latter.

Well, I though this might be a tough nut to crack, but was not prepared for
the level of DENIAL.

I suppose we can put this down to that "rugged individualism" taught in
this society. So obviously any attempt to talk about SOCIETY is going to
run into flack by those so heavily brainwashed that they cannot even begin
to imagine what a society without this principle might be like. Again, I
said I would be willing to defend my position that there is such a thing as
collective guilt. As yet NOT ONE INDIVIDUAL on this list has stood up and
even tried to claim some responsiblity for America or tried to move towards
where this all should be heading which is out of the present state of
DENIAL to an ACCEPTANCE that things are definitly WRONG and need CHANGING.
There's a bit of discussion  going on in the democracy slaves thread, but
as usual its mainly an exchange of what ifs, without anyone coming to any
agreement.

Now I know that it would probably be a lot easier if I always referred to
this in an ABSTRACT way instead of using individuals to demonstrate my
point.   So what I'll do is erase references to names while keeping the
examples so as to prevent the loss of face that results in flamage. What
blows me away is that most of the responses seem to be trying to defend the
RIGHT TO BE A RACIST and  THE RIGHT TO SET ONESELF APART.

This idea of INDIVIDUAL FREEDOM - that we should allow all types of
behaviour and thought in the infinite diversity of the universe is perhaps
fundemental to american society. Coupled with this is the idea of
RELATIVITY -
that just as each idea is equally valid, all possiblities have relative meaning.

Example A

>Yeah sure man I'M A RACIST. I differentiate between living-humans & those
>pitifull non-living-non-thinking-humans, I make my own damn vocabulary & I say
>their races. I have some patience with them but you're starting to make me
>wish this was a segragated list.

Here we see the classic american defence of last resort -
< I make my own damn vocabulary & I say
their races. >

 What the writer is defending is his intrinsic ability to GOVERN HIS OWN
SELF - to SAY what he likes and so on.

And here we have an sfraver who actually restates the above:

>His message refers to members of any
>racial group as "them" in reference to judgement. It didn't sound like it
>was a matter of the use of "us" vs. "them" but rather "me(as an individual"
>vs. "them." Your argument denies the possibility of the individual as a
>seperate and distinct entity WITHIN a group.

 And here we have perhaps the quaint motivation for this insider/outsider thing:

>It may be a flaw of mine that I do consider
>some people outsiders, in one way I consider everybody outsiders afterall
>their not inside me, but they are always given a chance to become
>"insiders" & are not placed in/out-side the group based on pety things such a
>race.

Now some rambling in the way of explanation:

SEGREGATION: the seperation of the whole into its constituent parts. The
marking of territory. A line of difference seperating two objects.

In South Africa and the Deep South, segregation was OVERT. The seperation
was mainly along class and race lines, with WHITES ONLY signs deliniating
the areas in which people could or could not travel.

In the 1984/5  overt segregation in south africa ended and the signs were
torn down as they had been in the Deep South in the 60s. But as we all
know, things did not end there.

The end of OVERT American Aparthied in the 60s was merely replaced with a
more tenacious form of COVERT apartheid. Instead of segregating people
along clearly racial lines, the policing of society would occur by
completing  the process and reasoning of segregation. - NOW ALL AMERICANS
were segregated into INDIVIDUAL PARTS. Thus Rugged Individualism became
merely a code word for Seperation.

The Community Uprisings of the 60s had to be prevented at all costs.
Express orders were given by the Nixon Administration which hold to this
day, to prevent at all costs the rise of any figure capable of uniting the
people - black and white. (Hence the Luther-King and Malcolm X
asassinations.) The splintering and disarming of the PEOPLE was helped by
an interesting process of cultural relativism - a black nation was carved
up as the indian nation before it - into its "tribal" parts. The idea of
"black conscousness" in the 60s had been one of inclusion of all those
oppressed by the colonials (although flawed by its exclusion of the
majority of WASPS who had not commited class suicide ie given up there
inheritance) where everyone who was not white was black - thus the idea of
asian-american did not exist. An asian was considered black as was a native
american. We can now begin to see the pattern. Fragmentation, Splintering,
Alienation

Now thats such an underused word nowadays Alienation - the ideas developed
by Albert Camus, Frantz Fanon that were so fashionable in the 60s, the idea
that it was possible for an individual to be CUT_OFF from not only Society
but even his own intrinsic nature.

So what we have here are two parallel histories, but with very different
consequences.

In south africa right now people have embraced a POLITICS OF INCLUSION -
all children have become OUR CHILDREN ,all people have become OUR PEOPLE.
No one including the most rightwing individual has been excluded. Speaking
to the previous generation, I still find it amazing that all of a sudden
their lives have changed - my mother after years of being a boring
housewife chatting to other old hens has suddenly reawakened her talent as
an artist. Everywhere people feel as if ANYTHING and EVERYTHING is
possible. Spontaneous outbreaks of OPTIMISM have become the order of the
Day.

Which is why I believe in RAVE - because what rave teaches -is this - it is
possible to join in the dance, in the community without LOSING your
INDIVIDUALITY.

IN FACT, ones individuality is enhanced, healed, awakened by the COMMUNITY
VIBE. For what we have in Rave is an ANTIDOTE to the splintering, the
fragmentation ,the seperation of global apartheid.

BUT let me rest my case with just one addition - WE NEED TO RAVE WITH
PURPOSE and INTENTION. Otherwise, rave will remain just another segregated
area. We need to take the communitarian spirit generated each week on the
dancefloor OUT into the Streets, into our homes, into our places of work
and worship. That way we begin to assuage the collective guilt, and burden
of our generation, by changing the world, remaking it in a brighter shade
of rave.

This is what we did in South Africa, and just as it worked down there, it
is bound to work over here.

different but equal?
difference - an idea of seperation. (lets all read Derrida)
seperate but equal is exactly the policy of apartheid -
I think it was Mills or Locke who defined the idea of a group or nation as
"a common myth about ones ancestry, and a common hatred for ones neighbours"

I would rather settle for the idea of HUMAN, and call the other stuff flavor.

During the debate in the House of February 7 over the House Republicans'
Bill about the Exclusionary Rule, the House Black Caucus introduced an
amendment to the bill that the Republicans promptly voted down.  The
amendment turned out to be the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution,
verbatim.  The House Republicans were "chagrined."  The vote was 303-121,
meaning that a number of Democrats joined the Republicans.  The Fourth
Amendment reads: "The right of the people to be secure in their persons,
houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures,

supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to

Did I say separate?  Where did I say separate?  I just said different.  
You seem to have a tendency to see things in peoples posts that aren't there.

That's a relatively negative outlook on it.  However, this is more 
plausible to references to 'nations', not to cultures.

flavor = culture.  So you're agreeing with me?  Did I say anything about 
calling people different meaning calling people inhuman?  Where do you 
get these ideas?

Frazer and David are entertaining me with a brand of selective hearing  , a 
panache for insensitivity, and a kind of special sharing that I only found in 
jail from the loudest inmates. Usually they get moved around a lot. But of 
course I find confusion and harshness inspiring.

I am still rushing from the thrill of last weekend's Friends and Family.
This Saturday I had hoped the Jungle party would be outdoors but I've been 
told, indoors $5, 415.995.4699

I was sure last year was going to be the big one for raving in S.F.
In L.A. a lot of people dropped out and were waiting for the next fad,
lots of retired ravers everywhere. We are in it for the long haul now.
At Ameba our favorite thing is to direct visitors to raves and learn about the 
big world of raving out there. Fads in consumer society must always come 
and go .Culture is a big commodity. The British have been selling culture for 
a long time now. Some come here to share and some come to exploit the 
sheep, especially us fury California ones. I respect the Wicked crew because 
they lift speakers and amps (especially that red haired bloke).

Ever since F&F was first beign ripped on, i've been
meaning to post somethign where i dribble on about something
or other.  At first, it was going to be a very vicious
attack on anything that dared attack F&F,
but i wanted to abide by the suggestion that we wait and
sit on vile filled messages
(okay.. its finals week and i didnt have time)

anyhow.. now that i have sat on everything i was thinking
over the past week and totally forgotten anything
that i had thought of that would have been mistakenly 
interpretted as intelligent

ANyhow.. i do think that more than enough bilious messages
have been posted on this subject that i think
that that can and should be left behind us now,
but i guess i shouldnt tell people what they should post
about because well.. thats wrong or somethign
(i suppose i should kill the sarcasm if this is supposed to be positive)

Ummm... basically i want to say that i have (i dont think)
ever been to a Friends and Family party.  Mostly
because i live in socal and poor timing on trips there.
REGARDLESS.  I DO know that the people who put on F&F 
parties do NOT deserve to be stomped on.  Criticized? Yes.
Given tips and pointers on how to make better parties? Yes.
BUT.  These people are doing something for which their
payment is a loss of their own personal time, loss of sleep
added stress in their lives, pontential MAJOR trouble
with law enforcement, getting bitched at for what they do wrong
(or dont do wrong) AND the positive response in
personal feedback that they get from people. 

In _MY_ opinion, ANYONE who does as much work as is put
into these parties deserves Praise before they start getting criticized.
But that's just me.  I really have to especially say with this group,
though, becuase i have seen them at other parties, 
no.. it's beyond seeing.. it's just being there
and seeing them working at getting everything going
and i dunno.. maybe i was just always in a wierd state of mind
or soemthing, but .. like when ethan was tearing down
teh stuff at nag champa and we drove to his house
and was were greeted by this wonderful smiling child's face at teh window
and we tromped through his house at some ungodly
hour to return the sound equipment that he didnt expect
to get any money for lending... well the whole morning
of disassembling nag champa, the attitude of everyone
was much different than most other promoters i know
i dont know if it was really visible, but it was incredibly tangible..

i think, though that we all need to realize that different
people speak in different ways (geee.. i shoudl get a philosophy degree)
some people choose to send email (and ltos of it) to sfraves
to discuss what happened at a party and others will 
just send private mail to the people they want to let know how they feel
and others wont even send any mail because that's just
not what they do or feel like at teh time.
to me, it shoudl be noted that just because it seems like 90%
of the email about F&F is incredibly positive,
it in no way means that 90% of the people there had an incredible time
or that 90% of the people on sfraves had an increedible time,
just that 90% of the people posting did...

It also seems like it needs to be reemphasized that differnt people
look for differnt types of parties (whoa.. he's going for the masters now)
some like small low scale parties, some like large crazy extravagant parties
some like parties with only one kind of music, others like diversity
some want Budweiser Presents... 
others would rather die than have alcohol and/or corporate sponsorship

it seems unaffective to criticize someone for not throwing the
kind of party that one wants to see when the person throwing
the party was looking for something different

i mean, if i were to throw a party with some solid soulful groovey music
and was told that everything was nice, but the music was too housey...
it's like.. um yeah. thanks.

diversity should not jsut be about the ethnic background
or the type of music playing.. but to the types of parties as well...
we should, IMneverHO, try to support each other in 
throwing differnt types of parties, because it promotes health in a scene

but i think the most important thing right now that needs focus
would be in trying to communicate without letting a bunch
of other bullshit get in the way...
BUT it is going to be there, and i think for now
we jsut have to recognize that it will be there,
and that we shoudl try not to react to the bullshit
so much as what is really being communicated.

i mean when someone calls you a fuck, not to be initially offended
until you try to understand why you are being called a fuck..
if its because there is a lot of emotion involved in what the person
is saying adn that is the only means that they have to express it
if its because they call everyone inlcuding their mom a fuck
or if its because they are being lame and just in a pissy mood

AND when you call someone a fuck you should pretty m,uch realize
that you have most likely closed off any form of real communication
and are just entering into a realm of bullshitting that
will probably be centered around defending or attacking the egos
that are involved in the conversation

or that when someone explains the vast amoutn of experience that they have
they should see that it could be taken as just ego stroking in public

BUt respect is still due to other people, and people who have
different experiences should always be listened to

i dunno...it's just kinda sad for me that the one
week i take to actually try to read my Sfraves mail
its filled with what seems like more attacking than usual
but it's not like it hasnt always been here
and isnt jsut a means of our collectively growing up
and learning or not about each other

no, it won't actually.  the media will choose their own name, not too 
likely to please us.  surely we're all media-literate enough by now to 
see this and to take at least minimum precautions.

of more of it was directed at stuff like the following.

This happened on Wednesday or Thursday I think.
So it's still quite possible that this could become law. 
Just thought you'd like to know.

	Leave the country on a plane destined for Europe. I have never 
had a problem with customs going out of the country. The cops have NEVER 
felt like they were out to do me in (even in London where people seemed 
to complain constantly about their attitudes, I have never felt threaten. 
Of course I have never been to a demonstration where they decide to 
charge into a crowd on horseback ;) ). Each time I come back through 
customs here, the weight of the "authorities" descends back upon my 
shoulders. "Let's see what's in the backpack sonny. What are you doing 
with this bottle sonny?! What else you got? You know we got laws..." 
Funny, I seem to be obeying them when I pass through customs. It has been 
said that cops have big egos (Sean I think). They like to make their 
presence felt, but not to make people feel safe, and until they do that 
(and that is supposed to be why we have such great numbers of them, so 
there is less crime and people do not have to be afraid right?) I will 
probably growl even if I do not agree with the attitude I mentioned. 
Maybe we live under a democratic society in which we can say certain 
things and hopefully not be falsely charged, but our authorities have 
managed to firmly implant the notion that our constitutionl rights can be 
waived in the interest of "justice", even if such an act destorys 
someone's life, all the authorities are going to do is say sorry.

of course they do JC, (and a lot lot more) which I assume is why david is

though I don't really want to get very involved inthis thread (considering
it far too huge an issue and raised far too early) nevertheless I'd
suggest a 3rd choice: that the white culture should regard itself as PART
of global culture, which ain't white no matter how you look at it.

Gee maybe it has something to do with the fact that this is SfRaves and 
not alt.politics.

brian, I have reason to believe this is the first of yuor postings I have 
responded to?  >:-)   Unirave is a great name for bringing the rave 
nations together (which I think *should* be attempted during the UN celebs) 
and I had already come up with URN (United Rave Nations) but somebody 
said to me, and I had to agree, that using Rave at all limits the concept 
too much.  I, pesonally, have attacked Rock'nRoll as being socially 
irrelevant today (the sound grandparents and presidents listen to now) 
but, despite misunderstandings to the contrary, I don't want to banish 
them from the *planet* or anything.  "Youth" would also be too limited, 
of course.
still stumped, fraser

Sorry to post a review about a weekly thingy,  but...

Last night at 11:30pm I made the left turn onto Old Oakland Road from the 
Brokaw exit off 880 and then the right into the Selections parking lot to 
find cars all over the place.  What the heck is going on?  This is 
thursday night in San Jose for crying out loud!

Pay the 5 bux and jump into the fracas... Rick Preston was getting whacky 
and the crowd was eating it up.  Bouncing swaying bodies all feeling the 
whackiness in unison riding a small dancefloor under a parachute. What a 
packet of fun.  After this evening, work today was cake.

Anyhow, next thursday is Markie, Solar and Mattski.  Sounds a-ok to me.

Walrus
o.O

"We are now faced with the fact that tomorrow is today. We are confronted 
with the fierce urgency of now. In this unfolding conudrum of life and 
history there is such a thing as being too late. Procrastination is still 
the thief of time. Life often leaves us standing bare, naked and dejected 
with a lost opportunity... We may cry out desperately for time to pause 
in her passage, but time is deaf to every plea and rushes on. Over the 
bleached bones and jumbled residues of numerous civilizations are written 
the pathetic words :'Too late'... We still have a choice today: 
nonviolent coexsistence or violent coannihilation. This may well be 
mankinds last chance to choose between chaos and community."
							- M.L. King
It is not suprising to see this provocative thread move through this list 
at this time. Our times our wrought with peril and we can no longer go on 
ignoring the ills of the past and present which threaten our future.War, 
racism, ecological destruction and social decay are bringing our species 
and the Earth to the brink of catastrophe. In the midst of the decay 
there is also hope for re-forming the world into something more peaceful 
and loving. Whether we like it or not rave culture in many ways is 
embedded within and accelerating this transformation.

These issues are complex and this medium is still very young. We all have 
a long way to go. Education is integral for peaceful and prosperous 
evolution. We must learn from our mistakes and move on with open hearts 
and a willingness to try new things. There are a lot of people in 
the U.S. and all around the world who are deluding themselves when they 
deny the severity of the issues that face us. Most people are in such 
serious denial because they are afraid. Fear inhibits transformation. 
For the learning process to be effective we need a space free from fear.
For me , at times raves have provided a safe space of celebration in 
which I could see beyond the limits of my social conditioning and my own 
fears.

As we try to experiment with the synalogue (many to many discussion) that 
is SFRaves we should try to cultivate styles of communication which can 
tackle difficult issues, express the maximum amount of individuality 
while also maintaining an openness for different opinions in a friendly 
discussion aimed  at the the development of insight and understanding.

Two books on racism that I find interesting are:

_Race Matters_ by Cornel West &

_Yearning: Race,Gender & Cultural Politics_ by bell hooks

both available at decent bookstores in the area

Yours in Transformation,
ronan

EXCUSE ME?  what the fuck do you think my post about organizing against 
police brutality was about?!

i haven't been following the past two days debates because i've been 
busy, but i am extremely upset that you have taken such a patronizing 
attitude towards all of us.  many of us are activists (i've organized for 
fucking years).  many of us are 
working for change in other ways.  no shit "things are definitely wrong."
and i KNOW my history, thank you.

i agree with this, david, but i think we have to remember that this 
communal spirit (i hesitate to use the term communitarian because i 
believe clinton and some other, uh, "liberals" have taken this term to 
mean a return to "community" which includes restrictive drug laws) takes 
WORK.  and this work includes being willing to work WITH people, rather 
than insulting their intelligence and dismissing all the radical work 
that has been done.

David Dei, you sure make a lot of accusations for someone who knows few
if any of us personally.

You say "as yet not one individual on this list has stood up and taken
responsibility for America."  Has it ever occurred to you in your
self-righteous, ego-stoking orations that you might be WRONG?  Some of
what you're saying may have a basis, but you have taken advantage of
a community in some shock and self-evaluation following the bust of
the F&F party last Saturday, *taken advantage*, I say again, of our
emotional vulnerability at this point to press your personal guilt
tripping on us.  

And I won't stand for it, not a moment longer.

Please, I beg of you, cease your emotional hooliganism.  We are interested
in what you have to say, not your attacks on our character and our efforts
to help each other, our house nation, this country, our planet, of which
it is increasingly clear you know vanishingly little.

My friends here will vouch for the fact that I have never flamed anyone
like this on this list in public.  Take this as a measure of my extreme
displeasure and the fact that many others are standing by waiting for
this to settle down so we can return to the great and small issues that
await us.  

Now I've said my piece, so I will stand down.

phred

	This is too gahdamn much! I've stayed out of this till now,
but Frazer and David have gone COMPLETELY over the edge.

	You're going to have to back yourself up on this one,
mister. Denial of what? Denial that we're racist? Denial that America
is fucked up? Denial that I, Forrest Norvell (stepping outside the
veil of my net.personality for the moment), am personally responsible
for the suffering of a poor African child that I've never even seen?
Your words are very slippery and vague; if you're going to take people
to task you could at least say what the hell you're talking about.

	I am going to do something I generally avoid: I am going to
use my ruggedly individualistic perogative to call you a knob,
David. I think most folks on sfraves are quite aware of America's
SOCIETAL problems when it comes to sensitive issues like racism,
xenophobia, sexism, and ageism. I'd even go so far to say that the
list is more sensitive to these issues than most other forums,
anywhere in the world! I also think that most of the people on this
list do not think they bear much blame for America's current sad state
when it comes to these matters. If every person on this list, working
in coordination with each other, were to dedicate the rest of their
lives to solving these problems, they wouldn't be able to do it. The
reason people don't talk about these issues as much as they probably
should is that we've already won all the easy, surface battles.
	Now we have to change how people think, which isn't nearly as
easy. It's easier to get courts to enforce busing than it is to change
the thinking of somebody that's grown up steeped in everyday racism,
as you should know. Things aren't all peaches and cream in South
Africa, after all, now are they? (The battle brewing over schooling is
but one of the many areas where South Africa is still far from
Utopian.)
	And by practicing the kind of divisive proselytizing you're
engaging in, you are not only pissing us off in the short run, you may
be permanently turning some people off to the ideas you're
espousing. Every time some hard-right Christian preacher comes to our
campus and screams "All of you are whores!" at women walking by, he or
she has wrecked Christianity's credibility with all of the thinking
people that listen to her or him.

	Quite simply, you're wrong, or you're reading a different list
than I am. Not only that, it's a little late for you to "erase
references to names." What little credibility you had left with me
disappeared when you flat-out accused Josh of being racist. Making
such a bold accusation towards somebody you don't know is scandalously
arrogant, as well as being the grossest possible breach of
net.etiquette.
	People seem to be trying very hard to defend their rights
_not_ to be racist, in the face of your accusations. And I'm very
hard-pressed to find any fault in taking pride in individuality, as
long as everybody recognizes that most great accomplishments are the
work of groups and not individuals. That is, I may be a heck of a
special person, but if I do anything particularly wonderful, that's
more an expression of the fact that I'm surrounded by wonderful people
than any genius on my part. You can have it both ways here.

	You and my conservative Christian Republican grandfather would
get along wonderfully. He talks like this all the time. Of course, he
thinks that everybody should be conservative, God-fearing, and
Republican like him, so that we can reclaim America's former glory.
	With all due respect, it's very hard to avoid falling into a
relativistic worldview when you're barraged from all sides by people
telling you that everything you think is wrong and/or criminally
stupid. I may be an opinionated fuck and _know_ (on some level or
another) that my moral system is complete, consistent, and
fundamentally right, but what do you and I do when we discover that
both of our convictions are equally strong but our beliefs completely
divergent?
	America is a country that has been sewn together from many
different systems of belief, most of them wildly divergent. While it
would be nice if we had a homogenous culture where all of us believed
in the same values and ideals (and I'm sure that you would rather they
be your values and ideals), our history is such that that is nothing
more than wishful thinking. I live in the same state with armed nuts
who believe that taxes are not only wrong but a sin in the eyes of
God! How am I supposed to recognize their undoubted right to live and
make happy lives for themselves without deciding to live and let
live? Yeah, I think that their beliefs are stupid, but I'm sure they
think mine are just as dumb, and I don't think that either one of us
is going to be very successful in persuading the other to see things
differently.

	Are you being a dumbshit on purpose here? Excuse the harsh
language, but when I read the letter you quote above, what I saw was
exasperation and irony. You are claiming to be a mind-reader and KNOW
what this guy's attitudes are, and he's flipping you the bird!
	And what the fuck is so damn "classic" or "American" about
that defence? He's being sarcastic! You've filed him in a little
folder, and he's saying, in his sarcastic way, "maybe you don't know
me as well as you think you do."

	Again, this is a basic matter of disagreement, but I guess I'm
not surprised at the above poster's temerity in asserting that
individuality is important. It may come as a shock to you, but there
are many ravers (myself included) who regard all of this fascination
with New Age concerns with more than a little bemusement. It is
possible to believe in the four rave cornerstones of Peace, Love,
Unity, and Respect, while still thinking that "Alien Consciousness",
the Tantra, Virtual Reality, community consciousness, and better
living through chemicals are a bargeload of bologna. "Raving" is
inevitably going to mean different things to everybody who hears the
word, because it's new and because it's something that encourages
self-exploration.

	You get 10 negative brownie points for the use of "quaint",
and I still fail to see how you've argued anything coherent with the
use of this quote.

	And the act which makes it possible for us to recognize and
respond to the world. Without the ability to separate "one" from "the
other," the world becomes an undifferentiated mass and therefore
unnavigable. I personally like being able to tell chocolate from
dirt. It makes eating much more pleasant.
	Humans like to be able to break things down into
chunks. That's just one of those psychological facts. Without
classification, there's simply too much stuff to keep track of in the
world. Every time you recognize a tree, you recognize that other stuff
_isn't_ a tree. I'm getting way out here on the philosophical limb
here, so I'll climb back in towards the trunk a little bit. Suffice it
to say that our brains wouldn't be able to work without segregation,
and that segregation is only evil when we start using specious logic
to elevate one class of things over another.

	A simple question: what leads you to believe that things will
progress any differently in South Africa? It's been fewer than ten
years since apartheid officially ended. One black president does not
an integrated republic make.

	I fail to see your point. Are you claiming that this
fragmentation was driven by external agitators? Should Asian-Americans
want to be considered the same as African-Americans, despite their
differing agendas? I know that's a very loaded question, and one that
I have no business answering one way or the other, but I do feel that
it's a valid question. And how does an ordinary guy of mixed European
descent (like me) stop this fragmentation? Preaching at them and
belittling them for their own ignorance?

	Yeah, and as I remember, Camus was arguing that we're all
alienated, and that part of the process of acculturation is
self-alienation (as you give up part of your own individuality to make
it possible for you to be part of the society), and that this is even,
in some sense desirable. Desirable, that is, if you want to be part of
society. Beyond that, I think that Camus and you part company, he
being the curmudgeonly misanthrope that he was.

	...because this is flat-out BULLSHIT! I honestly cannot
believe you are making such a grandiose and patently untrue statement!
Not only are your comments about your own mother sexist and ageist (as
other people have commented), South Africa hasn't even made it as far
as the late-'60s-era USA!
	Your whole argument falls apart here -- I have been following
what has been going on in South Africa, and although great strides
have been made there, there is no way you can make such a blanket
statement. What about the tribal violence? What about the huge battles
over schooling? What about the continuing black-on-black police
brutality?
	None of these things can be easily dismissed. Anybody that
reads the Economist with any regularity knows how much is still going
wrong in SA. It may well be that these problems will all be worked out
in the short- to medium-term. But it's still far too soon to paint a
picture of South Africa as Racially Harmonious Utopia and the United
States as a nation mired in its own hopeless apathy and ignorance.

	No matter what I try to come up with to respond to this, I'm
left speechless. Both you and Frazer seem to possess the worst kind of
boundless and naively self-assured arrogance. You are saying two
completely different things at the same time, and I'm not sure which
one of the two I like less. On the one hand, you're saying that we
should all subsume our individualistic spirits into a greater
community whole (which wouldn't be bad except for how often it leads
to rampant totalitarianism), but on the other, you're seriously
claiming that raving ended apartheid (on one level or another).
	I now understand why this thread refuses to die -- every time
it shows any signs of dissipating somewhat, you and Frazer have to
subject us to another six or seven of your jingoistic and
ill-thought-out screeds. I really hate to get personal in debates, but
you've succeeded in making me very angry. I know that I'm arrogant
sometimes, but the responses from the people involved in Megatripolis
have been dizzyingly egocentric, condescending, and
self-satisfied. The only revolution you're going to start with your
current attitudes is one that seeks to get rid of you.

Following the father and son report posted yesterday, here are some
comments by ravers who attended the first Megatripolis Parallel University
of the year last Saturday, the CHEMICA SUTRA Technoerotic Expedition, a
book launch rave for BETTER SEX THROUGH CHEMISTRY - A GUIDE TO THE NEW
PROSEXUAL DRUGS by John Morgenthaler and Dan Joy. 

DJ PAUL Q:  I thought the whole thing was really good - good people, good
energy, loud, I liked it, it was fun ... the best thing was meeting all
sorts of people, hanging out, talking, smoking - and playing records! the
energy came together in litle groups all over the place, but the little
groups were always changing so everything kept moving .. the dancefloor
was too small but it was very well lit.  I'll let other people describe my
music, I think!  

GRAHAM:  first of all it took place in this place that's just impossible
to describe.  it's full of stuff that looks like the man who owns it
collected over years - exotica, stuffed animals and paintings - 

KATE:  it makes you think of the film Performance with Jagger.  

TOM:  it's got more stuff in it than any museum you ever go in really! 

GRAHAM:  it made the place really relaxed, as soon as I walked in here
tonight I thought MY GOD!  it's a good vibe in here, I think, a really
unsettled vibe because there are so many things from different places. 

KATE:  yeah, all the different artefacts and a really good mix of people,
and it all came together. 

GRAHAM:  I'm sure a few owners of the stuff were here tonight - that they
owned two or three hundred years ago 

TOM:  like that moose's head?! 

KATE: if I had to choose one thing, then for me it's always the music, and
that was kicking, amazing, yeah, way to go!  it was nice.  but it's also a
great play space, and being able to move around, listen to stuff, learn a
bit, you know, it's been a good experience. 

GRAHAM:  the photographs that were being projected were the best part of
the party, I thought, they're by Julia Morris, a couple of bisexual
friends of hers making love. 

JULIA:  oh man, don't ask me now, it's too early in the morning! 

GRAHAM:  no, the best thing was a lot of good interaction among the people
and the relaxed vibe. 

KATE:  the body painting too!  Jason's a great body painter, he was
painting that model all over for hours, Sparrow?  

GRAHAM:  I thought they were tattoos when I walked in. 

JULIA:  yeah, I wanted to get painted. 

TOM:  it's like having a tattoo for the night, so you get the thrill
without the pain or the paranoia that you're going to have it for the rest
of your life 

ADRIAN:  it was just a lovely experience!  the dancefloor was hot, they
were kicking it! 

DJ PAUL:  I liked the one girl who asked if I had any rock and roll
records! 

CATHY:  I thought it was a really interesting mix of people and I thought
that, even though they all came from different backgrounds and they all
had different interests, I think that the energy coalesced and everybody
became one and it was an amazing experience.  also the dancefloor was just
great, the DJ was really good and the music was moving the whole time and
everybody seemed to be having a really good time.

dear forrest, great post!  all I ask is that you and a couple of others
stop including me with what david has been saying on this subject.  I've
said almost nothing at all in this thread; indeed I posted yesterday (and
have told him ftf) that I thought he should have left this stuff till much
later when we all know each other a lot better. I have a lot of respect
for his firsthand knowledge and dedication in these matters and love for
him, of course, which I am *not* denying, but it seems I get blamed for
"leading"  the zippies, and for *not* leading the zippies.  we're all free
individuals, our common ground being our desire to unite tecno and organic
in ourselves and on our planet - which, as I've said endlessly, is a
pretty huge area of agreement which still allows within it all manner of
individual differences of emphasis and personal priorities.  that's all. 
I deeply appreciate what you've written but, as I've already said, I am
not going to get involved in this thread at all right now. of course if
you're criticising me for *something else* then let me know so I can
defend myself or 'fess up.  OK?  >:-) fraser.

	Racism is a disease.  It is a very powerful meme that infects 
	cultures.  It can and will infect any human individual regardless
	of genetic or cultural make-up, political agenda, beliefs, etc.
	Almost every one on the planet is "Racism Positive", it is unavoidable
	if you live in the "western world". (I've never lived in the "non-
	western" world so I can't comment on that) Society at large, whether
	you are "black" or "white", teaches you to be racist.  In this country
	SKIN COLOR seems to be the way that people are racially classified.
	It has always amazed me that, for instance, well let's take a 
	"hypothetical" example...  Two "interracial couples" have children.
	(For the sake of the argument the Male of couple A is a "black african"
	from lagos, the Female is a "white celt" from Wales, the Female of
	couple B is a Senagalese "black" the Male is a "Parisian White".
	Each couple has 5 or more children who come out varying shades of 
	brown, (african genes tend to be dominant), now the fun begins...
	A "light" Male from couple A meets a "darker" Female of the B clan,
	they fall in love and have children (This is prime time kiddies:).
	One child comes out with very wavey dark blonde hair, hazel eyes
	full lips and "fair skin" (though she gets a savage tan in the summer :)
	her brother comes out with slightly darker hair, mich more kinky,
	clearly brown skin, brown eyes and long legs.  Now they both move to
	New York and go about their respective lives, one's an artist, the
	other becomes a stock broker on wall street.  Christmas comes
	and the stock broker invites their sibling to the company cocktail
	party where they introduce people to their sister/brother. The "blacks" 
	in the room say "Gee I didn't realize she was a sista" the "white"
	people in the room say "Gee I didn't realize he had "white blood" in
	the family."  The interesting thing is that from now on she will be
	looked upon as being "non-white" or "black" by anybody (on both sides
	of the political/cultural spectrum) if they see her brother or other
	"dark" people from her family.  This obsession with color, drives 
	racism in this country.  I have a friend who is "jewish" (of european
	descent) she dated lots of different people, but not many "jewish"
	(by jewish law) guys.  Finally she met one that she loved, but he
	also happened to be "black", ( His grandmother on his mother's side
	was an ashkanasi jew, which by jewish law makes him jewish) 
	He also proffessed to follow judaism (more or less).  
	Honestly thinking that her granmother would be pleased that she had 
	finally found a "nice jewish boy" she takes him home. WRONG!

	So what is to be done?  We ALL are racism positive, some are in
	advanced stages, some are in remission, but we all carry the virus.
	Part of recovery (or at least management) of the disease is to recognize
	that we all have it and that it is active to some extent, that doesn't
	make you bad, wrong, or anything and it DOESN'T MAKE YOU A RACIST.
	A RACIST is someone who exhibits symptoms of the advanced stages of the`
	disease.

	Raving, in it's pure form is a cultural anti-body or counter meme to
	racism,  But since we all carry the meme of racism and we bring that
	with us to the parties that we attend and throw, it is easy to fall
	back into racist behavior, the society at large pushes us that way.
	At a good party all of that bullshit is broken down by the Vibe.
	I have seen the Vibe so strong that it has literally put the toughest
	homeboy in tears (well maybe he got a hold of a good hit of E as well:)
	In case all of you "white" people didn't know, what is behind that
	"tough gangster" pose that people tend to lable on many people of color
	is the sadness and fear of a society that has excluded them, remember
	we/they watch the same TV as you did when you grew up.  Little children
	are naturally enthusiastic, even young black children in the ghetto
	come up believeing that they are loved and accepted by society BUT
	THEY LEARN VERY QUICKLY that that is not the case, (usually by age 10)
	all that is left is amazement, sadness, and a sense of being unloved,
	this turns into resolution, anger and rage. But if you can (and not
	everyone has the strength courage or abilities) take on the healing
	of this situation, you will see the most amazing transformation of
	your life.

	Some of us on the list are going to make an attempt this summer.

	Stay Tuned.

Hello,

I've been following the discussions here, concerning the zippies, F&F,
UK raves, etc.

So far, I have yet to see any explicit zippie philosophy, other than
bits and pieces - so I have to comment based on that.  If my perception
is wrong, it is only because the zippies have not posted a pointer to a
specific philosophy.  Also, I am including all of David Dei's posts
with the letterhead "Megatripolis Parallel University" on it as being
part of the zippie philosophy (otherwise he shouldn't use that .sig).

>From what I have read on hyperreal and on sfraves for a year, I think
that there is a definite difference in outlook on life between sfraves
and the zippies.

My reading is that the sfraves philosophy centers around PLUR - Peace,
Love, Unity and Respect.  This is in complete sync with The Summer of
Love in San Francisco in 1967, where the hippies put flowers into the
gun barrels of the police - and got a smile in return.  The idea here
is Love will *transform* the world -- one person at a time.

The posts of the zippies seem to center around the negativity in the
world.   They seem to feel that you can fix the problems in the world
one by one.  They don't seem to realize that these problems (racism,
poverty, etc.) are SYMPTOMS, not causes.  The cause is negativity in
people's hearts.  If you fix one problem, another will arise in its
place due to this negativity.

You don't cure darkness by studying it and informing people about the
characteristics of darkness - YOU JUST TURN ON THE LIGHT.

This is why sfraves people can't understand why someone would turn off
the music and stop the vibe - to lecture in the middle of a rave.

The vibe speaks much more eloquently than any words.

Hello,

Here are some specifics of why I have found the zippie philosophy to be
somewhat negative and materialistic.  This is based on what I have read
here - if this is inaccurate, then post a pointer to where we can access
text that says otherwise. 

Fraser> Laptoppling The System

This phrase illustrates a general point of view, which is that our
problems are due to "the system".  Unfortunately, if you look at Bosnia
and Russia, where much worse systems were toppled, you find that
toppling the system does nothing, by itself, to improve things.

Dei>All I received back was anger - how dare I generalise, as if the
>opinion that this country consumes 75% of the worlds resources were just an
>opinion, that might only hold valid for some US citizens.

I won't get into how this ambiguous statistic in constructed.  

Instead, I'll point out that many people I met in India with incomes of
$30 a month were a LOT happier than most rich Americans.

Material resources do not bring happiness.  So, accusing us of hogging
75% of what is a minor aspect of reality is just plain silly.

Dei>SO my SF friends - DO not be alarmed if I continue to badger you all
>UNTIL YOU BEGIN TO ACCEPT A BIT OF THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR PUTTING RIGHT THE
>WRONGS COMMITTED BY THIS COUNTRY EVEN IF THEY WERE COMMITTED BY A PREVIOUS
>GENERATION because our dystanies are all intertwined.

I'm sorry but I've never found ANY philosophical basis for this point
of view.  Each person is an individual.  There have been so many wrongs
committed in the history of the world, that it is impossible to count.
Each person *directly* involved is responsible.  Each person not involved 
is NOT responsible. 

The only way that this point of view is even conceivable is for people
to only focus on one or two wrongs (usually recent racism).  If they
bothered to open their minds to thousands of years of history, they
would understand how silly this idea is.  Are Italians responsible for
every injustice by the Romans?  Are the French responsible for the acts
of Charlemagne and Napoleon?  Are the Hungarians responsible for the
acts of Attila?  Are the Mongolians responsible for the acts of Gengis
Khan? 

:-) And, what if we are descended from Aliens?  Does that make us
responsible for injustices on Alpha Centauri?

1). You are right to say that their where many important white people in 
the early acid house movement particularly in the UK.
2). To say that that the acid house movement in England did not bridge 
the gap between funk (a black music but mostly listened to by whites) and 
reggae/dub/hip-hop (which was mostly listened to by blacks) is equally 
talking nonsence.  You were not in England for this movement (I was) so 
how can you comment on it?
3). I just back from Friday's at 1015 and yes you are right: their is a 
very good cross-over their and the vibe/people where a lot more racially 
mixed then at, say, Friends and Family.  This is excellent and is a good 
direction for the future.  I was well impressed!

Perhaps because unlike you, he thinks that England is not the birthplace 
of the world. Any fusion between music styles could also be going on  
elsewhere in the world.

Don't take this as a flame but please :-)  don't JUDGE Friends and Family on
a racial basis. One reason the mix of F&F comes out as it does is that the
core of the group comes from sfraves ie ONLINE. I teach computer science at
college of san mateo and I can tell you firsthand that there are FAR FAR
more whites and asians involved with computers than blacks. There are of 
course many reasons for this but the fact is still the fact. Thus, whenever
I see a group that comes from a computer background I would be STUNNED to
see more blacks and hispanics than whites and asians. My PhD is in chemistry
so I know that out of 150,000 recent degrees ( over a decade ) somewhere
less than 10% when to blacks/hispanics. I can also tell you that the
people who train chemists WANT to change this and recrute actively to change
this but change is slow - especially with the breakdown of family and school
dropout rates - the problems are many!

Thus, consider that you are now online yourself. DO YOU know as many people
of color who are as "computer active" as whites and asians? Would you expect
a group of people gathering from an online forum to have as many blacks as
whites for example? So judging F&F this way is both unfair and STUPID of you.
It will get people mad. It will get you judged as an idiot if not simply
foolish or naieve. It would help you perhaps if you met more of us outside
of the arguments that have been "exploding" on sfraves recently. There seems
to be a lot of misunderstandings surfacing. Perhaps more exploring on your
part is in order ? 

The F&F group is a wonderful group of people and from all I can tell not at
all racist. In my experience we welcome ANY and EVERY smiling face that
enters regardless of skin color. From what you say online YOU seem to be the
one that goes around looking at and counting representives of skin color.
"This group doesn't have enough black" "this group has the right amount of
 black, yellow and white" etc.  Why judge individuals this way? Why judge
 groups this way ?  Why judge at all ?

 On the subject of "Racism and Raving" , I'd like to play off some ideas that
Geoff brought up in his original post, informed sometimes with my (dated)
experience of growing up and living in Honolulu , Hawaii. My inserted
comments will be in [] marks.

 Another meme that is ingrained into us as much as the mitochondria
in our cells is what I used to call "ethnicism" ... I've decided to use the
term TRIBALISM instead. This being the identification by the individual
of membership in an "WE" group - "WE" being identified by common 
culture . It is a meme with good and bad points. Good: perpetuation of folk
culture ; providing isolated mental/cultural environments for the evolution
of ideas that may  be of benefit to other tribes; providing a haven and
comfort to the individual in harsh times. Bad: Definitions of "WE"
that depend on demonising/victimizing "THEM" ;  "WE" defined often 
strongly in genetic/racial terms; isolation of "WE" from beneficial ideas
from "THEM".

 Growing up in Hawaii , I saw both the good and bad of tribalism. While
all ethnic groups tended to group together for cultural events , a common
"local" regional culture developed that was a product of inputs from all
ethnic goups. Intermarriage is common - examples of "local" tribalism
over "ethnic" tribalism. And , yes , many parents had fits when their
children decided to marry outside the ethnic tribe.  Occupations and 
unemployment often seemed to be determined by ethnicity too , sadly.

 Aside: Whenever I see the term "tribal" used on a rave flyer or other
such context , it makes me smile a wry smile ...  :-\

 Racism/tribalism is a part of the human condition that , like defecation ,
everybody does , but nobody should expect to be praised for, or unduly
criticised for. Of course , if you smear your "excrement" all over the street
and insist that others do too ( the KKK , Aryan Nations , etc. ) then
you've got MY bad opinion! ( I better stop using this slippery analogy 
now! )

> Raving, in it's pure form is a cultural anti-body or counter meme to

 Any space/event that allows the different "tribes" to come together in
common good intent will do a lot to reduce the demonizing of "THEM".
( Even sporting events !  Although, they are based on the participation
in a winner-take-all ritual conflict , not a shared hedonistic event. That's
one of the reasons why I prefer dancing at raves to being a screamer 
at a football game!)

 What I'm really waiting for  is the generation of local common cultures
analogous to the "local" culture I grew up with in Hawaii. Let all the "tribes"
give input to the creation of beautiful , new , every-evolving rare flowers.

 [ Sheesh! Whatever came over me! I must be trying too hard to go in to
   work on a Saturday .... still , it's a beautiful idea  :-) ]

 From what I can remember ( having never gotten around to reading the 
WIRED magazine Zippy article , and only vaguely remembering other
articles and posts about Zippy philosophy ), the two ideas I like from 
the Zippy thang are:

 Megatripolis - A space where we can conceive of a future perfect 
   society , and in turn comport ourselves according to our idea of
   how the citizens of that future perfect society would act , and
   party amongst themselves.

 Pronoia - A feeling that somewhere , someone is intending or acting
   to do you a good deed. Also , behaviour based on that feeling.

 Cool , n'est pas?

Yes, that's true.  But other cultures are in turn separate from the white 
culture, but also part of the global culture.  That doesn't mean that 
they're the same or that they should be the same, or that they should be 
considered the same.

 Partially almost rave-related -

 There are two concerts in San Francisco this April that I'm going
to , and I was wondering if anyone else was going to them too. On
Monday , April 10th , Siouxie and the Banshees ( w/ Spiritualized )
are playing at the Warfield. The other concert is Hawkind ( the 
Dave Brock version of the band ) , playing at Slim's on Tuesday, 
April 25th. Hawkwind has been doing more ambient/techno stuff
in their recent work , which I like , although I've been a fan of
theirs since the late 70's , when they did more space rock/trippy
grunge stuff. 

 After the Hawkind show ( if it got out early enough ) , I was going
to try that club that has Jungle music on Tuesday nights ( I hope 
they're still doing that in a month's time ).

go dave!  you are so right.  perhaps it's time to unleash some moral 
indignation where it might do some good.  or at least make the gesture.

so, how about this?  we should regard this forum as also an opportunity 
to WRITE, just like if we were reporters or columnists or something at a 
real-life newspaper.  also you should be allowed formally to adopt 
whatever persona you want in your statements.  but i've raised this idea 
on here before and I know that some people disagree.  let's debate!

think of what you do here as a kind of art and you will see what i mean.

anyway, dave...what advice do you have to give to the raving peoples as 
to what might be the best course of action to take?

thatsallfornow,

This is from Starhawk, the _Spiral Dance_, on trance:

	"Rhythm, whether experienced in motion, song, drumming, chanting, 
or poetic meter, also induces a state of heightened 
awareness..AfroAmerican religions depend heavily on rhythmic drumming and 
dancing to induce a trance state in which worshippers become "mounted" or 
possessed by the "orishas," the Gods and Goddesses.  The metrical rhythm 
of poetry, according to Robert Graves, induces a trance of heightened 
sensitivity.  In Craft tradition, it was believed that certain rhythms 
could induce particular emotional states.  Drummers originally 
accompanied armies because their rhythms could make men fighting mad.  
(This secret, as far as I can tell, has been lost to the military and 
Witch covens alike, only to be redicovered by the producers of disco 
music.)  Spoken trance inductions are always soft, singsong, and rhythmic.
	Boredom can also bring on trance--as generations of daydreaming 
schoolchildren have disocvered.  When we are not stimulated, sensorily, 
emotionally, or mentally, awareness turns elsewhere."
(1979, revised 1989)

i guess we now know what she might think about house music, which, as i 
understand it, once was disco.

I just called the Tribal Funk line to get information regarding their party and heard a disturbing discourse on tagging.  Amongst other things, it has lost us the use of the Richmond Civic Center for all night parties?  Is this true?  Would be hella shame if it were.  But in general, i seem to have noticed a decline in rave party locations as of late.  What's going on?  Are promoters having an extremely difficult time finding locations or are they getting lazy?


Also, I'll be at Tribal Funk tonight.  Probably in the ambient room (if their is one).  I'll be wearing jeans and a share t-shirt.  (little boy holding an ice cream cone.  Journees written on the back.  If you see me, please come by and say hi!

As for the current lashings that are going on on this list, please stop the personal attacks on each other.  Everyone has the right to their opinion without being personnaly attacked.  And just because you believe in something strongly doesn't mean everyone else must agree or they're idiots.

Is this true?  Would be hella sha me if it were.  But in general, i seem
to have noticed a decline in rave party locations as of late.  What's
going on?  Are promoters having an extremely difficult time finding
locations or are they getting lazy? 

having sought locations for Your Sisters' House, and to some extent, 
friends and family, i can tell you that yes, it is extremely difficult to 
find locations, both outdoor and indoor.  this is especially true if you 
want to throw an all-ages event, or an event where alcohol is not 
served (or where your use of the space is not contingent upon how much 
the bar makes.)  

and even if you want to hold a party in your own home (if it is large 
enough), you may run into problems.  the 938 harrison st. new year's eve 
ball was invitation-only, and was held in terrence alan's home and 
workspace.  maps were handed out to partygoers depicting all the fire 
exits.  yet it was still raided.  

ah, how i love san francisco!  the space problem makes me miss new york, 
where there's so much industrial wasteland and chaos that it's much 
easier to find a site (outside manhattan), providing you don't mind a bit 
of grunge and toxicity.

Tristan, make sure you read carefully before you oppose something I've
said.  I don't mind when people take an opposing view to mine, but
please don't put words in my mouth or simply misconstrue what I said
because you were not careful.

In response to your point #2, I did *not* say that acid house in the UK
did not bridge the gap between races and musical scenes.  Quite the
opposite, I said I applauded how this *rebuilt* the links that had been
established as long before as the early '60s (following the influx of
people from all over the Commonwealth, including Jamaica and the British
West Indies colonies, India, Pakistan and many other places, after the
end of World War II).  In fact, I went on for several *paragraphs* on 
this theme.  

I wasn't in the UK in the 1980s, but I was there in 1979.  I specifically
remember going to the now-demolished Nashville Room in Kensington to see
a show featuring the Mod Revival band the Purple Hearts.  The crowd there
was every ethnicity and gender and what-have-you.  The big news on the
scene was the Southall police repression from that spring which brought
everyone in London's working class neighborhoods, whether white Anglo,
Pakistani, West Indian or whatever, out against the new Thatcher government.
Culture, politics, music always interact with each other.

Point taken, however I would hope that we can move on to talking about how
RAVE itself fits in with these other issues - like how we are to at the
very least we may begin to start attaching values to what RAVE stands for -
so that when we say the word RAVE - we are not just left with a "that the
one where they take drugs and do some kinda temporary community thing "

I for one, would like to see our Temporary Autonomous ZOnes becoming
PERMANENT AUTONOMOUS ZONES - at the very least, this is what we deserve. To
spend so much time building up a community only to have it retreat into the
numbness of a grey street. - We need enormous zones of permanent beauty
-places where we feel SAFE, where we are all accepted for our intrinsic
basic value - where no one see us as OUTSIDERS deserving PERSECUTION.

But you we might be forgiven for being firmly sincere if we arrived in a
world that was so  inescapably alienating to the human spirit that
aboriginals were cordened off in RESERVES and NO WHERE could I find a SMILE
on the STREET. If anything what unnerves me and causes my almost hysterical
"raise the alarm" attitude is to see people everywhere VISIBLY UNHAPPY. A
DROUGHT  of happiness of is what I have experienced in the 18 months I have
been on the west coast. People are so afraid, they turn from your gaze,
unable to look you in the eye. On haight street a child might laugh
nervously, scared, - another is zoned out, people everywhere talk in
whispers, their hands making no gestures. Faces devoid of animation, look
silently on, I am shocked at what I see. HOW COULD this BE? HOw could an
entire Country be so visibly under STRESS, In PAIN.

SURELY there must be a reason? surely something horrifically wrong has
occured here - lets ask a few people who seem to know whats up, in fact
lets demand, demand some answers - SFRAVERS HOW CAN THIS HAPPEN - please
tell me.

I am refereing to spontaneous LOSS of AGEISM - suddenly those OLD HENS are
reborn as artists, alive after years of sitting in wait for death. They
have miraculously found that life has given us all a second chance at our
dreams, and everywhere optimism trickles like a fresh stream,  sprung from
some forgotten pool into the light of day.

Thank you. Thank you. Clicked on this message and got an amazing energy
charge on my index finger. Well, this is precisely what I am trying to do -
to attempt some visionary  discussion in the community - so that we can at
the very least begin tying up some pieces of this jigsaw puzzle. Looking at
problems one at a time is ok, but easily leads to despondancy, only looking
at solutions runs the risk of forgetting what it is that we are trying to
solve. - we need some cogent debate on Rave, Life the Universe and
Everything - an evolving multivoiced philosophy which will provide us with
catalyzing  inspiration.

We must have the courage to look at ourselves - to examine our own
inadequices, to make hard decisions, so that we may  achieve at the very
least  " a politics naked as the clear blue light of day"  - we DEFINITELY
need shamans not priests, bards not politicians.

As to advising the direction in which rave should take - lets open this
forum to ALL constructive debate - I have many ideas about possible routes,
I have witnessed a political evolution first hand - but I do realise that
each situation is unique, but surely it would be madness to remain silent,
to always take the easy road. There is much that is at stake - much that
has occured over the past four weeks alone in the world, that needs to be
discussed by all of us. Important facts affecting our very survival have
been bumped from the news headlines.

SO let  ALL sfravers of the HEART take up Anthrax's NOBLE suggestion - lets
all write the POETRY of LIFE as WE see it - discussing the things that are
IMPORTANT to ALL OF US - and that includes the Planet - Gaia, without
stopping in fear of censorship, or flamming, or that our views are too high
or low, too loud or too soft. We must escape the constrains of
self-censorship and self-policing, and run the risk of sounding
IMPASSIONED, Idealistic, Visionary, Over-Emotional. Lets just spill our
beans, and run our raves, our lives likes wild enraptured poets making love
to the sheer beauty of life itself.

Lets show the world that SAN FRANCISCO can be the first Interplanetary Rave
Mulitversity - with discussion on absolutely every subject of importance to
raving, misbehaving,  healing and feeling, our world and worlds beyond.

- David Dei

Well, don't get me wrong this is not about me not taking note of other
viewpoints. But just because other views might not be tolarant of my
opinion does not mean that I am going to MODIFY my philosophy. If I did
that, then soon i would find myself agreeing with those who maintain that
one should not stand OUT or ALONE from the conventional wisdom. Right now
the conventional wisdom in america it that we should get our kicks where we
can, and forget about the mass of humanity around the planet, forget about
the planet itself. Love and Peace are now just Gap, Nike, Fruitopia
consumer statements. There is nothing that is not fundemental that has not
been STOLEN from us and used to sell products. DO I fall in line? Do I
listen to those on SFRAVEs who are preaching unity at all costs, even if
this means that some of us are prevented from Expressing our VIEW? IN fact
Brian Behlondorf has seriously suggested that I NOT POST ON SFRAVES AT ALL!
Am i that way out of line that my views are not to be tolarated?
Is this what rave is about - that OUTSIDERS are not WELCOME?

I suppose people would rather I did not make  uncomfortable  reality checks
- you would rather I KEPT QUIET about some unavoidable FACTS.  Is this what
I am hearing? That Rave is only about having a good time - then back to
work on monday morning. That I must OBEY authority at all costs? That Rave
is not essentiallly about FREEDOM to Dance wherever and whenever the whim
takes US?

I would rather it were about making a start at bringing together the
Rainbow Nation of God - of all tribes who have rejected slavery. That we
should  aware unity to an IDEA of Universal Acceptance of ALL PEOPLE , THAT
WE MUST AWAKEN TO OUR dystany.

Seriously - what are we doing here - is this just about a good time? or is
there more to life? Could this really be a wonderful story about the
greatest, evolution this planet has seen - a beautiful, under-rising ,  an
exotic uncovering of our TRUE nature - our common dystany,  to awaken the
greatest potential in ALL of our unique egoverses. That perhaps we are
about to make the greatest discovery since the invention of astronomy and
the greatest social event since the founding of democracy and the
acceptance of a planetary council of nations.

I put it to the VOTE - if this community of 400 plus ravers would rather I
and others, stopped talking about SOCIETY,  about the practical uncovering
of the SYSTEM and ITS Alternative - that we vote on this issue - I would
hate to end up cheerleading muy emotionally charged rantings to a
community that cannot tolerate my unique view. We have much that we can
learn from each other. I from You all and vice versa, but we can only do
this if at base level we accept that it might entail some discomfort - some
hysteria, some poetry, some hyperbole, some passion and emotion. I am
passionate about the topic of saving this planet - all I ask is that you
accept this - that I am not trying to sell anything that Blake or Shelley
did not.

Lets all Up the Evolution and increase the VIBE. I am truly sorry if this
cannot happen with myself playing a part - I would hope that at heart you
all feel my intentions are not bad, that I have SEEN a lot growing through
one evolution already, and that having done so, I might have at the very
least some interesting if unpopular insights that could strengthen the
scene in San Francisco at the very least.

All my love

David Dei

I've gotten access to hyperreal, so now I'll be maintaining the sfraves
calendar directly on that machine.  So now you should be able to get
the current rave guide (as soon as I type in new info) via ftp and
the web.  The guide will still be mailed on Thursdays, but if you
have ftp or www access, you can always get the most current listings.

Via ftp, the guide is located in /raves/sf/calendar/sfrcal.txt.

I haven't actually tested the web page, but the URL should be
http://hyperreal.com/~dhchung/sfrcal.html.  Let me know if it works.
Right now, it doesn't have any fancy graphics, links to scanned in 
flyers, or any other bells and whistles, but that will be coming in
the future.

Also, both directories have the SFR phone list, which I hadn't really
been maintaining, but I went through the last few calendars and tried
to update it.

Umm, not to take away from the rest of you message, David (Dei, that is), 
but i think Ann was referring to the other Dave (Ilstrup, that is), who 
posted under the heading "Energy redirection, anyone?".

Which brings up the point that in a list with this much traffic, it's 
probably a good idea when replying directly under the same heading to also 
quote (or paraphrase) at least a little of the content/context (with an 
emphasis on "a little").

Back to the original post about the Communications Decency Act, if 
you want to know more, there are Web sites at:
	http://www.phantom.com/~slowdog/   
	http://uvacs.cs.virginia.edu/~hwh6k/public/S314_stuff.html
both of which include info and a pointer to a petition against its 
passage.  This may not be relevant to raves in general but it is 
certainly relevant to sfraves (and any other free-thinking mailing lists).

That is understandable.  And I do not think Brian's suggestion was 
because he does or does not share your views.  That is not the issue.  
The issue is that this debate which belongs on some other forum is 
filling up my mailbox with drivel which I see as part of the same 
societal structure that I'd just as soon forget about.  It does not 
belong here.  There are other forums more suited to what you would like 
to discuss, David.

> Is this what rave is about - that OUTSIDERS are not WELCOME?

I maintain that "rave" is something different to everyone and to discuss 
why it *is* this and *not* that is merely inviting more of the flurry 
this list has seen over the past week.

I didn't quote this part for any particular reason other than that you 
sound a lot like a politician :)

Perhaps you should read the "Welcome to SFRaves" message you get upon 
subscribing.

Pride comes before the fall, David.  And, incidentally, if your rantings 
are emotionally charged, you could probably benefit from some level- 
headed thinking.

David, you and others interested in discussing the topics you mentioned 
have every right to do so.  But you are infringing on others' by playing 
it out here.  Please, take this to another forum.  I am not agreeing or 
disagreeing with you.  I am only saying that this discussion does not 
belong here.  It is fodder for an entirely new list, which hopefully 
those at best.com can help you with (rave-reform@best.com?).

*Please* respond to me *privately*.  I cannot be the only one who has had 
enough of this.

Eventhough I don't agree with all that is said by David, Fraser, et al.
I DO believe that the stuff discussed here is VERY relevant to raving,
to the scene at large and to us all.  Far more relavent then outting
E dealers for bunk e or merely posting reviews of various parties.

Even though some of the opinions (and counter opinions are obnoxious
If we can't have these kinds of discussions here then the list isn't
really worth the bandwidth that we use.  One can always go to alt.rave
if you just want to hear about the latest music, style, drug, etc.

This list *is* about the San Francisco scene and these *are* relevent
issues here, if any of you go out half as much as I do (and I don't
go out as much as I used to) then you know that the Scene *is* becomming
more and more segregated, not only racially but musically, gender-wise
and class wise.  Please even though some of these issues are uncomfortable
for some of us, they MUST be aired.  We have been to this place before and
people always try to squish these types of discussions, we, this country, this
planet NEEDS to have open honest dialog about issues such as xenophobia and
racism. PLUR don't mean shit if we can't openly talk about these issues
without having to censor OR attack people personally.

I think we "yanks" need to step back and listen to Tristan, Fraser and David
because they provide input outside of our little closed loop.  Fraser, Tristan
and David need to realize that there are some very wise people here and some
of the things that they are talking about have been in full swing here for
YEARS, it is very annoying to some people to hear you talk about things that
many of them take for granted as if you are bringing it to us.

Look, England might not be the birth place of all great music it's just 
that, until music has been given the English touch, it is not great 
music.  And it has now got to the stage where Britain has been making the 
best music for the last twenty years.

1).  Point well taken.
2).  If their are more whites and Asians on the internet (which is 
because you have to be rich to get the equipment to be online in the 
first place) then you have a moral duty to pass on information to people 
that can't afford the equipment (i.e. blacks).  Also don't forget that 
modem computer's are now available in some cafes and pretty soon they 
will be available like public telephone's.  When this happens their will 
be more blacks online but their will still be the same number of blacks 
at F&F because your average black is cool enough to go to a party that is 
not full to the brim with white trash kids.

I have never heard a more racially predudice statement about the social
welfare of african americans. Iknow just as many "blacks" on BBSs as I
do caucasian, asian or any other. your statement, and all the recent
activity going on here at sfraves are really tempting me to unsubscribe
to the list. I have never seen a pro active group have such tainted
views of racism and anti-racism. Everyone involved in these last
discussions really offend me and all of my friends. I joined raving for
the positive energy, and sfraves for positive discussions. It looks like
there is none here. Hopefully that will change soon so I don't have to
leave. I enjoy the possibilities that an e-mail echo can produce but not
when they have no moral or emotional value whatsoever. Maybe Brian can
create a second echo for wich these assinine topics can be moved to.

Let me tell you. It has nothing to do with the fact that these people
cant afford modems. They simply don't want to be on the pompus forum. I
apolagize to those of wich have never offended anyone, and are here for
the same reasons I am. To talk about the positive things we can do to
change or world, and more directly, change it through raving.

well, the results of my little national poll are still coming in. I'd ask 
anyone else from other areas to post in soon.  (SEE QUESTIONNAIRE BELOW)  
results are a bit patchy and people offer different and personal reasons 
for their local activities.  sorry I'm not efficient enough to collate 
these findings better - I'd be happy to pass this on to someone more 
technically equipped but will continue in the meantime.
what do people think about this stuff so far?  is there a pattern emerging?

1. 
it  seems like a national crackdown with all the fuk parties in midwest 
getting busted n all the chi-town, sf, n detroit parties that have been 
busted but it's not a crackdown.  it's just that in the area where the 
scene has aged a bit the cops have sort of caught on.  there have been 
"techno parties" in detroit since the mid '80's n SF got their thing 
going right along with england since SF is all cosmopolitan like n up 
with what's going on in the world.  the newer places where the scene's 
started up like around 90-92 haven't quite had long enough exposure to 
law enforcement so the police can deal with the situation.  also i know 
in detroit that almost all the parties have been in detroit so only 
detroit cops had to deal with 'em.  in other areas parties r probably 
held in various suburbs along with the inner city and it's more spread 
out.  the cops that sees those parties probably see them as a rare phenomon.

I don't know- I think the rave scene has hit a certain "critical mass"
in the public consciousness, and people are getting concerned. I've 
seen several lists of "street drug terms" which list "rave" as a
kind of psychedelic crack house. I spect the cops are under pressure
to do something about the "rampant drug use among our young people" or
something silly like that.

As far as the North Carolina scene goes- there has definitely been
a pick up in the number of busts- two this month in separate cities
(one in Greensboro: Babylon, First Friday and one in Raleigh) where
all present were lined up and searched (this is hearsay; i wasn't there).

If it continues, I expect the rave scene will go further underground,
and we'll return to the "old days" (about 2 years ago, around here)
where most raves were organized by telephone tree.

I would be interested in finding out if this is a nationwide trend, also.

cheers,
jem

No problems in Pittsburgh or Baltimore or . Haven't had any such crackdown
here. Once again proving that SF and Detroit are not the center of the
raving universe.

Here in StLouis, we've been having similar problems; supposedly the local
police recieved a grant from the DEA for a special anti-rave task force.
I do know the chief of police told a friend-rave-promoter that no
matter what permits they got, he would find a way to shut them down...

Dallas, the crackdown is hitting Dallas also. Jan. 1 - They busted New
Years at 12:30. and sent thousands out into the streets on the the most
dangerous night of the year... I heard their was a RAVE task force in the
DPD. The final bust was brutal, I witnessed a cop beat a 17 year old, 90
pound kid... with no provocation. Arrests were made also... In Detroit, I
heard a major stormtrooper raid was made, everyone arrested, and the
police called the media, film crews caught the scene... I heard a bill is
about to pass in UK. virtually outlawing RAVES... Could I get more info on
SF busts and/or rave scenes?

I realize you wanted this posted, but I'm not informed enough to do it. 
However, I can say that the Toronto scene is quite free of busts, save 
those in residential areas that get too loud. There are always police 
around, but they keep a pretty low profile.

thanks,  vijay

Actually that's the reason I stoped going to raves here in Chicago,
you pay $15 and almost every single party gets busted around 1-2 am...

here is the questionnaire I sent out:-

>BACKGROUND
>most people in san francisco have NOW come to realise that there is an
>ongoing police crackdown on the rave scene.  it started on January 1st and
>has continued throughout most of the Bay Area to the point where it has
>become a regular, virtually weekly thing.  the latest was last saturday
>when Friends & Family (an SFRaves internet collective) was bust at 4am,
>with a certain amount of police brutality. 

>QUESTION
>what I want to know is: is this a national or a local phenomenon?  we ask
>for reports from YOUR local area. 

>PROBLEM
>some people here still argue (or fondly wish to go on believing) that it
>is simply the mayor (who's an ex-cop) or some merely local politics that
>is causing it all.  I suppose there are even some people who are not
>convinced that there IS a crackdown.  please post a report from YOUR area,
>bearing this problem in mind as you do so. 

>PROMISE 
>We PROMISE to put the reports together and post it on alt.raves in the
>near future.  thankyou for your cooperation in this matter which is of

Hello , Larry Ching here. Giving my reactions to Geoff's post:

 My problem is with the wrappers many of their ideas have been contained
in ( ie - presentation ).  
> Even though some of the opinions (and counter opinions) are obnoxious

 The "eye for an eye" style of email discussion almost always
degenerates into 90% garbage posts.

 I unsubscribed to alt.rave a long time ago just because of the "trash"
content.

 I'm chewing over some thoughts about "the Scene" , but I need inputs
from more experienced ravers ...

 I agree with the idea of all involved taking a calming deep breath.  I also
feel that the participants should resolve to improve the quality of 
presentation . Oracular declamations from a pedestal or slinging verbal 
offal from the gutter are both offputting , no matter how emotionally "honest"
that might be to the writer. ( So sayeth the great Ching!!! ). 

 ... wandering away from Geoff's post for a long aside:

 To the purpose of improving the quality of the postings , from David Dei
in particular , but also from other SFRavers in general ,
I have gone out on a limb and written some "helpful hints" below - I
think other folks could probably benefit too , so don't think this stuff 
only applies to him!
 
 ( If any of you "White Oppressor Devil" SFRavers out there think that
   I'm inaccurate in what I'm about to write , please make corrections )

 I think what also grates many melanin-challenged SFRavers about the recent
series of posts by David Dei is that it's obvious that he has no idea of
what a white child learns about and experiences growing up in the San
Francisco Bay area. I believe that all the major issues that David has
raised has been a topic of a discussion group at school , or in the
media , or in the local activist press. There are social interactions between
ethnic groups that children of all races experience here that David is
ignorant of ( I have an inkling of them by reading, and talking to the
young people I know who have grown up here ).

 While using the history of other countries can be useful, forcing analogies 
to a foreign experience only amplifies where the analogies fail.

 One of the worst justifications for any political action you are
trying to promote to white young people is one of "ancestral guilt". I 
believe the sins of the fathers (not to mention forefathers) should NOT
be used as an ethical cudgel against the children. ( Everybody's got
ancestors who were shits , if you go back far enough, and everyone's
got ancestors who were saintly ). Addressing present problems is much more 
friendly, practical and productive.

-----------------------

 Enough 
-----------------------

 I wish I was a wiser man , to truly and effectively fix what I think have
been some recent problems. If I am going about it the wrong way , then
I now apologize to all you folks here in SFRaves.

 It's late , and I'm tired.

 [ Ok , one more thing before I hit the sack :-)  ]

 I think that a lot of issues can be better discussed and served NOT
by being worked out via SFRAves mass mailing discussions, but by plain
old fashioned face-to-face conferences and informal meetings. Even
conference telephone calls and video teleconferences have a "delay"
and "filtering" effect that adds confusion and misunderstanding.

 The recent survey and compilation of results that Fraser just performed
is a good example of what the medium is good for - sending out a 
specific , focused request for an action - and the reporting of
results. The medium is also good for reviews , listings , and other
such things that do not require an extended question/response interaction
or assertion/rebuttal/counter-rebuttal interaction.

 Flames continue mostly through the dragging out of call-and-response,
thereby increasing the heat. Stuff that would be said , argued about , and
agreed upon in 15 minutes at a realtime/real life sit-down get dragged
out for days. 

 Therefore - what about using SFRaves to announce meetings , said meetings
to be devoted to specific topics that all attendees can come prepared
to talk about , or at least come to listen to what others have to say?
Much better that using the highly inefficient mass emailing system of
SFRaves! And , these meetings can even be scheduled for before and
after raves . One of the things I liked about the events held by "Your 
Sister's House"  were the pre-dancing discussion groups . If the promoter 
is willing , a quiet space could even be reserved for meetings AT raves , 
a la Megatripolis .

 Good night!

	Larry Ching / larryc@netcom.com

PS - I also think online chat is the pits! I don't think AND type fast
  enough - that's why I'm not on vrave anymore.

If I am wrong I stand corrected but official statistics say otherwise.  
Don't forget their has been a lot of good research done on the 
excessability of technology for people living on the poverty line and it 
was very low indeed, let me tell you.  As African American's (weather you 
like or not) are more likely to be living on the poverty line then a 
white I made the assumption that their would be a hell of a lot more 
whites on the net then African American's.  I realize now that this was a 
mistake and I appologise.
Yours Tristan.

If people can not handle a good spirited debate then they are a bunch of 
utter lightweights that don't deserve the privalige of going to raves in 
the first place!  It is only through argument that we listen and it is 
only through listening that we can communicate and it is only bu 
communication that we can improve the scene, our lives, the world, the 
universe, etc.  You know what I mean?  Some people have got as much spunk 
as a dry fish!
Yours Tristan.

I couldn't call it a pattern just yet.  I think some areas/cities have
people on the force who have particular agendas, here in SF most long term
promoters know who these people are and tend to avoid them.  While it
is true that Mayor Jordan is the ex-chief of police, the crackdown here
in SF IMHO has more to do with "club receipts (or the lack there-of)" than
concerted political pressure.  In SF the police are just the enforcement
arm of the "club owners" or organized crime who rely on cash flow
of drink sales and admission to launder there money and do other things,
ravers just stumbled into this.  The DEA is probibly concerned, but mostly
for them it's a "dick" thing, they've been trying to get to the veil of
psychedelics that originate out here for years and they are still at it.
Some parties are an in your face affirmation that they can't stop it short
of violating lots of people`s civil right (coming this fall :)

There is something to be said tha "rave" for SF cops are now routine,
in the long run this might become an advantage.  When it is shown that
the parties are not "out of the ordinary" for the community then we can
put more pressure on the city government to stop.

BTW don't the mayortorial elections come around either this year or next
year? 18 year olds may not have bucks but they got numbers, and an organized
block of 30,000 San Francisco ravers can do wonders for a local election.
The mere fact that city hall knows that we are organizing to vote someone
in will make them take notice.

The Mayor of Baltimore is an ex-DA who is also a rhodes scholar, he has
publically come out for the decriminalization and legalization of drugs
as it is clear to him that as long as there is prohibition there will be
violence and unbridled exploitation.  I also know that at lease some of the
promoters in the city have a relationship with the city government.
With a homicide a day in the city of baltimore, the cops have been told
that they have more important things to do then harass ravers.

The truth of the matter is that if you become large and over-ground then you
will be forced into specific venues, this is about money more than it
is about politics (sorry to say).

Is there a nation-wide crack down?  Perhapse, but not in any publicized way.
If they made a big publicity stint about it, it would sorta be good,
because it would be blasted across the media and even though the media
would portray it as an EvilThing(tm) there would be some people out there
who would recognize it for what it really is and want it and would actively
seek it out.  The other part of our "rugged individualism" is the moment
the government tells a bunch of people that they can't have something, hords
of people who were not interested before want to know what it is that
they are being denied because if the Feds don't want us to have it it MUST
be good, more assult rifles have been sold since the ban than were in peoples
hands before the ban.  Now when and if the crackdown comes they will
undoubtedly seek for "organizers and leaders" to chop off their heads and
guess where they are going to go first, fraser :)  This will inevitably drive 
the Scene more underground which I believe may be a good thing. Or if they 
hit it hard enough, it will splatter into a thousand infectious pieces.

HAHAHA! Tell that to the Blues artists of the late 20's and 30's, or 
early Jazz artists."Sorry guys your music is no good cause the Queen 
hasn't put her spin on it." While you are entitled to your opinion, I 
find it very short-sighted and narrow minded. I suggest you try expanding 
your horizions a bit, and listen to some artists that aren't British.

Very good point. 

This is to EVERYONE:

Looking at the pattern of messages, and the flames that erupted(which I 
guiltly have been a part of) it seem that we have all been drug into 
these debates about the basis of our society, whether or not we are 
rasists,and misc. political ramblings. These are all, as they have 
proven, very volatile isssues. And they really do have a place for 
discussion. However, I really agree with Larry that there are MUCH better 
ways and forums for discussing these issues. And while I am sure that the 
people that want to continue arguing or make this list a sounding board 
for their political views will disagree, I urge everyone that feels the 
same way to simply ignore these type of posts. I for one am attempting to 
repent, and whenever I see one I am going to try real hard to find the 
letter "D" on my keyboard and press it :) . It takes two to flame(err so 
to speak) and I have found myself all to eager to indulge lately. If 
others keep indulging I really think this list will continue to 
degenerate into one hell of a mess. And there really are too many nice 
people here to let this happen....

Friday night I checked out brothers and sisters at 1015 folsom, for the 
first time.  If theres anyone who feels there aren't any clubs that have 
a diverse crowd, this is a good place to go.

I heard that this place has a real clubby feel to it, but gets better in 
the later hours.  First walking in, into the front room, was a crowd 
dancing to top 40, and older disco tunes.  This was alittle like stepping 
back in time when I wanted to go dancing, but didn't yet discover raves.  
There were many dancing with drinks in their hands, and there was alot of 
bumpin and grinded goin on.

After walking through I could hear some faster beats going in the main 
room.  There I discovered Galen cranking out some tunes and some familair 
ravers dancing amongst the assorted crowd.  I heard that Jeno was playing 
down stairs.  

I went downstairs, where the feel was alittle more intimate although the 
sound wasn't as good as the upstairs.  I was alternating up and down for 
awhile enjoying both.  After Galen, Garth came on.  He was playing some 
good tunes alot of them familiar, but the tempo was turned down.  This 
was a little bit of an ajustment, and part of me was hoping and expecting 
the pace to go up as I was starting to feel more energized as the night 
went on.  With my increased energy, I went back down stairs to some 
faster music.  I don't know who the dj was, but I was really having some 
fun with what he was playing.

Things really took off for me with Tracy's set in the main room after 
Garth.  There the vibe and the energy that was being shared was 
incredible.  It really felt that all differences were secondary to what 
was being shared.  Feeling that shared vibe, my inhibitions desolved 
away, and at some points I was dancing around the room connecting and 
sharing with everyone I saw.  Feeling that connectedness to the oneness 
of the vibe, peoples defences were down, and the joy of sharing was all 
around.

There is nothing better than a good debate. But I don't want to debate
if it means slinging the same garbage that is slung during a
presidential debate. I like to debate about the proper ways to create a
loophole for parties so it cant get busted. I like to debate proper ways
to ingest drugs so that you can get the best from them. I like to debate
over what is socially accepted and what isn't.
I WILL NEVER TRY TO DEBATE ABOUT SEXIST, RACIST OR INMORALISTIC TOPICS.

It just so happens that getting a modem with access can be as cheap as
150 dollars (100 dollars for a computer with cheap modem and 50 dollars
for 1 year service for basic e-mail). Even cheaper if this person is a
student. If you want to debate me, pick a topic that can challenge the
intelligence on this board and not the intelligence in your *ss.

I was sleeping last night when a loud voice said "No you can't go there" 
boomed through my bedroom at about 2AM. I looked outside and could'nt see 
anything so I went back to bed. Then the voice came again saying 
something about making u-turns. It was the police outside directing 
traffic with their loudspeaker turned up to full volume. With all the 
talk about noise disturbances and such, I decided to call 911. They told 
me that a concert had just got out around SJSU and they were trying to 
prevent accidents. They appologized for the noise. I went back to bed and 
heard the voice again but much softer. They actually turned the volume 
down just 5 minutes after I called. I know there is not much point to 
this but It really felt weird to phone 911 to report the police 
disturbing my sleep. Oh well, thanks for listening ... 8-)

Last night I went to the Jungle party at Stevenson warehouse and after sipping 
on a fourty and sucking on a balloon a brick flew by me and hit a DJ so I got 
in my car (minus car stereo) and went home.

went surfing with nick phillip this morning -- I'll be posting my celebrity 
surfing report now and again.

I must say this was annoying from guess who: " all I ask is that you
accept this - that I am not trying to sell anything that Blake or Shelley
did not."     Have you ever read Invisible Man by Ralph Ellisson? My vote for 
you David Dei is that you try 4 posts a day to this list 2 screens full 
maximum. And If this does not work try lurking. You asked.

Dear SFravers

A lot of what I am about is build on RAVE being a good thing - Which is why
I would like to see a thread like the above, filled with positive ideas.
Well, it seems that I committed the cardinal sin this week of directing my
energy into a tricky subject and trying to expose a mindset that is pretty
much the dominant view leftover in each of us - the mindset that excludes
most of humanity when we talk about US. And refer to THEM. Lets say I
jumped in on the thing that probably bugs me and you the most - that
although we say a whole lot of positive stuff, we still act and think in
negative ways. In my opinion, WE are the SYSTEM, and how we THINK is how
the SYSTEM thinks. So when we see all those terrible things in the news,
and find it hard to work out why in this of all possible worlds, we have a
world in which PROP 187 exists, all we have to do is look at our selves.

It's like we have inherited a way of thinking that results in genocide. -
It seems hard to believe, but this is what I was trying to uncover in the
heart of SFRAVERs - the thing which  lurks in the hearts of us all, and
which we need to rid ourselves of in a conscious way.

Well, despite my good intentions, all I did was  recieve a lot of flack. I
suppose It might have been better to at least establish first that things
are wrong - I might know that things are drastically wrong with the way
society works, and that includes rave, but perhaps SFRAVERS have'nt worked
that one out yet.

*So  by way of apology for all the noise, here what I've learnt on sfraves
in the past week*

1. A Grab Bag of Goodwill. Its OK to bring up the occassional hip societal
problem - like S314, Digital Telephony or anger at police  brutality, but
by an large third world or environmental  problems don't quite make it.

2. Don't Taint this Baby:  Consensus is that RAVE itself should not be
tainted by any discussion which might link IT to a broad philosophy which
explains why we have a society  in which Newt Gingrich, S314, Prop 187,
Native American Segregation & Third World Genocide exists.

3.  NO opinions not Musical: Its OK to lecture or have strong opinions on
MUSIC, what style I like, what riff, what breakbeat, my version of a
particular historical thing. But its not OK to have strong opinions abouth
SOCIETY. So if I talk  strongly about Trance, no one will accuse me of
lecturing or being rude. If I talk strongly about the PLANET I open myself
to immediate flamage.

4. IT's all STYLE: SF Rave is more about STYLE than CONTENT. So again,
passion OUT, coolness IN. It's OK to talk about the night, who did what
where and when, but no talk about actually DOING something to help the
Planet.

5. Problem what problem? Again, Its OK to complain about a police bust, but
its not OK to begin drawing conclusions that there might be an outside
chance that RAVE is being specifically targeted by the authorities.

6. America is GREAT. By and large, sfravers are patriots, proud about what
this country has achieved. While they might be upset about a pet gripe,
mention  a topic that they discounted years ago - like the native american
situation and you face the ultimate flamage for being an unAmerican
outsider.

7. Raving Community is Positive: In spite of all its flaws, raving is
without a doubt - the biggest turn on to community the world has seen.
Sfravers are committed to doing community, even if its in a virtual, not
everyday thing. Its what connects all of us at base level even when we're
flaming.

Well, folks its a beautiful day, what else can I say? Its been quite a
trip, and hope we get to blast this thread into unprecedented levels of
soul searching postivity.

- David Dei

How do you feel about dark or harsh imagery at raves? I'm referring to the 
Frazer comment about banning the ugly from Megatripolis and trying to 
flush it up with your confrontational approach.

Monicat,
you don't think the same problems exist in NYC as far as finding rave venues
go? Boy, are you mistaken. It is extremely difficult here. It is extremely
difficult all over the country.
It seems our gov't has a serious boner for requlating and restricting our
movement, brothers and sisters.
do any of you have any suggestions as to how we can protect ourselves
(besides the obvious - less drug use, tagging, no gang bangers, peaceful
events, etc. I think we need to find a way to gain a strong political voice
(a RAVING caravan to washington?).
I'm an east coast promotor with about 4 years in the scene. i've been
eavesdropping on your list for about a month.
Hello one and all. peace and love to everyone.

Dear SF Ravers

Well, after much soul searching, lots of miss-connection, flamage, hard
opinion back and forth, anger, frustration, namecalling - that has left me
feeling emotionally drained & confused at where things really stand on
sfraves. I have this to say.

It is clear, that there are at least one or two individuals, like larry
ching, who care enough about this virtual community to take the effort to
understand and offer positive  suggestions. I am quite sorry for causing
such a high level of dissenssion in what is usually a serene and
enlightened community.  All I truly want is for us all to be able to see
eye to eye, to examine the hard and the soft things in life. What I will do
for the benefit of all is take a break from posting on SFraves for at least
the next couple of days so that things can achieve a little perspective.

A word to JOSH who is justifiably feeling hurt  after receiving my rude but
right remark - I never meant to hurt or blast you, rather I intended to
show the uncomfortable truth that we all share - that we all are found
wanting when it comes down to the nitty gritty - as the amount of rudeness
and  xenophobic shit a reaped in turn, has also demonstrated an
uncomfortable degree of intolerance  directed my way. Lets face it, even if
I was wrong, would this be the way to treat me?

Perhaps the medium is not conducive to what should really be a couple of
quick remarks, backed up by a whole lot of love. E-Mail is all too often a
cold instrument of mis-communication. A salvo is easily launched without
much thought to the matter or we Mis-Read  or even ignore or delete, as I
certainly did do on a number of occasions.

SO let me raise the banner of peace, and  announce, that I love you all in
spite of yourselves and in spite of all the anger. We are all growing and
evolving. And I have indeed learnt a lot from sfraves as I hope you will
learn at least something from me. I am not interested in one-upmanship or
winning and  competing. SO I forthwith throw my lot in with the Rave
Community for the mean time - I have no intention of standing out in the
cold forever, and as long as I am able to continue holding to my opinions,
I say this: LET US ALL CELEBRATE the FACT THAT WE HAVE MADE IT POSSIBLE TO
MEET HERE AT THE VERY LEAST. Perhaps we can hold some grand debate in the
flesh in the future
as larry suggests?

Point taken - my approach is indeed confrontational -which is not
necessesarily good or bad, its just how I evolved.
But I do recognise the need for a more zen inclusive approach to dialogue.
I tend to charge in to arguments and debates thinking that logic and facts
(like a  mr spock) will win the day. But then theres the illogical and the
irrational and  responses like yours - they are not intrisically better or
worse than my approach. Just different.

I am quite prepared to modify my approach - but I don't see how we get to
discuss the important things like the WHY, the HOW and the WHEN of saving
this planet?

Allen, you are welcome to give me pointers here - as I do sense that we
have at the very least a common love of rave.

I'm awfully tired of David Dei telling me how to run my life and how
I should behave and what I should think and what I should post to sfraves
and so on and on and on and on and on.

Go outside, David, it's springtime.  Smell the air, walk around.  It's
nice.  Leave your judgemental self behind, then come back and talk with

For the last week or so the sfraves list has experienced an unprecedented
upheaval.  I would like to remind everyone that there have been
disagreements
and intemperate postings from time to time in the past, and we have been
able to get past that.  sfraves has been the online contact point for many
people both in the Bay Area and, like me, from outside as well, from all
over the globe in fact.  We have always had a good balance of 
"local" and outside views, in my opinion.  We have almost always had
respect for each other's views, and have from time to time taken up the
larger issues of the world that intersect to some degree with the music
and the community represented here.  

Three individuals in the past week have chosen, for their own quite
different reasons, to push their own personal agendas on us here. 
Fraser Clark, David Dei and Tristan have all, quite deliberately it
seems, pressed various of our "hot buttons," and we've responded with
various degrees of *hot*.  

We have seen Fraser and David at work in the same manner on the Well for
some months now, but basically the response there has been to step aside
and let them do what they want.  Those who wish to pay attention, and 
those who do not skip over it or go elsewhere.  

There is nothing like being accused of being provincial in your own front
yard, especially where there is some truth to it.  But then, that is
always true.  If I were to go to London, as important as it may be in
the world dance music scene, I'm sure I could point out the many faults
in their scene as compared to, say, San Francisco.  But this is almost
beside the point.

The underlying issue is this: this list is what WE want it to be.  No one
person can decide how it will work, what should be discussed, or what the
tone of the conversation is.  Those are up to all of US.  We have been
blessedly free, for the most part, of people coming on the list and wanting
to reshape its purpose to their own designs.  I think that is what I object,
most of all, in the approach that Fraser, David and Tristan have made.
As I said before, they have completely different motivations, but all three
want to remake this list according to their desires, and not soon -- now.

Despite my own aggravation at all of this, and I have said sharp things both
in public and email, I think it is well time to move past this blockage in
our development.  Fraser, David and Tristan have no more and no less right
to participate here as anyone.  I would *welcome* -- I mean this totally --
their perspectives and their input, as long as it is offered in the spirit
of sharing rather than control.  

We make up the rules of cyberspace as we go along.  Nobody can really
*enforce* anything in an open-ended, asynchronous discussion like we have
on sfraves.  What *works* is to have a shared set of values about how
conversation should proceed.  To me, the one thing that works most of all
is to focus on issues, not personalities.  Otherwise we run the risk of
devolving into a turgid pit of self-righteousness which will drive people
off the list.  And they would be right to leave if that happened.

Many of us have helped nurture this online community through the last
several years.  We have a subject matter, there are some areas we've
learned that are related but cause severe distraction to the list.
Much of that history may not be apparent to newcomers.  This is a *human
communication* process, which means it doesn't work all that well and
sometimes takes a lot longer to get to an obvious point of resolution
than we would wish.  But if we are interested in helping save our species
and take care of this planet, we better be able to maintain a high level
of respect and understanding and forgiveness and love right here on this
little list, if for no other reason than to convince ourselves that we
*can* do it.  

I urge all of us to resign from the cycle of stimulus and response we've
developed in the last week.  I'm guilty of it too and I'm not gonna do
it no more.  This is my last posting on these general subjects (for at
least a while I hope!)

I don't think anyone here has bad intentions or hidden agendas.  We should
however respect and learn from our different perspectives and experiences,
because without that we can't grow.

see you in the future

Is this why there's been such a humungious amount of Sfraves mail
I've been getting?   Or is this my imagination...

Or is it because it must be raining constantly,  and nobody is going 
out because of all the flooding?

David & Fraser, I realy suggest that you guys spend a good amount of time
reading through the archives (everything thats ever been posted on sfr). You
guys realy haven't been here that long enough to know & already have very
strong opinions & ideas about sfraves and the scene in general. The
archives are filled with 3 years worth of discusion on the scene & related
subjects which you guys seem to be highly interested in. If you guys realy
want to do something for the SF scene, I think it is neccesary for you to
research it first. There is no way for you to *know* about our scene, it
has been through so many changes. Please understand that alot of people
have been here *along* time & are going to feel insulted when somebody who
hasn't been here long tells them what this scene/list is/should-be about. I
suggest everybody who hasn't to read them as well. It's easy find with a
www browser, go to hyperreal.com and you should be able to find them.

p.s. If you start from the beginning & go all the way through, your work
will have been well worth it.

Dear SF-Ravers,

Since we had a most glorious day here in Sacramento I took it upon
myself(with the aid of two friends) to do some special activity. After
roller blading in Capitol park for about 2 hours under a glorious
mid-day sun, we headed toward the river banks.

We went to watch everyone enjoy the sun. It's a great thing to do(wacth
others enjoy something that is free for all).Don't worry I'm getting
somewhere. We saw a large litter pile at the end of the beach. When we
got closer we noticed there were more of these piles farther down. I
decided to inform the park ranger, and asked if we could help. The ranger
gave us a smile that is probably still stuck to his face. As we cleaned
up two piles, about ten others joined in helping us. It was a great
feeling I had knowing I didn't even have to ask for their help. I once
again have restored faith for humanity. I just hope next time there will
be no garbage!

Mike, If this post was directed to me here is my answer.

This answer is very low tone because you brought up a big point about
statistics. Because I never asked any Sysop the ratio of black/whites.
In my post replying to Kieper I said "I(meening me personally) know as
many blacks..... as I do pale skins." this means I never bothered to
ask. So I did!

Here in Sacramento We have over 40 active bbs. I decided to target only
the ones with at least Internet E-mail(some had better access). You, as
well as I, would be suprised by the answers.

bbs inquired------12
bbs answered------7
total for all of those answering
%whites-----------32
%african american-21
%latin american---6
%asian------------27
%eastern indian---14


these are not scientific or 100% accurate. they were simply internet
replies to a simple question. also note that i had no way of contacting
the local unversity and other places like AOL and Prodigy but I will
attempt to contact the admin.

This is helping me realize some things as well.

KEEP THE PEACE! KEEP ON SMILING!

act. Please relay the address so I and maybe others can write.

Also legislature is trying to lift the 1990 law protecting the mountian
lion from being hunted. I don't know about the rest of you but my favorite
animals are cats. BIG AND SMALL.

Hello sfravers, 

	First I want to say that finally it has been sunny and 
beautiful for two straight days!!!! Second I wanted to know if anyone 
who read the post about the Headwaters Forest actions has any additional 
information they can send me. I don't know very much about this 
subject, but I feel it is truely important! I called the number numerous 
times, but they never answer the phone. I keep leaving messages...

	Anyhow, appearently a company Maxxam has gotten permishion to 
start logging in the Headwaters forest and there is going to be a 
non-violent rally on tuesday, march 28. The group "Earth First" is 
putting that together and they stated, they need support. Their phone 
number is (707) 468-1660. Please call and try to get as much info as you 
can about this. It is very important that we make a stand and protect 
our forests!!! I don't remember the location of the forest, but I seem 
to remember it being really close. 

	I think we all need to give our support to the Earth First 
organization, no matter what it we can give. Money, phone calls to the 
Governor, or just our presence at the rally!!! Please participate...

	Their number once again is (707) 468-1660!!!!! Call!!!!!!

Peace, love and harmony to all,

Greg Sandler

ps. Can somebody please foward me the original message from Earth First? 
Thanx!!!!!! We all need to work together in harmony to solve this 
problem! And remember, always respect your mother EARTH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Peace

RESEND

Dear All;

	Once again my provider is having mail problems, so if you receive 
this more than twice just delete the others, thanks and sorry. Please 
send any complaints to sysop@liberty.com.

B. DARKNESS

Dear All;

	I been in this kinda emotional funk latey, and I didn't get out of
it until I heard this song. The song is called Goddess by Soho, off the
Goddess CD. Once you sucessfully get all the lyrics off the CD, not an
easy task even with an EQ and headphones. As you read them I realized 
that the song was basically an affirmation written primarially for womyn.

	Music for me has always been a great refuge and shelter, and its 
funny that when I'm down, whether it's on the radio, or me picking up one 
of my 150 CD's, I seem to always get the message I need. So I wanted to 
share it with you all. 

	It's a great song, off a great CD, but unfortunely came out 1990 
when main stream radio was just starting to play alterative stuff. Their 
big hit "Hippy Chick" did actually get a lot of air play, but they seemed 
to have forgotten about the rest of the CD.

	I'm not a musican, but the rhythm tracks of the songs that weren't
considered "hits" are definately programmed and very techno like, so check it
out. If I could digitized the song into a reasonable 16 bit Stereo format
file size I would send it along with it, but with an SB16, that file would
be huge. 

	I believe in the Goddess concept, I believe that to varing degrees
there is a Goddess alive and well in us all, including we men. So when the
message in the song reached my brain in just clicked. Hope you find this
affirmation useful, I did, and after all the negativity on this list as of
late I think its very appropriate. The lyrics follow: 

(text) = denotes my changes to the affirmation so it fit me, make any 
changes necessary so that it fits you, the song is really cool
[text] = denotes helpful notes

GODDESS by Soho

You are of female(male) gender, are you not? [male voice asking the ?]
That is correct
Ah, ah, ah .....
[whispered names of people/stuff, most unregonizible]
I lay my heart on the line
I've had enough
Big girls(boys) don't cry, cry; why why ... ??? [sampled and warped line 
						from the orginal Motown hit]

I am housewife(massage therapist)
I am bad, [in the positive sense meaning strong, a force to be reckoned with]
I am midwife(engineer)
I am yours
I am flame
I am love
I am confident, I've had enough

Refrain, repeat 8x
Got to be a Goddess

I am whole
I am sore
I am for choices, I was born
I am short(tall)
I am wide(thin)
Now I am free and I claim my life

Refrain, repeat 8x
Got to be a Goddess

I refuse to be like the rest
These womyn(men) in their straight dress(suits)
Their life is just a beauty(sports) contest
I am not like that and don't you forget it

Refrain, repeat 8x
Got to be a Goddess

as lary ching explained:  megatripolis is supposed to be a landing venue
in the future perfect state where we can practise how it would be to *be*
there.(for one evening a week max.) sfraves is here, in the present
"*real*" world which we clearly have to deal with in order to get to the
FPS in the first (last?) place.  >:-) fraser PS I dropped in ameba, as I
was passing on my way to visit r.u sirius today, with the idea of
listening to the cumming up yer ass track - but then didn't feel like
asking for "ameba". OR "the cumming up yer ass tape" (I may sound loud
sometimes but I'm often quite a shy retiring kinda guy) 
who do I ask for?  when are you there?  or what's the name of the track if
they have it there?

Larry>The other concert is Hawkind ( the Dave Brock version of the band ) ,
 playing at Slim's on Tuesday,  April 25th. 
Hawkwind has been doing more ambient/techno stuff
in their recent work , which I like , although I've been a fan of
theirs since the late 70's , when they did more space rock/trippy grunge
stuff. 

   In the early 70's, Hawkwind created the first electric tribal trance music
on 
their album "In Search of Space" (1971 I think).  In some ways, they are the
British Grateful Dead....

To the SFRaves list , but especially to all the folks involved in this
weekend's flame-fest:

 Remeber that there will be a whole bunch of folks who will be logging 
on and reading their SFRaves email for the first time since Friday.
This is because many folks only have email access at their workplace.
They may make replies and generate email to you in response to posts
that have already been worked over by you and the other weekend 
warriors . It's common for some folks to reacte to something at the top
of their email pile before they've read everything.

 I say this because some of the folks involved may still be newcomers
to the give-and-take of this email medium of communication.

CND (Campaign For Nuclear Disarmament), mixed by Mixmaster Morris.  12 
tracks by 12 different UK house bands.  ahem, the last track is by me and

good point, larry, and thanks for pointing this out.
I'll remind david he's sworn off answering anyway for 2 days.  and I - 
well, I'd like to point out to the 3 people who've lumped me in with this 
xenophobia thread that in fact I don't think I've said a single word on it.

oh, and while I'm writing to you, larry, thanks huuuuggellly for your 
wisdom over these last few days.  and thanks for the positive things 
you've said about zippydom.  but couldn't you add the definition of zippy 
itself to your list of megatripolis and pronoia?

zippy - someone who, realising an imbalance between the Tecnoperson and 
the Hippy hemispheres in hir own brain and on hir planet, is acting to 
harmonise them once more.  (NOTE: "acting to" - NOT achieved it - 
nobody's done that yet, it's merely a dirrection.)

is that a useful focus we could all agree on?

CAREFUL BEFORE YOU ANSWER.  being, as is well established over here, 
the pushy kind of guy I am [>:-)] I'm likely to follow up an 
affirmative from you with TWO more!  fraser

It was once said by either Dan Quayle or Pat Buchanan that a 
Conservative is anyone who cares for the well-being of their
family and community, and because of this,  most people in this
country are at heart, political Conservatives, whether 
they refer to themselves as one or not.

I think you'll find that a lot of people don't like to be labelled.  Like
stereotyping, it oversimplifies who we are; which can be insulting.  You'd
be surprised at how many people here do not even refer to themselves
as "ravers".

Stompy was happening quite large @ 171 King street this weekend.  An all
Chicago affair featuring Mark Farina (happy birthday my man!), DJ, and the
unstoppable Derrick Carter.  All I can say is the shit was PHAT!

I didn't get to hear Mark Farina, since I went to the show at about 1:00.
I did get a chance to hear Diz & Derrick.  I am AMWAYS happy to see talent
come from other places to SF.  Why?  Because with all thaty SF has to offer
in terms of music, it seems at times that we really just barely penetrate
the surfeace of any musical genre.  Yeah, we got trance, jungle, some
house, tribal, italian, etc. but I have RARELY heard DJ's , especially
nowadays, really work the music, much less work a crowd.  It's refreshing
to see people from outta town come here and give SF a taste of what it must
be like elsewhere.

Well to say the least SF still has a way to go in many respects.  And the
afforementioned three DJ's showed how true that paradigm is.  They FUCKED
IT UP!!!!

For those people who've been in a debate about the diversity of SF rave
scene, I only have one word....PRESTON.  Preston, of all the mf's who throw
parties here, has in my estimation THE most mixed crowd!  There were PLENTY
of people of ALL persuasions, colors, sexual types, you name it!  P-Dog has
consistently been able to attract a wide variety of folx to his events.  To
get a taste of what SF used to be like, diversity wise, consider a Stompy
event sometime....anyway back to the music....Diz dropped some serious
grooves that got people moving.  SF, not being used to DJ's with such a
deep house sense, took a while to warm up to Diz's set.  But you could see,
in a very short time, that people were gettin' the message.  The MIXING
was, by any account, the smoothest I have heard, EVER at any event I've
been to in California.  Mark Farina's rep. as a smooth mixer
notwithstanding, Diz & Derrick mixed flawless sets.  They also WORKED the
mix.  They made the music move in ways seldom heard at events.  Very
physical sets, and of course, HIGH on emotional content.  Diz got the crowd
moving, but by then then last record went on and....

You heard a voice over the PA: "Just wanna say happy birthday to my friend
Mark Farina on his 26th.  Happy birthday!  Awright, now I'm gonna play
something a little funky! Have a good time!"  And you knew then that it was
none other than Derrick Carter.  To say that he put motherfuckers in
another dimension would be understatement.  Between his mix, selection of
records, and general style, he had every person in there yelling and
screaming for more.  All be told, a 4.5 hour set.  PROPER!!!  He played
shit, for the most part that you'd be hard pressed to find (esp.
considering many of the cuts were first pressings, and test pressings), he
really did a number on folx. He did some backspinning shit, TO THE BEAT,
and then went right into another mix in seconds!  He was cueued up and
ready for the next record in SECONDS.  And get this, no horses, or
trainwrecks!  Truly a pro! Derrick made me trip out from just the music.
There was really no need for drugs of any kind, the music did it all!  I
had to leave early since I had too much to do the next day.  I walked as
slowly as possible to catch any beat that might happen to follow me out the
door. All I can say at this point is that Chicago is my next stop.

DJ's:  I have been thoroughly impressed with the brothas who have mastered
the decks.  Looking back on the past year, the best party IMO, was Wicked
with Pierre.  This year, it will be quite hard to top Stompy for sheer
music madness.  DJ's in SF should take note, and see how it's done.  Any
doubt that house music at one time was/is the domain of brotha's/sistah's
should check out some of the Af. Am. talent that is responsible for the
continuation of a great musical tradition.  Nobody does it better....

JSL's dream team '95:  Mark Farina, Derrick Carter, Pierre, Jeno, & Markie.
4 hours each. 3 tt's, with a tag team duel between Mark & Derrick vs Jeno &
Markie, with Pierre freelancing between teams.  SICK!!!!!

Audi 5,
John

I really want to say that an Earth First fund raising rave is quite do-able.My 
uncles property in Willits has been the site of both fund raising event and 
welcome to Darrel and Judy after the car bombing and the site for the small 
rave called Penelopes Web. They very much want to do another rave as soon 
as they can figure out a way to have Liability insurance, (and the weather 
warms up). I am Hoping Ethan and Bryce or somebody as 
confidence-inspiring will offer to be the promotor-organizer for such an 
event. I do not have the time at this point to do it alone. So to get things 
started- "any insurance brokers out there willing to write a two-day policy on 
an entire mountain"?

Jesus. 

I am not by any standard rich, nor have i been ever, yet i have had 
full net access for the past 5 *years* and i haven't paid a *cent* for it.

The above, frankly, is serious bullshit. You're talking out your 'arse', 
'mate'.

Yeah- that brick sailed right past my friends head... What was up with that- 
people can be so screwed up sometimes-

"Television could facilitate the spread of delusions and conspiracy theories 
in the 90s. The mere fact that the eye is engaged in television implies that 
it should be satisfied by some sort of action. Abstractions, by their nature, 
are not visible. By re-asserting the primacy of the visual, television drowns 
out abstract concepts." (William Rees-Mogg, writing in his book "The Great
Reckoning")

Last night I went to the Jungle party at Stevenson warehouse and after
sipping 
on a fourty and sucking on a balloon a brick flew by me and hit a DJ so I got 
in my car (minus car stereo) and went home.

went surfing with nick phillip this morning -- I'll be posting my celebrity 
surfing report now and again.

I must say this was annoying from guess who: " all I ask is that you
accept this - that I am not trying to sell anything that Blake or Shelley
did not."     Have you ever read Invisible Man by Ralph Ellisson? My vote for 
you David Dei is that you try 4 posts a day to this list 2 screens full 
maximum. And If this does not work try lurking. You asked.

Are you referring to "white" African-Americans or "black"
African-Americans?

How do you know if they are African, or that they want to be
associated with Africa?

Inquiring minds want to know...

This is fact not opinion.  But aren't are facts merely opnions that are

I just saw the post for sunset starting this Sunday.  Is there going to 
be an info number for location?  I'd be coming all the way from 
Sacramento for this and would want to make sure I could find it first.  
Thanks...........

Hello beautiful people,

	To make this quick, I read Sig's post about coming to harmony 
and having everyone sign the document that she is sending to the 
Governor. I think that is a great idea and I was talking to "Earth 
First" about this,( getting more info, writing letters, and donating 
money.) They said that we should do everything we can to bring this out 
(public), and that most importantly we all need to be at the rally on 
tuesday!!
	I got some info on that: Tuesday, mach 28th @ 10:00am. There 
will be a legal, non-violent rally at the Headwaters Forest. the phone 
number is (707) 468-1660. Directions to the rally (you might want to 
call first, cause I suck at relaying directions!!):

	Take 101 north to highway 36. Take highway 36 east to Fisher. 
Turn left on Fisher. Go two miles and your there!!!!! You will see lots 
of people and signs, (your basic protesting material!)

	That might be kinda far for some of you but please understand, 
that if you don't drive up to Headwaters this time to help it, you might 
not get to drive up to Headwaters at all... Protect our mother earth!!!

	I also wanted to say that if you are coming to Harmony and you 
feel like donating extra money to this assosiation please do. We will be 
collecting donations for Earth First at the door. I have arranged this 
with them personally. Also I am not sure yet, but Harmony will hopefully 
be donating 100% of it's profits, (if we actually have any!) to the 
Earth First assosiation. I have not worked that out with everyone 
involved in Harmony. Please understand there are many people involved 
and it has to be a group decision. But I know we will donate a big 
percentage, (I don't know how much yet! Hopefully 100%!!!) 

Protect our mother,

Shroomy

Could you give us some kind of idea how long a drive you are talking about?
It looks like it's 3/4 of the way to Oregon, and most of that isn't freeway.

In regard to this whole zippie thing, which I haven't really followed, if
their idea is to fix the world bit by bit, then they're going about it all
wrong.
Our world is one huge connected system which basically cannot be looked at as
independent parts.  Everything has to be fixed basically all at the same
time, but who knows how that is possible.
The movie Mind Walk does an excellent job of explaining this.

Hey guys, next month will be the first time we know there is definatley
not going to be a FMR by wicked, they will be on tour. Remember all that
talk a couple months back, this would be the best opurtunity to do one. I
realy don't think it would be viable to not have an SF FMR in such nice
weather :)

Or you could head to Portland on the 15th where Wicked is going to be and 
experience the full moon with a whole different crowd! :)  I've heard the 
the guys from wicked travel with quite a contingent - is this true?  Will 
any of you be among them?

Some of us may find this interesting,
I sorta know the guy and he's pretty sincere, definitely a (hacker/geek)
I guess people call them geeks now (good hackers) When I was young :)
Hacker was a term that you were prowd to bear.
But any way...

This is a a project of someone from the last SELP that I just finished
coaching.  Geoff he was in your advanced course.  I though you would be
interested in what he was up to.  D

Subject: ART/TECH Society Survey

This survey is going out to all the people worldwide who responded to my 
posting about the Art/Tech idea group forming in California and the 
potential of a newsletter.  Here's a reprint for those of you who didn't 
see the original posting:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

I'm organizing a weekly meeting of people interested in the collision 
between art and technology and what can come of it.  Engineers, artists, 
philosophers, and futurists, whether professional or amateur, are 
invited.  The first meeting will be held in Scotts Valley, California, 
but subsequent meetings may be happening anywhere in Santa Cruz or Santa 
Clara counties depending on where interested people are concentrated.

The meeting will be a place to try out ideas, get technical and artistic 
advice, and collaborate.  We'll make up the rules as we go along.

Even if you're out of the area, contact me if you're interested.  An 
electronic or paper newsletter is likely.

I'm a twelve year veteran engineer with a broad background.  I studied 
physics at Cal, designed servo drives as an electrical engineer, and 
have in recent years been creating applications for Windows and the 
Macintosh.  Seven months ago, I decided I didn't have to choose between 
being a geek and being related to people, that I could express myself 
artistically using technology and automation itself as my medium.  Thus 
my particular form of geek art was born.

Have you noticed that all these labor saving devices we surround 
ourselves with don't really seem to save labor?  Despite endless 
marketing and herculean engineering, it seems pretty obvious that 
gadgets don't equate with a better life.

The challenge and the promise of the art I'm proposing is to break the 
vicious cycle of gadgetry for gadgetry's sake.  The cell phones and 
faxes and VCRs that surround us today are like a noise that sucks our 
energy into figuring it out enough to survive another day.  Not good or 
bad, but a distracting noise.  What I'm proposing is that we completely 
alter our relationship to technology by inventing music from that 
unfocused noise.

Art expressed in the way things work.  A future where technology is 
shaped artfully to be in tune with humanity and nature.  A future where 
humanity sees this harmony as a birthright.

Hope to hear from you.

-- RM.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

In my on-line discussions with many of you, the newsletter became a very 
definite reality.  The first issue will happen March 1 and will contain 
people's shared information (see below), the results of the survey 
below, meeting times for the Santa Cruz / Santa Clara county areas and 
perhaps other areas, and maybe even some articles.

Many other great ideas arose that I want to run by all of you and invite 
you to participate in.  They are mentioned in the survey below, but 
aren't by any means a complete list.  Please add your ideas and comments 
at the bottom of the survey.

Below the survey, I've included another copy filled out by me so that 
you can know where I'm coming from better.  (Also, it might clear up 
confusion if at some point I've given bad directions in the survey.)

Thanks again to all of you for responding and sharing your great ideas 
and advice with me.  Let's keep it going.  Here's to the future!

-- Robert.

My statement:
I'm a beginning artist whose medium is technology and automation.  I 
decided to become an artist eight months ago after twelve years of being 
an engineer.

I know a few cool things about: software design, analog and digital 
electronic (circuit) design, motion control & robotics, and physics.

I want to learn: how to draw and use color more effectively, and 
animation.

I want advice on: how to express my ideas and the possibilities I see 
for the world, both through my art and through the written word.

Hello All,

    I was wondering, does anyone know where the Wicked parties/FMR are going
to be in Portland?  And if so, how will they be promoted etc.  I have some
friends up North who I think would really enjoy the full moon experience.
After attending last months Full Moon, I'd feel kind of like I was sending
my friends a wonderfull gift if I could let them know where to look and what
to look for.
    On the home front I'd love to see SFravers put something together to
fill the gap Wicked will be leaving next month.  Hello snd thanks to all the
beautifull people who made it out to last months FMR you all helped to make
it the best party I've ever attended.  It was a truly psychotomimetic
experience...

                                       Peace, Love and Happiness,
                                                                 RMD

how about a benefit/protest against or celebration of the Headlands (where
they're going to cut down the trees) the proceeds to be a downpayment to
buy the place or something.  I bet if we took it on the most unfashionable
time of the week we could fill the place and improve the image of ravers
nationally. we could have speakers all afternoon and smoke petitions - I
mean sign - and the lot 

just a thought at 4.30 in the morning.  fraser.

here's the last of the catalogued artefacts from the CHEMICA SUTRA
EXPEDITION into the future perfect state, the Parallel University's first 
playshop of the spring term.  these are the actual staements of the
three other partygoers that cathy chose to interview in the wee small
hours. 

though we'd actually hoped to present something a bit more like a research
report on the event, the truth is pretty much everybody got a tad too
dreamy sipping PROSEXPLUS, the new prosexual smart drink that was included
in the ticket. this *was* a book rave launch, after all, to celebrate the
launch of the new Book BETTER SEX THROGH CHEMISTRY - A GUIDE TO THE NEW
PROSEXUAL DRAUGS which Timothy Leary has hailed as "probably the first
chapter in the chemical Karma Sutra for the next millennium." 

we promise to get it more worked out at the next one. April 21st (clashing
with Organic, but then this Parallel University event, the CHEMICA SUTRA
TECNOEROTIC EXPEDITION PARTY, can only accomodate 100 people maximum
anyway, and probably half of *them* are not yet ravers)


SFRAVERS DAN AND WILL, FOLLOWED BY JEAN FROM MISSOURI

DAN: if I had to choose *one* thing about tonight's party I'd have to say
the location.  we've never been to a place like this before, just an
amazing trip place.  

WILL:  for me the topper has to be the people, I mean this was a *people*
party.  and like a good rave on the dance floor there was all this high
energy and face to face eye-contact dancing.  but I have to agree this
place is the visual equivalent of what Edgar Allen Poe did.  I'd describe
the energy as high consciousness.  there was a lot of real talk about
things that we enjoy, ranging from Dan Joy's Better Sex Through Chemistry
thing, and that was just the springboard.  you know, for me the real party
is a people party where you have real contact with people and this was
superb in that way. 

DAN:  I feel the same.  I met a lot of nice people.  I caught most of
DanUs speech and it was interesting, I watched the belly dancer, the
tantric dancer, I was out on that floor for hours. 

WILL:  Paul Q is a great DJ.  and Lucy was different, but I'm
also a reader so the one thing that's going to prove it all for me is I
bought the book, and I'm going to read it and find out.  these are all
learning tools, whether they are nutrients or drugs or disciplines,
theyUre things we can practise to ...  grow. 

DAN:  I only tried one drink the nurse was handing out.  I felt a litle
warm, okay, nothing incredibly virile or anything.  but my trip went
really well with the sex drinks.  really good for socialising. 

JEAN;  Oh oh, it was wonderful, the lights, the rhythm, I really feel it
very deeply.  when IUm dancing I feel like a woman.  plus the freedom, it
seemed like a really free place to meet people and share.  a very eclectic
group in the extreme, in pretty bizarre surroundings, I was out on that
floor for hours.  totally great way to get to know each other more deeply. 
it was super. the one thing I'll take away from my first visit to the
Parallel University is that we're all experimenting with life in one way
or the other.  you could say new highs but it's new ways of *being* more
than anything.

Geez, twist my arm why dontcha :) Sure, I'll happily volunteer for this;
seems plenty of us here might wanna get involved, yes?

4th of July anyone? Seems like we talked about this after Freedom last
year, Brian B, remember that? ;-)

Short term, special event liability insurance is available.. if I recall
correctly, it runs about $350 per $1x10^6...

As an aside, I actually know Dave Foreman (EF founder) we should make sure
and invite him, though we might wanna downplay any promo of the EF tie-in;
we might get attacked by chainsaw wielding, redwood chopping, plaid-clad,
red neck, gangstas, goddess forbid...

Dear Sfraves;

	Peter Wilsons office gave a friend some BS about not being on the 
Internet. We all would really like to know what the e-mail addresses are 
of the people in our goverment, who has em, who doesn't. I thing in 
should be a requirement for all public officals to be computer literiate 
enough to do e-mail. just me 2 censt but we still needed.

	While doing a Lycos search I got an e-mail address for a Governor 
Peter Wilson at peterwilson@delphi.com. the site would allow me to do a 
finger a verify the address and I can't log on as a guest. I seriourly 
dought the accuratcy of this address due to it being a commerical site, 
and I don't thing Petey would be that stupid. Anyone cn help we needem

Peace & Love

seriously, as far as pop music since the 60's, england has kicked ass.

but let's not forget that most great classical compositions from the
  18th century came from the continent; classical is still the basis
    for much of what we call "progressive" or "art" rock, as well as
      many other pop styles.

also, india's ragas, which are at least 1000 years old, have been
  incredibly influential of late, and are IN NO WAY themselves
    influenced by anything english, since they don't use the same
      scale intonations.

not to mention latin-american and carribean styles, which come from
  african and indigenous rythyms; they've got 1/5 of the world's 
    population boogying to a non-english type of music (reggae
     partially excluded due to London influence)

and then theres pure asian styles, korean, japanese, chinese, indonesian,
  etc., which are no where near western styles, either in use of
    instruments, tempo, vocals, etc.

hey, anglo-philes, get out there (like george harrison did) and
  LISTEN TO MORE DIFFERENT MUSIC!!!

UPDATED REQUEST

Dear Sfraves;

	Peter Wilsons office gave a friend some BS about not being on the 
Internet. We all would really like to know what the e-mail addresses are 
of the people in our goverment, who has em, who doesn't. I thing in 
should be a requirement for all public officals to be computer literiate 
enough to do e-mail. just me 2 censt but we still needed.

	While doing a Lycos search I got an e-mail address for a Governor 
Peter Wilson at peterwilson@delphi.com. the site would allow me to do a 
finger a verify the address and I can't log on as a guest. I seriourly 
dought the accuratcy of this address due to it being a commerical site, 
and I don't thing Petey would be that stupid. Anyone cn help we needem


We would like the following persons e-mail address and or fax numbers:

Grey Davis, Lt. Governor California
Scott Pierson, Fish & Wildlife, ? Federal Government
Bruce Babbitt, Department of the Interior, Federal Government
Barbara Boxer, Congress Person, Federal Government

and anyone else who would have jurisdicsion over forest type issues.

Peace & Love
B. Darkness

Greetings fellow cybertribers and SF Ravers!

My name is Mike, and I'm a student at Columbia University all the way 
over in New York City.  And when I'm not a student, I'm living in New 
York City too...
I love the big apple, but I need to get a break; to get some 
perspective.  This summer I'm planning to live in San Francisco (along 
with a large contingent of other east coasters, btw..be warned :)) I have 
alot of friends who live in the bay, and seeing their pictures and 
hearing their stories is not enough...I want to live it and breathe it, 
explore the west coast, go hiking in the mountains and hills.

The only problem is finding a place to live.  I'm a rookie at locating 
housing for myself, because I usually just live at home or at school.  
I'm very scared of going to San Fran and not finding anywhere to live, 
and end up living on the street or something.  I'm pretty sure it will 
never quite come to that, but I would be much more relaxed and excited 
about going to the coast if I had some kind of reasonable assurance of a 
place to stay.
THIS IS WHERE YOU COME IN (there's always some kind of catch...)  If you 
need a roomate, someone to sublet, or know of any kind of room opening up 
in the city (preferably san fran, because thats where I'm applying for 
jobs) PLEASE LET ME KNOW.  I am a great roomate, having went through a 
year of hell at school...I always clean up fro myself, am good with the 
rent, etc. I am looking for something cheap tho...hopefully not too much 
more than  400 a month.  I'd really love to room with a SF native too... 
someone who could intropduce me to people and show me the town.
Or if you know of any alternatives to housing- co-ops, hostels, dorms, 
etc. please pass stuff on to me. 
If you'd like to talk more, please write back at mg162@columbia.edu, or 
call me at 212-853-4800.  I really hope things work out for the summer, 
because I can't wait to feel the SF vibe, and add my own brand of 
east-coast vibeism to it.  
In any case, I can't wait till May hits....just being on this list for a 
few days has already gotten me so siked up for the summer.  Help me make 
my dream a pleasant reality! 
Peace and talk to you all later...

Dear Sfraves;

	I called Pete Wilson's presidential election commitee, and also 
faxed his office with my opinion on the Headwaters issue. I suggest 
calling his presidential election committee people at 1-916-564-1996, and 
or faxing his office directly at 1-916-445-4633 and voice your opinion 
about the Headwaters issue, make sureyou tell them your not going to vote 
for a candiate that will cut down forests in his own state, also that you 
won't vote for a presidential candiate that isn't computer literiate and 
not on the internet. Yes, Petey'soffice is not saying anything about 
whther or not he even has one on his desk, how do we let these people get 
in office. I recommend calling his election campain people, they will 
lite a fire under his butt quicker that a fax will.

Peace & Love
Brian Darkness

Hey brian.  I just called that first number, and they referred me to the
Governor's Office.  The number for there is 1-916-445-1445.  His fax is
1-916-445-4633, like you said.  They also gave me the mail address, which
is:

        "Honorable" Governor Wilson
        State Capital
        Sacramento, CA 95814

When I called that number, a guy picked, and listened to all I had to say
in a very friendly manner.  He also tried to explain to me the reasons for
the Headwater Forest thing.  He said that they were going to cut down dead
trees for some lame reason.  I also complained about his newest policies
regarding the endangered species act, to which the gentleman replied by
saying it was to aid farmers in Watsonville to get their farms up again
after floods.  I didn't agree with a word he said, and told him so.  I said
that the ecosystem of our state is way more fragile than Wilson is treating
it.  He needs to take another look at his policies.

PLEASE, I encourage everyone to  call this number, or fax, or at least mail
Wilson!  Our voices do count!  Just remind him, like Brian said, that you
will not vote for such a pompous ass(but in nicer terms).  I am now living
in Connecticut, but I still called, because I believe in saving our
beautiful state!  I encourage everyone to go to Harmony and donate money to
Earth First, or to go out to rallies demonstrating against these lame laws.
But make sure to call.  A phone call takes but a few minutes of your time.
It well worth the effort.

Oh, and the person who answered the phone said that Wilson does not and
will not have an email address for a while longer.  He cites security
problems as the reason, and says that there have been breaches of other
people's accounts.  Once they can elininate the threat of violoations to
security, he will get an email address.  That should be within the next ten
or twenty years.

Save our state, save our planet.

Love,

>From the San Jose Mercury under the State News in Brief, thier's an article about the Headwaters Forrest.  Headline is AGREEMENT BARS LOGGING ON 8,000 ACRES.
It basically says that Environmentalists and the company in question, Pacific Lumber Co. have come to a temporary agreement concerning the Headwaters Forest.  It's a 30-day agreement that should block logging until a judge can figure out whether Pacific Lumber must file a timber harvesting plan.  So far, state officials have accepted the companies plan to use dead, dying and diseased trees in two North Coast tracts, but environmental groups that those trees are important 
also.

Just thought I'd pass the information on to all of you since their seemed to
be interest concerning this issue.

Actually although there is a good deal of great music coming out of brittan
overall I still prefer much the continent has to offer. In the 70's
the space music from Germany for example:  Tangerine Dream, Ashra, 
Von Deyen, Kraftwerk then groups from France such as Heldon and lately
I've been hearing another great round of stuff from Germany and the
various dutch and scandanavian musicians produce some stuff that is often
lesser known but tastey....

Anyone who says brittan has it all is being far too provincial ( and
restrictive ) for my personal taste. But then I prefer much that brittan
produces over M Jackson and Madonna fur sur!

I shaved my head!

Hey, what else is an SF Raver to do in the desert?  I mean, I had already
spent the better part of the day soaking in the natural hot springs,
eating, drinking, smoking, and hunting for cool rocks, so the mood struck
me to shave my head and I acted on it.  Feel free to rub it next time we
dance near each other.

But this band-width usage isn't about just me, or my head, it's about a
lone raver's experience in a non-raver's world...

The third night in the desert was the craziest.  Whenever you get 22 people
together partaking in outdoor activities, wherein every decision is part of
a collective, it's hard to come to agreements that please the whole all the
time.  (You know the adage, I shant repeat it.)  Dinners were pretty much
planned; tubbing, drinking, smoking, and dosing were up to the individual
-- I partook amply in the first three and declined the last reluctantly.
As for music, the dividing lines ran as deep as the gourges in the
beautiful Inyo Mountain range that we stared upon for hours.  The
atmosphere is so relaxed though, that it wasn't as if there were huge
debates going on over the music.  (Which I wish was the case here, but of
the 286 posts that I got to review today, a vast majority were snide
bickering about a lot of non-rave related bullshit.  Fraser if you've made
it this far, maybe you could consolidate your thoughts, and keep your posts
to, um, say, like five a day?  I mean if I see that little ad for
Megatripolis again, I just may scream....)

Anyway, I never made a big deal about not getting to crank up some of the
nice tapes I had brought to dance to; it just wouldn't have been
appropriate to complain.  I had to be resourceful, and I had to take
whatever I could when it was offered.  The moment came at about ten o'clock
Saturday night...

The sky was fucking huge.  I mean just so full of stars you could truly get
a "feel" for the three dimensional aspect of the solar system.  The
constelations took on new meaning with the clarity of their outline
(Orion's bow was especially nice to see again).  I realized it was my time
to act.  Most people were sitting around the fire, and no one seemed to
care when the tape of whoknowswhat ended.  I had to choose something that
would appeal to 21 non-ravers, so I grabbed the worn and wonderful Orb's
Adventures Beyond the Ultra World.  Now, I don't want to start a massive
thread about whether or not The Orb is "Techno" music, but under the
circustances, it was closer to techno than, say, Janes Addiction.  The
trucks were parked in a semi circle, and I snuck around to the non-fire
side and rolled down the window.  I was alone and quickly ran around to
tell a few people who I thought might want to share the experience, but no
one responded when I whispered "There's a rave going on on the other side
of the cars.  Sssshhhh."  Wink wink.  They probably thought I was tripping
or something, but I wasn't.

THIS IS WHERE YOU COME IN!!

I ran back to the other side of the cars and for a moment I felt alone.
Well, I mean, I *was* alone, but I felt lonely, and we all know there's a
difference between being alone and being lonely.  Here I was with a bald
head and more stars staring down on me than you could shake your ass at.
But I will tell you this my friends, when Little Fluffy Clouds came on and
I sank my teeth into that drug we call music, I thought so hard of you that
I could fairly see you dancing with me.  Let me point out again I was not
on hallucinogens, but just really really happy to take 45 minutes to dance
and sing and look at the stars and think about all the friends and family
I've encountered in the past year.  My feeling of being lonely was
assuaged, my feet were moving fast, the stars were shining, I had this big
fucking grin on my face and wonderful thoughts of you in my head,  and when
it was all over I sat down near the fire and grinned like lovers that had
just run off and had a quickie without anyone knowing.

The point of this story is this:  The scene is what *YOU* make it.  Someone
will have the best time of their life at the rave you had the worst; and
vice versa.  People may come into our scene and tell us that it's wrong, or
that it can be done better, or that it can be an enormous global movement.
Well, I for one don't know if I want that, because before it gets that far
it will be turned into a fucking circus, a marketing wet dream -- a lost
dream.  This isn't about getting bigger in attendance, it's about getting
bigger within yourself.

All kinds of people will sniff at our scene, but only those that are honest
about why they are there will stay long enough to make an impact.  Only
those that get the shiver of chills when they walk down the stairs at some
new venue and first hear the thump, thump, thump...and turn to the stranger
with a beaming face next to them and grab their hand and yell gleefully
"This is going to be a great party!!" will care to stay on board.  You
can't dish out the kind of love we are trying to spread with a firehose, it
must be hand fed one drop at a time.  I say we do not attempt to lambaste
the people with our movement, but let them discover individually the
treasure we have hidden and that we pull out every weekend for heat, and
love, and life.  It's not about who's doing it better, nor who's doing it
bigger, but that we are doing it at all.

And it's about being alone under the desert stars and having the littlest
rave possible -- A rave of one with the love and spirit of one thousand.
Thank you for sharing it with me; I could hardly wait to tell you about it.

Tony

P.S.  My suggestion for the name of our summer of raving?  I like:  Nothing
Mediaworthy to See Here.

I'm keeping tabs on the Portland Wicked events for the weekend of April 15.
The local organizers are friends of mine and I think they will put on a
high quality event, as well as helping find a suitable spot for an outdoor
get-together on Sunday (assuming it's not pouring rain).

This is one time my sfraves posse takes a backseat in my plans.  It's

Look; I've been living here for two years and have yet to hear a decent 
American piece of techno.  England, on the other hand mainly because 
this is where the best composer that the techno as a music has ever know 
- ie Richard H.Kirk - lives and work's.  Just check out any of the last 
three "Caberet Voltaire Albums, or the last three Sandos albums, or the 
first three Orb albums.  Their simply is no comparison between this 
music and anything that has come out of America in the last three years.  
The same can be said, with the exception of The Red Hot Chilli Pepper's, 
about rock music as well.
Face it: weather one likes it or not Britain, artisticly, has pretty much 
always been at the forefront in the world.  Pro-portionatly, we have made 
more fundamental discoveries, made and developed more kinds of music 
down the ages, written the greatest and most important books, then all 
the other countries of the world put together.  America is just a mere 
babe in her mother's arm's by comparison.
Yours Tristan.

Refreshing to see some affirmation on the list.  thank you Brian Darkness.  I 
had forgoten about that album so I broke it out and listened to it while I 
read your post.  Very nice.

I thought I would share with the list my own favorite life affirming song.  
The song is called "Love and Anger" by Kate Bush off her album The Sensual 
World.  It's a beautiful triumphant piece with a solid rythm track at about 
128 bpm.  I allways think it would sound so hot dropped in at the end of an 
uplifting proggressive house set.  If I can ever find it on vinyl I'm gonna do 
just that.

I think that alot of the anger expressed on this list lately is stems from the 
feeling of helplessness about how fucked up the world around us has become.  
And I think if we recognize it as that, we can change it.   
Enough said.  Check out the lyrics.

Love and Anger   by Kate Bush

It lay there, it lay deep inside me.
it's so deep i don't think that I can Speak about it.
It could take me all my life,
But it would only take a moment to tell you what i'm thinking
But I don't know if I'm ready yet
You come walking into this room like you're walking into my arms
What would I do without you?

Take away the love and The anger 
And a little piece of hope holding us together
Looking for a moment that will never happen
Living in the gap between past and future
Take away the stone and the timber
And a little piece of rope won't hold it together

If you can't tell your sister
If you can't tell your priest
'Coz it's so deep you don't think that you can Speak about it to anyone...
Can you tell it to your heart?
Can you find it in your heart to let go of these feelings
Like a bell to a southerly wind
We could be like two strings beating 
speaking in sympathy
What would we do without you?
Two strings speak in sympathy.

Take away the love and the anger
And a little piece of hope holding us together
Looking for a moment that will never happen
Living in the gap between past and future
Take away the stone and the timber
And a little piece of rope won't hold it together.

We're building a house of the future together     <--- yes we are :) :)
What would we do without you?                     <--- yes ALL of you. :) :)
Well' if it's so deep you don't think that you can speak about it
Just remember to reach out and touch the past and the future.
Well, if it's so deep you don't think you can speak about it.
Don't ever think that you can't change the past and the future!!!   :)
You might not think so now.
But just you wait and see - someone will come to help you.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Love to all of you.
See Ya

I know upstairs at F&F their was a *LOT* of english music played, a 
*LOT*, and just last week you were saying that the music at F&F was the 
weakest you had heard in a while.  You said the music sucked.  Just 
wanted to point out your inconsistency.  couldn't help it =)

        I started putting the Headwaters Logging Alert on the WWW.  You can
get to the pages thru http://gladstone.uoregon.edu/~drenalin/knowledge.html
Part of our goal as the Cloud Factory is to help spread info  so if you
have something you think we might be able to put up send it to us
(drenalin@gladstone.uoregon.edu) and we will get it on the WWW.  If their
are any volunteers we need a sample letter to governor Wilson about the
Headwaters issue.  Our focus is to make it *easy* for people to do
something about what is happening now, for instance just saving a letter
and then printing it and signing it and mailing it...not too hard.  We are
also starting a list of pertinent addresses for people to contact please
send any addresses of nonprofit activist groups or politicians or anyone
that people need to know how to get in touch with and we'll try to organize
it coherently.

love drenalin

glad to read your story, tony.  it made me smile!

i had a similar experience in glaciar national park when i was making my 
way across country to move here.  we had just straight up from sounthern 
utah, had run out of gas at the continental divide, and had had maybe an 
hour of sleep.  after setting up camp at glaciar, we thought, aw hell, 
let's drive thru the park.  OH MY GODDESS!  words cannot express the awe 
and excitement i felt so close to the sky, staring at evergreen woods and 
waterfalls ... it truly was a sacred place.  in this state of rapture, i 
started hearing musick in my head from a tape by dante - jazzy, very 
celebratory, slightly melancholy.  i just smiled and smiled with my mouth 
hanging open.  

the next day we were driving thru the park again, and we stopped at a 
bridge and waterfall for a bit.  my friend wandered around, while i took 
out our cassette player and brought it with the dante tape (and a plastic 
sheet to protect it from the light mist) to the bridge, where i danced 
and danced, not alone but in the presence of the ancestors and forest 
spirits.  i believe i probably called the four powers (four elements - 
earth, air, fire, water) as well.

when i finished and walked back to the car, my friend looked at me and 
said, nicely, "you're crazy."  i smiled and thought, "yup, glad to be 
this way."

so thank you, tony, for bringing me to that memory (i feel all excited 
inside right now just thinking about it!)

take care,
monicat

At least you didn't go for the throat by mentioning the words "WHAM" or 
"Bros.".

Anyway, even if England doesn't rule the music world, at least the rule

Hey folx...

I am back in town for Spring Break and really really want to hit Wicked this
Saturday, but unfortunately I am only a mere lad of 19. Is Wicked going to
continue in its (uncool) tradition of throwing 21+ parties? Does anyone know
anything about the party? I would really like to go, have been partying to
the Wicked DJ's for two and a half years, and miss the scene....

If anyone knows the answers to these questions and more, please let me
know... any other suggestions for good parties?

thanx...

Matt.

I have a friend on delphi, I will ask him to do a user search. Also I
found out that all government officials address end with .gov. I think
it might be WILSON@california.gov   not to sure though. If some one has
WWW they should be able to go to @california.gov someone please do.

Ah, but Simon, you *can't* blame us (at least not initially) for the
Bee Gees.  That, erm, honor belongs to that *other* former colony 
"diwn endah."  :-)

All this blather about the UK having the greatest music bar none is just
silly.  New Orleans, Kinshasa and Rio could make equally strong claims to
London in their own way.  

But the *real* point is, this is the era when a techno musician from Detroit
can blend ideas from the local scene plus Chicago, New York, LA, SF, 
Kingston, Warsaw, Melbourne, Maracaibo, Yogyakarta, Stockholm and loads
of places we've never ever heard of, produce the raw tracks in Germany,
do the mixdown in London, final production in Rotterdam, and release it
on an Italian label with cross-licensing to one in Scotland that is
then released by a subsidiary of a Belgian distributor using a wholesaler
in New York selling it to people from London living in San Francisco at
a store run by someone who used to live in Houston.  And then listened to
by people of every complexion, gender, political belief, height, handedness
and length of time since they last talked to their mum and yah know what?

It sounds like music every single time.

see you in the future

I have been watching this thread  and made one minor comment.Though I 
have been vexed at some of the rather inane comments made I had decided 
to stay out of the conversation cuz I simply don't have time for such things 
and I'm generally not into flaming. However the recent ignorant and 
racist comments by Tristan have compelled me to respond. This is an 
unabashed flame against Tristan. You are a pompous ass!

-Tristan "Face it: whether one likes it or not Britain ,artistically, has 
pretty much always been at the forefront in the world. Proportionately, 
we have made more fundamental discoveries, made and developed more kinds 
of music down the ages, written the greatest & most important books then 
all the other countries in the world put together."

This is total crap. Don't forget Britain was one of the founders of the 
Industrial Revolution which has polluted the Earth and are the premier 
example of the horrors of colonialism. (Oh yes you were slave traders too).
I've lived in Britain and there is plenty of racism and a variety of 
other social ills. There are also some beautiful people and great artists 
(like all other cultures). Music wise British rock and roll was a rip off 
of African-American blues, British house & techno would be nowhere 
without Detroit & Chicago and the Orb would be nowhere without Dub (again 
a primarily black musical genre).

Get your head out of your ass you self absorbed bore.

Yours,

I vote this is the highest finest thing I've heard here on sfraves in the
admittedly short time I've been hanging out here with my loud friends. eq
has hit the button.  you *do* have to fix it all at once, not in bits, and
if you're basically trying to fix everything at the same time then what
you're actually doing is trying to correct the fault in *every* piece and
that's why zippies are always getting into hot water. 
 
I'd say zippies (and I didn't invent zippies, you know, I just spotted a 
new emerging cultural meme which I could describe (and have described, in 
many ways.  for example the zippy type is beyond political corectness - 
which is exactly the way of trying to sort the world out bit by bit. 
zippies in increasing numbers throughout the "West", products of the 
cultural end times in which they live, just *know* that that way will 
*never* work in time.

a zippy type would say, maybe, for each of course has hir own bouquet of 
intersts and priorities, natutrally, "I'm about saving the fuckin planet, 
mate, *then* I'll think about sorting things out like giving up smoking."  
or giving up swearing when we've worked out the planet.  OK?".  or maybe 
even washing.  or going out to look for a job. or talking politely, heh!  
>;-)

(good liberal parent types might be able to tolerate up to this point,
but no further.  because the next steps are too logical and uncomfortable
for them to handle.  if the only historically sane way is to fix all the
bits at the same time, then there is no point in getting involved in
anyone particular political action.  indeed whzat we mean by "political
action"  becomes a wste of the zippy's energy because s&he *knows* that
s&he must find a *much* more *political* way - there is no time for
anything less. 

I think the best, fstest and least painful way (and most political
strategy) is to encourage the growh of a new "youth meme" and help to
spread it and make it fashionbale globally.  RC (Rave Culture) is already 
doing it, now it's just verblaising the actual aims.  hence zippy - 
trying to balance hir tecno and hippy hemispheres and the hemispheres of 
hir planet.

I'm saying that's how an increasing number of young aware people are 
starting to see things, though they may not quite have put it in those 
terms to themselves. the last thing I'll say for now is really dangerous 
stuff to say with "get every bit right" types listening but here goes. 

I often find when I talk to the younger raver types that, if you ask them
why they rave, they often can 't tell you much.  but, if you say, do you
think it's about dancing yourself free of cultural conditioning, or into a
shamanic state THEN THEY'RE ABLE to see it and verbalise it. 

"nuff for now.

respect bro, I know you're one of the head honchos around here.
on your first good point I'd respond that we're now at a point (I'd say 
not just approaching it in a decade or two or even half way through but 
even near the end of any real chance to do something about it) wehre 
being "conserve-ative" of your community now means acting globally. 
 and with all speed.  republicans, indeed, are about the only americans I
see who give any sign of being alarmed by the state of the out-of-control
system.  they're *almost" to my point of view that it's the sytem itself
that is our only problem. this could be a long long thread, Isuppose. 
here's one more thought on iut. 

on the labelling, stereotyping point:  language is nothing but labelling. 
language itself is simplifying an indescribable process so we can tak
about it. I think american culture (to use two extremely oversimplified 
words to avoid making it personal) is very ready for a new, positive, 
idealistic and determined almost reckless youthquake heavenbent on 
balancing their own inner life and at the same time sorting out their 
planet *all at once* (as elm tree put it).
the "label" zippy is merely a word to try to talk about this new type.  
(and also, yes, to try to influence it to some extent) and it can help to 
spread such a meme faster.
and, as I've said:  speed is of the essence IMHO

  All that is needed is for everyone to be aware all the time of the Love
that always exists in their heart.

  This doesn't happen because we are mentally conditioned to do otherwise, to
be concerned with "problems".

  For example, imagine if the policeman who is called out to a rave site, was
aware of Love.  Imagine the same for the     mayor, for the person
interviewing a person of another race for a job, etc. etc.   Would any
problems still exist?

  Therefore, as the fraggles say "Accentuate the positive".  And, as the
Beatles said, "All you need is Love".

  respect to all,

Thanks for the positive thought, but other than being one of many 
hyperreal archive maintainers, I have as much real authority in this

So are you saying that part of your mission here in San Francisco is to 
help us think more like Republicans?   I would never have guessed.

> they're *almost" to my point of view that it's the sytem itself
> that is our only problem. 

This is where I think our differences are.  It is my belief that the 
"system" is merely a symptom of the collective state of human nature.  
What's important about raving in all this talk about global change is that 
the rave experience can often bring a positive awareness to this basic
nature as well as help teach us to transcend the limitations of our 
human-ness altogether.

While I'm all in favor of people getting involved with trying to influence 
the system itself, I see the role of raving mainly as a promoter of
individual mental and spiritual health.  If Rave(tm) becomes a 
sociopolitical movement engaging itself with the world's obvious problems, 
then it will become part of the current system which is structured to 
incorporate and absorb such forces, no matter how progressive or 
revolutionary they may seem.

I would guess that most people on SFRaves (even the nonRepublicans :) agree 
with you that the system is pretty fucked up.  But a lot of us want to 
preserve raving as an experience that runs deeper and purer - more to the 
heart of who/what we are.  Hopefully, enlightenment at a such fundamental 
level, as vague and abstract as that might be, will eventually lead to more 
tangible advancements in the overall human condition.

you mite wonder why environmentalists want the lumber co to stay away from
  dead or dying trees in the forest; well, there are several reasons:

  1: large dead hollow trees which are still standing make excellent
       nesting sites for hawks, eagles, and owls

  2: fallen trees, as they start to decay, become "nurse logs", which
       actually provide the mulch from which young trees start and flourish.

  3: removing a large log from an old growth forest is usually done
       by dragging it out with chains.  this can do severe damage to the
         root structure of the surrounding forest, and can even kill
           adjacent oldgrowth trees

I think more people need to take Larry's suggestion
because it seems fairly obvious that 
Tristan is just slagging US music 
to be a sarcastic contrast against his statements
about the SF rave culture lacking racial diversity

As has been pointed out, most of the good music that has 
come out of Britain has just been a bunch of 
White boys from the UK re-working things
that were invented by Black Americans
(americans = people from North or South America, not just the US)

(the major exception to this were people who 
took stuff from the Ramones, like the Clash or the Sex Pistols
but i would never put the Sex Pistols in the "good music" category
and the Clash also stole from reggae)

so i think that Tristan is just trying to point out the
fact that we all need to be more aware of our musical
history and notice how much we owe to african-american culture
for the music that it has provided to us

This is a really important thing.  As part of a culture that
isn't the "main" culture of the U.S., we don't have 
people who are going to put us in High School history books.
We need to make sure that we keep track of our history ourselves,
spreading it Orally (well.. Electronically)... saving fliers,
saving zines, saving sfraves archives.  These are our history books.

I really can't stress how important i think it is to learn
the history of this or any culture that one is a part of.
Recently, i've just been seeing in so many ways how 
the knowledge of the history of a culture can be an incredible benefit.

Anyhow... just wanted to thank Tristan for bringing the point out,
although i would probably reccommend not being so obtuse next time...
you know how us Yanks just don't get sarcasm :)

you mite wonder why environmentalists want the lumber co to stay away from
  dead or dying trees in the forest; well, there are several reasons:

  1: large dead hollow trees which are still standing make excellent
       nesting sites for hawks, eagles, and owls

  2: fallen trees, as they start to decay, become "nurse logs", which
       actually provide the mulch from which young trees start and flourish.

  3: removing a large log from an old growth forest is usually done
       by dragging it out with chains.  this can do severe damage to the
         root structure of the surrounding forest, and can even kill
           adjacent oldgrowth trees

Ok, I don't wan't to add to the whole UK debate, but I am distressed that
the idea of "who came first" seems to be a dramatic subject.

The issue of "who came first" in music is absurd.  All music comes from     
somewhere, although sometimes the references are more blatant than others.

Maybe I'm wrong, but the tone of this seemed to imply that nobody else
should do an April FMR, but help them instead. It was not mentioned that
they will not be doing their party on the full moon, but when they get
back. Hopefully nobody will be discouraged that Wicked are doin' one & there
will be 2 free parties near the full moon this month.

This is an interesting rumor.  However, DO NOT CALL 985-5244.  That is
MY voice mail line, which is occasionally used for F&F.

David Dei, dear heart, what has possessed you to inflict yet another
interesting, important but essentially off-subject topic on sfraves?

Don't fight me on this one, pal.  I have you covered any way you turn.
I co-wrote and steered through the Oregon Legislature in 1989 the law
requiring the Oregon Department of Energy to produce a detailed study
of global climate change and its effects on our state, plus a commitment
to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to the levels set by the 1988 Toronto
conference.  Oregon so far is the only state to have gone to such lengths
to deal with the global climate change issue, and that well in advance of
the Rio conference and subsequent developments.

Therefore, I think my credentials are in order to make the following
suggestion.

And let me say it again: this topic, as you've posed it, is not directly
germane to sfraves, plus it appears to have been a reposting of a
copyrighted news story (also a no-no under the Berne Convention and
netiquette).

It would be perfectly appropriate, in my view, to post that you are
interested in discussing political, cultural, social and environmental
issues of concern to ravers and invite us to join a separate mailing
list to do so.  I hope you do that instead of continually inflicting
your agenda on us as if we were so many errant schoolchildren.

Sincerely yours,
phred

I have appreciated the racism thread as it added to the punch of the Bell 
Hooks book I've been reading.Her main point I think is 'to talk about racism 
when you talk about sexism and don't leave out the context of a white 
supremist capitalist patriarchy'.  However, and I think this could relate to 
Lee's post, That dancing and having group altered consciousness experience 
are very political in and of themselves .I think having ecstatic experiences can 
contribute to your person in a way that allows you in return to be able to 
affect things in a positive way. The problem with beating people in the head 
with statistics and then accusing them of being in denial is that your personal 
Pain hampers the positive effect your good intentions might have had.
Correct me if I'm wrong but has your experience as a South African given 
you insight into race issues globally? Personal healing is also part of the rave 
experience.

that's certainly a fancy combination I'd like to see

	Haven't there been a few similar big  parties here past few 
years?  (With live bands too, and reggae)  one near Hunter's Point summer 
93- kind of like Lollapalooza, but with more hip-hop and jazz, and big dj 
lineups and tents?
	Or jungle "the U.K.'s first _indigenous_ black dance music scene" now 
sprouting here, how will it play out in clubs?
Or around 3 or 5 years ago, the Woopy Ball- lots of house, techno djs, and 
soul and reggae and bands, several wharehouses, "underground" promoters
	(i missed it unfortunately, but i wonder it  they went off, what kind of 
vibes and crowds gathered, as opposed to less eclectic  parties 
or narrower "purist" events, or ones with just djs, records and happy 
tweaking dancers that is dance culture rather than more egos on stage)
  
	 Even with these considered, your points still stand, those were forced,
 not as natural as some other places happily eclectic/united youth culture?
	I don't mean to tweak a dead thread though, just wanted to say 
well, somebody could make such a club here and see what happens...and 
that whatever the freaking categories or songs does the love or feeling 
shine through....
(sappy ending, cheers)

While I'm all in favor of people getting involved with trying to influence 
the system itself, I see the role of raving mainly as a promoter of
individual mental and spiritual health.  If Rave(tm) becomes a 
sociopolitical movement engaging itself with the world's obvious problems, 
then it will become part of the current system which is structured to 
incorporate and absorb such forces, no matter how progressive or 
revolutionary they may seem.

I partially agree - I don't think sociopolitics would inevitably and 
unavoidably dilute rave. It is _the_ major concern when you start trying 
to evaulate rave in terms of politics, though.

For point of reference, consider the dadaist stuff, Artaud and Breton. They 
make our local Zippie friends look polite. Endearing statements like "All 
writing is pigshit!" In trying to bring about revolution through art, they 
tried to create an anti-aesthetic so vile and destructive that "the 
system" of their day would choke trying to absorb it. Nowadays, we use 
"avant garde" to describe automobile interiors.

Sorry about the late reply -- i was off-continent (not incontinent) for
the last 2 weeks, and I'm still not "home"....

Anyways, I'm wondering if insurance is really necessary. Why not, along
with the ticket sales, force each person attending to sign a liability
waiver (prolly need ID to ensure validity)? Skip insurance entirely --
it's a scam and we shouldn't be giving any more money to the holders of
our economic-slavery shackles than we have to. People should learn to
take responsibility for themselves and their own stupid actions, even
when "fucked up"... Treat partying like a consensual act -- you're
there of your own volition and if you're worried about consequences,
don't go.

Either that or I completely misunderstood, and the point of 
"insuring the whole mountain" is to be sure that a band of marauding
gangstas with jackhammers doesn't chisel away at the mountain in
a meth-inspired labor of anti-sysiphus...

If you care about socio-politics and you care about raving, the two should
not be lumped together, IMHO. It's clear, even if only from the last few weeks
on this list, that there's people coming from alot of different directions 
that are into this. Why alienate them with an ideology?

Many people involved in all sorts of great political concerns wouldn't be 
caught dead at a rave, either. That's not to say that stuff shouldn't be
brought up on the list. It doesn't strike me that any of the political
issues brought up in the last week are really out of place. We just can't 
get to the point where one person is saying to another "How can you call 
yourself a raver if you don't support xyz?". You get the idea... but as Lee 
pointed out earlier, many of us don't want to be called ravers anyway... :) 

I think people here know what they're doing and doing it well! (Not to suggest
that you meant otherwise) The main political concern should be to fight 
anything that restricts access to spaces (indoor or out) for parties. 
That's number one. But then this raises the issue of above vs. underground...

Let me just do a slight edit on your last 2 lines, lee,  and we might be in 
FULL agreement.

"Hopefully enlightenment at such a fundamental level .. will lead to 
.. tangible advancements in the overall human existence."

I'm in total agreement with that statement.  Our only dispute will be in 
the time frame which I think is *indredibly* short

the situation which you describe in the line I edited out "as vague and
abstract as that might be" is *exactly* the one I'm trying to adress.  for
notice that you say yourself that the enlightenment that RC can offer is
at a "fundamental" level; there's nothing in fact abstract about it at
all, it's *fundmaental*, it's *real*, it's *accumulating* in a lot of
people and *spreading* at warp speed.  it's just "vaguely"  understood. 

and I'm much more optimistic than you about its spread. this is no shallow
fashion and one of the greatest strengths within RC that I've noticed is
that everywhere it breaks out the local population actually believes
*their* scene is just the best and purest.  I think that's great!  

and even more importantly, nonstop shamanic drun dancing is one of the
most ancient and powerful *technologies* for personal and social change. 
from Elvis NOT swinging *his* hips on tv in the '50s, to millions of
people swinging *their* hips and every other pzrt in the '90s..  the
changes RC brings about are so "fundamental" that the packaging is
*relatively* unimportant

this is absolutely amazing stuff but is it true?  are you a lawyer, 
niels, are there otherlawyers out there?  is there not a law against 
getting every one atending to sign a liability waiver.  almost too good 
to be true.  in fact I'd guess that it's only here in the good ol' USof A 
that such personal freedom and repsonsibility would still be available - 
if it is.  fraser.

it's not an ideology, though.  it's more like being touched at such a 
fundamental level by the experience of RC tends to make people redouble 
any efforts they were already making towards helping save their planet.  
there's no idology in this, it's being touched in a higher emotional 
centre.

I disagree with that.  the social area we're trying to work in now very 
definitely involves bringing ofther ages and social scenes into RC.  the 
book launch for tim leary's new book.  the chemica sutra. you can 
surround the dancefloor, as long as *that's* kicking, with many many 
different "ambiances".  and that's how RC can infiltrate the overground 
culture.

This is really easy in the Bay Area, where there are lots of India stores,
especially in Berkeley, Fremont and Santa Clara
(I think there are some in S.F. as well - on Mission?).

India music cassettes are *really* cheap $1.99 to $3.49 - ie you can get 5 or
more, for the cost of one DJ tape. :-)

A good place to go is Shrimati's on the east end of University in Berkeley
(somewhere in the last few blocks before UC, on the north side of the
street).  They have a great selection and the dude there is helpful and
knowledgable.

Besides "classical" India music you can also get "Bhangra" (from the UK)
which combines traditional India folk music with techno/hip-hop.  "Kamlee
Rave" by Amarjit Sidhu is a good place to start with Bhangra music.

Hello everyone,

	This is Greg from Harmony. I just heard some really bizarre 
news!!!!!!! Apparently there is someone out there who has taken it upon 
him/herself to throw an "after-party" for "Harmony". While I greatly 
apprieciate it, I would have liked being talked to about this. (For the 
following reason...)

	There is going to be an after-party put on by the Cloud Factory, 
and info for that will be given at Harmony, and or on the Harmony voice 
mail, when the party is over. Harmony is ending at five am., then Cloud 
Factory begins a.s.a.p.!!!!!!! Just in time to catch the sunrise!!!! It 
will be in the Santa Cruz area, so you don't need to drive to far. 

	Anyways, I just want to make sure that there is no confusion 
among us, about which party is actually the "after-party." Cloud Factory 
are the people doing it, (weather permiting.) 408.486.9591

Peace, love and harmony to all,

Shroomy

Ps. I want to say sorry for lagging soooooo hard on the mailers, we have 
been really, really busy!!!!!!!! Something coming soon!!!!!!! :)

There is a world wide web site for the Congress, but I don't remember it
right now.  It has the addresses of all congressmen.  I wrote to Norm
Mintea once, asking his opinion on Prop 187.  I received an automated
message back immediately, thanking me for writing.  The message stated that
he would not write back through email due to security problems.  All
correspondence from that point on would be done through mail, if I had
included an address.  So I mailed my address and my letter once more.  It's
been over four weeks and I still haven't received a response.

I'll try and find that site tonight and post it, so that people can have
the email addresses at their disposal.

Peace and Love,

Although Wicked will/may be doing a Full Moon party, I hope it does NOT
de-rail the plans of others on the list or elsewhere from attempting to do
the same.  There is plenty of room for more than one posse to throw a FM
party.

So if you want to attend the Wicked crew's party, go ahead.

If you want to start your OWN party, go ahead.

The sky's the limit, and there needs to be more than one place to go when
the moon is pumped anyway.

Peace,
John

P.S.  There will also be plenty of parties to go to this weekend as well.
I just hope NONE of them get busted (especially those ug events held in
not-so-legal places).  Good luck partying this weekend!  And be safe!

When only the glories of the past can make one proud of one's country 
what other form of debate can I take?  Don't forget, not everyone is 
lucky enough to come from a country where the 2nd World War is talked 
about as a distant memory and Nam is seen to have been a silly mistake.  
The US has no sense of history; any that it did had was abrieviated in 
the pledge of alliegence.  Here if some thing is a year old it is all 
ready out of date.
We gave life to the modern world and the modern world, like weed killer, 
polouted everything it germinated and scattered it's seeds of pollution 
through out the modern world.  And it was those seeds that planted the 
US, Germany and Japan.

last time I moved the sound system up that stream-bed we came that close

Might also reduce the risk of busts. If more of us are doing outdoor 
parties, two things might happen.

	-	The "Authorities" start getting used to the idea of our 
		parties. Perhaps to the point where tolerance is more 
		common than not.

Is this Kevin talking out his ass now, because it surely smells like
Tristan bullshit.  What does this have to do with San Francsico
Raving???!!!!!  The only thing I like about seeing mail from Kevin Keiper
is that I can delete it immediately without worry that I might be missing
something important.  (Every once in a while I check to see what kind of
crap is being spewed, i.e., below.)

I do believe, brothers and sisters, that we must revert to the age-old
childhood stalwart of shame: THE SILENT TREATMENT!

See you Sat. night

Tony

P.S.  Isn't it funny that Tristan and Fraser have never addressed one
another via SFR?  I smell a Conspiracy a-Go-Go!

Dear phred

I'm not sure whether to be outraged that you consider saving the planet
from destruction an "interesting, important but essentially off-subject
topic" or puzzled at this clear display of denial that things are wrong,
backed up your "I have you covered any way you turn" attitude after which
you recite the Berne Convention on me?

Free your mind and your planet might follow.

David Dei

PS Since when is saving the planet NOT a rave issue? Or was all that shit
just for decoration? Do other ravers agree on this?

 Even if there is a "conspiracy" , only messages to SFRAVES subscribers
are the result. Which messages are easy to skip , as you've pointed out.
And , some more sophisticated folks know how to "refuse" email from 
certain individuals so that any email from those individuals never
gets into the mailbox.
 I made a personal vow to myself quite some time ago that I'd never
create such a "kill" file - haven't needed it yet. ( Been tempted ...)

( My opinions - your philosophical mileage may vary )

Hello all SF resident ravers!

My employer sends me to SF next week, which I do not mind at all.
Having peeked a little into hyperreal.com it seems the SF scene is
almost of European dimension (techno-wise).

Can anybody enlight me where one has to go in SF in the time frame of
3rd April to 9th April without having missed anything? 

Is there any SF record labels ans shops that sell VINYL based stuff that is 
worth acquiring? (Anything from Breakbeat to Hardtrance)

Any concerts? Any bistros, coffee shops, etc. where the ravers use to 
hang out? Any popular chill-out or after-hours places with a REAL breakfast?

And does anyone know whether there is a techno scene in Las Vegas (I 
don't think so) as it have to go there afterwards(NAB)?

Thanks in advance for any reply.

Carlos

Since when is saving the planet a rave issue?  How is it that you seem to 
be dictating the rave and non-rave issues?  It seems that if an issue 
falls within David Dei's agenda, then it *is* a rave issue.  That is 
wrong and...prejudiced, David.

There most likely exist some people who enjoy going to raves who are not 
concerned with saving the planet--perhaps even on this list.  You are 
subtley dealing in hypocrisy by forcing your agenda on us here and 
denouncing those who see its irrelevance.

Please contact the sysadmins at best.com for help with creating your own 
newsgroup or mailing list or similar forum.  David, what you persist in 
doing is an internet crime of sorts--your access can be suspended if 
someone complains to those at best.com.

There are people both in and out of raving who would like to discuss 
those issues that interest you.  Create your own discussion group and 
then publicly invite them to join.

	Sami

Personally, i DO think that sfraves should talk about politics
and talk about how raving fits within the world,
but i would not necesarily agree that any topic
should be thrown in at any time.

I think that the topic needs to fit within a relation to 
stuff going on in SF.  That is, yes, the extermination of
whales is a bad thing, information on it is really nice,
and i DO think that killing off all the whales will affect
us as humans and therefore affect us as ravers,
BUT it doesn't really have anything to do with
rave culture in SF other than through abstraction.

Maybe if you wanted to get a Green Peace like expedition going
and we could hold a couple year long rave on a boat
that would try to stop whale hunters... well post away...
but other than that...

Or, i think the issue of race and raving is an important one
to deal with as it is somethign that, well.. has to do with raving.
Or race and online access is important in figuring out
why which types of peopel are going to be on sfraves.

just some thoughts

Agreed. Its definitely in the Doing that we live our lives, although what I
would reccommend is a balance between walking and talking - as too much of
either one - too cerebral or too physical  - would represent imbalance.

But the record will speak, on Fraser's part I find his well-publicised
(Newsweek) sneak-in of a soundsystem into the Kaibab National Forest,
particularly charming.

As for myself - I've had rubber bullets fired at me by South African Riot
Police, defied censorship laws, escaped a military draft, contravened
interracial mixing laws, published banned tracts and other inhuman laws too
numerous to mention, and even now find myself in contravention of a
particularly well publicised  law. ;-)

Which is not to say that I am recommend the breaking of law as such, but
rather the following of more fundemental and basic life-positive laws -
like the preservation of life  and love.

One thing I have learnt (although have much trouble practicing as seen in
the flame war last week), is this. A warrior choses his battles carefully.
There is no sense in commiting a suicidal act just to illustrate a point,
neither is anything won by standing up to a bullet. But, somewhere between
the zen of doing nothing and the yoga of doing something, we must make a
stand. Looking at all major battles in history, both social and political,
only those who dared to venture into the Territory of  RISK ever achieved
their goals.

PS So how do we save these Redwoods, as well as the Children, and a whole
host of things like our freedom to dance wherever the whim takes us? This
is what I hope sfravers will want to talk about and then when all the
talking is done, dance onwards into action.

	Hi Everyone,

I got some mail regardng my last post about going out this weekend so
I wanted to make some clarificatios as well as some other proposals
and info that might be useful.


NOTE:  There was some RUBBISH posted a few eeks back regardign 
Technics SL1200 MK2 decks.  They are curently avaialble at Uncle
Ralphs.  They are asking $425 or some other ridiculous price.  I paid
$399 for my pair.  And quoted the prices of Good Guys, & Whole Earth
acces (on Steven's Creek) as my source.  The Whole Earth Access on
Stevens Creek in Sunnyvale/Cupertino/San Jose (I hate this tri-county
south bay shit), quoted me $399 for the one in the box, and $359 for
the COMPLETELY unused floor model.  I called Sam Ash in NJ/NY (I hate
that dual-state east coast shit), and they quoted me a price of $439.
 They would NOT go down to $399.

As far as I am concerned, the prices of late are a rip-off.  It was
not 3 months ago when you could get decks for $375 at most places, so
me thinks that due to the demand, Technics has either rasied the
price to it's distributors, or there is serious price fixing goin on.
 In any case, these decks are FAR from being extinct.  Good luck on
the best deal!!!

=== 
First off, I know nothing about ny particualr busts that mry or
may not ocu this weekend, so don't let that deter you from going out.
 What IS going on is an internal investigation of the SFPD.  The SF
DA is also involved.  It seems as though there is a crackdown on the
cops for accepting $$$ from clubowners.  It also seems that the
clubowners got together and decided to stop paying the cops.  The
cops are pissed off and have been taking retaliatory ,measures
against most of the clubs in the area who have stopped paying them
off.  Expect increased enforcement at legal venues as well as
increased crackdowns on "non-permitted" events.  The cops in this
city have long been accepting $$$ from various local industries.  Now
that they've been outed, they are pissed off, and are BOUND to take
it out on someone.  Word to the wise, when/if the cops come to any
event, exit quietly, and quickly.  Most of all, don't antagonize them
by asking them ANY questions.  If asked any questions, answer them in
a respectful manner, lest you get bludgeoned like Rodney King.  I
know it shouldn't be this way, but it's better than waiting for YEARS
to collect $$$ from a lawsuit due to excessive force.  Just leave the
friggin party, and keep your catcalls to a minimum.  This too will
pass.

Get active politically in the effort to allow partying by folx who
are 18+.  18+ people can vote, and you can make a difference.  Get
motivated to change the curent SF climate.  You can make a
difference. 
++++

Wicked/FMM:  With all due respect to the Wicked posse.

I hope that NONE of you were intimidated by the posts from Markie &
outasite.  Yes, they are part of the FM posse, but so what?  They do
not own the full Moon, and are not the first ones to start throwing
events based upon a lunar cycle.  There NEEDS to be more than 1 event
thrown during these cycles, and the FMM posse shold not be the ONLY
people doing such events.  Here's why...

-It's easier to track/bust 1 FMM event than 2. -The attendance at the
most recent FMM's have been realtively small.  Probably due to
organizational problems, as well as what may be a change in the way
FMM's are done.  Could also be a change in the philosophy of the
parties from larger events to smaller more intimate ones. 
-The current FMM is sketchy at best and starts too late for most to
attend.  Probably due to crowd control.  There should be a
posse/group of folx who can have it more regularly and more bust
free.  All that's really required is some research, some local PR,
some heart, some equipment, good standing, keeping promises, and a
bit of luck thrown in for ood measure.  IT CAN BE DONE BY THOSE WITH
THE HEART TO DO IT! 
-FMM by the Wicked posse is OLD.  Time for some
new blood and some new ideas.  Maybe even some new people spinning?
:)  Diversity is all good.  A new FMM party with a differnet posse
open up whole new realm of possibilities. 
-There are plenty of people on this list with connections that
would allow some to have an FMM on privte land.  Yes, this wod
require some planning, heart, promises, etc. but it could be done. 
Why not use such conections to further the goals/intentions of people
on the list?

Just some ideas...I for one would go to such an event (I used to HATE
outdoor parties), if properly planned and executed.  If they started
earlier and were closer to home there woulds be greater opprtunity
for me and others to go out.  People in SF and the BAY area are
waiting, TRUST THAT!

++++

Plug/plug:  I'm supposed to be spinning at an event this Saturday,
along with some other guests.  I do NOT want the event posted on the
list, so if interested, drop me a line and I'll fill you in on the
details.

Word of mouth is BEST!  Fuck info lines!!!!

SF UG '95 - Let the tribes begin to gather!

Have a safe & happy weekend, John

P.S.  Sorry for the typos, but SimpleText sux.

peace out.

Hi, all!

I think getting people to sign a waiver is an excellent idea!
However, I'm pretty sure that in legalese it doesn't go very far 
towards protecting the promoters/venue providers. I've read about this 
issue in regard to people/businesses that offer hiking tours. 
apparently, the loophole works something like this:

hiker/raver signs waiver, hiker/raver sustains some kind of 
injury while hiking on a professionally guided tour/raving 
at certain site, hiker/raver decides to sue guide service/promoter,
hiker/raver easily invalidates the legality of the waiver by 
citing a (any) lack of information, e.g. "I was not informed when 
signing the waiver that there was a steep, sedimentary incline on 
the northwest face of the mountain." 

Unfortunately, the argument of nondisclosure of ALL 
possible dangers allows hiker/raver to easily bypass the waiver 
with regard to taking legal action. Not a professional opinion;
just what I heard.

Sorry to include this in a second post:

I think the reason that waivers don't hold water legally 
results from the fact that, ironically enough, one 
cannot waive one's rights in this country. 

But, the congress can do it for you!

Actually, i think way to go about it would be to
just ahve it on the ticket.  Just pick up a
concert ticket or ticket to a sporting event or some such
and read the back.

It usually has somethign about 
"accept this ticket means that the bearer waives..."

Although, especially in the US and especially especially in California,
waivers don't really mean much

Uh, what I was talking about was all that peace, love, planet, universe,
fractal stuff I keep seeing at raves here.
One would think that ravers had something to say about the planet.
Obviously you disagree.

I love the way you seem so sure about this. Firstly I am committing no
crime I can think of other than voicing an opinion that is not yours. I
doubt whether the folks at best.com would consider my talking about a topic
well within the gamut of the  Sfraves Constitution, a crime either. In fact
just recently someone made a posting to this effect. What I find curious is
how you got this "lynch mob" idea in a specifically communitarian forum?

or perhaps you could develop a bit of tolerance for a thread on the
politics of raving (in fact there already is one) so then just hit the
delete key whenever you see me and a whole bunch of sfravers talking about
SAVING THE PLANET USING RAVE.  We can agree to disagree, I don't see why
you should force a split in the community, surely there might come a time
when you'll also find the need to talk about how we continue raving in an
emerging tropical climate (now that el nino has become a fixture in
california). Planetary change is occuring at a rapid rate, lets not go into
FUTURE SHOCK, without some good vibe antidote

I appreciate your optimism.  Around here, we get excited when ravers can
remember to pick up their trash after an outdoor party.  Considering that
I can't even convince most of my raver friends that they should vote, I'm 
curious as to what signs of significant social change due to RC I should 
be on the lookout for.  Greater tolerance towards illegal immigrants?  
Widespread reduction in television ratings?   

Or are you taking the self-fulfilling prophecy approach?: Get enough people 
to believe that something great is happening, and it will.  If so, I wish 
you luck, because most ravers I know are just not that easily lead.

One advantage of coaching our dreams in terms of a very long time frame
is that we can focus on maintaining and improving the foundation on which
our dreams are based without becoming emotionally enslaved by grandiose 
expectations.  I've seen an awful lot of idealists, mesmerized by what 
raving seems to promise, get discouraged and leave the scene after a 
year or two.

My personal belief is that although humanity is still fucking up the planet 
in a major way, our collective consciousness has been gradually improving, 
and will continue to improve, not because of raving, but because Truth 
ultimately must prevail.  I see the long term establishment and spread of 
rave culture as part of this ongoing positive process.  Let's remember that 
the essence of Rhythm goes far beyond the state of our society.  When our 
bodies and mind become one with the beat, consciousness merges with the 
pulsating forces of the past/present/future Universe.  Planets may come and 
go, but Rhythm is eternal.

	I _just_ ordered myself a brand-spanking-new SL1200MkII last
week (with Ortofon Nightclub and Anvil case, but I digress), and after
searching very diligently, I was able to get a price of $389 from
Uncle's Music in New York (e-mail me if any of y'all want the phone
number). As far as I know, that's the best price being offered for new
decks _anywhere_ in the States, and I called over 30 places while I
was looking. Just another datapoint

PS - This list is beginning to look like a left-wing version of
Cypherpunks -- a bunch of political discussions with little relevance
to the list's charter and everybody involved assuming that everyone
else shares the same values and opinions as them, which of course
isn't true. The main difference between the cpunx and the folks on
this list is that over _there_ they think that all cypherpunks are
cranky, conservative libertarians, and over _here_ you seem to think
that all SFravers are progressive activists.
	I'm not going to harsh on David again (because I think his
points this time around are pretty much on the mark, _for his
politics_), but I think we should all remember that there are as many
definitions of raving and what "rave culture" is as there are ravers.

recently people were talking about what types of the lack
or lack of a lack of african american ravers and netters.

it was pointed out that because there are fewer
african americans online, there would be fewer
at sfraves based events.  it seems that some people
thought that that was an innaccurate statement.

Last year, i wrote my undergrad thesis on the topic of
women being on-line.  It went through a few metamorphesises 
to end up being a pile of bullshit.  Regardless, i spent
a lot of time thinking about the issue of access,
not just for women, but for everyone.  In a time where
being connected is becoming more crucial every day,
it seems to me that thinking about what types of access people
have is really important.

Online, the issue of race really doesn't matter.  People
don't inherently have a race attached to them online.  
They can have an ethnicity attached and, through that, race,
which does confuse the issue, but there the ethnicity 
holds a more important position.  I'm saying this because
it's important to realize that there is obviously not
just one culture in teh US and not just one culture online.
Some cultures in the US create an atmosphere where people
are likely to get connected and get online.  The amount
of cultures and sub-cultures and whatever else that 
are doing this is growing.   

I think it's important, though, to look at who is getting
connected, how and why.  For example, in the past two
years on campus, i have gone from having two or three 
friends connected to email to having all but a few having accounts.
So i tried to examine the reasons that i could tell
that many of them avoided getting it at first
and now seem to spend half their lives hanging out on the net.

Why?  Well because there are lots of groups of people
that don't get connected for reasons that have to do
with what group they belong to.  How many people
just dont get email because they have a phobia of dealing with computers?
What can be done to change this phobia into a tolerance or appreciation?

Gender, ethnicity and class have a hell of a lot of influence
on whether or not you are likely to be using computers.
I'm not saying that there aren't lower class latinas online,
there are, but i bet percentage wise there are a hell of
a lot less than middle class caucasian women.

So i think its a good idea to try to figure out why...

Why do i think that?  I dunno.. i think when it really comes down to it:
i have trouble having close relationships with people who
are not connected to the net.  There are a lot of people
who i think i miss out on having a close relationship with
(especially in the rave scene) because they arent net connected.
SO i want to figure out what I can do to help my friends get connected.
I don't think it's just giving them a computer and a modem
and netcom's fone number.

What does this have to do with raving?  Well the people who i want
to get connected are mostly ravers, so i think the question
to ask is how to make email a part of the rave experience 
in a way that makes people want to use it.

I mean a lot of people have found out about raving through the net.
but how many people have found out about the net through raving?

I bet in the SF area especially there are a bunch of people
who would NOT be online if it werent for sfraves.
So how can this be more incorporated to build a stronger
or at least more connected community?

You could also take this idea into figuring out how to get
more people from groups like lower class anyone,
or african americans or latino/as or whatevers to get into email
and the scene at the same time..

again... just some thoughts.

This reminds me of the best rave I was at:  by myself at the top of Half 
Dome (Yosemite NP).  I had been backpacking in the backcountry and was on 
my way out.  I camped at the base of half dome (just before the steps).  
Stupid me had decided to go camping during the one of the moster storms of 
january.  It had been raing/snowing/sleeting/lightning for the last three 
days and had cleared about 1 hour earlier.  Made dinner and noticed that 
the sky had cleared.  I climbed up half dome (made it to the top at about 
11pm).  I had the world to myself.  The storm was running out to the east. 
I was small in the scheme of things, yet I ruled the earth.

Mother Nature provided the setting: lights/effects by Mr. Lightning to the 
east, sound/DJ by various creatures and thunder provided the beat.  I think 
this has been the first and only time I have been musically inclined (I 
have zero musical talent).  The music building in my head was nothing I had 
heard before.  The beat and energy lifted me like nothing I had felt 
before.  I wish I could read music because I might have been able to write 
parts of it down but alas, it is lost.  I spent three hours dancing by 
myself on the top of the world totally free.  Nothing has ever brought me 
that close to nirvana.

>The point of this story is this:  The scene is what *YOU* make it.

I totally agree.  Having just moved out here only a few months ago, I 
definetly have my opinion about what the scene should be.  But that does 
not make the scene here any better or worse than anywhere else.  If you 
don't like it, move or try and change it, but don't just criticize it.  Be 
constructive and make a difference.  There are no absolutes in this world 
just varying degrees of gray.

It is an amazing experience to be alone and humbled and *ALIVE* is nature

On another note:
Seeing as I am new up here, what is the best way to get dialed into things

David, I wonder if you are in denial about things that are right. If your 
not, how come we don't get to hear that side of things from you. One of 
the beautiful things about raving for me is how we come together and 
share.  You do bring up alot of important issues, and I appreciate alot 
of them.  From observing the responses you get it seems that you alienate 
people more than bring them together.  Is this your goal?  I doubt it.
In a world with chaos, there is also harmony.
I think it is easier to deal with the chaos, when one also can experience 
some sence of harmony.  It would be nice to hear you help us out with the 
harmony side once in a while.  Might make it easier to digest your long 
winded world problem posts.

 Free your mind and your planet might follow. > >

I think splinter mailing lists from sf-raves are a fine idea.
sfraves-announce, sfraves-activism, sfraves-music, sfraves-planning?
All online groups that grow beyond a certain size start experiencing
flamage and disagreement about what is/isn't appropriate and what the
topic is supposed to be, especially when it's heartfelt stuff like
religion, politics, sex, and music--definite ingredients here on
sfraves.

Splitting up into many lists isn't splitting "the community"--it's
letting the community find its own level.  (Especially here, where our
roots 'n' origins are in our real-life, real rhythm, ravely
gatherings, not which email group we read.)

Many will read more than one list, or use mail tools to collect
mail so they can read it later.  Eventually, I think our whole
notion of "subject" and "topic" will change.  This email stuff is
just the beginning....

i really have to disagree.  first, raving can be seen as a promoter of 
COLLECTIVE mental and spiritual health, which is in itself political, 
oppositional to a system based on greed and consumption and with no real 
understanding of "health."  further, i see raves as TAZs (Temporary 
Autonomous Zones), where we can practice living as if we are free.  
i see freedom (the anarchist revolution big techno potluck shindig!) as a 
PROCESS, 
again, we learn to live and take care of ourselves as if we are free, in 
a world we imagine (free of sexism, racism, heterosexism ... all forms of 
authoritarian repression).  when we organize parties collectively we 
learn how work can be done without hierarchies.  

in addition, gathering together to create healthy communities in a culture 
that seeks to divide us, or 
give us a false sense of community based on mtv and consumption, is a 
radical and political act.  creating art and play outside of the 
marketplace (renegades and benefits) is a radical and poltical act.  

further, raves can be a place where we share information - on health, 
spirituality, political and social movements and ideas ...  and of course 
we can fundraise, which is CLEARLY and example of "rave...engaging itself 
with the world's most obvious problems."  

every time i rave, i voice my protest against "the system" (who says 
protests have to be covered by the mass media-demons?)  every minute i 
spend organizing parties with a purpose is my protest against a system 
that sees play either as superfluous, or as a "leisure-time hobby."  NO - 
raving, right now, gives me LIFE.  work just pays the rent and puts 
food on the table (and tries to suck all my life-energy out of me - sigh.)

of course, i'll continue to do the "regular" kind of political work 
(voting, marching, letter-writing...)...NOT because i believe this is the 
way to freedom, but because we'll get trampled all over if we don't!  

so there's my rant for the day.  and since we've been making book 
recommendations lately, i have to add Hakim Bey's TAZ and IMMEDIATISM (if 
you try to ignore his anti-abortion gibberish in TAZ).  as well as 
Starhawk's TRUTH OR DARE.  


take care everyone,

The SFRaves Calendar is now accessible on the Web and via ftp!  This
means you can get the most up-to-date calendar I have anytime during
the week, instead of waiting till Thursdays.  I still have to work on
cleaning up the formatting (I need to find a way to automatically have
the line breaks preserved), straighten out some problems with trying
to move info back and forth between two accounts (right now I can't
view the html document at the same geographic place I edit it), and
fixing some of the links.  Let me know if you have any other
suggestions.

To access the calendar, from http://hyperreal.com/, you can click on
"Regional mailing list archives", then "San Franciscan Raves", then
"calendar"; or you can go directly to 
http://hyperreal.com/raves/sf/calendar/sfrcal.html.  The ftp calendar is
hyperreal.com:/raves/sf/calendar/sfrcal.txt.  The SF Area Phone list
is also available there.  Finally, please send updates to
dhchung@hyperreal.com now.

Anyway, this weekend looks huge.  I don't think I need to give you any
recommendations, since I don't think you can go wrong with this selection.
Let's all meet up at Sunset on Sunday though :)

I haven't checked my mail in a few days so I just got around to reading
Tony's post.  I think Tony has summed up exactly how I feel about our
scene and what it means to be a part of it.  This is the kind of positive
energy post that I first subscribed to this list for.  The bickering that
has gone on over the last week made me wonder what was happening to the
scene, Tony's post reminded me that there are still a lot of people out
there with the positive vibe that keeps me going out to parties.

Thanks & Keep Smilin'

Andrew

well, maybe i'm trying to resist and agitate in the belly of the beast.
maybe i was born here so why the fuck should i have to leave?
maybe i'd like to move off the continent, at least for a while, but i 
don't have a european or other passport or much money.
maybe there's things i like about the u.s. 
maybe there's no anarchist land i can run to.

# point taken- at least upon arresting people police are supposed to 
# read you your rights so that you can be "aware" that you may be 
# waiving them- too bad this isn't the case before arrest, eh? 

yeah, but the real problem is that police in this line of work are true
experts at one thing -- manipulating people -- especially people who
don't understand what's going on, don't know the process, don't
understand what is a formality and what to be concerned about, 
and are scared shitless.  This is where lawyers understand the games.

The police inspectors well practiced at this, and suckered me rather
easily.  They flattered me and said they knew I understood all of this,
and i know this was just a formality, and I just needed to sign here.

At this point, they could have told the judge (lied to him) that I had
confessed to anything they wanted to say, and it would have worked,
because I had waived my rights, basically giving them permission to
do it.



happiness, strick



( carboning the list, because it just can't be said often enuf. 
  even when you know your rights, you still need to know all
  the ways you'll be suckered.  until it really happens to you
  once, you don't know what it's like, and it's easy to get
  arrogant.  that's why the military does repeated training for 
  handling interrogations.  my uncle, a colonel in air force,
  says he flunked his first few interrogations, when he was
  being trained.

  and thanks to whoever (was it amoeba?) posted the other 
  info a week or two ago, about handling police at parties --
  that was useful!

People have been forwarding enviornmental issues to sfraves for alot
longer than David D's been on this list. I guess some people just need
someone to flame. I mean flaming someone for something they say is
understandable, but for forwarding something is just plane stupid, there
are alot more things that have alot less value that are turned into threads.

Dana makes some good points, and as an anecdote, I recently set up
Submerge Records in Detroit with an email account.  Mad Mike was just
commenting to me on how he's really getting into it, both for the ease
of information flow, and for the fact that people are really seen for
their ideas and how they express themselves, and not for their race or
gender or other physical properties.

Gosh thanks go to Josh!
Do you think we've uncovered a basic human need to have flamebait? Maybe
brian b could set up some automatic teflon covered robot thing, so the
flamee doesnt have to be human, thereby satisifying all on the list.

Phred is right.  This is NOT appropriate to this forum, important as it may
be.  I don't care if you think that someone who calls themselves a raver has
to be concerned about this - it doesn't have anything to do with the charter
of the list.  The same holds for UK music vs. US music, where to buy the best
drugs, etc etc.  I will remove people who post excessive amounts of off-topic
messages - it is a privilege to be here and use Hyperreal's CPU and
bandwidth, not a right, and just because I'm very lassaiz-faire about my
mailing list moderation does not mean I won't take action when needed.

Subject: Liability Insurance (was our forest...)

     Hi all!  This is my first post to the group after lurking on and off 
     for quite a while. Guess I finally have something relevant to say in 
     response to Niels' great idea on a liability waiver.
     
     While in theory people should take responsibility for theirselves, the 
     reality is that greed often gets in the way.  If someone gets hurt and 
     their parent or friend realizes that they can take advantage of the 
     situation, lawsuits are filed.  
     
     I'm part of a dance collective that hosts smoke-free, alcohol-free 
     dance jams as well as drum and dance weekends.  We have people sign 
     liability waivers _but_ there's a few other things we do to cover 
     ourselves since the waiver doesn't carry much weight in court.
     
     1)  If a person is under 18  (we have all age events), the parent has 
     to sign for them.
     
     2)  We ensure the locale carries site insurance (no renegade stuff for 
     planned events).
     
     Having a person sign a waiver is a reminder for them to be responsible 
     more than avoiding lawsuits for our group.  We've looked into 
     liability insurance and one way to go around it is to have someone 
     teach a movement class to cover an event. (I carry personal liability 
     insurance for teaching dance classes and teach a contact improv class 
     prior to a dance jam.) 
     
     For one or two-day events, insurance brokers are not in abundance but 
     they are out there since many cities require you take out a policy if 
     you host an event when renting their sites.  I'm sure other promoters 
     can fill you in on the details.
     
     As I write this, questions start to come up for me about "rave 
     culture" and responsibility.  There's a happy medium but do we really 
     want a signed list of attendees on a waiver?  Personally, I don't 
     think it's a problem, but what if a rave gets busted and the list gets 
     confiscated?  There's not alot of incrimination but anonymity (sp?) is 
     lost and it reminds me of big brother.
     
     I'd like to discuss this with other interested parties sometime.  I'd 
     also like to discuss (off-line) a ravish-related _but_ different item:
     
     A promoter friend and I are exploring ways to integrate the fine arts, 
     performing arts, and holistic arts into an acceptable form of 
     celebration and ritual.  Kinda ravey but not, kinda lollapollaza but 
     not, kinda Megatripolis but not.  He's done some stuff in Ireland and 
     I've done some work here and now we're at a point of sharing ideas and 
     creating something viable.  If you're interested in exploring this 
     with us, let me know.  I can expand on some of what we envision, but I 
     don't want to waste bandwidth so e-mail or call me if you're 
     interested.   
     
     I'm so glad I finally have a reason to post.  I've been wanting to 
     meet y'all for awhile.  I'm looking forward to meeting sfravers this 
     weekend.  After I figure out what I'm wearing and where I'll be, I'll 
     let you know.
     
     Hugs and smiles,

Subject: Raving in Sydney

  Greetings all you SFRavers back home...  I finally got a SLIP connection
and have Netscape running.    WOW!  What a difference over lynx...

  Anyway,  last weekend I went to my first Totem event called Pyramedia,
very conveniently located 100 feet from where I live here in Kings Cross.

  A little about Kings Cross...  I would have to call this section of
Sydney the most interesting place I've ever lived.   My front door leads
right onto the main drag..  where there are tons is strip joints,  flashey
disco's,  and hundreds of international restaurants all within a short
walking distance from my front door.

  This place stays awake 24 hours a day...  Bars and nightlubs are also
open 24 hours a day.   Drinking age is 18 yrs old,  and very few venues
even bother to check ID's.    About the only thing I don't like are the
street whores who get really agressive,  and literally grab your arm and
say "Want to have a good time?".

  Pretty soon,   I plan on taking a longer trek across Australia,  and
plan on visiting Darwyn,   Byron Bay,   and possibly Perth and Alice
Springs,  which means I will be missing some raves...  Arghhh!!!

  As I had mentioned,   raves are mainstream here,   and almost every
week,  they have what AusRaver OLD SCHOOL'ers call "Kiddie raves",  geared
mostly towards the very young crowd,  and feature mostly hard core,  or
Happy Hard core.

  This last weekends Pyramedia by Totum featured mostly German Hard
trance,  and I really went off.    This coming weekend is another
Sabatage,   which I'm probably going to make,   rather then go to
a kiddie rave called Smerf Village II.   Gack,  that smerf village
flyer is HUGE,   a big fat glossy 5 pager flyer.    I intend to
collect as many rave flyers as I can to bring back and show all
of you,   as well as trying to bring back some vinyl,  CD's and DAT's

  I'm also writing my OWN techno tune,  and will be bringing that
back with me as well.   Yesterday,  I layed down the drums,   Hi Hats,
and Base line for the first segment of my techno tune,   which is
at 150 BPM's.    Tommorrow,   I intend to overlay more segments,
using an Atari computer,  driving a host of MIDI devices,   having
a ball creating my own music.

  Here in Sydney,  there is a collective group of about 10 - 20 bands
called the 'Clan Analogue" who gather each week at the Bently Bar,
every Wednesday,  and DJ as well as have live performances.

 Although,  we are heading towards our winter down here,  the weather
here has been about 78 degrees high,  and 67 degrees low,   with sunney
skies.

  Today,  I had to go to Geko,   my local internet provider,   to get
SLIP installed on my laptop,  and had to take the ferry.    WOW!   What
a amazing transpo system they have here.    These ferrys are double hull
boats,  and accellerate with amazing speed and manouvering abilities.

  Sydney is a bery huge city of 5 million people,  and dispite the
massive population,   has little or no air and water pollution.   It has
many bays,  and water inlets,   and a very efficient ferry system.

  Today,  my ferry ride brought me right next to Sydneys modern Opra
theator.

  Anyway,   I hope you all are keeping the scene alive,  as I've been
following the SF rave scene very closly from here,   reading all of the
SFRave mail,  as well as the AusRave mail.    With Eudora,  which I
finally got running,   I can filter the mail into seperate files,  and
keep track much more easily.    Not only that,   but I've been Webbing
into the local SJ Mercury news,   catching up on all the local news,
as if I've never left.

  Here in Australia,  the Internet is now MAINSTREAM in such a way,
that "triple-M" the local Rock station uses CU-SeeMe and has listeners
plug in and send their pictures over the internet.   All radio call-ins
are now over internet,  but the real problem is their back bone data
bandwidths just cannot handle such a massive amount of traffic.

  There is just ONE 25 Megabit link between Australia and the USA,
which just isn't cutting it as far as bandwidth is concerned.   There is
NO publically available ISDN,   but in other ways,   Australia is FAR
AHEAD of the USA in certain technologies,  and lax laws.

  Anyway,  soon I'll be starting my trek across this huge vast land mass,
populated by only 20 million people.   I mean it's really amazing,  once
you get away from the coast how vast and empty the land areas are.

  In the afternoons,  the sun is so fierce and gnarley here,  that you
cannot stay out in the sun without sun block,   due in part because of
the lack of ozone protection.

  All the forces here are opposite to what I'm used to....  The sun goes
around the sky sorta backwards,   the moon is upside down,   people drive
on the LEFT side of the road,  and water goes down the drain in the opposite
direction.   So,  my energy levels are balancing out...   causing a really
strange realization of how important it is to be balanced,  and how much
the forces play a part in my general life in the USA.

   My energy level I think has also increased,   as I'm still religiously
doing my energy blockage removal,   and people here are so amazed at how
old I am,  and still out there groovin with such high energy.   I think these
opposite forces I'm experiencing is sort of unwinding me or making my
whole psyche sorta unravel.

   Anyway,   As I read SFRaves,  I'm getting the impression that all of
you fine folks north of the Equator are keeping the scene alive,  and
now that I've been here exactly a month,   I'm fitting in here quite
well,   being very independent from my AusRave friends,   and getting
around like a local.    I'm even learning a lot of AusSpeak...  :-)

   So,  please keep your promise and keep the scene alive up there,
just like I'm doing down here....    I miss ya all....  But I'll be
back in 2 more months....

Cheers - And keep the scene alive...
Crunchman from Down unda...

But is this really appropriate for an online format with 300+ users?  As 
a collective that throws low cost parties the Cloud Factory has trouble 
working things out in person with ten people.  The scope of the ideas you 
are talking about do not necessarily present themselves as easily as you 
think they do.  as suggested before there need be a mailing list that is 
open for those interested to discuss these things, most on this list I 
feel didn't join it to save the world per se.  I personally do things in 
my life to work on it but did not join this forum to waste my day reading 
about thoughts...posts like monicats on the other hand are very useful, 
they contain:

1. pertinent info
2. contact info
3. not a lot of bullshit opinion on the topic
4. they end after the first message so that those who feel compelled to 
act can do so on their own time.

Recently on the list, a few people have mentioned the word 'meme'.  I'm 
not quite sure what that means.  Can someone explain?

I'm also planning on going to Out-A-Sight this Friday.  What can I expect

Ah, mijos, a week of library work, as well as licking my wounds as I
finally finalized a dead end relationship.And what have i learned?

                  Basically, the reason why I rave: Friends
                 (and much better music than the palladium:)

You keep me coming back, you make my belly fill with butterflies when I
hear the thump-thump and turn and smile and meet new people who smile back.
When someone cares when I am down, and someone who will drag their problems
into my world for help, and then laugh at them with me another day.

A lot of you  got me through this last one, and it's been a long, hard
time. And if this term paper gets done, then I'll return all those hugs I
received, somewhere, sometime, this weekend. Thanks, folks, I needed that!

Lotsa love,
 Milton and the E-Bee.....

Brian, with all due respect. Is this list a dictatorship or a democracy? If
its a democracy in any way, then perhaps you might like to poll sfravers
about exactly what it is they would like to see carried, in way of an
effort to maintain the communal aspect of this list. So far, although there
might be a lot of loud and upset voices in the crowd, I still see messages
of support , usually from the less vocal posters. And it would be a shame
to see real debate on issues affecting us all - even a thread which you
have decided is off-topic namely Raving the Planet Love, to disappear
because of a few careless words.

I hope you see my point and not my religion.

David Dei.

So far we got one vote for SFravers being allowed to discuss Local Raving
in a broader Planetary Context with three against and it looks like the
planet might lose the vote!  Do we get to dance on the grass or not?  I'm
quite prepared  for a narrow cast party-only rave list - as invisaged by
Brian, but somehow I sense that not all SFravers agree with this. Theres
been quite a bit of info on the Redwoods, some Earth First! info, etc etc
posted to this list over the last week. Lets at least know where we ravers
stand.

PS:  Regarding my initial reasoning for posting the Global Warming
Information -We need to be informed - Could be a great theme for a Rave -
support your planet and get your local reps to pressure Clinton to ratify
the Treaty and stop the El Nino Effect that Dumped water on Cali last
week..

As Brian B. has pointed out in the past, this is a very high volume 
mailing list, and while off topic social issues might be tangentially
related to the purposes of this list, they are not going to be 
solved here. If you want to thrash some issue out, invite others on 
this list to take it to private email.

Well... count this as a vote FOR interesting off-topic postings & a big
fat vote against people who selectively flame someone for who he is
instead of what it is he's posting. It's fucking bullshit, if one of the
more established people posted some enviornmental stuff (and there's been
*alot* of that over the years) there's no way he'd get flamed, especialy
by the list administrator. Face it most stuff is gonna be considered
off-topic by somebody. While I may disagree strongly with David's
approach, there's no reason to selectively enforce a very hazy rule on
him, that other people break just as much.

Oh please! The theatrics are quite uneccessary. The point you seem to 
missing is that no one is saying that these matters are unimportant. NO ONE.

The point is that there are more appropriate places to discuss these 
issues. That is one of the reasons for USENET. Persons with interests in 
SPECIFIC areas can subscribe to a newsgroup to discuss SPECIFIC issues 
pertaining to the subject of the newsgroup. Otherwise, you end up with a 
quagmire of newsgroup-unrelated threads, which is what SFraves seems to 
have been degenerating into (*IMHO*) While I personally believe your 
intentions to be heart-felt and well-intentioned, it does not alter the 
fact that the posts have little to do with the purpose of SfRaves. 
It is, and has always been, up to the discretion of the moderator of any 
group(USENET or listserver in our case) the scope of the discussion
in a particular newsgroup.
 
 The scope in the case of SfRaves is outlined clearly in the welcoming 
message. If you have any questions about appropriate posting, please read 
ANY basic net-etiquite guide. 
  
The planet is not "losing" if people choose not to support your 
newsgroup-unrelated postings here. Your energy can be better and more 
effectively spent in areas or newsgroups that have relevance to your 
postings. 

For example: Personally, I do care about the Earth, but think 
the Earth Firsters go too far in certain respects. Is this subject worth 
discussing? Of course. Is this the proper forum, according to the intent 
of this group as outlined by Brian? NO.

Hello SFRavers -

 Here's my "vote" ( although I don't think Brian Behlendorf has to follow
the results of this "voting" at all ) -

 Short form: "No" to sfraves@hyperreal.com email about topics not directly 
  related to raves , "Conditional OK" to sfraves email about rave-related
  matters outside of the San Francisco Bay area.  

 Long form: I haven't enough time expand on my short answer; maybe I'll
    post again Saturday afternoon after I rest up from Harmony. I hope
    that it's still relevent by then. ( Or even better , that things improve
    before I get around to posting again! ).

Dear Sfraves;

	Reguarding waivers very breifly, you cannot sign you rights away 
legally, bit you can limit liability to say a $100/head/incident. The 
airlines do this, it you get killed in an airline crash the most your 
family can get for you from the is $250,000.00. I thing I'm worth more 
than that, but appartely the surpreme court does;t go figure.

Peace & Love

excuse me.  I only met Tristan here in SF and only discovered he was 
Kevin Keiper a couple of weeks ago.  he's said some very nice things 
about my 8 years in the rave scene and i've posted a couple of possible 
explanations for *some* of the cultural flak flying around.  but he has 
nothing to do with Megatripolis and, if he's a zippy, he isn't working 
with or for me.
tristan speaks for himself as we all do.

take a deep breath, fraser, rise above it for all our sakes.
OK, I shall only say that I have been doing pretty much ALL of the list 
you mention for 8 years now in the rave scene - I figure that's before 
you even *heard* of raves. and I have personally intervened between cops 
and ravers more times than you've sipped smart drinks.  (stop now)   fraser
PS  if some of you can get boiling hot because some limeys *dare* to 
suggest new ways forwards for *your* scene then you'll be *easily* able to 
imagine how I felt when I read the below.

ask yourself:  why do so many really good people get so involved in what 
is often a rip-off, never happens kind of situation and with less "show" 
than the smallest national rock&roll band could muster?  WHY??  unless 
you think it's just sily - which you obviously don't - then it *must* be 
deep, fundamental and life-changing.  and if it *is* then it *must* be one 
of the most socially relevant forces in our culture and on our planet 
today.  and I'm tired of hearing about "new Ravers" not clearing up 
afterwards (even if I get tired of clearing up after 'em).  of course they 
don"t!  that's *exactly* why RC must spread. RC *changes* people.

but I don't think anyone's disagreeing, are they?  does anyone involved 
say it's not fundamental and life-changing? 
or, more divisive, who takes the position that we *don't* want RC to 
spread?  that, as I'd caricature such a position (and I've encountered it 
hundreds of times in the old festival scene in the UK over the decades) 
they'd rather have an exclusive little scene as the planet disappears 
futher down the plughole?

Dear All;

	I think it's time that we all start respecting our diifferences and 
all the individual selfs there are out. 

	In massage school and while learning yoga, individually was stress
as being scared, it is what we are, wonderfully unique; there is no else
like you or me, we are all masterpieces in our own rights. I stronly
encouage you to all see that in yourselfs, love it, and you will be able
to love, except, and at least tolerate almost anyone, and know their all a
necessary part of the plan. 	

	When I excepted that I was a totally unique person; a masterpiece,
I was able to see it in others, almost anyone. If your don't see that in
yourself, I would like to make two suggestions, go to an art mus-se-em and
look at objects that are one of a kind(that both disgust you & bring you
joy), and sometime pick up a lite Anatomy & Phislogy book, read it, and
wonder, at what you are. 

	Our country was based on Freedom of Speach and it must apply to all.
I forget what Supreme Court Justice said that freedom speach stops at 
yelling fire in a dark crowded movie theater, I don't think thats 
happening here. 

	I forget what American Revolutionary fiqure said "Beware the
tear-ren-e of the Majority." Many came here to San Francisco, because we
were consider different and either not welcomed, or longed for other kind
people. 

	It really saddens me to see us, a very connected group of kind 
people, fighting amonst ourselves. But another part of see the conflict 
as change, and I do believe for the most part change is necessary for the 
survival of all things. But I know we all have enough positivity in us to 
acomplish this change in a respectful and affirming manner.

	I'm not going to tell my brothers and sisters to stop, but I will
ask however, do you feel good, about what you are doing? I hope the answer
brings some awareness into your lifes, thanks :)

I'm not a lawyer, but I play one on TV... Everything is almost too good
to be true, which is why the check is in yer mouth and I promise not to
come in the mail!

I've signed many a liability waiver myself, and have bought many a
ticket that includes an explicit waiver. That's where the idea
sprung.... as to whether it's legally valid, that's just a matter of
who can come up with the higher-priced armani-clad lawyer and pay off
teams of "experts" to lie for your side in court, just enough to
convince a jury of idiots too losing to find a way out of jury duty...
(ahem.... :-) ) This ain't democracy, ya know, it's a moneyocracy....

Damn, this cynicism must end, or the kiddies will stop smiling back at
me while raving... I guess I'm just pining for that flaming chalice of
KGB while I'm still away from home...

For some reason, you refuse to accept that WE CANNOT DISCUSS EVERY PROBLEM IN
THE WORLD on sfraves.

Posting wholly political posts, like this Democratic National Committee
propaganda (Hillary was the head of CDF until recently) on sfraves can only
lead to MEGABYTES of posts.

Rather than start these Megabytes, I'll just quote Fraser Clark:

Too long a thread.  PLEASE TAKE IT TO ALT.POLITICS !

PS In a lot of ways you are like a Jehovah's Witnesses follower coming to our
door.  Like them, you refuse to accept:
1) Other people can have thought about these problems already and have come a
conclusion somewhat different than yours that is equally valid.
2) That you might be wrong about something.

Hello wonderful sfravers!,

	Well it is finally here, and all ready to go!!!!! (We set 
basically the whole party up earlier this week.) I want to say a few 
things about this party:
	First, if your coming, please respect the location that we are 
using. This means don't tear up the furniture, NO TAGGING, etc. Bring 
whatever you want to, as long as it makes you happy! There will be a map 
point to avoid overcrowding. We ask that you call the voice mail @ 6pm 
and get the directions to the map point. 408.486.9591 For those of you 
coming from the north bay, the map point will be in Santa Cruz. Now 
comes the tricky part! You must go to the map point and get an 
invitation, then bring it with you to the party. You won't be able to 
enter without a invitation. We are making a limited amount of tickets so 
get there early to ensure you get in. Also the fist 50 people get in for 
half price($5). Please don't come to the map point before we open it up, 
and that will be @ 7:30 pm.
	Also, when you do show up please realize that the location does 
have neighbors so please, please be very quiet as you park and walk to 
the location!!!! You can make all the noise in the world once inside, 
thanx!!!!!!:) 
	Speaking of inside, thanx to all who helped set up this party. 
You guys made it look great!!!!!!!
	Regarding the afterparty, Cloud Factory is doing an outdoor 
party as soon as Harmony is done and can move the system. (5 am.ish)
	So, I guess there is nothing more to say, except that if you do 
come, come with tons of love, smiles, hugs, and energy to dance your 
asses off!!!!!!!!!!  408.486.9591 

Peace love and harmony to all,

Greg

I hope someone listens.  It's sad to see all the petty bickering and

love.

I have to agree and give another big vote for allowing slightly off topic
subjects. Even though the traffic has been heavy as of late, I'm getting so
much more content, doing so much more thinking, doing so much more about it
all.

again Josh is right on, IMO. Come on folks, open up a little.

Also...
I, personsonally, do not want to belong to some elitist list where some are
CENSORED which is what david has been threatened with by more than one person
from Hyperreal.  At first i responded personally to david disagreeing with
his style of personal attacks. But lately i have found posts from him and
others to be as related as most posts have been for a long while. 

I also believe that due to the high volume of mail on this list that everyone
should pitch in and do their part to reduce to volume of slightly-off-topic
posts or, as some suggest, splinter the list up into subtopics.

It just doesn't give me a warm feeling to see these slightly veiled threats
towards censoring david...

just my opinion - go ahead and flame

peace,
martin

I am not sure if you all remember that SFRaves is not a place for non-rave related
mail, personal point and counterpoint posts (people can only take so much of a thread),
and flames.... I hope you realise that at this rate maybe sfraves should be
separated into three categories, calendar only, announcements/other rave realted
reviews, and rave politics. But I doubt that will ever happen. Even though sfravers talk 
about various things that they counters while raving whether it has to do with
guns, racism, cops, etc., just remember that there are other people out there who are
really not interested in a deep discussion on those issues. That is why there are
other newsgroups, mailing lists, and web sites. Make a list about sites with the
related topics, post about it, meet at a place or meet on vrave or start a small alias 
mailing list about it. I suggest people read the following below carefully. A long
time ago, sfraves got so out of hand, that Brian turned off the list for a week. 
So think before you hit that "r" key too soon. 

Cindy
______________________________________________________________________________________

				  
			
Some guidelines for posting to SFRaves.  Print this out and tape it to your computer for
handy reference.  This list will be given to all new members from now on.  

1) First realize that

        a) SFRaves is a large mailing list. 

        b) The volume is already quite high. 

        c) For every editorial or opinion there are hundreds of
           possible replies. 

        d) Topics of world import such as feminism and race relations
           will *always* be with us, at least for the current generation,
           and while discussion about them is important the issues *won't*
           be resolved by just talking about them here on the list.  They
           are appropriate here as long as they aren't more appropriate
           in soc.feminism, etc. 

        e) Ego has NO PLACE on the mailing list. 

        f) Even with a high signal-to-noise ratio, a high volume means more
           people skim articles than actually read them.  This is a bad thing.  
  
2) Now for the general rules: 
        
        a) NO PERSONAL ATTACKS - even if someone is being a complete
           jerk and everyone agrees, please refrain from flaming him/her
           in public.  Send him/her all the private email you want.  If
           they flame you first, be the wise one and take the argument
           off the list.  If he/she is truely being a jerk everyone knows
           it anyways.  The difference between a well-reasoned argument
           and a personal flame should be quite clear. 
        
        b) Try and set an upper limit to your number of posts to 2 a day. 
           Making more is fine, but as you're typing your third make *sure*
           it's something that's worth the time of the 250 people you are
           sending it to. 
        
        c) BREVITY IS THE SOUL OF WIT.  Paragraphs prove you have a point. 
        
        d) Ranting is the opposite of raving (thanks to rth@netcom.com for
           reminding us)
        
        e) Don't reply to a post until you have read your entire mail
           queue and made sure no one else has replied exactly what you
           would say. 
        
        f) Refrain from making "me too" posts, where you simply add "I agree" 
           to the bottom of a quoted message. 
        
        g) If you reply to a post someone makes, READ EVERY WORD THEY SAY
           CAREFULLY, and in the absence of facial and hand gestures interpret
           their comments in the best possible light.  It's very hard for the
           "TV" generation (which we are whther you own a TV or not) to know
           how to communicate without visual cues.  Make sure you understand
           what the other person is saying. 
        
        h) If a conversation turns into a particulary heated argument, wait
           at least an hour before making your reply, to allow you to see
           what they are saying in the absence of a testosterone rush. 
        
        i) Be SURE of what you are saying when you say it.  Proofread your
           comments several times.  Make sure your use of certain words is
           the generally accepted use by the community at large, not what
           *you* think that usage should implicate.  


We are at the brink of something BIG here, and SFRaves can be a part of it.  But only if 
we keep ourselves as high quality as we've been in the past, and these guidelines are a 
part of it.  Anyone who's spent a good deal of time on the net knows these as part of an 
unwritten policy, but they bear repeated for those who are new.  

The Conciousness Revolution has begun.

MY LAST MESSAGE WAS NOT A FLAME, I REPEAT, NOT A FLAME.  really sorry, 
sorry, so sorry if i rubbed anyone the wrong way :(.  yes, i was being 
sarcastic, and yes, i do feel like a bit of a jerk.  i suppose i could use 
that pms scapegoat.  it's explained away all that salt i've been eating 
this week...

i do feel a bit tense about all this angry stuff that's been written 
lately, though, and i must say (here it comes), love the sinner and hate 
the sin (actually, jesus said it first.  maybe he stole it from paul.  
anyway... ). what i mean is, i'd rather be directing my anger towards what 
i see as the problems of the world rather than towards the world itself.  
i don't hate the whole county, i mean, heck, yosemite lives here.  but, 
that damn congress, man, i'm really not hip to their plans.  even cops 
fall in love from time to time.  

okay, that's at least a nickles worth.  sorry it's not rave related. ;)


meekly yet hormone drivenly yours (the ol' pms ploy again),
sig  

ps  my most sincere apologies to all the ffplanners people who accidently 
got this ol' message when i accidently sent it to the wrong address.  
duh... it's a brain!

Hi ya'll :)


Some thoughts...

A list is not a democracy. Someone puts up hard earned cash and
a lot of work to get/maintain a list. Just because one subscribes to 
a list does not mean that one has any rights at all. The use of a list 
is a privelege. Not a right. 

The *best* that one can expect from a list administrator/owner is a 
benevolent dictatorship. 

I believe that this list allows all of us *off topic* subjects all
the time. The objection I hear and share is the constant badgering 
by those with agendae delivering sermons on the same topics.  

Tell me once. I will take your point into consideration.
Tell me twice. I will become irritated.
Tell me thrice and I will associate your cause with your obnoxious
behaviour. That will not win your cause support.

Well, I suppose there are two possibilities upon comming across info about
poor children in your area.
1. You Ignore It as a potential piece of propoganda designed to hoodwink
you into feeling outraged
2. You decide that there might just be a bit of truth to it, so you post it
to you local community (in this case its sfraves) hoping that a thread will
start about how rave culture might be able to help underprivileged kids.

I dunno, its seemed obvious to me,  but then I'm a newcomer to america.

You could start your own rave mailing list where you could 
take about whatever you want...pc-ravers or whatever you'd like to call 
it...this discussion has gotten way out of hand, and this really not the 
place to get into an in depth discussion about what are really NON RAVE 
RELATED things.  I'm sure you could make some argument that it is rave 
related, but anyone could make an argument that anything is rave related...
And what's this about a dictatorship?  Did you read the charter when you 
joined?

If it weren't for the ugly flame wars and endless commentary, most
off-topic threads would have a fairly short life span.

I'd hate to see this become a narrow, one-dimenensional "raves only" place.
Raving is the common thread that brings us together, but I think the group
would be deprived if we had to censor all other parts of our lives when 
we're together.

If that's really happening, that is totally lame.  but _i_ don't see that
(i could just be blind) i see some people getting shit

People shouldn't make/enforce rules unless they will and can always enforce it?
Hmmm... see i think the rule isn't that you NEVER post off-topic,
the rule is you don't go fucking overboard and post new "off-topic"
things everyday and that you dont generate half of sfraves mail
in continuing a thread of people flaming you...

Let's say, someone pops on the sfraves list and is heavily involved in an
organization that was focused around caring for neurotic cats.
She thinks that people on Sfraves would want to know and possibly
join the organztion, so she posts some info to the list.
She also wants to plan a benefit rave for the organization,
so she brings up that topic too.  People seem interested,
so there is a bit of discussion about what the focus and all that will be.
When the discussion starts to get technical, it jumps
over to the sfraves-planner list.

Then... Cindy, let's say, recently got involved with an 
involved with an organziation that takes care of a park
or some such and she posts about the organization to the list
and mention the next time she is goign out to do some groundskeeping.
ANd wants to plan a party or something to benefit the group
and celebrate in the park.  People don't really seem
interested, but Cindy keeps talking about it expressing
how important it is to take care of the earth
because we wont have a place to rave if there is no earth.
A lot of people ask her to stop, but she just says
that this is something we can't afford to ignore.

Now, in the first scenario, i don't see anyone getting flamed...
sure cats arent really rave related so someone grumbles,
but if there is only one or two complaints, 
i don't see much happening with this.

Second scenario. No it's not likely Cindy will be just kicked off the list.
but if she were to keep at it...

I mean let's say a group of people were building a house together,
it's a very open house, that anyone is allowed into
to help build it and maintain it.
If one of the people who were there originally to lay the foundation
wanted to redecorate or add another room or something,
and the rest didn't there would be a lot of discussion i'm sure
and it would take awhile before an ultimatimum was made.
But if someone came in and helped out a little bit
and then started talking about redecoration and
started being really loud and persistent...
well i think they would be asked to calm down or leave
and if they didnt calm down or leave, would be booted.

Brian made teh down payment on this here house,
and is the one who owns the deed to teh property.
He invited us all in here to help make his house a better place
but i think it was definitely with the notion that it was still his house
and he would mostly let us design it as we wish,
but he could veto any plans on changes to the blue prints.


once again.. just some thoughts... (none of which may even closely
resemble reality)

Look folks, there's no law that says you can only belong to one mailing list
or newsgroup, and that that mailing list or newsgroup has to include every
subject you find appropriate.  There are plenty of newsgroups that deal with
politics, plenty that deal with the environment, just about every subject you
can think of.  And you can read them *all*, or any combination you want. 
That's why the anarchy (er, panarchy) of the net succeeds - information
organizes itself, and unorganized sources of information perish.  It's the
only way to deal with the gigabytes of public data the net generates each
day, and it's pretty successful.  The system breaks down when users 
ignore the structure of this system, and it's up to the other users of a 
particular resource to keep it usable by pointing the errant user to the 
other right places.  

There's a newsgroup called "ba.politics" which is focused on politics and 
activism in the bay area.  There's also "alt.activism" I think, in fact a 
family of them.  If there's an issue coming up, like old-growth logging, 
which you think is something people on sfraves should know about, the 
right thing to post is "hey, I've started a topic on the proposed bill to 
log redwoods over in ba.politics - come join us", and to carry the 
conversation over there.  Or start a mailing list over on best.com if 
it's an issue not covered by any other forum.  

There's no reason to overload SFRaves with stuff that's only marginally 
related, even though there's probably a high correlation in the type 
of people interested in the issue.  

	Brian

I completely agree that those guys are doing that, I just think Brian
should have the guts to call them on *that* instead of threatening them for
violating some rule that a majority of the people don't follow anyways.

Yesterday I posted a message indicating that I was going to be spinning
at a ug party.  Unfortunately it has been cancelled, in respect to 
the Wicked posses 4 year anniv.

I know the people who were thowing he gig, but was in no way part of the organizing crew.

The date has been set back to next week. I'm keeping my fingers crossed.

To those of you who wrote me asking, I will be replying in a more personal manner (as soon as I get home).


I really wanted to do something other than go to the mega-Wicked party this weekend, but alas shit happens.  I'm looking forward to next week however.

Will keep you infomed.
(I meant informed, I hate VI :) ).

++++++

I don't know WHAT party I might attend this weekend.  I am really not up to
go to anything large, but my mind has been known to change @ 2 a.m. or so,
so I'm givin myself some room to change my mind.

I know Wicked will be a crazy show to attend, and I know the boys will be in TOP
form.  I alo know that the best Wicked I ever went to was w/ Pierre.
I also know the best DJ I've heard to date has been Derrick Carter.
To paraphrase Thomas, overheard at a local club beore he went on "They sure ain't Wicked!".   Damn right brother Thomas, damn right.

So I guess, if you're out, I'll probably catch you @ Wicked.  Better yet, I'll see many of you next week, the stars & g-d willing.

Peace out & have a great safe one,
John

Subject: CHEMICA SUTRA lurker belated view (long)
Cc: fraser@megatripolis.org

Before memory fades too much, I wanted to post at least a partial review of
Megatripolis/ParallelU/Chemica Sutra by someone not connected with
producing the event.  As a disclaimer, my perspective is colored by
(occasional intricate rainbow patterns) advanced age (51) and limited rave
experience (several but infrequent - 1st Gathering anniversary at
Concourse, early Equinox in warehouse, some Sunsets and GG park days, ...).
But I have been reading many sfraves posts daily for the last 3? years
since the beginning of the mailing list (Hi Brian B) when we lived in SF
(now in Palo Alto), and the postings often bring light and smiles into my
days.

Chemica Sutra attracted me by the early start time (and endtime for me - I
was home by 3am, so I probably missed some), by the Parallel Univ & topic
(I had participated in the "Free U" in Palo Alto around '69 or so), and by
the net controversy about Fraser, Zippys, etc.

I won't attempt to describe the space, but it blew me away from when I
first walked in the door and continued to surprise me all evening with new
discoveries.  Not to spoil all the surprises, but Laughing Sal, formerly of
Playland At The Beach (if anyone remembers) was standing there with her big
smile all night.

Even tho the party was small in numbers (max 100?), for me it was like a
microcosm of the huge Gathering with varied activities in different rooms
the constituents of which changed as attendees mixed and regrouped.  The
small dance area seemed to reach critical mass with as few as half a dozen
dancers and was  constant source of great sounds, fine lights, and high
vibes that often caught me like a whirlpool and danced me around until I
spun out recharged lured away to other attractions.  Smoking was out back,
so the air was unusually breathable for a party (perhaps a little musty
with the old artifacts collection).

The talks were interesting, the performers mesmerizing. Slight
disappointment that the pagan punch was too subtle for me (but not the
"nurse" that served it).  But for me the uniform acceptance and
friendliness in a group of such diverse ages was unique (at some parties I
feel out of place when most folks are younger than my kids).  The people I
met were great!  Kind Kate befriended and guided me several times.  Fraser
seems to me genuinely called to his role in making it happen and spreading
the word (and the word is Love).  Will told tantalizing tales of shamanic
travel in South America.  Tantrika Daniela led me to a nice gathering of
loving folks and mellow music the next night.  Dan inspired me to rise
before dawn to greet the age of Itza.  Magenta is magic!!!

So I clearly enjoyed Chemica Sutra and came away with renewed hope and
revitalized interest in the culture, if I can just get to more raves that
are not so far past my bedtime.

Grateful,
- Ed
