Grrrrrrr.  I hate it when I type such a list in my web browser and it 
wipes out whatever list of tracks I've been listening to in winamp (for 
obvious reasons.)  Sometimes I feel so braindead for doing so.

(Which I suppose is a request to consider such repercussions and post a 
web page link instead.)

Grrrrrrr.

Subject: [sfraves] Newsom wants club promoters to get permits, more cops, etc. to stem nightclub related violence

>From The Examiner:

Responding to a recent spike in violent crimes in and around San Francisco's popular nightclubs, Mayor Gavin Newsom announced new legislation Thursday intended to make the venues safer.

Under the proposed legislation - to be introduced by Supervisor Sophie Maxwell at Tuesday's Board of Supervisors meeting - it would be illegal to loiter within 10 feet of a club for more than three minutes between the hours of 9 p.m. and 3 a.m.

People smoking or waiting for a bus or taxi would be exempted, and police would have to issue a warning before citing a loiterer.

The legislation also would require promoters who hold two or more events at nightclubs within any given year to obtain a permit.

As it is now, the mayor said, "fly-by-night" promoters come and go without anybody keeping track of them. Permits would enable the Police Department and other city agencies to know who is responsible for an event in the case of a security breach or health violation.

In addition, the legislation would grant emergency powers to the director of the city Entertainment Commission to suspend permits for safety or noise violations. If a promoter planned an event for Friday and Saturday nights and the Friday night party got out of hand, the director could unilaterally cancel the Saturday night event.

Finally, the legislation would require nightclubs with extended hours - usually from 2 to 6 a.m. - to produce security plans to be approved by the director of the Entertainment Commission.

Four homicides occurred outside nightclubs in 2007, and there have been two more this year. Fifteen percent of all assaults in the city take place in or around nightclubs, the mayor's office said.

The Mayor's Office of Criminal Justice convened a special meeting in January on the issue, and representatives from 250 live music venues, nightclubs and comedy clubs attended and helped craft the legislation.

The announcement Thursday was similar to one made by the mayor in the fall of 2006, when he outlined new safety crackdowns along the Broadway corridor in North Beach, where fights, muggings and underage drinking were all increasing.

At that time, he announced there would be extra police officers patrolling the neighborhood. Also, the Sheriff's Department would have a van stationed there to transport people who were arrested to the County Jail, and authorities would visit nightclubs to ensure that alcohol laws and noise ordinances were being obeyed.

"We're very successful there, but it's just very labor-intensive," Newsom said, noting that the Broadway efforts will continue but that the new legislation would bolster the city's efforts to crack down on violence.

Brit Hahn, owner of City Nights and Club Envy, both in the South of Market neighborhood, and Rouge in North Beach, said he supports the new legislation.
He said more people are coming to his clubs - not to pay the cover charge and party inside, but to hang out on the street outside or in adjacent alleys. He said they break into cars, start fights and bother people waiting in line.

"The city and the industry need tools to deal with what's been a growing problem in the past few years," he said.

To: undisclosed-recipients:  ;

Hi all,

On Monday, I'm doing a radio show about first time voters. For younger
voters, how does it feel to vote for the first time? For older voters,
what got you to the polls? And what will it take to engage these new
voters in the political process after the election? Will they stay
involved?

We're hoping to hear from first time voters of all ages.

We'll also be speaking with a few of the students from Texas who
walked 7.3 miles to vote a few weeks ago:
http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/politics/5552259.html

The show airs from 11 am - noon PST this Monday on KALW 91.7 FM. You
can also listen online at: http://www.yourcallradio.org/

Please send this to friends, family, or co-workers who are voting for
the first time. We'll also take calls from people who want to talk
about their first time voting experience.

Thanks,
Rose

Ended up not being able to get to the after, sorry I missed you guys.

So, I saw a couple of folks there that I recognized and got some very
positive feedback but I don't know all your emails, so a very public
thank you to everyone who came.  Got a few new folks who lamented "lack"
of techno(as in, they didn't know about most of the parties!), I happily
mentioned a couple of the other parties and think our audience has expanded
a bit, so maybe instead of 30 techno fans there are 33 now. ;)

Oh, and I'm proud to say I got one memorable criticism saying I need to
book more electro-house, so I must be doing something right. ;)  I think
she stumbled across to club six for hip-hop, and wish her well in life. =)

Definitely reaffirms my feeling that, while we don't want to intentionally
poach each other, there's plenty of room for all of us even with multiple
yumminess on the same night, we all just need to get better at what we're
doing and enjoy the return of hopping. =)

Ray

promoters claiming dates has always been around its just never been 
said. but i think the confusion arises when we all don't know what is 
happening and nobody promotes in advance. like if i was booking local 
talent techno night i wouldn't for sure book it on the same night as my 
friend's parties. i look at it this way,  if you were throwing an event 
that you tried REALLY hard  to just break even and its in the east bay, 
and then at the same time, there were two parties YOU would rather be at 
in the city on the same night.. it kind of tends to piss you off. `;P

in regards to terry's wiki calendar... i'm not sure it will work, -as a 
wiki. you would need a form and a living person to actually approve a 
posting. a human being with a yes no system would work.. the 'robots' 
aren't that great at managing websites just yet.  i like the idea of the 
calendar starting up again mostly because i don't have to sit around 
here waiting for a great party to show up and listen to NRRs all day. 
not that i don't enjoy the art of lock bumping (explains why so many 
kyptonite locks are still around locked to things) or you guys company, 
i just would like a quick reference guide. also i remember in high 
school when i would print the sfr calendar out and just scan the thing 
over and over and drool at the possibilities. oooh dutch, simon and tony 
[homer simpson drooling noises].. a single line of info with not too 
much mention of anything....oooh looks like an underground!!

the calendar would assist people in knowing what and who the competition 
was on a particular night.  if it was a  skills massive you were going 
up against or if it was a party your friend who forgot to flyer you for. 
also i think i'm missing alot of great parties out there. it would be 
nice to know who was doing what.. like a veritable 'who's who.' if there 
were up and coming DJs you could see them start to creep up on more 
calendar entries and you could investigate them.. or if there were radio 
shows like 'epiphany of sound' people could look them up easier.

my opinion of why the calendar died i think stems from the time when 
cops were pretty wise to the sfr calendar and people were paranoid about 
lurkers seeing open information on the web.. not to say it still doesn't 
happen in this forum but having a calendar with some security might be 
in order. or two calendars. one open and one secret..? maybe that was a 
dilemma that was never solved in the early incarnation of the calendar..

in regards to there being SO many people into EDM here.. well no, there 
aren't. not the ones that would come out that aren't jaded by the scene. 
it takes alot of motivation and persuasion for somebody to leave their 
house and take up car keys and drive to lodi for an outdoor party these 
days. so if you're trying to win a particular crowd and you know your 
audience pretty well, they won't go to your party if you're trying to 
rep the local scene when they know some headliner they'll never see 
again is in town. my experience tells me that this scene (i.e. the 
people that actually come out) is usually at either one party a week or 
another and that's the way its always been. that is, unless the parties 
are in really far off places in the bay.

Maybe if more promoters sucked up their big fat egos to work with other one=
s when they found that they were both planning "competing" events on the sa=
me night, we'd see different results.

How many awesome parties happened last year that were multi-promoter events=
 that were friggin' awesome? Quite a few.

Farmer, rave organizer fined for disorderly conduct
By LAWRENCE SUSSMAN
lsussman@journalsentinel.com
Posted: Feb. 26, 2008

Port Washington - An Ozaukee County circuit judge Monday found a Town  
of Belgium farmer and an event organizer who held a rave party on a 90- 
acre dairy farm in September guilty of disorderly conduct.

Farmer Dennis W. Dahm has held outdoor parties at his farm for at  
least five years. During Labor Day weekend last year, the Ozaukee  
County Sheriff's Department closed down the party after two nights and  
cited Dahm and one of the organizers, Christopher A. Grant, on  
suspicion of disorderly conduct.

Last fall, the Town of Belgium sued Dahm, asking that the parties be  
declared public nuisances and permanently banned. That case is pending.

During Monday's trial, James J. Manders and Barbara Graham, who live  
about a half-mile from Dahm's farm, testified that "rhythmic thumping"  
from the party kept them awake after midnight Sept. 1.

They said a "pounding electric kind of music" rattled their windows,  
and disc jockeys at the party shouting "let's rock the (expletive)  
house" could be heard by their granddaughter in their house, which had  
the windows closed and the air conditioning on.

"If it's sufficient to rattle the windows half a mile away, that's as  
disorderly as you can get," Circuit Judge Tom R. Wolfgram said. "There  
was a certain amount of vulgarity going on. . . . It did tend to  
create a disturbance in their home. Their granddaughter heard  
persistent noise."

Dahm did not attend the trial. Wolfgram found him guilty by default  
and fined him $186.

Wolfgram found Grant, 26, of Milwaukee, guilty of two counts of  
disorderly conduct, and fined him $186 on each count.

After the trial, Grant said he has no plans to hold a rave party at  
the Dahm farm this year. A rave party is an all-night dance in which  
disc jockeys and other performers use synthesizers, drums and  
electronic music equipment.

In the lawsuit, the town is seeking a permanent injunction that would  
stop "musical festivals" from being held on Dahm's farm.

Dahm could not be reached for comment.

Don't these farmers grow anything besides beets?

The beet is the most intense of vegetables. The radish, admittedly, is the 
more feverish, but the fire of the radish is a cold fire, the fire of 
discontent not passion. Tomatoes are lusty enough, yet there runs through 
tomatoes an undercurrent of frivolity. Beets are deadly serious.

Farmers and music, a combination that goes together like peanut butter and
chocolate.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Farmer, rave organizer fined for disorderly conduct



really, if I could get a venue that big for $186, where the noise
ordinance metric was a HALF MILE, I think I could make a go of it. =)
Heck, we could have monthly music fests and all of us could have
our own camps, everyone could just hop around. =) =)

Subject: Re: [sfraves] nrr: What Money Is - Money As Debt

I ended up watching the whole thing, though I intended to only watch  
maybe the first 10 minutes or so.  It's good information, with the  
same suggestion for a solution as The Money Masters series, which if  
you haven't seen those, you should block out 3 1/2 hours this week  
and go to google video and have a notepad, and I would also add if  
you like these videos to support them and buy the DVD, I actually  
bought that one it was so good.  Jekyll Island is best for giving the  
background in detail and especially how it's connected to throwing  
the educational system to scrub it to the advantage of the bankers.

Anyway I got to run to school but check this video out and Money  
Masters and get Jekyll Island, if anyone is interested in bulk  
ordering I think you get a discount on like 4 of them so think about  
it we can make it happen together.

I love Reese's:)  But Woodstock...  I was young, hung and full of  
cum.  There was rock, drugs and sex.  And I never experienced that  
feeling of unity, the One, on quite that level again.  Of course it  
might have been the acid:)  I consider myself lucky to have been alive  
in the sixties/seventies.  Some days I feel myself to be a stranger in  
a strange land in the 21st century.

BTW I met Max.  Cool dude.

Love,

Apollo

Please tune in to KZSU by listening to 90.1 in the Bay Area or pointing
your web browser to http://kzsulive.stanford.edu.

If you're interested in guest appearing on any of our shows
or having a mix featured contact us using our email addresses
or: electronicadjs@kzsu.stanford.edu

This week we'll have ticket give aways for the ForwardSF and
Dirtybird 3rd Anniversary parties happening in San Francisco
on Saturday, March 8th. Be sure to tune in!

We're getting plans together for the Spring Equinox 24 hour
electronic music marathon. More details soon!

Big Love Show with Jack Wang - Mondays 3PM-6PM PST (11PM UTC)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

This week Jack is proud to host DJ Adnan from ForwardSF joined by Guada
from Mexico and Sayaka from Japan. More information about Adnan and
this weekend's party can be found at:
http://www.forwardsf.com/

The mix starts up in a few hours with techno, house, and other electronica.

Epiphany of Sound with J.C. - Thursday 9AM-12PM PST (5PM UTC)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

After 14 years, DJ J.C.'s techno/house/electronica showcase has
garnered much attention and devotion. Like most folks at Stanford's
radio station, he's a volunteer, proving that his motivation isn't
a paycheck; it's his passion to share his interest in one of music's
most eclectic genres. With his conversational style, inclusion of
producers and musicians from both the local & international scene,
and his stewardship of the station's 24-hour marathons during
Solstices and Equinoxes, it's no wonder that DJ J.C has made a
connection with listeners in a very crowded market. Catch his live
broadcasts or listen to the previous week's program at underheard.org.

J.C. will email this week if he has an update on any guests.

Thanks for your support!!!

Subject: [sfraves] BSP: Yuri's Night 2008 @ Moffett Field

Hey guys, it's happening again this year, come check it out
it'll be fun!

http://www.yurisnightbayarea.com

Taking place at Hangar 211, NASA Ames Reserch Center

More Than a Festival...

Come to Yuri's Night Bay Area to kick back, celebrate, and 
dance, but also be ready to learn, interact, and think! You 
could think of Yuri's Night as a fusion of a technology expo, a 
Maker Faire, an art exhibition, and a music festival, all rolled into one.

Yuri's Night Bay Area 2008 includes:

     * A world-class lineup of musical artists, ranging from the 
ethereal breakbeat sounds of Tipper to Telstar, with Phil Lesh 
of the Grateful Dead.
     * A mind-expanding series of speakers, from NASA scientists 
to video-game designers to Bay Area entrepreneurs.
     * Live performances of all kinds, from dance and acrobatics 
by Capacitor to aerial demonstrations featuring Yuri-Gagarin-era 
aerobatic aircraft.
     * Dozens of art and science installations, including 
everything from NASA research robots to the unveiling of the 
newest fire sculpture by the Flaming Lotus Girls.
     * A chance to talk to each other
and to some of our speakers, artists, scientists, and performers
about the big questions in or Festival of Ideas.
     * ...and much, much more!

Music

This year we are expanding our musical offerings to include TWO 
FULL STAGES, which means more performers and more variety. Check 
back frequently for updates about this year's musical line-up. 
Here's an initial list of some of our amazing musical 
performers:

I have to say, the electronic music was a little more represented last year,

the symbiosis folks will do a better job with promoting this year too!

The tarmac goes right up to the bay, so it's free if you can

Subject: Re: [sfraves] BSP: Yuri's Night 2008 @ Moffett Field

... good point THIS IS NOT an UG rave!! This is on
Federal land and guess what that means for any
partaking of anything.... people be careful!!
I heard last years party closed early for rain or
whatever...the concept is awesome the lineup is
great... the location sucks big time...
Maybe Yuri's night should hook up an after party
somewhere else on hhhhmmmmmm...private property?!@$#%

And you're the reason artists can't afford to live in this country and events are of low production quality.  Production costs go up and the market deals with it or highly cuts the quality of the events, musicians try to get by and this community craps on them.

Is there a "rub & tug" with that price?? lol

Geez. I knwo there are bands there and whatnot, but...I dunno - I just feel 
like prices of music events like this are fuggin' outrageous these days.

I dunno - coming from the days of seeing events like Lollapalooza where =
there were no less than 10 headlining major label bands, for around $25 =
- $30 a ticket, with MUCH higher production value than the typical rave, =
I am gonna disagree.=20

I understand inflation has an effect on things, but if a venue costs so =
much that you have to charge exorbitant prices for tickets, not to =
mention all the hidden "service" fees, then maybe it's time to start =
looking into other locations.=20

But - having played in bands (touring and otherwise) and having DJ'd for =
a number of years, as well as having been to (and paid for) more =
concerts in my lifetime than most average folks can say they have =
(roughly 4 - 5 shows per week for about 12 + years of my life), I am =
pretty sure that *I* am not the reason artists can't afford to live in =
this country, etc.=20

A-ny-way.

Half the reason I'm going is specifically because it's at NASA.
 Also for the snipers.

"The location sucks big time"

You my friend, have obviously not been to the NASA AMES facilities at
Moffett Field.  It is quite the contrary, it kicks ass, and is one of the
most awesome venues I've ever seen.  There were scares last year about
security since it is a federally ran facility, but quite honestly, we were
able to drink alcohol in the parking lot with no problem.  And once in the
party, security was near invisible.  Maybe you should check out this party
before trying to rip it.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] BSP: Yuri's Night 2008 @ Moffett Field

I said that "the location sucks big time" let me add
(the event does not suck!! this is an awesome event
with great talent but...)

One quick correction I used to work on the facility at
Moffett Field - so I believe I know the location quite
well... in addition I know some artists who played out
last year - that's were I got my opinion from...

You were able to drink Alcohol in the parking lot for
$40, I want to drink on the dance floor without having
to conceal ... also I don't refer to drinking as what
you need to worry about! You get caught with the wrong
substance on that lot and you'll be replaying
'Grooveriders Dubai deal' ala US Federal style...

Look my intention is not to put this event down or to
shame... this is a VERY COOL event it just could be
soooo much cooler not in NASA.

Many people refer to any period where people are allowed to do what they
don't want those people doing it as anarchy. =)

It's not his lack of history, it's his perspective that doesn't recognize
Feudalism and fiefdoms as their own form of government.  Even your basic
village geritocracy is a form of government, as is your traditional king
of the hill/alpha dog.  Warring fiefdoms are no different than warring
nations or continents.  It's a matter of scale, not the existence of
government.

No government doesn't lead to anarchy at all.  It leads to new government.

Anarchists tend to be idealists who somehow believe that if individuals
just refuse to submit to any authority things will all work out... Which
tends to overlook that most sheeple won't do any such thing.  People tend
to gravitate towards the government that most resembles the one they
recall while growing up if they had a good childhood, or the one they
grew up with the impression would have helped them.  There's little reason
in this behavioral pattern, people simply hear only as much as they need to
reinforce their political prejudice.

Now will someone invoke Godwins law and end this thread too? =)

Ray

Anyone who doesn't recognize feudalism as a valid form of government is

Hahaha, pinkko is laughs. Think deep people! You can not cover eveything in=
 one small email post but pinkko does... oh i forgot "and feudalism"
=20
We can not all be as smart and successful as PinkKo...=20
=20
Now that we are getting real what is up with the dogging of parties??? As i=
t is the electronic scene or anyone that actually gives a crap about electr=
onic music is not that big of a scene in general. Of course people are goin=
g to disagree but think of the bigger picture. Think about it compared to h=
ip-hop or rock. Artists are supported in the electronic scene but people al=
ways have so much negativity if they make it big or for the music they play=
. Maybe that is why some poeple are attracted to the electronic scene becau=
se it is small. Some events do not always work for me because I like to go =
out and not only listen to good music but meet sexy ass girls so I want a p=
acked happy non-shady event with alot of people. All I can say is I am not =
a DJ nor do I want to be but I think many people on this site seem like coo=
l people that provide some funny email drama. I would love to meet some of =
you SFRave people sometime.

>>In the beginning, there was Jack, and Jack had a groove. And from this groove came the groove of all grooves.And while one day viciously throwing down on his box, Jack boldy declared,  "Let there be HOUSE!" and house music was born."I am, you see, I am the creator, and this is my house!And, in my house there is ONLY house music.But, I am not so selfish because once you enter my house it then becomes OUR house and OUR house music!"And, you see, no one man owns house because house music is a universal language, spoken and understood by all. You see, house is a feeling that no one can understand really unless  you're deep into the vibe of house.House is an uncontrollable desire to jack your body.And, as I told you before, this is our house and our house music.And in every house, you  understand, there is a keeper.And, in this house, the keeper is Jack.Now some of you who might wonder, "Who is Jack, and what is it that Jack does?"Jack is the one who gives you the power to
 jack your body! Jack is the one who gives you the power to do the snake.Jack is the one who gives you the   key to the wiggly worm. Jack is the one who learns you how to walk your body. Jack is the one that can bring nations and nations of all Jackers together under one house.You may be     black, you may be white; you may be Jew or Gentile. It don't make a     difference in OUR House.  And this is fresh.>>>

Subject: Re: [sfraves] (nrr) QOD (Tue)

This is a good discussion, one I want to touch on more.  I don't know =20=

that we could categorize civil disobedience as strictly something =20
that an anarchist does.  An anarchist to me simply believes there =20
should be no government and anything the public would share is sort =20
of left to individual theory, but the obvious implications would be =20
things like roads would be privately owned and maintained.

Fedualism is where the elites own everything, which is why people =20
like Alex Jones call globalism "neo-feudalism" or "neo-mercantilism", =20=

mercantilism being government's attempt to claim they own everything, =20=

and we do live in an age where they are pretty damn bold to come out =20
and say you can't smoke on your own property, or you can't have raves =20=

at the beach.  Really, says who?

I would propose that people who choose civil disobedience come from =20
all walks of life and simply decide that a particular law or rule =20
simply does not sit well with them, so they're not going to obey it.  =20=

If it's just one person, they can generally be carted off to prison =20
while everyone else sits in either fear or ignorance.  But imagine if =20=

not only Sunset decided to start doing Berkeley Marina parties every =20
Sunday, but the other past and present rave related families decided =20
"fuck the permit crap" and there were literally thousands of ravers =20
on every beach, and everywhere the police turned to confiscate one =20
sound system there were 10 more.

That's a lot of ravers, that unfortunately many have moved on, but I =20
would propose a lot of people miss those days.  The Boston Tea Party =20
happened for a reason, and we should ask ourselves, what will be the =20
2008 and beyond equivalent?

Can you visit this place?
Can you visit this place?
Can you visit this place?

A place where music is our sanctuary, our life, where it defines our every move, where notes and measures are as important as air, water, and oxygen, a place where movement is a winding road that leads to the most beautiful rainbow of people of all colors and races, driven by one beautiful soundscape.

If you can see this place, then we can be this place, we can make this dream our reality, keep music first in your heart, keep in a sacred place, keep it free of all contempt, free of opinion.

Make it longer, stronger, better, faster.
Make it so it will never die.
Make it for a new generation.

Can you visit our place?
Can you visit THAT place?

A place where music is more important than the DJ, the promoter, the venue, the producer, your clique, your wardrobe, what your man said, what your woman said, what's hot, what's not.

Can you see this place?

Can you be this place?

Yo everybody.

First off, wanted to say thanks to everyone who made it out to [KONTROL] on
Saturday.  We had a great turnout (some of our best numbers yet according to
the Endup) and I have to say there was a particularily fat vibe for this
one!  And of course Claude VonStroke and Derek Plaslaiko both killed it!  So
thanks again to all that came out and got your groove on with us.

More importantly, I wanted to tip y'all off to a special guest who will be
playing at "Lil' Brthr" tonight @ 222 Hyde.  Yep, none other than Saturday's
hero himself, Mr. Derek Plaslaiko.  Seeing as his schedule got bumped around
a bit, he's still in town tonight, and after his sick 2 1/2 hour set at the
Endup which covered everything from house to techno to acid to minimal and
beyond, who could resist a second helping?

Hence he's been invited down as a special surprise guest tonight at this
FREE monthly gathering.  The rest of the lineup is solid as well, with
Worthy (dirtybird), Eo (Mouth2Mouth), Roman Stange (Auralism) and more
supporting.

I don't go out too often on the weeknights these days, but I'm making an
exception tonight. :)

Perhaps I'll see you there?

Subject: Re: [sfraves] RR: For those who STILL don't know Jack

house has merit but its all the hundreds and hundreds of people who 
think they're house producers that make it such a pain to listen to 
IMHO. also i've always found house too easy to dj.. it kind of feels 
like i could stand there and i'm like 'uhh now what..?' (looking at watch)

i'm not fronting on house at all.. afterall its house that built the 
scene here in SF (albeit maybe too well...) and good tracks and house 
djs like derrick carter terry francis have rocked my world at one point 
or another. and i can't recall how many times when i was a wee young 
sprout of a raver losing my ship to simon and dj tracy.. actually one of 
my favorite dj mixes of all times is dj jazzy jeff doing doubles of 
house records! so f'n good.. i think what beat that was dave clarke 
doing doubles of hard techno `;P***** at i love techno.. um 2000?

peace, love, techno

Sean.

"Why I'm shocked!!!  Interest in (Bloc Party) on this list:)"

If you like that Boyz Noize Banquet remix (I've always been partial  
to the Phones Disco Edit) you might dig the Speaker Junk Bass Bin  
Remix of I Still Remember or Hunting For Witches (Ruckus Roboticus  
Remix).

Oh yeah -- SMD's Hustler (and pretty much the whole of "Attack Decay  
Sustain Release") is indeed good times.

Be good.

Brien.

me too, I'd almost go even if there were no music just cause I love space
and airplanes (obsessed since i was 7, at which point it became my ongoing
life goal to become an astronaut).

as far as security, if one were to show up already under the influence but
carrying nothing illegal is that still a significant risk?  I've seen such
wildly varying versions of security at government installations/bases that I
make no assumptions that just having nothing illegal on you means you're
safe.

yea i'm just not sure, is this more something that NASA just wanted  
to do to celebrate life on its own, or is this more like a government  
approved rave party?  i'm trying to figure this out.

I passed that a long time ago Sean.  For the record, I was mopping my kitchen while listening and not drinking an umbrella drink on the beach unfortunately.  

Although really a really strong umbrella drink is always a good idea.  Sometimes people forget SF is a beach town...play hookey and head out to the beach with an umbrella drink today!

Peace,

Peter

PS I used the term deep to refer to the track's sound not so much what section of bins you'd find it in at Tweekin.  The mix progressed into some funky house that was bringing me back to the SF underground house sound of Panhandle Records circa 2001.  Very hot!

PPS DJ Stevian is one of my DJ heros for producing a mix that included tracks from both Primus and (yes I know they are deep house) Crazy Penis.

Your description does absolutely nothing to encourage my dream of early
retirement. I had this vision of smooth fiberglass decks that stretched into
infinity, doing my old man slide in tube socks at 118bpm.

I will listen to your silly music, however.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] nrr: Moses was high on drugs: Israeli researcher

This might be interesting if the person insinuating this came up with some 
examples of possible drug "culprits" that would have induced said 
hallucinations. Ayahuasca is a bad example because it's only indigineous to 
the Amazon basin (as far as I am aware).

I don know that there is "word on the street" (by way of Discovery channel) 
that says that there have been trace elements of cocaine found in some 
Egyptian Pharoah mummies....and that is clearly ONLY indigineous to South 
America - so it's POSSIBLE that Ayahuasca made it's way to that part of the 
world, but not very likely.

Maybe they were chewing on Kot or something? At any rate, I'd be much more 
impressed with this claim if the guy had backed up his claim with more info.

Baby Beheaded in Saudi Supermarket

An Enraged Uncle Beheaded an 15-Month-Old Baby in Front of Mother
On Sunday morning a 25-year-old Syrian man beheaded his 15-month-old nephew 
at Al-Marhaba supermarket, Arab News reported. The man reportedly killed the 
child after an argument with his sister and brother-in-law.

This is the latest in a handful of criminal justice cases in Saudi Arabia 
that have grabbed Western attention in the last year.

In December 2008 a Saudi Arabian rape victim was charged with jail time and 
200 lashes after being found in a car with a man to whom she was not 
related - a verdict that prompted international outrage from Human Rights 
Watch and other foreign observers, including the White House and U.S. 
presidential contenders Sen. Hilary Clinton and Sen. Barack Obama. The 
woman, known anonymously in the Saudi press as "Qatif Girl" was eventually 
released from jail and later pardoned by Saudi King Abdullah.

Fawza Falih, a Saudi woman, is currently awaiting execution after being 
found guilty of witchcraft in 2005. Dozens of Saudi men were arrested last 
month for allegedly flirting with women in front of a shopping mall in 
Mecca. In January, a woman was arrested after having a Starbucks coffee with 
a male business colleague.

 Expo

It's all of the above:

A NASA-backed, government approved, rave party...well 
"festival".

We were on crew last year, so we had 2 handles of liquor under 
the VJ table, we were just very careful how we dispersed it. 
There were beer vendor but the lines were long and they ran out 
early.

There were some other substances that surfaced too, but that was 
handled with the upmost discretion.

Don't know what to say about those who like to smoke doobies, 
that's hard to hide (but people still did it), and smoking 
cigarettes....they will kick you out for smoking 1 foot in the 
hangar.

And yeah, watch out for the snipers ;-)

Oh well, still fun for me, see ya there!

One other thing about the party last year was that most of the music  
was ambient or beatless, with the exceptions of plaid, glitch mob,  
and the unimog.

found all over the world, in fact DMT is found in some level in just about

my plan so far for the 14th is Audion and John Tejada at Mighty. I don't

Correction: It's Miguel Migs & Mark Farina on Friday. Guess Dan is playing March 
13th at Vessel, then Kevin Saunderson is playing on the 14th at 1015.

So there again.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] RR: For those who STILL don't know Jack

ok, controversy is good, it staves off boredom. ok let me clarify.. i 
like techno because its happens to have alot of drum programming that is 
based on inferred rhythms whereas house is the same rhythm most of the 
time.. which makes it predictable to me. i like house, i just find it 
too predictable for me to dj. but that's just my opinion.. i also stated 
that there are good and bad examples of every genre.

i never said that dave clarke was a great DJ but i would suggest 
listening to that i love techno mix (it seemed pretty on to me. maybe 
every other time he djs he just sucks?).. in that mix he was playing 
doubles in off time which could be confused as wrecking..? but i haven't 
heard your mix and possibly you haven't heard the mix i was speaking of. 
so we could both be right.. who knows?

you know i also find downtempo the most difficult to mix.. so many 
different tricks you have to do to just keep two records on beat. i once 
fantasized about retiring as a downtempo dj. so many layering 
opportunities and ways to be creative. so there's that, and i also have 
a strange fondness for speaker worshippers and people in extremely 
altered states.

ok so all is good in the world. no hissy fighting about my genre can 
beat up your genre.

I believe there's reference to him playing some sort of downtempo or ambient at this coming event.  (BSP maybe?  I read it somewhere)

Subject: RE: [sfraves] RR: For those who STILL don't know Jack


No, no fighting about genres, lol. Sorry if it came off like that. I have j=
ust heard that about house and breaks a ton of times, and I guess it has al=
ways amused me because I have always had an easy time playing techno (and m=
ost other EDM genres), and I'm not the greatest DJ, so it baffles me.=20

But the Dave Clarke thing....dear god, seriously, I have heard a few mixes =
of his that are aiight, granted, but the two times I have seen him spin, he=
 trainwrecked so many times, it was seriously perturbing. Both times on a 1=
00,000 watt EAW Phazon (or was it an Avalon) system. At any rate - BAD.

Well damn Sean....let's both retire as downtempo DJ's! I have kinda felt th=
e same way for a while now, hehe.=20

And to make this not only RR, but SFRR - I completely blame Redstickman for=
 my obsession with downtempo. Not that the Ninja Tune dj's haven't had a pr=
ofound effect on me, but something about Sticky's mixes just resonated with=
 me the right way....definitely one of my favorite DJ's.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] BSP: Yuri's Night Bay Area 2007 - A Space and Sound Expo

It seemed to me that the party last year was intended to not be a  
dance party or even a rave. The music was not danceable. If would not  
expect Tipper to drop electro this time around unless the producers  
have changed their tune and want dancing this time around.

Subject: [sfraves] BSP~::Radio Integrated Play Schedule for March::~PSB

This Month /// March, 7th-28th 2008 /// 9pm-1am Pacific Standard Time ///

http://radio.defsf.com:1200/ <http://www.zer01.net:1200/>


DEFsf.com's Radio Integrated Marches on in March. We've been bringing 
you solid techno from all styles and sub genres of Techno without 
slacking on the talent, quality or excessive intoxication this side of 
the computer speakers each and every friday for the last 3 months. March 
looks like its going to be no exception to the rule.. with some 
satisfaction is is our pleasure to introduce this month's Radio 
Integrated line up:


*7 March//  keepin it real night. W/ DJS: Clairity, CALTROP

Keeping it real with DJs Clarity and Caltrop. Clarity is a
longtime SF techno favorite who played some records at the very first
DEF event, and we are stoked to welcome her back. A former resident of
SF electro club Tokyo Electric, Caltrop is an eclectic and creative DJ
who always keeps it groovin' with his mix of minimal, electro, house,
disco, acid, from the old school to the new school.

*14 March// "I Bleed Techno" sneak peak. W/ DJS: Disconnect, Covert

 DJ Disconnect (whoever that is) and DJ Covert will be bringing you a 
little taste of what they have in store for you at the following night's 
I Bleed Techno soiree on march 15th.. stay tuned for details.

*21 March// Techno Soul edition W/DJS: ML Tronic AKA Monty Luke, James Bass

Monty has been busting the doors down at clubs as of late and been 
basically blowing up the scene everywhere he goes. His mixing is dope, 
his tracks are on point... in short, ML Tronic is a force to be reckoned 
with! James Bass has been hibernating in Berlin for the last few months, 
but previous to that has had success in throwing his bassaholics 
anonymous parties including a one infamous underground party featuring 
DJ Bone. We look forward to hearing what fresh tracks he has in store 
for us from Bear-lin

*28 March// 420 Techno night W/ DJS: The Rhythmist, and Andy W

    Derrick the Rhythmist is one of the forerunners of the San Jose 
Techno Scene and continues to shape its ever changing sound with his 
label Dobox Recordings. His mixing is smooth and his record selection is 
fresh and is by far one of the most down to earth and passionate guys 
you'll meet in techno in the bay. Andy W has been there and back and 
held up his end of the techno scene for more than a decade. Known for 
his sets at the Cloudfactory parties, FnF parties, Harmony parties, DEF 
parties and, dare i say it, even Skills parties when they were playing 
techno, Andy has been one of the bastions of techno in the bay area and 
kept it real. We're looking forward to a Dj set by one of the people 
that continues to remain synonymous with techno in the bay area, Andy W!

Subject: Re: [sfraves] BSP:  Yuri's Night Bay Area 2007 - A Space and Sound Expo

Honestly, I thought they had things backwards- mainly swirly non-danceable music blasting out of the big system, inside the awesome hangar with the great visuals, and the one bastion of:

"FUCK!  It is freezing, I need to stay warm, I MUST DANCE TO LIVE!"

...was outside at the Unimog!  I generally don't get excited about the Cowboys, just too many dumb hip-hop breaks mashes, but fuck if I wasn't out by that truck half the night, grooooovin' away the icicles.

I would far rather have had a big, nice, central place to dance and freak out, and then have found various smaller (ambient, downtempo) soundsystems out on the field.

Then again, there may be a method to that madness.  Dance music is largely more divisive than non-dance oriented electronic music.  Most people can at least tolerate ambient, and it's tough not to enjoy a little downtempo, but get one Psy dickweed or one Happy Hard Handbag jerkoff up on the big system and half the party's gonna jet.  ;)

(and the other half'll jet when some techno or electro gets up there)

Who knows, anyhow I would like to officially state that I'd like to see 1500 people dancing, rather than kicking back, in that hangar this year.

Yeah, I like beats a lot more than beatless... would much rather see Tipper play electro than ambient.

was ambient or beatless, with the exceptions of plaid, glitch mob,

--

The alienation effect in German epic theater is achieved not only  
through the actors, but also through music (chorus and song) and sets  
(transparencies, film strips, etc.). Its main purpose is to place the  
staged events in their historical context.

- Bertolt Brecht

Subject: [sfraves] BSP: FAKTION: Friday, 28 March: Cesare vs Disorder



2008 is rapidly shaping up to be a great year for Techno.  Just this month
the WMC is attracting much more excitement than ever before, including some
great talent.  Cesare vs Disorder is coming to the US for the first time ever.
And, what started as a quick East Coast visit (Miami and NYC) becomes a
whirlwind cross-country as he comes to the FAKTION for this exclusive West
Coast appearance!  Combined with our own multitalented DJ SAYAKA, this will
be one great party!

Friday, 28 March, 2008

RAY presents: 

F A K T I O N : because san francisco needs another techno cult
with special guests and extended sets:

Friday, 28 March 2008:
Cesare vs Disorder - Essential Reload [ Italy|UK ] 
DJ SAYAKA - BABD/Faktion [ Japan|San Francisco ]

Last Fridays @ Anu

Cesare vs Disorder:
London based, Italian born DJ, music producer, creative Cesare Marchese aka
Cesare vs Disorder (also "Queen AtOm") has been involved in the european
underground music scene for the last 10 years.  His skills and passion for
DJing has taken him around Italy, to Berlin, Poland, Finland, Switzerland,
Brazil, and of course his current home in the UK, where he continues to
also produce, having formed EssentialReload and newborn labels MEAN and
SERIALISM.

This is Cesare vs Disorder's ONLY scheduled West Coast appearance before
he returns to London, nestled in between his appearances in Miami and NYC.
Don't miss out!

DJ SAYAKA is known around the world for her consistent mastery of always
difficult downtempo, medodic techno, flawless track track selection and
natural progression.  Recently returned from her own globe-trecking gigs,
including NYC and Tokyo, it's our good fortune she's called San Francisco
home since 2004.

i just had a thought.. it would be interesting if they did just have 
several small soundsytems banging away at different ends of the field. 
that way people could bring their parkas and burner bikes and just ride 
around blinking away on the tarmac. sounds like fun to me.

I think Burningman is cool, but have no delusions that it's somehow 'green.' I really find it sort of annoying when people try to spin it that way.  It's the same pseudo-liberal bs that this area is known for. :)

Dodgson's Alice crawl down the rabbit hole voluntarily in pursuit of the =
white rabbit. It is very clear that Dodgson, who assumed the magickally =

responsibility involved in wielding a name of power, was heavily =
influenced by the written works of 21st century Man of Knowledge, Robert =
Anton Wilson..."

Yes, they were sterscopic, but previously was all on film at slow frames rates causing people to fall asleep. The stuff now is Digital @ high-frame rates. I'm telling you, the shit the was pretty sick! All it need now is some kind of air blowing in your face in synch and you would have probably have fallen on your ass at this rave.

... and I feel sort of bad about saying this ... my belief is at the
end of the day that the people who only get their information from the
television screen are going to have to change once everything on the
television screen changes.  So we have to deal with the people who
decide what is on the TV screen, first.  I mean, that's the conclusion
I've reached.  I mean, I think the average Westerner is just too far
deeply brainwashed now to be helped without changing the content of
the brainwashing they're being fed.

Only sleepy?!  Lucky no one hurled at lower frame rates.  Some people are particularly susceptible to these effects.

Remember, at least 60 Hz because everything else hurts!

What really cracks me up is the inclusion of 'excessive wealth' on that list

Crazy I could live with, but here's the question that'd make or break the
room for me: Is she hot? If so, is it only my friends she'd sleep with, or
would she also sleep with me?

Here's to crazy women, they always seem to be the best in bed. ;-)

The last 3 are all basically the same damn thing. The funny thing is, the 
Catholic church are one of the richest orginizations in the known world, and 
have some of the largest land holdings PERIOD.

I wonder if they realize they are helping damn themselves, lol.

Silly Christians!

I just DL'd - I will most likely peep it tomorrow on the ride to work...and 
methinks that tomorrow I will "medicate" before my commute so's I can give 
this a proper listen.

The TL looks insane, I am way psyched to hear this.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR The Vatican adds 7 new "social sins" to the list
 of deadly sins

i totally respect the original seven deadly sins because they were 
thought of and about for a very long period of time.. and didn't pop up 
out of social concerns overnight. more.. i believe they were a moral 
code that the church or the bible lacked to fight the most common faults 
of mankind. maybe if you look at these sins without the church involved 
they can be very well applied to everyone no matter what creed. i still 
believe the deadliest is pride.

especially when right wing militants talk about god, country, and 
american pride.

stay humble, i think the pride sin tells us, or risk becoming an 
asshole. and nobody likes an asshole.

i'm pretty sure these new social sins will be forgotten because they 
have essentially the same meaning as the 7 deadly sins in a new meaning.
* birth control can be curbed by the lust sin through abstenance
* drug abuse under gluttony
* pollution under sloth
* the last 3 under greed

not sure about the stemcell research thing.. but i'm sure that mankind 
messing with it's own longevity has held it back a little bit in the 
natural selection category. if you want to look at how penicillin has 
created superbacteria or how modern medicine has made it so common 
health flaws are socially acceptible. i mean look at me, i wear glasses. 
in a darwinian sense, i'm a genetic retard. i'm not about eugenics but 
if we put up with people like me for a longer period of time and my 
offspring were allowed to breed, i'd be weakening the collective gene 
pool. and lasek lazer vision correction surgeons will be making fortunes 
for generations to come. well 'thank god' for the genome project.

 * birth control can be curbed by the lust sin through abstenance

Or you could just get a vasectomy and fuck all you want without having to

Well, I felt skeptical when I read it.

Turns out the AP was wrong.  This was just an Archbishop's way of trying

http://ideasareathreat.blogspot.com/2008/03/7-social-sins-posted-about-yesterday.html

No wonder I don't pay attention to the mainstream media (even though I'd
hope AP would at least get it right.  Guess I'm wrong.)

Subject: Re: [sfraves] BSP: rasta22 - 2002-2008

Ok, so...I like the mix overall, but was actually kinda sad this was way 
more dubstep than dub. Mostly cuz I think 90% of all dubstep needs an MC to 
make it dynamic.

Yes, I said that - I think 90% of dubstep needs an MC. I know most folks 
know I loathe 95% of MC's out there, cuz they tend to ruin d&b, but I think 
they actually round out the dubstep sound quite nicely if they are any good 
as an MC.

Great mixing on this mix tho. Well done.

True catholics are too busy feeling guilty about their drug (and self)
abuse to put that association together.

What really cracks me up is the inclusion of 'excessive wealth' on that
list
of sins. I mean, come the fuck on guys, looked in the mirror lately?

Ok...again...not that I dislike dubstep, I just think it's a weak genre on

And get off the dubstep jock Alex, you know you're only into it cuz all the 
junglists are dubstep heads now. Trendy motherfucker.

Ok, so...I like the mix overall, but was actually kinda sad this was way 
more dubstep than dub. Mostly cuz I think 90% of all dubstep needs an MC to 
make it dynamic.

Yes, I said that - I think 90% of dubstep needs an MC. I know most folks 
know I loathe 95% of MC's out there, cuz they tend to ruin d&b, but I think 
they actually round out the dubstep sound quite nicely if they are any good 
as an MC.

Great mixing on this mix tho. Well done.

Try a low budget mix for yourself and see:

http://www.whalesong.net/sounds/07-03-22%20Whales.mp3

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFVHjZYoq4Q

Load the whalesong MP3 first in your browser and then you can go back and cue up any part off it.

I especially enjoy looping the bit of whale song near the end.  

Peter

Can whale songs communicate with the dolphin jazz of LTJ's atmospheric

Subject: [sfraves] (nrr) QOD (Thu)

I was thinking of starting Geri Dahl Thursdays, where I'd post as Geri  
Dahl for the day, but ah, well maybe Geri Dahl is a dinosaur now, a  
relic, an anomaly that we were somehow slightly annoyed by when she  
was around, but when she disappeared and never came back it was like a  
vaccum and in some way, a part of us left the virtual dance floor nrr.

Hey if you feel like donating to a 9/11 first responder that  
apparently no longer has his job with NYPD, go to  
http://www.wearechange.org .  I am of course wondering why he doesn't  
have a pension if he's disabled from the dust cloud.  Is this another  
example of the government chewing up our best and brightest and then  
discarding them on the street to fend for themselves when they're done  
with them?

--

Still be kind, and eke out our performance with your mind.

- Henry V

Also guy, the last two dubstep mixes I made where called Whales Humping and
Humping Whales, you don't think I know about the whale sounds vibe and get
down with it?

Goddamnit, one of these days, Marco, I'm gonna punch you in the face. :-)

If there's anyone that could be more readily described as 'the man' (other
than Cheney & co) I'd sure like to know who they are. . .

Well, Charles Taylor maybe. . .

This guy gets the quote of the week, in my book.  All the stuff I've  
been reading about and probably not doing a very good job talking  
about, but trying nonetheless.  Have a good weekend, and start  
planting the gardens in the backyard and get yourself a scooter to  
prepare for $6 - $7 a gallon gasoline and skyrocketing food prices.   
But we will survive, SFRavers, if we stick together on this.  And  
watch the video that goes with this quote.

I'd have added these 7 sins:

-Farting in an elevator

-Thinking you need to come to a complete stop to make
a right-hand turn whilst driving

-Playing the same record that the last DJ played at
the beginning of his set, but you don't know because
you just showed up at the party 5 minutes before your
set was to start

-Asking the question, "Is it hot enough for ya?"

-Answering the phone with "Ahoy hoy!"

-Quoting lines from movies you've never watched

-Watching American Idol (except to vote for Sanjaya)

Thinking you need to come to a complete stop to make
a right-hand turn whilst driving

If it's at a red light, you totally do. I got a 150 dollar ticket for not
stopping completely in a right on red type situation.

Sorry, I just had a wild hair and thought that was a funny comment when I read it. I could totally see how a post like that was troll bait (not to insinuate you guys are trolls), but both your points are well-taken. 
   
  There's some dope events going off this weekend! What's on your calanders?
   
  peace

it's simple, functional, and user-driven.

forum topics include events, production and performance, mixes and tracks,
etc.

should be a great resource for the Bay.

i have nothing to do with this, btw, but it looks promising so far.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR: torture

Isaac, it sounds like the discussions in your class didn't touch on  
the subject of government sponsored terrorism as a pretext to  
creating a false need for torture.  OK, I could be wrong, maybe you  
did, and I see from a second glance you're on the fence with this  
stuff, but a lot of people still have the ideology that the  
government won't abuse the power.  You see, it always starts with  
something that sounds reasonable.  And they mistakenly think that  
because they would never abuse the power and torture people, then  
neither would anyone else.  Not all Ted Bundy's are on death row.  A  
lot of them work for the government and are in exactly the kind of  
place where they can carry out their sick fantasies from a position  
of power, that my friend, is tyranny.

The problem is government tends to attract people that really should  
have no authority or power whatsoever.  Look at those cops that  
arrested a woman that called the police for help, then forcefully  
strip searched her, not even asking, just started ripping her clothes  
off.  Or the quadraplegic that was taken in for booking, and the  
deputy apparently didn't believe he was disabled, so she dumps him  
out of the wheelchair on the ground and tells him to get up, and is  
laughing.  All on videotape.  Look at what happened to Kevin  
Tillman.  And Khaleid Sheik Mohammed?  I would argue he was tortured  
so much and for so long that his entire case should be thrown out.   
Tasering.  I don't really want to go on, because it makes me  
completely ill to think about some of the stuff I've heard.  It's  
totally out of control.

Magna Carta and the U.S. Constitution were both literally from the  
blood of people who gave their lives because they had the guts to  
stand up to tyranny.  The reality is if it were you or I in the  
position of authority we might not even use those tactics, we might  
just "rough them up" a bit like you say.  But the problem is not  
everyone is like me and you.  There's a lot of people in military  
intelligence and even just the regular military that are like the  
Marine who killed that puppy and put it on his Myspace page, as if he  
were somehow unaccountable for his actions.  Right now the reality is  
there are total scum in the right places and they outnumber the good  
guys, who either get fired or quit in disgust.

So I don't know if that helps you understand why I think torture is  
just something that should never be validated for the good of  
everyone, including the people that carry out this "dirty work" that  
no one really wants to think about.  It's a whole lot easier to just  
not talk about it and think about this weekend's party, and I'm not  
saying it's bad to talk about that or music or whatever, I mean this  
is a rave related list, but if people don't talk about this stuff I  
think it's like driving around with bald tires or bad brakes and you  
know you don't have the money to fix it, but you keep driving it  
anyway, well what ends up happening is you pay more in the long run.

Anyway, I hope this helps out.  I've got finals so I'm making the big  
push I've got a 3,000 word essay due Wednesday (on a Star Trek  
episode, no less!) and a monologue performance on the same day, wish  
me luck!  Maybe I'll try to go out next weekend if something looks fun.

"There is suffering in life, and there are defeats. No one can avoid  
them. But it's better to lose some of the battles in the struggles for  
your dreams than to be defeated without ever knowing what you're  
fighting for."  -Paulo Coelho

"Suffering and joy teach us, if we allow them, how to make the leap of  
empathy, which transports us into the soul and heart of another  
person. ln those transparent moments we know other people's joys and  
sorrows, and we care about their concerns as if they were our own."  - 
Fritz Williams

"I hate to advocate drugs, alcohol, violence or insanity to anyone,  
but it worked for me." -Hunter S. Thompson

This email is not meant to cause any replies, except for Deepfog it is just=

It depends on what you define as government sponsored terrorism although yo=
u are referring to an exaggerated colorful way of defining CIA operations t=
hroughout its history. Remember the CIA operated its own affairs without mu=
ch government intervention until the late 60=92s early 70=92s when the CIA =
was forced to answer to Congress for funding. My class covered it all from =
the US=92s first spy executed by the British in the Revolutionary War to th=
e formation of the CIA shortly after WW II up till current as of 2005. I am=
 well aware of the US=92s past involvement in nation affairs in Chile, Iran=
, Africa, and throughout Central America, and so on throughout the world pa=
rticularly during the Cold War. If the Soviets were not in a country we wer=
e there in some form because of the raging fight over economic systems capi=
talism vs. communism.=20
=20
=20
I can definitely tell you we are not the only nation to use torture current=
ly. Do I believe our government abuses its power? Of course it does. Nearly=
 all politicians do and our government is like many others with various deg=
rees and forms of corruption (look at ex-NY gov. Spitzer an extremely rich =
man busted over taxes for pulling out large amounts of cash unaccounted for=
 from his bank to pay for a hooker). Some deemed ethical by civil standards=
 although some might think we are in the midst of a political crisis in Was=
hington with the Bush Administration. As of now the government is so intert=
wined with corporate business like never before in this nations history. Le=
ts just put it like this during Iraqi Desert Storm there was no Halliburton=
 in charge of feeding the troops and providing various services like now in=
 2008.=20
=20
=20
The military was self-sustained and did this all within with little private=
 corporate help. Halliburton was a small corporation awarded a very tiny co=
ntract during Iraqi Desert Storm with Cheney on its board during the early =
90=92s. Now Halliburton is huge and makes our army run providing various se=
rvices billing the government in the name of business contracts awarded bec=
ause of Cheney. One may counter this with the fact that no other company co=
uld provide the services Halliburton can with its vast resources and logist=
ics. Although it is seedy how the deal and a coincidence of how the war in =
Iraq went down because of Cheney once a board member he actually became ric=
h because of Halliburton so his allegiance is like a fraternity of brothers=
 to Halliburton.=20
=20
=20
People that work for the government particularly FBI and CIA agents hey the=
y just work for the government they are people like you and me. They are su=
sceptible to do everything anyone else is given the position and it is just=
 like a city=92s police force that might experience a few bad apples that s=
lip in. Actually all the crazy shit you can imagine has happened in many po=
lice departments from cops doing drugs in their squad cars (snorting cocain=
e on the dashboard) to everything else under the sun. It actually accounts =
for a very small percentage in reality but nonetheless it is bad and does h=
appen. It is life and it happens they are just people.=20
=20
=20
The CIA is made up of a ton of Ivy League guys with many having various tie=
s that got them there CIA job. Let=92s just say many of these Yale guys are=
 "hooked up" with their job from the start. But take that in for a minute t=
hese guys are smart as hell. It is not easy to get into Yale or Harvard las=
t I checked you have to be extremely intelligent with some damn good grades=
. Or if you were "hooked up" because you are rich and your family has speci=
al ties then you still have to have good grades and the thought of taking o=
n a job in which you could be killed or harmed in some way is extraordinary=
. You figure these guys could just work in other fields and make a lot of m=
oney doing other things. This stands the same for FBI guys with many having=
 JD law degrees.=20
Now Deepfog Khalid Sheik Mohammed is a scumbag so I will not even comment o=
n that if you want to defend him I ask you this would he defend you a Weste=
rner by birth? Tillman is a tragedy and to be honest anyone who joins the m=
ilitary now and fights in Iraq is not fighting for freedom they are fightin=
g a bungled political mess from Washington. It is sad. Vietnam was a mistak=
e but fought once again over political systems, capitalism vs. communism. A=
 capitalist nation is a customer nation to the U.S. and our big businesses =
move in quickly to capture the market (Coca-Cola). Remember this rogue poli=
ce officers topic is a whole other long discussion with so much bad shit I =
can go on for days and days. But I challenge you to bring me the statistics=
 because it is a very small percentage and is inevitable that bad cops slip=
 through a rigorous hiring process. Hey if you want to go there what about =
gang members slipping into our military and getting training and when their=
 duties are over they end up using there combat skills on our cops=85 I rea=
d a great book in college you should one-day look it up it is called Sense =
and Nonsense you would love it!
=20
=20
Ah this gets me to the U.S. Constitution in which you are right. The great =
unwashed as our founding fathers referred to the 13-colony population of th=
e day gave everything they had in a bitter struggle for independence. They =
wanted a great government and created one that was weak until it was able t=
o collect taxes from the people something the government did not want to or=
iginally do but had to do to consolidate power. There is so much gray area =
in government that makes it complex. You commented on the bad soldier and y=
es once again it will happen what do you expect from war or even just peopl=
e being people what can possibly happen will.=20
=20
=20
Good luck on your finals I definitely know how testing feels when you have =
to prepare for it. I studied hard when I had a full load of classes in coll=
ege a few years ago. Early last year I had to study hard again when I compl=
eted my paralegal certificate in law so I definitely know how it is.

Right when the whole "electroclash" sound was blowing up in around 2k2/2k3,=
 he had out a single that showed him in B-Boy gear, making a mix-tape with =

Subject: [sfraves] NRR: Room for rent in South Berkeley

Hey there,

If you or someone you know is looking for a place to live in the sunny  
East Bay, we will have a vacant room in our house in South Berkeley.  
The room will be available April 1st.  We can be reached at araya@tekno.us 
  or st_indigo@earthlink.net.

Please forward this to anyone you know who might be interested. Thanks!


Things to know about our household:

We own and live in the downstairs flat of a 2-unit house
Residents are: Araya (photographer), Philip (designer/builder/artist),  
Nalina (toddler/superstar), Cindy (salon owner), Sabra (preschool  
teacher), and Cemone (herbalist in training)
We all have keys to upstairs/downstairs and consider the whole thing a  
single home
Downstairs is more chill - Upstairs is a little more wild
The house is 2 short blocks from Ashby BART, 5 blocks to Berkeley Bowl  
Market and the Thai Temple
There are front & back yards with gardens/raised boxes planned, great  
if you want to do some gardening
Downstairs kitchen is huge, with a dishwasher, granite countertops
We are vegetarian, and cook two sometimes three meals a day; there is  
the option of you having shared meals with us
One cat lives here, though she may be re-located soon
Nice TV + surround sound in the living room (we like watching movies)
CDJ 800's set up in the living room
We have a washer/dryer
There is some shared storage space
There is a sewing studio & guest room upstairs
The room is 10 x 11, has ethernet, smallish closet


You:

Are male, preferably (lots of ladies in the house already, and we'd  
like to have some balance)
Do not own a lot of stuff - we already have living room furniture,  
dining room table, etc.
Want to take part in a cohesive home, and not just "have roommates"
Would actively participate in household events (i.e.: yard work days,  
bbq's, etc.)
Are mature and career-oriented, but still enjoy the occasional wild  
weekend
Can clean up after yourself (sorry, we already have a kid)
Don't have pets
Do not smoke cigarettes
Aren't a heavy drinker
Are reasonably good at communicating with housemates
Won't cook meat in our kitchen (though we do have a BBQ outside, and  
the girls upstairs cook meat occasionally)


The money part:

Rent is $640, plus utilities (PG&E $20-$60/month depending on the time  
of year and internet $5/month paid in four month installments - $20  
for four months); $640 deposit, plus $15/month for shared items like  
toilet paper, paper towels, spices, etc.

Goddamnit football is the gayest sport in existence.

Well, not quite, wrestling is quite a bit gayer. I mean, what's more
homoerotic than two men in tights wrestling around on the floor together?

Hey all,=20

The person that was doing our flyers for CABLE WEDNESDAYS can't do our =
flyer this month, and we still need to draft up a design for the =
upcoming 3/26 and 4/9 events...

Due to budgetary restraints (or lack of budget altogether really) we =
were hoping to wrangle someone to help us out "pro bono". Even better if =
you're a DJ so we can bribe you with a slot at the event one night, and =
of course we'll try and toss some free booze your way as well.

So - if any DJ's out there can help us do a fairl simple flyer design, =
lemme know - we need help ASAP! If you're a non-DJ, but can help, lemme =
know! We'll try and sort out some sort of payment by way of free booze =
or something.

Thanks.
Marco

Shit, how could I forget?

Not a real man's sport like boxing. Nothing better than the feeling of
standing in a ring and trying to beat the person in there with you into
unconsciousness with your gloved hands.

AS IF! HA!

I would pay to see you attempt to box someone though...I am sure it would be 
amusing as hell.

Subject: [sfraves] BSP: BunnyJam is happening on Sat. March 22nd

I want to make sure that folks are aware that this year's BunnyJam is less than 
a week away.  It hoppening this coming Sat., the 22nd, from 8p-4a.  And I'm 
very happy to announce that I'll be on the lineup this time around, bringing 
you a nutty set from Mid. to 1:30 in the downstairs dancefloor area.

This wackiness happens only once a year, Easter weekend.  I'm not sure if 
that's a bad thing or a good thing sometimes. :)  I only know that I never miss 
it!

Full details are here: http://bunnyjam.com/ (be sure to check out past pictures 
for inspiration.)

And for a little sampling of the musical weirdness, be sure to check out some 
of Neon Bunny's sets here: http://www.neonbunny.com/  You definitely don't want 
to sleep on this one.

Hope to see you on the dancefloor!

Namaste.

very happy to announce that I'll be on the lineup this time around, bringing 
you a nutty set from Mid. to 1:30 in the downstairs dancefloor area.

This wackiness happens only once a year, Easter weekend.  I'm not sure if 
that's a bad thing or a good thing sometimes. :)  I only know that I never miss 
it!

Full details are here: http://bunnyjam.com/ (be sure to check out past pictures 
for inspiration.)

And for a little sampling of the musical weirdness, be sure to check out some 
of Neon Bunny's sets here: http://www.neonbunny.com/  You definitely don't want 
to sleep on this one.

Hope to see you on the dancefloor!

Namaste.

Subject: [sfraves] BSP - The new DEFsf.com is here.... like, finally!

After several years of building, scrapping, and rebuilding the site, the 
new, improved, and *actually functional* DEFSF.COM is finally up!  Check 
it out at http://www.defsf.com/main

DEF is a San Francisco based collective of independent techno DJs, 
producers, and promoters dedicated to advancing techno on the West 
Coast, by way of selflessness and partnership in the electronic dance 
music underground community. DEFsf.com is a community resource that 
features West Coast Techno news, info, articles, and interviews.  
Currently we're featuring  an in depth look at the roots of the San Jose 
techno scene, a guide to club hopping and record shopping in Berlin, and 
interviews with Greg Bird of Kontrol and Derek Scott of DoBox Recordings. 

Love techno? Want to help out with DEFsf.com?  We're looking for 
contributors in the following areas:
    *Articles and Interviews covering techno history, culture, and trends
    *Monthly DJ charts - If you're a techno DJ that wants to contribute 
to our charts for April, send a list of your top 15 tracks of the month 
to seanocean@defsf.com
    *Upcoming events - Free promotion for your upcoming techno event!  
Contact us and we'll put it on our calendar.

Special thanks goes out to DJ STML, Chel-C Faith, and Ed Colmar; without 
their hard work and dedication, none of this would be possible.

DEFsf.com is still very much a work in progress, and this is only the 
beginning.  Stay tuned.... much more to come!


Peace, love & techno always,

-sean ocean for DEF

it out at http://www.defsf.com/main

DEF is a San Francisco based collective of independent techno DJs,

Love techno? Want to help out with DEFsf.com?  We're looking for

to seanocean@defsf.com
    *Upcoming events - Free promotion for your upcoming techno event!  
Contact us and we'll put it on our calendar.

Special thanks goes out to DJ STML, Chel-C Faith, and Ed Colmar; without 
their hard work and dedication, none of this would be possible.

DEFsf.com is still very much a work in progress, and this is only the 
beginning.  Stay tuned.... much more to come!


Peace, love & techno always,

Subject: [sfraves] (nrr) QOD (Tue)

I'm in kind of a sour mood this morning.  I think the reason is I  
heard an interview of someone connected with Tibet and they were  
talking about how the Chinese are basically trying to swallow up that  
population by making all the Tibetan women marry Chinese men and  
stealing the babies and all that stuff and that's why the Tibetan  
people are revolting, they're just tired of it.  So it makes me kind  
of unsettled and not feeling very good about buying products made in  
China.  Not only is it bad for the trade deficit right now but Tibet  
aside, we've outsourced the sweatshop environment to someplace where  
we don't have to see it.  And people say that doesn't affect them,  
well it does.  It affects everyone.

Some interesting stuff in this article.  Basically an FBI informant, who the
LA Times later contacted (but does not identify) has said that Bad Boy
associates were behind the shooting, and that Biggie and Puffy new in
advance.

I'm waiting to see how this all develops.  However, if the article does
prove true, it wouldn't surprise me one bit.  I'd like to find out more
about what happened to the FBI's case as well.

Diddy should be arrested purely for supplying so much awful music to the 
masses. That and that big, mis-shaped head of his.

Don't it look like his mama's vagina squeezed way too hard when he was on 
the way out?

Subject: [sfraves] NRR:  Arthur C. Clarke, Premier Science Fiction Writer, Dies at 90

March 18, 2008
Arthur C. Clarke, Premier Science Fiction Writer, Dies at 90
By GERALD JONAS

Arthur C. Clarke, a writer whose seamless blend of scientific expertise =
and
poetic imagination helped usher in the space age, died early Wednesday =
in
Colombo, Sri Lanka, where he had lived since 1956. He was 90.

Rohan de Silva, an aide to Mr. Clarke, said the author died after
experiencing breathing problems, The Associated Press reported. Mr. =
Clarke
had post-polio syndrome for the last two decades and used a wheelchair.

>From his detailed forecast of telecommunications satellites in 1945, =
more
than a decade before the first orbital rocket flight, to his =
co-creation,
with the director Stanley Kubrick, of the classic science fiction film
=932001: A Space Odyssey,=94 Mr. Clarke was both prophet and promoter of =
the
idea that humanity=92s destiny lay beyond the confines of Earth.

Other early advocates of a space program argued that it would pay for =
itself
by jump-starting new technology. Mr. Clarke set his sights higher.
Paraphrasing William James, he suggested that exploring the solar system
could serve as the =93moral equivalent=94 of war, giving an outlet to =
energies
that might otherwise lead to nuclear holocaust.

Mr. Clarke=92s influence on public attitudes toward space was =
acknowledged by
American astronauts and Russian cosmonauts, by scientists like the
astronomer Carl Sagan and by movie and television producers. Gene
Roddenberry credited Mr. Clarke=92s writings with giving him courage to =
pursue
his =93Star Trek=94 project in the face of indifference, even ridicule, =
from
television executives.

In his later years, after settling in Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), Mr. Clarke
continued to bask in worldwide acclaim as both a scientific sage and the
pre-eminent science fiction writer of the 20th century. In 1998, he was
knighted by Queen Elizabeth II.

He played down his success in foretelling a globe-spanning network of
communication satellites. =93No one can predict the future,=94 he always
maintained.

But as a science fiction writer, he couldn=92t resist drawing up =
timelines for
what he called =93possible futures.=94 Far from displaying uncanny =
prescience,
these conjectures mainly demonstrated his lifelong, and often =
disappointed,
optimism about the peaceful uses of technology =97 from his calculation =
in
1945 that atomic-fueled rockets could be no more than 20 years away to =
his
conviction in 1999 that =93clean, safe power=94 from =93cold fusion=94 =
would be
commercially available in the first years of the new millennium.

Mr. Clarke was well aware of the importance of his role as science =
spokesman
to the general population: =93Most technological achievements were =
preceded by
people writing and imagining them,=94 he noted. =93I=92m sure we would =
not have
had men on the Moon,=94 he added, if it had not been for H.G. Wells and =
Jules
Verne. =93I=92m rather proud of the fact that I know several astronauts =
who
became astronauts through reading my books.=94

Arthur Charles Clarke was born on Dec. 16, 1917, in the seaside town of
Minehead, Somerset, England. His father was a farmer; his mother a post
office telegrapher. The eldest of four children, he was educated as a
scholarship student at a secondary school in the nearby town of Taunton. =
He
remembered a number of incidents in early childhood that awakened his
scientific imagination: exploratory rambles along the Somerset =
shoreline,
with its =93wonderland of rock pools;=94 a card from a pack of =
cigarettes that
his father showed him, with a picture of a dinosaur; the gift of a =
Meccano
set, a British construction toy similar to the Erector sets sold in the
United States.

He also spent time =93mapping the Moon=94 through a telescope he =
constructed
himself out of =93a cardboard tube and a couple of lenses.=94 But the =
formative
event of his childhood was his discovery, at age 13 =97 the year his =
father
died =97 of a copy of =93Astounding Stories of Super-Science,=94 then =
the leading
American science fiction magazine. He found its mix of boyish adventure =
and
far-out (sometimes bogus) science intoxicating.

While still in school, Mr. Clarke joined the newly formed British
Interplanetary Society, a small band of sci-fi enthusiasts who held the
controversial view that space travel was not only possible but could be
achieved in the not-so-distant future. In 1937, a year after he moved to
London to take a civil service job, he began writing his first science
fiction novel, a story of the far, far future that was later published =
as
=93Against the Fall of Night=94 (1953).

Mr. Clarke spent World War II as an officer in the Royal Air Force. In =
1943
he was assigned to work with a team of American scientist-engineers who =
had
developed the first radar-controlled system for landing airplanes in bad
weather. That experience led to Mr. Clarke=92s only non-science fiction =
novel,
=93Glide Path=94 (1963). More important, it led in 1945 to a technical =
paper,
published in the British journal =93Wireless World,=94 establishing the
feasibility of artificial satellites as relay stations for Earth-based
communications.

The meat of the paper was a series of diagrams and equations showing =
that
=93space stations=94 parked in a circular orbit roughly 22,240 miles =
above the
equator would exactly match the Earth=92s rotation period of 24 hours. =
In such
an orbit, a satellite would remain above the same spot on the ground,
providing a =93stationary=94 target for transmitted signals, which could =
then be
retransmitted to wide swaths of territory below. This so-called
geostationary orbit has been officially designated the Clarke Orbit by =
the
International Astronomical Union.

Decades later, Mr. Clarke called his =93Wireless World=94 paper =93the =
most
important thing I ever wrote.=94 In a wry piece entitled, =93A Short =
Pre-History
of Comsats, Or: How I Lost a Billion Dollars in My Spare Time,=94 he =
claimed
that a lawyer had dissuaded him from applying for a patent. The lawyer, =
he
said, thought the notion of relaying signals from space was too =
far-fetched
to be taken seriously.

But Mr. Clarke also acknowledged that nothing in his paper =97 from the =
notion
of artificial satellites to the mathematics of the geostationary orbit =
=97 was
new. His chief contribution was to clarify and publicize an idea whose =
time
had almost come =97 a feat of consciousness-raising that he would =
continue to
excel at throughout his career.

The year 1945 also saw the launch of Mr. Clarke=92s career as a fiction
writer. He sold a short story called =93Rescue Party=94 to the same =
magazine =97
now re-titled Astounding Science Fiction =97 that had captured his =
imagination
15 years earlier.

For the next two years, Mr. Clarke attended Kings College, London, on =
the
British equivalent of a G.I. Bill scholarship, graduating in 1948 with
first-class honors in physics and mathematics. But he continued to write =
and
sell stories, and after a stint as assistant editor at the scientific
journal Physics Abstracts, he decided he could support himself as a
freelance writer. Success came quickly. His primer on space flight, =
=93The
Exploration of Space,=94 was a Book-of-the-Month Club selection in 1951

Over the next two decades, he wrote a series of nonfiction bestsellers =
as
well as his best-known novels, including =93Childhood=92s End=94 (1953) =
and =932001:
A Space Odyssey=94 (1968). For a scientifically trained writer whose =
optimism
about technology seemed boundless, Mr. Clarke delighted in confronting =
his
characters with obstacles they could not overcome without help from =
forces
beyond their comprehension.

In =93Childhood=92s End,=94 a race of aliens who happen to look like =
devils
imposes peace on an Earth torn by cold war tensions. But the aliens=92 =
real
mission is to prepare humanity for the next stage of evolution. In an =
ending
that is both heartbreakingly poignant and literally earth-shattering, =
Mr.
Clarke suggests that mankind can escape its suicidal tendencies only by
ceasing to be human.

=93There was nothing left of Earth,=94 he wrote. =93It had nourished =
them, through
the fierce moments of their inconceivable metamorphosis, as the food =
stored
in a grain of wheat feeds the infant plant while it climbs toward the =
Sun.=94

The cold war also forms the backdrop for =932001.=94 Its genesis was a =
short
story called =93The Sentinel,=94 first published in a science fiction =
magazine
in 1951. It tells of an alien artifact found on the Moon, a little
crystalline pyramid that explorers from Earth destroy while trying to =
open.
One explorer realizes that the artifact was a kind of fail-safe beacon; =
in
silencing it, human beings have signaled their existence to its far-off
creators.

In the spring of 1964, Stanley Kubrick, fresh from his triumph with =
=93Dr.
Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb,=94 met =
Mr.
Clarke in New York, and the two agreed to make the =93proverbial really =
good
science fiction movie=94 based on =93The Sentinel.=94 This led to a =
four-year
collaboration; Mr. Clarke wrote the novel while Mr. Kubrick produced and
directed the film; they are jointly credited with the screenplay.

Reviewers at the time were puzzled by the film, especially the final =
scene
in which an astronaut who has been transformed by aliens returns to =
orbit
the Earth as a =93Star-Child.=94 In the book he demonstrates his =
new-found
powers by harmlessly detonating from space the entire arsenal of Soviet =
and
American nuclear weapons. Like much of the plot, this denouement is not
clear in the film, from which Mr. Kubrick cut most of the expository
material.

As a fiction writer, Mr. Clarke was often criticized for failing to =
create
fully realized characters. HAL, the mutinous computer in =932001,=94 is =
probably
his most =93human=94 creation: a self-satisfied know-it-all with a =
touching but
misguided faith in its own infallibility.

If Mr. Clarke=92s heroes are less than memorable, it is also true that =
there
are no out-and-out villains in his work; his characters are generally =
too
busy struggling to make sense of an implacable universe to engage in =
petty
schemes of dominance or revenge.

Mr. Clarke=92s own relationship with machines was somewhat ambivalent.
Although he held a driver=92s license as a young man, he never drove a =
car.
Yet he stayed in touch with the rest of the world from his home in Sri =
Lanka
through an ever-expanding collection of up-to-date computers and
communications accessories. And until his health declined, he was an =
expert
scuba diver in the waters around Sri Lanka.

He first became interested in diving in the early 1950s, when he =
realized
that he could find underwater =93something very close to =
weightlessness=94 of
outer space. He settled permanently in Colombo, the capital of what was =
then
Ceylon, in 1956. With a partner, he established a guided diving service =
for
tourists and wrote vividly about his diving experiences in a number of
books, beginning with =93The Coast of Coral=94 (1956).

All told, he wrote or collaborated on close to 100 books, some of which,
like =93Childhood=92s End,=94 have been in print continuously. His works =
have been
translated into some 40 languages, and worldwide sales have been =
estimated
at more than $25 million.

In 1962 he suffered a severe attack of poliomyelitis. His apparently
complete recovery was marked by a return to top form at his favorite =
sport,
table tennis. But in 1984 he developed post-polio syndrome, a =
progressive
condition characterized by muscle weakness and extreme fatigue. He spent =
the
last years of his life in a wheelchair.

Among his legacies are Clarke=92s Three Laws, provocative observations =
on
science, science fiction and society that were published in his =
=93Profiles of
the Future=94 (1962):

=B6=93When a distinguished but elderly scientist states that something =
is
possible, he is almost certainly right. When he states that something is
impossible, he is very probably wrong.=94

=B6=93The only way of discovering the limits of the possible is to =
venture a
little way past them into the impossible.=94

=B6=93Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from =
magic.=94

Along with Verne and Wells, Mr. Clarke said his greatest influences as a
writer were Lord Dunsany, a British fantasist noted for his lyrical, if
sometimes overblown, prose; Otto Stapledon, a British philosopher who =
wrote
vast speculative narratives that projected human evolution to the =
furthest
reaches of space and time; and Herman Melville=92s =93Moby-Dick.=94

While sharing his passions for space and the sea with a worldwide
readership, Mr. Clarke kept his emotional life private. He was briefly
married in 1953 to an American diving enthusiast named Marilyn Mayfield;
they separated after a few months and were divorced in 1964.

One of his closest relationships was with Leslie Ekanayake, a fellow =
diver
in Sri Lanka, who died in a motorcycle accident in 1977. Mr. Clarke =
shared
his home in Colombo with Leslie=92s brother, Hector, his partner in the =
diving
business, Hector=92s wife Valerie; and their three daughters.

Mr. Clarke=92s standard answer when journalists asked him outright if he =
was
gay was, =93No, merely mildly cheerful.=94

Mr. Clarke reveled in his fame. One whole room in his house =97 which he
referred to as the Ego Chamber =97 was filled with photos and other
memorabilia of his career, including pictures of him with Yuri Gagarin, =
the
first man in space, and Neil Armstrong, the first man to walk on the =
moon.

Mr. Clarke=92s reputation as a prophet of the space age rests on more =
than a
few accurate predictions. His visions helped bring about the future he
longed to see. His contributions to the space program were lauded by =
Charles
Kohlhase, who planned NASA=92s Cassini mission to Saturn: =93When you =
dream what
is possible, and add a knowledge of physics, you make it happen.=94

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Nrr: An airplane passenger masturbated into a sleeping girl's hair

For the record, a true story, I was once poked in the eye with a boob at a strip club in Texas.  I had some difficulty seeing for a day or so, but I didn't sue.
 
It was somewhat painful and embarrassing at the time, however the stripper was very apologetic afterwards.  

Case closed.
 
Best,
 
Peter

"Is", "is." "is" ? the idiocy of the word haunts me. If it were
abolished, human thought might begin to make sense. I don't know what
anything "is"; I only know how it seems to me at this moment.

All I can say about this video is that it is amazing.  I'm wishing that 
each of you gains as much from it as I did:

http://www.joketribe.com/externalVids/Jill.Bolte.Taylor.Finds.Nirvana.php

Save it for a time in which you can spare about 20 mins. of 
uninterrupted time.  You'll really be happy that you did.

Its worth the time to listen to what she has to say.

Everything she says is confirmed within the Buddhist tradition.  IMO.

See also, http://www.amazon.com/Kindly-Bent-Ease-Part-One/dp/0913546402

And this lecture reminds me of a track: 
http://www.audiojelly.com/index.cfm?action=track.cfm?id=52427&type=tracks

Read below while enjoying a little bit o' psy trance.

The Natural Freedom of the Mind

Since the One Mind -- pure from the beginningless beginning
and with no need to grasp things other than itself --
has nothing to do with an intermediary or with a fixed plan ,
the individual mind might as well
be happy .

Since awareness has no objective relationship of any kind,
no specific direction or focus ,
the individual might as well
love everyone .

Since vision and commitment to vision
have nothing to do with complacency or fear,
the individual might as well
be joyous .

Since action and goals have nothing to do with success or failure,
hope and anxiety ,
and it doesn't matter whether they are won or lost ,
the individual might as well
feel content .

Since everything is an illusion --
with some more perfect than others --
with no relationship to good or bad ,
being or not-being ,
one might as well
laugh from beginning to end .

 Longchenpa

Peace,

Peter

Well acid can unlock the secret of 2012, if you let it.  But her 
experience was just as genuine, if not more in some people's eyes.

yeah I was going to comment as well that it sounds a lot like the experience
of psychedelic drugs, but of course JC's right in reminding us that the
similarity doesn't make the experience less genuine and that acid isn't
automatically a magic gateway to the truth.  I wouldn't call it
disappointing either, there are many paths to the same goal.

Sooooo looking forward to moksha tribe this month. I remember vividly 
every Moksha tribe party.. the meat factory with the crawl space to the 
side room.. the random leaky building near the carls jr in sf.. the 
oaktown event space. yum!
I was perusing the pix from 2002, lots of people in there i still hang 
out with to this very day.
I'm so happy that moksha has risen from the ashes, or so it were. Don't 
miss this, seriously one for the record books.

:D

Agreed.   As it was for Richie Hawtin.

If Mighty says 'limited capacity' it doesn't mean anything.

Really enjoyed their music and visuals, but really don't like being crammed and bumped and walked in front of every 5 seconds.

I really like Mighty's feel as a  club, but whoever designed the layout...
geeeezus, it's totally unfriendly to large crowds how it's set up.  They
should just knock out that second room, set the DJ area up over there, and
move the bar, coatcheck, and bathrooms around to provide more room for a
larger dance area.

Yea, every time they do the tribute to Stevie Wonder they oversell/pack the=

Subject: [sfraves] SRR: Guess it's my turn....


So, it's no surprise really to folks around here that I have been strugglin=
g on and off with financial bullshit. After shelling out almost a grand to =
the IRS this year, they decided to nail me with another $600 penalty for so=
me mini audit they did on my 2006 returns, and have begun snatching money o=
ut of my checks. My rent increased from less than $600 per month to $750 pe=
r month in January, and my commute costs went up from less than $50 a month=
 to over $200 a month. Essentially, I have far more money going out to debt=
 then I am making.=20

I have tried to sell off my records and whatnot to try and make up the loss=
, but I haven't even really scratched the surface (but thank you to those w=
ho have purchased from me, hopefully the vinyl has been worth it).=20

I am now about $400 overdrawn in my bank after the gub'ment took a nice chu=
nk from me and my landlord cashed a check for utilities that I asked him to=
 hold up on until I could recoup some lost cash. I am essentially screwed f=
or rent money on the 31st/1st as my check will be swallowed up paying back =
the bank.=20

This is the worst possible scenario I could face right now. I'd borrow from=
 my parents, but to be honest, they are struggling on their paltry retireme=
nt incomes to the point where my mother had to get a job to make ends meet.=
 I have tried to get a loan through my work, but they don't want to do that=
, because they feel if they help me, the floodgates will open for other emp=
loyees to seek assistance.=20

Basically, I am up the proverbial shit creek sans paddle. I am not expectin=
g a miracle to happen by any means - but if anyone has any suggestions, or =
can offer help, I am by no means beyond accepting at this point.=20

On top of all this, I caught a wicked fever/flu last night, and am missing =
a day of work that I can't afford to miss at all.=20

I am not the type of person to just accept charity without trying to pay ba=
ck...so if anyone knows of people who may need help around the house (like =
painting or cleaning or something), or maybe need some one off job of some =
kind, or anything really...please let me know! My weekends are my only real=
ly free days as my job has me commuting for 4 hours per day (2 hours there,=
 2 hours back), but I'd be willing to do just about anything at this point =
to try and get myself out of this hole.=20

How about it SFR...help a fellow raver?

--

National currencies and global markets simply do not mix; together
they make a deadly brew of currency crises and geopolitical tension
and create ready pretexts for damaging protectionism. In order to
globalize safely, countries should abandon monetary nationalism and
abolish unwanted currencies, the source of much of today's instability.

I just don't even know what to do at this point. I guess I have 30 days after not paying rent before I'm evicted....maybe I can pull a miracle out of my ass between now and then.

Sounds good, but they do check your driving record.  So if you had your
license suspended within the last few years, you may be able to work a shift

Maserati's and Bentley's unless your shit is clean.

do they stop charging you after the 500 dollar ticket and license 
suspension? i'm facing this myself especially since i cannot afford to 
pay anything. my driving record is clean but like you i'm fuggin broke. 
its unfair that life really tends to bend you over and ream you really 
really hard with a sandpaper condom when you're poor. i would suggest 
trawling craigslist for gigs. there's lots of weird stuff in there that 
can help out. but watch out, there's alot of shady people in there 
looking to cheat somebody out of an honest days work.

and all you people in your cubicles reading this now.. thank your lucky 
monitor you have a decent living wage. whatever bs your boss puts you 
through its not half as bad as being late on all your bills and rent.

respects
sean.

Yea, with tickets they only (thus far anyway) charge you for the actual tic=
ket cost. Both of mine happened to have been $500 + each (which is beyond m=
e seeing as they were both only speeding tickets, and neither was for exces=
sive speeding).=20

I actually have one of the cubicle jobs, I just happen to work for some che=
ap ass Chinese people who would sooner cut off their own fingers than give =
someone a raise. Mind you they owe me a 6 month review (which was due back =
in January), and I have been there over a year with no raises whatsoever. I=
'd go find another job, but then I'd have to deal with a good 2 - 4 week la=
g on getting a new check. Again, this doesn't help me.

I have been trolling CL for opportunities....just haven't found anything th=
us far.=20

If I thought I could make any $$ at it, I'd whore myself out, cuz at least =
then I could get a buncha cash on the quick....but, that is an ally I am no=
t willing to go down...yet.

I'm pretty left leaning, but I can come to a common ground with pretty
much anyone as long as, you know, logic is involved.

hey man, sorry to hear about your hard times. i don't know if this is what you're after, but i work part time in a restaurant on the wharf (in addition to my full-time office job) and i could probably get you a shift or two hosting on the weekends. i think it pays $10/hour, and you basically just stand outside, say hello to tourists, and lead people to their tables. let me know if you're interested and i'll talk to the owner for you. good luck <3

love,
mo

After shelling out almost a grand to the IRS this year, they decided to nail me with another $600 penalty for some mini audit they did on my 2006 returns, and have begun snatching money out of my checks. My rent increased from less than $600 per month to $750 per month in January, and my commute costs went up from less than $50 a month to over $200 a month. Essentially, I have far more money going out to debt then I am making. 

I have tried to sell off my records and whatnot to try and make up the loss, but I haven't even really scratched the surface (but thank you to those who have purchased from me, hopefully the vinyl has been worth it). 

I am now about $400 overdrawn in my bank after the gub'ment took a nice chunk from me and my landlord cashed a check for utilities that I asked him to hold up on until I could recoup some lost cash. I am essentially screwed for rent money on the 31st/1st as my check will be swallowed up paying back the bank. 

This is the worst possible scenario I could face right now. I'd borrow from my parents, but to be honest, they are struggling on their paltry retirement incomes to the point where my mother had to get a job to make ends meet. I have tried to get a loan through my work, but they don't want to do that, because they feel if they help me, the floodgates will open for other employees to seek assistance. 

Basically, I am up the proverbial shit creek sans paddle. I am not expecting a miracle to happen by any means - but if anyone has any suggestions, or can offer help, I am by no means beyond accepting at this point. 

On top of all this, I caught a wicked fever/flu last night, and am missing a day of work that I can't afford to miss at all. 

I am not the type of person to just accept charity without trying to pay back...so if anyone knows of people who may need help around the house (like painting or cleaning or something), or maybe need some one off job of some kind, or anything really...please let me know! My weekends are my only really free days as my job has me commuting for 4 hours per day (2 hours there, 2 hours back), but I'd be willing to do just about anything at this point to try and get myself out of this hole. 

How about it SFR...help a fellow raver?

YES! I would definitely like info on that. I do have heavy customer service 
background, so helping folks like that would be WAY easy.

Plus it's weekends, which I can actually work.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] SRR: Guess it's my turn....

What's your degree in?  If it's in CS or similar, my company is hiring  
engineers.  It's not dotcom pay again by a long shot.  And my time out  
of the industry knocked me basically all the way back down to entry- 
level anyway.  But its a decent salary that has me not worrying about  
money anymore.  Plus, we're stable and profitable.

Bunny O'Jam: The Luck of the HARE-ish

Celebrate LEAP year and lucky convergance of all things Lapine and Leprauchan! 
This 'ill be a double whammy of a holiday JAMmy! So green your jellybean and 
follow the rainbow to the pot of golden carrots and eggly delights...   ...but 
beware the dreaded Octalapine that guards the snakes and pot of mold!

Bunny Jam is tonight folks!  And as I mentioned earlier, I'm going to be 
getting full on weird with my set from Midnight to 1:23a in the downstairs 
dancefloor area.  Knowledge of Bunny Jam has apparently spread fairly wide, so 
I'd suggest getting there early to make sure that you get in as well as 
maximizing the fun. ;)

Full details are here: http://bunnyjam.com/ (be sure to check out past pictures 
for inspiration.)

And for a little sampling of the musical weirdness, be sure to check out some 
of Neon Bunny's sets here: http://www.neonbunny.com/  You definitely don't want 
to sleep on this one.

Hope to see you on the dancefloor!

Namaste.

Hey everyone! I just moved to the area from dc and I was just wondering
where the good electronic music clubs are. I mainly love electro and breaks.
Any suggestions?

Thanks!

Hey all,

I've been on the hunt for some cheap/used rims and tires for my '94 Acura
Integra.  I've been keeping an eye out on CL, but then it hit me, maybe i
should check here as well.  i'd have more faith in my friends here on SFR
than some random CL posting.

I'm currently riding on some basic rims (sans hubcaps) with some abused
Falken tires.  I had to use some "Fix it Flat" to get me up and running and
it has really screwed up the balance on my tires.  Rather than just getting
new tires i thought i'd try to keep an eye out for some decent rims and
tires.  I was hoping to come across just some basic stock alloy rims with
tires in good condition, but anything more than that is worth checking out
as well.  14's, 15's, 16's or 17's (as long as it has a 4x100mm lug pattern
and is in good condition) it doesnt really matter.  So if you've swapped out
your rims and tires for new fancy ones and still have the old ones sitting
in a garage somewhere or know someone else who does and want to get rid of
them for cheap (or trade, i dont have too much stuff up to offer in trade
but you never know) let me know.

As always thanks for your help fellow SFR friends.

Formless (Flytrap / Day of Hugs / Bete Noire - UK)

Dan Jones is a London based DJ and producer with a long-standing passion =
for underground house music. Djing and producing under the name =
Formless, he has been rocking clubs around London with a blend of =
forward thinking tech house and dirty electro beats.=20
In the last 12 months he has been creating a buzz with his unique, =
energetic, upfront sound at respected London venues like The Cross, =
Turnmills, Pacha, The Key and The Island. His brisk ascent through the =
DJ ranks came on the back of a number of DJ mix competition wins and =
playing a live set on MoS Radio. This gave the exposure needed to push =
his sound onto bigger dancefloors. Having consolidated his position in =
London, Formless is now taking his music to the international club =
scene.=20

With more dates in San Francisco, Sydney, Brisbane and the Ukraine on =
the horizon, time in the studio working on a new solo EP and a number of =
remixes and collaborations, the future looks bright for one of djing's =
freshest talents. On top of DJ and production commitments Dan has just =
launched his own night Flytrap, already hosting parties at The Cross, =
The Island & Pacha London. He still finds time every summer to =
co-ordinate the music for the Norgstock Festival (nr. Stonehenge) and =
run his own Day of Hugs bi-annual Manor House Party (nr. Bournemouth).=20

also playing:

The Vinyl Whore (High On Hope - SF)

I'm already well feeling it...but, then again, I have never been well off or 
come from a well off family, so to me it's no worse than normal - but just 
seeing how the economy is effecting my job (I work in the wedding industry)

If you haven't been seeing this coming since about 2002, you haven't been

Yes, it's going to get bad. REALLY fucking bad.

Get ready kids, it's gonna be a hell of a ride.

Hey everyone! I just moved to the area from dc and I was just wondering
where the good electronic music clubs are. I mainly love electro and breaks.
Any suggestions?

Yuck.

Great sound, weak club, hella expensive drinks, lame patrons (overall).

They are good if you want all the crappy "DJ top 100" bullshit...although 
they do occasionally have good headliners (Like James Zabiela & Deadmau5) - 
but overall it's all the "superstar" DJ's, which are lame.

Yep, only one I know of really, I actually live in SJ, so not been to much
by way of club in SF... 

I heard of another one called 1015? Never been there myself... 

The club scenes in SJ and Sac(where I moved from) are epic fail. 

Been to a few house head spots, but these are not clubs ;)

1015 is akin to Ruby Skye in the fact that it's another "mega" club and full 
of douchebag clubbers (most nights). Of course, if you are looking for that 
sort of club, they are good places to start.

May as well tack on Temple to that list too.

the 'lead singer' in that trio looks rather mongoloid-ish - or  
possibly a relative of BJ from Barney and Friends: http://img.coxnewsweb.com/B/08/67/67/image_4767678.jpg

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Hi

It seems that most non-underground events that I go to are at Mighty.  
I don't prefer the venue, it's just that all the events that I like  
happen to be there. My favorite venue in SF is probably Mezzanine.  
There are breaks events all the time. Look for flyers in clubs,  
record stores, and bars.

Sadly, the sfraves list is not a real reflection of what goes on in  
the sf bay area.  The music and dance scene in SF is quite positive,  
varied and lively. You'll eventually find what you're looking for. :)

Welcome!

i have no idea who ACTUALLY made this video, but i swear it's probably doing
more damage to McCain's campaign than helping it.  maybe the DNC made this?
;)

i mean, who would possibly want to allign themselves idealogically with
these overweight, out of tune, hopelessly unhip soccer moms?  no wait...
soccer moms actually got laid at one point.  and did i mention ugly?  sorry,
but fuggit, everyone was thinking it anyway.  these are not the type of
people i care to be taking political advice from, thanks.

best argument for a democratic vote i've seen so far.

and yes, i did want to vomit.

In light of some recent commentary, I thought it might be cool to have a 1015 discussion for a minute. For better AND worse, I have had some F'n good times there. . . 

I remember when they used to throw Come-Unity at 1015, there was Nikita on Friday night, Release on Sat., then Spundae on Sundays. . . The big name DJ's rocked the club to a packed crowd, and the debauchery in the basement was taken to a new level.

Yeah, there was the "Nazi Security" phase (they've been pretty cool since remodeling), but I still have a good time when I go there, esp. on a busy night. The indoor smoking area is a great touch, because you can still hear the music and have a smoke without freezing your ass off. (BTW, I haven't have a cigarette since Feb. 8th, but the security there has been pretty "lenient" with us, if you catch me drift.)

I guess my favorite parties I've seen there lately are the Get Freaky events. My experience with that crowd has been really positive, and the acid/funky/industrial break/burner sound really thumps the sound in that main room. 

I guess what I'm trying to say here that 1015 still has a strong "vibe" factor at select events. Just gotta be weary of what night you're going now.

My .02, rant away.

peace

Subject: Re: [sfraves] 1015

Well, they are moving away from the EDM crowd to focus more on live music 
anyway - I think 1015's era of electronic tunes is on it's way out.

I for one couldn't care less. I love the upstairs and basement, but have 
always thought the front room and main room have (by and large) sucked. 
Often times the sound in the main area was muddy and unclear - which in a 
big room is god awful.

The last really good event I went to there was Cut Chemist last year. WODNB 
last year was HORRIBLE. I mean, realllllllllllllllllllllly bad. The sound 
sucked, and only two DJ's (Danny The Wildchild & Method 1) were worth a 
fuck. The MC's were positively attrocious (albeit kinda hot - they were 
female MC's).

I dunno - I just never saw the appeal. I hate to say it, but I'd rather go 
to Ruby Skye.

Subject: [sfraves] NRR: need help moving a heavy thing today

hey all,

i need help some time today moving a heavy cement sink. i need to pick  
it up near 30th & San Pablo in West Oakland, and take it to my house  
in Berkeley. The sink will be used in the residential greywater  
treatment system that i am designing and building in my back yard.

moving the sink shouldn't take more than 1/2 hour or so. There's just  
no way i can lift it on my own.

Please call me at 415 255 9776 ASAP if you can help.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] nrr: are we heading in for more than a recession?

First off, some sites to check out:

http://www.theinternationalforecaster.com

http://www.midasresources.com

http://www.usgoldcoins.com/

I didn't catch everything Andy Gause said the other night on the Jeff  
Rense show but he did explain quite clearly why gold went to over  
$1,000 last week and now it's dropped but it's definitely expected to  
go up again.  I believe the only reason it hasn't shot up even more  
is the central banks are dumping gold into the market.

Now one thing about this is Alan Greenspan was one of the people  
responsible for this mess we're in now, as well as all the lending  
institutions that gave all those subprime and ALT-A loans that now  
have people in new tent cities springing up in Los Angeles and other  
areas of the country.  Ben Bernanke is making it worse and when he  
talks, he talks like we're two years old.

They're doing this on purpose and everyone knows this, because  
depending on how bad it gets, there's two models I've heard as  
possibilities, one is like the 1970's stagflation era, the other is  
the 1930's depression style.  Keep in mind that both of them carry  
the danger of inflation, but it could get so bad that your dollar  
will no longer be able to buy food.  This happened in the 1930's in  
the Weimar Republic and it also happened in Argentina a few years  
back.  And if that kind of stuff happens it doesn't take much for  
normal upstanding people to start acting like animals, coming to your  
door looking for your food.  Will it get that bad?  I hope not.

Last thing I'm going to talk about right now, and I haven't vetted  
some of this information with books and periodicals yet, so do your  
own research, is if you decide to buy gold, remember the government  
has claimed their right to confiscate it under executive order, so  
basically circumventing the entire system, unless it is pre-1933  
coins or collectibles.  They did it in 1933, made everyone turn in  
their gold for I believe it was $20 an ounce, then when they got it  
all they raised the price to $35 an ounce, but you couldn't get this  
price if you were an American.  If they confiscate gold now, it will  
be at $42 an ounce.  So be careful and get it from trusted sources,  
I've posted a few links of places you could call there's also  
Gainesville Coins on eBay that's pretty prompt.

Get some gold and silver, get some storable food or grow a garden,  
diversify.  Next 2-3 years is when it could all crash from every  
source I've heard.  Or it could even be tomorrow.

I think the same! Area 33 + no commercials = epic win. 

I've actually had both since 2004,  Sirius is a little more pricey, but well
worth the shows they put on...  

XM is much cheaper, but has less electronic/dance stations.

We'll see who pops up next to be the competition... Maybe it will get
cheaper ;)

I have been a Sirius subscriber since 2004 and I think satellite radio can
only get better although it has already been the best music source I can
think of for a consumer since its inception. Not to mention my love for
listening to Stern and Area 33!
 
 
NEW YORK (CNNMoney.com) -- The U.S. Justice Department approved the merger
between satellite radio companies Sirius and XM Monday, more than a year
after the two companies first announced their deal.

You hit it right on XM is known for its somewhat larger subscriber base and=
 Sirius is known for its superior programming. I stopped buying CD's for th=

I think it is worth it. I recently renewed my service for two units for the=
 year ahead so I am all good but since the music kicks ass I would pay more=
. For me the service cuts out a long tedious music search and I am exposed =

My luck with the Garmin traffic antenna has been hit & miss. Not sure if that's the same as what you're describing below, however I believe they all use the same service for traffic "updates". . . Works OK for traffic warnings in the bay, however I usually ignore them unless there is a "red" warning, in which I'll detour.

For the snow, it's so far proved worthless ("warning: chains required ahead," as opposed to the radio will fill you in on the 5 hours that you'll be stuck on 80 if you don't turn the F around RIGHT NOW!!!)

peace

Indeed!  I've been a Sirius subscriber and stockholder
for quite a while now, and I'm constantly listening to
Boombox, SoulTown and Howard 100.  I've given Sirius
as a gift, and I use the Internet radio while I'm at
work.  I think it's a great product and that the
merged company will just make it even better.  I'm
just hoping the stock goes back up so I can actually
make some money back!  Slipping down to <$3 after
buying in at ~$7 is a very painful thing to watch
happen!

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Hi

This is a list of sites that I like to check out (since i do all that 
promo stuff);
1. NiteVibe
2.SFStation
3.SunsetPromotions
4.Eventvibe
For events that are not really on the radar;
1. go to the Haight and pick up every flyer u see that may look 
intresting to you for up incoming events
2. Find the local artist that you like in these flyers and subscribe to 
there myspace or such so, you could get there bulletins for up incoming 
events.
3. when you get out after doing the above, you find more information by 
word of mouth, by a flyer handed to you, put on your car, or just 
laying around a venue. If by any chance you run into the person that is 
handing out flyers or is putting them on your car, you could ask him 
"what else is going on tonight?" they will most likely be able to 
assist you in that.

I've listened extensively to both, and I don't think Sirius' content 
holds a candle to XM's.  I just hope they don't eliminate any content 
through the merger.

LAST CHANCE FOR PRESALES!

Saturday March 29th, 2008
10PM to 6AM
In celebration of the rebirth of MOKSHA TRIBE, we bring you...

PHOENIX
Purchase Pre-sales tickets here: phoenix.mokshatribe.net

A universal symbol of the sun, mystical rebirth, resurrection and immortality, 
this legendary red "fire bird" was believed to die in its self-made flames 
periodically then rise again out of its own ashes. Linked to the worship of 
the fiery sun and sun gods such as Mexico's Quetzalcoatl, it was named "a god 
of Phoenicia" by the Phoenician. To alchemists, it symbolized the destruction 
and creation of new forms of matter along the way to the ultimate 
transformation: physical and spiritual

Your mentally challenged. What significant training in macro-economics do
you have to stir this pot. NONE. You're a tard. Anyone who believes the news
hype of the week is weak. Stay in school, forever, it's your only hope. Just
like Princess Leah seeking Obiwan. You will be chewed up and spit out in the
real world. "Help me deepfog you're my only hope."

Subject: Re: [sfraves] nrr: are we heading in for more than a recession?

actually you know i pray to god you're right and there won't be so  
much hyperinflation that people won't be able to buy food.  you don't  
need a degree in macro-economics to read news articles of people in  
argentina that were wealthy as americans one day then the next living  
in slums and pushing each other out of the way to eat raw hunks of  
meat.  when i really think about it i'd rather be called an idiot on  
this one and have this not happen.

don't step in front of the bus.  i take it back, it is not the plur  
thing to say.  this stuff is very stressful for me but it's a little  
less stressful when i have more than one lens to see this from.

Man, you should try curbing your vitriol sometime, pinkko, and see if you
can actually get into an interesting debate with someone else. Some back and

NOTHING I KNOW EVERYTEENG!!"

Like fur real. How's that drug habit going? :b

this is a good time to remind you all -  DO NOT EVER let the po-po in  
unless they have a warrant, or unless you were the one who called  
them!  this also goes for event venues.

if they show up at your event, lock the door behind you (have a secret  
knock set up ahead of time), go outside and chat. make sure you have  
I.D. on you. if there was a noise complaint made, offer to turn the  
music down.

i've done this twice, and it has worked the same way both times. the  
cops took down my info, gave me a warning, and said if they got  
another complaint and came back, they were giving me a citation.

it's important that 1) there's no olfactory or visual evidence of  
something fishy going on inside, 2) you're sober when you talk with  
them, and 3) there are no minors in view.

no warrant = no entry.  don't be a pushover and let them in when they  
say "mind if we have a look around?"  that's how you get busted!

Good article Marco nice statement Philip I think everyone on this list know=
s something or has something to add by experience or hearsay. Letting a pol=
ice officer search your home or car with your consent and no warrant is leg=
al but you are asking for troulbe if you agree and have something illegal i=
n your home or car.=20
=20
In college we use to debate this topic in class when I was writing my senio=
r thesis as an undergrad. We all know that if an officer does not have a wa=
rrant and has to ask then they do not have enough probable cause to conduct=
 the search. Although here is the catch that mostly applies to people in au=
tomobiles.=20
=20
Police pressure people and use many different tactics to persuade people to=
 conduct a search by asking them making it legal. I read a great case and I=
 recommend anyone with enough time on there hands to read it because it set=
s the precedent for illegal searches with the Supreme Court. Minnesota v. D=
ickerson, 508 U.S. 366 (1993).
=20
Or you can quickly read a case brief I wrote in 2006 for my legal analysis =
class listed below I have saved in my email history (read the fact section =
which describes the incident). Isaac
=20
Minnesota v. Dickerson, 508 U.S. 366 (1993).
=20
Procedural History: Dickerson=92s motion to suppress seizure of cocaine evi=
dence was denied by the District Court. As a result Dickerson was found gui=
lty and appealed. The Minnesota Court of Appeals reversed. The State appeal=
ed and the Minnesota Supreme Court affirmed. The U.S. Supreme Court granted=
 certiorari.
=20
Facts: Officers suspicious of Dickerson=92s elusive actions conducted a pat=
down search without a warrant. The search was permitted although it reveale=
d no weapons. While further searching Dickerson one of the officers felt a =
lump in Dickerson=92s jacket pocket. At this point, the officer did not bel=
ieve the lump was a weapon. The officer determined the lump in Dickerson=92=
s jacket was contraband after squeezing, sliding, and manipulating the pock=
et. Dickerson was arrested for possession of a controlled substance.
=20
Issues: (1) Does a protective search to discover weapons go beyond lawful b=
ounds if nonthreatening contraband is seized after no weapons are found?
=20
(2) Is the seizure of contraband obtained by squeezing, sliding, and manipu=
lating Dickerson=92s pocket permitted as evidence after a protective search=
 determined no weapons?=20
=20
Holdings: (1) Yes, (2) No
=20
Analysis: The Fourth Amendment protects "against unreasonable searches and =
seizures" barring a protective search to discover weapons without a warrant=
 based on reasonable suspicion. U.S.C.A. Const.Amend. 4. A search and seizu=
re to discover weapons is permitted without a warrant with reasonable suspi=
cion known as a Terry search. Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1 (1968). However, if=
 the search and seizure goes beyond what is necessary to discover weapons o=
r contraband its fruits will be suppressed. It is lawful by application of =
analogy during a Terry search to seize contraband other than weapons under =
the "plain view" doctrine through the sense of touch. Michigan v. Long, 463=
 U.S. 1032 (1983). The officer conducting the Terry search determined Dicke=
rson was not armed, however, the officer discovered a lump in Dickerson=92s=
 pocket. The officer did not immediately recognize the lump as contraband. =
In this case, contraband was obtained after searching Dickerson=92s pockets=
 by squeezing, sliding, and manipulating outside the lawful bounds of a Ter=
ry search.
=20
Holding: The U.S. Supreme Court affirmed judgement to suppress seizure of e=
vidence.

No it is NOT LEGAL for them to search you without a warrant or probable 
cause.

That is a misnomer. And whatever school taught you that should be burnt to 
the ground immediately.

Good article Marco nice statement Philip I think everyone on this list knows 
something or has something to add by experience or hearsay. Letting a police 
officer search your home or car with your consent and no warrant is legal 
but you are asking for troulbe if you agree and have something illegal in 
your home or car.

In college we use to debate this topic in class when I was writing my senior 
thesis as an undergrad. We all know that if an officer does not have a 
warrant and has to ask then they do not have enough probable cause to 
conduct the search. Although here is the catch that mostly applies to people 
in automobiles.

Police pressure people and use many different tactics to persuade people to 
conduct a search by asking them making it legal. I read a great case and I 
recommend anyone with enough time on there hands to read it because it sets 
the precedent for illegal searches with the Supreme Court. Minnesota v. 
Dickerson, 508 U.S. 366 (1993).

Or you can quickly read a case brief I wrote in 2006 for my legal analysis 
class listed below I have saved in my email history (read the fact section 
which describes the incident). Isaac

Minnesota v. Dickerson, 508 U.S. 366 (1993).

Procedural History: Dickersons motion to suppress seizure of cocaine 
evidence was denied by the District Court. As a result Dickerson was found 
guilty and appealed. The Minnesota Court of Appeals reversed. The State 
appealed and the Minnesota Supreme Court affirmed. The U.S. Supreme Court 
granted certiorari.

Facts: Officers suspicious of Dickersons elusive actions conducted a 
patdown search without a warrant. The search was permitted although it 
revealed no weapons. While further searching Dickerson one of the officers 
felt a lump in Dickersons jacket pocket. At this point, the officer did not 
believe the lump was a weapon. The officer determined the lump in Dickersons 
jacket was contraband after squeezing, sliding, and manipulating the pocket. 
Dickerson was arrested for possession of a controlled substance.

Issues: (1) Does a protective search to discover weapons go beyond lawful 
bounds if nonthreatening contraband is seized after no weapons are found?

(2) Is the seizure of contraband obtained by squeezing, sliding, and 
manipulating Dickersons pocket permitted as evidence after a protective 
search determined no weapons?

Holdings: (1) Yes, (2) No

Analysis: The Fourth Amendment protects "against unreasonable searches and 
seizures" barring a protective search to discover weapons without a warrant 
based on reasonable suspicion. U.S.C.A. Const.Amend. 4. A search and seizure 
to discover weapons is permitted without a warrant with reasonable suspicion 
known as a Terry search. Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1 (1968). However, if the 
search and seizure goes beyond what is necessary to discover weapons or 
contraband its fruits will be suppressed. It is lawful by application of 
analogy during a Terry search to seize contraband other than weapons under 
the "plain view" doctrine through the sense of touch. Michigan v. Long, 463 
U.S. 1032 (1983). The officer conducting the Terry search determined 
Dickerson was not armed, however, the officer discovered a lump in Dickersons 
pocket. The officer did not immediately recognize the lump as contraband. In 
this case, contraband was obtained after searching Dickersons pockets by 
squeezing, sliding, and manipulating outside the lawful bounds of a Terry 
search.

Holding: The U.S. Supreme Court affirmed judgement to suppress seizure of 
evidence.

Marco lets just say that type of search is a very murky gray area within th=
e law with no real definite answer! Read my "analysis" section of my case b=
rief.
=20
Probable cause is also very sketchy to challenge in some cases because it i=
s like someone not hiring you for a job because of your race. You would nev=
er know if you were not given that job because of racial discrimination so =
you are right to an extent but the issue goes much deeper with no real answ=
er! The reason why is because the warrant issue is constantly challeged and=
 won by law enforcement. It is also challenged by the person disputing the =
search and prevails from time to time.=20
=20
If law was as easy as reading legal books then there would be no need justi=
ce system to challenge the laws we have. I am an IP Litigation Paralegal so=
 I see a ton of different shit all the time that seems to be wrong but is r=
ight and prevails in court.

It only flies in court if there's not an expensive enough lawyer there to 
make it not fly any more.

Money talks.

Marco lets just say that type of search is a very murky gray area within the 
law with no real definite answer! Read my "analysis" section of my case 
brief.

Probable cause is also very sketchy to challenge in some cases because it is 
like someone not hiring you for a job because of your race. You would never 
know if you were not given that job because of racial discrimination so you 
are right to an extent but the issue goes much deeper with no real answer! 
The reason why is because the warrant issue is constantly challeged and won 
by law enforcement. It is also challenged by the person disputing the search 
and prevails from time to time.

If law was as easy as reading legal books then there would be no need 
justice system to challenge the laws we have. I am an IP Litigation 
Paralegal so I see a ton of different shit all the time that seems to be 
wrong but is right and prevails in court.


If it looks like a duck and walks like a duck then it is probably a duck...

way to take things out of context!  the next line:

A police spokeswoman said that if evidence of other crimes is found 
during voluntary searches, amnesty will be granted for that crime as well.

"Chief Lanier has been clear," Traci Hughes said. "Amnesty means amnesty."

So instead of disposing of the murder weapon, invite police in to your room,
and you're granted amnesty..  hmm

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Nrr: XM-Sirius merger approved by DOJ

As a former competitor of sorts of both XM and Sirius when I was at Live365, I can say that it is very unlikely that anyone else will launch satellites to compete with the merged company.  These satellite constellations cost billions to launch and the revenue resulting from neither of the companies at the present time really justifies the expense. 

The only competition likely to arise in the short run is from wireless broadband Internet which (at least in the short term) will be delivered by cellular networks rather than satellites.  

Note however satellite radio has a very favorable rate position compared with Internet radio offerings...

Regards,

Peter

Subject: [sfraves] NRR: Economic Depression? Naw... (was Re: [sfraves] (nrr) QOD (Tue))

I go on vacation for a couple of days and you guys have all the fun without me?

I'd say the probability of a serious economic depression in the United States is actually pretty low, but of course not zero.  Be careful what you wish for however.  Conspiracy fuckwads such as Jeff Rense are not a very good source of information here.  Rense has been yelling "depression" at everry economic downturn since he's been on the air. One almost imagines he's wishing for it to happen.  I guess this is just another item on Rense's extensive menu of fear and hate, but its also worth remembering that the events of the Great Depression were triggered by a panic as well as an actual economic event.

Anyway most of these low budget analyses are flawed by failing to understand the differences between the economic systems operating in the 1920s and 30s as compared to what we see today.  There's the little detail of unemployment remaining under 5% of course.  But you'll probably hear a lot more about the differences in the regulatory regimes in the press.  However the biggest difference IMO is global connectivity of economic systems.  If a serious depression were to hit the U.S., would you really be better off somewhere else?  Other than perhaps Europe, the answer is probably no.

To understand what I am talking about it is worth reviewing another news story this week that got a lot less attention than the housing collapse and resulting fiscal instability: Honduran cantelopes.  The FDA recently announced that a number of people had been sickened by Salmonella contaminaiton possibly resulting from eating cantelopes.  Fear of a drop in demand for melons prompted the president of the Honduras to issue a statement decrying the FDA's rash announcement. That is, even the threat of a reduction in demand from the U.S., not even an actual reduction in demand, was enough to prompt the leader of another nation to issue a public statement.  That's a good indication of just how big our markets (and supermarkets) are compared to the rest of the world.

The truth is if that the U.S. entered a depression, the world economy as a whole would probably collapse.  People would starve world wide and the U.S. might very well see the least of it.  Consider the global effect of a sudden and nearly complete drop in U.S. demand for consumer electronics for example.

As another example, consider the cost of the war in Iraq.  We've all taken on a significant debt as the result of the Bush administration's war in Iraq.  But its worth asking where exactly we borrowed this much money?  The answer is in large part China.  China opposed the Iraq war in the U.N. and in their public statements but at the same time loaned the U.S. the money to fight the war in the first place.  It is unclear we even could have fought the war without these loans.  Not everything is as it appears in U.S. Today perhaps.

And if the U.S. where to default on these loans, who'd be worse off the U.S. or China?  I think that this is quite unclear and therefore its simply not going to be allowed to happen by either party.  Its a new more evolved form of Mutually Assured Destruction.

Finally, in conclusion, listen to what Philip has to say here about preparing yourself somehow because if you are all correct about the future of our economy simply whining about it on the Internets won't be of much use to you.

Best,

Peter

03/26/08 Edition:

Special Guest DJ's:
Formless (Flytrap / Day of Hugs / Bete Noire - UK)

Dan Jones is a London based DJ and producer with a long-standing passion for 
underground house music. Djing and producing under the name Formless, he has 
been rocking clubs around London with a blend of forward thinking tech house 
and dirty electro beats.
In the last 12 months he has been creating a buzz with his unique, 
energetic, upfront sound at respected London venues like The Cross, 
Turnmills, Pacha, The Key and The Island. His brisk ascent through the DJ 
ranks came on the back of a number of DJ mix competition wins and playing a 
live set on MoS Radio. This gave the exposure needed to push his sound onto 
bigger dancefloors. Having consolidated his position in London, Formless is 
now taking his music to the international club scene.

With more dates in San Francisco, Sydney, Brisbane and the Ukraine on the 
horizon, time in the studio working on a new solo EP and a number of remixes 
and collaborations, the future looks bright for one of djing's freshest 
talents. On top of DJ and production commitments Dan has just launched his 
own night Flytrap, already hosting parties at The Cross, The Island & Pacha 
London. He still finds time every summer to co-ordinate the music for the 
Norgstock Festival (nr. Stonehenge) and run his own Day of Hugs bi-annual 
Manor House Party (nr. Bournemouth).

How about you suck my cock, asshole? I don't go around telling you what the
fuck to say to people. I'd appreciate the same consideration from you.

Besides, are you really going to argue the point that it's *not* stupid to
call someone else stupid while completely ignoring the rules of the language
you're using to do so?

FUCK.

Yep, I was thinking more of someone already in place with their own sats...
Some type of major communications network... Throwing a little bandwidth our
way ;) 

While on the subject though... I think today starts the WMC!

I looked online, and you sign up a 3 day online trial for free, no cc
required.

It's only the first couple hours and some phat beats are already being
dropped!

As a former competitor of sorts of both XM and Sirius when I was at Live365,
I can say that it is very unlikely that anyone else will launch satellites
to compete with the merged company.  These satellite constellations cost
billions to launch and the revenue resulting from neither of the companies
at the present time really justifies the expense. 

The only competition likely to arise in the short run is from wireless
broadband Internet which (at least in the short term) will be delivered by
cellular networks rather than satellites.  

Note however satellite radio has a very favorable rate position compared
with Internet radio offerings...

Regards,

Peter

There are a lot more reasons to lack faith in the current economy than to
have faith in it. We're looking at the US moving from a manufacturing based
economy to a service based economy. This is to say, instead of making
things, we're seeing more and more people working in the service industry.
Those jobs Bush loves to brag about making? Most of them are at places like
Wal-Mart. The infrastructure of this country is rotting out from under our
feet, and on top of it we're running out of oil.

Things ain't lookin too good.

Excellent point about growing your own veggies, though. The less you can
come to rely on globalized infrastructure the better off you'll be when it
starts to collapse.

I myself would be FUCKED if the shit hit the fan tomorrow, since I almost
always eat out and rarely even so much as buy groceries. I need to learn how
to garden or something. FUCK.

PAN-POT

A pan-pot is a simple, workaday knob, given to side-to-side flip-flopping
and not much else. Pan-Pot, on the other hand, are a brilliantly
multidimensional Berlin duo currently twisting house and techno fans into
rapturous fits.

In just a few short years, Pan-Pot--the duo comprised of Tassilo Ippenberge=
r
and Thomas Benedix=97-have become a central presence in electronic dance
music's most advanced sectors. Their rise parallels that of their home
label, Anja Schneider's Mobilee, coming at a time when established
categories are breaking down and accepted notions of "minimal" (please) are
giving way to an unprecedented degree of dynamism on demanding dancefloors.

Pan-Pot's vinyl debut came in May 2005 with the Popy & Caste EP
(mobilee002), featuring two cuts bursting with gritty, dirty funk, as thoug=
h
they'd scraped all the gunk from beneath the knobs of their gear, packed it
into a ball and sent it rolling across the nightclub. Since then, in
addition to their contribution to the Extra EP (mobilee005 plus), backing
Daniel Stefanik's anthemic banger "The Bells," they've released three more
EPs on Mobilee (Obscenity, mobilee005; Black Lodge, mobilee012; and What Is
What, mobilee023) and two on Einmaleins Musik. Their kinetic, undulating
grooves have proved particularly tempting to other producers=97-Jesse Rose,
Lee Van Dowski, Agn=E8s, Barem and Camea have all taken (pot)shots at
reworking the group's tunes=97-and their own remixing skills are increasing=
ly
in demand: Pan- Pot have put their immediately recognizable spin on tracks
by Misc., Anja Schneider & Sebo K, Tim Xavier, Dapayk Solo, Sweet 'n Candy,
and Dami=E1n Schwartz, among others.

The release of their debut album marks yet another milestone for the group.
Appropriately titled Pan-O-Rama, the record=97-which has the honor of being
the first artist album released on Mobilee=97-offers a 360-degree tour of
techno at its most twisted, balancing ominous atmospherics with an unusual
lightness of touch, and running classic machine music through silicon's
digital wringer.

They may name themselves after a piece of gear, but Pan-Pot's music is
ultimately about moving bodies, not knobs. Both live and as DJs, Pan-Pot
deliver on that promise with sets that rope together crisply minimal, cooll=
y
restrained techno and hot and heavy house. Anyone who's ever played with an
analog synthesizer knows that all those pots and dials are there to be
touched; Pan-Pot reaches out and touches right back=97with a love slap from
the heart of the Berlin underground.

CLINT STEWART

In a sea of heads, Clint Stewart can't contain his enthusiasm. "It's an
amazing time for dance music," says the Auralism assistant label manager.
"There's so much good music and an endless list of people making it. It's
inspiring." The Florida-born DJ / producer / promoter is true to his word,
commanding crowds with ease and producing sexy, gauzy cuts that exhort
everyone to dance.

Growing up in a home surrounded by the sounds of classical music to classic
rock and early blues, he began training in classical piano and guitar. Over
time Stewart's adolescent obsession with punk's passion and aggression ("I
hated dance music") led to a college-age awakening to techno's dark,
relentless groove. A stint on UNF College Radio Station gave him the
opportunity to start Nocturnal Underground radio show where he met Marc
Smith. After college he moved to Miami and began eventually joining forces
with Auralism co-founders Marc Smith and Jason Short and playing at their
residency at Jazid. Within the year, Stewart moved to Hawaii for a brief
stint to "get away", but was soon living in San Francisco after a gig in
which he never stepped foot on his return flight.

Since joining the Auralism camp, Stewart has been "going 100 miles an hour,
all day, every day," playing high-profile DJ gigs with top artists among as
well as a particularly sizzling set at SF's annual LoveFest. In addition
pounding the pavement for Auralism, Stewart has a growing list of
productions out there, including a pair of ecstatic remixes for the label's
inaugural Aural Therapy 1.1 compilation. That's a lot of work for a short
time in a new town, but master multi-tasker Stewart's just getting started.

PAN-POT

A pan-pot is a simple, workaday knob, given to side-to-side flip-flopping
and not much else. Pan-Pot, on the other hand, are a brilliantly
multidimensional Berlin duo currently twisting house and techno fans into
rapturous fits.

In just a few short years, Pan-Pot--the duo comprised of Tassilo Ippenberger
and Thomas Benedix-have become a central presence in electronic dance
music's most advanced sectors. Their rise parallels that of their home
label, Anja Schneider's Mobilee, coming at a time when established
categories are breaking down and accepted notions of "minimal" (please) are
giving way to an unprecedented degree of dynamism on demanding dancefloors.

Pan-Pot's vinyl debut came in May 2005 with the Popy & Caste EP
(mobilee002), featuring two cuts bursting with gritty, dirty funk, as though
they'd scraped all the gunk from beneath the knobs of their gear, packed it
into a ball and sent it rolling across the nightclub. Since then, in
addition to their contribution to the Extra EP (mobilee005 plus), backing
Daniel Stefanik's anthemic banger "The Bells," they've released three more
EPs on Mobilee (Obscenity, mobilee005; Black Lodge, mobilee012; and What Is
What, mobilee023) and two on Einmaleins Musik. Their kinetic, undulating
grooves have proved particularly tempting to other producers-Jesse Rose,
Lee Van Dowski, Agns, Barem and Camea have all taken (pot)shots at
reworking the group's tunes-and their own remixing skills are increasingly
in demand: Pan- Pot have put their immediately recognizable spin on tracks
by Misc., Anja Schneider & Sebo K, Tim Xavier, Dapayk Solo, Sweet 'n Candy,
and Damin Schwartz, among others.

The release of their debut album marks yet another milestone for the group.
Appropriately titled Pan-O-Rama, the record-which has the honor of being
the first artist album released on Mobilee-offers a 360-degree tour of
techno at its most twisted, balancing ominous atmospherics with an unusual
lightness of touch, and running classic machine music through silicon's
digital wringer.

They may name themselves after a piece of gear, but Pan-Pot's music is
ultimately about moving bodies, not knobs. Both live and as DJs, Pan-Pot
deliver on that promise with sets that rope together crisply minimal, coolly
restrained techno and hot and heavy house. Anyone who's ever played with an
analog synthesizer knows that all those pots and dials are there to be
touched; Pan-Pot reaches out and touches right backwith a love slap from
the heart of the Berlin underground.

CLINT STEWART

In a sea of heads, Clint Stewart can't contain his enthusiasm. "It's an
amazing time for dance music," says the Auralism assistant label manager.
"There's so much good music and an endless list of people making it. It's
inspiring." The Florida-born DJ / producer / promoter is true to his word,
commanding crowds with ease and producing sexy, gauzy cuts that exhort
everyone to dance.

Growing up in a home surrounded by the sounds of classical music to classic
rock and early blues, he began training in classical piano and guitar. Over
time Stewart's adolescent obsession with punk's passion and aggression ("I
hated dance music") led to a college-age awakening to techno's dark,
relentless groove. A stint on UNF College Radio Station gave him the
opportunity to start Nocturnal Underground radio show where he met Marc
Smith. After college he moved to Miami and began eventually joining forces
with Auralism co-founders Marc Smith and Jason Short and playing at their
residency at Jazid. Within the year, Stewart moved to Hawaii for a brief
stint to "get away", but was soon living in San Francisco after a gig in
which he never stepped foot on his return flight.

Since joining the Auralism camp, Stewart has been "going 100 miles an hour,
all day, every day," playing high-profile DJ gigs with top artists among as
well as a particularly sizzling set at SF's annual LoveFest. In addition
pounding the pavement for Auralism, Stewart has a growing list of
productions out there, including a pair of ecstatic remixes for the label's
inaugural Aural Therapy 1.1 compilation. That's a lot of work for a short
time in a new town, but master multi-tasker Stewart's just getting started.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR: Economic Depression? Naw... (was Re: [sfraves] 
     (nrr) QOD (Tue))

Remember that just because manufacturing jobs have been shipped overseas
does not make us dependent on imports like all the sensationalist
"pundits" like to make us think. The USA is the richist country in the
world in terms of readily-available natural resources. The only thing we
really must import is fuel. I agree that we are heavily dependent on this.
However, we are not dependent on importing stuff like food, which China is
for example. We can grow our own food, mine our own ore, and cut our own
timber. China cannot. This is one thing a lot of people fail to mention
when discussing our debt with China: China needs us a helluva lot more
than we need them. If things start to become too costly for us to import,
we'll simply see a return of domestic manufacturing.

Also, there is nothing wrong with a service-based economy (the Netherlands
is a perfect example) as long as wages keep pace with the price of goods
and services.

The problem now is our runaway inflation and dependence on oil. The
inflation has been deliberately engineered by Bush as a stealth tax in
order to pay for the war that Bush has waged. Bush Co. and the Fed have
been deliberately devaluing the dollar so the deficit isn't as large. Bush
is our real problem. Look at the deficit before his term, WE HAD NONE,
even with massive importation of Chinese goods.

Inflation would be nowhere near what it is right now without Bush
literally funding the military industrial complex by using the Fed to
print their own money.

--

After the uprising of the 17th of June
The Secretary of the Writers Union
Had leaflets distributed in the Stalinallee
Stating that the people
Had thrown away the confidence of the government
And could win it back only
By redoubled efforts. Would it not be easier
In that case for the government
To dissolve the people
And elect another?

- Bertolt Brecht

Correct, not many satellite owners, too expensive for smaller operators
compared to just buying transponder space off someone else.  Really,
the lesson of XM/Sirius is that new technologies often start with too
small a market to survive by competing with each other.  Things need
to settle down for a bit to establish/grow the market, then as the
initial, natural monopoly gets unweildy, more nimble competitors spot
those inefficiencies and figure out ways around them.  In a few years
another player might be able to bulk buy surplus satt time (there is
actually almost always some unused transponder space available), or
maybe wireless metro-area wireless will take sufficient root to be
practical for streaming directly to mass-market mobile audio systems.

Anyway, point being that the requisite is to grow the audience first,
and someone will eventually figure out a way to get their money. :)

Yesterday actually, Lobby sets started at 9am, Poolside at noon.
I can't be there, but (BSP ALERT!) I do have Cesare vs Disorder

I'd have probably even bought a real sirius box if I'd known ahead of
time that they were going to carry the wmc.  talk about poor promotion. :)

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Nrr: XM-Sirius merger approved by DOJ + WMC STREAM!


Well, there are upgrades in terms of software, but how satellites work is
pretty well known to the engineers that do stuff with em.

Satts don't "hit" moving targets, they simply hit a given coverage zone
(a kidney shaped contour for a given power level).  It's not that the GPS
birds hit the receivers so much as the receivers are designed to track
satellites as the receiver moves.  The same thing works for media in the
form of the Satellite TV that some airlines offer on planes.  It just costs
more as the tracking has to get more responsive.  That dish used for home
is the cheap way since the house doesn't move relative to the satellite,
but marine receivers have long since been in the "affordable" range that
could handle it, and yes, there are the XM/Sirius type receivers that do
something similar, but it's all in the receiving equipment regardless.

The real innovation that makes things possible is changes in signal encoding
to make more efficient use of the bandwidth.  Traditional C-band gives way
to Ku-Band, 4PSK and then 8PSK improve things further.  Many options to
"compress" the stream to fit into a smaller data stream, with only minimal
changes in the big birds themselves up in orbit.

Subject: RE: [sfraves] WMC stream on Sirius Area 33

Yep! Looks like they repeated the show in the later afternoon, so I wouldn't
worry about missing too much at work!  

Let me know if you would like to get around the firewall stuff at work,
where there is a stream there is a way... Not sure if you meant you can't
listen due to security or because you're too busy... 

Anyway, it's been a great day for epic beats! I'll keep streaming over the
web, sucks though, my car stereo is much nicer than my pc speakers ;)

Subject: [sfraves] WMC stream on Sirius Area 33


I read some of the email headlines about the stream and at lunch today I was
driving and heard a live broadcast from the Raleigh Hotel in Miami. They are
interviewing DJ's and broadcasting live from different locations around the
WMC. 
 
I was like ok it is 12:30 PM here and about 3:30 PM in Miami I wonder how
many people are holding it down. Unfortunately I can not listen to music at
work... Sucks but it is the price I pay for working at a law firm. 
 
I think it is convenient for me to hear music from different places because
there is no way for me to get to Miami at this time. Once a year Area 33
broadcasts live from the WMC... I heard one of the Dj's talking about some
mix contests coming up on Beatport with web submissions and they were
talking about parties at Space and the Ultra Party music fest and all this
other shit.
 
 
Today I heard one of the DJ's mix Trick & Kubic - Easy and I was like I
remember that shit! The live broadcasts will be going down al week.
 
Isaac

I understand that completely, but resolving a dispute with a gun is

Are you deliberately being obtuse for the humor value? :)

Consider it this way.  A crackhead is standing in front of 222 Hyde
screaming his head off randomly.  Can you hear him?

If you're nowhere near Hyde/Eddy/Turk, you're simply out of range.

If you're inside 222 and it's Techno Tuesday, it's just too loud to notice.

If you're out front grabbing a smoke, you probably can, unless you're deaf.

None of these requires the crackhead to yell AT you.  Said crackhead might
even be able to be in physical contact with you and give you his cooties
without aiming a punch at you, for that matter.

You can even be walking by and hear him, without him needing the ability
(cognitive or motor) to turn and aim his rant at you.  There's no need
to upgrade the crackhead, you just have to make yourself ready to hear.

Still playing some stuff now and announcing they're in Miami for it, didn't
catch enough yet to tell if it's another repeat or actual overnight stuff,
guess I'll leave the stereo on. :)

Extract is supposed to be very potent (2x, 4x, etc.) regular leaf is  
not. Be very careful. Salvia is very powerful and disorienting. Have  
a sitter. If you're going to be alone, put a note on your door that  
says: "you are tripping, stay inside!"

do a google search for "d m turner salvia" and download the book from  
one of the torrent links.

It's definitely a powerful and disorienting psychedelic.  My 2-3 experiences
smoking it were all good, but many of my friends have felt the terror that
the saliva world they were trapped in, would go on until the end of time.
It's best to be smoked out of a bong, because the smoke is really, really
harsh.  I think the stuff I smoked was like 30x or 40x.  I wouldn't mind
trying 50x.  While I'm not Jerry Garcia, this is the one hallucinogen that
really seems to have the potential for an out of body experience, so be
prepared for the insane.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] salvia divinorum

I've never taken salvia, but one person I know that did described it as disorienting and disturbing.  He said he wouldn't take it again or recommend it.  Of course he also took it alone in a hotel room in Amsterdam after smoking vast amounts of weed over a three day period.

As with any psychedelic substance, IMO, you should first educate yourself (http://www.erowid.org/plants/salvia/salvia.shtml) and then ask yourself honestly why you are taking the plant/chemical and what you hope to learn or understand through the experience.  I've found that simply considering the desired outcome is a very useful guide to making decisions about taking mind altering substances.  I've even started doing this for alcohol and caffeine.  Often when I carefully consider my real purpose these days I end up going for a walk instead of getting that double espresso or whatever.  

Especially if you take larger doses of any of these substances you should not treat it as a "recreational" experience. Treat these substances carefully and take the experience seriously.  Consider set and setting  (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_and_setting)   

Having a safe location and sober sitter is always recommended for any unfamiliar substance especially since different people may respond very differently to the same dosage.  

YMMV.

Best,

Peter

Extract is supposed to be very potent (2x, 4x, etc.) regular leaf is  
not. Be very careful. Salvia is very powerful and disorienting. Have  
a sitter. If you're going to be alone, put a note on your door that  
says: "you are tripping, stay inside!"

do a google search for "d m turner salvia" and download the book from  
one of the torrent links.

    DJ Dan's - Attribute to James Brown???

Damn that boy played some funky ass breaks back in the day.  I just got 
a hold of a bunch of old Dan mixes and it's amazing how commercializing 
really takes the creativity out of their music.  He played such a range 
of genres and played them all so well, but now when i see or hear him 
his music is all bland and thrown together.  Same with all the other big 
DJ's too.  So so sad...Thank god people have really started archiving 
their old music and all new dj's are being archived as they go, so you 
can always enjoy a DJ when they were in their prime.

Special Guest DJ's:
Formless (Flytrap / Day of Hugs / Bete Noire - UK)

Dan Jones is a London based DJ and producer with a long-standing passion for 
underground house music. Djing and producing under the name Formless, he has 
been rocking clubs around London with a blend of forward thinking tech house 
and dirty electro beats.
In the last 12 months he has been creating a buzz with his unique, 
energetic, upfront sound at respected London venues like The Cross, 
Turnmills, Pacha, The Key and The Island. His brisk ascent through the DJ 
ranks came on the back of a number of DJ mix competition wins and playing a 
live set on MoS Radio. This gave the exposure needed to push his sound onto 
bigger dancefloors. Having consolidated his position in London, Formless is 
now taking his music to the international club scene.

With more dates in San Francisco, Sydney, Brisbane and the Ukraine on the 
horizon, time in the studio working on a new solo EP and a number of remixes 
and collaborations, the future looks bright for one of djing's freshest 
talents. On top of DJ and production commitments Dan has just launched his 
own night Flytrap, already hosting parties at The Cross, The Island & Pacha 
London. He still finds time every summer to co-ordinate the music for the 
Norgstock Festival (nr. Stonehenge) and run his own Day of Hugs bi-annual 
Manor House Party (nr. Bournemouth).

Damn that boy played some funky ass breaks back in the day.  I just got 
a hold of a bunch of old Dan mixes and it's amazing how commercializing 
really takes the creativity out of their music.  He played such a range

Well, you're the one who phrased it as the need to hit a moving target,
couldn't tell from your first counter-reply if you'd since gotten it as
all you addressed was the semantics of the word "hit." :)

exactly.  crackhead's soundwaves can hit you without him targetting you.
crackhead metaphors are more fun than sun examples, I think. :)

though, I enjoy spending time in the sun more than I do time listening
to crackheads rant.

ok, back to day job. :)

Subject: Re: [sfraves] salvia divinorum

i tried it a couple years ago and its definitely not "weak".

i bought i think the 10x stuff, hit it out of a bong (yeah, the smoke
is harsh and smells kinda gross), and honestly wasn't expecting much,
as it was sold over the counter at smoke shops.

the next thing i know i was really disoriented, confused about what
had happened/where i was/how i got there, and things felt "weird", in
an uncomfortable kind of way.  things looked strange and kind of
electric, borders became jagged in a harsh and uglyish way (i had
feelings/images of comb teeth), and i felt like there was this
twisting kind of "torque" pressure all around me.  i had my "sitter"
(the person not fucked up) take the pipe from me cuz i felt like it
was going to break in my hand from the twisting force.  weird, i know.

after several seconds, eventually i kinda remembered "oh yeah, you're
fucked up on some weird drug" and from there i was more able to just
kind of observe, knowing its effects would subside shortly.
ultimately, the feeling was intriguing but kind of
disturbing/uncomfortable, and i was looking forward to coming down.  i
tried it a couple more times that week (there was still some left) out
of continued curiosity or to have other people try it with me and get
their reactions.  everyone generally found it "interesting" but no one
would really say they "liked" it.  the one thing many people can agree
upon tho, is that its alot more powerful and mind-bending than they
were expecting!  i'd see the abuse potential of this drug as being
very low, due mostly to the fact that its not exactly "fun". i can't
name a single person who's tried it and has went on to become a
regular user of the stuff.

it is most definitely "interesting" tho, and if you're a fan of
exploring altered states of consciousness from a sort of "research"
perspective (as i am), i'd say its worth trying once or twice just for
the experience.  thankfully it doesnt last too long.

if you're looking for a good time tho, i'd say skip it.  i doubt i'll
ever try it again.


now, dmt on the other hand.....   ;)

Rather than getting the smokeable kind, I suggest you trying the extract - 
liquid form.

But I have a feeling it'll be the last time you ever try it - cuz I have 
literally seen peopel cry for their mommy while in that state. Looks 
excruciatingly uncomfortable to me.

If yer gonna bother with natural hallucinogens, you should just get some 
DMT.

yo....

http://skillsdjworkshop.com/pop08/

this is in late may, and IMHO will be teh uber-geigh, but if you're a
first timer looking for the big "MEGA-RAVE" experience, it don't get
much ravey-er than this.

when you get a bit more accustomed to "the scene" (and maybe grow a
few years older) you'll likely look back and realize just how baaaad
events like this are in comparison to underground events thrown for
the love, not money. but until then, it should have lots of flashing
lights, booming sound, and plenty of big acts.

good luck and have fun.

Point well-taken, but I've seen worse line-up's. I would suggest joining the Evil Breaks mailing list or checking out sfhousemusic.com to get in tune with some of the other haps out here.

this is in late may, and IMHO will be teh uber-geigh, but if you're a
first timer looking for the big "MEGA-RAVE" experience, it don't get
much ravey-er than this.

when you get a bit more accustomed to "the scene" (and maybe grow a
few years older) you'll likely look back and realize just how baaaad
events like this are in comparison to underground events thrown for
the love, not money. but until then, it should have lots of flashing
lights, booming sound, and plenty of big acts.

good luck and have fun.

i agree 100% and would never consider attending such a whack-fest myself.

but the kids gotta start somwhere, and homeboy said he's looking for
an 18+ "epic" RAVE. this seems to fit the bill, "lame" or not, no?

plus, then at least he'll have some experience to reference when
dissing events like this in the future. ;)

I will definitely be cautious after hearing everyones feedback. I am only 
going to take a little just for kicks. I guess that is why this stuff is 
legal and not very popular. I saw it on the news while I was at the gym and 
some Cal frat dude being interviewed said they grow it and take it at 
parties. The news lady bought a bag at a smoke shop like Greg mentioned in 
Berkeley on Telegraph. I guess I will stick to my favorite choice green 
dank.

L.A. Times Apologizes for Shakur Story
March 27, 2008, 6:12 AM EST

LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The Los Angeles Times apologized for using documents 
that were apparently fabricated in a story implicating associates of Sean 
"Diddy" Combs in a 1994 assault on rapper Tupac Shakur.

"The bottom line is that the documents we relied on should not have been

newspaper's Web site. "We apologize both to our readers and to those 
referenced in the documents ... and in the story."

Subject: [sfraves] Nrr: Earth Lights out for 60 min - join me spread the word!!

I would think a city like SF would get into this but I
doubt you'll see a dent in the light of SF skyline
tomorrow eve... Anyways a good thing to do if you want
to en-rich that self karma a little :-)

http://www.earthhourus.org

On March 29, 2008 at 8 p.m., join millions of people
around the world in making a statement about climate
change by turning off your lights for Earth Hour, an
event created by the World Wildlife Fund. 

Earth Hour was created by WWF in Sydney, Australia in
2007, and in one year has grown from an event in one
city to a global movement. In 2008, millions of
people, businesses, governments and civic
organizations in nearly 200 cities around the globe
will turn out for Earth Hour. More than 100 cities
across North America will participate, including the
US flagshipsAtlanta, Chicago, Phoenix and San
Francisco and Ottawa, Montreal, Toronto and Vancouver.


We invite everyone throughout North America and around
the world to turn off the lights for an hour starting
at 8 p.m. (your own local time)whether at home or at
work, with friends and family or solo, in a big city
or a small town. 

What will you do when the lights are off? We have lots
of ideas. 

Join people all around the world in showing that you
care about our planet and want to play a part in
helping to fight climate change. Dont forget to sign
up and let us know you want to join Earth Hour. 

One hour, America. Earth Hour. Turn out for Earth
Hour! 

PS
Who's bringing out the dynamo powered sound system /
power generating dance floor for a serious dark  earth
party??? - LOL I guess drum circle would be as good as
it gets... hmmm Dolores Park anyone for a little
evening starter?

see, chilldren - I am here to lend perspective
to your sense of aging . . . . and believe me
the decades add up . . . surprisingly (increasingly) fast

however, I am happy to report that the
accumulation of years has NOTHING
to do with the accumulation of maturity
or an inability to have a good time -

looking forward to dancing with those of you
who I know - and those of you who I have
yet to meet - both on Saturday AND Sunday !!

Is it really anti-social if it's in a room of a few hundred 
people? ;-)

Oh well, see everyone there regardless.

I don't think I've heard any hints about this, but maybe one of the Moshka
tribe's people might be willing to give us a geographic clue as to where
this party may be.  I'm hoping SF or Central East Bay location...

Subject: [sfraves] Phoenix...

"There is in Egypt a well-known city celebrated for its pious sacrifices an=
d dedicated to the worship of the Sun. Its temples rest on a hundred column=
s hewn from the quarries of Thebes. Here, as the story tells, the Phoenix i=
s wont to store his father=E2=80=99s ashes and, adoring the image of the go=
d [Ra aka Helios and Apollo], his master, to entrust his precious burden to=
 the flames. He places on the altar that from which he is sprung and that w=

 shrine is filled with the holy smoke of the altar and the odour of Indian =
incense, penetrating even as far as the Pelusiac marshes, fills the nostril=
s of men, flooding them with its kindly influence and with a scent sweeter =
than that nectar which perfumes the seven mouths of the dark Nile."=0A=0AFr=

That second story is pretty interesting. I'm pretty sure I'd have to go back to work because I'd spend all the money on records. . .  Speaking of records, you seen this collection on eBay yet???

Subject: [sfraves] [BSP] Yes, Cesare vs Disorder is here TONIGHT!


Feeling left out in the cold because you couldn't go to Miami for the
WMC?  Have no fear, come drink some beer (and tip your bar staff well),
the WMC has come to SF!

You may have heard Lee Curtis or Alex Smoke playing a Cesare vs Disorder
track, even bought them on Beatport, but unless you've been hitting parties
in the London underground (a city well known for great parties) in recent
years you've likely never had the chance to hear Cesare spin live, until now.

Yes, Cesare vs Disorder has arrived for his first US visit ever!  After
his successful conference-lobby spin on Tuesday, he was shuttled about
town deep into Wednesday night to keep on cranking it out.  Now he's
bringing some Miami heat to Anu TONIGHT before jetting off to NYC like
the megastar he is.  Combined with our own versatile and consistent DJ
SAYAKA, this is the hot party and your chance to see what the early
conference buzz was all about.

RAY presents: 

F A K T I O N : because san francisco needs another techno cult
with special guests and extended sets:

Friday, 28 March 2008:
Cesare vs Disorder - MEAN,KALIMARI,STOCK 5,STHLM [ Italy|UK ] 
DJ SAYAKA - BABD/Faktion [ Japan|San Francisco ]

Last Fridays @ Anu

Cesare vs Disorder:
London based, Italian born DJ, music producer, creative Cesare Marchese aka
Cesare vs Disorder (also "Queen AtOm") has been involved in the european
underground music scene for the last 10 years.  His skills and passion for
DJing has taken him around Italy, to Berlin, Poland, Finland, Switzerland,
Brazil, and of course his current home in the UK, where he continues to
also produce, having formed EssentialReload and newborn labels MEAN and
SERIALISM.

This is Cesare vs Disorder's ONLY scheduled West Coast appearance before
he returns to London, nestled in between his appearances in Miami and NYC.
Don't miss out!

DJ SAYAKA is known around the world for her consistent mastery of always
difficult downtempo, medodic techno, flawless track track selection and
natural progression.  Recently returned from her own globe-trecking gigs,
including NYC and Tokyo, it's our good fortune she's called San Francisco
home since 2004.

That second story is pretty interesting. I'm pretty sure I'd have to go back to work because I'd spend all the money on records. . .  Speaking of records, you seen this collection on eBay yet???

Well, no matter what kind of swill folks may drink to quench their thirst, I hope they leave room for some eatin'
I've been busy making yummy snax for the party so be ready to get snacky, I don't want any left overs :)
Got tons of hummus, salsa, and fresh fruit, plus some more surprises.

See y'all there, I'll be the one hovering around the food most of the night .

Mickey's sorta a class on its own.  I'd rank it above butt, coors, 
pbr, but below lagunitas, guinness or sierra nevada.

Never heard of MesterBrau - where can I get some?

Meister Brau was a nasty cheap beer from Miller back in the day, don't
think they make it anymore.  Come to think of it however, I think the
original brewery called Meister Brau (Miller bought the company for
the name/label) had a light beer which lives on as Miller Lite, but
the full on undiluted stuff is gone.

Let's not forget Lucky Lager and Schaeffer.  Schaeffer isn't really beer tho, its sort of a watery beer substitute.  Its the processed cheese food of beer.

Lucky Lager had rebuses in the cap too BTW.

The pizza place I used to work at in high school used to sell Michelob Dark on tap.  I don't think it was really dark beer so much as Michelob that was accidentally colored wrong.  That was some fine drinking.  My partner in crime at the time and I drank more of one keg than the customers leading the owners to ban employees drinking on the job.  We quit shortly thereafter.

Best,

Peter

Meister Brau was a nasty cheap beer from Miller back in the day, don't
think they make it anymore.  Come to think of it however, I think the
original brewery called Meister Brau (Miller bought the company for
the name/label) had a light beer which lives on as Miller Lite, but
the full on undiluted stuff is gone.

Me too, my legs are completely fucking destroyed, and it'll

for the dope shit.

Me too, my legs are completely fucking destroyed, and it'll 
probably be worse tomorrow. I'm gonna have nightmares of

Does SFRaves have like an answer guy, or girl, you know someone that  
like knows everything and can give you advice?  Like for instance I'm  
sitting here typing this and I forgot the question I was going to ask.  
  Let's see, who knows everything ... hmm ... anyway, jump on up there  
if you're feeling up to it.

I suppose I could settle for an SFRaves psychic.  Anyone want to  
volunteer?  First question.  Will I get stuck in traffic today on the  
way to downtown?

Yeah, thanks for letting me use the pillow, I'll have to add a pillow and
blanket to my standard party bag (along with a bigger bag to hold it all!)
that I bring. :)

Actually felt surprisingly ok.  That was only the 2nd time I've ever really
blacked out (1st was at that cool lesbian bar with the nastyass carpets),
and this time have a pretty good idea why.  Getting up when I did worked,
was able to help cleanup a little, took it easy yesterday, tried 5HTP to
help get my sleep back on cycle and it seems to have helped, today I feel
almost back to normal in time for my day job. :)  

hugs!

You mean the flight room?  That was Jose Padilla, wasn't that some sick shit
he was serving up?  I'm glad I got there early!

Yeah, loved the bass on that side, could just feel it pulsing through.

I was pretty far gone by that point; did I really hear Forest spinning
trancey/nontechno stuff or was my brain just totally crosswired? :)
memories definitely quite fragmented from that point on...

> I saw Osby and Marco briefly, Agent Smith and his beautiful and brilliant wife, and of course Terry.  Didn't meet any new peeps from the list, but I did meet some cool folks from other walks of life.  I spent a good amount of time talking with another Peter and his girlfriend S. from Saratoga as well Finney from UCB.  I had a nice talk with Rob from Moksha Tribe while he was working the hooka room as well.  It was good to see the vibe fresh in so many younger kids, although I got a bit worried about S later in the evening as she was getting a little spaced.

Hey Peter, I DID go and I ended up having a really great time.  The  
Moksha folks were amazing -- definitely the best organization at a  
party like this that I've seen, the fruit trays were never empty!

We got there a little after midnight -- I looked for you briefly at  
first but got pretty into the dancing not too long into it. :)  I  
didn't know the DJs before I came, but I'm definitely going to check  
out more of Forest Green and Brian Behlendorf!

I was wearing a brown tiger shirt (yellow, blue, red) and a pair of  
white pants with white fur bunny silhouettes sewn onto it.

I hope I get to meet you next time!

Well, I know I was very confused by that point, so don't take anything I'm
recounting past about 1am as terribly authoritative. :)

Actually, I vaguely recall someone else up there at the same time as her?
Maybe I'm confusing a DJ changeover.  Who was after Forest?

Subject: Re: [sfraves] oh moh-kshaaaa

Thanks for the ride Peter! I looked for you so we could swill that 
Glenfiddich, but couldn't track you down...I got pulled into a number of 
different spots throughout the night, including non-party spots in the 
venue, so, I was MIA half the night.

Some of the sickest visuals I've seen you guys do Terry...

I especially enjoyed the bit that was sort of mathematical formulas (ok I'm 
a math nerd)  and then there was a dna strand rotating as well.  Oh and also 
the game footage with the sort of punk night club scene.  That was totally 
perfect.

I got to the party early and also heard Andy W. vs Chris Jackson...some 
great techno that was excellently complimented by the visuals.  But it was 
still  pretty early and there weren't that many people on the dance floor 
yet...

I kept wandering into the small side room as well.  Was that Brian B. that 
opened?  I tried to circle back and introduce myself if it was, but he was 
gone and I never found him again.  Ah well.

Someone (DV8?) played a great dirty house set after Bam's breaks that was 
just what the Doctor ordered.  The sound in that little room was kicking, 
especially in this one spot on the left whjer ehte bass was coming through 
the floor just right...

Then I was back out in the main room for Dragn'fly and Forest Green's 
excellent sets.  I ran out of steam around 2:30 and headed for the door.

I saw Osby and Marco briefly, Agent Smith and his beautiful and brilliant 
wife, and of course Terry.  Didn't meet any new peeps from the list, but I 
did meet some cool folks from other walks of life.  I spent a good amount of 
time talking with another Peter and his girlfriend S. from Saratoga as well 
Finney from UCB.  I had a nice talk with Rob from Moksha Tribe while he was 
working the hooka room as well.  It was good to see the vibe fresh in so 
many younger kids, although I got a bit worried about S later in the evening 
as she was getting a little spaced.

I never saw Adriana tho...did you make it?  Hope that worked out.

Great party, great venue as always (a lighter in the vending machine, thank 
you!) , and great people.  Only negative: the kitchen ran out of red bull at 
around 2AM, forcing me to remember why I hate drinking Coca Cola at parties.

Best,

Peter

I've been raving every weekend for hmm half a year now... And I must say,
this was the best successful effort I've seen go in to a party.  From the
map point to the visuals, to the food (Wtf free food haha no one does that),
to the music.

SUPER duper dope beats all night. 

D-fly + Terry, and Osby, awesome to meet you! Party legends no doubt.  Met a
lot of people that night, a welcome change from the prostitots at "normal"

Fucking awesome night, thanks to all involved, I gave as much $ as I could

I loved your shirt.  Prostitots is a new word to me.  Heard it for the first
time yesterday after going back to OW to check up on things. :)  Not a lot
of parties are this well done, but there are a lot of parties with an older
crowd.  The rave scene in this area was started by a bunch of tech geeks who
are now in their early 30s to mid 40s and still party regularly. 

Try to attend Friends n Family, Urban Wasteland, and other like parties.

Yarr, thanks to all the earlier birds who caught ChrisJ and I doing the 
do, good times.  Hard to believe I had to pull a favor to get him to come 
out of DJ retirement to spin... just a little taste of mixing and a good 
crowd, by the end of the night he'd dropped records with every DJ that 
would let him.  Heheheheh.

And awesome seeing some of the old heads, getting my groove on to some of 
the biz in the side room, enjoying the food, chilling with my girlfriend, 
visiting the locals and all that good stuff... whee!

Hey man!  Decided to check back in after, oh, 7 years?!?

Peace,
J

P.S.  I have a story to share about my wife's 35th birthday jam.  More

Peace out!
Mira? Leg of Eel (Lee Fogel)?, Larry Chin?
