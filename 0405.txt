Ok, I cannot be the only one who has had the typical late night BART =

Why do the damn trains not run later than 12:15 or so?=20

have the safest trains in the country because we shut them down every =
night in order to run a thorough check on the system."=20

OK, that is fine, but what if you are having a fantastic time in the =

seem to have a lot in common. In my case, this was a younger person, who =

(the last one out of Powell), there was not time to connect. (Even with =

at a friend's house).=20

OK, I want some advice. Do you be responsible, worry about getting back =
to the car (wherever it is BART-parked), or do you just go with the =
flow? I am tired of being responsible when it comes to adventures in the =
City, because my time here is limited.=20

Please tell me your BART STORIES, off list or on list.=20

How did you make the human connection instead of worrying about the =
train connection? Did you take a cab? Did you sleep over?

Now I know why I perpetually drive the car over the bridge like Marin =
county trendsetters who are North Beach "wannabes."

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR: BART Bitch session (missed human connections)

a couple of years ago me and marty and bekki went to see The Green Mile 
at the Metreon Theater downtown.  we all lived at the EBF house at the 
time, and none of us had running cars at the time, so we walked to 
rockridge bart and caught the 9:20 show.

the movie blew me away, and i had no idea it was a stephen king story 
until the movie was over.  but what almost screwed us was the fact the 
movie is 3 hours long.  so we're all blown away by the movie, or at 
least i was, and you know how you want to take a few minutes to reflect 
on a good movie, go to the bathroom, maybe think about getting 
something to eat after?  nope!  can't do any of that, because we have 
to run, and i mean run, to catch the last train.  the cab ride back 
would have been like $30 or the other option is to wait at the bus 
terminal for the hourly bus.

i've found bart to generally not have enough service to fit my needs 
unless i time it just right and i think it's really a bummer that it 
doesn't run 24 hours.

hello, this is a continuation of a fictional piece:
 
the drive to new york was relatively short.  the supa family lives just two hours out. supa baby loves to walk fast through the crowds with agatha. for every angry step she takes, supa baby takes about 3 fast little steps. supa baby likes it that people know how to walk in new york. so does ag. :)

	Ha! That's one way to make your trains safer -- just use them less. 
Flippin' bureaucrats. If I could magically step into that situation 
right now and rewind the conversation, it might go something like 
this...

Me - How come you stop running the trains at 12:15 or so?
BART Employee -  We have the safest trains in the country because we 
shut them down every night in order to run a thorough check on the 
system.
Me - Oh, right, of course. Hey, do you ever drink coffee in the morning?
BART Employee - Sure.
Me - Then you should get it at our cafe so you don't risk burning 
yourself. We have the safest coffee in town because we never serve a 
cup without letting it cool to room temperature first. I'm sure you'll 
love it! Have a safe but mediocre day!

Groove on,

Well, it's true. They do track inspections and track maintenance
every night between about 1:30 and 4. I kinda wish they didn't
but they're not lying.

Yeah, but in other cities they run their subways and trains 24/7.  And 
you don't hear about people getting killed or injured on... say... New 
York's subways that often.  (As a result of the subway system itself, 
anyway.  Casualties due to the denizens of the NY submaw are another 
matter.)


cya,
john

Subject: [sfraves] .: Dirtbox Radio 5/2 :. Return to Beat Street!


Word up homie G's

We have a special presentation for you this weekend, brought to you by
Dirtbox Radio and Hypnotik Logik....

RETURN TO BEAT STREET.  read on...

Switchstance vs. Joe Kopasek...Yes, you heard me right.  For one night
only, the best breaks dj in dc and the best breaks dj in baltimore are
going head to head in a 2 hour royal rumble.  These two heavyweights are
going to battle it out to put an end to to the great dc vs. bmore debate.
Both of these breaks veterans come correct every single time out, and have
never left a fan dissapointed, in fact the only thing they leave people is
wanting more. and more. and more.  This is something that if you miss, you
will be shooting yourself in the head every day for the rest of your life.
Who knows if this is something that will ever happen again, so I think
that's your cue to listen in and hear 2 hours of slammin funky evil bangin
breakbeat madness.

Sinestro...What's a party without the living embodiment of the Commodore
64?  Chris is one of the most respected djs in the history of dc dance
music, and was been doing this before most of you knew what a rave was.
On this evening, The mighty sinestro has a treat for you all.  Sunday
night you will get the pleasure of hearing the funk.  And what do i mean
by the funk?  i mean the muthafuckin FUNK.  I'm talkin 90 minutes of
tribute to james brown style funky ass breaks.  How can anyone go wrong
with that? Be Prepared to take a trip back to a time when the breakbeat
was funky and the people danced.

Jesse Tittsworth...Anyone who has heard Jesse Tittsworth most definitely
knows the man's skills.  People who has heard his Krunk 001 mix know that
he can play the funky ghettoness better then almost anyone around here.
What would be a Dirtbox Radio without a little ghetto?  So for this night,
Senor Titts has graciously agreed to drop a set of Bmore Club/Breaks/Miami
Bass/Booty House/Etc to get the night started out propper.  Not many in
the DC/Bmore scene can touch this fool when he's behind the decks, and
you're about to find out why.  If you have not heard Krunk 001, get out
there and get yourself one, and be ready for some real ghetto shit!

So werd, it's something different, and something good.  Very good.
Timeslots and links follow...

07-08:30pm EST - Jesse Tittsworth
08:30-10pm EST - Sinestro
10-12am EST - Switchstance vs Joe Kopasek

Wow, I had an interesting night in the East Bay. I feel like a club kid =
and a future soccer star. (Watch out Beckham)

I did not feel like going too far from home, so I headed over to Hayward =
for some dancing.

The Turf Club, a popular gay bar, had some Hispanic house music being =
played by DJ Kelley, and I found my hip-shaking movement with this =
genre.=20

I have tried Hispanic music before, at the Bench n Bar in Oakland for =
Latin cowboy night, but it amazes me how much beat one can find in the =
"Latin explosion."

But after a few salsa songs, I was ready for something else, so I =
crossed the street to another bar on the "Hayward strip" (downtown =
area).

Little did I know that it was "Goth" night at Club Rumor, and I was =
suprised by how hard I could dance to the Industrial sound.  Also, I was =
astonished to see many gothic girls, getting down to the music, and I =
just joined right in with the hard-ass music (swaying my hips and =
kicking around). Where did I leave that dark lipstick? Osrick, where are =
you?

Man oh man, it was so much fun that I smiled, as usual. (Something you =
are not supposed to do to Industrial music).

But the crowd did not seem to mind, they could tell I was having fun, =
and I met the female DJ afterwards. She was taller than me! Imagine a 6 =
foot 2 female gothic DJ with tattoos! =20

On top of all of that fun, I met a Hispanic guy at the Goth party, and =
we had a long talk about football (that is, soccer). Now that is really =
crossing genres!

He told me the secret to having "power" in the game. It's all in the =
back of the leg, so I think dancers surely have an unknown edge in this =
sport. I am ready to learn more.  I see a bunch of guys in my =
neighborhood playing all of the time, and it looks like something I can =
do. Maybe I missed my calling, because I certainly have powerful legs.

Sincerely,
Greg VP

TUNE IN TO THIS PEOPLE!!! Some of the best local DC/Baltimore dj's around,
and friends of mine...

Big ups to Jackson & my best friend El Ian (aka Luigi) for getting these
kids together on the same radio show. Mad respect to Sinestro as a good
friend and inspiration, to Switchstance & Joe K for representing breaks to
the fullest, and to Jesse Tittsworth for being one of the baddest D&B
dj/producers who ain't afraid to bust out other styles as well.

Wish I coulda been back home for this show....

there is this really funny show on tv right now.  it's on NBC i think, =
Channel 3 on comcast in the south bay..... it's called 10.5 and its =
about a serious of earthquakes that hit california.=20

anyways, i say its funny because, first off, the acting is horrible, =
seriously, worst ever!  i cannot believe that any network would fathom =
airing this show.  secondly, i feel they are totally biting on 24 in =
many aspects (the name, the way they transition from scenes, and many =
other smalll details), they are only missing the ticking clock appearing =
every so often.....

it's some funny shit.  i just thought i would share.


ummm... game on.

Subject: RE: [sfraves] Weekend Review (a la Marc(O))....

I'm not sure I ever wrote anything about Thursday night - but it was fucking 
dope. Went to Shadow Lounge and got my fill of breaks for the week. All the 
dj's were pretty on point, and the crowd (as usual) was a happy lot. Can't 
go wrong when it comes to breaks. It was an interesting ride home with Osby 
& Frogger...

My Friday adventures were a bit more insane. Started off by checking out 
"Year Of The Monkey". Let me preface by saying, I'm not a trance fan by any 
atretch (at least not any trance past '99), so this already wasn't my scene. 
A friend from out of town wanted to check it out tho, so we went. There was 
a search at the front door, bad sign number 1, there was no booze but they 
ID'd people, mega-bad sign number 2, there were a ton of YOUNG ass females 
and older guys -and the obligatory cyber-raver looking kids - definitely not 
my crowd. The 1st DJ I got to hear was banging out some decent acid-techno - 
but he was quickly replaced by some kid who was spewing epic-y trance, 
complete with lofty arpeggiated synths galore. *VOMIT*

It was time to leave. So we rolled over to Butter for a few VERY nice 
cocktails (in glass glasses I might add!) and some tasty deep/funky house. A 
nice crowd, but nowhere to dance or sit really. So after a few cocktails we 
rolled back to my boys hotel to situate ourselves. After much research, we 
decided to head over to Club Six for the East Coast Boogiemen.

We got there pretty late, and whoever was on right before ECB was tearing up 
the decks. I had yet to get to an actual San Fran house party (yes, I know - 
sue me), and I was not disappointed in the slightest. Now I know where all 
the good dancers are!!! We missed last call by about 5 mintues which kind of 
sucked, but we still managed to have a decent time despite being dry. I ran 
into Apollo and Michael (is that right Apollo?) which was pretty nifty. My 
only disappointment of the night was that both of ECB weren't there. It was 
just Kenny rocking the decks. I was hoping to see Juan there as well since I 
know him a little bit better than Kenny, and haven't seen him in a long 
time. either way - Ken layed down some tasty as beats.

Club Six gets a big thumbs up - great house music, great dancers, sexy crowd 
(my LORD there were some beautiful women there), and decent layout. I wish I 
coulda reviewed the bars too - but there's always next time.

Anyway - that was my weekend.

Subject: [sfraves] nrr--- So I got another piercing :P

OK... so I haven't been like telling y'all about my piercing adevtures as of lately.. but yeah... in the past few months, I got another nose piercing & another brow pirercing & I Love it =)

So like my new piercing is just a normal lobe pierce, but instead of like just getting a stud thingie or a hoop, I got a horseshoe in there & a bead put in the middle so it looks like a hoop, but it isn't...

it looks pretty Dope actually & it matches the my other ear where i got an orbital in my lobe w/ (Thanks 2 the suggestion from Aryck) a horse shoe w/ a bead put in the middle!

I kinda felt like wierd @ 1st about putting a horseshoe ear thing a/ a bead in the middle of it on my right ear.. but it totally matches my left ear when i line up the 3 beads on both ears.. it looks pretty Awesome!!! hmmmm... I'll try 2 take pictures & show y'all..

OK.. I just thought I'd share... oh yeah.. so this unofficially makes 19 holes i got, but officially makes only 16 piercings if that makes any sense... LoL

Have a Groovy week y'all & hopefully i'll see some of U Groovers this week =) 

Take Care,
Peace-> O§bY {8O)

hello, this is a continuation of a fictional piece:
 
one of supa baby in toddler form's favorite things about spending time with aunt agatha is that supa baby KNOWS that something will be bought by agatha for supa baby....especially in new york....supa baby is looking around for just the thing to begin whining for....agatha loves it when supa baby whines....she would buy supa baby anything in the world anyway, but the whining is so cute and loud and attention getting. :)

Time is short.=20

The music won't last.=20

Do you run through each day=20

On the fly?=20

When you ask How are you?   =20

Do you hear the reply?=20

When the day is done=20

Do you lie in your bed=20

With the next hundred chores=20

Running through your head?=20

You'd better slow down=20

Don't dance so fast.=20

Time is short.=20

The music won't last.=20

Ever told your child,   =20

We'll do it tomorrow?=20

And in your haste,=20

Not seen his sorrow?=20

Ever lost touch,=20

Let a good friendship die   =20

Cause you never had time=20

To call and say,"hi"=20

You'd better slow down.=20

Don't dance so fast.=20

Time is short.   =20

The music won't last.=20

When you run so fast to get somewhere   =20

You miss half the fun of getting there.=20

When you worry and hurry through your day,=20

It is like an unopened gift....=20

Thrown away.=20

Life is not a race.=20

Do take it slower=20

Hear the music=20

Before the song is over.=20

parking lots and at gas stations its usually 2 or 3 guys they will ask you to smell 
the samples of the perfume DON'T its either and you will probably pass out.  
There have been several cases in the area so just spread the word and be safe.

You're a little late to the party-

This girl recently died :(
The official resport is that she choked on vomit-
But, they're not quite sure who's vomit it was-
Because well you know- you can't "dust" for vomit...

Subject: [sfraves] NRR:  The Full Moon of Wesak, this Wednesday.

--=====================_14293673==.ALT
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"; format=flowed

The Full Moon of Wesak, this Wednesday.

During this special time of the Full Moon of Wesak, it is as if a door is 
suddenly opened wide, which at other times is more closed. Through this 
door, it is possible to contact energies which are otherwise not easily 
available.  Great expansions of consciousness become possible which are not 
possible at other times.  People, such as yourself, who are on a spiritual 
path, can find great aid and spiritual stimulation at this time to take 
great steps forward.

It is said that Buddha descends from His high place during the full moon of 
Taurus*, the Wesak Festival of Light, to bestow spiritual blessings on the 
world.  He joins with the World Teacher of Love, and together they transmit 
two spiritual streams of energy - Divine Love and Divine Light.  Buddha's 
task in returning for this brief time of the Wesak Festival is to remind us 
of the possibility of illumination, keeping a channel open for light to 
illuminate the minds of humanity.

At this time of the Full Moon of Wesak, contact can be made with greater 
Lives, called the "Great Ones," Who are to the Masters what the Masters are 
to humanity.  Part of the purpose of Buddha's appearance is to embody the 
force which can stimulate people everywhere to come together as a group, 
with a focused intent, and thus reach symbolically "the ear and the heart" 
of the Great Ones.

http://www.orindaben.com/home/festlight.htm

There will be many outdoor celebrations in the Bay Area, including some 
Full Moon gatherings.

Love,

Apollo

"The welfare of the people in particular has always been the alibi of 
tyrants, and it provides the further advantage of giving the servants of 
tyranny a good conscience."
-Albert Camus

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the 
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become 
visible."
-Jacques Attali in his seminal text "Noise"

"I loved the focus in the early days of Wicked on the pagan aspects of 
life. The natural cycles of the full moons, being out in nature, on the 
beach, free, alive, unbridled, wild and spontaneous. There is no club, 
party or other sound system that has ever achieved anything close to that..."
-Jeno, on the early days of Wicked and the Full Moon Raves

Good seeing you there too, Marc O.  The guy I introduced you to was Joey, 
my partner.  Andrew Phelan was also at Club 6 that night as well as quite a 
few hard core househeads I know.  Yep, lots of moving funky house that 
night -- my ass is wed to the funk these days:)

6 is one of the very few clubs I'll attend these days.  Friendly security 
(just an ID check at the door) with a vibe that one used to find at many 
venues in town.  Get to know the bartenders and one need only buy a couple 
of drinks -- very stiff.  And, it's true, folks really dance at Club 
6.  Usually have breakers in the back.  It's all there:  sex, good music....

Last week I went to a soul clash party there.  I've also attended some 
great hip hop events, along with world music, techno and just about every 
other genre.  If I go there without knowing what's going down that night 
I'm never disappointed.

Next Saturday is "Atmosphere" at 6:  deep house, with Matty Heilbronn, 
Mauricio Aviles and Rasaki Aladokun performing live 
(percussionist).  Looking forward to it.

Love,

Apollo

Hi all in SFR land,=20

I wanted to share a personal perspective about the feelings that one has =
when competitive economic conditions (jobs and interviews) lead to =
negative feelings of self-doubt.=20

How do you overcome the obstacles in boom-to-bust cycles concerning =
career choices?=20

I moved here in 2000 for a dot-com job (like many people), and when =
things went bad and our technical writing department was Riffed (reduced =
in force), I found another job at a huge salary reduction (about 20%).=20

Then I got frustrated with management incompetence at my new job =
(although I lasted a year), and I resigned voluntarily.=20

I am having trouble finding another job and I think the economy is not =
recovering here so I am leaving.=20

I feel like I failed because I literally poured my heart and soul into =
the new job search. I wrote two technical white papers on my own time =
and submitted them as writing samples to prospective employers.=20

In many interviews, no one bothered to comment on something that I know =
was a valid example of my talent (and I am not trying to boast here).=20

Anyway, I hope that I can reinvent myself, move on as I planned to do, =
and write about other topics (other than the technology field).=20

The wheels are still in motion regarding traveling the nation, and I =
will write more about this later, like a junior John Steinbeck. Has =
anyone read "The Grapes of Wrath?" It still has relevance for modern =
American society.

Sincerely,=20

Greg VP

Subject: [sfraves] Trip down memory lane (HRAVEs circa 1999)

It is funny how when you are cleaning up your old email archives you can
start a trip down memory lane. At one time, I subscribed to HRAVES (Houston,
TX). Back in December 1999, I went to a benefit rave called 4 Tha Kidz, and
the benefactor was Toys for Tots.

Picture if you will a whole bunch of Kandy Kids bringing in toys for
charity. It was a blast. The Houston Firemen (our sponsors) loved it. On top
of that, the venue was an old warehouse near Downtown Houston, and that
Saturday night there was a post-election party happening in the same
location. Apparently, a candidate for Houston City Council was hosting her
own party, although she lost the run-off election to another candidate.

They were certainly gawking (AND pointing) at us ravers through large
Plexiglass windows above the dance floor! They acted as if they had never
seen anything so bizarre before! So, I decided to check out the neighbors
and join their celebration two floors above our mighty rave (wanted to show
them a few moves).

I fit right in (was not wearing my candy), and I actually really enjoyed
visiting their party, and after I introduced myself to the candidate, we
talked and danced. Everybody at this party was feeling their own disco vibe
to Sister Sledge (We are Family) and other delights, a great contrast to the
booming rave music nearby.

I guess that the spirit of dance movement can grip you no matter which scene
you are frequenting! I helped them clean up the place since I crashed the
party, ate their nachos, and drank their beer, and I sent a contribution for
the next election (although I was not a constituent).
That's my trip,
Greg VP

hello, this is a continuation of a fictional piece:
 
supa baby finally stopped screaming when the nice man started talking to agatha. supa baby thought it was always funny, these nice men being nice to agatha like they were all of the time, and agatha was never smiling back, but she was always polite. she told supa baby that being polite was the best way to ensure crossing the street safely and even recieving a hamburger as ordered. :)

sorry to break it to you.... but this is actually a HOAX..... doing a google
search for the doctors name "Dr. Dennis Shields, Professor" would have
resulted in NUMEROUS sites toting that this is a hoax....

always remember -- google is your friend....

http://www.truthorfiction.com/rumors/s/slowdance.htm
http://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/hoaxes/hoax5.asp?HName=%22Slow+Dance%22+Hoax
http://www.breakthechain.org/exclusives/slowdance.html


----------------------------------------------------------------------------
----------
Rule of thumb: Any e-mail message that starts out by telling you that it
isn't a chain letter most likely is! This one's been around in one form or
another since 1997, creating an interesting snapshot of the life of a hoax.
In its original form, it told the story of Jessica Mydeck, who supposedly
had a terrible form of brain cancer. Since the letter claimed she only has 6
months to live, her name was probably removed from future texts to keep it
from being identified as outdated (or as the hoax it is).






The poem was written by David L. Weatherford and published in 1991 by the
Russ Berrie Company. It was added to the chain letter in early 2001.
Wetherford is uncertain how the poem came to be associated with the dying
child hoax and does not endorse its inclusion. Heartwarming and
inspirational, it lowers our defenses and make us less skeptical of the rest
of the message. Other versions of this "dying kid" chain letter feature an
ASCII-Text "Elmo" or other feel-good messages instead of the poem.

Dr. Shields' involvement with this letter is a case of False Attribution
Syndrome. He has nothing to do with this hoax other than the fact that he
forwarded the message and automatically attached his "signature" to it. In a
2001 statement on their website, the Albert Einstein College of Medicine
denied Dr. Shields' involvement with the hoax and asked you to delete it and
help stop its spread.

The message implies that the American Cancer Society is tracking forwards of
the message, but the ACS denies any involvement with this or any other
e-mail scheme to provide help to a needy child. Besides, E-mail tracking as
it is described in the letter is technologically impossible.

Most of us would love to help the fight against cancer, especially if it
were as easy of forwarding an e-mail message. Bottom line, the fight for
cancer takes money. The American Cancer Society doesn't make donations, they
collect them - your donations and mine. Hoaxes like this one hurt
organizations like ACS because they force them to divert valuable time,
personnel, and resources to respond to the lies. Break this Chain!

This party was sick. Mad props to the modified krewe. ;)

Black nothingness of a room... crazed dancers against the backdrop of a
flaring light somewhere beneath the decks.. A bizarre approach through
warrens of tunnels and vast, empty rooms...

Isn't this how things are supposed to be? ;)


Also: Paging TK or Shonn. I was supposed to talk to one of you but left
early. ;)

Subject: [sfraves] NRR - max needs positive energy

Hey everybody,

I've been a long time lurker on SF Raves going way back to 1993 and I need
some positive energy sent my way. My cat Max has gastro-intestinal lymphoma
and is on the last of his nine lives. He started getting sick last November.
He was vomiting and loosing a lot of weight. He was down from 15lbs to 8lbs
in weight. His regular vet wasn't sure what was wrong with him and we tried
a whole bunch of things trying to rule out everything but cancer. Max was
eventually referred to a specialist veterinary clinic where they did an
ultrasound that showed a mass in his tummy and then did an endoscopy that
confirmed that he has lymphoma. He immediately started chemotherapy (which
can be pretty successful in cats) and was put into clinical remission after
three sessions. Before he could start his fourth chemo treatment his heart
started giving his trouble and his lungs were filling with fluid and he had
to go to the 24hr emergency clinic in the middle of the night on St
Patrick's day. The vets gave him medicine to help with his heart trouble and
decided that he probably only has another month to live with his heart
condition. Much to everyone's surprise, max really rebounded and did really
well, eating a lot and gaining 2lbs and seemed like he was back to his old
self (he even caught a mouse!). The vet was really surprised that he was
doing so well and put him back on a less aggressive chemo protocol while
they monitored his heart condition. Two weeks ago max started to vomit again
and loose his appetite. He went to the vet on Monday and got another dose of
a fairly powerful chemotherapy drug. He is still vomiting and not eating and
the vet said that if he doesn't show any signs of getting better by the
weekend I should probably consider having him euthanized so that he wont
suffer anymore.
I've had max since he was only eight weeks old. He has been a real source of
comfort to me over the past thirteen years and I can't imagine him not being
there anymore.
So if everybody could send max some positive energy to help him beat this we
would really be grateful


You can see Max at http://home.earthlink.net/~max_the_cat/cats.html

Subject: [sfraves] OK... Hello 2DAy... So damn trippy... MegaTron, DJM, BAM...

OK.. so my day was spent like well.. doin' homework, although, i did procrastinate a lil here & there 'cause i pretended i was a model walking on the catwalk in my house or like i was pretending I was on stage singing w/ *NSYNC! LoL... OK.. yeah.. unfortunately i didn't go 2 school early 2 take some tests like i was planning on & i ended havin' this mondo caffine fixation & ordered a pizza just so they could send me a 2 Litter Coke w/ it.. LoL

Anywaze, got 2 school evening time, took a test, had a mondo bitching session w/ some calssmates about how the teachers teaching methods fuckn' suck.. la la la... didn't feel like staying 4 the rest of class since all we were gonna do was like review 4 the final next week, so i left early 'cause i was feeling kinda uuugghhh 'cause i so hate math!

walked around the City & well.. for a while, i went 2 those intercom dial boxes on like those apt building & called a few residents on those intercom thingie & waited 4 the VM 2 kick in left messages...

So after that, walked around the city more pretending i was a model on the catwalk again when i was walkin' up 3rd 'cause I was listening 2 m y walkman & stuff... them somehow i like totally ended up hangin' out w/ BAM & DJM.. LoL. .it was fun!!  Ya know, I've noticed in the past few weeks i been hangin' out w/ Bam.. there's been sooo much 2 talk about w/ him!!  Oh yeah... he's also a good listener if u ever have a need 2 talk about like anything... it was also Dope
kicki' it w/ DJM 'cause LoL... well... he always has like these mondo random things he says that are just heeeeeeeella funny! I Love it!  Oh yeah... I was entrusted TOOP SECRET info when i was w/ them.. so shhhhh... GROOVE IS IN THE HEART YE YE YE YEAAAAH!

After hangin out like 4 almost 2 hours, I caught bart & started like flirting w/ this art student girl who i met on bart & commenting on her purse... OK.. Hello 2Day.. after the next stop like took off, I sawt his familiar dude like walkin up the isle w/ a bag of records.. Oh Shit!!!

"MEGA" I yelled outta like frustration 'cause i almost 4got what his name was as the train started moving and making sounds.  No response!


"YO MEGATRON!!!" I yelled even louder!  He turned around w/ this surprising look on his face.  I like totally ran up, accidentally threw my backpack on someone's
lap & I hugged Mr Mega!! LoL

It was Dope.. we rode the whole way 2 El Cerrito Del Norte stop & mondo caught up on like eeeeeeeeverything!!!  It was Sooooooo So Dope shillin' w/ Mega again after heeeeeeeella long man.. LoL... oh yeah... he also entrusted me w/ some like TOP SECRET INFO.. shhhhhhhhh... =)

So I dunno... my night was kinda like totally unexpected, mondo surprising, & damn.. so fun!  LoL.. Hello 2day... Wow.. I'm buggin'!!

OK.. again.. just thought i'd share, but yeah, so a Jungle DJ is like alwasy in the City somewhere 2 hang out w/ & Breakbeats DJ is always a Groovy person 2 talk 2 is the morale of this story I guess =)  Well.. also.. there's gonna be alot Groovy stuff goin on this Summer from the way things are lookin'... =)


Take Care,
Peace-> O§bY {8O)

Subject: [sfraves]  NRR - max needs positive energy

 

 
 Hey Aaron,

It wasn't my intention to solicit donations but thanks for the addition to
his fund. I'm already over $4000 in the hole with vet expenses and I also
just lost my job so your donation is greatly appreciated.

Thanks for all the positive thoughts and energy
 
 Sean and Max

Subject: [sfraves]  NRR - Wanna live in the Haight?

If interested, reply to me directly.

Thanks,
Tim

Due to a roommate leaving for another country in June,
we have an extra room that will be available for rent
come in the middle of June. It's the biggest room in
the flat and it's on the top floor. You will be
sharing the place with three students all in their mid
to later twenties who are all in school for teaching
related stuff and two cats that run up and down the
halls. We are fairly quiet and respectful to others
and it's on Ashbury Street, right in between Haight
and Waller. We have our own washer and dryer in the
utility closet(no more quarters to do your laundry
down the street), DirectTV, a small but cool living
room, DSL and yeah, I'm sure there are other cool
things about the house, but I can't think of them
right now.....sorry. The room will be open on June 15
and we want this filled ASAP. If interested, send us
an email and we will get back in touch.

Subject: RE: [sfraves] BSP attempt 2: [modified] free party - tonite!

the kind reviews are much appreciated! - i had a great time as well and
would definitely say that party ranks in the top 5 of parties ive ever had
the chance to throw :)  i havent seen a crowd bounce that hard for that long
in quite awhile.  parties like that remind me why i ever got into the whole
promoting mess to begin.

modified has been quietly throwing these types of events for sometime now,
and while the sudden hype is exciting im begging everyone to "keep it real"
and help us to continue to be able to make things like saturday nite happen.

many thanks to kent, shonn, tala and mike for all your relentless help. good
parties dont happen without help from friends like you guys!

watch out a series of free *sunrise* events at virgin locations coming this
summer!  ive also got all sorts of other plans/ideas for other shows in the
works so keep your eyes open.

hello, this is a continuation of a fictional piece:
 
supa baby started having some supa deep thoughts...supa baby started contemplating the paranoia of the grody. it was all pretty grody, fer sure, and supa baby could see that, but the drunkard in denial couldn't and drank more, so wouldn't. then supa baby came back to the material world again and began stratagizing for toys. :)

Oh, I want to join in!

What ever happened to Poly*E*Wog?

When I think of my early days on SFR (beginning of '99) he always stands out 
in my mind, along with Patrice (Teknodiva), Tina (Moonchyld1), Heather 
(Teknomania), Leslie, Terry, Becca (Amazondyve), Navy Satan, Nexa, THE BEAST, Vlad 
and of course, Geri Dahl.

I know where the rest of those people are, but Paul...?

What a coinkydink...I ran into Poly*E*Wog (sans candy-gear) at Fry's
Electronics a few weeks ago. He's doing well, just finished college I
believe, living back in the south bay.

Subject: [sfraves] Qoute Of The Day

OK... so a few months ago... while Deepfog & GTI Fog were visiting me, Deep asked me if i wanted 2 take over the QOTD posts since he was gonna stop doing it on SFR after how many years, ya know.... & @ the time i said, "Well, I'll probably wait a while 'til i get really inspired to do make a really Dope QOTD post" la la la la... I mean... Deep already gave me the keys & codes 2 years ago & stuff, so like I dunno... this was alota pressure @ the time...

So anywaze... I figure now is the time I guess & I hope 2 do a good job or whatever doin' this & in the fashion that Deep has done it, & I ain't even sure about doin' it daily... but 2 start things off, I figure i gotta be @least kinda mushy w/ my ever very 1st QOTD...

---------------------------------->

So I was watching Laverne & Shirley during a study break earlier 2day... there were these gang girlies in this episode & Shirley made this speech 2 them in hopes that they would learn the rights & wrongs of t=what they do la la la...

after the speech, these 2 girls went back 2 thier apt telling them they left the gang...

Gangster Girlie1 said, "I don't have any friends anymore," as she looked @ Gangster Girlie2.

Laverne said, "Well, you still got her, and 1 friend is all you need! Right Shirl?" 

Then they all smiled & laughed @ each other & show ended!

---------------------------------->

OK.. how was that?  Did i do a good job Deep?  Oh hey... I'm sorry i didn't call u back the other night, but like U remember how confussed I was about things that evening & well.. when i was gonna call u back.. i figured it was like kinda late in our timezone already...  {{{HUGZ}}}

OK... la la la




Take Care,
Peace-> O§bY {8O)

Farms in Berkeley?!? No something much better. While it is a bit =
premature, I will be out of town this weekend at:
http://www.avbc.com/news/boontbeerfest.html ... and wanted to let you =
all know of something absolutely amazing that has found its way into my =
neck of the woods. I'll try and keep it short and sweet.

It appears my sets on ThumpRadio went well and was warmly received. I =
was contacted earlier in the week and provided the opportunity to begin =
my own radio show, through ThumpRadio, on San Francisco's own KUSF 90.3 =
FM.=20

Every 2nd Sunday, from 8 - Midnight, you can catch the best progressive =
music in the scene, locally and from around the world. In addition to =
myself getting to expose you all to some bangin' Proggy beats, I will be =
featuring a local guest DJ, or maybe not local ;), for a special =
appearance. This Sunday, if I can manage to get a hold of him, I will be =
featuring Jason Lee. In addition to being a progression resident, Jason =
has been laying down slab's of vinyl since I got out of diapers. =
Seriously this guy has been playing longer than most politicians =
careers. He sets are technically amazing, and always featuring the =
newest, coolest choons that have managed to make there way into his =
crates, before I even knew it was released.=20

So, with there being no time like the present, catch me this Sunday on =
90.3 FM, starting at 8 pm. If you, or someone you know outside of the =
area wants to tune in, you can stream it here:
http://kusf.org/index.shtml

Wish me luck!

God - that's that horrible American Idol singer chick from last year. She is

Subject: [sfraves] Rhythm Science

--=====================_599875==.ALT
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"; format=flowed

DJ Spooky's first book.  Looks interesting:

Rhythm Science
Paul D. Miller
a.k.a. Dj Spooky that Subliminal Kid

"Miller's insights as a practicing and successful DJ are fresh and 
unpretentious." -Publishers Weekly
In his first book, conceptual artist Paul D. Miller, also known as Dj 
Spooky that Subliminal Kid, delivers a manifesto for rhythm science-the 
creation of art from the flow of patterns in sound and culture, "the 
changing same."  His template is the DJ's mix, spun from the ideas, images, 
and sounds that bombard daily us and refashioned into something new, 
expressive, and endlessly variable. Technology provides the method as well 
as the medium, bridging the artist's consciousness and the outside world.

Miller constructed his Dj Spooky persona ("spooky" from the eerie sounds of 
hip-hop, techno, ambient, and the other music that he plays) as a 
conceptual art project, but then came to see it as an opportunity for 
broader experiments.  For example: "Start with the inspiration of George 
Herriman's Krazy Kat comic strip. Make a track invoking his absurd 
landscapes. . .What do tons and tons of air pressure moving in the 
atmosphere sound like?  Make music that acts a metaphor for that kind of 
immersion or density." Or, for an online "remix" of two works by Marcel 
Duchamp: "I took a lot of his material written on music and flipped it into 
a DJ mix of his visual material-with him rhyming!"

Tracing the genealogy of rhythm science, Miller cites sources and 
influences as varied as Ralph Waldo Emerson ("all minds quote"), 
Grandmaster Flash, W. E. B. Dubois, James Joyce, and Eminem.  "The story 
unfolds while the fragments coalesce," he writes.  A heady mix of 
autobiography and theory, Rhythm Science melds words, images, and sounds 
(on an included audio CD) to demonstrate how conceptual art, popular 
culture, and idealism can activate one another in this era of multiplex 
consciousness.
In a review that places Miller in the company of writer/musicians Glenn 
Gould and John Fahey, Publishers Weekly says that Rhythm Science gives DJ 
culture "the broad contextualization its innovations have long
warranted."

Rhythm Science has been designed for maximum visual and tactile seduction 
by the international studio COMA (Cornelia Blatter and Marcel 
Hermans).  The design embodies Miller's method of layering and 
juxtaposition with texts and images that bleed through from page to 
page.  From its velvet flesh cover to the die-cut hole through the center 
of the book, which reveals a colored nub that holds the CD, Rhythm Science 
is an irresistible package, notable for its sensual qualities as well as 
for its intellectual ones.
Paul D. Miller, a.k.a. Dj Spooky that Subliminal Kid, is a conceptual 
artist, writer, and musician living in New York City. His artwork has 
appeared in the Whitney Biennial, the Venice Biennale for Architecture, the 
Andy Warhol Museum, and many other venues. His written work has appeared in 
such publications as the Village Voice and Artforum.  He is an editor of 
the magazine 21c (www.21cmagazine.com).  Renowned for CDs such as Riddim 
Warfare and Optometry, Miller will premiere his multimedia spectacle, Dj 
Spooky's Rebirth of a Nation, this summer at the 2004 Lincoln Center 
Festival, the Spoleto Festival, the Vienna Festival, and the Festival 
d'Automne in Paris.

"We've ended the century of broadcast culture-when manufacturers produced 
the culture we consume.  In this brilliant and beautiful book, Paul Miller 
gives us the rhythm of sampled culture-culture created by those who can 
remix, and by technologies that enable anyone to remix.  Rhythm Science is 
science; it is art; it is the story of how freedom would build better 
science and art.  Dark, with bright flashes, in tempo, with syncopation, it 
is a companion to the next stage, if we're allowed that next stage despite 
law that would keep us locked in the past."
-Lawrence Lessig, Stanford Law School, author of The Future of Ideas: The 
Fate of the Commons in a Connected World

"Once again, Paul Miller has pushed the sonic arts and sciences to a new 
level, and in the process re-
mastered literary form.  I guarantee, this book will mess with your head, 
but in a funky way."
-Robin D. G. Kelley, author of Freedom Dreams: The Black Radical Imagination

"Security is mostly a superstition. It does not exist in nature, nor do the 
children of humans as a whole experience it. Avoiding danger is no safer in 
the long run than outright exposure. Life is either a daring adventure or 
nothing."
-Helen Keller

"Lives based on having are less free than lives based on either doing or on 
being."
-William James

"It's taken me all my life to learn what not to play."

Subject: RE: [sfraves] SOMA Sessions - Old Skool Jungle - Fri May 28

I'm guessing as a whole the night will be more on the
old skool jump-up, Metalheadz and techstep vibes than
93/94 darkside but I'll see what I can do =]  I'll be
playing at least some Remarc/Bizzy B style stuff from
that era so maybe I can borrow that tune or track down
an mp3...  Dave

yes, it pains me to announce this at such a late time, but tonight's Xhale 
at the Shadow Lounge is KO'd with a quickness.

due to powers beyond my control (for reasons i am still unclear on) this 
will NOT be going down tonight.  *weeping weeping*

but now you can all stay at home and watch the final episode of Friends!

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Vocal dance: New artist

That's funny, I do not watch American Idol so I had no idea. I was just a
regular consumer, checking out the dance section, and this ditty caught my
ear (I like vocals).

I would not be surprised if she had help, either, but nevertheless it is
listenable (at least this song is).

Also, I like pop songs (the cheesey stuff) because it makes you feel
temporarily happy in a miserable world. As long as I can dance to it, it's
fine with me.

God - that's that horrible American Idol singer chick from last year. She is
AWFUL. They musta seriously worked over her voice in the studio in order to
make her sound listenable.

Subject: [sfraves] BSP:  Bam's mix is back online

ok, so when i moved my site to a different server a few months ago, i took 
down my breakbeat mix that i'd had online.  this is the same mix that i've 
been passing out on CD for the past half year (or more?  god i need a new 
mix)

anyhow, since several people had mentioned that the link was broken and/or 
were complaining that i was being an ass and hadn't given them a CD...the 
mix is back online!

here it is:
http://www.invibe.com/downloads/dj_bam_demo_mix_0503.mp3

it goes from a little funky to nu skoolish to progressive all mixed up 
together.  download it, give it a listen if you haven't already.  enjoy!

Subject: Re: [sfraves] BSP attempt 2: [modified] free party - tonite!

    All I got was a brief email about this party. I had no idea who 
Modified were, nor any of the DJs. It sounded like an outdoor renegade 
which I always have a good time at. Most of my friends turned their 
noses up because they didn't know the promoters, the DJs or anyone else 
going, but 2 of my friends, Chris and Charlie were down to go with me. 
Even though what I saw said the party would start at 11, I knew in my 
raver heart of hearts that that meant later, and that the voicemail 
would not be up with directions when promised. Raver Time is about as 
slow as Colored People Time usually, so I didn't sweat it. When we heard 
the directions, we thought wow, it's near Homebase, but even as we drove 
up to the designated intersection, we still thought it had to be across 
the street or something. When we were told where to go, my heart started 
beating faster in anticipation. See, I had never been to Homebase. That 
is a name that is said with nothing short of reverence when the 
old-skoolers talk about "the way it used to be before it started to suck 
like it does now." We enter the warehouse, which is pitch black and 
people around us are using the displays from their cell phones to 
illuminate their path. We get to the other side of this huge, empty 
space, and the only thing I could hear was the drone of  a generator. We 
climb through a hole in the wall, walk up this hallway towards the 
generator, open a door, and BAM-O!!! Music and writhing bodies. Nothing 
else. Nary a blacklight to be seen. No light at all except for what is 
coming from the dj setup. Just hard, banging music and a packed, packed 
dance floor. Perhaps it was the vibe from yester-year which permeates 
those walls. Perhaps it was the audacity with which someone dared to 
risk revisiting a site that was shut down so long ago. All I know is 
that this is a party that I will remember for a long time. Oh, yeah, 
fyi, I was the guy spinning fire. :-)

Subject: [sfraves] BSP:  Odeed @ Mash-Up / Friday, May 21st

Just a couple weeks away from Evil Breaks second party, Mash-Up.  We're 
especially excited to be bringing up DJ and producer, Odeed.  In addition to 
being a solid breakbeat DJ, hip hop DJ, and producer (with tracks on 
Moonshine Music) he's also a pretty bad ass turntablist!

For some samples of what this guy can do, check out his site here:

http://zebox.com/odeed/music

"coldcuttinfinished" is a short clip showcasing his cuttin' and scratchin' 
skills.  check out a few of his other mixes while you're at it.

--------
Evil Breaks presents....

MASH-UP
Friday, May 21st

Featuring:
Odeed - (Moonshine/LABA/W.E.)

Odeed is simply one of the sickest producers and dj's/turntablists around. 
He has had multiple releases on Moonshine Green with fellow producer Bionic, 
and his style of breaks easily distinguish him from other producers. He's 
had many affiliations including Moonshine, C.T.W., Downtown Dwellars, 2 
Covert Capin's, and of course L.A.B.A. One of his most recent performances 
in the Bay (May, 2003) was at 1015 where he opened up for Uberzone, and we 
are proud to bring him back again for a performance not to be missed.

vs

DJ Wish (W.E. - Baltimore, MD)

Originally hailing from Balmtimore, MD dj Wish has made a name for herself 
with her unique style of breaks. She has had many residencies to include, 
The Edge (DC), Tracks (DC), and The Spot (Baltimore). She has also worked 
closely with Shaken Not Stirred Records, Deep Rising Productions, F(x) 
productions, and she has performed at the world famous Buzz (Nation) in 
Washington DC. Odeed and Wish are currently working on a few tracks 
together, and this event is going to be part of their nation wide tour to 
promote their new label W.E. Recordings. I've been told we might get to hear 
some unreleased tracks that are sure to tear up the dance floor.

Also Performing:


A:Dubl (Breakthru)
Majere (Elektrosorcery) - Special Breaks Set
Aaron Jae vs. Athena (AaronJae.com/Seekr vs. Gravity Crew)
DJ Bam vs. Nick Nyquil (Invibe vs Oneiromancy/Ill Behavior)
M.O.D. (Evil Breaks)


We are having a second room that is going to be hosted by the Ambient Mafia. 
Downtempo beats for you to chill out to. The Ambient Mafia has done chill 
rooms for Moksha Tribe and the upstairs at 550 barnaveld and countless other 
parties that you've probably been to.

Ambient Room:

MC Boomerang
Fidget
Stickyboy
Harken
DJ fieldsoe
Skye
Hallucid

This event will be a small 250 capacity two room and we'll be bangin out the 
Breaks from 9pm till 4 am

Presales: $7
Door: $10

Tickets will be available at Skills, F-8, and Solid Grooves shortly and 
online at:
www.Groovetickets.com

Newsbrief: DEA Agent Demonstrates Gun Safety to School Kids -- By Shooting 
Himself

  5/7/04

Now, here's a lesson on gun safety that will not quickly be forgotten. 
According to Orlando, Florida, television station WKMG, an Orlando-based 
DEA agent shot himself in the leg during a gun safety presentation to local 
kids. The agent, whom superiors mercifully refused to name, was treated at 
the Orlando Hospital Center after the April 9 incident and is now back on 
the job.

According to police reports, the agent drew his .40-caliber pistol and 
removed the magazine, then pulled back the slide and asked someone from the 
audience to look inside the gun and confirm it wasn't loaded. The pistol 
was pointed at the floor, and when he released the slide, one bullet fired 
into the top of his left thigh.

The DEA agent's presentation was at an event sponsored by the Orlando 
Minority Youth Golf Association 
(<http://www.omyga.org>http://www.omyga.org). There was no explanation as 
to the link between teen golf and gun safety.

But the agent's presentation had an impact, according to witnesses. "The 
kids screamed and started to cry," said Vivian Farmer, who attended the 
presentation with her 13-year-old nephew. "Everyone was pretty shaken up," 
Farmer told WKMG. "But the point of gun safety hit home. Unfortunately, the 
agent had to get shot. But after seeing that, my nephew doesn't want to 
have anything to do with guns."

tyrants, and it provides the further advantage of giving the servants of 
tyranny a good conscience."
-Albert Camus

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the 
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become

-Jacques Attali in his seminal text "Noise"

"I loved the focus in the early days of Wicked on the pagan aspects of

beach, free, alive, unbridled, wild and spontaneous. There is no club, 
party or other sound system that has ever achieved anything close to that..."

Subject: [sfraves] So like lastnight... Jet Trash, Urban Montage, & Fire Dancing!

OK.. so yesterday was pretty eventful in terms of what I did i guess 'cause like well...  right when I got off BART @ Embarcaderro.. i saw my cousins, Ate Elvie & Kuya Hitch (Ate (pronounced ah-teh) is who U call an older female who's like your cousin or sister before her name in tagalog & Kuya (koo-yah) is like same thing but 4 older male, often times you'll hear me say like Kuya Terry when I C him)& my Ate Elvie gave me money... LoL so that was Groovy...

Then on  Muni, I started talkin' 2 some Punk rocker dude who just moved up here from LA 6 weeks ago & was taking random trips around the Bay area public transpotation... so that was fun!

I went 2 school 2 finish taking tests (well.. i took 1 of 2 I still gotta take), saw some old clasmates from my old classes @ UOP, went & had rice w/ Bam, then went 2 Jet Trash!!  

Jet Trash was fun actually... the DJs were spinning this Awesome like Funky Happy House kinda stuff & there was this 1 song w/ like these mondo happy Chants that Todd played, it was Dope!!  I ate the yummy crab stuffed mushrooms there & it was fun 'cause i met some dude of the GS board who I've known 4 like the past 4 years by post but never met... LoL.. Lester

Anywaze. he gave me some free passes 2 check out Urban Montage 'cause he was spinning there (House) & well... I waited a while 4 Bad Kitty 2 begin & like Serephim.. but well... it was still a while where she didn't show up & well.. I went down the alley way 2 Urban Montage

Urban Montage was fun i guess.. i mean... I Loved the Deep Funky HOuse that Lester was spinning & i met some Groovy people there... Oh MY Goodness.. I saw my friend Arkayda from Russia there & we totally caught up & talked 4 a while!!!

Then I went over 2 IK 'cause i talk 2 ACME BRD & he told me he was gonna spin there.. & 4got that they had fire dancing there.. so that was Groovy... he spun this Groovy set which had his signiture TRance, B Sides, & Breakbeats tracks... it was fun!!!  I think I actuallu heard some new records in that set 'cause i know he ain't been shopping 4 vinyl in a few years... LoL

Well.. that was pretty much my night... I wish Jungle went on @ Urban Montage 'cvause I was reeeeeeeeeeally lookin' foward on seen' Ivry!!  Oh well....

So yeah.. toko bart home & well... there's a few stories there, but i gotta get my hair cut & color now.. I'm changing the blue 2 something else & I'm not sure what color yet so i hope 2 C some of y'all soon 2 share!!! =) Damn... I 4got how fun it is 2 have color hair again

Have a Groovy weekend y'all =)

I get the Pay pal scam emails even on my addresses not listed on Ebay or
Pay Pal. I think that just about everyone gets these.

Subject: [sfraves] nrr. . paypal scams, questions

hey all

I recently recieved a couple fraud emails from someone posing as paypal
saying my account was limited unless I clicked the link to update my
info, of course I didn't. I reported it and it wasn't from paypal.

my question is, 
how do they get the registered email addresses I use for my paypal
account ? It it possible thru ebay ? Or how could they get into the
paypal system to get people's email addresses, but not get any other of
my info ?

thanks all

take care

Subject: [sfraves] Studio for sale!!

Hey Guys,

Well due to some circumstances im a bit forced to sell my studio  :(

I would love to unload the full studio to a person but may be willing to 
"part" it out.

Here is a list of my studio along with the price at the bottom which I might 
add is fair market value.

1. Mac G4 500mhz with 512 MB ram DVD drive With OSX and Legit copy of 
Panther
1. MAC 17' FLAT planel Studio Display
1. Digi 001 Soundcard (This comes with the MAC obviously
1. Digi 001 "Break out box"
1. Access Virus A Virtual Analog Synth (Table top model)
1. Roland Alpha Juno 2
1. Lacie 52x CD/RW Drive (Firewire External)
1. Behiringer 12channel Analog Mixer 1540 or 1640A forgot the model number
1. midi man 2x2 Midi bus
1. Midi Control with 12 assignable rotary knobs 62 key
1. Keyboard stand that supports the Midi control as well as the Virus


I think that is it for the hardware stuff there may be a few more odds and 
ends..


Software list.

Pro tools 6.x (Legal Copy)
Peak Le (Legal copy) forgot the number I think 5.x
Reason 2.0 (legit copy unregistered)
Logic 4.7
Sound Forge 5

I have a shit load more software loaded on the machine but feel it would 
just take up to much god damn space for reading.. So lets just leave it at 
it is loaded decently..

I want to unload the whole thing for $3k  If interested please drop me a 
line. All the studio gear is in good shape was in a smoke free studio. Some 
of the gear has a few scuffs but it is all in good shape and works well.  I 
hope to post pictures soon. but may not get the time since the gear is in 
storage at this time.

Thanks,

Macadio

Here is the original, pre-Hallmark, Mother's Day Proclamation, penned in 
Boston by Julia Ward Howe in 1870:

Arise, then, women of this day!
Arise all women who have hearts,
Whether your baptism be that of water or of tears
Say firmly:
"We will not have great questions decided by irrelevant agencies,
Our husbands shall not come to us reeking of carnage,
For caresses and applause.
Our sons shall not be taken from us to unlearn
All that we have been able to teach them of charity, mercy and patience.
We women of one country
Will be too tender of those of another country
To allow our sons to be trained to injure theirs.
 From the bosom of the devastated earth a voice goes up with
Our own. It says, "Disarm, Disarm!"
The sword of murder is not the balance of justice!
Blood does not wipe out dishonor
Nor violence indicate possession.
As men have often forsaken the plow and the anvil at the summons of war.
Let women now leave all that may be left of home
For a great and earnest day of counsel.
Let them meet first, as women, to bewail and commemorate the dead.
Let them then solemnly take counsel with each other as to the means
Whereby the great human family can live in peace,
Each bearing after his own time the sacred impress, not of Caesar,
But of God.
In the name of womanhood and humanity, I earnestly ask
That a general congress of women without limit of nationality
May be appointed and held at some place deemed most convenient
And at the earliest period consistent with its objects
To promote the alliance of the different nationalities,
The amicable settlement of international questions.
The great and general interests of peace.

tyrants, and it provides the further advantage of giving the servants of

visible."
-Jacques Attali in his seminal text "Noise"

"I loved the focus in the early days of Wicked on the pagan aspects of 
life. The natural cycles of the full moons, being out in nature, on the 
beach, free, alive, unbridled, wild and spontaneous. There is no club, 
party or other sound system that has ever achieved anything close to that..."

Friday, May 7, 2004 ** Melon : Josh Wink **

Red Melon is proud to finally be able to showcase one of the biggest succes=
s stories in the underground house movement. Ask yourself how many globally=
 respected, underground artist-producer-DJs have turned-down offers to tour=
 with U2, and you will likely draw a short list. Josh Wink is such an artis=
t -- one who is unassuming, yet enjoys a cult following and who places arti=
stic integrity above all else. Owner of Ovum Recordings and remixer of mega=
-talents such as Sting, Depeche Mode and Ladytron, Josh has made only rare =
appearences in San Francisco, so don't miss out.

Supporting Josh will be Dano, Dj and tech house producer from San Francisco=
=2E  After a long winter touring Australia, New Zealand, and Eastern Europe=
, Dano is back in town working in the studio for a few months.  Dano has th=
ree new releases coming out simultaneously on Silicone Soul's Darkroom Dubs=
 imprint, Honchos Music, and Red Melon.  He will be spinning fresh techy gr=
ooves along with red melon biz partner JZ.  No stranger to the Melon experi=
ence, JZ is responsible for some of the most memorable sets in the seven ye=
ars of parties Red Melon has produced.  It will be just like old times!

If you are serious about your Red Melon parties, this Melon is not to be mi=
ssed! Get there before 11:00pm to take advantage of an earlybird cover char=
ge of $10 at San Francisco's newest venue, Mighty, located at 119 Utah St a=
t 15th Street. Mighty is a beautiful renovated warehouse with a touch of te=
chnology and art and the massive sound system that made Club Townsend a San=
 Francisco favorite. All of that plus cheap drinks too! You can't go wrong.=

Saturday, May 8, 2004 ** Taurus presented byElektrosorcery **

 Taurus  by Elektrosorcery - The Taurean's characteristics are solidity, pr=
acticality, extreme determination and strength of will - no one will ever d=
rive them, but they will willingly and loyally follow a leader they trust. =
They are stable, balanced, conservative good, law-abiding citizens and love=
rs of peace, possessing all the best qualities of the bourgeoisie. As they =
have a sense of material values and physical possessions, respect for prope=
rty and a horror of falling into debt, they will do everything in their pow=
er to maintain the security of the status quo and be somewhat hostile to ch=
ange. Mentally, they are keen-witted and practical more often than intellec=
tual, but apt to become fixed in their opinions through their preference fo=
r following accepted and reliable patterns of experience. Their character i=
s generally dependable, steadfast, prudent, just, firm and unshaken in the =
face of difficulties. Their vices arise from their virtues, going to extrem=
es on occasion,such as sometimes being too slavish to the conventions they =
admire.  With Taurus DJs: James Dub, Valerie Sparks, Elz, Nomad, Cauze, Cyr=

hello, this is a continuation of a fictional piece:
 
ig doesn't celebrate mother's day. ig drinks pepsi NOT coke. ig isn't having trust issues. ig likes popsicle juice, but doesn't like the cold. here is ig's special popsicle juice recipe:
 
1 box popsicles...any flavor...ig likes blue
1 cup boiling water
 
place one cup boiling water into a large bowl. unwrap all popsicles and place into water. stir vigorously..add more boiling water if needed, but not too much, because you don't want to dilute the sweetness. serve..makes two large servings. :)

hey all

so like recently, some lil hoochie wild kittie was pregnant, and hangs =
around my home cuz we have food on the porch for em. . .somehow she =
ended up in my garage, and I noticed she was thinner. . .I looked thru =
the garage, and found 4 newborn kittens sleeping on my car fabric in a =
lil storage closet thing.

so I couldn't catch the mom, she's nuts. . .and since she had the =
kittens in my garage, it wasn't likely she was going to be able to feed =
them normally. I took them out from where they were, and put them in a =
nice cushie lil box. . .I went to take a shower, came back, and one was =
gone. . .=20
I couldn't find the other kitten for a couple days, till one day some =
neighbors came by saying their kids picked up this kitten in the yard =
and brought it home. . . so they were all back together again. The =
problem was, me n my relative had to feed the guys. . .we did, and have =
been for a couple weeks with lil syringes and kitten milk replacement. . =
.

they're some smart lil kitties. . .they're now like 4 weeks old, eat out =
of bowls, eat some hard food, use the cat litter. . .and it all seemed =
to just be instinct. . .=20

they're the cutest things. 2 boys, 2 girls. . .the boys- one all white =
except for lil grey ears and feets, the other is a tiger striped =
orange/white guy. . . the girls are both calico, one more brightly =
colored, and one thats really dark, almost black, but with lil bits of =
white n orange. . .=20

I have 3 other dogs here and 3 cats. . .the dogs are 2 pitts, and one =
shar-pei. . it's cute how the pitts take care and protect the kittens. . =
.since they've met, the kittens crawl all over the dogs, and one of the =
funniest things i've seen was the orange boy chasing after our 95lb =
pitt, trying to swat its nose. . .the pitt would jump around and play, =
but not touch the kittens. . .=20
Earlier, my girlie kittie tabitha was hissing at the kittens, and the =
smaller pitt came running down the hall and pushed her away from the =
kitten. My bro puppet (the shar-pei) doesn't even pay attention to them =
unless they attack his leg, then he just jumps and runs off. . .=20

today I thought it was sweet, when my kittie brian was licking the =
kittens and playing with them. . . before he used to hiss and run from =
em, but now he likes them. . .I thought it was odd cuz brians a guy, and =
aren't they supposed to kill kittens ?

I'll take pics and post the info another time. . .but in a few more =
weeks (they're much too lil now) they'll be up for adoption.=20

The boys are really independant, super playful kitties, the girls are =
lappie kinda sweet lil kittens that seem to crave people to be near them =
and lie on. . .=20

they're all gorgeous, really intelligent. . .in a bit they're going to =
get their shots n stuff. . .=20

hehe I love kitties. . .=20

: )

have a good weekend

aK

A whole new dot-com bust



Designer drug clearinghouse linked to ex-CEO.




By J.K. Dineen | Staff Writer Examiner
Published on Tuesday, May 4, 2004

In a cautionary tale of a dot-com gone astray, police have busted a failed 
start-up CEO who had turned his spacious Mission District live/work loft 
into a haven for drug dealing and weekly raves, according to police.

John Petrik, 32, was arrested Thursday night at his 865 Florida St. loft, 
where police allegedly found 1,000 hits of Ecstasy, along with cocaine, 
pot, speed and a gourmet menu of designer drugs with names like Roxy and 
liquid X. Cops say Petrik held raves every Friday night in the pink loft 
building, charging admission and insisting that revelers buy all their 
recreational narcotics from him.

Petrik, who has a degree in electrical engineering from the University of 
Michigan, was the founder of Middle Marz, a Web-design company. The 
company's Web site boasts that "the functional works of art that we build 
exude grace, vivid exposition, and style."

Officers familiar with the investigation suggested Petrik had established 
something of a creepy cult of personality at the 3,000-square-foot loft. He 
called the weekly parties "Project There" and the space "Palace There." 
Covering the walls were Petrik's "proverbs," written on paper that was 
burnt around the edges.

The loft also had a recording studio -- called "Studio There" -- and a 
"cultivation room" for marijuana, although none was growing. The Middle 
Marz Web site contains testimonies to Petrik's attributes, written by 
friends and associates. One calls him the "most aggressive, intelligent, 
and confident person I have ever met."

"Someday you will be famous, I just wonder what for -- music, business, 
computers, inventions?" the note reads. Another writer says, "I feel 
blessed to be a part of your journey." Yet another writes, "I feel that I 
am blessed because of the honor I get every day to call you my friend."

The Ecstasy confiscated has a retail street value of about $18,000, 
according to Capt. Tim Hettrich of the narcotics division. He said police 
are seeing younger and younger Ecstasy users.

Don't believe anything that Examiner article says. There was
a bust there, but the inside info says that article just
quoted is bunk.

Wassup. Tonight is Dirtbox Radio Show #109. And as always we're bringin
you what you can't get enough of. Well, as far as drums and bass go anyways....

ODJ's busy workin on his next video of insanity, so he's most likely not
gonna be around until late. That leaves Jerel in charge. That's right, I'm
takin over today, and there's nothin y'all can do about it but enjoy the
madness that ensues.

But, enough waffle, on to the lineup.

7-8pm EST - Jerel opens the show up solo style. I'm prepared to tear some
shit up. This may be the last time ODJ will be so foolish as to leave the
show in my hands. Gotta take advantage of it, ya know?

8-9:30pm EST - Winterman - Long-time DC soldier Winterman stops by to
showcase his style of warfare. Tonight he'll be droppin bombs of the DnB
variety, and it'll be sure to cause some damage. Pay attention, or ya
might get hit with some shrapnel.

9:30-11pm EST - Relapse - This man does not fuck around. Never one to
disappoint, he knows how to tear the roof off a club. Tonight, he's gonna
tear the roof off yer house. So ready yer eardrums, collect yer precious
belongings, and prepare to be taken through the middle of a whirlwind of
beats and a thunderstorm of bass. Keep yer hands inside the ride at all times.

11pm-?? EST - Afterhours - If ODJ's slow ass hasn't made it back in time
for Afterhours, he's fired. Jerel will at least hold it down. Maybe some
special guests. Who knows? Just stay tuned, so ya don't miss out on the finale.

--0-29366623-1084148238=:94059
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

Hey people,

Some time ago I listened to a track from Fiery Dawn, NightFall. I enjoyed this track a lot and proposed him to do a remix. I called the remix Moonlight Bells because I felt the bells where the essence of the track. 

It's hard to describe the track, I think it's a bit different from the ones I did before, more raw/energetic. 

Give me your opinion, Fiery Dawn and myself will enjoy your feedback.

Click the following link for the fully mastered mp3 audio track:

Thanks,

    hehe

ok, so i never saw any of the harry potter movies till tonight. . .cool =
movie. . .

I thought it was interesting tho, that in the movie they celebrated =
christmas, which was never a wiccan tradition, and the actual celbration =
is Yule, winter solstice (the longest night).=20
Traditional celebration of yule includes, burning of yule logs, bringing =
evergreens into the home and decorating them (sometimes decorating), =
exchanging gifts, spending time with family, wassail cups, and =
decorations of mistletoe. The tradition is a celebration of the goddess =
giving birth to the sun god (summer solstice is the death of the sun =
god, in christian/catholic religion the sun god is jesus) all of these =
traditions are pagan, and have always been so,  long before christianity =
ever came to be. . .

not like thats the only inconsistency, there really is no such thing as =
wizards, withches are simply witches, male of female. . .wizards are =
ficticious and created by storytellers and movies.

theres a ton of ideas in the movie that show that the producer had =
little knowledge of actual pagan religious activities. . . but it was a =
really fun movie still. . .if only abc didn't show friggin commercials =
every 3 minutes. . . .

anyways, just my thoughts. . .now I kinda want to read the books and see =
the other harry potter movies. . . fun fantasy stuff. . .good for kids. =

take care

Well, they're trying to stress that he's raised in a 'normal' world.  In
the world of Harry Potter, the incredible often plays just outside the
field of vision.  Everybody at Hogwart's is normal, except that magic is
part of their way of life.  Also, regarding "Christmas", From a Christian
accuracy point of view, the date is *way* off for it to be a celebration
of the birth of christ (Christ's birth has been pegged by most scholars at
late summer/early fall).

Um, you're choosing one cultural mythology as truth above others (I don't
blame you, the recent upswing in interest in Celtic Pagan study has
overshadowed almost all other areas... unfortunately Celtic tradition has
some of the worst corroborating documentation going back, and most texts
I've seen borrow heavily from other cultures without acknowledgement -
including the explanation you posted above (check the link, didn't read
the whole thing but it looks right from what I glanced at)... we know of
the druids, but we do not know of female witch practice in ancient British
Isle history according to any classic texts, the female witches we hear of
came from Bavaria and many of the rites practiced by "celtic" tradition
magic folk are actually Ellusian in origin).  In Slavic/Baltic magic and
folklore, there *are* wizards who are not merely male witches (although
more like 'druids' in behavior and appearance than Tolkein's wizards), as
well as witches and they play a yin and yang as far as their roles.
Their innate abilities are often used together in a complimentary fashion
to achieve goals.

-&e->theres a ton of ideas in the movie that show that the producer had
-&e->little knowledge of actual pagan religious activities. . . but it was
-&e->a really fun movie still. . .if only abc didn't show friggin
-&e->commercials every 3 minutes. . . .

Witchcraft and paganism are only tied by the Christian belief that they
are both aspects of worship outside of that dictated by scripture.  Many
cultures that practiced witchcraft were not polythestic (the traditional
definition of "pagan" is either non-Christian/Jew/Muslim or polytheist),
and many even worshipped Jesus, Virgin Mary, etc.  For many generations in
lands conquered by the Holy Roman empire or other Christian control,
witchcraft was still studied within the limits of Christianity (something
you continue to see today... in Mexico, South America, Haiti, Jamaica, and
many other places).

Of course the Harry Potter movie are set in England, so it's
understandable that you'd percieve it within Celtic culture, but the Celts
were far from the only people practicing witchcraft historically... and
have some of the worst records (little culture isolated from christian
indoctrination unlike say, Siberian Shamans or Gypsy practitioners which
we've actually been able to study in the 20th century).

-&e->anyways, just my thoughts. . .now I kinda want to read the books and
-&e->see the other harry potter movies. . . fun fantasy stuff. . .good for
-&e->kids. . .

Especially reading about them.  The movies are done really well, and it's
cool seeing kids rush to finish the books before they see them come out.

Just my $.02

Subject: Re: [sfraves] nrr. . . harry potter was just on

I always love your posts aw. . .

: )

I was suprised how much you knew about this subject. . .I didn't mention the
celtic part cuz I don't fully believe that as the origin. . .I have various
books that kind of contrast eachother on the subject. . .

yknow, there are some awesomely wonderful books geared towards teens and
youngsters regarding witches and magic, written by people like cunningham,
weinstein and others. They even have books specifically constructed towards
teens using positive energy in their lives, books that have lil spells n
such for schoolkids. . .

I really love kids, I'm happy to see positive portrayal or these spiritual
crafts in society today, and information that help lead kids on a long happy
positive life. . .

on a side note, my favorite kids are my friends kids. . .he has a son named
noah (4-5), and a daughter named cassidy (8-9 yrs). . .they are super
gorgeous kids, that amaze me with their intelligence and personalities. . .I
hope I'm lucky enuf one day to have kids that wonderful. . .if not tho I'll
prolly just borrow his. . .

really really interesting tho. . .

thank you for your insight. . .

very nice


take care

We'll Be Asking The Questions Here

April 20, 2004

  I'm sure by now you've all seen those delightful Internet personality 
quizzes, where you answer a pile of questions about your personality, and 
are rewarded with answers to questions you had previously never thought to 
ask: Which anime character are you? Which Dungeons & Dragons character 
class are you? Which French region are you? Which version of the popular 
prime time television franchise "Law and Order" are you? Which syphilitic 
side effect are you? Etc.

In the spirit of continuing to make the Internet as pedestrian as humanly 
possible, while at the same time perpetuating a wide range of offensive 
stereotypes that completely undermines the overall mission of the Vaults of 
Erowid, I am proud to present the latest and greatest Internet personality 
quiz for your enjoyment:

  WHICH PSYCHOACTIVE SUBSTANCE ARE YOU?

Now the key to this quiz is to just react ­ don't spend time thinking about 
your answer. For the vast majority of you, this will not be a problem. 
Also, please be completely truthful and forthright ­ otherwise you won't 
get an honest result, and also, the NSA will not be able to properly update 
your file.


The music I most enjoy listening to at a party is:

         1.      Extremely repetitive thump-thump music that makes me shake 
my fist in the air and feel very good about myself for no discernible reason

         2.      Crazy improvisational rock and roll where the reason I 
have to follow the band from town to town is that I don't know when they're 
going to get around to playing the end of that song I like

         3.      Unnerving experimental jazz performed by torturing the 
parents of the musicians, recording their screams, and using them as the 
emotional foundation for ironic aural explorations of the motifs of modernity

         4.      Bombastic classical music that must be enjoyed lying 
prone, blindfolded, cocooned in an isolation tank, after twelve years of 
silent meditation atop a mountain peak on the far side of the world, having 
eaten nothing but dirt and wind, in order to appreciate the true majestic 
godlike genius embodied by the viola line throughout the final three measures

         5.      Art Garfunkel


The thing I most want to be remembered for after I die is:

         1.      The sheer amount of honey-dipped good vibrations I spread 
to all the good peoples of this magical planet

         2.      The staggering breadth of my contributions to vital fields 
of medicine, science, and research

         3.      The incredible amount of ammunition and explosives I had 
hidden on my person at the time

         4.      The serene and peaceful look on my face that tells whoever 
finds me that I did not die in pain, no matter how much blood is on the walls

         5.      My sofa ­ I really like my sofa


If I were a snack food, I would most likely be:

         1.      A huge, monster-sized bag of cheese puffs

         2.      An artfully arranged assortment of crackers and cheeses 
from around the globe

         3.      A whole pig, roasted in a freshly-dug pit for twelve hours

         4.      Candied orange wedges made out of a synthetic foodstuff 
based on matter found only on asteroids

         5.      My own vomit


When entities emerge from the walls attempting to communicate, my first 
reaction is to:

         1.      Reach out with my heart and send powerful messages of love 
and friendship

         2.      Put down the pipe ­ I've had enough

         3.      Attempt to steal their wallets

         4.      Rip their fucking throats out with my teeth for 
interrupting the really good sex I was having with the police chief's kid

         5.      Ask myself, "What would Jesus do?"


When I snap back to consciousness, only to find myself on a Greyhound bus 
heading for the border, covered in filth, muttering incoherently and not 
wearing pants, I usually:

         1.      Laugh it off and chalk it up to another lesson from the 
Trickster

         2.      Bum a smoke from the recently paroled murderer next to me

         3.      Attempt to stop the hemorrhaging

         4.      Make mental note: that was fun, but probably didn't get a 
threshold dose

         5.      Begin shouting "Turn this bus around or I will introduce 
you to my bodyguard, BEERBELLY THE INVISIBLE CLOWN, and his MINIONS OF 
INFERNAL LAUGHING MENACE!" Then, kill myself


Okay, let's tally up your score! For each time your answer was 1, give 
yourself three points; for each time your answer was 2, give yourself five 
points; for each time your answer was 3, give yourself eight points; for 
each time your answer was 4, give yourself ten points; and for each time 
your answer was 5, give yourself 1,027,433 points. Perform a fast Fourier 
transformation on the partial products of the point values associated with 
each answer. Then take a Cartesian product of those values with the 
original answers that you provided, followed by a Gram-Schmidt process on 
the results, treating each as a polynomial. Calculate the standard 
deviation. When you have an answer, set yourself on fire. In your flailing 
death throes, the answer will be revealed to you, as though a veil was 
being peeled back allowing you to see the true machinery of the universe 
(do not mistake your skin peeling back for the veil peeling back ­ it's a 
common error). You will at that moment know yourself as one of the 
following psychoactive substances:

Ecstasy ­ You are truly at one with the inherent bliss and wonder of 
reality, and are showered with blessings at every turn. Your heart is open 
to a wide range of emotional contexts, and your friendships and 
relationships are deep, meaningful, and annoying to other people. You get 
spare changed a lot and recently lost your car on the classic "59 Switch" 
con, even though instead of a gorgeous eighteen-year-old as the bait, the 
scammers used your own grandmother.

  Marijuana ­ Nothing interferes with your ability to have a good time. 
Responsibility takes a back seat to a great rekkid on the stereo and a home 
cooked meal. It's the simple pleasures in life that mean the most to you: a 
good conversation, a long weekend, remembering your own name when asked 
several times by the person who is almost your ex-boss. You pride yourself 
on still being able to count to four, as long as both hands are not in 
handcuffs and you do not actually need to count to four.

  Acid ­ Your sharp, analytical mind is suffused with a questioning nature 
that puts you in regular contact with the fundamental issues that define 
humanity as a self-conscious organism. You know well the gnosis that comes 
from such heightened understanding, and you are at peace with your 
mortality. Which is good, because you have been lost on the streets of 
Chicago for several years now, wondering where the hell your apartment is 
and why won't they stop shouting inside your head.

Speed ­ If anyone comes any closer, they will die by your sure and steady 
hands. For weeks, you have waited patiently for this moment, and now by the 
grace of a god you do not believe in, you can take your pick of any of a 
dozen federal agents on your lawn, who believe you are on the second floor 
of the house, when in fact, you are cleverly hidden ten feet away in a tree 
house made of twigs, cigarette butts, and part of your own small intestine. 
Your breath is not particularly fresh.

2-TC-Special-G ­ You should be so lucky.

That's it for this month's edition of eScottology, friends! Tune in next 
time when we lock Myers and Briggs in a room, dose them with datura extract 
when they aren't looking, and webcast their wacky antics as they struggle 
helplessly to comprehend the way the ceiling seems to be threatening them 
in Portuguese!

hello all. I have been irresistibly drawn to this
city, where I will back up sewers, reverse street
signs, and steal everybody's left shoe. but I was also
hoping to pick up some records here and there in
between all that other activity. but the landscape has
changed and I need some help. I'm so out of touch I
went to Braindrops looking for a mixtape. consider me
a recently thawed caveman and this my heartfelt ook.
where can I find me some breaks?

bpm is great and the owner is an awesome guy.

i also really enjoy digging in the used section of amoeba both in the city 
and in berkeley.  i've found some great records that way, but you have to 
know what you're looking for.

and i will also say that skills in berkeley has a decent breaks section.

check em all out!

ah...DJ Bam!

I have one of his mixes on one of my
computers...somewhere...

they made me a saint soon after they made me a
reverend. I got reverended-ed, and then I reverend-ed
everybody on an e-mail list I was on, and then I told
them, hey, I just reverend-ed about 70 people, and
they said, give us your address, we're making you a
saint.

Amoeba's awesome but I am kinda hoping for that
old-school "put it on the platter" feel. they have
like fifteen white labels which are allegedly by DJ
Assault but I couldn't listen to any of them.

thank god Skills is still around. I was worried.

Skills ain't got shit on Primal's breaks selection. Primal is actually up to
date and has decent stuff. Skills has shit from 3 years ago that sucked then
and sucks worse now.

I buy almost strictly online these days.

There will be broadcast on the continuing epidemic of this mystery skin =
disease airing tonight on ktvu-2 at 10pm.

some of us call it morgellons, a name given to children with a similar =
disease thru europe in the late 1500 thru 1600's. . . you can read about =
morgellons at www.morgellons.org

this should be a large scale broadcast partly based on the previous ktvu =
report, and should be the one originating from a news agency in =
washington with a friend of mine who I met over a year ago thru a =
related message board.=20

check it out. . .it will most likely also be available in the next few =
days thru ktvu's website. . .

there also will be an upcoming USA Today report on this subject. . =
.along with many other news agencies. . .=20

take care all
don't forget to take your minerals

--=====================_8802176==.ALT
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"; format=flowed


It's been almost a year since the last Come-Unity so we hope you are ready 
for what will be a rockin' night.  Proceeds from this event, our 13th 
Anniversary, will benefit Andie, an old friend and our first doorperson for 
many years. Andie is bravely fighting serious illness and will  really 
appreciate our support. There is a rumor she may even do the door for an 
hour on Friday night. You'll recognize her by her gorgeous smile.

So please get your most comfy shoes on and come down to 'MIGHTY!', a great 
new venue that features the old Townsend Sound System, revamped, painted 
and ready for some wicked tunes. -- Malachy O'Brien


COME-UNITY 13TH ANNIVERSARY PARTY

Simon
Jeno
Garth
Cosmic Jason
Charlotte the Baroness

Club Mighty, at 15th and Utah
$10 before 11PM, $15 after.  21+

 From an early Come-Unity flier:

"When used with positive intention, group energy has the potential to help
restore the plan of Love on Earth...When you open your heart, and trust the
whole group you dance with,  when you feel love with everyone, and they
return it, a higher viberation can be reached.  This happens when a crowd is
deep into the vibe of House...In the true sense of rhythmic movement, the
effect is to align the physical, mental and emotional bodies with the
Oneness of All that Is...Don't put out negative energy and feelings.  Leave
the old ways behind.  Throw yourself into the winds of transformation and
sow the seeds for a new world -- one where the human family is together
again.  When people respect and care for each other as a
community-organism...Spread the Peace!"

"The welfare of the people in particular has always been the alibi of 
tyrants, and it provides the further advantage of giving the servants of 
tyranny a good conscience."
-Albert Camus

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the 
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become 
visible."
-Jacques Attali in his seminal text "Noise"

"I loved the focus in the early days of Wicked on the pagan aspects of 
life. The natural cycles of the full moons, being out in nature, on the 
beach, free, alive, unbridled, wild and spontaneous. There is no club, 
party or other sound system that has ever achieved anything close to that..."
-Jeno, on the early days of Wicked and the Full Moon Raves

i'm doing my part to support local record stores.  it's kinda like 
buying from Cole Hardware instead of Home Despot.  The money the local 
stores make stays in the local economy, which only improves the scene, 
not to mention the economic base!

and yes... Primal kicks ass for house and breaks. i forgot about them, 
being the City Snob that i am. ;-)  (that is, i don't like crossing the 
bridge unless i HAVE to)

Don't know where fliers have been placed, if anywhere at this point.  I

Subject: [sfraves] for you MAME junkies

i just got 6 DVDs with classic video game ROMs (over 4,700 games!).

if anyone is into old games, get me some blank DVDs and i'll burn 'em 
for you.  i live in the Mission/SoMA/Duboce area.  I honestly don't 
know what the fuck this area is called, but i'm right in the middle of 
the city. i say this, cuz you'd have to drop off/pick up the discs.

i'm going to build a cocktail table arcade cabinet later this summer.  
if anyone else is interested in such a project, let me know and maybe 
we can combine forces to work out a good cabinet design. i'd also like 
to hear from anyone who might have experience with this sort of 
project.

i'm off to play Q*bert now...  :-)

Subject: Re: [sfraves] best local source for breaks

I would buy more at stores if they had a better selection. Someone needs to 
make me their breaks buyer so's I can get a decent selection in their 
shop....

That's my big gripe. I do try and buy largely domestically if at all 
possible however....

Yo. I already have a few shells - but they're all academic institutions
etc and not in this state. I'm getting a Sidekick today, and I need a good
SF-local provider so I can do things properlike from my hiptop.
Preferably a company that won't hammer any stupid restrictions onto my use
- let me install the software I need to use etc.

Any suggestions?

i offer full-service hosting but if you just wanna do a yearly-fee shell =
acount, let me know what
kind of disk space you are looking for and price would be fair to you.

this is me: http://5angle.com

yeah, i started this business 'cause i couldn't stand most ISPs either.

well, due to situations beyond our control, we had no breaks at shadow 
lounge last thursday.  it was a sad, and dark day for san francisco.  but 
this week we are back with a vengence!!!  our special guest this week is DJ 
Icon, whom you older SF heads may remember as a trance DJ...but she's now 
seen the light and is spinning breaks.  others may now her as the DJ on 
MTV's Wade Robson project.  she recently opened for the Chemical Brothers at 
Mezzanine during their latest tour of the US.

also on the decks, Evil Breaks residents Aaron Jae and M.O.D.  Also, 
Influence is back again to rock the decks.

Man, I wish people still thought and spoke this way..  I've found what
is written above to be utterly true, on the right night with the right
mix of people and music..  If somebody wrote that on a flyer these
days, you'd be able to hear the calls of "F**kin' e-tards!  Hahaha" for
miles!  We need to get some hope and euphoria back into the scene.

Dhur, now I sound like all the 15-year old candykids who post going,
"Where'd the plur go, yo?"..  :)

Cheers,
George

Subject: Re: [sfraves] BSP:  Come-Unity 13th Anniversary Friday

Woah,

I have a flyer similiar to this from Come-Unity with *almost the same
text* - one side has "Heal Our Mother Earth" with many things you can do
to change the world we live in in a positive way, such as suggestions for
activism, hazardous products, recycling, transportation, pesticides/eating
habits, trees, home energy use, water conservation - ending with the
quote:
"We all have a responsibility to the earth." "Learn to love it and treat
it right."

On the other side is the text

House Music and Planetary Healing

When used with positive intention, Group Energy has the potential to help
restore the Plan of Love on Earth. If you have been exploring House
parties, or have found a home in them, you will, of course, be aware of
the intoxicating Energy leveles reached sometimes, both personally and
collectively. It is possible to understand better the Energy we tap into
and take it a step further. There are many preliminary ingredients to
becoming spiritually aware, and even more to be able to focus and channel
Energy. Those aspects can be discussed another time. For now, this is what
can be done for that moment: OPEN YOUR HEART!!!

Wen you open your heart, and trust the whole group you dance with; when
you feel love with everyone, and they return it, a higher vibration can be
reached. This happens when a crowd is deep into the vibe of House. What we
have here, when the crowd is open is the ability to access some extremely
beneficial Energies, and focus them instead of losing them. Down through
the ages this knowledge has been available to the few who have been able
to recognize it; it seems the House Nation has tapped in.

In the true use of rhythmic movement, the effect is to align the physical,
mental, and emotional bodies with the Oneness of All that is. And this
lining up, when coupled with intense aspirations of love and high
desire,"...results in a downflow of Force from illumination. When an
entire concourse of people is thus animated by a single high desire, when
their auras blend and form one united channel for the downflow, the effect
is tremendously intensified and can be WORLD WIDE IN ITS RADIUS." [Alice
A. Bailey, 1919]

Help push the consciousness another level into Enlightenment. It's up to
each of at the party (rave) to make it happen. Don't put out negative
energy and feelings. Leave the old ways behind. Throw yourself into the
winds of transformation and sow the seeds for a new world--one where the
human family is together again. When people respect and care for each
other as a community-organism. It's up to us to spread the vibe.

Spread the peace!
You can make a difference.

--Oldskool Come-Unity flyer, circa 1992 or so
transcribed by karina

:)

Peace
Love
Unity
Respect,

Subject: [sfraves] BSP:UPLIFT-Viberation Reunion


hey all, this is a quick tease for this thursday, it is a free shindig at 
the Sublounge (20th and 3rd st) in SF 2$ tecates, 3$ wells
I would not be involved in the scene if it weren't for these guys, so that 
is why I wanted to dedicate this night to them.  If you all have just 
started partying, you should really take a look at the roots of the SF 
underground scene.  Viberation was a group of wonderful, amazing kids, 
friends and dj's who really knew how to play.  That is why I love them.  
There was a cafe in santa clara off of Stevens Crk and Lawrence xpwy called 
City Espresso (City E) Where I was the local barrista which had clientelle 
of folks such as Shane (CODE-when he was a computer guy before the djing), 
Greg Sandler, AndyW, Alex, Mike McGursky, Terry, Paula, Matt Schmidt, Vlad, 
AndyW Li, Micron Pyro, ...the whole gang, very great people.  It is too bad 
that they do not play together all that much anymore, The last party I 
really remember was at the Brookdale Lodge in the  SC mountains, a halloween 
party...off the hook. but this thursday a good chunk of them will be playing 
for you, for free.
here is the tease:
starting out we have our very own Calamity Jane to butter up Micron and Dan 
gorlick who will be tagging some sweet progressive Lick the Micron-typ-a 
tunes, from there we have Li Sasaki who is going to fuck with our heads in 
the way he did recently at Primero de Mayo, after Li, his twin brother, 
AndyW will be rocking us out to finish up the night and to give us something 
really good to dream about (no, not that you big pervert)
Apparently Noah is living outta state as well as Alex (siphon and Science) 
so they could not make it.  Maybe down the road.
Hopefully we will see you all there this thursday, may 13th
Peace,
Danny retired- bAByHueY

Wicked (Jeno, Markie, Garth and Thomas) brought rave culture and music from 
the UK to the Bay Area, along with Malachy O'Brien, Martin of the Gathering 
and other rave pioneers in the early 90s. They showed us that raving was 
not just an all-night "party" but rather a new paradigm for human 
interaction -- bringing love and respect to the dance floor and then into 
our lives. Those nights totally transformed my life for the better, and I 
owe these ravers much of what is good in my soul today.

The Wicked dancefloor was often the beach. It was an awesome experience to 
dance all night with the full moon above reflecting onto the ocean to 
cutting edge house music with an excellent sound system. Then watching the 
sun come up and dancing on till noon or so. We really felt like brothers 
and sisters then, and one with the natural forces around us.

When we weren't celebrating the full moon we went to parties like 
Come-Unity where that vibe continued.

Malachy, even though paralyzed from the neck down in an accident coming 
back from a Wicked FMR, kept Come-Unity and that original raver spirit 
alive, and if you come this Friday you will see him in his wheel chair 
grooving with the rest of us. Remarkable man.

For those of you who don't know about Malachy, Come-Unity and the Full Moon

"The welfare of the people in particular has always been the alibi of 
tyrants, and it provides the further advantage of giving the servants of 
tyranny a good conscience."
-Albert Camus

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the 
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become 
visible."
-Jacques Attali in his seminal text "Noise"

"I loved the focus in the early days of Wicked on the pagan aspects of 
life. The natural cycles of the full moons, being out in nature, on the 
beach, free, alive, unbridled, wild and spontaneous. There is no club, 
party or other sound system that has ever achieved anything close to that..."
-Jeno, on the early days of Wicked and the Full Moon Raves

PSYCHEDELIC AT 60

An increase in habitual marijuana use among U.S.  adults overall is
troubling news -- but it gets downright unnerving when you break down the
data.

Over the past decade, according to government figures released Tuesday,
marijuana abuse or dependence has increased 22 percent among adults in
general.  Yet when you narrow the field to those between 45 and 64, the
rate increased by a stunning 355 percent.

As with so many other demographic anomalies, blame the baby boomers.  A
lot of aging stoners apparently are little inclined to go gently into that
good night without their bongs or roach clips.

This isn't what Congress meant in supporting a drug benefit for the
elderly.  Any drug addiction is bad.  But considering the inevitable
physical decline that aging brings -- from slower reaction times to poor
night vision -- it could be especially dire for older abusers.  You don't
want a bunch of toked up geriatrics rushing out in their Buicks to cure
the late-night munchies.  For that matter, you don't even want them ahead
of you in the cafeteria checkout line, dazedly fumbling for senior
discount cards.

Turn on, tune in and drop out may have seemed cool in the psychedelic '60s
-- but it's a definite bummer in the arthritic 80s.

Viberation hosted Ascension 2 years ago. That was one hell of a night
musically. I only have Science's set from that night though. I'll never
forget when we did the Paranormal party at Brookdale. So much time and
effort went into that event and it was all produced in a month. Nothing
beats having a halloween party in a spot that really is haunted. I still
have the glow in the dark oiji board in my room from that night. Sadly Noah
and Alex have moved away. Hopefully a party from Viberation will occur again
soon and all that great talent will be present.

I think I'll have to come out an say hello for this one.

Thanks for the reminder Ryan.  I miss Alex and Noah too.  Good times.

Paranormal was 4 years ago?  Seems much longer.  Has anyone successfully
converted "raver" years to "normal" years?

ps: I just got Friday off, so get yer drinkin' shoes on AndyW ;)

Subject: Re: [sfraves] nrr. . .Mystery skin disease report tonight at 10

hey all

heres the latest ktvu report (from last night):
http://www.ktvu.com/video/3293470/detail.html


and heres the first one:
http://www.ktvu.com/video/2888865/detail.html

ktvu is odd, I thought cathy was going to be in this one, but it was wendy.
. they certainly aren't much for communicating, but they deserve respect
being that they're the first and one of the major networks keeping up with
this. I wonder why like ABC hasn't jumped on. ..

also, the people coming out with this publicly deserve our gratitude. . .tho
i haven't had any badd experiences yet from people who've seen me on there.
. .I'm sure some people, like maybe concerned parents who have kids who go
to school with infected kids, might have issues with it. . .

a thought. .. the area near my house where footage was taped, on the bay,
near this water treatment plant, is now a big housing development. . .Does
anyone know if I could be prosecuted/sued or whatever somehow if i was to .
. .like put up flyers and pass out flyers telling these people they may be
living in a dangerous area with potentially hazardous parasitic organisms
which may or may not create life threatening situations for them, their
pets, and their children ? Like if the people suddenly wanted to move out,
and possibly sue the development company. . .could they go after me cuz I
basically caused the peoples leaving ?

Also if interested, I have letters to the CA state health dept. and their
response to the letter. .. (not the one wendy sent, but another friend, the
morgellons research foundation founder). I could paste them into an email or
send the attachment. ..

take care all

hey all

There will be broadcast on the continuing epidemic of this mystery skin
disease airing tonight on ktvu-2 at 10pm.

some of us call it morgellons, a name given to children with a similar
disease thru europe in the late 1500 thru 1600's. . . you can read about
morgellons at www.morgellons.org

this should be a large scale broadcast partly based on the previous ktvu
report, and should be the one originating from a news agency in washington
with a friend of mine who I met over a year ago thru a related message
board.

check it out. . .it will most likely also be available in the next few days
thru ktvu's website. . .

there also will be an upcoming USA Today report on this subject. . .along
with many other news agencies. . .

take care all
don't forget to take your minerals

: )

Subject: Re: [sfraves] BSP:  Come-Unity 13th Anniversary Friday

some people still do talk like that...

do you remember when people stopped calling them 'raves' and started 
calling them 'parties'?

i do, and if i remember correctly, that's about the time that the scene 
started to lose its sense of optimism.  lots of people got 
disillusioned, perhaps from making raves their whole LIFE, aided by a 
dependence on drugs that allowed them let loose and believe in that 
optimism.

now that i think about it, all my fuddy-duddy geriatric raver friends 
and i have something in common: we kept balance in our lives, and made 
an effort to spend time with each other outside of the scene.  PLUR is 
easy when your serotonin levels are through the roof. but take it 
outside of the venue, and it's not only more rewarding - it's genuine, 
and infectious.

so, if you want to get that hope and euphoria back, start meeting 
people outside of the scene, and start taking them to good underground 
events... it works - trust me.

i love dirty ravers AND dirty raving.  if i remember correctly, one of the 
first face-to-face conversations i had with veanne was at 550 
barnaveld...and i think it was the way i was dancing or something and i 
remember her blurting out something like "you fucking raver!" in her 
graceful, drunken state.

it was great.  after that i fell madly in love with her.

If you're on this list you're a dirty raver. Even if Andy Dubya took up
wearing Armani suits every day he'd still be a dirty raver. If you can't
admit you're a dirty raver you don't belong here. =)

Got that one.

such a beautiful song.  remember "cool world" the lame movie?  not the rave.

it was on that sound track.  can't believe fsol did that song.  well at
the time it wasn't so weird, but seeing what they released since then
makes it strange.

Yea - the D&B mix is tight. I have the original and the Hybrid remix as well 
- both smoking (as far as I'm concerned).

I actually have a nice collection of similar style breaks (from the same 
era) that I keep meaning to slap down on a mix. Stuff like God Within's 
"Crucial Introspection", Miro's "Paradise" (Creeping Farmatronic mix), Fade 
"No Resolve" (Nutribe mix), etc.

Good shit - especially for a chillout set.

Just to alert you folks - the video of this is floating around the internet 
right now. If someone sends you the link, do yourself a favor and DO NOT 
watch it. It is possibly the most disturbing thing I have ever had the 
misfortune of seeing in my entire life.

You might think to yourself you want to see it out of curiosity, or because 
you want to know what happens to our citizens because of our fucked up 
government - but trust me, you will feel AWFUL after seeing it. Just know 
that it is 100% real, and that it is 110% horrible.

So much from the SF scene hgas derived from what you all have created...When 
are we actually going to have a viberation campout :P
At least Andy isn't a dirty, gay raver, then I would have some competition 
:)
I really wish Noah and Alex were around, I miss them, does anyone know how 
they are doing, where the hell they actually are?  I heard Noah was in AZ?  
Alex is back east with Jenny???
oh well.
that'll be the day when I move outta the state

p.s. Consumption Junction has the video.  although i DO NOT suggest you view
it.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] Mexican Air Force films 11 UFO's (NRR)

I can speak a little Spanish, but I won't be able to
check that out for a while. they probably weren't
saying "puto," tho, unless they thought the UFOs were
somehow homosexual UFOs, which seems unlikely, altho
it would explain all those anal probes.

actually New Mexico, where I usually live, is right
near the US-Mexico border (duh), and we get lots of
UFOs there too. sometimes stars at night move in
impossible ways, sometimes a strange humming noise
overhead, etc.

I'm listening to Hybrid, "Studio Mix @ Radio 1"
and Papua New Guinea was just mixed in! I love this song! Long before it
was remixed into dnb, it was somewhat of an anthem played at events
throughout the Bay Area. One of my favorite times hearing it was at the
SFR 10 Year Anniversary. Brian Behlendorf added it to his ambient set :)

hey!  that's not papua new guinea.

it's rabbit in the moon / hardkiss.  man, does that song bring back 
memories...

first time i heard it was on the way home from my first Dead show at 
Shoreline... i was tripping like mad, sitting in the back seat of my 
friend's jetta.  He turns back and says "check this out guys", and puts 
the CD in.

wheeeeeeee!

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR: American Hostage Execution

I haven't seen it. . .I don't know if I will. . .

but you know that "ignorance is bliss" saying. . .

it's reality, these things happen. . .ignoring the fact that they happen
doesn't make it not happen. . .
sure most people shouldn't watch it, most people would probably be very
disturbed I'm sure.

but I feel personally, that some people should be aware and see, and
understand the things that are happening.

the thoughtless murders all over the world are an all too simple "cut n dry"
kind of situations, with little emotion or feeling by the person perfoming
them.

I think that potential murderers especially should be familiar with the
emotional connection, and feelings involved in such an act.

Like the sec of defence, or the president. . .they're ordering people to
kill all sorts of people left and right and don't think twice about it (or
even once really). . .but if the same people were to actually witness the
acts they were responsible (over and over), than I'm sure they would be much
more thoughtful of the entire issue before they so lightheartedly make such
orders. . .

I think witnessing such brutal acts should be encouraged. . .I bet the same
people would never look at a simple murder the same way. . .death is death.
. .it's no less wrong for a military officer to simply shoot someone, or
even something like "lethal injection", than it is when someone kills
another by any other means. . .Television especially has created the idea of
murder being a simple and acceptable act, but it's much much more involved
than that.

Take for example, that situation where the dea agent accidentily shot
himself during a gun safety assembly at a school. If the children didn't
directly witness the officer shoot himself, I doubt the children would have
had such strong feeling on the subject.

inhumane treatment. . .?
Humans kill. . . killing is killing. .. theres no nicer or meaner way to do
it. . .the worlds full of pain and torture of all sorts.

they all do it and theres no excuse. . .

to me the victim in this situation was somewhat innocent of the charges
against him (wasn't he building comm towers there for work?)
I ask you all, would you have the same feelings if you viewed the same
murder of a US military official who was known for killing many others ?
Probably not. . . some might even think he deserved it. . .but the act
itself wouldnt be any more justified.So then it ends up being more of a
disgust in the treatment of the specific person, than it is a disagreement
with the idea of murder, which I believe overall is wrong.

murder is the culprit here, and it's a world that we all have created and in
ways supported, so realistically we're all partly responsible. It doesn't
matter who or how they're murdered, killing in general is wrong.

If somehow the US recorded effects of their massive bombing, where i'm sure
many innocent (if anyone really is) mothers and shildren slowly burned to
death, lost limbs, were slowly crushed, whatever. . . then it would be a big
deal. And it does/did happen, and still happens, and no one cares simply
because they aren't direct witness to it and have lil or no emotional
involvement.

people don't fully realize that when they go into the military, they will
take others' lives. They make light of it, being brutal or not, using
excuses like they're fighting for their freedom, etc. But then those same
people get all broken up when their "enemy" does the same to them. . .


it's fucked up. . .but it's reality.

not to sound like I have no feelings for this guy or his family, but
honestly. . .what about the many many thousands and thousands of others. . .
the situations to me are no diffirent. . .murder is murder in all shapes and
forms. . .

I think the world needs to be more aware of the consequences of their
horrible acts, and not just knowing the consequences, but knowing and
understanding deeply, the acts which they commit and have part in.Actually
feeling the emotional implications of their actions.To me it doesn't matter
if they do it or we do it. . .it's all wrong, and it's everyones
responsibility.

I'm curious to see the future horrible acts our "wonderful" country is going
to commit in retaliation of this single well known act. Would there be much
retaliation of any kind if it was a simple unrecorded kidnap and murder
(even if it he was beheaded also, but not on tape). . .I doubt.

I bet if there was no video, hardly anyone would care, he would just be a
casualty. . .so in my opinion it was good that it was recorded, and gives
people a chance to (in a way) experience the acts they think and feel so
little for.

*I couldn't find the video on the consumption junction site ? Was I looking
at the wrong one ?
And yknow Adult Friend Finder (I got a popup ad from the site). . .aff
works, I've gone to a few aff events and had a few "encounters" myself.
Interesting people, I always ended up being the cute lil boy being hit on by
all these overrage couples wanting to take me home with them.I'm not
actively involved with aff these days tho.(like on a lighter note).*

but yeah,

I think the recent events that have been recorded and photographed have
given us a lil more insight into some of the normal daily actions our world
is committing. Overall I think people needed to see these things.

take care

aK

Didn't bother me in the slightest and for those that want to see the
brutality of war let me know and I'll link you. It was sad to see it happen,
but given how much horrible shit like this goes on daily I can't be shocked
by it. I've been saying this elsewhere...

Death is death. Murder is murder. Killing is killing.

Just because it was an American in Iraq that got beheaded on video doesn't
change anything. Think about all the horrible shit going down in African
nations lately let alone all the shit that happens in our backyard. How many
people have been murdered in the bay area since the new year? Yeah... It's
all the same to me. It's all fucked up.

Yeah, but by killing an American and releasing the footage, you get your
message printed in large type on the front page of the SF Chronicle (and
many other papers too I'msure).

Ordinarily things like that don't bother me much as I know it's human nature 
for these things to happen. Still - for some reason this particular thing 
seriously disturbed me, and many people I know. I just thought it best to 
warn people....

Hey gang-

Sorry I won't be able to make it. Yup, I'm here in NY. I've been
internning at an NGO that does work pushing the International Criminal
Court (www.amicc.org). This summer I'll be doing some work at Amnesty
International and also travelling. 

Best wishes to the whole old-school crew, and hello to the heads on
this thread. I miss you all.

Yes, it is horrible.  It has really gotten me thinking... war is hell.

Yes, the terrorists pretty much started the bloodshed on 9/11.

America responded with overwhemling bloodshed.

Now, they will return it in kind.

The madness will never end.  Its really up to us, the better nation, not
to respond to bloodshed with more bloodshed.  Becuase really, it just
will not ever end.  Not until one side can get control of their primal,
animal instinct of eye-for-an-eye and come to an solution that does not
rely on more bloodshed.

The war-hawks cry "We must not stop until every one of the evildoers are
dead!"

Guess what?  They are thinking the same thing. 

War is hell.

Yeah and it's the sensationalized coverage that gets emotions running hot
here. It's the appeal to emotion. When I first saw it I had to wonder if it
was all just fabricated Wag-The-Dog style. Now wouldn't that be a hoot if
the whole thing was a fake and done by our own guvment just to get the
country riled up in support of the war effort? Well, perhaps it would be
more uttery disgusting that we would stoop so low. I should say I'm pretty
sure that this isn't a fake, but that 1% in my mind makes me wonder...

hey all

heres some more good reading. I like the reporters thought processes =
thru the report, particularly how they mention things like how the =
doctors are too quickly Dx'ing the patients with what they already know, =
and are in a way refusing to seek new theories and ideas.

heres the reno gazette articles, I had to search for them. . .

very interesting.

Well you have to know what you're getting yourself into if you download a
video about a hostage getting decapitated! I expected to see a head cut off
and hear screaming. I also expected a lot more blood and gore but it wasn't
there. Damn Hollywood! Honestly the act of beheading someone is disturbing
and oddly fascinating. It's something you hear about but never see. For
those that can stomach it I think it's good to see just how animalistic the
human race can be.

I have a simple response (I already wrote a mega reply, and decided to
not send it, cause it's obnoxious).

I think the world would be a better place if heads of state had to lead
the charge on the battlefield.  We have too many wars without enough
conviction.  Bush's actions the day of 9/11, his National Guard record and
his later tasteless capitalizing on one of the darkest days in our history
said all I have to know about his character.

I fucking hate chickenhawks.

Yes, I made the mistake of watching it and I couldn't get the image of the 
poor guy's face out of my mind.  Take the advice and avoid this footage.

well,
I just watched it my self... im thankful that my media player at work is 
pretty bad... even watching it the way that i did, not making out exactly 
details and with the sound turned off, i am left speechless.
I have opinions and what i saw surely disturbs me but i am not sure how i 
feel about the actions that were taken.
Not too long ago british and american troops tortured and humiliated iraqi 
prisoners, and what about the vietnam war and the never ending torture and 
rape.
Im not saying that this people have the right to do what they did... but 
american soldiers and leaders have done this and worst over and over.
In short... im disgusted but it doesn't surprise me that such actions are 
taking place.
And if u think that this is a isolate episode... then u are blessed by ur 
ignorance!

susie.

Subject: [sfraves] BSP: Yet a couple more tracks from the hardest working producer around!

OSTEEN!

http://www.tussinspace.com/news.htm

"Pastoral" - As in a sheperd's song for the love of the land. Perfect =
for a Sunday morning sun-rise.

Date: 2004

Style: Progressive Trance

Info: An "up" song. Innovative and tweaked out, this is another example =
of Osteen's psy-progressive trance sound. Mixing elements of psy-trance =
tweaking, progressive bass and structure, and full on melodic trance =
arps and chords into an uplifting trippy experience.



"Unity Gain" - Dark, delayed out, but it will make you move.

Date: 2004

Style: Progressive House

Info: A dark sounding song. A voice rips through the thick bass, done in =
a loose James Holden style. The off centered keyboard pads are the =
epitomy of the uneasy feeling this song leaves you with.

Thanks for any reviews/comments!

     Just like it's important not to feel more disturbed when a black or 
white person is killed. It's just as important to not be more disturbed when it's 
an American or Iraqi who is killed. Granted being beheaded on film is way more 
shameful and humiliating than die-ing in battle, but what do you expect an 
enemy to do when we have killed 10's of thousands of their people in battle and 
they were only able to capture one of ours? Do you think they are gonna call 
Dr. Kovorkian and pay thousands of dollars to give him a nice peaceful death? 
Are they gonna buy dinner for him and give him a lil room to stay in till he 
gets rescued? Of course not, these recent events, as disturbing as they are do 
not surprize me. 
     I'm equally disturbed when I read the newspaper heading, and in big 
letters it says 12 AMERICAN'S KILLED IN OUR MOST DEADLYEST MONTH IN IRAQ! and then 
in small letters, later on you read aproximately 2,000 or so iraqi renegades 
were also killed. Now don't get me wrong here getting beheaded really sux, I 
can hardly imagine, and I don't really crave to see the video... BUT on the 
bright side, it is quite instant is it not? It would be hard to chose dieing in 
the dessert heat from multiple gun shot wounds or having  your limbs blown off 
with a hand granade as the prefered alnertative way to go... Is it really that 
hard to imagine that these thousands of Iraqi soldiers are only following 
orders just as ours are? Are they not just as inocent? Just as brave? Would our 
soldiers even be considered brave if all their soldiers just rolled over and 
never attacked back? 
          It's disturbing to know that our president probably won the 
election through a huge amount of religous voters, and yet when push comes to shove 
he pretends like he's never even heard of half the ten commandments... thou 
shalt not kill, thou shalt not covet thigh nieghbor's goods, thou shalt not use 
god's name in vain... etc. I mean when you look them up in the bible they don't 
have a little asterix next to them where it says *except in certain cases 
when you're really mad about two buildings falling down...   then go right ahead &
 proceed to start a god damn holly war biotch!* I don't recall seeing that 
written anywhere in the scriptures.
      A war, and much worse a war in god's name "good vs. evil" is clearly 
sacreligious by the most basic priciples of almost every religion. If we can't 
suffer wrong doing and turn the other cheek, we might as well be evil ourselves 
in the eyes of those on the outside, and therefore expect to be punished as 
such whenever vulnerable. I mean if our intentions for war are atheist, or 
agnostic and purly of logical motavation that's another story, but don't go 
throwing around religious motives to defeat an enimy and then cry about it later 
when they don't play fair or when you don't get unanimous support from the more 
sensible allies. 

p.s. appologies for ranting about such an edgy topic as religion, but to me 
that's exactly what this war is all about, and that's exactly why we can't be 
clear cut right & wrong. It all just simply has to end, even if that means 
admiting to a mistake. Think like the enimy... what does an Iraqi renegade believe 
in? What does al queda believe in? Attack the root, attack the epitomy, 
debate, evolve, compromise. Don't murder the outer shells of the innocent. (I don't 
know exactly who i'm telling this to, I'm just saying this stuff in general, 
and i think i'm right about it...)

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR: American Hostage Execution

	I like the idea of heads of state having to lead the charge on the 
battlefield. If such a concept had been in effect, it might have 
rendered the war in Iraq unnecessary -- Saddam Hussein would already be 
dead from leading the charge against Iran or Kuwait (the two countries 
he went to war with).

	Of course the odds of leaders going for this are just about zero. But 
there is a more practical policy change that could have a similar 
effect: When a situation arises where it seems like removing the rulers 
of a country will save lives but they won't go peacefully, instead of 
launching a war that claims the lives of many innocent civilians and 
ordinary luckless soldiers, just keep sending in highly paid, highly 
skilled hit teams or undercover assassins to go after the leadership 
(in this case Saddam and his cronies) until they take them out. If the 
people who take their place turn out to be bad apples too, keep taking 
them out until there's a decent government in power that respects human 
rights.

	I believe this way of "making it personal" would encourage retaliation 
in kind so that instead of ordinary Americans like those who died on 
Sept. 11, 2001  being at risk, dictators and tyrants would go 
tit-for-tat by targeting George Bush, Donald Rumsfeld, Hilary Clinton, 
and the rest of the gang on Capitol Hill. I could live with that.

Power to the people!

I agree with your basic premise, but I'm curious: why lump Hilary
Clinton in with George Bush and Donald Rumsfeld, as if she were a likely
target for Islamic fundamentalists? Or are you just saying that you wish
somebody would assassinate her? ;)

Hehehehehhehehehehe..  I want to go back to the archives and find all
of the posts where people replied to installments of Geri's story like
this:

"Yeah, and then the baby was killed by a flesh-eating marmoset!  And a
neuclear bomb cleaned up the mess!!"

This is turning into a phenomenon, man..  :)  ..but wait, what if
Geri's course was actually swayed by one of these posts?  Wouldn't that
be kind of like travelling backwards in time and mistakenly stepping on
a bug, and changing people's hair in the future into wheatgrass through
some tragic twist of evolution?

For me, this latest story kind of makes me sit back and imagine little
yellow ducklings and blue stars floating across my field of vision. 
Very soothing. ;)

Subject: [sfraves] SRR: SH*TLOAD OF HOUSE RECORDS FOR SALE!!!!

Ok - since PayPal and Bank Of America hosed me hardcore today, I need $$ 
like crazy as I'm taking my car into the shop this weekend and need all the 
$$ I can get.

So tonight I will release a list of well over 90 house 12"s for sale. If 
anyone is interested, I will be taking offers and setting up appointments 
for people to come listen/pick through what I have for sale.

I have stuff dating back a few years, labels like Red Melon, Moody, NRK, 
Tango, Siesta, etc. It's mainly deep house, tech-house, and some funky and 
loungey stuff. Everything from the SF sound to Chicago, to UK deep/funky 
styles. There are some 2x12"s & 3x12"s , some harder to finds, etc. I'll 
pretty much keep everything to Amoeba bargain bin type prices with very few 
exceptions  - and if someone wants to buy the whole shebang I'll drop it a 
smidge lower (I can't go TOO much lower than $2 a record due to neccessity).

Anyway - thought I'd give peopel a heads up now in case they wanted to 
pre-arrange something. I live in the east bay (El Cerrito area) and will be 
home from work around 4:30pm.

Ez.

Subject: [sfraves] SRR: Sample this

Listening to local DJ and producer mixes, an idea popped in my head. I
have many CDS from local artists, but no compilation / mix CD of several
artists. I am interested in producing such a CD to give exposure to the
many local artists who may or may not have the production resources at
their finger tips. Anyone here interested in submitting their work for
consideration? If successful, many genres of music will be represented,
and several other compilations will follow. This idea is in the alpha
stage @ the moment, and definitely open to input. Please email
suggestions, creative ideas, wishes, samples, thoughts and constructive
concern to: karina@hyperreal.org

hey all, here is the dealy deal,   a free shindig at the Sublounge (20th and 
3rd st) in china basinin SF 2$ tecates, 3$ wells
Tongiht will be the final party we do here at the sublounge too.  Thank you 
all who have come out and supported what we weren't even sure what we were 
doing to begin with :P  The AuraSf kids will still be up on their even on 
the same night so be sure to check out the sick grooves that they all put 
together for they have been great kids to play with, thanksguys!

okay, the event, VIBERATION
www.viberation.com
I would not be involved in the scene if it weren't for these guys, so that 
is why I wanted to dedicate this night to them.  If you all have just 
started partying, you should really take a look at the roots of the SF 
underground scene.  Viberation was a group of wonderful, amazing kids, 
friends and dj's who really knew how to play.  That is why I love them.  
There was a cafe in santa clara off of Stevens Crk and Lawrence xpwy called 
City Espresso (City E) Where I was the local barrista which had clientelle 
of folks such as Shane (CODE-when he was a computer guy before the djing), 
Greg Sandler, AndyW, Alex, Mike McGursky, Terry, Paula, Matt Schmidt, Vlad, 
AndyW Li, Micron Pyro, ...the whole gang, very great people.  It is too bad 
that they do not play together all that much anymore, The last party I 
really remember was at the Brookdale Lodge in the  SC mountains, a halloween 
party...off the hook. but tonight a good chunk of them will be playing for 
you, for free.

Calamity jane8-9
Lick the Micron 9-11
Li Sasaki 11-12:30
AndyW 12:30-close
here is the tease:
starting out we have our very own Calamity Jane to butter up Micron and Dan 
gorlick who will be tagging some sweet progressive Lick the Micron-typ-a 
tunes, from there we have Li Sasaki who is going to fuck with our heads in 
the way he did recently at Primero de Mayo, after Li, his twin brother, 
AndyW will be rocking us out to finish up the night and to give us something 
really good to dream about (no, not that you big pervert)
Apparently Noah is living outta state as well as Alex (siphon and Science) 
so they could not make it.  Maybe down the road.
Hopefully we will see you all there TONIGHT, may 13th
Peace,
Danny retired- bAByHueY

I'll have a few copies of my new CD "50/50" to hand out.  Hit me up if you are
interested.  If you don't like the music, then at least you can appreciate the
killer artwork Veanne did for me.

I'm pretty psyched for tonight.  Hope to see you there!

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR: American Hostage Execution

did anyone see on the news last night, when they showed part of the
interview with that chick that was in most of the iraqi torture pics ?

she said they didn't think it was wrong because they were ordered to do it.
There were also allegations of her having sex with guards and she was
denying them.

then they mentioned she is now pregnant from one of the guards. . .

stupid lil B****

I also saw a piece on a group of people (were they called like the blue
ribbon something or other?), and one group was trying to get all the photos
out immediately for viewing, cuz they'll eventually come out anyways, and
another group was trying to keep them all secret. . .
Interesting thought. .. what do you guys think, should the pics be public,
or should they be locked away somewhere ?

dude, they're all just sad sad people. . .

Damn, I've got a heavy music production date tonight, otherwise I'd be
ALL OVER this...  Maybe I'll come really late.  Anyway, if I don't see
y'all, *big raver hugs* and have a wonderful time.

Cheers,

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR: American Hostage Execution

I saw that the guards received their training from some "civilian" 
intellegence experts, and that the white house was refusing to release the 
names of those individuals for questioning.  Why civillian intelligence 
analsyst were brought in to teach the military is beyond me.. what did they 
really expect??

did anyone see on the news last night, when they showed part of the
interview with that chick that was in most of the iraqi torture pics ?

she said they didn't think it was wrong because they were ordered to do it.
There were also allegations of her having sex with guards and she was
denying them.

then they mentioned she is now pregnant from one of the guards. . .

stupid lil B****

I also saw a piece on a group of people (were they called like the blue
ribbon something or other?), and one group was trying to get all the photos
out immediately for viewing, cuz they'll eventually come out anyways, and
another group was trying to keep them all secret. . .
Interesting thought. .. what do you guys think, should the pics be public,
or should they be locked away somewhere ?

dude, they're all just sad sad people. . .

Oh c'mon, the poor girl is just into really dirty sex.  I am sure
the male guards didn't mind having someone around like that in
iraq.  They probalby thought she was a gift from god.

We should have never gotten rid of Clinton. Ya he was getting blowjobs from
interns, but we didn't have these war problems then. He was bombing Iraq on
a monthly basis for target practice and sending a message to Saddam. He
bombed the shit out of Sudan and Afghanistan because of Bin Laden. He did a
lot to protect America without making it a big bloodshed war.

Quote:
"Terrorists must have no doubt that in the face of their threat, America
will protect its citizens." -- Bill Clinton

He left it at just that. Notice how AFTER Clinton is gone all this bullshit
starts up again, which was started with who??? His father! Oh blah, I'm not
going to start going on about how I think bush has other motives for being
in Iraq......  Bill Clinton rocked, botton line. He protected us without
bloodshed. Fuck bush.

If you don't believe me about bill clinton bombing the shit out of Iraq and
Sudan and Afghanistan here are some links:

I am civillian and I was brought in to teach the military. I was also
brought in to expand on there new network (NMCI). Appartently with the
millions of people in the military nobody had the skills I have... Strange
eh? It's really not hard to lay wires and setup secure wireless networks.
Splice cat-5 cables and setup new dell desktops and transfer fucking data.
Wow, hard work. I got paid real good though...
It really was amazing how dumb these soldiers were that used computers, they
couldn't even manage to send emails. Let me tell you though, 90% of the
computers there had GIGS of porn on them. Not only porn, but SICK PORN. RAPE

Since you all are nifty Bay Area natives....

Does anyone from here rememeber the punk band SCHLONG? They were 
ex-member(s) of Operation Ivy. Three lovely chaps by the names of Gavin, Pat 
& Dave (Pat & Dave Mello to be exact).

I used to chill with them when they would tour out east, and when they came 
to Colorado (whilst I lived there), and I would love to get in contact with 
them again.

If by some slim chance anyone knows these guys, or if they're in a new band 
I can go check out or some shit - please hit me back with info!!!

Thanks,

Russia Enacts Sweeping Reforms in Drug Laws: No Jail for Possession
  5/14/04

DRCNet reported in March that Russia was on the verge of making dramatic 
reforms to its draconian drug laws after the Duma passed legislation that 
would remove criminal penalties and the possibility of jail time for simple 
drug possession. But then the wheels flew off the whole process as drug 
warriors within the Russian government attempted to turn the reform on its 
head by defining the quantities of each drug that would constitute 
possession for personal use at levels so low as to render the reforms 
meaningless, or worse. (Visit 
<http://stopthedrugwar.org/chronicle/328/russia.shtml>http://stopthedrugwar.org/chronicle/328/russia.shtml 
and 
<http://stopthedrugwar.org/chronicle/329/russialaw.shtml>http://stopthedrugwar.org/chronicle/329/russialaw.shtml 
for our earlier coverage.)

Now the drug warriors have been fought off, and reformers have managed to 
get quantities set at levels that will keep hundreds of thousands of 
Russian drug users out of prison. Under the old law, possession of even a 
single marijuana cigarette could garner a three-year prison sentence. 
According to Russian authorities, somewhere between 200,000 and 300,000 
people are currently serving time for drug offenses.

Under the new law -- actually an amendment to the Criminal Code -- which 
went into effect Wednesday, people possessing no more than 10 times the 
"average single dose" will no longer be charged with a crime, but an 
"administrative infraction." Possession of between 10 and 50 times the 
"average single dose" is punishable by a larger fine and community service, 
but again, no jail or prison time. Small-scale dealers will find themselves 
protected against drug trafficking charges by this second provision -- 
unless they get caught in the act of selling. Punishment for drug sales is 
increased under the new law.

Here are the critical quantity levels determined by the Russian government 
in consultation with drug reform groups such as the Russian Harm Reduction 
Network and the NAN Foundation. These are the quantities that represent ten 
times the "average single dose," up to which no one can be arrested or 
criminally charged:
heroin, 1.0 grams
cocaine, 1.5 grams
marijuana, 20.0 grams (dried)
hashish, 5.0 grams
ecstasy, 0.5 grams
methamphetamine, 0.5 grams
mescaline, 0.5 grams
LSD, 0.003 grams
psilocybin, 0.005 grams

The Russian equivalent of the DEA, the Federal Drug Control Service, wanted 
much lower levels, Vitaly Djuma, head of the Russian Harm Reduction 
Network, told DRCNet while the levels were being decided. "The agency 
responsible for setting new doses is the Ministry of Health," said Djuma, 
"but using its status as a state security agency, the Federal Drug Control 
Service (FDCS) tried to push through its own determinations where, for 
example, a single dose of heroin was 0.0001 gram, thus turning all drug 
users once again into 'drug dealers.' This could not only nullify the 
humanizing of legislation by the Russian administration but also directly 
threaten the safety -- and lives -- of millions of Russians who use drugs."

Under the quantities proposed by the FDCS, the "average single dose" of 
marijuana would be 0.0015 grams. With a standard joint weighing in at about 
one gram, possession of a single joint would make the possessor subject to 
penalties for drug dealing because one gram exceeds 50 doses (0.75 grams) 
by the FDCS standard. Similarly absurd low "average single doses" were set 
for other drugs as well.

But all that has been undone, and the FDCS is not happy. "Now drug addicts 
have the right to run around with their pockets full of marijuana, and we 
can't even detain them," FDCS deputy chief Alexander Mikhailov complained 
to the newspaper Kommersant Thursday. "The heroin dose is normal for a 
chronic drug user, but for a regular person it's nonetheless a dose of 
potassium cyanide. We were categorically against it, but the Justice 
Ministry simply went crazy chasing its European standards."

An FDCS spokesman was more diplomatic. "It's the law, and we are required 
to abide by it and enforce it," he told the Moscow Times Thursday.

Drug reformers welcomed the law and the new, improved "average single dose" 
levels. "This is a brave, humane law," said Lev Levinson, head of New Drug 
Policies, and one of the people who helped set the new quantities. "Now 
that police will stop persecuting users, they can start focusing on real 
threats like large-scale drug trafficking," he told the Times.

Now, if the Russians can only reign in the drug warriors. They were busy 
repressing the Moscow Million Marijuana March last weekend (see newsbrief 
this issue).

Um hmmmmmm! I'll see if I can get to that.

friends are just now hitting the age when I started raving,
11 years ago.

hello, this is a continuation of a fictional piece:
 
ig wanted to charge ten dollars each for the cultish eggs, but then decided that money is really everything that anyone wants or needs it to be...ig thought a long, long time about how it means all sorts of ethical things, and how only certain types of people should have certain kinds of money in certain kinds of accounts and how it should be transfered all over the place to the select places that are the right places according to the rules. only certain people know the rules, and if they are not followed, well, then there'd be no eggs at all or chickens. ooops, there's that darned chicken again. ig wished for womanhood and then for manhood. ten dollars just wouldn't be enough. hell, in the seventies, maybe ten dollars would have meant something, but ig wasn't even around yet, so the point was mute. :)

And this is what I got:  "You're a Spirograph!! You're pretty tripped out, 
even though you've been known to be a bit boring at times. You manage to 
serve your purpose in life while expending hardly any effort (and are 
probably stoned to the gills all the while)."

Subject: [sfraves] Looking for New York Lists

Hi All,
    I'm going to New York in a week for a week long visit, and have been 
trying, without much success, to find some local message boards or 
mailing lists. The NYRaves page off of Hyperreal has events and a 
calendar, but no mailing list. Does anyone know where I can look for 
things rave related, especially if they are Jungle/DnB related?

Thanks for your help!

Happy

Wow!
 
I'm amazed at how varied everyone is. I wonder if they just randomly pick something different for each person. Or more likely, we are that special and uniquely different. Two of my off list friends were a Garbage Pail Kid and a Rubik's Cube. 
 
Speak and Spell's aren't lame! They are great for sampling. :-D

Subject: Re: [sfraves] (NRR) Which 80s Toy Are You?

You're Rubik's Cube!! You may think you're popular, but you're actually
extremely annoying. Seriously.

pshhhh. . .

was rubiks cube an 80's toy or a 70's toy. . . I was expecting GoBots or
barbie's swimming pool (with the lil shower, yeah I had one) or something. .
.maybe one of those spinny things with the wheel in the center that you sat
on and spun around on. . .


the question with what I do in my spare time didn't give me enuf options so
I had to pick "make pretty things". . . it was between that and "smoke
everything i could find and spin around till i fall over" (or whatever), I'm
a lil more productive than that usually. . .
that's prolly what screwed me. . .

at least I wasn't a weeble. . .

Subject: [sfraves] Pics to studio for sale!!

I have gotten alot of responses for individual pieces of gear... but I would 
still like to sell it as one lot to that soon to be producer since it is 
more benifecial to them to get the complete package.

Here is a link to the pics. The only thing missing is the virus which is 
buried in one of the boxes in storage that I could not find at the time. 
Also I took a decent picture of one of the only major scuffs that I could 
see, which is on the Juno

Once again im asking 3k for the whole thing

Subject: [sfraves] NRR: A rantish post about courtesy and respect for your host.

The following is basically a cut & paste of a rather long and rantish 
post I just dropped onto a thread over at bluelight.  Writing it, I got 
offtopic, and really started thinking about how much I WILL be 
OBLIGATED to adapt, change my ingrown ways, and give, to my hosts, that 
all-important part of plur: RESPECT.

The situation that lead to the bluelight thread:  1) Fancy-schmancy 
restaurant in Australia has a fancy-schmancy dress code.  2) Guy is 
denied service because he refuses to follow dress code (which applies 
to everybody, regardless of race, colour, or creed).  3) Guy decides 
that it is against his religion to follow dress code, and files 
complaint with government, claiming his human rights were violated.  4) 
Internet outrage ensues.  5) Someone mentions Japan, and I start to 
give a LOT more thought to what is going to be necessary to adapt to a 
living in a culture in which I was not raised.

So without further ado, John's rant about guests showing respect for 
their hosts:



It's funny that someone brought up Japanese culture, politeness, and 
respect; because it allows for a very easy demolition of all arguments 
against the restaurant.

Originally posted by -Thoth
 > Expecting otherwise is like being refused from a japanese restaraunt 
for wearing a
 > suit (sorry, it's rude! Kimonos only!)

As an american who is actually planning/hoping/preparing to move to 
Japan in about a year or so, I'd have absolutely no problem with this. 
If, on the other hand, I was denied service because I'm not Japanese, 
THEN I'd have some issues. See the difference? One is simple 
enforcement of a dress code, the other is discrimination.

But a FAR more apt example (since you brought Japanese culture into 
this) is not the kimono, it is the tradition that when you are entering 
a Japanese household, a nicer restaurant, or even some of the top-end 
Japanese restaurants here in the US, that you remove your shoes at the 
foyer. As a westerner, that is not my tradition. I'm not used to doing 
so, nor do I even usually think of doing it here. In fact, in many 
western households it is considered RUDE to remove your shoes at 
someone else's house, until you have passed a certain level of 
familiarity.

But if I make the move to Japan happen, when I am a guest in someone 
else's country, a guest in someone else's home, even a guest in someone 
else's restaurant; even though it is not MY tradition, do you think I 
will be taking my shoes off when I visit a Japanese home, or a 
restaurant nice enough that decorum requires it? You can bet your ass I 
will. It is the respectful and polite thing to do. And for me to do 
otherwise, for me to arrogantly and contemptuously disregard the 
culture that is playing host to me, would be inconceivably and 
unforgivably... well.... rude.

In a culture that places such a high emphasis on politeness and respect 
as Japan, I would probably always seem at least a bit uncouth. But that 
won't be for lack of trying.

Likewise, even though Japan has an educational system far superior to 
our own, and you can count on your average Japanese knowing some 
english (or at least, far more english than your average american knows 
Japanese); I will NOT be expecting to communicate in english when I get 
there. As a guest in their country, I fully expect to, and to have to, 
learn Japanese. In fact, I'm starting classes soon to get a head start 
in that regard.

A year or so ago, I was a (very) strict vegetarian. But in order to 
fully experience the culture, as so as not to take the chance of 
insulting anyone by turning my nose up at any dish I might be offered, 
I have already returned seafood to my diet (starting with sushi, of 
course). I've decided that, this being the experience of my lifetime, I 
will not miss out on ANYTHING, simply because of a silly dietary choice 
I made when I was a teenager. Suffice it to say, fugu is on the top of 
my list of "things to try" when I get there.

And I have been practically devouring books, websites, anything that 
might give me just a little bit more of an insight into the culture. 
Tops have been ones like "Culture Shock: Japan", and others that detail 
the more subtle differences that are not so obvious, but important if 
you want to be courteous and respectful of your hosts. No doubt, I'll 
make plenty of blunders. But I WILL be trying my very best to respect 
the culture that will so generously be my host.

*I* will adapt. As a guest, I will NOT expect or demand that my hosts 
change THEIR traditions and culture to service ME. To do otherwise 
would be so incredibly selfish, presumptuous, and flat out arrogant, 
that I just can't fathom myself being so obnoxiously disrespectful. 
Apparently, some people can, and do more than fathom themselves as that 
sort. And that's a shame.

I guess this entire thread would be moot, if only more people 
remembered an old saying. In fact, MY entire post could be summed up in 
the same saying. It starts out: "When in Rome...".


cya,
john

The answer is never the answer. What's really interesting is the mystery.
If you seek the mystery instead of the answer, you'll always be seeking.
I've never seen anybody really find the answer -- they think they have, so
they stop looking. But the job is to seek mystery, evoke mystery, plant a
garden in which strange plants grow and mysteries bloom. The need for
mystery is greater than the need for an answer. - Ken Kesey

> WHO: DJ/Producers Garth and Jen=F6
>
> WHAT: Starting Sunday May 16th, the legendary Wicked party DJs and
> promoters
> explore their more eclectic tastes with Echo Beach at Bambuddha Lounge.
> "We've always been known for throwing in some old disco, funk, new wave,
> dubby trippiness or other unorthodox musical inspiration while we spin,"
> Jen=F6 says. "This party is an opportunity to pursue those other
> possibilities
> with more fervor as we will be expressing ourselves outside the accepted
> and
> usually quite safe musical formats of the current SF club scene."
> Pulling from their extensive collections of underground disco, soul, jazz
> and r&b, adding a bit of rock and reggae, this duo brings the funk San
> Francisco so desperately needs. More chilled than chaotic, the focus is
> hanging with old friends around the Phoenix Hotel's muraled pool, enjoyin=
g
> a
> Southeast Asian BBQ. Don1t arrive expecting the former space's infamous W=
et
> parties - although the tunes will be the most soul-soothing musical
> backdrop
> on a lazy Sunday, the music won't be beaten over your head.
> "We don't really have a musical policy as such, as pretty much anything
> goes,2 says Jen=F6.=A0 3Personally, I'm definitely looking to challenge m=
yself,
> expand my repertoire and take some risks musically."

I gotta plug this event.

130 models!
23 designers!

I was at the space today, and it's fabulous. CFDC shows have
all been fantastic productions... and I highly recommend it.

Think burning man freak being expressive. :)

The Bush administration yesterday proposed overhauling the way it conducts 
drug testing of more than 400,000 federal employees who hold sensitive 
positions. The invasive proposal is particularly harmful because it is 
expected to become the model for how private employers test prospective and 
current employees.

The <http://samhsa.gov/hottopics/click_drugtesting.html>proposed guidelines 
would allow the government to test employees' hair, sweat, and saliva for 
the presence of illegal drugs. The government says these tests are more 
accurate than urine testing. The irony of this claim is not lost on critics 
of drug testing, who point out that the Bush administration is pointing to 
the failures of federal urine testing while also launching a $23 million 
campaign to push drug testing of kids' urine in the nation's schools.

Critics, including the Drug Policy Alliance, have long argued that drug 
testing is an unconstitutional invasion of privacy. Though billed as a 
kinder, gentler means of testing than urine collection, hair, sweat, and 
saliva tests are no less problematic and are prone to similar failures 
because they can produce a false positive or be fooled by products already 
on the market designed to beat the tests. For instance:
    * Saliva tests can only detect drugs used within the last three days. A 
host of products claim to be able to help drug users beat the test.
    * Detoxification shampoos currently on the market claim to be able to 
rid hair follicles of the presence of drugs.
    * Sweat tests can register a false positive on someone who has been in 
a room where marijuana was being smoked.
The Multi Drug Saliva Test is a drug testing device that detects six drugs 
of abuse:
    * Marijuana (THC)
    * Cocaine (COC)
    * Opiates (OPI)
    * Amphetamine (AMP)
    * Methamphetamine (mAMP)
    * Phencyclidine (PCP)

The test uses the preferred lateral flow immunoassay technology for test 
screening and requires no special training. The qualitative yes/no test 
results are visibly obtained within several minutes.

And, there are a number of products out there that claim to beat the test:

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR: American Hostage Execution

	I mostly mentioned Hilary as a prominent Washington D.C. Democrat. The 
Islamic fundamentalists behind various terrorist incidents including 
the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon don't seem to be 
making fine distinctions about American politics. Even if they were, 
Hilary Clinton might still be on their hit list. She was of course 
First Lady in the Clinton administration, which pursued many of the 
same policies as the Bush administration.

	In her own political career running for office and as a Senator, 
Hilary  has been supportive of Israel herself (perhaps more out of 
pandering to the Jewish vote in New York than from any personal 
conviction), voted for and still supports the war in Iraq, and has even 
called the U.S. volunteer military "inadequate," indicating she 
supports a draft.

	From an April 21 CNN story (see 
http://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/04/21/iraq.hillary/):

"To the disappointment of some antiwar liberals in her Democratic base, 
Clinton, the former first lady, voted in favor of the Iraq war 
resolution in October 2002.

'Obviously, I've thought about that a lot in the months since," she 
said. "No, I don't regret giving the president authority because at the 
time it was in the context of weapons of mass destruction, grave 
threats to the United States, and clearly, Saddam Hussein had been a 
real problem for the international community for more than a decade.'"

	I mostly agree with that statement, but that's beside the point. Even 
though I think she and her husband deserve to go to jail for a long 
time for many reasons including probable involvement in mafia-style 
murders (see for example http://www.prorev.com/WWDEATH.HTM), the 
assassination of Hilary Clinton would not solve anything and I don't 
have any particular desire to see her dead.

okay..um OFF THE FUCKING HOOK!  it has been a looooong time since I have 
been to a party that was sooo sweet.  This was one where you could not 
decide which room to be in!  The music was just amazing wherever you went, 
although I was happier with all the dj's other thatn Freq-Nasty, he was 
still good.  If I were his mom, I would really want to cut his hair.  So 
anyways, Spacecowboys were off the fuckin rockers....fun, groovin beats for 
a looong time, laird was very impressive as well.   I t was  a nice party, 
not tooo many SFR kids that I knew other than BAM and Aaron, as well as 
Leslie, but it was still good times!  It has been a while since I have been 
out to a party and I now realize how much I miss them.

great info apollo thanks

I picked up this "Fixx" swish n spit mouthwash stuff thats supposed to =
work. . .
I guess if the saliva test only covers recent exposure (3 days) than I =
prolly don't need it, but good to be safe just in case.

I've failed tests and lost prospective jobs like 3-4x. . .and medical =
use isn't a real excuse to them. I was told once that if I could prove I =
had a marinol Rx that they might let it slide. . .

that kinda sucks, so people using cannabis for medical reasons are just =
out of luck. I wonder if the employment world will ever support the =
medical use issue.

I hope the swab test is the saliva test and not the DNA test I've read =
about. Aparrently the dna test can show positive if you've evn just =
touched cannabis. . . prolly not tho, I'm sure thats much more expensive =
than the simple saliva test.

take care mann

  The Bush administration yesterday proposed overhauling the way it =
conducts drug testing of more than 400,000 federal employees who hold =
sensitive positions. The invasive proposal is particularly harmful =
because it is expected to become the model for how private employers =
test prospective and current employees.
  =20
  The proposed guidelines would allow the government to test employees' =
hair, sweat, and saliva for the presence of illegal drugs. The =
government says these tests are more accurate than urine testing. The =
irony of this claim is not lost on critics of drug testing, who point =
out that the Bush administration is pointing to the failures of federal =
urine testing while also launching a $23 million campaign to push drug =
testing of kids' urine in the nation's schools.
  =20
  Critics, including the Drug Policy Alliance, have long argued that =
drug testing is an unconstitutional invasion of privacy. Though billed =
as a kinder, gentler means of testing than urine collection, hair, =
sweat, and saliva tests are no less problematic and are prone to similar =
failures because they can produce a false positive or be fooled by =
products already on the market designed to beat the tests. For instance: =

    a.. Saliva tests can only detect drugs used within the last three =
days. A host of products claim to be able to help drug users beat the =
test.=20
    b.. Detoxification shampoos currently on the market claim to be able =
to rid hair follicles of the presence of drugs.=20
    c.. Sweat tests can register a false positive on someone who has =
been in a room where marijuana was being smoked.=20
  The Multi Drug Saliva Test is a drug testing device that detects six =
drugs of abuse:=20
    a.. Marijuana (THC)=20
    b.. Cocaine (COC)=20
    c.. Opiates (OPI)=20
    d.. Amphetamine (AMP)=20
    e.. Methamphetamine (mAMP)=20
    f.. Phencyclidine (PCP)=20

  The test uses the preferred lateral flow immunoassay technology for =
test screening and requires no special training. The qualitative yes/no =
test results are visibly obtained within several minutes.

  And, there are a number of products out there that claim to beat the =

<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Hmmm let's analyze the post...</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Swearing? Nope.</DIV>
<DIV>Graphic with mentions of violence or sexuality? Nope.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Yep, don't think that's vulgar. Perhaps you just got all upset at hi=

hat must be it.</DIV>

<DIV>If you are upset at that be upset (because it was the truth) but cer=

<DIV>&gt; &gt; did anyone see on the news last night, when they showed pa=
rt of the</DIV>
<DIV>&gt; &gt; interview with that chick that was in most of the iraqi to=
rture pics ?</DIV>
<DIV>&gt; &gt;</DIV>
<DIV>&gt; &gt; she said they didn't think it was wrong because they were =
ordered to do</DIV>
<DIV>&gt;it.</DIV>
<DIV>&gt; &gt; There were also allegations of her having sex with guards =
and she was</DIV>
<DIV>&gt; &gt; denying them.</DIV>
<DIV>&gt; &gt;</DIV>
<DIV>&gt; &gt; then they mentioned she is now pregnant from one of the gu=
ards. . .</DIV>
<DIV>&gt; &gt;</DIV>
<DIV>&gt; &gt; stupid lil B****</DIV>
<DIV>&gt; &gt;</DIV>
<DIV>&gt; &gt; I also saw a piece on a group of people (were they called =

<DIV>&gt;and</DIV>

<DIV>&gt; &gt; Interesting thought. .. what do you guys think, should the=

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR: American Hostage Execution

oh goddd

deal with it people. . .

you're all old enuf to know reality from non. . . and I'm sure you've all
heard those naughty words before. . .

hey one thought tho. .

if these terrorists somehow posted the decapitation on the internet. . .
what, do they have like an aol account or a earthlink account or something ?
Could I search aol's members and find "evil terrorists" ?

could the ip's and such be tracked back to the terrorists ? Do they have DSL
in Iraq ? Well I guess from idlez post, they do, or were going to anyways. .
.yknow if thats the case. . .who's supplying the terrorists with evil
internet access ? Wouldn't that be a near equivalent to supplying them with
guns ? It sounds like the iraqis are a lil more pc proficient than the us
military. . .

I have one friend in the army who emails me occasionally with her cell phone
number thats a 707 area code, but she's supposedly in hawaii or something
right now. . .

did anyone see the news last night where 4 more american soldiers were
killed, 2 in battle and 2 when they flipped their jeep (prolly racing or
something)? Funny/sad how these highly trained military personnel end up
dying cuz they can't drive safely. . .I wonder if they got medals ? And I
wonder what the letters to their parents stated ? Valiant death avoiding a
protected species of  desert tortoise ?
Damn sierra club. . .

"The welfare of the people in particular has always been the alibi of 
tyrants, and it provides the further advantage of giving the servants of 
tyranny a good conscience."
-Albert Camus

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the 
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become 
visible."
-Jacques Attali in his seminal text "Noise"

"I loved the focus in the early days of Wicked on the pagan aspects of 
life. The natural cycles of the full moons, being out in nature, on the 
beach, free, alive, unbridled, wild and spontaneous. There is no club,

15 Anomalies Surrounding
Death Of Nick Berg
What Really Happened.com
5-14-4

(Warning: Parts of the following discussion contain rather sickening 
references.)

Arab linguists have said the man posing as the Jordanian Zaraqawi did not 
speak with a Jordanian dialect. Others have suggested the man reading the 
written statement may not have been a native speaker of Arabic.

Zaraqawi was missing one leg and had been outfitted with an artificial leg 
that did not fit or function properly. He was unable to walk or stand 
normally with his ill-fitting limb. No man in the group showed evidence of 
such an infirmity.

Numerous indigenous sources have said Zaraqawi was killed by a US 
helicopter attack months ago when he was unable to move quickly enough to 
escape the targeted house. While others managed to exit the house in time 
to survive, he died in the collapsed building.

As any surgeon will testify, the alleged beheading was a fake. A beheading 
would result in a tremendous amount of spurting blood. There would have 
been blood everywhere had an actual beheading taken place. When the 
executioner holds up Berg's head immediately following what is represented 
as an actual decapitation of a living person, there is no significant blood 
flow from the neck or blood splatters showing anywhere on the executioner. 
Furthermore, the cut was simply too neat to have been done crudely and with 
such amazing speed by a man wielding a knife. Anybody who has ever carved a 
turkey knows there is something wrong with the supposed beheading. The 
suspended head looks more like Berg had been neatly beheaded by a guillotine.

The orange jumpsuit was standard US military issue to men in custody. It is 
unlikely Berg would have continuing wearing a US custodial uniform if he 
had been released by the military as they claim. The fact he was still 
wearing the suit is both anomalous and suggestive. One is forced to 
speculate as to whether there was an immediate transfer of Berg from the US 
military to unknown persons, thusly preventing Berg from discarding his US 
prison garb.

Several of the men in the film were fat by Iraqi standards. If they were 
Feyadeen or mujahadeen, they probably have been living underground since 
the first days of the occupation. Tens of thousands of Iraqis have been 
shown on news stories as they have marched and demonstrated. One would be 
hard pressed to point out a single fat man among these thousands.

Some men had what can only be described as pasty-white hands. Once again, 
one would be hard pressed to find Arab men with pasty-white hands.

The lack of spurting blood suggests Berg was already dead at the time of 
the alleged decapitation. It is possible Berg's dead body was displayed 
with his head already partially or totally severed. In any case, he almost 
certainly was killed before the staged beheading. If so, it suggests the 
captors had no stomach for an actual beheading of a living person, and they 
opted to fulfill their assignment quietly and with the least amount of gore.

The scream that is heard has been interpreted as a woman's scream by many 
viewers. Videotape cognoscenti have further said the scream was 
amateurishly added to the tape.

The U.S. government translation of one statement made on the film is: "Does 
al Qaeda need any further excuses?" This is a falsification. The actual 
statement urged fellow insurgents to get off their hind ends and do 
something. One assumes the translator being used by the US military is a 
native speaker of Arabic, so this cannot be explained as an innocent flub. 
This suggests the US government wanted to inject an alleged al- Qaeda group 
into the murder of Nick Berg.

Iraqis who have seen the videotape on Arabic news broadcasts are 
universally saying the men in the film are not Iraqis. Are they saying this 
partly because the speaker does not employ an Iraqi dialect? Where does 
their certainty come from?

Firearms experts have stated the AK-47 carried by one man was a "Gilal." 
This actually is an Israeli-made weapon that improves on the famous AK- 47. 
Feyadeen and other insurgents almost universally use AK-47s.

The man in the videotape who is purported to be Zarqawi is wearing a gold 
ring. This is absolutely proscribed by Islamic law.

The US military has stated that Berg was never in US custody and that he 
had been in custody of the Iraqi police. The Iraqi police adamantly deny he 
was ever in their custody. On April 1, an e-mail from Beth A. Payne, the 
U.S. consular officer in Iraq, was sent to the family of Nick Berg. It 
stated that Ms. Payne had located Nick, and he was currently in custody of 
the US military. We have to conclude that either the email was bogus or the 
US military has been lying.

The chair that Berg was seated in during the filming was a standard issue 
military chair of the exact same kind as seen in a color photo taken at the 
Abu Ghraib Prison. The chances a terrorist cell would be using this same 
chair are minimal at best.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] NRR: American Hostage Execution

I agree,

at first i didn't notice the guy moving much, but i watched it a couple more
times and saw him shrugging his shoulders and blinking. . .when they were
actually cutting his head off, his mouth opened and closed which could have
been from the cutting of the muscles/etc if he was already dead, but maybe
he was alive. . .if he was alive he was certainly not very active for a guy
getting his head cut off.

And the guy just had a reg old 8" or so knife. . .either he was really
really good at cutting off heads, or there was something fishy going on
there. I did notice blood (or a wet spot from something) on the floor, but
no spurting or dripping really at all that would show the guys heart was
still beating at the time his throat was cut. And wouldn't the killer have
to work a lil harder to cut thru the bones and such ?

 Maybe thats partially why it was on the internet and there wasn't any tape
found. . .internet connection issues and such made the video hard to see
clearly.

The times on the tape were interesting, you could see it jump from like
13something hours to around 2 while the guy was talking before the bad guys
speech. What else was recorded I wondered. . .it's obvious it was put
together in pieces tho.

the scream at the end suprised me. . .It didnt sound like a chick really,
and it didn't look at all like one of the captors screamed. . .you would
probably have noticed the guy taking a big breath or moving his mouth or
something. Plus, the scream sounded added on, like sounded clearer than the
rest of the sounds or from someone closer to the mic.

The way the guy read from the letter was odd to me. . .it didn't flow
properly like how someone would normally speak if they spoke and read any
language well. I don't know that language, but there were hardly any like
emphasized syllables, really monotone. Kind of looked like a school group
report to me.

And the way a couple of the guys were chilling with their guard totally
down. . .pulled their guns back, just stood there. . .I would think that
iraqi people would have all sorts of skin issues that would cause them to
itch occasionally, things from the desert atmosphere n such. But I didn't
see any there besides the guy wiping his nose or whatever he was doing.

plus it did look like they were all white guys. .. even the guy 2nd from the
right who kept touching his nose, you could see his face was white too.

And where do they buy their shoes ? It looked like the guy on the right had
on nike's or old airwalks, untied, which is odd cuz in a desert scenario
wouldn't he get lots of sand in his shoes ?. . .

One of the guys looked like he had an MP5 machine gun or something similar.
The other guy on the left seemed to try to cover up his gun.

hmmm. .. odd. . .

it's hard to tell with things like this, like who do you believe, either way
it could be the american government trying to cover their tracks. . .either
producing the video (I guess terrorists are good at editing and have the
tools for it lying around) or trying to cover up the video after it's
discovered.
Where do they plug the things in to charge the battery ? Do they use 120v
outlets in that country ?

aK

Subject: Re: [sfraves] 550 barneveld review kinda

yea I agree.  that was 550 better than I've ever rememebered it !
we came in really late, but knew the party was going off when we got
to the packed main room and saw a couple people swinging off harnesses
off the ceiling ?? wtf, crazyiness.  there seemed to be a ton of stage antics 
this time, sword swallowing, crazy guy in huge florescent daisy outfit,
and a ton of other funky shit that went down.

as for FreQ-Nasty, caught only the beginning of his set before venturing
elsewhere .... but when he dropped that first track in after that vocal
segue - man, the way the dancefloor exploded reminded me how much i missed
going to a packed party that just went off.

Danny, I think you're right on not too many SFR kids there.   The crowd
is definately older, burningman type crowd heavy.

For everyone else, if you havn't checked out Get Freaky @550 you're
missing what is proboboly the best club dance party experience SF
currently has to offer !!

THE GRAY ZONE
by SEYMOUR M. HERSH
How a secret Pentagon program came to Abu Ghraib.
Issue of 2004-05-24
Posted 2004-05-15
The New Yorker

The roots of the Abu Ghraib prison scandal lie not in the criminal 
inclinations of a few Army reservists but in a decision, approved last year 
by Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, to expand a highly secret 
operation, which had been focussed on the hunt for Al Qaeda, to the 
interrogation of prisoners in Iraq. Rumsfeld's decision embittered the 
American intelligence community, damaged the effectiveness of élite combat 
units, and hurt America's prospects in the war on terror.

"The welfare of the people in particular has always been the alibi of 
tyrants, and it provides the further advantage of giving the servants of 
tyranny a good conscience."
-Albert Camus

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the 
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become 
visible."
-Jacques Attali in his seminal text "Noise"

"I loved the focus in the early days of Wicked on the pagan aspects of 
life. The natural cycles of the full moons, being out in nature, on the 
beach, free, alive, unbridled, wild and spontaneous. There is no club, 
party or other sound system that has ever achieved anything close to that..."
-Jeno, on the early days of Wicked and the Full Moon Raves

Tony Hewitt (www.tangorecordings.com)
San Francisco (Tango / Nightshift / Detour)
There is no need for introduction here. Tony has been one of the staple
figures in the San Francisco scene for the last 10 years. Playing at all the
local events from The Gathering to Funky Techno Tribe. He tears up the floor
with his tough west coast house sound that we have all learned to love.
Check out Tony as he celebrates his latest release on Tango with the
"Company Three EP".

Jazz-e (www.jazz-e.com)
San Francisco (EMI / APG / Urbanloops)
With over 20 years experience Jazz-e began spinning at the ripe age of 9. He
blends a range of styles of house, vocal house, and techno. From funky
chunky to hard banging funk infused techno style beats with a touch of
breaks. He is a dj that knows how to motivate a crowd with uplifting music.
He has played all across the U.S. Canada, Mexico and the bay area, from
Spundae, Release, End-up, and many more. After a year of touring check him
out as he makes his first appearance in San Francisco in over a year.

Tim-e 
San Francisco (Universal Beat Co / KickDown)
Tim-E is a serious up and coming house dj from the bay area. He stands out
from the rest because of his versatility and his ability to read a crowd. He
does not just bring one sound to the decks like most dj's. He 
drops tracks that are funky, chunky, disco, tweaked out tribal, to your
deep, soulful, grooving house sounds. His ability to change styles and do it
well has caught the eyes of dj's and promoters alike.

I just moved to New York a few weeks ago and haven't found much yet
(granted, I haven't looked too hard). As for NYC Raves, go to the FAQ on
their site for mailing list info. Basically, use
nyc-raves-subscribe@hyperreal.org to subscribe. It's the same software
that's running sfraves, so all the same commands should work. The
nyc-raves list is pretty quiet though. There's not much stuff posted.

If you're interested in club nights (I don't think you'll find much else
in Manhattan itself), check out Camouflage at Guernica on Tuesday nights
(more info at http://www.camonyc.com/). They've got good DnB DJ's and a
great crowd (skip the main floor and go straight to the basement).
There's also DnB stuff going on other nights at various clubs. I don't
have the info handy, but let me know if you're interested and I'll dig
it up.

There's also a day rave happening on Saturday (5/22) with mostly techno
and hardcore. It looks promising :) Check out http://www.riotsound.com/
for more info on that.

Subject: RE: [sfraves] saturday review: Ruby Sky - Behrouz

I have now been to Ruby Sky three times but this last one was the best.  The 
doorpeople are hella nice, and no 1015 vibe or strip searches.. and the 
people are pretty nice that go there.

Behrouz has really not been my favorite DJ to go see, but that man spins 
with everyone, and it seems like he is getting better each time I see him.  
On 5/28 he is spinning with Deepdish, and last time I saw him was with 
Oakenfold two months ago.  This was however a special night bacuase I got a 
free ticket for this event from his girlfriend and we spent the entire 
evening up on stage in the comfy bed right in front of the tables - dope!  I 
love a good vibe, I so rarely get to envibe*~:) these days and so chose 
saturday night to just let loose.. with an amazing new firend we set out on 
a beautiful journey, dancing, frolicing amoungst the crowd, and finally 
settling into the comfy spot.. the next time I looked up.. everyone was gone 
and it was 5am.. crap.. what a great nite.  I hope to go again for 
deepdish.. and Tiesto is spinng 6/4.. that is a must see.

the security *is* real nice at ruby skye!  ironically, a couple
of them are ex-1015 security.  i think greg is the head of
security - he's always been nice.

i could do without the patrons, however.  and the high drink
prices.

gene farris this saturday, but i think i'm going to be at OG
raver night @ DNA.

Subject: [sfraves] N.R.R Photoshop question help!!!

ok all you graphics gurus out there I have a bit of a problem.

I have a user that is not very savvy with photoshop and hell I don't know 
much about the program myself, but here is what the problem is. When the 
user scans a document or fax etc.. They want to be able to change some of 
the text in some or all of the document. They use to be able to do this when 
I had them hooked up to a multi function large scale printer,copier,fax 
unit. But we had some network issues and I can't get the scan function to 
work properly. So the user got a flat bed scanner from frys and when they 
scan something and try and change several different areas of the document 
they can make the first change succussfully but when they get to a second 
change they get the error: Could not complete your request because the 
pixels in a type. Layer cannot be edited without first rasterizing the 
layer.

The user has never seen that error and I dont know photoshop so I for sure 
dont know the error.

They are using photoshop 7. How can they resolve this issue so that they can 
minupulate the total document at will.

If this sounded a lil long winded hit me up privately and I can go further 
into detail over the phone or something, or if you have my digits give me a 
call or leave me your number.


Thanks guys!

Macadio

hello, this is a continuation of a fictional piece. also, i don't know how to top the last one, thank you, very much. wow, what  a laugh:
 
ig also had a raging headache. ig thought the headaches were something that ran in the family, but supa baby knew that ig's headaches were fairly unique. ig's mom gets headaches, because she goes out all night and then goes to a freezing cold barbeque the next day with her moody friends, and spends the night wondering why she is the only one who isn't feeling any pleasure at these things. ig gets headaches for other reasons. ig is not that social. :)

The music was fine and pretty usual for Pacific Sound. The weather sucked

Aw sheeyeh..  Yeah, the dust SUCKED (which is why we were sitting with
our backs to the crowd for a while), but damn, drinking beers in the
sun with groovy house washing over us..  That was a good day.  The
afterparty at my house was fun too.

Good fucking shit too. At least the 1st half was anyway. Haven't managed to
check out the 2nd half yet.

A little slow for my taste, but it's mixed rather well, has a nice movement
to it, the tracks are all pretty on point, and the sound quality is pretty
decent. I'm anxious to hear what part 2 sounds like, cuz I know Jack - and
he likes to build a set - so I'm hoping number 2 jams it proper.

Anyhoo - part 1 gets a big thumbs up - another excellent effort Mr.T 0 I
pity the fool that don't DL this mix.

Hello friends, patrons and enemies ;)

Last weekend I finished my newest mixset, and low and behold it ended up
being a double disk! j/k, this has been something I have been working on for
a little bit now and I would like to share it with all of you.

Where can I get this, you ask? Visit www.jacktriumph.com and click on
"downloads" after the main site pop's up. I will have "hardcopies" with me
this Friday at Progression, available for a $3 "donation". All donations go
to, and ONLY go to, reimbursing materials used for this project, (i.e. jewel
cases, printing paper, discs, ink, etc.) Did you know you can't just go to
office max and buy "2 disc" jewel cases?!?! Anyway, I don't wish to charge
for it, but at the end of the day each "hardcopy" is running me about $2.73.
And as I always I say; "That's Life".

And for those of you who say, I am not giving back to the artist? Well, I
did. Every song on this album is from an actual piece of vinyl, no mp3's,
cd's or any other digital technology used! So if it makes a difference to
you, at approx. $10 per record, I spent well over $222 just to obtain the
tracks to record this album (well being totally honest the "descent" tracks

can't imagine that being an issue. ;)

So, if you don't want to donate, the downloadable mp3's and album art are
absolutely **FREE**, and personally that is how I would like to keep it.

one of the last sunsets i went to i called the "allergy sunset".  they 
went ahead and got a permit once again for berkeley marina, just like 
back in the old days.  just fine.  the problem was, they didn't do it 
in the grassy cove facing the water like they normally did.  they did 
it on the other side of the hill, where all the ragweed or whatever 
kind of plants those are they have over there.  so i spent most of the 
time there sneezing.  i stayed a few hours because of that and finallyh 
ended up having to flee in search of a hot bath.

i like those ones they do out there in lake champlain out there in 
novato.  those ones are good.

I wouldn't say the music was average, Rebecca Watkins brought the fucking
funk in a way that was not too typical of Sunset at all.  Great alignment
with the sun dropping behind the DJ too.  Plus my friend Herb and I had
spent all day outside skating, and actually rode from the Richmond out to
Sunset... very fun day.  While the rest of SF went Bay to Breakers we
skated from Beach to Bay with stops in GG park, a quick bus ride over a
hilltop, some chow in the Haight, and got to ride all of Cesar Chavez
through that long descent after the Evans bridge thanks to a
freak break in traffic.

I have sunburn on my neck and my legs are jello.  :)

Subject: RE: [sfraves] BSP: 052104 MASH-UP

i know, it's kind of lame for me to reply to a BSP for my own party, but i'm 
going to do it anyway!

although the flyer says Mash-Up will be in SF...in fact, it will be in the 
east bay a very short hop, skip and jump from the base of the bay bridge.  
now, sometimes last minute venue changes end up being a bad thing...but in 
this case, luck was on our side and i'm very, very excited about this new 
space!

Mash-Up is going down in a very spacious studio/warehouse.  high ceilings, 
clean bathrooms, indoor smoking area, two large rooms of music and comfy 
sofas and chairs to sit on when your feet get sore cause you were shaking it 
too hard on the dance floor.

before this party even happens, i'd like to thank Mike and the Ambient Mafia 
for providing the beats for the chill room.  when the idea came up for a 
second room of downtempo beats, this is the first group of folks i thought 
of.

and with that, i'd like to invite everyone to come on out!  we're providing 
the space and the music...but you provide the vibe and groovy goodness.

see ya there!

Seriously y'all, this party is gonna rock it proper. My girl Carrie (DJ 
Wish) and her man Odeed are gonna tear shit up for reals, and every other dj 
on that bill has skillz for days. If you're into the funky, chunky, 
breakbeaty goodness - if you're into ass shakin', wigglin' and poppin' - 
this is gonna be off the heez-ay.

Whirred.

He's not kidding about the venue. It really is cool and especially cool
since I can walk there from my house. =D

I'll be there again this week. Looking forward to being able to stumble
home!

--0-2004163988-1084912026=:48784
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

hello, as we sometimes do, this is a special chanson kind of day:
 
who knows who wrote this one? that is not actually a question being posed. it is just a statement:
 
"we build it up and build it up and build it up and now we're solid! solid as a rock! dodododododo...that's what this love is! the thrill is still hot, hot, hot, hot, hot..oooo, oooo,ooo...solid!...." okay also:
 
this song is totally worth mentioning for no particular reason...video, song, album, everything...think about duran duran's "girls on film"...it is the best, and makes 80's music not look so stupid, but still, must recommend avoiding 80's parties unless your true love is there or something like that, because as much as we all love laura brannigan and "gloria", we also are here for a very specific reason. :)

Subject: [sfraves] .: New Dirtbox Sets :. DNB / Breaks / Bmore Club


Wassup y'all - I got a buncha sets up on the site last week, from 4/25,
5/2, and 5/9.  Here's the links and whatnot.  All sets are DNB/Jungle
unless otherwise stated.

Oh, and remember - sets are not available during the show.  So that means
that if you try and download 'em between 7pm Sunday and sometime AM on
Monday, that shit ain't gonna work ;)

Subject: [sfraves] RR: Record stores in SF

My best friend is flying out here next weekend to see Aquasky vs. 
Masterblaster, and he wants to go record shopping (naturally) while he's 
here.

Now, I know of places like Amoeba, but where else can one find new and/or 
used vinyl of the EDM kind. Specifically BREAKBEAT and funky ass house?

I got the east bay shops nailed down as well, but I have done little 
shopping in the city, and that's where we are planning to drop alot of loot.

I saw Philip mention Zen City, but where else doesn't suck ass? Locations 
would help too when replying (if'n y'all wouldd be so kind!)

Thanks in advance!!

Subject: [sfraves] bsp - bob's story

hi all,

alot of people have asked me questions about bob.  here is something he
wrote about himself:

"Save Bob
You know Bob, we all have a friend named Bob.
On the unluckiest of days, March 13th  Friday
the 13th Bob had stayed home to do his laundry
and left his basement door closed and unlocked,
waiting for the buzzer to sound for the next load.
All of a sudden, a swarm of cops chasing a crackhead
who never came near Bobs house let
themselves into his basement. Bob was
cultivating (LEGALLY) a small number of
plants for a few patients, and himself.
Unable to show them paperwork at the time,
Bob was arrested. Now Bob has thousands of
dollars in lawyer fees, bail fees, and a trial coming
up at $500 a day in court. Please, give to Bobs
foundation and enjoy a musical freak out in the
process. We are all better off with Bob, and
people like Bob NOT in jail. Please.
Any amount is appreciated.


please make donations via paypal.com to : saveronnilson@yahoo.com

benefits for bob:

Thursday, May 27th @ www.sublounge.com 6pm-2am

Saturday, June 26th, all nite undaground location

ok, so what if it's a college radio station?  so what if you can probably

i'm playing on the radio tonight!  yes folks, it's a first for me.  Evil 
Breaks be doing a pre-show for friday's Mash-Up and it'll be all breaks from

Subject: Re: [sfraves] bsp - bob's story

yknow if he was doing it legally. . .

most people are recommended to have their growers certificate in the area
were the plants are grown. . .I do, my friends do, and the grower should
also  have the forms stating he's a caregiver for various patients within
view. . .

and for all the legal issues. . .ocbc has programs designed to help people
with issues like that (if they truly were doing it all legally). . .

when it comes to issues like that, you have to expect the coppers to try to
screw you in every way. . . so you have to protect yourself, and
realistically there are organizations there to protect you. . . I haven't
seen someone who was all properly registered and had the appropriate
paperwork who ever had to pay all these attorney fees and such, let alone
even have a case go to court (or worry about going to jail). . .

and if thats how it happened, it's illegal search and seizure unless he let
them in himself. . .it should get thrown out immediately anyways. . .

I would hope he had all the correct forms and such from the patients signing
their growing rights over to him as a caregiver. . .if he wasn't registered
as such, he's pretty much screwed on the "I was growing those for patients"
thing. And if that's the case, depending on where he lived, if he was over
the allowed flowering/vegetative plant limits by his local laws, than he's
screwed too. . .

in all honesty, and if he didn't have the proper info, forms n such. . .it's
kind of his own fault. . .You can't just jump into something like that
without doing the legal research. Cuz if he did, he most likely wouldn't be
having any of these problems. Someone can easily become a full time
caregiver legally if they go thru all the proper processes. Lots of people
are, I sell to clubs occasionally, but tend to donate most of the extra I
don't need to clubs.

I'm open about growing with cops or whoever, no reason to lie,(i know my
rights too) I'm not doing anything wrong, I have all my forms and
certificates n such in order. . .I'm never bothered by police, but am
waiting for the day I need to excersize my rights cuz of some pissed off
sheriff officer or whatever (if it ever happens). . . really if some cops
stormed my grow area, shot my pitt bulls, pulled my plants, then found out
it was all legal. . .I would be due some serious reimbursement.

theres too many people trying to make money off the "medical" thing in
non-admirable ways. But pretty much everyone who goes thru all the proper
channels never has to worry about it. . .

btw, if he was doing this all legally. . .why would he fear going into jail
? Why would he have to pay all these fees ?

sounds like a fishy excuse to me. . .

I recall a party a couple years ago for some guy who was in some sort of
debt due to his own negligence, forgot what it was called tho.didn't turn
out very well.

In my opinion, if he wasn't registered correctly, and was doing this
illegally. . .an event such as this would only hurt the real medical
initiative, showing support for someone who didn't follow the "rules", while
all of us others do. . .it just adds fuel to the fire for the people who try
to fight against the whole medical use issue and shut it down.And something
like that's caused from a few "bad apples" will hurt many many other
innocent persons, potentially taking away their right to their much needed
medicine because of other people's greed. . .

not to be mean, but the procedures are in place to protect true medical
users and caregivers from both authorities and people illegaly using the
medical issue as an excuse or shield. . .you can do it all legally. . . tons
of people do.

oakland cannabis buyers coop/club

awesome sight, tons of legal info n such. . .

Oakland/Berkely are pretty much the main activist areas in california. . .
OCBC turned from a club to more of a widely respected activism group after
all the legal bs they had to go thru years ago. . .

one of the (in not THE) best places to go for your questions and concerns,
legal issues, etc. . .also issue solid legitimate id cards  (widely
accepted, moreso than any other club) and run a 24/7 888 number (for law
enforcement use only) in case you're ever harassed by police or whoever,
where the officers are encouraged to call to have things properly explained
to them.

They also have email lists which update you on all sorts of current
happenings n stuff. . .

their office # is 510.832.5346

good stuff

: )

hi aryck.

no, i didn't take it that way.  i am not as educated as you on these issues.

my friend got arrested.  he told me he was legal.  i believed him.  he
needs money.  i'm helping him.

also, i had no idea that legal growing was as airtight as you described
it.  i was under the impression that it was up to the cops if they wanted
to arrest you or not regardless of "legal" status.  i was under the
impression that being a caregiver was a quasi-legal status.

after all, ed rosenthal is being convicted and i expected that at least he
would have all those forms and procedures taken care of.  i thought "well
if they (the man) can bring down ed then no one is safe regardless of
proper legal status".

i guess i was wrong about ed.

i will keep you informed. and i am doing more research myself.

i appreciate you.

sincerely,

Jonas

You're pretty safe from local prosecution, because there are state and in
some cases local laws that allow growing. However, there are federal laws
which prohibit growing, and the federal laws take precedence over local
laws. So the feds (DEA, FBI) can still bust you if they choose. Ed
Rosenthal got convicted in federal court, on federal charges.

Coltrane drummer Elvin Jones dies

NEW YORK (AP) -- Elvin Ray Jones, a renowned jazz drummer and member of 
John Coltrane's quartet who also played alongside Duke Ellington, Charlie 
Parker and Miles Davis, died Tuesday. He was 76.

Jones died of heart failure in an Englewood, N.J., hospital, said his wife 
of 38 years, Keiko Jones.

"He's happy. No more suffering," said Keiko Jones. "He's been fighting for 
so long."

Jones, called by Life magazine "the world's greatest rhythmic drummer," was 
born in Pontiac, Mich., one of 10 children. He had two musician brothers: 
Hank, a jazz pianist, and Thad, a trumpet and flugelhorn player.

Jones entered the Detroit jazz scene in the late 1940s after touring as a 
stagehand with the Army Special Services show, Operation Happiness.

After a brief gig at the Detroit club Grand River Street, he went to work 
at another club, backing up such jazz greats as Parker, Davis and 
saxophonist Wardell Grey.

Jones came to New York in 1955 for an unsuccessful audition for the Benny 
Goodman band but stayed in the city, joining Charlie Mingus's band and 
making a record called J is Jazz. In 1960, he became a member of John 
Coltrane's quartet.

Jones, with his rhythmic, innovative style, became one of jazz's most 
famous drummers under Coltrane. He can be heard on Coltrane's A love 
Supreme and Coltrane Live at the Village Vanguard.

After leaving the Coltrane quartet, Jones briefly played with Duke 
Ellington and formed the Elvin Jones's Jazz Machine. He put out several 
solo albums and continued to tour, including last month in Oakland, Calif., 
Keiko Jones said.

"I loved the focus in the early days of Wicked on the pagan aspects of 
life. The natural cycles of the full moons, being out in nature, on the 
beach, free, alive, unbridled, wild and spontaneous. There is no club, 
party or other sound system that has ever achieved anything close to that..."
-Jeno, on the early days of Wicked and the Full Moon Raves

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

hello, we have a special song of the day and then we will be returning to our regular tedious project:
 
this is a spoof on a jessica simpson song (the one that goes "i want to be with you") that a lady might sing to her husband after she spends too much money on shoes on his credit card:
 
went strolling down the avenue just the other day
saw some stilleto heels that i loved
picked them up the very next day
 
chorus: i don't need noooooooooooooooooo shoes. cause i got these two-oo-oo
 
i wanna keep this shoes
cause they both have bows
and they make me look just like a straight up ho!
i wanna keep these shoes
cause the heel's so high
i can hardly believe these little shoes are mine!
i wanna keeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeep these shoes
i wanna keeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeep these shoes
forever
 
went strolling down the avenue
right again today
saw some pink heels that i loved
picked them up right away
 
chorus: i don't need nooooooooooooooooooooo shoes, cause i got these two-oo-oo
i wanna keep these shoes
cause they have pink straps
i don't have another pair of shoes like that
i wanna keep these shoes
cause the heel's quite low
and they have space for foot growth
i wanna keep these shoes
i wanna keeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeep these shoes
forever. :)

hey all

check it out. . .

http://www.kbcitv.com/x5154.xml?ParentPageID=3Dx5157&ContentID=3Dx53603&L=
ayout=3DKBCI.xsl&AdGroupID=3Dx5154&NewsSection=3D


yknow to be honest with everyone. . .all this media attention is good, =
but frustrating. . .
I see so many people saying they have these cures but I know they aren't =
cures at all. . .
People thinking lyme is the base of the problem. . .
people thinking they know what this is cuz they've seen similar symptoms =
before (which appear similar but are completely unrelated). . .
lots of misinformation going around. . .

. . .=20

it's gonna start really pissing me off as organizations start jumping on =
the bandwagon just for the sake of jumping on the bandwagon. . =
.especially when they couldn't have cared less a while back when most of =
us were emailing them like crazy. . .=20

it's good but it can get bad, the media exposure I mean. . .people need =
to know they aren't alone, but theres a point when all sorts of issues =
start coming up from the huge amount of people reading these reports who =
may or may not have this disease. . .some of them have called me after =
getting my phone number somehow. . .which I don't really mind, but . . =
.gets kind of intense in ways. . .not the illness itself (even tho it is =
truly scary intense and horrible imagination defying stuff), but the way =
people are reacting to the information they're being exposed to.

we need a cure yeah, I guess the real work towards that goal comes well =
after the mass hysteria part. . .=20

in a way it's like one of those situations where you're talking to =
someone and they're just sitting there, not really paying attention, =
just waiting for their turn to say what they thought up during the time =
you were telling them how to help themselves. . .never really listening =
to anything but the one or two words that spark their attention here n =
there.

dude, one guy was even arguing with me, saying that it was all the work =
of witches who would come out after the world was in chaos and heal =
everyone so they could take over the world. He talked about an ex gf, =
that hexxed his car when they broke up and made the engine seize, and =
how he was reading a book about some christian something or other and =
his gf said in some evil voice "what are you reading". . .

I don't live my life for the same reasons others do. . .sometimes it's =
best for me to just watch and listen and wait and see. . .difficult for =
me tho,

what a friggin universe we live in. . .most of you prolly don't know =
what I mean, or where I'm "getting at".

its ok tho. . .


. . .=20

I'll keep everyone updated,=20

take care

Subject: [sfraves] Elevate: Jungle Weeklie in AZ I went 2....

OK... so like 1 night of Jungle (& even that 1 set on Sat night), so like when we were @ the record store on Sat, the promoter like gave us fliers 4 like his Jungle weeklie.. so it was totally on 4 Monday night...

OK.. the weeklie was in this like Lil' Swank mini club called Bash... but ya know.. their sound system sucks total ass man.. o h my goodness man... like some Jungle tracks should like be mondo banned from being played there...

Alota the people I ran in2 like @ the other events I went 2 were all there.. oh oh oh... I saw Micah there also which was fun!!! =)  But like it was Dope 'cause I'm like totally makin' new Homies in AZ now!! YAY!!  It was also fun 'cause all the people @ Elevate were like totally in good spirits 2...

But ok.. so the weeklie...eh... the DJs who played were alright.. but nothing like totally stellar, ya know... I mean... they spun good tracks, but nothin' like pumpin' unless they were saving their good tracks 4 a better night?  I mean.. seriously... there were alota like "woooohooo" hands thrown in the air action during some tracks there, but I dunno, those tracks were like "eh"... Hello 2Day... I know I'm spoiled w/ the Jungle scene here in the Bay Area & all the Groovy DJs that sin here & I went there veeeeeeeeeeeery totally mondo biased & seriously.. I really wasn't impressed, but i did hve fun dancing though & meeting alota Groovy poeple... 

Goin' 2 Elevate actually really did feed me my Jungle fix 2 complete my stay in AZ... I mean... from what I was told, the scene there is like choppy & goes through fazes... kinda like the plavor of the moment kinda thing i guess.. I dunno... I'd really Love 2 have some Jungle DJs from here tear it up there man... that owuld be sooooo Dope!

Anywaze... yeah... LoL.. Fun times! =)  Yeah.. it was Fun also 'cause well... I all walkin' around the club w/ my Smokey Purple, Teal, Aqua Blue, Limelight green, & Forest Green hair & well.. it was always a Groovy converstaion starter, everywhere I went in AZ 4 that matter =)  OK.. la la la :P

Take Care,
Peace-> O§bY {8O)

Subject: [sfraves] I'm back from AZ =)

I know I'll probably be seen' alota y'allin the coming days/ nights 2 come 'cause it's time 2 get my groove back on in the bay so like instead of tellin' y'all individually (which I'll still probably do anyway 'cause I Love talking), I thought i'd tell y'all a lil' bit of my trip on here ... but yeah... Phoenix AZ was fuckin' Awesome man!!!  Good fuckin' Shit!!  I mean... the scene there from what i'm told is totally small & yeah... it needs some fixin'& all that... anywaze... la la la.. that's whooooooooole another story...

So my highlights of my time there:

---> I got a New Tatoo!! YAY!!!  I Fuckin' Love it!! Good Fuckin' Shit man!

---> Hello 2Day, I had a car while i was there!!!!!!!!  YAY!!1  It was so Awesome bein' free again 2 fuckin' drive & man.. just like drivie period man... LoL.. serously.. I almost drove the car back here 2 Cali 'cause I Loved my car so much!

---> I got 2 spend time w/ my Big Bro DJ DMX... I mean... seriously man.. y'all have 2 understand that me & this dude have been Homies 4 like the past like 5-6 years & we been planning like 2 meet up here or like when he lived in Denver.. but he moved 2 AZ like almost a year ago now & we talked like 2 months ago.. on impulse i (well.. my Mom) bought a ticket that night & yeah... so like we totally got 2 talk & catch up on eeeeeeeeverything (we spent a whole mondo chuck of the time talkin' about music ofcourse 'cause we got the same tastes in music & stuff) & D always has this way of kicki'n my ass & giving me the best advice about what needs 2 B done in my life when i can't see it... actually.. we had 1 of the best best best conversations lastnight that totally well... it put sooooooooo many things in2 perspective!!  I'm hella fuckin' buggin' still from lastnight's talk..

---> I got a new Bro... Mi aka Miah aka Jerimiah aka DJ 3cnal who spins yummy breakbeats!!  LoL.. Mi was literally my 24/7 goin' out partner 'cause I made him go w/ me 2 all the weeklies & that RAve on Saturday as well as day time ventures!!  I Love this kid.. he's a trip!

Things that were lame:
---> OK.. yeah.. the heat there is a givien... soooooo good 2 be back here where the temp is well... it our fuckin' weather & I LOVE IT!

---> Drivers there suck fuckin' Ass.. I swear man... there was never a moment that i drove on the highway or on some road where some dumb shit totally would break 4 no reason, cut me off, or i dunno... but it was sooooo lame!  Grrrrrrrr on AZ Drivers!!! >:O

---> ya know... I think that's about it... in all honesty... i wish i got 2 stay there 4 a few more days 'cause I dunno... it was nice bein' w/ my Big Bro again & just absorbing everything... I was totally fuckin' balling almost kinda on the way 2 the airport 'cause I was sad & it was nice living responsiblity free 4 a while... but ya know... gotta get back in the swing of things... when i started like getting close 2 here... I was like well... my mentality started changin' & well... I know what i gotta do now & I seriously have the stength 2 accomplish my goals now!!

OK.. la la la.. i'm sorry 4 goin' on & On & On.. but I would Love 2 throwdown w/ y'all soon 'cause if 1 thing, we got a beautiful thing goin' on here!!  It's sad that Phoenix & AZ & stuff is still workin' 2 what we got!!  But they'll get there soon! =)

Subject: [sfraves] Re: REVIEW: [sfraves] hybrid!

let me start this by saying....I'm hurting. My eyes are bloodshot, my head
hurts, and you know when you are sooo hung-over that the toothpaste sticks
to your mouth because you have cottonmouth? That's me. (yh I know pretty
picture) . I called work at 9 am to tell them I'll show up when I'm
ready...lol.

..so you all probably figured out by now it was a f*cking blast. I don't
even know where to start.

..um, so well it began last Monday, when I found out from a certain other
dj, that this was going to happen and basically to keep my yap shut. So
sorry if I wasn't able to share it with ya. Which in the end really didn't
matter, because the place was packed like sardines in a can. So armed with
this information I called up Jason Lee to let him know and of course sent
out a page to Calamity, cause I know she loves hybrid and kind of left it at
that.

Warmed up the night by having some pints at Thirsty bear, with jason, and
reminiscing of time when Mike-Red used to lay it down there and how lame it
is today with the stereo playing and the dj booth empty. Stayed until about
9 ish and then realized it was time to go when I started arguing with the
bartender because he didn't have any Del Dueno Tequila and that Patron
wasn't gonna substitute. Ended up drinking the tequila with the deer on
it...ehh harsh.

Walked down to sixth to see all the beautiful people, and walked into a very
very empty Anu...not for long. Found Scott and gave him a copy of my new
mix. Met up with JC, had some more pints. Literally get done with my first
pint and I am not kidding you turn around and it is like a wave of folks
coming in...."steady" and "a lot". Oh well secret's out it appears. I
actually found out later that someone was outside of Qool telling people.
Which is cool, but, if you know how big 111 is compared to anu, you know
this is not gonna work out. lol.

So turn back around and there is Jason chatting it up with Hybrid like they
are old football mates...very cool, they seemed like nice folks.

By 11 - 1130 the place is soo packed you can barely get a spot on the
sidewalk to smoke....I'm thinking at this moment 2 things: 1 - images of a
great white concert and 2 - I hope no one has to leave in a hurry.

So standing outside and who do I see, mr sf breaks guru BAMMER! And of
course it is business as usual with him, meetin folks, gettin his flyers
out, etc. etc. Good night for him to be promotin the event this Friday, lot
of break heads there. Chatted it up with him and then realized there was no
way I was gonna make it back inside. At midnight, there are still people
showing up.

Hybrid rocks. It wasn't a live set, but none the less, great breaks being
played. And you could hear it outside which was more than satisfactory for
me.

So, armed with a pack of smokes and a pocket full of flyers I forgot to pass
out, I chatted it up with Bam, Kevin knapp was there, jeff allen, jackie,
shelly, jc and I am sure I saw someone else. Basically just jumped
conversation's and listened to the tunes...hopefully I didn't make too much
of an ass out of myself.

Sobered up and left about 2 am, when I realized that alcohol doesn't fill
your stomach as nicely as a cheeseburger and went off in search of food.
Completely lost track of Jason, who rang me about 3 am to say he was trying
to find his car. lol.

I love surprise gigs.

Did they suck less than the last time they were out here or play music that
didn't suck as bad as their new CD? The guys from Anu had a boat party last
summer with them. By far the worst I've *ever* heard Hybrid and that's
really sad for me. =(

why is it that some of the most enjoyable times i've had in the bay area 
have been OUTSIDE on the street talking to friendly sfravers?  had a blast 
at anu and ran into mr. jack triumph, jc, shelly and a slew of folks.

jack is a fun drunkard.

and the last track i heard hybrid drop that actually got me dancing on the 
sidewalk was a remix of 2 Bad Mice's Bombscare.

Subject: [sfraves] tonight, no xhale!

so folks, we've decided to hold off on our weekly Xhale event for 
tonight...in lieu of the fact that:

1)  Way Out West is playing at Mezzanine with a live PA from Momu, dj sets 
by jody and nick warren AND a live pa by WOW

2)  Ascension is at 1015 with Hybrid headlining and it's a benefit for the 
SFLNC

so, if you are heading out tonight, go to one of these fine events!  or 
heck, hit up Bad Kitty!  it's all within a few blocks of SOMA.

see y'all tonight!

Subject: Re: [sfraves] hybrid!

DJ Set the last time and the time before was a 3 hour DJ//Live set at
Kelly's Mission Rock (Thump). Let's just say one of the 3 guys canNOT
fucking mix to save his life let alone beat match. Maybe the boy had too
much to drink. I dunno. It was painfully bad. The music they were playing
was far too soft and lacked the Hybrid edge that so uniquely defined them
within the soft world of progressive. I bought the new CD and was let down
by the lame, wandering male vocals and the go-nowhere tracks. It was as if
Hybrid got their nuts cut off and no longer had the balls to put out the
edgey music they used to.

I can only hope that they're BACK playing what they should be and not
playing//putting out the crap that's on their new CD. That CD is a POS
compared to Wide Angle and all of the countless remixes circa that time...

Subject: Re: [sfraves] hybrid!

i like morning sci-fi - it's definitely a change, but
what i like is they span a number of genres, and the
vocals do work for this album's intended feel.  only
gripe i have is i saw the sci-fi dvd - the singer
grandstands and does this aerosmith/robertsmith
performance on stage.  during lulls he flails around
in some quasi-passionate rage trying to get immersed
in the music but in my eyes, failing.  what i'd like
to see is a vocal performance akin to underworld - now
*they* blow me away.

and i don't think progressive is 'soft'..i've heard
enough to call it anything but.  if it sounds like
their balls were cut off, that's what we'd call
charmin prog.  2 ply is the best!

Subject: Re: [sfraves] hybrid!

I dunno - Morning Sci-Fi didn't do it for me either. It's so watered down. 
They had this one track on it that starts off banging like crazy - then this 
wack male vocal kicks in and ruins the whole thing. I don't even like the 
track w/ Peter Hook on it, and I'm a huge New Order fan. (BTW - I have a 
copy of it for sale if anyone wants it!)

Subject: Re: [sfraves] hybrid!

The vocals suck. Period. Morning Sci-Fi is a waste of their talent. I never
bothered to watch the DVD that came with the CD. I hated the CD so much it
got stuck in my closet and hasn't been pulled out since. Hybrid went soft.
I've heard progressive not be soft. I've heard Hybrid not be soft.
Especially in a lot of their remix work. That no longer applies to them. It
really pisses me off too if you can't tell. That's why I looked at the
Ascension thing and saw that they were playing and said fucknoway.

Underworld. Hell yes. Seeing them when they were last here at the Warfield
was awesome. Same with Orbital at the same venue. Hybrid 3 years ago - HELL
YES. If you can find their set on Thump or can get a copy of it, well, THAT
is how they should sound.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] hybrid!

As much as I love ya Jackie T (and Jason Lee too), there are some SHITTY 
progressive dj's/producers out there that play some severely soft shit. I 
hated prog. for years unti lI started hearing some more funky & chunky 
choons coming out. Even still though, it's few and far between (IMHO). Not 
everyone can have such excellent taste as yerself JT, lol.

Subject: [sfraves] fruit is good for you!  and breaks, too.

i just went to the grocery store and picked up a nice selection of yummy 
fruit.  i'm goiing to slice it up all purty and arrange it on trays and i'm 
willing to share with everyone.

only catch is you'll have to come to Mash-Up and go to the chill room to get 
it.  ;)

oh, oops.  is that a BSP?  sorry.

eat more fruit!  it's good for you.

hello, this is a continuation of a fictional piece:
 
ig was reading on the internet while supa baby watched. 
"i'm stuck", said ig.
"why are you stuck, ig?", asked supa baby.
"well, i erased all the virus', and now i am sorry that i did.", replied ig.
"why's that, ig?", inquired supa baby.
"well, i know that i don't want a virus, but also, i forgot to study the ones that i did get, and now they are all gone. ", said ig.
"maybe you can ask to have them sent again.", said supa baby.
"yes, maybe.", said ig. :)

Subject: Re: [sfraves] hybrid! !! Anton Styles !!

He's got a new mix out. Well, 2 actually, but one is a hard techno mix that
isn't finished.

I made a quick download page for all of his stuff to make things easier for
all. If you haven't heard Anton's sets - you want to...

PS :: I'll send you an offline email with his cell number Brandon. Give him

Subject: Re: [sfraves] bsp - "save Bob"  thurs. may 27th

hey all. . .

I had some of my questions from the initial post about bob, and then very
respectively recived responses to my questions from bob. . .(very much
appreciated)

I just wanted to mention that (since things were better explained) that Bob
definately DOES deserve our support.

Go to this event, help him out. . .I will when I can. . .

and really, it's not only helping him, but helping the whole issue. I feel
positive suppoort for positive people in this community creates a positive
message to those officials who belive people like Bob are just
troublemakers, and society would be better off without em (which isn't
true). . .

just wanted to mention that
take care all

: )

That place used to have a dress code.   
It sounded like one of those dress-to-impress-but-not-to-dance things,
so I've avoided the place.
Do they still have a dress code like that?

Subject: [sfraves] BSP:  MASH-UP : Tonight! : Breaks in yo' face!

ok folks, here's the final BSP from me.  i promise after this i'll shut up.  
;)

Mash-Up is goin' down tonight in the east bay, just minutes from the bay 
bridge.  We've got a secure, beautiful venue that I'm sure you'll enjoy and 
a slammin' lineup of DJs.  This party will be bangin' all night from 9pm til 
4am.

I'm not sure what else I can say to entice you to come join us or to hype up 
those already planning to attend.  I'm positive tonight is going to go off 
and I hope to see you all there!  Here's all the info for the party.


MASH-UP
presented by Evil Breaks
Friday, May 21st
9pm-4am
18+

Featuring DJs:

Odeed - (Moonshine/LABA/W.E.)

Odeed is simply one of the sickest producers and dj's/turntablists around. 
He has had multiple releases on Moonshine Green with fellow producer Bionic, 
and his style of breaks easily distinguish him from other producers. He's 
had many affiliations including Moonshine, C.T.W., Downtown Dwellars, 2 
Covert Capin's, and of course L.A.B.A. One of his most recent performances 
in the Bay (May, 2003) was at 1015 where he opened up for Uberzone, and we 
are proud to bring him back again for a performance not to be missed.

vs

DJ Wish (W.E. - Baltimore, MD)

Originally hailing from Balmtimore, MD dj Wish has made a name for herself 
with her unique style of breaks. She has had many residencies to include, 
The Edge (DC), Tracks (DC), and The Spot (Baltimore). She has also worked 
closely with Shaken Not Stirred Records, Deep Rising Productions, F(x) 
productions, and she has performed at the world famous Buzz (Nation) in 
Washington DC. Odeed and Wish are currently working on a few tracks 
together, and this event is going to be part of their nation wide tour to 
promote their new label W.E. Recordings. I've been told we might get to hear 
some unreleased tracks that are sure to tear up the dance floor.

Evil Breaks Room:

1030 -1130 Bam vs Nick Nyquil  (Evil Breaks / Invibe / Xhale / Onieromancy /

2 - 3 Majere - Special Breaks set  (Electrosorcery)
3 - 4 Aaron Jae vs Athena  (Evil Breaks / Seekr / Xhale / Gravity Crew)

Subject: [sfraves] WHO.COMIN'? :: GO2 ::  MASH-UP : Tonight! : Breaks in yo' face!

I be there. It's walking distance from my house. For those of you that want
to get your pre-drinking game on - hit me up. Tyler, Nick and I will be
hosting a *before-we-walk-over* drinking gathering at our house. Sometime
after 9pm. I have a Cal graduation to attend.

Oh and if you dunno about this party, let me just say that the music will be
good, they have a bar, and the venue is sweet! Get your asses out to this.
It's only $10 at the door for a 2 room party in a nice venue in the East
Bay.

To some degree they do have a dresscode. I could be wrong. I think Scott's
gone in his usual shorts and combat boots getup...

Content-Type: text/plain; format=flowed



so I went last year had an AMAZING TIME!, I went this year, reminded by my 
coworker (thank god)  This is simply one of THE BEST PARTIES IN SF!  I got 
off work, meandered into the main room, while wanting to make out with 
everyone, mind you....and hybrid was playing, what a way to get outta work, 
just off the hook!!  I have been doing this "party thing" for a long time 
and it is just simple.  Fashion show, fire dancing, BEAUTIFUL people, 
exceptional music... for ten bucks.  I got there and had to run up and give 
Benjy a hug, he had no idea whoi it was and took a bliind picture, always 
sporting his camera (thank you for the wonderful pics Benjy!!)  GO next year 
if you get the chance.  It is funny too, the only 2 times I have been to 
1015 folsom have been for this event, so why does eveyone say it is a shitty 
venue?  hahah, just kidding
So worth it, and if you didn't go, poopy!
It was great to see all my friends from Santa Cruz, representin' the 
moontribe as always, as well as Brandon, John Wood, Terrence and Galaga... 
and boy oh boy
Do any of you remember Jello and Fubari???
well I saw Jeff aka Jello and holy shit does he look good ;)
he is getting ready to move to LA if anyone cares, apparently Ari aka Fubari 
is living in colorado and is married with kids (I always thought those boys 
were gay)
oh well, if you don't know these too, I have spent many of debaucherous 
evennings with them and many other friends WAAAAAY back in the day (circa 
True Love, lepidoptera)  He mentioned hellos to Macadio and Micron (that is 
prolly all he could remember :P)  *waving from Jeff
That was the top of the night for me, always wondered what happenned to 
them.
anyhoot, I just had my redbull awakenning and now am crashing again (yay 
sleep)
have fun and a good one!
Danny Picard

Subject: [sfraves] Jet Trash, Bad Kitty, & Urban Montage lastnight!!  Good Shit!

OK.. so like lastnight it was my Homegirl's Birthday (Dhoris) & she booked Cloud 9 2 have her party... so we got there around like 8:30... since it was still Happy Hour @ Anu..

Sharp walked in & as soon as I saw him.... seriously.. it felt like "Hello 2Day, I'm ready 2 B saved from the awful Jungle weeklie experience i went 2 on Monday" 'cause yeah... he told me that they would drop downstairs soon... so then around like 10:30, went back 2 Anu 4 Bad Kitty 'cause ofcourse i had 2 hang out w/ my Darling Lushy Lush Serephim!!  OK.. Hello 2day.. she threw down some fuckin' Awesome Electro Clash tunes trhat had me goin' on the dancefloor!11  Oh MY goodness, Hello 2day, I net Lil' Miss Trouble Mayka Herself... Subsista!!

Upstairs, seriously, there was this Dude doin' a Live Prog House set on his keyboards & drum machines, as well as a live bongo drum player & some dude playing sax!!!  YUM!!!  But the real fun 4 me happened downstairs in the basement... woooooooohoooooooo.... Sharp busted out some hard ass fuckin' Jungle... I guessin', not sure, but he played alota Dub & even harder than that.... But oh yeah.. I just had 2 like totally lose myself in the music & I was like "Hell Fuckin' yeah, I need this" & I was just feelin' so proud 2 B a Junglist from the Bay Area!!! WOW!!!

Back upstairs, the DJ started playin well.. disco house w/ prince songs... it sounded yummy 4 a while, but eh.. it started getting tired & I realized it was only catering 2 the drunk girls who ooooh my gosh.. I walked back in the club from a ciggy outside.. bumped in2 this girl who like grabbed my shoulder then proceeded 2 put her leg on my shoulder & started dancing.. really... it was so trippy & kinda scary 'cause she looked @ me doin' that tongue thing.. ooooh my gosh... thanks god she was drunk 'cause i kind pushed her hgently 2 get off me... eeeeuuuuuuugh

Upstairs they started spinning house breaks after that as well.. it was good!

But downstairs, Mal & Ivry hopped on the decks!!! YUM!!!  OK... so  yeah... Mal got on the decks & like sontinues the hard shit... Ivry got on a few records later & like brought the vibe down a few notches, but fuuuuuuuck man. I need these Jungle sets soooo bad!!!!  I mean.. ya'll know how it is when u experience something musically mondo eeeh & U need something 2 replace that feeling... so that was exactly what I needed lastnight!!

Subject: Re: [sfraves] saturday review: Ruby Sky - Behrouz

The first time I went, I was unaware of the dress code, and they asked me 
next time to not wear the sneaks.  The followinf times I have gone I have 
worn some Maddins, but have always tried to dress in the clubby attire.. so 
it's a mixed bag.  I think the deal is.. don't accentuate the visors and 
baggy jeans.. and if you do.. bring some damn fine ladies.. cause it's not 
who you are.. but who your with! :)  j/k on that last part.. kinda.

That place used to have a dress code.   It sounded like one of those 
dress-to-impress-but-not-to-dance things,
so I've avoided the place.
Do they still have a dress code like that?

Subject: [sfraves] need a place to live?  i need help!

hey all.

so one of my roomates has decided to bail (thanks for the notice!) and now i
am left trying to find roomates in the next two weeks BEFORE I LEAVE THE
COUNTRY.

so, i need to find two new roomates for a wonderful apt in oakland (very
conveniently located between piedmont, lake merritt and downtown -- near
BART and ac transit and the 580) by june.  you can move in mid-june to july.
one room is $350 and the other is $550 (somewhat negotiable...we haven't
totally set the rent).  the whole house will be shared by all, even though
it's divided into two units -- upstairs and downstairs -- but we're turning
it into a co-op-y type space.  there is a HUGE living room downstairs where
we plan to throw super parties.

need more incentives:  hardwood floors, beautiful views, awesome location,
big windows, excellent people...

PLEASE.  i desperately need this, otherwise i have no place to live.

if you're interested, hit me up with an e-mail.

if you know anyone who's interested, please tell them to contact me.

thanks.

*emma*

Sunday, May 30, 2004 ** echo beach summer monthly **

Starting Sunday May 30th, DJs Garth and Jeno, two of San Francisco's most
respected djs formerly of Wicked, explore a new musical direction with
their new mothly poolside party, Echo Beach, at the Bambuddha Lounge.

Pulling from their extensive collections of underground disco, new wave, ro=
ck,
soul, jazz and reggae, Garth and Jeno bring the heads out for a soul-soothi=
ng
musical backdrop around the Phoenix Hotel's muraled pool.

"We've always been known for throwing in some old disco, funk, new
wave, dubby trippiness or other unorthodox musical inspiration while we
spin," Jen=F6 says. "This party is an opportunity to pursue those other
possibilities with more fervor as we will be expressing ourselves outside
the accepted and usually quite safe musical formats of the current SF club
scene."

Event Date: May 30 2004 and every last sunday of the month all summer

Event Name: Echo Beach

Venue: Bambuddha Lounge; 601 Eddy Street (at Larkin), San Francisco, CA;
415-885-5088;

DJ's: Garth and Jeno (formerly of Wicked)

Musical Style: ECLECTIC - mix of underground disco, new wave, rock, soul, r=
eggae and
melodic house

Cover: NO COVER

Outdoor BBQ provided by Bambuddha's Rising Star Chef Joe Bosworth

Bio: MAURICIO AVILES
Born in the capitol of El Salvador in 1969, Mauricio Aviles immigrated with=
 his parents to San Francisco, California in 1973. Growing up in the Missio=
n District, he was constantly surrounded by the latin rhythms of the barrio=
=2E His father had a company that produced theatrical and musical events th=
at featured 'la cultura latina', and eventually Mauricio became involved wi=
th his father's creative enterprise, helping to produce several festivals a=
nd concerts in the Bay Area. The people and the music of this period provid=
ed the foundation for Mauricio's involvement in the City's burgeoning dance=
 scene that evolved throughout the 90's.
As a dj Mauricio's first actual gigs began at the City's bastion of undergr=
ound vibration, the EndUp. As a protege of Arron Olivares, Mauricio began f=
orming his own sounds and creating a devoted following that are still with =
him today. His next regular residencies were simultaneously Corazon, a lati=
n flavored weekly in the heart of the Mission District, and Metrojazz a ver=
y popular and original weekend event that successfully combined down tempo,=
 abstract beats and house, a hybrid that would eventually become to describ=
e the 'San Francisco Sound'.   Acknowledging the urban, afro origins of dan=
ce music, with a personal blend of his own latino roots, and a constant end=
eavor to break new ground, Mauricio's sound is hauntingly personal, emotion=
al and consistently fresh. Creating a niche within the deep house sound, hi=
s style, though ethereal, is undeniably funky and always elicits a great re=
sponse on the dance floor.  Now with an internationally successful compilat=
ion under his belt (Naked Music's Nude Dimension II), Mauricio has begun hi=
s production career with a debut single slated for release in Summer 2001. =
As an emissary for Naked Music, Mauricio has also commenced a global tour, =
ensuring that America's hottest new dance label is well represented.  Mauri=
cio has of late done production work and dj=92d under the moniker of MOVIDO=
, his project with collaborator and Loveslap label founder Charles Spencer.

Bio: DAVID HARNESS
In 1990, David began DJ'ing in his hometown of Monterey, California, at the=
 After Dark. As his popularity grew past the boundaries of Monterey, he was=
 invited to establish a residency at Tilt, and Sound Factory, in San Franci=
sco. In 1992, as David's popularity continued to grow he, along with DJ, Ru=
ben Mancias and promoter Joseph Solis opened a hip and popular club, Lift, =
at Club Dv8. David joined Bay Area legendary DJ, Pete Avila and host Foxxee=
 Brown on 'Your Mama's House', on the Bay Area's popular radio station KMEL=
 FM. Being the only "true" house mix show on any Northern California radio =
station, DJ's David Harness, Pete Avila and host Foxxee Brown have played a=
 key role in furthering House Music in the Bay Area. Also during that year,=
 David established a residency at San Francisco's legendary Club Universe. =
David Harness has quickly become one of the most well known and popular DJ'=
s in the San Francisco Bay Area club scene. David's popularity continued to=
 soar, taking him around the world; and the opportunity to play with New Yo=
rk's Legendary DJ's, Frankie Knuckles, Tony Humphries, Little Louie Vega, T=
edd Patterson, Dave Morales, London's Ricky Morrison, Danny Teneglia, Marqu=
es Wyatt- to name a few. He has appeared in articles and interviews in Bill=
board Magazine, Paper Magazine, Surface, XLR8R, Urb, Streetsounds, Sweater,=
 HX, Next and the Bay Guardian.



Bio: LOVEWORKS
Add a large helping of deep underground house music with a side of funk, a =
heap of disco, and a hint of techno, and you have the most nutritious dance=
floor experience available in San Francisco. Initially conceived by Dianna =
Jacobs and Nori Castillo of Toontown /  Carefree fame in the summer of '96,=
 Loveworks was envisioned as a refuge from the monotony of local clubs and =
superficial music, and  has become one of the bay area's most well known ni=
ghts out, while somehow remaining one it's best kept secrets.  It exists to=
 unite people of any race, social status or sexuality together in a comfort=
able and friendly club environment with music as the focal point, and in ad=
dition to it's monthly parties at the Minna Gallery, Loveworks also teams u=
p with other like minded parties around the city and has been featured at c=
lubs and parties such as Liquid, the Top, Electric, and the Endup.  Besides=
 late night dancing, Loveworks has also been involved in events for Wired M=
agazine, Apple Computer, Sony Digital, Construct Internet Design, and a hos=
t of others. Loveworks also had the honor of winning the SF Bay Guardian=92=
s =91 BEST HOUSE CLUB =91 in 1999.


Bio: 111 MINNA GALLERY
111 Minna Gallery is a dynamic =91contemporary art salon=92 that provides a=
n arena for multi-dimensional artistic expression in a community atmosphere=
=2E The goal of the =91gallery-as salon=92 concept is to nurture and suppor=
t a communal gathering of artists and a collaboration between diverse art f=
orms. This goal is achieved through six-week rotations of visual art exhibi=
tions curated by the staff combined with a variety of music and film events=
=2E =91Minna=92 is not only the name of the street on which the gallery is =
found but also translates from Japanese as "everybody," an all-inclusive te=
rm that symbolizes the embracing environment of the space. The gallery, whi=
ch also offers two bars, is crafted in an eclectic, contemporary design wit=
h ample furniture inviting guests to leisurely relax and enjoy conversation=
 among friends. The combination of art, music, film, dance and conversation=
 found at 111 Minna Gallery creates a unique gathering place for a multi-se=
nsory experience.

"The welfare of the people in particular has always been the alibi of 
tyrants, and it provides the further advantage of giving the servants of 
tyranny a good conscience."
-Albert Camus

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the 
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become 
visible."
-Jacques Attali in his seminal text "Noise"

"I loved the focus in the early days of Wicked on the pagan aspects of 
life. The natural cycles of the full moons, being out in nature, on the 
beach, free, alive, unbridled, wild and spontaneous. There is no club, 
party or other sound system that has ever achieved anything close to that..."
-Jeno, on the early days of Wicked and the Full Moon Raves

Subject: [sfraves] SRR: MIXER REPAIR???

I have a Numark that has kept me spinning for the last month or so, but a 
friend of mine is donating me his old Pioneer DJM 500, which needs a few 
repairs. Does anyone know of a reputable shop that can get it up and running 
again for a decentr price? Or are any of you folks out in SFR land 
electronically inclined enough to do this sort of thing???

Basic rundown of problems:

Channel 1: volume is insanely low even w/ gain or volume up all the way.
Channel 2: up fader is broken off - I'm assuming he means the little metal 
slider-bit, not the actual fader inside the mixer.
Channel 3: unless you hold fader down it bleeds, also the bass cuts in and 
out
Channel 4: has similar bass knob problem, but that's about it.

The (bass) knob issues could just be dirty pots - that's what it sounds like 
to me, and I know the Pioneers are infamous for having dirty pot issues.. 
The real concerns are mainly with Channel 1 and 2. My friend got a quote for 
about $130 worth of repairs, but that was from a guy who does repairs at his 
house, not at a shop. Anyway....any help will be greatly appreciated!

Subject: [sfraves] Alumni review: Burning down the house

Alumni burned it down Saturday night. Full on raging crazy rave
madness. I was totally sober and could *not* stop dancing all
night :).

As advertised, it was all about the old stuff. And what really
got me, all night, was realizing just how *good* a lot of those
tracks really were. Yeah :).

Downstairs, watching Markie Mark mix... I'm just in awe of
how good he is. Dude takes mixing to a whole new level. If I
weren't so busy dancing, I could just watch him mix all day.

My favorite moment of the night was watching Spun take over with
"Dance with the speaker". Everyone went completely ballistic :).

Upstairs, the FnF crew also rocked like hell, had the floor
packed in with dancers all night. ALL of the DJs did outstanding
jobs.

I was tired and all danced out, and had that happy glow. My
feet were sore. My butt was sore. I was thinking of bouncing
over to Woom for some quality ambient sit-down time. Mmmmmmm
fuzzy here I come.

Then John Carel hit the decks.

John baby, you are the fucking man. That set was brilliant. It
got my sorry ass up and yelling. It got everybody yelling. The
whole time. Aw dude. You better put an armed guard on that crate.

And don't even consider another sabbatical. You either play
out or we're going over to your house.

Sean

Dance with the speaker till you hear it blow
B-b-b blow blow

You also forgot summerbreeze which imo is his best mix of all time. As =
for Magik 6/7 I still get chills and sometimes even cry when I hear the =
crowd going apeshit during the delerium - silence breakdown (6) and =
insigma - open our eyes (7) breakdown.

Last time when I saw him at 1015 he kinda sucked though:
the crowd not having a clue that he was the number 1 DJ in the world or =
who he was
those ugly tight ass shirts
playing only tech-trance (Nyana)
spending most of his deck time talking with his buddies
and his "full of himself" attitude (Oakenfold anyone?)

ruined it and made me dislike him.

He's got a new CD out that's pretty cool. Not really "Doc-worthy" compared

I have a 3x12" copy of his MMII for sale right now. It's in pretty much

Anyhoo - before it goes up on eBay, anyone who is interested out to make me 
an offer.

I took about 200 pictures of the evening for those who are interested.
Definitely a fun time had by all, every where I walked throughout the
space, I heard music that brought a smile to my face. Many classics for
the evening to chase, as usual, thrown in the air of beauty and grace!

Thanks!

MUSIC

In Deep With House

Checking in on the godfathers of San Francisco's electronic DJ scene

<mailto:chronfeedback@sfchronicle.com>STEVE SANDE, San Francisco Chronicle, 
May 23, 2004

"Not everyone understands house music. It's a spiritual thing, a body 
thing, a soul thing." -- Eddie Amador, "House Music".

Humans love to dance. I'm sure if Cro-Magnon man had stumbled across a few 
peyote buttons, stretched a piece of wooly mammoth hide across a hollowed- 
out log, picked up a stick and banged, he would have been dancing around 
the fire like a crazed banshee. What else would there be to do on a weekend 
night in a dark, cold cave in France?

Modern Homo sapiens congregate on weekend nights in dark, sweaty 
nightclubs, dancing, perhaps chanting, and ingesting God-knows-what 
inebriants, in a tribal ritual that spans the eons. The music that makes 
today's kids boogie like their early ancestors is called house. It's a form 
of electronic music -- manufactured mostly on machines and computers -- 
that's rhythmic, bass heavy, infectious and downright groovy (see sidebar, 
page 27).

These days, some of the best electronic music in the world is produced 
right here. The Bay Area is home to three pioneers -- Jay-J, Chris Smith 
and Garth. All three fell in love with the city, saw a burgeoning music 
scene in the early '90s and hit the dance floor with a purpose. Responsible 
for some of the earliest (and best) dance records of the '90s , and many of 
the most memorable parties of that time, Jay-J, Smith and Garth have 
contributed mightily to the San Francisco dance music scene. All three have 
endured the ups and downs of a highly competitive music business, as well 
as Sept. 11's negative effect on nightlife, while flying under the radar of 
mainstream commercial music. Their stories inspire with a do-it-yourself 
attitude and a truth that reflect the city's underground roots.

"The welfare of the people in particular has always been the alibi of 
tyrants, and it provides the further advantage of giving the servants of 
tyranny a good conscience."
-Albert Camus

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the 
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become 
visible."
-Jacques Attali in his seminal text "Noise"

"I loved the focus in the early days of Wicked on the pagan aspects of 
life. The natural cycles of the full moons, being out in nature, on the 
beach, free, alive, unbridled, wild and spontaneous. There is no club, 
party or other sound system that has ever achieved anything close to that..."
-Jeno, on the early days of Wicked and the Full Moon Raves

Sens. Clinton, Graham call for larger U.S. military
Former political foes strike an alliance
Monday, May 24, 2004 Posted: 8:10 AM EDT (1210 GMT)

Democrat Hillary Rodham Clinton and Republican Lindsey Graham agree the
U.S. needs a larger military.

WASHINGTON (CNN) -- An unlikely pair of Senate allies called for a
larger military Sunday and pledged a thorough investigation of abuse
against Iraqi prisoners in Baghdad.

Sens. Hillary Rodham Clinton, D-New York, and Lindsey Graham, R-South
Carolina, are both members of the Senate's Armed Services Committee.

"A number of us have been sounding this alarm. We have to face the fact
we need a larger active-duty military," Clinton told the television show
"Fox News Sunday."

"We cannot continue to stretch our troops, both active-duty, Guard and
Reserve, to the breaking point, which is what we're doing now."

Graham said the United States is "putting too much pressure on the men
and women in uniform."

"We need more of them, sooner rather than later," he said.

The senators acknowledged that an increase in the size of the military
would be an expensive venture...

Subject: RE: [sfraves] I got my Groovy on @ Mash Up!!!

first, i feel bad taht i didn:t get the chance to email out a proper thank 
you after the party!  i had to run a bunch of errands, attend a grad party 
and DJ at party....and then catch an 8am flght.

i:m emaling you all from the Apple store in in the Ginza district of Tokyo, 
Japan!  trippy, huh?

this thank you won:t do justice, but special thanks go out to everyone who 
came out to Mash-Up, the crew, the djs, my homies from evil breaks and the 
ambient mafia. i had a fantastic time and was glad to see everyone enjoying 
themselves.


i:m so scatterbrained right now.  there:s a big huge country of people on 
the other side of the window and i:m sitting here on a damn computer.  ;)

after tokyo, it:s off to beijing for a bit.  will be back in a few weeks 
with stories, photos, cool gadgets and more bootleg dvds than you can shake 
a glowstick at.

see y:ll in a bit!

Yes, Yes!!  That was my highlight moment as well!  It
was such a well done party and my friend Angelika and
I got there early 9:45pm (wanted to see the beginning
of her friend Dutch's set) - Watching the vibe of the
party from start to finish was amazing!  I seriously
timed warped back to soo many good times &
heartwarming memories but it was just nice to see
everyone dancing &  having a really good time feeling
the music.  Ethan & the Friends & Family crew created
such a nice vibe upstairs.  Great to see a lot of
familiar faces and reconnect with some people I
haven't talked to in awhile.  The SF vibe will never
die!

No cellphones?? wtf? Are you really thinking that you can take peoples'
phones from them in this day and age? That's a good one. I remember some
dipshits trying to pull that at the crackhouse once. It didn't get very far.
The rest of the event sounds cool, but seriously, who are you kidding about
the no cellphone thing? I really *really* want to see you try and enforce
that at a door.

"Sorry you can't bring your cellphone to our party" Kid says fuck you and
calls the cops on his cellphone.

You go girl.

Hi, I love Modified's parties and am looking forward to this one. I saw the  
"no cell phone" thing too, and I'm just wondering what the reasons would be 
for  this. Is it so people can't call their friends saying, "Wow, you've got to 
get  over to this bangin' party!" and then it gets too crowded? 
Or is it so people can't bypass the map point?  There is already a  much 
lower price at the map point than at the door, so people will go to the map  point 
instead of directly to the venue. 
If people have to walk back to their cars to put away their phones, that  
will increase the noticibility of the venue. If there is a shuttle involved,  
people will just say "screw it" and leave. There might be good reasons for this,  
but I don't think it will work.  
?

blah, blah, blah.

ryan,

correct me if im wrong - but have you actually been to one of our parties?
other then what you *might* have heard via the grapevine or a messageboard
here and there, you really have no idea about how modified operates, or the
crowds we are attracting.  sure, the rule may *seem* stupid - but there's a
good reason behind it.  perhaps if you got up off your insanely jaded ass,
and took a minute to talk to the promoters behind the show and really see
what's up, you might see where we are coming from and show some respect.
maybe not...but at least you would be informed about your ranting and
ravings and perhaps could provide some useful critiquing.  oh wait...it's
much more fun to just talk shit, cause talking shit is definitely what makes
the scene better!

our crowd is great, and at past events we have asked people to follow
similar "out of the ordinary" guidelines.  i am confident that once we speak
to them and explain why we are asking what we are - they will, as usual,
understand.  sure, some of them might not care, but most will continue to
respect what we ask.

I saw this reason that element had posted on another forum, and i do agree, it makes pretty good sence. I dont think it will be to successfull, cause i mean who's gonna get rid of ther cell phone... but shit, people should respect the promoters requests. i know i wont be calling anyone with info once it reaches capacity.
 
"we had people continue to show up at our last show, even after we changed the info line begging people not to come, as our parking area was full. we also stopped the music and asked the crowd not to call their friends, as we had reached capacity. people seemed to have a hard time listening, and heads continued to poor in, putting a huge amount of stress on us as promoters to be able to run things as smoothly as we needed to hold a successful event. 

its not that we hate cell phones, or lots of people showing up to our events. we just need people to look beyond partying like a rockstar - just for a second - and listen to what we need you to do to make the event successful. last time around, that didnt happen so we are asking everyone to leave their cell phones at home or in their vehicles. staff will have multiple cell phones freely available should anyone need to make an urgent call. no one will have any trouble finding the venue or getting in if they follow the directions. 

venues often get burned and promoters in trouble because people fail to respect not only the spaces, but also the guidelines promoters have set out. if people can respect those guidelines then events are less likely to get shutdown, venues less likely to get burned and promoters in less trouble. the result? more parties and better parties for everyone involved. 

<imho> 
i believe a new age of partying is among us - its all about the responsible partier. venues are much more scarce then they used to be, and times are more difficult for promoters. no longer can one show up at a giant warehouse and expect to do whatever they want with no regard to themselves, their friends, promoters or our neighbors. respect yourself and respect those around you, and perhaps we can all be part of something great.

Hi, I love Modified's parties and am looking forward to this one. I saw the
"no cell phone" thing too, and I'm just wondering what the reasons would be
for this. Is it so people can't call their friends saying, "Wow, you've got
to get over to this bangin' party!" and then it gets too crowded?
##################
yes - we had people continue to show up at our last show, even after we
changed the info line begging people not to come, as our parking area filled
by 1am. we also stopped the music and asked the crowd not to call their
friends, as we had reached capacity. people seemed to have a hard time
listening, and heads continued to poor in, putting a huge amount of stress
on us as promoters to be able to run things as smoothly as we needed to hold
a successful event.
##################

Or is it so people can't bypass the map point?  There is already a much
lower price at the map point than at the door, so people will go to the map
point instead of directly to the venue.
##################
yes - this is yet another attempt to drive people to the map point and not
just show up.  we spend time to meet people, talk to them and let them know
what we need from them at the map point so that they have the best possible
party experience.
##################

If people have to walk back to their cars to put away their phones, that
will increase the noticibility of the venue. If there is a shuttle involved,
people will just say "screw it" and leave. There might be good reasons for
this, but I don't think it will work.
##################
i hate shuttles too.  modified makes it a point to be sure our events dont
make use of shuttles. we will not be shuttling friday nite.

I'd show up at a modified party even if the infoline told me to show up
wearing ladies' panties on my head. Then again, I really like wearing
panties on my head. Bad example. I might sign a contract in blood to get
in, though. Not my blood, though. Someone unimportant's blood. Like, maybe
some guy in the tenderloin I paid three dollars and a rock to sign in
blood for me. But you know what? The THOUGHTS THERE, OK?

Mad love for modified. Every time I hit up one of their parties, I have
new faith in the scene and new love for raves. /These kids are where it's
at/. Trust me. I can smell the zeitgeist.

I'm curious as to why you couldn't have cell-phones at a party. What if 
people need to call someone for a ride, or to tell them where it is, or for 
an emergency?

I'm itching to see what the explanation is.

And I have no opinion one way or another about the crew throwing this - I 
barely even paid attention to this thread until I saw that bit. Just 
curiosity...

HAHAHAHA

You dumbass. I gave you shit about a stupid rule you included in a BSP and
you went off on a tangent about your parties. Seems like someone here is a
tad touchy about their parties and feeling a bit defensive! You still didn't
give an answer to why you're saying no cellphones. =)

HAHAHAHA

You dumbass. I gave you shit about a stupid rule you included in a BSP and
you went off on a tangent about your parties. Seems like someone here is a
tad touchy about their parties and feeling a bit defensive! You still didn't
give an answer to why you're saying no cellphones. =)

Nice try at being a smartass kid but the fact remains, you went of on a
pissy little rant and sidestepped the question until someone else copied
over your explanation from elsewhere. You got defensive and pissy and threw
out a post that made you look dumb. =)

Good luck with your no cellphones concept.

What I got from the previous email was that they did
not want people to circumvent the map point and then
rush the door. But wouldn't it just be better to have
a limited number of maps and no door availability?
That way the staff could turn people away at the map
point.  It sucks to get locked out, but the early bird
does get the worm.

Besides, are they going to search people? I don't like
that kind of vibe at parties. You might as well be the
security at 1015.  Limit access, not the party goer's
possessions. 

 My $.02...

That makes sense to me too. And damn - if the crowd you get isn't 
considerate enough to stop calling their friends to come to the party after 
you stop the music and make an announcement about it, that really sucks.

Time to get some new heads, lol.

I'm curious as to why you couldn't have cell-phones at a party.

Hi, I love Modified's parties and am looking forward to this one. I saw the
"no cell phone" thing too, and I'm just wondering what the reasons would be
for this. Is it so people can't call their friends saying, "Wow, you've got
to get over to this bangin' party!" and then it gets too crowded?
##################
yes - we had people continue to show up at our last show, even after we
changed the info line begging people not to come, as our parking area filled
by 1am. we also stopped the music and asked the crowd not to call their
friends, as we had reached capacity. people seemed to have a hard time
listening, and heads continued to poor in, putting a huge amount of stress
on us as promoters to be able to run things as smoothly as we needed to hold
a successful event.
##################

Or is it so people can't bypass the map point?  There is already a much
lower price at the map point than at the door, so people will go to the map
point instead of directly to the venue.
##################
yes - this is yet another attempt to drive people to the map point and not
just show up.  we spend time to meet people, talk to them and let them know
what we need from them at the map point so that they have the best possible
party experience.
##################

If people have to walk back to their cars to put away their phones, that
will increase the noticibility of the venue. If there is a shuttle involved,
people will just say "screw it" and leave. There might be good reasons for
this, but I don't think it will work.
##################
i hate shuttles too.  modified makes it a point to be sure our events dont
make use of shuttles. we will not be shuttling friday nite.

What I got from the previous email was that they did
not want people to circumvent the map point and then
rush the door. But wouldn't it just be better to have
a limited number of maps and no door availability?
That way the staff could turn people away at the map
point.  It sucks to get locked out, but the early bird
does get the worm.

Besides, are they going to search people? I don't like
that kind of vibe at parties. You might as well be the
security at 1015.  Limit access, not the party goer's
possessions.

 My $.02...

That just bullshit because they can't think of another way to
manage their party. Amateurs.

Wouldn't is be easier to turn people away at the door once capacity is 
reached?  Do you not have security / door people?  I'm not understanding 
how "heads continue to roll in."  Who's in control of the party?

Oh, well that explains perfectly why cell phones are not allowed...

Just FWIW, if I was told that I was not allowed to have my cellphone in 
*any* location, the next sentence out of my mouth would contain the 
words "piss" and "rope".

Needless to say, I won't be coming.

I infer from the discussion that element wishes to avoid a situation that 
all of us who still use map points have experienced:  once folks get the 
address at the map point they call their friends, who call their friends, 
and everyone bypasses the map point and goes directly to the venue.  At our 
last event nearly fifty percent of the guests went directly to the 
venue.  We use a map point to provide an additional layer of security for 
the venue at an underground.  The actual address is less likely to fall 
into unfriendly hands, and we avoid lines of people standing outside 
without tickets hoping to get in.  Next time we do a party we will give 
direction slips to all ticket holders at the mp and require all guests to 
show the map point directions at the door or they won't get in.

However, there must be some other reason for a cell phone ban at the 
venue.  Banning cell phones inside is not going to eliminate the problem of 
having people phone the venue location to their friends from the car.  Who 
knows?

As I have said before, I now refuse to go to any party, club or otherwise, 
where I will be searched in any fashion.  I struggle with this because I'm 
missing lots of good music but that's where I've decided to take a 
stand.  Just can't deal with pat downs and the like.

Love,

Apollo

Looking for something fun and relaxing to do this weekend? Wanna go out and
enjoy the holiday, but sick of the predictable club experiences on offer?

Echo beach - Memorial Day Weekend Sunday - NO COVER!

DJs Garth and Jeno, two of San  Francisco's most
respected djs rise from the ashes of Wicked's 13
year reign of glory to begin a new musical adventure
at the indoor/outdoor club/restaurant - Bambuddha
Lounge.

Pulling from their extensive collections of underground disco,
new wave, rock, soul, jazz and reggae, Garth and Jeno bring the
heads out for a unique, experimental & soul warming musical
adventure around the Phoenix Hotel's muraled pool. "We've
always been known for throwing in some old disco, funk, new
wave, dubby trippiness or other unorthodox musical
inspiration while we spin," Jenö says. "This party is an
opportunity to pursue those other possibilities with more fervor
as we will be expressing ourselves outside the accepted and
usually quite safe musical formats of the current SF club
scene." So, expect the unexpected...!


Also enjoy the outdoor BBQ provided by Bambuddha's Rising Star Chef Joe
Bosworth.

There will be NO COVER for this all ages Sunday afternoon soiree, and we 
will be open all afternoon and evening from 2 until 10pm.

Bambuddha Lounge is located @ 601 Eddy Street (at Larkin), San
Francisco, CA; 415-885-5088

Just curious, but why do you feel that way?=20

Sadly, I don't think we're too far away from a time where suicide =
bombers enter a busy club and blow the whole place up. I would rather =
everyone get a small pat down, hell, maybe security should just be a big =
giant hug to each person entering.

Precisely why I got on the kid's ass about no cellphones. Causes more
problems and solves nothing. Especially when you figure that most people
will hear about the party as word of mouth and never see a BSP stating that
they can't have a cellphone. All of a sudden you have people showing up at
the party that are finding out they can't have their cellphone with them.
That's going to cause drama at the door. Drama is going to mean more
attention drawn to the party. Pissing people off that are coming to your
party potentially results in a vengeful call to the police and the end of
your event.

If I wanted to be hardcore about people not calling friends it would be
easy. Shuttle people in a van with blacked out windows. Drive a route that
is longer, has more turns than needed, but thoroughly confuses the
passengers. When they arrive, and if it's a place that no one has been to,
most likely they won't have a clue as to where they are and thus calling
friends does them no good.

The fact is that there is no real solid answer to the problem of people
revealing a party location. Well, there is one. You only invite people that
you know are mindful of the type of event they're going to. From what it
sounds like this event caters to a bunch of people that have no clue how to
act in a renegade//ug environment. This is why selective promoting is great
and part of that includes not posting to SFR, F8, BayRaves, DJ-D list,
etc... =)

Prior to the late nineties one could go any club or event, produce an ID at 
the door, often get a hug and smile from the door person, and go inside 
feeling like an honored guest and not some potential criminal.  Ins and 
outs were the rule and, again, one didn't have to go into another line for 
pat downs to get back in.  My vibe was intact when I went in the door.  I 
felt welcome.

I am told by many club owners that the current invasive system is designed 
to comply with anti-drug efforts at clubs and the like.  Well, as any drug 
entrepreneur knows, unless one were to initiate strip and cavity searches 
on the street these pat downs become symbolic gestures to placate the 
police.  Seems to me that the requirement for enforcement of what many 
believe unenforceable drug prohibitions have fallen on the venue owners and 
promoters and we are all suffering from these feeble and personally 
humiliating attempts to control the uncontrollable.  The war on drugs is a 
dismal failure and has morphed into a war on American citizens.

This club security situation is, to me, a microcosm of the fearful trend in 
our society to sacrifice freedom for security.  Those who agree to this end 
up with neither.  I've had security people go into my wallet;  confiscate 
open packs of cigarettes;  take boxes of mints; require me to empty the 
many pockets in my cargo pants in full view of other patrons.  After these 
assaults on my privacy and theft of my personal property I became 
increasingly unhappy and angry and decided I would no longer consent to 
violations of personal freedoms.  Shit, by the time I went through all this 
my attitude was dark and aggressive.  My partner is even worse.

As for worries about terrorist bombings, well, freedom involves risk, often 
great risk.  I would rather have freedom than some false assurance of 
safety.  If some terrorist wants to find a way to blow me into that great 
dancefloor in the sky no thug security person is going to prevent that.

I have gone to selected hip hop events where it is assumed some guests 
might be packing.  At these events they have unintrusive metal 
detectors.  No stranger runs their hands up and down your legs and 
ass.  Hot or not, I don't really appreciate that kind of personal attention:)

Love,

Apollo,

	Well spoken! I haven't completely drawn the "no searches" line in the 
sand myself, but I certainly empathize with the sentiment. We'll make a 
libertarian out of you yet!  8)

	On the other hand, I like Steve O's suggestion of a mandatory security 
hug at the door. If the hug was announced in advance, and it had to be 
a warm hug from someone of the same gender, that might keep out a lot 
of bad elements.

Groove on,

I dont beleive they really expected every single person to leave their phone in the car. I think this was more of a way to discourage the use of cell phones. I mean i dont see why its such a big deal. If you want to bring it in im sure your not going to be turned away, as there will be no searches. But it is nice to help out with a promoters request, even if you dont see how it will help anything, its not your party... people at are guests and should behave accordingly. Especially somthing as fragile as a ug party, because people are putting their ass's on the line for your enjoyment, and for 3 bux you know they arent making any money. No need for people to bich about a simple request. Just my opinion... im going to leave my phone in the car.....

Subject: [sfraves] Review: Secret Psychedelica: 3 Year Anniversary

3 wonderful years and counting....

Last night was hands down one of the most intensely beautiful nights
I've had at the Savoy in Santa Clara. The decorations were absolutely
marvelous, gorgeous and striking, the people were full of amazing energy,
bliss and happiness, and the music was pumping a vibe that meticulously
vibrated both my soul and my eardrums.

The drinks, as always were delectable, mixed and served with the greatest
of pleasure well deserved of an aficionado's mark of distinction, as
usual, grand and fantastique.

The staff at the Savoy as always are pleasant, fun, absolutely inspiring
and a joy to talk to, as well as see.

The crews involved in this event evoke a high degree of professionalism,
fun, brilliant energy and smiles everywhere you turn. Thank you kindly for
building this night into what it deserves to be: An excellent, creative,
sweet delight to every sense imaginable, sight, sound abounds all around.

Two rooms filled with varied beats of flavored intensity, from downtempo
to psytrance, per the intense flava du nuit, the audible bliss was as
Delectable as an Epicurean delight. Music of the World melodically thumped
a harmony of symphonic amplitude - treating the heat of beats with S>Range
from Gothenburg, Sweden, Aeon of Santa Cruz/San Lorenzo Valley to Dutch of
the East Bay and beyond, including Instrumental Ward (live) and DJs Manx,
Saturnia, and Noah.

The Viberation Graphics visuals were colorful, intense and richly
beautiful eye candy. Thank you Terry! Your creativity shines through in
the most graphic of ways, yum! There are over 200 still images capturing
each memory in the freeze frame of a moment available for your viewing
pleasure.  Inquire within.

Sweet smiles and much love, to all who were treated to the dessert of the
week: As I left, I felt the kiss of bliss, there's nothing like this.

La paix,

Karina

Sometimes you have to miss out on the fun to stand for what you believe
in. I agree with Apollo when he speaks of violations of person and
property. If I have to show more than ID I turn around and leave. I have
missed out on some amazing talent this year because I have stood by this
belief. I just missed Derrick Carter this last weekend for this very
reason. But then turned around I headed to a club with no door search
policy and got my groove on to Tortured Soul. It is important to stand
up for what you believe to be right and wrong.

HIYEEEE Karina~!!!!!!  and everyone!!!!  :-)
 
Yeah, Last nite at the Savoy, I couldn't believe the crowd that was there.  It was soooooo great to see all the people dancing and talking.  

Since I haven't been out in a long time, I am nervous about going to parties and socializing.  I am all out of practice. hehehe ;-)  It was great to see a lot of the regulars though; as well as dancing a little.  Well, I hope to get out more often and hope to see all of ya soon!  

Love and Friendship Forever,
~~Tami :-)

Heh, when I'm cranky I do this at CompUSA and they always go
ballistic. But they can't stop me without actual suspicion
of theft.

Then they say, "You can't come back, you're not welcome here
anymore."

And I smile and say: "With this store's security turnover
rate, I very much doubt you'll be working here when I come
back." And they never are.

Don't give your rights away.

Subject: [sfraves] NRR:  MDMA/PTSD review in journal Nature

--=====================_5666047==.ALT
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"; format=flowed

MDMA/PTSD review in journal 'Nature'
Courtesy MAPS <http://www.maps.org>www.maps.org

The highly respected scientific journal Nature has published a
long news story as well as an editorial about MDMA/PTSD (post
traumatic stress disorder) research, both of which are supportive
of MAPS' research. The article, editorial and lengthy comments
by Rick Doblin can be found on the MAPS website on our
MDMA page (<http://www.maps.org/mdma>http://www.maps.org/mdma) under the 
entry for
May 13, 2004.

The article contains a startlingly historic admission by Dr. Una
McCann who, along with her husband Dr. George Ricaurte, have
been the most prominent proponents for the neurotoxic risks of
MDMA. She says that she "initially
gave the study [MAPS' MDMA/PTSD protocol] her tentative
backing, believing that it would be conducted in a hospital. But
when she later learned that it would be run in a psychiatrist's
office, she expressed misgivings." While Una can't quite come
around to saying that she supports the study, her statement says
that she, and presumably also George Ricaurte, did not think that
concerns over neurotoxicity should stop the study. This
admission confirms that we have come to the end to the era of
using fears over the risks of neurotoxicity to stop MDMA
psychotherapy research.  Dr. McCann's concerns over the setting
of the study have been addressed to the satisfaction of the FDA,
the IRB and experts in emergency medicine, which is not Dr.
McCann's area of expertise.

In an effort to seem balanced, the article presents
McCann/Ricaurte's discredited Lancet PET study about MDMA
serotonergic neurotoxicity as the last word on the topic, not even
mentioning the larger and better controlled study by Buchert that
failed to confirm the McCann/Ricaurte results.

Ironically, network TV, in Peter Jennings' documentary "Ecstasy
Rising," does a better job of reviewing the science than one of
the world's foremost scientific journals."

rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become

-Jacques Attali in his seminal text "Noise"

"I loved the focus in the early days of Wicked on the pagan aspects of 
life. The natural cycles of the full moons, being out in nature, on the 
beach, free, alive, unbridled, wild and spontaneous. There is no club, 
party or other sound system that has ever achieved anything close to that..."

<snip>As for worries about terrorist bombings, well,
freedom involves risk, 
often 
great risk.  I would rather have freedom than some
false assurance of 
safety.  If some terrorist wants to find a way to blow
me into that 
great 
dancefloor in the sky no thug security person is going
to prevent that.</snip>

Amen.

And I might add: although it's not rave or dance
related, the terrorists didn't close the bathrooms on
Bart, Bart did, I am certainly not more free in a
country where I now have to choose between using
public transit and having a place to pee... 
I'm scared now, and It's not of terrorists...

FYI Muni closed some of its underground restrooms (at
least in Church and Castro St.) about 5 years ago because
they weren't ADA compliant. They wouldn't accomodate the
disabled so they just shut down the restrooms entirely.

BART and Muni both suck my ass on the restroom thing.

Yeah, 1015 for Ascension was really nice... I don't think I have ever
been to such a nice event at a large club space.  Security was cool.  People
were cool.  No slimey club vibe... it felt more like a Burning Man vibe.

Subject: [sfraves] BSP: Shazbot @ BAD KITTY Thursday

I know, I know... there's this lovey-dovey benefit going down at the
Sublounge with a ton of well-known DJs and the entire rave scene hipster
collective is going to be there.

But if you want to hear something new and *different*, something a bit
naughty and dirty, or if you're just a broke-ass mofo that can't swing
the cab fare, come down to Anu Thursday night for BAD KITTY. I'll be on
'round 11:30 bringing a dastardly mix of nasty minimal techno, acid
house, some electro("clash"), and all sorts of weird stuff.

So here's your choice:

Party with a bunch of patchouli-scented ravers to music that you can
hear any other night of the week, way out in China Basin...

OR:

Rock out with your cock out to some funky shit you ain't never heard
before, and have a nice conversation with a Mission crackhead on your
way out.

I trust you'll make the right decision.

Cheers,

Subject: [sfraves] (POL) Is anyone else ready for a change?

Do you feel that the choice between Kerry and Bush is really no choice 
at all? That the United States isn't close to your own ideals anymore? 
Do you consider yourself a San Franciscan first and foremost and have 
reservations about calling yourself an American? If so, then join us 
tomorrow night for a pot-luck meeting as we gather to discuss how we 
can get the Free City ballot measure on the ballot. We need all the 
help we can get and would love input from everyone that's interested. 
We'll be meeting at Len's house in the Mission tomorrow (Thursday 27th) 
at 7:30PM to try to get this measure on the ballot -- so if you'd like 
to come, please send me an e-mail and I'll get the directions to you...

here's the ballot measure we're working to get on the ballot for 
November 2nd:

The United Neighborhoods of San Francisco
  Declaration of Independence

  When in the course of human events, it becomes necessary for one 
people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with 
another and to assume among the powers of the earth the separate and 
equal station to which their humanity entitles them, a decent respect 
to the opinions of humankind requires that they should declare the 
causes which impel them to the separation.

  We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all people are equal, 
that they are endowed with certain unalienable rights, that among these 
are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness; that to secure these 
rights, governments are instituted among people, deriving their just 
powers from the consent of the governed; that whenever any form of 
government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the right of the 
people to alter or to abolish it and to institute new government, 
laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in 
such form as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and 
happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that governments long 
established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and 
accordingly all experience has shown that people are more disposed to 
suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by 
abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long 
train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same object 
evinces a design to reduce them under absolute despotism, it is their 
right, it is their duty, to throw off such government, and to provide 
new guards for their future security.

  Such has been the patient sufferance of the people of this city; and 
such is now the necessity which constrains us to alter our former 
systems of government. The history of the past and present 
administrations of the United States of America is a history of 
repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the 
establishment of an absolute tyranny over the people of this city, 
these states, and the world. To prove this, let facts be submitted to a 
candid world.

  The government of the United States of America has refused its assent 
to that social behavior which is the most wholesome and necessary for 
the public good.

  It has through the prosecution of treaties refused to make 
accommodations for entire nations of people, unless those people would 
relinquish the right of labor representation, and other rights 
inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.

  It has called together policy-making bodies at places unusual, 
uncomfortable, and distant from the people of its own and other 
nations, for the sole purpose of conducting business pertaining to the 
affairs of other peoples in secrecy, absent both their presence and 
their voice.

  It has obstructed the administration of justice, by refusing its 
assent to international law.

  It has made judges the selectors of its highest elected office and is 
itself a government which serves corporations, not its people.

  It has created a multitude of new offices in its Department of 
Homeland Security, and sent hither swarms of officers to harass and spy 
upon the people.

  It has persisted, even in times of peace, in building and developing 
weapons of the most obscene descriptions and marketing them as a source 
for profit to nations around the world.

  It has created self-admitted shadow governments and various agencies 
engaged in spying, subterfuge of all kinds, and self-confessed criminal 
activities including assassinations and the overthrow of the lawful 
governments of other nations.

  It has combined with others to subject peoples throughout the world to 
a jurisdiction foreign to their constitution and unacknowledged by 
their laws; giving assent to acts of pretended legislation.

  It has deposited toxic materials throughout the earth and within the 
territory of our own city and has refused to clean up its poisonings 
here and elsewhere.

  It has shielded the criminals in its midst, even from prosecution by 
international bodies, has violated international conventions, and has 
refused to join as an equal with other nations in the creation of 
international bodies and agreements designed to end war crimes, the 
exploitation of children, and to protect human rights and our common 
environment.

  It has destroyed its own small business people and small farmers while 
ensuring the health of major corporations through billions of dollars 
in direct subsidies.

  It has used our share of its taxes in ways that we, the citizens of 
San Francisco, do not support, including the waging of offensive wars.

  It has demonstrated a system of justice which is inequitable, racist, 
and classist as evidenced by the disproportionate numbers of minorities 
and the poor which inhabit its single growth industry: prisons.

  It has transported people across seas to be held without trial for 
pretended offences.

  It has invalidated our decisions in matters of our own sovereign 
concern, attempted to abolish our most valuable laws, and expresses 
fundamental hostility to the forms of our society.

  It has ignored or suspended our own legislative acts and the actions 
of our elected officials, declaring itself invested with power to 
legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.

  It is at this time transporting large armies of regular Soldiers and 
Mercenaries to complete the works of death, desolation and tyranny 
already begun with circumstances of cruelty and perfidy scarcely 
paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy of a 
civilized nation.

  It has constrained sovereign peoples taken captive to betray and bear 
arms against their country, to become the executioners of their friends 
and neighbors, or to fall themselves by their hands.

  Amongst these many general abuses it has suborned and denied the 
sovereign will of the citizens of the City of San Francisco in five 
critical ways:

  1. Against our firm resolve to not persecute its wars of aggression, 
it has utilized our taxes for these purposes, recruited the youth of 
our city to fight in its armies, moved war materials through our port, 
contaminated our land, and has failed in its acknowledged duty to 
recover the damages done.

  2. Against our decision and progressive implementation of a model 
system for administering medical marijuana, a plant recognized in 
providing safe and effective relief from a variety of conditions, and 
in opposition to the mutual wishes of physicians and patients, it has 
raided, arrested, and prosecuted individuals and groups acting in full 
compliance with state and local law.

  3. It has chosen to stand against the general desires of the people of 
San Francisco and the executive action of its Mayor in attempting to 
limit marriage and its multitude of benefits to heterosexuals to the 
degree of consideration and proposal of a Constitutional Amendment.

  4. In violation of its own Constitution, it has instituted the PATRIOT 
Act, trampling on the basic rights of due process and privacy, further 
weakening the already limited freedoms of speech, inquiry, association, 
and legal representation. Without warrant or witness, crimes against 
the common citizen can be pursued under the guise of National Security, 
claiming the name of justice but without evidence of cause. We, the 
people of San Francisco, have repudiated this act and its 
administration through the resolution of the Board of Supervisors and 
the direct vote of the people, instructing non-compliance by city civil 
servants who are directed to refer PATRIOT act requests to the Board of 
Supervisors for decision, thereby placing our citizens in grave 
conflict between performance of just and lawful actions and the illegal 
actions of a more powerful state which assumes sovereignty over us.

  5. As a city that considers itself a member of the international 
community and supports both universal health care and the International 
Declaration of Human Rights, the disregard of the United States of 
America for the welfare of its own people stands in strong 
contradiction to both our own principles of a just society and to 
international understandings we share with the remainder of the world.

  We, therefore, as representatives of the United Neighborhoods of San 
Francisco, in general congress assembled, appealing to the peoples of 
the world and their communities for the rectitude of our intentions, 
do, in the name, and by the authority of the good people of this city, 
solemnly publish and declare: that these United Neighborhoods are, and 
of right ought to be, a free and independent city; that they are 
absolved from all allegiance to the US corporate crown; and that all 
political connection between them and the United States of America, is, 
and ought to be, totally dissolved; and that as a free and independent 
city, these United Neighborhoods have full power to levy peace, 
conclude war, contract alliances, establish commerce, and to do all 
other acts and things which independent states may of right do. And for 
the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection 
of Providence, we mutually pledge to each other, our lives, our 
fortunes and our sacred honor.

  We instruct the Board of Supervisors of the city and county of San 
Francisco and all other appropriate legal representatives of this city, 
to amend the City Charter in all such ways as are required in order to 
establish and clarify the lawful standing of the United Neighborhood of 
San Francisco as a sovereign nation per this Declaration and to inform 
the government of the United States of America of our separate and 
sovereign status in a timely and appropriate manner.

hehe

kinda made me smile in that , I couldn't fight it back it I had to way.
I haven't driven my truck really in like 4 or so years. It was my very =
first street legal vehicle.=20
A 91 Chevy ck1500 longbed pickup. It's one tough ass truck.  Jumped it, =
cased it on berms hard, hauled crap everywhere, off road wherever =
possible including lawns and sidewalks, even got rear ended 3x, and some =
dumb ass lady in her bf's jaguar destroyed the r side of my bed and the =
wheel and axle n other parts at the expense of her bf's inunsured entire =
front end of his expensive jaguar (hehe). Most all of thats fixed =
besides an unpainted roll pan and a dented tailgate. Everything else is =
percectly str8, some blemishes on the paint.=20
Lately I got a transmission from some guy on ebay and it turned out to =
be a big piece of shit, so had another built for me for like $1900. That =
was the main issue. I had to rebuild the brakes, plugs wires, stereo =
system, new lights, rear circuit boards, engine and radiator flushed, =
etc, new tires. . .
Now it runs better than ever. . .I totally love my truck. . .

my civic on the other hand is a lil matchbox project car now. . . I =
found a car trailer big enough to fit my long ass truck a while ago and =
had it all rewired. . .so I'm not trippin of not having it running if I =
need to move it here or there. Cool trailer too, 4 wheel, its own =
braking system, cool way of loading the ramps n such. Has one dent tho =
on a fender, but it was pretty much free. found it in the lot by my old =
job, just took the pallets off it that my friend loaded on for no reason =
and hooked it up. Since it didn't have any id number or anything on it, =
it was basically fair game. To register it I just had to go to aaa and =
they assign a new # and it's all good. . .

cool stuff

: )

---1st we'll be over @ the Benefit goin' on @ Sublounge 4 Bob 'cause I'm told that I'll be ?MCing that event? 4 a few hours (not MC DUHster stylee 'cause I can't ragga rap in a british accent like he can 2 save my life), but i might sing a lil' if the mood stricks me kinda Audio Angel stylee if i can match my voice tones 2 whatever music's playing... LoL

---then somehow we plan 2 end up @ Bad Kitty around 11 something 2 hear some of Shazbot's "unusual" set, this set will definetely be fun & it's always a Dope place 2 meet some1 from FRIENDSTER there who've you've never met IRL...

---then venture through the alley way 2 go 2 Urban Montage @ Cloud 9 4 some Jungle delights & some house...

"The welfare of the people in particular has always been the alibi of 
tyrants, and it provides the further advantage of giving the servants of 
tyranny a good conscience."
-Albert Camus

"Music is prophecy, its style and economic organization are ahead of the 
rest of society. It makes audible the new world that will gradually become 
visible."
-Jacques Attali in his seminal text "Noise"

"I loved the focus in the early days of Wicked on the pagan aspects of 
life. The natural cycles of the full moons, being out in nature, on the 
beach, free, alive, unbridled, wild and spontaneous. There is no club, 
party or other sound system that has ever achieved anything close to that..."

Yeah- I've thought about this in the context of "all of California"-
But yeah, I wonder what the rest of the country's response would be?

The first needed step would be to arm every San Francisco (or CA) 
resident with their own AK-47, and train them how to use it.
Without that, this is fantasyland :)

hello, this is a continuation of a fictional piece:
 
"i really like funk."
"do you?"
"yes, i like funk, and you know what else?"
"no,  what else?"
"things sure cost a lot in l.a."
"maybe that is because YOU don't know where to shop yet."
"yes, maybe."
"say, are you a man or a woman?"
"that is none of your business. what about you."
"i am not going to release a thing." :)

Thank you all for expressing your support -- in order for this to 
happen we will need to get over 10,000 signatures -- your support in 
this endeavor is both encouraged and requested. A new world is 
possible, but the 5 or 6 of us can't do this alone. Please think about 
trying to make it to the meeting tomorrow night -- c'mon -- it'll be a 
pot luck -- it'll be fun! We're meeting at a house in the Mission 
around 7:30PM if you think you can make it please e-mail me and I'll 
get you the directions...

Josh

hello, this is a continuation of a fictional piece:
 
when supa baby turned seventeen, there were more running thoughts going through the supa mind: when will people realize that i am no longer a baby any more? i am now really close to being a legal adult. i hate being called supa baby at dinner in front of all of my friends and relatives. sigh....i wonder when i will get my own car. i know that i don't need one, but since i am an american in this story, i need one, and i have to have one now. this is a year too late for me not to have an suv. i wonder what ig is doing today. i am so glad that i am emancipated. :)

Subject: Re: [sfraves] UNSF Declaration of Independence

I think you may be misreading the lack of interest in
any specific ballot measure as support from the city
government...but anyway...

It might be worth noting that essentially all of San
Francisco's water, food, and energy resources come
from outside the city.  Not to mention issues about
employment (try getting a visa to the U.S. these
days), funding of city services such as police and
schools by the state, and more.  I doubt the city
officials would be as "positive" about your efforts
once they realized it meant they wouldn't have jobs or
possibly even food and water if it was passed.

In my experience walking away from problems never
solves them.  And usually the further you run the
worse it gets.  Constructive engagement is more
difficult and often seems totally frustrating and
hopeless.  But it really is the only path to
meaningful change.  

Peace,

Peter

Subject: [sfraves] NRR: SF's Secession from the Union

-------------------------------1085762966
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="US-ASCII"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

There is indeed a precedent for a California municipality to secede from the  
Union, so San Francisco wouldn't be the first:  
"The only mining town to 'secede' from the Union and the Territory of  
California then to vote itself back in is the town of Rough And Ready. Populated  
mostly by miners from the state of Wisconsin hoping to rid themselves of any and 
 all outside laws and other restrictions, it was decided in a town meeting in 
 1850 to take the drastic step of secession. All this came to an abrupt halt  
when, preparing for a fourth of July celebration, it was realized the  
independent country of Rough And Ready, no longer a part of the United States,  had 
no reason to celebrate. Something had to be done even if it meant restoring  
the new Republic to the United States. This was done by popular vote followed 
by  the most riotous Fourth celebration ever held anywhere." _Rough and Ready - 
 California Ghost Town_ 
(http://www.ghosttowns.com/states/ca/roughandready.html)   (The people up that way are still pretty  independently minded)  
That's the local spin. What I've read elsewhere is that the U.S. was annoyed  
at the little town and refused to deliver the mail. That put a stop to the  
little experiment at independence.  
I'd be a little afraid that if San Francisco were to declare its  
independence, it wouldn't be long before we had a few nukes lobbed our  way!  :-P   The 
US has never had a chance to use the "neutron  bomb," which would preserve the 
physical assets while getting rid of all the  nasty left-leaning residents. 
Everyone, have a safe Memorial Day weekend.

Subject: Re: [sfraves] UNSF Declaration of Independence

I think you may be right on that note -- but if nothing else, they 
aren't trying to derail it from getting on the ballot. They had 15 
working days to respond with the official ballot title and summary -- 
they had it back in our hands in less than 3.

In regards to power, I'm not sure what percent of our power comes from 
outside the city, but I'll look into it. I don't think that the US is 
liable to close our borders and not allow food to be imported so I'm 
not too concerned about that one. And in regards to water, from what 
I've heard, the city of San Francisco owns the Hetch Hetchy dam where 
our water comes from so that shouldn't be an issue.

As far as economics is concerned -- the measure is written in such a 
manner as to break off from the federal government but not the state 
government. Yes, I realize that separating from the one implies the 
other but the legal interpretation of that would be up to the state of 
California. Theoretically the state money could still be available to 
help pay for services and our tax dollars would still be going to help 
the state maintain it's "Budget." On the federal side of things -- the 
good people of San Francisco and our businesses have collectively spent 
over 300 million dollars on the war in Iraq and that money could easily 
be better spent towards city services and perhaps more importantly 
towards our school's declining budgets.

My experience of running away from problems has been similar to yours 
Peter and while I would not normally suggest that leaving the existing 
system, or running away, is a sensible or effective thing to do, I no 
longer feel that there are any real avenues for change available to the 
people of this country.

Prior to the Iraqi war millions of people took to the streets to 
demonstrate against Bush's proposed war and governments throughout the 
world expressed there official disapproval for the action, but on March 
19th 2003 we found ourselves in a war we didn't approve and don't 
support. Amongst the democratic choices for president, we've been left 
with John Kerry, a politician only slightly to the left of Bush, a 
supporter of the war in Iraq, and an advocate for reinstating the 
draft.

Peter, I'm not in favor of running from our problems anymore then you 
are, but please share with me, what else we as a people can do to alter 
this collision course we've embarked upon. I really don't see this 
ballot measure as just about running away from problems -- moving to 
Canada would be -- I see this measure as a means to engage the federal 
government into a discourse that they've managed to avoid through 
today. The world says no to war, but the US government has continually 
turned its head away and to pretend not to hear the voice of dissent. 
It is my hope, that through this measure that the US finally begins to 
listen and its the best approach that I've been able to come up with.

If you have any other suggestions for how we can create real and 
lasting change Peter, I'd love to hear it. Please share your thoughts 
on what we can do to realize constructive engagement and embark on the 
path of real change that you've described for me.

Josh

I am just wondering really, man the practical problems
are huge for sucession though. Water, electricity
goods and services all essentially come out of state,
esp outside of SF. 

But it is a start. California can't get any love from
the Union, perhaps it may be time for this to become a
movement. Interesting protest!

Alameda has their own phone, power & cable & shit - why couldn't a bigger

I'm no urban planner, so honestly I don't pretend to have clue one as to the

TONIGHT
Come experience San Francisco's
NIGHTLIFE
www.sfclubnightlife.com

Tony Hewitt (www.tangorecordings.com)
San Francisco (Tango / Nightshift / Detour) There is no need for
introduction here. Tony has been one of the staple figures in the San
Francisco scene for the last 10 years. Playing at all the local events from
The Gathering to Funky Techno Tribe. He tears up the floor with his tough
west coast house sound that we have all learned to love. Check out Tony as
he celebrates his latest release on Tango with the "Company Three EP".

Jazz-e (www.jazz-e.com)
San Francisco (EMI / APG / Urbanloops)
With over 20 years experience Jazz-e began spinning at the ripe age of 9. He
blends a range of styles of house, vocal house, and techno. From funky
chunky to hard banging funk infused techno style beats with a touch of
breaks. He is a dj that knows how to motivate a crowd with uplifting music.
He has played all across the U.S. Canada, Mexico and the bay area, from
Spundae, Release, End-up, and many more. After a year of touring check him
out as he makes his first appearance in San Francisco in over a year.

Tim-e
San Francisco (Universal Beat Co / KickDown) Tim-E is a serious up and
coming house dj from the bay area. He stands out from the rest because of
his versatility and his ability to read a crowd. He does not just bring one
sound to the decks like most dj's. He drops tracks that are funky, chunky,
disco, tweaked out tribal, to your deep, soulful, grooving house sounds. His
ability to change styles and do it well has caught the eyes of dj's and
promoters alike.

NIGHTLIFE is held @ AsiaSF in San Francisco AsiaSF is located @ 201 9th
Street at the corner of 9th and Howard Doors open at 10:00pm and goes till

Sunday, May 30, 2004 ** echo beach summer monthly **

Starting Sunday May 30th, DJs Garth and Jeno, two of San Francisco's most
respected djs formerly of Wicked, explore a new musical direction with
their new mothly poolside party, Echo Beach, at the Bambuddha Lounge.

Pulling from their extensive collections of underground disco, new wave, ro=
ck,
soul, jazz and reggae, Garth and Jeno bring the heads out for a soul-soothi=
ng
musical backdrop around the Phoenix Hotel's muraled pool.

"We've always been known for throwing in some old disco, funk, new
wave, dubby trippiness or other unorthodox musical inspiration while we
spin," Jen=F6 says. "This party is an opportunity to pursue those other
possibilities with more fervor as we will be expressing ourselves outside
the accepted and usually quite safe musical formats of the current SF club
scene."

Event Date: May 30 2004 and every last sunday of the month all summer

Event Name: Echo Beach

Venue: Bambuddha Lounge; 601 Eddy Street (at Larkin), San Francisco, CA;
415-885-5088;

DJ's: Garth and Jeno (formerly of Wicked)

Musical Style: ECLECTIC - mix of underground disco, new wave, rock, soul, r=
eggae and
melodic house

Bio: MAURICIO AVILES
Born in the capitol of El Salvador in 1969, Mauricio Aviles immigrated with=
 his parents to San Francisco, California in 1973. Growing up in the Missio=
n District, he was constantly surrounded by the latin rhythms of the barrio=
=2E His father had a company that produced theatrical and musical events th=
at featured 'la cultura latina', and eventually Mauricio became involved wi=
th his father's creative enterprise, helping to produce several festivals a=
nd concerts in the Bay Area. The people and the music of this period provid=
ed the foundation for Mauricio's involvement in the City's burgeoning dance=
 scene that evolved throughout the 90's.
As a dj Mauricio's first actual gigs began at the City's bastion of undergr=
ound vibration, the EndUp. As a protege of Arron Olivares, Mauricio began f=
orming his own sounds and creating a devoted following that are still with =
him today. His next regular residencies were simultaneously Corazon, a lati=
n flavored weekly in the heart of the Mission District, and Metrojazz a ver=
y popular and original weekend event that successfully combined down tempo,=
 abstract beats and house, a hybrid that would eventually become to describ=
e the 'San Francisco Sound'.   Acknowledging the urban, afro origins of dan=
ce music, with a personal blend of his own latino roots, and a constant end=
eavor to break new ground, Mauricio's sound is hauntingly personal, emotion=
al and consistently fresh. Creating a niche within the deep house sound, hi=
s style, though ethereal, is undeniably funky and always elicits a great re=
sponse on the dance floor.  Now with an internationally successful compilat=
ion under his belt (Naked Music's Nude Dimension II), Mauricio has begun hi=
s production career with a debut single slated for release in Summer 2001. =
As an emissary for Naked Music, Mauricio has also commenced a global tour, =
ensuring that America's hottest new dance label is well represented.  Mauri=
cio has of late done production work and dj=92d under the moniker of MOVIDO=
, his project with collaborator and Loveslap label founder Charles Spencer.

Bio: DAVID HARNESS
In 1990, David began DJ'ing in his hometown of Monterey, California, at the=
 After Dark. As his popularity grew past the boundaries of Monterey, he was=
 invited to establish a residency at Tilt, and Sound Factory, in San Franci=
sco. In 1992, as David's popularity continued to grow he, along with DJ, Ru=
ben Mancias and promoter Joseph Solis opened a hip and popular club, Lift, =
at Club Dv8. David joined Bay Area legendary DJ, Pete Avila and host Foxxee=
 Brown on 'Your Mama's House', on the Bay Area's popular radio station KMEL=
 FM. Being the only "true" house mix show on any Northern California radio =
station, DJ's David Harness, Pete Avila and host Foxxee Brown have played a=
 key role in furthering House Music in the Bay Area. Also during that year,=
 David established a residency at San Francisco's legendary Club Universe. =
David Harness has quickly become one of the most well known and popular DJ'=
s in the San Francisco Bay Area club scene. David's popularity continued to=
 soar, taking him around the world; and the opportunity to play with New Yo=
rk's Legendary DJ's, Frankie Knuckles, Tony Humphries, Little Louie Vega, T=
edd Patterson, Dave Morales, London's Ricky Morrison, Danny Teneglia, Marqu=
es Wyatt- to name a few. He has appeared in articles and interviews in Bill=

heap of disco, and a hint of techno, and you have the most nutritious dance=
floor experience available in San Francisco. Initially conceived by Dianna =
Jacobs and Nori Castillo of Toontown /  Carefree fame in the summer of '96,=
 Loveworks was envisioned as a refuge from the monotony of local clubs and =
superficial music, and  has become one of the bay area's most well known ni=
ghts out, while somehow remaining one it's best kept secrets.  It exists to=
 unite people of any race, social status or sexuality together in a comfort=
able and friendly club environment with music as the focal point, and in ad=
dition to it's monthly parties at the Minna Gallery, Loveworks also teams u=
p with other like minded parties around the city and has been featured at c=
lubs and parties such as Liquid, the Top, Electric, and the Endup.  Besides=
 late night dancing, Loveworks has also been involved in events for Wired M=
agazine, Apple Computer, Sony Digital, Construct Internet Design, and a hos=
t of others. Loveworks also had the honor of winning the SF Bay Guardian=92=
s =91 BEST HOUSE CLUB =91 in 1999.


Bio: 111 MINNA GALLERY
111 Minna Gallery is a dynamic =91contemporary art salon=92 that provides a=
n arena for multi-dimensional artistic expression in a community atmosphere=
=2E The goal of the =91gallery-as salon=92 concept is to nurture and suppor=
t a communal gathering of artists and a collaboration between diverse art f=
orms. This goal is achieved through six-week rotations of visual art exhibi=
tions curated by the staff combined with a variety of music and film events=
=2E =91Minna=92 is not only the name of the street on which the gallery is =
found but also translates from Japanese as "everybody," an all-inclusive te=
rm that symbolizes the embracing environment of the space. The gallery, whi=
ch also offers two bars, is crafted in an eclectic, contemporary design wit=
h ample furniture inviting guests to leisurely relax and enjoy conversation=
 among friends. The combination of art, music, film, dance and conversation=
 found at 111 Minna Gallery creates a unique gathering place for a multi-se=
nsory experience.
