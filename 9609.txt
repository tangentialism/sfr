I just woke up and am getting ready to go to work...Randy is asleep on 
the couch and Barb is crashed on my bed..I wish I could still be 
sleeping like them, but I gotta go and take care of my life....what a 
wonderfully rad 
and beautiful time I had- it was so great to meet so many good people- I 
needed to go out and get some vibe, and boy did I ever- I'm still amazed 
that Ethan just opened up his house to us (and was still spinning at 6 in 
the morning..) To all of those who I met I can't wait to see you again- 
to those of you I missed, hopefully I'll catch you at BP or Harmony!!!!
(After a summer of all work &  no parties, I'm coming back and I'm ready to 
play for a good long while!)  Take care everybody...I truly felt so much 
love from you all!

Hey-

	Thanks to the crew for the party last night especially to Ethan for 
letting us into his home. I brought some friends from out of town and 
they all had a great time. 

Unfortunately, I forgot my record bag under the DJ table!!! If anyone 
there found it please hold on to it for me and drop me a line. It's 
one of those black Techniques zip-up bags.

-peace-

Alex

        MegaBuzzOne was phat !!!!!!!! I wish that I could describe all of
wonderful experiences I had last night.  My friend and I, disappointed
after not being able to get presale tix, got there about 9:30.  After
weeding through the 20 or so E dealers at the entrance, the night had
finally begun! I made a beeline for the first Buzz Room and danced for an
hour or so.

Then I hit the chill room--which was so relaxing.  It was hard not to get
engrossed in all of the matresses and pink feathers.  I went outside for
some fresh air and saw the inflatable panda (like those bouncy castles at
carnivals).
After a short wait, my friend and I jumped and flipped all over the place--
until we felt like puking. After a half hour of letting the queasiness
settle it was back to the dance floor.

Dancing until I was a rag of sweat, I lost complete track of time and went
nonstop for almost two hours.  After some more fresh air, we decided to
leave because we were both dead tired.  Catching our breath, we saw one of
our best friends and got our second wind!! After dancing our asses off
again we decided on leaving again. This time we ran into my friend's
girlfriend, who wasn't supposed to be able to go!

We said "F*%# leaving" and we got all of our asses back on the dance floor.
This is where I have to praise Matthew-- the dj at about 3am.  He was
beyond incredible! I went right up in front of the turntables and danced
almost harder that I ever have before.  I can't say enough about Matthew- I
just closed my eyes, let the music get inside, and moved and moved and
moved. After his set, I was completely drained. I got into my car and
crawled back home across the bridge.

The night was great.  Between the bouncy panda and watching the
breakdancers in Buzz Room 1, not much could have been better.  Yeah, there
were hella people and it was a little too commercial but the music, what I
consider the most important ingredient , was outstanding.  Everyone was
friendly to me and I never had any problems with anyone. I'm just wondering
what everyone else thought of the night, especially Matthew.  I hope
eveyone had as good of a time as I did. Bye.

Jose

 Does anyone have a clue as to where/when tonight's Sunset S.F. Bay area
"Burning Man" will be? A vague clue is fine - Pacific coast? Marin County?
San Mateo? Santa Clara? Monterey ? East Bay ?

A) Having ex-hippies for parents greatly expands your going-out abilities as
an adolescent (I'd suggest everyone get a pair)

B) I found out around my junior year of high school that most of the cool
kids were really schmucks who were so busy being cool and protecting that
ever-so-important "identity" that they couldn't get a decent job, let alone
expend enough mental energy to be able to brave the rigors of <gasp> Higher
Education.  Nerds are much more fun in my book.

C) The people who matter know when your not there.  

D) Kick-ass beach parties on Saturdays tend to make up for it all.

E) Why in the hell does a no-talent doink like Keanu Reeves making more
money than me?

Okay, so item E is a stretch to fit within the boundaries of the discussion,
but it needed to be said.  Hmph.

well ... it looks like i can't make it to SF as i had hoped.  The 
situation with my current roommate is rapidly becoming intolerable and i 
have got to get out of here as soon as i can, which means i have to save 
up for a damage deposit on a new place.  I can't legally kick him out, so 
i have no other choice.

Guess i'll have to see you all some other time.  i hate being poor.

	Megga Buzz kicked ass...especially cuz it was free (for me).

	-->> Ya see, I live 7 min. from HomeBase, and Liquid and I recieved
	     a slight tip off that it may be held there so we cruised on
	     over....and wouldn't ya know it, they were setting up for a
	     rave.  So we helped set up, met some people (what's up Vlad,
	     Ralph, Mike, Ginnie..), and well we got Megga Buzz passes. =)

	BUT that wasn't the only reason Megga Buzz kicked ass...

	1) our fellow ravers Alan and his brother joined Liquid and I
	2) the set up was great...hella rooms!!!
	3) the beats in Megga Zone 1 kicked ass
	4) they had a bouncy castle (or should I say bear)
	5) the vibe was great!! smiles, hugs, "excuse me's", food, glow sticks
	6) ran into a fellow SFRaver whom I met @ HUNNY and also an old
	   raving friend from UCSC (the last rave he went to was with Liquid
	   and I and he hadn't raved since till that night)

                   		     BOTTOM LINE
	----------------------------------------------------------------------
	Best rave I've ever been too...I'm sorry so many of you stuck to
	your prejudices and missed out on the party of the summer.

		
				RaVe On!!

Hi everybody!!
Thought I`d tell you a little story about what I did today...

I live in a little suburb to Oslo(the capitol), called Asker, in Norway...
The royal family lives here, and there`s a mountain behind their property.

I usually go up on the top of this mountain each summer, `cuz there`s a
great overlook over my home town, and of Oslo as well.... You`re not far
from the royal`s residence when you stand on the top of this mountain...

Well, anyway... me and this friend went up there tonight, brought some
hot-dogs and had or own little BBQ..... Planes keep flying over our heads,
and we could see far... Bright lights big city... My friend took the keys to
his apartment and started to carve his name in this three.... I became
overwhelmed by our capitol and I felt like screaming. So I took all my
clothes of and screamed until my throat hurt.... 
My friend turned to find out what was up, and he turned around, and started
laughing...

There I was, arms in the air like a V and my legs spread like I was
stripped-searched or something.. I got a great kick out of this....

My point is: Do something irregular! Try to consume LIFE instead of drugs..
I`m not saying that everybody on the list are dug-abusers, only that you all
should try this.... If you haven`t allready done it a load of times.... who
knows???

So try something like this! See if a natural high can be as good as drugs.....
I hope so....

Well, hope you liked my story....
Alot of love goes out to everybody who has read this far, and to those that
hit the D key right away as well, `cuz I have plenty...;)

Sune Alexandersen.....    :)

Captain Crunch once spoke:
>  I WAS able to get to an outdoor
> underground rave put on my the Moontribe people this weekend in the
> Angeles National Forest...  It was PHAT!!!
>
> Crunchman

Just to keep things clear, Elevation was *not* associated with Moontribe.
Those people are very cool in their own right, but Elevation was organized
by some SoCal ravers, Dominic Palombo being the frontman, or first among
equals at least. The Moontribers, it seems, have decided to withdraw from
the limelight for a while, after some vastly over-attended (and much too
visible) events over the last few months.

And yes, Elevation was an uncontrollable breakout of PLURriness, with
Crunchman being a very welcome and enthusiastic participant.

Peace,

-Phil

hello-

i was walking this morning, in a rather shitty mood, contemplating, among
other things, whether my job is worth is, am i going anywhere, blah blah
blah, you know, the sort of questions that seem to pop up when you're alone
and feeling it.

well, i saw this folded up piece of paper lying on the street, and it called
to me to open it.  it was a type-written piece of paper that had the
following message on it, with no anthor:

"you appreciate above most things in life, the peace and comfort of a good
home.  you remain aggreeable good tempered until you are goaded into action.
if you learn to throw off the depression which sometimes engulfs you, there
is no doubt that you will succeed in whatever lin eof work or profession you
may choose."

do you ever get the feeling that someone/something is watching out for you?


love to you all, and may you find that being/person/thing/angel/god/etc that
is watching over you right now, and give it a big huge hug!!!!

love-

matt l.

p.s., send lots of love to karen hardie!  she needs it right now more than
anyone i know.  and besides, she's from canada, so why not?

        Hey matt et toutes les merveilleux ravers,

        Awesome story! Here's another (and it's rave-related).
A couple of years ago i went down to NYC for a party which was going to be
the bomb, it featured Plastikman live (!) in this super wild location UNDER
the brooklyn bridge.
        Unfortunately the reality of the situation didn't end up being all
that great. Richie Hawtin (plastikman) got busted at the border (he being a
fellow canadian) and was refused entry. In his place they played a DAT (?).
        Also, they put about 3500 people into the Anchorage underneath the
bridge, a space that's only supposed to hold like 2200. I began to have a
few flashbacks to my previous life as a sardine. :/
        I was separated from my friends for 90% of the night and found
myself extremely ecstatic (about the music :) ) while being packed into a
room of frustrated people with no space to dance. Space is a large concern
already in NYC which is claustrophobic, and this just brought all sorts of
bad vibes out so i had to remind myself to "just keep dancing, close your
eyes, don't touch anyone, don't step on any gangster's feet, etc".
        At the end of the night, like the true glutton for punishment that
i am, i went to the after party alone after getting directions to get back
to my friend's place.
        I go to the after party and try to have fun, but due to some more
strange misfortunes i ended up feeling like a...hmmm...tranquilized horse
or something...
        And *then* someone stole my blue hooded sweatshirt. :/
        So, there i was in brooklyn at 11 am sunday morning, no jacket,
vague directions of how to get to my friend's place and feeling kinda
funny. I decided that i should start heading for the subway, not knowing
how long it'd take me to find my friend's place, indeed, having some
problems with the whole space/time thing in general.
        As i was walking/shivering along, i noticed a lump of clothes on
the sidewalk in front of me.  As i approached, my jaw dropped.  I picked up
a blue hooded sweatshirt (a different brand, carhartt, mine was a no-name
style). I put it up to my face. Freshly washed even!
        I looked around to see if anyone had dropped it, but there wasn't a
person in sight.
        I eventually found my way back to my friend's place and got them to
verify the existence of the jacket, then went and slept for a while.
        If there was ever a time that i *felt* the presence of something
watching out for me it was then.  And stuff like that still happens to me,
though now i'm not as bad about putting myself into situations where i
really need a "helping hand."
        It's nice to know that if you stumble that there'll be something
there to help you pick yourself up, though :)
        Ideally we could all be each other's guardian angels and save
them/it/whatever a lot of work.

        :),

>p.s., send lots of love to karen hardie!  she needs it right now more than
>anyone i know.  and besides, she's from canada, so why not?

        Ya, superbighugs to pounce, my canadian sistah :) It's taken me
like a year to get my butt to SF, but now it's happening. Everything in
good time! :)

        Maybe, but while my butt is currently in canada, my mind is in my

        Or maybe it's only because i weigh in at a whopping 132 pounds. Who

Send some healing energy to my/our dear friends!!!!!

I got a call today, telling me that some close friends of mine were in 
a horrible accident at the BM Festival. They were asleep in their tent, 
when a ... (never mind, you'll get sick if i tell you. Let's just say, 
I HATE drunk drivers!!!!!!) 

Anyways, they are in critical condition in intensive care in a hospital 
in Reno, awaiting surgery. I am off to go be with them. They are both 
unconscious right now, but I hope they can pull out of this awful 
nightmare. I really hope that by the time I get there everything will 
be ok, but I don't think that will happen. Please send them your love 
and energy...

Peace and love,

Greg :(

well I, for one, am feeling pretty sick to my stomach now. i hate the
feeling where i wish i could have done something to prevent it from
happening... even if i wasn't there.. to prevent something so utterly
stupid.. it is so sick that the negative consequences of one person's
actions can be felt by so many.
there is so much more i want to write but find myself choking back tears.

my heart is bursting for those in the hospital. love and energy to them...

        I think I'm actually the first person back from BM!!  We left about
7 this morning.  We wanted to beat traffic and we did.  I'm going to make
this short and sweet because I'm sure there will be about 100 more posts
re: BM.


        We decided to camp in the middle of the playa between the rave camp
and the main camp.  When I finally did go to the main camp I decided we
absolutely had to camp there.  Luckily, we ended up camping right in front
of the Synoptics camp and heard good music all weekend.  Bianca's smut
shack played the shit for two straight days.  Behind us was another sound
system.  BioJeff played two days in a row for about 6 hours at a shot.  It
was pretty good stuff.  The main camp I must say was full of the most
incredible sights.  The highlights were definitely the game of naked
twister I got the pleasure of watching, the roving couch and lamp, running
into the San Jose crew with their band Horchada, listening to all three of
the pirate radio stations, Bianca's smutty, smutty, smut contest, Wayne's
incredible blue light tower (I've never seen anything like that in my life
before), the tea shop and their incredible tunes, and of course the burning
of the man.

        The rave camp I must say lacked the creativity of the main camp
except for the setup of the sound systems.  Gateway really outdid
themselves designing a structure to accentuate the wind.  It was nice to
see the material blowing in the breeze rather than having a club like
atmosphere which is what the Wicked crews was like.  Though they did build
a structure the roof on it with the visuals made me feel like I was at some
club.  I wanted to see the stars so that was kind of a bummer.  I have to
say though that the one thing I didn't want to miss in the rave camp was
hearing Astral Matrix play live.  He came on right after Jonah Sharp spun.
It was wonderful as usual with a great mix of classics and new stuff.  I'm
so glad I didn't miss that.  CCC was almost just like going to the
warehouse.  Nothing really new to look at.  I did miss their ceremony at
sunset on Saturday night but I was tripping too hard in the main camp to
drive over there.  I had to wait until dark.  Bummer.  I really wanted to
see them do their stuff although I have seen it somewhat before.


        I hope all the people who camped in the rave camp got a chance to
check out the main camp and not just for the burning of the man.  I know a
lot of people who wouldn't have even gone to BM had it not been for the
rave camp.  Luckily enough, like I said before, I camped in the sfraves
part of the main camp by accident and it all worked out for the best.


        I did say I was going to keep this short and sweet.  I had a
wonderful time and I hope everyone else did too.  I will probably go next
year too.  I don't have to work until Friday so just take a guess where I'm
gonna spend the next few days.   THE BEACH!!!!!!!   I'm gonna swim in the
ocean!!!!!!!!

My half-assed Burning Man plans fell through - I realized too late that 
half-ass is not the way to approach BM!  I was with the participants in 
heart and spirit, but mentally and physically five days of utter slothdom 
was much better for me...:)  I am so sad to hear about the accident... I 
am concentrating all of my love and energy and healing forces towards 
these two innocent people... Let's all keep them in our thoughts and beam 
as much collective vibration to them as possible...  

Lazy Days :)
Thursday Night -- roused at midnight from my bed by earnest (and high) 
clubber friend, who exhorted, "Lift's going on!!"  I opted for my 
pillow.  Has anyone been to this weekly at DV8 lately?  Apparently it was 
the place to go (in clubland) about a year ago, but now...?  I went once 
in the spring for a truly boring night and never went back.  Thoroughly  
enjoyed snoozing this Thursday instead :).

Friday Night --  The big college party at my co-op.  Happy house 
incompetently spun by lame dj (don't worry - you've never heard of him), 
keggers of shitty beer, and 500 strangers.  Woo-wee.  Somebody kill me.

Saturday Night -- Consumed "Synthetic Pleasures," the 
pseudo-cutting edge documentary exploring how technology is allowing 
humans to control our environment and tailor our experiences, including 
far-fetched scenarios of a purely synthetic future.  Some interesting 
issues *were* raised (including the community-building potential of the 
Internet (Wazzup, SFRavers!), a byproduct of supposedly alienating 
technology), and much "retinal candy" dominated the screen.  But, not as 
heavyweight, important or revelatory as the ad campaign suggests.

Again opted for sleep, this time over the party at Ethan's.  And I call 
myself a raver?  What am I, gettin old??  I'm starting to worry.

Last Night --  Spundae's Memorial Day party, featuring top dj from 
France, Laurent Garnier.  Held at 1015 for the extra space, and they sure did
pack as many paying customers as possible into it!  The crowd typified 
the bizarre sociology of commercial clubs: suburbanites came decked out 
in suitjackets and dresses-and-heels, the clubkids strutted their stuff, 
the ravers scrounged about in tanktops and sneakers, and everyone there 
seemed to have a different idea on what the club experience should be.  

Last night the meatmarket quotient was, unfortunately, in 
full effect (I was grabbed numerous times, a serious downer for my 
evening).  It was difficult to navigate the dancefloor without dealing 
with drunk, aggressive men.  In that atmosphere I am forced to fold into 
myself, not make eye contact, not smile at strangers, in order to 
minimize the potential for harassment.  It, again, reminded me how 
liberating raves are for women, that we can be open and friendly and have 
that just mean we are relating to people as people, not have it be 
interpreted as physical availability.  Alcohol is a major factor in that, 
but I truly believe it is fundamentally respect for women that is the 
difference in our treatment.  Sadly, Spundae was much more "clubby" in this 
aspect than previous parties of theirs I had been to. 

Music, like the crowd, ranged across scenes.  The front room was 
mainstream central (disco, funk), upstairs people grinded to hip-hop, 
downstairs were the SF mainstays Jeno-Carlos etc., and the main room 
was reserved for the guest dj.  I was excited to see Laurent Garnier 
(how awesome to share the music experience across continents).  His set 
was frustrating, though - energy would build, and the crowd would 
scream, and then it would dissapate too soon... much became repetitive, 
especially since he spun for close to four hours!!  But at times it was 
brilliant.  As always, the sound and lights at 1015 are unbelievable.  
What a treat to really dance there!

Great to see some SFRavers out!! (Consolation that I'm not the only one 
left back here).  KaySEE danced around in a bundle of energy, as usual; 
SDream was there with his friendly smile (but minus funny hat), and Jess 
Fogler is back from Europe and ready to start med school, year two (this 
time studying rather than resubbing to the list!).  It's so good to see 
friendly faces when I go to clubland!

Sorry for the length!  I'm a firm believer in overindulging myself... :)

Love, 
Nancy

I hope they'll be alright.  It was a very disturbing end to what had
been a great weekend.  It could have just as easily been myself and
Heather;  the injured were in the next tent to mine.  How horrible it
is to wake up to a collision and screams!  We had just met them a
couple of nights before.  Give them my best:  they will be on my mind,
and a lot of others as well.

Subject: The last BM on the playa?
Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

First of all, let our prayers go out to those who were very seriously
injured.  BM for me was an unforgettable and positive experience, but after
waking up today to the aftermath of the accident 100 yards away at the
Gateway camp, and instinctively knowing that it must've been better with
four and two thousand people in years past than with the 15,000 (!) people
that were reported there on Sunday night, I would be surprised if it
returns again to Black Rock next year, unless major changes are made.
Unfortunately, the secret is out, and too many people were there this year
who just wanted a party and didn't take this seriously.  This is a shame,
because the creativity and freedom at BM was truly liberating.  But there
were too many parallels for me with the scene at some of the last Dead
shows, where the people who abused their freedom made it difficult for
those who reveled safely in it.

The rave story:  Rave camp was more than 2 miles away from main camp (from
the stop sign at the perimeter to the Chai tent was about 3.5), and simply
put, it is unsafe to travel large distances at night on the playa in a car
with so many people there.  A lot of people who I saw in the days at main
camp never made it over to rave, and there was something missing from the
vibe because of it.  Gateway rocked the house, particularly on Saturday
night when Joe Rice, Minor Minor and John Carel went off on marathon sets,
but the whole didn't equal the sum of the parts because the ravers weren't
up to it.  C.C.C. was also trippy, with their Mayan ceremony and closing
live didgeridoo over superhard trance at sunrise on Sunday morning.  Spaz'
sound system never worked.  I spent about a minute at Wicked on Friday --
total club vibe, which was fine for others.

I hope I'm wrong about the fate of BM on the playa, and something will be
done, but you could just see the expressions on the faces of the
authorities on the way home -- this is it.

peace,

Hello everyone.... 

I live in Reno and I'm going to go down to the hospital tomorrow after
work. I was thinking that it would provide incredible amounts of support
if I could print out the get-well/healing messages and give them to the
friends of the injured waiting at the emergency room. I was also hoping
that the messages could be read to the patients when they have regained
some stability so that they know that everyone is pulling for them.
 
So, send your messages to sfraves or directly to me if you prefer to save
bandwidth. I figure that I'll go around 8pm tomorrow so that everyone who
wants to has time to send out their messages. 
				                 
					  love, Alex

I found out about MegaBuzz from the Hyperreal Web site.

It was my first rave.  I am a little older (27), and I have to say that I
was very impressed by the vibe.  I had a great time.  Sean Murray (sp?) was
amazing.  Suddenly it was six hours later...

Seeing young (and old) people of various backgrounds, ethnicities,
finances, whatever, grooving together was REALLY COOL.

There's hope.

hi all:

The time has come for me to depart from Palo Alto (it's a nice place
to live, but I wouldn't want to live there) due to an expiring
sublet. And what a wonderful excuse to get my ass out of suburbia and
into San Francisco!!!

Where do *you* fit in to all of this? Well, by helping me in my quest
to find housing in SF, not only would you win my undying love and
gratitude, but you'd also be doing your part in helping the homeless
find shelter in the Bay Area :)

So if you're looking for a housemate, know of someone who is, or are
interested in getting a few people together to start a new place, then
please consider me! I'm clean, respectful, responsible, employed, work
and play well with others, etc. I'm also able to make a one year (or
more?) commitment.

Please respond only by private email. Sorry to clutter your inboxes;
however, I'm posting here because people on this list are generally
employed, interesting, and tolerant of people with bizarre sleeping
patterns ;) So please bear with me.

Thanks!
Steve

 ... with Iraq. 

Far away, in another equally arid area, the USA sent 27 cruise missiles
to blow up "military targets."

Now I am sure I'm not voting for Clinton. He's no better than Bush --
killing innocent civilans to get votes. What a sick and fucked up
country we've built.

I don't think we could have partied any harder at BM to prevent this
continuing atrocity. All this crap coming on the tail of recent news of
the US Armed Forces coverup of "Gulf War Syndrome" coming from exposure
of our troops to chemical weapons released from factories/storage-areas
that we bombed. The irony is that the chemical weapons and the plants
we bombed were predominantly supplied by American companies; we even
sold them the chemicals in the first place (including compounds used to
make sarin gas).

It turns out some of our "friendly fire" casualties during "Operation
Desert Storm" were actually our own troops that died horrible agonizing
deaths through exposure to chemical weapons in places they had been
instructed to blow up. Of course, our troops weren't told that they'd
need to don chemical exposure suits, and they died after exposure to
chemicals from the plants and storage sites they destroyed. The
surviving hapless veterans, falling ill upon their return home, were
publicly called "wimps and complainers" by those that sought to coverup
our role in arming Iraq -- they were publicly told to "act like real
men and veterans" just to hide the complicity of the big industrial
companies that sold all the shit to Iraq in the first place...

And the lies they spew on CNN -- totally repulsive.  Like we suddenly
have taken this great overarching interest in the well-being of the
Kurds. Most amerikkkans don't know Kurds from cottage cheese, nor do
they care, nor is it our business to care. How can they call this a
democracy? Where is "the will of the people"? We didn't really get any
approval from our allies. So much for the UN.

Other than that, I had a great time at Burning Man.

The first thing you notice about Burning Man is the intensity
of the environement.  They were not kidding when they stressed
the importance of shade and water.  We spent most of our
day just hanging out under our shade, sipping on water bottles.
The heat steals most of your energy, so all you can really
do during the day is hang out under the shade.  We had
our shade all set up with heavy-duty stakes, but about 3
hours after we erected it, a mini-tornado tore through
our camp, breaking the shade poles, snapping the tie-down
lines, and ripping the metal gromets out of the tarp.  We
were able to rebuild it, kind of.

The Rave Camp was 2 miles away, which kind of sucked.  Walking
there was too dificult.  At night, riding your bike was dangerous
becuase the chances of getting hit by a car was pretty high.
So, everytime you wanted to rave, you hopped in your car.  Most
ravers camped in the main camp, because the rave camp was just
so seperated from the rest of burning man.

My Opinions:

The best setup at the rave camp was Gateway.  With something like 8 or
12 speaker stacks setup in a giant circle pointed inwards, the sound
was amazing.  At the center was a 3 story high scaffolding setup draped
in light white cloth illuminated by blacklights.  4 intellibeams scanned
the playa floor and a bright green lazer shot 10 feet above the playa
to the Main Camp, making it easy to follow the green light all the way
to Gateway.

The best music was the CCC system.  Top-notch Goa that clawed its way
into your head and forced your body to move.  I will be looking
to go to other CCC parties in the future.

The actual Burning of the Man did not disappoint.  10,000 people circled
the structure.  Hundreds of drummers provided the soundtrack.  A procession
of people with flags and torches approached the Man.  Bright signal flares
went up all around us, illuminating the whole Main Camp in an strange, red
glow.  The man was lit and exploded into flames.  Fireworks went up
everwhere.  He burned for several minutes before finally collapsing
onto the ground.  Incredible.

Anyone going to Burning Man in hopes of seeing lots of naked people would
have not been disappointed.

Coolest stuff:

A home-made device using air compressors and gasoline to fire 40-foot high
fireballs into the air.  Even from 20 feet away, the heat and the flash
were incredible!  I think I lost some hair from the heat.

A sculpture of about 40 old pianos that had the wires exposed.  Everyone
was encouraged to grab a stick and bang on them.  It was a chorus of
chaos.

A jet-powered bicycle.

A driving sofa.

A bigger-than life version of the game Mousetrap using bowling balls.

A guy hitting a block of burnign magnesium creating blinding white-hot
flashes.

And tons of other stuff that you really just had to see to believe :)

New experiences are really cool.  Just when you think you have seen it
all, Burning Man proves you wrong.

Friends,

        This Friday will be my last day at work, so I'll be falling off the
list.  I hope to get hooked up with an IP soon, so I can remain connected
from home.  In the meantime, if anyone wants to contact me, lemme know, and
I'll give you my phone#.

See ya!

Send out all your good thoughts and energy to Andrew of Astral Matrix as
well.  He was helping to take down the Wicked scaffolding and part of it
fell on his head.  He is in a hospital in Tahoe and should be back in S.F.
sometime tonight.  I  know he is okay but he probably had to have a few
stitches.  I'm really sorry to hear about the other folks as well.  I just
met them a few nights ago and was really bummed to hear about them getting
injured.  I actually made it unscathed.  It was one crazy huge fuckin'
party!!!!!  I hope this will make everyone who goes next year a little bit
more leary about camping in the middle of nowhere.  I hope also people who
have been drinking think a little longer before they decide to get behind
the wheel of a car.  Just because there are no police officers out there to
bust the drunk drivers does not mean it's okay people.  I'm sure noone on
SFraves would ever think about doing something that stupid and
inconsiderate right???????????

Clinton is like Bush in this respect...he holds an office in which it makes
sense for him to do certain things and no sense for him to do certain other
things.  IMHO, changing the person in that position will do little to alter
the nature of global geopolitics.  The history of US Foreign policy in the
last 60 years backs this posistion.  Our choices in Presidents come down to
different ways of approaching domestic issues...changing the other will
require something much larger than a Presidential election.  I remain
hopeful that this can and will happen in our lifetimes...but in the
meantime I think the domestic issues are important enough to future
generations of Americans (or the descendents of those who were Americans)
to make me vote for Clinton, unless he's so far ahead of Dole that my
voting for Ralph Nader couldn't conceivably get Dole into the White House.

I party to party, to share a vibe with those who will, and hopefully to
take that vibe with me out into the world and share it with others I
encounter.  But when I want to prevent atrocity partying isn't usually my
medium of choice...and I really doubt its effectiveness here...are Clinton
and Hussein supposed to feel the vibe from BM all the way from their
respective offices?  If you want your voice to be heard maybe some sort of
communication is in order...communication with those who might be in a
position not only to hear you but to do something about it.  Just a
suggestion.

Geopolitics isn't about this sort of thing.  And as far as the media goes
look who owns them and then figure out how much you're willing to buy and
what sort of slant that ownership is likely to give.  I don't expect truth
from the media...I expect truth from my friends and family.  The media
isn't about truth, it's about power, and the interests of power rarely lie
in the realm of truth.  Yeah, it'd be swell if we could all just mind our
own business and let others be.  The world we inhabit isn't like that and
isn't gonna get there by bagging on the way things are.  You want it to be
different?  Lead.  You wanna know what to do?  Listen.  You wanna be heard?
Speak the truth.

I'm sorry you came back from BM to such disheartening news...a small
reminder that the dark world continues on its course whilst we rave.  Yet I
believe that someday, with lots of love, truth, and positive energy we will
reach critical mass, and will remake a world in the nurturing image of love
and openness.

I've started this email at least five times now.  I'm not sure how to
convey the following information:

At 8am Monday morning, September 2nd, an individual drove from the Main
Camp to the Rave Camp.  He was not sober, but I am not aware of what he was
on, or if he fell asleep.  He ran through a campsite, coming to a stop
after striking another vehicle.

At this point I don't think it would be prudent to offer more information.
In time you will hear the news.  It's a sad day.

I'm sorry this sounds cryptic, but I just don't think it's right to say any
more.  Please understand.

Tony

P.S.  Please don't make a thread of this, there will be ample time for
that, for right now please send all your energy toward Reno, and those that
cry out to us.

Funny not funny (depends upon interpretation),

As I took my girlfirend to school this morning I looked around and saw 
all of the dusty cars/trucks/transports from BM oparked all over the 
Haight.  This year, I looked at those people as survivors moreso than 
partygoers.

I guess chaos ain't all it's cracked up to be.  The events of this past 
weekend re-affirm the need for laws, sorry to say.

With that, I'm out.

Sorry to hear about Bro. Andrew, I'll talk to him when homey gets home.  
My prayers and good wishes to the others who were injured.

If I hear one pollyanna remark about this years BM I'll know we are truly 
in hell.

I know I won't be disappointed....

:<


Out,
John

P.S.  NExt year BM for me?  I seriously doubt it.  The way this years BM 
was leed  & hyped, it , IMO, was the height of irresponsibility.  15,000 
crackerjacks with no order, no law?  No thanks.

I think it's time for this thing to implode.

out 1 more time.

to those who went to burning man:  you were in my prayers the entire time,
and as far as i know, all the sfravers who went came back safely.  let's
pray/meditate/whatever you do for those who were hurt there.

i probably won't see ya'll at a party until harmony, i'm saving up my energy
for that.  i've been sick, so i'm recouperating, plus i need a small break
from raving.  but, until harmony is a long enough break, so i look forward
to seeing ya'll there!

well, remember that i love ya'll, and have a wonderful day!

love-

matt

It's very odd indeed to be back among fluorescent lights and computers
after the weekend.

We camped in the rave camp and set up a little sound system for our own
entertainment - There was great music coming from all the larger systems
and I'd be quite thankful to anyone who can tell me who was played the
great dub set on the Spaz system on Sunday morning.

Gateway's setup was incredible, with their massive lighting tower and laser
able to be seen for miles away through the desert. Saturday night was
incredible - a great vibe - it was wonderful to play under such a beautiful
night sky. Although I still don't understand why a random guy came up and
handed me a pair of vise-grip pliers while I was playing.

Sunday was a bit more chaotic and I got the impression while in main camp
for the burn that everyone was getting rid of their inebrients of choice by
ingesting them as quickly as possible. There was a really high amount of
alcohol, which wouldn't have necessarily been bad if people hadn't decided
thatince they were in the desert normal common sense about driving
intoxicated didn't apply. Greg's already mentioned the tragic accident that
occured early Monday morning as someone cut through rave camp on their way
to Wicked and ran over two tents full of sleeping people right near
Gateway. Definitely a fucked up way to end the weekend.

The main camp was so huge it would have taken days to see everything - I
wish I knew what I'd missed. I still can't get over the fact that they were
selling espresso and cappucino. (Overheard one couple asking for lowfat
milk in their caps) Of course there were burning structures and items
everywhere - one of the highlights was seeing our own Dave Bayer giving
fire breathing instruction to volunteers.

I'm still not quite back enough to put the whole weekend in context, but it
was definitely a life affecting experience.

I have to say that this years BM was amazing...... I had my doubts going in
about how many people would show up for the Rave element (I thought it
would be overwelmingly packed out), but instead It was the BM camp that
swelled to an amazing size. 
 
By Sunday nite the event exploded into a free for all of fire, performances
and wierdness. I was in complete shock at how incredible some of the
performances were. 
 
The best music I heard all weekend was not in rave camp, but on the main
stage in the BM camp. There was a guy who performed with fire and some
electronicly attached metal stuff (for lack of a better description). that
blew my mind. In addition there was a DJ who played some of the fattest
tracks I have ever heard. (I wanred to find out who it was, but I decided,
it didn't matter who he was, just that I enjoyed his music.) 
 
The Mudhenge area was awsome, I spent most of my daytimes wallowing in mud
to beat the heat. We had mud wrestling, mud wars, sliding contests, and we
even played twister in the mud. However my favorite time was when everyone
would line up side by side to form a horseshoe, and people would crawl
through the horseshoe over the top of everyone..........WOW, lots & lots of
fun. 
 
The couch on wheels was a major hit for me, as was the piano sculpture, and
the giant life size moustrap game. there were one man helecopters,
airoplanes, and tons of wild & crazy people boppin around. 
 
The rave camp was interesting. GATEWAY did a brilliant job of setting up
there new sound system in a cirle reminicent of stone henge, with the DJ in
the center of the circle, it created a beautiful energy where once within
the circle, you were one with the rest of the people equally distributed
360 degrees around the DJ. Their lazer would shine all the way to BM camp
(some 2-3 miles away), and it made it easier to find rave camp. I think
they did themselves justice, and impressed all my friends and family. 
 
WICKED was wicked. They had a nice set up with interesting visuals and a
lazer. I was hard pressed to be able to go near the front of the DJ booth,
as it was all to packed with people. (like so many clubs). but musically it
was a typical wicked, and I especially liked Garths trip hop funky elements
at the start of his set. (Sat 2:30 am -ish). Tracy has been practicing
since last time I heard her (6 months ago), and I was happy to see her
enjoying herself. Polywog was .....well Polywog, and I love her to
death......she is so fresh and original, and her vibe is so
cooooool........you should have seen her purple-ness..........what a
characture........ 
 
CCC had a pretty wimpy camp set-up, but the people that hung out there were
really colorful and up-beat. It reminded me of the UK this summer, with the
international (GOA style) look. lots of healthy happy and brightly dressed
people (neon colors and patterns). They had a large sculpture (an alien I
think), that they torched sunday nite.  
 
SPAZ, was non existent, and after last years success, I had hoped Spaz
would come on strong again, but I don't know what happened to
them.........too bad. (besides last year they had asked me to play, and I
wanted to drop my new records at the BM somewhere). 
 
I have to say this was one of the best parties I have ever attended, and
the only thing that ruined it for me was to hear that our friends were
badly injured by a drunk driver, and in addition I heard that there was a
death (poss 3 ?). This makes me sad and took away from any positive aspect
of BM as it seems we may have gone too far in our attempt to be wild &
free. 
 
I can only hope that our 2 friends in hospital in Reno (and Andrew in
Tahoe) will be alright, and that we have not jeporadized any future BM
events. I for one will be very sad to know that the creative proccess that
flows at BM, could be quelched by one or two complete morons and nitwits.  
 
Over-all I have to say BM was beyond itself, and I had the time of my life.
I ran into many old friends and met some new ones. I saw a lot of British
people who had come over just for this event (Shakti, Gemma, Mark, Lulu,
Anne, Jason, and Jessica to name a few......). The event was so large this
year that I could'nt find some of my friends who I had planned to meet, and
I expect I'm not the only one to say that........ 
 
Let us give thanks that we are here to read & write about the BM, and not
suffering in a hospital bed, or lying in a morge in Reno.   It gives me
some perspective that some of the tripe and quibling we get up to sometimes
(here on SFR), is just a waste of time & energy.........enjoy life while
you are still here to enjoy it.......And spread the good vibe through
whatever means you can. (writing, music, massage, etc....whatever your
skill is). 
 
The weather was a lot more calm this year, no major dust storms, or thunder
storms, and my body is racked with small scratches, cuts, and minor
injuries, but it was totally worth it. One of the highlites of my weekend
was to be able to shower with warm water, and clean the mud off after 2
days of wallowing. I enjoyed some intense conversations, but especially
enjoyed my time talking to Paul. (as the man burned....) 
(Paul if your out there.....call me as I promised you a tape.....) 
415-337-6666 
 
All in all a good time was had by all.........And I can't wait to be able
to afford to get my pictures developed........all 6 rolls)

Well I for one will be sorry to see you go, and will look forward to
your return in the not-too-distant future, I hope! While we've never
met (I think!) I've enjoyed having you around and haved LOVED and
kept in my email inbox to cheer me up from time to time messages
like the one below, which make me realise how much I've quickly come 
to think of sfraves as my family away from home and my true support system.

May you go in peace and walk in beauty. And come back soon!

Hi folks, I'm off on a much awaited and much deserved "House pilgrimage" to
San Francisco and San Francisco in a coupla weeks. Unfortunately I'm really
short on cash so I'm flogging loadsa my old records so I can go out and by
some new ones! I've got a massive collection of house, techno, acid, garage
etc, from the US, UK, Germany, Belgium, Holland, Italy etc etc. I'm in
London at the moment but I would be happy to bring any records you want to
SF instead of bothering with all the hassle with posting them and sending
money. It would be nice to meet some of you SFRavers anyway!
Email me for a list soon or you could check out Jamies Techno Page:
http://www.maths.ex.ac.uk/~james/tekno/reb/europ.html
but that list needs updating. It would help if you tell me what kind of
stuff you're looking for as the list is pretty long.
Cheers and see you soon...

Rebekah

I know it's been awhile since the beach party, but I'm _still_ trying to
find my green zippered hooded sweatshirt. I haven't seen it since August
17th. I know I didn't leave it on the beach, and I'm almost certain that it
went home in someone's car/truck. has anyone seen it?

smiles,

John's Burning Man Experience:

Overall, I had a great time and really enjoyed the
experience.  It did end up being more challenging than I
thought it would though because of some issues I will try
to describe.

First of all I went last year, where I had just an
awesome time.  Everything just flowed so easily and I was
very impressed with most everything I came across.  I
guess that's part of the beauty of innocence, we let
ourselves appreciate everything because it's all so new.
But I think it made this year harder, because I kept looking
for last years experience, trying to recreate the magic of it
all that I felt last year, and I soon realized that this kept
leaving me dissapointed, because I couldn't find that
same group of people or kept feeling the tension of
wanting something that belonged to another time, and not
getting it because all I had was this time.

I didn't realize this until late friday night.  Most of
friday I was still caught up in the excitement of being
back on the playa and setting up and discovering all the
things that were there.  And then that night I was at
rave camp and was dancing at Gateway, having a great
time until it all hit me, quite suddenly, this huge wound,
where I became aware that I wasn't letting myself
appreciate the present.  I somehow felt that I wasn't
giving enough of myself to Burning Man '96 and in return
I didn't deserve to get that much back.  So the answer is
easy right, just start giving... but sometimes that's
much easier said than done.  That feeling stayed with me
most of Saturday, where I decided to devote myself more
toward main camp, because I felt myself expecting to be
at rave camp, because that was where I thought I would be
more comfortable but likewise where I was living in the
past.  I thought main camp would be more challenging and
different and might inspire me to wake up to a new
experience.  It was working, slowly, but surely...
The wound and fear I felt was very deep, but it was
healing, and I was appreciating the process even though
it was very trying.  

On Saturday I explored a lot and saw a great many very
creative things.  Even with all the party-goers and
spectators, Burning Man is still one of the most
impressive collections of creative expression I have come
across, and that's the beauty I want to remember about
the whole trip.  That freedom, where people can mud
wrestle and bolt 88 pianos together and shout "burn
mother ducker burn!" and jump naked on a trampoline and
put a necklace in a shrine where all objects are sacred
and drive over 700 miles an hour and a laser shines for
miles across the desert and drunk guy camped next to year
says fuck a lot because someone stole his cooler full of
beer and the alien repellent pyramid buzzes full time
keeping you safe from evil aliens while aliens come up to
you smiling and groove with you to damn cool music and
noise and complain about how bad this festival has gotten
and wonder at how free everyone is...

So on Saturday night after watching Hellco burn I found
myself exhausted, not having slept since friday morning,
and I slep soundly all night.

On Sunday I headed back to rave camp and wandered into
CCC where some great music was playing and some great
people were getting down.  I decided not to be so hard on
myself.  Admit that I love raving and even despite all
the antirave sentiment floating around in main camp
raving is a big part of who I am and what I love and
that's exactly what this weekend was about.

Then it got hot again and so I stayed low, wandering
more, talking to people, waiting for the night...
I'm definately more a night person than a day person...
and the burning of the man came.  As with last year, I
decided to make my interpretation of the man be raw fear,
and watch it burn.  I think it worked, because things
just got better from there.  I then walked the two miles
back out to rave camp and danced for about an hour at
each sound system.  I decided to adopt a new saying,
"It's all good."  based on the principle that left and
right I need to trust more.  whether it's trusting the
drunk guys cursing the next camp over who ended up
leaving Sunday afternoon (no more beer), or trusting that
the sacred temple really can listen to the object you
place in it and give it life, or trusting the stranger
who offers you a ride, or trusting yourself to be just as
important a piece of the puzzle as the next guy who seems
to be doing so much more than you... It's all good and it
all has something to make your life more special.  It's
all magic.

It was hard, but very satisfying.  and yes I would go again
next year.

In regard to everyone who was injured or hurt, I have a
small story:

In 1989 I was in a car accident.  I wasn't driving,
and there was nothing going on in my life that could make
me guilty enough to deserve what happened.  In fact, it
was a period of my life where everything was going
extremely well, and I had everything to look forward too.
I ripped my neck and had a stroke.  I was in a coma for a while
and woke up with my left side paralyzed and most of my ribs
broken.  I spent a long time being angry because I couldn't
see the point of such a thing happening.  Most of my left
side came back in the following year, my ribs healed, for
the most part, and I was able to get on with life.
Nothing was the same though and I missed the past, in a very
similar way to how I started off looking for the old
buning man experience this year, and was unable to
appreciate the new.  I could no longer play the
saxophone, or ride a bike, or walk entirely straight, or
hold my left arm still, as huge tremors keep it shaking
anytime I am not asleep, even to this day.  But I've been
learning that I really appreciate who I am now, and that
the insight into myself that the accident gave me and the
healing process that I've had to go through is one of the
most beautiful experiences I've ever known.  It's
extremely hard, but if my love of life and the
appreciation I have for so many aspects of it is a result
of the accident, I am no longer sorry it happened.  In
fact, I've come to realize that no matter what happens,
no matter how bad, we will survive and eventually heal as
a far stronger person than we started off being.
and I now have no doubt that eventually my arm and my
spirit will heal completely, and that I will appreciate
having gone through that pain and won.  Some days look
bleak and fear consumes us and our faith, but the healing
is inevitable, and we just have to learn to trust the
darkness.

It's all good.

-john.

 Hey Ethan and everyone else at his house on Saturday,

      To add to my dissapointment about not being able to show on Saturday, I
found out this morning that my best friend attended the party after telling
me she wasn't going.  My *best friend* caught a ride on B.A.R.T.  with a
mutual aquaintance we know and cruised over to Berkley  to hang out for a
while.  Aside from not telling me she was going to the party I had informed
her about, she waited until now to tell me what a great time she had.
 However, she insists it was all a big hassle hitch-hiking home and
everything.  I don't really believe her since I thought we had a trusting
friendship and I wanted so much to hear the music and meet everyone.  We are
still working out differences, and I think (being the forgiving person I am)
we will continue to be best friends.  What with losing my wallet and all it
was really not my week.  Anyone who knows how to cheer me up would be a big
help.  Thanx so much.

There has been alot of talk on this list recently about what Burning Man means, and what purpose it serves.  This was my first Burning Man experience.  Every year for the past 4 years (or so) I've been saying to myself that I wanted to go, but for some reason or another, I was never able to make it up there. I've done alot of reading about the event in the past couple of years to try to understand what Burning Man is. Some people have said its very spiritual, others have said its an excuse to party in the desert for five days.  But none of what I've read or heard about Burning Man could have prepared me for what I experienced this past weekend.  

We arrived to playa early Friday morning.  The sun was just rising over the mountains to the east that looked more like ant hills in comparison to the expanse of the playa.  We pulled to the side of the road, sat on top of my car, smoked a bowl, and took in the beautiful site of another day beginning in the desert.  The check in point to Burning Man was a few miles down the road.  We were instructed to drive north on the playa for 12 miles, then turn right.  When you drive in a city, it is very easy to find your destination.  When you are given directions to a location, they usually go something like this: Take 101 south to 85 North........etc....  On the playa, the directions go something like this: Go that way for a long time until you see the blue flashing light......  There are no lines, no landmarks to show your way, just a general direction to travel, for ever.

We found our RV crew almost immediately, set up camp, and started looking for shade.  It gets really hot out there.  But after a while, you are not concerned with how hot it is, but rather finding shade, and drinking water.  Time becomes irrelevant.  The days are spent sitting, not moving, trying to stay cool.  The heat drains all your energy.  The desert drains all your water.  Your skin becomes very dry.  The hours drag by as you watch the sun slowly move to the west, waiting for it to drop behind the ant hills.  As evening approaches, people start emerging from their tents and shade structures, the lucky ones have air conditioned RV's.

The night brings a steady stream of bottle rockets exploding in the air.  The stars fill the sky from horizon to horizon.  Then the Moon raises over the ant hills to a roar of cheers and applause from Black Rock City residents.  Night life at BM is crazy.  Every direction you look, there is something happening.  Most of it just does not make sense.   

We came to the conclusion that any type of small motorized transportation is the way to travel around camp.  I brought my bike, somehow go a flat tire out there.  But peddling around in the desert heat takes alot of energy.  I think next year I'll rent a little go-cart.  The coolest transpiration I saw out there was a motorized couch.  Talk about traveling in comfort!  

Rave Camp was basically a big Rave in the desert.  I went out there a few times, but there was just not much going on.  I didn't go to Burning Man to attend a Rave, I can do that any time.  Main Camp was much more interesting.

So now I have finally experienced Burning Man.  And I'm trying to figure out what it means to me.  Maybe it will take a few more days, weeks, years, to fully understand what I experienced.  It was about survival, it was about finding shade, it was about being with friends, it was about meeting new people, it was about watching a 5 story wooden figure being burnt to the ground, it was about helping others around you, it was about being helped by others around you, it was about really appreciating a shower.  

The most amusing conversation I had was with this women while waiting in line to use the "Sani-Hut" on Monday Morning.  The line was approximately 15 people deep.  And moving very slowly.  Somebody decided to check some of the "Huts" for occupancy and found that only 3 were being used.  So I mentioned to this lady that there should be some sort of flashing light showing occupancy on top of the "Sani-Hut" as the 'Occupied' switches were not working.  She said that would be a great idea, if we can have motorized lamps driving around camp, we could surely have flashing occupied beacons on top of each "Sani-Hut".  But we decided that in the Burnging Man spirit, Flashing occupancy lights are needed, a roving lamp on wheels is not, and somehow that made sense.

It was a look of pride, disbelief, and wonder, all rolled into one on da
man's face :)  It was fun to help set up (rolling cabs UP stairs!), and the
party rocked!  It was very cozy, being in a home, and never too hot.  Hard
to tell how many people were there, but we had a great turnout, and sound
quality was excellent!

Peace,

[written last night, and long. YHBW]
Just walked in the door an hour ago or so... as usual, I only got a
big pile of bills; no love letters or Long's coupon books. oh well,
I'm sleepless and still in awe of Burning Man, so I thought I'd share
my experience with everyone.

After many false starts, last minute planning, and oodles of
procrastination, we finally made our 7pm departure at 3:30am (okay,
that's a *little* late), but it was all good because we knew we'd be
getting there no matter what. We were happy and on our way :)

Arrived around 11am on Thursday, and we were greeted by a fairly empty
and fairly tame gathering. But it was nice to be able to set up camp
without all the confusion. Anyway, here's a breakdown of the events in
the form of a handy reference sheet.

If you went to Burning Man to go to a big rave, then you missed the
fun (and probably could have saved $17 by going to MegaBuzz 1, a much
bigger and more convenient rave). Well, regardless of what you were
there for (or if you were even there), here's what I saw and how I saw
it:

VW Camp

Imagine a camp full of computer geeks and ravers (mostly
SFR'ers). Well, that was VW. This camp was the place to be! What
started off as a small gathering of three RV's turned into a total
community of tents, cars, tarps, and other forms of shelter.

A sound system was set up, and DJ Tom threw down some killer sets as
we laid beneath the tarp, cursing the heat and sipping our water
bottles. I was so happy to meet up with friends and meet new ones. VW
became the kind of place where you could borrow a cup of sugar from
the neighbors, etc.

Irrational Geographic

A superset of VW, IG encompassed the broader crowd of computer geeks,
like folks from Organic, Bianca's Smut Shack, folks from mtn-raves,
and the cool people with the chips and guac. Bianca's was a totally
cool hangout with phunky sofas for conversation and X rated comix to
break the monotony of life... The mnt-raves crew hosted the toast
breakfast on Saturday morning. That is, until their generator blew a
fuse. But bread was fine, anyway, and gave us a chance to wax
philosophic about toast ("toast is bread; bread is life; therefore
toast is life" - okay, guess you had to be there).

IG housed a couple of sound systems (including the one at VW), and
even sported a live ambient act (this was tres cool!!!). But no trip
to IG was complete without becoming captive to the electronic moaning
pyramid.

Bio-Jeff's camp area

This kicked ass! There were some killer tunes being spun at this
camp. This actually felt like a full on party; the dance area was
somewhat small (after all, it was someone's camp site), but it was
room enough for the friends and wanderers to shake it to some
progressive house and trance.

the Chai tea hut

The best part of this trip had to have been the Chai tea hut. First of
all, the people who put this on are really special people, and they
did their best to make this a really special place to hang out. The camp
was an pit stop on the way to rave camp, or perhaps a place to chill after
partying all night, or maybe a place to relax and enjoy a stimulating
beverage. To some, it was the ultimate chill room. To others, it was a 
place to enjoy a spiritually soothing tea.

In short, the Chai tea room rocked. Random DJ's would come in and out
and spin their finest. The music tended to be more chill, but I did
get to hear a couple of rilly hot jungle sets [and oh does Steve loooove
jungle :)]. The energy of the room was split; part of the room swayed on
a dance area in front the DJ; another part was engaged in captivating
conversation, while enjoying a cup of tea. Yet another part participated
in the hustle and bustle of standing in line and being served. Yet despite
this, there was a consistent vibe in the room, and for some reason I
was compelled to spend large amounts of time there.

Finally, cheers to the people for making it free. The $1 donation was
just that; a donation. I felt happy to give them my money, and felt
even more happy to know that I had a choice in the matter.

the Sister's of Perpetual Indulgence, inc.

The beautiful and oh-so-glamorous drag queens that blessed my nipples
at the Gay Pride Parade were at BM in full force, conveniently located
near the Chai hut. Although my nipples have long since lost their
magical powers, I was still happy to see the Sisters and get some
wonderful photos.

the Main Stage

Most of the bad music at Burning Man was blared from the main
stage. It was here that I was subjected to annoying folk groups, bar
style rock-n-roll, and other atrocities. Occasionally, some cool music
did go down at the main stage, but it was few and far between. For the
most part, a trip to the main stage made me feel like I had accidently
stepped into Lolapalooza.

The Man

No, not the Burning Man, the Man. You know, THE Man. Anyway, I was
quite dismayed to find out that someone was actually busted for
smoking pot. Especially dismayed considering that a terrible accident
happened on the playa involving a stupid idiot who did not belong
behind a wheel. There were other idiots, too, which brings me to my
point:

Shouldn't they be more worried about protecting people from getting
killed in the desert? I'm not saying to have traffic laws on the
playa, but prehaps something (?).

Drum Circles

All I can say is that I'm bringing a drum next year. Very tribal, very
cool.

Rave Camp

The first thing that comes to mind when I think of Rave Camp is
inconvenience. Having bikes helped quite a bit, but the ride at night
was a bit frightening at worst, yet creepy and cool at best. I think
I might have been equally as happy for there to have been no rave
camp, or perhaps to have one or two sound systems on the outskirts of
the main camp. I more enjoyed the small gatherings around a DJ's tent
than anything else. But some things stood out:

CCC

The CCC parties truly kicked ass: non-stop goa and a really good
crowd. Friday night was especially good; KoxBox put on a powerful
performance. I think there's something really intense about seeing
live techno; somehow feel more of a connection with the music. Anyway,
this party was still raging in full force when I left at 8am. Was
anyone else there? This night landed in Steve's top 10 Coolest Party
list (yet another underground list).

Gateway

Gateway's setup was very cool. The camp was surrounded by all of the
speaker systems (theater in the round, if you will), with this
"structure" in the center. The tall structure housed the DJ, lasers,
lights, and "cool stuff" (sorry, had to be there). No complaints about
the music of course (always love a good Gateway night). The vibe was
little mixed; seemed to be that there were more rave tourists at
Gateway than CCC. Maybe just my warped imagination, but I was having
trouble connecting with the people there. The supply shop on the way
was a cute idea, where one could buy glow stix and BlowPops(tm).

Wicked

Not my thing at all. I'm not a big fan of house (I have been known to
enjoy some prog house on occasion, though), and there seemed to be
enough of the wailing diva thing to drive me away. I stopped by to
check out the visuals, which were not bad. I was more impressed
visually by Gateway's setup and CCC's cool Eastern inspired artwork.
But it seemed that Wicked went off; everyone there had a great
time. Again, I think it just wasn't my thing.

Spaz

Where was this? I heard all sorts of rumors ranging from their
generator crapped out, their stuff never showed up, and other things
like oh yeah, they're on tonight. Rumor also had it that they were
spinning some jungle. So what's the real scoop on Spaz?

the Logistics

arg! Rave camp was just too damn far; it's a terrible accident just
waiting to happen [oh wait. it *did* happen :(]. Most people don't
have cars, so you're forced to either walk (too far and dangerous) or
hitch a ride (flakey at best). I felt safe biking there, but it was
still rather sketchy. I got a ride one night, but getting a ride back
never worked well. We were trapped in the freezing cold of the playa,
wandering around dehydrated, hoping someone would pick us up (someone
did eventually).

Camping at rave camp also seemed like a bad idea. Being trapped two
miles away from all of the energy of Burning Man... Someone has got to
think this out better for next year or just not have it. There were
enough music acts and DJ's wandering about main camp to keep one
entertained, anyway.

All in all, rave camp was pretty cool with a fair amount of faults.
We'll see what happens next year.

The Man (the other one)

The actually burning ceremony was very intense. I managed to get on
top of someone's truck to get a good view (short people don't fare
well in large crowds) and snap some yummy photos. It started with an
erie pagan procession (in fact, the whole of BM was very pagan) of
fire and drums. The Man finally exploded with an array of fireworks
and explosives, until it finally burned itself to death.

The burning ceremony left me with an unreal feeling of having been
cleansed; it felt as if all of the baggage from the past year had
burned down with man. I left the ceremony with somewhat of a high, a
rush, and a new lease on life.

But the feeling was somewhat like New Year's day. You come home after
bringing in the new year and throwing out the old. Life is fresh
again. Then you see that pile of bills on the kitchen table. It's the
same year. The baggage is back, and you're still paying for it. Oh
well, it was still a good time anyway :)

Naked People

They were there, and they were muddy. Would you expect anything else?

Other Stuff

Burning Man was a feast for the eyes with colorful people wandering
around and creative types showing you their best. There was always
something to do 24-7, although the daytime tended to slow down. Too
hot, and many were sleeping. I can't even possibly describe (or
remember) everything that happened... Fortunately, I took a good 5 or
6 rolls of film to help jog my memory.

I'm glad to be home. Life on the playa is very harsh (have the bloody
nose and dusty lungs to prove it), and it's nice to be able to run to
Safeway and take a shower again. This won't stop me from going next
year, though. Much of my time was spent thinking of things to do and
bring and all sorts of different ways I can contribute to the
celebration. I'm already getting excited about BM'97! Just call me
impatient :)

     I know I've never met you, but I have to get this off my chest... I've 
     decided to post this publicly because we seem to value positivity, 
     maintaining a degree of community, and the occasional difference of 
     opinion.  I just want to share my opposing viewpoint.
     
     I'm going to give Bryan the benefit here and read his words at face 
     value.  It's actually a pretty good summation of what must have been a 
     pretty turbulent time.  Maybe you could have asked him what he meant 
     personally...
     
     This is a pretty shitty time to be negative and cynical.  Some people 
     got hurt at no fault of their own, and your message read (IMO) like an 
     "I told you so" to those who were 'foolish' enough to drive out to BM.
     
     I think the best thing we can do is hope the loss is minimal, 
     emotionally, physically, and spiritually.  I don't know too much about 
     what happened, but I can imagine regardless of the outcome a lot of 
     things will change for those injured, and those close to them.  This 
     is the time when human strength is tested, and I hope we can all work 
     together in doing anything we can to help.
     
     Maybe we've gotten spoiled on having our hand held by the false sense 
     of security enforcement through fear of punishment we have exercised 
     since the dawn of civilization.  Maybe responsibility cannot be 
     enforced, regardless of law.  Maybe a lot of things could have 
     happened differently regarding this and maybe there's some force that 
     determines a degree of predestination.  I don't know.  Do you?  I just 
     don't think a spirit of freedom or anarchy or anything hurt those 
     people.  What hurt those people was a confused / fucked up / scary 
     individual who decided his/her right to drive was more important than 
     other's right to safety.  That choice MAY have been biased by more law 
     enforcement, or stiffer penalties, or concrete bunkers, or even 
     another beer but the responsibility has to go back to the individual
     
     What would we be like if we couldn't blame 'society' for anything?

Dear All;

        I've officially started looking for a place out in the burbs, or in
a very low crime area in SF. I'm on a month to month lease so I have plenty
of time to find the right situation/person/place. I'm looking for
accountable/responsible/financially responsible person who likes and
appreciates cats & a non-smoking, noisey, PRIVATE, cancer; who keeps very
odd & unusual rotating hours.

        The most important things in my search for a possible house mate are
communication, responsibility, good sense of humor, sense of give & take,
consideration, and most of all a concerted effort not to turn our home into
a hostel or party house(privacy).

        My max. for the use of 1 extremely large bedroom or 2 bedrooms in a
multi-bedroom apartment or house, in SF is, 800 -  900/month including
utilities.

Call 800-590-4993 and leave a message or respond via e-mail.

Peace
Brian

Having camped roughly between Gateway and Spaz I can say they were
definitely there and playing music much of the time, from hard acid to
jungle to dub to ambient to hip-hop. I heard they played straight up rock
on Friday before we got there. They were evidently using Dave Bayer's sound
system.

	to my knowledge, the gyu was not smoking pot.  they guy was

	doing us a service.  this guy was being dumb with his actions

	they are super lenient (this is NEVADA, remember?) with bman
	but had no choice in this case.

	not only that, but they took him in on *possession*, which again
	is just hugely lenient, considering what he had could have put
	him away for at least a few years, even in california.

	if this is the same arrest you are thinking of, then i am happy
	to provide you with this information so you can make a more informed
	judgement about the police prsence there.  cops suck until you
	are ketting your ass kicked to shit in some alley someplace,
	remember that.

	what?  do you see how ludicrous this is?  what would have

	20/20 hindsight is easy.  there is nothing that could have

	middle of nowhere with no lights or not though. no details

	basically, i diddn't go there for a rave.  raves are super new
	to bman.  and they by their nature are loud.  on the playa you
	respect each other, and many people don't want beats all night
	long, pure and simple.  i know i diddn't, i wanted four hours
	or so a night of quiet(er).  anyway, most people don't go there
	for a rave - but are psyched that they are there to go to anyway.

>SFR'ers). Well, that was VW. This camp was the place to be! What

Oh, I don't know about that.  Behind the Chai tent didn't suck, believe me.
;^)  Free Chai, got a chance to work with the Chai Guys (Taylor and Nate),
and hear their most excellent music the whole time.

We arrived Thursday noonsih and had some trouble deciding where to camp at
the rave camp.  After a while we decided to curb the debate and just look
around.  The minute five of us got to main camp we knew we needed to stay
there.  Then, in a flash of fortune, my friend Saun ran into other friends
(Logan and Lisa) who had helped the Chai guys set-up their excellent site.
They invited us to camp behind them, in a spacious area, and we jumped at
the opportunity, not knowing just how cool a spot it was.

Mornings they played very interesting mellow music.  Some very, very
interesting sleeping music; during the day they would put in tapes or spin;
at night they would play very cool Jungle.   DJ Flux spun as did some dude
named Charles.

I spun my first set!!  Yup, and boy was it fun.  Unfortunately, the only
regret I have this year is that I didn't bring *my* records, but I spun
Taylor's wide-ranging records and managed to get people smiling.  I think
my tape of The Girl From Ipanima, at around noon on Saturday was the
hightlight.  Some how the music fit perfectly with the ambiance.
Unfortunately one turntable went nuts during a Pink Floyd tune and it
sounded like the Chipmunk version, so I had to play a tape and then a
record, and so on...

Anyay the vibe was always kicking in there.  The set-up was fantastic, and
since it was fully enclosed a great escape from all going on around us.  An
oasis of sorts, and protected well from dust storms.  It's now a pile of
ash, since they burnt it yesterday.

Me too.  We were the ones set-up out back of that, with camo netting.  It
was nice to be able to grab a beer and chill in their.   And did I mention
free Chai!?  (Oh, I guess I did...)  At one point I filled a pot of water
for nate and put it on the stove, came in the tent and told him.  He
behaved as if I had helped him create something terribly special.  He said,
"Oh, yes, thank you sooo much.  And in a half hour we have chai.  That's
how you do chai...."   Chai to them is more of a meditation, or energy if
you will, than a smooth, spicy elixir.

They sell their Chai from Santa Cruz, I'll post the address when I bring
their card to work.  It truly is fantastic chai tea.

I think a shuttle system would work perfectly, and not let people drive

However it truly was pale in comparison to last year.  In fact the whole
"tribal feel", and participation level was minimal comparied to last year.
There were far too many spectators, I feel..

They were set-up just south of Gateway.  (On the circle, they were to the
south west.)  It was a fairly small set-up, and while the music always
sounded good, there was never really a crowd there.  They had few banners
or other devices to draw attention to them, maybe intentionally?

Well, from the sound of it, it doesn't look promising that there will be
another one, or I imagine another one of that magnitude.

>The actually burning ceremony was very intense. I managed to get on

Again, there were so many people, I felt that unless you were really intent
on being in front, it was impossible to feel anything beyond too intense.
To put it into my perspective, last year once the man fell, there were
about 15 drumming circles and lots of people jumping over various fires.
The Man was also closer to the sound systems, so thay had wild, crazy noise
coming from all directions and peopel were beating ruthlessly on anything
that made noise.  It was much easier to get close to the burn, and people
were leaping over teh bruning man in all directions.  This year there was
just a big crowd.  We split pretty soon after the fall because we couldn't
get close to anything, and certainly couldn't see shit.

I'm glad it left someone with those feelings, for I didn't get any of that.
I just got smoke from burning hay, and a big ass crowd which freaked my
friend out.

Yes, it was, and that is truly amazing.   =)

Hmmm...Interesting to see what the final analysis is from the Burning Man
organizers.

Catch you on the flip side....

Two things:

One, it was 8am (daylight) and they were not in the middle of nowhere, they
were tucked into the area around Gateway.  I gave one of them a ride 12
hours prior, and they were nestled in among other tents and cars.  The
person barreled right into the center of a god damn camping area.  It could
have been any tent around there, and why it was the one that it was is not
a question worth pondering.

Two, at this point, I don't believe we know what the individual was on. The
assumption is it was alcohol, but that hasn't been released yet.  It was
8am, and the person was heading to the rave camp, who knows what he was
doing.

The only person who could have prevented it was the driver.  All the
responsiblity lies with him.  I assume that he took his driver's test
and knew he shouldn't have done what he did.  The victims were in the
midst of the camp.  We took care to park to minimize the risk of a car
hitting our tent, but if he had veered a few feet to the left I would
be writing this from the hospital.  I was worried about the
possiblity;  in the future I think it should be necessary to "circle
the wagons" to protect the tents.  Some camps were set up like this
and it was much more safe and cozy.

Well, it looks as if I didn't finish letting go of everything in my 
life that was old, unsatisfying, and decaying when I left BM.

I came back to the real world to be rudely awakened: I was laid off 
from my job!!! Although the shock of being rudely dismissed, with no 
warning or severance, is still reverberating from my spine, this 
isn't all bad news. The company is a royal mess. The project I was 
hired to participate in (redesigning and rewriting all their software 
for their primary application, a task that is sorely needed) has been 
delayed indefinitely because the company is currently for sale. The 
practices they have used to administer systems, write software, and 
do custom installations, is more screwed up than at any company I 
have ever worked for. This was hard to imagine, given how fucked up 
things were at my previous employer, whom I resigned from 
voluntarily.

So, anyway, I'm back on the job hunt once again, with the possibility 
of finding a super position that will finally give me the opportunity 
to be paid for my creativity and intuitiveness. 

I was going to post my own review of BM, but others here summed it up 
pretty well. I had a blast -- it was my very first BM -- and am eager 
to attend next year, should it happen. In fact, Jamie and I have this 
ambition to create an awesome chill space with great chill out 
ambient for the rave camp -- something that was really missing this 
year. [The one big chill space in the rave camp was very attractive, 
and seemed comfortable, but the music was so awful, it drove 
everyone away, and it sat largely empty.]

Anyway, please send me lots of warm, fuzzy vibes my way. I'll keep 
working on building up my own.

Attempting to focus on the positive,

Subject: A Few Good Thing About BM
Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

Dear All;

        I will share three, of the few, good things that happened at BM.
First, the Black H### from India I got was the shit. Second, I got to drive
naked on the Playa; and even picked up a few hitch hikers while doing so (It
was unexpected & they were totally cool about it/desperate for a ride to the
rave camp). Third & finally the energy around the man when it Burned. 

        I was working security trying to keep 50k people out of the fire
once the Man fell. I was standing in between the people, and the man;
wearing my silver reflective jacket, tan ranger safari hat, black vinyl
pants(opps 4 of the good things, I wore vinyl in the desert; just because),
and my black rubber boots with the reflective strip up the back, holding a
very powerful flashlight.
        
        When the man fell, and the crowd rushed I initially felt afraid(no
other rangers around, just me), but comfort soon overcame me as I saw that I
wasn't going to get pushed into the fire, and just danced around it for a
little while and left.

        I had a first hand inside look at the level of dis-organization
present with the organizers of BM, and I won't be back. If you honestly want
to hear about it write me and I will happily tell you, but it's not going
public.

        To sum it all up between the hassle, the speeding ticket I got,
purchasing(ticket, rental car with the inside lights stuck on, loud as a
Harley Davison in heat rental generator, caring about & working an event no
one seemed to cared about, special food, extra water, equipment, stuff, $$$,
...etc), 4 x un/packing, 4 x un/loading (3 stories to the car), 3 x setting
up, moving while I was there, the dust, the dust, the dust, repacking,
reloading, the dis-organization, the loss of life, the un-necessary injury
of innocent people, & finally; but I could go on; the f###in dust; it wasn't
worth it; FOR ME.

        I honestly wished I had gone to Florida, stayed in a nice Hotel with
room-service, ate out, saw Sasha, saw loved & missed friends, and partied
with DJ Mark, & DJ Scott amongst others; now that's my idea of a vacation.

Peace
Brian

Having been the victim of crime enough times (won't go into details;
some of you know the folklore) where the police have been nowhere to
be found, I will admit that my tendency is to be anti-police. Thanks
for the additional information, though.

I also have to admit, though, that I was under the impression that
they weren't there to police anyone's lifestyle. Of course they have
to do their job, but I can't help but be disturbed by it.

Actually, I do hear what I'm saying:

Someone else on the list suggested a shuttle system. This is a great
idea!  A lot of people had problems getting to rave camp and were
equally dismayed about the safety factor. I'm surprised there weren't
more such accidents.

Maybe if we get enough suggestions together, we can help the BM and
rave camp organizers make a safer and cooler event for next year. I'm
not talking about a crime/punishment system. Just some more practical
ideas. Thoughts?

What sort of transportation did you have? If you had something
motorized, then you were one of lucky ones (best of both worlds). But
for others, where we camped largely determined our BM experience.

It will be somewhat redundant for me to say that I had a great time at
Burning Man, but I think that this last weekend may have changed my
life. I saw so many cool people doing so many cool things that it really
did much to reconnect me to a world that I felt was slowly receding from
me. Every so often I need to be reminded how much life rocks.

I too camped with Irrational Geographic (in the RV right next to the
V-MAR truck), and probably met most of you sfravers who were around at
one point or another. The camp was amazingly geek-positive, and it was
startling how much diversity there was among the folks in our camp. Some
of the people there didn't do much for me, but hey, that's just like the
real world, too.

I'm surprised that none of you have mentioned Vince's amazing bubble
tower, which was an example of useless technology at its finest. Solar
powered, over 20 feet tall, and all it did was blow bubbles. That's
fucking *cool*.

I won't recount everything that I saw or heard over the course of the
weekend, because it would be meaningless and boring (and probably
envy-inducing to many of you), but I will say that Burning Man is a
fantastic experience that needs YOUR direct participation in it to make
it the most beautiful thing it can be. It can continue to grow
indefinitely (man, there's plenty of room on the playa), but only if
everybody's willing to do their parts to make it happen.

Along those lines, shouts out to sfravers Jon Logan, Tom Leichardt, and
Wayne Correia (and non-sfraver but all-around cool guy and WBL Sound
co-owner Peter Lasell) for their cool sets on the WBL sound system. And
of course, Burning Man would not be complete for me without a set by
Weird Blinking Lights. I personally had a great time spinning the
weirdest music that I own (come on -- why play it safe when you're at
Burning Man?) and I hope that those of you who heard my spinning were not
completely repulsed by it.

Also, a big shout out to all of the people who were willing to take
chances and transcend their daily personalities and just *freak* *out*
for Burning Man. BMan wouldn't be the insanely energetic and obdurately
unclassifiable *thing* that it is without the loons, freaks, and mutants
that were in such abundance on the playa.

I did go check out the rave camp, but it didn't do much for me. I _am_
sorry that I missed some of the sets that I did (I personally would have
loved to hear Joe Rice go off), but I think the way to go in the future
is to just scatter the various rave camps at the far edges of the main
camp, and not have a separate rave camp off on its own. As many others
have noted, you can go raving any time -- Burning Man is special. I'm
sorry, but if you went to Burning Man primarily to rave, I won't say that
you were there for the wrong reason (as far as I'm concerned, the only
wrong reason to go to Burning Man (paradoxically) is if you're there
_only_ to get drunk and set things on fire), but you probably missed out
on a truckload (or two or three) of really cool, bizarre things.

And one last thing: the wedding ceremony I witnessed on Sunday morning at
the Spiral Oasis was easily one of the most moving and touching things
I've ever witnessed. I may be jaded, and I may not know Kevin Matthieu
and his bride-to-be that well, but I was very profoundly moved by the
ceremony and only wish that more weddings out in "the world" could share
the same sort of amazing power.

They were in Gateway camp.  The sun was coming up; he was not driving
into the sun.  He had to drive past a huge tent to hit them (he hit
one tent and then another some 30 feet away).  So there you have it.

[take 2 -- network error occurred on the first try, resulting in a 
blank message...]

Well, it looks as if I didn't finish letting go of everything in my 
life that was old, unsatisfying, and decaying when I left BM.

I came back to the real world to be rudely awakened: I was laid off 
from my job!!! Although the shock of being rudely dismissed, with no 
warning or severance, is still reverberating from my spine, this 
isn't all bad news. The company is a royal mess. The project I was 
hired to participate in (redesigning and rewriting all their software 
for their primary application, a task that is sorely needed) has been 
delayed indefinitely because the company is currently for sale. The 
practices they have used to administer systems, write software, and 
do custom installations, is more screwed up than at any company I 
have ever worked for. This was hard to imagine, given how fucked up 
things were at my previous employer, whom I resigned from 
voluntarily.

So, anyway, I'm back on the job hunt once again, with the possibility 
of finding a super position that will finally give me the opportunity 
to be paid for my creativity and intuitiveness. 

I was going to post my own review of BM, but others here summed it up 
pretty well. I had a blast -- it was my very first BM -- and am eager 
to attend next year, should it happen. In fact, Jamie and I have this 
ambition to create an awesome chill space with great chill out 
ambient for the rave camp -- something that was really missing this 
year. [The one big chill space in the rave camp was very attractive, 
and seemed comfortable, but the music was so awful, it drove 
everyone away, and it sat largely empty.]

Anyway, please send me lots of warm, fuzzy vibes my way. I'll keep 
working on building up my own.

Attempting to focus on the positive,

Having just returned to my senses after a week away, most of that in 
the desert, I wanted to share some of my moments with everybody.. Most
of them probably won't make sense to anyone, but having said that..


What made the trip special:

Realizing that there are people I could get to know better, want to know
better, and am getting to know better because they are really amazingly
cool people.  Having the *mellowest* rv mates on the planet.

Finally meeting people in person I have only known online and being
intensely happy to see them there.

Eden and Forrest getting a hardcore game of Set going and watching all the
hilarious insults they were throwing at each other.

Not missing logging in.  Ever.

Finally having a camera that actually worked, and taking tons of beautiful
pictures, specifically of the piano bell at sunset and the amazing fishtank
pagoda book whateveritwas sculpture on the path to the man.

Dancing at Gateway on Saturday night with glowsticks in my braids and
just giving them away to anybody who asked if I was selling(!?) them,
and then handing them out to people on the bike ride back who didn't have
any lights so they didnt get creamed by cars in the dark.  Spinning
around playing fairies with my housemate Sarah and her glowstick tu-tu.

Floating around in the hot springs watching the clouds overhead, wondering
if it would rain.

Riding through the desert with Justin and Kyra, the only sounds we could
hear was the bicycle chain cranking and the sound of our own breath.

Sitting with abby waiting for the circus to finish, sharing some kind
of moment together, realizing we had something to share..

The twinking lights on the horizon reflecting the ones in the sky, which
strangely looked deeper than I remember them being before.  

Giving bad haircuts to poor innocent victims in the center of our camp, 
wielding the rattling clippers with a maniacal grin and a deceptively calm
"oh I think you'd look great with a 1/4" of hair"...

Playing Kia's house of beauty, braiding the hair of some very appreciative
salon patrons (thanks for the hugs kyra, kt, and wayne) and getting to wash 
hair in the rv sink with REAL SALON SHAMPOO (ouh la la).

The most beautiful surreal ambient guitar music as we glided onto the playa
in the rv, everyone too stunned to speak..

Forrest stationed always in front of the turntables, playing some great 
music I hadn't heard and some that I had, and keeping him awake until
sunrise with Peter and Eden cackling and teasing each other with stories
until the sun chased us inside to bed.

Being served grilled cheese sandwiches and sangria at the Bianca Troll
Smut Shack by Chris, who is sooooo dreamy.

Hearing (true!) alien abduction stories from people in my camp.

Being accosted by an 8 foot long armadillo in the middle of the desert

Sleeping in the shade

meeting trippers

smiling and giggling and howling

the alien landing strip

sunsets

total silence

loud explosions

watching a helicopter land and spray dust everywhere, having the feeling I
was in a movie 

the wbl pyramid noises
 
watching as kyra became a techno hindu goddess and smiling at the dyad she
and justin created 

the tower at gateway

"it's all good"

spinning glowsticks with dave and then with aron

meeting ravers from everywhere, meeting goths from everywhere, meeting
crazy people and normal people and geeks and survivalists and people
who ended up there at random from foreign countries

sharing a good book with a new friend

rj's funky trail mix

wondering what I never made it to see

seeing the fog on the way into san francisco, being able to see over the
edges of the bay bridge

being glad to come home again and taking the longest most relaxing hot
shower I've ever had

lighting a candle and praying for the ones who got what they never expected
and never deserved, and hoping they will be alright, and hoping those that
died will be at peace.

peace all, enjoy your memories because really they are all we have

Thursday, we get it all together in the late afternoon and roll off to Black
Rock City in our rented mobile home (the definate choice of vehicles to take
to the man). We were all apprehencive about driving this huge vehicle but
everything rolled well. We get to the entrance to the playa. Following the
instructions (never follow instructions!!!!) we passed the entrance and
pulled a u-turn. At this point our driver pulled another u-turn to enter the
entrance and bottomed out the rear bumper to the RV and our tires sat there
spinning????? Now what???? We flagged some people down to let the people at
the entrance know we were stuck??? After a few hours we decided to ride our
bikes to the main entrance. After arriving we explained our situation to the
people at the gate and they said they would try and figure it out. One of the
rangers gave us a jack to try putting wood under the tires. Back at the RV a
local Cowboy type had a few fence posts that he helped put under the tires,
this was not happening. Eventually this 4 wheel drive gear head showed up and
wrapped a chain around the RV's tow bar and reemed us back on the road, not
without some well deserved sarcasm about our getting into this predicament,
o' course. Just to show beer swilling macho gear heads have a place in our
world too. Okay, we're on the playa now and off to rave camp.... The rave
scene is not happening, tonight. The person on the turbo sound system is
spinning some weird techno stuff that isn't happening. Gateway has someone
spinning meltdown ambient and some other tiny sound system with bkinking
strobe lights is also spinning meltdown swoosh music. Our friends we know are
there are all sleeping so we head for no mans land to catch some zzzz's.
 
Friday, we spend the morning trying to hook up with some friends and
aimlessly cruising camp. Eventually, we hook up and set up bass camp near
what became the ill fated mousetrap game. Spent the day cruising camp scoping
out what was gonna blow! Helco was setting up a miniature mockup of a
corporate nightmare, labeling buildings with coporate logo's like Caca Shell
(Taco Bell), sorry but I can't remember the rest, and a 16 story miniature
skyscrapper. Then there was Tinsel Town with huge posters o' famous hollywood
actors like Arnald Swatrzeneger(SP?), Jim Carrol etc...They all had 666
painted on there foreheads and plastic explosives stuck to the posters. The
lingum was up and this years version had the look of  "an early eighties Ozzy
Osborne stage" to quote me directly??? "Goin off the rails on a crazy
train"..... Guess you had to be there? It was starting to cool down so I knew
we could turn the AC off in the RV, which meant we had enough power to fire
up our junior sound system. I started off playing some cool mellow dub (this
was on purpose to subtly not offend anyone in the near vacinity). No one is
offended by dub music at any point of the day (This is a good DJ tip),
gradually building the bpm through slow ambient to fast ambient to full on
hardcore house shit (over a period of a few hours of course). Its now evening
and we head "downtown" to see what is goin down. As we approach downtown we
catch sound of some smooth funky trip hop kinda stuff to arrive at the main A
frame stage and find a live act performing some awesome music. Unfortunately
we only catch the last two songs : (   Then some weird fat lady with a dildo
the size o' Kansas and a bunch o' similarly freaked out people hit the stage
for some wacko obnoxious stage antics, my friends and I have a low tolerance
for this sort o' entertainment and head off to check the man which has just
been lit. On approach we note the virtually full moon is hallowing the mans
head, unfortunately none of us has a camera (a serious mental picture has
been engraved in my psyche though, heavy shit). At the man we run into a
bunch o' the wick'd posse and get the lown down on whats up with the turbo
2-nite!! SRL is near by shredding some bails o' hay and torching shit and
general SRL madness. Back to camp for a cocktail party. General comradery and
another friends ancient family steelwool burning party gag. Its getting late
and we decide to roll out to turbo land actually checking out the other sound
systems on the way. We are house people and generally snub those trancy
techno thangs and eventually make it to the turbo (I actually like trance in
small doses at opportune moments but not to party all night long). I can't
remember who was on when we got there but it wasn't doing much for me. After
about an hour I head to the RV to catch some zzzz's while sleeping I hear the
shit starting to go off. At about 3AM my friend comes in to inform me that
Markie is tearing shit up.I decide, I better roll out o' slumber and boogie
to another unrelenting AM Markie set!!! Thank You Markie!!! (Cids vote for
best DJ set o' the weekend for those keeping tabs?). 

Saturday, The sun is up and its starting to blaze. This is where the RV comes
into play. AC on--- Cid out, snoozzzzzzeville. Wake up in the early afternoon
for pancake breakfast, shower (oh how good it felt), and even a shave? We
roll into Gerlach to fill up on gas and water. You know we weren't going to
run out o' gas and not be able to sleep all day!! We get lost coming back and
pass camp and eventually do a u-turn and hit rave camp first. CB and some
other  cat are doing 5 on 5 off reggae dub thang. We decide to start cooking
dinner while we head toward main camp cause shit is gonna blow tonight!!!
Quick chow on Veggie Curry over rice,mmmm. And off to Helco. After about an
hour of "foreplay" (actual quote from one of BlackRocks finer citizens
"enough forplay"). The SRL machine is lighting varius thangs on fire and
shredding other stuff. Cats are running around in orange jump suits with
flame throwers on there backs lighting shit up. Unfortunately most of the
Helco site was constructed out of some kind of flame retardent wood, The shit
wasn't burning to good? Eventually some Demonic superhero climbs to the top
of the sky scrapper lights a flare and flings it into the skyscrapper.
Instant towering inferno everyone is running back away because shit is
getting hot. After some mayhem off to Tinsel town, where they are playing
this really wierd tape which is a psychology discussion of the social
implications of the movie "Reefer Madness"(voted track most needed by
Moonpup). They eventually played more weird audio snipets and threw reels of
film into the audience which unwound in a tangled mess. I found winding small
strips of film in a tight cylinder and throwing them back at Tinsel Town like
confetti amusing. Eventually everything starting burning and blowing up. Next
came the lingham. A long drawnout Demonic operetic parade that went on and on
and on and on and on and on and on and on and on............preceded the
burning of the lingam. Eventually the lingam burned in all its glory. It
burned for a long time and we decided it was partytime. Back to camp and
fortunately all our posse was there and jumped in the RV and headed to the
turbo pyramid. To get thangs started, we had a sort o' rave style cocktail
party. A little o' this a little o' that hint, hint ; )'  ; )'   ETI and
Astral Matrix were together ripping out some sick, I mean sick,  Hardcore
Acid House shit (Cids vote for best live musical performance o' the weekend).
Thoughts out to Andrew!!! Praying all goes well!!! Garth eventually came on
and slowed down with some Dubby stuff and continued in the Garth vain until
the we morning hours. Tracy came on around sunrise and did the Tracy groove
thang.....

Sunday, slept until about 4PM (The RV AC is the shit!!!!) Got up turned off
the AC powered up the Sound system and played the Cid burning set (voted set
that contained most burning references all weekend). Closed with B-side to
Country Joes Feel Like I'm Fixin to die Rag single circa 1967, "Fire in the
City Tonight" by Peter Krugg(heavy shit).  Off to the man...... Mega big
circle at least 300 yards across good move by organizers on this one.
Contemplating how many people are there( 20000???). Way more than last year.
This was the best actual burning of the man I witnessed in the last 3 years.
The wind was calm the man stood for a real long time and then the organizers
started pulling on the wires and the man started doing this drunken stuper
kind o' dance like he would fall down. Kind of gave me a vision of an Indian
on the trail of tears that wouldn't fall you know. (voted best burningman of
the last 3 years changed colors and everythang!!!). Since then everythang has
been a blur spent the day cleaning white shit off everythang I took to the
desert. Anyone have a good recipe for a cleaning solution????? Have a great
night, Peace! Cid

 Being concerned for the saftey of yourself and others is in no way 
ludicrous. There are ways people can protect each other; we mearly have 
to use our brains. Since, in one sense, BM is about experimental communal 
states, in order to survive Bm will have to be self-regulating (IMHO) to 
a certain extent.

 A possible solution would for folks to camp within protective circles of 
vehicles.

 All I know is that a friend of mine is in the hospital; perhaps dying... 
I sincerly hope that enough people will care about this situation and 
it's implications to want to do something about it.

You can reach Solid Grooves at (408) 999-0259. I don't think that they
open before 12 noon. They are located on Bascom Ave. near San Carlos.

Peace Brother,

 Since this may be relavant I will post it, however it is only just a rumor:

 Word is that the driver who hit the tents in the Gateway camp was only 
asleep at the wheel. No inebriants were involved. [remember; rumor only 
from my viewpoint]

 My sympathies to the Gateway folks and organisers - that could not have 
been fun to deal with in your camp. Big heartfelt hug and healing vibes 
to those that were hurt and to those who love the folks that were hurt. 
My heaqrt cries for those folks who suffered.

Peace,

one of the most amazing experiences ive ever had! :)

the VW camp was awsome, fortunetly there was a sound system and a radio 
tower so we went live on the air... the vibe was awsome, those who 
participated in teh experience added so much crazyness, so much 
creativity:) 
i trully felt myself resonate with the earth, especially after soaking 
in the hot springs on the edge of the playa. i got there wednesday, and 
set up camp with tim (knucklehead) from then on it was amazing to see it 
come together. the energy rose with each day untill sunday nite, and the 
man burned. fire is very clensing and the release of energy was very 
comforting - thats a great way to put it, teh whole event was very 
soothing and comforting. it was a  place where intuition and going with 
teh flow was primary focus, quite the opposite of modern society. it was 
a place where we cared for one another, and 15,ooo people surviving 
together sooo playfully :)  there is so much about humanity that has been 
repressed to create our current social structure, and i feel teh time has 
come to take it back, to re open lost channels and create new ones 
because we are ready... to be more human again.
the rave camp seemed to lack energy most of the time, tho teh obvious effort 
was there. 
being so far from main camp seemed to make the energy there sporatic, 
altho there were great moments i had at CCC, gateway (the eight way 
gateway system), and yes, even wicked - there was a clubby vibe most of 
the time i stopped by wicked, but one time there was serious -old school- 
house 
playing that made me groove, really groove:) one thing i thought was 
great was teh mayan ceremony by CCC, which uplifted me and was a nice 
beginning to a saturday nite spent raving at teh three mentioned 
soundsystems.
soooo nice to see sooo many friends, all the sfravers:) and others. 
one nice thing was a lazer originating 2.6 miles away from main camp 
passing over us, coming 
from the tecno ghetto - the ravers were making their presence known:)

i hope there is a BM next year cuz ther is so much more i would love to 
do to participate, now having experienced a BM. one thing i noticed was 
that there were many people who were just there, and seriously i hope 
this is becouse it was their first time as well, cuz definetly more 
people could have participated in the creativity. 

the burning man:
people began to gather and a procession of weirdness made its way 
forward, i loved teh big wooden toast being carried by several people, i 
just got one look at teh thing and couldnt help laughing. 
	words cant 
really explain any of it... so i'll stop here.
 	.all trully amazing.

Aha! I was hoping someone would ask... Well, I have 6 rolls of photos
just *waiting* to be scanned. If anyone has a scanner and a web site,
please let me know. They will be developed by tommorrow.

I'll bring them to Beautiful People and Harmony for anyone who
wants to check out the experience. Just look for the loopy guy
with the Slinky and bicycle lights :)

I understand completely.  My encampment was 200'off the main north road 
connecting Rave Camp with Main Camp, it was 'always' well lit at 
night with both lanterns and tiki torches plus it had four bright tall 
reflectors in a square surrounding the  space, they burned all night long.  
One night someone drove over two of them, as far as I am concerned this was 
way to fucking close to our tent.  In many ways I too feel lucky to be 
alive...  when I left CCC and headed back to my tent around 5 AM after 
the alien burned, there were so many lost people on the playa driving in 
circles kicking up unbelievable amounts of dust (as thick as your worse 
fog nightmare) that I had a  very difficult time finding my camp, this 
was rather scary...  The main road had by this time been overridden by 
countless other tired trails...and which asshole by the way was carving 
deep trenches in the playa all over the place, as if some kind of hoe 
was being dragged behind a car?  A major kick in the ass to you for 
unnecessary negative environmental inpact.... I pray it rains on the 
playa soon...I had no idea that so many creatures dwelt there...  It 
would be eaSy for me to go off on what I feel were tripled negative 
aspects of this years BM... that will follow.

Also, my ceremonial 20" native american drum, including special fancy 
sticks, a pendelton blanket, two large rabbit hides and a special padded 
carrying case was left near the toilets by the door encampment on the 
North Road by a friend, unfortunately whoever found it stole it by not 
turning such a valuable medecine object into the lost and found at the 
Rangers Station...what has happened to honestly?  

A longer report will follow containing both good and negative aspects...

Also, Remember to focus your prayers and 
good energy to those who were critically injured at Rave Camp...
and any others we are unaware of....

YES!!! After three days, I'm finally caught up on sfraves mail.  For those
who don't know, Sen (that's me) is now living in the Andres Castro Arms
Co-op up in the hills of Berkeley.  Being phoneless for a week, life's
just flashed by...to start off I'd like to send a get well prayer to the
people in Nevada.  I'll be the first one here to pledge to never again
allow any of my friends to drive under the influence.  peace to you all.

Hi, Nancy, my fellow co-oper/sfraver.  Thanks for making my transition to
the house so much easier.  Moving into a new living experience with
total strangers is a bit unsettling to say the least.  Especiallysince I'm
a bit anthrophobic. Smiles and conversation is all it takes to make my
day.  :)
To everyone else, hope to meet you this weekend.

Howdy, this is Ken from Pure acid Mixtapes here in L.A.  I just joined
SF raves to see what everyone thought of Burning Man.  We were the
mixtape/glowstick booth located directly between the Gateway & Wicked
sound systems.
Sorry to hear people got hurt!  I knew about the guy who had the
motorcycle accident, but I heard a rumor that there were more
casualties.
Anyway, I had a blast there.  The live CCC performance late Friday night
was amazing...
Good to meet some SF ravers up there, EveryonE I talkEd to was all
smilEs...  Also, can anyone tell me who the female DJ was Sunday night
at the Wicked camp?  I'm not as familiar with SF DJs as I am LA djs.
Thanks!

Well as people were being burnt @ the man this weekend, a small Party called
PUMP happened in the city.

Or at least, tried to happen...

Although didn't go, I heard that the party was busted @ about 1:30am by SF's
Finest.  This is three for three so far: Nation, Hallucination, and now PUMP.
 Well, Halluc. did happen, only after two valiant attempts.  To my knowlage
Pump also had permits, but was busted anyways...  
Looks as though now Slick Wilie is secure in his office as Da Mayor, ravers
will have to be... well ravers, keeping the scene underground....   

Looking for my miners helmet,


Adam

Adam, I was not being negative or cynical.  I was very upset to hear that
two 17 year old KIDS got hurt by an asshole on the playa.  I was also hurt
and angered at some people's reaction to potentially two peoples lives
being ended.  There is very little positive, IMO, that can be said about
the event. Sorry.  I have great contempt for those who find the good in
everything, no matter what.

Two people may have lost their lives, but I had a great time at the
BM...c'mon.  Two kids might not ever get to another BM...these are kids by
all accounts.

Oh well, the party must go on?  I certainly hope not.  This thing was
billed as "Hell", maybe next time people might not want to tempt fate so
directly.  Just my superstitious .02.

Happy happy, Joy Joy BS is not going to lessen the hurt the parents will
feel if their daughter and son are not retuerned home safely.  If *I* were
the parents of those two kids, I would make damn sure there would never be
another event like this ever.  And by any means necessary.  I can say this,
the event will never be the same for me and others.  If it goes on next
year, with the same intent/context I would only hope nobody else gets hurt
or killed.

My sources indicate that it was not minimal.  But I cannot speak from
heresy.  Let those who know what had REALLY happened speak.  You are out
there and you know the truth.  Expose it to the light.

Anyway I believe the loss was great, and as such this, IMO, is no time now
to find the good of BM..  It sucked because people got hurt.  Deflecting
attention from that very REAL fact is just more escapism.

Two people might not ever get a chance to talk about their experiences at
BM.  Why not reflect on that, or is that all too real?

Agreed.  Also this is a time to reflect, IMO, as to what was gained by all
the hype and hoopla of a party that went out of bounds.  I am sure that
this will not be over anytime soon.

Rhetorical.  Force of predestination?  I do not believe in predestination.
I believe in cause & effect.  15,000 people, drugs, booze, and the theme of
Hell/chaos = a formula for something really bad happening to someone there.
That IS what I know at this point.

Freedom? Anarchy?  People wouldn't know what to do with real freedom, and
nobody is really ready for real freedom, that IS why we have laws.  Freedom
means I can take of yours what I wish at any time.  You got food, I want
it, I can take it, same with your drink, your possessions, or your girl/boy
as the case may be.  Freedom, when you look at what it really is, is
something we know we cannot be trusted with, that is why we have systems of
laws to protect ourselves from each others right to do what we wish, i.e.
Freedom.  Yes, Freedom even means I can do what I wish at anyones expense.
Like the driver who was DUI and ran over those kids.  SO I disagree, the
little experiment in the desert failed.  It was only a success because
nobody else was killed injured.  But maybe we don't know that either.  I
would like to know how many have been seriously or fatally wounded at these
events.  I think I am not the only one, as time will tell.


>     What hurt those people was a confused / fucked up / scary

What hurt those people was a person who saw his freedom to have greater
value than that of the others around him.  That is what you get when you
have real freedom.  That is the potential that exists without real laws and
methods of enforcement.  That is the reality of true freedom.  We have
known this for thousands of years.  That is why groups develop prescribed
acceptable modes of behavior.

Well in this instance, there was a society out there, although temporary.
And the finger, just as in the greater, points to it's successes and it's
failures.  This year, was a failure.  Just as in the larger context, when a
person goes to jail or a murder happens, it is an indictment of the society
at large.  Individuals exist in these contexts, together they make a
society.  If a society can make claims of success, then it should be
willing to accept it's failings.

Nothing exists in a vacuum.  Nature abhors one.

Peace & Reflection,
John

Although I didn't attend the BM, and I'm pretty new to the scene, I plan on
devoting part of my web space to the SFRave scene, for what it's worth.

If anyone wants to send me pictures, or art, or whatever, I will be happy
to translate that to the digital media and into the WEB.  I have all the
gear to do whatever...

email me.

Howdy Folks!

I thought Id introduce myself, share my Burning Man experience, and ramble on 
aimlesly about other things. The names Nathan, and Ive been lurking here on the 
list for some time now. Ive been getting really excited about the sense of 
community on the SFRaves list, and am looking forward to checking out some 
upcoming events and meeting some of youz fine peoplez. My AWESOME experience at 
BM, and the Raves camp motivated me to say hi.  Hi!

Short Bio:
24 years here on the Planet. Originally from Boulder, CO. Drawn to the Bay Area 
cause of its coooolness, went to SCU. Went to a few big commercial raves while 
in school, and to some incredible parties when I studied in Berlin two years 
ago. (INCREDIBLE energy over there- lots of spontaneous unplanned parties in 
basements and courtyards of partially bombed, never rebuilt buildings in the 
former East Berlin, with half-buried buses, gutted jet fighters, raw metal work 
art.  Other cool places like Ewerk, a former power plant converted to a disco. 
Entering through barbed-wire gates, dancing in, around and on huge rusted 
machinery and equipment. Before the Wall came down, all young Germans had to 
either serve two years in the Army or do two years community service, unless 
they lived in West Berlin.  W. Berlin became a magnet for all 
artists/writers/other cretive types, and when the Wall came down, they moved 
into the numerous deserted buildings in the East, and have created an amazing 
scene. If you get a chance, check it out soon, as it may not last long. Rents 
are going up,  owners are slowly re-claiming and developing the buildings, the 
capitol was moved from Bonn to Berlin, etc. GO NOW BEFORE ITS TOO LATE!! 

Anywayz, moved to SF, the Greatest City on Earth, a year ago. Work for Big 
Corporate America, but in a small group within BCA; I like my job, I like the 
people, so its not as soulless as it sounds. Also started a web consulting firm 
(shameless plug: www.cwsi.com) last November. Likes: music, motorcycles (anyone 
else got one? lets ride!), food, Yahtzee, enjoying life.

BM was a super experience for me. It was my first one, but I had been planning 
for it for months. It evolved into a Mecca for me, a pligrimage to the Desert, 
a chance to exorcise some personal demons that had been building for some time 
and to turn around some bad karma that was beginning to evolve. My posse was 
the Golden Shower Camp, the folks who brought you the Mass Shower ( and the 
resulting Mud Fashion Show, the Mud Wrestling, and the Slide Contest). It was 
alot of work, but an absolute blast to be able to participate and to let people 
get good n muddy and bond with Mother Earth.  

Very sad to hear about the injuries of the people who were hit in their tent. 
It seems that whenever something great gets big, tragedy seems to follow. Not 
to place blame, but after catching a ride back from the rave camp around 6 am 
on the trunk of a kind souls big american boatster (thanks again if youre out 
there) with Shakti and two other Gents, we were hanging out at the camp 
cleaning up, and there were two pickup trucks of drunk young Yokals racing 
around the camps, tearing through the mud pit splashing tents, and generally 
causing trouble. Im assuming they found the responsible party, but if not, I 
think I got a bit of video of the truck when I was filming the sunrise, and the 
time frame seems to fit.  However, it should be said that the locals were m
ostly very cool. One family of local alfalfa farmers set us hard core with the 
use of their water truck, which was used to bring all that water to the 
shower.  Another older couple gave us some huge inflatable boxing gloves. 

On a related subject, if anyone wants a copy of the video, I have about two 
hours of footage. Email me, and send me a blank tape, and Ill make a copy. Most 
of the scene is taken from the perspective of the Golden Shower Camp, and there 
is unfortuneately no footage of the Rave Camp, but I do have some good scenes 
of the Playa, of Mud People, and of things burning including Helco, the Man, 
and Stonehenge. But I missed the Opera scene and the burning of the Castle, so 
if you happened to film that or other stuff, PLEASE email me and lets trade 
tapes.

Other highlights of BM:     

When I try to explain it to friends, I describe it as sort of a 
combination of a Pagan ritual with a Woodstock with a circus, where all 
12,000 people are the participants. The only rule (social, moral, legal, 
or otherwise), is "do whatever you want, as long as it doesn't affect the 
experience of people around you". It was a weird environment where all 
sociatal restrictions are thrown away. There is so much creative energy put 
into it, it's amazing. Examples: huge Hell-themed opera, that ended with 
the burning of a large ornate castle; bands driving around on trailers, 
everything from heavy metal to polka to a guy with a pipe organ that 
plays mainly the theme from gilligan's island; two incredible rave camps; a 
structure of 80 pianos, that was of course burned; probably 3-4 drum 
circles at any given time; a large recreation of Stonehenge that was 
also burned; drag shows; mud pits, with wrestling, slide contests, fashion 
shows, etc; parachuters; freaky circus acts; motorized couches that 
cruised around; motorized toilets; rocket powered bicycles;  constant 
fireworks; meditation to the melting of a 500 lb. ice sculpture; and, 
naturally, the Burning of the Man itself. All this under a full moon, on 
the very surreal environment of a huge dry lake bed, absolutely devoid of 
features



Enough talk. Lets dance. Im going to try and make it to Harmony this weekend. I 
will probably be wearing a half red and half yellow cat collar with three bells 
on it, and probably some form of velvet. See you there!!

Sometime aroun 8:30 am on Monday morning,  I was cycling back to main camp
from the CCC arena to get breakfast and touch base with some friends.

As I was about halfway to main camp,   some dick head in a car was circling
around me,  trying to get as close as possible and kicking up so much dust that
I could hardly see.    I'm wondering if these were the same people that
ran over the tent.    I suspect not,   but it was a little unsettling to
be out there alone and have to deal with someone in a car,  having fun
at my expense.    Anyway,  they eventually got tired and left me alone.

Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

First off, BM was great. Not what I expected, maybe due to it being my
first time and that I didn't particapate as much as I should have, but I
did have a great time none the less. The CCC camp was awesome. Killer music
and people made it so great. Kox Box and Adam I remember the most. Totally
head trippen sets and the Mayan performance was wonderful.  Over at the
Syntonic\Theta camp, BioJeff throwing down great sets as usual on Sat and
Sun along with Timmy, DJ, Phil on Sunday. The live set by WBL in the IG
camp, DJTom spinning that Goa in the IG/VW camp, and lets not forget
Jonathan "Burger King" Logan mixing up some ambient. After awhile I was
wishing I brought my records.


Homeless because of BM:

Some of you may know a few months ago I moved out of my apt. and into my
mom's house to save some money for new turntables and to move to the city.
Well, that has all changed. The day I returned home my mom was leaving to
pick up my brother from school and said she needed to talk to me. When she
returned she asked....told me I had to move out because she knows what I've
been doing. With a stupid look on my face I asked her what she meant. She
said she found my yellow paper on Burning Man (the one some of you my have
gotten prior to BM) and said Burning Man was about Worshiping Satan.  And
was reading out loud about Hell and Papa Satan going to fart fire and have
people sit on his lap and all the other Satan things it talked about. I
told her it was just a theme and there were several other camps with
different themes. BM wasn't about worshipping satan. Gave her articles to
read and tried to explain everything that went on there and about the
people that were there. Everything I can muster up about BM and what I did
there (exempt for the things mothers and father for that matter shouldn't
know, ie..the little trEAts one indulges in At cErtAin events). But after
it all it didn't seem to help and now I have until this weekend to find a
new place to live. This will be hard, since payday is the 13th and I spent
alot going to BM. How does she expect me to find a place this soon and no
money until the 13th. So me and my little cat will be homeless after this
weekend. If anyone knows of a cheap place that allows a cute little cat
that's in somewhat good area, or possibly a roommate that doesn't mind
having a cute little cat around the house please let me know. I will be
looking anywhere from San Jose to San Francisco. I come with records,
turntables, some household furnishings which I could live in storage if
there isn't room. I'm a great cook, responsilbe, stable job,  plenty of
laughs. I can give you names of people to verify what kind of person I am
If you need them.

Stuck in between a rock and a hard place. This is totally unlike my mom to
do this, she's not even religous. O'well it happened. So if anyone knows of
anything please let email my here or at (knucklehead@geocities.com)

Thanks,

Tim (knucklehead)

The problem I have with this, as well as with your statement that you have
great contempt for those who try to see the good in everything, is
the question of where you draw the line.  Yes, tragedies happened at 
Burning Man, but do they necessarily negate all the good things that
many people seem to have experienced at the event?  Where does one decide
that so much negativity over weighs so much positivity...
My answer is that it's entirely a personal decision, and for you to
label other people's choices of perception as escapism and false is dangerous.
You have the right to do so, but know that I would choose otherwise.

Maybe you know you cannot be trusted with it, but again I feel otherwise.
I feel that I have learned that if I take something from someone else,
eventually something will be taken from me.  If I hurt or endanger
someone or something else, I know that the cycle will eventually come
full circle and the stability of my life will become treacherous.
But I feel confident with freedom and I trust that any liberties I give
to other people will also be given to myself... and I believe that works in
a positive direction as well as a negative direction.  I believe that if
I respect other people, they will respect me, and that if I let everyone
go free, I will become free.  I think laws are a reflection of fear, and
have the potential to be broken down as people learn that we are all in
this together and that what goes around comes around.  I'm willing to
face whatever consequences true freedom brings me... be they good or bad.

> What hurt those people was a person who saw his freedom to have greater

> 
again where do you draw the line?  People die in cars every day.  Right
here on Hwy 17 to Santa Cruz there are accidents, many of them very serious
every day.  So should I decide that Hwy 17 is a failed experiment and force
everyone who wants to commute from Santa Cruz to San Jose to drive an extra
hour through Salinas everyday to protect them?  Should I decide that cars
themselves are a failed experiment and make them illegal to protect all
those people who die every day?  Should I make fishing illegal because I
feel the pain of all the fish dying and the oceans becoming devoid of life?
When you draw one line, you then have to draw another, and another, in a
neverending downward spiral of laws and restrictions to the freedom of life.
I see the reality of true freedom as a means of creating new life, through
change and learning.  through experiencing the darkness of fear and realizing
the light on the other side.

That doesn't mean that bad things aren't bad and shouldn't be avoided, but
it also doesn't mean denying the positive things that surround those
bad things.  You have the freedom to choose and dwell where you will,
and I personally feel that even when I feel pain I have to continue to
strive for loving the life that brought that pain if I want to move onward
in a positive direction.

At the point which you realize that you may never look into a friends 
eyes again, never hear them laugh, never see them smile. 

But hey, there is another party this weekend, right?

To each his own I guess.  What I did was no more flase or dnagerous than 
the denial of the possible death of two kids.  They didn't have a choice 
in the matter, while we sit here arguing over semantics and academics.

The points are hypothetical, and based, in large part of the observable 
nature of humans.  You may just as well be trsuted, the point is there 
will be a person who will not repsect your boundaries, and THAT is where 
the problem starts.

Laws are needed, to keep each of us at a distance from one another.  If 
we decide to join forces and allow each other to share our "space", then 
it's all good.  If respect were common throughout humankind, laws 
in their present form wouldn't be needed.  But the fact that you use the 
premise of Respect as the boundary is a start towards developing a set of 
rules or laws govenring behavior. 

A law is a law is a law.

Cycles...I am reading a book called "The Physics of Immortality".  It 
talks about cyclicism and why it is aberrant, but that is just one view 
of cycles I guess.  I do not necessarily beleive that there is a state of 
equilibrium.  Soemtimes the good guy doesn't win, sometimes there is no 
payback, and maybe you ain't coming back as someone else.  I dunno...just 
a thought.

Not to be antagonistic, but it would be interesting to see if I drop you 
in the middle of Hunter's Point, parts of the mission, deep parts of the 
South, or a crime ridden area, if you would still like to try this thesis.

When the circumstances are right, I agree, this is the ideal.  The second 
you have a disparaging element in the mix, the formula will have to 
change...for your own survival.

I think laws are a reflection of the fear we have of ourselves.  And 
humans, history has shown, are a species to be feared.  Thus laws.

I do not beleive in the milk of human kindness.  I think it exists, and 
people exhibit such behaviors, but I also realize there is greed and 
avarice too.  For me, I want the good, and I want to be protected from 
the bad.  Laws, can be good things, when written properly (whatever that is).

That highway is a nuisance, and very dangerous, people take it because 
there is no other way, because their employers don't let them work at 
home, because of greed, need, and other things.  There are solutions, and 
the closing of that stretch is one.  Thisd is a subject of ongoing 
debate.  Suffice it to say there are other means.  The question is, do we 
have the will to  pursue those avenues.

There is a good case to make in that regard.  It all depends upon your 
POV, as you ssaid earlier.

The domino effect.  Nope, when you make one law, you dop not necessarily 
have to have others.  And lines hafve to be drawn.  As much as you talk 
about respect and things of that nature, I still may not wish to have you 
walking across my lawn.  I want to have the freedom to say no or yes to 
whom I wish.

I see laws as laws, not necessarily good or bad.  Some are needed, others 
are moot.  They are a reflection of who we are as a species.  And until 
we grow up, which we are far from doing IMO, we will need to be protected 
from each other.  Sad to say, but it is true.

Vice versa for the good/bad.  Like I said, BM was all good, I know.  Now 
what about the people who got hurt or died.  You cannot know the sweet 
without the bitter.  Nor the light without the darkness.

John, excellent points, and I did take them to heart.  Our approaches may 
differ, and we may see thigns through different lenses.  But I think we 
both would want the same thing in the end.  respect for each other being 
tantamount.

Something the driver of that car lacked.

Peace out,
John

Greetings:

I just wanted to take this moment to point out that, despite the very
emotionally charged subject of life and death, the discussion seems to be
respectful, clearheaded, and free of spite or bitterness towards each other.

I like it.

	i would not worry too much about the first death at bman96,
	the motorcycle.  it was a drunken, headlightless game of
	chicken waaaay out on the playa.  all the people involved
	made choices about what they were doing (in this one accident)
	and many people are now calling it a suicide.

	riding real fast on a moto at a van, wearing no protective
	gear, drunk, in the dark, with no headlights sounds like
	suicide to me.

	as far as i know, the incident at gateways is the first real
	super-tragic event to happen at this yearly gathering...

Sounds like stupidity to me, which is the cause of many "accidents."
Remember, folks: accidents don't happen; they are caused.

Love life: treat it well, and maybe it'll treat you well.

Don't know too much of the details, but wasn't there another death last
year involving some accidental shootings?

One of the performers got drunk in Gerlach, and although his friends tried
to give him a ride, he insisted on driving back to camp himself on his
motorcycle.  He was drunk and driving on the Playa at night with no head
lights.  He ran head on into a slow moving truck and died instantly. :(

Moms get kind of funny when it comes to Satan. I remember once my mom
found a copy of the Satanic Bible in my guitar case when I was in high
school (I don't know what she was doing there). I wasn't interested in
Satanism; I was actually reading it just for laughs.

Anyway, she had a total shitfit and couldn't look at me in the eye for
days. The funny thing is that she isn't religious either.

Something about Mom and Satan. Never could figure it out.

Hey Everbody,

I'm really sad I didn't get to BM this year...  If anybody has some pics
up on the web, I'd love to have the URL.  Some people from Mountain Raves
went and burned big pieces of toast... =)

I hope everyone is doing well... I'm missing San Fran already..

Can you say "Chai Love High baby!"  The Chai hut rocked.  I loved it.  Best
vibe in the whole camp as far as I was concerned.  Spent most of my time
there and at the hot springs.  Had the pleasure of spinning for about six
hours at the Chai hut thursday Friday night.  Had a blast.

This was my third and by far best BM.  Last year I fell into the "it was
better last year" attitude and didn't have that much fun.  This year I got
more involved.  I decorated my camp with about 30 twenty foot lengths of
bamboo.  I made a small forest.  It was quite nice IMO, plus they made great
javolens(sp) to through at the fire on the night of the burn.  They were
also great beakons that helped us find each other on the night of the burn
in the huge crowd. "BAMBOO FAMILY!!!!!!" 

Spent very little time at Rave camp.  The time I did spend was spent at
Gateway.  They were the coolest!  Had a chance to spin some ambient there,
but never got a chance to make it back out to take them up on it.  Would
have been the biggest system I had ever spun on if I had.  Missed out.

Lets just say I had the time of my life....again.

Love and light to all those injured out there.

My prayers will be with you.

Here's to freedom!

Rick

Hello everyone,

    First, thank you to eveyone who has been sending their love and 
best wishes to my friends and I. 

    The following statement is as much info as I could gather from the 
police, friends, and hospital. Some might be speculation, some not...

    They people that were injured in the tent accident, were our 
friends Omar and Erin. I saw both of them when I went to the hospital. 
Erin had a bad injury to her ear, but through surgery the doctors were 
able to put everything back to normal. She was discharged from the 
hospital either last night or today. She had no other injuries from 
what I was told. I spoke with her mother and she stated that everything 
was fine and that she was doing great! (thank god)

    Omar on the other hand didn't have the same luck. Rumor has it, 
(from what I hear) that Omar is dead. Wrong!!!!! He is very much 
alive!!! At BM he got hit with the full force of the car. We are not 
sure wether his head was actually run over with a wheel, or if he just 
got hit really hard by the car. But the worst injury that Omar has is 
his head. He also sustained some broken ribs, a shattered jaw, and 
verious other little injuries.

    Last night we talked to one of the doctors that was performing 
surgery on Omar. He told us that they successfully reconstructed Omar's 
jaw, and performed some other surgeries. This is a good sign, cause 
that means that Omar was stable enough to go through the surgery 
process. 

    However Omar still is in Reno, in the hospital, in a coma, awaiting 
his head to heal. There was major brusing to the brain, which could 
mean a lot of things. We don't know if Omar will come back the same as 
when he left us. We don't know what time will tell. We all just really 
hope that he recovers as much as he can, in a timely manner. 

    I really can't begin to explain the amount of pain this horrible 
accident has caused. I just want to be able to wake up and have this 
all be a dream. When I got the call a couple of days ago, I thought I 
was dreaming. I thought this would all go away. But it hasn't gone 
away, and it won't. How could this happen to the Omar that made us all 
laugh, smile, & dance. He always brings life into every room. He is and 
always will be a fucking great person. I just wish this didn't happen. 
I Just wish there was something more that we could do to prevent these 
things from happening. Hmmm...

    Well on a happier note, my very nice roomate Matt, has saved the 
day! While I was in a rush to get up to Reno to see Omar and Erin, I 
blurted out, "Oh yeah, and get a space for friday's Beautiful People 
party!" as I ran out the door. And by the time I got back, he had one! 
So, to the best of our (harmony's) abilities, there WILL be a Beautiful 
People party this friday, September the 6th.

    The price is still they same $15, or ten if you come with your 3 
year anniversary ticket in your hand. Also, we are going to be taking 
donations to help Omar's mother with some of her bills. The hospital 
bills are completely outragous, so I think that amount we can come up 
with, will be of help. (Even if it doesn't go towards the hospital 
bills, maybe it could go towards his mother's airline tickets. She 
lives in San Jose, Omar is stuck in Reno and the doctors won't transfer 
him for at least six months - a year. She is going to be taking off 
work and putting her life on hold, so she can fly up there all the 
time, which can get pretty expensive). So if you can, bring some extra 
money for our friend. It would make him happy, to have his mother by 
his side.

    Also, the Harmony crew has decided that since Omar was (and still 
is) an original member of the Harmony crew, that ALL profits (if any) 
from the 3 year anniversary will go directly to Omar & his family. If 
you would like to make any sort of donation towards this cause you can 
mail it to:
                Omar C/O Harmony Productions
                Po Box 111084
                Campbell, CA 95011-1084

    They really need some financial help, so please anything you can do 
would be greatly apprieciated. If you can't send $, send your love and 
I am sure that they will feel it too!!

Peace, love, and harmony... 4 Omar,

Greg :)

this is just a quick note to thank all of those who helped make burning 
man so special. i met so many wonderful people there, who all seemed to 
to have one thing common on their varied ajendas: to escape traditional 
confining social methods and conditioning, and to be reallly cool, nice, 
and supportive of one another. this is really special to me. 
i have gone 3 years in a row now, and each time i come back just rapt 
(enraptured) from it all. i feel i open myself up so much to the goings 
on in the universe/my universe, and that it is such a great place to 
relax and enjoy while really learning alot about myself and others too.
i come back just buoyed with the positive energy i absorbed and help 
create there.
such an event takes so much planning, and must be filled with so many 
hurdles, that to overcome all of them in a creative way only illustrates 
the enormous amount of good intentions on behalf of the organizers, and 
their desire to help others share this love.
i am truly thankful, and hope i can encourage all to participate next 
year(lets all try to manifest that one...) -- it is truly worth it, imho.
thank you all again, 
peace
kevin

Deserts were long thought to be indestructible ecosystems because they 
appeared dead.  However, ecologists now know this is not true.  Deserts 
are actually very fragile.  I know that the Mojave desert has about 1/2-1"
of topsoil and if that is disturbed (like by cars ), opportunistic 
weeds invade and crowd out other life, thereby destroying the original 
ecosystem.  Destroying the topsoil also allows for erosion to occur.  
This is what the Desert Protection Act that Diane Feinstein pushed 
through is about.  I don't know anything about the ecology of the Black Rock 
desert, but it may be a similar situation.

Hi,

Burning Man was good and bad this year. A lot of it's already been talked
about so I won't re-hash what was and wasn't. But I have a little bit of
editorial to offer that's from a different angle.

I spent only one night -- Friday night -- out at CCC. It was an amazing
evening in the desert. But CCC doesn't throw raves. They are way evolved
beyond raving, and their lifestyle and ceremonies reflect that. Other than
that, I didn't want my Burning Man experience overshadowed by what I
already end up doing in a warehouse once a week on average.

I tried to get into the rave thing out there, but compared to the
*incredible* diversity of what was happening in the Main Camp, it just
seemed like it didn't fit. So I drove back and forth more than a dozen
times, but I never found anything happening out there that was captivating
enough to stay 2.6 miles from the action.

But when you are not in one place, you are someplace else. So while I
wasn't raving, I was ingesting in the magic that is Burning Man, so it
worked out well for me.

I just feel badly for all those that drove all the way to the Black Rock
Desert to "go to some raves" and didn't spend one minute in the Main Camp
finding out what the Burning Man is all about.

Also, after seeing the rave-camp related tragedies at this year's burning
man, I would have to recommend that the rave camp as a separate, unmanaged
entity not be allowed to occur on such a scale next year (if BM happens at
all next year anyway). The statistics prove it -- that the death/near-death
occurrences out in Rave Camp and the sheer number of overdoses were higher
per-capita in the rave camp than in the main community.

Last year's single large sound system seemed to be all the rave we needed.

It's too bad, too. The rest of Burning Man was stellar. And the main camp
included enough smaller, in-camp sound systems that created "just enough"
rave environment to complement the other events and sites to see and things
to do in main camp. In fact, we even FM simulcasted our sound system on
102.3 this year, and we gave time to anybody that wanted to play, including
Forrest/Ozy, Burger King, Tom, KT, WBL, and myself. It was fun. It was
community. We were not superstar DJ's, we didn't bring a giant sound
system. We created more of a camping/campfire sized sound and vibe.

There is a lot of misinformation going on right now, many don't know
what they are talking about. Officially and to my knowledge there was one
fatality which ocured tuesday night, wednesday morning.  I was a Ranger
at this years burning man mostly around the rave camp, yes there was
an accident monday morning around 6:30 am involving an automobile with
three people injured, one from burns, two with head injuries. There is more
but I want to wait till I can reach Claire (the other Ranger) and maybe we
both can post an update as to what actually happened.

Diane Feinstein is the antichrist. Her and the Sierra Club are elitists who
would rather let you view nature (the desert in this case) from pictures
they've taken from their limos on the way to their next re-election
fundraiser/eco-wackery campaign.

Don't get me wrong. I love nature. But I want to see it with my eyes, not
theirs.

Short of clear-cutting, nature is fairly indestructable, and it is nothing
short of egotistical to think that, in the case of the desert, a small
number of people driving their cars over it will ruin it forever.

And in the case of the Playa, *nothing* lives there. *nothing*.

enough drum circles.... how about a DRUM MACHINE CIRCLE??

We'll need a big mixing board (16, 32, or 48 channels of stereo), lots
of cable, amps, speakers and a big generator...

Now is that a stooopid idea, or what?

well, then there were a whole lot of six- and eight-legged little 
*nothing*s swarming and flying around our camp lights at night. and i 
came across several carcasses of little furry, long-tailed *nothing*s 
during trash detail on monday.

anyone have any anti-itch medication for *nothing* bites?

jmar! glad to be alive... memento mori.

Something like what happened to John Draper happened to me too. I
camped in the main camp, in a tent w/ my girlfriend behind irrational
geographic. On friday afternoon, I rode over to the rave camps to check
out the setups and soundsystems and because I love riding fast on the
playa. On my way back, a truck full of ravescent-looking youngins
passed me in a mini-pickup truck going really fast, with about 2 feet
of clearance, yelling "100 points for the biker" as they screamed past
me... they left me in a huge cloud of dust which I could barely see my
way out of (esp with the headwind). 

Fortunately, that was the only really scary thing that happened to me
all weekend... for the most part, I had a very good time. I did grow
annoyed at the boozers that were driving around the main camp on
motorcycles/tricicles/quadricicles/trucks tossing aluminum beer cans
(and even glass beer bottles) on the ground as they took advantage of
unpoliced drinking and driving... Especially guilty was a certain
blonde bimbo that threw a beer can on the road in such a way that I ran
it over and nearly flipped when it got stuck on my tire and hit the
forks of my bicycle. Next year, I'm bringing a camera and putting up a
"stupid cunts and assholes of burning man" web site.

IMHO, This would have been a much better event if it was alchohol free,
or at least drinking-and-driving free. Seemed like too many people
thought this was some oversized "rager" college frat party where they
could get shitfaced and then drive around drunk w/o fear of getting a
DUI.

Perhaps John S. Lee is right, perhaps BM is getting too big and
chaotic. Last year seemed much more intimate, and there weren't as many
people vying for the darwin awards, creating evolution in action, and
seeking inebriated gene-pool removal techniques for themselves and
others. The worst thing is that these kinds of people rarely succeed in
removing themselves from the gene pool, which would be a great service
to mankind. They usually take out innocent victims and cruise through
life on dumb luck and a prayer...

Precedence: bulk

Imagine, if you will, that the world has ended with an explosion that
leveled everything, left no plant life, just a flat endless cracking dusty
desert that stretches for miles in every direction.  The people who have
survived wander in small groups, carrying their homes with them, nomads,
independent and self-sufficient.  But for a few days, all the small tribes
come together in the desert, making a temporary encampment.  It's a
post-apocolyptic circus, and all are invited.

I have never seen anything like this, it is overwhelming.

After 200 miles of freeway and 100 miles of a country road, we turn onto
the playa Thursday afternoon. I watch the odometer count up to 10 miles so
we could make a 90 degree right-turn to find our camp .... and we spot our
friends' geodesic dome right away in the vastness of the flat desert.  We
set up our tents and shade, and begin to adjust to the environment.

Tony R rides up on his bike with a new mohawk haircut, a scarf tied around
his waist, and little else.  Vince and his crew have set up their beacon
and windmills and established their neighborhood.

As more cars, trucks, vans and rvs arrive, the energy grows, but it never
gets crowded because the camp simply grows outward and the space seems
endless.  People are creating palaces for camps, huge structures with pvc
pipe frameworks from which are hanging curtains to create the definition
and shade of walls, protection from the blazing sun.  Inside many are
couches, rugs, flowerpots.  At night, there are twinkling lights, tiki
torches, tall beacons so we can find our way home.

Radio Free Burning Man plays dada-istic musical and spoken word pieces,
interspersed with djs who interview performers who are inviting the
community to their events (mail order bride anyone?) and remind people to
drive carefully and drink lots of water.

Across the way, Bianca's Smut Shack is playing the most amazing music ...
ambient, trip-hop, whatever ... it is always there and it's always perfect.
Thank you all from the bottom of my heart for being my neighbor.

Lounging in our camp, I stop being surprised at anything.

I see a parasail flying overhead, piloted by a man with a huge fan strapped
onto his butt, steering himself over the camp like a huge human kite.

A man rides by on a moped that has been converted into a 10-foot long
stuffed rat.  He is followed by 5 people, 2 of whom are naked, who are
riding on a brown overstuffed motorized sofa that buzzes by at 15 miles an
hour, then stops to spin around and around until they're all dizzy.

A white plane does tricks in the sky overhead. People are bounding high on
a trampoline nearby that's ringed with white twinkling lights.  A
procession of shark cars goes by.

Sounds are everywhere.  TV soundtracks are coming from tents as you pass
by, entire bands are playing on the back of trucks that are cruising
through the camp, there are sirens, whistles, bells.

Flares go off constantly in the night, as if they have a mind of their own,
and just decide to send up their glowing red light in the the starry sky
without even a human being to light them.  Huge fireworks follow in every
direction.

Friday night, I hear a sound and look up to see a helicoptor approaching,
and 100 yards ahead there are flares set in a circle to guide it to a clear
landing site.  It approaches slowly, scanning its searchlights to see where
it's going, and it gently, gently hovers and gets lower and lower and
louder and louder until the moment when the air from its rotors hits the
dust on the ground and BOOOM like a mushroom cloud, the dust rolls out
until you can't see anything but its lights.  I'm screaming "Holy shit!
Holy shit!" because I am totally overwhelmed.  Then my friend Sara comes
out of the porta-pottie, and I ask her if she saw it, and she says "saw
what?" having missed the whole event.

They load their passenger, and 10 minutes later, we watch it lift off to
carry her to a safe place, and as it rises from the ground again and
disappears to the southwest, you know you've watched a miracle.

The chai tent is a haven of ambient music in a huge chill space with
carpets, couches, flowers in vases, your friends old and new to talk with.

Saturday night, they burn the Helco setup, a false-front city of shops like
Caca Bell and Starfucks Coffee and high-rises, and I realize that I need to
stay away from the energy of large crowds who are hungry for destruction by
fire, so I plan to stay far from the Sunday night burn.

Rave camp is far, far away, an anxious 2-1/2 mile drive across the playa,
hoping that we'll see any people walking or on bikes with plenty of time to
avoid them.  On almost every trip, we pick people up and give them a ride.

Halfway to rave camp is a fairy tale camp setup, with a huge yard with
picket fence, and oversized flowers and mushrooms made of wood and painted
bright crazy colors.  They even have a huge mailbox.  We tell the woman
hanging out in the camp how great we think it is, and she says "then maybe
you'd like to come Monday morning and help us take it down" ... maybe she
was just tired, and maybe she was stressed from being in a camp so far from
other company, or maybe it just isn't as fun being in a fairy tale camp for
days on end.

The rave camp has three separate sound systems.  Gateway is magical,
especially when the "bug" guy, who is dressed in a big costume and mask
covered with glow sticks that make him look like an insect-relative of
Winnie-the-Pooh from outer space, climbs up on the scaffolding behind the
billowing white gauze curtains, and dances.

Wicked has an amazing visual setup, a tall pyramid structure covered with
white cloth and light shows on it ... and huge green lasers shooting out
into the desert that you can see for miles because of the dust.  Garth's
set Saturday was the funkiest I've heard from him (or anyone) in months.

The dust is like part of our world ... we created our own civilization, and
the dust is the atmosphere that defined the boundaries for us.  It takes me
3 days to get it together to buy a face mask to protect my lungs.

Walking between the CCC camp (how wonderful to have big carpets to chill on
there) and Gateway, there is a crazy car who's turned his lights off and is
driving fast, fast, fast in the playa, slamming on his brakes and spinning
out.  I was really afraid, feeling like an animal who is being hunted,
defenseless, wondering if my flashlight works as a warning or a magnet to
crazy drivers like that.  My anxiety about safety on the playa, where cars,
trucks and pedestrians are all wandering, is sharpened.

On Sunday, you can feel the energy of people getting ready for the big
event.  Our camp sets up its sound system again, and we're blessed with
Tim, BioJeff and Phil spinning for us.  We sit on lawn chairs in the shade,
chatting and spraying ourselves with misters.  I get to dance in the
blazing sun under my chinese parasol, eating icy watermelon that Ann
brought.

My friends Sara and Mike are keeping everyone happy and entertained as they
wander around naked and beautiful, getting browner in the sun, stopping
every few steps to kiss and talk and be in love.

I luck out and a friend has brought her massage table, and she massages the
kinks out of my back.  Then a man in her camp paints my face like a bird
mask to go with my headpiece that I made from twigs and feathers.  I go
back to my own camp and put on my evening costume.

We have an inside tip to visit the Tiki Hut Man, who has set his tiki bar
up on a piece of astroturf with tiki torches, and is serving icy margaritas
and rum drinks with smoked gouda and almonds.  Perfect.  I think next year,
I'm bringing popsicles and I'm going to ride around on a bike and be the
popsicle woman.

While I was gone, Mike has painted Sara with psychedelic body paint, like
the banners that he paints for raves, then he paints his face and Phil's.
She'll wear her grass skirt and the headpiece we made her from vines and
flowers.

Sara wants to play Twister, so I get to be the spinner, lounging, smoking
and calling out instructions for Sara, Mike, Tom and Phil, all naked, and
laughing hysterically.  Can't wait for the pictures from this one... naked
twister is a dream come true for Sara.. and perhaps some of our spectators
; )

Sunday night, my friends light their beautiful installation of doors on
fire, and it burns so big and hot and smoky, and I watch with a sadness
that it will be gone, because it's been a marker for me as I find my way
home, and I've loved seeing people discover it and go inside and leave
offerings in it.

Later, when the pageantry and procession begins, I stay in my camp, as
people leave one by one, and finally I am there alone.  It is dark, no
lamps lit, desolate, and dogs who have been safely left in cars, vans,
tents, are howling.  A small plane is circling overhead and fireworks and
flares are shooting up from every direction.  I can see flaming torches in
the distance as thousands of people begin their trip down to the man.

Once the main center of camp is empty, I walk over there, and am grateful
for the Chai tent dj who continues to spin beautiful music, even though
there are only a couple of sleeping souls in the tent.  I dance out in
front of the tent, watching the man go up in flames in the distance.

Then people begin coming back from the burn, and within minutes the
activity picks up again throughout the camp, and a dj is spinning techno,
and people who've perhaps never heard of raving before are dancing to it.
Back at camp, several of us gather around a paper bag with three candles in
it, as if it were a campfire, and laugh until our sides and mouths are
aching.

Rave camp that night is more crowded, so dusty, another world.  No crazy
tent setups there, no weird invented vehicles cruising by, no odd
soundtracks coming from art installations as you wander around. It's hard
to believe there are people there who have never even ventured into main
camp. We see the CCC alien man burn at 4:20 a.m, and later I get a ride
home as the sun comes up, and sleep until it's too hot to sleep any more.

Showering on Monday morning (bless the people who created showers for us!),
we see a black sedan coming in from the playa, totalled, clearly having
rolled over, since the windshield is a shattered web, and both sides are
crushed in, and every wheel is facing a different direction ... but there
is metal music blaring from it, and two guys riding on top laughing and
screaming, and the girl driving has a huge smile on her face.  How will
they ever get home?

Packing up and driving back is a gradual immersion into everyday reality.
I'm exhausted, and have a lot to think about and process.

Burning Man is about leaving one reality, and creating another.  It is the
only time I have ever been somewhere where everyone has made a true and
conscious contribution to what is happening.  There are no specatators
here, everyone is part of the show. Every person brought their creativity
to the playa.

For some, simply putting out the effort to get there with a tent and
supplies is their expression of creativity, and it is welcome.  For others,
they pushed to the limit, brought along huge art pieces, built
installations like Mudhenge and windmills that blow bubbles (oh, we were so
lucky that Vince's bubbles drifted right over our camp).  They created
amazing vehicles like reclining bikes that looked like bananas and bikes
with neon lights with costumes to match, to ride in the night.  They built
pyramids that repel aliens and brought formal clothing and amazing
costumes.  They traveled on stilts, roller skates, surfboards with sails
that cruise across the desert.

There are positives and negatives to an experience like Burning Man.  On
the positive side, there is much to learn from being somewhere with few
rules and no boundaries.  On the negative side, there is much to learn from
being somewhere with few rules and no boundaries.

We lost one member of the community in a motorcycle accident ... and we
have others who are seriously hurt.  Certainly, out of this many people
over a holiday weekend, we would have had casualties in any environment.
But this is a special place, where we try to create our own world, a world
that is better for its free thinking and openness, that seemed to carry an
optimism that we'd be able to avoid these kinds of tragedies.

Perhaps more rules, more structure, would avoid the problems, or perhaps it
would create more problems.  Maybe many people in our world today have been
so crippled by having rules imposed on them that they no longer are able to
regulate themselves.  How can we make it a safer experience and still keep
the free and primal nature of the gathering?  Creating a "police" function
wouldn't seem the answer ... perhaps taking away some of the danger by
creating a "road" system with flashing lights to make it easy to follow in
the dark and the dust ... and creating a shuttle that will transport people
so they can leave their cars in their camp?

I'll be there next time, and I hope that there is a next time.  An event
like this has clearly grown exponentially and something must change to
accommodate that growth.  I feel regret that I wasn't part of it in the
years past, because I'm sure it was different, smaller, purer somehow. But
like a child who grows into an adult, time changes everything.

Next year?  More shade, less food, bigger tent, more water, less beer.  And
popsicles.

Love, Leslie

That is a fucking awesome idea!!! I brought my drum machine, but didn't
get much use out of it. Next year?

Hello!

        Yes, I'm selling my lighting rig.  Mostly for financial reasons,
and also to give someone else a chance to see how fun intelligent lighting
can be.

5 Martin Roboscan 1004 intelligent fixtures
        250 watt ELC bulb (around $11.00 new)
        4 colors (plus white)
        4 Gobos <shapes> (plus open)
        Variable speed strobe
        180 degree pan
        90 degree tilt
        27 LBS.

1 Martin 2032 Controller
        Unlimited scenes, sequences, and shows (saves to disk)
        Full control of all martin products
        Can control up to 32 independent fixtures

Asking price: $3500.00

This lighting rig is full of good vibes, but is getting old.  This system
has been reliable for the past 4 years, every fixture was routinely cleaned
and maintained.  Though the mirrors and fans are showing signs of wear and
could be replaced (estimated cost: $120.00).

The controller motherboard has recently been upgraded to a 386, 66MHz, 4MB
RAM (from: 286, 20 MHz, 1MB RAM, yuck!), but is experiencing occasional
trackball problems.  (Proprietary part, available through martin dealers:
$120.00).  It is a crazy 4 space rack mount piece (including green screen)
that can run DOS.

You have seen this rig recently at:

        Burning man 1996 (gateway systems' circle, bottom row)
        Friends + Family (July 27, 1996)

and a while back at:

        Friends + Family Halloween 1995
        Chrysalis in Oakland
        Harmony at the acme
        Nomad interactive at pier 66 New years eve

This system rents for $350.00 a night (with a fog machine).  And looks
great by itself, or in combination with other fixtures, and is a great
starting point to build a as large a lighting rig as you like.

For more specific information contact me directly.

::hugs::

I had a most insane and fun time at burning man...everyone has already
told so many stories that I wont go into that...if you were wondering, my
new housemate let us borrow her car late friday night so that we could go
to BM, we were planning on hitchiking but she really saved the day! Thank
you megan!!! 
everything below here is IMHO and not meant to offend etc...read on!

	I really hope to see burning man come back next year, but I
think that there are some very serious things to consider before getting
too excited about next year. I see my sentiments here on the list as well,
first, the theme 'season in hell' was funny and exciting before I got
there, but upon arriving in the playa...I realized, this place could
really be a literal
hell on earth for some people, what I mean is that the playa has a very
HIGH LEVEL of potential DANGER and this should not be taken lightly, as
the theme of the event sort of makes it out to be.
Although there were plenty of
warnings if you followed the "official" avenues of participating in the
event, you probably knew what to expect. But we all know this is not the
case for PLENTY of people who went Now you may say that well, that is
their own fault they should follow the rules...(I wont even go into the
irony of that one)...but we are talking about our brothers and sisters
and our own lives here.
	The second important issue is all of the hype for the event this
year. This has to do with 'undesireables' showing up at the event. By that
I mean irresponsible people that will not respect the playa, or the people
around them. My first thought on this was that just having such a bug
commitment to drive into the desert, to  be prepared to take care of
yourself and not depend on anyone else, woulud keep alot of irresponsible
people away. Which I think worked for the most part. I belive that this
year was at a critical threshold, so much of the hype almost made it into
some sort of spectacle thing that would draw the drunk frat party type to
come and 'check it out dude'
	And lastly(or this is all I have really thought of as yet!) I
think that the driving around in the dust is VERY SCARY and very
dangerous...on my way out from the playa there weree people driving both
directions with visibility so low that I was thankful to make that drive
without being injured. I am so surprised by the few amounts of driving
accidents that
happened out there. I think that this is the NUMBER ONE thing that can be
improved to make the playa a much more human friendly environment.
	My suggetions for how to do this. (btw If it happens I will
definately be much more involved next year and I am willing to see these
things through)
	1.getting from the entrance to the mainn camp is a big
problem...what to do...The best thing that I thought of was to have a big
laser beam from the entrance pointing straight to the man. you always
drive on the right of the laser. It is perfect for dusty environments.
	2. having 2 camps so far away from eachother is just a bad idea
not only logistically but even spiritually. keeping all the people in one
place safe by the light and surrounding tents cars and drivers going from
place to place is just a good idea. 

	I would definately appreciate feedback on these ideas and any
discussion on ways to make this safe for all of us to do what we want on
the playa. I love you guys!

Really? I saw a bit of indigenous life out there: mostly small crawling
insects, the occasional larger insect, and even a dormouse near the
edge of the playa late one night. It's not much, but it is more than
"nothing".

I agree that Diane Feinstein is bad (you're doing her too much justice
calling her the antichrist, esp. after coming back from "a year in hell").
My main disagreement w/ D.F. is her "we must censor the internet because
it can be used to teach people how to build bombs". Not her eco-stances.

There are a lot of people that view nature as "theirs", that people as
"stewards of the earth" can do what they will with the land. So they
erode the soil, kill plants, scare wildlife, pollute, and generally
make a mess out of something that belongs to everybody.

"Desert" describes a wide range of landscapes. Not all desert is like
Black Rock.

For example in southern california, many semi-arid areas (aka Deserts)
have been permanently eroded/destroyed because off-road vehicles
(motorcycles, 4-WD, etc) have chewed up the protective vegetation
(chapparal, scrub brush, dried grasses) and allowed rain to erode away
the top-soil. Now you get flooding and mudslides every time a big rain
storm hits. THen again, nobody gives a fuck about ecology in southern
california, all they do is build build build on arid land that cannot
support all those people and all that water usage. It's absolutely
sickening what has happened to our beatiful natural coastal ranges
betweeen san-diego and long beach.

> And in the case of the Playa, *nothing* lives there. *nothing*.

That's not true. Kim and I drove to the edges of the playa and found
that plenty lives there as there are lots of natural springs that turn
the completely arid playa into a place that supports some hardy
vegetation and desert animals (squirrels, rabbits, lizards, snakes,
etc). I also saw a few moths in our tent, a few butterflies flittering
about, and some birds. I also got a big chunk-o-flesh bitten out of my
leg by a weird horsefly (insects love drinking my blood, cuz I'm such a
sweet guy) just after the man burned. There is definitely life out on
the playa after Burning Man is just a long-lost memory.

In terms of erosion, yes driving on the playa does erode. Take a look
at all those dust clouds stirred up by driving. However, I would think
that driving vehicles on the playa is a lot less ecologically
destructive than driving a dirt bike on top of partially vegetated
semi-arid hillsides of california. That is (IMHO) the kind of area that
Diane Feinstein is showing concern for.

Sure.  It would be nice to use the 707 for something worthwhile.
One question though; who gets to be the master clock?  We will

Dear SFRaves Family,

I know Omar only from partying - one of those faces you keep seeing at 
parties.  He is part of the Harmony crew, working to throw parties for 
all of us. He ALWAYS had a smile and a beautiful vibe each time I saw him :).

Now he lies in a hospital bed, where he may remain for a year.  I think 
all of us realize how precious life is and how it can be shattered in an 
instant, and how our daily problems pale in comparison to this.  Let's 
all take a moment to think of someone else, and send whatever we can to 
the fund for Omar that Greg has set up.  Money, cards, well-wishes, 
flowers, and lots of love will all go a long way to helping Omar, and 
especially his mother, in this time of anguish.  Think of what it will 
mean to her to see what kind of friends her son has, and what kind of 
community he helped build!

The address again:

Omar
c/o Harmony Productions
P.O. Box 111084
Campbell, CA 95011-1084

Remember, we're a family.  Let's band together right now to help a brother!!

Love to you all, 
Nancy

Subject: nrr: matt's random location of the day
Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

hello all-

as per normal, i've found myself in a random location, this time it's the
pleasant hill bart station waiting for shawna to pick me up (not as wierd as
stumbling blindly into the greek festival sunday, but certainly entertaining!).

so, just wanted to say hello, and to let you know the following things:

1)someone just decided that life was so worthless that he/she decided to end
his/her life by jumping in front of my bart train.  in view of many recent
events, let us all realize just how cool it is that we're alive, and if we
find another who isn't sure that life is so cool, don't let that person sink
to the level of extenguishing their life.  i've been there, and it sucks,
and if it weren't for my dad, i would have been that guy.(i'm not starting a
flame war here about the right to extenguish your own life, so stay off my
back).
life's too short to end it on your own, someone else will probably do it for
you.

2)the sunset is really cool here in pleasant hill.  it's at that stage where
if you're driving, it's just below the visor and right in your eyes.  but
while i'm not driving, it's beautiful, and pretty damn near perfect.  pardon
me while i stop and bask in the sun for a few moments.

3)life finally clicked for me this summer.  fun job, good/new friends,
killer parties, finally getting along with the mom and brothers, and a sense
of freedom and joy i've never had before.  so if anyone needs a little extra
joy, give me a call cause somehow i ended up with a surplus!

i think that concludes matt's utterly non rave related ranting: thanks for
listening and being yourselves.

lots of love-

matt

I feel sad for having missed it... didn't want to go until it was TOO LATE.
Really concerned about the injuries; positive energy to erin and omar and
all who didn't have the experience they expected (good luck with your
parents tim!).

smiles,
see you all at BP and H3!

Before I start, my love and energy goes to those injured...
My experience was kind of what John Darrow had talked about:  I was 
waiting to feel what I felt at last year's festival.  I still had lots of 
fun, but it was a "been there, done that" type of feeling. 

I think there were WAY too many people this year, and I think Burning Man 
96 will be my final one.  With more people come more idiots, and there 
were obviously many. 

So I camped at Syntonic, which was 50 or so yards from vwcamp.  Vince and 
Wayne constructed a tower of two bright blue lights with smaller flashy 
ones below the blue ones.  It made finding camp very easy.  They also put 
up a solar powered bubble making tower. Tres cool.  There was music all 
afternoon, courtesy of BioJeff's spinning and Jason Lundy's sound system. 
Thanks guys!  I loved how the ravers of main camp were very unified and 
had camped together, creating a tent and RV city.  I saw many lonely 
camps only one or two tents - and this was in main camp!  I love the 
togetherness of our family.  The Chai Tea room was very *VERY* nice.  I 
love how ravers have really contributed to the Burning Man experience.  
There was lovely Intelligent Drum & Bass being played as I sipped my 
exotic drink.  I think the rave community has finally been accepted and 
embraced  by the other Burning Man goers - I actally heard beats from the 
main stage, which never happened last year! 

Friday night was spent at rave camp and I checked out Gateway and 
Wicked.  Wicked was sounding too clubby at first, so we hung out at 
Gateway for awhile.  BioJeff got to play, and he got the crowd going 
off!  Later that night, we ventured back to Wicked, and the music really 
improved alot.  

Saturday night I spent it all at CCC.  Damn, they're great!  At 11 pm 
they had an hour long ceremony/dance.  IT was very pagan and primitave 
and gypsy-like.  there were people on stilts, walking around like it was 
nothing, and twirling giant fire sticks. The dancing was gorgeous and the 
music was powerful digeridoos.  Then the full on goa trance all night.  I 
would LOVE to attend a CCC party!  There were still lots of people 
trancing out when we went back to camp at 7am.  I happened to love the 
CCC camp decorations.  I told someone that Wicked & Gateway were 
glamorous rave setups while CCC's looked like industrial wasteland.  Each 
camp looked exactly like the music and feeling it produced. 

I had a great time, but I think this will be my last.  I want to always 
have good memories, and not over try by going again next year (if there 
is one!)

love to all,
Amy

Dear Knucklehead,

Your mom needs a lesson in irony. The "Hell" motif at Burning Man was about
as legitimately "Satanic" as a high school marching band whose mascot is
the Red Devil. For that matter, does she boycott Underwood Deviled Ham for
using a tiny red devil as their logo? What about Li'l Devil snack cakes,
the
Dust Devil vacuum appliance, Red Devil toilet bowl cleaner, etc.? If it
helps at all, explain to her that hell-demon-devil iconography is
commonplace in our society and is of no religious significance.

I personally laughed my ass off at the "Helco" performance. This was a
satire of Corporate America and it ended with Helco and its subsidiary
companies being blown up. Is this Satan worship? No, it's the wicked fun of
seeing a mini-mall burned to the ground. Try to explain to your mom that
the hell motif was multi-layered; it added to our enjoyment of the daytime
heat and the "naughty" fun of watching things blown up at night. Tell her
that in our own fun little way we were "rebelling" against the
soul-negating Mass Society and the "hell" motif simply spiced it up. Tell
her that we were all adults out there and we have a convoluted sense of
humor that allows us to laugh at ourselves for eating charrerd, bloody "Mad
Cow" hamburgers from a restaurant called McSatan's in the middle of a
blistering desert.

Tell her all these things, and if she doesn't get it or won't listen, I
think she has a deeper issue than simply being concerned for your immortal
soul. I hope this works out!

        peace,
        pf

Ken:  I loved your setup!  There was some great music coming out of that 
van.  I got your catalogue.  Can you reccommend any Intelligent Drum & 
Bass Cds and/or tapes?  I heard such incredible ID&B at the Chai Hut and 
I would LOVE to have some music.

Most likely it was Tracy.  She's teriffic.  But I wasn't actually at 
Wicked Sunday night, so I am just making a guess.  

love,
Amy

well, this should provide added incentive to all you people who were
deliberating on whether or not to go to harmony 3 year, or BP on friday. if
nothing else, go to support omar and his family.

and if you know you are going to go, please buy your tickets soon. the
harmony crew puts all their money back into their parties, and as such don't
have a big fat bank account... so the advance ticket sales go towards paying
off some of the initial costs. even if $20 seems like a lot of money, please
make the effort to scrape together the cash. in light of the recent tragedy,
harmony needs all the support we can give them.

Rave camp this year didn't work out as well as a few of us had hoped. 
There were problems that could have been solved if the systems had worked 
together as a rave camp instead of systems on the playa. Even the 
collective I was a part of could have done better.

This year, we had separate tribes out on the playa, and when one tribe 
offered my tribe use of their genny (because the playa ate the one I 
brought and one of SPAZ's), we as a collective decided it should remain 
by the SPAZ encampment, which was outside the circle of the camp. 
Spreading rave camp out to individual camps was a mistake - it destroyed 
much of what makes a festival a festival because everything was so 
separated. Because there were separate encampments, any provisions we had 
made for driving in camp were thrown out the window. Last year, there was 
a camp and highway formed between the camp and the CCC(were they called 
CCC back then?)/Gateway/SPAZ/Rig-a-tony (well, while he left his gear 
there) system. There was a danger area, but it was known and it could be 
avoided. This year, there was a lot of empty space, and little 
cooperation or even communication between systems - in essence, there was 
little community.

I am basised here because I am part of SPAZ, the flakiest, most problem
plagued system I know of (but also one of the most on top of shit, got
their head sorted, good willed group of people I have come in contact
with) and am friends of some of the people who make up Gateway, but I
think Gateway did their best to work with people and SPAZ was open to just
about anything (as our presentation of music demonstrated a bit) - except
moving once more.... I didn't get that feeling from everyone and I ask
those involved (if they are around) to look at how you approached the
festival - did you all plan a rave camp or a camp with a bunch of systems?
Did you go check out anyone else's thing? Did you care? And because of
this, we ran into problems... 

To a concern degree I am a medic.

I think I am medic because when I was about 10 years old, I was buying a
birthday present for my mom when the security guard at Arthur's on Route
22 in new jersey keeled over and had a heart attack. It took 15 minutes 
for the cops to get there and another 30 for an ambulance to get there... 
This is on a major highway in a populated center.

Monday morning I was climbing into bed to curl up with someone when a
swoosh went past my big dome, maybe 10 feet from our heads. We saw a blue
car go by the tent door and behind a silver vw rabbit, then a thud and a
louder thud. My and my girlfriend looked at each other and asked each
other and asked if that really just happened. Then a scream. Out of the
door and found three people hurt, beyond what I can attempt to treat with
my beefed-up med-kit. Grab the radio from Claire to call into Earthbound,
the people who come out to burning man to provide free medical care for
those that get injured or injure themselves out of stupidity.  All weekend
long, not a single injury did I see, no rebar wounds, no one overly
dehydrated to a serious level, not until then... 

I found Black Rock Rangers on the playa who lost their wits and could have
injured people worse, I saw Black Rock Rangers who were cool as ice and 
made the medivac go smoothly, I saw Rangers in between the two extremes. 
I found some people to find me cold and calous as I asked them to take a 
piece of watermeleon and eat it if they could after the medivac left 
because otherwise, they might be leaving in a similiar way in the 
increasing hotter daytime sun. 

And from my experience I have this to say. Each and every one of us is
responsible for our actions. In every situation whether it be driving a
car, to trying to provide help to people who are hurt, to setting up a
rave, to dancing with your fellow people, YOU are responsible for how you
conduct yourself and only YOU can tell when you are out of league and can
no longer help a situation. It is each of our responsibility to make sure
we don't cross over the line of what we can handle, and so goes with that,
each of us most know where that line lies or at least error on the side of
cation when we don't know exactly where it lies. At the end of the day, 
shit happens, and I hope that there are going to be people out there that 
can handle it and try and make it better to a degree - I have tried to 
equip myself to be one of those people.

I believe to this day that things like burning man are needed. That giving
people the room to go out and take their freedom is necessary before we
all forget why laws are there and senseless campaigns continue because of
false propangda that no one will know why they are fighting against. I
also feel extremely strongly that bringing people out into the woods to
party where they have to make some effort to be a part of the party, where
they have to take some responsibility for themselves as part of the party,
helps to culture some of this awareness in people. I don't believe laws
can help this, because laws do not include why they were made, and people
forgot. If people forget why the law was brought about, it has no meaning
and why then with so many shit laws or out of date laws, should it be
observed?! While I cannot force this stuff into people, because there is
no way they could understand it if I did and more importantly, it is not
my responsibility or desire to force it into anyone but myself, I hope my
words will have meaning to some...

Might just be radio frequencies bleeding through.  The "Acutex Stereo

	People die every fucking day all around the city. How often does
anyone pay an old bum mind as they pass on the street? How did the bum get
there? Maybe it was no fault of their own and mostly likely they will die
through no fault of their own out on the street alone. oh well, poor
fucking bum. How often do you pay heed to kids who got HIV a while back
before it was know what it was; they will die of their bodies eating them
from the inside out; oh well, they had sex and made a choice, poor fucking
kids - hey honey, let's go make love tonight. How often... Burning Man is
not just a party. It is now filled with all of the same shit that life is 
filled with, except that people are trying to work together.

	I seriously hope the parents who would demand this to be 
regulated have taught their childern to make their own decisions. To 
weigh risks for themselves because this is the shit that is destroying 
us. We sit and DEMAND legislation to protect us. Well guess what, that 
isn't the government's job. YOU have to decide for yourself if it is too 
risky and make sure that those you bring into this world can make those 
same decisions. Whether it be if a hit of acid (or any drug) is approaite 
for you in those conditions or at all, or if moving to California is a 
good decision. How is making Burning Man illegal any better than 
illegalizing abortion or drugs?

	I have in a previous post, read it if you care to. I can also say 
that the guy driving the blue car I have seen at parties and I seem to 
remember talking to at one point. So you have what happened, the only 
person who can tell you much more is in police custody and probably will 
not be back in California for a while...

	No, the espacism comes from focusing on the hurt of Burning Man 
and failing to realize that the same shit is happening everyday all 
around you only way worse. People got hurt, people will get hurt. We live 
and we die. I hope I don't die too soon. I hjope even more that I do not 
get hurt in a way that when I come back, I am totally different. And even 
more I hope that people take the specific lesson from the situation that 
caused me to get into a predictament and not take too general a lesson, 
because then my pain is wasted on will some day no doubtedly be repeated 
over and over and over because no one can see why doing such and such can 
lead to that situation.

> Two people might not ever get a chance to talk about their experiences at
> BM.  Why not reflect on that, or is that all too real?

	Why not reflect on the same things going on in our cities today? 
Or is the fact the world is far overpopulated too real. That having a 
child, one of the supposed greatest pleasures we can have is causing 
harm? Why not reflect on the fact that in looking only at the outcome, we 
miss the lesson... Why not reflect on the fact that those two people 
might never get to talk about their experiences because someone get in a 
car and drove when either they were fucked up or too tired. How often do 
each of us do that? Why not reflect on that for a moment or is that 
getting to close to home? If not, then great. You do not have a lesson to 
learn, but if it is, then maybe this is an incentive to stop driving when 
too fucked up or too tired... Each of us knows when we are too fucked up 
(this includes tiredness) for the most part, why not change that?!

	I am tired of hearing that so many people together with this and 
that equals disaster. I have been to festivals in the UK and seen it 
work. So are we saying 15,000 Americans, booze, drugs and a choatic theme 
equals disataster?! Fine, then let's get off our asses and start changing 
Americans to be more responsible for themselves so we don't have to keep 
babysitting each new generation.

[ to sfraves list ]

 I think Niels' idea of a drum machine circle is too good to be kept
in the realm of "just kidding" ! Also, I think it should be tried out
before the next Burning Man! Of course, there's no rush - just thinking about
the idea for awhile brings up some questions:

1. Should there be a master clock signal?
2. A "conductor" who runs the master clock? Maybe folks could take turns
   conducting, maybe in 15 minute or 1/2 hour time periods.
3. Would the conductor have mixing powers, or does everyone who shows up 
   get equal volume into the mix? 
4. Besides the drum machine/rhythm boxes/PCs w/soundboards & sequencers/
   whatever electronic drum & bass, should there be some other folks
   jamming on top of it? Maybe two recordings could be made simulateously -
   one for just the drum machines, and another for the drum machines and 
   the musical/quasi-musical/trippy/industrial/ambient stuff being jammed
   to the drum  & bass.

 I like playing around with concepts! 

 Now I'll have to actually go and buy a drum machine - maybe one of those
portable Yamaha or Boss units....

Hey everyone,

  Burning Man seems to me like one of those experiences in my life I 
will not soon forget.  The whole weekend, the camping, the sun, the
people, the desert, the heat, the night, the fire, the music, the man
burning, all incredible.  
  On Sunday morning dancing to Monty while the sun rised was one of the
most magical "rave" moments I have ever had. That in four years of 
partying on the E. and W. Coast.  The whole event was amazing.  I really
can't say anything more about it. 
  I also have done a photo story about it for the SF State Golden Gater.
All State students and people who can get the paper checkkit out!

My precious BM96 photos have survived the evil clutches of Wal*Mart,
and they are not bad. In fact, some of them are damn good. All I need
now are a scanner and a web site.

However, I was little dismayed to find that some pictures that I
*definitely* remember taking are not there, including the lovely and
charming Amy Starkey and her pal Mel, Jason smoking *** in the RV,
various shots of VW campers, tons of naked muddy people shots, and
other stuff. Between the missing shots (and the fact that the colors
were not what I expected), I would strongly advise others to avoid the
the Wal*Mart 1 hour photo torture chamber. I don't know what I was
thinking.

But anyway, I'll bring the good ones with me to Beautiful People and
Harmony 3 year, so just look around for me.

This is a blast!!! Me & some friends did this a while back. But we only 
had one drum machine/module. Please wait till I get there :) on the 29th. 
we had one person do the sequencing from his PC, then the rest of us 
twiddled knobs. It was totally crazy. We recorded it but it's a little 
rough around the edges. But then again we mixed it through a couple of 
cascaded DJ mixers.... Nasty!

I am in the Ventura area until the 20th.  If anyone wants to set 
this up, I have been a drummer since I was 10 so you can count me in!
I have a huge collection of toys that make good sounds, and I'm sure 
I have an old drum machine laying around some where...

Let's make this happen. This is the coolest idea I've heard in a
while.  Of course, it could sound like total sludge, but I think it'd
be fun to try to tweak out some phunky rhythms. I have two drum
machines in case anyone comes empty handed.

So are the bass patches on drum machines fair game, too? Or only
precussion.

Someone just make a date and bring some amps!

Help me out:

I'm trying to figure out where this CD I have fits into the musical
realm.  Can anybody help me distinguish between jungle and breakbeat? 
Are they similar?

FYI: the album is "Deeper Wider Smoother Shit" by james Hardway.  Label
is Hydrogen Dukebox.

Thanks in advance,
pauly

        It seems as though society doesn't accept people who are gods of
their own. We have to live in our own worlds in fear of being constantly
scrutinized by holidays and jehova's witnesses. Even schools promote
christianity (though most aren't supposed to). 
        As always, people are afraid of what they don't understand but if
you're afraid of something, you probably won't try to understand it and by
that time, you're just all fu*k*d.

i think there should definitely be someone on the board, if for nothing 
else than to keep the sound from turning into a muddy mess. of course, 
there might be grumbling if someone is completely muted out (with 10 drum 
machines going, could you tell?), but i think there must be *some* volume 
control. perhaps each person could be assigned a specific set of drums, 
much like an orchestra. person a gets the kick drums, b gets the snares, 
c gets the cymbals, etc. that way mixing might be a little more 
straightforward. we'd be the sfraves philharmonic orchestra.

whoa, whoa, one thing at a time. unless someone wants to spring for a 
48-channel desk (and unless someone is good at running one), i think we 
need to see if the drum machines will work. percussion often being the 
most complex part, if it works, then more should work on top of it.

perhaps we should compile a list of the equipment available for this.

i have a kawai xd-5 module. just a keyboard to control it with though.
a friend (not on sfraves) has an Alesis D4 and a bunch of pads (and a 
16-channel mixer). he might be into joining us.

jmar!

I think the laser guide idea is great. I also think there should have been
more emphasis on safety in the newsletter, if not even a whole seperate sheet
handed out upon arrival.  If you get a chance Tony run these by the BM guys,
maybe via their website. Insist on a response & let them know how concerned
we are.  I would be willing to pay a few extra bucks for the laser and maybe
a shuttle bus.

P.S. I think the laser gets disperssed too much after a couple miles though.
P.S.S. If you hear from them, see if they will put up a word on their site
about the fund for Omar too.

And as long as we're on the topic of Satan,

     A True Example of someone with way too much time on their hands:

     Given: BARNEY=A CUTE PURPLE DINOSAUR.
     Prove: BARNEY IS SATANIC.

     The ancient Romans had no letter U they used V instead so...

     BARNEY=A CUTE PURPLE DINOSAUR --> BARNEY=A CVTE PVRPLE DINOSAVR

     Extracting all the Roman Numerals we have...

     C V V L D I V

     100+5+5+50+500+1+5= 666

     666 is the mark of the beast!!!

     therefore... BARNEY IS SATANIC

Steve

Yea.  Strange, the same thing happens with my toaster, and microwave,

I think we should try it both ways. Part of the cool thing about drum
circles is the random/chaotic/improvisatory/fuckup aspects. Sometimes
that's annoying. I know you personally like your beats synced-up and
perfect; I personally enjoy the "slop" of a real drummer, because
that's the house that funk built, and w/o funk, there is no point to
making music (IMHO).

I have an Emu EIIIxp with a disk-full o' samples to contribute. I'll
probably need to borrow a friends octapad cuz I'm reluctant to bring my
Yamaha SY-77 keyboard out to the desert (it weighs a ton!).

Yea, I woke up Friday morning to find one of the little bastards in my ear.
Upon inspection with a flashlight from a friend, it started moving so I said
"yea, good....go to the light little bug".....  but bug had other
ideas...... bug didn't like the light and decided to retreat further into my
ear.  PAIN!!!!!!  You should have seen me freaking out uncontrolably in my
tent with this little creature pretty much fully controlling me.  Eventually
after walking to the ranger station it decided to leave it's new home.  Saw
Vince asleep on the couch out front of the station.  Do you remember Vince?
I was traumatized by the experience for about two hours after that.  Slept
with earplugs in the rest of the time.

I can do some cool trippy sounds via a breath-controller sweeping the
digital filters on my EIIIxp sampler. Kinda like the "acid" sound you
get out of a drum box w/ sweepable filters except you're in better
control. Can sound Kinda like a digi-digeridoo...

I have not seen much talk about this movie, so when I saw it last night
I did not know what to expect.  As it turned out, I enjoyed it.

Yes, it had such tired subjects as Virtual Reality, Leary, Computer Animation
and smart drugs.  But, I thought it was all tied together in a pretty
interesting context...  Humans' desire to change their environment to
suit their needs, instead of adapting to the existing environement.

The movie seemed to be similar in scope and content to Douglas's Rushkoff's
Cyberia.  It touched on raves, psychedelics and ecstasy.  There was a good
scene where they mixed people in a rave with computer graphics, an 
effect that I thought gave a pretty good idea of what raving
under the effects of psychedelics is like.

Personally, I thought the synthetic beach and ski resorts in Japan were
pretty cool and relevent to the movie.

Yes, there is some problems with the movie, it is a little rough around
the edges and in our hyper-accelerated world, lots of the material is
already dated (like smart-drinks at raves).  But, much like Cyberia,
this movie is interesting becuase it deals with subjects you never,
ever see on TV or in movies (although most of it is pretty normal
for most sfraves!)

This movie is playing for this week only in the Castro theater, there is
a posibility that Thursday will be the last night, but I am not sure.  If
you have never been to the Castro, be sure to arrive early to hear some
incredible live organ music and soak up the killer ambience of that classic
movie house.

Finally, I wish I did not have to say this, but I feel I must:  Please
do not start a thread out of this post unless you feel it is absolutely
necessary that all the other sfravers should know your comments about this
movie also.  Please Please Please.

we have to do what everyone else does: designate a driver.  it doesn't
matter whether you're coming from a rave in stevenson alley or the middle of
the playa, the same safety rules apply.  and we have to also remember that
driving speed is not usually limitted by road conditions but by visibility,
which means that even though the desert is wide open, it's still not safe to
drive fast at night.

the bigger point is that carelessness doesn't work at an event like bm.  if
people cared, they wouldn't toss cigarette butts all over the playa.  they
wouldn't use fireworks in the middle of a crowd.  and they wouldn't drive if
they're not cold sober.

the only realistic way to make more careful events is to construct them in
ways that exclude people who don't care.  in the case of bm, the best way to
do this is to move it somewhere less accessible.  next year, it should be
held somewhere like alaska or montana, maybe at the end of 200 miles of
difficult dirt road, where people will have to put in real effort to get
there.  people who don't care won't bother to go, or they won't make it.

        Reply to:   Harmony & Omar

Hey there,
My name is Jason Green, and I Greg and I started Harmony together 3 years ago.  I just wanted to say thanks a lot for your post, concern, and energy.  Omar is a very dear friend of mine, and I quite honestly have not known what to do or think since the BM tragedy.  I have never had someone so close to me come so close to death, and to know that everyone else out there is coming together and putting forth whatever they can, not money necessarily, but LOVE AND POSITIVE ENERGY more importantly, means SO MUCH to me, Greg, Omar, and everyone.  Right now we can use all that we can get, and I really believe that with the power of positive thought, positive energy, and the love that we all share, we can help Omar pull through this.
Thank you again...

>from the 3 year anniversary will go directly to Omar & his family. 

well, this should provide added incentive to all you people who were
deliberating on whether or not to go to harmony 3 year, or BP on friday. if
nothing else, go to support omar and his family.

and if you know you are going to go, please buy your tickets soon. the
harmony crew puts all their money back into their parties, and as such don't
have a big fat bank account... so the advance ticket sales go towards paying
off some of the initial costs. even if $20 seems like a lot of money, please
make the effort to scrape together the cash. in light of the recent tragedy,
harmony needs all the support we can give them.

Hi, this is Moonpup, and I just wanted to say While I did not know Omar
personally, I was very sad to hear of his unfortunate accident, and current
predicament. 
 
I will be coming to Harmony this weekend and I wanted to offer my services
to you (free of charge)  not so much at this event, as I'm sure you have
your line-ups sorted out already..........but at a future event to help to
make $$ for the Bills that Omar will incur. 
 
This is not a BSP but a real attempt to offer the only thing I have thats
worth anything. (my DJ skill). If I had $$ I would offer it. As I just
returned from 4 months in the UK, I feel I have some fun tunes and energy
that I could add to any of your events. Thanx 
 
I'll see you this weekend..........and I hope all goes well........till

	the blue spinning light tower was a weird blinking lights
	installation designed by me.  vince was invaluable in adding
	the final supporting welds, as well as a better vehicle to
	help support it, and moving it to its final location.  this
	tower was an enhanced version of the one i set up for the
	wbl parasphere camp last year.  (if you are interested,
	the elements of the tower are:

	1 strapini base (base 66)
	28' pipe
	2' pipe
	cheesborough (right angle, rigid)
	2 blue "police" becaons
	12 starstrobes with deep saturated gel
	6 cube taps
	4 sand bags
	power cable
	todd wrench (c wrench will work finefine)
	elbow grease

	everything but the starstrobes was rented from my great
	pals at impact lighting (the strobes are mine).

	v&w also put their most killer awesome radio transmitter
	on top so we could broadcast what was on the wbl sound
	system or if it was not playing then vince's mix tapes ;)
	the wbl sound system generally lived in the chill space
	between the rasta rig and the fellflat rv.  bianca's
	smut shack had the most robust generator to power the
	thing, and vince fed it with gas.

	anyway, irrational geographic was a group effort (with the
	exception of one group of really bad apples) that would
	have suffered greatly without v&w camp and their creativity
	and resources.  i for one love them.

Hey there,
Thank you very much for the offer and support. If there is a slot open, I am going to see if we can have you spin - Greg has pretty much organized most of the party while I was at BM, but I will talk to him, and see what the story is.  Thanks again, and I will see you soon...
_jason_
P.S. I think I have met you at one point, but my memory fails me.  I guess I'll just have to meet you again!  : )  = )
It'll probably end up being one of those "OH!!  You!  I know you!" things : )

	sure.  i'd want it limited to line-level only, nothing acoustic.

	the wbl 4014 sequencer (macintosh) is perfect for this task.

This is actually a better idea. In a drum circle, everyone has their
own sound, their own space, and their acoustic source. This should be
no different.

In light of Moonpup's very generous offer, maybe we could put together an 
all-volunteer party to raise money for Omar's family??

I know there will be donations Friday night, plus profits (?) from the 
3-year, but each of these are parties with large overheads.  Maybe a 
Saturday bbq or a house party with _all_ proceeds going to this cause?

I'm willing to help plan, but have never put together a party.  Are there 
people out there who'd like to make this happen??

With love,
Nancy

	Now what I think would be cool is to make a "virtual" drum circle, by 
sending MIDI over the net or telephone.  I can see two ways it could work: 
realtime, or by sharing midi loops.  I think realtime would be harder to 
program, and probably wouldn't work over the net (due to delays) and would 
probably be difficult even with direct modem connections.

	Loops might be easy though.  Heres one way it might work...  you'd need 
a central net site to submit loops to and pick them up from, and a way to load 
loops from the site into your sequencer.  The site could divide the available 
loops into old stuff (for general use and getting started), and current stuff 
(ie, what the current "virtual circle" is).

	To join the circle, you'd copy the current loops to your sequencer, run 
them, then find your own part on your drum pad/keyboard.  Once you have 
your part recorded, you'd submit it to the "current" list, then the other people 
could pull it into their sequencer to add your part to what they were listening 
to. There should also be a way to take one of your loops out of the circle when 
you think it's getting old... The web page would need a short expire time to 
stay current, or you could keep hitting "reload".

	This could work with GM/GS, or you could add samples for custom 
instruments (for people with wavetable cards).  At least I hope it could work... 
I don't have much actual MIDI experience (I have Cakewalk and an AWE32, but I'm 
short on time and motivation).  It also depends on windows/macos being able to 
handle running tcp and midi at the same time (or, getting a good sequencer and 
sound card support on unix...  the official SCO answer is probably "thats not 
server-side software", but sometimes the hackers come thru).

	It wouldn't be the same as a real circle, but it would be a lot easier 
to organise, huh?  Seems like all it would take is a CGI script and some 
conventions on .mid files or whatever (both the names and the internal stuff, 
like devices/channels and timing).  Also, I'm not sure how to paste binary data 
into a form (for uploading midi files).  In fact the easiest would probably just 
be to use FTP, and the "upload file" command in Netscape (instead of the CGI 
script).  The "current" and "old" areas could just be two directories with 
public ftp access.

  lc> out before the next Burning Man! Of course, there's no rush - just
  lc> thinking about the idea for awhile brings up some questions:
  lc> 
  lc> 1. Should there be a master clock signal?

  I'd argue that no master clock should be used. Yes, there's a danger
  that things could get messy and out of hand without a master clock, but
  that's part of the idea, isn't it? I think the more minimal and raw we
  could make this whole thing, the more interesting the results could
  be. Or maybe do part of it with a clock, and part without. I'm planning
  on bringing at least one hand-built percussion module with me next
  year, that may or may not be sync-capable (promises, promises).

  lc> 2. A "conductor" who runs the master clock? Maybe folks could take
  lc>    turns conducting, maybe in 15 minute or 1/2 hour time periods.

  Nahh... drum circles work as well as they do (if, in fact, they do)
  because they're ego-free.  I could also drag out the argument about
  techno being "anonymous music," but that may or may not be applicable
  here.

  lc> 3. Would the conductor have mixing powers, or does everyone who shows up 
  lc>    get equal volume into the mix? 

  I say that everyone should have equal volume. Basically, I consider
  anything that has the potential to increase chaos should be left in
  (which will come as no surprise to people who know me). Drum machines
  are cold little boxes that make cold little sounds, and you have to
  work to allow the sound of a drum machine to breathe.

  lc> 4. Besides the drum machine / rhythm boxes / PCs w/soundboards &
  lc>    sequencers / whatever electronic drum & bass, should there be
  lc>    some other folks jamming on top of it? Maybe two recordings
  lc>    could be made simultaneously - one for just the drum machines,
  lc>    and another for the drum machines and the musical / quasi-
  lc>    musical / trippy / industrial / ambient stuff being jammed to
  lc>    the drum & bass.

  I vote against extraneous accompaniment, but I think that owners of the
  various drum machines should be allowed to hack the sounds coming from
  them as much as they'd like. If you want to run your kick through a
  ring modulator or a Rat distortion pedal, more power to you. You'd be
  surprised how much can be expressed purely with percussion -- many of
  my most reliable dancefloor tracks are all-percussion (Plastikman,
  Robert Armani, most Basic Channel and Chain Reaction stuff, Fawn,
  G-Man, and many others are all artists that make excellent minimal
  techno using little except processed beats).

  lc>  I like playing around with concepts! 

  Me too!

  lc> Now I'll have to actually go and buy a drum machine - maybe one of
  lc> those portable Yamaha or Boss units....

  Well, geez, man, there are very few drum machines that _aren't_
  portable. If you're looking for lots of drum machine for a little
  money, I'd recommend finding a used Roland DR-550mkII or DR-660. Tons
  of noises, decent on-board effects, and an unholy bitch to program with
  the built-in sequencer. Loads of fun to be had!

Omar is a very dear friend of mine, and I quite honestly have not known what
to do or think since the BM tragedy.  I have never had someone so close to
me come so close to death, and to know that everyone else out there is
coming together and putting forth whatever they can, not money necessarily,
but LOVE AND POSITIVE ENERGY more importantly, means SO MUCH to me, Greg,
Omar, and everyone.  Right now we can use all that we can get, and I really
believe that with the power of positive thought, positive energy, and the
love that we all share, we can help Omar pull through this.

Hello everyone,

    Well after reading the Re: mail I have gotten, it seems to be that 
in my haste to spill my feelings I have forgotten to give a name to 
make that donation checks out to...

    The name of Omar's mother is : Jolaine Reed

    You can send any donations to the Harmony Po box which is:

    Omar
    C/O Harmony 
    Po Box 111084
    Campbell CA 95011-1084

    As I said, some profits from tomorrow nights Beautiful People Party 
will be going towards this cause. As well as all profits from the 3 
year Party. This is not at all enough! If you can afford to please 
donate anything. $1 - $5 - $100 it doesn't matter, just anything will 
help! If you can't donate $ at least donate your love. Send Omar as 
much positive energy as you can. Together we can all help him pull 
through this awful tragedy!

    Also, the thought of a whole seperate party to benefit Omar has 
been brought up. The party will be called "Tigger." It's Omar's 
favorite character in the whole world!!! He has been nick named "The 
Tigger" by all of us in Harmony for a couple years now! I am working on 
this project as we speak. If you are interested in being on the crew 
list, please respond to me. The date for the "Tigger" party will be 
most likely the first weekend in October, unless something else comes 
up. But that is what we are shooting for. Keep in touch!

Thank you for your love and support for Omar!!!!

Peace and love,

Greg :)

but then in an acoustic drum circle, each person has instant access to 
only a few instruments, not an entire drum orchestra as is available on 
many drum machines. And in the drum machine circle, everyones sound will 
be pumped through a few speaker cones, that is unless everyone wants to 
bring their own amp. And if everyone *does* bring their own amp, would 
that mean everyone else would have to limit their own output to match 
the person with the lowest level? Sounds like the same thing as a mixer 
to me.

Hello again,

    Well, it's time to post about the BP party tomorrow night. It is 
definately on!!! This party is dedicated to Omar and his recent 
misfortune. We will be donating a portion of the profits to Omar's 
mother to help her fly back and forth to Reno to see him, as well as 
cope with the tragedy. In the midst of this awful time there is a lot 
of positive energy floating around. We ask that all of you grab as much 
positive energy as you possibly can, and bring it to tomorrow's 
Beautiful People Party!!! We need to come together and bridge the gap 
between thought and action!!! So come and dance with us as we celebrate 
life, love, harmony and the effectivness of positive energy!!!! Omar 
needs us right now, and we need him, so let's all join together as one 
family, brothers and sisters, to send him the biggest dose of positive 
energy humanly possible!!!!!!!

    Dj's: Trent - Minor Minor - Brandon - Dano - Greg :) - Moonpup(?)
                                                    (not yet confirmed)


        (408)486-9591   &   (408)450-3044   &   (415)263-4885

    The space is in San Francisco, and there is a map point at 
Frequency - 8. F-8 is located on the toip of Haight st. in S.F. Ticket 
price is $15 or $10 with your prepurchased Harmony 3 year ticket. Also, 
for those of you who don't have your 3 year tickets, they will be on 
sale at the map point, and then if you purchase one you can take 
advantage of the discount as well. Feel free to bring anything you want 
except for guns, knives and negative energy (like that will be a 
problem:) Bring all your positive energy and love for Omar and our 
family. There will be a brief moment of silence for our beloved friend 
at some point in the night. This will hopefully reach our friend, and 
show him that we are here for him. 

Peace, love, and harmony to all beautiful people,

100 Acre Woods and The Harmony Crew :)

Dear All;

        I think any parents who don't love their children UNCONDITIONALLY,
ARE SATANIST. It's  a funny think that those who do all the accusing usually
commit the worst acts; sad but true. These facts actually lend some
credibility to the existence of Satan/God. 

        For I say if I/you were Satan; what better way/place to hide who and
what you are than behind the mask of church/religion. For if you were pure
evil, & you had a lot of time; almost an enternity, you would have to be
very, very clever so not to be recogized, and hide/mask yourself in such way
so to be almost beyond reproach.  At least that's how I would do it, if I
was Satan, pretty clever huh.

        Try playing the devil's advocate and see what YOU come up with. Ask
yourselves, if I was Satan; pure evil how would I corrupt the word of God;
see what you come up with, and apply it to most of the reigions present today.

        Personally, I think there is/was a very, very sick English King
laughing at all of us from is grave, with the greatest of delight.

Peace

Since Brian automatically trashes my email, could someone relay to him that
he should go back and read Greg Sandler's heartfelt emails about Omar, and
that yes it was Omar in THE accident at Burning Man (refering of course to
the accident upon which a car ran over a tent full of sleeping ravers, for
I imagine if you were friends with the motorcyclist who ran into the van,
you might consider that THE accident, right?), and that the people asking
him for money, "with no cause or reason behind it" are doing so because 1)
Omar had no insurance, 2) Omar may be in ICU for a very long time (6
months?), and 3) Omar's mom lives in San Jose and Omar will be in Reno for
that very long time, thus she will need to travel there and back, taking
time off work.  All reasons to help offer some support....

Sign me,

Informed but automatically trashed

I think everyone will want to lend a hand. Count me in.

I also only know Omar from seeing him around, friends of friends, and
from City Espresso. But I think it's really cool how so many people
have wanted to jump up and support him and his family. Some of us know
him well, some just know his face, and some of us just don't know him
at all. But no matter what, he is family to us.

Many of us have moved here without a family, and maybe family is
several thousand miles away. It's so nice to know that there are
people, both friends and strangers, who can fill that gap during times
of need.

You guys rock.

always tickled pink just to be alive,
Steve

Howdy Folks!

I thought Id introduce myself, share my Burning Man experience, and ramble on 
aimlesly about other things. The names Nathan, and Ive been lurking here on the 
list for some time now. Ive been getting really excited about the sense of 
community on the SFRaves list, and am looking forward to checking out some 
upcoming events and meeting some of youz fine peoplez. My AWESOME experience at 
BM, and the Raves camp motivated me to say hi.  Hi!

Short Bio:
24 years here on the Planet. Originally from Boulder, CO. Drawn to the Bay Area 
cause of its coooolness, went to SCU. Went to a few big commercial raves while 
in school, and to some incredible parties when I studied in Berlin two years 
ago. (INCREDIBLE energy over there- lots of spontaneous unplanned parties in 
basements and courtyards of partially bombed, never rebuilt buildings in the 
former East Berlin, with half-buried buses, gutted jet fighters, raw metal work 
art.  Other cool places like Ewerk, a former power plant converted to a disco. 
Entering through barbed-wire gates, dancing in, around and on huge rusted 
machinery and equipment. Before the Wall came down, all young Germans had to 
either serve two years in the Army or do two years community service, unless 
they lived in West Berlin.  W. Berlin became a magnet for all 
artists/writers/other cretive types, and when the Wall came down, they moved 
into the numerous deserted buildings in the East, and have created an amazing 
scene. If you get a chance, check it out soon, as it may not last long. Rents 
are going up,  owners are slowly re-claiming and developing the buildings, the 
capitol was moved from Bonn to Berlin, etc. GO NOW BEFORE ITS TOO LATE!! 

Anywayz, moved to SF, the Greatest City on Earth, a year ago. Work for Big 
Corporate America, but in a small group within BCA; I like my job, I like the 
people, so its not as soulless as it sounds. Also started a web consulting firm 
(shameless plug: www.cwsi.com) last November. Likes: music, motorcycles (anyone 
else got one? lets ride!), food, Yahtzee, enjoying life.

BM was a super experience for me. It was my first one, but I had been planning 
for it for months. It evolved into a Mecca for me, a pligrimage to the Desert, 
a chance to exorcise some personal demons that had been building for some time 
and to turn around some bad karma that was beginning to evolve. My posse was 
the Golden Shower Camp, the folks who brought you the Mass Shower ( and the 
resulting Mud Fashion Show, the Mud Wrestling, and the Slide Contest). It was 
alot of work, but an absolute blast to be able to participate and to let people 
get good n muddy and bond with Mother Earth.  

Very sad to hear about the injuries of the people who were hit in their tent. 
It seems that whenever something great gets big, tragedy seems to follow. Not 
to place blame, but after catching a ride back from the rave camp around 6 am 
on the trunk of a kind souls big american boatster (thanks again if youre out 
there) with Shakti and two other Gents, we were hanging out at the camp 
cleaning up, and there were two pickup trucks of drunk young Yokals racing 
around the camps, tearing through the mud pit splashing tents, and generally 
causing trouble. Im assuming they found the responsible party, but if not, I 
think I got a bit of video of the truck when I was filming the sunrise, and the 
time frame seems to fit.  However, it should be said that the locals were m
ostly very cool. One family of local alfalfa farmers set us hard core with the 
use of their water truck, which was used to bring all that water to the 
shower.  Another older couple gave us some huge inflatable boxing gloves. 

On a related subject, if anyone wants a copy of the video, I have about two 
hours of footage. Email me, and send me a blank tape, and Ill make a copy. Most 
of the scene is taken from the perspective of the Golden Shower Camp, and there 
is unfortuneately no footage of the Rave Camp, but I do have some good scenes 
of the Playa, of Mud People, and of things burning including Helco, the Man, 
and Stonehenge. But I missed the Opera scene and the burning of the Castle, so 
if you happened to film that or other stuff, PLEASE email me and lets trade 
tapes.

Other highlights of BM:     

huge Hell-themed opera, that ended with the burning of a large ornate castle; 
bands driving around on trailers, everything from heavy metal to polka to a guy 
with a pipe organ that mainly played the theme from gilligan's island; a couple 
incredible rave camps; a structure of 80 pianos, that was of course burned; 
probably 3-4 drum circles at any given time; a large recreation of Stonehenge 
that was 
also burned; drag shows; mud pits, with wrestling, slide contests, fashion 
shows, etc; parachuters; freaky circus acts; motorized couches that cruised 
around; motorized toilets; rocket powered bicycles;  constant 
fireworks; meditation to the melting of a 500 lb. ice sculpture; and,naturally, 
the Burning of the Man itself. All this under a full moon, on the very surreal 
environment of a huge dry lake bed, devoid of 
features. 


Enough talk. Lets dance. Im going to try and make it to Harmony this weekend. I 
will probably be wearing a half red and half yellow cat collar with three bells 
on it, and probably some form of velvet. See you there!!   

-Nathan

Chances are, everyone wouldn't have an amp to bring. But if so, I'd
argue that it would actually sound better to keep everything to a
lower level. Going back to the drum circle analogy, each instrument
produces very little sound in comparison to the entire group. But when
you add everything together, the sound is enormous.

Now take a large group of electronic instruments, each capable of an
enormous sound individually. Put them all together. Sludge.

How is this different from a mixer? location, location, location!
Piping everything threw a common amp gives the feeling of a single
acoustic location, as opposed to spreading everything out. In real
life, sound doesn't come from a single point; it comes from
everywhere. Real life isn't stereo or mono; it's omni.

I still say we surround ourselves with guitar amps and go off.

always flexible,
Steve

Rick, Nancy,

I too am in (ambientwise) if anyone else is.   ( I can supply a couple of
fidgety 1200's...crotchety enough probably to only be used in a chill room
and an equally fussy mixer...if someone can help with transport)

Rick, what is idm?  I'm curious to know how you play live...I recently did
a "live" performance with guitar, drum machine, turntables & some effects
units..I'm interested in talking and/or working with you, if you are.

Let me know how the response is.

peter

Jason, 
I don't know you  nor Omar nor anyone form Harmony, but I do lurk on the 
sfraves list, feeling in someway connected with your positive vibe and
everyday enjoying something new on the list. With that aside I want to send 
my deepest sympathy and the hopes that your friend Omar makes a fast and full
recovery. I know your pain as I have lost a sister at the hands of a drunk 
driver. Omar sounds like a very happy and strong person, so the chances of 
him coming back ar great. I know that with all the pos energy that I and 
everyone else is sending will make its way to him and help him along his 
journey out of his coma.
Amor y pas,
Mello

Well Adam....
Don`t know about people over there, but here in Norway things are beginning
to start up after a slooow summer again... a club called CONCRETE who`s
considered as one of the best here in the capitol, has reopened again :) (it
has been shut down by the authorities plenty of times before due to drugs
etc...)

Me and some friends of mine are planning on checking it out... 

Anyway, hope all of you will have a great weekend!!   :)

play it again, sam...

ok, I am really interested in this idea! I have been playing around with
progrmming beats on my 486 with a 16 bit sound card using two
programs...one called drum and the other the drums. I am getting some neat
results (especially since I began to sit in on an african drumming
performance class)but the output is not that great. What other sorts of
options are out there?, If I were to consider getting a drum
machine what are the variables there?

Leslie,

You couldn't have echoed my sentiments about Burning Man more eloquently. I
had many different experiences than you did, and some of the same, but the
awe and wonder at seeing a civilization begin and end within the span of a
week was nothing short of magical. Everyone who came to burning man came
with the motivation to experience something out of the ordinary--and we
certainly all did.  ;)

Now I understand why everyone I spoke to who had been before couldn't stop
talking about it.  It's like nothing else I've ever experienced. Thanks to
all who helped to make it possible!

Still reeling from all I learned...

Hi all!

 Well, for those that care (blessed be) today is my first day without 
pain medication since last friday and my 2nd day without wearing my arm 
sling. My shoulder is sore and weak but healing.
 Also, thanks to the kindness of some friends (including a semi-lurker 
with money to burn ;) I have places to stay until I can get back into the 
dorms on Sept. 24. I do thank all those who sent kind 
words/thoughts/vibes etc..  =)

 On to better things; BP is tommorrow (in the City) and promises to be  
_fun_!! Greg (as usual) is stressing so please come early and come often 
(oops, wrong crowd). Bring hugs and toys and your wonderful selves. 
Dionysus Dreams will be there to help with techno-decorations
 Please keep in mind that we are trying to raise money for Omar who was 
injured at Burning Man by a careless driver who drove past parked 
vehicles into a camping area and ran over tents with sleepers in them. 
Omar has sustained numerous skull fractures and bruises to the brain 
(incredibly bad for a person!!!) He is in a coma at the ICU in Reno and 
will most likely be there for 6 months or so. His mother is also 
incurring plane costs as she lives in SF and our benefit proceeds will 
also help with her travel costs. (jeez, now my shoulder injury seems pretty 
silly) 

Peace and love,


Ran

Okay, this sounds like it could be a cool idea, but I don't think all of 
sfraves needs to be hearing it.  Becuase of this, I MAY start a 
drum-machine-circle list to take this off of sfraves.  If you are interested,
let me know, and I will add you by hand.

Steve, Rick, Peter, Melvin, and SFRaves family,

It's heartening to see so many people willing to help!  Greg is already 
organizing a fundraiser, I think it would probably be best if we all 
threw our energy behind this one!!  "Tigger" in early Oct.  :)

Greg, let us know what us (or anyone) can do to help make this party as 
amazing (and lucrative!) as possible...

So use a quadraphonic mixer, or something, to spatialize all the different
sound sources!  The mixer controller then is the one who "lays out the
sonic space" for all the rhythmakers.

Now if only we all had T1's and the streaming-audio Netcast 1998 version
of Mixman, we could put the entire thing up on the Net and let anyone
who wants to do their own mix of it, or even join in... hell, perhaps
someday there'll be a worldwide network of continuously jamming random
folks... latency'll kill you, though....

That'd be cool--to have the "ambient voice of the Internet" continuously
playing in the background.  Hmm, I wonder who's working on this already?

Sorry for the digression >-)

Subject: MY FAULT ! THE VIRUS IS A HOAX ! I DIDN'T MEAN IT !
Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

Sorry for the hassle...

Despite what you might think, I just forwarded this message that I got from
someone else (who got it from someone else...) and it was in a good
intention.

Those messages are mostly sent by people who are usually altruistic enough
to care for other people, otherwise, they would keep the message for
themselves which is probably the way most of you acted when you were still
a "newbie" and you found the same kind of message in your mailbox.

For your information, let me tell you that a virus can be sent in
attachment to a message, and therefore, one is never too cautious...

The funny thing is that:
1- Everybody supposedly knows it's a hoax, but everyone read it !...
2- Most of the mailing lists are flooded with useless and unwanted
conversations that take up much more space, but no-one complains...
3- I never got so much mail from people bitching and complaining when all
they had to do was delete this message.
4- I got feedback from very nice people who were simply explaining me why I
shouldn't have forwarded this kind of message to people who were telling me
the very same thing in some more primitive way...

By the way, so many people complained about the length of my signature that
I shortened it a little. No big deal though, I don't complain when I come
across a longer signature (and I did... several times...), I just delete
it.
I was even told that I had used the virus subject to make publicity for my
website since its address is included in the signature !!!!!
Ha Ha Ha !!...  If I had really wanted to do that, I would have chosen a
better subject (Like: "Something Interesting"), don't you think ?

I think that too many people make mountains out of molehills and that is
why the pseudo-virus in question is so talked about. I'm sure there will
still be people talking about it in a week from now... (interesting
conversations in view on the mailing lists !...)


Prove yourself that you have a life: Don't reply to this letter.
(I know some will anyway since they don't have anything else to do...)

My apologies to those of you that it truly bothered (for some reason...) +
to the ones who made light of it for the obvious irony of this mail which
is only directed to those who feel concerned.


                                            See ya !

                                            Topher.

I heard that while the Spaz crew was in New York City, they met up with some
people who invited them to use their wearhouse to have a party. When they
showed up they were instructed to drive inside to unload their gear. One of
the people there pulled a gun and told them to unload their sound system,
turntables, records, etc. into another van alond with their distrubitor cap
and were left there!


BUMMER!

HI All:

I just wanted to inform you all that I've added a "music marketplace"
section to the x-radio site.  This is basically an electronic version of the
classified section of the newspaper, and it's FREE TO EVERYBODY.

I've heard from a lot of people that they needed a place to advertise their
used vinyl and cd's on the internet.  Well, now that place exists.  To place
an ad, go to http://www.x-radio.com/x-radio/ and then select the "music
marketplace" item.

Happy trading!

     Following on from my posting last week, i can tell you all that Irvine 
     welshe's latest book "Ecstacy" Is available from the Booksmith on 
     Haight street, price $13.00 ($14.11 after tax).
     
     Available in two different paperback covers : Purple-headed mam with 
     yellow "e" in mouth or red-headed man with blue "e" in mouth.
     
     I chose the former today, although in defference to Burningman maybe 
     some of you will prefer the latter of the two mentioned.

			***Skydiving Anyone***

	Ok, it's been almost two months since I last went skydiving (my second 
time), and, well, I WANT TO GO AGAIN.  The only why that I can explain it 
is that it is the most incredible rush you'll ever experience   Drugs and/or 
sex can't even come close to the sensation.  But since I can't skydive 
every day, they will just have to do :)  OK I don't want this to sound 
like an advertisment, but I just wanted to share an experience this 
great, with the greatest single group of prople I know.  Skydiving was 
one of those things that I always wanted to do, but never had the 
oppertunity.  It wasn't until a friend of mine randamly called me up one 
morning and said lets go jump out of a plain.  My life hasen't been the 
same since.  Just knowing that you can over come you fears is a great 
feeling, but also thinking about the fact that you survived a fall from 
13,000 feet, it really makes you charish life (not that we need any 
reminders about charishing life right now :(  My energy and love is with 
you, Omar).  I won't be planing anything for certain for awhile.  If this 
does happen it will have to take place on a weekend (probablly a 
saturday) and not maybe until a month from now.  
	
	The place where I will be plaining the jump it in Lodi and it's 
called the Parachute Center.  The jumps are all tandem.  This is really 
a good thing, because you have a trained professional taking care of all 
of the technical aspects, you just get to enjoy the jump.  The 
instructor, pulls the chute and helps you steer and land after the chute is 
open.  The only ground school that you get is a fifteen minute video that 
talks about safe exiting from the plain and landings, the instructor 
really does take care of the rest.  Having the instructor there actually 
made my jumps more enjoyable, because I didn't have to worry about 
anything excpet enjoying the fall.  Now because they only have a limited 
number of instructors (around 10-15) we may not be able 
to all go at the same time, but that's OK because while your going the 
rest of us get to watch (and make ourselves more nervous :)  They have 
five plains and the biggest one can hold 45 jumpers, so that won't be a 
problem.  Jumping there is first come first serve, so I recomend that we 
go early and plain on satying a good part of the day.  There are two 
reasons that we could be there for awhile, one if we have a lot of 
jumpers, we are going to have to compete for instructors (this is only 
if we want to jump in larger groups) and because it would be nice for us 
all to stay until everyone in our group jumps.  Right now I have 4 
friends that might go and my girlfriend who is definatily going (this will 
be her first time and she is really not the type of person who would 
usually do this) as long as her nerves stant up.

Ok, now for the bad part.  The cost is $100, this is really the cheapest 
price around.  Another problem is anyone over 200 pounds only gets to 
jump from 6000 feet (instead of 13,000) which means your free fall is 
much shorter and on top of that they charge you more (I'm not sure how 
much).  Another thing that you have to think about is that it really is a 
life and death experience.  Even though the % of people dying is really 
small, it could happen (of course there is a much better chance of dying 
on the freeway, but that's been said about everything)  The amount of 
deaths is really small, especially tandem, but you may feel free to call 
the Parachute Center for the statistics.  This is all that I can think of 
telling you at the moment, all other information can be delt with later.
I hope this works out, it really is a great experience.

PLUR X 100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
            Most of this is for you Omar.

Mattloaf

P.S. The Parachute Center's number is (209) 369-1128.  Feel free to call 
and ask all the questions you like.  Also if we get enough people, maybe 
we can get a group discount???

If you could go on national TV and express your thoughts about raving, what
would you say?  Next week, the Leeza Show is doing a piece on raving, and
it is likely that they're going to have me on the show.

Yesterday I heard a commercial asking for people who were worried about
their kids went to "rave parties" and took "herbal ecstacy" to call in for
an upcoming show.  With that sinking feeling of more bad press and
misunderstanding, I decided it was important not to let another misguided
piece of publicity happen without at least trying to affect it in a
positive way.

I've seen her show several times, and I believe that, albeit a daytime talk
show host from LA, she is a genuine person, not sensationalistic, she is
sensitive and she listens to her guests, trying to learn from them and
empathizing with them with an open mind.  This is not Montel Williams or
Geraldo, although it is aimed at middle american daytime tv watchers.

I left a voicemail that I was the mother of an 18 year old, but that I was
the raver, not she, and I felt that if more people understood that raving
can be a very positive and supportive environment and means of expression
for their kids, they'd worry less.

They called me back today, we talked for 1/2 hour, and they will confirm
tomorrow that they want to fly me down to LA on Tuesday for a Wednesday
show (I'm not sure when it actually shows).  The producer seemed genuinely
interested in understanding what raving is about, and is doing a lot of
research and gathering a lot of information.

I am confident that I can express my reasonable, grounded and open
expression of how wonderful raving can be. But I would like to get some
input and perspectives and words of advice from all of you, especially
about any touchy areas you foresee and how they could be handled.

While on one hand, I can really only represent myself and my own situation
and opinions... on the other hand, I am a member of this community and will
be considered a representative of it by those who see the show.

That's why I want to know what advice and/or concerns you each might have,
things to emphasize, things to completely avoid saying, and pitfalls you
see or major concerns you might have about how my going on this show might
affect our scene and our community.

What's the best that could happen with this?  What's the worst case scenario?
What positive message can we leave people with?  If ravers in other areas
are watching, is there any way our "sf vibe" message that we get so much
positive feedback about can be spread to them?

In short, how can we make use of this opportunity to do good things for the
rave scene, without doing any harm?

I'd like to be a positive voice for our scene, and look forward to getting
some of your thoughts.

Love, Leslie
(YIKES!!!)

Leslie, if anyone is a great spokesperson for the rave scene, it is you! :)
I have no doubt that you can convey the positivity that our scene is made of.
My concerns are not with you and how you will handle questions, but with 
the other guests and how the host will run the show - who will get the 
most attention.

Talk shows stay on the air by their ratings, so Leeza, even if she is a 
"better" talk show host than Jenny Jones or Geraldo, will want to stay in 
the areas that will get her the most ratings.  People like controversy - 
they wallow in it, and my feeling is that she will give unfair time to 
those who think raving is "bad and nothing but druggies".  I am concerned 
that you won't get a fair shot.  Media in general thrives on the "bad 
stuff".

I have no doubts or concerns about you, Leslie.  My concerns are out 
of your control...

But please let us know what happens and if you do get to go on, I will 
record it! :)

love,
Amy

Actually, James "Jack Acid", is the one who got the blunt end of that 
whole deal. I talked to him about a week ago at his mom's place in 
Oklahoma. He said it went down like this: They were unloading gear into 
the wearhouse, a group of what they thought were "rave kids" in a large 
group came up to them on the street. Well, they weren't. They started 
beating people with tire irons and such, and James got most of the 
beating. He ended up going to the hospital for the evening, but for the 
most part he's OK, except for lack of gear. 
 James and I grew up together, and when I found out about this I was 
disturbed to say the least. I found out from Daum "Freaky Chakra" 
Bentley, and he didn't know much except that he was jumped.......

But know I guess it's all good.

I'm confident that you'll do a fine job.  You're sure to be
put on the defensive about the drug issue, however.  Here are some 
points you might want to consider:

1. Kids who experiment with drugs at raves would most likely
experiment with drugs even if there weren't any raves.  This was
true when you were younger during the 60's, 70's, and 80's.

2.  The amount of drug use at raves today is no different
than the amount of drug use today at niteclubs, rock concerts, or
fraternity parties.  If you do not want your kids to be around
any people doing any drugs, you should prevent them from going to
these types of events as well.

3.  The kinds of drugs usually done at raves are safer than at other
places.  MDMA, and the small doses taken of LSD are less toxic,
nonaddicting, and less disabling when compared to the alchohol, cocaine,
heroin etc. taken in other scenes.  Which isn't to say that these
things are good for you.  Fortunately, most ravers only do these
occasionally, or perhaps try them a couple of times and then discover
that they can get a natural high on the music and excitement alone.

4. Many ravers don't do "hard" drugs at all.  It can be fun to stay
up all nite, so many people you know take naps before going out,
or drink coffee.  You don't approve of Herbal E, but it really is
more or less the same as taking pseudophed for a cold, and not 
terribly dangerous.  Most people who try it conclude that it is
waste of money.

5. You know many people who rave and have good jobs, go to school,
are raising children, and are musically or artistically creative.
They find that dancing and enjoying music with friends to be both
mentally and physically healthy, stimulating them in positive ways.
Some people put on raves to raise money for social causes, or to
help someone in need.  For many kids, raving is just a phase they 
go through for a couple of years before moving on to something else. 

Hope this helps.

Lee

Dear Leslie,
If you've been to a rave, you know what's going on and that's all that
matters. Good luck!

Hello everyone,

    I just got to my account and read about ten thousand messages re 
Omar. I think this is great! It really makes me feel alot better 
knowing that he has this much communal support. I can't begin to thank 
all of you!! You guys are great!! But let's not stop here!! I think out 
of this tragedy, we can all learn something, come together and get a 
lot closer with eachother. Life is presious, and we all need to 
remember that... all the time!!! These things are reminders, (awful 
reminders, but reminders non the less). 

    Anyways, I just wanted to say, that I love every single one of you 
for putting forth this much positivity in our family's time of need! 
With all of this positivity going around, I am really pumped up for 
tonight!!! This is going to be insane!!! I just know Omar will be able 
to feel our energy tonight!!! He has to!!!

    Well, I am going off to set up the party!!! I will see most of you 
tonight!!! And thank you, thank you for all of your love and support!!!
(Man, I have a feeling this party is gonna kick ass!!!!)

Peace,

Greg :)

I won't have final confirmatin about the Leeza show until later today, but
I wanted to let you all know how overwhelmed I am at the support many of
you have given me, the reassurance about my being a "representative" of
raving and our community.

I'll be at BP tonight, if anyone wants to express anything in person .. or
if you want to give me any written stuff (articles, quotes, etc.) that you
think will be helpful as I center myself and focus on how to succinctly
express what we're really all about.  I'm keeping all messages and will
review them many times before the show to help prepare myself (from my
background in public speaking, I know that for me, preparation is
everything!)

I really love all of you, and am so grateful to have you as part of my life.

Leslie

;))!  You'll know it's me by my long ponytail with colorful hairbands in

I hope to see all yo beautiful people tonight as well.  I had been planning on
spending this weekend at a cabin about 30 min from Tahoe but I can't miss this
party so I decided I'd go up tomorrow instead of tonight.  For those that don't
know me, I have shoulder length dark brown wavyhair, which you might be able
to see sticking out from under my white hat. :)

     Don't forget to check SoCal Raves for any good parties while you're 
     down there... last one I went to in LA was a killer outdoor in the 
     forests above the city.  Booo-Teeee-Fulllll.
     
     Keep a cool head, and understand that they will try to fire at 
     raving's soft white underbelly:
     
     The age of a lot of ravers
     
     Drugs (I usually bring a couple tabs of aspirin, sometimes a 
     decongestant if it's outdoor...)
     
     Open Sex Orgies (I keep missing those somehow...)
     
     Loud Music (Hello!)
     
     I think that's it.. oh, there's that staying up all night thing, 
     but... oh well.  And a lot of people don't... usually when I get a 
     ride from them (doh!).
     
     ***THEY SAID THE SAME THINGS ABOUT THE BEATLES!!!!!*** well.. maybe 
     not the wild sex orgies...
     
     Please mention that most large events have permits and security.  
     Security even searches people when they go in to many raves, so it 
     ends up being "just like a concert" or other mass event.  Hope they 
     don't all get that way, but we might as well push that.
     
     As for VIBE:  It's like driving a Harley or having sex.  Until you've 
     felt it... you won't understand.  Probably better just to mention 
     everybody dancing talking and meeting, drinking smoothies, hanging 
     around the DJ and going out to watch the sunrise.  Who wouldn't love 
     that?
     
     I've only met you once or twice, but I couldn't think of anybody 
     better to go take a stand on this in front of all those couch 
     potatoes... wish you luck and mucho positives!
     
     Peace
     AndyW
     
     P.S.       Bash the pee out of that scene in Basic Instinct... 
     
     Oh, and plan 'B'... if you like really underground raves that are 
     really small... tell them the drugs are just a prelude to the ritual 
     offerings, which you only enjoy because of the smile on our spiritual 
     leaders face as he lures the goat over... sacrificing virgins, pits of 
     fire, John Denver played backwards, etc.

Yeah!!!!

Go Leslie :))).  I am so sure you will be able to open eyes of some people
(at least).  Maybe a good idea would be to have some printed mail that has
been posted on SFRaves and read parts of it.  I can remember Shawna's post
and there were few others in the past that were very touchy and that also
showed some aspects of raving (I can go through my old, saved files and
pull some out for you if you want me to).  Maybe taking some picts would be
cool as well.

I hope everybody is great - I have been quiet for a while - the Burn was
amazing, but I was slacking at work before I left for it, so now I have so
much to catch up with - it will be hell for next 3 weeks (till we ship our
product).

Love & hugz,
Branka

P.S.  I won't be partying much in the near future - have other things on my
mind and my mind and body needs some quiet time after the Burn....

        I believe it stands for intelligent dance music.  I used to

Somewhat related to this is the fact that the American public doesn't get 
hedonism.  That damn Protestant history of ours tells us as a culture to 
be simple, serious, and not to partake in "sin" (whatever that is).  If 
you talk about how much fun it is to stay up all night and dance and 
indulge from time to time, the moral majority would just reject that for 
the simple fact it goes against what they were taught.  Not all 
countries or cultures are like this.  
When I lived in South America, they really knew how to party.  There wasn't 
a night of the weekend (and even some weekdays) that you didn't stay out ALL 
night dancing and sometimes drinking.  Parents never forbid their children 
from doing this, rather they encouraged it and frequently joined in.  
Some of my friends told me that the people live for parties and that's what 
they save up all of their money for (this was in Bolivia).  And talk about 
hedonism, you should try Carnaval en Rio or other countries that have this 
celebration.  In Argentina it's custom to eat dinner at 10 p.m so you can 
have some fuel for staying out all night.  Of course there is a 3 hour 
siesta worked into the day so everyone can sleep.

I guess what I'm getting at is that not all countries in this world find 
hedonism a bad thing.  (also, South America has other societal 
restrictions like women don't get to be as unrestrained, but 
that's not what I'm talking about) Unfortunately in a country that rejects 
it, especially on talk shows, it might be a bit hard to explain this.

cheers,
KaySEE

Maybe suggest having a DJ spin live at the show, to give the audience an
idea of the type of music you'll be talking about.  And then suggest a
female DJ.

I think the single most important message you can covey is that we are
trying to affect change within the communites around us.  That we comprise
an immensely talented and diverse group that are brought together not just
through parties, but through a common social consciousness.

Whatever you do, don't give out the Sunset phone number.  ;^)

Yep, even the wild sex orgies. Rock and roll was as much the "work of

do now. :)

I remember seeing one of those PBS 10-part rock n roll documentaries, and
there was this interview with a "concerned citizen" from memphis (In the
EARLY days or r'n'r) who complained about all that "nigger music" the kids
were listening to... Now the common misconception is that raves are for
"gangstas" or "junkies..." I guess one trendy stereotype replaces another,
right?

Leslie, tell those "concerned parents" that one day, society'll be waxing
nostalgic about the good times they had while raving. Kids will be
borrowing mom's big trousers for the school "90's dance." There'll be
oldies stations playing prodigy. and we'll all be exstatic having
experienced it firsthand.

see you all at BP (hopefully <=P ) and H3 (definately! =)

Branka, it sounds you've never watched one of these shows. :-)

You have to talk really fast in order to finish a sentence!   There's
no chance anyone would be able to read anything.   However, they'll
probably like the pictures, so they can have something to put up under
the logo while they fade to the next batch of commercials.   They'll
probably need a signed statement by whoever took the pictures giving
broadcast rights to the show....

Also, almost nothing spontaneous ever really happens on TV, they ask
everyone in advance what they are going to say, including the people
in the audience who ask questions - who are all pre-chosen.

I think Leslie is a great choice to represent raving on TV - be sure
to let us all know when the program will be broadcast!

I think if I had only one sentence to say about raves, it would be
that the universally acknowledged motto of ravers is Peace, Love,
Unity, and Respect.  

Just saying that automatically cancels out people's vague ideas that
raving is a satanic hard-drug orgy.

I highly recommend the short film "The Hippie Temptation".   It's
simply a CBS TV documentary from the 60's about the Hippies in the
Haight.  It's a classic because it was made in the 60's (as opposed to
those recent documentaries about the 60's, made with hindsight).   The
film often plays at Art Cinema houses, or possibly can be rented....

I am confirmed for taping on Wednesday.  The show will air a week to a
month later ... since I am on vacation for 2 wks during that period, I will
make sure they notify someone who will then let you all know when to
watch/tape the show.

The producer of the Leeza show assures me that there is never any sabotage
or nasty dealings with guests ... and that their audience is usually pretty
low-key and doesn't have super-strong opinions....  he asked me to pass on
two things:

1.  They are looking for a mother/child duo where the mother thinks raving
is horrible and just an excuse for a drug-fest, and the child disagrees ...
and they're willing to go on tv together.  If you know someone who would be
appropriate, please call Jason at (213) 956-5612 ... obviously they should
be able to represent us well ... I told him I'd post to the list, but had
no idea if anything would come of it   ; )

2.  If you are in the LA area, or know someone who is, and want to attend
the show in the audience, call Jason at that number and he'll arrange for
tickets.  It sure would be great to have some ravers there in the audience
rather than just a Hollywood tourist crowd ... can someone forward this to
socal raves for me?

3.  Oh shit.  Hmm, now which hat to wear?  I'll be at Beautiful People
tonight, so see you all there!

Leslie

Uh. I've been raving since Ibiza summer of '88, and I do not
universally acknowlege PLUR as the raver motto. Does this mean I'm not
a raver? Damn! 

> Just saying that automatically cancels out people's vague ideas that
> raving is a satanic hard-drug orgy.

No, they'll just view it with the same disdain and ridicule as they
viewed the "peace and love" flower children, who had equally
mealy-mouthed platitudes that they couldn't possibly apply to anybody's
lives not even their own (unless the riots/deaths at altamont were some
twisted version of "peace and love"). And the only thing we've got from
that generation is a bunch of hot-tub-soakin'$40k-saab-drivin'-libertarian-
i-got-mine-so-you-get-yours-votin'-yuppies whose vision of saving the
world has been simplified into buying toilet paper made from 50%
recycled materials and buying overpriced free-range tofu from Whole
Foods. (sorry, I recently spent too much time in palo alto...:-)

Please remember that the majority of the amerikkkan TV-watching
publikkk doesn't give a flying fuck about "peace" "love" "respect" or
"unity". They want to see football players killing each other, boxers
bopping each other in the face, wars, victory, competition, blood, 
competition, domination, competition, and huge wads of wealth gained
through cunning/crime/theft and plundering of natural resources. They
will simply laugh at your lifestyle and then try to figure out a way to
suck some money out of you, throw you in jail, or transform your
lifestyle to their level of pathetic degeneracy. 

Ahem...

ALso, I don't think it would be a good idea to point people to the
hyperreal web site unless you blank out or hide the "better living
through chemistry" section. 

I hope you're a strong person, because they will attempt to make you
look pathetic and stupid in your rejection of USA-prescribed mores.
Don't even mention drugs because that's tantamount to admitting to
witchcraft during the salem witch trials. You'll have about as good a
chance of looking good on such shows as an avowed communist appearing
on TV in the fifties, attempting to explain that the Amerikkkan
lifestyle is corrupt and pathetic and that there is a better way.

Also, if you come off as well-spoken and intelligent, they'll probably
pass you up. TV talk shows thrive on showing a  bunch of lame
cat-fighting doofuses. Talk shows are a catharsis that make even the
most pathetic couch potato feel good about sitting on his/her ass
wasting life away watching TV instead of living.

 I found this on a paper some where.... with everyone helping out Omar I
thought it kinda went along. It's and exerpt from William Saroyan's play "The
Time Of Your Life."  Enjoy =)~ !!!


     "In the time of your life, LIVE-- so that in that good time there shall
be no ugliness or death for yourself or for any life your life touches.  Seek
goodness everywhere and, when it is found, bring it out of its hiding place
and let it be free and unashamed.  Place in matter and in flesh the least of
values, for these are the things that hold death and must pass away.

     "Discover in all things that which shines and is beyond corruption.
 Encourage virtue in whatever heart it may have been driven into secrecy and
sorrow by the shame and terror of the world.

     "Ignore the obvious, for it is unworthy of the clear eye and the kindly
heart.  Be the inferior of no man--nor of any man be the superior.  Remember
that every man is a variation of yourself.  No man's guilt is not yours, not
is any man't innocence a thing apart.  Despise evil and ungodliness, but not
men of ungodliness or evil.

     "In the time of your life, LIVE--so that in that wondrous time you shall
not add to the misery and sorrow of the world, but shall smile to the
infinite delight and mystery of it."


         That's it.  Follow it and share it with others.  There are people
that could benifit from living by this passage.

hello leslie and sf-ravers!

i think this is fantastic!  i'm forwarding something to you entitled
"House Music and Planetary Healing."  i'm not sure if we've corresponded
before but i've gotten a general impression of you from your posts about
you and your floppy hats :)

let me preface by saying i love you all and i hope we can agree to
disagree and i love reading all of your posts!

my and my "family", the AHAU collective have a definite point of
view and intention behind the parties and gatherings we throw, "House
Music and Planetary Healing" being the foundation of the gatherings
where we channel love, positivity, and healing energy through our djs
and "energy dancers" along  with other educational vehicles such as
"Conscious Manifestation" classes (classes on using the power of your
imagination to create the life of your dreams and becoming balanced in
the 3rd dimension) and upcoming classes on
self-sufficiency re: making your own soap, shampoo, hemp products and food,
nutrition, cooking, ect. and community  vegan/organic dinners. what does
this all mean?  we are all ravers and met on the dance floor!  we all felt the
power of channeling positivity in and out through the dancing and music
and wanted to expand that exctasy (not the drug, although we respect
everyone's personal path and are not against anything) into all areas of
our lives so we formed AHAU.

i loooove sharing our process and welcome any questions or feedback and we
love visitors.  as a matter of fact, Shawna McCourtney is here right now
(although she's probably still being a sleepy kitty at my house :).

ok, looks like the system is having problems...

suffering from tech support fever,

bren :)

wow, neil!  that's very intense...i would have to say that reality you
speak of is but one probability in a field of infinite possibilties and
although i disagree, i respect your position.

leslie, i would just get your intent very clear in your mind before the
show and don't let any opposing ideas enter your consciousness, whatever
your intent may be.  you know what you are going there to do, you are a
very powerful being and will know exactly what to say in the moment.  you
are going to rock!

Alright Leslie!! Maybe we'll finally get some positive coverage!

And don't worry, I'll get as many PlUrRy socal ravers as I can to go 
with me and support you in LA.

Oh and btw, I say you where the flower crown outfit that you wore to
the BP at the deli last May.

To the list: any ideas of something we can do collectively to support
             Leslie and our scene since most of us won't be able to
             make the taping???

Phat mental hugs to you all,

CT

P.S. See you at the Harmony 3-Year!!!!=)

Hello,

I just watched a 5-minute collage on CNN about BM.

They just let the participants talk about it, without commentary -
probably because the reporters couldn't figure out what it was.  :-)

My favorite comment in the report:
-------------------------------------------------

Reporter:  "Why is this important?"

Gal:  "It's not important!  It's just a lot of fun!"

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Perfect !   Someone pontificating on and on about why it is important
for society to do this, blah blah blah, is, to me anyway, contrary to
the whole spirit of such things.


Cheers,

Ken

Nope, "sweaty hellhole" seems quite applicable.

Yo!

Hello all yall.  I been busy as a B latly and haven't had a chance to tell
all ov ya 'bout my weekend.  Went to San Luis Obisbo Late friday night and
all day saturday I was checkin' the town and looking for job opportunities.
I planned to go to Keepin' the Vibe that night but I got tired from drivin
and spending some of the afternoon at pismo beach.  I reached Santa barbra
around 8 or 9 and decided I didn't want to drive the rest of the way to La
and then back to SF the next morning and I remembered there was a party on
the Socali calender in SB.  So...... I went!

Right on the campus beach.  Voice mail was cool with directions and I found
it well but I had been there before.  As I was walkin' down I noticed
several typical college peeps drinkin and chatin';  I was totaly suprised
to see such a jumpin' crowd in SB at the beach.  Music was great and I
danced for awhile. The Entertainment was great and I met several people all
of which were really nice to talk to.  The only drag was that the party
ended at 3.30 when their permit ran out and surprisingly they only had 1
complaint.  I met some of the crew including Sam (damn he's tall!!).  I
can't wait for another party down there.

I'll be moving to San Luis Obisbo and was wondering how the local scene is.
Any Socali_ravers on the list from San Luis or even SB.  I remember Mason
from the LOVE party I went to saying your local. (Were you there Mason? I
think I saw ya but I might have been eeing things)

Sorry Adam I didn't get a chance to page you.  I wasn't anywhere for long
enough for you to call me back.  And when I was I figured you were already
on your way up from SD.

Sunday when I got back I went to the Smoke and Grooves concert and Saw:
Tribe called Quest w/ Busta Rhymes, Fugees, Cypress Hill, and Ziggy Marley.
Yeah I had a great time.  SOOO much smoke and sooooo much groovin'.  White
Cliff of Fugees did Mission Impossible: rapelled down to the stage and then
played some guitar wit his teeth, Cypress had their stage decorated with
greenery and even "made it a rule to smoke on the stage in SF" Can anyone
say : Hit's from the (6ft) bong!!  I loved Ziggy too.  Great energy and
rhythms.

Hmmm.  I'm gonna try to check out Beautyful People tonight after going to
the Laserium with some friends (pink floyed's The Wall is back at 10:30)

  Peace all

Actually, it focuses more on crunchy, out-there dance music like Aphex Twin
and Autechre, with healthy doses of avant-Jungle like TPower and chunky
trip-hop like Gescom and DJ Food.

And yes, it can get to be a very expensive habit, but it will do wonders
for your record collection!

Uncle Bill told me that on Monday. He said was teaching Big Bad Sadam a
lesson for being really nasty to those poor Kurds.

On Tuesday, Uncle Bob said Uncle Bill was good for teaching Big Bad
Sadam a lesson for being really nasty to those poor Kurds.  Uncle Bill
told me that he was protecting American Interests as well as those poor
Kurds. He beat up Sadam some more. Yay!

On Wednesday, Mr Newspaper Man showed me a nice map which showed in
blue all the good countries who liked Uncle Bill for for teaching Big
Bad Sadam a lesson for being really nasty to those American Interests
and the poor Kurds. The map showed the nasty commie countries who
didn't like what Uncle Bill had done in red.

On Thursday, Mr CIA Analyst said that it looked like Big Bad Sadam had
stopped being nasty to the poor Kurds, but the Kurds were being nasty
to each other!

On Friday, Mr PBS Radio Man told me something that really got me
confused.  He said that some of the Kurds had asked Big Bad Sadam for
help fighting some of the other Kurds. This made me sad because it made
me think that Big Bad Sadam hadn't really deserved the beating that
Uncle Bill had given him. But them I remembered that Uncle Bill was
protecting Americam Interests and I guess that makes it ok.

>From my review of BM on some Aussie lists. Thanks to whoever
posted the Aristotle quote.

----------------------------

The playa is special in the spirituality of the local Indians, and it
is easy to see why. It is a crazy place where anything larger than a
bug has the life steadily sucked from it. Humans lose 3 litres of sweat
per day out there; more if you actually do anything.

The festival took place in a 10000-strong tent city, gloriously out of
place in the middle of the playa. The desert is strangely in-tune with
the rhytms of inner-city night-owls, demanding idle days and bustling
nights. However the desert was firmly in control, and the festival
recognised this. Themes of impermance and fiery destruction permeated
it.

On the Saturday evening Helco burnt: a huge, powerful, industrial
music/stilt-mime/flame-thrower performace in a compound filled with
metal human sculptures and wooden structures. A loud hailer preached
anarchist slogans, "Burn all the companies on the New York Stock
Exchange!" "Burn it all down and start again. Burn!" It culminated in
the burning of a skyscraper. The six-metre model had dominated that
corner of the camp for days, effectively disguised by painting it
bright red. Only when it became a black frame silhouetteing fire-filled
windows was its true nature revealed. 

Some things at the festival were surreal almost beyond description -
a huge, spindly, traction engine-shaped four-seater dragon machine
quadricycle, with a flaming V-8 pistonned heart and a fire-breathing
snout. "Like all American hotrods, this things is a gas-guzzler - it
goes through a tank of gas every 15 minutes."

The festival rangers spent most of their time desperately preventing
human incinerations. "Stay behind the machine! Don't get in front of
the machine!". Some of the things were just insane - a fire breather
bragging about how he got second-degree burns when a flaming fluid can
he was attempting to throw above the crowd instead spilled over his
hand.

Lots of things were just plain fun. A motorised couch accompanied by a
roving standard lamp. A large, grey, furry armidillo motorbike. Many
groovy art-cars. Colourful tents, chai tents, tent camps, weird camps,
rave camps, camp people, camp newspapers and "the highest density of
shaved heads and pierced nipples of any city in America". Rock music,
house music, trance music, hungarian vocals, a sitar, a violin, and a
digeridoo i-guess-this-makes-it-world music, drum music, industrial
music, ambient music and polka music by Polkicide.

Dominating all was, of course, The Man. His five-story neon-illuminated
presence dominated the festival until the final night. A crowd drummed
and danced around his ashes for hours.

   "Mystery festivals should be unforgettable events, casting their
   shadows over the whole of one's future life, creating experiences
   that transform existence." - Aristotle

Ok, I asked someone a while ago for their impression of Acme and the 
response I got was something like "sweaty hellhole".  Anyone else got any 
definite impressions they'd like to share?

Debating,

S


Lots of rooms, I liked it, but its hard to get any kind of unity going 'cause everyone is spread out over three floors.

The plumbing is pretty atrocious as well, the downstairs toilets overflow all the time.

 The wiring is supposed to be ratty as well, the lights in the downstairs bathrooms seem to go out every time I'm there.

The stairs seem like tragedy waiting to happen.

I personally attended about 7 parties there in the span of 4 months. 

On the bright side, there is lots of parking, and I've never been to a party there that was busted by the fuzz.

Hope that helps,

I have a lot of respect for Leslie and think she is a nice person to 
boot. 

That said, Don't count on it. The only reason that the proliferation of 
lousy daytime talk shows exist is because they thrive on controversy. 
They do not exist for the edification of the populace. Rather they exist 
to pander to the vouyeristic and confrontational needs of the audience 
that aren't fulfilled by their pathetic, meaningless exsistance. These 
people do not wish to be educated, they want to be entertained.

hello adder :)  nice to reply to you...my 2 cents is it's not quantity
it's quality.  you never know who may be watching and who may hear
something they've been waiting to hear...i think you get my drift :)

big hugs,

brenda

hello leslie and sf-ravers!

i think this is fantastic!  i'm forwarding something to you entitled
"House Music and Planetary Healing."  i'm not sure if we've corresponded
before but i've gotten a general impression of you from your posts about
you and your floppy hats :)

let me preface by saying i love you all and i hope we can agree to
disagree and i love reading all of your posts!

my and my "family", the AHAU collective have a definite point of
view and intention behind the parties and gatherings we throw, "House
Music and Planetary Healing" being the foundation of the gatherings
where we channel love, positivity, and healing energy through our djs
and "energy dancers" along  with other educational vehicles such as
"Conscious Manifestation" classes (classes on using the power of your
imagination to create the life of your dreams and becoming balanced in
the 3rd dimension) and upcoming classes on
self-sufficiency re: making your own soap, shampoo, hemp products and food,
nutrition, cooking, ect. and community  vegan/organic dinners. what does
this all mean?  we are all ravers and met on the dance floor!  we all felt the
power of channeling positivity in and out through the dancing and music
and wanted to expand that exctasy (not the drug, although we respect
everyone's personal path and are not against anything) into all areas of
our lives so we formed AHAU.

i loooove sharing our process and welcome any questions or feedback and we
love visitors.  as a matter of fact, Shawna McCourtney is here right now
(although she's probably still being a sleepy kitty at my house :).

ok, looks like the system is having problems...

suffering from tech support fever,

bren :)

			House Music and Planetary Healing

	When used with positive intention, Group Energy has the potential
to help restore the Plan of Love on Earth.  If you have been exploring
House parties, or have found a home in them, you will, of course, be aware
of the intoxicating Energy levels reached sometimes, both personally and
collectively.  It is possible to understand better the Energy we tap into
and take it a step further.  There are many preliminary ingredients to
becoming spiritually aware, and even more to be able to focus and channel
Energy.  Those aspects can be discussed at another time.  For now, this is
what can be done for that moment:  OPEN YOUR HEART!!!
	When you open your heart, and trust the whole group you dance
with;  when you feel love with everyone, and they return it, a higher
vibration can be reached.  This happens when when a crowd is deep into the
vibe of House...What we have here, when the crowd is open is the ability
to access some extremely beneficial Energies, and focus them instead of
losing them.  Down through the ages this knowledge has been available to
the few who have been able to recognize it; it seems the House Nation has
tapped in.
	In the true use of rhythmic movement, the effect is to align the
physical, mental, and emotional bodies with the Oneness of All that Is.
And this lining up, when coupled with intense aspirations of love and high
desire,..."results in a download of Force from above.  This causes a
vivification of the (three bodies) and definite illumination.  When an
entire concourse of people is thus animated by a single high desire, when
their aurus blend and form one united channel for for the downflow, the
effect is tremendously intensified and can be WORLD WIDE IN ITS RADIUS. "
(Alice Bailey, 1919).
	Help push the consciousness another level into Enlightenment.
It's up to each of us at the party (rave) to make it happen.  Don't put
out negative energy and feelings.  Leave the old ways behind.  Throw
yourselves into the winds of transformation and sow the seeds for a new
world - one where the human family is together again.  When people respect
and care for each other as a community organism.  It's up to us to spread
the vibe.
				Spread the Peace!
			    You do make a difference!

I think this is rave related...I have been a mostly casual observer of the
list for the last 3 or so months now & I have met a few people (Leslie,
David, & probably others) at raves that I later on found out was on the
list.. the problem I am having is getting consistently good E & getting it
from someone who is reliable.  I have met people at 1015, Wicked & other
events who I transacted with & I advised them that I would like to establish
a business relationship with them so that I don't have to necessarily go to
an event to make a purchase...most people give me their #'s & I think it is
cool...the stuff I've bought has been fairly good, but when I call for
another purchase it either takes days for someone to call me back or
something else comes up..I guess I should stop babbling & just get to the

an order of 20 or 25 e's....if so, please e-mail me or call me 552-5004...my

Dear Leslie,

	Wow, lucky you...?  8)   I'm sure you will be a good
representative of all of us, and good luck.
	The advice I would give is to assume you're only going to get 30
seconds to speak, and figure out how to say what you want to say briefly
and intelligently within that time frame or less.
	From what I've heard and read (never having been on a talk show
myself) guests are often given little time to say anything, or what time
they are given is not really theirs to use because they are forced to
respond to questions thrown at them by the host or audience members that
may have little to do with what they had expected or wanted to talk about.
	In that 30 seconds, I hope you could put in a good word about drug
use, something to the effect that responsible use of illegal substances
can be a safe and positive experience for teens or older people.  I would
urge this because the subject is sure to come up anyway (this *is* daytime
TV) and better that viewers at least get one balanced view of illicit drug
use at parties to counteract all the hype that they're liable to hear and
have heard.
	Of course I would personally love it if you also talked about our
Constitutional right of freedom of assembly, and how we are harrassed and
our lives made difficult by the police and other authorities, but it's
your appearance.  8)

er ... i don't think that THIS is the kind of drug-related post that 
should be appearing on a public forum which is accessable by anyone.

i too had my first ACME experience last night at Beautiful People.

yes, it was hot, sweaty, stuffy, and the toilet facilities were less than
adequate...

but it was still an amazing party... a good vibe can really overpower other
negative circumstances.
        by 2 or 3 in the morning i had forgotten all about the air quality...

plurally,

brian

hello all-

i went to beautiful people last night (earlier today, depending upon
perspective).  it had all the elements of a good rave: good music, good
people, good chill space, and lots of smiles.  it had all the things you
come to hate about acme, but still deal with, anyway: the bathrooms, the
heat, the must.  but, we all deal.

i became a rave grandparent at beautiful people!  at chrysalis, shawna and i
escorted brian denny and stan into the scene, so they dubbed us rave parents
(that was cool on it's own!).  but at beautiful people, brian brought his
friend susan into the scene, himself becoming a rave parent, making me and
shawna rave grandparents!  i dunno, after a while when the newness of raving
starts to wear off, i need to find new things to keep the raving experience
special, and helping someone through their first rave experience is one of
my favorite ways to keep it special!

i had a blast with my book.  it's this big black book that gets passed all
around, and people came up to me with these excited looks and said "hey
matt, can i write in your book?"  that was fun, and earlier this morning i
really enjoyed looking through the book and reading what people wrote (or
drew, or whatever!)  i know in 20 years, i'll be able to look back at that
book and say "wow!  that's how i lived!  how the hell did i survive?"  so if
you're ever needing to curl up in the chill room with a pen, a blank page,
and your imagination, let me know, and i'll set you up!

well, i made a promise to myself at beautiful people: become a sober raver.
as much as i enjoy mind altering substances, i've done them enough, and it's
time to learn how to do it myself without the help of a little pill.  my
goal is to be a good sober raver by january 1, so if anyone sees me high at
a rave, slap me around a little and remind me of my goal!  i think that each
person needs to decide what their substance usage level is, and that we each
need to respect that.  i've just be so impressed recently by the number of
completely sober ravers that i've hung out with that are still absolutely
loving raving, and i decided that i want to do that, too.


well, those are my thoughts at 2:15 pm on saturday, after having time to
shower, walk, read, and grock the entire experience.  this was my last
"fucked up" rave, and harmony will be my first "totally me" rave.  wish me
luck, and send me love as i attempt to make this transition.

love-

matt

well, i want to thank _everyone_ for coming out last night and making BP
such a great party - the vibe was incredible, and i know omar could feel it
miles away in reno.

i'd never been to the acme before, but i do understand now why everyone
refers to it as a sweaty hell - damn it gets hot in there >=) .. i got there
about 6:00, and was totally blown away by the amazing chill room the harmony
crew had put together - it was absolutely amazing.. of course, it doubled in
it's appeal when it was full of happy ravers.. :)

it was my first time working the map point for a party, and wow is it a
hectic experience.. of course, it's great when you get to the party and
recognize everyone there, because you talked to them and sold them their
ticket hours ago. a big sorry to everyone i gave shitty directions to,
although everyone i talked to said they found it all right (obviously - they
were there, weren't they? <g>)

of course, sitting at the map point, i had absolutely no idea how the party
was going.. i left the map point at 1:00am, and was amazed at how great the
party had turned out when i got there. it was hot, yes, but everyone had
huge grins permanently attached to their faces and were having the time of
their lives.

the gateway sound system is awsome. there is no better word to describe it.
the sound was so perfect - really clean sharp bass, and good strong midtones
so you could easily hear the siren's call of the drums. wow, i haven't heard
a sound system tuned so well in a long time. =)

well, enough rambling from me.. a big hello to everyone i met and didn't
meet, and i hope to see you all next weekend down in santa cruz. =)

Hello,

eMpTyVee is going to be a little less empty tonight, as they are
showing a one hour program of Ambient Techno videos tonight, actually
technically Sunday morning at 3 a.m.

In any event, MTV often starts stuff EARLY and/or LATE, so you might
want to set your VCR for a few minutes before, and as much as 10 to 15
minutes after when it should otherwise end.

This broadcast is a repeat, and last time, the AMP broadcast was a
little longer than one hour, and started quite a few minutes late.

Artists include Aphex Twin, Orbital, Underworld, Sun Electric,
Chemical Brothers, F.S.O.L., Autechre, and Ken Ishii, among others.

PS  Disclaimer:  The schedule is according to TV Guide magazine and
also some IDM list readers.   MTV could change its schedule....


Cheers,

Ken                         <*>

Subject: Review: Beautiful People
X-Mailer: <PC Eudora Version 1.4>
Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

The last rave I went to was a Beautiful People.  Now that I'm dating someone 
that isn't into raving, leaving me with less time to party, I have to be 
very picky about what parties I attend, so I always make sure to hit 
something I know will go off.

I wasn't disappointed last night.

I hadn't tried to get to Haight Street since the Fell exit closed, so I 
found myself meandering in the wrong direction while trying to find the map 
point.  At one stop light I looked around and realized there were several 
hookers working that intersection.  Yow.  Good ole country meets the big 
city.  I was relieved when the light changed...

Fast forward, I've gotten my tix, I've already met up with Adam and Brendan 
and seen several other smiling faces.  Now to find ...

<lightening splits the dark sky, a fierce hot wind whips through, discordant 
organ music plays a single horrid note>

... the Infamous Acme Warehouse!

<more crashing lightning, a distant, maniacal laugh!>

The hamstas were doing the navigating, scurrying across the map laid out in 
the passenger seat and telling me which streets to turn on, so it's no 
wonder it took me another half hour to get to the right street.  Finally, 
Moscone center was in sight... 

THE PRODUCTION: I finally walk in and...  Yup.  It's hot alright.  The music 
is hot, the lights were good, and the visuals were fantastic!  The video 
sequences were the best I've seen.  The music was good ALL NIGHT LONG.  I 
don't recall a time when I went upstairs and didn't find something on that 
made me want to dance my brains out!  The decor was classic Harmony and 
there was a drinks counter downstairs that was a little slice of heaven, 
serving water and slushies.

THE HEAT: There were two large fans upstairs that were a godsend, but 3 feet 
away from them you were already back into jungle-like heat and humidity.  
Not so bad as to be uncomfortable, but definitely a sweathouse.  Of course 
the upside to this kind of humidity is that you don't have to blink as much. 
 I think I blinked maybe twice the whole night -- gotta save the wear and 
tear on the eyelids, y'know...

THE PEOPLE: Typical Harmony crowd - utterly fantastic.  All smiles, all 
hugs, all night.  The first person I run into once I'm in the door is our 
very own TV celeb-to-be, Leslie Ayres!  This is a good sign.  I've never 
been to a bad party with Leslie, or at least I've never had a bad time if 
she was around.  Adam, Jondabomb, Brendan, more people than my weary brain 
can recall and more.  Wayne, Marcy, and Tim (Mr. Spraybottle) were there 
too, another really good sign.  I chatted with them about Burning Man.  I 
figure this was the year to go, in spite of the accident, since it seems to 
be spiralling out of control to a point where the local officials may not be 
so tolerant in the future.  I'm sorry I missed it.

THE ALTAR: I don't know Omar personally.  I've met him, but never got a 
chance to really chat.  I know him more by reputation.  Still, I was really 
touched by the altar that was built, and I spent quite some time looking at 
the pictures, and thinking hard about how fragile life can be.  This 
situation hits me really hard: when I was 19 my best friend was struck by a 
car and killed.  That really screwed me up for a very long time.  I guess 
you could say you never quite recover from that kind of loss.  I can only 
wish Omar and his family the greatest strength, the deepest healing, and I 
send out my love to him and hope that he gets better soon.

COOL MOMENT: Dancing on top of the table on the side of the main room.  Got 
a lot of huge smiles back up at me.

COOL MOMENT: A lady sitting crosslegged downstairs, her head bowed and her 
hands steepled over a Winnie-the-Pooh backpack lounging against her legs.  
Very cute!

COOL MOMENT: A lady whose name escapes me (actually, all the names escape 
me...grumble) who kept jumping up to hug me whenever I came by.  She was 
@29, a high school teacher, long, thick, super-curly hair, with a heart on 
her chest and smile on her face.  She told me she had come to conclusion I 
gave good hug.  My oh my...

COOL MOMENT: A standing love puddle rub session on the stairs with a young 
lady named Jen and her friend...  Very nice.

COOL MOMENT: Adam Luong tearing it up with his glow sticks and gettin' BUSY 
with the speaker stacks...

COOL MOMENT: Sharing nectarines with some very tired little kiddies.  Big 
smiles and hugs.

NOT SO COOL MOMENT: Standing in line to use the bathroom.  Geez, if you 
didn't go early in the night, chances were you wouldn't get to go at all.  
And I didn't.  I've found in the past though that if you just keep dancing 
hard, the feeling goes away.  I suspect that your body is capable of 
reabsorbing the liquids back into your system when you're dehydrated, and I 
was sweating up a storm.

THE END: I finally packed up around 4am.  I passed out the fruit I'd brought 
with me, said goodbye to the people I found immediately around me, and 
stepped out into the night.

POSTSCRIPT:  On my way home, I was brought back to the non-warm, non-fuzzy 
world by an incident...  I'm driving along, trying to figure out how to get 
back on the highway, when I see these two homeless women fighting.  I stop 
and jump out to see if I can help.  Bad move...  If you're interested in the 
story, I'll tell you in person some time, but suffice it to say that 15 
minutes later I'm back on the road, my shirt torn all to hell and the inside 
of my car thrashed.  I can't do other than try to help when I see someone in 
trouble, but geez, sometimes you end up jumping into situations better left 
alone.  So I'm driving home, my lovely post-Harmony glow utterly wrecked.  I 
fumble around in the passenger to seat to see if I can find something I left 
there.  At first I can't find it.  Then I think it's beeen broken in the 
melee.  But then I see it's just turned off, so I flip the switch.  My 
mini-lite-brite lights up with the sun on it that Kirsten (KaySEE) created 
at the last BP.  My own little piece of sunshine.  And the night suddenly 
seems better again...

I am so overwhelmed at the positive support that I've gotten about the
Leeza show next week, I can hardly express it.  I've received email from
more than 50 different people with their insights and encouragement, and
have spoken to at least that many more, and I want to thank everyone from
the bottom of my heart.

Last night, Beautiful People truly was.  The space had been transformed,
upstairs and downstairs, into a glowing, shining, happy environment that
made me like the  Acme again (ok, another toilet is definitely in order!).
I was exhausted, and normally would have stayed home, but I went early to
help set up (not early enough, it was already done and looked awesome)...
and planned to leave really early.  Early on, I was dancing, and feeling so
happy to be there, and I realized that I'm not scared or nervous to go on
tv, because through raving, I've become much more focused, clear and
centered about who I am, so there's nothing to be afraid of ... I'm really
just excited.

All evening long, I was walking on air, talking, laughing, hugging, and
soaking in the amazing energy and excitment from everyone that we have at
least an opportunity to show the country the positive side of raving.  With
all that energy, plus the help of a double-espresso+coffee depth-charge
from Steve Simitzis and Matt (thank you!!!!), I ended up staying until 3am,
and driving home with a huge smile on my face.  I am so fortunate to be a
part of this community.

The taping is Wednesday, so please send me your energy and love that day.
If you want to attend the show in the audience, call John Downey at
213-956-5978 and he'll arrange it (he's the assoc producer or something)...

We don't know when the show will actually air, it could be a week or a
month later, they say.  I'll be leaving town for 15 days on 9/24 (cruising
through the Panama Canal on the Luv Boat, how weird is that???) ... and the
show may air during that time, but I'll make sure that SFR and my friends
are all notified somehow.

I feel so proud and honored to be part of this community and will represent
us all in the best possible way.  These are my intentions:

* To show with my presence that raving is a positive, uplifting and
transformative experience.

* To help parents feel reassured and happy that their kids have a place to
go where they can be themselves with no pretense, where they can express
their love and affection with their friends, where they can hear music that
reaches deep inside them, gives positive messages and frees them to express
themselves through dancing, and where they can discuss and learn about
themselves and our society through a higher community consciousness.
Raving is about celebration and personal development; it's all about the
positives, at least how we do it

* To help ravers in other places where there may not be such a positive
scene know that they can create their own vibe wherever they are.... and
bring that spirit into their parties, too, if it's not there already.

* That drugs, though people would like to think they are the key element of
the scene, are only a part, and that many ravers use no substances at all
to alter their consciousness .... the music and dancing and vibe can do it
all on its own.  And when conscious ravers choose to use substances, they
usually talk about how helps them to connect with their open hearts and the
love and connection they feel with other people ... which changes them for
the better forever and in their everyday lives.  For conscious ravers,
drugs are not an escape from reality, rather drugs are a tool to open their
minds and hearts so they can be better people in the everyday world ...

* Hopefully, to have some young ravers who misuse drugs see that it's not
helping them to do that, and that what they lose will outweigh the
benefits.

* I will not mention any names of any people, of any organizations who put
on parties, of locations, nothing (nope, not even if you've asked me to
please please say your name on tv!! ; )

* I won't emphasize any specific drug use (apart from pointing out that
ecstacy/MDMA were originally prescribed for relationship counseling because
it allows people to open their hearts and empathize with others in a real
and long-lasting way), as I feel that it would be misinterppreted and the
bigger message (of love and positivity) could be lost, -- As I usually do,
I will speak in broader generalities rather than specifics, because I think
most people can grasp concepts better that way.

* I will not answer specific questions regarding my personal experience
with drugs (having been around since the hippie days, obviously I've had
lots of exposures and opportunities) .. because I don't see it being
productive.  Frankly, whether I am clean and sober or an occasional user of
drugs is immaterial to what I have to say. I have carefully thought out how
I will respond to their inevitable direct questions on this topic.

*****  And, most important of all, I will tell the WHOLE DAMNED COUNTRY
that raving has helped me to become the person I am today, and how amazing
lucky I am to be a part of the most loving and open and energetic community
of people anywhere.  You guys are all so amazing, thank you for being in my
life!!!!!!!  You'll all be on that stage with me!!!! ******

Proudly, and with much love, Leslie

p.s.  The altar for Omar last night was so beautiful.  Not that anyone will
forget, but if each person will make sure to stop for a moment at least
once every day, and send your love and healing energy to him, picturing it
surrounding him in his hospital bed, and picturing his wonderful smile as
he receives it, then we can help him to heal and come back to us.

  Quite a nightmare...and quite the dream.  I want to thank everyone for all
your support & love.  I was the 3rd person in the tent that was run over at
burning man.  So many people contributed their energy that morning, people
who I will probably never see again, but I want them all to know how
thankful I am & how beautiful they are.  It's so hard to express with words,
but I am very new to parties, and when this accident happened to me and Omar
and Erinn, it only proved to me that it is all about family.

Dear ravers,

Last weekend, an incredible event took place in the bay area.  I know 
that a lot of you were at BM, so hopefully this post will catch you up 
to speed on what happened in the bay area while you were in the desert.

Megga-Buzz one was a historical event.  We set out to produce a large 
party that still had the small party feel.  This in itself seems like a 
contradiction in terms, but believe it or not, we did it.  Some 
SF-Ravers were at the party and can testefy to to fact that there was a 
vibe at the event that has not been seen at a party of this size since 
the Toon-Town days.  We could not have been happier with the turnout 
and the positive energe that eminated across the party.  It was an 
incredible vibe, generated by 7000 people, that were having the time of 
their lives.

Ther is never just one thing that can be done to creat a 'positive 
vibe' at an event of this size.  It is a combination of countless 
things coming together just at the right moments that help in creating 
the feeling.  As a production company, we organizing the componenets of 
the party, and designing the concept that we thought would work to 
produce the desired affect.  We showcased only local dj's and involved 
local production.  We did everything we could to involve the local 
comunity, and establish the concept of the showcase within the 
comunity.  We were realy happy with our linup, and the support that we 
recieved from the sceene was very enthusiastic.  

All in all the party went great.  The weather for the night was 
beutiful.   We did not have on negative incident or occurance.  No 
ambulences, no overdoses, and NOT ONE FIGHT in a crowd of 7000 people.  
What does that tell you about the vibe?  I know that these type of 
things come to be expected at small parties, but we are not talking 
about a small party here.  This party had a patranige more diverse than 
any small party ever does.  We had people travel in from the east 
coast, Canada, LA, Reno, Wasington, Oregon, and all over california.  
And the diferent types of individuals was absolutely incredible.  They 
were so diverse in their mentality, heratige, culture, values, ethnical 
backgrounds, and so much more, that when you see them all getting along 
and uniting to the music and dancing to one groove creating that 
incredible energy,...  Thats when you know that your party has made a 
diverence in peoples lives.  Mabee not much of a diverence, but a start 
for many and a reinforcement for most.

There were several wonderful things that i think this party wa able to 
acomplish.

1.  This event exposed at least 2000 new people to the rave scene.  
There were a lot of people there that had only heard about raves and 
the underground(not that this was underground) and have always wanted 
to go to one and were very happy about what they say and I think most 
of them, based on the mesages we recieved after our party on our voice 
lines, have compleatly fallen in love with the scene and want to 
explore more of it and go to more parties,  ALL parties.  This is a 
great thing for our scene.  It is always important to bring in new 
people so that the longjevety of the scene is insured and traditions 
will be passed on from one raving generation to the next.

2.  We were able to show people that a large party can have great 
energy and can reflect some of the intamacy ( mabee not to the same 
degree) that a small party has.  Not very many people belived that this 
was posible, but now I think that they will feel diferent.

3.  We had a lot of old school ravers come out to the party.  I am very 
happy to say that being at a party like this has resparked the somewhat 
forgoten passion for raving.  It sometimes takes a step into the past 
to be a ble to procede forward, and a reminder of oldscool is what some 
of these people needed to get back into the swing of things.  I am real 
happy about this.  It is these experienced ravers that need to pass on 
the traditions to the new ravers and the first timers, and having them 
at the party, it did not take long before they realized their role in 
the comunity.  I thank them all for coming and look forward to seeing 
more of them.

4.  Re rave scene made another positive move in the direction of 
gaining respect from the authorities.  The police asigned to the party 
were so impresed with the crowd and the positive nature of the event 
that they actualy called in other cops from diverent patrols to come 
over and check out the party to see what a wonderfull experience it 
was.  I have never been praised by so many cops in my life for the 
service that they thought i was doing.  I wish I could have taped some 
of the things these cops said about the party.  It gives me a new 
respect for their job hearing about the crap that they have to deal 
with, whith all th rap concerts, and gang violence, and crime on the 
streets at night.  They could have not been happier with party, and the 
positive nature of our crowd.  Of course ,im sure that the free coffee 
and donuts helped some as well.

5.  One of thing that we like to do with all our parties is to give 
back to the comunity with each event.  Our event was a partial benefit 
and a portion of the procedes was to be donated to the bay area 
homeless alience.  We were able to raise $1000 for this organization.  
Our intention was to donate the funds and recieve some positive press 
for the rave comunity at the same time.  I know that a thousand dollard 
does not seem like a lot compared to how much money everyone ASUMES we 
made at this party, but trust me, it is quite a bit.  We would have 
been able to donate more, but a lot more people wound up going to BM, 
and leaving town, than we expected, so there realy was not any 
astronomical profit made at the party like people want to think.  
Anyways, as I was saying, the whole idea of giving back to the comunity 
was one of the reasons we wanted to do the party.  
When I heard what happened at BM to a fellow raver, Omar, A member of 
our comunity, we figured that there was no beter, or more deserving 
cause to donate the money to, so instead of giving the $1000 to the 
homeless alience, we gave Omars Mom $500, and to the Homeless Alience 
the other $500.  We wish we only had more to give, but hopefully the 
next party we will be able to generate twice that amount for the 
homless alience.  We send all our love and support to Omar and his 
family during this hard time, and extend any posible help if there is 
to be a benefit party for him.

Finaly, I just want to thank everybody who came out to this party.  
Everyone from Feel Good Entertainment wants to thank you for your 
support and trust.  Thanks to everyone that read this follow up report 
on the party, and I apoligize for my horible spelling.  

Keep it real - PLUR - Ray Vonie - Feel Good Entertainment.

I'm glad to hear it went well.  I could tell from your flyer that you 
were ernest and had learned from past problems.  Your past events have 
been enjoyable, if a little overhyped, and I hope you can continue on 
that path.  There is an important need for large, diverse parties 
in this scene.

Also, you should realize that the US (CIA) has been arming one Kurdish
faction to the hilt in the last 6 years, although the support is being
called "humanitarian aid" to congress in the hopes that people won't
notice. The real reason is that our "smart bombs" in the Desert Storm
"blitzkrieg" couldn't do the job of toppling Saddam Hussein, but an
armed internal insurrection/civil-war caused by a group of well
organized, well funded, and well-armed Kurds just might. Unfortunately,
billions of dollars have been spent and they're not doing a very
effective job of reigning in the ex CIA-imposed crony (Saddam Hussein).
However, the balance of power got thrown off enough that the faction
that the Kurdish faction we weren't arming had to ask for help from
Saddam Hussein's army. So S.H. moved his own army around within his own
country across mock-borders that have nothing to do with the borders of
his own country, and we bombed them for doing that. Now that Iraq can't
help them, the other faction of Kurds is also asking the USA for
"humanitarian aid" (aka weapons and training), and apparently, we're
considering sending it to them. Meanwhile, Turkey and Iran are getting
in on the "covert war" we're trying to fight because they're noticing a
power vacuum and they'd love to get their hands on Northern Iraq. Your
tax dollars at work here. (Did you vote for this colossal waste of
money??) Can you say Vietnam-II? Sure you can!

If you don't like this situation, you should send Bill Clinton a
message by not voting for him (Ralph Nader of the Green Party would be
a good alternative), and likewise, don't vote for Bob Dole either as
Dole has reverse-triangulated Clinton into this compromise position by
publicly calling him a "pussy." THen again, perhaps you agree with Bill
CLinton's signing of the defense-of-marriage act which denies all
states the rights to honor gay/lesbian marriages and therefore give
gay/lesbian couples the same benefits under the law that heterosexual
marriages are granted (i'm hetero myself, yet I find Clinton's signing
an act of treason against the progressives that put him in power).
Furthermore, the defense-of-marriage act is a heavy handed federal
mandate that denies states rights, even though the republicans that
asked for this law to be passed are normally staunch proponents of
limiting federal powers and granting states rights (hypocrites!)... ANd
then there's Clinton's signing of the welfare act which cuts important
health, housing and human services to the segment of society that needs
them most. Meanwhile we're spending orders of magnitude more money on
crap like arming both sides of a Kurdish civil war in the hopes that we
can topple Saddam Hussein.

THis is totally sickening. We got "democracy" in the USA like the USSR
was "communist"...  I for one refuse to vote for the lesser of two
evils (aka CLinton). That's a pathetic cop-out, especially for a
president that has completely abandoned the progressive/left that put
him in power in the first place. I will no longer tolerate his treason,
and neither should you. The lesser of two evils is not what democracy
is supposed to be about. Fact is, it won't make a shit of a difference
if the republicans win, but if there's even 10-20% voting for neither
CLinton/DOle then that will send a big fucking message to those cunts
in Washington. (yeah yeah yeah, so there's 3 supreme court justices to
be appointed -- what of Bill Clinton's recent actions makes you
confident that he'll refrain from putting in the same kind of dickweed
justices that Dole would have installed?). Democracy my ass.

WARNING WARNING POLITICS FOLLOWS

IF YOU ARE ALLERGIC TO REASONED LEFTIST DISCOURSE DELETE NOW

I am leaning heavily toward voting Ralph Nader but not at all for the
reasons you describe. This is politics, my friend. It is important,
especially in politics, to punish your enemies and reward your friends.
For all Slick Willie's (the whitehouse Willie) shortcomings, he has
been the most gay friendly president we have ever had. He has changed
an ancient and dishonorable military policy to fit more in line with
general societal morality ("don't ask, don't tell" is about where my
parents are on the whole thing). He has appointed openly gay and
lesbian people to posistions of high power in his administration.
He has supported increased funding for AIDS treatment and research.
So, while he _has_ lied, backpeddled, and generally sold down the
river gays and lesbians when political considerations made it
neccesary, he has been far from an ogre. I would give him a C-
personally. If he wasn't such a lying scumbag about it, I might
even bump him up to a C+. A low passing grade on the subject of
civil rights for lesbians and gays is the highest grade any president
ever has recieved, in my book.

Now, where he just doesn't meet the grade is in the area of basic
civil liberties. Mr. "let the FBI tap 1000000 (yes, that's one million
Virginia) phones simultaniously without judicial oversight" Clinton
can just go take a flying leap in my book. He has in numerous other
ways supported the National Security State apparatus in ways that
are unconscionable to me. Justice without liberty is a temporary state
at best. Free people will bring about justice. A powerful secret police
is not conducive to liberty, in fact it is the antithesis of it.
Democracy cannot survive without a healthy and reasoned discourse,
which depends on the free flow of ideas.

So because of this, I am voting Green. The Green's agree with me on
a bunch of other things as well, but I would consider supporting Bill
if he didn't hate the Bill of Rights so much. I bet even Bob Dole
would do a better job of defending basic liberties. Or at least a
worse job of dismantling them. He has some sort of moral compass and
the gumption and experience to not be a dupe of the NSA/CIA/FBI crowd.

To all those who got really fucked up and then proceeded to drive around
the dessert at 80 miles an hour what's it like to have blood on your
hands?

While it's pointless to go on and on about my BM experience and I will say
this: it was to big and to out of control.  Apart from that I had a great
time, took lots and lots of exceptionally fine dsangerious drugs and met
lots and lots of the kind of women that my mother used to warn me about.
The burning of the man was excellent (especially on an eighth of liberty
caps!) and I had two blinding nights at Whicked.  CCC was not bad either.  

But at the end of the day the event was disarster for most concerned to
which I say this: there have to be reasons other then scientific for the
fact that there is not a singlepiece of life out their.  Think about it!

Tristan.

Dear All;

        Tired Of That Do Nothing E-Mail Reader, Qualcomm recently released
Eudora Pro 3.* Beta for Windows 95, the Mac Version is already out.

        First of all, I think Qualcomm could have done more, but the new
version I think blows the Winsock out of what's currently available for the
Windows 95 OS; make sure you get a copy of the Beta for free at:

 http://www.qualcomm.com/ 

Because it's serious featured packed E-Mail fun. Features like automatic
spell checking once qued for delivery, yeah!!!!!!!! Dis one I know will
make all you mis-spell-ers very happy, like myself.

 Well , OK ... but ... how can you tell !!??! I'm assuming you mean a dope 
high vs. a high achieved without the help of special chemicals. BUT, the two
states look the same in many cases to other persons. 

 I guess we'll just play it safe and kick your ass if you if you look even a 
little bit in the trance zone ! God help you if we catch you smiling "for no
good reason" ! ( Anybody remember that Suicidal Tendencies song about the
guy who's just idling sitting in his room, thoughts drifting and gaze blank?
His mom sees him and accuses him of being on drugs because he's not being
a perky teen! I don't remember what the name of the song was. "Mom, I just 
want a Pepsi!").

> .... i think that each
> person needs to decide what their substance usage level is, and that we each
> need to respect that.  

 That's just good manners, seem's to me. I've luckily never been with users
who were the "forcing" type. The only time someone tried to pressure me into
doing something was at a bar - I didn't want a drink and this guy insisted
I have one ( damn ethanol heads!  :-)   <= smiley included to indicate
satirical content ). 

> ... i've just be so impressed recently by the number of
> completely sober ravers that i've hung out with that are still absolutely
> loving raving, and i decided that i want to do that, too.
 
> ....  this was my last "fucked up" rave, and harmony will be my first 
> "totally me" rave.  wish me luck, and send me love as i attempt to make this 
> transition.

 Some other things to keep in mind -

 - Have a good idea as to whether you're doing "straightedge" [ absolutley
   nothing from now on ] , or something less than your current usage but not
   total abstinence.

 - { Personal opinion coming , not an attempt to nag others to my way of
     thinking! } Try to coordinate your chemical high occasions to something
   of ritual/spiritual significance. The main use of drugs that alter mental
   states is for spiritual and medicianl use in those cultures that have a
   history of using such drugs. And even then , such use may only be by a
   subset of the culture , like shamans. Even tobacco, I think, was only used
   for special occasions by the native americans. The "get fucked up to party
   down" usage of drugs has always nagged me in a small way ( may be a 
   hangover from my Catholic grade school days ). 
    On the other hand, I think live blues and blues rock is better appreciated 
   with some alcohol inside me , so ???  

 - In times of no drugs, lower your inhibitions! 8-P !!!

And for those who like to dress uniquely and creatively, there are awesome
daily shipments to your neighborhood Salvation Army and Goodwill where you
can find the treasures of the past and make them into your individual
creative statement for today!

But you gotta promise to keep the eyes out for the amazing hats from the
60s and 70s for me, ok?

Hey I would _really_ appreciate a cc: !  :)  I was going to head out for 
the Boat Party, but it was cancelled, so now I haven't danced all 
weekend, and I really wanna *move* =)

I check email all the time - thanks!

        To all who go to parties sober (not to say every party, but most)
and get the dreaded question:

        "Yo, what are you on?"

        Here's some good responses:

        *looks at shoes* "Hmm, looks like a pair of converse hi-tops"

        "Can't...communicate... so amazing...beyond linguistic
interpretation ...uhhh...had a Twinkie about half an hour ago"

        "Some really amazing - oh wait. Hey, i'm sober! I was trancing out
so hard i forgot!"

        "No dude, it's what are you *in*" then wink cryptically.

        ;)

        have fun!

My HUGE thanx to every one of you who have been keeping me sane throughout
this long, horrible phase of my life.  It looks like i'll finally be able
to start putting dirt back INTO this hole i'm in instead of digging it
deeper!!  *BIG SIGH* Now all i have to do is get myself out of this insane
household and find a REAL roommate instead of an alien fuckwad
masquerading as one. 

thank you all once again :) i don't know what i would have done if it 
hadn't been for your love and laughter over the past few months!

exultant
pounce!

----------------------------
You know, there are many people in the country today who, through no
fault of their own, are sane.  Some of them were born sane.  Some of
them became sane later in their lives.  It is up to people like you
and me who are out of our tiny little minds to try and help these
people overcome their sanity.

 Quasi-Review of Today's Sunset ( with personal maunderings )

 After visiting some friends in San Francisco today, I drive to Richmond's
Point Molate for Sunset. I got there at about 6:55PM. Gosh, lots of folks! 
200, 300 people? 

 I don't know who was spinning as the sun went down ( a bald, beefy black
guy, about maybe late twenties or early thirties ), but his timing was 
great! He mixed that great accapella "The House That Jack Built" into
some nice house, and it seemed the perfect track to complement the traditional
enthusiasm that the Sunset crowd always shows the disappearance of the 
sun. 

 That great DJ was follwed by John Carel, and more wonderful music pumped
out to the bay! I left around 7:50 PM .

The House That Jack Built -

 This acapella has a special significance to me. I first heard it at an
early SFRaves-sponsered rave at Bonny Doone called Connection, way back
in 1992 (?). It was the morning, and I was so tired from an evening of 
doing parking area duty, doing odd chores here and there, and just being 
up until sunrise. I was sort of dragging when the DJ ( I don't even remember 
who it was then ) mixed this thing. 

 For those who've never heard it, it's like a sermon about "Jack" and the
"House" he built for everyone , "black or white, jew or gentile" , etc. 
"This is our house, and this is our house music!" Very uplifting!  

 So - now I'm cutting down on my rave attendence , and it just seems like
a great circle of some kind has closed, now that I've heard "The House
That Jack Built" again, after all this time. To whoever that DJ was 
at today's Sunset - thank you!

FOR YOUR INFORMATION???
 ----------

Subject: FW: Fwd: FW: Friendly Fire?......
Date: Wednesday, September 04, 1996 10:16AM

I just received the following account of the downing of TWA flight 800 and
thought I would share it with you.  I cannot vouch for the validity of the
information, but will admit that it is interesting.

The message came to me from a man who was Safety Chairman for the Airline
Pilots Association for many years and he is considered an expert on safety.
 He would not ever spread idle rumor.  In short, he is usually quite certain 

before saying anything!

Hang in there!  Regards >=< Dick

Subject: Friendly Fire?

The following information about TWA Fight 800 was received this afternoon:
(08-22-96 )

TWA flight 800 was shot down by a U.S. Navy guided missile ship which was in 

area W-105.  W-105 is a Warning Area off the SouthEast coast of Long Island
and is used by the military for missile firing and other military
operations.

Guided missile ships travel all over the world defending the US and they
were conducting practice firings up over the top of a Navy P-3 radar plane
who was on a Southwest heading about over the top of TWA 800.  Evidently the 

missile is suppose to go over the top of the P-3 and the accuracy of the
missile is being measured by instrumentation in the P-3.

There was a USAir flight coming from the Southeast descending towards
 Providence, RI that had been cleared to 21,000 feet and the TWA 800
aircarft was restricted to 13,000 feet.  The air traffic controller
requested the USAir flight to turn on his landing lights with the idea that
TWA might see his lights and identify him.  At that point, he would clear
the TWA flight to continue his climb.

The P-3 was a non-beacon target (transponder OFF) flying southwest in the
controlled airspace almost over TWA 800 and made NO calls to ATC.  After the 

explosion, he continued his flight to the west and then called ATC and asked 

if they would like him to turn around and assist with the "accident!"

You will remember that the first announcement about this accident came from
the Pentagon.  The spokesman mentioned that they were sending the Navy to
the crash site.  They immediately sent a Navy Captain who was replaced the
next day by an Admiral.  That Admiral is still on the scene.

The FBI has conducted at least 3,000 eyewitness interviews and the NTSB has
not been able to be a part of these interviews not have any access to the
contents of them.  Some of those eyewitnesses reported seeing lights.
  Those were probably the landing lights of the USAir plane.

It has been a cover-up from the word go.  The NTSB is there in name ONLY.
All announcements made by Mr. Bob Francis say absolutely nothing and notice
that the FBI is always standing beside or behind Mr. Francis and it would
appear that his job is to make sure that nothing is said that would give
away "THE BIG SECRET!"

It is time to end this farce and tell the public the real truth as to what
happened to TWA 800.

My source shall remain my own but the above information is true and I
believe it will all become known soon.  Now that all of you know the real
truth.

That DJ is Bone from Detroit. He had me hooked from the street as I got to
Origin at four. He's in town for the week and will be playing at Roots and
Nikita (I would verify, tho) He was hanging during Simon's set and seemed to
be in a great mood. I missed Sunset but I have a feeling we'll be seeing more
of him out here soon.

Origin had some great music going off and the location was new and just the
way a warehouse rave should be. Great visuals, plenty of fresh air and clear
sky, and thundering bass driving you on...

I have said this before and I will say it again, albeit more politely this
time (and sorry if there were any feelings hurt last time). Various people,
through either incredible niavete or maliciousness, will say things that
will arouse your suspicion on this list. In my opinion, the best response
is none. In a list with 450 subscribers, it is safe to assume that there
is one cop, or at least one "good citizen." Don't be stupid. Don't say
stupid things (I have violated this one at least a couple of times...).

An ancient and powerful way to break up a community is by sowing the seeds
of mistrust. Let's not go around trying to guess "who's the phed" or any
other such silly game. Please use common sense.

If you really want more of my advice, email me and I will tell you more
what I think about this. On the topic of information security and all that.

Speaking of clinton's lameness w/r/t supporting government invasions into 
privacy, here's some interesting info on an upcoming conference where 
government wiretapping issues are being discussed. The keynotes peaker is 
Ralph Nader, who also happens to be the Green Party presidential candidate. 
Take a good look at where Nader stands w/r/t real freedom against the lamer
i-got-mine-so-you-get-yours-i-buy-my-freedom-with-my-personal-wealth
libertarian candidates, or the dangerous-megalomaniacal-salesman-from-hell
Ross Perot (is he really Bob Dobbs' evil long lost brother??).

Given that Big Brother will be watching us all very soon (if not
already), I suggest you all become very learned in the ways of computer
cryptography. Geeks may want to study Bruce Schneier's "Applied
Cryptography, Second Edition" (published by Wiley) and pick up a copy
of PGP, plus get Simson and Stafford's "Practical Unix Security"
(published by O'Reilley). Others will just have to wait for some cool
easy-to-use software to come out to help you maintain your
constitutional rights to free speech and freedom of assembly in
cyberspace.

                                                      presents a conference on

                            COMMUNICATIONS UNLEASHED

                    What's At Stake? Who Benefits? How To Get Involved!

                                                         OCTOBER 19-20, 1996

                                      Georgetown University - Washington, DC

    Co-sponsored by the Communication, Culture, and Technology program of the
                 Graduate School of Arts and Sciences at Georgetown University

SATURDAY, OCTOBER 19

KEYNOTE SPEAKER - RALPH NADER (invited); consumer advocate and
founder of the Center for the Study of Responsive Law; Green Party
presidential candidate

THE COMMUNICATIONS TSUNAMI - In today's world of corporate mergers
and the mega-packaging of services, what's at stake for consumers
and who will represent their views? What is the meaning of "public
interest" in the new digital environment? Panelists will examine
the ramifications and effects of the Telecommunications Act in such
critical areas as universal service, the opening of local exchanges
to competition, the provision of fair pricing rules, and the
stewardship of the dazzling array of emerging broadband services.

TOOLKITS FOR ACTIVISTS - Media giants and merger-mania dominate the
public dialogue on communications issues. How can activists at the
local, state, and national levels develop an effective voice in the
currently one-sided debate over changes in the marketplace and the
regulatory environment? How can community-based organizations use
the Internet as a tool for online organizing, enhancing public
interest campaigns and increasing the efficiency of their internal
communications?

THE INTERNET: COMMERCIALIZATION, GLOBALIZATION, AND GOVERNANCE - The
accelerating commercialization and globalization of the Internet
raises new and divisive problems of governance and control that
will profoundly affect the future of the net and all of its users.
What is the outlook in key areas like pricing schemes, access to
information and services, and Internet telephony?

INFORMATION RIGHTS - New information technologies and the policy
responses to them raise many critical issues related to information
rights on the Internet. Panelists will discuss these topics in
detail, including the Communications Decency Act and freedom of
speech online, copyright protection, and threats to privacy from
the collection of personal information online.

COMPUTERS AND ELECTIONS: RISKS, RELIABILITY, AND REFORM - There are
widespread, legitimate concerns about the accuracy, integrity, and
security of computer-generated vote totals. Panelists will explore
the technical, social, and political origins of these concerns
within the context of today's little-scrutinized election system.
They will also make recommendations for changes in the areas of
technology, election law, accountability, and oversight.

SUNDAY, OCTOBER 20 will feature WORKSHOPS on: communications access
and the consumer; broadcasting and mass media; civic networking;
media tactics and outreach; Internet legal issues; and using the
Internet for political action. The 1996 CPSR Annual Meeting will
take place Sunday afternoon. All conference attendees are welcome.

Center (marked on the map as ICC). This building is not accessible
by car. Participants have several choices:

1- Take the blue or orange line Metro to Rosslyn and walk over the
Key Bridge to campus (probably about a 15-20 minute walk). There is
also a Georgetown blue and gray shuttle bus that runs from the
Rosslyn (and Dupont Circle) metro station to the campus.
2- Take a taxi to the main campus entrance at the corner of 37th
Street and O Streets, NW.
3- Take one of the many city buses that stops at the main campus
entrance to Georgetown, 37th and O Streets, NW. 4-
Drive and park in the Campus Parking Lot #3 (accessible either off
M Street, just west of the Key Bridge, or at the end of Prospect
Street) which is free on the weekends. This is the lot with the
large P in the lower left-hand corner of the map. Participants can
then walk up the driveway and around to the ICC building. Signs
will be posted for your convenience.

Yeah, why is it that some of my best rave experiences always happen in that
sweaty, dangerous hole? Perhaps overcoming our environment together brings
out the best in us. Perhaps there is a psychedlic residue left in the place,
due to so many good parties. Perhaps I am just a freak ;-)

Yes, I understand that. I was just making a point that ther ARE people 
out there who would like to see this type of community gone all together, 
and that if anyone were to aid in his request they could be putting 
themselves in danger. But I understand your point, and being new to this 
community in particular, I thought it was something that should be addressed.

Hey Austin,

Just spoke with Theron K. the other day. He wanted me to publicly
apologize for you not getting your tape. Seems he lost his account and
and didn't have any hard copies of your address.

So send me your address, and I'll get the info to him so he can send you
his new tape, which is MUCH better than his last one. It's 60 min in
length, with all the tracks coming from Hunab Ku. Nice to hear some
smooth clean psychedelic trance that is actually MIXED!

BSP: Theron's selling his new tape for $7. Anyone wanting a copy, you
can mail him at:

Theron K.
2000 Broadway #1004
SF, CA 94115     

Again, apologies for the confusion, Austin. 

later...

Jonas

	Hey hey :)

        a few things (which everyone probably knows): going to a rave and
doing e are two separate things. The two definitely affect each other, but
they can be mututally exclusive. I was blissfully unaware of e for my first
whole year of raving (hmm is that kind of an oxymoron?).

        second: check out http://www.ecstasy.org for information about
everything you wanted to know but were afraid to ask (or were told complete
BS).  This site *is* put together by someone who is definitely not a "just
say no" type, but i still find the info pretty balanced.

        Stay safe, stay happy! :)

	Good morning/evening/afternoon lovely people :)

	A friend of mine (not on sfraves) is currently trying to start up a
small business and was wondering if any of you could help him out.

	He wants to start something up but doesn't have a ton of $$ for
legal counsel so i told him i'd ask if there were any law students here, or
if anyone knew of the policies at any Bay area Universities wherein he'd be
able to get a bit of free/cheap legal counsel w/r/t starting and
registering a small business.

	If anyone has any info, please email me privately and i'll fwd the
messages to him.

	Thanks and have an awesome day :)

Is anyone going to MAD tonite? Sunset was just too short (car troubles

So does anyone know who will be spinning tonight?

I still have a couple dozen Harmony tickets...

If any of you are in SF area (SF, Marin, East Bay) please make arrangements
to come by and pick yours up from me. I'm sure Greg would rather me give
him the $$$ back rather than a bunch of unsold tickets, anyway... :-)

7000 people x $18 a piece = $126,000

Wow a $125,000 budget thats quite a bit!  Some of us can multiply you know.
If your numbers of attendance are true looks like you might try to budget
a little better next time.

Greetings everybody! 
Beautiful People was exactly that. A warehouse full of beautiful people.
All the people I met there, including some people that i haven't seen in
months, were glowing with positivity and goood vibes. The air was thick
with energy  ( not to mention other stuff... all good though!) I was
especially thankful for the huge fans right in front of the speakers.
Dancing in front of the breeze took me on an aural / sensory journey to
a luscious tropical island. Those of you who have seen the flyers for
Fantasy Island will know what I am talking about. I had a hard time
deciding whether to continue dancing or to chill out and hang out with
all the super friendly people in the chill out room. Luckily I was able
to spend quality time in both rooms. Good visuals, especially on the
screen behind the D.J. Excellent set by Moonpup (I think it was Moonpup
anyway) There were so many moments throughout the night when one person
in either the chill out room or the steps or elsewhere would say
something that seemed to echo the thoughts of everybody else in that
vicinity. Confirms my telepathic beleiefs. Greetings to all the people
we met (we are Dhiren, Ben, Mike, and Eric). These are the only names
that I can remember (excuse my memory , the rest of you) : Demi
(Debbie?), Rachel from Seattle, John K, Jesse, Marja, Anita, Andy (the
man tuned to the right frequency for that special radio station in the
air!!!!).  Also hi to all the fellow Burning Man veterans I met there.
It was fun trading stories about BM. 
 Well thank you all for making our experience heavenly! Hope to see you
on Saturday at Harmony if we can still get tickets. If anyone has any
info about the ticket availability scenario in the south bay, we would
appreciate a message. 
Thank you all. 
Until next time  PLUR
			Dhiren and Ben

"Budget" probably includes pay checks for employees and crew, no?
$1000 left over for donation?
Or did I miss something?  (I signed on a bit late to-day.)

Hello everyone,

    Harmony tix are still availible at Housewares and Solid Grooves. If 
the stores don't have any today, there will be more on the way 
tomorrow!! We have plenty left, so don't worry, but you might want to 
get them fast so you don't get dissapointed!! (You don't want to miss 
this one!!!!)


Peace,

Greg :)

Also, please don't mail in your money any more. The cut off date has 
arrived. And to those of you who mailed in your money but did not 
receive your tix, the are coming so hold tight. We fell a little behind 
because I had to go to Reno last week. :( But I am back and getting 
things on the ball again, so the will be there!!!

Should have been no paychecks, if there were. If this were a benefit,
then everyone should have worked for free (that may not have been the
intent of the party, though).

$125,000 is a lot of money. I don't see what they could have possibly
spent all of that on, and I feel that there could have been much more
proceeds given to charity (every little bit helps, of course). I
always thought that "proceeds" meant all profits, not profits left
over after everyone gets their cut.

Hello everyone,

    Well, we can't thank you enough for making this last BP a great 
one!! We apologize for using ACME, but once again, I had to go to Reno 
at the last minute and did not have a chance to get the original space 
all lined up. But I thank my wonderful roomee, Matt, for at least 
hooking up the ACME. It totally worked for what we wanted this party to 
be, so we are all happy with it. 

    There were a few things at BP that just really hit me hard. First, 
of course, Omar. It was very different throwing a party and not having 
him there helping us set up. I felt a deep hole in the production. Many 
times during the set up, I just could not control myself and my 
emotions. I would find myself in a corner of the ACME (eeuuww gross!!) 
just in the most intense depressions. It really sucked!!! But 
everything ended up fine in the end, but there was just something 
really strong not there. 

    As the night wore on I began to feel more comfortable with the 
situation. I felt like Omar could feel our energy, and was with us in 
spirit. It was very moving, and extremely positive. I just new that 
there was something good going on!!!

    With all of the dreams about Omar that our family has been having, 
we know that he will be ok. With all of the positive energy that all of 
us are creating, we know that he will be ok. And I thank every single 
one of you for your support, love, prayers, and energy. You guys are 
the best!!!!

    Last Friday, we got a lot of donations towards Omar. His mother is 
really happy to know that all of Omar's "raver" friends are really 
understanding and helping with this situation. It really makes her feel 
good. But anyways a BBBIIIIGGGG thank yu to everyone who donated their 
$ as well as their energy to Omar!!! And regarding his condition: His 
brain swelling has gone down, which is fabulous!!! 3/4 of his body 
reacts to pain, which is a big step up from 1/2!!!! I think he is 
pulling out of this! As soon as I find out anymore info, I will post it 
to the list. Stay tooned!!

Peace,

Greg :)

I think Wayne meant nothing furry or leafy lives there. There's not
enough life on the playa to really consider it inhabited.

Although I did find a single plant growing out of the ground on the
way to the rave camp. Bizarre.

It wasn't a benefit.  The goal was to donate "a portion of the proceeds," 
as they say, to charity.  They chose to donate $1000, and further chose 
to split that 50-50 between the initial choice of charity and the Omar 
fund.

That, at any rate, is what the message said.

7000 people x $18 a piece = $126,000

Wow a $125,000 budget thats quite a bit!  Some of us can multiply you know.
If your numbers of attendance are true looks like you might try to budget
a little better next time.

	Budgeting for something this big is a totally different story 
than budgeting for the smaller parties when someone owns a rig, a piece 
of land can be rented or used for little or no money, and most 
importantly, there are no cops to pay for (I remember the quote for one 
of Martin's parties being something like $8000, that 2/3 of the budget 
right there). While I do not mean to defend "Feel Good Entertainment" as 
I am sure they can do that themselves if they cared to or felt they 
needed to, I think that many of us forget that big productions cost big 
bucks because, for the most part, they have to be done by the book to a 
larger extent which means permits, security, insurance, blah blah blah... 
On top of which, you have high cost djs which charge up to $1000 for a 
set (although I don't know if any of them were around), light techs who 
want money, sound companies which charge quite a bit of money to send a 
sound guy to watch levels all night and do setup and teardown - things 
smaller parties put on by a group of people who own all that stuff do not 
have to pay for... 

	So, the producers probably made a couple grand for themselves
which if that's your sole income, is just bearly going to pay rent and
food for the next three months while you scramble to get the next party
together... So, to some its a way of paying the bills. To others, its just
what we do... Hell, if someone wanted to support me for throwing the type
of parties I help out with, I would probably dump my job and put on free
outdoor ambient into a wee bit of house into Christen Vogel/Niel
Lanstromesque techno into gabber into trance into dub into ambient parties
for anyone who wanted to come out and dance about with me... Any
volunteers ;)

Dear Friends & Family,

	I agree with James and Niels that Clinton does not deserve the
votes of gays and their allies, not by a long shot.
	People are always dismissive of gays who vote Republican as being
in serious denial, but one can make the same case of any non-heterosexual
person planning to vote for Clinton.
	Bill Clinton's record on gay issues includes:

-signing into law the ban on queers in the military.

-refusing to sign a Friend of the Court brief to oppose anti-gay Amendment
	2 from Colorado before the Supreme Court.

-opposes equal treatment for same-sex marriages.

-signing into law sex-phobic, homophobic, and AIDS-phobic censorship of
	the Internet in spite of the promise he made during his oath of
	office to uphold and defend the Constitution.

-diverting AIDS research funds away from finding a cure and towards
	efforts to help Glaxo-Welcome Company market AZT, a drug
	considered by many to do more harm than good.

-signing legislation which will throw HIV-positive people out of the
	military if it is enforced.

-keeping HIV-positive Haitians in concentration camps until the ACLU
	forced him to abandon that policy.

-refusing to attend the 1993 March on Washington either in person or by
	video.  All he did was send what the Los Angeles Times accurately
	described as a "tepid" letter of support.

-scheduling a "historic" meeting with gay and lesbian leaders for a time
	when he knew he was going to be out of town.

-firing Surgeon General Jocelyn Elders in part for her perfectly rational
	comments about AIDS prevention on World AIDS Day and for her pro-queer,
	pro-safer sex views.

-surrounding himself with homophobes, as illustrated by the incident when
	a member of the White House staff would not touch a person with
	AIDS before putting on a glove.

	While it is true that Clinton is probably the most gay-friendly
President in this country's history, that is not the standard by which he
should be judged.  Considering how much more accepted and open homosexuals
are now than in the past, and that this trend has had a significant impact
on our national discourse even during the past four years, anything less
from the President would be shocking.
	If both established political parties insist on maintaining
anti-gay policies and elevating anti-gay politicians, then gays and their
supporters should do the right thing and vote for third party candidates.
	The Libertarian Party has a platform that treats gays as full and
equal citizens, and is not afraid to take unpopular positions on their
behalf, such as unequivocal support of gay marriage rights. 
	The above information on Clinton's record was taken from the
newsletter of Libertarians For Gay And Lesbian Concerns (#31, Summer
1996). 

My computer tells me that on Sun, 8 Sep 1996, James Ausman shared (in
part):

Acme wherehouse??? I think i was there before. I remeber it being
sooooooooooo sweaty that you'd slip on the floor when you walked. If you sat
down, whatever touched the floor would be stained dark brown, and the
bathrooms were the nastiest steam room I've ever seen. I started to walk
into the bathrooms, and it was sooo hard to breathe the XXX humid air that I
had to leave.
     And it stinks sometimes.

(Private note)

Excellent post Brenda!  Thanks so much for expressing this here. Together
with Love, we can overcome obsticles which have kept Humanity imprissoned
wrongly for so very long.  As a true family, we could very easily seek to
leave old, selfish and negative ways far behind and let us each venture
forward and upward and outward.  Seperate, but also as One.  Honestly.  

Share Love and shine!

I had an interesting thought about the subject of greed.  

Who is greedy in the following?  

The person who has made $1 million and donates $1 thousand to charity, or
the person who has not made $1 million, but demands that the person who did
make it donates far more than only $1 thousand?  Just a passing thought...

Subject: the buzz on Mega-Buzz
Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk


I've been thinking about this Mega-Buzz party a little bit lately, and
I wanted to share some thoughts I've had about it. Being anti-massive
(some of my worst nights have been spent suffering with mean people
and paying far too much for water and admission), my first thought was
to immediately jump in and dog the whole idea of Mega-Buzz one. I
really didn't care for the flyers and the huge amount of promotion
(huge by underground standards).  I even received a flyer randomly in
the mail (???).

But while, true, they are commercial and perhaps appealing to some
sort of trendiness, they do expose people to the rave scene. And for a
lot of folks, it's just a novelty, and they'll probably never go
back. Or maybe they will, but maybe just to other massives. In any
event, I think we (and myself included) are always so worried about
perserving the "underground"ness of this culture that we feel that
events like Mega-Buzz are invasive, and perhaps even a mockery of what
we feel raving is all about.

But then, some people probably got exposed to something they never
experienced before: the pounding of techno, the pounding of the dance
floor, and the pounding of their hearts as they raved until
daybreak. Maybe some joined SFRaves after MB1. Maybe some of those
will discover some of the smaller parties that many of us love so
much. Maybe a few of those will stick with it because they too love it
so much. And maybe some of those people would become a welcome new
part of the family (or one of the families). So maybe it's like a
the trickle-down theory; a little bit of raver Reaganomics.

Also, I did feel a little funny about how much was donated to charity
vs. how much was raked in at the door. But someone did post about how
much has to be spent for large, fully permitted party. And I guess I can
see it. It's probably of the same order of magnitude as a large concert
at the shoreline or something. If the promoters did make a few bucks
out of it, I guess it's not so bad, considering how much time and
energy had to be invested in such a huge event.

hmmm... I'm still on the fence.

Okay, the Acme may be a groovy (and apparently cheap) space, but the
ventilation is just piss-poor. So instead of going through hell
whenever a party is thrown there, why not do something about it? I for
one had a wonderful time at both BP :) and Hallucination a couple of
weeks back, except for the fact that it was just too damn hot and sweaty
to dance (almost passed out at Hallucination).

So does anyone know anything about ventilation, or does anyone have
any extra fans to contribute to any future parties there? I for one
would be willing to donate some fans and some time to set up adequate
ventilation. Or are the number of fans limited by power consumption
or any added sound system noise? Just wondering why we can't make
the conditions better there.

"Acme Solutions"... didn't realize it, but it sounds like a Silcon
Valley startup.

And what of the person that makes a $1 millon dollars and makes a big 
deal of donating $1 thousand as if it is strain?

When my B.S. meter goes off(your mileage may vary):

1) When anyone feels the need to tell you how great their party was, without
   party goers doing so.

2) Talking about the "old skool" ravers(whoever they are.)

3) Promoters playing up "what they are giving back to the scene/charity" 
   when it represents an insignificant portion of their revenue stream.

Think about it for a minute. What if everyone had eschewed the party, and 
instead donated their money to Omar or the homeless group or whomever. 
Instead of $1000 dollars, they would be looking at $100,000+ dollars.

That said, I like to be part of/contribute to parties that are "for 
something." But please if you are going to wave a flag around and feel 
the need to talk about what generous people you are, make sure that a 
*significant* portion of your profits are going to that cause. Otherwise, 
it sounds like cheap opportunism.

My first Harmony party ever.  First reaction is WOW!  The sound system was
incredible, the trance(?) mixes were still reverberating in my brain like
a bolt of thunder a day after the party.  The vibe was wonderful most of
the time...my friend John danced almost five hours straight.  Woohoo!
Wit beats this tight, he was glad to shed 10 pounds during the night :)
Which leds to my second reaction...anyone have an oxygen tank?  ACME
really needs a few more windows.  The space at 150 was much more
comfortable even considering the smaller size. 

Warning---negativity, what can improve in the future.

Some things i saw downstairs really bugged.  Some people cutting lines by
the stairs, gangstas standing in the corners.  Maybe some of you can tune
it out, but I think ACME's becoming a bit too well known.  Just a
feeling...

Hope everyone has fun this weekend, I'll be home...studying.  Maybe i'll
dance the marcarena on the front porch or something :)

Peace,
Sen

Dear Friends & Family,

	I too am on the fence.  Both Wayne and Black Adder also made some
good points for and against taking Feel Good Entertainment at face value.
Without actual data, there's not much we can do but speculate, and that's
exactly how nasty and damaging rumours get started.  There is however, one
way to nip them in the bud.
	I've said it before: Every promoter who cares about building our
community and is trying to be upfront and honest can easily prove it by
posting a detailed breakdown of their party's revenues and expenses to the
list.  
	Ideally this would include names of individuals, companies, and
organizations and how much each received, not simply "Lighting - $200, DJs
- $500," etc.  It would also be interesting to know how many people got in
free or at reduced cost, and their names and affiliations.  The number of
non-paying guests, which can be quite high, certainly factors into the
bottom line of a production.
	The entire rave community would benefit by the open exchange of
such information, and trust among its members would be advanced.  If, for
example, MegaBuzz1's take in fact exceeded costs by only $1000, it would
be unfortunate if their reputation was damaged for lack of disclosure of
this fact.  And if they had to pay $20,000 in overtime extortion money to
the police in order to hold the event, this is something that we all
should be aware of and take into account.  Other promoters in
particular might be spared a lot of grief by knowing this before trying to
put on a similar event.   
	As a nation, we demand financial disclosure from our candidates
for high office.  It makes sense that ravers should request the same from
the "leaders" of our community, those with whom we trust our money and on
whose good intentions and integrity we rely when attending a party.	

PLURally yours,

from Feel Good Entertainment. So what do you think? Is this something
that we have a right to know, or do think they have a right to keep it
confidential? Obviously, there were some questions regarding the
authenticity of the event, and it would be nice to know some facts
instead of spreading nasty rumors.

oh well; enough ranting, back to raving.

sleepy,
Steve

no doubt about that.
but on the other hand, these shows really are the only way to subtly trickle 
and drip some education into exactly those peoples half rotten brains.
if they weren't so stupid people wouldn't watch them and because they 
watch there's a channel you can reach them through.

i once saw one of these shows that had little *underage* *hiv-positive* 
*single* *mothers* in it and it was touching to watch how the madhouse 
crowd of spectators was turned into a warm, friendly audience of interested,
caring people. of course this is sensationalism, but i still think it was a 
good piece of education about aids and against aids phobia, and i think 
the aim justifies the means in that case.  i think you probably can't do 
without manipulating and tearjerking and playing with emotions if you 
want to get your message across and sticking in those peoples minds. 

i don't quite see though why the day time tv watching population needs 
to be educated about the rave thing now, i personally don't really care, 
and i think somebody who's representing the scene in that kind of 
tv show surrounding is very very vulnerable, especially if she's trying to 
convince people about the higher values of raving that go beyond 'i just like 
it period'. they might give her the 'my child died from ecstasy' thing 
and whatnot, you never know, so good luck.
anyway it will be interesting to get a glimpse into the inside of these 
shows and i really look forward to reading about leeza 
snorting coke backstage and all the other neat crap.

	Certainly they have a *right* to keep it confidential.  But as
columnist William Safire so rightly put it, having the right to do
something does not make doing it right.  Perhaps someone from Feel Good
would like to comment on why they think nondisclosure in this case is a
good thing?
	My feeling is that if a promoter refuses to talk about budget, I
will retain a certain degree of skepticism, regardless of what else he or
she might say.  What on earth does "proprietary information" have to do
with the spirit of raving anyway?

Let the data flow...

Hi all !

I'm looking for the best D.J.'s in the area, just to see if everyone agrees
on who's the "best" around worth being launched internationally.
By "best", I don't mean just being able to beatmatch two vinyls, but really
taking the art of mixing to higher spheres !...

                                    Looking forward to your answers,

                                    Topher.

In the last days of thinking about raving to gain clarity (so I can express
it succinctly and appropriately on TV) ... I had an image of raving and how
many of us start raving and progress  ....

Imagine a spiral.  On the outside edge of that spiral, the circle is the
biggest and it is the easiest to see if you are approaching it.  That is
what massive parties are about ... they are the outer edge, the most easily
accessible, the biggest outer edge of what this scene is about .. and that
edge is where many people enter the spiral.

Some people stop there because they are, for some reason, not meant to
continue inward.  Maybe they don't like the music, the atmosphere, the
people.  That's ok, because it's not for everyone.

Many, though, continue inward on that spiral.  Now you are fully inside the
circle, where the circle is smaller and closer to the essence.  These are
the mid-sized parties, still promoted to the world at large, but drawing
people who know more about the scene.

At the center of that spiral is the core, the smallest of the underground
parties, the groups of friends that know they belong in that circle, not
because it's some exclusive secret, but simply because they belong there,
and they welcome you into that circle.

Now step back again and look at the whole spiral... and remember that all
the points of the spiral are connected, and without any of them, the spiral
would not exist.

Massive parties are not for everyone, but they are a first step for many,
and I'm sure many of us started on that path to the heart of raving at the
outside of that spiral.  I know many of you have told me that your first
parties were massives, that you might not choose to go to now, but that
were perfect for you at that time, because they were the first step.

As far as donating proceeds from a massive.... Frankly, I have no idea what
it costs to put on a big party, but I can guarantee that there's a lot of
financial risk taken, and I never begrudge someone making money from doing
something that makes so many people happy.

I don't know about you, but I didn't give $1000 to the homeless and Omar
this week.  I wish I did.  Was that donation proportionate to the profits?
To be honest, they didn't have to give anything ... it wasn't a fundraiser
event, and there were no advance promises to my knowledge.  So it appears
to be a gift freely given from money made by throwing a party ... a party
that sounds like it was a really great experience for a lot of people, and
the financial benefit was shared.

Who's more generous?  The millionaire who gives $1000 or the poor person
who gives his last $5?  The poor person is surely more generous, but in the
real world, that thousand bucks from the millionaire goes a hell of a lot
farther, eh?

Rambling again....  Leslie

Hi all!

 Unnhhhh! I'm still tired! BP was a lot of work and I loved every minute 
of it!!!!  =)

 Jess and I get to Acme at about 3pm; seems like the rest of the crew was 
also just getting there. First thing is to fabricate a lighting area for 
me and my slides ( as I was there early I had choice of setup position). 
so I go up on the display refrigarator (via ladder) with the control 
equipment and run all light cables throughout the room. Also shift a 
cabinet around and hang curtains to create work/storage room for me and 
Jess. Watch parachute go up and encourage crew to hang it high so as not 
to interfere with slide projection. Most of the work done is supervised 
by me rather than done by me due to my bad shoulder.

 Watch as the crew does a tremendous job of cleaning up the shit at Acme; 
trash cans that are overflowing, sweeping the floor clean of metal burrs 
and fragments, making the chill space more homey, creating the beautiful 
altar to Omar.

 At this point I need to thank Jess; this woman is the SHIT!!!!! If not 
for her I never would have been able to give the kind of show that I did 
to all of you. Not only that but her help afterwards was beyond 
monumental and she has the patience of a saint. THANK YOU JESS (smack!!)

 The sound system was a little late in arriving but we started pretty 
close to on time. the music was great all night long with hilights coming 
from Brandon (incredible hard, progressive house!!) and Greg. I, of 
course, had to dance during Greg's set. While there was a spiral galaxy 
above and behind him, Greg looked like he was at the controls of an 
interplanatary communications system, tuning in some alien music. Moonpup 
was just spinning the wierdest collection of stuff I heard in a while! 
Some of it was _really_ fun.

 I had a lot of fun playing with all the lights and the slides!!  =) I 
wish that I could have had some of you play with the lights also but the 
setup wouldn't allow for that :(

 The crowd was as delightful as always; hello to everyone I saw that 
night. What made this party really special for me was seeing all the help 
people were offering. It is so hard to throw a great party and the help 
was greatly appreciated The after party circle was very nice also.


Peace all,

Ran

Hey, hey, hey!
I was just responding to the kid who was busting your chops on
overbudgeting.  I don't know how much y'all spent or made, and frankly
don't care. (Nor is it anyone's business, tho it does make for interesting
speculation for bored people with computers :)  I was just suggesting that
before he slam your business smarts, that most people who take the time and
energy to throw a party are (if they've done a bit of business research)
are going to remember that their time and effort is worth something, and
will probably include paying employees and crew as part of their budget.

Catch me next time,

I think the fact that they gave anything is a good thing. However, after 
reading a grandiose statement about how the are about "giving back to the 
community" I become more skeptical that this isn't just a PR move.

Keep in mind that the millionaire in this analogy is asking you to keep 
him a millionaire, in part because of all the good and generous things 
he is doing. Wouldn't you then be in your best interest to consider the 
amount of money you are giving vs. the amount of money that is going to 
the cause, whatever that cause may be? To me, 8/10 of 1% just doesn't put 
the millionare in the philanthropist category by default.

Sorry, have to respond again on this one ....  and I for one apologize to
MegaBuzz One for taking shit after giving a generous and unsolicited
donation to two very good causes.  That sucks!!!  I bet next time he'll
think twice about posting anything to SFRaves.

And all this stuff about "nipping nasty rumors in the bud" ????  Maybe I
missed something, but I never saw any nasty rumors about this company or
promoter... all I've seen is criticism AFTER THE FACT when he posted about
his party.  Perhaps some of the voices on here are confusing this promoter
with someone else?  Misinformation can be VERY damaging, and it is up to
each of us to make sure we know what we're talking about when we start
these threads that feed these rumors.

Where is it written in the official rules and regulations of raving that
anyone who wants to give a privately funded and organized party has to open
their personal financial records to anyone who asks?  (Maybe the same place
it's written that anyone who throws big parties is an evil moneygrubber?)

Now, if someone said ... "this is a benefit for ...." and charged hella
money or took up a collection and we suspected that the money was going
elsewhere ... that is different.  And if someone charges hella money and
doesn't deliver (djs don't show up, party gets busted and no refunds
forthcoming, etc.), that's different too.

But when a private promoter puts their money on the line and puts on a big
party, and provides all the stuff he said he'd deliver to the people who
chose to go, I'm not sure how someone not involved thinks it's their right
to challenge that promoter to, to quote:

>posting a detailed breakdown of their party's revenues and expenses to the

Please! that's ridiculous, you're asking someone to give proprietary
information  to  450 strangers who all have an opinion that's most likely
based on a total lack of information on costs and logistics, and frankly
very often is based on a lack of experience with big dollar business at
all!

And yes, that's *proprietary*... that means private ... I think we are
confusing the spirit of raving with something else.

Now, about sharing information with other promoters (i.e. cost for police,
other negotiating points, etc) .. I wouldn't be surprised if that's done
anyway, depending in the nurturance of those personal relationships,
because when promoters treat each other with respect, we all win, and they
know that (at least most of them).

This whole thing makes me sad ... instead of seeing something very positive
in a situation -- which is that a promoter of a large party is donating
money from his pocket (yes, that's HIS pocket, not yours, sorry, folks) to
good causes -- insteadee is being openly roasted and lambasted in a public
forum.

Promoters aren;t "candidates for office" ... they are people who put the
work in to put on parties ...

I suggest that every person who belives a promoter should disclose
everything throw a big and expensive party on their own -- make sure you
put $$thousands out of your own pocket first -- and then post *every* cost
detail to the list.  Then you too will  likely be the target of criticism
that it wasn't enough, you were greedy and underhanded, etc, and if you
were a REAL raver it wouldn't have cost so much, etc.

We've got to get over this "if it makes a profit, it can't be a rave"
mentality, because it perpetuates this weird "money bad, poverty good"
ethic.  Hey, I wish everyone could make a living doing something that
brings joy to people's lives... and if I can make it happen for me, I will!

Love, Leslie

p.s.  my expenses for popsicles at Sunset was exactly $8.64 this week, and
$6.98 for the time before that ... didn't accept a cent for them.  Feel
better?  And the Leeza show isn't paying anything but my expenses (wish
they would, my car payment is late!)

Many, though, continue inward on that spiral.  Now you are fully inside the

I tend to think that the spiral dosen't go down to one circle but branches
into several circles...  At times you can even see these circles. They're not
more exclusive than each other but they house certian beliefs and ethics that
accept thoses that match such criteria.  I go to varied parties and feel that
sense of belonging @ them some moreso than others.

oi, mad was good last night. what did folks think of jane? i'd heard her 
at b-man and vowed not to miss a single set. an unmistakable series of 
tracks woke me up out of a pre-party nap one night (our camp was a mile 
away) and had me biking at top speed to wicked to try to catch the last 
few seconds of black dog's vir2l (thanks for playing it last night, joe). 

anyway, she's in town until oct 9th and is looking for places to spin. i 
know *someone* has a booking for her. just make sure to let me know, so i 
can be there...

jmar!

Right on!  I agree.  All I see are people putting this promoter down for
something that they didn't even go to.  He delivered what he said so whats
the big fuss?  I'm tired of hearing so many complaints.  Why is everybody
always analyzing shit so deeply?  Come on people!  Lighten -up.  Promoters
don't have to say how much they make or what they want to do with their
profit, unless the party is specifically meant for a benefit.  And I
believe the promoter stated what he gave towards two good causes.
Something is better than nothing.  So be happy, and don't worry about the
little shit.

Hope everybody is having a great Tuesday.

I'm off for a bike ride on my 1hr lunch.  To bad I forgot my walkman! =(

Goodday everyone,

Never heard Jane before, but this woman really threw down some killer
tracks last night. It was a similar feeling from hearing Moonpup's
set; not the same kind of music, but it was really cool to hear what
was going on from the other side of the pond. She spun a wide variety
of music, and it was very cool to be exposed to something other than
the SF sound for a night.

Exactly what I was hinting at in my first post...here are quotes from the 
promoter about MegaBuzz One that put my tongue in action (or my hands as 
the case may be)...

(from the original post)

	"Tickets are only $18 in advance.  We did everything humanly 
possible to make them this inexpensive.  This is something we are trying to do to 
show people that large parties do not have to cost a fortune.  This is 
a realy good price, because you are getting more than 3 large parties 
for the price of less than one.   We are also donating a portion of our 
procedes to the Bay Area Homless Alience.  Just think- your partying 
will help the less fortunate this winter.   We encourage everybody to 
buy tickets and please arive early to help set the tone and the mood 
for the evening. "

	"5.  One of thing that we like to do with all our parties is to 
give back to the comunity with each event.  Our event was a partial benefit 
and a portion of the procedes was to be donated to the bay area 
homeless alience.  We were able to raise $1000 for this organization.  
Our intention was to donate the funds and recieve some positive press 
for the rave comunity at the same time.  I know that a thousand dollard 
does not seem like a lot compared to how much money everyone ASUMES we 
made at this party, but trust me, it is quite a bit.  We would have 
been able to donate more, but a lot more people wound up going to BM, 
and leaving town, than we expected, so there realy was not any 
astronomical profit made at the party like people want to think.  
Anyways, as I was saying, the whole idea of giving back to the comunity 
was one of the reasons we wanted to do the party.  
When I heard what happened at BM to a fellow raver, Omar, A member of 
our comunity, we figured that there was no beter, or more deserving 
cause to donate the money to, so instead of giving the $1000 to the 
homeless alience, we gave Omars Mom $500, and to the Homeless Alience 
the other $500.  We wish we only had more to give, but hopefully the 
next party we will be able to generate twice that amount for the 
homless alience.  We send all our love and support to Omar and his 
family during this hard time, and extend any posible help if there is 
to be a benefit party for him."

These posts are supposed make me feel as though this was something great and 
wonderful that $18 was cheap and that we gave so much money to those in 
need?  I'm not in any way condemning the fact that Feel Good gave what 
they did, I think that's great, but I'm questioning the fact that the 
event was advertised as a "partial" benefit and it seems that they really 
did mean 'partial'.  

I was going to make some comparison but it's all apples and oranges 
anyways to most people.  I just get frustrated when I work with people 
throwing a big party with 3 sound systems, and 20 djs and it goes off and 
we can charge *$5* and give a thousand dollars to those in need.  I just 
want to know what are Feel Good doing with all that money?  It's a valid 
question I think?  I'm not asking for a breakdown by item even...but from 
the outside when you add up to $125,000 and you've been told it's a 
partial benefit and you see less than 1% of the gross going to that 
benefit, that doesn't seem right.  I've seen budgets for big parties and 
I know that they aren't the same as small parties, but realistically the 
figures are just way to off here not to say something.

I suppose we should probably end this thread, seeing as it will probably 
only degenerate further.  For me it's an issue of morals, its about what 
is right and wrong, and I won't let those issues die in our rave scene.  

love drenalin

	i love skydiving.  i have made two tandem jumos from 13k,
	at skydance out near stockton.  it rules.  my goal is to
	be certified for solo freefall and have my own gear by
	next year's burningman :)

	i cannot reccomend it enough!

	skydance can be found on the web.  tandem jumping is a great
	way to get together with 2 or 20 friends for a day of chilling
	in the sun and fun...

	like perhaps that person just so happens to strive

Sometimes it's hard to distinguish between people who do things
because it's in their hearts and people who do things because they
want to make a buck. And it's hard to appear genuine when one is
putting on an event that must clearly be designed to make money
in order to cover such large costs.

I heard people had a great time at MB1. I guess that's what it's all
about.

I've decided to leave the list for three reasons:

First, things are getting very busy for me. I'm about to start a new
job that will require considerably more time than I have given my
previous one. With my personal projects (including a community web
site) having playing second fiddle to everything else going on, it's
time I focus more energy on creating, and less on media surfing
(which, I have to admit, is a lot of fun, albeit time consuming).

Secondly, the signal / noise ratio of this list has gotten too small
for me. Too much of the massive volume of discussion is on political
and other matters, and not enough is directly related to raves for
it to be informative enough for me. Many times I have had the
temptation to jump in to the political frying pan (and several times
I actually did). However, given the choice of having these
discussions on-line, or having them in person with friends and
acquaintances, I choose the latter.

Finally, I succumb to the negative vibe of the list. I've carried
great intentions of having this list be an overall positive
experience for everybody. I give my highest regards to those who
have shared this intention with me. While I recognize the importance
of having a balance between the darkness and the lightness of life,
I have found things on this list to be a bit too dark lately for my 
taste. In particular, I have been appaled at the seeming lack of 
respect that several participants have had towards their peers.

Thanks to everyone I've had the opportunity to share discussions
with. I invite each of you to e-mail me personally, if you have
something you'd like to discuss, rave-related or not. I plan to
continue to attend raves (and will be subscribed to the calendar),
so I look forward to meeting y'all at parties in the future. I'm not
sure yet, but I may make it out to Harmony for the 3-year blast.

Peace and Love to you all,
George (a/k/a E. Nygma)

Hello dear friends,

Unfortunately, based on the very real agendas of these pulp TV shows, their
producers and hosts, I don't feel that the SF (or any other) rave community
will be served by having Leslie or any other of our friends on TV 'going to
bat' for our community, lifestyle or passions.

They have control of the angle of the show.

They have control of the camera.

They have control of your microphone.

This is not a platform for the guests to advocate their position. You do
not get to speak freely. This is not a pulpit for guests to preach from. It
is the host's pulpit, and they have an agenda. And that agenda is about
building contraversy around a particular subject, positioning guests
against each other, and the audience against the guests. It's a formula, it
works, and that sells ad time. :-)

If this were a panel show, it would be of mutual benefit to all the show's
guests, but remember, this is not a panel and there is no fair moderator.
These type of TV shows are not democracies. They are benevolent
dictatorships... and ultimately all guests will lose.

Forgetting the clothing, I don't recall seeing anyone exuding the "gangsta 
vibe".  I guess I don't make any assumptions about people just by the way 
they're dressed -- or try not to anyway.

Y'know what would be rather amusing?  To have some huge, hairy, burly guys 
show up on Harleys, dressed in full leathers, chompin' on some fat stogies, 
standing around and staring at everyone.  Do you suppose ANYONE would walk 
up and try to give these guys a hug?  Would anyone chat with them?  Would 
anyone sit one of them down and try to give them a backrub?  Would they be 
included at ALL?

Do you *really* believe in raving as an equal opportunity attempt to 
befriend people without any hangups or prejudices?

Cutting lines of what???  Is it really worse to see people cutting lines of
E vs. giving somebody water and watch them take E in a pill form?  Is this
an issue of the way drug is taken or what kind of drug it is?  \

Actually, E is cut with heroin all the time in San Diego...And by the
way...Heroin is NOT that expensive. Considering how little E you're getting
in your hits, i's say it's quite cost effective for dealers. I don't see
why they'd lie.

This just goes to show you my naivete--from the original post, I thought
"cutting lines on the stairs" referred to people who were "cutting in 
front of people" in the line up the stairs.  Now, THAT's rude!!  :) hehehe

Hmmm...I ride, I have full leather, I love good cigars, and I stand around
and watch people, not ot mention I'm huge, hairy and burly, and I get hugs.
=)

I'd walk up to them and at least say hi.  See, as we like to say, diversity
is our strength.  I've been to huge biker outings, and thus I wouldn't feel
uncomfortable chillin' with a couple brothers; especially if they were
smoking quality leaf.

I'm not dissing your post, but rather saying that because of our diversity,
we could make just about anyone feel welcome.  Hell, what if some lady
walked in with a hat that would make the orginator of Beach Blanket
Babyalon [sp] grimace in his grave?  Why, Leslie could make that person
feel at home, right?  ;^)

Anyway, just because someone's big, burly, wears leather and smokes cigars
it doesn't mean they aren't approachable.

Peace!

Tone

hi all,

I was just wondering, are there any promoters out there that would be

a RealAudio server that will do it, and I'd like to give it a try.

Let me know what you think..

I have to agree, I'd be more offended if someone cut IN line than cut a

I just thought I'd introduce myself.  I am from the L.A./O.C. area and moved
here to Marina to go to school. I was hooked up W/ the socal raves list down
there and loved the scene. I was into the desert rave type events such as
Moontribe and Dune. So, if anyone has any suggestions, my roommate and I are
dying to go to a good crunchy event and start meeting you all up here.
I've been watching the list for a few days now and think that I may actulally
like the rave scene up here better. There seems to be a real down-to -earth
approach that I always had to hunt for in socal.

Looking forward to meeting you all!!

p.s. I heard about a beach/full moon thing at Capitola. This could be my cup
of tE.

Interesting, do you know of any test reports? In the Netherlands the
contents of pills/caps have been tested for years (you can just send them
by mail to a lab or have them tested at raves) and never in 6 years
have I heard anything of heroin being mixed with E. Neither on any of
the dedicated websites. I'd say it's a myth until I see a test report.
Doesn't this discussion return on this list every so many months?

Even more cost effective would probably be to add speed or just flower.
Besides I wonder at what doses heroin is _orally_ active, considering
the heroin is probably already cut itself... It seems unlikely that
such a small amount would get you hooked on anything. Most of these stories
come from people who got ill after ingesting some obscure pill/capsule.
Well, there can be many reasons why people puke/flip, even if they took
pure MDMA. Finally, to my knowledge the heroin using/dealing scene has
always been very far removed from the recreational drug using/dealing
scene. Perhaps this is different in the States.

> I don't see why they'd lie.

Many dealers do lie and even more probably don't really know what they are
selling since they don't synthesize/purify their merchandise themselves.
Anyway the last statement confuses me a bit, why would a dealer try to
sell E while claiming there is heroin in it? I can't see many people
being interested in that, unless their looking for "the ultimate kick"
and have shit for brains.

Dear Friends,

    This has realy gone far enough.  I posted a review of my party on 
the net because I thought that everyone would like to know how thing 
went.  I knew that most people were at BM, so I figured it would be 
nice to tell everyone what went on while they were gone.  Obviously I 
had no idea that there were so many sinical and sceptical people in 
what is suposed to be the "core" of the rave scene.  I does not seam to 
me that my post was treated with a "rave atitude"  Insted it seams like 
people wanted to downplay everything we did, and twist our eforts into 
something negative and unproductive.  
    I certainly know that not everyone out there is like this.  I am 
sure that most of you probably saw it for the way it was ment.  As a 
folowup reviw of the party, Nothing More.
    I forgive all the people for their medeling, and uninformed 
negativity.  It is unfortunate to see such mistrust and decention in a 
comunity that is developed on the basis of understanding and open 
mindedness.  I know that it is real easy to get caught up in a rut and 
become jaded and negative.  And when that point comes I think it is 
time to reavaluate your actions or stop calling yourself a raver, 
Because ravers arn't suposed to be that way.  
    I think that the scene started because people wanted to go 
underground to get away from this type of prejudice and discrimination. 
 But yet here we are, and there are still people talking shit about an 
event that they had no part off, nor were even there.  And the only 
reason that this even started was because their uninformed ignorance 
and negative sceptacism led them to believe that we did not give enough 
money out of our pocket for charity from a party that was not even 
intended to be a benefit.  I have done benefits in the past, and ALL 
the procedes get donated to charity.  This was not a benefit.  Reading 
the flyer or the posts would have told you that.  
    The reason we wanted to give money away to cherity was so we could 
get some good and positve publicity for the rave scene as a comunity 
entity, not a burdon as the media constantly pertrays us to be.  It 
would have been nice to give more, but that was all we could do at this 
time.  In future parties we hope to be able to give more.  Mabee if 
people did a litle more suporting and a lot less talking shit, then we 
might have done better, but thats the irony of the situation, isn't it?
    I was very infuriated by a lot of the posts on the net about our 
party.  I responded to some of you privately, but it wasn't untill I 
read Lesliea's post that I decided to respond.
    Lesliea, I want to thank you so much for your coming to our 
defence.  I almost started to cry when I read what you had writen.  It 
was very suportive and I only wish more people had your atitude.  You 
are example of what I consider somone with a perfect "raver atitude"
    If you or anyone out there has any questions about what it is that 
Feel Good Entertainment is all about, or why we throw parties, please 
do not hesitate to send e-mail and I will respond, or just call me (I'm 
a terible speller) @ 415-593-3664.  I will be more than happy to 
explain any questions you might have.  untill then,

Stay safe, Positive, and Keep The Vibe Alive.
Peace,  Vlad Cood, Feel Good E., 415-593-3664

          beautifully Egyptian sounding.  I'll also bring a 
          positive energy bomb scheduled to go off at an 
          undisclosed hour (as I haven't been raving in a WHILE). 
           The arming sequence will commence early in the 
          afternoon as I soak up the scenery with a final pre 
          charge indicator as I freak in front of the speaks.  
          The major effects will be confined to ground zero 
          somewhere at the site, but waves of energy should be 
          detectable as far away as LA, BC, and Reno.

Forgetting the clothing, I don't recall seeing anyone exuding the "gangsta 
vibe".  I guess I don't make any assumptions about people just by the way 
they're dressed -- or try not to anyway.
     
Y'know what would be rather amusing?  To have some huge, hairy, burly guys 
show up on Harleys, dressed in full leathers, chompin' on some fat stogies, 
standing around and staring at everyone.  Do you suppose ANYONE would walk 
up and try to give these guys a hug?  Would anyone chat with them?  Would 
anyone sit one of them down and try to give them a backrub?  Would they be 
included at ALL?
     
Do you *really* believe in raving as an equal opportunity attempt to 
befriend people without any hangups or prejudices?

If you really do mean we in a sense of the rave scene rather than just 
yourself, I have done more than my share of supporting it, to the tune of 
much time, energy, and money.  There are many people who could tell you 
about some of the things that I've done to help support and foster and be 
a working part of this underground scene you talk about.  IMHO that's 
what it gets to, what are you as a "raver" willing to sacrifice to see 
this scene prosper? and be an open and communicative environment?

In terms of talking shit, I'm a little sarcastic yes but I've never said 
your party sucked or that is wasn't a good event.  Again I'm talking 
purely from philosophical standpoints about ideals and ideas and morals.  
I'm not necesarrily right and you're not necessarily wrong.  I disagree 
with some of the things you do and I'm sure you would of me too, its the 
way the world works.

Damn funny thing social interaction is huh?

sigh. as has been written many times by the more pharmacologically savvy
members  of the list, heroin is *not* orally active in the small 
quantities that would fit in a capsule. thus, someone may as well just 
cut it with kool-aid mix since it's much cheaper than heroin and, like 
smack, will have *no effect*.

anyone want to post a weekly faq?

     I thought you meant people 'Cutting Lines' as in cutting in front of 
     people in a line to a bathroom or some other desperately needed 
     resource.  Boy am I ever lame.  That sneezing thing makes MUCH more 
     sense now.

Cutting lines of what???  Is it really worse to see people cutting lines of 
E vs. giving somebody water and watch them take E in a pill form?  Is this 
an issue of the way drug is taken or what kind of drug it is?  \

yeah, but remember that people have to meet raving halfway. Don't expect to
get unsolicited hugs if you're a burly biker guy chompin' fat stogies and
glaring at everyone because YOU chose to dress/act that way, and you're
sending a clear message about how you want to be percieved. But if you're
that same burly biker guy with a wide smile on his face, who knows??? I'd
probably say hi or smile back or something...

Give *everyone* a chance but don't let yourself be naive. If someone looks
like an asshole, be cautious, I guess.

smiles,

hello!

Well, it's nearing 5pm, and many of you are signing off for the day
[not me; I'm trapped here until late :(]. And today's been a noisy
day, complete with mudslinging, accusations of who is(not) a true
raver, bad vibes, etc.

But let's put it all behind us and remember that it's all about the
music, the dancing, and spending special times with some friends,
whether it's 70 or 7000 (what's an order of magnitude or so, anyway?)

And above all, let's all remember to have Leslie in our hearts
tommorrow!!!  She's a really special person, she has her head screwed
on right, and I know that she's going to survive the wolves and the
vultures in talk show land. :)

air kisses,
Steve

Hmmm, again, where is the evidence? Most of the E distributed in Europe and
especially Brittain (and I assume Ireland too) is manufactured in the
Netherlands, and that stuff is pretty clean. Unfortunately the web pages
of the Netherlands Institute for Alcohol and Drugs are in Dutch but they
keep a close eye on what is sold and made in the country. The only serious
problems they ever came accross were too high doses of E (ironic, huh?).
Besides, E is a drug that sells itself. Seeing how far its use is spreading
all over the world I would say there is little use for getting people more
hooked. The market is already huge because as someone once put it, not
everybody wants to trip or get high but everybody wants to be happy. Seeing
how the available quantities and quality of the E sold in Holland have
risen over the years (and prises dropping) I'd say dealers have more to
gain by selling good E (which will sell increasingly better by word of mouth)
then by selling bunk of any kind (which essentially works only once).

If there is any mixing done, I'd say people do it themselves. And again,
I have serious doubts about the _oral_ activity of heroin. After so many
years of abuse of that drug I'd say people would have figured out whether
it made sense to eat it, instead of smoking/injecting it like most junkies
do.

And before any similar post follow, let me say this:

- there is no strychnine in acid
- hair doesn't grow on the palms of your hands due to masturbating
- acid/E do not drain your spinal fluid (thanx Andy for reminding me of this
  one!)
- there is no heroin or mashed lightbulbs in E
- etc. etc.

Besides all the horror stories that live in our community, the real dangers
are much more simple. E is a substance of which nobody knows what the long
term effects will be and nobody has a good feel for the purity of what they're
getting. Several of the chemicals involved in the synthesis of MDMA are
at least dubious and I doubt if the people synthesizing it are really
concerned with (or have the equipment to check) the purity of the final
product.

Rave safely,

The Frying Dutchman

Debates aside, the fact is that the promoters didn't have to donate any 
money to Omar's cause.  They chose to, and whether it wasn't enough, or 
was just to generate good press in the underground, or whatEVER, $500 
goes a long way to Omar's family right now.  More could be done, sure - 
by all of us.  But let's give thanks where it is due for ANY help that is 
given.

Given that I've seen a few posts go by with mentions of "E" being cut 
with heroin, I thought I'd mention that there's an article in the current 
issue of High Times that presents test results for several "E" samples 
purchased throught the world. The test was funded partially by Nicholas 
Saunders.

You should recognize the article and it's findings as the same as the 
results that Marc Fathauer (associated with MAPS?) posted to SFRaves back 
in May.

The issue also had some interesting coverage of the recent efforts by 
legislators to change the laws regarding preparations including 
ephedrine, etc.

The current issue of Details also offers some test results for a small 
number of "E" samples purchased around the U.S. They turned up similar 
results.

I have a feeling Wayne may have never watched this specific show (today the
guest was Elizabeth Dole and it was a very well-done piece regardless of
our agreement with her and her husband's politics).

I've gotta say (again) that the Leeza show is not "pulp TV" .... it is (as
talk shows go) an intelligent and well-crafted show.  I'm not naive ... but
I have to tell you that the producers went to two parties this weekend in
LA and told me that they were happy to find that many of the things I said
were true ... about great music, happy vibes, drugs not being that
prevalent (they noticed it was the club kids doing the drugs, not the
ravers) ...

And they've invited lots of real ravers to be in the audience as well.  I
like to give people credit until they prove me wrong .. and I hope not to
be proven too wrong on this one...

We cannot have it both ways .. we can't complain about media misinformatin
and then refuse to take a risk to represent the real truth.

So, I am optimistically off to LA in the morning, and ask you all to send
me your energy from about 1:30 til 3:00 or so, when the actual taping will
take place.

Love to all of you amazing people, if they see just 10% of how great our
scene is, we will have accomplished a lot!!

Leslie  (p.s. yes, I have decided to wear a hat ... after all, that is an
integral part of who I am, and the whole point is that we've created an
enviroment where we can be ourselves, and that's all good!)

It's not about Leslie's ability at all. Sadly, it's about the level of
input any individual will have over their own ideas in an environment like
that.

Hey all!
  We are three SJSU students (two guys and one girl) living about ten
minutes walking distance from campus and downtown.  (We were four, but one
of us has had to take a leave from school for a while and will be returning
home to his family.)  It's a four-bedroom house with two baths and showers.
Unfortunately, rent is $1600 per month, so that divies down to $400 each.
BUT, there is a very homely vibe here and a very happy feeling all-around.
We are all clean (meaning dishes mostly), into recycling, and respect. 
  Please respond to us a.s.a.p. as our room becomes available this weekend,
(9/14/96).  Of course, if you need help moving in, I'd be delighted to help,
but this weekend isn't gonna work for me because I'm going to the three-year
Harmony party!  : )
  Sooo, if you wanna get back to us, you can reply to this email, or call us
at 408/998-0581.  We'd love to hear from you!  : )

        peace                   love                    happiness

And just what "way" are they supposed to be? You make derisive remarks
about people's uninformed opinions, yet you refuse to offer any real
information. As far as being a raver, you are in no position to make that
determination.

"Just think, your partying will help the less fortunate this winter."

I repeat this quote because it really stands out. How can you even *BEGIN*
to claim that you did not give the impression that this was at least in
part a benefit, and that something beyond a token amount would be given?

>the other $500.  We wish we only had more to give, but hopefully the

How many people need to come to do that? 14,000? Would 200,000+ dollars be
necessary to generate $2000 for charity?

Not at all, since your budgeting seems so poor that you can only manage
a miniscule portion of your gross. Believe it or not, there are other
groups out there donating to charity, and the percentages are *much*
different than yours.

You know, I would have absolutely *no* issue with Feel Good Productions if
you hadn't chosen to wave the charity issue around. Charge $100 for your
parties, make 10 million dollars. Good for you. But don't *ever* claim to
be truly charitable, expect people to blindly believe it, and get upset
when a few of the sentient ones question you.

	Boy I'm already starting to get excited about Harmony.  I haven't 
been to a party in for a while, but that OK.  It's kind of like sex, the 
longer you go with out it, the better it is when you get it.  But waiting 
too long isn't good either.  I'm sure you can think of reasons why it 
wouldn't be.  But anyways, I can't wait!  Life is kind of odd.  I work 
almost all of the time, when I not working I spending time with my girl 
friend Elizabeth (who you all will get to meet at Harmony), but besides that 
I do nothing.  Raving (and jumping out of airplanes) has become my only 
exterior source of entertainment, so it's really special to me.  Anyways, 
I sure I will see most of you at the party.  I love you all.

Mattloaf

P.S. Be prepared to receive the biggest hugs that you have ever had, you 
have been warned.

This is a classic argument-- the cynic (Wayne) believes no memes can 
reach escape velocity from within the Spectacle-- that the game is fixed 
with no chance for a really good hack...

Well I for one disagree, Mr. Cynical Wayne.

<SERMONIZE>  I be-leeeeve in the power of the trope, the turn, the hack.
I be-leeeeve in the forces of chaos and the way they swirl when some good 
positive energy is directed at them, all coded in brilliant language and 
clever tone.  I have faith that Leslie will be her articulate raver self 
and will weave a lovely, natural protien shell for the positive memes to 
get past the mediaspheric interference.  I have faith, my sisters and 
brothers, that PLUR will win the day.  Love is the bomb.   </SERMONIZE>

 A DJ Question To You All -

 I've just been bopping around my room, listening to a compilation CD
called "Hard Hop Trypno" on the "moonshine music" label. I like it a lot!
The artists/tunes are:
eboman                donuts with buddha
philadelphia blunts   i like that
uberzone              botz(synthetik)
fatboy slim           everybody loves a 303
keoki                 caterpillar (stepdisk mix)
supersoul             the masterplan
zen cowboys           mad world (the crystal method remix)
more funky shit       listen
the crystal method    blast
mr. funkster          massive

 I guess the style is "trip hop" - it sure sounds good coming out of my
new studio monitor speakers!

 Anyway - which DJs spin this style in the SF Bay area? Are there any
weeklies devoted to this stuff?

Tomorrow morning I'm off to Paramount Pictures to see our lovely 
Leslie in the spotlight.

I talked to the producer for quite a while today, and he seemed very 
open and enthusiastic about the show (I don't know how much of it was 
truly sincere). He went to two raves last weekend, one clubkidd and 
one semi-vibe; he seemed very positive. But nevertheless, I'll be 
there to insure at least a smile to the comments Leslie has to say 
about our scene.

I'll keep you posted of the outcome. Look for an SFRaves shirt in the 
audience!

Big phat ass hug beamin north,

CT

Dear Leslie,

	It's okay to use my name here, I'd rather be a person than an
anonymous "voice" or "someone."
	Reading what you've written below, I feel like hostility is being
attributed to me that I never expressed.  While taking issue with my idea
that promoters should go public with their profits and expenses is
certainly legitimate, I don't like the implication that I was giving
MegaBuzz1 shit.  Maybe that particular phrase wasn't meant to apply to me
Leslie, but your post is full of my quotes, so it's not hard to draw that
conclusion...
			(more comments below)

My computer tells me that on Tue, 10 Sep 1996, Leslie Ayres shared:

	What I meant by nasty rumors is the kind of speculation that Feel
Good Entertainment wasn't being that generous, that they really made tons
of money and only gave a token amount to look good to the rave community.
If this is untrue, then I feel as bad as anyone about it that the matter
ever came up.  What I was suggesting is that financial disclosure would
settle such rumors once and for all.  Misinformation can be very damaging,
I agree, and the only way to effectively counter it is with the facts.
Know the truth, and the truth will set you free.
	Now Leslie, maybe you aren't aware that Feel Good is the same
group as Cool World, or maybe you weren't here or don't remember the shit
that Cool World and their parties have taken in the past on this list,
rightly or wrongly (and not from me, I might add).  Like I said, I'm on
the fence, I can see both sides.  My wish for financial disclosure was not
directed at Feel Good, but at all rave promoters; it merely came up in a
thread concerning Feel Good.
	I've met Vlad from Feel Good, and he is a nice guy.  He comped me
and a friend for one of his parties in fact, and I certainly don't have
anything against him.  This doesn't change my opinion that I think it
would be a good move on his part to open the books, and like I said, that
goes for anyone throwing a party, not just him.

> Where is it written in the official rules and regulations of raving that

Now this is kind of funny, because I've publicly defended massives on
SFRaves, and I've never belonged to the school of thought that says
smaller is better.

We can definitely all agree on this I think.

No, it's when you *don't* give the information that you get 450 opinions
based on "a total lack of information on costs and logistics," and that's
precisely the problem.  
	It doesn't take "experience with big dollar business" to see that
if costs were $10,000, and door receipts totalled $20,000, then $10,000 in
profit was made.  All it takes is basic math.

None of what I've said has been meant to detract from the wonderful thing
that the Feel Good promoters did in donating that money.  They definitely
deserve props for it, because of course it is true that they didn't have
to give anything.  What I fail to understand Leslie is why you
apparantly feel that doing a good thing means that no questions
should be asked from that point forward.

Ah, the old "if you haven't been there/done it yourself, you can't have a
valid opinion."

Now this is truly funny, because everyone here who knows my politics knows
that I am a die-hard capitalist.  I would not deny anyone their right to
make a profit, and I am totally against government confiscation of
people's earnings in the name of the community or anything else.  However
as William Safire said...
	I too wish everyone could make a living doing something that
brings joy to people's lives, but isn't it easier to create joy if it's
obvious to everyone that you aren't hiding anything?  I sincerely believe
the rave scene will be better if more people in it do nice things for each
other because they want to and not because there's a profit in it. 
	I'm asking promoters a favor on behalf of our scene, not demanding
money and violating privacy at gunpoint as our government does.

Much love,
				<<< Starchild >>>

P.S. - You can believe me or not as you choose, but if I were throwing a
big party, I would disclose everything, because I would conduct my affairs
in such a way as not to embarrass myself should the information become
public.

For the sake of ravers and all mankind, I hope this thing turns out well.
raving is still a driving force in my life and it just pains me to see our
little world projected into a bad light. it's just so beautiful and
misunderstood.

Perhaps the MegaBuzz folks are being just charitable enough to make the
IRS happy? Perhaps the $1000.00 makes a good write-off. Or perhaps it
puts them in a completely different tax category so they can pretend to
be a nonprofit organization. Hell, churches do this kind of shit all
the time, and they get away with it, so why shouldn't a rave? Of
course, the government is catching on to these ploys, witness, for
example, the Christian Coalition getting caught pretending to be a
"nonprofit" organization that has done an excellent job of "cooking"
their books while managing to generate huge amounts of bribe money to
pay off the appropriate congresspeople. IMHO, people claiming to be "of
faith" make the best perjurers and swindlers. Whether it be ravers "of
faith" talking crap about how they want to "give back to the community"
or church elders plundering the coffers filled by their increasingly
impoverished parishioners.

Anybody want to Join the Church O' Niels? Please send $100.00 ... You
will do this because you know I'll be giving back to the community
vibe, but first I gotta buy me some slow cars and fast wimmen, and some
houses and boats so I can throw more vibe-laden parties. Peace Love
Unity and Respect, my brothas and sistas!

yours truly baby.........now actually, these tracks are a little fast to be
considered "triphop".....they are more along the lines of "break
beat"...... 
 
many of these tracks are at least 6 months to a year old now.........I play
similar styles and grooves.......... I don't know of any weeklies, (here in
the bay area) but I'll say I played these styles (and actual tracks) in
london, and they loved it......... 
 
I would call it "west coast breakbeat" except that eboman comes from
holland, fatboy slim comes from brighton (in the uk), uberzone is from
germany, and zen cowboys are from the uk as well......... the only track
that doesn't belong, is the kioki track, and if you read my posts, you will
know I can't stand his DJ'ing or his music, or his self proffssed
"superstar status"   Phewtuey spit yuk !!!! 
 
crystal method, massive funkster and more funky shit are all u.s.
artists...... 
 
but for all intents and purposes these are all break beat styles (as
opposed to the old 4/4 style of beat we know as house/techno/ or trance) 
 
I personally like them because they are more funky sounding as well as
possess the acid and club elements........and to me funky will never go out
of style.... 
 
I'm glad to see someone else give some credence to their existence........
I feel justified in my musical choices, even though I find a fraction of
the interest in my spinning than say the avaerage house dj (i won't mention
names)...... moonpup

I don't understand what you are saying. 
 
does this mean I should blatently blurt out to everyone on the net or at a
rave, that I am doing drugs that we all agree with, and only do things like
speed on the quiet, or does it mean I should do all my drugs on the hush,
or does it mean I should only do druge you agree with, or does it mean I
shouldnt do drugs at all ?????? please clarify your rather open statement

Subject: Help!  Mixer assistance needed
Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

I'm sure that someone out there in rave land has had experience with this
problem:

I recently bought an MTX 1550 DJ Mixer with the highest of hopes -- sounded
solid in the store, sliders knobs and switches seemed solid, and all for
the low low price of $275.  After bringing the box back home and setting it
up, I now see what the difference between a $300 mixer and a $700 one is.

My mixer is really susceptable to radio noise interference.  I talked to
some guys here at work and they told me it was most likely due to a bad
ground somewhere in my house.  One of the outlets I tried the system on was
not producing radio/refrigerator/every other electronic appliance in the
house buzz, but the one room where everything must be set up most
definitely is.

I'm told that poorly constructed and grounded wiring is very common here in
San Francisco, so I figured that people must have figured out ways to
overcome this annoying problem, so I'm asking -- short of having an
electrician come in and overhaul my circuit, what's the next best thing?

Help me!  I spent money I don't even have for the thing, and now it's
coming back to haunt me :-(

Thanks!

Oliver

I know how ya feel Larry, I love that CD too! I've never heard 
any of those tracks played here in the Bay Area but about a 
month or so ago when I was visiting friends in Austin, Tx they
were playing that Uberzone track all over the place...even in
the clubs. I remember even seeing that compilation on vinyl
and I DIDN'T buy it...been kickin myself in da butt since then!

Peace,
John

I was talking to a friend at the last Sunset about whether the human
species will destroy itself before any positive (r)evolutionary memes
will have a chance to significanly steer us towards a path more in
harmony with the forces of nature.  There are a lot of assumptions
embedded in this line of questioning, but I think it's obvious that
if you believe that certain ideas or values are worthy of being
spread, then the message needs to come out somehow.  *Perhaps*
even a distorted message is better than none at all, because 
a distortion can carry some truth along as its source.

This is why it was important, and good, IMO that Megabuzz let everyone
know that it gave something (even if only a token) to charity.  Even as
a marketing ploy the theme is a good one.  Same with their their
declarations of PLUR, etc.  Anyone remember that Coke commercial with
the multiracial gathering on a hilltop singing "I'd like to teach the
world to sing in perfect harmony..."?  It may have been a commercialized
perversion of a positive meme, but I can still remember as a kid, not
caring about having a Coke, but seeing a message that championed a
reality much different than the one I knew.  An image to strive towards.

Subliminal messages make a difference.  That's why many of us think that
"Blitzkrieg" is a shitty name for a rave.  (Not that Megabuzz is much
better).  

Cynics like to shout whenever a message doesn't match the reality, and
it is important that we try to be aware of such revelations.  But 
sometimes the message is more important than reality.

Beautiful Dead People:

The BP party apparently stood for something wonderful, and showed
genuine concern for one member of the rave community who was severely
injured due to carelessness at a rave camp.  I found it ironic that
this party was held at such a fire death trap like the ACME warehouse.
But what choice is there?  What the Harmony folks want to say and
achieve may be more important than any high degree of safety for the
people they clearly love.  If and when a bunch of beautiful (or
even ugly) people die there, I can't help but to wonder what the benefit
party will be called.

All,
	The Djs that I'm familiar with, to spin breakbeat, are Frank Nitty, Ghost and Kwashi.
I think Carlos spins some but Ghost's domain is breakbeat.Frank and Ghost tore it up
at Megga-Buzz spinning on four decks. They all spin regularly at raves and I think some 
weeklies.    Hope this helps.

Megan,

Can you reply to me privately so that I can give you Eric Peterson's
phone number.  He has your Harmony ticket.

I'm assuming there will be a shuttle running through out the party.  Can anyone
verify this for me?

thanks,

I believe that is true but only Greg Sandler knows for sure. =)

there will be a shuttle running between the parking lot and the party
location. the parking lot will be guarded, so all cars will be safe, etc..
but you will have to drive to the parking lot. the shuttle is _not_ running
from SF to the party.

that was the last i heard. so it should be pretty close to what's actually
happening.. ;)

I haven't been subscribed to the list for a few weeks now due to
proccupations so I'm catching up on the current threads...as far as
people appearing on talk shows to champion the rave scene, I know that
these SF ravers probably have the noblest intentions, but I feel the
media machinery of Hollywood is not the best of vehicles. Leeza as a
standard of journalistic credibility? I think not. The mainstream media
has always tended to sensationalize  everything and there's no way any
talk show can capture the pure essence of hours of music and dancing and
bonding. Why even try? Major media attention also tends to lure hordes
of curious people at once which leads to a major influx of stupidity in
a scene all at once. It's far better to have people turned on in
smaller, steadier numbers. If there are motherfuckers out there who
still are clueless, let them remain so.  Anyway that's just my opinion.

In other matters: my sublet ends in a few weeks and I'm trying to sort
out a new living arrangement. If anyone knows of a room in SF opening up
in October,  I'd be grateful for any leads. You could email or leave a
message on my voxmail: 415.995.4906.
Let's see: I'm an East Coast transplant, BA in English, currently a
software tester at SEGA and working an internship at video prod. company
and I have an undying love for stylin' dance music, be it house or
techno or a lovely mixture of the two! Once again, I'm looking to hook
up with intelligent and fun people who are into the scene, among other
things.
Peace.

is it a fire death trap? there are two exits on the first floor, and the
loading door could be opened in the event of a mass evacutation.. the top
floor was not used.. the only problem seems with the basement, but there
were several fire extinguishers downstairs and several more on the main
floor level. if anything caught on fire it would be put out right away; the
only fire problem i could see is if something actually blew up, and if
something did it wouldn't really matter much if you were in the acme or
anywhere else cause you'd still be fucked if you were close to the blast.

that's hardly a fair statement. greg didn't have a chance to confirm the
original space planned because he rushed out to reno to be with omar. and
the harmony crew definately had the safety and comfort of everyone at heart.
there were several fans set up (even though more would have been better,
they certainly were nice), there were fire extinguishers in plain view, and
there were specific arrangements made to prevent overcrowding.

if there had been any serious doubts in the harmony crew's minds about the
safety of the acme, it would not have been used.

OK, I guess I owe the Harmmony crew an apology.  I've been to ACME a few 
times and it always seemed like a disaster about to happen.  If good
precautions were taken this time around, than I stand corrected.

Hi!  Did anyone hear of any upcoming raves over at Stinson beach (across
the Golden Gate bridge from San Francisco)?
I've been to a few of them and loved it.  If anyone has any info on that,
please get back to me via E-mail. The adress is SteveRak@juno.com
Or if you know of any other raves in the vicinity, do get back to me as
well!

nothing would save you in  that building, though, if there were an 
earthquake.  There's even a warning sign on the door pretty muh sayying 
"enter at your own risk"

I don't go the the Acme anymore - too hot and stuffy.

Too bad Harmony's happening so far away from me - I'm glad I found out 
the general location before purchasing my ticket.  Have fun for me, 
y'all. I can't afford a $20 rave anyway cause Burning Man broke me and I 
am saving up to move to San Francisco.  Hey!  Then the Santa Cruz area 
won't be too damn far to drive anymore! :)

I'm staying at home with my Whitley Strieber book and learning all about 
our extra terrestrial visitors. :)

 I would just like to mention here that I always bring a small, yet fairly 
well stocked 1st Aid box and that I have had CPR and 1st Aid training, 
not to mention experience in medical emergencies (including an emergency 
situation while my mind was expanded and I was required to watch someone 
and keep them from choking on their own blood until an ambulance   
arrived.) Another item is that I use AC boxes with circuit breakers on 
them - this helps to reduce the chances of shorts and electrical fires.

Yeah!,
I was in seattle & B.C. this weekend and they we're playing plenty up there!
 I can't believe SF doesn't have even one night of funkier beats.
whasupwitdat? I know tons of folks who dig the hell out of this shit, I know
I'm wearing moonpup's tapes down to the reel.  ALSO: what's up with the
"COOL" connection.  There's this video store on haight where this big funky
brother is always playing some really FATFAT beats. He's really nice and all,
but he never really tells me what it is, just says shit like "cool, it's a
way of life man" in this stoney mellow voice. I've heard the term used in AJ,
but his beats are way beyond AJ. (though I like that too)  Sounds like a hell
of an opp. if someone would open a club specializing in a range of laidback
beats.

Hello,

    For everyone who wanted to help with this year's anniversary event, 
there will be a meeting in San Jose tonight @ 7pm, it will go until 10 
or 11. We are meeting @ the City Espresso on Steven's Creek at 
Larwrence Expressway. If you would like to come, it would be greatly 
apprieciated. Please be respectful of the establishment, and clean up 
any mess you make. 

    We will discuss everything that is going to happen on Sat. and our 
goals for the event, as well as how we can all help to achieve those 
goals. Also, we will talk about the future of our brother Omar, and of 
Harmony itself. We could really use a lot of help, so don't be afraid 
to offer it!! Thanks in advance, and we love you!!

Peace,

Greg :)


Ps: this meeting was intended for my house, but too many people want to 
come and we can't fit in my living room, so it will be at City E on 
Stevens Creek and Lawrence Expressway. Coming from San Francisco take 
280 so (or 101so to 85so to 280so) exit Stevens Creek/ Lawrence 
Expressway. Take a left at the light at the bottom of the exit. That 
will put you on Stevens Creek, and you will see it on your left. 
(Across the street from Safeway)

>From east bay take 880 or 680so to 280 no and exit Stevens Creek/ 
Lawrence Expressway. Take a right at the light at the bottom of the 
exit and it will be there on your left. Look for a familiar raver's 
face. C-ya there!!!

Hey Oliver, saw this on SFRaves... I'd guess that the cheapest solution
will probably be getting some heavy duty extension cords to that one outlet
that has no interference. Not pretty, but it will work.

Other than that, the easiest thing to do is lift the ground. It may not
solve the problem, but it's worth a shot. You can do this by getting one of
those 2 prong to 3 prong adapters (ie the one you would use if your house
only had 2 prong outlets, and you had 3 prong plugs). This usually has a
clip attachment for a the screw that mounts the outlet coverplate to the
wall - you would remove that screw, plug the adapter in, and then put the
screw back through the clip. To lift the ground, DON'T do this - the clip
is what makes the ground contact... you'll need to make sure that the metal
clip doesn't touch any metal at all, bend it or break it off. Or you could
just cut the ground plug off of your power strip with a pair of pliers, but
this obviously permanently damages the strip.

I must say, though, that lifting the ground is a last resort option - it's
not very safe. It's a fire hazard, and it's possible to fry your gear if a
major spike comes down with no ground to go to. I've NEVER seen it happen,
I've done it myself a thousand times, but you never know... I'd unplug the
thing when you weren't using it.

Let me know if you find any other solutions that work.

Dear All;

        For the 10 thousand millionth time, READ MY LIPS!!!!!! E is never
ever routinely cut with heroin. My source of FACTUAL information, as
opposed to you SPECULATION comes from an interview with the head of the
British Police toxicology lab, as well as a similar American counterpart.

        They both said the same thing, that out of all the samples they
have tested  over the years they have never ever found MDMA cut with H, if
you do please save it for me.

Peace
Brian

I WOULD LIKE TO SET THE RECORD STRAIT!!

   Feel Good Entertainment, and Cool World are not in any sort of 
similar catagory as you so put it.  All because you chose to group us 
this way does not make it everyones opinion.  Feel Good Entertainment, 
has in the past been involved in some aspects of Cool World parties, 
and we in no way have in no posible way any posible regrets for our 
participation in those parties, they were all incredibly wonderfull 
events and exposed mor new comers to the rave comunity with one party, 
than most samll parties do in one year.   
    This woever does not change the fact that Feel Good Entertainmnet 
and Cool World Productions are Two compleatly seperate enteties, and 
only work together on project by project basis.  Feel Good 
Entertainmnet has always done its own thing, and our asosciation with 
Cool World, and Cool World association with us has become a lot 
stronger in public perception, then in actuality.  So from now on, 
please do not relate the two organizations in one breath.  
    We have always taken a lot of pride in every project we do, weather 
it was a Cool World Production, Or our own party, Or the Buzz-Line, or 
any of the club nights we produce, or any of the other promoters we 
work with.  But that does not change the fact That we are are own 
seperate group of individuals and are not directly asociated with any 
other group or promoter.   


>This doesn't change my opinion that I think it
>would be a good move on his part to open the books, and like I said, 
>that goes for anyone throwing a party, not just him.

    I would not touch this topic for anything.  All I am going to say 
is that you must be frigin nuts if you think anyone is going to 
disclose prices and finances to a forum of people they don't even know,
ON THE INTERNET...of all places.  Anyone not agreeing with your event 
or having a diferent opinion could just forward the post anywhere, 
including any goverment agencie with an e-mail address.  You must be 
some sort of sheltered waco to think that there are only ravers on this 
>list and that anything is safe here.  Puting any information on here 
is like giving it to everyone in the world, and I don't think that 
there is anyone out there that is clueless enough to do anything of the 
sort. You realy need to get a grip. 

If any one else has any questions, plese just call me at @ 415-593-3664
I would rather talk in person, my spelling is, as you can tell, 
absolutely terrible, and I will be glad to answer any aditional 
questions.

PLUR,  Ray Vonie,  F.G.E.

  Hmm.
  I don't know how much I'd be able to help out, but I'm going to come
along and find out - can someone tell me where this City Espresso place is
in relation to San Jose CalTrain?  I've never been to San Jose (or south
of Mountain View, for that matter :)
  If there's anyone driving from (or through) Palo Alto close to Stanford,
a ride would be excellent - though not necessary.  Since it's such short
notice, if you want to offer a lift (which I would *really* appreciate!)
give me a call at work - 415-725-9157.
  Thanks!

Ray, Ray, Ray:

How can the leader of a company not know how to spell or run a spell 
checker?  Most people on this list post many spelling errors, but you 
are trying to come across as an authority figure, a responsible 
businessman.  You come across as a kid who can't spell and thinks an 
apology at the end of your note will make it all better.  The internet 
is based on writing and spelling.  I wish more people would pay 
attention to that fact.  Either that I wish more people would be too 
embarrassed by their apparent illiteracy.  Because if you can't 
spell you are illiterate.

Webster's:

illiterate: 1. having little or no education.  especially: unable to 
read or write.

Yes, it says write!!!!!  And if you can't spell: you can't write, 
therefore you are illiterate!!!

(sorry about that, all you misspellers on the SFraves list)

Or a dyslexic or a foreigner, which has little correlation with intelligence...

I've heard pretty reliable sources state that there has never been H
found in E, usually usually they speak up when someone posts about the
subject.

I've also heard that the offending chemical that people are mistaking
for H is actually "Dilaudia" (sp?) in E.  I've also heard "Dilaudia"
referred to as "synthetic heroin".
A few months ago I had an E that made me horribly sick for 2.5 days.  I
couldn't stop barfing, and there was NO identifiable sensasions that
come along with E.  I felt zapped, basically numbish, and extremely
nautious.
Could this be from this chemical "Dilaudia"?
Anyone in the know have any comment on this?

Ray, I don't understand. Sure somebody could forward that information
anywhere, but why is that a problem? (unless of course you're hiding the
fact that you underpaid your union sound contractors, gave the money to
arms dealers, or exceeded campaign contribution limits)  :)

(note liberal use of :) 's). I simply wish to convey that I cannot think of
a single good reason why information such as budgets NEED to remain secret,

Dear you,
	Thanks for being so candid in your remarks. I think the first 5
posts I received telling me I was wrong probably got the message through.
But seeing as as yours was so condescending and patronizing, I actually
believe it now. 

-thanks for the heads up

Hi ho, folks.  Just wanted to let you know about some new mixtapes I got
in...

R.A.W. "Terminate":  This is a double tape of 100% original drum & bass
by R.A.W.!  There's elements of hardstep, intelligent, ragga, and
breakbeat.  These are for sure the most interesting jungle tapes I've
heard in months.

DJ Liquid:  "Listen to Me Roar" and "Trip to Moonville".  LTMR has some
funky progressive trance on the A side, and drum & bass on the B side. 
Trip to Moonville is all funky trance.  Both are 90 minutes.

Snuggles & Slak:  "Silk Cut 3" Dreamy, smooth intelligent drum & bass. 
The only drawback is that it's a 60 minute tape, but it's also only $10.

DJ Trance/Fester:  "Fester Trance 4"  I will probably get this one
tonight.  Trance tells me Fester plays some hard acid on his side, and
Trance plays Acid house, beginning with that "Allright Allright" track.

DJ Dan "Imagine":  This one has been actually out for awhile, but we
finally got more in stock.  It's cool, experimental chillout Trip Hop. 
Kind of nice to hear something a little different from Dan.

Ron D Core & Simply Jeff "Blitzkrieg":  THese are limited.  Simply Jeff
lays down the funky West Coast Breaks & trip hop, and Ron's side is live
gabber.

New stuff on the way--->  Dan Efex "Freakout":  Dan Efex's last hardcore
gabber mixtape!  A tribute to the many faces of Speedfreak.  This one
will knock yer socks off!  Also expect a new trance project to be
released in the coming months. 
Christopher Lawrence:  "Prophecy":  Awesome progressive trance is what's
to be expected here.  It should be available in 3 weeks.

Anyhow folks, those are my newest tapes.  I'll be set up at Magic
Wednesdays tonight and Nocturnal Wonderland on Saturday.

p.s.:  SF ravers (or anyone else), if you e-mail your paper address I'll
send you a free Pure Acid Mixtapes catalog which I promise is dope. 
Thanks!

I don't have a problem with him. as i stated in my post, i just think it is
questionable that his budget must remain secret. As for the Cloud Factory,
first of all, there are no promoters involved with CF, we are people that
have parties. Also, I don't really think "The Cloud Factory" has a problem
with him because that would involve everyone in the collective having "a
beef with" him, and that's alot of beef, and probably about half of the
cloud factory is vegetarian.

Having a learning disorder does not stop you from running a spell 
checker.  I am dyslexic, I have a real spelling problem, but I have a 
dictionary right here on my desk.  See it? ;-)  I need that because I 
sometimes mangle a word so badly that my Pegasus Mail Spell Checker 
can't even recognize it!  Being a foreigner, well that's a little 
different, but a foreigner can still run a spell checker.  I guess 
it's just a problem for me because I over compensate for my own 
spelling problems.  Because I am mostly on the internet for business, 
I have no choice but to look business-like.  And poor spelling is not 
good business! 

It's just my little problem.

Sorry if I scared anyone.

Hey folks!

 Get the fuck off of the backs of your rave promoters!!  NOW!! They 
(sometimes we) put up with more shit, gamble so much and generally put 
themselves on the line way more than any of you folks can ever imagine 
unless you have done it yourselves. While comments and feedback are one 
thing, the comments and criticism (on this thread) are sounding like 
whiney spoiled brats who can not appreciate the hard work and anguish 
promoters go through.

 If you you think you can do a better job than PUT UP OR SHUT UP!!!


cheers, ;)


Ran

Sounds like Dilaudid, which is a prescription opiate painkiller. Strong
stuff, and not easily obtained. (This is what the crew in the movie
Drugstore Cowboy were primarily after) I'd be quite surprised if any ever
turned up in e.

[ to sfraves list ]

 A DJ Question To You All -

 I've just been bopping around my room, listening to a compilation CD
called "Hard Hop Trypno" on the "moonshine music" label. I like it a lot!
The artists/tunes are:
eboman                donuts with buddha
philadelphia blunts   i like that
uberzone              botz(synthetik)
fatboy slim           everybody loves a 303
keoki                 caterpillar (stepdisk mix)
supersoul             the masterplan
zen cowboys           mad world (the crystal method remix)
more funky shit       listen
the crystal method    blast
mr. funkster          massive

 I guess the style is "trip hop" - it sure sounds good coming out of my
new studio monitor speakers!

 Anyway - which DJs spin this style in the SF Bay area? Are there any
weeklies devoted to this stuff?

Hello everybody, 
	I just got home from the taping, and am proud to say that Leslie
did an absolutely wonderful job, even though she was sandwiched
between two ultra-conservative, close-minded mothers, and was up
against a (typically) low level of audience awareness.  She did manage to
convey many good points and she portrayed herself
intelligently and articulately.   There was a large contingent of
colorfully dressed and well spoken So-Cal Ravers.  All in all it was just
what I expected from a talk show; biased, and highly annoying.
Krishna.

I am glad she was able to portray herself as she is(articulate and
intelligent.) I imagine it can be very difficult to do so in that type of
enviroment.

Having been to some HUGE events that attracted all kinds of people, I've seen
those people transformed and uplifted by the rave scene that they weren't
necessarily a part of, but had just wandered into by chance. 

If you throw a ball at someone, human reflexes condition them to catch it-

If you were to throw love or peace or compassion, would the same thing
happen?

Let's hope we all have good reflexes...

No. 

1) They are not "my" rave promoters.
2) You are in no position to dictate to people to shut up. If you want to
   shut up please do so. However, you telling everyone to shut up is about
   as useful or right as me telling you to shut up. One of the purposes
   of this list is discussion. And that is what is occuring.

Welcome to life. It is all a gamble. My experiences, or any other persons
on this list are no less valid, despite your obvious opinion to the
contrary,  rather they are a "rave promoter" or "just" a mere mortal.

And you sound like a pompous ass. Why should anyone shut up, as you have
demanded? Who gives you the authority to limit the discussion, because
you do not like the direction, or the questions being asked?

I have *serious* problems with anyone using the name of charity to peddle
tickets to their events, as Feel Good Productions has. They self-promote,
using in part the guise of largess(I will not bother requoting their posts
to this effect a second time), refuse to offer details, which seems in
direct opposition to their claims of wanting to foster a "community," and
whine about everyone making uninformed opinions when it is they that hold
and refuse to offer the information that would inform us all.
If you are making a living off your "community" then why should it bother
them to tell that "community" where *their*(the party-goers) money is
going?

     It's too late to still be at work...
     
     Whew Leslie!!!  I don't know if I'm feeling into this too much, but 
     for a second, it must have been pretty freaky going up in front of all 
     this negativity and keeping your (beautiful hat adorned) head.  I for 
     one would have started losing it.  It would probably be pretty safe to 
     assume their expert panel of rave skeptics have gone to less raves 
     than most of us... otherwise they would have fallen in LOVE baby.. EL 
     - OH - VE -EE!!!!
     
     I work in a pretty strict corporate environment, and I have to say:
     
     People I meet at work all seem to think:
     
     1. Think raves are all about drugs.
     
     2. Think raves are just a 'front' for gays and lesbians to meet.
     
     3. Are wild sex orgies
     
     4. Are a place were people go to mindlessly go deaf to music
     
     5. Are the last bastion of hardcore EMF fans
     
     6. Are huge events complete with corporate sponsorship
     
     7. Religious abberations were drug crazed freaks worship SUPERSTAR DJ 
     Keoki
     
     8. Where ex hippies go now that the Grateful Dead aren't touring
     
     9. Are the only public performance arenas for people who play Ozzy 
     backwards (that's why they all have those 'old fashioned record 
     players'..)
     
     10.Are the primordial ooze from which the sociological, psychological, 
     artistic, musical, cultural and ethical revolution of the 21st century 
     will evolve from.
     
     11.Where America's teens really go when they say they're going to a 
     friend's house to stay over.
     
     12.The reason JBL is still in business
     
     13.Just a phase to keep us busy until we figure out how to get the 
     Pentagon building for a party/exorcism for new years eve 1999...
     
     I'm so glad it's all true!  I'm so glad it's not all true!  I'm so 
     glad we can embrace diversity and live to tell about it!  I'm so glad 
     it's now!  Here even!  Better than most places!  I'm so glad!!!
     
     Shine you damn raving locos shine!!!!!!!!
     
     Must get more coffee...
     
     Bye for now.  It's going to be an incredible week.  I've seen it.  I 
     have this toilet I go to sometimes, and if there's nothing obscuring 
     the view, I can see the future...
     
     Now to find something to do tonight... somewhere around here there's a 
     place that would benefit from this excess energy.
     
     Peace peace peace

I don't have a problem with him. as i stated in my post, i just think it is 
questionable that his budget must remain secret. As for the Cloud Factory, 
first of all, there are no promoters involved with CF, we are people that 
have parties. Also, I don't really think "The Cloud Factory" has a problem 
with him because that would involve everyone in the collective having "a 
beef with" him, and that's alot of beef, and probably about half of the 
cloud factory is vegetarian.

three campers hospitalized, one is in critical condition, another is in
serious condition, and the third has been released. According to [Pershing

Howzit goin for y'alls folks?

I feel like it's been a while since I've posted anything to sfraves, been
running amok for the past 2-3 weeks! :)  Having safely returned from that
Fabled Land of Phat Bong-Hits (Portland, OR), I've finally settled down a
bit & feel like writing once again.  I had my two week vacation from work
with Burning Man weekend smack in the middle of it, and it's been a doozy!
Burning Man was incredible, and I think our camp setups all worked out quite
well in spite of differing opinions on the part of various vw-camp members
as to where to camp.  I liked being in the main camp rather than the rave
camp actually, cuz that was really what I wanted to see/experience, the main
camp itself with all its nifty freaks running around. :)  Rave camp was
cool, altho I did have some difficulty finding stuff in the dark riding
around on my shitty little bike, and I very much enjoyed the CCC music & the
Gateway setup.  Those are the only two camps I checked out, was never into
Wicked and could never find Spaz unfortunately.  And actually, several folk
had smaller soundsystems set up at their camps in the main camp (ie our own
camp, and the Syntonics) which was really groovy, I'd bop on over to the
Syntonics camp & boogie with about 20 other people to one of BioJeff's famed
marathon sets, and it'd be just great!  Familiar smiling faces, great music,
in just a little camp setup 100 yards away from our own camp, and two more
stones's throws away from the hub of activity in the center of main camp.
You all have heard the various descriptions of the Roving Sofa, the Chai
Hut, the House of Doors, the Bubblewrap Camp, etc, all very cool!  I
particularly found the loud rallying politically debating picket-line that
was setup in defense of day-glow colors amusing (especially when I noted the
one sign amongst all the day-glow signs that loudly proclaimed "I like
cheese!" I found this very politically motivating, and not only that, but
I'm eating cheese as we speak!)  I really understand where these guys are
coming from, day-glow is a very misunderstood set of colors, and I for one
am a little tired of the constant abuse & harrassment these colors have to
face every day from callous, uncaring, and bigoted individuals.  It's time
we take a stand folks.

;)

Anyway!  Off my day-glo soapbox!  I know BM is supposed to be entirely
participatory, but I still feel like I was too much of a spectator (I get
the feeling a lot of us first-timers probably felt like that), and
definitely want to do more next time around, assuming they do have another
BM next year.  One thing I thought would be cool to do was to take a setup
like The Ambient Chai Hut and put one out at rave camp.  I thought the one
thing lacking at rave camp was a good chill area where you could hang out
and keep warm ok, cuz I know several people probably danced the whole night
away when they would have liked to sit down for a spell but couldn't cuz it
was too cold on the playa at night.  So I thought it might be cool to build
a structure in the middle of the sound systems with an ambient setup,
smartbar, hot beverages, blankets, pillows, etc for chilling people on the
playa.  Anybody else think this might be a good idea?  The only problem I
see with it is that it would force me to spend a lot more time in the rave
camp alone when I might otherwise be travelling elsewhere. But hey, I'm sure
I could figure something out!   So I'll either do that idea, or I'll set up
a Spaghetti Hut in main camp & feed lots of people spaghetti!  That could be
fun too.  We had a communal spaghetti dinner in our camp the last night
there, and it really was nice having friends & family sitting around all
eating spaghetti together.  Either way, I know I want to figure something
out to do so that I'm not just sitting around going "oh look that's cool."
It was weird realizing that all the stands & setups were not just organized
by the BM crew (like concession stands at a concert or something, where all
the stands are set up & run by "crew members"), they were just by people who
showed up & decided to do something cool!  True freedom of expression
combined with really providing things/services for other people just cuz you
want to.  Perfect! :)  

I ended up deciding that I was glad I didn't do the RV thing like I
originally wanted to, I borrowed this tent from my co-worker which is a
two-room tent, biggest fuckin thing I ever saw!  Yes, it had two rooms, and
I have a blow-up air mattress the size of a double-bed, so we had this huge
"house" with a double-bed in it (comforter, sheets, feather pillows & all!),
coleman stove to cook up fat meals with (wild-mushroom ravioli with tomato
basil sauce! :), lots of community shade to contribute, and even a welcome
mat at the door!  I was pleased to note that our large tent got used by
various crashing individuals, which is why I wanted such a behemoth in the
first place of course!  Tho Sam & I didn't have any big thing to contribute
to Burning Man itself, we still enjoyed being able to wake up in the morning
& make people coffee & cook them up quesadillas with lotsa stuff in 'em,
feed them dinner & share our sleep space with them, our little group of
tents really had a community feel to it and it was our best way of
contributing at the time.  I was pleased with it! :)  And like I said, the
Syntonics camp was right across the way, so it was nice to grab a cold glass
of Odwalla oj (little over $4 at Costco for a whole gallon, folks, bout the
same price you find for a half gallon at a regular store!) & head on over
for some early afternoon music before the dust dervishes got too out of hand
to play records.  The chai hut was great, Steve Simitzis & I would often
head over there & just chill & drink our tea and dance to gruvy jungle
toonz.  I saw the most amazing array of camp set-ups, everything from simply
tying a cloth to the doors of your car to create an overhang, to building
elaborate pc-pipe (that's what that white tubing's called right?) domes
which housed all things imaginable.  RV's abounded of course, and I am
remembering what a classy set-up they had as far as holding tanks were
concerned.  They actually had a roving sewage-type truck that ran around 1)
cleaning all the portapotties on a daily basis, and 2) emptying people's rv
holding tanks for them when they got full mid-burning man.  Very cool!  

Things of course got very dusty, and I have to admit, after hearing
countless times about going to the desert, I was surprised to find what was
actually a dried mud-flat rather than dunes of sand like I'd pictured.  Ya
know how mud dries & crackles, the entire 'desert' was made of this flat
stuff.  And after a while, the dust got so thick that it looked like San
Francisco on a foggy day!  At dusk on Sunday night, before the Burning of
the Man, while watching an incredible desert sunset, I really felt like I
couldn't quite tell which of the two that haze was, fog or dust.  It was so
surreal, with the sky blazing red in the western part of the sky & dust-mist
so thick you couldn't see tents very well that were farther away, people in
our little temporary community throwing frisbees thru the mist, ambient
music playing at somebody's camp somewhere hidden by the mist, really
beautiful actually.  Even tho at that time, Sunday night, I knew that I
would be ready to go home when it was time, standing there watching all this
I began to miss it already.  I get the feeling that for many people I talked
to (& myself), in certain ways it was kind of hard being out there in that
fashion, just being there experiencing it was pretty intense from begin to
end, and relations with those around you and everything in general was
experienced with a heightened sense of intensity, and things would be
intensely negative as well as intensely positive for sustained periods of
time.  But it was really all worth it, and I wouldn't change any of the
negative or positive experiences I had, and I think a lot of people would
agree, it's all part of what makes up the Burning Man Experience as a whole.
And on that Sunday night, I knew that I would miss it! :)  I actually do
miss the group of people I camped with, cuz no matter how I see you all in
the future, no matter where it is, it won't quite be that little, dusty,
tented mini-community out there on the playa!  (and thank you Steve, for
being the most excellent company! :):)

Ok, nuff bout BM, after getting back from BM, I flew up to Portland to visit
our own SFRaver Brenda Brewer!  That was really cool, and it was great of
her to let me stay with her for the time.  I was lucky to be there the time
I was, cuz her collective, the Ahau Collective, threw a nifty daytime
gathering in the strangest place!  Right smack in the middle of downtown
Portland, in this big outdoor square called Pioneer Square!  And get this,
they simply rented it for the afternoon for $50!  I thought it was a
particularly cool location because it was completely accessible by
everybody, so by the end of the evening everybody was dancing, not just the
pierced baggy-pantsed raver crowd, old people, "regular" folk, everybody was
there together in dance, which is a part of the Ahau's deal.  What I like to
see at all raves! :)  

Ok, I'm finally tired of writing!  Time for bed.  'Night y'alls!


Love,
Shawna

Greetings fellow ravers,

  I want very much to drive up north to attend the Harmony Party.   It will be
PHAT!...    I need licensed drivers to accompany me on this trek up north,
and am looking for anyone who can share the gas and driving.

  It takes about 10 hours for the trek up to San Jose area,  and I have room
for 2 or 3 people in my car.

  For those that went to Burning Man,   one of the Harmony ravers got seriously
injured when he got run over while in his tent.    This party if for his
healing fund,  and I want to show all of you Southlanders what the Bay
Area scene is all about,  so this is your wonderful opportunity to tag along
and party with us.

  I want to leave late friday evening,  around 9 pm or so,  and drive through
the night to arrive in San Jose at around noon (when the party starts).

  The party goes on until Sunday morning,  and after a few hours of rest,
we plan on heading south again.    So please bring whatever donations you
can for Omar,  your love and well wishes...

The Crunchman

In case anyone cares, the actuall Millenium occurs in less than 3
weeks.

You see, "1996" means 1996 years since the birth of Christ.

HOWEVER, modern historical research is virtually unanimous that Christ
wasn't born on December 25 of 1 B.C.

It seems fairly clear that the calendar got jumbled more than once
over the centuries.

The clearest evidence for dating the birth of Christ is that his
parents had to travel to Bethlehem for the Census.

Using historical Roman records of the censuses (and other minor
details in both the biblical account and other historical accounts),
the most likely date for the birth of Christ is September 29, 4 B.C.

Which makes the Millenium two weeks from Sunday.

At least "they" were considerate enough to make it a Saturday night,
yes?  :-)

PS  Sorry I didn't give you more notice....


Be seeing you,

Ken

Friends,

What was meant was, if one has to indulge themselves in taking a drug to make
their rave experience more meaningful.  One might want to keep it down a
little to the general public at the parties.  People can do what ever they
want with thier bodies, but what drug your doing should only be an issue
between your friends and yourself.  Not YOU and the WHOLE PARTY!  There are
better places to initally take your drug, then to be lining up in the stairs,
or shooting up on the dance floor, or even popping pills in the chill room!
 People don't have to make a big scene of what they are on.  And all those
people lining up in the stairwell were doing was saying "Hey were on
drugs!!!!!!!!!!!!"  


Your Friend,

Antone!

Is there any way to tell when the E is cut with heroin?   By taste?

Wow, what a party! Cool decorations, phat ass laser, lighting was 
excellent! (C'mon, it's a TV studio) Chilll room was decorated nicely.

Leeza grooved as the producer layed out some funky acid-breaks, and 
one of the stagehands busted out an incredible goa trance set. The 
Paramount Pictures lot is such an incredibly gorgeous venue!!!

JUST KIDDING!!!!!

Seriously, I wish I had something good to say.

Way too much focus on raves being just sex ladden all night drug 
fests.

They had a couple mom/daughter duos that they focused on. Two of the 
moms were pro-rave, but the most positive mom was left in the audience 
so she only got about 20 seconds to speak. The other mom looked kinda 
bad to the audience because they couldn't believe she let her 16 year 
old daughter go to these "drugfests".

Plus, they planted this brainless (and ball-less) drug dealer from 
Florida in the audience who rambled on about how raves were about 
selling drugs. ARRRGGHH!!!

They also had a bunch of the most outlandishly dressed clubkidd type 
ravers there to represent us as "ravers". (Love those 3 foot high 
shoes!)

Well, Leslie was definitely a island of relief in that ocean of 
diarrhea. She retorted to comments and questions with nothing but 
exellent examples of the positive aspects of raving. Too bad she 
wasn't given enough time to speak. :(

I was sick to my stomach by the end of the show.

But it was definitely great to see Mhg and liquid there to complete 
the SFRavers row!

My $.02 is that the producers had their agenda way beforehand and 
executed it just as they planned. There was really nothing we could 
do. It would have happened anyway. At least we had Leslie there to 
combat some of the SHIT they were throwing around.

That's Hollywood for ya.

Oh wait...I do have something good to say.....

Why not? Do you like jumping on the backs of people?

Questionable position but not entirely unreasonable. However I think you 
are delibrately taking my statement too literally just to have a point to 
argue with. Since they generally live in and throw parties in "your" 
communitie(s) they are arguably "yours".

No duh. I never told anyone to shutup (at least not in the post you are 
referring to.) As I mentioned, discussion, feedback, even intelligant 
discourse is all good. However many folks are adopting a whiney tonality 
of spoiled little shits.

"...obvious opinion..." sure would be nice if you could back up that 
statement, directly, with some quotes. And gee, all life a gamble?!? 
Why... imagine that! Such insight, such wisdom!!
 The point was not that some opinions are less valid (although some are, 
at least to me on certain subjects... what Bush thinks about raves is 
certainly not valid to me) the point is Honest feedback is good and 
supports the scene. Whining and criticising without understanding the 
position one is attacking is mearly pathetic and should only be allowed to 
live so long.

"And you sound like..." (gee, see how silly that is, thanks for falling for 
that one :) Again, I have not demanded that anyone shut up. And why is 
your attack and criticism now personal and insulting? I'm not limiting 
the discussion (as you seem to want to limit what I say), I am mearly

Well, maybe your best at a flailing attempt to deconstruct someone 
else's comments but the discussion here was originally on promoters, 
their techniques and work stlyes. I mean really, if you all don't like 
rave promoters so much why go? Do you even know what is going on? Have 
you tried to talk to promoters one-on-one? Go to a nice safe church or 
something nice like Denny's.




Cheerio!  =)

hey kids!

I've been suckered into coming down to Mountain View (public transit! 
from UCB! =P ) and doing some last-minute deadline shit for my old 
summer job ("time-and-a-half, mike!"). so here i am, at 3 am, just about 
done. Thought I'd shoot a message of goodwill off into SFR-land and wish 
you all some crazy-ass dreams; the kind where you wake up in a huff 
thinking "holy SHITE" and go scrambling off to find a pen and paper to 
write it down because it was SO FRESH. Sounds like I'm getting far too 
excited thinking about Harmony. see you all this weekend!!! I'll be out 
with a fat grin and a roll of cutesy little stickers; hoping to meet 
STILL MORE NEW SFRAVERS, and introduce some shiny newbies to the parties 
i love best. =)))

nighty-night,
-m.

Beautiful People,
	As today being my birthday (not bragging......NOT!!), a friend of mine (Arlina) had me 
select from a deck of Indian Medicine Cards. Today I pulled the Beaver and in the explanation
this was said:
		"To accomplish a goal with others involves working with the group mind. 
		Group mind constitutes HARMONY of the highest order, with out individual
		egoes getting in the way.Each partner in the project honors the talents and 
		abilities of the others, and knows how to complete the piece of the puzzle
		that belongs to them. In working well with others, a sense of COMMUNITY
		is achieved and UNITY ensues."
	
	This really made my day and hope it can make everyones life. Hope to see you all
        at Harmony. This will truly be my first rave. I'm 6 foot, Latino and will be 
        wearing a pair of beige, welders over-alls.

Wow, what a weird and long day yesterday.  I've been processing all of the
hubbub of what happened to sort out the positive, forward-moving things.

My original goal in going on the show was this:

We as a community cannot complain about media coverage if we are not
willing to put ourselves on the line to defend what we so strongly belive
in.  Yes, you have to put yourselves into the media hype arena ... since we
don't have a public forum on tv ... and you have to play by their rules and
in a way take what you get.  But if you're not willing to do that, you have
NO RIGHT to complain about how you are portrayed.  That's why I did it, and
I knew it wouldn't go as a perfect, flowing, glowing piece.  The people on
this show are not sleazebags, their heart is in the right place, but they
are from conservative america and had a lot of misinformation that they
built on.

First, allow me to say being picked up by a limo driver and having your own
trailer on the set with your name on it is a trip.  Even if I HATED it, I
kept wandering back inside where stuff was happening pre-taping, but they'd
gently guide me back to my trailer -- I think the were worried some mom
would get mad at me and who knows what would happen.  Silly.

Walking into the studio and seeing friendly faces, hearing my name called
out by Krishna, Terry (CT), Madame Mercury (Sherry) and Liquid (Ryan), and
the Crunchman ... that was great ... and there were several SoCal ravers
there I'd met.  The audience was about  70% ravers ... though a visible
contingent of them were really club kids with the makeup, stacked shoes,
gothic-drag appearance .. which I totally love, but isn't really
representative of the whole scene at all.

They reorganized the order of the show mid-stream, so I didn't get the
slice of time expected ... there were three moms there ... one with her 2
daughters, one of whom used to rave and the other does it now with her
mom's ok ... 16 years old, she's from NY and told me backstage that raves
there are about clothes.  Sad and pretty boring really.

The next mom was a fairly cheesy misinformed woman with a shining and
adorable 16-yr-old daughter whose resorted to sneaking out windows to go to
parties, so that mom has actually tried nailing the window shut.  Both she
and her daughter took a lof of shit from the audience (bad disobedient
girl! bad misunderstanding mom! stuff)

The third mom's daughter ran away from home and she blamed it on raving,
found her 10 days later and put her in drug rehab in S. Carolina where they
live.  The girl called on the phone and said when she gets out, she'll rave
again, it's not about drugs.

Bottom line, the topic of the show was restricted to young teenagers going
to raves to get sucked into doing drugs, and the discussion certainly made
people worry about that .. as well they should.

Positive aspects:  I got to tell this story (please tell me if you know who
this is, I'd like to talk to her before the show) ....  When I was at a
party last friday before the party began, a young girl arrived with her
dad.  She showed him the decorations, the sound system, the chill space.
He hugged her goodbye and left, and several kids said "Is that your dad?
That's so rad, I wish my dad would come to a party and see what it's really
about."  I encouraged kids whose parents don't understand raving to take
them to a party and show them first-hand what they're doing.  Kids want
their parents to understand and support them in doing the things that make
them happy.

I said that I don't believe that 14-15-16 year olds have any business
taking drugs, they're not able to handle the experience ... some of the
audience bood me, but they bood and clapped for the oddest stuff ....

I said that kids have drugs available everywhere, not just at raves ...
they take drugs at school ...

I said that raving is about happiness ... it's about music and dancing and
expressing your individuality.

What did other people say?  Its largely a blur ... so we'll have to see how
it edits down.

So much is just a blur to me ... thankfully Terry, Sherry, Ryan, John and I
went to grab some dinner afterwards, so I had a chance to decompress with
friends.  Made my plane by 2 minutes, Terry!

Will this show make any difference in our REAL scene?  Nope, it was about
young kids and drugs really.  I told the producers I was disappointed, that
they should consider doing a show that's actually about the spiritual and
community side of raving ... but hopefully there was some balance added to
this show by my presence that would not have been there at all without me.

Wish I'd have been there the day before ... Whoopi Goldberg was the guest,
would have loved to have met her!

the producers say it will probably air in early October.

I have no dealings with them. Physical proximity does not equal community

Gee, did someone else type this? Certainly sounds like you are demanding
that everyone shut up. Is "get the fuck of so and so's back", and "PUT UP
OR SHUT UP!!" your idea of discussion, feedback or reasonable discourse?

It is sitting right above my statement. Here is the second time that I

Who is whining? I haven't seen anyone whine. As far as "understanding the
situation," those with the information refuse to share it. Yes, that is
their *right*, just as it is my right to remain critical in the light of:

1) The obvious amount of money generated
2) Their use of charity as a selling point for tickets
3) Their refusal to share with the "community" that they claim to want
   to foster why seemingly so little of that money went towards charity
   when using the name of charity to sell those tickets.

I do not see how telling people to "get the fuck off of the backs of your
rave promoters" is stating a position.

I do not see how telling people to shut up is stating a position.  

You are attempting to demand that the conversation end. Sorry, that is not
stating a position.

What are you talking about? I don't see how any statements made were or
are a critisism of "rave promoters." The discussion centers around
a specific production company. That does not equate to all "rave
promoters" everywhere. And yes, I am talking to the promoter, or one of
them, one on one. However, this is a public forum, public statements were
made, and the issue should be dealt with in public.

	Yuk. DXM on it's own (so i hear) can be a pretty amazing
experience, having something like 4-5 different plateaus/stages depending
on dosage. For the amount that would fit into a capsule one probably
wouldn't get *that* messed up but it would depend on body weight, set,
setting, what you have in your stomach, etc.  Another big non-MDMA
ingredient is Ketamine (a cat tranquilizer) which has similar dissociative
properties as DXM does (albeit K requires lower dosages).

	With regard to the person who asked about "synthetic heroin" i
beleive there's a substance called MMTP or MTPT which fits this
description, though i'm not sure on the veracity of any info of it being
passed on as MDMA on a regular basis.

	Word has it that one can tell real MDMA by it's taste which is
'salty' and has a licorice kind of smell and taste to it (caused by the
saffrole which it's made from). So, lick before you buy. (Is that "Lickus
Emptor" instead of "Caveat Emptor" ? ;)

	And, of course, the only 100% safe thing is abstention and relying
on your own endogenous ecstasy which can be produced by the following
process:

	1 part hugs
	1 part techno
	1 part dancing like a maniac
	1 part temporarily turning off all rational thought

	put ingredients into a warehouse with other test subjects, turn up
the heat and swirl with a cosmic swizzle stick. :)

1) The H in E thing is nonsense, reasonable proof of that has been offered 
   and is available, and no reasonable evidence to the contrary has been
   shown.

2) Herion can be orally active in reasonably low dosages. Morphine, and
   other opiates were routinely mixed to make cough medicines in the 19th
   century. They even have a word for the concoction, but it escapes me

         Reply to:   RE>Hello WORLD!

Well, since it doesnt look like we are going to see FGE's books, I decided to do some calculations on my own.

DISCLAIMER!!!!
I am not a promoter, have never thrown a party, have never been involved in throwing a party.  So I'm just doing some very generous estimates at how much it may cost for the following items:


$20,000 Space
$5,000 Security
20 DJ's at $500 each = $10,000
$20,000 Sound
$10,000 lighting
$10,000 crew
$500 water
$  5,000 for rental of Bouncy Castle
$1,000 Charity

For a Grand Total of = $81,500

7,000 people at $18 a pop = $126,000

$126,000 - $81,500 = 

$44,500 left over.

Are there any other unforseen costs that I am missing?  Permit costs?  Insurance?  anybody have an idea on how much that stuff costs?  Didnt Martin post a breakdown of his expenses a while back?  Could we compare FGE with The Gathering (as far as expenses are conserned)?  Anybody want to go back into the archives and repost Martins post.

Ray, I don't understand. Sure somebody could forward that information
anywhere, but why is that a problem? (unless of course you're hiding the
fact that you underpaid your union sound contractors, gave the money to
arms dealers, or exceeded campaign contribution limits)  :)

"Laudinum" or something close. Several Victorian notables were addicted

I WOULD LIKE TO SET THE RECORD STRAIT!!

   Feel Good Entertainment, and Cool World are not in any sort of 
similar catagory as you so put it. I am not sure where your 
information, or should I say misinformation comes from, but I do want 
to correct you and tell you and everyone else that this is not true. 
All because you chose to group us this way does not make it everyones 
opinion. 
 Feel Good Entertainment, has in the past been involved in some aspects 
of Cool World parties, and we in no way posible way any regrets for our
participation in those parties, they were all incredibly wonderfull 
events and brought huge amounts of new people into the rave comunity.  
    This however does not change the fact that Feel Good Entertainmnet 
and Cool World Productions are Two compleatly seperate enteties, and 
only work together on project by project basis.  Feel Good 
Entertainmnet has always done its own thing. Our asosciation with 
Cool World, and Cool World association with us has become a lot 
stronger in public perception, then in actuality.  So from now on, 
please do not relate the two organizations in one breath.  
    We have always taken a lot of pride in every project we do, weather
it was a working with Cool World Productions, Or our own party, Or the 
Buzz-Line, or any of the club nights we produce, or any of the other 
promoters we work with.  But that does not change the fact That we are 
are own seperate group of individuals and are not directly asociated 
with any other group or promoter al because we work with them.   


>This doesn't change my opinion that I think it
>would be a good move on his part to open the books, and like I said,

    I would not touch this topic for anything.  All I am going to say 
is that you must be frigin nuts if you think anyone is going to 
disclose prices and finances to a forum of people they don't even know,
ON THE INTERNET...of all places.  Anyone not agreeing with your event 
or having a diferent opinion could just forward the post anywhere, 
including many goverment agencies.  You must be some sort of sheltered 
waco to think that there are only ravers on this list and that anything 
is safe here.  Puting any information on here is like giving it to 
everyone in the world.  I don't think that there is anyone out there 
that is clueless enough to put private financial information and 'open 
the books' on this forum, and if there are, well you realy need to get 
your head out of cyberspace, and get a grip on reality. 

If any one else has any questions, plese just call me at @ 415-593-3664
I would rather talk in person, my spelling is, as you can tell, 
absolutely terrible, and I will be glad to answer any aditional 
questions.

So???  It's called capitalism, it's the American Way, you know, like 
making money.  Making a profit is NOT bad.  As much as you'd like it 
to be, it's just the way things are.  People will try to make money 
off their friends and community.  So what?  What's the big deal?  Are 
you preaching some type of socialist utopia crap?  If so, then you 
should only go to partys that are free.  Then you know some big bad 
evil promoter won't be making an evil bad profit!

  Well, it kinda sounded like:

  They had control of the angle of the show.

  They had control of the camera.

  They had control of your microphone.

  This was not a platform for the guests to advocate their position. They
did not get to speak freely. This was not a pulpit for guests to preach
from. It was the host's pulpit, and they had an agenda.... It's a formula,
it works, and that sells ad time. :-)

  This all kinda sounds like what I was saying earlier in the week, wasn'it
it?! Well, huh. I was branded a cynic and nearly tarred and feathered and
sent packing for pointing out these issues. But nooo! "Leeza is different."

  Different my ass. [thanks to Neils for this particular inspiration :-)]

  So now that we've offered up (we, the collective rave community, not
specifically Leslie) our people, what did we get?

  Screwed.

  Thanks, SLeeza. You've really done us justice. And your producers only
had the best interests of the rave community in mind, didn't they?

  Maybe they can team up with Hard Copy next time.

I'm not saying that its Bad that they possibly made a shitload of money off of MeggaBuzz,  I was simply trying to give a breakdown of what they may have made (IMO).  Again, its just me being too wired on coffee and playing with my calculator at work.

So???  It's called capitalism, it's the American Way, you know, like 
making money.  Making a profit is NOT bad.  As much as you'd like it 
to be, it's just the way things are.  People will try to make money 
off their friends and community.  So what?  What's the big deal?  Are 
you preaching some type of socialist utopia crap?  If so, then you 
should only go to partys that are free.  Then you know some big bad 
evil promoter won't be making an evil bad profit!

Wondering if anyone caught the show AMP last Sunday morning at 3AM.
Very trip.  A one hour solid mix of ambient done in music video style to
primarily animated videos.  It on again this weekend.

I haven't heard anyone object to them making a profit. What I, and some
others have objected to is the questionable use of the name of charity to
encourage people to come to their parties. And yes I will cast stones in
this regard, given the refusal of the promoters to present any evidence
that would end this discussion once and for all, and yes, I do think I am
wholy qualified to do so.

Profit itself is not bad. Misrepresentation is.

	Don't forget debt from parties that didn't go off.  We're such nice 
people, bitching when a party makes money, then demanding our money back when 
one's busted and assuming the promoter (and his/her investors) should eat the 
cost because he's rich or something...  Come on, 1 + 1 = 2 no matter how unfair 
it seems.

right, so the mass-media are about hype and ratings and are probably
antithetical to and accurate coverage ...

now, i'm not saying there's necessarily any good reason to seek publicity
and popular recognition/understanding -

but, here's an idea - the bay area is full of local cable-casting
companies that by law have to provide free public cable access to
pretty much _anybody_ who asks for it - and so there are a ton of local
news, variety, and just general 'weird and cool stuff' shows being made
and broadcast on local cable.

if some people were genuinely interested in creating some good quality
positive press for the rave community, then i bet there are lots of local
cable shows that would be eager to come to a rave, interview ravers, dj's,
promoters, the whole thing.  probably all it would take is some phone
calls and free passes (like promoters don't paper the house already).

since these shows are semi-amateur and don't rely on advertiser revenue to
stay alive, you can bet there'd get a LOT more creative and editorial
control over the result, especially if help was given during the
editing and so forth.  it wouldn't be slick and polished, and it wouldn't
air on major network prime-time, but it might actually be truthful and
representative ...

just a thought.
matthew.

Questionable use of a charity's name?  Is the charity asking those 
questions?  Or are they happy just to get the money?  Whatever the 
sum?  If it's O.K. with the charity and if you are not calling it a 
benefit (where EVERYTHING goes to the charity) I can see no problem 
here.  Even if they give 1 dollar to the charity, if that's cool with 
the charity, then it should be cool with us.  Or maybe we should 
question the charity?

Subject: A Groovynifty Idea! :)

Hey guys!

For the past few months a gruvy little idea has been rattling around in my
brain, and I've finally gotten off my ass enough to look in to it and
propose it to you people.

Anybody here familiar with the Tactile Dome at the Exploratorium?  Those who
are have probably already figured out what I'm thinking! ;)

Anyway, for those who aren't familiar with it, the Tactile Dome is this big
ol' dome that is completely dark, no vision whatsoever.  You walk/crawl/etc
thru the passages built into this dome and do it entirely by touch.  The
dome is set up to be an entirely tactile experience, all kinds of cool
textures & things to play with, including small slides that send you into
vats of dry beans, walls with all kinds of weirdo things attached for you to
experience, things like that.  A few years ago I went, and it was fucking
awesome! :)  Now my idea here is to ideally get about 15-20 ravers together
and rent the Dome out!  This is how they work.  You call them ahead of time
to make a reservation, and as a group of at least 15 we'd get it all
entirely to ourselves to play with as a private party!  It's $12 per person,
and this includes admission to the main part of the Exploratorium, so we
could go early & check out the Exploratorium, and then at our scheduled time
go to the Dome for 1 hour & 15 minutes, which is the time they allow you in
there for.  Like I said I'd like to get at least 15 people, cuz if you have
under that, they let other groups in, and I thought it would be fun if we
rented it all to ourselves!  The Dome is closed till September 30 and opens
October 1, but ideally I wanted to do it sometime in October anyway, more
advance notice for you guys.  I would like to get some sort of a head count
as they want the money up front, so confirmations soon would be good.  The
weekend of October 19th is out for me due to other prior obligations, and
Tribal Future is going to be the weekend of October 12th (columbus day
weekend) but let me know what other weekends would be good/not good and we
can work with that.  

Any takers??  Come on, it'll be great fun!  15-20 happy ravers wandering
around a pitchblack dome relying purely on tactile sensation?  :):)  
Oh yeah:  not recommended for claustrophobic people, or people with injuries
of some sort.

I think that's about it, let me know what you all think, and I can get to
making us the reservation asap!


Love,
Shawna

	Well, think of smaller production companies who are not obtaining 
permits. If we requested that they open their books, it would put in 
place a document that might allow police to come knocking on your door 
and with all the crap about how it is not emissible in a court of law 
(because unless you get a lawyer who wants some money, you are playing 
Russian roulette with assuming you will get a judge who does not believe 
in cops acting in "good faith") that you threw a party without permits 
and you now have a hefty citation in your face.

	Maybe feel good has bribes on its finical sheet which they can 
not release, maybe they did business with some "legimate businessman" 
groups that will come looking for kneecaps when their payoffs are puton 
the web in the archive for some one investigating the group at the IRS to 
pull off using AltaVista or something... Maybe these things could be made 
into a special category called "Special Expenses" which could hide all 
the expenses that we cannot be informed of their sources, then the books 
could be opened no? Profits could be hidden from us in the "Special 
Expenses" category... But I suppose people will come ask about the 
Special Expenses if they are otrageous...

	Still do not feel like opening the books? Why is iot such a hard 
ship with these measures? Maybe you could come up with additional 
measures to keep things as was agreed upon with the people FGE decided to 
work with... Why is it such a hard ship to open the books? Was loads of 
money spent on decorations and cups and got lost in the process (like 
most parties?). Are there books to open?

I have, and the hamstas were not impressed.  Face it, they walk around naked 
all the time.  They're far more impressed when I dance with baggies, shoes, 
funky t-shirt, long sleeve shirt tied around my waist, Dr. Seuss hat, 
backpack, whistle, camera, extra film, lip balm, lotion, water, fruit, 5 
lbs. of candy, 10 lbs. of laminates, and 20 lbs. of flyers that got stuffed

Done it.

That too.  While sitting on a shelled hard-boiled egg.  It was *special*.

No, questionable use of the *name of charity*, two different things.

And I have posted two very clear statements from the promoters, one saying  
that this was a "partial benefit," the other saying "just think, your
partying will help the homeless this winter."

Technically, you are correct. They said they were giving some money, they
gave some money. Ethically, however, without any evidence to the
contrary(exept "We won't tell you, but trust us"), I think it is entirely
improper to encourage people to come to your parties in part because
of your donations to charity, and to hype your largess when your largess
ain't so large. 

Ethics is a very complex subject, and open to debate. That is what is
occuring. However, I have heard nothing to change my view on this subject.
I do not accept someone being technically correct as by default also being
ethically correct. You also have to examine the past history of the
involved parties, if you want to come to a reasonably accurate determination 
of their motivation vs. their stated goals. Have fun with that one.....

Dear Ravefriends,

	It occurs to me that all this is an excellent civics lesson:
After all, the government asks us to vote for higher taxes, in the name of
helping the poor, defending the country, maintaining the infrastructure,
etc., and we conveniently overlook the fact that most of the money is
wasted and does not actually go to the stated causes.  Of course the
corporations and other recipients of government welfare are happy to get
their equivalent of $1, so why shouldn't we be happy too?

Subject: Anybody Need 1 Harmony Ticket?
Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

Sadly, it's looking like I might not be able to get to Harmony this
weekend...I have already bought the ticket.  I live in Berkeley, and don't
have wheels to deliver it, but contact me through e-mail or at home
510-845-3566 if you are interested.  Unfortunately I will need to sell it
at face value, as a financial crunch is among my  reasons for not being
able to go.

Peas,

Peter

Like Wayne said, like others said, like I said -- told ya so! Y'all
forgot one thing. If you think what happened in the studio was 
sickening, wait till you see what ends up on the cutting room floor,
versus what gets aired. If Leslie did a halfway decent job of
explaining anything in a cogent and reasoned manner, you can be sure
it'll end up cut out. Expect a quick-cut pastiche of the most stupid
and ignorant antics of clowns & doofuses; they'll be sure to cast a bad
light on anybody that doesn't fit their theme ("Look at those crazy
stupid unchristian freaks!") -=- any intelligence and insight will be
chopped up, taken out of context, and generally misrepresented. That's
what TV talk shows are about.

Y'all should learn to be cynical like me. That way, you're often
pleasantly surprised when something turns out well, rather than
constantly disappointed that your unrealistic, idealistic
happy-happy-joy-joy expectations are rarely met. You see, cynicism is a
positive force for dealing with a fucked up world. :-)

PS: Leslie -- I hope you didn't sign any documents saying you wouldn't
sue the show for miquoting you or quoting you out of context. If they
really fuck with your statements (if you're (un)lucky to get any air
time at all), you could potentially sue for public defamation. I hope
you got paid at least.

	I've taken over the thursday night 9:30pm to midnight slot at KALX
90.7fm, Berkeley until late October or so.  Next week, I'll be playing an
interview with FAX recording artist Tetsu Inoue, and featuring music from
several of his albums.  The text of the interview appears on my web site, if 
you're unable to tune in for it.  My show regularly features mostly ambient
in the more experimental/monochrome end of things, with a few beats and some
more danceable stuff thrown in.  

	Thanks for reading this, and I hope you can tune in.

take care,

I suppose it has taken me much thought, to decide what to do, and why I
should suddenly decide to pack it all in and return to my place of birth. 
 
I have many reasons, some of which I'll share, some of which I wont share,
and some of which I don't even understand myself............ 
 
I will start by saying that after 20 years in Los Angeles, another 4 plus
in San Francisco, I'm just fed up with California. 
 
I'm fed up with people being so petty and trivial, over issues that don't
mean squat in the bigger picture of things, that it takes up so much space
on my computer.  
 
Now I am not comdeming anyone who is a member of SFRaves, but I can't
believe the back and forth nit picking over subjects that give me a
head-ache......coming from such a small segment of our community. 
 
Topics like..............you should do drugs/should'nt do drugs/ whats a
raver supposed to be or act like/ who makes money/ who can spell/ who
donates in the name of raving/ who doesn't / who is involved with who/ why
my justification is better than yours/ why your opinion is worthless/
etc.... 
 
 literally name calling and bull s**t like this turns my stomach. 
 
now in the uk people are so busy being creative and doing there own thing,
that nobody has the time to point fingers at others, no one has time to
talk shit about what so &so is  or isn't doing, nor do people have the time
to wallow in other peoples misery. 
 
I'm sorry, but watching this so called community go back and forth over
trivial issues and balderdash, has got me thinking......... who the f**k
wants to hang out in a place like that, when the options are open to go to
a place where people treat each other with a little more dignity and
respect. 
 
a place where conversation is more about meaningful dialog, and uplifting
subjects, not rabble about so & so this & so & so that. 
 
this is not to say we don't have meaningful dialog in SF, there is plenty
of happenin and cool vibes goin down, it's just gone underground.......I
thought we were the underground......... when did this shift happen, was it
while I was gone ? 
 
No, it's just that I saw a different perspective, and it opened my eyes as
to how shallow, narrow, and one dimentional we (sf scene/sfrave etc...) 
seem to have become........from time to time.... 
 
I hope to get blasted for saying such controversial subjects, & things so
openly to all of you at the same time, I hope to see 500 posts, replying,
saying I must be wrong, look at the bright side.....and that I'm full of
shit.....by all means prove me wrong. I want so bad to be wrong........ 
 
I really love the drum machine thread, this is the kind of positive vibe
and creativity that S.F. can offer........ well done to all those involved
in trying something new and refreshing......... you lead the way for all of
us...... 
 
I have other reasons that make me homesick for the uk, the festivals, the
historical aspect of the uk, food, the multitude of musical creativity, The
fact that being broke is O.K, because every one else is broke
too............I don't know , I just can't explain it in words, it's a
feeling I have when I'm there.......peaceful, like I belong, like I have
something to discover there........ 
 
So I will be leaving in about 2 months (actually 7 weeks)...... I hope to
party with as many of you as I can before I go....... 
 
please understand, that I am not using SFR as the excuse as to why I'm
going, it is just one small percentage of my reasoning......... I feel like
I landed in the wrong place..... 
 
I'm trying to enjoy the community, and look for the good side of things,
but I am having trouble seeing it......... as usual it probably has as much
to do with me as it does the way I percieve S.F.        but I'll tell you
this, the love and feeling I had 3-4 years ago, seems to have slipped away
with the sands of time.......... London gives me that feeling
now.............thus my desision to continue to follow my heart and
dreams.....

[ to sfraves ]

Given his present state of mind and course of action, Moonpup may have 
been too shy or modest to mention this after his recent posts , but 
he's spinning tonight (thursday) at the club funktion. He will be playing 
his stuff in the trip hop room , although I think he will be spinning a
somewhat wider style of music than just stricly trip hop.

 Here's the info on Funktion from the SFRaves calendar -

Funktion - house, dub w/DJs guest DJs weekly. free before 10pm
   9pm-2am, $5. Maritime Hall, 1st & Harrison, SF. 415.273.5308

 I called the number , and the other DJs tonight are ( in the main
room ) Tracy and Buck ( Buck being a DJ from since the early Toon
Town days ) , and Moonpup and Tom in the Dub/Trip Hop Room

 So, if you go tonight, say hello and/or hug Mr. Moonpup while he's
still in tha' States !

Hi all,

My name is deeje, and I've been reading this mailing list for about a 
week now.  Yeah, there may be some trivial topics floating around, but I 
am encouraged by the sense of community here in No.Cal.  Way cool!

My brother raves down in SoCal and got me into it just a few weeks ago.  
I've lived in the bay area for about two years, but still haven't found a 
place to hang.  Looks like, with SFRaves, my search might be over.

Anyway, my bro is visiting this weekend, and we're hoping to meet you all 
there at Harmony.  So, if you see two guys just hangin' out at Harmony, 
it might just be us. :-)

Howdy, just wondering if you're still interested in selling me tapes.  I
don't know if you were turned off by the price, but if so, I hope we can
work something out.
Perhaps you'd be interested in selling some master tapes on DAT?
Since you're moving to the UK, it might be easier that way to get your
tapes spread around down here.  They are so into mixtapes here in LA
it's scary!
Anyway, let me know.
THanks!

I think people take this list a little bit too seriously.  I'm not pointing out any one person, I'm just using the word 'people' in a general sense.

There's always talk of 'family' on this list.  And although I do feel close to a good number of you, and we are a family in a sense, it will never be the same 'closeness' I feel toward (Blood) family members.  This last weekend, my brother-in-law decided to end his life.  And it has made me really think about families and relationship with other people and communication with family members and being a better family member....it goes alot deeper, but I wont go into that.  

Anyways, my point being, take this list with a grain of salt. IMO,  Its entertainment.  It makes my fairly mundane testing job a little more intertaining.  Everybody on this list has VERY strong opinions.  And they'll fight to the death to make them fact.  its fun to watch.  way better than TV.

.........just MY random ramblings. 

I dont think I'll EVER unsubscribe to this list.  Its just way too much fun! :)

	Most of the people involved in this discussion are members of 
collectives that put on low cost raves. Whether this falls into your 
definition of "your rave promoters", I don't know. Many of the people 
involved are trying to break this whole division between promoter 
and party goer because it fosters a consumer feel to parties and that 
adds to a commerical vibe. These happen to be low cost parties, and many 
of them free parties in which we only hope that when something needs to 
be done, we can ask the people there to help. This used to happen a lot 
more - all the full moons with people jumping to help teardown and haul 
speakers up to the truck to head back to Berkeley marina. Granted, people 
are probably going to act a little differently at free parties because 
the exchange of money tends to put people immediately into consumer mode.

This is another reason why some of us examine motives behind throwing 
parties. If we are talking about community, what is that suppose to mean? 
That we are all working toward a common goal, not really. That we all have 
the same set of ethical values. Not the exact same, but hopefully a 
similair set. That we can all live under the same piece of sky? Probably. 
Commerical events that are there first and foremost to make a buck are 
businesses and to a certain extent, opposite of direction that some 
organizers are moving with their parties by keeping that party 
goer/promoter separation. The vibe of a party where you remove the party 
goer/promoter separation is inheriently different. If you look at parties 
as a source of income rather than a gathering of people, this discussion 
is most likely completely foreign to your conception of "raves".
 
So please, instead of driving party-er vs. organizer into everyone's head 
who has not had a chance to help out, let's just get shit done when it 
needs to be done... If you are looking for recongition for what you do 
besides that it helped a party go off, maybe you should look into 
devoting your time somewhere else to something that will bring this 
external recongition to you. If a good job is done, people will know it. 
Assuming otherwise also assumes that no one has the ability to look 
around and make their own decisions.

>  If you you think you can do a better job than PUT UP OR SHUT UP!!!

	I find this to be extremely rude. Some people around here do a
different and sometimes, in my opinion, better job, but that is something I
arrived at through my little tinted perceptions. Each person has a right
to ask questoins. Some questions are based on ignornant assumptions and
hopefully these ignornant assumptions will be exposed and the individual
in question will watch out for the same type of assumptions in the future,
but how else these assumptions going to be exposed if the questions are 
not asked?

Anyway, enough dribble. Hopefully everyone got something out this...

Sorry folks, that last one was meant for Moonpup, not the entire list.
Actually, we are constantly searching for new tapes, so if anyone is
interested in selling tapes to us, we're interested!
Some criteria:
1) no trainwrecks!
2) Please have them professionally duplicated.  Call 1-800-977-TAPE for
a great tape duplication service.  They'll give you the lowdown on what
to do.
3) Full color J-cards are a must!

Thanks kids!

Upon reading Moonpup's post I felt a surge of familiar feeling.  I was
reminded of the day that fell two weeks after I signed on to sfraves back
in Jan.  I had eargerly awaited the two week no-post zone and was anxious
to contribute to the  community that I had finally discovered.  A
community of intelligent, loving, liberal-minded, subversive people that I
thought I could instantly be a part of.  I felt accepted before I had
uttered a single word.  I posted. I believe I was commenting on something
Geoff White had said about the Martin/Gathering stuff.  And to my utter
disbelief, Jon Lee attacked me, all full of indignation and rage, with
his threat to "Put a piece of Lead pipe Up youR ass.".  I guess you could
say I became a bit disallusioned at that point.  I still harbor feelings
of anger towards him right now, and I loath that.  Since than I have
posted very little, and am right now very hesitant to do so.  But,

  This is how I've felt since that day in January.  I hate to see Moonpup
go, he is a positive vibe I can always count on. He offers so much to our
community, and to see him go for these reasons truly fills me with an
overwhelming feeling of despondency.

"I have of late, but wherefore I know not, lost all my mirth, foregone all
custom of exercises, and indeed it goes so heavily with my disposition,
that this goodly scene sfraves, seems to me a sterile promentary, this
most excellent canopy the rave, seems nothing more than a foul and
pestilant congregation of Jon Lee's.

It is always sad when the actions of a few can affect the feelings of
so many.  Well not always.  Not every loud/incessant voice in the 
history of sfraves has been of the "negative" variety.  Unfortunately,
I think this list sometimes falls victim to the American cultural
characteristic of might-makes-right, where the louder, caustic,
persistantly critical voices are usually successful in crowding out
those of a more gentler and forgiving persuasion.  It's interesting to 
see how well folks in the Usenet group (yes Usenet) uk.music.rave get 
along.  They bring up the dreaded PLUR acronym all the time, and oddly,
no one feels the need to fly off the handle over this slogan that so
many here find oppressive.  And they actually seem to be able to go out
and have fun even if the party wasn't put together by their friends. 

But all here is not grim.
Once you've been on sfraves a while, things get quite
predictable and you tend to learn to accept that some of us are always
sharpening our knives, just waiting to make our point with the 2 or
3 issues that we have such selfrighteous bugs up our asses about.
These attempts at waking up the rest of the stupid ravers on the list
rile the few who haven't heard it before while everyone else yawns.

Anyway, it's just words.  Occasionally there's some useful info, but
none in this post, sorry.  So why am I writing this?  Because I have
work to do that I don't want to do and posting to sfraves is much
more entertaining.

ObRave: So what's this about Tribal Future happening on the weekend
of Oct. 12?  More info please!!!

Are you under some strange impression that TV "talk shows" are in some
way Christian? :-) :-)

The fundamentalists have always been in the forefront of those
attacking the TV talk shows....

As someone else mentioned, the ideology of TV talk shows is the most
holy rating point and the sacred advertiser dollar.

Dear Wayne,

I expected "I told you so" from your previous posts, but it really matters
little to me.  Allow me to repeat if you will ... it is my fervent belief
that if you aren't willing to represent your true self and explain and
defend your position, frankly as far as I -- that is me personally, nothing
collective about this -- am concerned, you are patently accepting whatever
anyone says about you.  And you deserve what you get, you have handed your
power to someone you don't even trust.

You want to summarily "ignore" the press?  Sorry, but I disagree 100% ...
if you don't feel confident enough about what you believe and who you are
to explain it IN PUBLIC to people who don't agree with you,then I think
there's something wrong.  It takes courage and conviction, but it has to be
done.

They can say anything they want to about me and the life I choose, but at
least give me a chance to express myself PERSONALLY about what affects me.
That is what happened on this show.  I can't control their venue, I can't
control what other people say, but I CAN control what I say about myself
and what I belive.

Nothing I said reflected negatively on our community, which was important
to me, and I know that, had I not been there, there would have been a large
gap in representing the positive sides of who we are.

And I have very strong feelings about both raving and parenting.

Wanna close your eyes and wish it goes away?  Sorry, don't look for me next
to you. And don't ask me to join you in assuming that all media is the
devil incarnate.  I believe that Leeza and her crew did the best that they
could coming from the perspective where they started.  If we don't show
them the truth, one step at a time, who will?

I've written a letter to the show expressing my concerns about the
potential harm and misinformation they may show -- and possibly it will
have some effect in their editing process.  Again, I can do my best, and
that's all I can do.  But at least I'm willing to stick my neck out and
try.  It's too important to me not to.

Leslie

p.s.  It would have been nice to talk to you personally when I saw you this
weekend about your perspectives rather than getting a copy of your email
the night before I left.  I would have welcomed your personal input.

Although the fundamentalist "leaders" may publicly attack the shows,
privately, they know they disseminate a lesson that no amount of 
preaching or pulpit-pounding could produce. Meanwhile, back at the
ranch, the flock is sheepishly sitting at home judging the fools that
go on these shows, trying to reconcile the warnings against degeneracy
made by their pastors with the exemplars of degeneracy they are seeing
on their screens. They can then recoil in mock shock, bleating "there
oughtta be a law..."

Since many talk show viewers rarely get out of the house (or rarely go
beyond the confines of the local mini-mall) to experience life first
hand, the shocking revelations cast onto their TV screens constitutes
enough information by which they can come to the conclusions that their
pastors (or the christian coalition, or dole, or clinton) are right.
This happens even if they don't know/experience any "degenerates" like
they've seen on the talk show, even though the percentage of people
acting in this way is a nearly invisible minority. The "manufactured
controversy" inflates the public perception of danger from such
enemies-from-the-inside, and the next thing you know, there are many
uncessesary laws being passed intruding on people's private, moral
choices.

Combined with a prohibition-like conservative moral agenda being set
for this country, the talk-shows are springboards of "manufactured
controversy" used to rally the masses to support a moral agenda that
they would otherwise not care about. That's why I would never do them
the favor of letting them USE me to twist the truth and manufacture a 
political message for the masses.

That's my opinion. You may disagree.

Danger Will robinson Danger!!!!!!!

There's heroin out there!!!

I was just watching one of these old "lost in Space" shows

Anyways-

I read an artical in THE VALLEY TIMES (a paper for the
Pleasanton/Dubin/Livermore area) about Heroin supply in this country.  I
couldn't find the artical at hope but I'm sure I can dig it up some where.

Well it said that the majority of the heroin coming into the US is now
through the columbian drug lords rather than from china.  Because of this
more heroin is coming into the country for cheaper prices and at a higher
purity.  (0% some times as compared to 70% - 80%  (I have to check the
artical to see if these are correct numbers).

Because of this high purity heroin is now being snorted and smoked rather
than injected and is either now or soon to be as great a drug threat as
Coke.  These colubia lords are pushing the H on to their customes and
inturn they are pushing more heroin.  Result: a rise in heroin supply on
the streets that can be taken ORALLY because of the purity.

IF there is more access to H at a cheaper price, with a higher purity it
COULD BE POSSIBLE for H to be in E.  BUT!!!!!!  As Black Adder and others
have stressed before::::  Don't believe the hype until you have SOLID
proof/ tests.


Be care full out there and when I get a hold of the actuall artcal I'll
post it to those who are intereste.

Thanks for the bandwith

for the love of god, please end this thread now. next thing you know well 
be getting panicked e-mail that someone is lacing the "good times" virus 
with heroin. i'm giving up, since it's clear, facts or no, that some 
people really *want* to believe dealers are spiking e with smack. 

i'll end with one last tidbit though. okay, you're a shyster selling e. you 
want to cut it. you want people to still think it's e (at least enough 
that they won't come after you). you want to do it cheap. you have two 
choices.

choice a is a cheap, easily found amphetamine that, while not providing all 
the "benefits" of e, will keep people guessing for a little while, and 
probably dupe the inexperienced.

choice b is an opiate that bears no similarity to e, and (if it even 
worked) would pretty much negate the tiny amount of e you, oh so 
generously, left in the cap. noone is fooled and certainly noone is 
coming back for anything but an argument.

you do the math...

Sorry to make a private response public, but if I'm willing to defend what
I believe on tv against people who I can expect to be skeptical about my
sincerity and credibility explaining something I believe in strongly, then
I damn better be willing to do it in a forum like this ...

I have no regrets about doing the Leeza Show. If it has a positive effect n
just a few people, it's worth it to me.  This will be my last post
"defending" myself on SFRaves, though, I don't see it as appropriate or
productive.  Personal conversations are welcome, though, I'll be at
Harmony, and have lots of interesting stories to tell.


To Niels,

I don't think i've ever met you, have I?  Maybe we should meet some day and
you can judge me on personal experience, and decide for yourself if I meet
your obviously high expectations of a someone who might do "a halfway
decent job of explaining anything in a cogent and reasoned manner"....

Sorry, but I find your cynical attitude sad, and I hope it isn't contagious
... since I haven't managed to catch it from the people I've had to
encounter in my 42 years so far, and I'd hate to see it extend to the other
positive-spirited friends I value so much.

And sorry again, but I think cynicism is more of the cause of what's
"fucked up" in this world, rather than some sort of protection against the
bad people you think are all out to ruin you.  Cynicism is based on a core
belief that the cynic is smarter and more "right" than anyone else, and it
usually incorporates an unhealthy dose of intellectual arrogance.  I find
that viewpoint incompatible with a fundamental respect for other people.
Yep, I'm idealistic, but I'm one of the most realistic people you'll ever
meet.  And I'm also rarely disappointed by expecting the best from people
or situations.

Your post may be further evidence that we see the world as a reflection of
ourselves; if it really represents what you're about, that's too bad.  I
like my mirror better because it has a smile and an open mind reflected in
it.

Leslie

p.s.  I'm not particularly litigious, so I hope you're not disappointed if
I choose not to sue them. Lucky for you, because as far as public
defamation... hmm.  And no, I didn't get paid... not that I couldn't use
the money, but it seems to me that if people get paid to go on talk shows,
it might make someone question their credibility and their motivations,
don't you think?  Then you would have called me not only a "fool" and
possibly a "clown and doofus" (or was that not me you were including in
your sweeping generalizations?) but also an opportunistic sellout.

ELECTRIC SKYCHURCH--- FUCK YEAH!!

I saw Electric Skychurch live at the three year party for Moontribe in SoCal.
Unbelieveable live performers, they play totally beautuful, incredibly
danceable Tribal/Ambient with great energy. They have a live singer, Roxanne
Morganstern, who has a voice that'll cleanse your soul, send you into orbit,
and make you believe in angels. I highly suggest that anyone who has the
chance to see these people live do so.  I saw them in May and I still smile
when I tell about the experience. (I was nearly sober when they played) Their
CD "Together" gets a lot of play when I need a fix of pure quality.

I need to get to Harmony, but I don't know this area yet! Could someone give
me a clue as to where Housewares and Solid Grooves are located. Isn't one of
them in San Jose? I'll be driving through there this afternoon on my way to
Sacramento. I would really like to make this my first event in the area,
since y'all can't seem to stop  talking about how it's going to go off. 

Looking forward to meeting everyone!

From: prashkin@wavenet.com (Peter Rashkin)
Subject: My vacation, the Headwaters Redwood Forest, and Neoliberalism

Jerry Brown is talking about the Headwaters Redwood Forest all this week.
Please try to listen: Pacifica Radio. In LA, KPFK, 90.7, 4 pm; in San
Francisco/Oakland, KPFA, 4 pm; in Houston, at 6, I think; in New York at 7.

The Headwaters is a remote redwood forest in Northern California. It is the
largest privately held redwood forest in California (in other words, in the
world...this giant, tallest of all trees, grows only in coastal northern
California and southern Oregon). For a long time it was owned by the
Georgia-Pacific Lumber Co., which trashed its share of the forest but
wasn't in a hurry to harvest every scrap of old growth timber. Plus there is
a strong and old environmental movement in the area. Then it was bought by
speculators; financed by junk bonds, with the intent to turn a quick profit.
I'm not sure, but I'll bet this happened during the "business-friendly"
Reagan administration.

Environmentalists, logging interest, the government...they've been going
back and forth in the courts and the legislature. I can't remember the
details. Now the owner (someone owns this priceless bit of earth spirit)
says that he's going to cut the trees to pay off his junk bonds if the
government doesn't come up with the bucks instead.  Next week, I think.
Jerry says the president can stop it and will if the people put pressure on
him. I hope so.

AS IT HAPPENS, I was just through Northern California last week, and I
stopped and walked a bit in one of the publicly owned redwood groves, so I
have a very fresh memory of the coast redwoods. If you've never been there,
I can't convey the magnificence of this environment. You stand in the middle
of these 300-foot towering wise old trees, some of them more than 2000 years
old. In a way it's like being in a great cathedral, or at Teotihuacan...it's
old, it's sacred, it's grand. But it's also alive, so it's a temple to life.

Not only the redwoods, but old growth forests everywhere are threatened
because they are the most profitable to harvest and now, finally, we have
the technology to really mow them down.

That a forest like this should be chopped up to turn a quick profit is
horrific. It's like Cortes melting down the intricate Aztec jewelry to make
gold bars. It's a crime against humanity. And I'm afraid it is an excellent
example of what is being done the world over under the banner of neoliberalism.

(Not everyone knows the term "neoliberalism." It is quite easy to explain;
it's merely the modern term for colonialism. Besides the term, some of the
methods and institutions and much of the rhetoric have changed, at least
superficially. And the pirates, who rule not only the seas but all the
intervening lands, wear suits and ties instead of bandanas and eye patches.)

(In the US the new generation of pirates is even returning to the old
practice of exploiting people...they've built prison construction and
operation into a fine, profitable growth industry providing good jobs to
thousands of people and stimulating local economies.)

I fear this is what is happening everywhere, all over the world, all at
once...nothing has value if it doesn't generate money. A standing old growth
forest has almost no value...cut down it is worth a fortune. These ancient
communities of living beings have grown here together in a slow, slow dance.
To walk in a forest like this is unforgettable; the experience is
intellectual, scientific, emotional, spiritual, sensual. You can't spend an
hour in the midst of this energy and come out unchanged. "In wildness is the
preservation of the world," Thoreau wrote. How much is preservation valued
on the market?

The old forest is not the only great ancient irreplaceable community that is
endangered because it is not profitable while it lives. The ancient
communities of man no longer have value, in the neoliberal sense of the
word. Ancient tribal and village ways of life are endangered because they
don't produce a sufficient return. Only factory farms and factory people
make any sense at all in the neoliberal value system. Isn't this the story
of Chiapas, where the Maya Indians have been pushed further and further onto
the physical margins, the least favorable lands, as each niche in turn
became exploitable? And now, thanks to the wonders and irrefutable logic of
the market, it is ALL exploitable!

As long as cash flow is the criterion for setting policy, the old growth is
doomed, and maybe the soul of man is, too. That's why the Zapatista call for
an international movement for humanity and against neoliberalism is so
important to us here, everywhere.

IF YOU CAN, try to join Jerry Brown in Oakland Friday afternoon, or over the
weekend in Northern California. Or in Houston, where another protest is
happening. Or do one in your forest or city hall. Or fax Clinton. Or send
him email at <president@whitehouse.gov>, if you think it will do any good
(Jerry seems to).

But if the cutting isn't stopped, please be aware of what we are
losing--perhaps as early as next week--and be sad for our poor planet and
all its poor souls.

Don't take life so seriously, you'll never get out of it alive...  
And if I took this list 1/10th as seriously as my life, I'd be in aignst all
of the time.
Yes, there is still an underground.  Yes, there still is a purpose for you in
this life.  Yes there is a path we all must take that is exclusive to
ourselves, and no, I dont think any other forum except face to face is where
it should be discussed...  So till then, don't take everything to heart...

I used to be much more of a cynic than anyone I have ever encountered.
My cynicism new no bounds, and it grew until I became cynical of my
own cynicism.  I think that was around the time I discovering raving.

Most cynics choose their targets carefully so that they have a very
good chance of being "right".  It's just as much a feel-good self-hug
approach to the world as the starry-eyed optimist's.  Too bad it can
be such a downer for everyone else.

Most ravers I know are aware that the world is pretty fucked up.  But 
rather than whine about all the bad, they prefer to focus and support 
what seems to be good.  This seems more constructive to me, and not too 
hard because there really is a lot of "good" out there (including 
"hope").  Each of us is free to choose our illusion.  YMMV

A year ago, I would never have though that I would ever be at a rave
in a Christian church, dancing to DJ Tracy in the early morning next 
to a 70 year old Bishop who was also "getting it".  Cynicism nearly
prevented me from experiencing this.  Lately, I've decided that
there are some things that are more important than being right.

Just another pretentious sermon from 

Lee

I fully agree with this statement:

| The wonderful thing about the asshole who owns the pertinent portion of
| the Headwaters Forest is that he's "liquidating" the asset to help pay for
| a failed savings and loan he operated in Texas.   
| 
| Now he's holding the forest ransom for more than it's worth commercially.
| 
| This guy is truly a scumbag.  Some people truly deserve to be shot.

There's an article in the SF Chron "Bay Area" section from today on
this scumbag-like action on the part of Charles Hurwitz of Texas. This
suit-wearing-scumbag who is described as a "master negotiator with
nerves of steel" is threatening to start harvesting these 2000 year old
trees unless the government drops the $ 1.6 Billion debt he owes for
the failure of his Texas S&L.

The sad thing is that this kind of morality-free no-holds-barred
deal-making is pervasive in financial/business/banking circles. Once
you enter into this realm, they claim you have to be "cold and steely
and uncaring" in order to "do business." I disagree.

Dear Rave Friends,

	The story of the Headwaters Forest is not quite so one-sided as
the below post might lead one to believe.  The company that owns it has
had the legal right to log for some time, in fact the land is zoned by the
government to be used exclusively as timber land (makes you glad for 
wonderful things like zoning laws, eh? <--sarcasm).
	My understanding is that they've deliberately put off logging in
the hopes that a solution can be reached that does not force them to take
a bath on their investment.  They have indicated a willingness and
flexibility to be compensated in the form of other government-owned land
elsewhere in exchange for Headwaters, but officials have resisted this,
perhaps in the hopes that they will be allowed to legally steal Headwaters
from its owners as the environmentalist lobby, Jerry Brown, and Neils are
urging.
	I don't know how much the Headwaters forest is valued at in the
marketplace, but I'd be willing to chip in a few dollars to buy it.  If
everyone so eager to violate the Bill of Rights (which protects us against
government taking our property without just compensation) would just pony
up some cash themselves, I'm sure the lumber interests would sell to us,
since that's what they've been trying to negotiate for years now.

Shawna,

Count me IN!!  I've been twice and it is super fun.  The Exploratorium is
marvelous, too.  I love where you can jump infront of this camera and it
leaves your shadow outline on this background and then slowly fades away!!

Starchild -- there are multiple viewpoints on this subject. I am willing
to accept yours as long as you're willing to consider that you may
not have all the information at hand (i'll admit the same).  The issues
here go way beyond your statement here:
| everyone so eager to violate the Bill of Rights (which protects us against
| government taking our property without just compensation) would just pony
| up some cash themselves, I'm sure the lumber interests would sell to us,
| since that's what they've been trying to negotiate for years now.

The government did not take the first step here. Rather, Hurwitz  faced
with paying a 1.5 BILLION DOLLAR (note, that's a lot of money) debt
back to the government for his investment/management fuckups that the
government bailed him out of via FDIC payments to his savings and loan
customers. He then said "hmmm... i think i'll up the ante here and
claim I'll mow down an old growth forest if the government forces me to
repay my debts -- that'll put the government in a compromising position
between "green" voters/constituents and their desire to get
recompensated for my debts." 

The problem is that Hurwitz wants to charge far more than this land is
worth because he is in deep doo doo debt-wise. He's basically saying
the only way he'll sell is if the govt cancels out his debt entirely.
Otherwise he won't sell the land, just mow the trees and sell them,
which is actually more profitable than the value of the land.

This is especially egregious because he CRIMINALLY FUCKED UP by
investing his S&L customer's money in junk bonds and happened to get
this property as part of some other leveraged-with-funny-money biz-deal
swindle. Now, he needs the extra cash to pay back the FDIC and bail
himself out of junk bond debt. Instead of taking responsibility for his
fuckups, he's now sticking it to the government and the people of the
US -- I'm sure he's saying "it's just business" but I think he should
be prosectuted as an extortionist now, and should have been thrown in
jail long ago and had all his property confiscated to repay his debts.
But that kind of treatment is only reserved for drug dealers or
"dead-beat dads" -- if you're a wealthy businessman swindling retirees
out of their life-savings, then you're rewarded w/ a government
bail-out and a pardon by Jeb Bush (George Bush's son).

Please note this message posted to another private list that I received
(and am forwarding w/o attribution). There is a "right to life" issue
going on here that goes way beyond profits.

--------------------

Yeah, I've been following this issue for some years now.  I wrote a letter
to Cal. Dept. of Forestry & US Forest Service in 1990.  My understanding is
as follows (probably missing details) - Hurwitz bought out a fairly
decently-run family business called Pacific Lumber.  Not that they were
disciples of sustainability, but they understood the economically sound
concept of replenishing the resource.  And now he has defaulted on junk
bonds, and also calls the shots for the company.

Now the technology is available to mow like never before.  And this ransom
of priceless wilderness is no less than a mortal crime against humanity and
the earth.  I do not know of a more vile individual living or dead than this
ruthless "businessman."

It was a pleasure to read the description of the old growth forest mystique.
These forests are characterized by a surprisingly open understory - a
magical park with massive diameter trees towering above sparsely-scattered
big-leaved shady plants.  It cannot be replicated without ~1,000 years of
ecological succession.  More precious than gold.  Worth fighting to the
death for.

     Neils... I've never met you, but I heard you loud and clear...
     
     Sensational talk shows do suck... they weren't always like that... but 
     then they saw the rating the born and bred in the USA morality 
     hotheads get.  It's what America wants.  Leeza does seem a little 
     mellower than most (don't really know, but I haven't heard about her 
     getting her nose broken lately)... maybe she was a lesser of several 
     evils call.
     
     But could we take a deep breath here?
     
     I'm sick of the 'Cyber paranoid' bulls&#t, and maybe it would be 
     refreshing to see someone who isn't dressed like a speed fed clubber 
     who happens to be a young male 18-24 backing up our scene in front of 
     a lens to a public who couldn't ever really understand.
     
     The typical media presentation of raving might be cruel, puritan, or 
     what have you... the amazing thing about raving is how many faces it's 
     capable of presenting.  The only exposure I think we should be bashing 
     (verbally) are f^@kups like the drug dealer from Miami who stepped 
     forward and said that raves are cool because you can sell mass drugs.  
     That's what will make it worse.  Not much else can by the way...
     
     Historically, there are some personalities that have been able to make 
     a statement that shot right by the editors, and right into the hearts 
     and minds of some people that needed to hear it.  We can hope that 
     Leslie made it past the force fields.
     
     For too long, the geniuses have lurked in the corners prophesizing 
     media fueled doom, while the f^@kups talk right into the camera.  
     Looks like we got somebody who knows what they're talking about for a 
     change acting as a spokesperson (albeit for only a few choice 
     seconds), and you're so ready to bash the f^@k out of her effort to 
     shine some light on something that has brought us ALL this much joy, 
     adventure, and fascination.
     
     Before you rush to the reply feature to bang my skull against a rock 
     until I realize how insightful you are, please find out how good/bad 
     it really is.  I'll wait for the show to air if you will.
     
     Raving is nothing.  It's about as hard to quantify as love or the 
     difference between a polite kiss and a loving kiss.  When laws were 
     passed to limit the playing of repetitive 4/4 music in Britan, artists 
     started coming out with Drum and Bass and use of different breaks, and 
     other modifications that allowed the scene to flourish past that.  
     It's being together.  Sometimes it's a BBQ.  It's not always at night. 
      It's not always in a warehouse.  The people aren't always my cup of 
     tea.  Sometimes it's about driving Crunchman's car through the 
     mountains for 3 hours looking for a party that might not exist.  
     Sometimes the music sucks.  Sometimes it's 20 people and sometimes 
     it's 20,000.  It's about spontaneous community, dancing, loving, 
     sharing and a positive sense that if I smile at you, you will 
     understand.
     
     I respect what Leslie did.  Maybe it will go off and maybe it won't.  
     It's better than not saying anything and letting them determine their 
     own reality.
     
     What would you say if you were in front of the camera Neils and were 
     asked for something positive to say, without censors, to America at 
     large?  To the sleeping, to the blind, to the arrogant, to the cruel, 
     to the greedy...
     
     It might not be that big a deal.  It's nice going to a place were 
     people are a little nicer for a change.  I like to dance, and be 
     freakish.  I'd hate to see it fall apart.
     
     I'm glad we're trying.
     AndyW

Although the fundamentalist "leaders" may publicly attack the shows, 
privately, they know they disseminate a lesson that no amount of 
preaching or pulpit-pounding could produce. Meanwhile, back at the 
ranch, the flock is sheepishly sitting at home judging the fools that 
go on these shows, trying to reconcile the warnings against degeneracy 
made by their pastors with the exemplars of degeneracy they are seeing 
on their screens. They can then recoil in mock shock, bleating "there 
oughtta be a law..."
     
Since many talk show viewers rarely get out of the house (or rarely go 
beyond the confines of the local mini-mall) to experience life first 
hand, the shocking revelations cast onto their TV screens constitutes 
enough information by which they can come to the conclusions that their 
pastors (or the christian coalition, or dole, or clinton) are right. 
This happens even if they don't know/experience any "degenerates" like 
they've seen on the talk show, even though the percentage of people 
acting in this way is a nearly invisible minority. The "manufactured 
controversy" inflates the public perception of danger from such 
enemies-from-the-inside, and the next thing you know, there are many 
uncessesary laws being passed intruding on people's private, moral 
choices.
     
Combined with a prohibition-like conservative moral agenda being set 
for this country, the talk-shows are springboards of "manufactured 
controversy" used to rally the masses to support a moral agenda that 
they would otherwise not care about. That's why I would never do them 
the favor of letting them USE me to twist the truth and manufacture a 
political message for the masses.
     
That's my opinion. You may disagree.

Dear. Mr. Pup,

Interesting dillema here.  I've been thinking a lot about the identities we
carry online, and it seems like for a lot of this, the anonyninymoty (!) of
being hidden behind a keyboard brings some interesting things out of our
psyches.   The ideal behind electronic communication is that it helps us
break down our prejudices.  I.E., we are experiencing a person for their
thoughts, without regard to skin color, sex, sexuality, attractiveness, or
whether or not we wear baggy jeans.
I think this aspect of it still works magnificiently, but along with it,
something a bit uglier has  risen.  Being a voice to 450 pairs of ears
isn't necessarily a humbling experience, if you're the sort of person who
likes to fly off the handle.  But then again, if you're the type who likes
to spread good vibes, then this is the perfect breeding ground.

I'm curious: was your experience with the British ravers online or at
parties?  I have a suspicion that for many of us, a louder, darker, side
comes out when we log-on...something that we don't normally express,
because we've been trained over the years about proper etiquette in public.
For example, I honestly can't remember the last time some told be to
bugger off! or shut the frick up! to my face...but I see it everyday
online.  Meet those same people at a party, start the same conversation,
and it will probably go a lot smoother.(I guess because it's harder to get
your fanny kicked through a computer if you say the wrong thing.)

Also, people with computers have the chance to go back and revise...seems
like this could lead to a manic passion to be as witty and sharp as
possible, leading to more arguments. And I think that we have a tendency to
take the written word more seriously than the spoken.  For example,
sometimes say to my buddies, "ah, fuck off!" and don't really mean it.  The
written word just sort of sits there on your screen and drills a hole in
your head, making it seem as if it's much more ominous than it really is.


What I think it boils down to, is that we're all savages inside (What I
mean is, we're wild, impulsive, instinctual, defensive, and on the prowl
for a fight.) Most of us have spent our lives learning to act civilized.
Now that we're online, we've sort of been set free from the laws of
etiquette, and it will probably take us some time to learn how to be
civilized again.  (I don't think this applies to *everyone*...some of us
are just cute and snuggly by nature, some of us are not.)

But we all have one thing in common...

Boom Boom Boom Boom     Boom Boom Boom Boom    Boom Boom Boom Boom

If we stick together we'll work it out.


Catch me next time,

b))merang fidget

p.s.  I remember dropping into a club on Oxford street in London in 1990,
seeing a bunch of crazy kids in striped shirts and glow sticks, thinking
"what the *hell* is going on here with these loopy kids?"  I only stayed
about 10 minutes...Two years later I went to my first party in the US, and
said to myself,   "Nowww I get it!"

        Reply to:   Harmony crew questions?

High there all you happy people,
My name is Jason, and Greg and I started Harmony three years ago.  He is currently running around like a crazy man organizing things, while I'm currently working my butt off like a crazy man.  That makes us both: CRAZY MEN : )  WOO HOO!!!  Anyway, anybody actually WORKING at the party, setting up, etc., can e-mail me with any questions.  I paged Greg a little while ago, but he has not called me back yet.  I have to get SOLID directions to the location from him (mine have become a little vague) as well as kind of an all around scoop (times, parking, etc.) to give everyone involved, so I may not be able to fully answer your questions until I hear back from him, but I assure you I will respond eventually.  So, bring em' on, and I'll talk to you all soon!  (and see you all tomorrow!)
Happy trails....
_jason_

A question has come up on the drum machine circle list that noone has
been able to answer. We are toying with the idea of using Golden Gate
Park during the day as our location, but we don't know what the
applicable laws are concerning sound and amplification.

Can we legally use the park as our location? Is there a certain
volume limit that we should keep to?

It would really suck to get shut down after plugging everything
together and getting hyped up, so any advice would be most
appreciated.

cu@h3!:)

 If we just go by his immediate follow-up message, he apologized and
said that was actually him and his friend screwing around with email.
It was not meant to be serious or for SFRaves. Take that as you will.
Anyway, if it is true, let's give the guy a break now! He's been razzed
enough.

        Some alleged answers to Starchild's questions are on a front page
Chronicle article today.  But his characterizations are inaccurate as well,
not that I know the full picture either.

        The logging rights -- for salvage timber, which is supposed to mean
in this case only trees that have already fallen, not standing trees --
only kick in next Monday.  The company hasn't yet had the right to log it,
but people knew for a while when the deadline was and that the company
would probably not be denied this "right" by last minute judicial appeals.
The government is offering something like $200 million for the land, and
the owner wants $500 million and is enjoying the increased leverage
afforded by the imminent deadline.  He also was involved in an S&L scandal
which cost over $1 billion and has been interested in a new form of "debt
for nature" swap, or a swap of other federal land.  The federal government
has been avidly negotiating with these people, offering serious money.
There is no evidence they want to "steal" Headwaters away. The political
pressure from the environmentalists is counterbalanced by the conservative
forces in-state, who, after all, are in charge of the Governorship &
Assembly. To its partial credit, the Wilson administration is not siding
with the owners, and wants a deal in principle to be reached that will
prevent logging next week, and commit the parties to some form of
arbitration to determine the "value" of the land.  This "value" would be
derived from some approximation of the worth of the trees as forest
products.

        As old-growth areas dwindle, the value of the land increases
dramatically, due to the low supply of forest land for either logging or
beauty.  If the owners could get as much by not logging as logging, of
course they should not log.  This problem will only get worse.

        I'd love to debate how environmental laws hardly violate the Bill
of Rights, or how there should be plenty of legal ways to control logging
due to its external effects on the larger environment (stream pollution,
flooding run-off, etc. -- ask the people in Oregon about this years killer
floods in early February in clearcut areas).  But let's keep that off that
list.  However, it is true that the owner has the right not to have his
land taken by the government without compensation.

	Word that could have come right out of my own mouth! :) I look back
at the "pre-rave" me now and i wonder where the connection is (there are
some, like i now listen to gabber instead of industrialdeathmetal but i'm
smiling as i bang my head ;).
	But doesn't this, what you've said (and what we've experienced)
point to something?  If there are now two people in the world that have
gone from cynicism to a "new" life then that means that there are two less
cynical people in the world.  Because of raving maybe, maybe because of a
little chemical help, & for me definitely from an admission that i was
"wrong" about things.
	I *wasn't* a realist, i was a pessimist.
	But these concepts, being relative like everything else, had to
have some "higher" or more "positive" mindset to bounce off of one's
regular mindset.  There's a saying (which i'm going to horribly paraphrase)
that says "in order for peace and joy to be realized, one must first know
that they exist."  If you're a cynic, a pessimist, you'd say that
light-grey is white and dark-grey is black, because you have a limited
scope of what's "real" because of the limiting conceptual boxes you put
onto experiences.  A "realist" can see a larger scope of the spectrum,
admitting the world is made up of opposites and doing a little
psychospiritual alchemy to transform the - into the + .
	I have much hope for the world in general, simply because i know
that i've turned out alright going from being perpetually negative to
someone who tries to aknowledge both ends of the spectrum, but only reflect
the most positive aspects into my words and behaviours and even thoughts.
And from my own experiences, i can extrapolate and wonder "how many other
people out there have had their lives and mindsets changed around because
of raving?" Evidently there's at least one other person out there! :)

>Most cynics choose their targets carefully so that they have a very
>good chance of being "right".  It's just as much a feel-good self-hug
>approach to the world as the starry-eyed optimist's.  Too bad it can
>be such a downer for everyone else.
	Most cynics are really insecure, i should know; i'm not only
president of Ex-Cynics Anonymous, i'm also a client ;)  Once you have a
grip on a sense of your REAL self, you don't find the need to tear other
people down.  Similarly, if you have a handle on the fact that "being
right" or getting pats on the back for your observations are ego-based and
arise out of these insecurities, then you don't feel bad about being
"wrong" because that's how you learn new things and stay dynamic (just like
the universe itself) :) And if anyone has a problem with what i just said
well...*sniff* *whine*...go take a flying leap at a rolling doughnut! ;)
	And yeah, i'd rather be around a "starry eyed e-head raver spouting
good intentions and platitudes" than someone constantly telling me "don't
bother, it ain't worth it, you'll fail, we're fucked, etc".  Evidently
other people feel similarly, explaining why i used to have so few friends!

>Most ravers I know are aware that the world is pretty fucked up.  But
>rather than whine about all the bad, they prefer to focus and support
>what seems to be good.  This seems more constructive to me, and not too
>hard because there really is a lot of "good" out there (including
>"hope").  Each of us is free to choose our illusion.  YMMV

	I agree, a glass of water is both half-full and half-empty
*simultaneously* so why not look at it as being half-full?
	I don't think it's a matter of denying anything, just a recognition
that there are always different and equally "true" perspectives to anything
and so why would you not choose to take on perspectives that are positive?
Even if it means that you're "wrong" or seem like a silly e-head
raver/hippy/whatnot, if it makes you feel good thinking good, why not?
Anything on the other end of the spectrum, imho, verges on masochism and i
don't know about y'all but i'm definitely closer to being a hedonist than a
masochist.

	Hmmm...then again, for some masochism is pleasurable. Oy! See,
multiplicity of perspectives in action! ;)

	The base of many of my attitudes is found in the idea of
"Morphogenetic Resonance" which is a theoretical approach to how species
communicate with each other with specific reference to how species evolve
new traits.  Theoretically, all members of a species communicate through a
gridwork of energy (which some may call the "collective
(un)consciousness"), if a critical mass of individuals in the species start
behaving in one way, that energy is put into the collective pool, and is
"downloaded" by the rest, affecting their behaviour.  So, theoretically, if
you have a large amount of positive-thinking people focussing on hope,
peace and joy, that will trickle down to the rest of the members of the
species.  Similarly, if you have a critical mass of people living a life of
pessimism and giving off "bad vibes" that will affect the way the rest of
the species in the system evolve.  Which one would you choose?  Would you
rather swim in the warm and fuzzy meme-pool or the one that looks like the
Exxon Valdez hit it?
	This is not only something that gives me "hope" for the future, but
also a sense of self-empowerment because if this theory is true, my own
thoughts have an impact on the rest of the collective and so there *is*
something that one person can do to change the world. :)

	peace
		brad


ps-->ulp! holy bandwidth. Maybe i should stick to just thinking about stuff

 If we just go by his immediate follow-up message, he apologized and
said that was actually him and his friend screwing around with email.
It was not meant to be serious or for SFRaves. Take that as you will.
Anyway, if it is true, let's give the guy a break now! He's been razzed
enough.

 

Oh....allright. I can't find my scrabble game anyway.

But if you investigate things really carefully, you'll find that to
the extent that the world is fucked up, it is only because of
negativity (aka fear).

Thus, the only real long-term solution for our problems is being
positive.

Which, oddly enough, doesn't mean being idealistic.   There is nothing
contradictory between being positive and being realistic....


Cheers,

Just thought I'd mention that if anyone wanted to BBQ anything specific
your encourage to bring it along. And if you have a favorite dish you like
to make, please bring it to share if you want. The more the merry, and full
stomachs too. You'll need to get some energy up for the night time to Dance
and do all that crazy stuff we like to do. There will be a very small sound
system near the BBQ for those to enjoy while eating and for those helping
with setup for one of this years best parties.

If your a DJ and have records and want to spin during the day bring them.
I'll put you on a list and see. There is no real lineup for the daytime
because the sound system is there just for our listening pleasure courtesy
of djTom. Please keep in mind that there might not be a spot, it will be
first come first serve. No pushing or shoving allowed : P  It's just going
to all be for fun during the day. So if you want to spin please come and
find me, I'll more then likely be sweating over the
BBQ...umm..welll..better not say sweating..I'll be at the BBQ, or just ask
someone that looks like there setting up who knucklehead is.


See ya all tomorrow.

Tim (knucklehead)

There may even be a fundamental truth to this.

A metaphysical argument can be made that Existence itself is a positive
thing because afterall, the sum total of all existence is more than
nothing.   Time moves forward.  Reality (even illusion) is an assertion.

I exist therefore I am.
I exist therefore I am positive.
I am positive that I exist.

Even if "I" am not sure what it is, "something" is sure that there
*is* some kind of existance.  So it seems that positivity resides
at the basis of conceptualization.

Perhaps that is why the experience of harmony with the world, or
getting in touch with our true essence, (or whatever terminology for
divine realization suits you) tends to feel good.

Leslie,

I am sorry you feel personally attacked. That is and was not my intent. My
intent that I attempted to convey was that it did not matter who or how
many went, our story would not be communicated through their editorial
grinder to the world. It saddens me to see you protecting them from this
criticism that they deserve. If they did a great job then why do even you
feel the need to write them a letter telling them that you weren't as happy
as you had hoped on the way things turned out? Again, I am not chiding you
for making a valiant effort in communicating our story. I myself try to
communicate to people outside our community how great we are on a daily
basis. But sometimes it doesn't work. And, after going to a *beautiful*
rave in the desert called Dune in So Cal (that HARD COPY did a totally
constructed and anti-rave baised story on) earlier this year, I have
learned to distrust mainstream media -- especially shows that have
sensationalization as their charter. That's why  I instinctively felt like
this may be one of those times.

We don't need traditional and in this case, pulp, media to convey our
story. They prove on a daily basis they are only there to use us. And 'us'
is not limited to the rave world. It's teenage unwed mothers, it's
transsexual hookers, it's feuding spouses and families, it's the problemed
of humanity. It's, unfortunately, basically any identifiable group that
appears on their shows.

So I have decided for my personal efforts, at least, that instead of
attempting to convert traditional media to viewing our world the way we do,
we should be spending all our energy of what we do best: Make music, spread
a positive vibe, throw parties, and be beautiful people wherever we go. If
that positive influence is always exhuded, people will follow, one at a
time.

And we already have partners for our movement in the media: They are the
countless underground record labels, they are mixtapes made by our friends.
They are URB, XLR8R, FIX, and others (in print) and great shows like FLUX
and now AMP on TV to move our message forward. They are Hyperreal and other
sites online decidated to a pure, honest communication. And best of all,
they are already on our side and free of anti-rave bias. Because of these
resources on our side, I find it very easy to summarily ignore the
mainstream media.

Sincerely,

wayne the happy raver

An interesting thought, however isn't reality free from the strictures of
our observations of it, that is to say reality just is? I remember a very
compelling argument being made by I forgot who, that the act of observing
anything, alters the thing itself.   

My head hurts... ;-)

Dear All & Thanks Mark;

	The way Tim worded his post made it sound like Harmony was actually
happening today, wow; never do e-mail when your half asleep. Anyway, I will
have two car seats available in the cosmic voyager for 2 aliens who NEED
one way/possibly two way transit to Harmony on Saturday.

like at least *some* of it is gonna be outdoors.

Me too.  When I hear "x" I think of its definition of "former" - as in 
"ex-wife, ex-lover, my ex", etc.

Pretty funny how you just gave your private mailing list to everyone

it's seems for real - nexis has a special voice-mail selection set up to
tell you that they aren't accepting requests to be removed by phone any
longer - you have to fax or snail-mail.  in my view, that is complete
bullshit, and i plan to call back and give somebody an ear-full of my
opinion on this sort of big-brother crap as soon as i have some time to
kill listening to hold music.

sometimes (like right now) i wonder whether computers are a blessing or
some sort of uber-conspiracy ...

YESSSSS!!!!

 Finally, Dionysus Dreams gets to play!! I'm talking full on Multi-Media!
I get to play during the break for Stella Luna (they have two 45 minute 
sets and are up first in the ambient room) and at about 4am. I do invite 
folks to come check out what I'm doing and to play with the toyz; just 
remember that if I'm playing I may be in "creative focuse" mode. Also, as 
I'm mixing sound for the live acts I may be really busy. And I'm coming 
down with something. :(

 Anyway, please be careful with flaming materials; the woods are VERY 
dry. We do have a designated smoking area outdoors next to the main dance 
room. It is an all concrete courtyard that is very nice!! Also please 
respect our hired and voluteer security. They are there to help us ;).


PEACE ALL!! I LOVE YOUSE GUYS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Look for me from midnight to 3am, selling water and spreading good

The correct fax number to remove your name from P-Trax is 513-865-1930
Don't bother calling; you need to fax your full name and complete address.

I wonder if they know my bra size, too...

Well then I would like to raise the number to 15, cuz if we have under 15
people, we won't get it all to ourselves, and we may then still end up with
too many people.  15 will insure that we get it all to ourselves. Originally
I would have liked 20 people, cuz that's the limit, but I'm getting so many
responses that it may be more practical to do it in two or more groups or
something like that.  In fact, we'll either have to do that, or just not let
some people in, which of course is no option.  But we'll see how many we
actually end up committing to it by $$ when it comes time.  That number may
be less than the actual number who have simply expressed interest.

I understand the folks in Bosnia are short on vowels, hence names like 
Chxrlk and Srynkv.  You should just donate those E's and any other spare 
vowels you have to the "Sv Bsn" (English translation: "Save Bosnia") movement.

Subject: The Media and Raving
Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

first off, there are so many complex, intermingled concepts involved with
this subject that we should all admit there are no "right" answers.  Let me
say, though, that I'm glad Wayne clarified himself, because I didn't think
he was personally attacking Leslie, but it wasn't as clear as it could've
been that he wasn't chiding Leslie for being "an accomplice" to the
"hanging" of the rave scene, as he put it.

I believe sfraves members take a more critical and measured view towards
the media than most americans.  We seem more inclined to question the true
motives behind the media (money, advocacy rather than neutrality).  Perhaps
we knew this before we raved, but the media's treatment of raving has
certainly revealed this to us.  At the same time, the media hasn't really
dealt with raving that much yet, but it seems to be doing so more in recent
months.

I also believe that many of us have a spiritual view of raving, and despair
that too many people don't "get" it.  We want people to know that ravers
aren't sex-crazy, druggy teenagers -- we are everywhere, we are members of
your family, friends, co-workers, neighbors, etc.  But the media isn't
telling people this.

What to do?

I myself have sympathies with both sides of the "say something/avoid it
entirely" debate, and the third option of "do it yourself."

I unfortunately admit that because of worries about workplace response I
find it convenient to avoid it entirely (well, other than here, as this
list can be considered as do-it-yourself "media" of a sort, but I'm fairly
certain that no one with whom I work is on sfraves, just those crazy Xinet
folks down the hall ;) ).  This may, frankly, be an overcautious worry
because I was an "out" Deadhead, and the worries they might have over that
status are similar to those about raving.

Ultimately, it really doesn't matter what we do.  None of us can predict
how the authorities will treat raving in the future, and I'm not convinced
that increased media coverage will doom us.  I do worry that media coverage
will usually be very negative, and that the authorities could use that as
an excuse to crack down harder.  Maybe I'm selfishly focusing on us, but I
am confident that most of the possible futures over the next few years in
the sf area will include phat raves, as the authorities here aren't so
crazed as to make going after us a big priority (despite a few reminders of
their power).  The same can't be said of the rest of the nation.

Do we avoid the media, because they will never treat us fairly?  Do we do
it ourselves?  Do we accept the inevitability of the media, and do our best
to have them report the positivity raves have on our lives?

I have no problem with people with people who love raving saying so in the
media, and I hope when they do so they do it well.   And given the
realities of the talk show scene -- which Wayne predicted fairly well --
and the fact that there was probably going to be this shitty show given the
show's premise and realities, I hope that Leslie provided any contrary
view, not that a balanced result occurred.  I know her motives were good,
and I hope she convinced at least one parent not to freak about their
child's raving.

Yet, I agree that no news is good news.  I had rarely heard of raves in the
media before I started raving last December, and I am a print media junkie
(a little less so now that I'm on-line).  I want people who love raving to
continue to be able to do so.  I want new people to come to the scene
without many preconceptions from the media, accurate or inaccurate, and
those who love it to feel encouraged to become part of the scene and
contribute their energy.  some new people will be attracted by the negative
sex and drugs coverage, and by any positive spirituality coverage too.
There is a danger from any media coverage of the scene of increasing the
size artificially; we all know there must always be part of the scene that
is underground and fairly small, alongside massives.  I don't think the
underground is exclusive, but by remaining underground it makes it
difficult for authorities who might oppose raving to get a handle on it.
This is true to a certain extent even where we control the coverage.

Too much media coverage of any sort could hurt the rave scene.  But
Leslie's appearance didn't increase the amount of coverage -- the show
would have gone on without her.  [But will there be the follow-up interview
in one of the free weeklies, Leslie  ;) ]

You know raving when you feel it, and no media coverage will ever make
someone "get it."  Just being ourselves is the best response.

Tomorrow, the final Harmony, will also mark the final appearance of one of
my favorite t-shirts.

Once upon a time all these Deadheads used to crash in my living room for
local shows, and inevitably stuff would get left with me (and stuff would
disappear).  It seems now that the stuff that was left there was meant for
me to not be interested in until I started raving.

My friend Brett's ex-girlfriend Jody left this white t-shirt with the Dead
skull on the front (the "Steal Your Face"), with a big, blue, happy Cookie
Monster in the skull.  On the back, it says "Steal Your Cookies."  When I
found it a couple weeks after everyone was gone (Leslie can attest to my
Cancerian mess of an apartment), I told Brett (who had by then broken up
with Jody) and he said I should just keep it.  But soon after Jerry died,
and the shirt wasn't my style at the time (why, I don't know).

Cut to a few months later, after I had started raving, and seeing and
enjoying so much Sesame Street imagery, and feeling more connected to my
childhood.   When I saw Cookie on Nancy's backpack at some rave, I
remembered the shirt, dug it out of the depths of my closet, and debuted it
at the Beautiful People with the stuffed baby Muppets on the flyer . . .
it's had a gleam in its eye since.

Of course, Brett now wants the shirt back, despite my reminders that he
already said I could have it and that it wasn't his in the first place (he
now says he gave Jody the shirt).  When he was back here visiting in June I
had to make a deal with him -- he got the shirt for a month, and then I got
the shirt back until the final Harmony (which by then was announced).  He
did live up to his end of the deal, and said he understood why I loved the
shirt so much, so I feel like I should give it to him (sigh).

But until then I plan on wearing the hell out of the shirt this weekend!

leftjab, extremely psyched for tomorrow!

p.s. random thoughts on the same page of the chronicle today -- if we get a
few more this year in the atlantic, there will be a Hurricane Omar . . .
and Sesame Street just announced that it will soon be on Russian TV.

p.p.s.  if you bring any cookies to Harmony, be careful ;)

I was hoping to find enough SoCal ravers interested in taking a trek north
for Harmony,   but only got one person from Simi valley,  but now HE backed
out,   so because of that,   my chances of making it are bleaker than
ever.    I'm really bummed that I cannot go,   as going it alone is not
going to be possible.    Besides,  I have to be back down here in SD by
5 pm Sunday for important Loft meeting.... Arghhh!!!

But hang on to my tix just in case,  at least until tmmorrow morning.
Well,  at least I'll be spinning some sick goa trance tonight for
a private party.

So,  last call for any SoCal raver who wants to make it to harmony
tommorrow....

Please phone me at the Loft at 619-696-9905,  ask for Crunch... If I cannot
make it,  look for me at Nocternal Wonderland...

I have seen people get busted for playing on a not-that-loud
soundsystem at Marx Meadows in GG park.  If I remember right there's a
picture of that on the Headtravel CD.  On the other hand you could get
a permit to play music at Dolores park.  I was at a concert a while
back there and it went OK.  It's sunny and there's lots of open space.
Not sure about the specific legalities, though.

David

P.S.  See if you can find me in the picture of the Dolores park
concert in the RE:search Zines book!

The ones responsible for most of the fucking-up rule by fear.
Dispell fear, and you take away their power.

Music and dance are excellent tools for dispelling fear,
and have been used for this since the dawn of time.
While we dance,  fear tends to fade away,
and we radiate the very antithesis of fear.

I have found color (as in lots of color) to be useful as well.
Trying to process more than six distinct bright colors at a time
often causes an overflow and shuts down the fear center
(or something like that).

I try to project a zone of anti-fear around myself all the time.

That strains credibility far beyond the breaking point.
What REAL drug dealer would get on TV and announce himself?
More likely an actor doing exactly what he was hired to do.

Hello everyone!!!

    This will be the last post from me about the three year 
anniversary, for I am going off into a distant land. (a land called 
stress!!!) Anyways, I just wanted to clear a few things up before the 
event...

    First, this event has taken almost a complete year to bring to 
life!! We started working on this project last year, right after the 2 
year ann. So there is nothing, absolutly nothing that would stop us 
from going through with it!! There have been a ton of recent problems 
thrown at the Harmony family, but we are not going to let them get in 
the way!! Most importantly, Omar. But on a lighter note there has been 
some specualtion that we were going to cancel the event because of rain 
this weekend... Well we don't care!! This event is going to happen rain 
or shine!!!! It doesn't matter if it snows!!! That's just one more 
attraction!!! Both of the rooms are indoors, with a outdoor field in 
between them. Plus, it doesn't look like it's going to rain anyways!! 

    The first bus will leave at around 1 or 2pm (depending on when it 
fills up). After the first bus takes off they will run continuously 
throughout the night. You can leave at anytime, but if you leave you 
can't get back on the bus to come back. The last bus will come back to 
the parking lot at noon on Sunday.

    We are so looking forward to this one!!! It's gonna be insane!!! 
Remember, feel free to bring your tents, toys, glow sticks, invisible 
friends (they get in for free), and any other crazy things. Please, if 
you plan on bringing water, it MUST be sealed!!!!! This is very 
important!!! If we find a bottle or container that is not sealed, it 
will not be permitted into the event. We will have plenty of water for 
sale at the event. (cheap too!) Also, please be extra, extra 
responcible for yourselves and your friends. Be aware of your 
surroundings, and always be safe!!! We want things to run as smooth as 
possible, but most of that is all up to you!!! We all love you, and 
can't wait til tomorrow!!! (408) 486-9591  (408) 450-3044

Peace,

Harmony

hello all-

for work related reasons (i have to sing on early sunday morning)  i will
not be able to physically join you all at harmony.  but, with a little
help, i can be there in spirit:

i need for someone to take my place in the chill room, wandering around
aimlessly with a water bottle, giving water to people who look like they
need it.  i've fallen into that function at raves for about the last year,
and i would love it if someone was able to do that for me.

i'm not worried about my hugging capacity being replaced, for there are
others who givve hugs like i do.

so, i hope ya'll have a great time, and send me some of your positive
vibes.  i'll be sending positive vibes from up here as i sit and practice
my music for sunday.


love to you all-

matt

If you have a real VRML 2.0 browser (eg. SGI's cosmoplayer for windows or
irix, Sony's cyberpassage (perhaps), or DimensionX's liquid reality
(perhaps)) you might want to check this out. I haven't tried it yet.

PS: anybody out there building collaborative multiuser VRML 2.0 worlds?
What are you using for your server-side database (holding the shared
world), how are you dealing w/ multiuser locking/access issues, and how are
you mapping the clients/users into multiple views of this database via
VRML?? HEEEEELP!

It's a fake. The first tip-off is that it is coming from "washington.com."
The second is the last line which reads ...or face persecution...

While the FBI may in fact persecute people, your forger probably wanted to
say prosecute....

Tell him to put his red box away, if he can't figure out a simple forgery.

Hey pup If you can't get away...(we know you have tried before)
you could help me with my new party!
It's called "Disillusioned Rave Industry Types, Has-Been DJ's 
and Social Climbing Rave Bitches".
And we can even have a television room!

Jeeeezuss.  I can't believe haw much cynicism and negativity Leslie has
had to deal with as a result of the Leeza show.  

What Leslie went through up on that stage, in the name of all that's good
and meaningful about raving, was extreemly difficult, both brave and
noble, and she did a fabulous job.  I was very proud of her, and I think
all of you cynics out there should be too.

. . . 'cause he's supposed to help set up, but doesn't know anyone to call,
and he's away from e-mail.

So, if any of you advance helpers know, e-mail me, and I'll tell you Eric's
phone # so you can tell him.

of course, in about 90 minutes or so the school buses are supposed to roll,
but maybe he can get there earlier.

I don't think it's real  ... if it WAS real, i think they'd have defined 
"fraudulent use of the public phone system" a little better.  what are 
you doing, pretending to be someone you aren't?  Or maybe you've tapped a 
wire into the phone lines and are stealing service?  :)  that's a vague 
accusation at best ..

Of course, i could be wrong.

I didn't catch the Leeza show sady, but from the posts i've read, it 
seems obvious that the media has their own views about how they are going 
to "promote" the rave scene to their viewing public.  Telling the masses 
that all this is nothing to worry about is just not good television, and 
so they make sure to skew their reports/interviews to suit the view they 
want to project.  I'm sure Leslie did an admirable job of speaking up for 
the "responsible" rave scene, but the viewers will remember the evil 
drugs and wild sex, because that's nicely sensationaist.

We have had our own share of difficulties here with raves in the news etc.
especially after Summer Love.  The Province newspaper made us all out to
be a bunch of subversive types who want to undermine "normal" society with
our drugs and sneaky way of life.  Although the "slang term dictionary" 
they provided was amusing (did you know that ambient is any soothing
electronic music regrdless of bpm?) i was offended by the rest of the
articles.  They haven't seen fit to print any of my replies, however ... 

Reasonable representation is gonna be an uphill battle whether we like it 
or not, IMHO.

Dear RaveFriends,

	It looks like our ride may have fallen through... if anyone is
going to Harmony at this late hour from S.F. with room for two, please
call.  We'll pitch in for gas.
	Or if you see a couple stray ravers with their thumbs out between
here and San Jose, pull over!  ;)

Much love & thanks,

No I havn't. But last summer when I was in Europe, MtV Europe had a daily
show (I think) called "Trance MTV".It was really cool.  Sounds like you
described the same thing.

dear sfravers:

i recently got back from vacation in NYC.  i promised a few people a trip
report when i got back so here it is...

i flew into JFK from washington national.  i had planned to rent a car for
the first week so that i could make it to some outside-of-nyc places
(new jersey and the hamptons) and to help out my friend jacob who
i was staying with in brooklyn.  the last time i saw my friend he had just
moved to nyc after going to school in SF for a year for photography.
now he is doing freelance photog in nyc and has turned into quite
the club kid.  in fact he had us on the guest list for the tunnel
that weekend.  the tunnel is this massive club in chelsea that
features junior vasquez as a resident doing these amazing 8 hour hard house
sets.  anyway, when we got to the tunnel, it had been shut down
by the city for 'creating a nuisance'.  the cops had bought drugs
there a number of times and they implicated the owner of the club in
the sales.  both the tunnel and the limelight are now shut down
indefinitely.  it sucked cause i had always wanted to check out
the limelight.  never fear in nyc though, something is happening.  it
just so happened that sasha and john digweed were playing at a club around
the corner called twilo.  what the heck.  we went to twilo and had a
swell time.  twilo is in the same location as the old sound factory NYC
and it has a main floor about as big as the one at 1015.  the music was
excellente and we ended up staying till 8 the next morning.  i went
to twilo a couple more times while i was in nyc, and i'd generally
rate it 'thumbs up'.  big sound, plenty of fresh air (needed in
muggy sweaty nyc), and people in the mood to get off their ass & jam.
it is mostly straight on friday and mostly gay on saturday.

during the week we went bar-hopping to some of the zillions of bars
they have there.  nyc is lounge city.  most of the nightlife is
dedicated to providing places for people to kick back, drink and
chat, preferrably in a super-tony atmosphere.  even the dance clubs have
lots and lots of chill type space.  another difference is that most dance clubs
are 18 and over, so the crowd and the vibe is different.  club kids are
everywhere, and ravers are few and far between.  the drugs of choice are
different from SF too.  in NYC the favorites are pizza (j/k), cocaine,
e and ketamine.  other things (eg. green bud) are very hard to come by,
even via club kids :).  prices at clubs were always inflated, with $5 for a
water and $7 for a drink pretty standard.  admission was usually $20/$25 for
dance clubs.  ins-and-outs were non-existent, though you could usually get a
good laugh out of the door staff by asking about it.

we did make it to new jersey, but not to the hamptons (or coney island).
in NJ obed fernandez (from the bpm list) has a web site called
internet dance radio where you can listen to dj sets.  i went with 
a friend who is a dj in nyc to record a set at obed's studio/web site.
while i was there i got to play with the new pioneer dj cd players and the
new pioneer mixer.  both the cd players and the mixer are the shit!
big improvement over the denon-style cd players.  i am saving to get one in 97.

the next weekend i went to robots, formerly home of save the robots,
in the east village.  when i first got there around 4am, there was a big
crowd trying to get in.  it was one of those roped-off-door, no real 'line',
kissy-kissy, beautiful people thing to get in so i went to twilo instead.
i did end up going back to robots at around 8am and there was no crowd outside.
it has a loungy upstairs part and a tiny, dark, loud basement
and they were playing hard house (what else).  by then the crowd
was small (though fierce) downstairs but eventually it petered out around 10am.
i would like to go to robots again when it is packed.  it shows promise.

the next day i returned my car and got a hotel room/shoebox in tribeca.
(btw - driving/parking in NYC is not as bad as people make it out
to be.  mainly because not very many people have cars.  SF is way
worse for parking and boston still takes the crown for chaos).
during the next week i did some sightseeing and the usual barhopping thing.
i got a chance to meet eve from vrave and we went to the metropolitan museum.
if you only visit one museum in nyc, visit this one.  be prepared to
spend a whole day.  other museums that i recommend are Musem of Modern
Art and the International Center for Photography.

if you are visiting NYC be sure to check out the invaluable weekly
magazine "Time Out" for things to do.  it covers everything from
art to clubs to theatre to films.  it's mindblowing how much
stuff is going on in the city every day.  be prepared to be bummed that there
is just not enough time in the day/week to do everything you want to.

my friends neil & jenny flew out from SF to join us for the weekend and we
went to the palladium which was hosting a wigstock benefit party.  wigstock
96 had been planned for that weekend but fell through due to typical
city hall bullshit.  the palladium is another huge club, this time in
the village.  it was converted out of an old theater.  there is
a main dance floor and one small one upstairs.  there's lots of bleacher
type seating in between for the lounging contingent.  going in they made us
empty our pockets before giving us a thorough pat-down.  pretty intense.
it turns out the palladium is owned by the same guy who owns the tunnel and
the limelight and they are now 'getting tough' on drugs coming into
the club.  another time we went they were actually making people
take off their shoes and feeling their socks.  whoa!  i didn't 
experience that kind of shit at any other clubs while i was there.
the others were no search, no carding, no nothing, just give us your $20.
anyway, the music and the energy level on the wigstock night was
incredible.  at 8am the dance floor was still packed.  it was wierd
because there was no sunlight coming into the club at all.  it was
that way at all the after hours places i went to.  really makes it
easy to just lose track of time. 

the next week i explored tribeca, soho and the village(s).  nyc is by far the
most fashion conscious place i've ever been.  everyone is dressed to
impress, even if they are just slacking.  brian d. would love it! :)
one day we went used clothes shopping (at domsey in brooklyn.
recommended).  i bought a couple outfits so i could do a reasonable nyc club
kid impersonation.  nothing better than funky polyester prints and gold pants!!
in soho there are tons of art galleries, boutiques, clothing stores
and models.  soho also has the cybercafe which is an internet-cafe
type place, probably the best one that i found in manhattan.  the
stations are $5/hour at most places and they have web, telnet, etc.
cybercafe had the fastest connection (T1) and the best setup by far.
i also went record shopping.  there are too too many dj stores
in NYC.  two that i would recommend are satellite in soho (nice staff, ravey
selection of music) and vinyl mania in the village.  you could spend
a week just record shopping in manhattan but i limited myself to 10 12"s
(including, ironically, the garth 12"). i didn't find any places
like amoeba where the prices are reasonable for used records.
at one point i stopped in liquid sky in soho, a 'rave culture' type store
(like ameba/housewares).  they have a small selection of 12"s.
the east village is the most like san francisco.  fairly laid back
and fairly young.. the scene kindof reminds me of the mission.
the west village is more sohoish, but a little bit more gay and a lot
more touristy.

the CMJ (a college radio conference) was in town that week
and there were lots of bands playing.  on one night there was an
orbital/goldie/+ show at the roxy and the cardigans (swedish fluffy pop band)
at the roseland.  my friend just happened to be a big cardigans
fan so we went there (free tickets helped convince me).  of course
now i have major regrets. :)

the last weekend we had our hopes up that the tunnel would reopen
but it didn't.  we also heard a rumor that all the names on the tunnel's
guest list are now in FBI files!!  damn!  my friend paul flew out from SF in
route to boston.  we hooked up with some club kids (free e's for everyone!)
and went to the roxy, a fairly large club in chelsea.  big hair was everywhere,
beefy boys cruising like flies and cheese pop house (complete with
live wailing diva) on the sound system.  we left to witness shoe removal
at the palladium ,'sorry, you're not on the list' at robots and finally 
vinyl, a cool club in tribeca where our club kids were on the guest list.
vinyl had one medium sized main dance floor and a muddy sound system, 
but it also had a very cool, urban mix of people boogieing away.
the music was house and it was funky and hard.
we wanted to stick around for the next morning's 'body and soul'
with francios k but we were too tired and had to drive to boston that
day so we left around 8am.

in summary i can't wait for next summer and another trip to nyc.  i feel
like i just scratched the surface.  i also gained a new appreciation for
san francisco.  SF is just so 'nice'.  NYC is really in your face.
on one hand it's an artist's paradise.  so much is centered on art
and it really effects the culture.  on the other hand there is
no equivalent to the endup! :) you know how the cliche goes:
it's a nice place to visit but i wouldn't want to live there - unless i
had a trust fund!!

 hey -

I'd have to say that Harmony last night was one of the coolest parties I've
ever been to.  Everything was done so wonderfully there.  I wish Harmony was
going to do some more parties.  
rad!

I have just returned  (actually just woken up from returning) from one of 
the all time raddest parties I have ever been to.  The best part for me 
was that I was sober (my definintion of sober ;) and that the positive 
energy there carried me until 5 am!!!!!!  (of course a little nap in my 
tent didn't hurt too much either.)  I met so many wonderful people- now I 
have faces to go with a lot of the names I know- Thank you everybody for 
making it such a beautiful pary.

-jess

P.S.  Okay- here's the bad part- I  lost the face plate to my moms car 
stereo- and she's not going to be all that happy with me unless I find 
it, sooooo if you found one please o please email me and I will come and 
get it from you!!!!  (I think I may have lost it somewhere around the 
outdoor stage...)

- if you return it you will get many many hugs and a whole lot of love!

I don't even know where to begin. Hands down the most positive party 
I've ever been to. Hilights:
-Terry Mullin: what can I say...infectious.
-Selling water outside and not being able to stop dancing almost the 
whole time:)
-People screaming together in the tent village. 
-heh plus the time one guy in front of us started screaming, got 
everyone else to start and Todd jumped up and yelled" Hey! You started 
that, Man!"
-Omar's shrine. nuff said...

peace out, and thanks,

Muchas gracias to the H crew for such a fun party!!. This was really the first 
party, other than Burn Man rave camp, that I've been to in a few years, and it 
was a perfect re-intro to the scene.Thanks to Charlotte, Jim, Andy, Chris, DD, 
and many others for making my experience special. Does anyone know Hans, from 
Placerville (he's not on SFraves list)? He solidified, in words (which is 
difficult), many of the feelings and emotions that have drawn me back into the 
empathic community that is called the "rave scene". Also, what was the name of 
the band that played in the chill place- 23 something? Intense stuff! 

Electronic bits-and-bytes data hugz to All!

I think that if you go back and re-read the messages, you will find that
most of the people are not criticizing Leslie personally. I am happy to
see that she is doing what she thinks is right. I do not however feel that
most mainstream media, and especially pulp media(Hard Copy, the 10
million+ sensationalistic daytime talk shows, et al.) are going give
anywhere neat a balanced or accurate representation of what "raving" is
all about. And given responses of people that attended, it would seem that
the "SLeeza"(thanks Wayne) show is no different than the rest. And
unfortunately, this was to be expected. To say that it wasn't flys in the
face of what the genre of daytime talk shows produce. 

How many people do you think have gone on those shows, thinking that they
were going to get a chance to share their views on a subject, only to be
used as a good, ol' fashion Roman spectacle?

P.S. The above is not a critisim of Leslie. ;-)

Blueberries and Chocolate (my love anecdote)

You know, Love came up to me one fine day and Love said, "Don't be afraid,
I'm only going to hurt you."  I giggled when Love said that to me because
it reminded me of a _Dragnet_ TV show when the pervert tried to lure a
little child into his car.  But after I giggled, Love got mad and yelled "I
mean it!  Come on over here so I can hurt you good and plenty!"  After
that, I didn't giggle anymore.  I wondered why on earth Love would go
around saying things like that.  I thought, "What a terrible way to attract
clients."  Why would anyone ever go an' say hello to Love if it was going
to say things like that?

So I hemmed and I hawwed and I steered right clear away from Love.

That was fine, for a time, until this morning.

There was a knock on my door and it woke me up.  I went to the door and who
should I find there but good ol' Love.  And Love looked so damn lonely when
it came up close like that.  I felt sorry for Love, and invited it in for
coffee with Blueberries and Chocolate, which I happen to know is one of
Love's very favorite breakfasts.  We sat and chatted cordially for a while.
Really, it was quite pleasant.  After a lull in the conversation, Love
said, "Please dearest, can I hurt you now?"  I had to laugh.  It somehow
seemed so sweet.  I said, "Yeah Love, you can hurt me now."

So Love hurt me and Love hurt me good and plenty.  And when Love was all
done hurting me, Love said, "See?  I told you not to be afraid."  Then Love
laughed, jumped up into the Blueberry dish and turned itself into a
Blueberry.

Ate all them blueberries, an' one of 'em was Love.

i'm still recovering from my trip to nyc, so i thought i'd post my report as 
well. We arrived at Lagardia on Wednesday, Sept 4 with my radio station picking
up the cost for airline tickets. being rather silly people, we took a but, not
the subway, to our hotel, the Radisson Empire, at lincoln center (also paid for
by the radio station). We dropped off our stuff and headed over to register
to the CMJ Music Marathon confrence (confrence fees also picked up by the 
radio station). The College Music Journal Music Marathon, for those who don't
know, is an annual confrence in NYC, all about "college music". In reality, 
this turns out to mostly a bunch of people from record labels schmoozing with
radio station music directors to try to get them to play their stuff. But its
a whole lot more than that...its also about 1000 bands and 3000 radio/college
kids converging in manhatten for a week-long megaBuzzparty.

After checking out a chineeze restaruant and some record labels, i called up
john speakman, a nyc-raver. he invited my over to his place for a party that
his housemate, Mattie White (mattie of vrave) from novamute records was 
throwing along with Want Ads. One of the girls from Nerdy Girl came and played
accoustic guitar. Plenty of vegan burgers, tofu dogs, beer, and soda and a 
stearo were all set up on mattie's and john's apartment's roof, with a great
view of the manhatten skyline and stuff. A bunch of cmj people were there, and
i met some jungle dj's and Tye Comer, the rpm guy of cmj. Also met Alice 
Chang of KALX. Anyway, most everyone left, and mattie, john, tye, some jungle
dj's and a few more people hung out at the apartment, and about midnight we
treked down to a party thrown by Astelwerks, React Records, and Deconstruction
at a place called the Den of Thevies. There was an open bar and everyone was
ordering fancy drinks, courtesy of the record labels. Ardo Bender and some
Astelwerks dj's were there, and since i was with tye, we schmoozed with some
label people. The bar sucked, but they had some nice projection panels. But
even that got old and we headed a couple blocks down to a party thrown by
Jungle Sky records and Koncrete Jungle called I love NY Jungle. DAMN, this
party was the BOMB! DJ Soul Slinger, MC TC Islam, and a bunch of great jungle
dj's ripped it up until about 4:30. There was a cool back room with live 
ambience and some chill dj's as well. Two floors, free water on both floors,
and no club/bar type people that were at the Astelwerks/React/Deconstruction 
party. Quite a few cmj people were there too. hollie from WMWM was there,
plus Kurt and Kiren, who I met at mattie's party (from KSCY maybe?), + Dara
(azzreal(sp?) of vrave). For being in a club, this was a sweet party, with
enough drum and bass to make anyone a convert. Even though i'm not much
of a jungle person, i couldn't help thinking i love ny jungle, i love ny 
jungle, I LOVE NEW YORK JUNGLE when it was over. Dara and I shared a cab 
back to the hotel. (oh yeah, i ment astrelwerks, not astelwerks up there,
and dara is from ohio. i have no backspace)

Thursday morning i headed back to lincoln center, and sat in on some panel
that sucked. hooked up with mike, one of the guys i came with, and lisa of
vision threat records and went off to buy records and eat. We went down to
the village and hit Subterranean records first, but i didn't buy anything.
Next stop was VinylMania, and i bought a rad acid jazz record. This place
had more house records than i ever ever wanted to see, so we headed to
Sonic Groove, and I went insane. Bought lots of detroit stuff and a little
trance. Frankie Bones was working behing the counter and checked me out.
We went to bleaker bob's and some other places, all of which i forget the
names of. we grabbed some food and headed back to lincoln center, where
I hooked up with mattie and kurt and we rounded up a lot of people
(Hollie, Melanie, Jeff, Kiren) and went to Kurt's room at the Paramount
for a little fun. The Paramount was totally totally rad, with wierd mirrors
and lighting everywhere. Mattie put dinner on his expence account, and then
we headed down to the Roxy for the most incredible show...:

We got to the roxy and got in free (everything was free for cmj people).
Alothough this was a club, it was HUGE and had cool intelligent lighting
and free water. Dj Shadow was on for a while, and then Money Mark came on
for a live performance. OHMYGOD!! he started out his first song by holding
a little amp to a microphone and moving it around to cause funky feedback.
Then he had a second mike in his hand and was moving it around to trigger
a moog MG-1!!!! it was pretty strange :). He started playing another song
by holding a little casio keyboard to the mike, but it didn't work out so 
he trashed the keyboard rocknroll-style. Next, he played "Insects are
all around us" (my favorite money mark song) and i melted. After Money Mark,
Goldie came on, and dropped some nice drum and bass. this was more jungle 
than i'd taken in a while. Someone told me that Bjork was there (because
she's maried to Goldie?!?) and that tricky was there but tricky and goldie
got in a fight and tricky left. Anyway, a little bit later Rabbit in the 
Moon came on and did some live stuff that wasn't too impressive, butthen 
again, i had my heart set on...ORBITAL!!! Orbital's set was a little 
similar to the show at the Filmore, and they stopped between songs. There
were a ton of clueless people and orbital did a bunch of remixes of club
songs and rave anthems that drove em all wild. and they did an encore
and the played the satan remix. and the kicked ass again. couldn't believe
this was all free.

After orbital, another jungle dj came on and dara and i went to the empire
diner for some food (free by scam). Friday, i went to some panels with hollie.
First was the jazz panel. and it sucked, a bunch of commerical jazz people.
we went to an "artists and their addictions" panel and it sucked hard core.
Gave up and went to another panel, which quickley ended an DJ Spooky came on!
Spooky did a 30 min set, cuttin and scratchin like only spooky can :) after
his set, was the artists panel with DJ Spooky, Money Mark, Goldie, Mike Watt
and some others. it rocked. Money Mark is cool. :) 
After that we went to the RPM panel, which also sucked. but paul? of orbital
and goldie were there. goldie's cool too :)

After spooky's set, we had talked to him, and he had invited us to a 
small party that night. we (dara and i) went, but it was packed with record
label schmuks so we left and went record shopping. We hit Sattelite, 
Eight Ball records, and Strange?.. then went to a party thrown by Quango
and Axiom. Being cmj goons, we were let in free again, and the party was RAD!
Rob swift of xmen and DXT were there, battling each other and stuff. Then
Razell, The Grandmaster of Noize, of the roots, battled rob swift, except
Razell DIDN'T USE TURNTABLES!! it was incredible, he was doin all these
hiphop tricks and stuff by just his voice!! after beatboxin' a while, they
turned some wack jungle dj loose, who soon got relieved. dara and i left
when the house dj's came on. it was strange to see drunk club people trying
to dance to jungle. actually they were just bouncing around. there was some
guy speakerboxing as well. 

saturday, dara and i saw the new quinten tarrintino film called curdled. it
sucked. i went to buy ore records, and this time went to liquid sky/temple
and got annoyed (but they had lots of drum & bass). I went to the DMC store
but it was closed.I went back to sonic groove and got a rad record bag and
stuff. got a falefel and went back. Later, Dara and I went to a silly party
at wetlands, with call of da' wild and chino xl. wetlands was cool, but the
dj's were crappy. but it was free :) We went to a party that DJ Spooky
invited us to at the NY Film Academy. but unlike everything else, it wasn't
a free cmj event, we had to pay ten bucks. for some reason, we were both
a little tired after too many shows and too many record stores and too many
parties and too many panels and didn't want to pay ten buxks, so we found a
rad diner and had breakfast went went back to the hotels

i left dara at times square and hung out with the guys i came down with for a 
while, then it was time to go home. The coolness didn't stop there, though.
At the airport, they served Peets Coffee!!!!!!!! It had been almost a month
since i left berkeley and hadn't had Peets in a while.. Peets in NY was great!

Anyway, i met lots of cool people (dara, hollie, jeff, john, kiren, kurt, 
tye..). Thanks for hanging out with me guys :) also thanks to my radio station,
kmnr, for sending me. between the station and the records labels, almost all
my expenses were covered and i only had to spend 23 bucks! 

i'm leaving out a lot, but oh well, this is long enough and i have a test
tomorrow and if you've made it this far, you can tell i don't feel like 
writing today.. but

	i miss berkeley
	i miss bay area
	i miss sf raves
	I LOVE NEW YORK JUNGLE

but i don't think i'll be going back to ny for a while.. the west coast
is a little more my speed. but it was fun. thanks to all the ny ravers i met
thanks to cmj for the parties. thanks to the record labels. if you ever want
to hear jungle for a week solid, you know where to go. kids in nyc play
breakbeat in their cars. you meet people wearing jungle sky tshirts on the
subway. oh yeah, the subway is only $1.50 anywhere. its hot, its skanky, but
its cheap and i can actually afford it. wish bart was $1.50 and ran all night.

anyway, missouri is hot if anyone wonders. it rained today. i'll see you
all soon...-raj

hello all-

i've been, against my will, forced into veganism.  it that sound's odd,
here's how:

last week, i went vegetarian, for health reasons.  i was really getting
into that, and was enjoying getting to know more vegetables and stuff.

this morning, i found out (under suspician from my doctor) that i have a
dairy alergy, so if i eat any dairy products, my thouat will get
continually get more and more fucked up (which is bad for a singer).

so, at that point, i could eat vegetables, fruits, grains, and eggs, and i
said, i'm so close, i might as well do it, so i'm now a vegan!

so, wish me luck on my new culinary quest!

love to you all-

matt

In fact I DID!!!  What a blast!  My bro and I met up with some great 
people in tent city, then spent much of the night in the ambient room 
(which boomed quite nicely at one point), and left around 7am.

Like I said, we met lots of cool people, but I am terrible with names, 
and in my "trance-like" state, I probably won't remember too many faces 
either.  I hope I can meet up with more SFRaves list members at my next 
rave.  Does anyone have personal websites I can visit?  Anyone interested 
in visiting my fledgling digital gallery?

Also, I found a beautiful glass "object" in my backpack at nights-end.  
If anyone lost a beautiful glass "object", describe it and it's yours! :-)

One last thing... next time, I'll bring my bongos!

love and peace...

deeje

P.S. One gathering that people constantly mentioned is Sunset.  Any word 
on the next Sunset?  Thanks!

So,  whats the URL....    By the way,  if you ever want to give directions
to some place,  but don't want to deal with the geography of the situation,
check out:  http://www.mapblast.com/mapblast/locator.html
or also:  http://www.proximus.com/yahoo/

These sites take an address,  and draws a map,  with an X marking the
address.    GREAT for passing out rave directions info,   or telling
someone where their place is located.    I'm finding it invaluable
to me,  because I know little about the geography around the San Diego
area.   You just type in the address,  and it displays a map.   Then, you
can copy the URL and paste it into the web browser.   For instance,
my location is:

http://www.proximus.com/cgi-bin/webmap?Template=yahoo&File=world&Style=Plain
&Alias=1&Height=250&Width=400&Icon=Smallcross%2C%2C0%2C0&Context=%2d117%2e15
8133%2c32%2e715614%2c20000%2c0%2c0&UA=624%20Broadway%20%2f%20San%20Diego%2c%
20CA%2092101

Just copy and paste it into your web browser and it draws a map and CX marks
the spot....    An excellent topol for those geographic brain dead folks
who are lousy with directions.

hi,
I've been told that all forms of dance music are considered forms of techno, 
e.g. that techno came first and house, acid, etc all evolved from techno and
fall under that classification.  What I'd like to see is a sort of family 
tree of all these forms of music.

Anyone who hasn't seen The Roots live should go, at least once, just for
the experience of hearing Razell.  I don't really thrill to their
performances, but the Grandmaster is just that.  Awesome.

If that wasn't the last Harmony party I would have said, "It will be hard
to beat that one" but it was the last and what a party it was. It was this
years best.

Thanks to everyone that helped out and made it so great. I had an
incredible time. Thumbs up to Greg and the rest of the Harmony crew.

If I tried to explain how great it was I would do it justice so I'll leave
it by saying, "This was one of this years best".

An End To Burning Man ( at least at Black Rock )

 There is a story on page D1 of today's San Francisco Chronicle 
( Sep. 16th ), titled "Desert May Not Host 'Burning Man' Party".

 Some selected quotes from the article:
 --------------------------------------------------------------

 Citing financial concerns and incompatible values, Pershing County
commissioners have voted to seek an end to the annual Burning Man
celebration in Nevada's Black Rock Desert.

 At the urging of Sheriff Ron Skinner, commissioners agreed to write 
a letter to the Bureau of Land Management asking it not to reissue a
permit to event organizers next year. The event is sponsered by a San 
Francisco-based group.

...

 This year there where at least five arrests ... the most serious involved 
a man who was booked for felony drunken driving after slamming into 
occupied tents on the desert. Another man was killed when his motorcycle 
ran head-on into a van.

 Event organizers could not be reached for comment. A recorded message 
at their San Francosco headquarters said, "The Burning Man Project is 
shut down for cleanup and reprogramming."

what an incredible location. the tents gave me a pleasant reminder of 
burningman, teh surrounding redwood trees and green vegetation brought a 
peaceful aura and the two rooms were decorated with care and warmth. this 
was more than a typical good party. a lot of drums and the various people 
contributed to a tribal energy outside and in the 'chill' room while the 
main room pounded with the energy of a full on rave, where mike clay 
provided some mind melting visuals. 
i got there around six, with a small soundsystem outside and tim's BBQ 
going it felt like BBQ and beats all over again:). as teh busses brought 
more people in, the place filled up nicely, and was so spacious there that 
it never got overcrowded. this was very well organized so props to greg 
and harmony crew and most people that went that made it so. 
the live act, stella lunar, was great - pounding acoustic rhythm and some 
acoustic and electronic overlays the finished product came out very groovy 
and psychedelic.

little tidbits:

wayne and marcy it was great to hang out with you two. 

claire and rob's little puppy was just too adorable:) 

the pancakes provided by jason out of teh back of tim's truck made the 
morning complete.

we were just missing amy and melanie, i got used to running into those 
two at these great events...


    happy monday everyone:)

     There's a very good book with some excellent vegetarian recipes 
     available by John Robbins called "Diet for a New World".  Try the 
     Potato Corn Chowder and the Curry Collieflower, Potato.  Mmm-mmm-good. 
      Of course, you'll be wanting to find a farmer's market in town so you 
     can get vegetables and fruits that have not been mangeled with 
     pesticides and carnuba wax for decorative purposes.

hello all-
     
i've been, against my will, forced into veganism.  it that sound's odd, 
here's how:
     
last week, i went vegetarian, for health reasons.  i was really getting 
into that, and was enjoying getting to know more vegetables and stuff.
     
this morning, i found out (under suspician from my doctor) that i have a 
dairy alergy, so if i eat any dairy products, my thouat will get 
continually get more and more fucked up (which is bad for a singer).
     
so, at that point, i could eat vegetables, fruits, grains, and eggs, and i 
said, i'm so close, i might as well do it, so i'm now a vegan!
     
so, wish me luck on my new culinary quest!
     
love to you all-
     
matt

Had a great time at the Harmony party even though I was a little lost for a

to the 37 people, so far, who have harassed me about not going to harmony-

i love you all!  thanks for your thought, and i wish i could have been
there, but my occupation/love of my life (singing) prevented me from going!

i, and 4 other friends who would have gone, were there in spirit, and were
having our own little mini rave at "tart-a-tart cafe" on ivring and 8'th
avenue.

so, i know i will see ya'll soon, and have yourself a great monday (is that
what day it is? i lose track.  oh well, have a great day!!!!!)

love-

great tree! :)
But now, can you tell me anything about "ambient jungle"? ;^)  My friend who
just came from NYC swears that there is such a thing, and wants to know if
there's any place to hear ambient jungle out here.  Is that the same thing
as "pop jungle"?

Wow.

To start off, I have to say that this was THE BEST rave/party/whatever you
call it that I have ever attended (narrowly defeating the Beautiful People
on Mission, a couple of months back).  I have to say this now, because I'm
actually going to try to describe the experience, and I know that I can't
come close, at least in language, to describing it adequately.

For me, the party started at about 7:30pm on Friday, when Steve Simitzis,
Blossom and I drove down to the site (we had mistakenly thought that
people were staying on-site overnight to help set up :)  In the end, it
became a lovely, laid back evening of little sleep and much cuddling &
small talk with some of the most amazingly wonderful people around,
while helping to make laminates & number tickets, etc.  I was bouncy from
the instant Steve put on a tape in the car (yay for Steve's jungle tape!
wooooo!), and for me, that was the beginning of the experience.

While I'm at this stage: thanks very much for the ride to & from, Steve!
You're the best!

I had gotten my money's worth out of the experience before we even went
out to the site Saturday morning, just from being near all the wonderful
people who were helping out.  Everything that happened after noon was a
bonus :)... the site was gorgeous - clearly the perfect location for this
event.  I spent the first few hours helping out as much as I could,
primarily in the main room, and greeting people with big hugs, eating
veggie dogs, and being excessively bouncy.  I even made a half-hearted
attempt at taking a nap around 3:30, but it failed; I was just too
excited!  At around 5, Tom started spinning on the little outdoor sound
system, and I finally unleashed a bit of my bounciness.  Woo!

For fear of burning myself out before the real sound systems even turned
on, I went up to the main room & helped a bit more, and then just sat on
one of the picnic tables outside that room, watching the beautiful people
stream into the site (hugging as necessary :)  From time to time, I would
lose my self-control and bounce down to dance for a few minutes, but
mostly I was able to restrain myself & save up some energy for the main
event.

Which leads me into saying: WOW, what a setup.  The harmony decorations
are so wonderfully warm, and happy... even though I've seen them at 4
different events now, they always manage to be fresh and incredible and
unique.  The lighting in the main room was spectacular - just the right
mix of glow-stuff and flashing-stuff for my tastes.  I have no idea what
DJs were spinning when, but it matters very little, because *all* the
music was simply extraordinary.  Woooooo!  I actually totally burned out
for a few minutes right after the sound came on, and went up and listened
to the first half of Stella Luna's (amazingly wonderful) set - definitely
one of the highlights of the night.  And even though by this point I was
totally burned out (give me a break, I barely slept the night before :) I
didn't get any sleep - just laid back on the floor and felt the music and
the people around me... wonderful.  I was energized enough at that point
to head back down to the main space for quite some time & dance some more!

At some point, I wound up totally spaced out and ready for sleep, sitting
on a couch in the ambient room, listening to some really really beautiful
breakbeat/trip-hop and about to sleep.  This was when a very beautiful
experience ocurred - one which can't really be described but which
energized me for the rest of the night.

The rest of the night passed in somewhat of a blur of happiness, dancing
my ass off, lying on the side of the path staring at the stars, hugging
people, hearing incredible music, and just generally being exceedingly
happy.  There were highlights of this blurry time though - someone,
noticing that my DISCO sticker (thanks Brendan (sp?)!) had been sweated
off, and took theirs off and gave it to me; Karen infusing me with energy
via a hug and a wave of her hand; the girl who asked if she could e-hug me
- - i had no idea what that meant, so to be safe I said no, but here's a
regular hug... and 5 minutes later, after the hug was over, she said
"that wasn't a regular hug!" (but it WAS, it's just that Mattloaf taught
me how to hug :); meeting incredible people & smiling & hugging with
them... whoa.  The list goes on.

Speaking of meeting people, I don't remember very many names.  But I added
about 25 people to my hug-on-sight list, so watch out :)

There were a couple of seriously lacking people for me - Matt Lanier and
Shamini Jain.  Matt, I saw your post when I got back, I'm *so* bummed you
weren't there!  I was looking forward to mega-hugs and some kick-back
time.  Next time, eh?  And Shamini... where were you?  I looked and
looked.  I hope you were able to make it out, and that I just missed you.
But if you didn't make it, we're even for me missing Burning Man :)

I have to send out super-special thanks and love to the Harmony crew and
to everyone who was there for the set-up and tear-down.  It was a lot of
fun, and seeing the site beforehand, and seeing the finished product and
how happy it made people, and knowing that I was a small part of that, was
an indescribably good feeling and added another level of pleasure to this
already perfect weekend.

I also have to say how amazingly grateful I am to those of you who
explicitly thanked me for the little gifts I've been bringing to the last
few events and for being so energetic.  I couldn't be energetic without
you!  I don't think anyone has that much energy within themselves - the
energy comes from that indescribably thing we all talk about and love
desperately, the VIBE.  And as we all know, Harmony are the masters of
vibe :)

I love you all so much!  Thanks everyone for making my weekend perfect.
I'll be sore until the next millenium, I'm sure, but it was *so* worth it!
See you at the next one... and gobs of hugs and love 'till then!

still in a daze after that wonderful event - about all i can muster is a
few random comments - luckily i remembered a few names this time!
p.s. my face still aches from smiling so much.

hello's, hugs, and thank-you's to:

the harmony crew and the people who own/run that retreat - you saw the
possible and made it actual and our mouths are still agape

ran and stella luna - yow!  tugged me loose from reality in the most
pleasant-est way.

leslie - the first <brilliant!> smile i received that night - thank you!

the BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE  who were breaking down the the main floor with me
around 1am - i know you felt that vibe too, it was REAL.

especially matthew with your super-textured bald head and jess (tear it
DOWN!)

moonpup - pleasantly twisted with a trippy aftertaste!  and a good arm for
the thing that goes WHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE-EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!

lorin and jason, you fed us uncut NRG right off the drum head - 
GOOD GOD how can you NOT dance to that?

adam <r.lunatic> - a glowing moment of perfect frenzy as the fog rolls in

mattloaf of the inexhausible hugz - now THAT is an addictive substance!

john k., who received the most passionate description EVER on the
subjective WUMPH that starts a choice acid lick.  hey john, the nut was
freely given ...

steve - we passed mostly like two ships in the night - boo.  i missed you.

eric, ben, and all the troubled boys of the frequent frier's club - they
held the sky up when gravity started looking iffy that morning.  1st
person perspective IS a lot harder than 3rd person, ya know

quote of the morning:
  - HOW can it get any better than this?
  - just wait, man, it WILL!

see you all soon ...
matthew.

BUT WAIT:

last but definitely not least:

david and blossom - david, who found his keys and never lost his smile!
and blossom, who might have been spotted whirling to funky breaks in the
chill room but was never seen again =(

brian and jon (BK) and john and two more wonderful smiling people (dammit
i lost your names but not your faces) - my first hand orgy.  aaaaah ...

  Lay your hands on the album "subtropic" by homebrew (which came out on
Reflective Records from SF) and you will not regret it!  I don't know if
it exactly fits the term ambient jungle, but it's very beautiful and
mellow drum & bass.
  Love that stuff :)
  Take care!

Yay David!!!  I knew you would have a fabulous time :o)  As I'm sure
everyone who went to  Harmony did :) :) :)
Setting up is 1/2 the fun, eh?

Ah...but we are not even!  I did make the be-eeautiful luv fest!!!  Though
not for long :^(  (meaning only 4 hours or so) ...which brings me to yet
another tangent...probably discussed before?...
what to do when SO's aren't tuned in to raving...<sigh>...anyone 
care to comment on or give advice on this?  I love Chris, but he 
*doesn't* dance, and isn't all into the music...so by 4 or so,
when the music is getting ReAlLY GOOD!, he is falling asleep and just looks
miserable.  It breaks my heart!!  And I love, LOVE to dance.  It's the only
drug I need :)  We are trying to compromise on it, but it still makes it
hard when I want to stay and dance with my friends till at least dawn 
and he is sitting all alone (too shy to talk to others) and nodding off.

I looked for you too!  couldn't find you :^(  If you saw a short indian
girl in a purple velvet cape and princess leia braids (that came out 
in 2 seconds once I got to the main room ;o)) with bubbles, that was me!
Where were you?  EvErYwHerE, I'm sure!!
The only person from SFraves I recognized...Brian Darkness!  
You were on my bus!  I saw you Brian!  I know who you are!  Of course
because of your silver reflective jacket.  It was nice to place the face
with the name ;)  Anyway, you're probably not reading this as I'm on your
trash list :-)  I actually wanted to say hi, but figured you probably
weren't eager to talk to me after I hissed at you on-line!

To the rest of you, I hope to meet you soon!  And David?  We Will meet soon!

peas,
shamini

ps...funniest moment...being asked straight out if I was a witch.  Ever
happen to you before?

I will keep this as short as I know how..... 
 
I don't know about the rest of you, but I have a lot of trouble reading a
post that is very long and is written in ONE paragragh........ 
 
I find that when there is a break every 10 or so lines, it is easier on the
eyes and brain. 
 
Now I don't claim to be an English expert (as seen from many of my own
posts), so I'm not sure of the exact time to end one, and begin another
paragraph, but I think it has to do with subject matter per
paragraph........... I think sort of maybe kinda 
 
Anyway, a lot of times I will just delete a post if it is long and one
paragraph, as I don't like hurting my brain.........well at least not
unless I mean to !!!! 
 
this was just another friendly ramble from ............... dot man

Hey: 

The following paragraphs are excerpts taken from my memory, from various
conversations I havve had with other musicians and DJ's:

Nobody really knows what genre of electronic dance music came 1st.
Basically, the areas that people tend to narrow it down to is Chicago and
Detroit.  Detroit "invented" techno, but in Chicago, disco never died, and
became house. You can still hear elements of disco in a lot of music that
comes out of Chicago ("garage house" is a form of music that was basically
disco but was written by people with small electronic setups at home back in
the late 70's/early 80's and couldn't afford the big-budget disco
productions of the time).  However, in Detroit the nu-beat sound (dance
music that spawned from industrial) was rapidly evelving, and at some
threshold became techno.  Therefore it's hard to tell where it originated.
Germany and Belgium played a huge part in it's development as well, with
record labels such as Tekno Drome International and ZYX, as well as
Kraftwerk and Front 242. 
Now, basically, I hate classifications.  Its nearly impossible to really
know who invented what, and what evolved where, unless you had a collection
of about 10,000 records that you could sort by date. For example, take Acid
house, or house in general.  As a musician myself, most of my best sounds
are caused by mistake.  I might have the wrong sequence playing the wrong
synthesizer and it sounds awesome. 
         Then, take into effect the musicians who could only afford "cheap"
equipment.  When hip-hop originated, it was created by musicians of the
street, who couldn't afford ultra- expensive fairlight samplers and
synthesizers that at the time averaged about $5,000 each or more.  So they
had to deal with what was affordable: piece-of-shit TR-808's and Technics
1200 turntables.  Later, the big hot-shot producers ended up eating their
fairlights and $5000 synths when the street musicians were making millions
with their "shitty" TR 808 
        Same goes for house. At one point, a broke musician could only
afford the plethora of TR909 drum machines and TB303 synthesizers, which,
ended up making some smokin acid house. And thus, a new movement was born.

But to me, what it boils down to is what you love, and it doesn't really
matter what came 1st, for it gets really confusing :)

They (we? =) are!!! That was just the last "harmony," but the crew isn't
going to drop outta the party bi'ness or anything... a good thing too
because

HARMONY THREE FUCKING TORE MY HEAD OFF!!!!

this was the most unbelievably beautiful party I've ever experienced!!!

It felt so good to be part of the crew and know that I'm playing a small
part in bringing this event to life. I loved putting all that work into
helping out with setup, cleanup and karma patrol. I put so much energy into
this party that I think I need to take a (short =) break from raving just
to RECOVER. =)

anyway, a quickie review:

space: YOWZA! Chill room was the chillinest chill room I've ever seen.
lighting and setup was beautiful. Nice touch putting the DJ/musician right
in the middle, and that stage that opened up when live bands played was so
nicely decorated. The shrine to Omar was really special, and even though I
didn't know him personally, I really felt a connection just because so many
people were there thinking about him. The main room was the bomb too (it's
dusty up there in those rafters... I pity the kid who had to drag down all
the extension cords I put up there =). There were so many blacklights that
perfectly accompanied the day-glo disco and happy-face-speaker stickers
that brendan and I were tossing around. Oh yeah.. the campground. A nice
place to hang out where you could talk to people and occasionally SCREAM
LIKE A MANIAC with hundreds of others joining you...  fun!

music: didn't even keep track of the DJs but I gotta say that SOMEONE blew
me away with a MONSTER buildup at about 4 or 5am... never screamed so loud
in my life! =) The chill room music was very... chill! =) Allegra's (sp?)
voice is so beautiful (the girl who sang moonshadow at about 430am) we're
all going to miss her!

cool moments:

meeting so many smiling people while running around the main room. Made so
many new friends!!! hi kc, david, and all the other sfravers whose names
have completely slipped my mind right now (D'OH!! i'll remember you guys as
soon as I see you next! =)

checking out that little redwood grove with the christmas lights.

the smiles on the faces of my SJ friends who've never been to a rave before
(starting off on the right foot? =)

every time the bus arrived the passengers would scream and the camp would
scream back! well, pretty much every time the camp screamed in general;
there's something beautiful about a huge clan of happy people raising
they're voices like that in unison.

brendan, I finally figured out how to spin those glo-sticks on strings
without hitting myself (too much). thanks!

wierd moment: while on karma patrol, we ran into a couple that wasn't doing
too good. The guy was freaking out a little, but he *seemed* happy. The
girl was miserable though, mainly because she was worried abouther friend
"making a scene." I don't want to go into too much detail, but taking care
of these two (with caryn --thanks) really disturbed me. I really got the
feeling that they were two incredibly depressed, emotionally unstable kids
who SHOULD NOT have taken the substances they did, at least not as much as
they did. I think e (or any other mind-altering chemical) isn't a "cure-all
hapy disco biscuit" and that if you take it you should either a) have your
shit together or b) be with someone who knows what they're doing and can
help you take advantage of the e to improve your self-esteem. These two
were NOT helping each other, and I felt so helpless because I'm not at all
experienced with dealing with these kinds of situations. =(

well, that bummed me out for awhile, but I soon I was back on my super
happy trip (I was sober too! =) trying to make everyone's party experience
just a little bit nicer.

morning came, the music was turned off and people started packing up,
hugging good-bye and leaving. Cleanup, though tiring, was fun and we were
outta there by early afternoon.

in short, this was one of the best fuckin' parties I've ever attended.
THANKS FOR EVERYTHING GREG AND HARMONY!!!

smiles,
-m.

Thought I'd take a minute and share my Harmony experience with y'all
[would you expect anything else from me? :)]... The music was
terrific, of course, although I didn't spend much time in the ambient
room. Sadly, I heard not a trace of jungle all night, but oh well :(

Harmony 3 was a bit like "Burning Man Lite"; there was a campground,
some rave stuff, some people cooking food, a fun vibe, porto-johns,
drum circles, techno-hippies, computer geeks, and so on.

The main area was incredible; the sound system and lighting(?) were
from Gateway and provided a nice sensory overload. I don't think I've
tranced out that deeply in years; the lighting at times was simply so
blinding, that there was nothing else that one could be aware of other
than the rapid change of colors, strobing, and smoke. At times, vision
of objects would be impossible. One could only see in terms of colors
and rough shapes.

Between the visuals and the powerful sounds coming out of the sound
system, I was transported to another plane. While I was dancing, I was
unaware of myself or of the world around me. Sound became
movements. Closing my eyes only left me with a slightly darker version
of what I saw with my eyes open. Quickly, everything disappeared, even
myself. It was no longer was important to connect with people around
me, because they were no longer there as people. Everything to me felt
as a continuous stream of light, sound, and energy. Nothing physical
was left. incredible :)

At some point, my physical body starting knocking at the door; my
trance had been interrupted by my physical needs. But just as well; so
I sat down with some friends, had some water, and enjoyed watching
everyone else have the time of their lives. :) And I was able take
some some time to mentally record my experience on the dance
floor. I'm a non-drug person, and I wondered if what had happened to
my state of mind was in any way similar to other people's drug
experiences...

I spent much of my time connecting with people that I don't normally
see in non-rave social settings, which was nice. I was also feeling a
bit anti-social, which is rather unusual for me. A lot of it had to do
with the fact that I was really tired due to setting up and staying
awake all weekend; maybe I was just feeling moody. Nonetheless, I
missed spending time with many of my friends that were there.

I really have to hand to the Harmony people; that was my first time
contributing to a party, and it's really hard work. There is so much
sweat and stress that goes into throwing events like that, and this
past weekend made me appreciate it.

David and I went together, so much of my experience overlapped with
his. Though, I'd like to add a footnote to his post: Friday night, we
stayed at Greg's house and watched Dead Alive. This was the scariest,
goriest, most vile movie that I've ever seen. I was so disturbed after
seeing this! Fortunately, Ren & Stimpy made it into the VCR to clear
my head of all of the gore. But I surprised; the last thing you'd
expect to see in the Harmony house would be a horror movie :)

cool stuff from this weekend:

being saved by technology and Brendan at Camp Swig on friday
the scary road
Mike going off with the laminator
"I kick ass for the *Lord*!"
selling water to thirsty ravers
sleep deprivation
DJ Tom's set
wrestling with the sketchy ladder
glowsticks from Shawna
meeting new SFRavers
phat hugz from Mattloaf
Chai tea from City-E

Anyway, I've said all I can about this, and it was definitely a
weekend to remember. But I'm not worn out yet! mad's tonight, and I
will be there :) [that is, after I get some packing done].

Steve

Hi all!

 Wow!!! What a party!  =) I've never had so much fun being stressed out! ;)
I visited the site on Wed. and Fri. with Greg and crew and immediately 
became way more eXcitEd than I already was. The ambient room was SOOOO 
nice and perfect for the live acts. Some folks mentioned that they felt 
the main room and the ambient room should have been switched, but for the 
live acts the temple room was perfect.

 Got to the site at 1:30 (only an hour and a half late :) and started to 
unload. Once again big thanks to the ever wonderful Jess for helping me 
get there and tolerating my storage locker ;).

 At one point Greg says to me "You're in charge of the ambient room." 
YIKES!! I should have expected that, but didn't (although that has been a 
dream of mine for five years now) and the onslaught of questions from 
eager, smiling ravers on what goes where, do you think that looks good, 
etc., was somewhat overwhelming. Now I have a taste of what Greg goes 
through on a regular basis ;).

 At this point I would like to apoligise to everyone who had to deal with me 
those two days; I was very sick and losing my voice and my shoulder still 
hurts every day, so I was a little cranky =(. And then when JK Sound set 
me back two hours in set up time by; 1) bringing the wrong mixer and 2) 
having that mixer die, that really put me in a foul mood as I couldn't 
sound check the two live acts (Stella Luna and 23 Degrees).

 Big thanks to the Harmony crew who kept coming by and asking if I needed 
help!!!!! I did but none of you folks are licensed. ;) Also big thanks to 
everyone who worked in the chill room with decorations and such!! And the 
biggest thanks to those who stayed and helped to clean and pack at the 
end (hi John!!). It is people like you folks that make this world worth 
living in!!!!!!!! Dagny, you are the sweetest!

 Other folks that helped me; Martin and Jennifer, thanks!

 And oh my God the rib that I recieved from Tim (with his award winning 
sauce) saved my ass! It was SOOOO good!!! Thanks Tim!!!!! =)

 Well, despite the problems that I had from the power genny and JK (I had 
to repatch my audio hookup, lucky I brought both of my sub-mixers) we 
started on time. Big thanks again to Stella Luna and 23 Degrees for their 
patience and understanding. :) Also big thanks to Madeline for her slide 
show. Very beautiful!

 Stella Luna was over the top!! they were SOOOOO good it hurt! ;) What an 
ensemble of of complete lunatics! Their performance was a mixture of 
music, performance art/parade and pure  celebration of life! I loved them 
and highly recommend them! 23 Degrees had a very solid set with very 
beautiful sounding vocalists and incredible percussion.

 My highlight was having Allegra sing. She sang two songs acalpella (sp?) 
the first being Cat Steven's "Moon Shadow" and the second being a song 
whose title I don't remember. Her voice was very soothing and beautiful. 
Also my hugs from Greg were very soothing (as well as his coment; "I just 
loved watching you stress so beautifully. ;) And looking back and seeing 
Moonpup (whom I haven't yet met formally) sitting on my couch and nodding 
with a smile as I played an ol' gospel church tune.

 Because of my exhaution, sickness, etc. I felt that my set really 
suffered and as such I would like to apoligise to all those who wanted 
to hear me really go off.

 Big thanks to Andrew K. for letting me crash and recuperate at his 
flat!!! =)

 A huge hug to all those who came! You folks are why we do what we do!!!  =)


Peace all,


Ran

Was Sept 8 the last Sunset? I was tempted to haul my sleep deprived body
to the East Bay for some afternoon techno yesterday. But, alas, the
Pacific voicemail returned no Sunset information.

as i understand it, the history of modern music shows,
that house was before techno, and so all techno
could be called house-offsprings - but techno became
a way of making music in generel - the method is 
the techno-algorithm!

and that means, even jungle is techno - 
and breakbeat is there it all comes together again -
the house, the techno, the jungle and the acidsounds
(acid actually is not techno, but can be!)

Rob spun some ambient drum&bass in his first of two sets, say around 1am.
It was funny too, becuase he wasn't quite sure what to drop and it turned
out to be perfect...

Hmmm...that's a far, far stretch...Burning Man is more about survival and
building a virtual community, Harmony was at a camp ground with a convient
store no more than ten minutes away.  I understand your point, though.  I'd
say it was more like "Light Lite", that is, a more convenient, and shorter
version of Gateway's Light campout over July 4th weekend.

They were from JK, not Gateway.  Definitely intense and interesting.  Truth
be told, I had a problem with the Golden Scans being on the floor like they
were.  We kept getting blinded by these high-powered lights.  No so bad
when you get hit straight on, but when it hit your peripheral, damn!  Ouch!

It was a rockin' night!  =)

	I wonder if they have a needle exchange program for vinyl users?
My old needle is dirty and I think it is interfering with the high I get
from listening to well-loved tunes.
	(Actually I think it's the motor of my turntable slowing down --
anyone know a good place to get a fix?)

DJ = public works administrator?

I live in the Santa Cruz Mountains, and have long thought they would be a
wonderful
backdrop for a rave.   Harmony made that dream come true.  "Rave summer camp"
on the last full weekend of summer.   Dancing outside in the afternoon.   I
gotta track
down some Platipus.  This is the second party I've heard a really tasty
track by them.
More wonderful music, not much dancing, most saving their energy and digesting
the food from the barbecue  [Thanks Tim!].  Then the outside system shut
down, and
I saw a moon and a star parading through the campground.  Someone [thanks,
whoever you are] clued me in that that meant that Stella Luna were about to
perform.
Stella Luna was a real treat!  I had never even heard of them before, let
alone heard them.
Lots of really spacey space between the Stella and the Luna!

Mucho trance in the main room.  Is it my imagination or have I been hearing
a lot more
trance lately?  I love to dance to this stuff, but I need to develop a
little more stamina to
dance to it all night.  Until then, I'll have to rest a bit from time to
time.  Which is where
the really excellent chill room came in.

This was a really really wonderful party.  Thanks to everyone who helped to
put it on.

I don't think I've ever done so much hugging in one day.

	You left out the people who are sex-crazy, druggy, *and*
spiritual!  Come on leftjab, think Dionysus, Greek god of wine, dancing,
orgies, and good times!
	Getting in touch with God needn't be an experience of sitting

     SHORT VERSION+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
     
     Harmony was cool.
     
     EXTENDED VERSION++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
     
     Stayed at band rehearsal until 11:00am Sat morn after 3 
     hours of sleep, and packed up to pick up the ride I 
     promised.
     
     Moonpup is a fucking trip... You will be most missed!  
     Badass set as well (scores most unique of the whole event I 
     think).  Very dopey trip hop, and a great way to get me 
     going (I didn't really ever give that stuff a chance 
     before... fuckin groovin!).  Mark and Milton spin some 
     killer yarns too... fuckin brilliant stories!~  Must visit 
     Europe soon!
     
     As for the party... very clean.  Only let down was the 
     absence of any hiking when I got there, but I'm glad I 
     didn't find anything (would have worn me out).  The place 
     was killer though, I guess it was a camp for a Hebrew school 
     or something like that.  Had a serene vibe that sometimes 
     seemed at odds with the big sound techno of the main room, 
     but went killer with drumming and dancing and sharing 
     outside.  There was lots of stuff to just check out (the 
     chill room was gorgeous... loved that tweaked looking pointy 
     thing with the designs projected on it).  Stella Luna 
     started setting off my evening with a dense mix of synth / 
     looping and groovin on various sonic toys, with a real 
     primal energy about it.  Much favored the second set to the 
     first.  It was nice to see the band set up forward of the 
     stage, playing drums, singing and Omming their way into a 
     tighter vibe with the chill people.
     
     As for dancing, I took off for the main room about 12:30 and 
     never went back.  Only time I left was when I had to get 
     more water or visit the Tidy Bowl man (who was suffering 
     from rising seas by morning if you catch my drift)... some 
     of the DJ's weren't that impressive, and Daniel seemed tired 
     (I think he played two other parties earlier the same day), 
     but the vibe really got going around 2-5.  Honestly it's all 
     a blur of gratuitous hugging, smiles, dancing, buildups, 
     lags, and breaks.  Couple of eyes rolled back in head what 
     the hell just transpired/when did the DJ's switch / what 
     happened to the last half hour type trances.  That's when I 
     love you all the best, coming back from one of those.  
     SMILE.  Mmmm... I corked out for a little while (in the main 
     room no less), then woke up to enjoy the sunrise... which 
     was fuckin awesome yet totally non-climatic.  I never 
     actually saw the sun, but the colors of the clouds were 
     changing the tweakiest shades of orange and pink and peach.  
     and the trees, and the sound of tired people from a long 
     great evening packing up.  Gorgeous.  Bonus Terry Mullin... 
     almost forgot to mention that.
     
     I did end up having to talk a couple people down over the 
     course of the evening, and that part kinda sucked.  Glad I 
     could fish a couple people out of a bummer though.  
     Chemicals are potentially dangerous, stay informed, stay 
     positive and be careful.  As for myself, I still have to 
     wait for my jaw to ease up, I tried eating fries this 
     morning and it HURT... clench clench clench.
     
     The Bummer:    It was kinda weird that so many people there 
     seemed like they all knew each other from high school or 
     something (lotta young Saratoga locals).  That's probably 
     the worst thing I could say about the party... it had some 
     clique factor going.  I'd like to meet more people there who 
     don't hang with a particular group.  More social that way.  
     I'd do it again a hundred times though!

Yes, I missed Rob unfortunately. I had wanted to hear him, esp after
Chrysalis, but it was difficult to find out what was happening at what
times. I've always longed for a schedule at parties (helps when there
are more multiple rooms, and when you're not sure when you should
arrive or leave).

Thanks for the correction. I should have known when I saw "JK" written
all over everything ;)

Rob was great, especially his second set (IMHO).

Actually, all anyone had to do was ask me (for the ambient lineup 
anyway) as I knew the lineup times for the ambient room. We did change 
things a bit as Terry Mullin was late (?) and Greg wanted Liquid (who 
was spinning in the ambient room) to cover. So Rob generously covered 
for Liquid as Liquid was covering for Terry.

The Golden Scans were supplied by Mark Mehlman at Pacific Coast Stage 
Lighting. They were on the floor as there was not any really good spots 
to hang them from; too many support beams and rafters that would have 
interfered if they were hung high and not enough throw distance for the 
light beams if hung below the rafters. I personally thought the main 
dance floor looked sweet! The two video screens with the very robotic 
looking Golden Scans were very nice!


Peace,

Hi.

Well, I'm making the leap back to Claris Emailer and my new easier to 
remember Email address of 'camp@mail.apple.com.  Last time I tried using 
Claris my email went to shit.  But this being a company wide switch, I'm 
forced to use it. 

So, if ya need to mail me, you can find me at camp@mail.apple.com

peace.

Hey everyone,

Last Friday, some of the folks who perform at Burning Man had a little
party at the Coconut Grove on Van Ness St here in SF.

The party was labeled as "Formal Attire or Dream Costume". Well, since I
have no dream costume, I decided to get fancy and rented a tux.

Good thing I did, because the place was pretty posh, with a capital "P"!

The first thing I noticed were lots of wonderfully vibby people
eminating incredible energy. Nice!

The reggae band kicked in and every started gyrating. Well, almost
everyone. There were a few people who seemed to be regulars at the
Coconut Grove who were a bit miffed at everyone having so much fun. Oh
well, their loss.

So gyrate I did. I suddenly realized that most of these people were
sober. Where did they get their energy?

After speaking with a few of the gyraters, I realized that this was
their normal state. Energy Junkies! These people were/are permanently
"keyed in". Right on!

I then remembered the thread on sober raving a while ago. And just
seeing all these wonderful people and dancing with them gave me the
encouragement to shine on.

The party was over at 2am with everyone still in high spirits. 

I then remembered something a freind mentioned to me a while ago.

"It's all about energy, man."

Yup.

See y'all at MAD!

;)

Sorry I didn't post this the first time (didn't have it), but here's the
complete detail for this Monday's Deep Listening Band concert.


MILLS COLLEGE CELEBRATES 30 YEARS OF CONTEMPORARY MUSIC:
PAULINE OLIVEROS HEADS ALL-STAR CAST OF CCM CELEBRITIES


NON STOP FLIGHT:  30 YEARS OF CCM
WITH PAULINE OLIVEROS
Pauline Oliveros and the Deep Listening Band
Stuart Dempster, David Gamper
The Hub
Abel-Steinberg-Winant Trio

Monday, September 16
PLEASE NOTE NEW START TIME:
a marathon, beginning at 7:00 p.m. and ending at 11:33 p.m.
Admission: $10/$5

Mills College Concert Hall
5000 MacArthur Blvd., Oakland
Information: (510) 430-2296

        OAKLAND, Calif. -- Mills College presents a concert to celebrate thirty
years of innovation and experimental music at the Center for Contemporary
Music.
The concert features Non Stop Flight by famed composer Pauline Oliveros.
Currently composer-in-residence at Mills, Pauline Oliveros was the first
director
of the Mills Tape Center (which later became the Center for Contemporary Music).
  In this special event, Oliveros will perform with the faculty of CCM as well
as the Deep Listening Band, the Hub, and the Abel-Steinberg-Winant Trio.

        Non Stop Flight uses a new version of the expanded instrument system,
a performer-controlled electronic processing environment.  The piece is
structured
so that all performers are playing continuously, with highlighted solos and
small
ensembles emerging at various times.  The music is improvisational and
meditative.
According to Oliveros, "This is not a set of pieces.  It's a non-stop
flight.  Included
is a memorial to David Tudor."  Tudor, who died recently at the age of 70, was
known as an avant-garde performer and composer.  He taught at Mills and was
a close associate of John Cage.

        The concert begins at 7 p.m. and will continue as a marathon
for several hours.  Audience members are invited to come and go as they
 please throughout the event.  General admission is $10, with a $5 admission
price for students, senior citizens, and disabled.  The concert is in the
Concert Hall, which is partially wheelchair accessible.  For further
information,
call (510) 430-2296.  Beautiful, historic Mills College is located at 5000
MacArthur Blvd. in Oakland, at the junction of Highway 580 and the Warren
(13) Freeway.  Visitor parking on campus is free.

Hi all!


 I'm looking for, what I call ambient/GOA/trance ala Return To The 
Source. I played a track off that as my last song at Harmony and really 
loved it! Any info at all would be great. =)

Thanks!

REGARDING THE WARNING SENT OUT BELOW:
Upon calling Lexus database @ 800-543-6862 [opt.3,opt.4}, the machine nicely
informs you that you must submit your request for removal in writing.  It
then politely calms your fears by assuring you that P-Trax only gives your
personal information to trustworthy folks, like lawyers, the government, and
law enforcement agencies.  This is sick, and I don;t understand how it's
legal, I'm going to try and find time to call the consumer affairs office
tommorow, I beg you to do the same. I've also faxed the 513 865 1930 # to get
my name removed.
BTW: it states that no credit information is included, and it never says
"your mothers" maiden name.
Suffocating in convenience,

(Please don't start some rhetorical flame about how this information is
everywhere and it's hopeless to fight it)

>>Your name, social security number, current address, previous addresses,
mother's maiden name, birth date and other personal information are now
available to anyone with a credit card through a new Lexis database called

making a telephone request.  Call (800)543-6862, select option 4 and then
option 3 ("all other questions") and tell the representative answering that

If anyone has any hotlists, or bookmarks or ideas for employment or contract
resources or agencies, etc.  I'd certainly appreciate their transmission.
 I'm looking for Graphic Design work, but occasionally I find this type of
work on the tech boards. (i.e. Dice)
Thanks,

P.S.(On a whim, I decided to put periods between the n.r.r. in the subject,
to try and skirt those who filter their mail by such parameters. I figured
these types of people will probably have the best bookmarks on this subject.
let me know if this spineless, sneaky, guerilla tactic worked on anyone. :)

I think that the appeal of the techno that we're hearing now is that it
borrows from EVERYTHING that came before it. I hear the influences of soul,
funk, r&b, rock, reggae, world music, disco, and jazz every time that I go to
a party. This could also explain why you can hear some really good dubbing
going on- it's just taking the raw elements and re-integrating them.

I think a family tree would have to really explore the parentage of the
elements that are being combined to create techno as it is today. Good
suggestion! I look forward to hearing from all those who can keep all of the
names of techno straight! I know that I'm having troubles.

Sabot-aged By Sore Foot at Harmony

 Well, I got to Harmony both "late" and "early". I had bought a ticket,
but was also going to help around . I got there around 12:45 , a bit late
to help Tim Knucklehead with setting up the BBQ, so I made myself useful
here and there. I also brought the bananas and the garlic bread, and would 
appreciate any useful feedback re: the garlic bread. ( Leslie - great 
potato salad! Also, mucho thanks to Tim , who fronted much $$ to buy food
for everybody! ) 

 It was so nice to see the Harmony crew make the event a reality! So much
energy - I was pooping out by late afternoon. Got to do some little 
boogy to Moonpup's tasty tunes. 

 By early evening, I was getting twinges in my left foot - I have some 
sort of ache in it that's been around for a few weeks now . My wife thinks 
it might be due to a lack of heel padding in one of my shoes . My latest shoe 
purchase was some steel toed Red Wing outdoor shoes with a steel shank
in the sole - and I didn't have this particular ache until these new pair
of shoes.

 Anyway, it only took a few minutes in the main room to make the pain/pleasure
ratio too high to ignore. I tried resting some, and taking some analgesics,
but then I just decided that resting my foot would be the best course
of action. So, I left at about 1AM! Bah!

 Sounds like everyone had a good time ! I'm glad to have helped in some
way to make this last Harmony a reality!

 Well, in today's San Francisco Chronicle ( Mon., Sept 16 ) is a big list
of job search web sites! Right on the front page of the business section,
page B1.

 If you're too late to buy a hardcopy front a newsrack, the Chronicle
has a web site ( http://www.sfgate.com ), although I don't know
if this list will be on there yet, or at all in the future.

Precedence: bulk

Well, I must definitely say that my roommate and I picked the right event to
start our raving life in NorthernCal! We were very pleased with what we found
at Harmony. Some things that we took note of:

-No speaker kids (these are highly decorated, usually younger ravers who
climb up    
  on the speaker towers and cheer everyone on.)
-A HUGE cross section of people! Way to bring it together, guys!
-A lot of first timers. More power to them!
-We brought pixie stix, ring pops, and starbursts to pass out and we got two 
  reactions;
                  1-they thought I was trying to give them drugs in the form
of candy
                  2-they were SO gracious (its a given that we bring candy
for                                                        
                      everyone-do you all not do that here?)
-there were some really BAKED individuals. And I mean BAKED. They musta
started 
  at noon and kept on goin'!
-that music was THE SHIT! We dug everything our ears could ingest. The
ambient 
  room was like nothing I've ever experienced-nice touch!

Overall, we had a great time. Everyone was so friendly. (Not that we were
surprised from watching the list.) I'll even say that I liked the event more
than most I've been to out of L.A. (Sorry guys back at home) I only wish that
I knew more people. I guess time will take care of that!

Happy to be in Monterey-

I had too much fun this weekend.  I know I had more than my allotted 
amount of fun, because now my body is getting back at me by being sick.  
Does anyone have any secrets for raving and staying healthy???

Too Much Fun, the annotated version:

Thursday Night -- drunken hot tub debauchery, with *17* butt-naked people 
piled into a hottub (including another SFRaver, who shall remain 
nameless!).  Definitely rivals e-piles for sheer physical fun with people 
in altered states!  Have to go to work way too early in the morning.

Friday Night -- drunken boisterous slamming around the edges of a mosh 
pit to grooving ska band.  Little sleep.

Saturday Night -- the MOST fun!!  Harmony was BEAUTIFUL!  I danced ALL 
night, to the most awesome trance, aided by the most awesome vibe and 
energy in the room - and a too-fun chemical cocktail.  No sleep.   

Monday comes, and brings with it sobriety and ill-health.  Sigh, too much 
fun has its price.  But can one party and still be a healthy person, or 
is a drawn-out recovery impossible to avoid??  I'm drinking orange juice 
and taking vitamins, but wish there was a way to painlessly binge...  
Health secrets, anyone?

P.S.	THANK YOU HARMONY for an AMAZING party!  I won't review, because 
"it's been done" :).  But this was one to remember!

Does anyone know the answer to this question?  All I know was that I was 
very happy on the dancefloor for the majority of the night.  Minor Minor 
was, as usual, awesome.  I also especially liked the dj preceeding him.

Thanks!

Aw Tom, thanks for thinking of us.  Believe me when I say that I wish 
with all my heart that I could have been there with all of you.  The 
great thing about our community is that there will always be great raves 
to be a part of.  I can't go to 'em all. :(

love,
Amy

How about taking seperate cars?  Maybe not real energy saving, but at 
least you will both be able to leave when you want.  Or have him carpool 
with folks who are also early leavers.  

Hey at least your boyfriend comes to raves with you if even for a little 
while.  Mine doesn't come at all.

Amy

Yes! Vitamins and orange juice the day after torturing yourself is not
going to work (it's like changing your oil after blowing your engine).

Things you should definitely do (or definitely consider):

1) Change your diet. Try to eat only pure, healthy foods on a regular
basis. You don't have to become a vegan, but it helps ;) Fruits and
vegetables contain so much good life energy and nutrition. You'll feel
bouncier after a few weeks of eating like this.

2) Don't use drugs. Drugs leave behind sludge that you don't need in
your brain. Learn to feel happy and fun without chemical
enhancement. Extra bonus: There's no "coming down" from a natural
high.

3) Spend your week (in the "real" world) being as positive and happy
as much as possible. Look at the bright side of things; nothing is all
bad.

4) Chai tea and fruit smoothies. I would not be the same without them!

The goal is to rid your body of toxins, whether they are physical or
spritual. Once you do that, you will always be energized at parties
(or anywhere else) and always refreshed the next day at work.

If you're looking for a quick fix, then I don't know of one. My
suggestions take a long time to set in. If you already do this
stuff, then drink lots of coffee, and hope for the best :)

Glad to have met you @H3!, btw.

Steve the healthy raver

well I'd like to thank & congratulate the H3 promoters for producing a
lovely party. 
 
my highlites were...... 
 
the location / tent village...... 
 
hanging out in the small forest between the main room / tent city..........

 
the bubble boys in the morning......and the incredible bubbles they
produced 
 
throwing around the nerf bomb laughing, saying don't worry you can hear it
coming.........and having it hit some poor girl square on the head, and it
didn't even hurt her ......phew.........and having kenneth paul to throw it
back to me 
 
the chill space.......beautiful set-up and staging...... 
 
walking to the holocaust memorial building in the morning 
 
finding the groceries I dropped, thanks to some good folks....... 
 
dancing like a maniac to Major Major, for about 15 minutes....... 
 
room to dance 
 
hanging out with Tim 
 
hanging out with Wayne 
 
meeting Shawna 
 
meeting SFRavers and putting  faces to the names  
 
the happy tent (painted with glo paint) 
 
finding a group of english friends who are my age (well almost) so I felt I
had a clique of contemporaries to hang out with too !!! 
 
playing music outside during the late afternoon, and especially Jay Baum's
song "The Underground" (a rap track) and having people kind of get it. 
 
peeing in the forest (sorry greg :) 
 
drum circle 
 
people screaming in unison through-out the nite 
 
watching some real cool crazy wacky characture wearing a purple tam, having
the time of his life 
 
 
lowlites: 
 
forgetting the names of 3/4 of the people I met 
 
crappy gear 
 
missing mid-range on the main system 
 
missing the moonshadow song 
 
having my santa cruz conection pull a no show  
 
not having more of my friends there (FnF, BM, etc....) 
 
not hanging out with leslie 
 
security guards dressed in black miltant riot gear, with police batons
etc.... 
 
west coast break beat in the chill room 
 
I can't remember any more hi/lo-lites.....it mostly all highlites and good
times !!!! 
 
I think It will be a party that goes into my top list of 50 all time
parties......I am glad I went, and I got some great pictures .......... It
is a party that was attended by 2 other friends that were at a festival
called "Out There" in France, the Burning Man in Nevada, and a complete
social victory for the banished art of dancing in the streets, called
"Reclaim the Streets" in London,. Unfortunately for me, I have yet to go to
Goa, however  they were already both attending some of the same parties
there earlier this year........                                  
                                                                moonpup

Any bets they're using the billing from the 800 number along with caller ID
(which you
can't block when calling an 800 number) to make an even bigger list?

	If one is going to give up/not eat or use the things mentioned 
above, then coffee is probably one of the least appriopate things to be 
adding to your body. This nice legal drug is as destructive on your 
digestive system and CNS as most any of what many people take in any 
scene, as well as being a diurectic which will add to ones dehydration 
quickly (although you will piss clear, after you're done, your body has 
purged itself of most of its water reserves, so if you go back to dance 
without taking a few big swigs, you're going to get dehydrated and 
dehydration weakens your body's ability to sense when things are 
invading)...

Hello everyone,

    This Saturday, Sep. 21, the Harmony and 100 Acre Woods crews will 
be throwing a party to celebrate life, love, and family. Join us as we 
bridge the gap, through music and dance, to celebrate Greg's B-Day and 
the healing of our wonderful friend Omar. We would like everyone to try 
to make it out to this, so we can show Greg and Omar how much we love 
them and so we can send some much needed love, healing energy, and 
money to Omar and his family, as well as Greg.

    We will be starting at 9pm and going until 6am. The party will be 
in S.F. so check the vm# for more info. The #'s are 415-263-4885  
408-486-9591  408-450-3044. DJ's are Ethan, Dano, Trent, Cloud and more 
to be announced. We hope you all can make it out to help us celebrate 
this wonderful event.

    This is Matt, Greg's roommate, and I'm the one planning the event. 
So please don't respond to this e-mail since this is a suprise post and 
Greg doesn't know about it. He does however know about the party so you 
can talk to him about it. If you would like to help or contribute 
anything to the party, or just want more info, please page me at 
408-488-7786, leave your number and the code 101, and I will get back 
to you as soon as possible.

Thanks, 
        Matt  ''
             \--/
Ps: Harmony was insane! But as soon as Greg recovers and is able to 
walk (upright) he will post all of the financials as well as talk a 
little bit about the party. He had a lot of fun, but really isn't 
moving yet. So stay tooned...

I believe the digestive system part, but I've heard nothing about
coffee being destructive to your CNS. Care to back that up/add
some more details?

Side note: Steve the caffiene crusader has significantly cut down on
coffee usage and has felt coincidentally healthier.

>international styles -- africa etc.....

Er uh, this is some list....

I am not going to get into  who started what when.  Since man developed
grew and moved OUT of Africa some long time ago, I would think we could
easily assess that European musical form came sometime later...FAR AFTER
the aforementioned international styles....

Eurocentrism....puhleeze.

First came man, of course, from Africa.  Then came the beat. The rest is
history.

As far as American music goes, there are only two that were created on
these shores, Native American, and African (blues, jazz, call & signify).

(Jazz has been called the only true american art form...I agree.  Of course
there was blues and call & signify which are/is directly AFRICAN!).

The rest is certainly history.

I hate an  incomplete historical perspective.

Out,
John

	Hi All :)

	I'm temporarily unsubbing as i'm movin' about but i wanted to
mention that i'll be at "auto" this weekend (info in the calendar).
Anyways, Claude Young and DBX are spinning, both excellent Detoit djs so if
you love Detroit techno and/or Chi-town house, check it out.

	I'll be the guy who's 6' lots of silver hoops in his ears, with the
blue fatigues, probably a fuzzy cyan angora hat and a T-shirt that says
"Superiority Through Constant Mutation." Don't be scared, i don't bite ;)
So come up and say hi if you're there.

Harmony was truly something special!!

I thought I knew what to expect, but what happened that beautiful 
saturday night surpassed my wildest dreams. =)

A few highlights:

- Tim, your BBQ was perfect! Thank for providing all that food and 
slaving over the heat.

- Setting up with Mike, Adam, and Chin. Seeing the place tranform into
  a rave wonderland was incredible!

- Watching all the happy ravers arrive on the Harmony school buses,
  screaming and cheering =)

- Not being able to take three steps without encountering a smile!

- Finally getting to really chat with some of you SFRavers! (you know 
who you are)

- Hearing the main room go "Wuuump, Whuuump, Whummmp, Whummp, Boom, 
Boom, Boom" from the outside.

- Allegra piercing my soul with her voice.

- Catching Greg actually smiling a couple times =)
 
- Seeing all of YOU again!

Harmony's three year was amazing! New ravers were born, friendships 
were made, and together we were able to produce enough postive energy 
to fill a small country. I was glad to be a part of it, and may be 
suffering from afterglow for the rest of my life.

I love you all!!!

I would say that the beat came well before man, since everything is really

Actually, I think the beat came 1st.  Everything has rythm.  Plus, a lot of

        Starchild's absolutely right . . . there's nothing wrong with being
sex-crazy, druggy, & spiritual (or a teenager, duh) . . . and I might've
exhibited all of these behaviors recently on my own spiritual quests :).

        Perhaps I should've said "just sex-crazy, druggy . . ." because
that description doesn't nearly cover the entirety of the scene.   It is
the prevalent media description, though, and from the reports of people who
attended the screening the focus of the Leeza show.  The media coverage of
the sensual and drug aspects of the scene should emphasize the spiritual
aspirations of many ravers, both those who partake and those who don't.


peace,

I know I've already gone way over my bandwidth limit for the day... but
more memories are demanding to be shared... mostly triggered by Steve's
post (dammit, Steve - I read "I kick ass for the LORD" and laughed
uncontrollably at work for about 5 minutes - I think I drooled on my
XTerminal :)

... at the Harmony home, finding a frog which I had given to some
wonderful person at the Beautiful People on Mission, and being amazed at
the small world we live in ... being awakened after an hour of sleep by
fluorescent orange hair, and finding myself still bouncy and excited ... 
breakfast with Mattloaf and Blossom ... playing with a parrot & even
giving the parrot a mint ... getting peoples' names wrong ... petting a
beautiful person's hair backwards twice before getting it right ... having
to pee, then just dancing 'till it went away ... seeing freqout and
aleph1, familiar people in an unfamiliar setting ... crushing hugs upon
meeting Mattloaf's significant other ... Eric P's yummy peach & bread ...
a really really good smart drink ... the collective screaming ... hanging
out briefly in the little niche in the trees ... hugging random strangers
...  smiling up at people while lying on the side of the path staring at
the stars ... getting stickers stuck to me ... entrance duty, watching the
sun come up alone ... pancake in the morning ... being tickled by a
feather on a stick ... chai tea for the first time ... drinking a double
iced espresso and then falling asleep 2 minutes later ... realizing just
after hitting the send button that I spelled Caryn wrong in my last post
:) ... 

  I'm going to take a nap and head off to Mad, where I intend to collect
the missing hug from Matt Lanier!

Is there sound in space, a beat...I dunno....anyway I was talking about MAN
(Humankind) use of beats, not the universe.

Man is out of Africa.  Thus the development of the beat.

Of course you have to buy into certain rules of evolution, migration, etc.
But we know where we as humans came from, and it certainly didn't start in
Europe (although some good things come from there as well as everywhere
else).

Moon's chart was screwed anyway, not his intention.  So who knows what he
was really trying to say in just 72 columns! :)

Peace all,

At this incredible party, I giggled incessantly, saw almost every raver I
know, danced in the DJ booth with Brian from Moontribe, e-piled, wandered,
hugged, kissed with innocence, frolicked in a fairy tree village, drank two
flavors of smoothies, saw a cheese tie from Wisconsin, sat on the grass in
the light mist snuggled next to good friends to generate heat because I was
just too lazy to go get my coat, and cuddled the tiniest possible PUPPY.

   COULD IT HAVE BEEN ANY BETTER?????  I DON'T THINK SO!!!!!!

One way-too-happy happy raver,

Hey, I just got a cool flyer at mad tonight. And they don't get much
cooler: yellow paper with thick black marker (I can still smell
it)

Definitely catch this one (not a BSP):

'Realize a World without Violence'
A Benefit

Help us continue our mission to server
free food on this city's streets

For our community
@ El Rio's 9/26 (Thursday)
9pm, Sliding scale admission

in solidarity with Food Not Bombs
415-985-7087

DRC
Mars
Mystr-E
DJ Tom (is that you Tom???)

I was seriously impressed by the simple, handmade flyer. It reminded
me of my hardcore/punk days when flyers like this would float around
all the time.

cu there!

Steve

So, there hasn't been a big free all-night beach party in way too long

On Friday September 27th, there will be!

Starting with a Drum Circle at sunset going to coffee juice etc in the
morning

Bonfires, Tiki Torches, naked dancers (weather permitting - this DJ will
spin naked! :)

Featuring the planetary debut of the crusty old raver Himself spinning for

your bemusement

More info soon!

Jim Cyr & Matt Stone
(surfpunk@well.com)

By the way - we could sure use some help lugging equipment and helping get
the breakfast thing together - this event will actually start at 4:30 in the
afternoon on Friday and go to 8:OO am on Saturday

Forgive me if I said this already (I'm not sure if my emailer sent it), but
there's a 2xCD set called The Chakra Journey/Return to the Source.  I KNOW
we carry it at x-radio, although I just checked our catalog and it's not
listed for some reason...

best,

Speaking of RTTS ;o)
Who is going to the RTTS rave/gathering in NYC?  It's Sept. 21!
I know one of you on this list is!  We want a review when you get back :-)!

ps...you can probably even order or get both RTTS (the first one and the
second one) at Tower, of all places

This is just a quick hello to introduce myself!  My name is Ariel and I
although I have met several sfravers (hi Adam, Steve, Todd, etc...), I am
new to the list as well as to this fair city!  Yes, I am a recent immigrant
from up north...I just moved down from Seattle where I was active in
what we *like* to call the party scene up there (although, Seattle only
WISHES it could compare to the community down here) as well as
NW-Raves, the regional list in for the Pacific NW.

Before I moved down a few weeks ago, I  was lucky enough to catch a
few choice parties on visits...I made it to MADNESS in May (that was fun
defined) and to a Beautiful People in August.  Since moving down to San
Fran (well, ahem, Hayward, to be exact) I've been lapping up the last of
the Harmony parties before they slip away (yes last weekend WAS tha
bomb).

So, there's my brief introduction.  Now I'll try to be quiet and just listen for
a while (quite difficult for me) till I get the hang of things here on the
list...although if anyone has any desire to discuss all things Seattle, let
me know!  I look forward to talking to everyone!

PLUR,
Ariel

HI

So.......................

Greetings!
My sincerest apologies to anyone who was on the mailing list on my 
message earlier today.  I realized after I had sent the message that I 
had neglected to erase such information as other peoples addresses.

I was so concerned with getting the body of my message out that I had 
neglected to observe the proper protocol.  I do request, however, that if 
you are to forward this my message entitled "Warning," do erase those 
addresses for me.  I would apreciate that greatly.  Thank you for your 
time and your help.

Sincerely,
Andre Lucero

The Limelight should be closed. Their management and staff's ego alone
would justify the city/DEA/FBI closing the doors.

Marcy and I were in NYC around the end of June and I have never seen so
much attitude from club staff -- ever.

When you are on the "guest list" that means that you "only" pay $10 instead
of $15. No cameras are allowed, either. So I was forced to check my camera
in coat check. While we were down there the coat check person offered to
sell us some "X" but I refused. I already knew that the owner and staff of
the Limelight were dirty when I read that the DEA had busted them with 6000
hits of e just a few weeks earlier. This confirmed my suspicions that this
place sucked.

Anyway, we did the camera in the coat check routine and went back upstairs
to go through the metal detector gauntlet and found that we were going to
pay $10 each for the honor of being guest listed and said hell no.

We went immediately back downstairs and found that the ass behind the coat
check had taken out my camera's batteries and they were nowhere to be found
(2 AA's). So in the end, we got the "Limelight Experience" without even
actually having to go into such a poser venue.  It only cost us 5 minutes
and two batteries. It was a deal.

Other than this little blip on our NYC radar, we had a *great* time in NYC.
Lots of bar/lounge hopping, lots of record stores, lots of culture.

Hey Everyone,

	Even though this has been my 1st real rave summer, I have become so
facinated with every aspect of the scene that I've been looking into
voluntering my time with the promoting and throwing of parties. But my
delema is who should I start working for? I only made this decision
early last week so right now part of my plan is to take a sort of
critical look at the parties that I go to in the next couple of weeks.
Who's throwing it? Whats the general feeling? Does this seem like the
kind of group I would want to work with?

My motives for becomming involved are very well intended. I feel that
being at a party that _you_ helped put together, standing back to see
and feel the vibe that you helped make possible would be a TOTALY
satisfying rush. :)

Does anyone have any advice? Anyone I should avoid? Do YOU need an extra
hard working person for your next party? I'm all ears....

Peace,

-=Pengo=-

Well, it looks like I am subscribed to SFraves twice!!

as camp@gala.apple.com and camp@mail.apple.com.  (thanxs Andy!!)

So I tried unsubscribing the gala address, Majordomo sent a succeeded 
message back.  But I'm still receiving 2 copies of each SFR message!!

I sent a message to majordomo with 'who sfraves' in the body and this is 
what I got back:

>>>> who sfraves
**** Subscriber information not available.

I'm confused,

-M

sorry if I'm taking up bandwidth, but this is frustrating!!!!:)

One of the funniest moments I had was when I was living in New York was
when I went to talk to -I have totally forgotten his name now- 
this supposed Slimelight bigwig because he needed promoters.  
I figured what the hell, I'd try to help him out...maybe at least 
I could get some friends in for free one night.   So we were all
put on the "guest list"...meaning as you said, $10 instead of $15.
What-EVER!  I'm promoting for them, and I'm supposed to PAY $10 to go?
We split right away of course.  But the funniest thing was talking to
him about it later...we started talking about being nice in general, and
he started giving me this lecture about "business, and being nice 
doesn't pay" and that someday I would "grow up and realize that 
that (being kind) just isn't the real world," and I would
have to become part of HIS world if I wanted to "get anywhere".  At that
point, I realized more than ever  
			1.  that I should get out of NYC ASAP
			(sorry, but this attitude was just so rampant there)
			2.  the HUGE differences between raves and
			clubs, and how I had no desire to ever "go
			clubbing" ever again...

    PrAiSe Be To RaVinG!!! ;o)

That's not your only dilemma.  Grab the yellow pages, turn to S for Shrink,
and have your head checked!    Drop the idea before it gets too big,
otherwise, intensive therapy might be your only hope.  Let someone else
throw the parties and pay the lousy $20 to get in, at least you'll have a
good time.   Otherwise you'll be dealing with debts, cops, paperwork, dirty
warehouses and entire weekends without sleep.

Run while you still can, kid.




OK, you're going to work for anyone, I recommend the BeautPeop/Harmony
folks.  I've heard rumors that they're very solid, decent caring folks.
And they throw a heck of a party, if you haven't yet been.

I think the single most effective way of showing your sincere committment
to helping a group, short of offering a sound system for free =), is to
stay and help clean up a party.  I can't express in words how difficult it
is sometimes to clean a party, especially big ones like this past weekend's
Harmony, after working for 24 hours straight.  (Imagine picking up the
thousands of cig. butts that were scattered all over creation on that
field.)

It's relatively ungratifying, for their isn't that pre-party rush once the
party is over, but it has to be done.  When people stay and help it truly
is like having a little elf come and sweep a floor or do something else
that in the back of a groups collective mind is one more thing that needs
to be done.

It takes time to establish trust, and so investing your time and energy is
what you must do.  It is, as you say, a rush to know that some of you is in
the party.

That's why I do it.  In fact "I just did it, and I'm gonna do it again!"  =)

I hear you. And yes this too has been something I've been thinking
about. Promoting parties may not be all that it's cracked up to be. This
is definatley something I'm concidering. 

But one thing.

I *really* hope you didn't mean this:

>  Let someone else throw the parties and pay the lousy $20 to get in

cmon man, what would the scene be like if more people thought like this?
Raves in a very short amount of time have done wonders for me. My
self-seteem is much improved. I'm more confident, more aware, many
blurred areas of my life have scence become clear. I'm not afraid of
making sacrifices to give back to the scene. You people have done so
much for me. I just feel the need to give back.

Just thought I'd add that helping out at a party is a *lot* of grunt
work. At H3, I was exhausted before the party had even started. If
you're going to do it, be prepared to get dirty, sweaty, and tired. And
also be prepared to be sweeping rave-spooge at 8 in the morning.

The Harmony people are very cool, and very receptive to having people help
out with their parties.

Also, if you're ever interested in throwing your own event someday,
helping out even with grunt work is a good way to see what goes on
behind the scenes before actually leaping into it.

Subject: Dear Abby style emotional haul... 
Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

     
     I was asking about this a couple weeks ago amongst some old friends, 
     with mixed responses.
     
     Does anybody here get some heavy mood swings (dancing alone in my room 
     totally groovin to the new Hardfloor to sitting reading depressing 
     history books by myself until 4am on weeknights.. while remembering I 
     really should call my folks more often but it's too late and I'm just 
     plain a little lame) after raving or raveing?
     
     Raving:
     If it hit one sober, I usually notice I just feel kinda afterglow the 
     next day, and get a little uppity that next evening, or kinda bummed 
     if I don't find something to do.  As a general rule I have to stay 
     pretty busy.  My house usually gets pretty clean the first couple days 
     of the week after a good one.  I wouldn't say it's downright 
     depressing, but I do tend to get bored easier, as well as have some 
     trouble sleeping, even though I might be tired.
     
     RavEing:
     My oh my.  Mood swings bigger, more intense, but easier to deal with 
     in a way because they're easier to justify (its the chemicals man..).  
     They also fade in slower.  Seems like 2-4 days after the event 
     (usually I'm still wicked grinning the day after).  Feel like spending 
     mucho time with other people, solitude is somewhat depressing.  Work 
     is a pain in the ass, but do-able.  Coffee is great at the onset, but 
     coming down or jonesing for coffee seems to turn me into a evil 
     bastard.  Same with hunger.  Driving in traffic after working all day 
     becomes very difficult (I've still got that LA wild hair) without 
     reaching for the glovebox (just kidding).  I get major munchie attacks 
     (my pantry got cleaned out just last night actually).  In general, I 
     have to struggle to fight off the very tendencies I'm so I feel so far 
     away from when on E.  I tend to snap, judge, and decide too quickly.  
     It DOES teach me restraint that serves me for a much longer time (i.e. 
     full blown positive personality modifications have been noticed since 
     I started raving), but it kinda freaks me out.
     
     Has anybody noticed a cycle like this?  The tendency exists for me 
     whether or not chems are involved, but it's much more profound in the 
     post chem state.  It's just that there's so many facets to raving, 
     with the sleep deprivation, the sense of community, the marathon 
     dancing, the socializing, the relaxed society, hugging and I almost 
     always go all night.
     
     Is it that after having so good a time everything else seems mundane?  
     Is it that I need to find the elements in raving I find the most joy 
     in and bring them into my day to day life (good morning boss!  skip 
     skip skip ... hug.  Here's the schedule for the next two quarters... 
     want a sticker?).  Is it that I really am stuck in a pretty 
     suppressing environment (San Jose, PC Manufacturing Company, ties, 
     reports, no veggie stuff in cafeteria, ewww) and need out (this theory 
     does hold major water for me right now).
     
     Sorry for being bum, I just know some of you have gone through this 
     crud before.
     
     Love,
     AndyW
     
     Mindlessly spewing emotion at the multiverse... until my old best 
     friends get here to help me celebrate my 25th B-day this weekend (that

Dear Friends,

If you've wondered why you haven't heard much out of
FringeWare over the past few months, here's our story:

The Earth is a harsh mistress, and consequently we have
lost everything, even the backups. Four years worth of
everything -- but we've come back, perhaps even stronger
than before.

End of story. Or, rather, a nuther beginning...

Now we'd like to make contact with all the kind beings
who've participated in this Internet discourse over the 
past few years. All that we have to start from is a very 
old version of our email list and press release list.

You may receive a couple copies of this message, depending
on whether we've known you by different email addresses in

We apologise for the inconvenience, and welcome your

Hello again,

    Due to lack of sleep last week, a ton of stress, and just really 
pushing myself to the limits on Saturday, I have gotten ill. I don't 
really want to party on my b-day while I am sick, or even not be able 
to go at all, and miss the party, so Matt has postponed it until 
Saturday the 28th on September. I am sorry for this, but I think it 
will be a lot better anyways!!! (trust me)

    So I really hope to see all of you there, it is going to be fun!!!

Peace,

Greg :)

Subject: Harmony's responce and thank you!!! (H3)
To: sfraves@hyperreal.com
Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

Hello sfraves!,

    Well, well, well... I have finally gotten the brainpower to do 
this!! So, here it goes!!!

    A big, giant, f**king galactic size thank you to everyone who 
helped out with that party!!! It took close to 150 people to set that 
up, work and tear down!!! That is completly insane!!! (usually it's 10 
- 50 people) I thank every single one of you for your devotion to 
making the 3 year happen. Even though I missed the meeting on Wed., 
even though I might have been a little stressed (and hard to deal 
with), you guys pulled it off!!! I love all of you!!! It is a really 
good sign to know that the community can come together and help Harmony 
become the reality it is!!! Thank you!!!

    Now a super-sized, ultra loud shout of thank you to everyone who 
came and supported the 3 year, and our goals. We wanted to achieve 
complete "Harmony" between the performers, the promoters, the djs, the 
crowd, the surrounding nature, and everything else that was a part of 
the event. We achieved our goal! The sounds of everyone screaming in 
unison, the positive vibe that you could not get away from, and energy 
that was surrounding the camp was incredible!!! We are proud to say, 
that in a unanimous vote, you guys made the 3 year anniversary of 
Harmony, the best party we have ever thrown!!! We are very thankful to 
all of you, and the rest of the Harmony family!!! We love you!!!

    This party was in the works for almost a year, it was such a rush 
to see our dreams unfolding before our eyes. Being responcible for that 
event, was the greatest feeling that I (and the rest of the crew) have 
ever felt. We didn't make any money, (I am pretty sure we didn't lose 
any money) but that is definately not our concern. The 3 year was our 
last big Harmony (or at least for a long, long time). We weren't 
concerned about the $, in fact we were planning on losing $, but by 
some stroke of luck we didn't!! Anyways, what I am trying to say is 
that being the promoter of that party was simply incredible!!! (and I 
speak for the entire Harmony crew when I say that!) 

    The total budget for those of you who care was about $21,000 (give 
or take $500 or so). The total revenues of the event just barely 
covered that price. (this includes the water money) So, this was the 
highest budget party that Harmony has ever put together, and it paid 
off!!! Thanks to everyone!!!

    As for the future of Harmony itself, that's a tough one to talk 
about. Seeing what occured last Sat. really left a tremendous impact on 
the crew. Harmony Productions will still be throwing parties, (we can't 
stop, and will keep going until the last raver on Earth says, "I had 
enough!"). Look for all the "Beautiful People" parties, as well as 
"Hunny", "Tigger" (which is Omar's benefit), and more to be announced!! 
So stay tooned in to what we are doing, cause we aren't done yet!! As 
far as the actual party called "Harmony", I believe that was the last 
one, but only time will tell...

    Well, we all had a really great time on Saturday and hope that you 
did as well! It was a blast!!!

Peace and positivity!!!

Greg :)

Ps: if you lost anything from the party please let us know we have a 
lot of stuff, including a car stereo, so call us!!! (408)486-9591

        They have pictures of some weird little picture things that are
supposed to be buttons or whatever for SFRAVES. I thought they looked pretty
crappy. I was bored so I got them all, fixed a couple up, and put it all
together with my nimble little steed. My schools printer is half decent so I
printed it out and it looked all right (as in OK). My dad has a laminator
thing that I wanted to try and use. Whenever I get around to it, I'll
probably make about 10 or so of mine. 
        I wonder what the ones Adam has look like? Are they the same as the
downloadable pic's?

Andy,
Wow.  This is way cosmic.   I was thinking about sending out a similar
message  just *an hour ago*, asking if anyone felt mood swings in the way
I've noticed them.   But the I thought, nah, who'd care?   In the last
couple of years, I've noticed a cyclical mood pattern, on a monthly basis,
something akin to a woman's cycle.  'Ceptin', of course that I ain't a
lady.

My body follows the moon cycles, I'm sure of it.  I know when a full moon
is coming without looking at the calendar.  About a week before the full
moon I go through a phase of giddiness, then a few days of clarity and
focus right around the full moon, and then, sadly enough, I spend about 2
weeks or so in a sort of unfocused, mixed up state of mind.

I guess my only reassurance is that I feel GREAT right around the full mon,
and that I know the feeling will be back in another month.  Of course the
coffee/chemi/crack/Coors and crank throw another wrench into the
mechanism...something to be careful of if our bodies have peculiar
reactions to outside pollutants.

But, something to think about...our bodies are, what? 95% water?  If the
moon is strong enough to control the tides, surely it must have some sort
of affect on our wee bodies.

It was pretty damn weird to see your post right after thinking about
sending out one of the same theme.  Ever read "The Celestine Prophecies"?
Hmmm....Our psychic energies are starting to link up.

As a test, try to keep clean for a month, and follow the moon cycles on
your calendar.

Evolve.

oh, yes...

i've been noticing a hard comedown after raving, too.

absolutely it has everything to do with raves being a lot of fun and
work/day-to-day shit not being very fun at all.

and i also begin to realize how alone i feel when i'm not with good
friends. this is, i think, a combination of, on the one hand, a real
loneliness which i was comfortable ignoring until i found a group of loving
people via raving, and, on the other hand, a very real side effect/flip
side of E (for me, at least.)

but i've always felt bummed a few days after a really fun event... i used
to go to jazz festivals to perform with my high school band, and a couple
days after a good one, i would just feel way down.

maybe we should form an after-party support group. :)
(wait a minute, that might actually be a good idea... any takers?)

love,

brian

We in the medical community call this:  PHD -- Post Hedonism Depression.
It's a very real disorder and one that can only be cured by more hedonism!!
=)

I too suffer from this dastardly syndrome, but it's much easier to conquer
with a warm bath and a lover by your side.

Seriously though, drugs fuck with the naturally occuring drugs in your
body.  You're altering the balance of your own egosystem.  As has been
mentioned before, there are about as many recipes for post-raving cures as
for hangovers, howevere unlike my cure for a hangover (drink more beer =),
I find Tyrosine to work well in helping to resort my emotional balance
after raving.

Peace and pissing!

Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com

     Okay...
     
     You can buy the ones Adam has (beautiful SFRAVES with kind of an 
     intelligent green lights blasting out from behind the black 
     background, but I'm always afraid to come near him... I've seen how 
     nuts he is with those glow sticks).
     
     Laminate making for the DYI SF-Raver....
     
     You'll need 
     *   One PC/Mac/Workstation
     *   One groovin graphics program (some shareware ones are pretty damn 
     clean)
     *   A diskette
     *   A local kinko's
     *   An idea of what you want to do.  Ideas are all over, think of fave 
     personalities, images, hallucinations, or designs.  Keep the SFRAVES 
     part of it central so you don't lose the benefit of having a laminate.
     
     Make a design.  Rather than actually create art, I take other people's 
     stuff and tweak it till it's better (visual sampling?).  I try to work 
     everything out so I'm looking at a 2" x 3" thing.  I mess with it for 
     hours.  I make sure it says SFRAVES in big letters somewhere on it, 
     and look fuckin weird from far away so people have to see what it is.  
     I finally feel satisfied.  I save the file to the diskette of love.
     
     I carry the diskette of love to Kinko's, where I start up their 
     beautiful PC complete with outdated versions of many popular programs 
     (including Corel 4.0, my programs of choice as Kinko's goes).  Within 
     5 minutes, you can log in, log out, and print.  (The timer on the 
     computer is how long you use it, not how long it takes the printer.)
     
     Now stand indignantly by the printer and wait anxiously for your 
     handiwork to come screaming out (use the best/most expensive printer 
     they have).  I recommend having your design print both sides of your 
     laminate to one peice of paper (time, ink and paper saving!).
     
     Now it's arts and crafts time.  Go to the table with the scissors... 
     you know the one.  Cut out the front side of your beautiful design.  
     Use that as a template for cutting out the other side so they match 
     perfectly.  Now paste them together.  Okay, it's not paste... use the 
     gluestick.  Not too much...
     
     Walk to the counter, and ask to have them laminated.  Punch a hole in 
     it.  You are now badass.  Pick your favorite string, or chain and 
     sling that puppy up.  Wear it everywhere.  Scare your coworkers and 
     classmates.  Tell the world you made it, because you did.
     
     The whole thing should cost you about $3.42 or so.  The expensive part 
     is misprints or time spent on the PC... so keep these to a minimum 
     (plus smile in knowing you saved a branch or two!).  Do as much of the 
     work as you can at home.
     
     If you want to do more than one, you save a lot of money.  Also 
     remember to never try to print within half an inch of the paper's 
     borders (more on some printers).
     
     I think the coolest part of this is you can do it at 4:00am, as 
     certain Kinkos have 24 hour desktop publishing.  Perfect for an 
     inspired moment.
     
     AndyW
     
     P.S.       I hadn't seen Michal's SF Raves T Shirt till this 
     weekend... MUCHO BADASS!!!!

  For me, this required an outlook change about a year ago.  I had been
experiencing something similar to this - where I would go through an
intense, wonderful experience and then be down for awhile.  About a year
ago, I started to realize that intense, beautiful experiences were
anywhere and everywhere I looked for them.  I no longer need a thousand
beautiful people and 50,000 watts of sound system as an excuse to smile
(though they are a fantastic reason to do so!)  There is beauty everywhere
(to me), and all I had to do was open my eyes a bit - take the time to
enjoy *everything*.

  By sheer coincidence, my signature file is currently displaying a brief
summary of this philosophy.  Cool!

** please note that i'm not trying to preach in any way - just relating my
   own experience!

  I hope everyone is having a great day so far, by the way!  *hugs* to
you all!

	that sounds like a wonderful idea. perhaps a post-rave gathering
at someone's house. a place to talk, relax, nap, eat, and just be after a
rave with some friends sounds like a nice way to end a rave weekend. you
hang out as long as you feel like or is convenient for the host. then when
you're really ready to go home, you do. and if not, maybe you can convince
the host to adopt you. ;)

Well, I know as soon as I move there, I will definately be up for 
something like that.  At least I have people to hang out with and let Mel 
and me crash at their place (namely Jon Logan and Wayne Correia).  Often 
there'd be at least 5 other people konked out as well.  I used to have to 
drive all the way back to Sacramento right after a rave and go to bed all 
by myself as I listen to the rest of my family clanging around doing 
their Sunday things.  I yearned for comedown company! 

love,
Amy

Hemp Festival. a fundraiser for prop 215 that runs from noon to 6))

for a number of reasons that can not ever be recreated, last year's free
Gathering in front of city hall ((as part of the canabis expo fair)) rates
as one of my better moments from 1995. This time around I don't even mind
shelling out $8 for 3 hours of music because I believe in supporting this
particalar cause.

speakers include Denis Peron, Jello Biafra + others.

 A boy was crossing a road one day when a frog called out to him
 and said, "If you kiss me, I'll turn into a beautiful princess".  He
 bent over, picked up the frog and put it in his pocket.

 The frog spoke up again and said, "If you kiss me and turn me back into
 a beautiful princess, I will stay with you for one week."  The boy took
 the frog out of his pocket, smiled at it and returned it to the pocket.

 The frog then cried out, "If you kiss me and turn me back into a
 princess, I'll stay with you and do ANYTHING you want." Again the
 boy took the frog out, smiled at it and put it back into his pocket.

 Finally, the frog asked, "What is the matter? I've told you I'm a
 beautiful princess, that I'll stay with you for a week and do
 anything you want. Why won't you kiss me?"

 The boy said, "Look I'm an engineer.  I don't have time for a
 girlfriend, but a talking frog is cool."

hey, let's not forget _hug_!

yeah, the couple of times that i've gone to hang out with people after
raving have been really nice.

i don't know about anyone else, but i'm never ready to be alone after a
rave... having 1 or 2 or 5 people to revel in ravE afterglow with is really
nice, and i think the lack of that experience is one of the things that
made the comedowns so difficult for me after the last couple of parties i
attended.

so anyway, i don't know when the next rave i'm going to be attending is,
but we should definitely try to put something together, perhaps
ahead-of-time.

love and HUGS,

brian

	MHg says:

	Harmony's 3rd Yr. redefined the meaning of a rave
	=)   <--- That says it all....
	=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

	I will say I was feeling quite down when I left the Leeza show, after
	they had tore up the total meaning of a rave, but Harmony proved
	all that negativity absolutely WRONG!!!

	I went to Harmony with a head cold and still had lots of fun ;)
	Liquid and I got there @ 2:00P and left @ 11:00P.  I very glad I
	went because even though I didn't dance the vibe was soooooo great
	I SWEAR it made me better!! Not to mention I got to see all my SFrave
	people and got lots of HUGS =)

						much love & lots of hugs,

On Thursday, September 26, there will be a techno/trance benefit for SF Food
Not Bombs and the Prisioners' Literature Project.

DJs include D.R.C., Mars, Mystr-e, and DJ Tom.

Cost will be 3-$5, sliding scale.  No one turned away for lack of funds.
There will lots of vegitarian food.

I have been on this list for about two weeks, and really like the vibe.  I
hope to meet some of you there.  Much to my dismay, I had to miss harmony.  :>(

If you have any questions, feel free to email me (or reply to the list).

Yeah but it's cool lookin, huh?

I have about 20 SFR laminates left, so the first 20 people that send
me an SASE will get get one wisked away to them. (sorry, but I'm out

Adam, still has a ton of 'em too. So hopefully between the two of us
we'll satisfy your laminate craving.(We've already distributed over 
300 of 'em) Oh, and I'll have a downloadable version on my website 
soon, too.

Hi Everybody,

Time to introduce myself. My name is Rudi and I just moved to the
Bay Area a few months ago. Ive been reading this mailing list for
around a week now. I moved to Santa Clara from Rochester, New York. I
moved to Rochester from the island of Mauritius (look it up on a map)
and finally I moved to Mauritius from Sheffield, UK.

I wasnt at harmony and I probably wont make it to a rave in the next few
months :( but watch out for me in December :->

Im into all forms of dance music and I love to dance. I am drug free,
nicotine free and recently stopped drinking alcohol. Ive never been to a
rave so I look forward to joining all of you wonderful folks from
SF-Raves in a few months.

I figured this little piece of humor was a good excuse for me to join
the fun. Anyways I take offense to that joke ... Im an engineer and I
have plenty of time for a girlfriend (oh wow !!) :)

Look me up on the web at http://www.aimnet.com/~rudir/

Peace,

Rudi

It's funny, but I rarely ever get depressed after a party, drugs or no
drugs, I think it's only happened a couple times, and that was a result of
actual personal problems that had occurred at the time.  I do love, however,
getting a group of my favorite people and hanging out at a friend's house
(yay BK! :), but I still find that upon occasion I just want to be alone
after a party.  Sometimes there is so much external stimulation and so much
happening constantly at a party, that afterwards I often want to be alone to
be allowed to "digest" everything I've experienced, to just mull it over,
especially when I have to go to work on Monday, which is usually the case.
Gotta get in that digestion & relaxation by myself before having to go in on
Monday & deal with the real world!  I do occasionally have trouble dealing
with the real world if I'm really tired at work, which is often the case
after a party (altho I am almost alarmed to admit that I was less tired at
work this Monday after Harmony and ingesting more types of partee favors in
larger quantity, than I usually am after a more normal party on a Monday. :/
So who knows, guess it differs from person to person.  Of course, this is
only when it's my choice to be alone.  It kinda sucks when I want to hang
out with people after a party and I hafta go home alone! :P
Anybody else here like to hang out a bit alone upon occasion after a party
to digest the events of the weekend? Or am I a Freak of Nature for feeling
this way? (no snotty comments, stan! ;)  


Love,
Shawna

 That's the trouble with DJs using their first name as their professional
tag - now we got two "DJ Tom" djs in the Bay Area! I don't know how many
Carlos there are.

hello all-

just wanted to welcome you to another wonderful edition of:

HUMP DAY!!!!

it's only 2 or 3 more days until this weeks raving season starts, plenty of
time to think about how much we bring raving into our day to day lives, and
what we choose to leave at the door  (or at least that's what wednesdays
make me think of!)

so, i don't know when i'll se ya'll, but i look forward to it!

I am always curious to see how our underground scene sometimes bubbles up
into the mainstream...

Has anyone checked out the latest issue of Spin, with the big story
on electronic music?

Haha, they are trying really hard to make underground electronic music
commercially viable.  I think most people know that to make big money,
the music industry needs a few bands that they can mass-market.  That
way they can make millions of CDs and ship them out over their finely-tuned
distrobution networks to Towers, Blockbusters, Sam Goodies, and Best Buys
around the world.

So, the article opens up with (what else) the Organic concert that was in
Big Bear... you know, the one with all the big "rave" bands.  They talked
about how a kroq dj was introducing the bands (but the selectively failed
to mention how most people booed him and kroq).

The go on in a pretty boring article talking about those bands that are really
big now, but who most ravers are pretty sick of... chemical bros, Goldie,
loop guru, Underworld.  All with big, colorful pictures of the bands 
(Ohhhh, ahhh!)

I once read in a article about a cynical Punk fan that the bands that
become really big out of a subculture are those which are universally 
recognized in the subculture to suck.

Now, sure, Orbital is pretty cool.  But In Sides and Snivilizaiton are pretty
weak compared to Orbital 1 and 2... and don't even get me started about
the Orb...  

Now, I didn't read the whole article, but I didn't see anything about DJ
culture... or mixtape culture.  That is what our scene is all about, yet
they completely gloss over it.  You just can't mass-market dj culture.
You need big names.  big stars.  big egos...

The only place i have seen mention of DJs and mixtapes in a mainstream
publication was on the MTV web site... a story done by socal's own
Tamara P.

Also, I saw no mention of recreational drugs...  Yes, they are trying
to create the clean-cut, mass-marketable, "sanitized" culture that the
rave scene isn't.  Personally, and remember, this is just IMHO, the
rave scene is a vehical for spreading the mind-expanding qualities of
certian recreational drugs.  No mainstream media would talk about the
positive effects lsd or mdma has on our culture.  So they filter all out.

The result?  BOOOORRRRIIINNGGGG!!!!  Everytime rave culture surfaces in
the mainstream, it sucks.  Who would be into this kind of sanitized
electronic music culture?  I mean, who is really into Chemical Brothers
CDs?  Yeah, I bought one... like 9 months ago!  The sound is pretty darn
stale now... yet it is the next cool thing according to Spin... yeah right.

I think we are pretty safe in the underground... safe from exploitation
by the mainstream.

Thanks for the rant time,

I have to agree with both of u.  I think it would be a wonderful idea to
have a "support" group for post-raving.  The only hard part might be
coordinating the people and finding a person nice enough to let a bunch of
people come over to their house.  But i say GO FO IT!

Peace and love,
Dan

All,

"The only hard part might be coordinating the people and finding a
person nice enough to let a bunch of people come over to their house"  

I volunteer my place as a possible Chill House candidate.  I think it
would be fun to do sometimes.

hello cosmic family,

like it says up there, i will be in SF Oct 4-6.  i'm not sure what's going
on for parties and stuff, i'm just going with the flow on that but i would
really love to get together and talk about
Conscious Manifestation with anyone who may be interested.  Conscious
Manifestation is a process of self-discovery and learning how to use the
combined powers of mind-emotion/spirit/physicality in balance with each
other to  create magic.  i am a student and nothing turns me on more
(except for enjoying the results of my process) than sharing what i've
learned and watching other people get turned on by it, ask shawna :)  let
me know what you think...i can't wait to see you :)

lots of love,

brenda

One of my first introductions to the SF scene was hanging out with a
group of kids at Beautiful People, and as the night wound its way
into morning, one of them approached me and said "You will, of
course, be cracking out with us today, right?"

Me, being unused to the lingo was like, "Uh, crack out?" thinking
"EW!! Oh god!  They all do e at night and then the sun comes up and
they start smoking CRACK!  Oh shit!"  Thankfully, it was explained
that what they meant was just be spun and unwind together...go back
to someone's apt. or house and fit as many people on beds/couches/
floors as possible and just RELAX, REFLEX and SNOOZE.  (well, and
maybe a bowl or two for good measure).  I had never experienced such
a thing (how many times have I left a party and showered and gone to
WORK?  Ug!  Talk about MOOD SWING) and found that "cracking out" with
my friends was almost as enjoyable as the rave itself!

Now the idea of going home and being ALONE after a party seems
unthinkable!

Live 105 is doing the same thing.  They play Chem. Bros. and I've heard
the Prodigy, too.  I don't know who they are exactly marketing too, but
obviously there is some kind of developing market.  I think it is just
going toget worse,too, because there *is* a burgeoning market.  I mean, look at
the clubs.  Most people aren't "ravers", but they sure are familiar with
all the big names and the music.  And the youth, that is where the big
money comes from.  So, although you see this sound as stale, there appears
to be a market in existence that is moving forward with great force.

     I LOVE IT WHEN PEOPLE ASK ME WHAT KIND OF DANCE THEY DO AT A RAVE, YE 
     KNOW HOW WE ALL DO THE BE-BOP OR THE SWING. PERHAPS WE SHOULD CONSIDER 
     TAKING UP SQUARE DANCING SO AS TO CONFORM WITH THE RIGID RULES OF 
     SOCIETY.  AND OF COURSE, WHEN A FAMOUS DJ SHOWS UP, WE NEED TO HAVE 
     SCREAMING 13 YEAR OLD GIRLS CHASING AFTER THEM...

I guess I bought the Chemical Brothers several months ago too, but they
still don't cease to move me. So I guess I'm still into it. I guess I
still like the Prodigy too. Does this mean I like what is yesterday's
news? "Oh nooooooo!!!" 
If - those mainstream people- start liking it, there's probably a reason 
why, more power to them, 'cause unless you're the superhero of cool you 
maybe were once one too. I mean, everyone starts somewhere. I sure had 
a lame-o beginning that is taboo in the "Land of the Truly Hip".
Sure you can bemoan the loss of underground culture, because somehow 
those in our modern society like to think of ourselves as individualists, 
when really what is true is quite the opposite.
"Are we relegated to the likes of grunge!?? Green Day?!?!! Oh god..."
Music can be a true communicator.
If our scene truly upholds particular ideals, then should we be 
separatist? If we yearn to be inclusive, if we yearn to love. Is that 
what we're about? 
So live by example and show what's up.

By the way. Do you really read Spin and listen to Live 105?


rebecca.

     Well DeepFog, my fave dance step:
     
     How often do I find myself in 'the trance'... which is that part where 
     I almost fall over because so much epic shit just blew through my 
     head.  This is usually after one of those soul cleansing builds that 
     just blows up and leaves you with almost nothing beatwise, except for 
     a real epic buzz, and the sense of opening your eyes to all you fellow 
     travelers (LOVE YOU).. Of course I immediately resume with the ass 
     shaking, arm swinging, leg twitching spasms some bravely call dancing 
     as soon as all centers report full functionality again.
     
     I would recommend telling those concerned parties:  I dance, and it 
     feels good.
     
     Oh... and scary would be:
     "Keoki-mania is sweeping the nation... 13 year old girls are fainting 
     at his very presence.  The new hot gift this Christmas is the 
     Kara-Keoki, a play along portable CD player that allows the user to 
     push one of four buttons (Wailing Diva, Doubled Up Kick, Billion Note 
     per second drum roll, and 303 Riff) along with specially made Keoki & 
     Friends CD's (sold separately).  It also comes with a custom paint 
     job, featuring pictures of the superstar DJ, and one in five come with 
     a rare collector's edition action figure, complete with fury scratchin 
     grip and a ozite carpeted lunch box that looks like a DJ coffin."
     
     Where do I get one?

Troy, I havn't seen the article, and I'm sure I would agree on all aspects,
but I will point out that yes while the Chemical Bros, is a worn out cd
now, they have helped create a lot of new london/uk  break beat dj's and
artists...... I was in london this summer and the new sound is not only goa
trance, drum & bass, and jungle (also old hat by now......) chemical
brothers are at the forefront of a new sound called london breakbeat......
it's related to the west coast breakbeat sound but has less 303 action and
more variety in the acid sound efx.

This is SO exactly it!  Every time I catch myself at a >>club<< thinking
"Ew, check out THEM...they like to THINK they can dance, but they don't
know the TRUE JOYS OF THE UNDERGROUND." I have to stop myself
and say "Ariel, these are people who are *enjoying dancing*.  To criticize
them in their enjoyment is to be hypocritical and just plain mean.  They
may not enjoy dancing the same way you do, or for the same reasons,
but at least they're dancing!"

Raving IS about the love of the music and the love of dance.  The
concern shouldn't be how >many< people are raving (the more the
merrier!) but that the ideals are kept pure.  PEACE LOVE RESPECT AND
UNITY.  Instead of condemning those who are more mainstream, how
about giving 'em a hug and showing them what it's all about?  Spread
love, don't be selfish with it! :)

 Sounds good! Who/what else is considered "London Breakbeat" ? ( Artists
and/or tune titles? )

 I guess I'll have to start buying Melody Maker and some other Brit
music mags again ...

Unfortunately i see the same thing happening, and it sort of saddens me.
While i am completely FOR spreading the "rave" culture and house music, i am
totally against commercialism.  Commercialism takes away from the GOAL and
brings people that may not be as enthused about expanding themselves and
creating a really positive vibe.

It also makes it too "profitable" and producers, promoters and musicians
will begin to do it for reasons that may not be to the benefit of the scene.

These r just my personal feelings, do as u will with them. PLUR!!

I propose that someone (could be me?) start putting together a mailing list
or something of the sort with the names of all those interested in sharing
their house with other people who want to get together after parties.  This
list would consist of all the people who are interested in coming and all
those interested in hosting.

Whaddaya think????

PLUR,

The after-party idea is really cool. 

Another cool idea which works well with Ausravers is a pre-rave
restaurant munch. Publicise it at least a few days before to get some
idea of numbers, book a restaurant, arrive, talk, eat.

This works well even if people are scattering to different parties
afterwards.

The restaurant needs to be cheap, able to handle large groups (the
Ausrave record is about 25), and have both veggie and non-veggie food.

Gosh, I have to disagree 100% with you here.

I find that every Orbital release is better than the one before.

Yes, the recent ones are less "dance" oriented than the ones before,
but so what?  Each release has new innovations, new "mind candy".

Be sure to get the 2-CD version of "In Sides", the "extra" CD has some
of the best tracks.  [I'm not sure whether there is a parallel LP
version to the 2-CD version.]

PS  I am inclined to agree that the recent Orb releases are not as
ground breaking as the earlier ones.


Be seeing you,

How can you tell someone who is "down with the underground" from those who
aren't "ravers?" Is it someone who doesn't wear the "right" clothing? They
wear a laminate or some other badge? I have to say that if you saw me at a
club, you'd probably call me an outsider, a tourist, whatever - I don't
dress all ravey... but I've been going to underground stuff for ages, since
the days of toontown and before (back in my day, we had to walk through 75
feet of snow, just to stand in line for a rave :) ). One of the things I
always liked about the 'rave' scene is that it drew a lot of different
kinds of people, and there was room for them all. I hated to see when it
got all commercial, when every flyer was huge with a zillion colors, and
cost more than the event itself. This big comercial wave died down, but
there's still lots of 'mainstream' interest... And there is still a
constant influx of new people into the scene. Is that getting "worse?" I
think the culture can only benefit from new people and ideas.

It's up to you to show the newcomers what the scene should be like. If
hardcore ravers treat newcomers with attitude because they're "just not
down with the scene," what kind of impression do you think those newcomers
will leave with?

You should look into details of what happened in the original "Summer
of Love" in the Haight in 1967.

Essentially what happened is that the more people who became involved,
the less it was about PLUR and raising consciousness, and the more it
was about mindless intoxication.   This is why the original community
broke up.

The state of mankind, for the forseeable future, is that only a
certain number of people are going to be able to understand OR are
going to WANT to understand, higher consciousness and PLUR.  The
conditioning just runs too deep, and many many people just don't have
the requisite reference points, and don't have the time and space in
their lives to acquire them, and don't see why they should want to.

So, it is best to expand it on a person by person basis, rather than
in any mass way.

Hey SFRavers! If you're itching for some pre-rave and post-rave
activities, why not get them both in one night? Every Monday night
before Mad, join Dianna Greer's wacky pre-Mad, post-weekend dinner.
Whether you go to fuel up before partying at Mad, or if you go to just
wind down after an intense party weekend, there's always fun
conversation and good food.

Dinner starts at 8:30, at varying locations (last Monday was Tai food,
yummy yummy). After dinner, we head to Mad (@ the Bahia Cabana on
Franklin and Market). Many of us are in the veggie/vegan end of the
eating spectrum, so all diets are considered.

See you then!

Steve

Hi All,

This last spring I was in europe and stumbled onto an EP by a group 
called Propellerheads.  Great stuff, and now I'm starting to hear it here 
in The States: in shoe commercials (yeah yeah, I know), have also heard 
several DJs spin them.  Wall of Sound is the label.

Anyone know anything more about Propellerheads?

Thanks

deeje

Excellent recommendations!!!! You can hardly go wrong with the Skint
label....I don't know if you have a turntable Larry, but I'd recommend
getting one. I don't think Skint has released any CD's? I've seen/
bought a lot of Skint records at Soundworks in SF and Solid Grooves
in SJ. Definitely try and pick up the recent? Headdrillerz 12" on
the Pussy Foot label...I bought it at Soundworks. I can't remember
the name of tracks but they're all SUPERB!!!!

Peace,
John

Hmmm, I am not sure who you are directing this to.  I don' think I 
ever condemned people who like mainstream music.  I was condemning
the mainstream music press for creating an artificial, synthetic, processed,
filtered, mass-market friendly version of our scene that the Music Industry
can use to make money.  I understand people like Mainstream Rave Music,
but I suspect that is only becuase they do not have access to more
underground music.  I didn't see any PLUR in the Spin article.  Only
big color pictures of nerdy guys and a boring article deviod of any
real description of a true subculture that is evolving worldwide.

I was so depressed about this and so certain that it was permanently gone 
that I didn't bother to write about H3, but here goes....

PLEASE READ:  I left a camera, a small, black, automatic Ricoh camera, in 
the chill space when they kicked everyone out.  If ANYONE found it, please 
let me know!  

LAST SEEN:  From what I gather, it was picked up in the chill space by a 
young man wearing long purple shorts and carrying a blue backpack.  He was 
hanging out with another guy that was wearing a Kelly green tank top.  The 
guy that picked it up showed to a young lady that was looking for her 
camera.  When security saw this, they suggested that he leave it with them 
so the owner could find it, but the guy didn't want to and put it back in 
his backpack.  Which suggests to me that he intended to keep it.

You don't want to hear my opinion of a person that does that sort of thing, 
especially at an event like H3.  I came to conclusion a while back that 
there are  ravers and there are partiers.  One has respect for others and 
for the venu, and the other doesn't.  Respectively.

Hi All,

Before anybody flames me for posting Non-rave-related stuff, let me state
right here that I ASKED if anybody was interested first, and I have received
(in 30 minutes) 10 requests for the update.

This update comes from MW-RAVES, and it originated at Ford Motor Company,
and it actually sounds like Lexus/Nexus is working hard to set things
straight...

Sender: mw-raves-owner@hyperreal.com

*** Resending note of 09/18/96 09:32                                            

Hi virtua-crew!  Here is an update on that PTrak database scare for ya          
compliments of FORD:                                                            

Recently, a chain letter has been flying about OV regarding the Lexis/          
Nexis "P-Trak" database.  The note warns that this publically accessible        
database contains sensitive info, and the reader is urged to contact            
Lexis/Nexis to remove themselves from the database.  THIS WARNING IS            
NO LONGER VALID.  PLEASE DO NOT FORWARD ANY MAIL ON THIS SUBJECT.               

In early June, 1996, Lexis/Nexis began marketing their P-Trak database.         
P-Trak is marketed to Attorneys, Law Enforcement and Police, and is a           
business-to-business service.  AT THAT TIME, the database did contain           
such items as an individual's social security number, and mother's              
maiden name.  Within weeks, due to public reaction, and concerns over           
potential for misuse, the sensitive information was removed from the            
database distributed via the P-Trak service.                                    

Calls to Lexis-Nexis (9/13/96, recorded information) reveal,                    
the info that "MAY" now be contained in the database includes:                  
The individual's name                                                           
The INDIVIDUAL'S MAIDEN NAME (not the mother's)                                 
Assumed names (aliases)                                                         
Month and year of birth                                                         
Current and two previous addresses                                              
Current phone number                                                            

Specifically mentioned as NOT included:                                         
Credit History or other financial data                                          

Not mentioned (and I assume not included)                                       
Social security number                                                          

There is apparently little cause for concern, since most of this                
information is obtainable through legitimate venues.  This information          
is of little use for fraudulent purposes.                                       

If you are still concerned, you can have yourself removed from P-Trax

up.

Rebecca,
I wrote the little blurb about Live 105 above.  I just wanted to thank you
for your commentary.  It was right on!!  I love the Prodigy, too, and the
Chemical Brothers, and, especially, Underworld.  I'd like to add a few more 
thoughts that have been running in my mind in relation to this topic.  
One special thing about raving that I love is the emphasis on the individual.
Everyone feels a part of a rave, like they are contributing by just being
part of the vibe.  The rock and roll world of superstars caters to the
few, the rich, the hip.  Superstardom is about the desire to be something
you're not, about worshiping an idol.  To me that is the contrary of
raving, where I feel just by being open and warm, I am a contributer.
Where no one is such a star that you can't talk to them.  Where the power
is in the hands of the many rather than the few.  Where you cast aside
everyday assumptions about yourself and others, and allow real room for
self-expression rather than conformity.  If raving were to lose that, I
for one would be sad.  

Oh yeah, and I do listen to Live 105 on occasion, and I'm pissed that they
tend to make one hit wonders out of respectable bands in search of
their "I'm so fucking alternative" attitude.  And they tend to co-opt
Indy bands (like Sebadoh) as being the "new" alternative.  Duh,
Sebadoh was the antithesis of that attitude for years.  But it's all about
money, so who knows what's gonna happen.

The great majority of you will have no idea what I am talking about,
please bear with me. 

I owe the community as a whole an apology, and Diana Greer one most of
all.  From my arrival on Friday morning at the Burning Man VW Camp,
until the moment I got out of Moonpups van Monday night in the City, I
demonstrated a wide variety of appalling behaviors.  I started out just
irritable and arrogant and finished the festival as a paranoid recluse,
talking trash about a good person.

Some people just wrote my behavior off as a bad tweaker trip.  I wish
that was true, then I could shrug my shoulders and say it wasnt really
my fault.  In good conscious, I neither can, nor will offer, an excuse
for my behavior.  That was a very ugly side of me you all saw.

Diana, I once again want to thank you for the many times in the past you
had shown faith in me. You were willing to work on our former
relationship through long periods of  abuse and neglect that no one
should have suffered.  Your love was real and I want you to know that I
understand and believe that.  I stupidly drove you away.  I hope that
one day you can forgive me for the mess I made of your life.

I said many outright lies and exaggerations about Diana to many people
that last night of Burning Man.  I harassed and frightened her, Jonathan
Logan, and some of you, too.   Im not even sure exactly who I talked to
in some cases.  It doesnt matter any more beyond this;  Diana D. Greer
is one hell of a good person and possessing of a very genuine nature. 
By initially welcoming me into VW Camp, she had once again shown faith
in me.  I repaid her faith by showing ever-increasing jealousy and
controlling behavior.  When she finally placed some distance between us,
I freaked out and wandered the camp bemoaning my self-inflicted wound. 
I spread lies and bullshit to any who would listen.

One of the most insidious things that I did to Diana while we a couple
was I cut her off from her own world.  You cant control a person who
has an independent life, and an isolated person is far less likely to
leave you, even if you are an asshole.  Since we split up,  Diana has
discovered the SFRaves community,  and has eagerly joined in as a
member of the extended family of ravers.  This family and new sense of
community is very precious to Diana. I know that my horrible
behavior at Burning Man has shamed her deeply, and made her reticent
around you, her friends.  Whatever else happens, please support your
friend Diana on this issue.  I will not make the same mistake again.  My
actions and words were inexcusable.  Diana was blameless and undeserving
of the embarrassment I caused her.  My apologies to all.

Costco :) - I just developed my 24 exposures - double prints approx. $5.00 (4x6)
I think 5x7s are (double prints again) around $7.00.  This is Costco
developing way (which I don't find bad at all).  There is KOdak super
special whatever, but it is almost doubled in price.

Depends how much you care for quality.  I think Costco quality is pretty
good (better than Walgreens), but I am just a regular customer.

Please let me know if you would want to do this and if you don't have a
Costco card and if you give me $$$ I could take it to Costco by my work and
pick it up for you.

P.S.  is Erik still living at your place?  If not can you please send me

S!

I knew there was something missing in my life! SDream's review of H3!!! 
I always look forward to your reviews - they are the best - I LOVE to hear
what those hamstas have been up to! How can you not write a review of
H3 - best party of the summer?

Just remember what was going through your head BEFORE the unfortunate
camera incident - maybe it'll cheer you up! I lost stuff there and
magically it returned to me.

And ofcource, the real tragedy comes from when party promoters begin to

There seems to be some interest in actually setting up a "mailing" list for
those who want to get together and "chill" after partying.  So, i'm going to
get it set up (D. Lowe, e-mail me so we can talk).  Once again, all those
interested, post on sfrave and i'll get your info. and we'll see what
happens.  A couple of people have already offered to host (graciously).

Someone, else brought up a really good idea of setting up a "pre-party"
dinner of sorts, which i also think would be cool.  I don't want this to get
too complicated, but am definitely down with supporting both of these ideas.
Let's all get together and see what we can do. :)

PLUR,

	The 2nd CD to In-Sides was released as "Times Fly" on Internal.  Silly 
me, I bought it then got another copy on In-Sides.  (Actually I think there is 
one track difference; I can't remember what or on which right now).

Fortunately, there aren't a lot of DJ Sho's out there...
That's one perk of having an uncommon first name. Of course,

there is an extended version of the box on the second disk. the other four
songs are the same as the times fly single. i have both, but the extended
version of the box was worth the $15 i paid for the entire orbital album.
man, that remix is SO good! =)

I think that's way too much organizing ... I mean, what if don't want
everyone to know if I'm inviting some people over?  Or someone wants to
keep their chill session more discrete?  Or someone changes their mind and
decides it's not the right day to have people in their house?

I think it might be easier if the specific "host" just put the word out
verbally to people at a party, and leave it more freeform .... that's
worked when I've chilled at people's houses in the past...

Harmony: 

You like Stella Luna?  I certainly do, they're what got me
to go to Harmony (I don't do many raves these days).  I was
listening to the most recent Mandible Chatter CD, "Grace"
and it occurred to me that they were really going in the
direction that Stella Luna is going in now.  One of the two
main people in Mandible Chatter is also in Stella Luna.
Anyway, Mandible Chatter is on the Manifold label, if you
care:

   http://www.vdospk.com/manifold/

And come to think of it, one of the other guys I know in
Stella Luna did some drumming on the "Indestructible Beat of
Palo Alto" CD, though I still haven't heard that one yet. 

I have to say that overall I was a little disappointed with
Harmony, outside of Stella Luna... I mean we go check out
the main dance area, and it's nothing but this soulless hard
core that I would rant about a lot except that there's not a
lot of point in arguing about musical taste.  We head back
to the chill space, and the dance music there is a bit
better... except that there's no place to chill really, it's
a second dance area (yeah, I know, we should've brought a
tent).  So we split fairly early (like 1 AM).  

These days I guess I'm more interested in improvised music,
(though it is a shame that no one ever gets up and dances at
events like that... except when the Arkestra is in town, of
course). 

Anyway, let me know if Weird Blinking Lights are playing
somewhere.

I think I'd hafta agree with Leslie on this one.  One thing I've learned
from raving (and a lot of other people seem to be this way) is to just go
with the flow on almost everything involving raving, which of course
involves where I end up.  I've never really planned ahead of time to be
somewhere after a rave, but I almost always end up there anyway!  Very nice
to just flow right along with the evening, into the morning, and into
somebody's cool house to hang. :)  Unless I specifically don't want to go
somewhere after, I almost always do end up somewhere, usually at BK Jon's or
Wayne & Marcy's.

My Seattle friends always go and chill together after a party ... of
course, I, being the hedonist that I am, often oft for my spacious cushy
bed and down comfortor, jazz cds, etc.

But I do second the notion of Dianna Greer's place ... esp since it's just
blocks from mine!  ; )

P.S.  Whoever's using the terms "crack out" to describe "chill out" ... can
we erase that one from our vocabulary and come up with something a little
less horrifying to describe something that should be so warm and fuzzy?
Yikes, that's really a scary term to me, thanks but no thanks, I don't want
to crack on, crack up or crack out!

When i lived in a concrete building, my roommate and i used to round up
people we liked after raves and take them home to chill while he (my
roomie) spun for us.  It got to be such a bad she-told-two-friends-and-
they-told-two-friends situation that one morning we ended up with SIXTY
people in a small two-bedroom apt, all smoking speed and various other
stuff.  My roommate had a guy passed out on his bed for hours barely
breathing while his pals hotboxed the room.  There were maybe ten people
there that we actually KNEW we invited. 

So instead of not having the sessions, cos we LOVED them, we printed 
tickets!  One ticket meant one person, and that was IT.  if you didn't 
have one, too bad.  The tix were of course free, and we just gave em to 
folks throughout the night, so the people were almost never the same 
twice.  It was fun.

my point is ... it's HARD to have just a house or whatever somewhere that 
is the "accepted" chill house, unless the people who are running it don't 
actually LIVE in it.  Do you want people you don't know well just knowing 
where you live?  Even if you try to keep it to JUST sfravers, word does 
get out ... and also, sometimes, after a particularly Exciting gathering, 
i know i'd rather have the house to GO to rather than be the person in 
charge of it ... maybe rotating houses?  :)

You know, there are many people in the country today who, through no

people overcome their sanity.

        I'm sick of our mail server.  Every two days or so it will stop
receiving mail correctly.  Consequently, I have nothing to read at the
moment.  So instead, I thought I'd just send out something, especially since
I haven't been posting very frequently in the last few months.  Most of that
has been due to the fact that I was far away in the Evil Southland, the rest
just due to a not-so-rare disease I have called Slack.

<paragraph for Mr. Moonpup>
        First of all, can someone reply to me if this message shows up on
the list?  I haven't seen my messages showing up recently, and I was
wondering if they're actually getting there.

<'nuther paragraph for Moonpup>
        So what have I been up to, some of you may be wondering?  Well, in
LA I was sort of destressing myself, and, more than anything, proving to
myself that I shouldn't be a slave to my job.  I kind of felt like I had to
be here over the summer for no real reason, and needed to show myself that
if I wasn't going to be happy then it wasn't worth it.  So.  I did a lot of
temp work, which I wasn't real fond of, but it paid the bills.  And I played
a lot of frisbee golf.  And I hung out with some of my bestest friends.  In
short, I relaxed hard core (if such a thing is possible).

<you get the idea>
        Then I came back.  I started work, started class, started flamenco
dance (yes, really), etc.  Then, after the first two days of class and labor
day weekend, I decided I needed a break.  Hey, what can I say, I'm a senior.
It's my right.  Actually, I just wandered around California for a week to
see my favorite band on the planet, His Name Is Alive, play about five or
six shows.  I had to give up BM to do it, but it was worth it.  A lot of
experiences strike you as something you had a good time doing, but a very
few experiences strike you as something that, in addition, you _needed_ to
do.  Well, this was one of them.  It clarified a lot for me.  And I got to
hear a hell of a lot of good music in the process.

        As usual, I seem to have gone off on long tangents.  But I'm good at
it.  One last thing, though.  I'm considering trying to requisition funds
from the city of SF to build a frisbee golf course in GG park.  However,
after speaking to my father (who's a city planner), he said the way to have
the best chance at getting the money is to supply the labor yourself.  So I
was wondering, just tentatively, if anyone would be interested in getting
together some weekend and helping me set it up.  Please let me know if you
would, because that would greatly increase the chances of this becoming a
reality.

That's all.

Jake

I have very decisive views about the use of chemicals to expand spiritual
awareness. So,I have waited until I had quality time to put into this
response, and, hopefully, there are individuals who can benefit from my
views. I welcome response to this, as I am not closed of to other points of
view.

_I DO believe that drugs can open you physical body to the awareness of the
greater universe.

_I also believe that you do NOT walk away with the benefits of that awareness
after you have finished your trip.

I explained my feelings to a friend by the use of this analogy; It's as if
you had an ailment (longing for spiritual growth) and you went to the
drugstore (the universe) for a remedy (energy as information). The use of
drugs opens you up to more than just the remedy that will help your ailment,
you're also going to get the remedy for ailments you don't have. It's like
taking every remedy a drug store has to offer when all you have is
indigestion. This influx of information in your conscious awareness can cause
serious confusion and jack with your personal energy field (aura, if you
will). It takes a soul who's worked VERY HARD in their past lives to handle
such a wide frequency of energies. I wouldn't suggest that anyone who isn't
absoultely sure about their place in the universe try to expand themselves
chemically.

Don't get me wrong, drugs are great. They've opened up my level of compassion
greatly by helping me to connect more deeply on this physical plane. I've
used them in the past, and i will probably use them again. But, as far as
spiritual growth is concerned, I'll take good old fashioned meditation any
time!

Anyone wishing to expand on these issues is welcome to e-mail me directly. I
look forward to hearing what everyone thinks!
Remember, it isn't where you are on the path to awareness that counts- It's
the fact that you're there in the first place.

love for everybeing

     To the only people who might understand...
     ______________________________________________________________________
     
     I used to live in a bizarrely laid out portion of Irvine California 
     called Turtle Rock.  Turtle Rock is fairly unimpressive, except for 
     the fact that it was designed in a manner that very few houses would 
     experience through traffic.  This was done mostly through master 
     planning the zoning, road layout etc.
     
     I went to school at the bottom of the hill, and I lived at the top.  
     The main road (Turtle Rock drive), arced, so it was very inefficient 
     to follow that road up the hill.  But it was the only sure way.
     
     Sometimes, when I got out of a class early, I would choose a different 
     path.  Sometimes I found a another street that I could cut through.  
     Sometimes I found a dead end.  Sometimes I found a weird house, or a 
     fence with some strange feature on it, or a greenbelt that shot 
     between houses.  I met this with the fascination and wonder, and the 
     drudgery of having finished another day of school.  But it was better 
     than taking that same lame road home.
     
     Sometimes, I'd get a little lost, and worry my mom (you haven't been 
     yelled at till an Argentine woman with a thyroid condition after 
     working a double shift yells at you).  Sometimes I'd remember a 
     shortcut, get screwed by my awful memory, and have to resort to the 
     main drag again.  But eventually, I found a better way home.
     
     I think my point is, there are a lot of wrong turns, but if I didn't 
     take them, I would have taken the only road I knew again (the road 
     everybody else took, the road my parents used, the road that the plan 
     called for).  This road I knew was somehow wrong, or at least for me.  
     In life, I think we should all take the time to find some of those 
     wrong turns.  There are many crappy decisions you can make, I've been 
     making a lot lately.  I've had trouble spending real time with the 
     only woman I care for right now (intimately that is).  I've moved in 
     with some pretty crude jerks... 
     
     Raving is beautiful because it doesn't ask us to forego the road we 
     know is our life.  It doesn't ask us to burn baby burn, or Turn on 
     tune in and drop anything.  It's a different way, and you can visit or 
     leave anytime.  Drugs are a different way.  Investigating spirituality 
     is a different way.  If we take care, we can go down those paths.  
     Some of them are dead ends.  If you see the end coming up, don't freak 
     out... just remember how you got there.
     
     To those of you that I've met, and those I haven't...
     
     Remember where the main drag is.  Sometimes it's a good way to go for 
     a while.
     
     Walk slowly and look about.  There is so much there.
     
     Don't risk getting lost if you don't have the time.  Make the time 
     when you can.
     
     Life is really amazing, and there's so many things you can do with it.
     
     SomEthing this weekend opened a door I couldn't imagine opening any 
     other way.  I found out that love can stop and start people.  I looked 
     at people and they stopped, and turned and smiled.  I said I know you, 
     and she said she knew me too.  I will probably never see her again, 
     but for a second I felt so amazed and so in awe...  I hugged him and I 
     knew how he felt, and that was everything.  You smiled at me.  I 
     forgot to dance, and the room stopped.  In the calm, we were together. 
      And together we met the next wave.
     
     .  .  .  .  o  o  o  o  O  O  O  O 
     
     We were so close to being in love with each other.
     ______________________________________________________________________
     
     I had to work so hard last night just to remember how I felt at that 
     moment last weekend.
     
     I want to try again.
     
     See you this weekend.
     
     Love,
     AndyW

2 things caught my eye for this weekend (though admittedly I will
probably not do anything):

Gateway Systems is having a Campout to celebrate the Autumn Equinox.
You know it will be awesome.  I don't have the voicemail #...

Space Children is doing their thing on Saturday as well.  The headliner is
Juan Atkins -> $12 before midnight.  415-273-1622... and partial proceeds
going to Omar.

  Of course, there's more happening... but those are the ones that look
most promising to me...

That's Ayne Rand, as in Aynus!

Word up bruddah! I'm real sick of those Aynus-Rand-diahrrea-spoutin',
Rush-Listening (the band, not the oafish right winger) doofii! (that's
plural form of "doofus", latin for roman republican who porks sheep
while sporting velcro gloves). Yep. Burnins' not good 'enuf for 'em.
They ought to chop 'em in to little tiny pieces and serve up all those
diced soft white underbellies to all those voguein' vegans as refried
free range tofu. Yep. That's what I say! :-)

Personally, I like to retitle Aynus Rand's books w/ shit like   
Atlas Bugged! The Will to Ill! 
Aynus is nothing but a nazi in sheep's clothing. Forget the velcro gloves....

Hi All,
     
This last spring I was in europe and stumbled onto an EP by a group 
called Propellerheads.  Great stuff, and now I'm starting to hear it here 
in The States: in shoe commercials (yeah yeah, I know), have also heard 
several DJs spin them.  Wall of Sound is the label.
     
Anyone know anything more about Propellerheads?
     
Thanks

Ok, I'm sorry to take up bandwidth with this (it is totally non-rave

Are there ANY gruvers in the South Peninsula area (Palo Alto, Menlo
Park, Redwood City, etc etc etc) who have a spare room/basement/
closet/garage?  I am deeply sick of commuting to work from Hayward
and I need a little place to live.  I am able to spend up to $550 a
month, so if ANYONE knows of ANYWHERE that a room or space is
available, let me know!

So many people have emailed me asking what FringeWare is all about, I 
thought I'd respond list-wide.  Bottom line:  FringeWare ROCKS.

My opinion is that FringeWare is the watershed where intelligent fringe 
culture accumulates for cross-pollination and mass distribution.  It is 
the group of people that took over where Mondo 2000 and bOING bOING left 
off, in terms of wicked clever thought and culture, memes and gadgets.  

They describe themselves as follows:

"FringeWare Inc., is a Texas corporation operating in the city of Austin 
(Dun & Bradstreet #87-622-8982), as a guerrilla media collective. Founded 
in 1992, our activities comprise several lines of business, including: 

       a retail store and mail order catalog 
       a printed magazine, Fringe Ware Review 
       an email list 
       design and engineering consulting services 
       helping to sponsor fringe events 
       a staff of trained professionals"

Let's just say that FringeWare is home to syncronistic convergences of 
chaotic attractors.  It was the original home of the Schwa meme as well.

happy mutating!

Subject: Update on "chilling out"
Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

There has been a mostly positive response to the idea of having chill out
sessions after parties.  There, however, were a couple of postings that had
some concerns with it being too organized or what not.....i have no
solutions for these...sorry  :(

There has, however, been a quite a few people (so far) who are interested in
attending and/or hosting on of these gatherings.  That's all i think i would
like out of this, for it to be a gathering, not an event, and not someplace
where a 100 random people come over abuse various drugs and also abuse the
space/privacy of the host.  I want this be all inclusive, but not get out of
hand, after all we MUST respect the space and lives of those who have
offered to host.  There shouldn't be "one" chillout house, but rather have
it be a rotating thing...it doesn't even have to be every weekend..if
someone feels like hosting and there are people interested in going, then it
will happen.

Part of the reson i think this will be a good idea is that it will allow us
(sfravers&friends) to get together and know each other, even if we didn't
all go to the same party.  I'm sure there have been several mornings when
all of us have not been ready to go home yet and be alone, or have to drive
1-1.5 hours home (like i often have to) or even those that are with 1-2
other people, but still have no place to go hang out, relax and revitalize
themselves.  I think it would be a beneficial and nice communal thing to do. :)

Finally, there is that problem of too many people inviting other
people...etc. etc.  Like i said i don't want to this to be a "clique" thing
and not introduce new people into it, but i also don't want this to get out
of hand (who knows if it actually would, but better safe than sorry). So, i
think maybe the ideas of tickets, with a 1-2 extra ones given out to each
group of people, or maybe some sort of RSVP thing would be good.  That way
the host knows if they can handle the 10-15 or 30-40 that are interested.

Sorry this got so verbose.  Please give me yout feedback.  For all those of
u that wrote in saying u were interested, i have written down your addresses
and hopefully we can get something togethter.

:P
Dan

A few ideas on this...

The morning after a rave is a great time, but usually people are all
in various states of "awakeness"... ie, some people will be up for
much of the morning, and some people will be ready to completley crash.
When I had people over at my place for post-party chills, sometimes I felt
wierd if I needed to crash, and everyone else was still up at my place.

One idea is to have a sunday-afternoon get together.  That was everyone
can get a few hours of sleep and catch a shower.  Personally, when
I get back from a party I want to take a short break from partying,
and maybe just chill by myself (or with my very close friends).  But
come Sunday afternoon is when I start feeling like I would like to be
partying with my friends again.  Getting together for the Simpsons or
a video is great post-party fun.

This may be especially relevent now that summer is drawing to a close
and Sunsets will be fewer and farther between.

Personally, I really like pre-party get-togethers, becuase everyone is
all excited and bright and pumped up to go party.

just some thoughts to throw into the mix...

	how about this: shawna and leslie had good ideas. go with the
flow. but the fact that there's a predetermined chill-house doesn't negate
the possibility of spontaneity. remember, this isn't mandatory. if some
people want to organize this and plan to meet at someone's place,
wonderful. if others just want to hang out with a small, specific group of
friends, wonderful. i'm sure we can all handle our own plans. just this
way, we have more alternatives.

hi- September has been both a good and bad month. good because the
jungle market has stepped up quality wise within the past couple weeks.
Bad because we still have to pay $10 bucks for each record. Hope this is
useful:)

Fugees or NOT- Promo

Remix of 'Ready or Not' by the blockbuster rap trio. Starts off mellow
with that "hunt for red october' type submarine keyboard which instantly
makes me want to run away and sulk in a corner or something. Solid
vocals samples. One cheesy part in the middle where there's a cuss word
and they bleep it out...weird...

Origin Unkown- Valley of the Shadows- RAM

Remix of a classic. Original mix is sped up to fit todays jungle tempos.
'96 mix is nice and sparse. Good to see they didn't try to do too much.
If it ain't broke...Anyways, this is a beautiful song built on the
contrast between this nice bell progression and the dark bass lines.
Really moody.

Paradox- Renegade Hardware Promo

Excellent trancy lucid drum'n bass with strange wha-wha'd echoing vocal
samples. Busy drums never get too overwhelming and the breaks are really
pretty.

Barcode- New Dance/Soundz Of- Formation Records

A-side is a pretty jump-up track. Starts off with a classical intro
(some well known 18th century piece) with bomb blasts and beats. Pretty
funky.After a Prince sample the meat of the song kicks in and let me
tell ya...it's amazing. Almost tech-steppy but will really get the crowd 
jumping. b-side is another solid steppy track.

Penny Black#6- promo

yeah..I've got no info in this track. PB has been on eof those labels to 
watch out for as of late, and they really come through this week. Two 
sides of nice melodic thick jungle which will have the crowd dancing 
through the pristine breaks to the wicked drums. hype!

P.F.M.- For all of us/ The Mystics- Good Looking Records

Though both these tracks have been out for ages on dubplate, we finally 
get a chance to hear what all the fuss was about. Pretty standard PFM 
format...moody strings in the beginning followed by energetic drums and a 
breakdown which reminds me of the summer of '92. Flip side is a bit more 
sophisticated and just as atmospheric. nice one.

Flynn and Flora- Bass Speaker/ Revolution- Independent Dealers

2 solid but different trax. Bass Speaker gets a remix by Krust who goes a 
bit overboard. I'm not so used to him doing agro hardstep, but it works. 
Revolution is a really solid track with some cool samples about the 
construction of a revolt. Melodic and uplifting, but never cheesy, it 
would work well at the beginning of a set.

Aphrodite- Recuts II- Aprhodite

3 tracker. One sample-heavy stepper. One weird light roller with weird 
metal sounds in it. One ambient 'deep forest' type mix. Good stuff. but 
nothing new.

Adam F- Metropolis- Metalheadz

This has got to be one of the most hyped tracks in recent weeks. It 
delivers. Eerie strings and swooshing noises fill up half of the track 
until the breakdown is built and then demolished by massive cutting bass 
hits. Not for the weak of heart.

DJ Die- Reincarnations/Stoned Groove- Full Cylcle

Sure, his name sort of threw me off at first, but after purchasing a few 
choons of his, he's one of my favorites. Sparse minimal DEEP grooves 
perfect for the armchair or the dancefloor. Sountrack music for life.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

if anyone wants to hear some jungle, there's going to be an entire room 
of it at Buggin Out featuring Josh Swissman (from back east) and tons of 
local talent. 

-peace-

Hmm... A lot of choices this weekend. Personally, I'm going
to go see Claude Young, who has been and continues to be one
of the most influential DJs in the detroit scene (+england
+australia?).  Watching Claude work two records together to
come up with something new and interesting is nothing short
of inspirational.

The other parties sound good as well. Wow... So many choices
this weekend!

I called the Gateway vmail (415-536-9453), but there was no mention of
this. Anyone have any details? I'm always up for a good Gateway night :)

No, not _the_ DJ Headphone, silly!  =)

I was wondering if anyone had anything to say about moderately priced DJ
headphones?

Stear me in the right direction, oh knowledgable ones...

This makes sense.  Those of you that want to organize, organize away!  That
just gives us free-floaters more options when it comes time to decide where
to float to after the party! :)

Yeah!  What's the deal on this one?  I had to miss the last one alas, and
I'd probably end up missing this one too, but details are still good.

I really like the Sony MDR-V600 head phones.  They're very comfy, sound 
great, plenty of bass response, and they're Light.  

I got em for about $100 and Circuit City.

When I am playing out I plan to use the name Wayne. Damn, what a concept.
It helps that there's only one Wayne in rave land as far as I know. If
there's another, then WayneCo?

Vince made some very cool STP logo style buttons that saw SFR on them.
There were around 200 of them. I got half and have been seling them for a
monimum $1 which 100% of proceeds (no, not after we make back the money
Vince spent, rather ALL the $$$) will be donated to Hyperreal!

If any of you want them, please drop me a line or find me at the next party
-- these are limited editions -- when they're gone, they're gone, so act
fast!

I have about 50 left right now...

I have MDR V-600's... I got them at Audio Images for around $85 (on Oak
Grove, near 6th and Bryant)... the generation of DJ's before us used
MDR-V6's, which were a little more minimal than V600's... both are good...

If you want to spend more, try the Sony 7506's... they are the "pro"
version of V600s.

Also, Sennheiser make good headphones but I don't think they are very
suitable for "rave" environments... may be too fragile.

Cut the wax, baby!

Damn, once again you post something funny enough to reply to.... you are
masterful in poking fun at DJ culture.

Keep it up!

Coming next: the "(unlicensed) Keoki picture acid blotter" and 'likeness of
Keoki' GHB dispenser scandal!

It's not a Gateway campout as far as I know.

415-853-6842 is the info like

This will happen in the Sierras -- 3.5 hours from Bay Area on the shores of
a lake.

Friday Sep 20 camping only and Sep 21, 22 camping + DJ's.

call Thursday (tonite) for directions and details.

As far as I can tell, the 7506 is exactly the same as the
older V6, except that
	(a) the stripe is blue instead of red
	(b) the connector has a goldish color instead of
		being a silverish color
	(c) they cost about $40 more
	(d) you can still get them

I prefer the 7506 (and the V6, if you can still find it)
over the V600, but they do tend to fall apart. I find I need
to replace mine every year or so, with admittedly heavy
use. After this time, the pads fall apart (but can be
replaced), and the drivers start to go. 

Their main advantage is that you can hear them in even the
worst monitoring environments. They have good sound
isolation, bright highs, and are incredibly loud, which is
important when you find yourself faced with a mixer with an
inadequate headphone amp. I also find their shape to be 
comfortable in almost any position, unlike some other
headphones, which can be too bulky or too rigid.

I'll 2nd that - I've used V6's and 7506's for a few years, and swear by
them, but they do fail fairly frequently. I just bought my third pair after
one channel failed on both the 1st and 2nd pairs, which I then cannibalized
to make a whole pair, which then blew out. Other than reliability they're
great. They were something like $109 at Leo's. The V600's have larger
earcups and are bit bit bulkier.

One thing you should check out w/ the sony's: 

The models that say "studio monitor" reproduce the frequencies exactly as
they are given.

The models that dont ususally have a higher bass response. 

It is all a matter of opinion as far as which you prefer.

Fry's has the Sony v6 headphones!  They are $75.  I got mine about 3 months
ago.  So I don't know why people are having a hard time finding these.

The Home Base warehouse costs $10,000 + 3-5% of gross ticket sales to rent.
Security is another ~$7500 (Oakland PD offduty officers)

Sound would cost NO MORE than $5000.

Lighting would cost NO MORE than $5000.

They probably got a bunch of kids to "crew" for free.

FEEL GOOD ENTERTAINMENT is probably named that becuase that's how they feel
when they're counting all their $20's.

But then, what exactly would you expect from the people that bring you COOL
WORLD?

Privacy storm shows the best and worst of the 'Net

The flap over a new service from Lexis-Nexis is probably 
misguided, but raises interesting questions about privacy and 
the power of online communication

by Michael Brush

An online brouhaha that broke out this week over alleged 
privacy breaches caused by a new Lexis-Nexis product has put 
both the best and worst of the 'Net community in high 
profile.

The Dayton, Ohio-based online database company has been 
swamped with phone calls and faxes this week because of a 
flurry of e-mails and news-group postings warning readers of 
the allegedly dire consequences of its new product called P-
TRAK. Many of the warnings falsely claim that P-TRAK provides 
a wide range of potentially sensitive personal information 
ranging from social security numbers to medical and credit 
histories.

On the bright side, the controversy shows the huge power of 
the 'Net when used by public-spirited advocates to mobilize a 
response to a perceived danger -- in this case, a threat to 
privacy. On the dark side, the fact that many of the 
allegations in the electronic correspondence are plain wrong 
shows how easy it is to spread misinformation and, 
potentially, raise what could amount to an online lynch mob.

At issue is a product launched last June which provides 
Nexis-Lexis clients with basic public information about 
anyone in a 300 million-name database. The information 
available is culled from credit bureau records. It is limited 
to your name, your maiden name or alias (if any), your 
current and two most recent past addresses, the month and 
year of your birth, and your phone number -- though not all 
of that information is available on every person.

For nine days after the product was released last June 2, P-
TRAK also included your social security number. But the SSNs 
were pulled on June 11 because of complaints, says Lexis-
Nexis spokesman Steve Edwards. If you already <em>know</em> 
someone's social security number, though, you can search for 
him or her using that number.

P-TRAK is meant to help attorneys track down witnesses, heirs 
or parents who have stopped paying child support, says 
Edwards.

While the scope of P-TRAK is relatively limited compared to, 
say, credit reports, which carry news of your payment 
history, bankruptcies and other such sensitive material, it 
nonetheless sparked the ire of many 'Net users.

For example, one posting that was later widely circulated 
this week claimed that your social security number, "mother's 
maiden name, birth date and other personal information are 
now available to anyone with a credit card." It postulated 
that the information could allow someone to commit credit 
card fraud or use your identity.

The truth is somewhat tamer. The SSN and mother's maiden name 
are not included, for example, and  the database is available 
only to clients like law firms and news organizations that 
can afford Lexis-Nexis's relatively hefty fees.

Furthermore, Money Daily's spot check shows that the 
information available is spotty at best. A search of P-TRAK 
run on our behalf by the Time Inc. Research Center turned up 
the right addresses but no phone or birth date for this 
author. It got the addresses and birth year correct for Money 
Daily editor Kevin McKean, but had an obsolete phone number. 
And when confronted with relatively more common names of two 
other Money Online staffers -- tech director Wilson Smith and 
reporter Joseph "Tripp" Reynolds -- turned up dozens of 
people, none of whom proved to be the correct ones.

Those limitations notwithstanding, the roar on the 'Net was 
heard at Lexis-Nexis headquarters. "We have been deluged with 
people calling, writing and faxing," says Edwards. "People 
are asking us: 'Why are you putting my medical records, my 
mother's maiden name, and my credit card history out there?' 
This has been testing the limits of our customer service."

In response, Lexis-Nexis posted a statement on its home 
page</a> to correct false information about the product and 
also a form you can use to remove your name from the list, 
something the company says people could have done all along 
by calling. By next Monday, Edwards says the firm will also 
have an 800 number that callers can use. People who phone the 
company's current 800 number are told to fax name-removal 
requests to 513-865-1930.

The company has stopped short of posting responses in news 
groups or bulletin boards, though. "There are different 
schools of thought on that," says Edwards. "One says that you 
should never respond to news groups from a company standpoint 
because that increases the amount of flaming. But at this 
point, I don't know how much worse it could get."

In the company's place, other news group participants have 
stepped in to set the record straight. "I think you owe a 
post to correct this error," one such correspondent scolded 
in a reply that pointed out several errors in the message 
quoted above.

Ironically, the information available in P-TRAK is mild 
compared to what is available elsewhere in the vast Lexis-
Nexis database.

A related product, called P-FIND, for example, offers 
additional household information like the appraised value of 
a home in many states and the number of dependents (both of 
which are public information). The main Nexis database digs 
up information from news stories -- often from local papers 
- -- published around the world and in several different 
languages. Many of those stories, of course, contain 
information of arrests and charges that may later prove 
groundless, as well as a volume of personal information about 
the people cited in the articles. And the legal Lexis service 
contains not only details from civil and criminal court cases 
around the nation, but also other potentially sensitive 
information, such as tax liens and judgments against 
individuals.

Before you get your hackles up over invasion of privacy, 
though, consider that all of the above is public information 
- -- and, of course, much of it is potentially more sensitive 
than your previous address.

I've seen the MDR-V6's for as low as $60.00 (that's how much i've paid
for mine). A good place to shop for cheap gear is J&R Music World in
NYC. They got a 1-800 number, call 1-800-555-1212 (1-800's free 411) to
get their actual number. Good thing about shopping there is you don't
have to pay the 8.25% state sales tax (actually, you're supposed to,
but nobody does). Incidentally, they have very good prices on the
Pioneer CDJ-500mkII and M-500 mixer; I got mine there and it's awesome!

One question regarding playing in loud environments. I find that it's a
lot harder to pick out sounds on the headphones than it is on a
loudspeaker, esp. for beatmatching. Beatmatching really sparse tracks
is really easy, but beatmatching more complicated music (e.g. Banco de
Gaia into Loop Guru) can sound ok on the 'phones, but ends up sounding
like a mild trainwreck on the speakers. I've found I can actually do a
better job beatmatching more complex material if i use a small set of
monitor speakers running out of the headphone monitor instead of using
headphones. But I know that's cheating and doesn't do the trick...

How do you solve the problem? For example, you can "simplify" an overly
complex track by cutting down the bass on the headphone monitor
(monitor eq) so you can just beatmatch the hi-hats, but a lot of times,
you gotta get the bass in synch too, and that's where headphones fail.

I'm bored mixing simple sparse stuff into simple sparse stuff (e.g.
house music or really simple and repetitive acid squonqs). I hear good
DJ's mixing more complicated stuff successfully. How do they do that?
On headphones at least, I find it a lot harder to pick apart the music
than on speakers. Why is that, and how do i solve that?

PS: i use MDR-V6's. are my ears shot? Am I using the wrong headphones?

>   From the people who brought you Beltane and Summer Solstice we bring you

	That's funny, I didn't know any people could bring you Beltane or
the Summer Solstice. Granted we people put some silly name on a few days
of the year and have since chosen to use those to recongize that these
years pass around us and we gather for whatever reasons each of us has,
(and each of us has our own reasons, some are the same as others, but each
of us has our own reason for driving some awful long distance into the
middle of no where, some of us hauling gear, some of us hauling food, some
of us only hauling themselves and their energy) to gather and spend time
in a place where there is no one to take care of us except ourselves...

	Anyway, I don't think any of the people hauling gear out to the
site really agree with such termology even if sounds odd or funny just
because it is against the values that we came together to gather around
when it first started. It is not one group of people's party, and it is
not "put on by a group of people", simply because the people who started
the party are long dead and we are just people who have chosen to come
together on those same dates. Why do people come out to full moon parties
(or why did they use to before they were the shit and everyone and their
mother came out leaving beaches trashed and energy faltering)? Everyone 
has their own reasons. Enough rambling now... Just for everyone that 
comes, I do hope that each of you will help me carry a speaker up the 
hill if I need help doing it, because in one sense, that is what these 
parties are about...

this one's for plex

from extensive research and reading that i've done on my own, it seems that
integration of the mind, body, and higher-self planes within your being is
the key to attaining TRUE higher awareness. i feel that drugs may be able to
bring two of these planes together,creating an opening of awareness that you
would be able to walk away with and can be very good for a soul.(it seems
that mind/higher-self seems to be the one with most impact on one's psyche)
 but, i also believe that there is a "spiritual agenda". that there is an
order to the universe that should be followed. by opening to lessons that you
may not be ready for, i feel that could affect one's karma in a distorting
way. putting the horse before the cart, in a way. 

the bottom line is- we'll get there, let's not be in a hurry and enjoy the
journey. if you think drugs can truly help you to get more out of your
experience here on earth, do them. but, also, be responsible with your soul.

seeking compassion

although i never achieved such states through meditation or other means,
experiences with certain drugs still felt like a homecoming to me. the
first time i experienced a psychedelic trip, i felt, quite intensely, like
"i've been waiting all my life for this drug!"... it put me in touch with
many feelings, philosophies, and memories which were definitely already
inside of me but which i hadn't been in contact with recently if ever.

and as far as E... the first (and especially 2nd) time i ravEd, i really
felt like i had come home, found a long-lost family, etc. the E itself was
not the home i found, but rather the rave scene itself... but the E
certainly helped make very emotionally clear what i'd been missing.

i really believe that drugs like this can help you get in better touch with
yourself, and that (even if you never take the drugs again) you _can_ take
something of what you learn with you into the rest of your life... but only
if you try to.

love,

brian

Hey SFRavers! If you're looking for something cool to do on Sunday,
then head down to San Jose for a free afternoon party. It starts
around 11am or noon in downtown San Jose.

Directions from SF: take 280 south to the Guadelupe pkwy (same as hwy
87) and exit south. Take the San Carlos exit off of 87. From there,
look for a big purple building; this will be the Children's Discovery
Museum, and the party is in the park right in front of it.

What could be more perfect than raving in front of a children's
museum? :) Also going on right nearby on the same day is the SoFa
street fair (I believe it's $3).

The party will be free, but they are gladly accepting donations, as
this is benefit party to help raise funds to throw Charity! Charity
will be on October 4th, and the proceeds from *that* party will be
divided among a couple of really worthwhile causes (to be announced
next time!!!).

So come down and enjoy a sunny San Jose afternoon this Sunday! And
don't forget to support the Charity crew!!! These guys have been
working really hard to put together a killer party next month, and do
some good for the community.

cu then! :)

Steve

>but, also, be responsible with your soul.

i like to make a simple and effective analogy about LSD (i know, not thE
drug of usual discussion here... actually to some extent it applies to any
drug, but it just seems so right for acid...) by comparing it to fire.

fire is powerful stuff. it changed human civilization. it can be very
illuminating. it can be a source of power. it can be the most useful thing
in the world.

if you disrespect it, it will burn you. let it get out of hand, and it can
destroy a city.

'nuff said.

Another vote for MDRV600s.

Just try not to pay more than $85 bucks for them. They are fairly 
profitable and I'm sure most Good Guys wouldn't mind beating a mail 
order price.

Actually, I like the Sennheisers more. That's what I have. But at 
$150, the Sonys are clearly a better value.

You're absolutely right. It's easy for your ears to play
tricks on you, and it's worthwhile to spend some time
figuring out how to get around this. Here are some things
that I do.

1) Almost all mixers allow you to mix the main output of the
   mixer back into the headphones, along with the thing you
   are cueing. Take advantage of this! I find that mixing in
   a small amount of the main output into the headphones
   alleviates the perceptual delay between the monitor and
   the cue.

2) For particularly difficult mixes, or for those which you
   absolutely have to nail tightly, you should audition them
   in the headphones without the use of the monitor (i.e.,
   try not to pay attention to the monitor, or put both
   headphones on). Use the knob described above to sweep the
   mix back and forth a couple times and make sure that it
   sounds tight. This might seem like a pain, but it only
   takes a couple seconds.

3) After introducing your new track, you may have to make
   minor adjustments before fully entering your mix. Listen
   to the monitors to see if things seem lined up before
   committing to a mix. 

4) Riding a thick mix has more to do with setting your
   levels right than with having microscopic precision in
   your beatmatching. There's often a sweet spot between
   two records where the mix sounds the best, and it's
   usually not right in the middle. Of course, the problem
   is that you can't really tell ahead of time what the
   levels should be, so you have to get used to finding the 
   right balance on the fly.

5) When you *do* hear a mix going out of whack, don't
   panic. Having a song cut out in the middle of a mix, or
   hearing a song being sped up when it was supposed to be
   slowed down is a real drag. Learn to adjust things while
   they're playing, and to recover from errors as gracefully
   as possible. 

Just some thoughts.

Hey man, the past is the past, tomorrow's the future. Your mistakes aren't
quite as strong if you realize that they were mistakes and act upon them to
correct them. And you've done that, therefore you deserve at least my
forgiveness (I wasn't there though).
        I know how you feel. Just try to be in a better mind next time. And
nothing heals wounds better than understanding.

Did you know that yesterday was the past, tomorrow's the future, and today
is a gift because it is the present.

Thinking about????

Hi I'm Rebecca and well, I've been on the list for about two weeks now.  I
moved to Humboldt a month ago for skool from San Diego, and prior to that
I lived in Monterey (and before that in the MW, but there's a whole tale
before that). A year ago I went to some Cloud Factory parties, and lots of
parties in SF, and I also went to an SFR party in Sept(?) in a cove in
Santa Cruz (I believe it was the clothing optional one with the leather 
skinned old men). But I had lots of fun and I met this guy and he asked 
if I was on the list and I said nooo... 
And then I moved down south 
And then in April I went to a party in the Presidio (Generations of Love) 
and I saw -the same guy- (plus some other people I hadn't seen in a super 
duper long time) and I think he asked me -the same question- and I said 
noooo... 
So now I'm back up in No. Cal and yeahhh I'm on the list now.  
The tale of an often displaced raver. So now I'm in Humboldt with an e-mail 
account that comes with registration fees and by gosh darn it, I'm gonna 
utilize this sucker. 

**By the way, if you tried to go to the party up here the same weekend as 
Headwaters, the people who threw it are so so sorry it didn't work out. 
It was their first party and everything that possibly have gone wrong 
went wrong, right down to the malevolent, conspiratorial third party stuff 
that everyone will always say when its a party gone bad...
I didn't even get to go b/c my ride (a pre-arranged someone that I didn't 
know) was evil too and left way before the appointed meeting time.
But I guess the location was a two story cabin but no one got 
there except for 5 people all because of the air-headed girl leading the 
cars. But anyway, they are very very apologetic.**

Right on bud!.....keep your eyes and ears peeled....ravers L O V E to dwell
in big corporations.... Sometimes people seem to be very straight & boring
in big companies. I used to work in a very large chip-manufacturing company
(the big one) thinking I was the only raver in the company. I was pleasantly
surprised to find that to be quite untrue...in fact, one day, while
conversating with my supervisor, I find out that he used to throw "Mr.
Floppy's" raves in SF about 7 years ago! We have become really great friends
since. ;)

Heh heh, I myself work for one of the biggest of Evil Empires, Bank of
America (who are busying swallowing the earth as we speak),  and yet still
there are at least two ravers in our office! :)  It's funny when I get back
from raves on Monday and often several will gather around me like it's
Story-Time to hear what the hell I did over my weekend!  And boy was it
difficult trying to explain to them just exactly what it was I did in the
desert at Burning Man...  "But what did you *do* there?"  "People were
naked??" (*wrinkled nose*)

Heh heh!

Hi!  This is Thomas.  I'm one of SDream's hamstas.  Since SDream is still 
really upset about his camera being stolen, he doesn't want to write a 
review of Harmony's 3 year anniversary.  Me and the other hamstas had such a 
great time, and we feel so bad for him, we decided to write a review ourselves.

We caught a ride in SDream's backpack (as usual).  At one point we knew we 
weren't in the car anymore but we were in some kind of vehicle.   We sent 
Spaz topside to figure out what was going on.  He said we were on a school 
bus!  There was a cool couple in front of us talking to SDream and Marty.  
Marty is the cool girl that lives in Fresno.  She comes up and parties with 
SDream now and then.  She's really cool, with long curly red hair.  She 
brings us peanuts and sneaks them to us when SDream isn't looking.   Anyway, 
there was also this cool dog on the bus named Amber.   She was the coolest 
rave dog we've ever seen, with sparkles in her fur.

After a while we came to a stop, so we sent Spaz up to look around again.  
He came back down, his eyes huge!  "Dood!", he says, "It's SO COOL!"  We all 
looked at each other and then scrambled to see what was up!  We were all 
hanging out every available opening in SDream's backpack as he walked 
around.  The main room was classic Harmony, with fantastic artwork and the 
best music you've ever heard!  Spaz couldn't wait -- he jumped down, 
scrambled up one of the speakers, and started bopping like crazy!  I think 
he stayed there the whole night, bumming water off other ravers and 
worshipping the best visuals in the rave scene!

Then we headed out to where the tent city was.  Wow!  Life size hamsta 
nests!  People would wiggle in through the holes, nibble on some goodies, 
hang out, curl up, sleep for a while, then wiggle back out to dance some 
more!  Tim K. was there, and Tony R.  We were waving at all the little rave 
kiddies, but we didn't want to venture out just yet.

SDream walked over and checked out the chill space.  It was the best chill 
space we've seen!  SDream found Eric P. there -- Eric is so cool!  Brownie 
and Grumpy jumped ship at that point and spent the better part of the 
evening doing a slow groove to funky slow beats.  I guess they caught the 
live performances.  We wanted to see them but we didn't get back in time.  
At one point this girl's necklace broke, and Brownie and a bunch of other 
ravers helped pick up the pieces.  Isn't it cool how everyone helps each 
other out?  Then they spent part of the evening sneaking up on people that 
were almost dozing off and jumping up and down and squeezing their 
shoulders.  Of course, to a people raver, this feels like a backrub.  Then 
the person would turn around to see who it was and Brownie and Grumpy would 
jump down and run off before they were seen.

At this point the rest of us jumped down and started doing our own 
explorations. 

We found the "Fairy Ring", a tight ring of huge redwoods with chairs and 
Christmas lights in the middle.  Tiny crawled up and turned on the Christmas 
carol boxes, but after a while the people ravers turned them back off (thank 
goodness).  It was beautiful, a truly incredible touch.

We danced with Rikki in the main room, raced around Kirsten's silver tennies 
(very quickly -- she really goes crazy, jumping around and stuff), and we 
hitched a ride in Marcy's Dr. Seuss hat (it looked a lot like SDream's if 
you ask me).  Several of us came to the conclusion that Kirsten was in fact 
the embodiment of the Rave Goddess!  At one point I looked up and saw Spaz 
circle dancing on top of Wayne's head.  Twinkletoes and Starchild were 
discussing libertarian issues and sharing a doobie in the corner.  

CTD and Rlunatic were looking around for their glo-sticks, which Cutey and 
Slim and made off with and using to play swordfight across the stacks of 
records behind the DJ.   Slim got to be Darth Vader since he's taller, and 
Cutey was OB1 Kenobe.  Cutey forced Slim back until he fell into a huge cup 
of water.  He was spluttering and spitting, with the glo-stick floating on 
the surface.  Pretty funny stuff.

While SDream was hanging out with Rikki, I met Ariel.   <whistle through 
teeth> What a babe!  We've seen her at a couple of Bps, and she's such the 
PLUR kiddy!

Speaking of kitties, about that time we saw DJ Log Cat spinning!  Well of 
course all the little hamstas ran up to the speakers and started squeaking 
at the top of their lungs.  We danced and bopped our stumpy little tails 
off!  After his set, he and Moonpup were talking music, and we dragged them 
off for an adventure.  We decided to sneak off into the woods and have a 
little mini-rave among the trees.  Unfortunately one of the security guards 
saw Moonpup and made him come back.  Which was too bad cause DJ Log Cat laid 
down a set among the trees that was Da Bomb!  We were dancing among the tall 
grass and bushes...

Finally everyone was winding down, so we went back to the chill space.  
Brownie was hanging out with Leslie, giving her a scalp massage.  This means 
running through her hair and jumping up and down on her head.  If anyone saw 
Leslie's hat doing strange things, that's what that was about.

Grumpy got caught in one of those lotion-hand-orgy things where everyone is 
rubbing all their hands together.  He was greasy from one end to the other, 
but I've never seen him so happy...

We found SDream there sitting next to Amber and curled up under his shirt to 
doze for a while.  It's nice and warm in there.  Then, suddenly, SDream was 
moving.  Security was kicking us all out.  I guess none of us saw SDream 
leave his camera in the chill space.  We heard later that someone did find 
it, but in spite of security asking him to drop off the camera at lost and 
found, he kept it.  What a jerk!  The guy had purple shorts and a blue 
backpack, and his friend was wearing a Kelly green tank top.  If you know 
this guy please oh please drop Sdream a line, ok?  He's left voice messages 
for the Harmony crew but hasn't gotten a message back yet one way or the other.

Well, it was about time to bug out, but there was this huge crowd waiting 
for a bus.  At first we hung with SDream and Marty, munching on sunflower 
seeds and watching this cool whistling football fly through the air while 
listening to the drummers do their thing.  

But after a while we got  bored so we called a cab -- not easy, it took Slim 
and Cutey both to hold the receiver while Spaz jumped on the numbers to dial 
the phone.  And then of course we have to shout in the phone to be heard.  
Geez.  They've got a button on the phone for mutes, you'd think they'd have 
one on there small rodents or something...

So if you saw a cab drive up with some guys in it and then leave empty, 
well, it wasn't empty.  If you'd looked close enough, you'd have seen tiny 
little faces at the window and little paws waving goodbye...

Slim stuck around and helped clean up, but all he could pick up were the 
cigarette butts, and there were a BUNCH!

Thanks go out to the Harmony crew for creating such an incredible event!

G'Day!

 I'm thinking of going out and having fun tonight and was wondering who 
else is? Or, more specifically who is who would like a paying rider from 
Santa Cruz?
 
 I promise I'm housebroken and will not urinate or vomit on your car! I 
can tell some interesting stories on parties I've worked on and will even 
massage sore shoulders if one were to ask nicely! :)

 I can be reached here until 5 (know that may be fun!) or I can be called 
@ 408.458.4421


peas trout,


Ran

SPACE-ALIEN IMPREGNATION:  ARE YOU INSURED?

REUTERS

LONDON -- Worried about sex with space aliens, maybe after a trip to
"Independence Day?"

A British broker claimed yesterday to be the first insurer in the world to
offer a policy against impregnation by beings from another planet.

Specialist broker Goodfellow Rebecca Ingrams Pearson (GRIP) said for $155 a
year, adults living in Britain could insure against two sorts of
extraterrestrial interference.

Abduction by aliens would net the victim about $160,000.  Impregnation -- a
risk against which both men and women can insure -- would double that sum.

"I personally would not buy a policy of this nature because I don't think
the risk is commensurate with the premium," said Simon Burgess, GRIP
managing director.  "But if there is the fear of these things out there, we
are justified in offering to cover people against them."

Some U.S. insurers, cashing in on the box-office movie phenomenon
"Independence Day" and on recent evidence that life may have existed on
Mars, have offered policies covering abduction by aliens.

But until now, Burgess said, it has been impossible to insure against being
impregnated by a being from another planet.

I agree!! The Charity crew could use a lot of support!!! This party 
will be coming on Oct. 4th. It will be in the city (sf) and should be 
tons of fun!! The promoter's purpose of this party was and is to bring 
several different sound systems together to form one party, on one 
night. Together, raising some $ for Omar and a local S.F. homeless 
organization (I think). This party is going to have a tremendous impact 
on our scene, which can hopefully lead to a tremendous impact on our 
local world!!! The is much more to talk about regarding this party, so 
keep your eyes and ears open!!! Try to make it on Sunday to find out 
what these guys are all about!!!

Peace,

Greg :)

> i really believe that drugs like this can help you get in better touch with yourself, and that (even if you never take the drugs again) you _can_ take something of what you learn with you into the rest of your life... but only if you try to.

I have heard a lot of people talk about bringing their ravEing
experiences to the their everyday life (such as Brians example above).
However I haven't heard much in the way as to _how_ a person brings
their experiences with them. 

The way I do this is by sucsessfully *associating* the state I was in at
a rave with something that I can do at any time. Small example: I have
only taken LSD twice in my lifetime, but during both times I was able to
*link* the expierence by running my right thumb across the back of my
left hand twice. So during my trip whenever I felt  a peak I would do
the guesture I gave above. Now my eyes don't exactly dialate into
pankaces when I do this, but I do get a very strong feeling of joy and
satisfaction when I do. And I can do this ANYTIME I WANT! So anytime I
feel frustrated or depressed =( I can instantly put myself back into
that state of pure joy. =)

     Hi all :
     
     I am looking to buy some technics 1200's & a mixer in the near future. 
     Does anyone have some used ones for sale, or know where I can pick new 
     ones up for a good price (under $400).
     
     Or can anyone recommend a good, but less expensive, direct drive 
     turntable that is a good starter ?
     
     Also :
     
     I am currently looking for somewhere new to live in SF. I would like a 
     decent sized room in a mellow household. Will have a brother coming 
     over here at start of Oct for a couple of weeks, so he'll be staying 
     too. Prefer Mission, Haight, Western addition, etc.,
     
     Any offers ?
     
     Peace
     
     Ciaran

You know, there just seems to be something ironic about naming a party
after the price to get in. I didn't know price was such a big deal. Oh
thats right "$5-10 parties are cool and $20 parties are bunk" at least
thats what I keep hearing from a lot of people. 

Wow... I just got really pesimistic just now. Thats not me.

Jeremy -
if you want truly good stuff made from organic cotton: Patagonia (on North Point) in SF.  I have a shirt from them that is like 10 years old and I wear it
all the time and it's still in great shape.  everything they make is excellent,
and they guarantee it.  but, of course, you get what you pay for.

"Let me have silence always in the centre of the shouting, that is
essential. Let me have silence so that no pin may drop and not be
heard, and not a whisper. Escape is for all our spouting, nor the
needle scratching upon this gramophone of the circular cosmic spot.
Hear me, mark me, learn me, throw the mind's ear open. Shut up the
mind's eye, all will be music. What sculpture of sound cannot, what cannot
as a fluid token words, that nothing else cannot."

I'm not a zen master of equipment, but I wouldn't recommend anything below
Technics 1200's.  I onced goofed around on a friends "DJ" turntables which
looked very nice on the outside...they were Pioneers or something, but
there were slight, easy to miss details that made them harder to use if you
know what 1200's are like  (in this case, these "DJ" tables had a harsh
metal rim around the edges of the platter, which grabbed a sucka hold on
the slipmats, and made cueing, scratching, etc *very* difficult.

I'm sure there were other details that I would have noticed if I'd spent
more time on them (or if I knew half of what some other people know about
equipment)

There's a reason why 1200's are considered the standard...don't sell
yourself short.   You might regret it.

     On the subject of hemp clothing :
     
     
     I saw in a uk magazine some time last year that Adidas were bringing 
     out a hemp trainer called "the chronic". It showed a pic and they 
     looked cool. I tried a few places : copeland's, footlocker, etc., but 
     couldnae get a pair.
     
     Has anyone got a pair or know where to get em (size 10.5)

     Idea!
     
     Next rave, everybody rub Pengo's left hand with their right thumbs at 
     once... I wanna see what happens.
     
     8P   
     
     I know what you mean though.. If I'm in a good mental/physical state, 
     I can get body rushes just by willing them.  A lot of people who have 
     done acid, shrooms or E claim they feel a similar sensation with the 
     isometric tension used when practicing katas, or through other 
     stretching or disciplined motion exercises.
     
     And then there's dancing.  Did anybody else check out Robbie Hardkiss 
     last night in San Jose...? pretty damn good vibe for a club if you ask 
     me (I was the guy in the brown shirt going off under the air 
     conditioner that kept dripping water right in front of the TT's).  
     
     He skipped the needle about three times, but the tasty selections and 
     smooth ass fades more than compensated.  Really really tasty all 
     around.  And you can tell he likes to see people have a good time... I 
     guess I like DJs that scan the crowd before picking out the next 
     track, and seem to really get into it.  Too bad I didn't start really 
     going off until the last half hour or so... he saved some yummy 
     uptempo acid tracks for last.  Makes you appreciate it more if you 
     haven't heard it all night.  .. and then they closed ... DOH!  If it 
     ain't the carding and the money and the security and the people who 
     get evil on booze (I strive to be a happy drunk) and the bullshit then 
     its that 2:00am thing.  Yuk! phooey!  Clubs... eeewwwww... this one 
     was much better than most though.
     
     Aieee my head...

The hemp Adidas ARE available, although I didn't know they were
called the Chronic (hee hee hee).  I've seen them both in "Soccer
Madness" (a soccer clothes/supplies mail order catalog) and at a
store in Seattle called "The American Hemp Merchantile."  (uh, I wish
I had the number, but I don't...you can always do 206.555.1212 and
ask the nice information folks...)  They are pretty dang phat, I
would have to say.

I strongly resent the fact that you disagreed with the pure wisdom of my
previous post.  This is obviously because you are a (choose one)

[] digital cretin
[] analog reactionary
-> unhip dweeb who knows nothing about house and techno
[] unenlightened novice who thinks great music could happen outside the 60s

The reason you decided to flame me is because you cannot handle

->my drug usage
[] your drug usage
[] drugs, period
[] the truth

Well, for your information, everybody knows

[] you basically suck
[] you really suck
[] you totally suck
-> I am God

What could we expect from a loser who uses a

[] 303
[] Sampler
[] Digital synth
[] DAT machine
[] MIDI sequencer
-> Unix machine

and doesn't even know who _Keith Emerson_ (insert name of obscure
performer or synth designer) is?

I suggest that in the future before you post your (select all that
apply)

[] boring
[] wrong
[] stupid
[] uninformed
[] revisionist
[] heretical
[] subversive
-> criminal
[] treasonous
[] seditious

flame bait and misinformation you kick back and listen to net.gods
like myself tell you how it really is.

Hey, how long has this form been up on hyperreal? How come more people dont

     And now for the scoop...
     
     I was reading an old copy of High Times (too much time on me hands) 
     that had an article concerning that very shoe.
     
     I'm paraphrasing here, so all quotes are top o de head...
     
     +++++++++++++++++++++
     
     They were originally named the Chronic because some researchers 
     determined it was a cool slang for "the Best", and that would help it 
     sell to the groovy younger crowd.
     
     Some marketing agent decided they had to pull the name the Chronic 
     after some higher ups heard that it's a slang for a strain of strong 
     marijuana (*you're shittin me*).  The name was changed, but at time of 
     printing, they were still serious about getting them to market (I 
     recall the issue was about a year and a half old).
     
     +++++++++++++++++++++
     
     Boy they sure seem to be acting naive... I wonder what their marketing 
     staff would do if we told them how great their three stripe track 
     suits look under a black light when they leave knappy trails that just 
     surpass any other non-baterry powered garment known to humans.

The hemp Adidas ARE available, although I didn't know they were 
called the Chronic (hee hee hee).  I've seen them both in "Soccer 
Madness" (a soccer clothes/supplies mail order catalog) and at a 
store in Seattle called "The American Hemp Merchantile."  (uh, I wish 
I had the number, but I don't...you can always do 206.555.1212 and 
ask the nice information folks...)  They are pretty dang phat, I 
would have to say.

     On the subject of hemp clothing :
     I saw in a uk magazine some time last year that Adidas were
bringing 
     out a hemp trainer called "the chronic". It showed a pic and
they 
     looked cool. I tried a few places : copeland's, footlocker,
etc., but 
     couldnae get a pair.
     
     Has anyone got a pair or know where to get em (size 10.5)

I just wanted to post and say how much I like all of the sfraves people. I
may not agree with all of your opinions, but I certainly dig your approach. I
really have a great respect for you all- it's too bad that it's so hard to
hook up at an event! I guess there's time. I don't plan on going back to LA
........EVER

If there's anyone willing to take me and my roommate around to get us
introduced, I'd really appreciate it! I'm so eager to see the faces that go
with all of the great posts! E-mail me directly and , maybe we can ride to an
event together or somethin'-

Oh, I live in Marina

There's a possibility that I'll be at Five tonight, so look for a tall,
bleached blonde guy wearing a Sesame Street T-shirt.

I'll be there wearing a black billabong sweater (with a single vertical
red&white stripe) OR my coveted authentic Ono-Sendi T-shirt (Big Yellow
Smiley on front). Depends on how hot I am. So look out for a(nother)
tall 6'4" curly blond kid!

I spent part of this afternoon and evening collecting some statistics
on sfraves that I think may stimulate some discussion. I was surprised by
some of the things I found, and profoundly unsurprised by others. I hope
that this message causes all of you to think about what this list was
designed for and how we're all using it.

If you don't want to look at all of these boring statistics, at least
skip to the end and read my conclusions. I think you all might find them
thought-provoking, if not completely flameworthy.

NOTES
=====

[1] The number of distinct hosts is the number of machines in the
    subscriber list, not the number of domains

[2] September archive statistics only include the month to date.

[3] Network bandwidth is computed by multiplying the number of distinct
    hosts by the total size of the archive files, because it is only
    necessary to initiate one SMTP connection per host, regardless of the
    number of sfraves subscribers at that host.

[4] The NRR subject tag is not used rigorously and was only adopted
    halfway through this year.

[5] BSP also is not used rigorously.

[6] This was a first-level approximation: I don't include the messages
    that initiate a thread, and I don't even attempt to track threads
    whose names change. This may lead to skewed results, but hey, I'm not
    being paid to do this, so deal.

[7] Many of the most frequent posters have changed email addresses at
    least once. If I was able to figure out their previous email
    addresses, I incorporated them into the figure for their most recent
    address. I may have missed a few, though.

[8] This does not include foreign subscribers who have email addresses
    through US domains (.com, .edu, etc.)


CONCLUSIONS
===========

I have been an sfraves subscriber since September of 1993, when I was a
student at the University of Montana. Over the course of the last three
years, both the list and my relationship to it have changed profoundly.
In those three years, sfraves has gone through many sets of active
participants, and the list has spawned many beautiful and unique
organizations (Friends and Family being perhaps the most prominent). I,
too, have changed, first becoming a DJ, and then a community-oriented
rave promoter (in Montana) myself.

SFRaves has never been the most focused or terse of mailing lists. Part
of its charm is that it is the voice of a community, and not just a place
for people to announce (or plan) parties. People in the community care
about each other, and one of the things that makes the Bay Area's rave
scene one of the world's most vibrant is its commitment to fostering a
caring, vibe-heavy community spirit. I admired this spirit enough to make
it one of the primary things that drew me to San Francisco.

However, it is my considered opinion that SFRaves used to be a much more
useful and easy-to-deal-with resource than it is now. Over the last year,
I've watched the amount of traffic on the list skyrocket while the amount
of actual information has remained pretty much constant. I find myself
deleting messages unread far more frequently than I used to, and I often
find myself purging whole threads.

Often these threads have nothing at all to do with raving. I know that
this has been discussed often on the list over the years, and I'm not
going to be a dick about this, but I will say that the number of threads
that have left me rolling my eyes in frustration has increased sharply
over the last year. 

It is a mistake to assume that we all share the same ideology. It's
probably a mistake to assume that we share anything at all, beyond a love
for raving and a fondness for dance music (in its most general sense -- I
love hard techno, dark jungle, and extremely minimal, quirky hard house,
can deal with trip hop, breakbeat house and old-school trance, and
absolutely cannot stand Goa trance, garage, and disco. Are any of your
tastes exactly the same as mine? I don't _think_ so).

I'll very quickly point out that I don't think that any problems with the
list are any individual's fault -- it's just the way that the atmosphere
has changed on the list over time, and that I personally liked the list
better back in the old days. I've talked to many other "old-school"
subscribers about this recently (many of them people who've been on the
list since it was hosted on techno.stanford.edu) and they've voiced a
similar sense of discontenment.

I'm not trying to start a flamewar here, only making a heartfelt plea. I
think there are a lot of wonderful, interesting people on this list, but
could we talk about raves a little more and the random other stuff a
little less? I personally would like sfraves a _lot_ more if we
collectively tried a little bit harder to keep our messages focused on
raves and raving. Barring that, could everybody try a little harder to
post fewer, more informative messages? Eric (Peterson), I don't mean to
single you out, but if you look at my statistics, you've posted almost
two messages for _every_ _day_ in 1996. Doesn't that seem just a tiny bit
excessive?

Something to remember is that each and every message you post consumes a
healthy amount of bandwidth. As I point out in the statistics I've
compiled, each message posted to sfraves initiates 234 network
connections so that the mail can be distributed. That's a good chunk of
network bandwidth. Hyperreal has an _extremely_ heavy mail load. While
the whole reason that Hyperreal exists is for all of us to have a
resource, I think it would be nice to remember that we all have to share
the machine and that network bandwidth, like other resources, benefits
from conservation and prudent usage.

Anyway, I've ranted enough for one night, so I'll step down off the soap
box and fade back into the shadows. I've been very frustrated with the
list recently and have been strongly considering unsubscribing, but I
figured I'd give the list one more chance. You are all beautiful people
(albeit often in fashions that are completely foreign to me), but I can
only take so much noise in my inbox, you know?

PS -- If people find these statistics useful, I may consider posting them
semi-regularly. I may even figure out more statistically valid things to
monitor. If you have ideas about these sorts of things, please get in
touch with me.

  coh>      
  coh> Hi all :
  coh> 
  coh> I started to send a mail with a couple of questions and ended up with 
  coh> the following list. It is a San Francisco Bay area "Best of.." from 
  coh> the unique viewpoint of those of us on the scene.

  This is a neat idea, and don't take any of my answers personally -- as
  people are no doubt rapidly realizing on sfraves, I'm sort of cranky
  and iconoclastic. And plainspoken too. :)

  coh> 1.Anyone bought any good cd compilations lately (all genres)? 

       Yes, several:

       V/A - Platinum Breakz (Metalheadz) -- jungle
       V/A - Tech Steppin' (Emotif) -- darkstep jungle
       V/A - Virus Volume 2 (ACV / HotTrax) -- dark housy techno
       V/A - Synewave New York (Kickin' / Synewave) -- hard techno

  coh> 2.What's on your playlists ?

       Rollerskate Skinny - Horsedrawn Wishes (Warner Bros) -- psychotic pop
       Catherine Wheel - Like Cats and Dogs (Mercury) -- power pop
       Muslimgauze - Veiled Sisters (Soleilmoon) -- mysterious ambient
       Leo Anibaldi - Void (RePHLeX) -- darqambient
       Robert Armani - Spectacular (ACV) -- hard techno / hard house
       DJ Sprout - Freq of Nature (Sub Freq) -- dark techno
       The Cardigans - First Band on the Moon (Mercury) -- fluffy pop
       4D - Hidden (Labworks) -- dark gritty acidcore
       Kinesthesia - Empathy Box Remixes (RePHLeX) -- weird electro
       everything by Underworld

  coh> 3.Any good RR books/literature that you feel is too good to keep to 
  coh> yourself ? Inquiring minds (i.e. me) want to know.

       The Acid House, by Irving Welsh
       Orion, by Masamune Shirow (absolutely beautiful Japanese comic)

  coh> 4.Best free dance magazine ?

       Resonance (out of Washington) OR
       XLR8R

  coh> 5.Best commercial dance magazine (domestic) ?

       They all suck (IMHO, of course).

  coh> 6.Best commercial dance magazine (imported) ?

       The Wire OR
       Jockey Slut OR
       Generator

  coh> 7.What are your favorite clothes stores ?

       I haven't bought clothes for several years, but I tend to favor
       thrift stores.

  coh> 8.What are your fav music stores ?

       in SF: Soundworks (techno) and Aquarius Records (music w/ guitars)
       in Berkeley: Rasputin's, Amoeba, and Mod Lang

  coh> 9.Best place for a beer (and dance music) ?

       I avoid beer (and beer drinkers) like the plague. I don't drink,
       and while I don't mind other people drinking, I hate the vibe that
       booze fosters.

  coh> 10.Best place to go after the party's ended ? who said "home" ? 

       Home (preferably with a nice person to take a shower with and then
       go to sleep curled up with :)

  coh> 11.Best place for used dance records/cds ?

       Open Mind Records on Divisadero

  coh> 12.Best radio station for house/techno/dub/trance ?

       As if. The pirate I want to run out of my apartment. :)

  coh> 13.Best natural high ?

       Dancing for 8 hours straight to really good music, preferably
       while wearing a shit-eating grin. It helps if all of my friends
       are there, too. A close second is _spinning_ for eight hours in
       front of my friends while wearing a shit-eating grin.

  coh> 14.Best place to hear newest records ?  

       MaD when Jon Santos, Joe Rice, or Sho Kuwamoto are on the decks.

  coh> 15.Best place to buy used dj equipment ?

       This list, most likely.

  coh> 16.Best place to buy used stereo equipment?

       *shrug* dunno

  coh> 17.Best place to bring a rave newbie ?

       Friends'n'Family

  coh> 18.Best illegal high (duh !) ?

       I wouldn't know, being straight-edge and all.

  coh> 19.Best place to have a spiritual raving experience ?

       At any party where you have good friends and great music.

  coh> 20.Best Sunday party ?

       Sunset

  coh> 21.Best Dj - Garage house/progressive house ?

       Monty

  coh> 22.Beat Dj - Goa Trance

       *cough*

  coh> 23.Beat Dj - Jungle

       Thad, hands down. Although I'm partial to *stareyes* (Vivian) as well.

  coh> 24.Best Dj - Techno

       Sho Kuwamoto or Franklin Shotwell (Minor Minor)

  coh> 25.Best Dj - Trip hop/downbeat

       Felix tha Dogg

       Q Bert all the way

       Peter Laselle

  coh> 28.Best Dj (all categories)

       Sho Kuwamoto

  coh> 29.Best one-off this year (so far)

       Beautiful People (or Even Further, but I doubt you're counting
       events in Wisconsin, are you?)

  coh> 30.Best regular event (indoors)

       MaD

  coh> 31.Best regular event(outdoors).

       Sunset

  coh> 32.Best kept secret (club)

       MaD

  coh> 33.Best record label ?

       Reload Records or ACV

  coh> 34.Best clothes label ?

       Not only do I not have an answer for this question, I think it's
       silly. Raves aren't about clothes. They're about dancing with
       friends to good music. I find the idea of "rave clothes"
       irritating.

  coh> 35.Best outdoor party for those not driving ?   

       Good question.

  coh> 36.Best mixer ?

       Old Numarks OR
       Rane MP24

  coh> 37.Best collective ?

       Those wacky Friends'n'Family kids

  coh> 38.Best company to rent a sound system from ?

       JK

  coh> 39. Best visual/lighting company fort your party ?

       I like Impact, but just because they're friends.

  coh> 40.Best place to pick up rave flyers ?

       Soundworks, most likely

  coh> 41.Best company for printing flyers ?

       Kinko's :) (which humorously makes a point for me: I prefer a
       well-designed black and white flyer that was made with soul to big
       huge zillion-color die-cut flyers made by commercial scumbags)

  coh> 42.Best weekly :

       MaD on mondays
       jungle at The Top on Saturdays / electro at the Top on Saturdays


Good luck extracting a meaningful "best of" from the scattershot replies
you are no doubt going to receive. :) SFRaves is hardly a homogenous
community, and there's so much shit going on in this city that it's hard
to even know what's going on, much less what's going on that you really
like.

I talked to the producer today and he said the show has been scheduled for
Monday September 30th.  It airs on NBC, in SF that's Channel 4, at 1:00 pm
(it's noon in Phila, so doublecheck if you're not in SF).

He says that he thinks I came across the way I wanted on the show, so we'll
see.  It's edited some but not heavily, but he says the club kid factor is
edited down a little.   We'll see.

I'm putting a copy of the letter I sent to them as a followup at the end of
this post.  This is FYI, and is in no way to open up any other message
traffic on the topic.  I suggest that if you're interested, you watch the
show ... and we'll see if my presence in some way tempered the negative
perspectives of the worried moms on the show ...

I, for one, will NOT be watching the show when it airs, however.  Next
Tuesday I'll be leaving on a 15-day cruise through the Panama Canal with a
friend who is 80+ years old, and who has dreamed of doing this cruise for
years.  On 9/30, I'll be on a day trip to Tikal in Guatemala, one of the
most important Mayan archeological sites, climbing a pyramid in the jungle,
YES!!!  Send me good calming energy the whole time I'm gone if you would
... this woman talks constantly, and I'll be captive on the Love Boat,
yikes!

While I'm gone, I'll be uns*bbing to SFRaves ... which means I will miss
all the good juicy posts ... so here's my request ... can people copy me
directly on their especially good posts from next Tues until Weds 10/8?  I
hate to miss good party reviews, etc.

I'll miss you all!

Leeza Gibbons, Jason Walker and John Downey
The Leeza Show
Balaban Building, Suite C
5555 Melrose Avenue
Hollywood, CA 90038

Dear Leeza, John and Jason,

I wanted to thank you for the opportunity to appear on your show yesterday.
I left, as I arrived, feeling proud to have had the chance to represent
the very positive aspects of the widespread sociological phenomenon of
raving, and yet feeling very disappointed that the focus of the show was on
the softest underbelly of the movement, which is that some young teenagers
use raves (and the often-available drugs) to escape their everyday lives.

Like the blind men who each touched a different part of the elephant, and
who each thought that they then knew what an elephant was like, this show
has taken a small aspect of a large phenomenon, and presents it as if it
represents the larger picture.

It is clear from the consistent high quality of The Leeza Show that
sensationalistic journalism is never your goal, a position that I defended
repeatedly to those people in the San Francisco and L.A. rave communities
who felt that no talk show would ever try to give fair representation to
what is clearly, to us, a positive movement of collective consciousness and
spirit.

Most ravers, in the Bay Area at least, are well over 18, most have active
and responsible lives (from college students to technology geeks to
corporate owners and executives), and are in no-way drug dependent or
drug-centric in their raving experiences.  We have created a diverse
culture that reflects our own diversity, and that culture includes art,
technology and fashion as well as music.  We have great spiritual awareness
and a commitment to our community as well as the world in which we live.
Many of our parties are benefits, raising money and organizing drives for
medical expenses of people in our group who have had tragic accidents, as
well as canned-food, toy and book drives for local charities.

And many of us older ravers take very seriously our role as examples and
inspirations to the young kids in our community who get neither support nor
understanding in their home environments.  Our world truly is a village.

I know that was not the topic of your show, but I'm also concerned that
this important aspect was not conveyed. My fear from the show is that more
parents will become unnecessarily worried about their kids going to raves,
when in fact the rave community may be the greatest haven of love and
positive support their kids have available to them.  When you choose words
like "cult," you have planted an entirely off-track thought into the minds
of parents who have no other information source.  There is nothing
"cultish" in this phenomenon, there are no "leaders" and there are no rules
of behavior for acceptance. It is about individuality and expression, not
repression and blind following.

When you invite a sleazy ex-drug dealer from Florida to tell horror
stories, you are creating frightening images that have no resemblance to
the truth in most rave situations.  I have attended hundreds of parties,
from Philadelphia to Phoenix, Seattle, Nevada and the Bay Area, and have
never witnessed the kinds of people that he describes.  Perhaps in club
environments, but not in real raves that I have experienced.  While I
accept it as a possibility in certain places at certain times, I'm afraid
that your viewers will take this image with them as if it happens
everywhere.

Additionally, the audience (and most audience camera shots) featured "club
kids," the stacked-shoes, painted faces, vinyl clothing and black lips that
are so prevalent in the club scene in L.A. and elsewhere.  Though
photogenic, these kids are not representative of the rave scene, and I'd
wager you'd have to attend party after party in San Francisco to even find
one in the crowd.  Club kids have a value system that is harsher, more
competitive, more fashion oriented, and much less optimistic than most
ravers, and, although they are as welcome as anyone in the rave scene, they
are not typical.

Unfortunately, in retrospect, perhaps I should have been less respectful of
others' stories (all of which I found important and interesting), and
spoken up more to make these points.  I wanted to let the kids in the
audience and at home, who are going to parties where people like your
Florida drug dealer will prey on them, know that they have control over
what they get out of raving, and out of their lives.  All they have to do
to change their rave experience from an escapist chance to use drugs into a
growth and love-oriented experience, is to open their eyes and see the
higher level of raving that is happening around them.

That inspirational empowering message is so important to our kids today,
and I am concerned that the end result of this show will be more parents
using it as justification to forbid their children from attending what may
be one of the most uplifting and expressive parts of their lives.

I was thinking of suggesting that you consider a show concept that
emphasizes the true spiritual side of raving, but I'm not sure that might
be as "marketable" to your audience, and I'm not sure it would have any
benefit to the rave community, which prefers to remain out of the public
eye, for many reasons that I'm sure you understand.  Should you want to
consider that in the future, though, maybe I can be of assistance in
helping you talk to others who would have thoughts to share on that topic.

Thank you again for this amazing experience in my life.  Your entire team,
without exception, were gracious, friendly and encouraging. Who ever would
have thought I'd have a trailer with my name on it in Hollywood?!  If
you're ever in the Bay Area and would like to experience our rave scene,
please call me; I'd be honored to share my world with you.

Best regards,


Leslie Ayres

I've had mixed feelings about some of the stuff that you talk
about. On one hand, this should be an informational list dedicated to
discussing raving and its implications. But on the other hand, many of
us are friends, and many of us become friends as a result of our
association on this list.

Sure, I've been guilty of posting the occasional "NRR: need housing"
or "who wants to go out for dinner tonight?". But it's hard to deny
that many of us have a great deal in common (professions, hobbies,
sleeping patterns, etc.), and as a result, we sometimes want to talk
about things other than raving with people who we think are really
cool. And I know that if I needed a roommate, I'd rather find one
here than from some random agency.

I've said it before, and I'll say it again: The thing that makes
SFRaves (and similar regional lists) unique is the fact that we all
live in close proximity. Other mailing lists or discussion groups
frequently suffer the distance effect, where one person may live in
Italy, another person in Texas, etc. We all pretty much will run into
each other at one time or another. So it's sort of like a clubhouse
or a cafe of sorts. Sorry, but it's unavoidable :)

If it really bothers you, just set up some good mail filters. I've been
considering doing the same, but my ELISP skills are a little rusty
(yes, I enjoy self-abuse: I use emacs for my mailer)...

But then again, nothing brightens my day at work more than reading 
"I'm having a wonderful day, and I wanted to share with you!" from
a complete stranger.

just my 5 drachmas

     Shhhhh... that sound... do you smell something... yeah I can feel it 
     from here... it looks like... the sound of an 808 beating the shit out 
     of a wall in a dark shy side of town.  A door opens and someone rushes 
     me in.  The hallway, a turn and a climb upstairs.  The smell of people 
     moving for a noble cause.  The frantic stacatto growl of the 303.  The 
     screaming.  A crazy whine, pitching and weaving.  The whistles.  The 
     drums.  My leg... it's moving.  I turn to my friends, they're gone.  
     We belong on the floor... time to catch up.  Aiee-Aiiee... One more 
     time.  I hear the siren swelling.  Gotta move.  The sound of logs and 
     snares and tin and metal and machines and people and robots and noise 
     and a hundred shoes twisting and stomping concrete and soul and the 
     healing of a thousand shamen with their eyes closed beating drums 
     their mothers and fathers made in a sacred trance a long time ago.
     
     If I tune in I can hear the beads of your sweat hitting the ground.
     
     Staying home is not an option.
     Peace through budget raving,
     I'm 0.025 Millennia old!
     Leaving work now!
     Viva Hamstas (I loved that post!)

     p.s.       I will be good about observing the precautions about less 
     posts, I promise.  I'd hate to see this list get ugly, or disappear.  
     I thought when I was 17 that I would be dead by today (an arbitrary 
     date, but a belief with some basis in fact).  I'm not dying anymore, 
     I'm living and I thought it best to share it with some really great 
     people.  I don't know if it's this city, or the time of the year, or 
     just tonight.  Even through the clouds the stars are there, best to 
     believe in them.

     Ozymandias :
     
     
     
     
     Congratulations on a fine information gathering exercise. It was 
     particularly interesting to see who else subscribes from my domain. 
     (Fellow Airtouch.com ravers, gimme a shout !)
     But : how can a posting exclusively regarding sfraves be regarded as 
     NRR ??????????
     
     Please explain the proper usage for this TlA (three letter acronym).
     
     I've been on this list for about 6 months, having only moved here in 
     the past year, here are some of my observations :
     
     Personally, I like to use the list to comminicate with people of a 
     like mind. I already know we have something in common by virtue of the 
     fact that we subscribe to the same list.
     
     I have been on other mailing lists (Orbital, Chemical brothers) that 
     got boring just because posters were pretty narrow in their 
     conversational (or should that be letter-writing) scope.
     I cannot stand people who spend ALL their time talking about records, 
     and DJ's. (I speak from experience, having dated one such girl).  This 
     is called trainspotting (before the movie) in Europe and is strictly 
     for nerds.
     
     I agree that some of the threads get out of hand, a case in point 
     being one a while back regarding Gays and Raves. I thought that thread 
     was largely redundant as there would not be a rave (dance) scene in 
     the US or anywhere else without the support of the Gay community/clubs 
     in the first place.
     Similarly, with other issues where everybody wishes to express their 
     opinion there can be a lot of "noise" on the list.
     
     Another statistic that would be interesting to gather would be the 
     average number of postings over a weekend, as I'm sure many of you 
     have left work on a Friday to return to a stuffed mailbox on Monday 
     morning :).
     
     Anyway, one of the reasons I (and many others like me, I'm sure) 
     subscribe is to discuss loosely rave related issues with intelligent 
     people and hopefully make a friend or two along the way : although I 
     have to admit that I have not met many of you so far in person. 
     Which begs the question "whither Sfraves laminates ?"
     
     
     Peace,
     
     
     Ciaran.

I most assuredly did _not_ mean to send my responses to Ciaran's survey
to the list. Bad bad BAD ozymandias! I guess I didn't look at those list
headers closely enough. You are all free to spank me next time you see
me.

Is it just me, or is that "Hey Macarina" craze spreading through Mid-America
a plot to destroy what's left of the mind of Humanity?  Yuck!  I can't think
of anything more bland than doing the "Hey Marcarina" dance with 10,000
other people.  All doing the same dance, in the same way, at the same time!
IT IS A PLOT devised by an evil alien race!!!!!  ;)

Geez, you guys are right.  Hard work, passion and creative accomplishment
are for 'suckers'!  Not!  It's about time for the "looters" of Love and
Freedom to be recognized for what they are:  worthless.  Any thinking person
can recognize value of Objectivism.  Any hard working, seeking for Truth
individual who stands for who and what they are and not who and what they
should be in order to be popular realizes the importance of personal and
individual responsibility.  But in the age of "entitlements", the very idea
of accountability and personal responsibility are labeled as idealistic
dreams.  Well, I guess the masses have been brainwashed!  Taking the premise
of Ayn Rand's ideals one step further into the realm of spirituality, I
think it is said best as:  Only God helps those who first help themselves.
Guilt is the only weapon of looters.  And that is wearing thin.

My $2,000,000 worth.

        Well, I went down there with my girl about 11, got there at 11:40. I
didn't even need to get out of the car to see the waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay
too huge line and the people I'd most like not to have contact with.
        When I turned around to get outta there, some hard ass wanna be
whatever gangsta dumshits said something like "dumunamomo bo jomo". I
figured he was from out of town and just smiled. He repeated himself, his
friend thought it was halloween or something telling me "Trick" instead of
treat. Confused little kiddies we're gettin around here nowadays.
        Anyway, just strengthening of my beliefs that bigger parties suck.
And an argument for those who think that the less expensive parties are
better. I'd rather pay $20 to be with nice friendly people who at least
sorta speak english than pay 1,2, or $5 for some fucked up ass party filled
with gangsta's and wannabees, and just people I tried to ignore in high school.

it's 4 a.m., and i'm cleaning my apartment, since our landlord and
prospective tenants are coming to see it at 10:30...

tonight i've also managed to write a new arrangement of a jazz-funk tune i
wrote a few years ago... it's called "Fee Fi Fo Funk." i sequenced it in my
MIDI setup and made it into a bit of a trip-hop kind of thing. i also added
some lyrics:


jack the funky raver climbed a glo-stik to the sky
he kept climbin' and climbin' and climbin' till he got real high
then he felt the warmth of ecstasy and knew that he could fly
he was huggin' everybody, givin' out his phat supply

they were dancin' to the rhythm they were groovin' to the beat
they were gettin' down, 'round town, into the streets
they were smilin' the were huggin' they were chillin' they were druggin'
they were totally euphoric everyone was full of lovin'

then the big man came outside he had a flashlight and a gun
he said, "Fee Fi Fo Funk you're havin' too much fun"
but jack turned on the magic vibe that spreads to everyone
and you know-- the man was dancin' till the morning sun...


silly, yes. and they don't quite come out right in print.
but if it made just one of you smile, it was worth it!

love,

brian

ps      some credit must go to the "little red raver girl" story on
hyperreal for the inspiration for the whole fairy-tale theme, tho the title
(which existed four years ago) was begging for these lyrics all along...

Not bad for acme i'd say.  The jungle was a nice change, especially the guy
playing 1-3ish, I love it when d.j.s look like they're actually feeling the
music like the crow, not just dishing it out like stew. (this guy was getting
down behind the tables!, almost beat Moonpups' naked boogie down sets)
I'll have to admit jungle is growing on me.  Still can't get over the
occasional "rat tat tat, blow you away" lyrics.  Can anyone suggest a good
jungle comp w/o the gangsta shit.  I can't believe someone out here on the
left coast hasn't started producing SF house style influenced jungle.
Lookin for a jungle w/o animals,

For me raving helps me recognize that everyone is a spiritual being with an 
ego more so than an ego in search of spirituality.
Raving helps me feel more connected to people by sharing the music which,
then extends to the sharing of the universe.  This increased awareness of sharing
the universe is something I usually take with me when I leave the rave (and in
a way keeps the rave going) and it helps me feel more connected to the world.

With the increased sence of connectedness I experience less fear in my life and can 
enjoy the here and now more.  And I am more able to recognize and experience the dance
of life.

On some level we all share the trance.

If anyone is wanting to go to the rave in the mountains 4 hours from
the bay area but doesn't have a ride...well, I was going to go but my
friends flaked and I don't really want to drive all those hours
alone. I can take 1-3 people. I will drive through SF or East
Bay. I'll probably come back Sunday.

        Just wonderin how to get started in the modeling business? If anyone
knows, can you tell me how to get started.
        Too many people have said that I could model if I wanted too,
they've said that I look a lot better than most models they see. 
        I figured that I'd give it a go, and check it out. It  might be fun
but by no means a career.

Thanks ahead of time.

Subject: raver soccer fans?
Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

one of the serendipities about raving for me has been the prevalence of
Soccer gear & the truly multinational scene in the bay area (which means a
higher proportion of soccer fans) . . . I have been lame about playing
recently, but I've always loved playing and watching real futbol.  I've
been really bummed that Sportschannel hasn't been showing English Premier
League highlights weekly like they have for all the 7 years I've lived here
(maybe they're waiting for baseball to end).

i've had too many lame excuses (other than Sunset!) for not seeing the San
Jose Clash -- the new Major League Soccer team, although if you've read
this far you probably know that -- in person this year yet, but they will
playing this Thursday night at 7:30 in San Jose in the first game of the
playoffs against Los Angeles. If anyone wants to go, I'll go get the tix
tomorrow and I'll be driving from Berkeley. I think the cheapest are about
$15-$20.  Anyone who's interested, feel free to e-mail me.

Well that turns out not to be so important, it is how you look in
*photographs* that is important !

I once met a girl who, when you met her, was pleasant looking, but
nothing you would notice in a crowd.   Then she told me she was a
model, and showed me some pictures of her from a TV commercial she was
in - you could hardly tell it was the same person - she was just
stunning in the pictures....

SO, first step - get some photographs taken by a *professional*
photographer of *models* - my personal feeling is that the better the
photographer, the more likely you are to get a call from the agencies,
when they see your photographs.

I don't know what gender you are or what sort of modeling you want to
do (some people make large sums doing "hand" modeling, for example),
but probably you will need makeup and hair styling before the shoot -
hopefully the photographer knows the right people for that as well.

THEN, you have to get the right people to look at your photographs,
and unfortunately I don't know much about the right and wrong way to
go about that....

And, I also don't really know how find the right photographer, except
that if one were absolutely desperate to be a model, one would look up
the names of the most often named photographers in magazines like
Vogue, and then beg for an appointment, while being prepared to spend
huge sums out of your savings for the astronomical hourly rate....


Cheers,

Ken                         <*>

Duuuuh. How in hell can you both support objectivism and be a
"christian"? I know you are cause you've barraged us with a bunch of
wanky christian-mystical mumbo jumbo in the past -- talk of satan being
present at raves, and your recent spew referring to armageddon (re:
countdown in 5).  Sounds like you're basically full of crap, grasping
at straws for your half-thought out half-witted half-brained
life-philosophy. It's hard to be objective when your philosophical
foundations are built on quicksand.

If you happen to capture god, please chain him/her for a while, send me
some e-mail where you have him/her residing, so I can see him/her for 
myself. Isn't that an objectivist answer? And no, I am not going to
take whatever hallucinogenic drugs you're taking in order to see god.

> Guilt is the only weapon of looters.  And that is wearing thin.

I'm post-neo-reconstructionist-Jewish. Yes, I feel guilty about taking
two pennies out of the "take one leave one" change cup at the mini-mart
the other day. Oy, do I feel guilty! I must be a looter.  Oy. Are you
always this much of a smeghead?

So let me guess -- you're the type of Christian that walks past the
beggar and says "get a job!" right? I guess you'd be against Jesus'
material generosity to the poor, the infirm, and outcast? What of the
parables of fishes and loaves?

What the hell are you talking about? Did i ever say anything against 
personal/individual resposibility. No. I just said that Ayn Rand is
full of shit, cuz her philosophy doesn't take into account anybody
other than the manager/capitalist/business-class and doesn't really
give a shit about the worker/slave/natural-resources which the  "rugged
individualist" abused in their greed-centric rise to power. It's a
bunch of classist bullshit that close-minded idiots like yourself can
pave over with christian lies about love so you can  feel all cosy
about being a greedy, narrow-minded asshole. You do this even though
Ayn Rand nothing to do with Christianity. Jesus would roll over in his
grave if he was even vaguely associated with Ayn Rand. If he ever
existed, he'd be spinnin, cuz there are fools like you around twisting
his words so you all can justify the rape of the earth, abuse of
people, and the racist warmongering hateful legacy that IS
christianity. You are truly pathetic trying to integrate Rand's
greed-based philosophy with Jesus' anti-greed philosophy.

The lack of individual responsibility lies with those that believe in
popular "Christian" ideals -- you can conveniently be the biggest
con-artist, thief, liar, child abusing, hatemongering asshole around...
But if you give enough money to the church, confess, or make a really
good pie for the church bake-sale, you can horsetrade your sins away
(god must have a very good accountant) -- it just takes money, lots of
it... and you make that money by hard work, by fucking other people
over (that's where Ayn Rand comes in). It's a vicious cycle.
Forgiveness is not that easy in some other religions -- you actually
are called upon to do a good deed now and then if you expect to be
relieved of the GUILT of your sins and human failings against others. 
Christianity seems to have forgotten the concept of mitzvah -- the good
deed freely chosen -- and replaced it with a petty, consumerist
buy-yer-salvation-for-a-dollar-and-a-prayer bullshit. Thus, the moral
bankrupcy of most Christians. (the only christians I've ever met that I
respect and are good upstanding people are the ones that live the life
that Jesus proscribed, with generosity and no idle spew about "love",
they have no need to proseltyze because they shine goodness in their
own right. They "just do it." Such christianity is very unfashionable,
unfortunately, nowadays, as Christianity is all about
fashion/appearances used as a veneer to hide a fundamental
philosophical bankrupcy and a fascist-tending, racist, homophobic,
hatemongering, classist credo). Welcome to the Fourth Reich.

soup with a fork? what if it's a nice chunky minestrone?
        There are other good turntables out there, like, 1. Vestax makes an
insane digital turntable with + or - 50% pitch control, reverse playing of
records, and all sorts of other crazy shit.  The only problem here is, if
you do a gig and they have 1200's, you're screwed cause most DJ turntables
have a pitch control of only 10 or 15%. I wouldnt mind having a setup w/ the
Vestax turntables just for studio use.  
        Dont get me wrong, 1200's are the shit, especially when there are 3
of em hooked up to a nice vintage bozak or yuri mixer and huge 8"x10" analog
VU meters! :)

Niels,

You're an angry, dark, hateful individual who has little to offer here
except foul words and personal attacks on character.  You do not understand
me in any way, nor the things I write.  My countdown posts ARE NOT about
Armageddon, they are about a trip I am getting ready to take back to home to
San Francisco.  You did not desire to discover this, you only desired to
twist my words and use them for your own dark pleasures.  Other post I have
written here have been similarly twisted by you and your kind. 

My posts about objectivism speak for themselves and my references to taking
spirituality one step futher with an objectivists view have NOTHING to do
with following blindly Ayn Rand's entire philosophy.  This view is for more
positive thinkers, however.  And your response is something I have come to
expect. You see only negativity.  You spew it out like a river.    

If trashing and ranting and raving makes you feel good, then so be it.  But
in reality, your words are no skin off my back.  I will continue to post and
do as I please here.  It's still my right.  I will continue sorting through
the dark, immature crap on this list to find words from courageous and
beautiful individuals who can still thankfull be found here.

******************************************************************
           Proposition 215

            Medical Marijuana Initiative

           Section 1. Section 11362.5 is added to the
           Health and Safety Code, to read: 

           11362.5. (a) This section shall be known and
           may be cited as the Compassionate Use Act of
           1996.

           (b) (l) The people of the State of California
           hereby find and declare that the purposes of
           the Compassionate Use Act of 1996 are as
           follows: 

           (A) To ensure that seriously ill Californians
           have the right to obtain and use marijuana for
           medical purposes where that medical use is
           deemed appropriate and has been
           recommended by a physician who has
           determined that the person's health would
           benefit from the use of marijuana in the
           treatment of cancer, anorexia, AIDS, chronic
           pain, spasticity, glaucoma, arthritis, migraine,
           or any other illness for which marijuana
           provides relief. 

           (B) To ensure that patients and their primary
           caregivers who obtain and use marijuana for
           medical purposes upon the recommendation of
           a physician are not subject to criminal
           prosecution or sanction. 

           (C) To encourage the federal and state
           governments to implement a plan to provide
           for the safe and affordable distribution of
           marijuana to all patients in medical need of
           marijuana. 

           (2) Nothing in this act shall be construed to
           supersede legislation prohibiting persons from
           engaging in conduct that endangers others, nor
           to condone the diversion of marijuana for
           nonmedical purposes. 

           (c) Notwithstanding any other provision of
           law, no physician in this state shall be
           punished, or denied any right or privilege, for
           having recommended marijuana to a patient
           for medical purposes. 

           (d) Section 11357, relating to the possession of
           marijuana, and Section 11358, relating to the
           cultivation of marijuana, shall not apply to a
           patient, or to a patient's primary caregiver,
           who possesses or cultivates marijuana for the
           personal medical purposes of the patient upon
           the written or oral recommendation or
           approval of a physician. 

           (e) For the purposes of this section, "primary
           caregiver" means the individual designated by
           the person exempted under this act who has
           consistently assumed responsibility for the
           housing, health, or safety of that person. 

           Sec. 2. If any provision of this measure or the
           application thereof to any person or
           circumstance is held invalid, that invalidity
           shall not affect other provisions or applications
           of the measure which can be given effect
           without the invalid provision or application,
           and to this end the provisions of this measure
           are severable.

I think i'm going to make a big sign to hang around my neck so that y'all
will be able to who I am. 
"I'm hughdhyana from the list!!!"

I'm hoping to make it to the full-moon beach thing this weekend on the 27th.
Unfortunately, my roommate and I are really burnt out on driving to far off
places because of all of the driving we've been doing in order to get settled
up here. So,  that's been keeping us home more than we're used to. Someday.
we'll have jobs, cash. and the energy to share W/ all of you beeyutifulll
individuals!

Hello,

I'm curious about conversations that go on at raves.

So, I'm interested in people's opinions on three aspects:

- What sort of subjects do you usually discuss in conversations at
raves?

- How often do you converse at raves with people whom you do not know
at all ?   By the way, by a conversation, I mean something longer than
"Can I have some of your water?" "Sure" "Thanks!" :-)   And, do your
conversations with people whom you don't know tend to stick to certain
topics?

- Lastly, how do you manage to communicate while the speakers are
blasting at 120db ?  :-)


Thanks,

Ken                       <*>

Well, if i do start getting into a conversation with someone in FRONT of 
the speakers, usually both of us will eventually wander off and find a 
place to keep talking.  :)

Where to find the clothes you have on, what you do for a living, what's 
the last awesome party you were at, comparing sugared breakfast cereals, 
what sort of music you really WISH they would play, who do you know here, 
have you seen this particular dj before? he's rad!, computers, how your 
parents would react if they just walked in here, various drug stories, 
analysing the visuals ... just a few of the convos i can actually 
remember!

You know, there are many people in the country today who, through no
fault of their own, are sane.  Some of them were born sane.  Some of
them became sane later in their lives.  It is up to people like you
and me who are out of our tiny little minds to try and help these
people overcome their sanity.

Good evening everybody :)  Just wondering if any wonderful people out there
can help me with something.  I need to find a good quote for something at

Here's a funny one.  I actually lived this way for a while before I 
slowed down enough to realize how dumb it was.  :p

Hey all you lovely lovey people!

Well... I just got back from the free outdoor San Jose charity party.
Whoa!  I was really really impressed!  I showed up way too early (from the
city via CalTrain, no less!) - just before noon.  Any outdoor party is
bound to be plagued by minor details that cause it to be late - I should
know that by now... but I got to spend up until 2 or so just hanging out
with some really really fun and friendly people, 'till they got the sound
running.

This was also my first trip into "downtown" San Jose.  I was not
impressed, though I was taken to see some pretty fun fountains & stuff.  I
just kept wondering where all the big buildings and honking cars were ;)

Anyway!  Once all the little things no one ever thinks about had been
sorted out, the music started up... it was heaven.  The sound system was
just someone's big ol' car stereo, which was loud enough for the crowd
(which was, I would say, about 35 people, plus another dozen or so who
drifted through & didn't stick around long.)  The music was a bit on the
slow side for my tastes, but very funky, and kept us all grooving.

But there was just something really magical about the whole day.  It was
really lovely out, without being too hot.  A number of people were
introduced to the music in this way - I hope to see them at the "real"
Charity party in a couple of weeks!  And we were apparently protected from
police by a mysterious force - they drove by a few times, but as of the
time of my departure, there were no complaints.

It would have been nice if more people had made it out for this little
thing!  It was a total blast!

I think I may even have been shamed into remembering peoples' names!  (I
was teased mercilessly for forgetting peoples' names within seconds of
being told them for the 8th time...)

What can I say.  I've made my plans for October 4th already!  Take care,
hope everyone had a great weekend!

I tried to find it but I couldn't!! We were at the park with the 
fountains shooting out of the ground, but there was no party!! :( We 
walked up and down Market st, up and down San Carlos, but no party. :( 
We were there around 2-3pm. We got discouraged and chased away by the 
SOFA fair people, so we left and drove all the way to Sunset... (Arg) 
Oh well, I am glad you found it. Rick and the rest of that crew are 
really fucking cool!! Take Care and I will see you on the 4th!!! 

Peace,

Greg :)

Sorry for the bandwidth, but I thought someone might be able to use this:

I picked up an unused radius video processor/editor/tv interface (nubus) at a
garage sale for next to nothing, it's 3 years old, the receipt is for $1700.
 It doesn't seem to be Power PC compat though. So:

If you've got a non PPC mac, have I got a deal for you! (as in REAL cheap)
or
If you have an older beater mac sitting around (II, LC, centris, quadra, etc)
I might be interested in purchasing it.

Also, the guy threw in a 44mb syquest (w'disks) internal for Mac, anyone got
a use for this?

Call if you're interested: 510 528 1612

my favorite quote for today was "...all persons that reach adulthood in
the world today are programmed biocomputers..." john lilly

my personal favorite quote is "think without words" (im still working on
it!)

oh yeah..another`` I know that most men, including those at ease
with problems of the greatest complexity, can seldom accept
even the simplest and most obvious truth if it be such as would
oblige them to admit the falsity of conclusions they reached
perhaps with great difficulty, conclusions which they have
delighted in explaining to colleagues, which they have proudly
taught to others, and which they have woven, thread by thread,
into the fabric of their lives.''

           Leo Tolstoy.

My girlfriend is a model at Ford (Paris) and used to be at Elite (Zurich,
Milan, Paris).

She went to several minor agencies that refused her, but Ford made her
start the very next day !

Obviously, the shape and the looks are powerful assets in that field, but
that's not it:
You have to know how to "do the catwalk" (as she says). It interests model
agencies to hire people who already have a little experience in the job.
Besides, you need to be highly motivated and not let any comments bring you
down because someone might find in you the beauty that someone else
wouldn't see and vice versa.
It is good to take pictures with someone you know very well and who
believes in you, but that person needs to be a professional photographer,
not someone who would take them with a disposable camera...

Go for the main agencies first, don't underestimate yourself...



Good luck,


Topher.

Sunset of course was great! Seen alot of people I haven't seen for awhile(
Amy, and Melanie) to name a few. It was funny seeing the punk rock band
there. Wasn't a bad or good thing, just different. Did anyone check them
out and how did they like it? I wonder if that's going to be a regular
thing for them. Anyway back to work for at least another hour. I'm going
home early.

Already waiting for next weekend, since I didn't do much this weekend.

I think they go something like:

Person 1:*BOOM* "Hi!" *BOOM *BOOM*

Person 2:"What?" *BOOM* *BOOM*

Person 1:*BOOM* "HI!" *BOOM* *BOOM*

Person 2:"Yes, I like *BOOM blowpops too." *BOOM*

Person 1: *BOOM* "HUH?"

Person 2: *BOOM* "Ok, talk *BOOM* to you *BOOM* later!"

Does anyone know of a source of information about singles being released
constantly with cool remixes on them?  Although a review would be nice, I just
want to know when some of my favorite artists are doing remixes of other 
people.
Any ideas?

        Is it me or are Sunsets getting better and better?  Last 2 just
seemed the best ones of the year.  I also thought it was great that the
punk band was there, because the location was moved a little bit :).  It
felt like a totally new place.

        Thanks to all who were there and made it fun.  Have a good week and
I might see you guys at that benefit party on Thursday (I really want to
see DRC).

Hugz,

That is a really mean thing to say.  THis is obviously something this
person is interested in.  Just because you are not, doesn't make it
stupid.  I'd feel so bad if I posted something and somebody said "How
stupid."  Attitudes like that make it difficult for others to post, now
maybe that's the stupid thing.

There's a music shop in S.F. called BPM which is where a lot of the local
DJ's get their singles and albumes to mix.  Not a constant source of
information, but a constant source of supply.

Subject:  Space Children Review
Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk


Although I went to Space Children on Saturday exhausted and sober
(always a pleasing combination for raving) I ended up having one of
the best times I've had a party in a long time!  As soon as I walked
into the space (at 9th 'n' Howard...looked like an old bar) I felt
happy (although still tired) right away!

The party was great!  Detroit house really made my night and despite
the presence of a circle, the vibe was REALLY friendly!  In fact,
after I had taken a little nap on the couch (ah, those rave naps
where you think you're sleeping but you really can't tell because the
music is so loud) me and my new friend Mariam decided to take it upon
ourselves to show the breakers how it was done by two short
gruvers...and to our suprise, the BOYZ were totally down with it!  We
expected the circle to break up and get pissed, but instead we got
smiles and compliments!  DAMN!

I really liked how the room was set up...4 corner sound and instead
of making it a long skinny dance space it was short and wide, with
the dj in the middle.  Really cool!  I was unhappy with the slippery
floor, and the ceiling upstairs was dripping, and there was no toilet
paper in either bathroom (ew, I guess that's what cotton undies are
for, PUKE!) but still it was a great party!

An interesting story:  I had brought my mickey mouse gloves that I
just mail ordered from Disney world (thanks again to rlunatic for the
inspiration!:) and as I was getting ready to go, I noticed a guy
holding some suspiciously familiar looking white mickey gloves and
unzipping his backpack.  I sat back and watched him look left, look
right, open his backpack and start to put them in!  So, I saunter up
and say "Hey.  Are those mine?"  And he had the balls to try to feed
me a line about how he'd gotten them from some girl upstairs and did
I know her and he thought they were his other friends and did I know
him and bla bla bla.  I was just like "Listen.  You're trying to gank
my gloves.  Be quiet."  It was kind of funny actually, although I
probably wouldn't have thought so had I not caught him.  It's hard to
hide huge puffy white gloves when there's blacklights EVERYWHERE
(which were very cool by the way, I was glad I was dressed in all
white.)

Summary?  Best vibe at a party like that (Detroit music, breakers,
lots of adidas) I've felt in a long time!  For some reason hard music
and styley clothes always seem to = bad vibe (um, from what I've
heard 5 would be a good example).  NOT SO AT THIS PARTY! :) :)   I
was tired and sober but the vibe gave me second and third winds to
last me until 5am! :)

Yesterday was one of the two days of the year where there are exactly 12
hrs of daylight and 12 hrs of night.  A build up to over the last 3 months.
Mebbe there's a connection?  I dunno... :)

Went to hear some Detroit at Auto, which was in the Stevenson Alley space,
near 3rd street.

I like events that pull some out-of-town talent becuase you get a slightly
different scene.  One thing I noticed about Auto was that the crowd was
more diverse.  I like that.  It kinda reminded me of LA.

The soundsystem was setup downstairs, and it pumped nicely.  Lighting was
all via computer monitors laying everywhere.  The music was pretty good.
It is always good to hear some new music in this town.  Jon Santos spun
a pretty hard set.  Around 1 the music got a bit more groovier.  Around 3
Claude Young spun and went off.  A small crowd formed around the
DJ table as CY put on a show.  Some reports indicate he was cross-fading
with his teeth, but these are unconfirmed :)  Lotsa fun, nontheless.

No music in the upstairs chill room, but the muffled sounds from below
were really enough.  Videos of tornados, slides of trains.  Easy to
have conversation.

My roomate and I are looking for a place.  If anyone else is looking for a
room or if anyone knows of some rooms opening up or a house, let me know.

Right now its just my roomate and I that are looking.  But if anyone else is
interested, we could join forces and then we might be able to find a bigger
place.  I like options.

Usually if I meet someone who seems "interesting", I'll talk about the
usual small-talky stuff, like jobs, college, etc. I find that many
people I meet are also in the computer industry, which leads to good
conversation.

Also, it's not unusual for a party to turn into a big business-card
swapping networking fest ("Hey, I need a webmaster for my startup"
"Does anyone know of an open networking job" etc.)

All the time! One of the best conversations I've ever had with a
stranger was when I met Marcy in the bathroom line at Hug O' War :)

Find a nice, quiet corner. It can get frustrating to talk to someone
that you can't hear, and sometimes the best thing to do (in absence of
a good chill area) is to swap phone numbers or to go hang out
somewhere after the party (I recommend Sparky's on Church near Market,
open 24 hrs).

     I learned how to spin on 2 Technics slbd22k's and a radio shack mixer. 
      Total of about 350 dollars, it was a great low budget way of 
     learning.  I think I have seen some of those Technics 1200 
     look-alikes...it's kind of like buying imitation Airwalks or Doc 
     Martin's.  I was really satisified with the 22's, but I wouldnnt want 
     to go back.

...Brothers and Sisters..let me testify on this one!!!  I bought a set of 
technics "clones" thinking I would learn on starter tables..and then 
graduate to technics after I was "worthy."....of playing on 
technics....Wrong.  I now consider the eight months I had the clone 
turntables a complete waste of time and money...and very frustrating..if not 
detrimetal to learning how to spin....
     
Dj-ing and Technics turntables are about the precise arrangement of sound in 
time. What you are paying for with the Technics is a precise tool for 
controlling the speed of sound...Without Technics 1200's..dj-ing is like 
trying to eat soup with a fork.......End of story.

Hey,

SF Ravers will be meeting for food, fun and fellowship tonight in SoMa,

(begged?) to attend this week's dinner.  I think our focus tonight
should about the many SF Ravers that all have birthdays this month.  We
can have them discuss the circumstances around their birth:  Were you an
Xmass gift from your mom to your dad?  Or perhaps you came from a moment
of unbridled passion on New Years Eve?  Well, tell us about it; but
leave the video tapes at home, were eating dinner for gosh sakes.

At 8:30pm meet us at Wa-Ha-Ka (Mexican cuisine)                 
Telephone:   (415) 861-1410
at 1489 Folsom Street (at 11th), San Francisco

**A map for the area can be found at http://www.lycos.com/roadmap.html**

Wa-Ha-Ka is a lively Mexican grill specializing in fresh and tasty
burritos, quesadillas and margaritas in a spirited and colorful SoMa
setting. Prices:   Inexpensive, entrees under $7 (Yes!)
Tell them you are in the SF Raves Group.

Directions from the East Bay:
Use the 9th Street/Civic Center Exit: (it puts you on Harrison.)  Go up
one block and turn right onto 11th.

Directions from the South Bay:
Use the 9th Street/Civic Center Exit: it puts you on 9th Street.  Turn
left onto Harrison.  Go up one block and turn right onto 11th.

Definition: Wa-Ha-Ka is the sensation you get when you've found the
bomb.

Hello,
     
I'm curious about conversations that go on at raves.
     
So, I'm interested in people's opinions on three aspects:
     
- What sort of subjects do you usually discuss in conversations at 
raves?
     
- How often do you converse at raves with people whom you do not know 
at all ?   By the way, by a conversation, I mean something longer than 
"Can I have some of your water?" "Sure" "Thanks!" :-)   And, do your 
conversations with people whom you don't know tend to stick to certain 
topics?
     
- Lastly, how do you manage to communicate while the speakers are 
blasting at 120db ?  :-)
     
     
Thanks,

     I learned how to spin on 2 Technics slbd22k's and a radio shack mixer. 
     Total of about 350 dollars, it was a great low budget way of 
     learning.  I think I have seen some of those Technics 1200 
     look-alikes...it's kind of like buying imitation Airwalks or Doc 
     Martin's.  I was really satisified with the 22's, but I wouldnnt want 
     to go back.

     I suppose after consultation with my spiritual guide that I understand 
     that some people might want to figure out what people talk about at 
     raves.  Therefore, I shall attempt to make a logical attempt at 
     remembering what I talk about at raves.  Most of the time I don't talk 
     about anything, since I enjoy listening to the music and dancing much 
     more.  However, that does not mean I will not listen to what people 
     want to talk about.  It is frustrating though to stay grounded on the 
     planet sometimes, since I was meant to be born on a starship...

     Happy One Year Space Children...
     
     1. Thought there might be a second system... there was ... well, maybe 
     we needed DJ's... oh we had those too... so... wa'happend?
     
     2. It's always when you have friends in town that an out of town theme 
     takes over the city.  This weekend, 'Detroit'.
     
     3. Had a great birthday.  I don't feel older, and my next auto 
     insurance payment will be half of what I've been paying.
     
     4. Thank you Jay.
     
     5. Hadn't given Detroit enough of a chance I guess... Juan Atkins was 
     rock f#^@n solid for the first two hours, and had me floored.  Scary 
     primitive techno with tons of secondary shit going on.  Yummy munchy 
     303, tons of gran'ky futuristic noises.  Sometimes going out and 
     learning towards electro, with some near disco funk and hard house to 
     boot.  Wow.
     
     6. Cesar is damn cool.
     
     7. Big ugly brown vinyl couches are the best.  Zzzzzzz
     
     8. I've never seen one green laser work so hard in my life.  It really 
     looked good.  The scrim/gauze was a really spiffy idea.
     
     9. My two friends from LA were blown away by our highly social vibe.  
     Thanks all for showing them what we're about.
     
     10.Sweat.
     
     11.Met Wayne, bought SFR button, owned it for about five minutes, got 
     compliment, gave it away.  Uh, Wayne?
     
     12.Kept meeting Brits... could it be a sign?  Airfare is getting 
     cheaper.  Have vacation time coming.
     
     13.Lotsa people overdoing it.
     
     14.A lot of knowing smiles being transmitted and received  Glad to be 
     on the same frequency.
     
     15.Those of you who helped keep me from getting sick by making me stop 
     dancing, like four times (was it really hot in there or what?)
     
     16.So many fly people.
     
     17.Massives tend to suck.  It was so nice seeing just 200 people 
     sweating, laughing, talking, kissing, and dancing.
     
     18.$2.00 water (the little ones) in a hundred degree room... sounds 
     like a Microsoft tactic.
     
     19.Sink on the floor... nice touch.  Disappeared later however.
     
     20.Black light illuminated beautiful people all night long.
     
     21.Giving skull massages to bald people.  Too fun.
     
     22.Ripped plaid shorts are fun to dance in, but no fun to look at.  
     Sorry all for the visual trauma.
     
     23.1...... 2...... 3....... 4....... 5....... 6..... 7.. 8... 9... 10  
     KRRKRKRKRKRRRRRRRKRKRKRKRRRRRrrrrrrrrr........
     
     24.Gooooooooooool! (oh, wait, that was later Sunday)
     
     25.And don't say people don't appreciate the little touches.  The day 
     glo zip ties on the lighting and wiring made the party (Furrreal!)

OOPS, 

Amendment to the directions for the folks coming from the South Bay. 
Very minor mistake if I do say so myself, but I would be SHATTERED if my
errant directions caused some wonderful raver friend to not be able to
find us.

Directions from the South Bay:
Use the 9th Street/Civic Center Exit: it puts you on 9th Street.  Turn
left onto Harrison.  Go up TWO blocks and turn right onto 11th. Wa Ha Ka

Be there or be talked about!

   Subject:  Re: Having conversations at raves -Reply

My most favorite conversation at a rave?  Since I really really like
dancing and take it reletively seriously (as seriously as you can
take such things...) it is very important to me that people who's
dancing I find inspiring be informed of their phenominal qualities. 
So, I frequently find myself trying to gently interupt people who are
gruving their asses off (or wait until they slow down for a second)
and saying "I LOVE THE WAY YOU DANCE!  YOU REALLY INSPIRE ME!!"  So,
since people who dance well usually take pride in their movement, we
usually talk about dancing...how good it feels, different styles,
appreciation, drugged vs. non-drugged, sore muscles, etc.  I am
always sad when someone who is an awesome dancer is just like
"uhyeahthanksbye."  And the most wonderful conversation (one of which
I had at Space Children) is when I stop someone to compliment them on
their dancing and they say "Thanks!  I was noticing YOUR dancing
too!"  That's the best.  Mutual appreciation.

ok, I'll stop now.

Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com

Friday night started off right! My original plan to head to Five was
(thank Bob) thwarted by my wonderful friend Ariel informing me of a
party going on at Acme.

The potential of Acme as a cool space really shined at Buggin' Out;
They were actually *limiting* the number of people they were letting
in, which led to a nice, sparse dance floor with large supplies of
breathable oxygen. 

The upstairs was your standard housy/trancy stuff, and I spent about 1
minute there. Nothing wrong with the music at all, but I was in the
mood for *something* else... Walking down to the basement revealed what
I've been yearning for:

The fucking bomb jungle party was raging in the bowels of the Acme! I
have been desperately searching for a good jungle party for soooo long,
and I finally found it.

Jungle does weird things to me. My body starts moving uncontrollably,
my mouth opens up, my toungue starts flapping around, next thing I
know, it's five hours later, and my body aches. Maybe I should see a
doctor? :)

Saturday was spent apartment hunting and watching my poor Prelude gasp
its final breath of exhaust smoke. Missed Space Children due to being
car-less, but I was able to catch my friend Melody's band play at a
house party, and this was far more entertaining.

I actually(!!!) went to bed early(???) on Saturday night, and woke up
refreshed on Sunday, prepared to rectify my car problems. We missed
the Charity benefit party and were scared off by the SoFa madness
(eek!).

We cruised up to Sunset, which I always end up missing most of, and
after just missing the exit by a few feet (is it legal to back up on
the freeway?), my heart was pumping enough to get moving in the park
:)

I do the same thing because it's always nice to know you are admired.  I
always thought I was the most miserable dancer EVER-no rhythm, nothing.
My first raves, I was pretty self-conscious about dancing.  Somehow, I let
that go, and just moved however the music led me.  It felt wonderful.  One
day, my friend said she was intimidated by me when she first met me
because I looked so confident when I danced and she felt like such a
clutz.  THAT blew me away because I always saw myself as a clutz and I'd
try and go in a corner and dance by myself so no one would see me.  When
she said that, I realized that when I really felt the music, it carried me
away and I danced in my own special way.  I guess it didn't look too
terrible because I got complimented from time to time.  I have to say that
those few compliments were the most wonderful things ever.  Because my
dancing came from my heart and someone else saw how happy it made me,
plus my body seemed to act in a somewhat coordinated manner with my
emotions, a compliment about that was the highest compliment ever!

So, when I see someone dancing their heart out, not
knowing people are watching, and they are truly enjoying themselves, they
look beautiful to me.  I  always compliment people because I enjoy
watching movement from the heart.  It's like seizing the moment and
understanding what
real living is about.  It's something so simple that can bring sheer
happiness.  (my most favorite dancing moments are the wee hours of the
morning where I've been dancing for so long that my body is like rubbber-a
human Gumby.  That's when I can do anything from being so warmed up, but
it takes me hours to reach that point!)

thanks for the lovely thought,
KaySEE

For those of you interested there is an article about P-Trak and other
such services that are available on the internet on the MSNBC web page.
www.msnbc.com
 
It talks about services on the web that look up personal information for
free or for a fee. 
 
Its in the scitech section of the 'paper'.  The actual address for the

Okay okay okay!  This is the last Dinner/MAD BSP you will see! This
amendment lists the MAD location and description. ((C'mon, I am only
trying to be thorough.))  **You have to admit it is also a great
advertising ploy to post the same thing repeatedly.  By now the people
who werent planning on attending will attend anyway as they have read
sooo much about it, and will feel left out if they don't come.**  
(Scary thought: My ploy could backfire and I could die by incineration,
Yikes!)

Hey,

SF Ravers will be meeting for food, fun and fellowship tonight in SoMa,
(see below for info & map.)  Anyone and everyone is invited, encouraged,
(begged?) to attend this week's dinner.  I think our focus tonight
should about the many SF Ravers that all have birthdays this month.  We
can have them discuss the circumstances around their birth:  Were you an
Xmass gift from your mom to your dad?  Or perhaps you came from a moment
of unbridled passion on New Years Eve?  Well, tell us about it; but
leave the video tapes at home, were eating dinner for gosh sakes. 
Afterwards, some of us go to MAD.(info below)

At 8:30pm meet us at Wa-Ha-Ka (Mexican cuisine)                 
Telephone:   (415) 861-1410
at 1489 Folsom Street (at 11th), San Francisco

**A map for the area can be found at http://www.lycos.com/roadmap.html**

Wa-Ha-Ka is a lively Mexican grill specializing in fresh and tasty
burritos, quesadillas and margaritas in a spirited and colorful SoMa
setting. Prices:   Inexpensive, entrees under $7 (Yes!)
Tell them you are in the SF Raves Group.

Directions from the East Bay:
Use the 9th Street/Civic Center Exit: (it puts you on Harrison.)  Go up
one block and turn right onto 11th.

Directions from the South Bay:
Use the 9th Street/Civic Center Exit: it puts you on 9th Street.  Turn
left onto Harrison.  Go up two blocks and turn right onto 11th.

MAD - trance, electro, old school, minimal, hard, detroit, acid
   w/DJs Joe Rice, Jon Santos, Alex, Ethan, guests. 2$ before 11pm
   10pm-2am, 18+, $3. Bahia Cabana, 1600 Market St, SF.
<<No directions.  Look it up, Lazy!>>

Definition: Wa-Ha-Ka is the sensation you get when you've found the
bomb.

ps  RSVPs are appreciated for a rough idea of our table size and
location.

but you gotta understand that! ...for me when I get to go out and dance
all night (which is not a lot lately :-( ) I want to dance my ass off as
much as possibe, sometimes it can take some time to find that groove and
if it gets interupted can be hard to find again...and sometimes the groove
is just there all the time the whole night...I find it hard to have too
much conversation at a party...too loud, and Im usually dancing so much
that I really dont meet anyone except for that occasional hey man...have
some water!! I love that!!!
Im glad to hear that other people feel the same way, I usually feel so
anti-social.... bye, have a nice day y'all

Reading Ariel's letter reminded me of what I think is the best question
that anyone can ask you at a rave:

"Hey man, why did you stop dancing??"

When strangers have asked me that I feel good as fuck all night long.

Yeah, when you say things like "I don't mean to criticise, but that was
really stooopid" to someone, people just have this nagging tendancy to
gang up on you. Weird, huh?

I know this has probably come up mucho times, but why do most people dislike
circle dancing?

Personally I think it they are fun to watch and don't mind them too much,
unless they get too big, then they kinda suck.

Anyways, let me know what you think...

P.S.  I saw that 2 other people were on this list from U.C. Davis.  If you
see this, let me know who YOU are.  Thanks ;)

        Trip-Hop, Trance-Hall, Dub and ragga-muffin styles were all in effect
        with the typical bizzare nature of the caribbian zone, not a bad place

A few reasons:

1. It can totally disrupt the dance floor. They(circle dancers) tend to
   take up a lot of space, and if a crowd gathers, there is that much less
   space for those that want to shake their groove thing to do so.

2. It becomes a spectator sport rather than having everyone involved in 
   what is going on, and as an intangible really seems to have a
   deleterious effect on the energy of the crowd.

3. It fosters a competitve attitude. Personally, I don't want to compete
   with anyone when I am out making my attempt at what I call dancing....

Just wanted to say ciao for now, I'm leaving in the morning on my cruise
throught the Panama Canal as companion to an 80+ year old woman (who lies
about her age, curiouser and curioser!)... so I'm signing off of SFR for a
couple of weeks.

I'll be missing you all, I know ... but I'll be thinking of you, especially
the night I've deEcided to party alonE out on a deckchair in the
Carribiean, watching the stars closer to the equator than I've ever been..


Please, when you post something you want me to see, cc it to my address
directly, then I'll have mail when i get home!  I'll be back 10/8, and will
see everyone after that!

Oh, and try to tape Leeza on 9/30 at 1pm, just in case my vcr doesn't work
right when the time comes! Think of me climbing a pyramid in the
Guatematelan jungles that day!!!!

Much love and excitement!  Leslie

First off let me tell you it has been the best 1 1/2 years here in the SF
rave scene and I'm sad to say I have to return home. I'm not from this time
period. That's right you heard me correct. I'm from the year 2095, 100
years from now.

I was sent back in time to hopefully make a change in the rave scene. You
see, in the year 2090 all rave music was band. Any type that you would hear
at a rave or similar party was band for reason unknown, or at least it is
keeped secret. If you are caught with and type of that music, you were sent
to a holding cell for 5 years and a 10,000 credit fine, Oh, credits there
are like dollars here,  If you were caught with any type of flyer the was 3
years and 7,500 credit fine. We threw underground parties once a month or
every other month and when I say underground, it was just that. Some of us
dug underground tunnels about 100 feet below the surface and used cement
and made little homes there and places to have parties. However it was
getting so bad that we had to do something. With technology so advance from
my time period, we have determined the time period the rave scene was
influenced and when it started to effect my time period in a negative way.

I was sent here to bring a positive vibe to this scene and to hopefully
influence some people about how great this scene is.  I had to reach 6
individuals that in some way effected our scene in 2095. Touch them in
anyway I could that was positive. My supervisor would contact me when there
was progress. Well that time has come.Two weeks ago I was told that our
monthly party ended up getting busted, but no one was fined or sent to the
holding cell. This has never happened since 2089. Usually the promoters was
sent to the holding cell for life, equipment taken and smashed into nothing
and records melted. Whoever they caught was sent to the holding cell for
the normal 5 years and 10,000 credit fine. Anyway, no one was busted. So
something was changed in 1996 that effected that. My supervisor didn't want
to take a chance and told me to stay until the end of the month. The
security droids that busted the party might have been tampered with or it
is a plan to draw us out more so they can bust more people.

Last night I was contacted again and was told they had 3 other parties 1
underground and 2 in the deserted area in Old San Francisco's warehouse
sector. This was the first ground level parties since 2089. The security
droids came, looked around and said have a good time and keep it under
control. My supervisor has told me my mission was succesful and to come
home, they have looked over all the data from the computers and the time
line has been changed.

So, with everything going good there I must return. To all the people I've
met, I wish you the best. It has been alot of fun. I can't wait to go back
home to tell some of your grandchildren that there grandparent were some of
the greatest people I've known and show them pictures that I've collected.
In 2095, I party with alot of your grandchildren and you will love what
they have done for our scene in 2095, you'd be proud. Maybe I'll get lucky
and visit again in 15 years. That's when I'll be able to time warp again.

Until then, keep the scene alive

Precedence: bulk

The main thing I have against circle dancing is that it is an ego-based
dancing style. I mean yes, it's fun to have people watch you when you're
dancing, and it's fun to trade energy back and forth, but cirlces always
seem to become "HEY CHECK THIS SHIT OUT."  And then, after some
breaks, "HA!  CAN >>YOU<< TOP THAT?!"  Then the next person steps
out and does their funky shit and the ego-masterbation continues.

Funny story:  At a Frankie Bones party in Seattle a few months ago, a
circle got formed and all of a sudden the record SCREACHES to a halt
and Frankie starts screaming "YO SEATTLE!  This ain't muthafuckin' 1983!
 It's 1996, muthafuckers, so FUCK THE BREAKDANCING SHIT."  I have
never laughed so hard as when I watched the geared-out breakpimps
slink their way off the floor with their tails between their legs.

I would agree that they are fun to watch though at times, although the
people in circles always seem to take their shit very serious.  There's
very little fun in circle dancing, most of the time...

Someone asked me at the Charity outdoor thingy on Sunday if I'd be at the
Thursday night eclipse/full moon/harvest moon party - I didn't bother
getting any info, because normally my work schedule prevents me from doing
anything on weeknights.  I've since decided that I might just go despite
work... :)

So, if anyone has any information on the where/when/how/who etc. of this
party, I'd much appreciate it.

Thanks in advance!

Speaking of Seattle, I was there for Christmas at a party, and this
guy did a 2 minute glow-stick circle performance that was pretty cool.
After he did his litle show, he just stepped aside and the circle
filled in again.  No ego, just a cool, brief performance.

And those Seattle kids, they have so much energy!  (And such great
green!)

and i'm sure many are stupid,(to other people) but they don't criticize, they
just answer, or say nothing at all, SO I made my ONE mistake and Uh SFRAVERS

Someone asked me at the Charity outdoor thingy on Sunday if I'd be at the 
Thursday night eclipse/full moon/harvest moon party - I didn't bother 
getting any info, because normally my work schedule prevents me from doing 
anything on weeknights.  I've since decided that I might just go despite 
work... :)
     
So, if anyone has any information on the where/when/how/who etc. of this 
party, I'd much appreciate it.

David Lowe asked about a Thursday night eclipse/full moon/harvest moon party.

I haven't heard about this either, unless he is thinking of the Benifit for
SF Food Not Bombs with DRC, Mars, Mystr-e, and Tomcat. 

In any case, this party is at El Rio, 3158 Mission near Ceasar Chavez.  It
starts at nine, ends at two.  There will be free vegitarian food included
with door price ($5, sliding scale; no one turned away for lack of funds).
Should be tremendous.  What better way to celebrate the harvest than to
dance for food!

Peace,
Kerry

Hey,

I occasionally appreciate circle dancing, especially among a group of
dancers that have been dancing next to each other all night.  I like the
mutual encouragement that happens between the circle and the person in
the middle.  When I dance sober I draw a lot of energy and inspiration
from the dancers around me.  (I don't feel really confident about my
dancing. I don't have any 'moves'.  If you ever see me on the floor, you
know I am there because my urge to move is greater than my shyness.)  I
am mostly trying to find a way for my body to express what I am feeling
about the music.  While I am out there I notice others going through
similar forms of thought, and it is really great when a fellow dancer
starts really "figurin' it out" on the floor.  (You know, the point that
your body and mind are working together in a way that makes you
personally pleased with yourself.)  Dancing makes you feel good about
yourself, might as well show it.  I never read anything negative into
the cocky arrogance displayed by the person in the middle.   The
competitiveness that I have seen always seems to be in the spirit of
fun.  Circle dancing is pretty neat-o by me.

Dance on,
D.

Circle dancing reminds me of where am I and what I'm doing. It causes
me to stop and watch some else dance because my attention has been
distracted. Dancing can be a meditative state, and watching someone
else showing their stuff can make me become self-aware of what I'm
doing. Although sometimes I'm thankful because it reminds me to rest
and get water.

Also, it means less roomon the dance floor for everyone else.

...And the award for best rave-related beverage of the year goes to:

(drumroll)

"Orbitz"

Yep, it is the beverage that looks like a lava lamp.  The Orbitz design
on the clear bottle is very cool.  The typesetting looks like it was
done by the Designer's Republic.  And yes, those floating gelatin balls
never settle at the top or bottom, they remain suspended indefinately.

The taste?  Well, it cost 1.50, and it just looks too damn cool to drink.

get yours today!

www.orbitz.com is fun too.

ps:  "Pinapple Banana Coconut Cherry" flavor does not glow in blacklight,
do any other flavors?

It tastes, uh, less than astounding. The little bits have a slimy
consistency that's a bit hard to get used to.

I emailed the makers (Clearly Canadian) when a friend brought a bottle back
from Boston where they were test marketing it and they ent me 4 bottles for
free along with posters and stickers! I made the mistake of opening one to
drink it, but Troy's right - it's a lot better to look at.

Well, i almost made it to Wa Ha Ka last night, along with a Kiwi (as in
NZer :) friend, but having a car smash (11th & Folsom) stuffed up those
plans completely.

Waaaaaaaaaah!

I'm now bruised and grumpy and not looking forward to all the upcoming
hassles with insurance and stuff.

And we didn't make it to Mad last night either. :(

My S.O thinks circle dancing is pretentious so I always feel a little 
guilted but sometimes I like to dance in circles as of late. It really 
depends on the particular circle though, whether or not I want to join 
it. Some circles are very supportive and enthusiastic, and are a way for 
you to absolutely break loose that dancing alone may not always inspire; 
others are carriers of dread territorialism tripped out immaturity. Big 
circles I agree do Suck! 
I think some people take it way seriously because it can be such an 
intense, concentrated form of communication.If you notice gestures, the 
most minute movement can convey so much. Dancing -with- other people is 
interesting, -showing- people your story through dance is powerful indeed.

ANNOUNCING A UNIQUE ART EXPOSITION DEDICATED
TO THE LIMITLESS POSSIBILITIES OF THE PROJECTED IMAGE...

PROJEXPO '96

=46RIDAY, SEPTEMBER 27, 8:30 PM - ?,
at THE JEWELRY STORE, 2519 MISSION ST. IN S.F.

Nineteen Bay Area artists present an eclectic range of video, film,
slides, sculptures, installations, and performances as part of PROJEXPO
'96, Friday, September 27, 8:30 p.m., at The Jewelry Store, 2519
Mission Street in San Francisco. Part media technology exposition, part
experimental laboratory, and in all ways a multimedia "happening,"
PROJEXPO is dedicated to decidedly non-conventional approaches to the
presentation and context of the projected image in contemporary art and
entertainment. Produced by San Francisco's queer media arts group
Please Louise Productions, PROJEXPO will transform the studios,
performance stages, and lounges of The Jewelry Store into a sprawling
high-stim audio/visual landscape, created out of the visions of
accomplished media artists and professionals who are seeking to expand
their craft beyond the confines of traditional two-dimensional
presentation into a more fully immersive experience. Representative
works include filmmaker Jon Bush's Multiple Projector Montage using
custom screens, four Super-8 film projectors, and mirrors;
multidisciplinary artist Michael Dates' sculptural installation Milk
Porn, composed of a distressed pornographic film imulsion loop
projected on a vibrating pool of milk; an installation/performance by
Mark Ewert and Daniel Hinojo-Baca incorporating live video feeds
entitled Two Mimes in a Live Painting;  a multiple-monitor installation
featuring the signature queer-pop video collages of Museo Contempo; and
a two-hour program of independent film and video works curated by
Jeffrey Winter and Sharon Donahue. At Midnight, PROJEXPO '96 attendees
will be treated to a special  90-minute screening of the finest in
trash, glam, and cult films, hosted by Fred Adler of The Jewelry Store.

PROJEXPO '96 occurs for one special night only, Friday, September 27,
8:30 p.m. (sharp!), at The Jewelry Store, 2519 Mission St., in S.F. A
$5 donation is requested at the door. For more info., please call
Please Louise Productions at (415) 864-5453.

My S.O thinks circle dancing is pretentious so I always feel a little 
guilted but sometimes I like to dance in circles as of late. It really 
depends on the particular circle though, whether or not I want to join 
it. Some circles are very supportive and enthusiastic, and are a way for 
you to absolutely break loose that dancing alone may not always inspire; 
others are carriers of dread territorialism tripped out immaturity. Big 
circles I agree do Suck! 
I think some people take it way seriously because it can be such an 
intense, concentrated form of communication.If you notice gestures, the 
most minute movement can convey so much. Dancing -with- other people is 
interesting, -showing- people your story through dance is powerful indeed.

Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com

Well, I went to this thing on Saturday night in Monterey. It was at the CBS
affiliate news station by the fairgrounds... our hopes were high, and our
minds were open but,

we left early-which is really hard to get me to do.

I'm not sure who the promoters were, although they stopped us on the way out
of the door, (more on that later) but, they were really concerned with
getting something solid established down here, which I respect.

Anyway, the first Dj (He was the main promoter, didn't get a name) spun some
OK stuff, but it just seemed like he was spinning all of his favorites
together. He didn't stick to a format. We heard hardcore, next to house, next
to the trainspotting soundtrack, next to tracks we knew from the Dj Dan CD,
next to house, next to house, next to house, next to house. A real
hodgepodge. Not really the way to create a solid vibe, or a solid
underground. As a result, there were always a number of individuals who were
standing on the perimeter. I tried to trance out and get lost in the music,
which is usually easy for me, but never got there. 

Then they faded out to dead air instead of blending the next Dj in- ACK!
Then, when the next guy started, it was weak and he proceeded to play nothing
but house, which didn't seem to have the masses enthralled. (nor I- what do I
have to do to hear some trance, tribal, breakbeat, trip-hop, even acid jazz
in  the Monterey area?)

xthat was when we left.

On our way out, a co-promoter of the event stopped us, surprised that we
would leave. We had to explain that we weren't used to so much house music
and that we just weren't into it. The guy really made us feel kinda guilty
that we had the nerve to leave, and then asked,"If you heard that this were
going to happen next month, would you come?"   -I didn;t want to say "no" so,
I told him I'd think about it. ;]

The whole experience left me disappointed, and thinking that I may always
have to drive at least an hour and a half to be where I wanna be. Oh, well,
it'll just feel like a Moontribe excursion!

-Hoping to make it to that full moon/beach thing!-

Dolphin and friends are hosting an eclipse party (FREE!!!).  I do not 
have the info # yet, but it is happening on Thursday night.  Apparently, 
there is also supposed to be a comet visible at the same time of the 
eclipse (that's what the promoter told me).  The party is going to be 
somewhere near Valejo.  More info to come.

Unfortunately, so many parties that seem good by what is shown on the 
flyer don't hold up to expectations.  Conversely, there are parties that 
look like they would be *ah'iyt* but actually end up *blowin' up*.  So 
what do we have to go off of to decide what parties are going to be good?

First and foremost should be MUSIC.  What DJ's are playing, what live 
acts?  Remember that an out-of-town DJ does not necessarily mean a good 
DJ.  Although usually, an out of town DJ is good, there are several times 
I have been disappointed.  Also, hearing different DJ's has always been 
exciting to me. Some are good, some I didn't care for.  Some DJ's change 
their styles and abilities over time.  I do get tired of hearing certain 
DJ's too often in a time period.  So, maybe we can't always tell how the 
music is going to be.

Next, take a look at who is throwing the party.  If the last time you 
went to one of their parties, it was *BOOTY!*, there's chance it may be 
like that again.  But, there are some promoters that almost consistently 
throw great parties, but have an occasional bomb.

Now, Moonbounces, Velcro Walls, 80 Zillion watts of toe-tapping bass and 
carnival rides does not a good party make.  No, that would be a good 
carnival, not a good rave.  So, short of calling LaToya Jackson or Jean 
Dixon there is no exact science to knowing how a party will be beforehand 
(Hmmm, have you ever seen those two in the same room together?  *twilight 
zone theme-doo dee doo doo*).  As for rating parties before they happen, 
I don't believe that that could be done in a fair way.

Locations for most of my favorite parties have been undisclosed until 
tickets went on sale.  So, raves cannot be graded on that.  So, that 
pretty much leaves the line up and promoter track record.  But, even 
those are left up to someone's opinion.  Seeing how each person's 
experience at a party is unique, it would be difficult to put a number 
down that represented how the party will be.

Solutions?  I have no freakin' clue!  I still end up at lame parties 
occasionally despite my efforts not to.  A promoter will always pump up 
their own party, so they tend to be a bit biased.  Some DJ's are like 
that to.  The best bet is to ask your friends who have similar tastes to 
you, and trust your instinct.  Usually it is correct, but it can at times 
fail you.  

Vaguely Yours
Dre

P.S.  If you come up with some sort of rave chosing algorythm, please 
send it my way.3

Here's the skinny on the phatty happening near Valejo...
info line : 605-6072

John Howard
Sean Murray
Nickoli
Me

The voicemail number will not have a message on it until the night of the 
party.  Please don't page that #.  I don't think it's a voicemail for 
mailing lists, because this crew is into doing smaller, more intimate 
parties.  Good stuff from the people who brought you Phat Frisco and the 
Valentine's Celebrations.

It's a drive, but their parties are usually worth it.

Subject: Circle Dancing and It's Victims on the Next Geraldo...
Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com

     At least circle jerking promotes involvement.
     
     Circle dancing seems pretty passive (20 people doing nothing, one 
     person jammin their ass off).  I was at a party where only like three 
     people danced in a 12 foot circle all night, and the rest of the place 
     was crowded as fuck.  All that room for what?  Gimme a break.
     
     Go to a party where everybody is dancing their asses off for the love 
     of music ... nobody is showing off, just loving the music enough to 
     commit their bodies to it.  That's fun.  I don't want somebody to stop 
     me and show me how much badder they are.  I'm really not interested.  
     I bet your car is nicer too... maybe your girlfriend has more 
     fashionable features this month than whoever I'm dating or with ... 
     maybe you can even kick my ass or beat me at chess .... I don't think 
     it's about that (well I'm hoping at least).
     
     Raving is about the collective group's search for individual happiness 
     and I don't think frontin and the often competitive nature of dance 
     circles add to my personal experience.  I've seen vibey circles at big 
     raves off to the side somewhere and that's totally cool.  There is a 
     beauty to doing anything that makes you happy, I've lived vicariously 
     through so many of you and shared your joy.  I don't understand the 
     circles, or what makes them fun for people (well when some of those 
     guys do the ol school head spin stuff it is pretty clean), but I could 
     say that at small parties they fuck it up for me a little because they 
     limit the places I can go, and sometimes keep a real protective vibe 
     (you can't come in here..).

        WOW! The future sure is cool. Damn good that I'm going to be a
computers major in my next couple degrees, that way I can scramble all those
gosh darn secret codes that the SFRC will establish for the downward spiral
of the living youth community.
        Good luck in our future son. It'll be a long drive.

        When I get there, I'll look for ya. What will you be wearing? Hey,
wait, if it's the future, you'll probably come back again to about however
long ago and hear me speak again. Why don't you tell yourself to look me up,
or better yet, put an ad in a newspaper that will appear on the day of your
arrival.

I did - they're...chewy. I know not where to score some locally, but I've
conversed with SF's own Freaky Chakra on this very subject and he's
evidently an aficionado. He's DJing at 111 Minna tomorrow night - I'll see
if he can give me some info. It's some sort of new downbeat club.

What a segue.

Yeah i know i'm two days late but so what.  :) I prefer spring and summer
raving, but autumn days laced with, um, exotic smoke are also a lovely cup
of tea ....

and people get cuddlier when it's colder anyways which is aLWAYS fun. ;)

Hi all!

 A reminder that Greg's B-Day party is this Saturday. It will also be 
another benefit for Omar and his Mom. As such I'm donating my time and 
equipment for both these causes. I encourage everyone to bring Greg a 
little something to make him smile!! I'll be the solo performer in the 
ambient room (YES!!) and I promise to be in a better mood and to fully GO 
OFF!!!

 I have transportation lined up but again could use some help. I need 
manuel labor (before AND after the party), some dayglo banners, and my 
sound system could use some assitance; mainly some subs [I have a Crown 
Macro 1200 to power the subs and a x-over] and a pair of medium size 
2-ways [12 inch woofer and horn] to help with surrond sounds would be cool.
If you are driving from far away we can pay your gas but otherwise this 
IS a benefit and we are trying to keep costs down. Guests are 
proportional to work and/or equipment donated. Prior DDreams crew members 
get first crack at this.

 If interested please email me privately here.


THANKS!!!!!!     =)

Hi,

  I just got back from a 5 day intensive Yoga Retreat,  up at Liberty Retreat,
formed by "The Circle of Friends",  a really great group of people,  who
run this book store in North County (North of San Diego).

  I was in the company of beautiful women,  had great time healing others,
and getting healed...   3 intensive yoga sessions per day,   intensive
meditation,  Tai Chi,  and Tao Yoga sessions.    The Retreat is located
just 2 miles north of the Mexico Border,  about 65 miles East of San Diego,
out in the rugged high desert.  No phone, Email,  or modern conveniences,
but nice bathing deck,  clothing optional,  and a farm like atmosphere.

Wake up at 5 am...
Meditate at 6 am
Meditation walk at 6:30 am
Warm ups and stretching 7 am
Chores at 8 am  (Mine was feeding the farm animals)
Breakfast 8:30 am
Tao Yoga 10:30 am
Lunch 1:00 pm   2 hour break ( hot tub and bathing)
Meditation and breathing  3 pm
Kundalini Yoga,  Tai Chi,  or Feldenkreis 4 pm
   (different each day)
1 hour break 6 pm
Dinner 7 pm
Dance and social activities 8 pm
Discussion group, I ching, tarot readings 9 pm
Healing, Massage, and Raiki 11 pm
Sleep at Midnight

  There were about 20 other people in the group.   More women then men,
excellent relationships developed.  Met some wonderful new friends.
Very structured routines.

  I was gone for 5 days,   and just now getting back to answer my Email
and get in tune with the real world again.  Gathered more than 1000 mail
messages.... so it will be quite sometime before I read all of the rave
related mail.

  I have excellent pictures,  if anyone wants them,  please ask me.
Oh!   Tommorrow and the next day,  I get the DAT recorder,  and exclusive
use of the DJ setup so I'll be re-mixing my tape...   Soon,  I'll have
the money for duping them....  Best price I can offer is $13 per tape.
I want at least $5 per tape in profit.    Hope thats OK with those that
wanted them.

  I rode home with Branden (Narnia promoter),  and he heard the whole mix,
but I discovered that the right turn table had a channel missing,  so this is
why I had to do the re-mix... Branden commented...   "What name will you
want to use,   so I'll know what to put on the flyer?".  He was constantly
re-winding the tape to try and find the point where I mixed it!    :-)

  I've already spun at several parties down here....   :-)    But I would
rather be out on the dance floor....    :-)    :-)

show continue to e-mail the producer at pimentoed@aol.com and encourage
them to keep AMP on the air.

Went to Auto on Saturday, saw Troy & Nicole (hi troy & nicole! :), went
there with our own SFRaves Ecto! :):)  The location was kinda dank & sweaty
and small, and it was pretty early on into the evening when the sweat &
humidity congealed enough to start dripping on people from the ceilings.  It
was a two level location, the main room was in the basement, felt very much
like a large shoebox, white & rectangular, with speakers & dj at the front.
Upstairs was a music-less chill area to rest in, with a few chairs and lotsa
free water & candy (good call on the free water guys! :)  

The vibe of this party felt very east-coasty, from what I've experienced and
what I've heard others describe.  It was very much like the vibe of that
party I wrote to you guys about in Montreal that I went to with Brad when I
was up visiting him in April.  This was a colder harder vibe, very intense,
that results from an entire room of people *really* getting into the music
and dance nothing else.  No fluffy sparkly chill-room people giving
massages, no beautiful day-glow banners, no black-lights or lasers, none of
the stuff I usually see at parties.  In the chill room, people did just
exactly that and no more.  This room seemed to be used expressly for the
purpose of giving your body a break from the frenzied dancing downstairs &
to cool off because it was so hot & sweaty downstairs.  Looking around, it
really looked like there wasn't anybody who appeared to have partaken of
disco biscuits, people just stood talking with drinks of water in their
hands.  The main room was totally devoid of decoration, blank white walls,
and in fact for lighting the room enough to see, they simply used blank
computer screens that had been turned on, & nothing more.  And it was all
good!  I, as I have mentioned before, totally love the soft & fluffy raver
atmosphere you find at so many vibey underground SF parties, but I still
have a particular love for that one kind of east-coast vibe you find at some
parties, that collective energy from every single person in the room totally
getting off on *really* killer music.  And I *loved* the music!  Good
detroit techno, I don't really hear that too often at the parties I go to
with the exception of the Esteemed Mr. Rice (who I dont see that often
anyway).  Yeah, I don't want that hardcore intense vibe at every party I go
to, but it really is unique and I love to experience it every now and then.
And as usual, really like Jon Santos's set.

And that's about all!

Love,
Shawna

            
          Do not go gentle into that good night!

Yo ravers, got a chance to hear some new mixtapes that I'm adding to the
catalof that you might like to know about...  if ya don't like BSP then
delete us now, I jus thought y'all might like to know about some new D -
O - P - E shit.

My new fave is from DJ Nomad (seattle) "From Within".  I didn't think I
was gonna like this one, but Dr Freecloud's reccomended it to me.  This
is some hypnotic subliminal acid trance shit.  Almost progressive
trance, but mroe "out there".  Kind of along the lines of DRC's "In
Between Worlds" which IMO is a damn excellent tape.

Also I'm listening a lot to Ellis Dee's "Hypnotica", which is deeeeeep
Goa trance, especially the A-side.  Lots of great tight bass there.  I
love a lot of bass in Goa trance.

Got a new one from Tim Lawson (uk) called "Evolution".  Some smooth-ass
progressive trance on that.

Tomorrow I will have the new one from Tony Gamboa which is a most
excellent and underbooked DJ in Los Angeles.  "Chemical Warfare" is the
name of that one, and its rumored to be some sick-ass hard fucking acid
trance.  His older tapes still blow me away, so I can't wait for this
one.

Anyway,
da kooky magic wacky Pure Acid Mixtapes booth will be set up at Magic
Wednesdays,
POSSIBLY the Meat Beat Manifesto show at the American Legion friday, (if
not, I'll be there anyway hanging out)
and Where the Wild Things Are on Saturday.

Seeyakids... may mixtapes be plentiful...

If we could shrink the Earth's population to a village of precisely 100
people.......with all existing human ratios remaining the same, it
would look like this:

There would be 57 Asians, 21 Europeans, 14 from the Western Hemisphere
(North and South) and 8 Africans.
51 would be female; 49 would be male
70 would be nonwhite; 30 white.
70 would be non-Christian; 30 Christian.
50% of the entire world's wealth would be in the hands of only 6
people and all 6 would be citizens of the United States.
80 would live in substandard housing.
70 would be unable to read.
50 would suffer from malnutrition.
1 would be near death , 1 would be near birth
Only 1 would have a college education.
No one would own a computer

When one considers our world from such an incredibly compressed
perspective, the need for both tolerance and understanding becomes
glaringly apparent........

This was forwarded to me by a friend. If it makes sense to you,
forward it to a friend.

your touch" 
 
as well as full moon scientist, woodshed, and many other cool trippy
trax.........mostly music bought in the UK this summer.

sides being more uptempo with lots of breakbeats and harder house styles.
no triphop. most of the tracks are from my trip to the UK this summer. 
 
they both are typical moonpup tapes, and are available from Ameba (at a
cost of $15 each) or you can order them through me directly for $10 each.

Subject: [AR] WTB: Record Pressing Equipment; info and leads wanted

Hi all

An associate of mine has just let me know that she has capital in place to
buy a record pressing plant.

We are talking the full deal, not just an acetate cutter, although an
acetate cutter would be a great start.

We are looking as far afield as Germany, South America, Asia and the USA
and have cash ready NOW.

If anyone has any leads whatsoever (as tenuous as they may be) I would love
to hear from you ASAP.

This is a major effort to acquire a fully fledged vinyl production plant
which we are prepared to ship from overseas and re-assemble in Australia.
There is warehouse space available for same in Sydney and all we need is to
find the gear itself.

Any leads appreciated.

Thanks

Jon

	I don't want this to get into any rants on merits of various
	economic systems -   ;-)    - but I recently found out some
	info that was pretty eye-opening about the tax system in
	our country....

	If the total tax paying population of the US were shrunk to 100
	people (note that I'm saying tax PAYERS, ie those who filed
	income tax returns) then you would find that:

	-  one person is paying 29% of all the taxes (federal income taxes)
	- the top 7 taxpayers are paying HALF of all the taxes
	- the top 25 taxpayers are paying 80% of all the taxes

After discussion of this with Ambassador Spock, Lt. Tuvok, Commander Data and 
Lt. Uhura (she was put in there because she's a singer) we have come to the 
logical conclusion that perhaps circle dancing should have definite, defined 
coordinates in which it may exist so that it might not interfere with the other 
people that do not prefer circle dancing as a form of expression within the 
defined parameters 
J:\\EARTH\US\WEST\SANFRAN\RAVES\CIRCLE\DON'TLIKE\LIKE\DON'TLIKE\LIKE...  

If the given parameters do not exist within your particular subdirectory, it is 
highly logically recommended that you invest in the Norton Disk Doctor.  I found
it rather helpful to relieve my "cranial anial inversion".  

     
     At least circle jerking promotes involvement.

i was wondering if anyone had thoughts on the MBM show at the fillmore w/
dj spooky. im fresh to the area and basically know squat.  is the fillmore
the kind of place where you can dance your ass off w/o silly security giving
you attitude cause they are so used to the moshing types and not happy beat
loving dancing folks?

i'm actually not even sure what mbm sound like these days.  i saw them FOUR
years ago with 808 state( whatever happened to those guys).  after seeing
the ad in the paper for this show i went rumbling through my old industrial
collection and popped in satyricon.

i'd almost forgotten how industrial bands like mbm, f242, and ne influenced
me towards the electronic, house and drum and bass i love so much today.
the question is how has mbm changed over the years.  anyone with a clue?

the creamy one

ps
i also saw a flyer for this weekend...fantasy island i think it was
called...half of the djs i couldnt tell you a thing about....but scott
richmond.....is definitely ny's finest...i can only listen to his mix tape
'soyuz' on special occasions cause i'm afraid of how much i abused it
already by playing it so much.

it won't explode, it'll just sound like shit. you could potentially
burn out the phono inputs, but that's very unlikely (unless it's a
gemini :-))

here's da problemz: for one, a phono input has RIAA equalization; for
two, phono levels are in the millivolts or microvolts, CD outs are in
volts (2Volts peak-to-peak maximum typically). even if you attenuate
the output of your CD player into 1/1000 to 1/100 the current output,
you will still have a really fucked up sound with boosted lows and
muted trebles (RIAA equalization -- lowers the level of high-frequency
clicks and pops that invariably occur due to needle tracking over dust
and scratches, and reduces groove width due to reduced bass content...
when a LP is recorded, reverse RIAA equalization is applied which, in
theory, is supposed to cancel out w/ the RIAA equalization in a phono
preamp while reducing the added click/pop noise from playback). Similar
principle is how dolby lowers noise on a tape, except without the bass
boost...

so unless you are desprerate, or unless your mixer has a "line in"
channel, you're SOL with your current mixer. there are mixers with line
and phono inputs out there. for example my pioneer M500 has 4 inputs, 2
switchable between line/phono, 1 switchable between line/cd, 1
switchable between phono/mic.

Hello!

Well, let's look at the lineup from last week's calendar:

   Saturday, September 28th - Fantasy Island
   Metro (live), Barbara Tucker (live), Michelle Weeks (live),
   J.Sinister, Scott Richmond, Jeno, Garth, Spun, Tracy, Preston, That
   Kid Chris, Juan Kato, Davidson Ospina, Dreamer, Carlos, Eric
   Davenport, Hipp-E, Ghost, Frank Nitty, Jon Bishop, Pat Allen, Pete
   Avila, Neon Leon, Soulstice, Sounds from the Ground.
   Visuals by Lumatech Intelligent Lighting, Multi-Media Meltdown, Liquid
   Sircus Delights.
   415.437.6905 510.674.8663 916.491.6851 408.793.0287

First thing: Bagkok Tribe is putting on this party. Based on every other
party that they have put on that either I or someone that I trust has
attended, it sucked.

DJ's and live performances aside (there are quite a few in the lineup that
are really good!), and soley basing a recommendation using the "flyer size
is inversely proportional or party's quality" rule, Fantasy Island looks
like it's gonna suck. The DJ's will be great but I suspect that the
attendees will be "not of the most positive possible element."

Your best value (if nothing else is going on) is to stay home invite some
friends over and and listen to your mixtapes -- at least you won't be put
off by the by Adiddas sports-wearing, bad e pimping, circle dancing, 15
year old surburban gangsta-ravers which are sure to find a place like
"Fantasy Island" their home.

And remember, I'm not jaded, I am experienced. :-) -- I have been to *lots*
of parties big and small, and the big ones just don't give me the "rave
vibe" that I think most of us are out there looking for... (i.e. other
Bagkok Tribe parties, Cool World's, etc.)

Then again, if you are a circle dancer from Concord, I bet you'll have a
blast at this one! :-)

Personally, I use the "number of area codes is inversely proportional"
rule. Three or more turns the litmus bad-party pink.

The way Jim says it, it may seem that the current system is grossly
unfair, but when you take into account the fact that the top taxpayers
are also the top income-earners, the picture begins to even out.  I
looked in the same source as Jim (Statistical Abstract of the United
States), and I found that:

the top...
   0.7% is making 11.6% of the income, and paying 22.3% of the taxes.
   3.0% is making 21.4% of the income, and paying 36.3% of the taxes.
   6.1% is making 30.2% of the income, and paying 46.8% of the taxes.
  23.7% is making 61.3% of the income, and paying 76.0% of the taxes.

the bottom...
  48.4% is making 12.6% of the income, and paying 4.8% of the taxes.

I mean.. egad! 24% of the population is making 61% of the money, and
paying 76% of the tax! Is anyone surprised by this?

-Sho

Caveats: The above information was calculated using adjusted gross
income (AGI) instead of gross income, since it was the only data
available to me, and it's arguably a better number to be using anyway,
since it's the measurement used to calculate tax burden in the first
place.

This brings up another question in my mind. I am curious why I see DJ's
that are part of some really good parties, associate themselves with
promoters that have *ahem* "questionable" track records. Is it just a job?
Or is there just a wide seperation in the view of the D.J.'s and promoters 
relationship and responsibility for the party?

Sometimes, I say to myself"Why would XXXX be spinning at YYYYY given 
YYYY's history. Why would they want to be part of that?" Just curious, no 
flames intended(really.)

w/o posting how much each of these groups earns on a yearly basis -- info
that is also probably in the statistical abstract -- your statistics only
show that the rich have far more money with which to pay taxes than the
poor.  Income distribution is extremely unequal in the U.S., so of course
the rich pay so much of a proportion of taxes -- they have so much more to
begin with.  Also, taxes are on income, not wealth, which is even more
unequally distributed. We need to know how much money the top 1% makes as a
percentage of total income to assess whether it's fair that they pay 29% of
the taxes.

I can understand if you don't want this to become a big topic, but you make
an observation that cries out for more information.

DJ's get booked for parties long before the flyers are out, etc...  and
even if it's not a party that they want to play at, getting to paid to play
records isn't a bad deal... I see a few DJ's on that list that get paid
$500+ for a 1.5 or 2 hour set. Not bad money, eh?

And why would they care if a party sucked? They're only there for a couple
hours, and while they are there, they are busy playing records anyway. And
then they get sorted out and leave.

Of course most people in Concord don't circle dance anyway.  They line dance.

DJ's jobs are not to be some sort of idol dictating good and bad parties
where they spin.  The DJ's job is getting a large number of people moving.
Although I am not a dj, I can imagine that the larger number of people
you can get moving, the more fun it is to DJ.

I mean, it is not like these promoters are out to do bad things... they
do parties.  If you don't like their idea of how to throw parties, then
you should not go.  Even though BT had some difficulties at their last party,
it DID go off, as I recal.

Sorry, but I think this comment is silly.  A DJs job is to MOVE people,
not to give/deny credibility to promoters.  Sometimes I think people
take partying and party politics way to seriously.  They are just parties, 
after all.

     It sounds like in the above statement that Income is being distributed unequaly.  I didn't know it was being distributed at all.  Where can I get some?

If things go as planned, I will be playing records in the ambient room at
Fantasy Island.  How much am I getting paid?  $0.00

Why am I doing it?

Because I love music and I *kinda* like people, and don't give a rat's
royal rectum about much else.

Just my personal reason.

You're new to the Bay Area, right? Then you should definitely go to
Fantasy Island. One of my first parties after moving here was Lucky
Charms (another Bagkok Tribe production), a true learning experience.

Consider it a rite of passage. You must go.

My comments were general in nature, and I explictly attempted to make them
so. I admit I should have perhaps altered the subject line.

Well, as has been discussed before, some peoples livelyhood come from
these "parties." Myself, I have to feel good about what I am doing, and
who I am working for to some extent. Of course, I know for others, it
doesn't matter, or they do not have the luxury to be able to make such
grandiose choices.

Steve,

Did you catch the remix of "The Way It Is"
by Bruce Hornsby & the Range that night?  Beautiful song.  I'd love to know
where to get that record.

There were actually a lot of talented DJs there that night (Marshall, are
you reading this?  Bwassup?), most of none of whom I'd ever heard of
before.

I must say I was a bit sketched by the kid at the door who was grabbing
people's money and shoving it hurriedly into his backpack.

Hmmm...

peas,

 Subject: The beast himself
 
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 Linda Branagan is an expert on daemons. She has a T-shirt that sports
 the daemon in tennis shoes that appears on the cover of the 4.3BSD
 manuals and The Design and Implementation of the 4.3BSD UNIX Operating
 System by S. Leffler, M. McKusick, M. Karels, J. Quarterman,
 Addison-Wesley Publishing Company, Reading, MA 1989.
 
 She tells the following story about wearing the 4.3BSD daemon T-shirt:
 
 Last week I walked into a local ``home style cookin'
 restaurant/watering hole'' in Texas to pick up a take-out order. I
 spoke briefly to the waitress behind the counter, who told me my order
 would be done in a few minutes.
 
 So, while I was busy gazing at the farm implements hanging on the
 walls, I was approached by two ``natives.'' These guys might just be
 the original Texas rednecks.
 
      ``Pardon us, ma'am. Mind if we ask you a question?''
      Well, people keep telling me that Texans are real friendly,
      so I nodded.
      ``Are you a Satanist?''
      Well, at least they didn't ask me if I liked to party.
      ``Uh, no, I can't say that I am.''
      ``Gee, ma'am. Are you sure about that?'' they asked.
 
 I put on my biggest, brightest Dallas Cowboys cheerleader smile and
 said, ``No, I'm positive. The closest I've ever come to Satanism is
 watching Geraldo.''
 
      ``Hmmm. Interesting. See, we was just wondering why it is
      you have the lord of darkness on your chest there.''
 
 I was this close to slapping one of them and causing a scene--then I
 stopped and noticed the shirt I happened to be wearing that day. Sure
 enough, it had a picture of a small, devilish-looking creature that
 has for some time now been associated with a certain operating system.
 In this particular representation, the creature was wearing sneakers.
 
      They continued: ``See, ma'am, we don't exactly appreciate it
      when people show off pictures of the devil. Especially when
      he's lookin' so friendly.''
 
 These idiots sounded terrifyingly serious.
 
      Me: ``Oh, well, see, this isn't really the devil, it's just,
      well, it's sort of a mascot.''
      Native: ``And what kind of football team has the devil as a
      mascot?''
      Me: ``Oh, it's not a team. It's an operating--uh, a kind of
      computer.''
 
 I figured that an ATM machine was about as much technology as these
 guys could handle, and I knew that if I so much as uttered the word
 ``UNIX'' I would only make things worse.
 
      Native: ``Where does this satanical computer come from?''
      Me: ``California. And there's nothing satanical about it
      really.''
 
 Somewhere along the line here, the waitress noticed my
 predicament--but these guys probably outweighed her by 600 pounds, so
 all she did was look at me sympathetically and run off into the
 kitchen.
 
      Native: ``Ma'am, I think you're lying. And we'd appreciate
      it if you'd leave the premises now.''
 
 Fortunately, the waitress returned that very instant with my order,
 and they agreed that it would be okay for me to actually pay for my
 food before I left. While I was at the cash register, they amused
 themselves by talking to each other.
 
      Native #1: ``Do you think the police know about these devil
      computers?''
      Native #2: ``If they come from California, then the FBI
      oughta know about 'em.''
 
 They escorted me to the door. I tried one last time:
 
      ``You're really blowing this all out of proportion. A lot of
      people use this `kind of computers.' Universities,
      researchers, businesses. They're actually very useful.''
 
 Big, big, big mistake. I should have guessed at what came next.
 
      Native: ``Does the government use these devil computers?''
      Me: ``Yes.''
 
 Another big boo-boo.
 
      Native: ``And does the government pay for 'em? With our tax
      dollars?''
 
 I decided that it was time to jump ship.
 
      Me: ``No. Nope. Not at all. Your tax dollars never entered
      the picture at all. I promise. No sir, not a penny. Our good
      Christian congressmen would never let something like that
      happen. Nope. Never. Bye.''

I missed "The Way It Is", I think. That night was sort of a blur.

One thing I will say about Lucky Charms that night is that the DJ's
were really good. I don't think I've heard scratching (non hip-hop
scratching, that is) that good since then.

I was admitted free (because of a friend of friend), so it was worth
the money, despite the scary gangsta climate.

Hence my take on Bagkok parties: cool DJ's, sketchy people, too many
area codes. 'nuff said.

Well... umm.. I must admit (silence as Melissa hangs head in shame) that I
have tasted the Lava Lamp of drinks.  Let me just say that it looks alot
better than it tastes.  I think kids might love it though.  I would if I
was 10.

So then why would these same DJs be in "Central Ohio" at a similar 
"likely to suck party" called Natural the night before Fantasy Island?

When someone asks you a question about one of your posts, should the reply
always go to the list, or should you just send it directly to them? I find
that the answers can get kinda cryptic over a long "RE:" chain.

Like any of you care. Here are a few new ones from the old house 'o wayne:

Wayne's to do list:
	1. Stop eating meat		(done!)
	2. Switch to Windows95		(coming soon!)
	3. Vote for Bill Clinton	(just a couple more months to go!)

Why this is significant:
	1. I have eaten meat all my life. My diet mainly consisted of
burgers and pork.
	2. I worked on the Macintosh OS at Apple for 5 years, I angrily
defended Macintosh
		to the death. Well, Apple no longer deserves my evangelical
efforts.
	3. I grew up a hard-core right wing gun toting Republican in
Irvine, California
		mocking liberals and anyone not a strong member of the
Republican party.

Why I am happy about all this:
	1. I feel better not eating any meat/pork/chicken
	2. Apple's supremely tubing it these days and Windows
		actually looks like it doesn't suck anymore.
	3. Bob Dole is a bitter old codger who, it seems, would like to lock up
		everybody in AmeriKKKa (thanks Neils!) that isn't an anti-drug,
		anti-minority, right-wing Rush Limbaugh listening, mindless
		KKKristian bible toter. So fuck 'em. It's time to switch to the
		*thinking* side of "mainstream politics"
		(I voted for Reagan in 84, Bush in 88, Perot in 92... now
		I get to *happily* vote Democrat!)

flame on, tiny warriors!

We called the 1-800 # here at Space Station Russ. The man answering had
never tried it (?), had no idea what the bits were(??), or how they were
made (???). 

Yikes! And this guy's supposed to be promoting the stuff?

My question is: How do they get the bits to suspend in mid-liquid? 

Modern technology. I'm forever amazed.

     Ummm... question.
     
     I assume you're a DJ and I said I had a gig lined up for you in 
     Belgium, 2 in England, and then four stops on the East Coast, would 
     you know intimately what would go off and what wouldn't (did I mention 
     that you're late on rent and I have a pen and some blood and a 
     contract?)?  Is there any way of knowing that you'd be playing solid 
     parties everytime?  Is there a chance a 'good' promoter or co-op could 
     go shitty or vice versa?  I mean, you get to spin your musics for 
     people, that's what you wanted right?
     
     Could it just be a matter of taste (don't get me wrong, I still fleed 
     in panic when I saw the crowd outside five... One question: I wonder 
     if they got to vote for the prom queen or if it was rigged).
     
     Sometimes great DJs play shit parties... no sense in passing judgement 
     on them.  I've heard some cool shit at bad parties, and just waited 
     until they played a good party later.  Or I kick myself for not going 
     to a party I KNEW was shit... but Carl Cox played and it would have

Since we are "assuming" things, let's "assume" that the DJ is local and
knows what's up locally. What then?

I am posing questions. Don't mistake questions for passing judgement. 

I have seen people *BLAST*(I have done so too) promoters and parties in
the past. Yet DJ's seem to be above questioning, as if they have
absolutely nothing to do with a party or its promoters(which
may be the case.) I am just asking why people think that is. 

Oh god, how dare I question yet another sacred cow?

I'm listening to some cool ambient on KPFA right now (Weds. 10 pm).
Lately, I have heard some really good dance-techno music on radio stations
lately.  My favorite (when I can get it) is KFJC 89.7 in Los Altos Hills.
They seem to play the most dance music of any other station.
When I went down to Harmony we listened to some good music the whole way
down to the South Bay that Saturday afternoon on that station.  In any
given week I have been able to find house\techno at least 4-5 times a week 
especially in the evenings.  On a Tuesday night I heard some good stuff on
KUSF and on Thursdays KALX has some good stuff.  Anyway, this causes me
endless amounts of joy because I can only listen to my mix tapes so many
times and the refreshing array of music is marvelous.  Plus, you get the
added bonus of an occasional dj telling you what tracks were played which
makes it so much easier to figure out what you'd like to buy.

Anyway, I was just wondering if anyone knew of schedules for certain
programs so I can look out for them.  I know the calendar has listings,
but many seem to be out of date.  

I'm so happy, can't you tell?!! :P

Thanks,
KaySEE

man you guys have it SO nice down there :(  we have four shows, but all 
at weird times of the day, all on CITR.  very late monday, wed. morning, 
Fri afternoon and night.  And the wed morning show is pretty silly ... 
*sigh* oh well!  but i agree - i very much like a) new music frequently 
and b) finding out what the HELL i was that i heard at that rave the 
other night that blew me away :)

Sf Ravers..

I personally have played for them (bagok Tribe) and our views must be from
totally different angles..i know them pretty well and they do believe in
throwing good, "honest" parties..they are not at all "shady" in my
terms...ive played for many promoters and these guys are definatly not the
worst of the bunch...I was dying to play this party but due to prior booking.
i wasnt able to....my loss.. ilove SF!
So realize...some things that do happen at the party are not the promoters
fault..

jus my 2 cents..
have a great weekend!

Before I depart on Sunday for my own time period let me give my 2 cents on
the DJ thing for this time period and then my own time period.

I've seen many DJ's in many different types of parties and IMO You will see
a good DJ play at a known to be bad or questionable parties because of a
few reasons.

1. Like someone said before, rent is due and bills are climbing. Some DJ's,
that's all they do for a job is spin at parties. For the ones that make
$500 for 1 1/2 - 2 hour set, which are alot of them if they charge the
promoter, they usually have at least 2 parties a weekend. What an awesome
$1000 a week job.

2. The love for the music. If there a decent DJ, and most of the crowd
already likes the DJ, the party may suck but people are enjoying the music
even if it's a bad vibe party.
   A. More then 90% of the post about shitty vibe parties the first thing I
remember being said is that the music was Great, but the vibe sucked.

3. Possible bookings by promoters attending the shitty party. Want to be
and already promoters come to parties to hand out flyers and maybe checkout
the DJ's. They know that party sucks, all they want to do is listen to the
DJ. The DJ might know this and try and give a great set regardless of the
party vibe and crowd.

4. If it's and out of town party, most DJ's ( I know 6 of them) get's paid
$1000, plane ticket and hotel for usually a 2 hour set. Hot damn the also
have a $500 dollar party the next night back home.

5. Money is money and who cares were it came from as long as they don't get
busted.


That's my take on the subject. Granted some DJ's spin for free also. Alot
of them either spin because they like it and/or just want to be heard and
be known for a ripping set.



Now in my time 2095, all the rotten and shitty promoters are all in the
holding cell because they just wanted to make a buck and was careless and
got busted. (if you remember in the years 2095 raves and rave music was
banned, right now it looks like I've done my job and there are parties not
being busted and are left alone. So I'll see what's up when I return) The
DJ's don't care who throws the party, it's a chance to spin and play some
killer music money or no money and because the love it.

So all we have are good vibe parties and promoters who care what happens at
a party because there are only once a month maybe 2 if we are lucky. If a
bad promoter cames about they quickly get caught or can't get a DJ and
therefore doesn't throw one.



So the point of the matter is, who care were a DJ spins. They have there
reason and it none of our damn buisness why. The more they spin, the better
they get (hopefully). Hell a bad party would be a killer place to try knew
things. Then they can bring it to the good ones knowing people would love
it and not try the things they know people won't like.

i have a big favor to ask some of you:

does anyone out there have:

a Macintosh with
a _fast_ (ISDN, T1... the faster the better) internet connection
and an external HD of 100MB or more?

here's the story: i'm trying to learn unix/perl, and my remote host is
painfully slow (like typing delays of 5-10 seconds at times)...

i was browsing the web last night and came across info of a version of
LINUX for power macs... "great!" i thought, "i can set up a unix system an
my own computer and it will be much easier!"... ha ha. if only it were that
easy.

the file is almost 80 MB and for some reason isn't split up into easily
downloadable chunks. at the speed of my internet connection (14.4 and not
_even_ that fast in practice) that's a 16 hour download. not gonna happen.

i was wondering if someone with a fast connection could be persuaded to DL
the file for me and get it to me somehow (like an external HD).

i would be much indebted. i will try to compensate you in some way although
cash is probably not it right now since i'm kinda broke.

if any of you have used MkLinux, let me know-- if it's a piece of shit,
i'll save myself (and a friendly favor-doer) the trouble.

many thanks in advance.

love,

brian

Lemming. ;)

I actually have a 100mhz Pentium PC compatibility card in my 8500, plus an
eXodus X Windows server, so I have 3 operating systems happily running on
my mac, which by the way is the msot stable mac I've ever owned. Try that
on any other platform.

I can make you very unhappy about this in a few minutes.  :-)

Bill Clinton is willing to change his mind on any subject to further
his career.

He has NO principles whatsoever.

" All Bill Clinton consists of is a huge appetite. " - Jesse Jackson
(Democrat)

He cares for nothing other than Bill Clinton.

There was a great Bill Moyers documentary a couple of years ago about
how Bill Clinton is the biggest friend of "corporate Amerikkka".
He'll help anyone who helps him.

He is a great used car salesman, maybe the best ever !

I have a 2-page newspaper article consisting of quotes from
environmentalists that are pissed off at him, because he never did
anything that he said he would do.

I'm sure anyone can find pages of angry tirades by gay activists who
are pissed off at him for the same reason.

How about the recent "attack" on Iraq, which made him look good in the
press, but which all the experts have concluded has only made Saddam
Hussain stronger.

How about misusing the FBI to frame various long-term employees of the
White House travel agency, in order to replace them with friends from
Arkansas.

How about illegally obtaining hundreds of FBI files in order to gain
information about his enemies, the scope of which is much greater than
anything that caused Nixon to resign.   (A Nixon staffer went to jail
for obtaining ONE FBI file.)

I could go on at length, including various vile things which his
administration has done which are never reported in the press, but
which have a lot more evidence than there was against OJ.  

All of this stuff scares me far more than anything Bob Dole might do.

"Any government big enough to give you everything you want, is also
big enough to take everything away from you."


Cheers,

Ken                         <*>

     Dear SFR:
     
     I would like to find a place on the Penninsula (or San Francisco) that 
     has a Cyclone Majestik color printer, that has Quark X-Press, (no, not 
     Muzik X-Press), and will allow me to bring my Joulie hard drive in to 
     interface with their MacIntosh powerpc.  Can anyone direct me to a 
     good location that is not Kinko's?  I have already been to Kinko's 3 
     times with this hd, and they seem to be the McDonald's of desktop 
     publishing, it just wasn't cookie cutter enough for them.  
     
     ps, if someone does know someone who works at Kinko's or someone works 
     at Kinko's and they feel good enough to tackle this, that would be 
     fine.  It just didn't seem to work out at Kinko's and I am not that 
     technical when it comes to the hardware.  
     
     Thx,
     
     deepfog

Wow!
You could be surprised at how good some LARGE parties are.  Funky Tekno 
Tribe last Halloween in Sac. was a really good party.  Especially for 
it's location and size.  All the people who accompanied me also had a 
great time.

Granted, most huge flyer, multi-number, megaparties are mega-booty.  But, 
there are some that remind me why I became the person I am today.  When 
you have a few thousand kids freakin' out to a gajillion watt sound 
system with an awesome lightshow, it can be utter lunacy.  When matched 
with your personal favorite chemical (im)balance.  It can become a space 
you may never want to leave.

I have found that when I get outside of California, bigger parties tend 
to get a little better.  A lot of it, I feel is due to the notable 
absence of punk-ass gangsta ravers.  It's sad to think that the only 
place they can go on weekends is a place where they can piss on 
everyone's parade.  It's too bad malls don't stay open all night.

It's too bad we haven't found a solution to this problem.  Could you 
imagine if all the raves were on a good vibe?  That would be soooo dope...

...then I woke up...

Subject: Symbiosis New LP Numinous, Anyone Have it?
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

Does anyone know if the new double pack lp Numinous by Symbiosis
has been released yet? I've heard conflicting leads that it has
been released / to be released. Also, it's supposed to be released
on Hardkiss but I've heard that it was going to be released on 
Sunburn instead? I heard a test pressing of one of the tracks and I 
would love to get it or the lp, the only problem is I've called just 
about every vinyl shop here in the bay area and they had no info...
I've even tried calling Hardkiss Music in SF and sent email to 
Symbiosis themselves.

Thanks for any info!

Peace,
John

I guess by the response  to my original post, I should skip fantasy island 
for the mbm show. Due to  being fresh to the area and scene here, I 
have no means of getting there.  So if anyone is travelling through my 
area, i could offer my company  as well as a bunch of groovy mixtapes for 
your aural pleasure from the scenes I am more familiar with. Please eme....

On the topic of large parties, djs, and shady promoters.....I've

greatly appreciate a dj that doesnt....

After spending 4 years in pittsburgh, I'd have to disagree with "likely to 
suck party" being linked to the fact that its in "Central Ohio".  Pgh's 
location allowed me to experience the pb-cle rave scene aka "Central Ohio" 
 as well as hopping down to the baltimore-dc and ny parties.  I'd have to 
say my best experiences were shared amongst all the scenes.  So I 
wouldn't generalize on what is gonna be the shit based on its location.

I don't like Clinton myself, but the above statement kinda Stuuuuuppid. If
it's not reported to the press then how can you go on in length about vile
things he's done? Are you or someone you know personally part of his
administration. Did you get this vile info first hand from the big (smelly)
cheese himself.

Please keep in mind, I'm not defending him in anyway and I wouldn't even
elect him to scrub toilets. I'm just wondering where you got this info the
was not reported in the press. Just asking and not flaming.

Hey SFRavers-

I've been organizing a camping trip for this weekend-  it will be a perfect 
weekend for it.  I've been told by a boyscout (they're never wrong) that it 
will be warm, and I think Friday is a full moon (possibly a lunar eclipse 
(???)). 

So.....If anyone is interested, let me know. There will probably be 15 to 20 
people going so far, a pretty mixed crowd from all walks. It won't be a rave 
party per se, just a bunch of people hanging out, enjoying the starz und die 
Umwelt.  Anyone with an open mind is welcome. People who play some sort of 
instrument are especially welcome. The location is at French Meadows, a 
wildlife refuge and resevoir about 3/4 the way to Tahoe. 

Email if you want directions!

you've got be kidding.  i'm hardly a big supporter of clinton, but when
you consider the alternative (realisically, it's just dole), what other
choice do we have?

since it's basically a given that clinton will be re-elected, i'll
probably vote green, just as a gesture of support, but if the race was
closer i'd have probably have to vote for clinton...

Vote for a party you support, not a party that you think will get
elected.  If more people did this, the "third parties" would slowly
gain credibilty and (most important) $$$ support. Let's say the Green
Party gets a 5% vote this year. Don't you think that'll get some
attention?

The Gathering - in April - that was my 3rd party and it was *the best*.
There were a lot of people, but the energy was so good and I did not want
to leave.

Dancing, dancing, dancing...
Wandering around by myself and meeting tons of people...
People giving Easter eggs outside in the morning....
Hearing the theme song from "Up Close and Personal" right outside the
warehouse and wanting it to stop, because I wanted something faster,
faster....
Sleeping 2 hours and going to the boat party....

One of the best party weekends.

Just my thoughts,
Branka

Hello all,

First post to the list here, so if I demonstrate my naivete, lemme know!

Thanks for the info, I'm going to try out those stations--sounds good.
I was lucky enough to be in the UK this summer, and London's radio
stations can really spoil you.  Although the music can sometimes be pretty
dancey-dancey, and not incredibly deep, it's still nice to have lots of
rave/house music playing all the time.  Taping the Essential Selection
every friday night is pretty much like have a roughly new mix tape every
week!

Cheers,

Spence

Heard this 2 months ago and thought it was soooo killer, I have to find it....
Okay, now everyone prepare themselves to try and figure out what song this
is by my feeble attempt at phonetically describing a phunky beat....I heard
this for the first time at the reggae fest when the Wicked crew was
spinning...It's not a fast beat but kinda slow like a build up...like to say
"okay, get ready because here comes Garth" type beat...and after humming it
3 times (you gotta hum it 'case it's a vibrating fuzzy sound), change the
pitch, make it a little higher the next time And, it sounded *VERY* warm and
fuzzy..... I'm not expecting anyone to figure out what it is but
nevertheless, it'll make you all stop and hum it...smile...and that's a
distraction that we all need.   ;)


Boooom Booooom.....boo ba boo ba boo ba.........Booooom Booooom  <repeat>
or
Humm this:

Mmmmmm Mmmmmm....oooh aaaah ooooh aaaah ooooh ahhhh......Mmmmmmm Mmmmmm <repeat>


On this day, desperately yearning to be blown away by the power of the human
mind,

Nexus is known for doing cool things like free  massages, herbal
therapy, butterflies (OPEN!)  They are very cool.

One comment I wanted to make about that whole "DJ X playing at Y party"
thing: One thing that is a trend at many big headline parties is that
these "brand name", well known DJ's get paid sometimes 15 min after they
do their set so they can double book. This really annoys me bacause it
seems to put these DJ's on a higher plateu. I've heard people get all
giddy because they just got DJ X's autograph. Say what?! I'm sorry but I
just hate the idea of certain DJ's being "celebrities". 
EXAMPLE: One reason why I love F-8 parties so much is that when Mars and
Myster-E aren't spinning during the evning, they are out dancing with
the rest of us, or just chilling talking with some people. They really
mingle with the group. You can walk up to them and say "Hey man you were
awsome tonight!" And they are senciere when they accept your grattitue
and they let you know they appreciate you being here.  It's a much
better vibe and feeling of PLUR than: "Okay Casper the 'friendly' DJ,
here's your money. *Whoosh* he's gone!"
>>> Ariel Stallings <ASTALLINGS@gcwf.com> 09/25/96 01:24pm >>>

To that party's credit:  Nexus IS doing the chill room, so it can't be
ALL bad...right?  I've heard great things about Nexus...

You know, I remember the good ol' days, when sfraves was more focused on
the rave scene.  Now we have a high volume of NRR posts, which continues
despite the pleas of several of the good folk around here.  Should we
make an effort to discipline ourselves, and make more use of private
exchange, or should those who don't like it GO TAKE A FLYING LEAP?
OK, seriously now: We're getting better in our use of this list, IMHO. 
Some of us are even so considerate as to include NRR in our subject
lines.  Still, there are disgruntled members on the list.  My advice to
those who don't like the way this list is being used is: a) unsub; b)
create your own list, with whatever restrictions you want; or c) grin
and bear it, 'cause it looks like things will remain the same around
here for the forseeable future.

     I wouldn't skip the Fantasy Island party just because all these people 
     dissed on it. From what I've read over the past months it seems that 
     most of the people on the list are not in to the larger parties. It 
     seems that most people on the list are in to going to smaller parties 
     where they know everyone and half the people at the party are 
     subscribed to this list. Personally I can have a good time at most any 
     party. Depends on what I'm in the mood for. You have to ask yourself 
     what is it that your looking for in a party? Maybe after you determine 
     that, the list can direct you to a party that might fit those needs. 
     If not Fantasy Island I would try at least one of the massives in SF. 
     The Funky Techno Tribe Holloween massive is coming up and I think the 
     Gathering is in December. There are a handful of smaller more intimate 
     parties on almost any given weekend so you'll have plenty of 
     opportunities to check out that scene.

I guess by the response  to my original post, I should skip fantasy island 
for the mbm show. Due to  being fresh to the area and scene here, I 
have no means of getting there.  So if anyone is travelling through my 
area, i could offer my company  as well as a bunch of groovy mixtapes for 
your aural pleasure from the scenes I am more familiar with. Please eme....
     
On the topic of large parties, djs, and shady promoters.....I've 
experienced them all prolly without much of a pattern.  But when the vibe 
does suck,  and I want to focus all my attention away from that fact, I 
greatly appreciate a dj that doesnt....

After spending 4 years in pittsburgh, I'd have to disagree with "likely to 
suck party" being linked to the fact that its in "Central Ohio".  Pgh's 
location allowed me to experience the pb-cle rave scene aka "Central Ohio" 
 as well as hopping down to the baltimore-dc and ny parties.  I'd have to 
say my best experiences were shared amongst all the scenes.  So I 
wouldn't generalize on what is gonna be the shit based on its location.

        Yeah. . . Why do all of whoever hate circle dancers? Damn, am I a
bad person cuz sometimes I'll be dancing and a circle forms by me? I just
like to hang out where most of them dance, and there's nothing wrong with a
little playful competition. People who love to dance around, and who've
worked to get good at it, like a little appreciation on their dancing
capabilities. There are tons of people with glow sticks nowadays, and
they're actually worse then circle dancers cuz they have these bright lights
to draw attention. But no one complains about them? 
        I like circle dancing, it's fun to be watched, and I like to learn
from other people. A lot of times, I'll meet someone new because we were
dancing together (sorta) and we liked each others styles.
        I wasn't sure what you guys meant by circle dancing till just a few
weeks ago. Now I'm like, why??? What is acceptable to you? Does everyone
have to dance far away from anyone else in the corners of the room away from
the music? About the only thing I don't like about the dancing there is that
soooo many people think that you have to go to the dance floor to dance, and
thats wrong. I just like to dance near the speakers so I can lose myself in
the music.
        If no one danced to show off what they have, everyone would be
tapping there feet and jumping up and down.

pretty cool huh?

But the person dancing would most likely have to take up a lot of space to
dance to their fullest anyway. And if there isn't enough room, you can
always go somewhere else. If there was a lot of room everywhere, everyone
would be dancing their heart out, but it ends up with people dancing so
close feet get stepped on constantly so you don't even really use your legs
and you can't use your arms cuz you'll hit someone. My chain that I wear
usually keeps people back about 3 or 4 feet.

Some people just go to watch and listen to the music. I'm sure there are
people there who just want to watch how others dance and maybe learn from
them before they try to build up enough courage to dance themselves (not in
a circle). A lot of people are afraid because they don't think they look
cool, but I don't think that many people actually know what they're doing,
but they all look cool when they try.

Is competetive bad? I'm sure most of us race to the party to get in before
everyone else, or to actually get in. Dancing isn't a sport, but it is kind
of competetive. It's more of a "WOW, that's cool, I wunnadooothat" kinda
thing, than a "WOW, that guys good, I haftashowhimup" type of attitude.

"Who interprets the divinity inherent in nature for us today?Who are our shamans?  Who interprets unseen things for us?"

	Finds of ancient art nearly always are attributed by archeologists to a religious or cult function.  This is so, not just for major centers like Egypt and the Indus Valley, but for areas that vastly pre-date them.  Intriguing artifacts 10,000 to 40,000 years old are becoming more common.  How and why did man (and woman) become an artist?
	All of the arts owe their origins to the spiritual craft of shamanism.  <I>Shamanism</I> is the ancient universal tradition whereby personal and tribal healing and empowerment is nurtured, supervised and accomplished through the special skills and services of a charismatic individual.  This shaman may be male or female.  He or she may be called medicine wo/man, witch doctor, sorcerer/ess, magician, witch, psychic, yogi, yogini, kahuna, medium, seer and various other names around the globe.  
	The shaman can transcend normal human consciousness and travel among different cosmological planes.  As an intermediary between the visible & invisible worlds, this powerful <I>wise one</I> is guardian of the tribe's psychic and ecological health and welfare.  All over the world, shamans encountered in the last 200 years have functioned in the same basic manner using similar techniques. 
	In shamanic cultures many strong individuals also might fulfill at least some spiritual and healing needs for themselves and other members of their family.  There is a general shared awareness of the unseen world.  And certainly the community's professional shaman would take care of his family first, as they probably supported him/her economically. 
	<I>Shaman</I> has entered our vocabulary from the study of the Tungus people of Siberia, where a living tribal healing process was thoroughly observed and documented in the 19th Century.  The process itself is apparently a very ancient technology, the practice of which predates writing and all "civilization" as we know it.  Some variation or form of it is indigenous to all parts of the globe.  
	"Even in the historical literature from the Classical Mediterranean, or from medieval and Renaissance western Europe, one finds evidence that the same basic shamanic knowledge once existed there until it was largely eradicated by the Inquisition."<B>1</B>  
	The primary purposes of shamanic tradition are (a) to promote and increase order, health, wealth and happiness of the individuals and the whole tribe, (b) to instill a common vision with individual motivation, (c) to appease the ancestors and protect against evil influences (demons of illness & bad luck), and (d) to divine hidden truths and/or the future.  The shaman presides at the soul-rituals of birth, marriage and death, and conducts the annual tribal ceremonies and community sacrifices.  These seasonal festivals promote harmony and balance within the tribe, between men and women, and with the natural elements, the plants and the animals.  
	Shamanism functions in a fertile, supportive, positive social context.  Within the tribe it is revered as a reliable source of essential wholeness, energy and power.  It is the source of mental knowledge available to cope with the serious challenges to health and survival.  "In order to effect a cure of the patient, belief in what is happening must be held, reinforced, and intensified, not only in the patient, but in the audience as well, for their experience contributes directly to the effect." 
	The shaman is disciplined, courageous, tenacious---a mind/body specialist, master of kundalini, communer with spirits, supernatural healer, magical athlete, masker, artist & craftsman, herbalist, ecstatic traveler between the worlds, spiritual power-broker, cosmic metaphysician, tapper of infinite universal energy, creative illusionist, skilled performing-artist.  
	"...Medicine-men...are of immense social significance, the psychological health of the group largely depending on faith in their powers..." The shaman's personal power is amplified by a visionary guardian spirit: the tutelary, <I>nagual</I>, familiar, companion, assistant totem, power animal (etc.); and he/she may have a number of additional spiritual helpers as well.
	A shaman derives his/her unlimited power to serve the community directly from divine source, while the priest/priestess derives limited power from service to a cult or church.  Organized religions, sponsored by warrior class power, have historically co-opted the tribal spiritual base.  They have taken over the  magical crafts and arts developed by shamans, to serve their own economic and military ambitions.  
	By dividing and undermining group faith and support, by discrediting the shamans' divine credentials, and by offering a glamourous (militarily imposed) alternative to an economically powerful elite, missionaries have succeeded in devastating many shamanic tribal cultures world-wide.  They still do this!
	There is clearly a supportive, practical and interactive connection of the arts to spirituality and religion.  The arts have a capacity to create illusion and/or to manifest the impossible, the invisible, and the unknown.  They can visualize and then make the fantastic real.  This is miraculous magical power, and all spiritual traditions have employed the magic of the arts in one way or another.  
	Various art forms were developed by shamans to create a receptive atmosphere, a supranormal context for spiritual healing rituals.  They are also used as sensory triggering mechanisms to expand consciousness and/or induce shamanic trance states (both personally and for the group). 	
	It was discovered that recreatable multi-artistic experiences can be keys to access the inspiration of the higher self, and to reprogram the powerful instincts of the lower self.  Tattooing, piercing or scarification are used as the permanent reminder of a particularly important life lesson, healing or initiation.  
	Shamanic ritual is high theater!  "Professional cure by a shaman who is the central actor usually involves careful preparations, full publicity, and an eager audience; impressive setting and lighting, costume and makeup, theatrical properties and sound effects.  Actual performance includes dramatic invocation of evil or benevolent spirits, or both, for diagnosis and advice as to treatment; possession of or battle with the shaman by the spirits through ecstasy or frenzy which may be considered a supreme example of dramatic impersonation, often with elaborate use of voice, dialogue, and body pantomime; concretizing the disease demons, and driving them away, often with sucking out, sleight of hand, and display of disease objects; and luring home of the sick person's soul.  The performance may require the help of stage assistants, and active participation by the patient and the audience..."
	While many different forms of music are used in ritual around the world, drumming is particularly effective.  Rhythm and percussion typically are used to trigger trance states in the Barong dances of Indonesia and possession dances of Africa and African diaspora traditions in America such as Macumba, Santeria and Voudon.    
	Everywhere shamans make masks.  The mask embodies the spirit, and donning it the shaman accepts the presence of the spirit into him/herself.  The Tlingit and Tibetan shamans alike "utter the words of the spirit" when wearing the mask.  Elaborate masked pantomime dances punctuate the sacred calendar in South India with <I>Kathakali</I>,  in Japan it's <I>Bogaku</I>,  in Tibet <I>Cham</I>,  in Pueblo land the <I>Kachina</I>  dances.  Such masked dances are also witnessed in Africa, the Pacific Islands, North & South America as well as ancient civilizations like the Egyptian, Mayan, Inca, etc.	Architecture was originated by shamanic cultures.  So called "primitive" tribal peoples all over the world have built sophisticated giant structures and statuary to serve the community.  Natural cultivation of mental faculties enhanced through their shamanic traditions, enabled them to cut, shape and move heavy stone with simple tools.  Their impressive creative abilities can be attributed to a greater group consciousness, sense of cooperation, adaptability, intuition and psychic awareness.      
	The cycles of nature were keenly observed and respected by early man because they had such an impact on people's ability to survive and thrive.  Stonehenge and other earth and stone circles & alignments measured, symbolized and celebrated the ritual Wheel of the Solar Year---the medicine wheel, the 8-spoked Wheel of Dharma---with its solstices, equinoxes and cross-quarter days.
	In Europe megalithic monuments thousands of years old (shamanic cultural architecture with practical and spiritual purposes) were defaced, dismantled or built directly upon by the Christian church.  The knowledge of their function and use was systematically banned, scrambled and eradicated as the shamans, Druids, and "witches," were brutally exterminated.  Their followers "voluntarily" converted, if they wanted to survive.  Shamanic magic was dismantled and the spoils were divided between the forces of religions and the minions of science---both getting shortchanged in the bargain.  To this day neither religion or science can muster the pure positive communal transformative energy exhibited by the ancient shamanic high cultures.
	Curiously, circus arts also began as ritual effects.  In Japan the <I>Saragaku</I> tradition wove together the presentation of acrobatics, magic, divination, fire-eating and other circuslike acts.  The two-man dancing lion figure, now seen at <I>kung-fu</I> demonstrations and Chinese New Year parades, was commonly used in exorcism ceremonies throughout Asia.  In Tibet it was the protective snow lion, in China the temple-guardian Fu dog.  The dancing dragon, commonly seen in Chinese New Year parades, was often its companion.  
	The expulsion of the bad luck demons of the old year was accomplished annually in Tibet at <I>Losar</I> (New Year), a grand and national exorcism celebration.  "Amongst the festivities at Lhasa is the spectacle of 'Flying Spirits,' by performers who glide down a rope stretched from the summit of the Potala palace to its base."<B>5</B>  This feat was also performed in medieval Europe, with rope-dancers stretching incline ropes from the steeples of cathedrals.  It could only be described as an awesome sight.  
	At one time the European Christians enlisted actors & entertainers to present passion plays and morality pageants.  Later jugglers, magicians, dancers, mimers and all performers were persecuted by the Church.  They were all considered to be in league with the devil because of their special "powers" to exhibit fantasy, illusion and impossible feats.  Any power not administered by the Church was labeled as evil.  Theatrical performances were banned for hundreds of years, along with herbalism, midwifery and all kinds field & forest rituals. 
	In 16th century Mexico the Spanish found the Aztecs exhibiting a high-flying stunt.  Four men descended upside-down on ropes from a wheel rotating on top of a 50 foot high post (a trimmed straight live tree).  This spiritual spectacle is still done today.  The flyers play music as they swing down in a slow spiral.  This uniquely combines the prime shamanic symbols of the tree, the pillar or axis, the spiral and the wheel.
	The Aztecs displayed the upside-down art of foot-juggling.  This was also mastered by the ancient Chinese, along with object-balancing, acrobatics and animal training.  The horse was domesticated in the shamanic hotbed of Central Asia.
	The Tibetan state oracle would often bend a hard iron sword in half with his bare hands while in trance.  Fire-walking and fire-eating have been recorded in shamanic contexts all over the planet for thousands of years.  The Native Americans practiced it, as well as poisonous snake-handling, arrow-swallowing, puppetry, ventriloquism, the "shaking tipi" ceremony and numerous other impressive shamanic feats and vision-inducing ordeals.  
	Dolls or puppets were animated and used in divination by Eskimo and the Javanese.  Statues embodying the spirit which possessed the shaman/medium have been revered in China, Tibet, Africa and ancient Egypt.
	"Among the most important objects used by the [Tibetan-Mongol] shamans are the so-called <I>lekan</I>, simple effigies representing spirits...and made of wood, pieces of cloth, and furs.  These effigies are regarded as the receptacle or prison of an <I>ongon</I> [spirit], and in case the latter causes some harm, his representation will be beaten or even destroyed."
	Beautiful intricate sand painting mandalas are used by the Tibetans, the Nagas, and the Hopis for healing and empowerment rituals.  They are destroyed during or after use.  Thread-crosses used by Tibetan and Nepali nagpa lamas for weather-making and demon control are nearly identical to the traditional yarn <I>god's eyes</I> made by the Huichol people of Mexico. 
	The arts originated by the world's shamans include: drumming, music, dance, acrobatics, costuming (& clothes), masks, theater, architecture, models (dolls & mineatures) sculpture & carving, painting, sand-painting, body-painting, tattooing, mudra, sign, seal, & talisman, writing & literature, plant cultivation, astronomy, metallurgy and sea crafts.  Additionally there are the "circus arts": juggling, sleight of hand, illusionism, puppetry, ventriloquism, clowning, rope-walking, fire-eating, sword-swallowing and, of course, animal training.  (Modern shamans can also use photography, audio recording, film, video, computers, holography & CD-ROMs)

And this is exactly the point. So you have created a 4 foot arc free of
pesky people. And then you have whatever people that might normally be off
the floor crowded around you, taking up more space. This is not an issue
at some parties, granted, but at others it can be very annoying.

Maybe for you it is not. I go to parties to relax, not compete. Your
mileage may vary of course.

Competetive isn't bad, but it can take away from a spiritual vibe imo.
Many ravers enjoy the community vibe that transcends toward a state of unity
consciousness where the feeling is that we are all on the same team rather
than competing with one another.
I'd rather do my competing on a sports field, and when I go to rave I like
to try and open up the the oneness of all the energy.  When I'm able to do that
I feel like I tap into an energy source that we all share.
Of course this includes the energy of the circle dancers.  I usually find it
a little more difficult to connect to the community vibe if I feel alot of 
competition going on.

I sense a lack of respect.  

I sense a lack of respect for people who are subscribed to many, many
mailing lists.  If all 10 or so of the mailing lists I was subscribed
to had the same amount of off-topic posts that SFR has, none of them
would be useful.  I would be forced to unsubscribe to them all.

Do you know how many times I have talked to people who would very much
like to be on sfr but can't simply becuase of the volume?  I don't think
you are respecting these people.  Nicole is one of these people.  I think 
all the off-topic posts are keeping more people from joining this wonderful 
community.

The only reason "things will remain the same" is because people have choosen
to keep them the same.  I would quit my belly achin' if the volume on
SFRaves was not denying people access to it.  But that is not the case.
Feel free to post as much NRR stuff as you like, I guess it does not matter
to you if you are keeping people off of sfraves... as long as YOU are having
your fun.  Oh well, its an anarchy so do as you will... nobodys going to stop 
you.

Hi-

 I can't remember who mentioned the web location for the BBC  playlist, but 
it's great.  After spending some time overseas last year, coming back to the 
bay area and not hearing the same music on the radio was a dissappointment.  If 
you're ever in England and you're not able to get out, make sure you listen to 
the Essential Mix.

I wish I knew what lists you were on!  On the lists I am on the 
disscussion of "Signal to Noise Ratio" is an everyday occurrence.

The best thing I can say is:

Do not contribute to the noise by complaining about the noise, that's 
just more noise (about noise).  Fight noise with signal!!  Post about 
the topic of the list, ignore or delete every thing else.

(my first appearance on the list in quite some time)


	Just picked up a pair of MDR-V6's at Fry's for $75.  Thus far, I
am extremely happy with them.  I chose them over the 600's cuz they were
cheaper, and also much lighter/less bulky.

	Good pair of 'phones, wot.

*gulp*

I think we confronted this issue recently. I've said before, and I'll
say it again:

It's a bad idea. Having two lists means everyone will post everything
to both lists (to reach the widest audience), then everyone follows up
by complaining that this message was off-topic for the this list, and
should only be posted to that list, etc. More fighting, more problems,
AND more traffic. In the end, everyone loses.

Examples? The domain policy/DNS admin list on the InterNIC. I received
400+ messages a day once it split into three lists (no kidding!).

Just be respectful of your net.neighbors. Remember that abUSENET
has over 10,000 newsgroups, including places to sound off about
politics, drugs, and "I love you" messages (check out alt.cuddle
sometime, if it still exists).

This only exacerbates the problem.  Instead of one list with lots of
irrelevant stuff flying around, you have two -- people crosspost 
because they are not sure to which list a particular message belongs,
and pretty soon the signal/noise ratio plummets to zero on both groups.

However, it is somewhat amusing to contemplate a discussion group
whose focus is "irrelevant topics".  No one would be able to follow
up on any other post lest they be accused of forming a thread and
thus, being "on topic".

We have two lists here in NYC: 
NYC-Raves@hyperreal.com
and
Off-topic@dewline.com

This works beautifully for us.

On a side note, I have accepted a job in Mountain View, CA, and will be
moving out to the Bay Area in about two weeks.  See you out there!

        I've seen a few dancing genious' who tell a story with their
dancing. I've yet to read my own. And most tell there story to a host of
others. Not quite silent reading time but a story none the less.

     it is rather funny to think of it.  the funny thing about my sfr 
     experience is that i just look at the messages.  every once in a while 
     i feel obligated to respond to a lot of them, but most of the time it 
     is just hitting the delete button (it's much nicer now with cc: mail 
     than it was with pine and a mac classic :( slower than s-it!!!!
     
     perhaps we should all universally, say at 7:30 am tomorrow morning, 
     take a deeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeep breath and all log off and then log on 
     again.  this will reset all of our programming, including the main 
     computer's programming.  everyone will fall back into topical 
     indigestion, but at least eveyone will feel a sense of community.

     But isn't it the NNR stuff from numerous people just saying "Happy 
     Monday" etc. and general chit-chat that makes this list so nice. I 
     mean it's just oozing friendliness! If all we did was discuss raves, 
     raves, and more raves then wouldn't the list loose some of it's warm 
     feeling?

well, I don't think sfraves traffic is any more NRR than any of the other
regional "rave" mailing lists, at least not compared to socal-raves (which
gets *much* more traffic).

I think the problem is that not everyone agrees on what sfraves should be. 
some people wanna read party reviews. others are just concerned with the
music.  others want to discuss "rave culture".  some people just want the
attention and to see their name on the screen. there are many peripheral
topics that come up, and it's tough to come up with any kind of consenus
on what belongs on sfraves.  the "topic" hasn't been clearly defined. 

fyi, here's the "official" word from sfraves.info: 

" Appropriate topics include: announcements of upcoming events;  reviews
of previous shows/DJ's/new records, etc; discussion about SF-related and
rave- culture-related topics, like smart drinks; discussion about
rave-related stories on TV/in the newspaper, etc. Ideally we should try
and stay away from, "Hey, did you catch that Orbital song on "Beverly
Hills 90210" last week?"  stuff, or from over-generalizing ourselves: "Can
Depeche Mode be considered "techno"?  ", etc. But, other than that, I want
it to be pretty free form. The list should _not_ be about rave scenes in
other parts of the world; an occasional post about a huge megaevent in LA
or a monthly report on the scene in other cities might be okay, but
remember there was a reason this is called SFRaves; if you want to start a
mailing list for your area, ask your sysadmin, as that was all I had to
do. If that fails, there's alt.raves, the USENET newsgroup, where you can
post just about anything you want. " 

I agree there is a problem, and I think everyone should re-read the
sfraves statistics that were generated recently and think about what they
can do (or not do) to improve the s/n ratio on sfraves (send me mail if
you would like me to forward them to you)... maybe if the numbers were
generated and posted monthly it would help keep people in check...

When I went to Spundae on Labor Day weekend, the main room was hopping.  I
knew what kind of vibe to expect so I put on my biggest smile, my silver
sneakers, and prepared to dance my heart out.  I ignored the women putting
on make-up in the bathroom, the ones adjusting their skin tight clothing,
the men without shirts wearing baseball hats, and dodged a few
ass-grabbers.  After that the I danced myself to sheer exhaustion driven
by Laurent Garnier.  I was pleasantly surprised at the crowd actually
because besides the air filled with ego-boosting and sexual tension,
everyone was there to have a really great time.  

What most impressed me was the dance floor.  I'm not good at estimating
numbers, but maybe there was over 500 people on the dance floor (whatever
it was it was a huge amount).  Although the vibe was somewhat misdirected
at times, the amount of people generating it was intense.  I would love to
experience that amount of people with a more directed vibe.  Imagine tons
of sweaty bodies totally going off and having an amazing time, totally
happy with the space they are in and happy every other person is sharing
it with them.  Experiencing this has made me want to check out a massive
to see if I can find even a glimpse of that kind of vibe.  The thought of
dancing in unison with thousands of other people seems like such the
full-on erotic, go all out, terrific kind of dream.  I'm waiting for my
next Gathering or other similar party to experience this!!

You don't have to work at it to be "good."  Anyone who can move is "good."
I was gonna say anyone who can move their limbs, but then I remembered my
friend in a wheelchair who could dance some mean steps without her legs
ever touching the ground!!

Actually, I find that quite cool.  I prefer to dance from the heart and
not think about showing off.  But, then again, some of us are
exhibitionists and some of us are voyeurs.  It's all human nature.

I disagree, we started this off-topic list in NYC, and traffic dropped by
*75%* on NYC-raves.  NYC raves is now about: party announcements, reviews
of parties, and discussions about DJs/producers/music.  All of the
"friendly" msgs are on off-topic (i.e. political debates, what we do at
work, funny things we see in NYC).  It's a mailing list for a group of
friends in the NYC area and we'll even post our plans for the night, or
whatever.

I think that someone just has to take the initiative to *start* an
off-topic list.  The rest just follows... ;)

i like  Mars Entertainment <mars@hyperreal.com> at ccstmp' s attitude about 
this.  Focusing on a solution to the problem can create a mastermind '3rd mind' 
that could find many solutions to many problems if properly accessed.

Hey y'all.  I want to pass this along, because I think it's important to
all of us.  We all love and need water, in various degrees.
Love, your aquarian friend,
shamini

*************************************************************************
 About two weeks ago, a horrible bill (SB 649) SPONSORED BY THE OIL
 INDUSTRY passed both houses of the California legislature which removes
 many of the penalties and liabilities assessed corporations and firms that
 pollute California's water resources due to oil spills and similar mishaps
 in California.  This bill is opposed by the California Dept of Fish and
 Game, the District Attorney's Association of California, the Sierra Club,
 the Leaque of Women Voters, Common Cause, and many papers have written
 editorials urging Wilson to veto it.  
 
 IT IS NOW SITTING ON GOV. PETE WILSON'S DESK. HE HAS MONDAY TO EITHER VETO
 IT OR SIGN IT.  His press spokesperson has said Wilson hasn't decided yet
 to veto it or sign it so it's extremely important for all those living in
 California (and those who want to help California keep their water
 unpolluted) to contact the Governor's office AS SOON AS POSSIBLE for the
 decision could be made anytime.
 
 THE PHONE NUMBER TO GOV. WILSON'S OFFICE IS: (916) 658 2793
 
 THE BILL IS:	SB 649  (ASK HIM TO VETO IT)
 
 YOU CAN CALL ANYTIME (DAY OR NIGHT, WEEKDAY OR WEEKENDS) and leave a
 message (his office reviews all calls during the day so don't worry your
 message will be heard by his office).  Don't say anything bad about the
 governor or any decisions he's made that you disagree with or else this
 may just cause him to sign this horrible bill.  YOUR CALL JUST MIGHT MAKE
 THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HIM SIGNING IT AND HIM VETOING IT SO DON'T DELAY
 AND PLEEEESE CALL RIGHT THIS MINUTE!!! 
 
 The Sacramento Bee wrote a nice editorial urging Wilson to veto it.  I
 don't have the editorial but I have an article on it from the Sacramento
 Bee that i will now print.  Here it is:

Hi!

 Well as Greg is not supposed to work and the rest of the crew hasn't 
posted yet I've taken it upon myself to inform the list of waz happin'.

 On Saturday the 28th, Harmony and Hundred Acre Woods present a special 
B-Day party. It is dedicated to Greg Sandler, one of the founders of 
Harmony 3 years ago. He is the hardest workin', most humble DJ that I 
know and has so influenced and supported a segment of the underground 
that most of us love. HE IS NOT TO WORK ON THIS PARTY!!! IF YOU SEE HIM 
WORKING ON THIS ONE STOP HIM!!

 Party is in SF and will go from 9pm to 6am. DJs are;

Trent
Dano
Cloud
Minor Minor 
Ethan

With a special [short] set from Greg

Ambient room will be taken cared of by Dionysus Dreams and friends.

Map point is mandantory; call the info lines for more details:


[408]486.9591     [408]450.3044    [415]263.4885


 Again this is a benefit for Omar and his family. As Omar is in a coma, 
he can't be transfered to another hospital. His Mom flies out to see him 
twice a week and this creates a severe drain on the families finances.

 I personally would like to thank everyone out there who has helped Greg 
and the Crew and especially those of you who have helped make Dionysus 
Dreams a reality. Without the hard workers and the appreciative ravers we 
never would have been able to do any of this.  Thank you all.


Hugz,


Ran @ Dionysus Dreams

My aologies for being so tardy. I haven't had the time to do this for the 
last three days. Charity on Sunday at San Jose was great. Excellent time, 
excellent music. The experience was very interactive because we helped 
set up and pack up and stuff. Got to meet David, Libby, Adam, Robert, 
Jay, Heidi, Philip, Lucas etc. Lucas, Philip, and Adam were kind enough 
to have us over to their house and to feed us, and play an ambient set
in their living room with the cool black lighting and other eye candy 
around. I wanted to thank everybody involved with that for the wonderful 
time. 
Until next time

Dear Eric,

I feel I need to apologize for making some harsh statements to you in
a previous post... espcially implying that you don't respect people.

I know you have the utmost respect for everyone...

Sometimes I get worked up over insignifigent things while online.  It
is probably because I forget that that there is a real person on the other
side of that cold screen that some of us spend our days in front of.

Yes, I know this whole discussion has wasted far more bandwidth than
the origanal post... sorry sfr, but I needed to set the record streight
with Eric.

Hi all!

 I'm having some minor difficulty getting to our site for the party on 
Friday. I want to go up Friday and set up some stuff early so that the 
show will still be awesome yet I can rest on Saturday and play a 
mind-blowing set Saturday night.

 The deal is this; we only have from 4 to 6 pm on Friday to work. I would 
like to leave Santa Cruz at 1 pm, stop in Saratoga for supplies, then 
head to the City for set up. Then head back to SC for some rest. The ride 
should be in SC no later than 12:00 so I can grab my gear. If you pay 
your own gas then you get in to the party for free. If you help set up 
and tear down on Sat./Sun. then we will give you gas money.

 This a great chance for you newbies who want to get involved to do so. 
We like to work with the same people so if you work out for this show we 
will definately call you for future events {cause we ain't stoppin' now!}.

 I can be reached here or at work between 8 and noon on Friday. 
work; [408].459.4421


Cheers!


Ran @ Dionysus Dreams

YES!

1.      everybody please put NRR in your subject headings when dealing with
NRR material.

2.      anyone out there who doesn't know what filtering is, or your mail
reader doesn't seem to support it, please email me (or a number of other
people on this list) and ASK! i'll point you in the right direction.

love,

Thanks for everyone who's been helping with info.  I haven't had much
time to pick up stuff myself recently, so this calendar is the product
of all of your help.  Please keep sending updates, and any new stuff
you come across.  

This weekend, I'm missing stuff for Friday, but I'm intrigued by 
SuperSensonic on Saturday.  Fantasy Island has a huge lineup but
with an equally huge flyer...  Stop by the Hemp Festival if you
aren't already hip to the medicinal marijuana proposition.

Subject: My B-Day party this Saturday!!! (BSP)
Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

Hello everyone!!!

        I am so fucking happy right now!!! I finally got my computer back!!!
(Mucho thanks to Brendan!!! Thanks Brendan!!!) 

        Anyways, I thought the first thing to do would be to post about this
Saturday's party!!! So here it is...

        Harmony and 100 Acre Woods present...

                                       "Stinky's Big Birthday Bash Bonanza"

        Dj's:           Cloud - Trent - Ethan - Minor Minor - Dano - Greg =)

        Ambient Room:     Dionysus Dreams


        This party is a hard core fundraiser for Omar! We have donated a lot
of money to Omar's mother, but she still could use a lot more. So we are
giving a $5 (maybe more) donation for every person that comes through the
door!!! That means you!!! So you should come and support our brother Omar!!!
The admission cost for the party has not been decided, (or at least shared
with me yet). But it is not up to me on this one. I have been told that I am
not to work, think, or do any strenuous activities at this party. So I
really don't know many of the details for this one. (Which is kinda cool!) 

        In any case, this party is gonna be really cool!! This will be the
first Harmony that I have ever not worked and been able to just sit and
chill at!!! I am stoked!!! (Fuck yeah!!!) There wil be a mandatory map point
close by the location. So call the info lines to get the directions and
stuff!!! There is a maximum capacity for the location, but honestly I don't
think you'll have a problem getting in as long as you get to the map point
early. I believe the map point opens up at 8:30- 9pm and will close when
enough tix have been sold. The party will start @ 9pm. (no, really) Just get
there early to avoid disappointment!!! I would love to see all of you there,
and for those of you whom I never have a minute to talk to, sit my ass down
a have a chat!!! I can't wait!!!

                        (408)486-9591   -    (408)450-3044    -    (415)263-4885
                             Harmony                       BP
Hunny

Peace, love and positivity,

I really could care less about what happens at the white house travel
office. This is just a bunch of republican muckraking. As far as I'm
concerned, they should clean-sweep the place every 4-8 years anyways,
just to prevent any kind of entrenched bribery/extortion/backscratching
from taking root. "Friends from <wherever the incumbant is from>" is
the way washington runs, so nothing out of the ordinary here. I'm sure
similar stuff could be found w/r/t Reagan and Bush. Hell, much worse
stuff really, e.g. the CIA's Role (while Bush was the head of the CIA,
and later VP) in importing cocaine into the US to support the contras
and other "anti communist" covert wars throughout the world.  The
CIA/Cocaine/Contra connection is only hitting the mainstream press
right now, but it's been a well known subject that was snuffed out of
the press while Bush was anywhere near Washington. The CIA is
all-powerful -- and "mysterious death" has accompanied many reporters
who have linked and shown evidence for the CIA/drug connection (e.g.
Mabe Russel in the 1980's).  Anybody thinking we're living in a
democracy has been watching too much TV.

>How about illegally obtaining hundreds of FBI files in order to gain
>information about his enemies, the scope of which is much greater than
>anything that caused Nixon to resign.   (A Nixon staffer went to jail
>for obtaining ONE FBI file.)

This is typical Washington SNAFU (situation normal all fucked up) and
has been going on for years -- for almost the full 50 year reign of J
Edgar Hoover as the Republican shadow-president while he was the head
of the FBI. Hoover's FBI "investigated" plenty of republican policial
opponents, especially civil rights leaders and anti-vietnam protesters
during The Johnson and Nixon administrations. The FBI had secret dirt
on both Kennedy brothers, McGovern, Martin Luther King, Malcolm X, and
they used this information to play dirty politics for the Republicans.
Nixon and Ford were more than happy to have the FBI doing their dirty
work outside the beltway while they had their own hit squads doing
their dirty work inside (Watergate). Lets not ever forget the legacy of
deceit that the Republicans have fostered.

--------------------

I personally think Clinton is just a republican in democrat's clothing
and I will not vote for him either (even though I naively voted for him
the first time around). He is a traitor to the progressives that helped
put him in power, and I'm tired of him pandering to the right-wingers
and fascist-christians in this country that are peddling deceit, hate,
and  capital accumulation under the guise of morality and
right-thinking. Even though it's a wasted vote, I'm voting for Ralph
Nader and the Green Party. Representative democracy was never meant to
be a choice between two "lesser of two evils" putz-candidates. I
suggest you and your friends all vote for whichever candidate best
represents your views, unless you've found something particularly
endearing about Dole or Clinton. 

PS: if Dole wins because you do this -- personally, I don't think
anybody will notice the difference, except that it might be easier to
buy/sell cigarettes and alchohol, the price of cocaine will drop, and
heroin will become even more available as the republican US-oil buddies
will be able to get a stronger foothold in Myanmar (Burma) by helping
the fascist dictatorship capitalize on their cash crops -- Oil and
Heroin. Of course, in the US, they'll build more jails as it's hard to
make drug-sales profitable and politically actionable unless you can
keep prices high, supplies inexhaustible, and pay lots of police and
prison guards to jail those unfortunate enough to be caught in the
middle of this...  And you have a ready-made "problem" that heroic
republican politicians can "solve" -- a conventient snow-job to cover
up the fact that we don't need politicians in the first place. Your tax
dollars at work.

Aside from the deleterious effects of alchohol/tobacco/cocaine/heroin
and other drugs, this is the ultimate reason why you should "just say
no" -- because you're helping put money into the hands of murderers and
politicians. Don't be a dupe -- thinking is the best drug, and it's not 
illegal yet!

I'm not so sure about that anymore.  
First there was much bellyaching about raves which cost over $15.
Now some of the best raves (Harmony & Chrysalis for example) always 
charge $15 or more and no one bats an eye.  

When the Gathering happens, people on this list bitch to the ends of the 
earth because of the cost. ($20-$25).  They want to see the books 
opened.  But not one person questions the costs of other raves which have 
the same price tag.  Some are very obvious of what the costs are for (ie: 
a benefit for someone who has been injured).  I believe the Gathering has 
put on benefit parties for Malachy, yet people still gripe about Martin's 
events.  I'm just wondering about you folks.  Why bitch about one party 
and not another?  Is is purely the people who go?  I avoid parties such 
as Fantasy Island and Juggernot, and I have my specific reasons:  I 
prefer the folks who attend the not-as-advertised raves such as Friends & 
Family, etc. because most of my friends & sfravers (same thing!) attend 
these raves.  

And then we come to the sheer numbers of people who attend.  When we say 
a "small underground rave"  what exactly does that mean?  I heard that 
the last Harmony party had either 1,000 or damn near close.  No, it isn't 
2,500, but that doesn't sound small and underground anymore. 

I am not criticizing ANY promoters in this post: you all do a wonderful job!
I am just confused at the focus of the bitching and griping that goes on 
and what exactly constitutes "small underground party" vs. a "massive"
You all seem so quick to condemn.....

love,
Amy

That's why I never miss a Gathering, adn I try not to miss Basics either, 
although I have missed the last few.   But never a Gathering.  Hell, I 
even passed up Friends & Family for the 3 Year Anniversary in '94! :)

The apartment is spacious, and includes roof access and a pool table. 

It's at 21st & Bryant, it will be $600 each room. I need people who can put
down money for the lease before November, but can move in any time starting
now.

If want to know about me, or anything else about the place, e-mail me.

Thanks,
David

 Perhaps one reason that H3 was the last is because it was getting so big. 
I know some people were feeling pressure to create a better party each 
time with Harmony. Which I think is just silly. I say, create the type of 
party you want if you are throwing parties. [sigh] I'm going to miss Harmony.

Sorry for the non rave related post, but I thought this was funny.  This 
is from Oct. Detail's Magazine:

The Doc Pound
Problem: Dr. Dre's new record label, Aftermath Entertainment, needs a 
catchier name.  
Solution: Ask the Doctors for suggestions....

Dr. Strange, Master of the Mystic Arts: Astral Plane Platters
Dr. Joyce Brothers, Psychologist: Rock Around the Clock with the Doc 
Records
Dr. Doom, Nemesis of the Fantastic Four: Castle Doom Cuts
Dr. Judy, Author of the Compete Idiot's Guide to Dating: Eros Dreaded
Dr. John, Blues Pianist: Prescription Dre, Painkiller Records, or Ether

Have a Happy Friday!!

Hello,

If "NRR:" is used in the Subject line, then there is no problem with
non-rave-related posts making the volume so high that it is impossible
for people to read and follow sfraves.

The only difference between using "NRR:" and having two physically
separate lists is that people who don't want both types of posts end
up receiving twice as much volume in their mailbox.

I know that 5 years ago, that would have been a problem, many people
were paying per kb of mail or for time - which worked out to being the
same thing in the end.

SO, are the NRR posts a problem because they make the other posts
harder to find ( which is solved by using "NRR:" in the Subject line )


OR

is the sheer kilobyte volume of sfraves messages a problem for people
( ie not is it a minor nuisance, but is it a problem ) ?


Cheers,

Ken                         <*>

[ to sfraves list ]

 Although I'm still debating it , I feel that it's almost certain that
I'll be going to the HARVEST MOON freebie tonight. Depends on the
location - living in Sunnyvale, I'm less inclined to drive way up
north of SF.

 Anyway, if I go, I'll be wearing my new Red Wing steel toed shoes.
These are the ones I suspect started my heel problem on my left foot,
but I'll be using them with extra Dr. Scholl's foot padding. Otherwise,
no other description except that I'm a 41 year old asian-american male,
who'll be wearing various layers of clothing depending on the site
and the wind chill factor and ambient temp and humidity and the heat
generated by shaking it in the dance area!

 See you (?) folks there ...

There's an excellent ambient-type show called Neptune Currents on KKUP
(91.5, located S Bay but with a pretty good range) Sunday mornings 8-11.
It's a bunch of different beatless stuff, with a lot of acoustic, or at
least non-synthetic, ambient done with guitars, digderidoo, flute,
whatever.  Mysterious early synth music too, lots of seventies stuff.
Great listening for when you get home.

KKUP has another ambient show Sundays at midnight that's a little more
electronic and beaty, sometimes drifting all the way to a trip-hop feel.

Can anyone suggest any good record shops to visit, or anywhere to go on 
Saturday night (tomorrow) in SF?  (I'm really after trance and techno, rather 
than house or breakbeat.....)

Thanks in advance for any info....

to my sfraves friends -
sorry to spam the entire list with this, but i only felt like writing it

next time i see you - i think it's for the best, but that isn't really

Hey, ever been curious where some of our goofy slang comes from? I
came across this one at:
http://www.sci.kun.nl/thalia/rapdict/

phat 

1) (adj) Great, addictive.

2) (adj) If a girl was phat, she had Plenty o' Hips And Thighs, in
other words PHysically ATtractive; old slang. Think 60's or early 70's
here. A bit more modern: Pussy, Hips And Tits.

Interesting how things mutate.

Steve

Beatles for the Computer Age!

Eleanor Rigby

Eleanor Rigby
Sits at the keyboard -
And waits for a line on the screen
Lives in a dream

Waits for a signal
Finding some code
That will make the machine do some more.
What is it for?

All the lonely users, where do they all come from?
All the lonely users, why does it take so long?

Guru MacKenzie
Typing the lines of a program that no one will run;
Isn't it fun?

Look at her working,
Munching some chips as she waits for the code to compile;
Where is the style?

All the lonely users, where do they all come from?
All the lonely users, why does it take so long?

Eleanor Rigby
Crashes the system and loses 6 hours of work;
What is it worth?

Guru MacKenzie
Wiping the blood off her hands as she walks from the grave;
Nothing was saved.

All the lonely users, where do they all come from?
All the lonely users, why does it take so long?

Write in C

When I find my code in tons of trouble,
Freinds and  colleagues come to me,
Speaking words of wisdom:
'Write in C.'

As the deadline fast approaches,
And bugs are all that I can see,
Somewhere, someone whispers:
'Write in C.'

Write in C, Write in C,=20
Write in C, oh, Write in C.
LOGO's dead an buried,
Write in C.

I used to write a lot of FORTRAN,
for Science it worked flawlessly,
Try using it for graphics,
Write in C.

If you've just spent nearly 30 hours
Debugging some assem-bl-y,
Soon you will be glad to
Write in C.

Write in C, Write in C,
Write in C, oh, Write in C.
Only wimps use BASIC.
Write in C.

Write in C, Write in C,
Write in C, oh, Write in C.
Pascal won=92t quite cut it.
Write in C.

Write in C, Write in C,
Write in C, oh, Write in C.
Don't even mention COBOL
Write in C.

 "Dolphin and Friends" I believe was last night ( Thurs Eve/Fri Morn ), so
you've already missed it. The one with info at (415) 437-2378 after 2PM is
for tonight ( Friday evening/Sat. morning ).

Subject: DJs wanted
Sender: owner-sfraves@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

Hey all.

Well, I tried to quit sfraves.  Unsubscribed for almost six weeks!  But I
just needed that little fix of 100 e-mails a day, so I am back.

And things have been good while I was gone.  I know you're wondering, "How
could life be good when he was unsubscribed all those cold and lonely
nights", but it is true.  Things are rolling along, and I already need the
community's system.  I have the opportunity to put on a party, but I need
DJs.  Looking for downtempo stuff only.  Trip-hop, stoner beats type stuff,
maybe some acid jazz, but it should have a danceable feel.

So send me your demo tapes!!  Or call me at 415.864.8234 if you need more
info.  The first party is Oct 8 (a Tuesday) and could be a regular thing if
all goes well.

Of course, if you are not a DJ but have suggestions of your favorite
mixologist, send them to me ASAP.  This opportunity came up on me all of
sudden, and I don't have much time to throw it together, obviously.

By the way, I realize some people might object to this, in that I have been
of a long time, and my first post is kinda of BSP.  But i didn't want to go
into other stuff until I get a feel for what people are taling about at the
moment.  Yet, the need for DJs was immediate and I know many people on the
list are always looking for opportunities, so I thought it would be o.k.  I
will take any flack I deserve, but I wanted y'all to know it was not posted
in complete clueless ness.

THANKS.  Lookign forward to hearing from eveyone.

peace & misses......Arkay

Why don't you people grow up! Who gives a rat's ass about NRR post. We are
a community. And whatever is talked about on sfraves is always related
because a raver either likes what was said or is some how involved. If you
don't like it, delete it. This moaning and complaining about NRR post is
stupid as shit.

You don't go up to someone at a rave and say " Your not talking about rave
stuff, I don't want to hear it and you shouldn't be talking about it at a
rave. Most of the people that complain about it just want to be heard and
get email.

If it's important enough to someone on this list to share with others, then
it is Rave related because a ravers is thinking about it.

I think you should stop complaining and get on with your life. I've seen
people on here chew the hell out of someone for some stupid ass post and
then see that same person at a party and expect them to be all lovey dovey
to them.

If you don't want to read something just delete the damn thing. I sometime
don't even read half of the mail on here because the subject just doesn't
move me. Why can't you do the same.

Go ahead and flame me for this post, I really don't give a shit. I love
email. This is part of the reason why in my time period raving was dying.
We all need to get along and stick together and quite complaining about
post that has nothing to do with a party. Don't any of you have a life
other then parties. Since I've been in the 1996 time period, I can't see
how raving latest up to 2095. WE NEED TO GET ALONG AND STOP MOANING.

You all probally think I'm fun of crap about me being from another time
period. Well after Sunday you will never see me again. Except for 3 of you,
you will have been accidently zapped into the year 2094 from what is know
here as 2010. Sorry I'm not telling who, I can't, but you never go back.
The 3 of you CARE to much about the scene to leave it the why it is in
2094.

I agree- I find almost anything a raver has to say is at least entertaining.
I don't mind the high volume, as long as the material is interesting.

Keep your eyes out for me, too.  I'm 6'0" blonde/brown hair big corduroy
pants possibly one of those coolio polyester soccer shirts (a red one this
time with a big "13" on the
back: on saturday night) and probably barefooted if the weather's warm.
Can't miss me, the way I dress.

Hi all!

 Well, I think you all know where I'll be stationed. We are talking 9 
hours of Dionysus Dreams (YUM). Since I have so much room I'll be happy 
to show folks my toys including my analog synth. If anyone enjoys making 
tweaky noises come by and say hi and I'll put some knobs in yo' hands.

 I hope everyone has a PLUR weekend irregardless of where they go!!!  =)



Hugz,


Ran

I've been watching this most recent incarnation of the endless argument
over what exactly sfraves is trying to be with some interest. The
argument has gotten intense, many good points have been raised, but it's
my depressing conclusion that nobody's really paying any attention to
what the other people are saying. In particular, those of you who feel
that you have an innate right to post whatever inane crap pops into your
heads have been particularly irritating me.

Look, there are very obviously two groups of us here: those of us who
think of sfraves as a community forum, and those of us who think of
sfraves as a place to discuss raves in the San Francisco area. The two
different groups have very different aims and needs, and it's getting to
the point where it seems like the second group is not only getting
ignored by the first, but straight-out insulted. Tim's and Eric's recent
messages are particularly egregious examples of this.

I'm a reasonably social person, and raving, DJing, and promoting are very
important parts of my life. I have a lot of good friends in the San
Francisco rave scene, and I'd be lying if I said that the internet and
sfraves had had nothing to do with that. However, I'm also busy, and I
receive a _lot_ of email. I've gotten ~300 messages so far today, and I'm
sure that I'll have received somewhere in the neighborhood of 1000 by the
end of today. The frightening thing is how much of it is ABSOLUTELY
USELESS banter from sfraves.

Yes, I have an email filtering system (mailagent, for those of you who
are curious -- it's a huge perl / C hybrid, but it does lots of stuff in
a reasonably intuitive and extraordinarily powerful way), and I'm
automatically chopping huge swathes through my incoming sfraves mail. But
that makes me uncomfortable, because I know that hyperreal is going to
the trouble of sending me these messages, and consuming network bandwidth
to do it that could have been better used for something else.

I like a lot of you a lot, but the internet is _not_ somebody's comfy
living room. Resources are finite and the fact that we _all_ get to hear
_everybody's_ earth-shattering pronouncements, never mind how insipid or
banal they may be really bugs me. The simple fact is that I don't think
that it's unreasonable for me to not want to have to deal with all of
this junk email, and I do NOT feel like I'm being a whiner for pointing
this out. I feel like I've been patient with sfraves and the people on it
beyond any reasonable expectation.

So, besides merely venting, I'd like to point this out: if you still feel
like you want to talk about anything and everything, PLEASE be assiduous
in your use of the NRR header, and remember that someday Hyperreal may
have to be moved or shut down because of the intense amounts of bandwidth
that it consumes (Organic only bestows network largesse upon Hyperreal
because Organic doesn't currently need it). I've started automatically
deleting anything from sfraves with NRR in the heading, and it's doing
wonders for my sfraves reading experience. You can all talk about
whatever the hell you want. I'm going to read about raves.

How about this:

1) people who want to post NRR stuff please *always* use NRR to satisfy
those with filters
2) people who don't want to read NRR stuff please get some filters 
running
3) everyone else: stop bitching

I'm sick of reading this stupid debate. It wastes more of my time
and more of hyperreal's system load/network utilization than any
other thread on this list. (and I apologize for contributing to
the discussion)

There's no solution. There are definitely two camps to this, so can
we please compromise?

I'm sooooo sick of reading people argue about what's appropriate, not

Hey, I know you!  Are you the guy with the notty hair and Ming dynasty-era
mustache, who wears lopsided glasses and smokes a pipe upside down and
backwards?

Think I saw you at BP once.

Well, okay, maybe not the absolute bomb, but it was such a clever play on
words. ;)

When you first enter the El Rio it looks like a somewhat seedy Mission
bar... but once you make your way past the pool tables in the back, you
find a very nice outdoor patio.  There they had some good Food Not Bombs
info, and a whole lot of good veggie food.  I suspect this is the same
food they give out free, every day, 7 days a week... many more times a day
on some days.  This included veggie burgers, chips and salsa, brownies,
Odwalla, black beans and a bunch of other goodies.

>From the patio you could check out the dance area, where the F-8 boys
were spinning.  They were spinning their typical trance set that had
everybody moving, despite a sound system that was kinda thin on the low
end.  By 11 there was a good, friendly vibe going, both on the dance
floor and on the patio.  It was a pretty nice evening to be outside.

The food not bombs people seem pretty cool.  Saw a lot of Harvard shirts...
its good to see that school produces people who have other goals besides
bribing the government to make laws that allows their totalitarian 
corperations make more money with no regard to how they are actually
affecting the human species as a whole.

Food, trance, a good cause... fun night.

ohhh...come on...yeah right...1000 messages and so much of it is sfraves

1) I agree.

For me, a small underground party has lees than 300 people and costs less 
than $10.  A "regular" party (if there is such a thing) is from 300 - 500 
people and costs between $15 - $20.  Anything larger / more expensive is 
a massive, although most massives here automatically become over 1000 
people without even trying :)

Mind you i have been to some massives that were less than $15 and some 
"small underground parties" that were $20 (okay, ONE, and i knew the 
promoters were money-grubbing twerps but i went anyways) ....

In a more broad sense though think about what 70 x 450 equals?  31,500.  
Remember this for my response below.

You may think that you are being humourous, but I really doubt that the 
people who volunteer hours upon hours month after month, working to bring 
the techno/electronic music/rave community a wealth of *free* 
information, would appreciate that kind of sarcasm.  I for one don't.  I 
maintain several links pages on hyperreal, and I put a lot of time into 
them (i get 5-10 emails a day and check each one individually) I'd rather 
not see hyperreal have to retire because all of poor use of resources.

I imagine if hyperreal had to pay for its own bandwidth it would cost 
well over a $1000/month.  That's a nice donation from the company that is 
hosting it, we should all respect that *privilege* to have the kind of 
bandwidth available that we do.

I think if you were to do a little research, this wouldn't be as easy as 
you think it would be.  Do you know of many spare T1's preinstalled that 
would be able to handle the load hyperreal creates?  I'm not flaming you, 
I just don't think you understand how much bandwidth and care hyperreal 
needs.

        Get down and get funky. Maybe I can get a couple of my  friends to
go with me to this. But last night my mom sucked and said she didn't want to
have to stop to get gas tomorrow so I couldn't use her car (mine's a
gasser). Maybe tonight? Hopefully. If I do, I'll most likely be wearing a
black/white baseball underjersey, big bright blue party animal shirt, red
jacket, blues, a fisherdudes's hat, and shoes of course. Also underwear
socks n all. CK mostly. 
        Sounds like fun right??? I have to bring the right friends cuz a
couple really drag me down when we try to do much of anything.

I want to thank all of you who came to El Rio last night.  The party was a
big success by Food Not Bombs standards.  We raised aproximately $400 after
expenses.  That is a lot of rice and beans (a pity we have other expenses,
too).  The DJ's were great, agreeing to play for close to nothing, and
spinning great sets.  Special thanks to Tomc@t for taking the first slot,
and having to contend with a nearly empty floor.

A lot of people put in a lot of hard work, and it paid off.  We hope to put
on more such parties in the future.

My biggest regret was failing to meet anybody from the list.  Thought my
bright yellow shirt was a giveaway.  Course, its mainly my own fault for
enjoying the music so much, that I was unable to stop dancing long enough to
socialize.  There is a small chance I will make it to FM tonight.  If so,
I'll make a bigger effort to find y'all.

Peace and love,
Kerry

PS re: Troy-

there are no Harvard grads in FNB, although not because we wouldn't accept
any!  The majority of the group is working class (mainly service industry),
under employed, unemployed, on General Assistance, and, of course students.
But the group is pretty diverse, and there are people from all walks of life
to be found in the FNB family (from the homeless to those who work in high
tech--some even own computers :>) ).

Thanks for coming, Troy.  Hope to figure out who you are sometime.

What the heck are you talking about, 12 Monkeys. Did you go to a zoo or

One last thought about this NRR as well as other crap. Putting NRR in the
Subject is great. That's what should happen. I also think that the use of
the good old CC:  (for those with no clue that Carbon Copy)

I think people should lay off CC: sfraves when posting. Some of it's ok.
But almost every post, come on. I love getting email, but hal the post are
usually someone yelling at someone else which causes someone else to get
involved.

Final note on this matter is put NRR on subject line and quite complaining
about NRR post. And quite using the CC: to sfraves so much and just reply
to the originator. That would cut half the "crap" mail people are
complaining about. I think that most of the bandwidth that's being used is
because of the CC: to sfraves and everyone leaving the entire email message
there replying to in the text.  If there wasn't any NRR post this list
would be almost like the Calendar and alot of people probally wouldn't be
on here. I've met alot of great people when I replied to an NRR post. So
the NRR post are a big part of this "Community". Just stop using the Carbon
Copy: sfraves so much.

Enough of this.

I suggest getting the MkLinux version 2 CD-Rom from Prime Time Freeware
(http://www.ptf.com/) -- specifically http://www.ptf.com/ptf/products/MKLP/.  
It is generally very helpful to be able to free up your hard-disk for your
own files/system files, and be able to load up Linux sources, as well as
other app sources or even app binaries "as needed" from the CD-ROM, rather
than having to fetch them over a slow internet connection.

I haven't tried MkLinux because I don't have any macintosh harware, but I
can tell you that when all those cheap 2-processor 250Mhz PowerPC clones
start coming out, MkLinux on those boxes is going to kick the shit out of
SGI, Sun and Microsoft/Intel offerings, esp. for web servers. I hope Linux
smacks the living hell out of those greedy & arrogant wankers. I've even
heard rumors that Apple will be putting out their macintosh desktop with
MkLinux as the underlying OS. (Anybody wanna confrirm that??).

FYI -- Prime Time Freeware seems like a pretty reputable company and
they're decent-seeming folks and charge very fair prices for their goods. I
know this because they included some of my software on their Prime Time
Freeware for Unix distribution and they contacted me to ensure that it was
ok to do so, and even gave me two distributions of their disks for free.
I've also heard good things about them through people they haven't
"comp'd".

PS: I personaly run Linux on a Pentium laptop and it rocks. 

PPS: Rave-related: Mr Goodwrench ofn KFJC (89.7) is playing (Fri 10PM-2AM)
an interesting techno show comparing Detroit Techno (transmat, derrick may,
etc) with English techno (Kurt DeGeorgio, ART Records). very educational
lesson on the roots o' techno and Detroit/UK cross-pollination. It's the
bee's knees!

                                    MKLINUX
                                       
         Apple Computer is funding the development of MkLinux,       a
   Mach-based version of the Linux operating system.       MkLinux currently
   runs       on the 6100 / 7100 / 8100 (NuBus, PowerPC 601) series       of
   Power Macintosh computers,       as well as most recent Intel-based PCs.
     Apple intends to continue development,       adding support for at least
   the PCI-based Power Macintosh       and PowerPC Platform (formerly CHRP).
   
   
         Mach has been ported to a number of single and multiprocessor
   platforms.       Ports of MkLinux to these platforms could thus emerge
   fairly rapidly.       Meanwhile, the PowerMac version of MkLinux gives
   interested parties       the ability to work with the system.
   
       Please Note:            Neither Apple nor PTF is offering any kind of
   direct support       for any of the MkLinux releases.       Do not call,
   write, or email either firm asking for help!
   
         Apple has set up http://www.mklinux.apple.com[1]       as the focal
   point for MkLinux information.       See this site for late-breaking news,
   documentation,       mailing list information, updates, patches, etc.
   By obtaining the current distribution and tracking the Web site,
   interested parties should be able to keep up with (and assist!)       the
   development of this new operating system.
   
Developer Release 2

         More than 4000 copies of MkLinux DR1 have been distributed,
   establishing an active community       of experimentally-minded users and
   developers.       Many of these people are already wearing our
   T-shirts and sweatshirts[2],       featuring the cute MkPenguin mascot.
   
           With DR2, Apple is making MkLinux accessible       to a wider
   community of users.       As a "Beta quality" release, DR2 provides:
   

      * greatly increased performance       * improved reliability

      * new and improved drivers            * more Mach features

      * a larger command set                * and many bug fixes


           In short, if you've been waiting for a good time to try out MkLinux,
         this is it!       (If you're one of our stalwart crew of early
   adopters,       using a hacked and patched copy of DR1,       this is a
   great time to upgrade!)
   
           DR2 is a snap to install.       It contains pre-installed versions
   of the usual Linux commands,       including X11R6.1 and a full GNU
   development suite.       A large collection of RPM archives is also
   included,       in both source and binary format.             Note:       At
   present, MkLinux only runs on the 6100 / 7100 / 8100       (NuBus, PowerPC
   601) series of Power Macintosh systems,       including some 61XX Apple
   Performa models.       PCI / 604 support is expected in late Fall.
   
   
   
Some Bad News, Some (Very) Good News...

         DR1 was produced by Apple and distributed by PTF.       DR2, in
   contrast, is a joint effort.       This means that we must charge more:
   $20/disc       ($14 each in quantity 10+).       Fortunately, we have also
   instituted a number of discount offers.       It is almost certain that one
   of these will meet your needs.       For detailed information, see our
   Ordering[3] page.
   
Consumer Alert!

           A disc entitled "MkLinux Fall 1996" is being sold in CD-ROM stores.
        It appears to be a "drag-copy" of the DR1 disc,       plus the July 8
   FTP update (not applied).       In any event, it is not the same (DR2) disc
   PTF is selling.       Commercial bias aside, we recommend that you avoid
   this product.       It does not contain the new "baseline"  version of
   MkLinux,       has no added value to speak of, and will not be supported by
   Apple.
   
The MkLinux reference release is coming soon!

         Prime Time Freeware has been selected       to publish Apple's
   reference release of MkLinux.       "MkLinux: Microkernel Linux for the
   Power Macintosh",       being edited with the assistance and support of
   Apple,       will contain a variety of reference material       about Linux,
   Mach, MkLinux, and the Power Macintosh.
   
         This product is scheduled for release in December 1996.       For
   detailed information, see our       Ordering[4] page.       To receive an
   emailed publication announcement,       contact info@ptf.com[5].

This may have been true 5 or 6 years ago, but it is far from true
nowadays.

This "conserve bandwidth" thing was only meaningful back when modems
were 2400 baud and hard drives had 20MB.

Nowadays, the network bandwidth that e-mail mailing lists use, is a
small percent of what is used for all the other more important uses
that dominate the Internet:

- Downloading the latest browser version 
- Downloading erotic images
- Making a long distance telephone call over the Internet using
Internet Phone software
- Listening to a radio station over the Internet using Real Audio
- Watching an inline MPEG video on a web page
- Playing Nintendo-style games live over the Internet
- IRC chat that uses more bandwidth to discuss the same NRR stuff

        There actually was a message on the VM after about 10 rings. He said
that they'd make it up to everyone.=20
        I didn't have shit to do last night, and I had some friends with me
too. They all wanted to go, they were even going to stay up all night when a
couple had to go to either work at 4:00am that night or a wedding at noon
sat.. We ended up wandering over by the deli (just to see what it was like
there) , and a few nice neighborhoods in SF. We almost went to the palladium
(haha) but one of my friends wouldn't go in even if we payed for everything.
The music sounded ok, and I had waaaaaaay too much energy from these Razor
Ripped drinks I drink when I work out, it also gave my arm and hand some
wierd pains????!!!!=20
        But I really wanted to go to another beach party. When is the next
VIBERATION???=20

Now I want to do something interesting with my girly, any suggestions???

thanks

Hey everyone!

First of all, I hope to see some of you at Massa tonight!  I've heard
Markie play trip hop before at an Out-A-Sight party and I was very
impressed!  Go check him out.

Now, I have a SL-D33 that works perfectly except that records won't play at
33!  It's more like 20 rpm.  So if you need parts, its yours.  The
cartridge fits a 1200.. and I think the turntable plastic cover will also
fit the 1200.  Its yours, but you must take it all!  Gimme a call (415)
647-9760, if you're interested.

Larry, Melissa, and I were planning to go to the party at Mt. Tam, but as
that ceased to be an option, we decided to give The Om Lounge a try.
Before I say anything else I gotta say I enjoyed the live music.  That was
good.  But The Om Lounge had about as much vibe as my 17th Century Lyric
class.  Everyone stood around looking as cool as icebergs, cocktails in
hand, vogueing without even moving a muscle.  I stood there thinking to
myself, 
 
"OOOOOOOOMMMMMM."
 
"OOOOOOOMMMMMMM my god this is so pretentious."
 
"I want to go HOOOOOOMMMMMMMM."
 
So we left in search of the ever-elusive party.  We did a few drive by
hearings, The Bahia, The Top, and decided to just go to the beach and
watch the waves, listen to the original ambient music.  That was nice.  It
was actually a fun night.   :)

The difference between some $20 parties and others is the promoter's
decision. Some promoters will donate all of the proceeds to a "Charity."
Others will buy equiptment so that they can provide a better party next time
(like Gateway) (which is great). Some will spend every last dollar of their
budget on the party, and take a huge chance of losing $. (like Harmony)  And
some will make sure their party makes them a few $. Truth is, I don't know
very many promters that are "getting rich quick", but there are a few.

Now the Harmony 3 year had about 1100 people, and no that is not a small
underground party, but we refrained from making it comercial. We had the
opportunity to involve many record labels and magazines in the promotion of
the party, but fuck that!!! If we can't promote our own party good enough,
than we just suck!!! I would consider the 3 year "underground", just not
"small." Honestly, their is no line between "underground and not," look at
FnF. This party gets sometimes 800+. What's the difference? It is how it is
promoted...

Peace,

Greg =)

What are you basing this on?  The T1 which Hyperreal consumes is more
mail-related than anything else -- web traffic included.  This is a
fact.

For the internet as a whole, I can't agree or refute this.  Care to back
it up?  In Hyperreal's case, on the other hand, e-mailing lists are most
definitely the largest consumer of bandwidth.

However, the main point of this discussion isn't "shut up with your NRR
stuff".

The point is this: when making a post to sfraves, consider that it will
be sent to (at present) 439 other people.  Do all 439 people need to read
what you have to say?  Is it relevant to the sfraves charter you get when
subscribing?

This is about showing some respect for your neighbors.  I am not big on
"PLUR", but I am big on respect.  If you continually shove irrelevant
junk mail into my mailbox via sfraves, then you are showing a distinct
lack of respect for those who joined this list expecting what is described
in the list charter and for those things which make Hyperreal possible in
the first place.

	Sami

btw- I do not buy the argument, "Well, your post is only contributing to
the problem you are complaining about!"  Wrong.  A solution to what I
perceive as a problem will only come about through discussion, not through
pacifism.

With the recent discussions of what should be posted, what is rave-related,
and what is not,
it makes me wonder how many people on this list percieve raving.
Does one consider themselves to be a raver because they go to a rave?
like to dance?
post on sfraves?
Wear "rave clothes"?
Does raving need to have some spiritual significance?

Whether you do or don't consider yourself a "raver", 
what does raving mean to you?

I know this may be very difficult to put into words, 
but I still would appreciate any effort to do so.
After all isn't that some of what this list is for?

This isn't an answer to your question, but it did remind me of
something I saw a couple of days ago that is indirectly related.

A 1965 British movie called "Having a wild weekend" (featuring the
British pop group the "Dave Clark 5") was on TV.  The plot is that two
tv commercial actors run away from the set for the weekend.  They
steal a car and somehow end up at this house in the country where some
long-haired beats/hippies are hanging out.

When the two are asked where they are from, they reply "London".

One of the hippies responds "Oh, you must be London ravers".

Another comments "No, they're weekend ravers" (meaning, of course,
that during the rest of the week they return to normal societal values
and conformity.)

And that was written and filmed well over 31 years ago...


Cheers,

Ken                         <*>

Hey Ravers,

	Nevada Ferguson (a full-time raver) has a room for rent in his
	house in the Richmond district of San Francisco (near 4th and
	California).  Other occupant is Sarah S. (another raver).  How
	could you possibly pass this up? 

	Rent is $320 + 1/3 utilities.  Room is available now.

	If you're interested, call Nevada at 415 668-6212 and leave
	a message in the special mailbox #3.  :)


Groovy.  Bye now.

Sender: owner-sfraves@HYPERREAL.COM
Precedence: bulk

Well, some friends and I kept the faith even though we couldn't get through
to the Harvest Moon number. Wanting to do something killer for our nieghbor's
B-day, we piled into the car here in Monterey. We ambitiously did the drive
over the bridge, calling on a cellular the whole way up, encouraged by a post
that said -just keep trying. Just as we passed over, we finally got through
to hear about the bust.

I felt so bad for all of the promoters. You all seemed so amped about this
one! Also, I was thinking that this would finally be my chance to meet
another lister face to face. 

I must say, my roommate, Kelly, and I are really worried that we'll end up
either being normal people again soon, or that we'll start listening to house
exclusively, since that seems to be that predominant dance music around this
area.
We haven't given up yet, though. I guess it would be easier if we lived
closer to the bay.

Anyway, we went to Haight St. to se if we could scratch up a plan B.
Unfortunately, none of us were familiar with the area, and had no clue. I
have never craved to hold a rave flyer in my hand like the moments we stood,
peering into the windows of the closed shops, seeing piles of them only
inches away. Too bad we couldn't just read the phone #'s and call around for
the info. (Now, I call that DESPERATE for a good time!)

We all ended up driving back home and having pancakes.

I guess I've learned something out of all this, I just don't care to examine
it yet. But, I know that, someday, I'll know my way around and I'll get to
have fun ANY TIME I WANT!

Hello everyone,

Just wanted to announce that Franklin MinorMinor, Darin Marshall, and Seth
Sutekh (myself) will be hosting a RECORD SWAP on Saturday, October 5
from 1-9pm at our beautiful Oakland warehouse.  

We're hoping to give dj's one day to buy, sell, and trade records directly
with other dj's, rather than selling them to a record store for next to
nothing.  You'll also be able to look through other djs' crates and laugh
at all the lame records they bought for full price :)

We will provide pricing supplies, 4 turntables for listening, live
deejaying, snacks, and free guided tours through the Belief Systems
recording studio!

Bringing records to sell/trade is optional, though encouraged. 

If you're interested, send me email and I'll give you directions.  Hope
you can make it!

-Seth

Really? What makes you think that? Do you know the state of the current
Internet? The fact that the big players are scrambling to get OC-3's up
and running, as the DS-3's that much of the Internet is running on simply
cannot handle the load? Load is in fact increasing exponentially, as
people are starting to use telephony and video apps across the wires.

You are making assumptions. While as a general statement what you say is
true as it applies to the Internet at large, it does not follow that this
also applies to the bandwidth that hyperreal.com uses. In order to make
that determination it would require you know how much of the bandwidth
that hyperreal.com uses to distribute the various mailing lists it handles
vs. the rest of the traffic(web, ftp, etc.)

[ to sfraves ]

 Well, I guess the bust of the Harvest Moon event might be considered
a demonstration of the usual rave ( and full moon ) protocol - don't
post directions until just before the event.

 On the other hand, I guess they wanted to have a chance for folks to gather
and get friendly before the light was gone. Too bad.

 My friends and I called before leaving Sunnyvale, so we didn't waste to
any time looking for it. Ended up at the beach and having a lot of good
conversation!

But the original message said:

"because I know that hyperreal is going to the trouble of sending me
these messages, and consuming network bandwidth to do it that could
have been better used for something else."

Maybe he meant "server bandwidth" but he said "network bandwidth".

IF the server used by hyperreal is in danger of being overloaded, the
sfraves list owner should post a message in sfraves saying so, and
then I'm sure, like the community we are, we would adjust our posting
habits accordingly.

However that has not happened yet.   And, unlike any other resource
such as water or energy, bandwidth can't be "saved" and used another
day.   So, it is either available or it isn't.  ( Which, for example,
is why my ISP charges nothing for usage between 1 am and 5 am, because
they have loads of extra bandwidth at that time of day that is just
wasted. )

To summarize my original point, e-mail takes up much less bandwidth
than any of the real-time Internet uses.   I download the whole day's
worth of sfraves in a few minutes, if that.   Probably a small group
of fantatical Internet real-time game players use more Internet
bandwidth than all of sfraves combined.


Cheers,

Ken                         <*>

bandwidth on "the internet" may be increasing exponentially, but it is
not increasing exponentially at hyperreal's host site, organic online,
which was ogd's original point.

again, speaking from real knowledge on the subject, as ogd was, a huge
percentage of the bandwidth used by hyperreal goes to mailing lists.

I used to tow this line, but there are limits to the amout of
interest-filtering that one human can do.  The basic problem I have the
idea of "you can look at the subject line, and delete the message if you
don't like it".  Very rarely does the subject line actually relate or
accurately capture what's in the message, *especially* as the topic goes
on for a number of posts or days.  Worst of all, it encourages an attitude
of "oh, I've already been through all that, I can't waste my time
repeating myself".  If you're wondering why some of us who have been
around for a long time don't post very much, that's probably a good place
to start looking - that kind of attitude means that those who have already
talked through a subject (such as, "is the E in SF cut with heroin?") will
ignore new posts on that topic, even if those new posters have something
interesting to say.  And that's unfortunate, because it essentially
*forces* a turnover on the list; people last 6 months, maybe a year, see
all the different common subjects, and then don't post anymore because
they feel it's all been said already and they're too busy deleting the
posts they think talk about stuff they've already been through to actually
have the energy to contribute to anything.

I think the fact that you, Tim, don't read 1/2 the mail on this list, the
fact that I don't read the list except once every couple of weeks and even
then only cursorily, the fact that many people out there take a very
blase' attitude towards the signal/noise ration, is a *problem*.  I'm not
harshing on you or anyone in particular, because this is a group behavoir
issue.  Like I said, I used to say exactly the same thing, "you can just
delete it", but after experiencing first-hand the act of deleting 975
messages out of the 1000 in the queue, I suddenly realize how unfortunate
this situation is.

I have always wanted SFRaves to be a chatty place; I think the list would
get *extremely* boring if it were just party reviews and music
discussions.  This topic is about a very diverse culture, one which its
participants take to heart very deeply, so I absolutely appreciate the
desire to talk about one's personal life.   

So, what's the answer?  There's no magic bullet here, folks.  It's your
list, ultimately.  There's not a big topic I felt shouldn't have been
discussed, or any group of individuals I feel is abusing this
intentionally or grossly.  Maybe there are some things that can help - an
well-maintained SFRaves FAQ so at least people can be "caught up" on
certain issues like, is E cut with heroin or not.  And maybe this "moving
on" phenomenon is just a necessary outcome of the way mailing lists and
internet discussion groups work.  I don't know.  I just hope people think
about this issue, particularly the "you can just delete it" phenomenon,
and maybe make a change.  *shrug*.  

	Brian

the only way i can maintain my sanity and stay on this list is by using
filtering software with some very harsh criteria.  my filter has blocked
1400 messages so far this month.  i wish this weren't necessary, but
otherwise, the volume is too high to be managable.  is there a solution?

Yes! I'm finally back on this wonderful list! If you don't remember
me, I'm the Swede who was bugging you about his equipment in April
and May. I'm also the Swede who wanted people to take him to clubs
before he left for Sweden. Well, now I'm back in the bay area, and
I want to party. So, if you know of any TRANCE happenings, lemme
know, k? =)

Reespect, jonas

Hi-

 I'm stuck in an office doing a graveyard shift while monitoring a database 
conversion.  Anybody else missing out on the happenings tonight?  I'm bored, 
but I did bring my turntables and records to work, so I'm mixing right now as 
I'm sitting at my desk.  I guess that can't be all bad!

Like telephone companies, people using or providing bandwidth have to 
plan for peak loads. Bandwidth cannot simply be available or not be
available. Bandwidth *must* at all times be available if you are
attempting to maintain a network that can send and receive data 24 hours a
day, 7 days a week.  Network managers/engineers must plan for these peak
loads, rather than simply saying "Oh well, guess we're out of bandwidth,
too bad."

Your statement is not applicable to a mailing list. It takes *you* a few
minutes to download all the mail for sfraves for a day. Now, multiply that
by what, 439(I believe this was given as the number of subscribers.) This
is what hyperreal is pushing out.

Yes, but what I was saying is that we have received no evidence that
the bandwidth used by Hyperreal is anywhere near the peak capacity.

If it is, then there undoubtedly would have been an official
announcement.

If it is not, then we gain nothing by using less bandwidth, because as
I said before, bandwidth cannot be saved for another day.

Except that it takes me a couple of minutes to download all of a day's
sfraves e-mail at 28.8kb --- but Hyperreal is pushing out the e-mail
to 439 people over a T1.....  it's still not much bandwidth compared
to a dozen game players who are on the Internet for the whole
afternoon.

You know I just could'nt resist putting in my 02c worth.......... 
 
who cares !!!! it's menial bullshit....... yak yak yak, with nothing to
say....... It makes me wonder what the average age of the SFRaver
is.......... sadly, I'd say about 16 1/2 years old. Usually, I ignore all
the bantering back & forth, but sometimes (like now) I just explode with
disgust........at the pissy & useless subjects that I see people posture
over. 
 
I find SFR a great place to find info on parties, to contact friends, and
to give info out about selling my rave related items (records, tapes,
equipment etc...). as well as a place to air my views. (rave related of
course) 
 
I find asking for hugs over a broken relationship, is completely too
personal a subject to share with 450 people......... kind of selfish and
self serving if you ask me (not that anybody did).  
 
I feel that NRR items have their place, if it's intelligent conversation,
not just opinions that blast other peoples opinions for the sake of being
heard. 
 
Even as I write this e-mail, I wonder if I am not myself a hypocrit, being
that this post relates to other peoples posts, and it's an opinion
etc.........I suppose I should begin with myself........... point well
taken. 
 
As I will be gone in another 4-5 weeks, you will have one less opinion to
put up with, So I'm not even sure why I bother to publicly denounce all the
nit picky stuff, I guess I would just like to see the SFRaves used in a
much more positive way.......sorry    moonpup

A review of "Where the wild things are!"
An Inland Empire rave experience.

I learned just in time that the ODP was busted,  and moved.   Wasn't really
sure I
wanted to make the trek to San Bernardino for "Where the Wild things are"
until a
few people from the Loft wanted a ride and was willing to pitch in for gas.

Using the trusted MapBlaster,   I gathered the approach vectors to the location
according to the info line and soon headed out...

After about 1 1/2 hours of driving,  we finally arrive.  Lots and lots of
cars,
indicated this one was going to be BIG.    I was right.   We arrive at the
venue,  a
large Mexican restaurant,  pay our admittance and was greeted by a nice
security
person saying "Enjoy yourself" and waved us though.   We arrive in this
spacious
outdoor patio with lots and lots of people hanging out,  and I walked by
the main
dance area,  and immediately knew that this one was going to be very good.

On the way in,  I was greeted by a stranger who said "You're an interesting
dude!  I
can tell"  We exchanged greetings,  and Almost immediately I was recognized
by a
few people from San Francisco who were very surprised to see me this far from
the Bay Area.    I told him I had moved a month ago,   and almost
immediately,  was
approached my a host of SoCal ravers and I instantly know the PLUR factor was
going to very high for his party.

It didn't take me long to start groovin to the music,  and in just a few
minutes was
totally in trance state,   helped along by my 5 days of intensive Tao Yoga.

I had thought about dropping,  but totally spaced it out,   I was just lost
in the
energy and totally tracing out with no electrical stimulants this time.  I
didn't
have to....   the 5 days of Tao has had the effect of about 6 months worth
of high
dosages if every imaginable drug,   but without having to ingest anything.

I don't know how long I was out there dancing,  I was so engrossed in the
music,
sometimes being taken out of my trance by a tap pn my shoulder from someone
wanting to say hi,  hug me,  or whatever.    Complete strangers came up to
me and
said "I like your energy... what's your name?"...  I was overwhelmed by the
amazingly high PLUR factor that was of the likes of Friends and Family in SF.

I estimated that over 80 people would say 'There's Jerry Garcia!"
referring to my
big bushy beard.   It was rather comical,  but everyone had big smiles and
happy
vibes all around.

The music was amazing,  not that trancy,  not that hard,  just about right.
Some
tracks were a little low in energy,   but then again,  some were unusually
high.  The
music,  although not a consistent Thump Thump,  was extremely varied,  and
the Dj
Switchovers were a real giveaway....   Sometimes the the turn tables would just
power down,  to be replaced with new songs,  totally different.   There was
also
narration or MC'ing to some extent over some of the tracks,  I thought were
somewhat amusing,  but kind of fresh and new.

By this time,  people were tuning into my energy,  dancing around me,  each
person
trying to grab my attention on the dance floor.    I remember one dude with
a hand
puppet waving it's arms in front of me,  as I waved around and danced in synch
with him.    Many girls came up to me,  wanting to know who I was,  some
asking of
I was the Cap'n.

I don't know when I managed to find my way to the chill area,   but somehow
found
$5 for a killer massage,  as there were 2 tables set up out in the patio,
giving
massages.   I was finished just in time for the hard trance to come on,  so
with
renewed energy and all my blockages removed,  I made beeline to the dance
area to
get down to the business of groovin again.

The main dance area was really spacious,  despite the fact it was a Mexican
restaurant,   and the green lasers were really good eye candy.   Speaking
of Eye
candy,  one dude was wearing this amazing pyramid had that had an amazing
rainbow iridescent reflections from the strobes and lasers.    The strobes
were a
bit too much and disorienting at times,  evident when I was often
unintentionally
bumping into other dancers.   But I was focused on that dudes amazing hat,
totally
tracing out on some amazing eye candy...

All too soon,  the music stopped,  rather abruptly,  and I snapped out of
my trancy
state just in time to have my eyes assaulted by the bright lights.   Don't know
when that was,  but it was just about sunrise.   Then rather rudely,  the
security
said "everyone out!,  come on,  lets keep moving out the door"    I
eventually hooked
up with Mike and the other person and we left.   At the exit,  I was
helping Mike
hand out flyers to his upcoming party...   We eventually went to our cars
and headed
south to San Diego.

unnnnnhhhh

i've been up 32 hours......................................................

I'm sure glad!!!!    +)



 The BDay party was da phattest dope around! Gateway has just been getting 
better and better and the Dance Floor was _incredible_. Visually sublime 
and breathtaking, with high powered articulate audio reinforcemant. I was 
in awe.


 I was pleased with the ambient room, although I wish I had about another 5 
hours and more food this time around. It seemed folks really enjoyed the 
idea of interactive kiosiks that controlled audio and lighting in the 
room. I definately intend to persue these areas of exploration in the 
ambience.

 I did take home some items left behind; a packpack and a set of keys. A 
good description will allow you to claim them. Please email me privately 
and I'll respond promptly.


 I really need to say that what I accomplished in this ambient room (and 
H3 for that matter), could not have been done without the love and 
community that many give freely to our scene, that allows folks to create 
our own little special space. Thank you and may the blessings of the 
Sacred Trinity enrichen all your lives.

Yes but if we all get into 'good' habits, respectful netiquette, and are 
conservative in posting large or useless emails, it will stay and 
non-problem.  The more we 'waste' the available bandwidth the quicker it 
will fill up and also leaves us, the people using hyperreal, looking a 
bit irresponsible for the use of our bandwidth.  (all imho)

Where do I go to learn....

...to set my prejudices aside?
...to be tolerant of others?
...to experience diversity?
...to participate in self expression?
...to give of myself?
...to understand what it means to be human?
...how to relate to others?
...to explore my deepest feelings?
...to feel the sheer joy of movement? 
...to have fun decorating myself?
...that I can trust myself?
...to see people for what they are: people?
...how music flows through my body?
...the sincerity of a hug?
...that someone can express love without asking for anything in return?
...to express my creativity?

I go to a "rave."

And that's just a "few" reasons!!!

That's what raving means to me.

I'm 25, and like sfraves to find other musicians to talk about gear and
making house music and stuff. I've posted a message here and there about
certain types of gear for the sake of information and possibly finding
other people out there that I have never met who have the same interests.
I have gotten messages from a person or 2 that talking about gear is "not
rave related" -- Funny, I thought creating the music was the very essence
of a rave.
Sometimes I wonder if this mailing list is strictly for 16 1/2 year olds
who like blow-pops and like to sneak out of their house to drop E just for
the sake of  the fact that they are getting away with it.  I could and very
well be completely wrong, but, I have to agree with moonpup- and it's the
impression I get many times.  Yes, i may be being a hypocrit too, as I am
bitching and moaning right now, and I have posted more than my share of
stupid messages, but I had to get in my $.02 in too. And when I was 16 1/2
years old, I snuck out many times. Maybe more than I should have. E wasn't
popular at the time though, I just drank. :) - anyway, I'm willing to get
more serious about my posts.
I don't think that any kind of threshold can be set as to what is "rave
related" and what isn't - but common sense can tell you what to post - I
don't think that rave related topics are limited to the dancefloor or the
turntables or the music or anything else, house music has expanded my mind
into realms so vast that anything can be tied to it.
But I do have to say, I know there are a lot of people who are on this list
who subscribe just to listen and not to speak - and I wish they would
speak. Many musicians, DJ's, promoters, business owners, I think it would
be very valuable to everyone on this list.
        So, If anyone wants to flame me, please feel free. I'm willing to
take it.

Where was Sunset. I didn't call any info number and went to the usually

B-Day Party. Kinda wanted to go, but maybe I should sit and ponder about
the party more from last night.

Greetings and PLUR from San Jose

Every harmony party that I got to keeps getting better. I keep reaching a 
new level of happiness and community each time. 
Great music... especially whoever played the sunrise set. that Dj was the 
captain of my ship, if you know what I mean.
Great ambient room set up. hats off to Dionysius Dreams. Especially the 
Harmony tree  with the furry neon leaves. 
Beautiful People.... truly. 
It seems like all the people that I saw at Beautiful People, met at 
Harmony ... I finally got to hang out and talk and interact with. 
Hugs and love to everybody who was at the party. These are all the names 
I remember.....
David, Wes, MAtt(Tie), Rob, Greg, Brendan, Eric Peterson, Jule, Julian ( 
who was slated to fly back to England today.) Ashley, Alison, Rick, Adam, 
Jayne (Ben's neighbor) and of course Libby. That's about all the names I 
could conjure up from my scrambled memory. The faces are all familiar but 
it's the names.... 
Hope to see all of you at Charity next week.

Good morning everyone! (okay, it's 7:30pm, but it somehow feels like morning)

Despite terrible back problems, lack of sleep (I think I was in that
studio for over 24 hours straight), and forgetting to pack food, I
managed to survive and have a great time. Surprisingly, I spent very
little time dancing (very unlike me).

Randy, thanks for putting together the best ambient room yet! Those
crazy swirly lights lurking behind the sheet on the ceiling did wacky
things to me. The whole room was simply beautiful, and it was sooo
much fun to jam out with you and the rest of the toyz. And thanks
everyone for helping me break in my new JX-8P!!! It's now filled with
good vibes and ready to crank out some killer tunes.

I spent so much time in the chill room that I missed most of the main
dance music. Minor, as usual, spun a killer set! That guy has the
grooooviest record collection, in addition to being a cool guy. Missed
most of everyone's sets, unfortunately, boo hiss :)

The last half hour or so of the night, however, totally kicked my ass!
The music was so fast, hard, and fucking phat that I had no control of
body (and proceded to dance my ass off, of course). And hey, David!
Thanks for being up there with me in the end! It's so cool to know
that someone else can still be out of control at 6:30 in the morning
:) My plan was to dance until I had to pealed off of the dance floor,
but the music stopped before I could reach my goal of self-destruction.

Despite my intense back pain, no back-rubs were made available to me
[*sniffle* *sniffle*, no it's okay... really... ;)] But after cleaning up
and taking a brief nap, my back mysteriously healed to the point where
I could walk without looking goofy! So maybe dancing around like a
maniac has some sort of healing properties that I'm not aware of...
Use only as directed.

Anyway, a big thanks and big-ass phat hug to everyone who came,
everyone I met, everyone who I met but forgot their names...again, and
all of the wonderful people that I always look forward to seeing at
every Harmony party :)

What a crazy weekend. I'm almost looking forward to the serenity of my
little office and the Evil Sparc 20.

Don't forget about the pre-Mad dinner tommorrow. Tommorrow will be
special treat for Indian lovers (yummy yummy). More info is coming :)

Steve

well, i can vouch that Greg had an amazing time at his birthday party - such
a great time, in fact, that he probably won't recover until next weekend (if
he's lucky) <g>. So on behalf of greg, i'll thank everyone for coming out
and supporting omar (especial thanks to those who made extra donations for
omar) and for making greg's birthday a memorable one.

my personal best part of the party: when it got so hot that everyone was all
sweaty, and it didn't matter to be sweaty and give someone a hug. :)

and thanks to ran and steve for bringing in the keyboards - i had way too
much fun playing with them (and to troy and mike to explaining exactly what
all those little knobs on ran's keyboard did.)

however, i seem to have gotten myself sick, and i have a previous engagement
on friday, so i won't see everyone next weekend. have an extra good time for
me, ok?

With the recent discussions of what should be posted, what is rave-related, 
and what is not,
it makes me wonder how many people on this list percieve raving.
Does one consider themselves to be a raver because they go to a rave? 
like to dance?
post on sfraves?
Wear "rave clothes"?
Does raving need to have some spiritual significance?
     
Whether you do or don't consider yourself a "raver", 
what does raving mean to you?
     
I know this may be very difficult to put into words, 
but I still would appreciate any effort to do so. 
After all isn't that some of what this list is for?

I wish it had been >MY< Birthday party because it really WENT OFF! 
What an abolutely WONDERFUL space to be in!  It seemed to give what I
love to do so much more respect...dancing in a space >>designed<< for
dancing!  With that wonderful hardwood floor, full mirrors, bathrooms
that were actually sanitary and pleasent, a payphone upstairs, couches,
and it was all so CLEAN!  None of those morning-after black boogers that
one usually ends up with after partying in some dirty warehouse. 
(ahem, I KNOW you all know what I'm talking about.)  I feel kind of spoiled
now...don't ravers deserve better spaces ALL the time?  (then again, as
one of the above said ravers, could I afford to pay higher ticket prices to
have those better spaces?  Probably not...)

The space was great (although I think I'm going to bring my own fan next
time) but the people were even better!  I got the joy of meeting the
Birthday Boy himself and ran into so many of my favorite people from
Harmony...some I knew, some I know now!  And the music?  Lordy! 
Although I am a not-so closeted funky breaks fan, I was really enjoying
the music!  Cloud spun an especially great set...was it him who played
that song from the Trainspotting soundtrack?  Whoever it was made
extra points in my book...

The chill room was wonderful...when I managed to stop dancing I would
go join my friends on some big round pink flat thing in the back of the
room, which was nice.  Music? Good!  Visuals!  mm, tasty!  Gropage
Factor?  Very high.  I'm all for a little E-tardation at times, but there were
some folks GOIN' OFF!  (or was that GETTIN' off?)  Ah well!  Too much
love never hurt anyone (although those friction burns...TEE HEE!  JUST
KIDDING!)

Um, anyway.  In sum, yet another amazing harmony experience.  And
afterwards?  The most wonderful chill-out session with a dozen or so of
my friends in the jacuzzi in Hayward.  AHHHHHHhhhhhhh!

Still a'glowin!

fun, joyous, intense, hot, full of love, and an experience that was
worth ten times the amount of work we put into it :)  It was also a
learning experience for me in the planning and pre-preparation aspects,
which will help me to be of more value as a crew member in the future
:)  My precious Valerie was there, but didn't make an appearance.  I
think she soaked up enough of that unbelievable vibe to help me deliver
an outstanding performance next time :D
I thoroughly enjoyed meeting new friends, seeing newer and older
friends, giving and receiving love, and especially hearing some sweet
Led Zeppelin vocals mixed with beats (Baby, I'm gonna Leave You - who

Love to all, and hope to see ya out there again soon.

Subject: (nyc) Has the scene come to this?????

Sorry for the long post, but I feel very strongly that this needs to be
said.  This past Friday, I decided to check out Unity at Vinyl here in NYC.
The place was crowded and poorly ventilated.  So after a bit of dancing
(which by the way most people were NOT doing), I decided that I needed air
and the chance to cool off.  I got some water and headed over to the side
exit to chill when a security neanderthal decided that people shouldn't be
hanging out in that area.  I stood up, but decided to hang around.  Then, a
group of security guards pulled this kid out of the room that was across
from the steps.  The kid was completely wasted.  He couldn't stand up and
he apparently didn't know where he was.  Security felt that the best way to
deal with this situation was to toss the kid out the door and on the
sidewalk.  They were about to toss him out the door when they decided to
prop him up on the wall beside the doors.  At this time, the girl that he
was with wandered out of that same room, fucked out of her mind.  She
didn't know where she was or even who she was.  She teetered over to the
top of the steps and sat down, staring aimlessly.  Then, the same security
guard that hearded people away from that area walked up the steps to the
girl, straddled her, began fondling her body and kissing her, totally
taking advantage of the situation.  She was so fucked up that she didn't
even know what was going on.  I couldn't believe what I was witnessing.
Here is one of the people that supposedly is supposed hired to "protect" us
is abusing his authority.  WHAT A FUCKING PIG!!!  I was so disgusted by
this that I gathered my friends and left, and I will NEVER set foot in that
place again as long as it remains open (I don't care if God himself is
spinning).

I've been going to so called "raves" for the past eight years and I've seen
a lot of fucked up shit, but this was the absolute worst site I've ever
witnessed.  It seems to me that over the past year, the focus at a party
has shifted from dancing and socalizing to "let's see how fucked up we can
get".  YO, PEOPLE!  WAKE THE FUCK UP!!!!!  Don't EVER let yourself get so
far gone that you have to put your trust (unwillingly) in a total
stranger!!  In case you haven't noticed, the world in which we live isn't
all that safe.  And, if you choose to indulge and let yourself go over the
edge, then that's poor judgement on your part.  Know your limits and for
god's sake, get the scene back on track.  I'm tired of having to wade past
the cracked out little kiddies dribbling on their Tommy Hilfiger trainers
to get to the dance floor.  That's not amusing to me, and neither is rape.

        No review would do it justice. It was of course incredible. What a
party to end all for me here in this time.  Everything was too good, the
space, decorations, music and the people. The chill room was awesome. Got
to play on the keyboards a few times. That was totally cool having it open
for people just to play around on them.

 Well it's been alot of fun and meet alot of people. Hope you all have a
great time here. He's out the door, turn off the lights knuckleheads party
is over. He's gone with the wind. C-ya

It's very sad to hear and even come close to visualizing the scene you 
just described.  Why are we at the parties in the first place? And when 
we are here, can we keep full control of ourselves in a scene where 
elixirs are rampant? I guess the answer is in ourselves, whether or not 
one can keep him\herself in check.  As far as the part about the girl 
being raped, those pig-headed-cretins will burn in hell for their actions.
Peace! S.F. raver @ The Gathering.

     Argh!
     
     I decided I would keep my self to one rave a weekend for a while...
     
     So I tell my drummer and beloved friend that I will finally take him 
     to a rave.  He flakes, and leaves me with this other guy I used to 
     work with (who is a self centered jerk) with me.  I figure I have to 
     mellow him out > READ COMATOSE (this alone probably required clear 
     cutting of half of Humboldt county's finest).  After adequate sedative 
     therapy (you all really would have liked him) we go to Harvest Moon.  
     After following the directions, I freaked... this is where EVERY 
     mountian bike ticket I've ever recieved was... and nobody as there at 
     1:00am (hello!).  I found the parking lot right away, but knew that 
     couldn't be it (no cars you see).  So we drove around the Marin 
     headlands for a while, even going so far as to wander into the 
     military base.
     
     The military base was uneventful, thankfully (nightmares of latex 
     gloves and bizarre searches and questioning).  The area was beautiful, 
     and I would like to thank those that tried to throw this party for 
     trying, and not to freak and use Acme or the Jerrold deli for their 
     next attempt.  I was awestruck by the beauty of the area at night, and 
     I'd love to just rave/dance/freak there someday.  High risk raves... 
     those are the ones that go *legendary*.
     
     IT WOULD HAVE BEEN SOOOOOOOO!!!!!
     
     Viva beautiful outdoor parties... I'm hearing about another Moontribe 
     party down south coming up... anybody want to commute?
     
     Love,
     AndyW
     
     P.S.       And after a while, I started second guessing everything, 
     and the quote "It's a REAL underground" or something like from the 
     voice mail that kept ringing in my head as I passed the 'authorized 
     vehicles only' sign.
     
     Final Note:        After meeting some people at the bottom of the 
     hill, it turned out some high ranking officer of the Coast Guard was 
     getting married that very night, and security had been ramped up for 
     the event (it was at that illuminated pier on the water just east of 
     that big rusty colored thingy).  Maybe that didn't help.  Bummer...

My VCR is set.  I'll see how it turns out when I get home.  If anyone
wants to see it, I might be convinced to host a "viewing" some night of
the week for those who couldn't see it.  Popcorn anyone?  I live in
downtown Berkeley which is *kind of* centrally located.  We can
fast-forward the commercials!! :)

hey,
I was getting ready to tape that Leeza show when I realized our TV isn't
hooked up yet!  (We moved about a month ago, and since we never watch
TV, we haven't bothered to have service connected.  It's one of those
lame places where you have to get cable hookup just to get public
channels) anyway,
is anyone who lives near pacifica (san francisco) or works near palo
alto gonna tape it, and if so, could I borrow it sometime?  i think it
will be fun to watch, I'd really like to see Leslie!

thanks,
shamini

Do you know why the guy who wrote this didn't do anything?  Instead of
leaving, it might have been better to get the guard OFF of the girl.  This
is typical of what happens in rape cases.  Women being raped are told to
yell "Fire" instead of rape because people won't help them if they think
they are being raped.  I'm not passing judgment here, I don't know the
particulars, but maybe gathering his friends and helping the girl would
have been more productive than leaving.  Not that the author is
saying this, but frequently women get "blamed" for being raped because
they were too fucked up to know any better.  I fully support being
responsible for your own actions, and I would never allow myself to get so
incoherent that I didn't know what was going on, but even so no one
deserves to be raped if they make mistakes.
I do hope that something was done about the man raping this woman.  He is
the one that holds the responsibility here because he was the one who was
in control at the moment things happened.  

I really don't want this to turn into some big flame-war.  I am concerned
that this happened, and want to know if you know any more of the details.
Obviously, the author is rightfully concerned, and I thank you for
bringing this to our attention.  No one deserves to have this happen to
them.  Unfortunately, there are many people who think that this is okay
behavior. 

Thanks, 
KaySEE

Hi,

My roommate wanted me to post this.  He's not on SFR.  I forwarded 
Krishna's revue to him.

just the middle man,

_____________	

Somehow it looked like people were dancing to me. i played an hour set 
out of soulstice and people were dancing holes in the floor. jamalski was 
in the house for an extra special treat. concider yourself lucky to 
hear and see 2 bands and two Dj's for what $4 and instead of bagging on 
the 
crowd contribute 
to the energy by putting your hands together, lifting your feet, and 
opening your head holes.111 mina street is a cafe/galery/beer,wine bar 
with a 60/40 lounge chair/ dance area split. IT IS WHAT IT IS... yes 
while 
some people in the art crowd seem a tad bit snooty at times, think, they 
could be chillin' thinking how pretencious you are being.
Much respect,

Well I hate to say it but....

Apparently some channels showed the Leeza show this morning (9-10am on 
the Santa Cruz/Monterey station). My wife (a non-raver) saw it and
it sounds like the fears of many were justified (sorry to say this
Leslie!). Yes, Leslie came over very well but it sounded like they
didn't give her much time to speak, and instead focussed on the
teenage runaways and the drug-dealer in the audience, and made
raves sound like total drug-fests. Apparently there were a bunch
of "ravers" in the audience - spiked-hair, leather-clad transvestite-
types - I mean, hardly representative! Anyone sitting on the fence about
raves would have been given completely the wrong impression about
raves - at least the kind WE know and love! From the sound of it
(I haven't seen the show myself - this is from my wife's description)
any parent watching the show would feel VERY worried about their
kids wanting to go to a rave and would probably forbid it or at
least discourage it. 

I've only ever known the SF rave scene, so maybe it's totally different
in other places (sounds like it is in nyc!). It sounds to me like we
have something very special here and we have to work to protect it
and keep it the positive scene that it is. We should remember that
in our hearts and treasure it for the beauty that it is. *We* know
how incredible this thing is - maybe that's going to have to be enough.

Thanks everyone who helped put this together. It's amazing what to see 
the work that goes into these parties- large or small! It's even more 
amazing what it takes out of the people after it's all over. Hi-fives 
all around to the walking dead were scraping up gum and stuff after the 
music stopped. 

Thanks to all the happy faces, the crazy fools that were dancing at 6:30 
in the morning, the DJ's, the folks who own the space (which is really 
nice!), Ran & Steve for the ambiance, Greg for having a birthday and 
Ethan for not killing me when I nudged the decks (boo alex!).

-peace-
alex

I totally disagree.     If we can't share what affects us most in our
lives with our community, why bother pretending we belong to a community?
Asking for a hug is never selfish-

Enough Already!!!!  Jesus H Fucking Christ!  Who gives a flying rats ass 
whats Rave and whats Not Rave.  Does it Really Matter??  We're all 
friends here right?  Right???  I'd be pretty damn bored with my friends 
if all we talked about was Raves and $2 Water Bottles and E and Music and 
Dancing.  It makes for some pretty boring conversation if talked about 
24/7.

Lighten up.  A *communitee* is built on *communication*.  If you dont 
like what you're reading, use the delete key.  Everyone seems to have the 
BSP and NRR headers down.  Look for those, if you dont want to read it, 
delete it.  its easy.

I've said it before, and I'll say it again, I LOVE SFR just like it is.  
Makes my days at work a little more intertaining.   And Hey, Just think, 
you might actually learn something from some of those NRR posts.

Sorry to waste bandwidth, folks. Please flame me privately :)

This is a real longshot, but does anyone have a truck or a van that I
can borrow this week? I'm moving to a new apartment (thanks Sarah!!!)
in the city this week, and my stuff needs to come with me.

I considered renting something, but the problem is that I need to move
at night, due to my work schedule, and that makes dealing with rental
places a little complicated.

Thanks!

Steve

seriously, if *anyone* even *thought* of tossing out a party like *that*

umm... what was that song that Dan-O played at the *very end* of the party?
It kicked my ass way hard.

  A friend once said to me (back in the early 70s), "We've danced to the
Dead in Golden Gate Park, and we've seen God in a flower. NOW what do we
do?"
  Even now: the DJ stops and packs up the turntables, and we return to
"the common light of day." The only answer I've found so far to this
radical rupture in our lives is this Zen koan:

Hey all,

Looking at things to do this week--was going to ask if many/any of you
would recommend Come/Unity at 1015 this Wednesday.  Looking for uplifting
hard house/techno, but mostly a friendly vibe and a top evening...  And
whoever's going like to see you there!

Not to be overly demanding, but I was also wondering if there are any
record shops in the Bay area with lots of imported new UK label releases.
There's some hooj choons from my summer in London I'd like to pick up.
Any one got Faithless' "Insomnia" (UK Cheeky records) that they don't
want?  If this is on a FAQ, many humble apologies...

Thanks a lot everyone--hope you all had an incredible weekend!

Spence

(Praying that this is well out of the NRR zone)

Hi folks-

 I was able to see the first half hour of the Leeza show, and to sum it up is 
easy.  They (producers, writers, etc, etc) probably had a preconcieved idea of 
what they wanted to show.  Leslie represented herself well, but from what I saw 
the show wasn't giving her any opportunity to explain her viewpoint.
 Watching the show in the workout room with my fellow employees taught me 
several things:  1) I work with people who are very influenced by TV, 2) these 
people think all raves are like what was described on the show, and 3) my 
collegues couldn't believe that someone like myself was involved with raves.  
Anyway, I felt that I needed to vent my two cents to others who can understand.

-Thanks, Todd

Hi people-

 Trying to find this record may be difficult.  It was originally put out on 
Cheeky records last year about this time.  Trying to find a copy state-side may 
be difficult, but here are some recommendations to places that might be able to 
help you.

Resonance Records-www.netcreatioins.com/resonance/
Secret Tunes Club-193.123.77.10:80/NWAIAG/stc/
Tag Records-www.tagrecords.co.uk/


 Resonance is located in Florida, and they are good about getting imports.  STC 
and Tag are both located in the UK, and they have a better selection of top 
choons from Europe if that's what you're looking for.  If I can be of any more 
help, let me know.

-Todd

I WANT IT TOO! It has to be one of the top 5 tunes of '96!

I'm taping and watching....

(1) Drugs, drugs, drugs, drugs, drugs, and how raves help introduce
    innocent little 13 year olds to drugs. Shots of audience members "eyes
    rolling" when people say "it's not about the drugs, it's about music."

(2) It's "cult like". Secretive locations keeps parents from finding out
    what their kids are doing. Most of the rhetoric aimed at "what your
    teenager is doing behind your back"...

(3) Leslie Ayres came off very well, however, she is the only one that
    really cast any positive light on this at all -- by being one of the few
    people that spent any time defusing the drug/cult/danger-to-youth message
    of this show. Kudos to Leslie for not landing on the cutting-room
    floor. They didn't give her much time on the air, but she did get
    in some good counter-punches, e.g. 13-16 year olds don't have any
    business doing drugs, and that parenting isn't about "controlling your
    kids". But they never let her get past sound bytes, and it was basically 
    ten against one, with leslie being the only believable defender.

(4) Lots of "club kids" looking like freaks. I'm all for freaks, but it's very
    rare to see tons of people looking like that at raves, even in NYC. I'm
    sure the guys fellating the lollipops will play well with the hayseeds
    in the midwest....

(5) This show concentrated entirely on the under-21 set. Most of the
    ravers I've seen/known are over 21, and most of the raves I go to seem to
    average at about 25 years old. This show made it seem like raves are
    just for kids who want to sneak out of their houses against their parents
    consent and do drugs.

Hey!  I'm sure you're all really shocked to see another glowing review of
a Harmony rave by me!  ;)

That's right, Harmony once again succeeded in totally blowing our
collective minds on Saturday!  It was, of course, sheer insanity.  I had
gone for a long, long walk with my friend on Saturday afternoon/evening
(from my place on Haight, up Buena Vista park, across the ridge into UCSF,
all the day down Judah to the ocean, up the beach to Geary, then along
Geary to home.)  So of course I was a total basket case before I even got
there.  In fact, my intention was to leave early - yeah right!

The voicemail was giving the wrong address at first - 3779 16th - but I
guessed (correctly) that they meant Komotion.  I was flakey and tired
enough that I forgot to write down the actual *address* I was going to,
instead merely figuring that knowing it was 24th & Mission would be
enough.  Duh!  So I spent some time wandering around Mission, looking for
co-conspirators.  In the end, I followed some glowing sticker-covered
people who looked like they knew where they were going :)

I was early, I guess - the music hadn't yet started, so I got to hang out
with the wonderful people, try to lend a hand where it was needed, gawk at
the pretty colors - you know.  I was totally brain-dead with fatigue, but
of course that's never stopped me before, and it didn't again!  Yay!  The
music was hopping, of course.  Early on I got recruited by Matt to help
out selling water.  FUN!  I never imagined how much fun it could be, and
the buildup of energy in me was great fun (I could hear the music, I
wanted to move, but I was trapped... so the energy accumulated...)
Whoever was spinning at that point was spinning HARD stuff!  Whoa.

Steve eventually relieved me, which allowed me to release that explosive
pent up energy (and to learn why everyone was so sweaty!  It was *hot* in
there!)  Wooooo!  I could only go for a few minutes at a time, though.  I
have no self-control.  When I dance, it's all out or nothing!  But when
it's hot like that, I stop being able to breate after a few short minutes
of dancing :S

I was "tricked" into working the water bar again through most of Minor
Minor's set.  I got a kick out of it, though - the Harvest Moon people
(whose party had been busted the night before) brought all the food they
had, for us to give away.  Very sweet of them, and made for a lot of
smiling faces!  (mmm.... blueberry muffins....)

At some point we sold out of water, so I got to boogie the rest of the
night.  Yaaaay!  Whoever that last DJ was kicked all our asses... incl.
Steve "I'm too broken to dance at all tonight" Simitzis.  Kept us moving
to the bitter end.  Steve - you have no idea how close I came to falling 
over, carrying you off the dance floor :P.  Boy was I tired!!!  But
happy!  So much for leaving early!  

Lovely to see all your smiling faces again.  I met a *lot* of wonderful
people!  Got my weekend's dosage of hugs & love.  Of course, I haven't
really slept yet, as I spent yesterday helping our old friend Robert Brown
move.  Ugh!  Tired.

Mege-mega-mega hugs to Greg -- Happy Birthday!  Let's have another one
next weekend!  Whooooo!  Charity!!  I'll see you all there!

i do not know leslie, but i think she did a great job of showing herself as
an intelligent human being who enjoys having a great time with her friends. 

i think the reason why there was so little air time on leslie is because she
did not come across as someone whose life has been ruined by going to raves.
i mean, for rating purposes, why give time to someone who is responsible,
happy with her life and making sense.  if they gave her more time she may
have said something that the youth of america could relate to, which would
defeat the purpose of the show and make people want to check out our
wonderful rave community!  they could not let that happen!

great job leslie!!

You know it was a good night when in what seems about an hour the party is
over and you're pulling Harmony flowers off the wall until 9am.

I just wanted to point out that the rave scene in the bay
area has the oldest crowd that I've seen. In many cities,
people over the age of 21 are the minority.

  After much waiting and writing reminder notes in odd places all over my
house, the Leeza/Leslie show finally arrived.  However, in my rush to get out
of the house this morning (I woke up late with a head cold)  I forgot to set
my VCR>  I cannot convey the agony I am feeling over this stupid mistake.  I
was truly looking forward to seeing how well all of you that went down south
for the taping told us that Leslie did.  And I have less than enough patience
to wait for reruns.  Please... if anyone taped it and is willing to send me a
copy let me know.  I'm willing to send out a tape for you to copy on or
whatever reimbursment is necessary.  Thanx for your time.

    Beating myself over the head,

I took lunch to watch Leeza, and the misrepresentation of the rave scene
would have been a lot worse had Leslie not been so even-keeled and spot-on!

Research are about *that* much closer to confirming such an event for
Friday, Nov. 8th.  I'm not sure how many of you on the list were there
at "Plantasia" (New Years Eve '95) to see his first show out here.  If
you did, then you know what to expect. If not, then be prepared for
about an hour of TECHNOlogy and funk intertwined like you've never
heard by Carl Craig (aka Paperclip People and 69).  This will be a
"live" show, unlike some that claim to be live but twiddle knobs to a
DAT recording (Moby and Dee-Lite to name a couple).

    It would be nice if you guys could come out and support this event,
since that would make it easier for the promotors at T.I.M.E. to stick
to their commitment of showcasing more Detroit talent in the future.
It's not about happy hardcore or funky breaks over acid lines, it's
just pure techno.  A better definition can be found in the 50th edition
of URB magazine who did (IMO) an excellent job in its presentation of
where and how the American techno scene was born.

    Carl will be planning to stay out here for about a week, so if
anyone else would like to have him perform at his/her event, please
contact me at Plug Research.  Thank you and goodnight!

I just wanted to let every one know that I have succesfully convinced my

I do however still have one last cat that is in need of a loving & patient
owner....... 
 
she is a lovely grey cat with some quirky behaviors....... like chasing a
tin foil ball and fetching it for you to throw again........ 
 
if I can't find a home in the next 4 weeks, she will have to take her
chances at the pound, and that is a sad situation for both her & I........ 
 
I am still hopeful that some one will step forward and help me out.........

 
thanks & forgive me for airing my dirty laundry on SFR once
again........moonpup

I just wanted to let every one know that I have succesfully convinced my
mom to take 2 of my cats......yehaaa... 
 
I do however still have one last cat that is in need of a loving & patient
owner....... 
 
she is a lovely grey cat with some quirky behaviors....... like chasing a
tin foil ball and fetching it for you to throw again........ 
 
if I can't find a home in the next 4 weeks, she will have to take her
chances at the pound, and that is a sad situation for both her & I........ 
 
I am still hopeful that some one will step forward and help me out.........

 
thanks & forgive me for airing my dirty laundry on SFR once
again........moonpup

Actually, it was *supposed* be called Gravitational Arch of Io, but
due to a printer's error (so the legend has it), was first released
as Gravitational Arch of 10 and has remained that way ever since.

Either way, a classic track.

Just one comment in reply to Neils, the SF scene is very atypical and most
of the "underground" parties elsewhere, certainly in the Northwest, have
a very young average age -- 18 or less, and it's been falling for a couple
of years.  The lack of diversity is one of the reasons I'm not going out
hardly at all any more.

Legend also has it that the entire track itself was an accident.  Mark
Gage hit start on one of his boxes and it began triggering something
else entirely.  His DAT just happened to be running and he twiddled for
several minutes getting it all down :)

Can anyone confirm this?

Glad you had a good time, Steve.  Yeah, the 21 and up restriction was a
pain.  We will be looking for a less restrictive venue for the next event,
but this is not easy.  Food Not Bombs has very little money for an initial
investment.  The arrangement with El Rio allowed us to keep the door
proceeds, while El Rio kept the bar tab.  It was a pretty good arrangement
for us both, plus the owner is really into FNB.  However, their license does
not allow them to do something like giving stamps or bracelets to those over
21 in order to allow those younger to get in.

If anyone knows of any venues that are either cheap (or willing to donate
their space) or willing to make some kind of arrangement like El Rio, yet is
willing to let in a younger crowd, PLEASE email me.

Thanks and take care.

Kerry

I am one of the proud people putting on this rave.  Myself and many 
others have put alot of hard work and love into making this the best 
party we can.  We are building a 20ft. robot, Jeff from Nexus is doing 
a Holistic Sancuary/Chill room, with a swing, and a huge fountain. 
Were flying in visual people, and Djs from all over the U.S.  We are 
making a donation of new toys and stuffed animals to oakland's annual 
toy drive for kids.  I could go on and on, but I won't.

Hi Brian,

The new Beta version of Eudora (3.0.1) has filter capabilities so my
problem with NRR stuff is solved.  Anyone can get a free copy from

Did anyone else get this?  I know time passed remarkably quickly for me,
and a couple of people I talked to mentioned the same effect.  When someone
said the final DJ was on, I could hardly believe it until I checked the
time and found it really was already after 5:30.  I figure it's good...when
you can't keep track of the time, something cool must be absorbing your
attention.

Which shows, one might suggest (OK, emphasis on the "might"), the
superiority of the Bay area rave scene's appeal to genuine maturity and
understanding, a result equally of its participants and its producers.  I
hope, anyway, that the Bay area can sustain a rave scene whose appeal does
not depend on adolescent rebellion but on a real commitment to joy for all.
